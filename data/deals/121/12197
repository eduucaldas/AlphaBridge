nt|Walddk2: Systems Simon?|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is the tightest match of the round of 16|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't believe that Clair passed|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: wrong board|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe they are not playing this board at all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: wait a moment|pg||
nt|hedyg: Carlo would not open 1NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1NT not exactly textbook either|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like they turned the board|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe "tightest match" meant...|pg||
nt|hedyg: closest score Marshall|pg||
nt|hedyg: might a free translation from French|pg||
nt|Walddk2: wronf file it seems. open room operator shut down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "tight" is american slang for "tipsy"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Simon will do too|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: wrong file system|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: we quit and then come back|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2 minutes|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: hi everyone from a foggy, freezing Manchester|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looking at the NS hands, 6@C is not so unreasonable |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@h limit raise @h|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm i better check that|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 6@C is pretty good and preemption might boost them into it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nothing new there then|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Yes nightmer|pg||
nt|milton_se: buying this cheaply|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not lucky enough perhaps?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, in Italy the natural is 5 majors and 4@D (so 1@C can be only 2 cards)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: But it's awkward to bid 5@C now since partner will think opener has more hearts|pg||
nt|henryb: Have Fantunes changed system? The last time I watched them they played forcing one bids and 10-13 two bids|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No change there|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they're in the open room:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might take the money here|pg||
nt|hedyg: double passed out by Versace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: If the defence never leads @H, 4@S might not make|pg||
nt|othered1: That's still a pretty wide range.  Some very good pairs in the USA use a similar approach, but there are holes in the system, if the opponents pay attention.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  As long as E/W doÂ´nt touch the @H-suit, all is OK|pg||
nt|me argent: east resisted bidding his chunky 7 card @C suit with his uninteresting distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Do we know if 2@C is natural?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: GF|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks natural|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would be tempted to bid 5@D with an 8 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Takes a very good defence to defeat 6@C|pg||
nt|tweety1: 4 @s by NS can be beaten by 1d lead|pg||
nt|tweety1: @d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@h jump medium force - typical in italian style|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: E-W play Angelini's version of Precision|pg||
nt|hedyg: try this rather:|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|wilkinsona:  canape sequence from north it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1any has always been forcing, 14+   and 2any  10-14|pg||
nt|henryb: Ah, but we do not have Fantunes|pg||
nt|brolucius: South can discount a slam since they play a strong 1@C system.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: @d lead?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well as cards lie 6 of a red looks pretty good|pg||
nt|lestergold: not suggesting it should be bid!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Notice the canapé style of N-S. So Blue Club it is, Simon?|pg||
nt|othered1: Old-fashioned forcing 2N would describe south's hand well, too.|pg||
nt|hedyg: guess he already showed that with 4 @d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is a very interesting match|pg||
nt|hedyg: N could have raised to 3@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
pc|s3|nt|milton_se: not a double?|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N looks fairly cold also|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N+2 looks likely at both tables|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: after this board, i'll ask them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Andrea Manno is one of the Italian rising stars. Still a junior, in his early 20's I think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West does have a tricky decision at trick 2|pg||
nt|petergill: @CQ shows the jack, then West should continue clubs, I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: but his pd acted anyhow|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I have really been coveretd to splinters over 1Nt |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: by hands like the West one now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wilkinsona:  this might go ddown..|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like off 4?|pg||
nt|varange: do you know much about NS Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S with four cards is somewhat dangerous when you know that partner has close to nothing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DA and another is the only defence|pg||
nt|blunotte11: buon contratto|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no game for E/W with this layout|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hi bill|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|othered1: What would be the effect of @CK under the ace?|pg||
nt|othered1: @DK, rather|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We shall see|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Drop the King, South|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1st hurdle overcome by Giubilo, but then what?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: would be a good play. South must be aware of extreme diamond length|pg||
nt|varange: hi Giorgio|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me find a Nightmare CC|pg||
nt|varange: the lastest version please Roland, not the old one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|henryb: Problem is to find eighth trick: you have two hearts, two diamonds and three clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow what happened here while i was checking CCs?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: No, I don't know them|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And no old-fashioned signalling with the trumps E/W, please|pg||
nt|petergill: unless Wes worries that South's @H losers might go on dumy's |pg||
nt|petergill: @D's|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lanzarotti-Manno had a terrific first set against Fantoni-Nunes last night|pg||
nt|daman: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: hi|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi George :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *converted|pg||
nt|henryb: Lauria might have done better to pass out 1N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone !|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: At least|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 1@H showed @s|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing a standard system, South would have to bid 2@D (fourth suit) at his second turn, in case North was strong and a slam was a good bet.|pg||
nt|bardo: 3 sa anche in aperta|pg||
nt|henryb: Playing a standard system North would open 1@c, S 1@d, N 1@H, S 1@s, N 2@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: here is a nightmare CC http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf    this is what they play, more or less|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Simon|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: might depend on EW's carding agreements|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, especially when Cs may be an option|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The king would not help against good defenders as East would follow with the 10 from 108x|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Full credit to Giubilo regardless. Very well done!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyway, down now. Unlucky.|pg||
nt|othered1: Right, can't do better than make winning decision|pg||
nt|hedyg: so as usual Versace made the right decision|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|henryb: Gm Giorgio|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tejjyid: this lookslike some kind of stopper showing, which will probably cheive the same result|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: 1NT was a stronger  NT than 15/17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I could think of a few puns with South's name involved :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course at tis stage declarer cannot be sure of hs contract]|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: More if declarer isn't careful|pg||
nt|brolucius: If the @S2 was indeed led from a 4-card suit (which is a good bet if 4th-best leads are in operation), declarer would know that the contract was safe. He could lose no more than ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: three spades and the @CK. By playing the @SJ, he breaks communications when West has five spades. |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Same lead against 6 NT - and Soiuth can make it double-dummy|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|varange: :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Slam is in taf excellent, due to the @H J|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphztg: no 15-17|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice 10@s in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  There is a danger in the @C-suit, if North tries some safety-play - and East plays the Jack. Might give North bad plans.|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Simon, i thought you said they play strong NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: hi|pg||
nt|tejjyid: failing that, the @S finesse, which is what the players will be thinking|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I am told: 2@d=4@s or min.  2nt = min. 3@d = 5m 3@s = 5@d - don't know if that's correct|pg||
pc|c5|nt|wilkinsona:  ok,....ddddown|pg||
nt|sharkey: Lauria knows pd is void in @S as wud have played Q from QJ|pg||
nt|varange: no limericks please!|pg||
nt|me argent: EW went very quietly here|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|hedyg: and he did have 19 hcps|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yeah, cause usually who plays strong @c play weak nt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems very logical|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|wilkinsona:  lucky we can see all the hands and know that every card is right|pg||
pc|c6|nt|me argent: sorry NS|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|petergill: Manno will play off 5 or 6 rounds of @S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brolucius: East still has a spade, so the suit will be 4-4 (unless West found an unlikely lead from a 3-card suit into a bid suit).|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Nightmare was wrote for Buratti - Probably now they will play different gadgets, but the base of system is for sure the same of book|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hi Hedy ! i am in a little trouble, 3 minutes for me :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: this club suit aint coming in|pg||
nt|othered1: Souith, with lots of defense, has to worry about partner's defensive potential, despite the opening bid.  Can lose a chance for a big pick up now and then.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Whatever, they seem to know what they are doing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, one way or another, that's a fine start for EW|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Extremely good bidding|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's a good auction when there is nothing to say about the play...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was interesting how 3NT made in the OR|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hawe45:  Defence has placed the @C-stopper at West only, bad idea|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|varange: no easy exit available, is there?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, S is sort of endplayed|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|petergill: West's @C8 was best - a @h would have been fatal|pg||
nt|petergill: @D or @h now?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: go on...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, apparently, declarer had a club stopper - his @C9 won a trick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: rofl|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not obvious|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: west about to have his 2h promoted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria knows the whole hand now and will pitch a diamond|pg||
nt|sharkey: In OR E overcalled 1@S thus N not subjected to the pressure bid 4@S - so no sacrifice|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It makes now!|pg||
nt|petergill: If West discarded a @H when he pitched @H8, South crosses to @Dk, leads a heart up, then pins @HJ10|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There's a lot of play left in this hand.  This is where GIB doesn't really help us|pg||
nt|petergill: I think @C4 looks OK, but I'm not sure|pg||
nt|petergill: When I wrote @H8, I meant @C8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I suppose it's the last trump that really turns the screw ... but will declarer know this?|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot avoid losing 2 @cs|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: It's a fine system. I like that 18-19 balanced is included in the 1@D opening|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt weak, so 1@c can be 15/17 bal - 1@C can have 11hcp with 6@c 5x ! or any 15+ with 4+@C|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Nunes is out of table|pg||
nt|bridge_one: thie the old version - they change frequently the sequence, overall when change the partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  1M  ;  1NT  18-19   much better than the awkward jump to 2NT|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H can be 4 cards in 3 suit hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, it was an embarrassing mis-defence.  My misdefences generally cost 10 imps (minimum) - theirs picks up 10 imps|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: Those who missed the first set did not miss anything. The bridge was pretty awful (if you are wllowed to use pretty and awful in the same sentence)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tweety1: isn't it a bit strange South stayed so silent after pd opened?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And will he pick the position?|pg||
nt|henryb: I forgot the @s trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: np  Gio |pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Wrong again|pg||
nt|milton_se: trying to beat it costs an overtrick|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: We can see that he can make it if he reads the position, but he can't|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|milton_se: but it is for free|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Which I think is to drop West's @HAK doubleton|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is the mark of a winner, Bill|pg||
pc|h7|nt|petergill: @HJ clarifies to East that it is South who has @HQxx|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Mine, sadly, cost 13|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|sharkey: off 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but a diamond pitch would had led to 800|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|blunotte11: questo e' un top|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: he made 5@d|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Aftes EastÂ´s double: Yes|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: Anyway, the @CK was onside.|pg||
nt|petergill: Good defence|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: What a start, great hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It could certainly be argued that the bidding was helpful|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and funny bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: Fantastic hand - perhaps South might have picked the ending|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Welcome to Thomas Gotard|pg||
pc|cT|nt|othered1: That's one of those potential holes in the system|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: cause N opening starts from 8|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|xenya: S will get one more trick, but that's all|pg||

nt|bridge_one: many kibittz ask me why Lauria and Versace don't play togheter - they never play togheter in italian competition :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: lol Simon|pg||
nt|bridge_one: too much strong :)|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Obvious heart lead for South ...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like a @S, myself|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: 3N should go off on careful defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: but might it now before pd leads a @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: nope|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1nt possible, 2Nt long to make - so 2@s open would work here|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: uwelcome|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d played in EW|pg||
nt|othered1: I couldn't stay out if they had bid the pointed suits|pg||
nt|tomi2: is this the event that sends its champion the the European Champions Cup next year? I mean in Germany we also have a KO Cup and a Round Robin League, here the league is more ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: important|pg||
nt|tweety1: ty|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Ed :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: hi ed welcome back!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's pretty good by Sabbatini|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, well I was joking, but apparently Sabbatini isn't|pg||
nt|hawe45:  My partner never leeds like THAT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There is an argument for leading your stronger major against this auction - but it's a fairly thin line of reasoning|pg||
nt|tejjyid: There is some reason tolead a major, the absence of Stayman|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think it's enough, but the @H seems committal; perhaps the good pips are enough of an argument?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: maybe from Kxx it's less attractive|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think the idea is you don't worry about it ... just lead your stronger major|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Lauria trying to divine what possible distribution would allow him to make?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: i guess so; good luck with that|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 14 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|varange: amaazing layout|pg||
nt|yo_yo: dicing with death|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: nko reason for the stiff KC to be found|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To me Easts hand more looks like a @C-@d reverse hand - no intermediates for NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: did u mean to say that the bridge wa pretty awesome?|pg||
nt|othered1: Here's Masselli's 2-suited bid -- bid them both.|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think N has another bid|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: and the lead would be @S, not @c|pg||
nt|milton_se: oops|pg||
nt|varange: ouch|pg||
nt|brolucius: West is (much) too good to bid 4@S, so he marks time with the fourth suit. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: West's hand is suited for a strong jump shift at his first turn, but no-one plays those any more I guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 2@S and then 4@S, to show a great suit but not many controls.|pg||
nt|daman: very oxymoronic|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems, that only South is vulnerable...!|pg||
nt|hedyg: no entry to the S hand for a @H finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: can doublefinesse in both black suits|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@h with maximum .... strange|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Rehi, everyone!|pg||
nt|hedyg: re Ed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: technically is correct to play double finesse - so 4@h made|pg||
nt|varange: hi Ed|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: I am Fabio not Simon :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Paper thin game ... but once East has opened, it's inevitable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nunes is in the same position in the other room. With four cards left, East is down to the singleton @HK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer has @HQx and @DAx|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe @HA, @SA, and a low heart?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: seems 2@H was forcing..|pg||
nt|xenya: a wheel came off?|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh sry Fabio!|pg||
nt|hedyg: ciaooooo!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: we have changed|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ciaooo|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Funny situation - you must play for 2-2 in @D or accept to loose a trich to SOUTH, not to North|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and read it!|pg||
pc|c9|nt|wilkinsona:  unless its led|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  even when I do play em I can't get my partners to use them|pg||
nt|lestergold: this must mean please make a cue bid pard|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: We often see the weak jump shift mis-used on BBO VuGraph, so perhaps better to play strong jump shifts, even if you never use them.|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@d = at least one 4 card major, no 5 card major|pg||
pc|cT|nt|varange: two|pg||
nt|milton_se: nice to agree on what´s forcing :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so i see!|pg||
nt|othered1: lack of @S length didn't dissuade Nunes from doubling.  Is that a specific defense to Polish @C they have adopted?|pg||
nt|othered1: some players "always" raise with 4-card support.  North isn't one of them and on this shape it seems precipitous to raise|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: Assuming a @S lead dont think you need @C finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: here declafrer can afford the safety play|pg||
nt|hedyg: not really enough for reverse|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure - but minimum!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The @H-suit brings this 3 NT safely home|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a @s lead...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Whatever lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: guess @h help the declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: now he needs to ask for another one!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: lauria is a good soldier:)|pg||
nt|henryb: Its not that uncommon to play strong JS at the two level in a 2/1 structure|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S is forcing because it was preceded by the fourth-suit bid.|pg||
nt|lestergold: but Lauria with massive controls will soon get the message] |pg||
nt|brolucius: West might 'invent' 4@D, to see if East has a heart control.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i agree|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: it's the winning bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: not actually easy to bid this hand|pg||
nt|henryb: look how easy this hand is after 1@d-2@s: East splinters with 4@h and West bids Backwood|pg||
nt|brolucius: Obviously does not show a diamond control, when bid so slowly... |pg||
nt|Walddk2: West in the other room could not be 100% certain that they had a heart control between them|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sometimes you have to lie:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: going for the throat|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow a rare thing to see 2 @H X|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Back in the match|pg||
nt|hedyg: did he find an extra ace?|pg||
nt|daman: would 2NT by North always be 15-18?|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Welcome to Steve Robinson|pg||
nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Steve!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i don't know if 4@s is correct after initial dbl at 1@c - 3+@S in North for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk8: and to Sharyn Reus|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: but we were deprivd of watchi9ng for it|pg||
nt|hedyg: and a @d switch..|pg||
nt|othered1: avoided trump lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - but created by NorthÂ´s bidding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ok - 3@h is 4 cards with minimum, can be 14 only with 4333 - right - agrre the gadget|pg||
nt|sharynr: hi al|pg||
nt|othered1: @S position will have this coming up one short|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Sharyn!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: hi|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: in open room the heart barrage by n/s identified the heart shortnes to west|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  well bid 4 hearts, thats good lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: Lauria cannot/willnot pass with this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Long pause then 4@S is not really the way to bid the hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S seems a bit risky on those values.|pg||
nt|tomi2: he fount out, that he was kind of off-shape, and tried to reapir this, but this does not work, because with extra points he would bid like this as well|pg||
nt|tweety1: Fantoni hoped shorter @cs in pd's hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: well i know a balancing X can be less than 13 hcps ( with short @hs), but i really think he had no more bid|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: overbidding|pg||
nt|daman: it is not easy to beat 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: W feeling endplayed already|pg||
nt|daman: @D 10 is the key card|pg||
nt|daman: he  will play a @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would play 10@d asking pd not to play @D back|pg||
nt|daman: if he doesn't    they should make|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  YES - take @S Ace and play @H|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: cambiaghi apologize for his bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: franco saved him|pg||
nt|xenya: this one might not be easy|pg||
nt|irwinbo: he will now make it|pg||
nt|hedyg: actually the @c gave nothing, declarer would have played small @c to jack|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for sure - also more that one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Irwin :)|pg||
nt|varange: and then to not forget :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be OK after a jump shift but West has not really suggested full slam values, just because he bid 3@S.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D does not help Giubilo one bit|pg||
nt|lestergold: still hard here how does west know that Lauria hasnt got two small hearts now?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: at least South turned up with 3 nice @H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Right defence means 500|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hedyg: if i had another @H i would play it|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: so 2 @H was nf?|pg||
nt|me argent: indeed|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: indeed - and here it will be difficult to get a @C ruff|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: West correctly assumes that East must have a heart control for his strong bidding with nothing in trumps.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 4@S denied a red cue bid (I assume it did), 5@D should also promise a heart control|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: without club lead declarer can afford to bang down club ace before leading up to it to cater for the KC stiff|pg||
nt|xenya: not clear what happened -- any ideas?|pg||
nt|daman: not many entries for plays in the minors     @D to the 9 now would work|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even 1 NT is no sure winner|pg||
nt|henryb: even my mother could take nine tricks after the opening lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wilkinsona:  has east not shown 5 diamonds 4clubs and 3 spades, perhaps|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe playing a spade, that looks like e had a doubleton would be a good idea, in case his partner did not open 2@H and tell opps he had no 4 spades|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: same diff|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is the moment|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, why not go down in game when you can't make a partscore? Costs nothing...|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|daman: he is still OK|pg||
nt|daman: win the @S and play the @D Q|pg||
nt|hedyg: @ss and @ds could both be 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: does she play bridge?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: 1 IMP back here|pg||
nt|brolucius: With a singleton heart in dummy, South's signal should be suit-preference - not that it makes any difference here.|pg||
nt|robinswr: good lead and makes sense with clubs bottled up|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|varange: maybe some misunderstanding of what 2@d means|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not think he has said anything about club length it was just a cue|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Well defended, West|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 14 is their maximum Gio!|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT is 12.14|pg||
nt|varange: yes, but he has 4333|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, maximum only with 4333|pg||
nt|petergill: A low heart opening lead might have worked, but is not likely in the real world|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You find pairs, who lead smalle from a doubleton...!|pg||
nt|hedyg: he would like to play a @d to the 9|pg||
nt|henryb: not since about 1938|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphztg: y|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: pass or correct|pg||
nt|xenya: he chose a wrong plan it seems|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Simon :) you are the best!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Listen: We have 4 @H, 3 @C + 2 ACES - here in Denmark the total is 9|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but how do you know you have 4 hearts?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That combines 3-3 @H OR 3-3 @C - not so bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 2@C did, Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I think Lauria has shown 3154|pg||
nt|daman: hhhhhrrrrrrrrrmmmmmm|pg||
nt|hedyg: Q@D now?|pg||
nt|daman: unblock  yes|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: no choice really|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: you play A@H and @H ducked and then?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I puy my money on West|pg||
nt|hedyg: small @s|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  More @h|pg||
nt|hedyg: claiming?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: otherwise minimum|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: sry - push|pg||
nt|daman: if he was going to play the hand that was    he should have won the @S Ace and played the @D Queen|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc 1 @h on @D and cash A@S|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: He's not going to care if South has @DQxx|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|hedyg: only if you can see through the cards|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|xenya: you lose 2 hearts if they are 4-2 and 3 spades then|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now only 200|pg||
nt|othered1: I like that equation (4-3-3-3 with minimum)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this table is interesting to see the new style in bridge - Fantoni Nunes invention is 2 level open for any 5+cards 10/12|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot doublefinesse @S now|pg||
nt|hedyg: so must guess|pg||
nt|milton_se: that 3rd club seems to be a mistake|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Lanzarotti use many interesting gadget (1@H 1@S with or withour 4cards, jump in xfert for majors, 1M 3minor = limit 6in minor and 4cards in other major, etc.)|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: no director|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Angelini team quick out of the starting block|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Masselli will be relieved  to go only one down|pg||
nt|hedyg: new leader|pg||
nt|milton_se: still better to take 1st S finesse b4 the 3rd club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right, Krustjev is now playing|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: bad bid , bad played|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 2NT bid not deserve to make 3 NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this hand can be interesting|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not another 1NT ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Three 14-counts in a row|pg||
mb|1N!|an|9-11|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4H infran|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To whom belongs the 5-level?|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS play weak NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: weak NT (may be not vuln, o am not sure if they play weak Nt also vul)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Accurate bidding is so much easier when there is no director present.|pg||
nt|lestergold: this not quite as good a slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the open room E-W are in 4@SX|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is a very strong weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wasn't he the man with the shoe?|pg||
nt|tomi2: he pitched the "relatively" good club on @D instead od the bad heart?|pg||
nt|daman: well he knew he had a @H loser|pg||
nt|sharynr: 6C on a non diamond lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@S for E/W 8tricks in @H for N/S|pg||
nt|henryb: a slam! be hard to reach after 1N-X-4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: mini NT|pg||
mb|4D!|an|!h|nt|Walddk2: Looks like 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this colour that will not bea great success|pg||
nt|othered1: south too good for weak NT|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1@s dbl without @s|pg||
nt|tweety1: a 3 @h part score for Fantunes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S make 6@C |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@h limit raise + @c|pg||
nt|sharynr: actually even with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|henryb: harder after 1N-P-4 level|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you pass a mini NT with the W hand?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphztg: both of pairs|pg||
nt|hedyg: @H suit got lost|pg||
nt|hedyg: W could double 1@s and correct a @c bid by pd to @d|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: EO to play, NS defense|pg||
nt|brolucius: If declarer is in a high heart contract, the odds favour playing East for the @HQ after West's overcall.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt weak but can be also with 5 Major|pg||
nt|hedyg: 11-14 NT|pg||
nt|robinswr: with KQ of diamonds on sides lead doesn't matter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @D lead it is ok the same - @S over J in @d|pg||
nt|sharynr: right, I only saw that after my error|pg||
nt|bridge_one: having @H at disposition np|pg||
nt|henryb: I consider it close|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the disvantage to play texas is this|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice 4@H bid by E|pg||
mb|5H|nt|sharkey: Makes played by E - otherwise has to guess @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be the first swing board|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  but 5 hearts went -2 OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe trying to make 5 lost an extra trick|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the pass of north natural - strange playing weak nt|pg||
nt|milton_se: now already too high|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To throw a shoe is forbidden now|pg||
nt|petergill: EW heading towards 4@H, I think|pg||
nt|daman: he played the @S and @Ds wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: W bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: dbl?|pg||
nt|daman: -5 instead of + 10|pg||
nt|daman: I would pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not vuln 5@H need |pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H as in michaels here|pg||
nt|hedyg: showing @s and a minor ( i assume)|pg||
mb|5S|nt|hedyg: W is endplayed|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks normal to me, just maximum|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@C?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And once again, Fantunes seem to have had a defensive disaster ... although I guess 4@H is always there on a squeeze|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West is 14,9|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 5@H 4@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be Hedy - 4Nt woul be for minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: assume misguessed @S - finesse |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT is not as good as 4@H, as the cards lie. |pg||
nt|daman: double is aiming for a small target     partner already passed 1 @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes i think so|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can bid slam now with void in @H|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no aces for lorenzo|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@H too much without Aces|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: should pass?|pg||
nt|henryb: really? I would not be able to.|pg||
mb|6S|nt|lestergold: maybe dim lead took spade finesse? to pitch dim??|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  appears to be so|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no i 'm wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll take my 800 any day of the week|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like about 9 imps to angelinin|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: hope they get to 5@H as 4@H not too interesting...:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oups...!|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm|pg||
nt|hedyg: pd i opened 1@S!|pg||
nt|hedyg: pls lead my suit!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Plain sailing....|pg||
nt|hawe45:  13 tricks on a ruffing finesse in @C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh no..|pg||
nt|milton_se: mandatory trump lead|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H, 3@D or 3NT now? |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: If yoiu have to play something NS, 2@S looks OK on their cards |pg||
nt|me argent: 2nt?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: vulnarable the p bid 5@s - need 2 aces|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the point are 40 ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: ha ha|pg||
nt|petergill: Versace shows his club support|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C fixing the suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: W seam end playd from the start of hand :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: needed to grab the lead in dummy and finesse spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: auction in open was kamikazi|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  seems that north left a bit unsaid in the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14.7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=KQx+Axx+xx+AJ9xx|pg||
nt|othered1: strange for north to make a try opposite 11-14|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the rest cue ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: vs strong NT they play X to show a 5 card minor and a 4 card M, but vs weak NT i guess X is strength so maybe that is why W passed first|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: well im urprised on tehse values that e/w felt they could afford a slam investigation to 5 level|pg||
nt|hedyg: if  he played Q@s before @c and KJ are in N and @cs dont work he is down?|pg||
nt|milton_se: needs an optimistic mind :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no chance for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Angelini's 4@C next door is not easy to understand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: His hand has defence written all over it|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wilkinsona:  diamond lead, ruffing spade hook diamond pitch and led a club up allowing a ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very expensive foray that was|pg||
nt|brolucius: He did, but they play a strong 1@C, so South could not be that good.|pg||
nt|cuan: 4612|pg||
nt|petergill: and thus shows his singleton @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good bidding here|pg||
nt|hedyg: a high @D to show K@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: Angelini + 33|pg||
nt|robinswr: 4clubs should limit North's hand|pg||
nt|sharynr: will he try for 7|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Whar is East looking for here? I would stupidly bid 4 @s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4@H is tres tricky|pg||
nt|petergill: With 4513 and opening strength, perhaps West would Dbl 1@D|pg||
nt|petergill: and East knows that West would bid a 4513 like that|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: well he has not made it yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bidding 4 over 3 is almost always wrong|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer is possibly best off not trying to finesse for @HQ|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he will ruff the 2nd @D, cross to @SK then play @H3, in case South has a singleton heart honour|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona:  ..not so sure..|pg||
nt|irwinbo: a hheart was the best lead  hard for west except that he then doesn't lead away from an aq combination|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The only problem with that is that it starts to expose the spade losers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nunes gave away a ruff-sluff at this point in the OR|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I think whatever Sabatini plays, Versace is gonna make this|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, it's hard to defent when you know the contract is cold|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Probably his best chance is @S3, to try to tempt Versace into thinking he has a spade card ... but who could visualize that?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's a nice idea Bill|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: the correct contract could be 3NT or 5 @c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I guess it depends if West is allowed to rebid 1NT with a 1444 shape|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe they are allowed to rebid 1N with stiff @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good reason|pg||
nt|tweety1: being in red scared the grandmasters to bid 3 @h|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i don't know haw they play 4NT in this sequence - many use rkbw, other cue generic, other turbo|pg||
nt|robinswr: i use 4diamonds as rkc for clubs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@C isn't a closure - it is a bid - means: i make 6 with the cards you told me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: But I don't think Versace would believe him anyway|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: now he has|pg||
nt|othered1: Depending on what redouble means, I'm not sure that 3@C is intuitive either|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: not more that 6 tricks for defence|pg||
nt|petergill: but he might worry that on that line, @HA then spade though is bad for declarer, so perhaps cross to dummy in clubs?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in this sequence the fit in @C isn't sure - 4@d could be cue fixing @S|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think that's a bit better - if you are going to cross at all|pg||
mc|12|nt|varange: now the finesse|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might as well try a club. Why not?|pg||
nt|othered1: east's hand certainly looks defensive|pg||
nt|tweety1: so dbl 2 @s?  optional|pg||
nt|me argent: and norths looked like he owed partner one more bid|pg||
nt|othered1: He can make this, can't he, if he reads the @S position?|pg||
nt|me argent: but not knowing the ins and outs of the NS system hard to judge|pg||
nt|robinswr: if 4clubs limited hand, then south knows there's no grand|pg||
nt|henryb: N-S have an 1100 save|pg||

nt|bridge_one: another weak open two suit - we will se how they arrange this hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  now here is a slam hand..|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes oon a non dimaond lead|pg||
nt|henryb: a quasi-slam, anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however a junior that play with Lanzarotti is for sure a good player :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Very good declarer play!!!|pg||
nt|petergill: @HK in case North has @HQ and can give South a club ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: Great hands, these|pg||
nt|daman: if they make it all the way to slam they will be disappointed|pg||
nt|tomi2: is there no "Lavazza" team in this competition?|pg||
nt|othered1: Pushing the board, if not the declaring position|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C after initial 2@h is forcing |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Well played OK, but itÂ´s by far not the most difficult squeeze, Versace has played|pg||
nt|tejjyid: more of a warmup|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: a very good 6D here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  a couple of diamond cue bids along the way|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|robinswr: if south wants to pass 4clubs, then that would be ok with north|pg||
nt|othered1: This  might come back to west at 4@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: we'll wait for a hexagon squeeze later|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Nice game in OR|pg||
nt|tweety1: good|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  Lauria played carefully just to lose 2 clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w did wll to bid game here- finding a perfect fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West passed, and East had an interesting three-suited 2@C opening available next door|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass - italian style|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also foe E/W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: weak Nt in all vuln|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@C suction?|pg||
nt|varange: look slike it|pg||
nt|othered1: east will get them to  4@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it is a rule in italian bridge - overall in IMP competition, don't search complicated bid to play or not play game|pg||
nt|othered1: no, north didn't try a 2-suited bid, settled for only one on his 3-count|pg||
nt|robinswr: if i was going to bid, i would bid Michaels|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You'd  only get one of those playing six-handed?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lestergold: well good enuf for roland on the grounds that chances of them getting away with a slam is better than 12.85%|pg||
nt|milton_se: or trash|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: the SDAM theory again - Six Diamonds Always Makes :)|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@c strong or natural?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Natural|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: nat|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  first diamond bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: e4spwecially if they splinter a diamond void instead of a heart void|pg||
nt|bridge_one: interesting convention - 2x over 1nt = x+1 suit or x+2/x+3 two suit hand - ungherese convention|pg||
nt|bridge_one: suction - corect|pg||
nt|bridge_one: correct|pg||
nt|othered1: so I assume 2@H is choice of major promising @D fit,if that's what north has|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@h means @D fit|pg||
nt|othered1: this does give opponents lots of information about both hands, if it can be of use|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I thought so too Bill, but no, all it needs is 6 suits|pg||
nt|bjacobs: lol|pg||
mb|1H!|an|!s|nt|Walddk2: 2@D relay, 2@H singleton spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: likely to be bid here also now|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s shows 6-5, not strong|pg||
nt|sharynr: me too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S are ON, 3@s down with correct counterplay|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: the safe contract, but @hA is on side, so the problem is to find 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS system : http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fiori_Napoletano.txt|pg||
nt|xenya: finding a fit in a minor after 1N opening is often a problem|pg||
nt|xenya: an exercise in slam bidding -- shouldn't be too difficult|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's a double guard squeeze, for those who are curious|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but you will need to look it up for more details|pg||
nt|hedyg: polish type 1 @c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H xfert, of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H= 4+ @ss|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Italy/angelini-sementa.pdf  I believe this is the card Angelini plays with Versace too|pg||
nt|henryb: why 3@d and not two?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's their NT opener?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 15-17|pg||
nt|othered1: west doesn't have a 1N opener, regardless of range, playing with someone who can bid as well as east|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i see Giubilo doesnt open 1NT with 5/4 in the blacks|pg||
nt|hedyg: wish i knew what 2@c is|pg||
nt|hedyg: E knows he has too many hcps in minors|pg||
nt|robinswr: is 2hearts forcing?|pg||
nt|sharynr: if not for the bad club break, we would have back to back @c slams|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm all  |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: @D lead would be good if S showed @ds|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s = 4 card fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: and 2 @s|pg||
nt|petergill: I think it's good to see the world's best players (EW here, and NS at the other table) outplaying the commentators who can see 52 cards to their 26|pg||
nt|me argent: and with the friendly@Cs just a question of overtricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: two suit hand (overall in majors) better give the information about the distribution (my opinion)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sure is forcing|pg||
nt|othered1: given some room, EW could find 6@C, not good here|pg||
nt|sharynr: want to be there though :)|pg||
nt|othered1: but a fair contract (needing stiff @CJ or 2-2 break)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Most of us specs should stick to taking finesses ...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I remember an opponent claimed on a compoiund squeeze against me once|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: sry 1 NT= 13-16 then?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i bid 3@s with S cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @S beat|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  lead inhibitor|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Henry seems we have more commentators than specs hwere|pg||
nt|tomi2: but he has Qx support and AAK, isnt this worth some kind of slamtry?  maybe the problem is to show his partner if he supports hearts or spades, so he chose the "easy" way|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@C is useless, no?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: We had a pentagon in a grand slam on vugraph not so long ago|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Some sort of military coup?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Compound rather|pg||
nt|bjacobs: military compound, oh I see|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally they use 1@s with 3 cards and strong bal |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 12-14 4 @s support|pg||
nt|bridge_one: same that 1@C 1@s ; 2@s|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ralfwil: agree vladimir, but 3nt from S gave no options|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In the northern part of Europe, you are NOT allowed to pass a hand like EastÂ´s|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: at least 5-4 minors short in @s ga,e try or more|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: more east to find 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the rest of the world neither|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 9 tricks easy|pg||
nt|milton_se: now they can't miss it|pg||
nt|hedyg: Simon can you help us?|pg||
nt|hedyg: opposite 2 singletons|pg||
nt|bridge_one: easy stop|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: 11 tricks appear possible if defenders fail to draw some trumps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C may be some sort of ask - 2@S maximum?|pg||
nt|othered1: well fittijng hands, with no unsupported Q or J.  HCPs don't do these hands justice|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: here i'm|pg||
nt|hedyg: spec suggests 2@c= xfer to 2@d except if pd has 15+ or 6 @cs|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: exact|pg||

nt|bjacobs: We have to pray that one of them will do something really dumb.  Not likely, I suppose|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Board 19: A spec gives me the mood to ask, what if South duck simply with the @H QUEEN?|pg||
nt|tomi2: depending on partnes quality in spades, if he had AKQJx it wd be an unsefull discard|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N and 3@D?  |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: wait ed|pg||
nt|tweety1: hard to beat this|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2nt : various support in @s|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3@d max of fantunes level one opening|pg||
nt|me argent: in the italian style all 2nt bids seem artifical promising some sort of support|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: usually it's just limit raise with 4 cards support|pg||
nt|sharynr: surprised no one bid NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it took the director about 10 minutes to explain it to us|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|xenya: well if N had the @HK instead of the @SK...  |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 7 is cash|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bridge_one: for lauria it is clear that opps have @s - so the bid of 1@H can be only from 6 cards|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 x @H is a good start for the defence|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: he can ruff 1 @h and 1 @d for 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|milton_se: depends on the meaning of 2S -- if it denies H stopper, or just 2nd suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: well a push |pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 2@S=4@S, 5@C, 14-15 hcp|pg||
nt|othered1: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: more likely|pg||
nt|hedyg: 11 with QJ@D dropping|pg||

nt|hedyg: can pull AK @S first|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Are you SURE?!?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - @S lead help|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|irwinbo: east is squeezed isn't he|pg||
nt|hedyg: attitude leads? or 3/5? or Slawinsky?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: attitude|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|irwinbo: east is squeezed isn't he|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: @h now|pg||
nt|hedyg: so is dummy soon|pg||
nt|bridge_one: automatic squeeze vs East, true Irwin|pg||

nt|hedyg: now can play A@S and @c|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hawe45:  then|pg||
pc|cT|nt|othered1: overcall makes sure that west won't go wrong in entry to hand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|henryb: His counterpart showed 16+ with long clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lauria could discount his @HK and had already shown fair spades, so no reason to go on without a helpful card in partner's long suits.|pg||
nt|hedyg: but will ruff @cs :)|pg||

nt|lestergold: here is not so clearcut|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid 3@s over that or forcing 3@D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: light dbl by Fantoni|pg||
nt|hedyg: S in 2@s in OR|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes Henry, in Italy more used DBL with good hand - different from USA school|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ralfwil: I use 2nt after 2@s as forcing|pg||

nt|yo_yo: mike do you remember  when we could now jump to 4@C to show this hand?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice if you can bid 3@c natural and forcing here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Lauria love to play natural - so 1@D is 4cards, not @h :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: oh well got there so push|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant remember the name of the convention, sharples?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2! ask|pg||
nt|othered1: or any bid (2@S?) to turn auction forcing and looking for minors|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: cause 2@h is @h or something artifical|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ask|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easy bidding, fast play|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This auction is almost automatic|pg||
nt|hedyg: why 1@d?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I must admit, that I dont know their systems and the meaningof this action|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: maybe there's 18-20 bal in their system|pg||
nt|hedyg: i thought NS play 5 card major|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i hope to know more after the auciotn|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: auction|pg||
nt|tomi2: with 18 bal opposite a positive 1nt i would bid easy 3nt, why telling opps too much about this hand. but then again, they maybe need some space to discover their heart fit etc.|pg||
nt|daman: better minor?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: No squeeze|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: he'll be pleased to see Qxx|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, acccurate bidding & play & defense so far here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|wilkinsona:  well south can upvalue now with the heart bid on the right|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3nt was alerted|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N looks like a sensible alternative. Also 11 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i bet this hyand wont produce a swing|pg||
nt|hedyg: there it is|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl by North means 15+|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially opposite a passed pd i like 1 @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: my pards always leap around in my kx suit |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: good point|pg||
nt|sharkey: also assume opening Multi VUL promise a decent suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure if that was Sharples, but then I never played it, so I don't know, really|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @C is good, either @H Ace in North - or two @H-ruffs will make it a winner|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure how they got there|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The Law of Total Tricks tells South not to try to bid something over 5@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And North for that matter|pg||
nt|hedyg: yours too?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 2@H means 16+ (about)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: amazing stop here, how did they manage that?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 16 IMPs on board 4|pg||
nt|petergill: NS can make 4@S, or 5@S from the South side (no @D ruff), I think|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: the lead was a@h|pg||
nt|petergill: so the 5@C save is sound|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: versace claim|pg||
nt|me argent: fantoni will have his work cut out 4 him here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: so we will assume it showed @ss|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3nt 5@s and 3@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brolucius: @SQ-x-x was not enough for North to bid 3NT on his own, so he bids the hearts one more time. (Particularly as the opening bid promised only four cards).|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  maybe 12 tricks..|pg||
nt|henryb: have you started drinking already?|pg||
nt|daman: now this is interesting|pg||
nt|tomi2: aq6 is not better than aq9 ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1nt ; 10-11 with one 5 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  The wrong hand is playing here - most of us bid 2 NT as East - after pdÂ´s 2 @C|pg||
nt|xenya: not clear|pg||
nt|xenya: they might regret that|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like 9 tricks if he continues @S or not|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With West as declarer, 3 NT has problems|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3nt like a xfert - In Italy we have hight invention :)|pg||
nt|irwinbo: nice lie of the cards  making 5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so presumably 3S would relay to 3N, either to play or to show a minor-oriented slammish hand?|pg||
nt|hedyg: very few top players play 3 NT as natural nowadays|pg||
nt|brolucius: Who, me?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Lauria u reckon gonna go to bed with one of  his bullets?|pg||
nt|henryb: No, Tony|pg||
nt|brolucius: Does he have a problem too?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would too if I lived in the Land of Whisky|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|daman: D'Avossa will add to their lead after this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: this, however , is played from many pair in the word - it is a part of puppet|pg||
nt|hedyg: notice the modest 1@s bid with 10 hcps|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes and Henry always tells me to get a new pard|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: that is why I thought he might have:)|pg||
nt|othered1: assuming you can pick up trumps|pg||
nt|bridge_one: before down with @h lead - ruff, A in @S and @s - after can make J in @C - a kibitz observe this|pg||
nt|sharynr: right you are Giorgio...a kibitzer pointed that out to me|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wilkinsona:  maybe not, then|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need 1@S because dbl can be weak, with only distributions value|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: knocking out pd's entry..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - lay-down in both positions|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H showed  4 cards or maximum, 2@s relay, 3@c showed 4-4 @H+@c|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: 3@d probably asked about strength, 3@H mini|pg||
nt|hedyg: so closed in 3NT|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|milton_se: well played|pg||
nt|hedyg: still i know nobody else who bid just 1 @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 or 11 tricks for Giubilo|pg||
nt|henryb: I think unlimited overcalls and proper shape takeout doubles work well|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some don't. ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 1 @H overcall would have gotten them there too|pg||
nt|henryb: for sure|pg||
nt|henryb: even if Lauria only raised to 2@h|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: yes Hedy|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphztg: easy board|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: no reason to think slam opposite a minimum hand with @hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@D?|pg||
nt|othered1: nothing too easy for east|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i prefere 1@h because after 3@D by opps i must pass (to bid 3@h with a suit so weak can be dangerous)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hawe45:  But why not take the @S-tricks first?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer draws trumps immediately, hoping to educate his partner (who ran into so many ruffs last time he played a heart contract).|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  diamond now, then ruff out the club Q|pg||
nt|henryb: He might hold himself to 10|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because he wanted the entries for two heart finesses|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: is this for real?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as long as W has 3+ diamonds this is cold i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: he needed to play @s from dummy twice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why?|pg||
nt|hedyg: will only make 10 tricks now i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do you mean hearts?|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry yes @H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: distraction dy declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: misclick|pg||
nt|lestergold: club q has gone which malt are you on?|pg||
nt|othered1: That looks best|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if pitching @S m ight not have been better.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K @D and @h now|pg||
nt|othered1: that|pg||
nt|othered1: is a great reading.  Not sure it's clear at the table|pg||
nt|milton_se: not working though -- S shift and D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|irwinbo: he should have won the third spade in dummy and led a heart|pg||
nt|bridge_one: try 10 in @D down - @D 3/3 near to be impossible - must take the chance to leave the @D at opps that will take in @h|pg||
nt|hedyg: @s shift and 10@d|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bridge_one: i thought only at 6 :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Naturally|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|me argent: DOOMED|pg||
nt|robinswr: turns out that 8 or 9 of spades  would have been better lead|pg||
nt|sharynr: and the question is would DBL have asked for a @H lead?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but opps vulnerable help a slow auction, so Dbl not so bad|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: but playing that way risks going down in cold contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless i am crazy, always a live possibility|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hedyg: this is called relay stayman, was popular when Lauria first started playing bridge|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bridge_one: A in @c, @C ruff and @d - the contract is sure with @D 3/3 or 4@D in West |pg||

nt|lestergold: glenfidditch?|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes |pg||
nt|othered1: at least it was quick|pg||
nt|tweety1: but still no blood:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: Ruffing our @CQ does not help a lot as long as the 9 is higher than the 8. I think they play by that rule in Italy|pg||

pc|d2|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 3@C = 5@D+5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: @s and @d|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If they can bid 5@S by South, Peter, I reckon I can beat it ... I'll find the "obvious" low club lead from West|pg||
nt|robinswr: why would double be lead directing. you overcalled and is void in clubs. maybe partner just has clubs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: game at 5 in minors for N/S|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphztg: in 3 position i prefer to open 1nt |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: with that cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT is a transfer to 3@C, I am told.|pg||
nt|henryb: we need something to fill the boring hands, so we pick on careless comments|pg||
nt|hedyg: well that 1@d opening was not a good idea|pg||
nt|tejjyid: erk, I hate overcalling 2@C on that|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: e/w did well to bid and make 3N in open rather lucky contract needing more favourable positions thatn I ever get|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1 spade is dbl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Toys R USeless|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it is the gheste with exclusion of suit - so 3@C deny @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: whatever it means|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Aggressive raise by Angelini opposite 13-15|pg||
nt|bridge_one: terrible shift of @h in this hand|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@s in my book. You have nine trumps, get to three level|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably 3Nt now by Intonti|pg||
mb|3N|nt|doncapone1: pa  noapte  buna|pg||
nt|lml: good bid by East giving west a choice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now Clair has revealed the diamond position|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1S clear with that hand regardless of toybox|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would he have done if the response had been 2@S?|pg||
nt|othered1: quite a difference in judgement between rooms over the 1N opening|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We would all bid 2 @C - or? (As North)|pg||
nt|petergill: The Law of Total Tricks is notoriously inaccurate at the FIVE level, according to the theory in the latest books|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No 1NT opening?  What's he got against this 14 count?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but can also tkw the decision to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: always, also after 1red open|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So they might as well take the save in 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: An overcall to show both majors would have worked better here|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed -- EW can take a few tricks in @Hs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S is a transfer to 2NT, and 2NT a transfer to 3@C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 "C neither|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @C|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C must be a bad raise|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt that George|pg||
nt|henryb: or pass? opponents are vulnerable!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Y - with @S lead even @S6 % 5 enter into play|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will Lauria upgrade?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  for example north led a heart vs 3N OR, might not here|pg||
nt|lestergold: if west is now limited to a weak nt then east hasnt got a raise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To sign off in clubs or hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: in 2nt there are weak in @c,weak in @d and strong hands slam try|pg||
nt|othered1: Which @D opening, here or in OR?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North will surely bid again|pg||
nt|hedyg: i like 2@c by a passed hand, would certainly bid it|pg||
nt|tweety1: 1 nt =? |pg||
nt|hawe45:  14,7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's got to be a good 14, does it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: here :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS may catch this|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I prefer - in a natural system - to opoen the East-hand with 1 @C|pg||
nt|varange: bid 2NT and pray?|pg||
nt|varange: over a 2S reposnse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Haven't read 'em.  Don't intend to ...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: or not LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: running scores at http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirank.html|pg||
nt|lml: this one is pretty easy in either game|pg||
nt|xenya: i think 3N didn't seriously suggest a NT contract -- just a descriptive bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 8 or 9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with 6+ hearts or a balanced hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: excellen lead    ...... for..... declarer|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  good system it seems..|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: q642 not really good suit... |pg||
nt|Walddk2: He might have added a point or two for Versace's dummy play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 2@D rubinshol (@H)|pg||
nt|othered1: When the opponents are in a power auction, double is lead directing (or you have them beaten anyway)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: at least 4-4|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: if 5-4 @h longer than @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4+4+ in the majors Simon ? (2@d by Lauria)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I like being in 3 nt |pg||
nt|bridge_one: hard hand|pg||
nt|jcmax:  hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good afternoon to Sabine Auken|pg||
nt|bridge_one: e/w was very near to make 9triks in @S |pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Sabine :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello Sabine :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: good morning!|pg||
nt|jcmax:  what have I missed? :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: no X over 4@s, so 5@H?|pg||
nt|xenya: what is all that supposed to mean?|pg||
nt|milton_se: 2S seems optimistic|pg||
nt|xenya: and where will it get them?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cameo could have bid his hand better. Double must be wrong with a singleton heart|pg||
nt|varange: just forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bid a natural 2@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 14.7 is pretty good; the @D pips are v nice|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S 1@c and 1@d for E/W - i think this will be the result|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: 3@C pass 4@s - now no defence by N/S|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: should do better than 3 NT|pg||
nt|othered1: in a @C system, if I can open 2@C with east's hand, I"d consider it.  But not 1|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bad communication for the defence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On 21 you can beat even 4 @S - double dummy|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess the @C are ugly|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is an open book for declarer|pg||
nt|milton_se: any time|pg||
nt|petergill: Most top Italians do not overcall much on 5332 or 6322 shapes - too many losers|pg||
nt|daman: only 2 down|pg||
nt|hedyg: next swing|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@c or nat or weak with 3@s|pg||
nt|tomi2: this system does not work on these deals|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: oh well these guys dont believe in part scores|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol - or going after the VUL game bonus|pg||
nt|lestergold: going after the expected hert lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe spade lead now|pg||
nt|lml: he was showing his club values for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Simon :) what would we do without you!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i was born ready|pg||
nt|me argent: weak|pg||
nt|me argent: its EW catchall bid |pg||
nt|tweety1: 3rd seat?|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@S seems a friendlier spot, but weak NT does have advantages, including being much tougher to defend|pg||
nt|me argent: anything not falling into their 1 or 2 bids is opened 1nt|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ok - old garozzo convention|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|sharynr: so what would a negative double show then?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is weaker that dbl|pg||
nt|othered1: @H?|pg||
nt|robinswr: probably hearts|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Intonti is playing to make double finesse in @c - so 3@H 1@s 4@c 1@d are ON|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: i think this is going off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When South follows to three rounds of spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D   3@C  = major ask|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as if one had opened a natural 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c is better than 1@d, but "natural bidders" might get to 2@c after 1@d-P-P-balance|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|varange: yee haw|pg||
nt|hedyg: needed more than 2|pg||
nt|othered1: meanwhile, south hasn't made 1N yet|pg||
nt|blunotte11: deve trovare la settima presa|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|daman: well  North turned down the game try   South has no business bidding 4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And with screens...!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bridge_one: 5@C 4@h, will read 3@s, so impossible don't guess the @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now Versace needs to avoid a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: 50 per cent though -- any black lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: and West could have passed if it was appropriate from his hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me 2nt in this sequence is forcing and shows a 4-card support and @c control and 3@c the same without a @c control|pg||
nt|othered1: @C6 could be a threat|pg||
nt|hedyg: did N really bid X with 6 @hs? he must work this out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D Ace and a @d - the roof comes down|pg||
nt|hedyg: but if he plays A@D and @d ruff N discs 1 @s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Has no alternative, East|pg||
nt|othered1: Is that best defense there?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9@H could well be from doubleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: S passed 2@c X so likely has 4 @cs and 5 @d|pg||
nt|me argent: with the @C threat i predict west guesses @Ss|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: 2@H was a gutsy bid that deserved 5@H by N imo|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is why i said need to lead D 8|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|hedyg: @H was never bid in OR|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@H not vuln it was a good choise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with @S by West South could take a chance to make the contract with a end game against East|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: should even up the scores a bit|pg||
nt|othered1: but slightly less likely to sit Dbl with relative @H length.|pg||
nt|petergill: Wirgren and Lawrence's book was the book I had in mind. Something like: LoTT is very good at 2 and 3 levels, OK at 4 level but bad at 5 level, if I recall correctly|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bridge_one: so the counterplay was perfect|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@C and J@d|pg||
nt|tomi2: other table had even some cuebid sequence after their 2/1 bid|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: It is on the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hedy, in open room which overcall by west ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If South had passed at his second turn, I think 4@S would go down|pg||
nt|hedyg: E 2@c, S pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H could be same distribution but initing hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Walking on water ... but of course, his idea was to keep South out|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so, without the overcall, is East still playing @D that way?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: very well !|pg||
nt|varange: :)|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Can East ever have a 7-card suit for his 2S preempt? In that case West might consider playibg the Queen under the king|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: surely with K@D Manno would have played @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last time Fulvio missed a defence was Aug 7, 1993|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Without the overcall, he's probably declaring 1NT, so it works both ways|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In fact they missed the 600|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: spec asks what exactly did the 1 spade bid mean|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H seems clear to me. taking the save is not so clear. EW might have only 8 spades, and 3D did not necessarily show 5-5. S has defense and N has no shortness. also, it is not clear ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at all--to me, anyway--whether the pass over 4S is, or should be, forcing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 1@S Roland not so sure declarer can't read the same the hands - with 6@h with one+ honor few don't bid 2@h over 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|Walddk2: forcing? even thinking about it is an overbid|pg||
nt|irwinbo: when he draws trump, south's hand will count out|pg||
nt|hedyg: are you sure he missed it then?|pg||
nt|tomi2: probably both souths did not know if 3@S shows the weak hand type or some real 2/1 GF with support|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: apparently equivalent to a negative double but without holding 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: dbl without spades|pg||
nt|varange: you never know your luck in a big city :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the first set Angelini-Versace played with Fantunes|pg||
nt|jcmax:  But in reality would never have wonbd the SA at trick 1 with a 7-card suit but inserted the Jack instead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the lead and the acution say 3@s with honor in West|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: yes -Simon confirmed 2@S|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d6|nt|bridge_one: 2@H normally nf - otherwise Dbl and np|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have yet to see Lauria-Versace|pg||
nt|tejjyid: now the @SJ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S Jask|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Jack|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|hedyg: the early @s play killed his entry |pg||
nt|me argent: plays safe for 7 tricks making 9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|lml: thats a pretty good way to play it|pg||
nt|varange: the little 2@s on the prev brd brought another 6 imps|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|tejjyid: Ok, a suicide squeeze|pg||
nt|tejjyid: better for the newspaper columnists|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, that's a very cool squeeze he is playing ...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: SOuth won't cooperate|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He has 3 minners = no sgueeze|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he doesn't want to be written up |pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh right|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: sry Simon I interpreted your msg as "dbl" @S - i.e. 2...|pg||
nt|lestergold: luck in the club suit but sadly none in the heart suit|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bridge_one: small @s at 3th trick was excellent|pg||
nt|varange: amazing |pg||
pc|cA|nt|varange: Val Magra on the scoreboard now|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|brolucius: The support groups are warming up the stage before the main act comes on.|pg||
nt|henryb: If they play by US rules, we won't: both angelini and Giubilo have to play two sets|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's probably true, but the LoTT can still prevent you from making horrible errors, like on board 21|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: disc @H?|pg||
nt|othered1: east is presuming south has @C9|pg||
nt|daman: this auction is a clear demonstration of why bridge is a partnership game     you elect to include partner in the auction...he gives you his information....and you overrule him     ...|pg||
nt|daman: not the way the games is supposed to be played|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphztg: godd job by mario d'avossa|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: good|pg||
nt|daman: partnership morale becomes eroded when things like that happen|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hawe45:  Interesting board for the average player. First try the @d, tthe hope for @H Ace on-side|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hawe45:  then|pg||
nt|marlowepi: I think the case CAN be made for a forcing pass. Since S has reversed, NS have shown at least as much of a commitment to game as EW.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|hedyg: nf imo but the fact is that S did not double 4@s, so N might think about 5@H|pg||
nt|me argent: im wrong|pg||
mc|9|nt|lestergold: good shot the backward finesse playing south for the heart ten but no joy|pg||
nt|sharkey: 12 IMPs back|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i would bid 2C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes Hedy, alone :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poor defence in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spade to the ace and another. At least East could have ashed a top heart first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: cashed even|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, even on a spade continuation, where is the 9th trick?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South know the shortness in @D in North|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can caount 2 down with his hand|pg||
nt|othered1: so the third best hand opens 4th seat.|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has 11|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pearson points  what are those?|pg||
nt|hedyg: and 2 10s!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: normal hcp + spade length|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NO - the best of the three!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@h not 4 cards - |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, an ace, and 3-card support.  A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do|pg||
nt|daman: you do have teammates     no reason to be prima donnas|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: think positive!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|daman: right Simon|pg||
nt|bjacobs: How good are the Italians at sniffing out queens?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It looks like 5@D needs you to find @SQ|pg||
nt|tejjyid: pretty good here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South will be marked with the 6-4|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d by Versace, all pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S = @d|pg||
nt|jcmax:  I found it never mind :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  I DO hope, that South is NOT thinking of any bid but PASS|pg||
nt|hedyg: more imps to Angelini|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Right - but not with that hand...|pg||
nt|petergill: Lauria has a good hand, and South is hoping to be able to Dbl 4@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Versace is thinking of passing 3@C|pg||
nt|petergill: Would you?|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S by Lauria means GF hand with long @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s= mini both majors|pg||
mb|4D|nt|tweety1: this 2 'd seems rescued NS:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: @c @c and @c ruff|pg||
nt|me argent: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: pass because the chance to beat 4@s is hight with K in @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1nt relay - could pass witt not interesting hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT= 4 @s?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1nt 4@s, sry |pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Fabio :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North would bid also 2nt instead 3@d - giving 6 @D cards|pg||
nt|othered1: 4 just comes up short if they push|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South has done the right thing - I am sure|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Oh, East endplayed himself|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A in @H in North instead A in @d with K in @c (probably after 4@c) is down before to start|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am sure he would like to forget this deal|pg||
nt|daman: those 23 IMPs this set could be pushes     thenyou are down 21|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: I thought that was a Reese thing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Isn't 3@C more a long-suit try, not necessarily guaranteeing 4+ clubs?|pg||
nt|petergill: Me too - no - it could be a 3-4 fit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But he could do it over 5 @D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: QJx in @D and xx in @c - so 4@D obliged|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: East had a pretty clearcut pass of 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb: even so, why bid Stayman with North's 4-3-3-3 and extra values|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT is a better game, strangely on a 5-4 heart fit.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@d one 5 major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they play Blue Club, they can only have a 5-card major if maximum (15-16)|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho interesting point here is that 9 cold top tricks in 3n and 4H is only about a 50 percenter|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@h ask the major|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2nt...@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: complete duplication|pg||
nt|cuan: no, is thinking if play 4@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now he needs to hold the hand together - not totally trivial with hearts 4-0|pg||
nt|jcmax:  If East somehow could show shortness in clubs West would go amok|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So which system is it, Simon; did you ask?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer may attempt some sort of elimination play, to avoid the club finesse.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: like a roman club|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  yep elimni on after the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: and if it wasnt on he would have a fat chance of catchinmg Lauria napping|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would need to eliminate diamonds and exit on the third round of spades - not much of a chance.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  but th spade 9 is in play now is it not?|pg||
nt|othered1: 1.5 quick tricks, no aces, opposite a passed hand?  Not close to best|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, 1@S would have the same logic that 1@h 1@s (denie @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 1Nt will be played fron strong site|pg||
nt|hedyg: no system is perfect|pg||
nt|hedyg: and he already knew about @H fit so np|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but to play 1nt from right site help , ovrall in MP competition|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: he is on his way anyhow|pg||
nt|sybarra: cooperating cues |pg||
nt|bridge_one: i dont know 4Nt turbo, cue or kcbw|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Walddk2: It is not Roman Club for several reasons. 1NT shows 17-20 in RC, and opening 3-card suits is normal|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he was always playing in a major, either 4@H or 4@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: and always rightsided|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: That would be a huge compliment to Lauria's declarer play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many in Italy use cuebid after two previous cue in the line|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6b @H also makes for the matchpoint fans|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@h cue|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think they only play turbo if @c is trump|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 4@H/@S are cuebids|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, the question is genric cue or RKCBW|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i'll ask|pg||
nt|jcmax:  West has a perfect fitting minimum, which as far as I can see never came to light in the auction|pg||
mb|6D|nt|daman: so   would you reach when you are down 21?  noooooooo|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i say about 4NT - the rest are cue of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not that other let it through though|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: other leads*|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H promises 3 cards @H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@S is used like relay gf|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: CC says Turbo with @c trump|pg||
nt|jcmax:  The key here is really the singleton club opposite no wastage at all|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will be quick claim |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4Nt seam KCBW with answer 14 30|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3@s 6@d sgl @c|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 4nt rkcb|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Simon|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 5@c 1-4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bridge_one: can make this 4@s - but i think very difficult to find the line to win without see all cards|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hawe45:  Correct defence|pg||
nt|petergill: NS make 3@H, so going about -200 in 3@S is not so bad at IMPS|pg||
nt|petergill: If you think about it, Lauria could bid 3@H with various hands with three clubs in them, so 3@C in this auction will almost always be a 4+ card suit, but Passing 3@C without prior ...|pg||
nt|petergill: discussion that one is allowed to do so would be a big view to take. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: We can see Lauria has No Chance, but he's wondering how to use his scant entries to dummy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: now as long as they dont touch the @ds...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: even with a 5-card suit on the side|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@H asking for @D|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Irrelevant, the hand was lost in the other room|pg||
nt|milton_se: over now|pg||
nt|hedyg: great to have a tool to show 6@D AND singleton @c in 1 bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: thx Simon - i wasn't sure about the means of 3@S - me too use to give the one suit in @D with rest|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: 13 IMPs back...|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: declearer doesnt put his " heart|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: his 3 heart|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2 off|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  thanks viewgraph|pg||
nt|tomi2: expecting 6@H-2 will be a push is worse then beeing declarer in 6@H imo|pg||
nt|bridge_one: winning with A in @h, and after A @S, 4times @c ruffing with the Q@S, and @s for the K in @s in !N|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphztg: 4 hearts,1 diamond, 1 club |pg||
nt|othered1: how?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: this is tricky|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He will promote the @cÂ´s to be trumps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still looks tricky to me|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: 10-12 unbalanced|pg||
nt|othered1: How do you make 7 from west, where south can't lead @HQ?|pg||
nt|me argent: 5@Ds good spot|pg||
mb|1D|nt|me argent: 3nt also makes because of fortunate @C split|pg||
nt|tweety1: alsa 3n makesü|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however is usefull to play a system (over 1NT) where you can give the long one suit hand with the shortness|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: 3@C?|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed, it's an excellent 6@S|pg||

nt|hawe45:  1 @H - doÂ´nt ask about my opinion...!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 6 was a lucky push for Angelini when 5@D made in the other room after a spade lead to the jack|pg||
nt|hawe45:  16 top-tricks|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: 2@D  18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|varange: lucky in both rooms then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East's hand is the one you get regularly if you visit Mike's rubber bridge club in London|pg||
nt|petergill: How many @S will EW bid?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a pretty good slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d=@H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|varange: again a two-suiter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only Q@h lead help to make 7|pg||
nt|hedyg: a good 9 counts as 10 too|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@S needs a finesse which on the bidding might well fail|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It might make even with @SK offside?|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, better than a finesse|pg||
nt|jcmax:  DO EW not play weak jumps?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  this time it was the turn of the other team to catch a good OR result|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: don't you prefer dbl with N cards?|pg||
nt|hedyg: DD 6 @d|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@h : @h or a strong balanced hand|pg||
nt|petergill: as long as @H 4-3 for discards|pg||
nt|daman: this will make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - miscount|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would as East hav asked for Aces etc. 25 and partner opens|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hard to argue with that, but Lauria paid his entry fee, so I guess he wants to make as many bids as possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  His good right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, I bet Lauria did not pay his his entry fee|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Maybe he tries to hide the fact, that the other room is too slow|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Jeff Rubens wrote a funny article many years ago on this situation ... his theory was that East should fake a misunderstanding, to get doubled in 7NT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We would all bid 4 @H now as West|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: might bid NT now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a lot to be said for overcalling 2D for the lead, despite the dangers|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: both majors short in @c|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for m y club its got a ten in it i usually get complete yarboroughs|pg||
nt|othered1: movie seems to give them 7 at a point where 1H loser was unavoidable|pg||
nt|hedyg: N felt squeezed?|pg||
nt|milton_se: this is an extremely good 12 -- can East imagine it?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think they will stop at 6|pg||
nt|daman: probably +1|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only a discard on the @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think 2@H is ill-judged|pg||
nt|milton_se: all happy to pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East can't imagine, but west know this :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I have a feeling that the double here will help EW zero in on this hand.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: 3@C  asking for majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D at least one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C  I have both|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has nothing more than he promised when he opened 1@C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But entry-problems later on|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So on the diamond lead, you play 3 hearts to pitch the diamonds, ruff a diamond, and try the spade finesse ...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Right|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@h cue denies 1st or 2nd round control in @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: they can make that slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S give the cue in .. @C (sgl or void)|pg||
nt|hedyg: E can imagine and he has ways to ask|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: dbl shows 4@h at least|pg||
nt|tweety1: I agree withthe 3nt hbid here|pg||
nt|tweety1: anyone?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hedyg: on @H lead?|pg||
nt|lml: 6nt has 3 heart 3 spades 2 clubs and 4 diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best contract is 6 NT by East - extremely unlucky|pg||
nt|lml: maybe not|pg||
nt|xenya: but the defence will get 2 tricks earlier|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6nt is only on a squeeze, but N will return a @c to break it|pg||
nt|lml: I was just looking at that|pg||
nt|hedyg: unlikely N leads  @C vs 6NT? S did not double 3 @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: there is a good chance you will be on lead|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@s ask|pg||
nt|yo_yo: kokish  ?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2nt bal |pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have bid differently|pg||
nt|me argent: south took the practical route to game|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: intonti doesnt play|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: he claims his 9 tricks|pg||
nt|tweety1: hehe|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 6 more points in the majors suit in west - easy for east go to slam|pg||
nt|me argent: well done NEXT|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3diamonds should be choice of part scores not a game try|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: you might do it double dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And the auction has not been favourable for an overcall|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c-2@d-2@h = 4+h unbal  --> 2@s relay - 3@s = 4@h/5+@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty to spec|pg||
nt|othered1: Can west define where his high cards lie and not Kxxx, Kx,  Kxxxxx,  A|pg||
nt|othered1: absolutely.  Why should a single raise be worth a solo game try?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: now?|pg||
nt|lml: it does have to be played by east|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my experience the danger of such overcalls is greatly exaggerated when pd is a passed hand, we are NV, and RHO has not yet spooken|pg||
nt|sharynr: good lead|pg||
nt|jcmax:  South would have done extremely well suggestiing 3NT over 3H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@h is down with correct counterplay|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wilkinsona:  made in OR by simply playing towards the heart Q|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So spades mentioned for the first time at the 6-level!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 4 diamond minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 5nt choose the major|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, i might be on lead. but there is probably an equal chance that psrtner will be on lead if they bid a game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would rebid my @h over 3@c |pg||
nt|irwinbo: me too|pg||
nt|hedyg: with @s fit?|pg||
nt|hedyg: when do you show fit?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, bec @S fit work the same|pg||
nt|hedyg: you might be searching for a new pd|pg||
nt|bridge_one: find: Irwin :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|petergill: but after 3 @H's, you are in wrong hand to finesse, but still Ok in 6@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You can ruff a diamond fror the entry?|pg||
nt|petergill: a bit worried about 7-1 @D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, in that case, you have an alternative play - a low spade from the West hand.  As long as the @SK is not with the 4th heart, you will be ok|pg||
nt|petergill: cannot afford low spade after three @H's as then the defence might ruff one of your heart winners. |pg||
nt|jcmax:  But if N's 3H bid was forcing I guess he was hoping for more|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt easier|pg||
pc|c3|nt|wilkinsona:  right sided it seem, as a club lead from south...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Is it obvious this makes - or some choices to be made?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't matter with trumps 3-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leading towards @HQ seems best, but even if it loses, there are certain squeeze chances|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: if you play the @SA first and see the split West has to split spades when you lead to the queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Whatever the lead - both slams are doome to go down. A 3-years old monkey would find the @C-switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The opponents have not shown a fit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, it's a tight decision, but as we see, everything works|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Wake-up call|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Wise bid 7NT - actually 7@S might be in some difficulty on a heart lead|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lml: you can strip him and throw in on @CK|pg||
nt|xenya: well bid|pg||
nt|lml: he will have to lead a spade from the 10xx|pg||
nt|hedyg: after loosing A@H?|pg||
nt|lml: but that is completely hypothetical|pg||
nt|hedyg: no throwins in 12 LOL|pg||
nt|lml: oh sorry silly me|pg||
nt|irwinbo: llook at the bidding in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe @c discard better|pg||
nt|varange: he might have felt the need to show a suit before the bidding got too high, with the pass in West showing a wide range (0-7)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hawe45:  Then North ducks ONE @h-round|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This might bring in 12 tricks, playing the @dÂ´s from hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: he treated this hand as 25 balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: lauria prefer to bid a balanced hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And this way, he doesÂ´nt have to count the trumps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What's the delay?  N/S disputing the claim perhaps?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Smoking-time?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A cheap mistake from Sabbatini - gaining 6 by the -500|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, it still cost him 5 imps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And to be fair, it was Gullotta :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: also possible that 3NT would deny A@s|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Because he plays them better than most|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c puppet, 3@d 1 or 2 4 card majors|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: lead 4th|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think, that the two black doubletons are bad values - so never 25 for me|pg||
nt|bridge_one: me too would choise 3nt instead 3@s with two stop|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: pass over 5@c was a better hand than 5 @D |pg||
nt|bjacobs: It will be most interesting to see how Lauria plays irt|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|hedyg: only @s lead could save them|pg||
nt|cuan: 7@S or 6@S is quite the same|pg||
nt|petergill: Retaining @S2 and (after 3 hearts) playing for 2-2 spades (Ace and another) is much inferior and doesn't work|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: tell Lauria?|pg||
nt|jcmax:  If 3H was not forcing and just showed a minimum hand I definitely think bidding 3NT was at least worth a consideration|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure this is a make anymore|pg||
nt|hedyg: must lose 2 @H tricks now still|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|lml: this obviously has no play on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six flat boards out of 7 so far. Only the 9-IMP swing when E/W went for 800 in 4@S at the other table.|pg||
nt|lestergold: we are losing kibs at a rate of knots because of the dullness of the deals|pg||
nt|henryb: Would be a boring set at point-a board|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  yep even flattened the 3 club hand after a lively sequence|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Yes Ed, east know impossible to find A K K K - with this point the open was 1@D|pg||
nt|othered1: thanks.  I thought the range extended that high|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2nt = 2@h+ onesuiter or with spades min or max|pg||
nt|petergill: After 3 hearts, ruffing the diamond with @S10 to safeguard against 7-1 @d's looks wrong too |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: So it's either cross to hand with a low diamond ruff, or a low spade from dummy|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: I can't see anything better than a low heart now|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: me too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Playing on clubs is an illusion as you need to get rid of two hearts|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  at the other table declarer played the ace first it seems..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: revoke is the only chance:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: trabucchi has to discard|pg||
nt|milton_se: y|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hedyg: now he wants to claim, but..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt have his mobile-number...? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What did K&R say?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Best but it doesn't help|pg||
nt|xenya: so you would just pass, Roland, awaiting developments? Or you would be content to defend 2@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would certainly pass|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ouch|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: lol Ralf|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|sharkey: still works|pg||
nt|petergill: Turbo applies in their cue bid auctions, so bypassing 4NT meant an even number of keycards in East's hand|pg||
nt|petergill: With an odd number, East would bid 4NT over 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: I think West did a lot of cue bids in @H's to show AKQ |pg||
nt|bjacobs: 21 imps riding on this ... playing the @SA is possible (but I think inferior) and is unsuccessful|pg||
nt|petergill: Apparently EW play a sort of Turbo only when clubs are trumps|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he plans to ruff a @D with @S5, then should play @S10 next to discourage a cover|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Agree|pg||
nt|petergill: @SQ would be an error, as you do not want the spade covered|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In pratice, East MUST start with small @S to the Queen. North MIGHT have all 4 trumps.|pg||
nt|lestergold: we need an injection of humour wouldnt be fait to pick on Jockland again|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: sigh|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Bad luck Peter, he ruffed with the 6 not the 5 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, @S6 is better than @S5|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well!|pg||
nt|petergill: General Principle: Declarer should ALWAYS play the higher of equals unless he can see a reason not to, so @S6 is superior to @S5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in Nt declarer could arrange to lose 1 trick each color|pg||
nt|hedyg: now -2|pg||
nt|hedyg: play @s|pg||
mc|9|nt|xenya: the !Q play guards against 4 trumps with N|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Un-doubled anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody can double that|pg||
nt|ralfwil: pl´robably flat|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If South finds the cover, declarer will be on the horns of a very unusual dilemma|pg||
nt|cuan: on king, small|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now he has 3 plays!|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok it didnt go like this?|pg||
nt|jcmax:  well I believe theoretically declarer could discard 1 diamond on a high cub after ruffing a spade. cash DA the ruff a club, play a heart towards dummy's queen. Play a heart from dummy ducking in hand and endplaying W|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: friends at the table|pg||
nt|jcmax:  But who would play that way?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: so toilet ppause|pg||
nt|sybarra: while they all go throw up|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will asumme he ruffed 1 @s and disced 1 on Q@c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: well told Sabine :) your analysis are always deepth|pg||
nt|bridge_one: waiting i thx all people that tell me my english errors :) ty very much ! continue, please |pg||
nt|sybarra: so he only lost 1 ht?|pg||
nt|polpkeeper: w Lolli-Gentili 17-6 (6) --> 145-109|pg||
nt|jcmax:  No, actually I was wrong I just saw. East can ruff in with the precious H8 on the 4th round of clubs forcing declarer to overruf with the Jack and spoiling his beautiful plan :)|pg||
nt|polpkeeper: sorry|pg||

nt|marlowepi: on the first hand the D tap means you cant make 6S if E has Kxx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he endplayed himself instead of North|pg||
nt|milton_se: will still be endplayed|pg||

nt|othered1: Or could west not hold the @DK, still 13 tricks with major K's?|pg||

mb|1C|nt|sharkey: NS have a chance to regain |pg||

nt|vugraphztg: 7 cause i see cards|pg||
nt|petergill: These great Italian EW players are the superstars whom Meckwell and the Americans beat to win the World Championships this year|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H I think|pg||
nt|cuan: "Nightmare system" for Lanzarotti-Manno. 2@S = 9-12 with 6@S |pg||
nt|bjacobs: So that makes the Americans Super Duper stars?|pg||
nt|me argent: and a slam for EW|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N from east is best here|pg||
nt|tweety1: I take bets for slam|pg||
nt|robinswr: some would overcall 1spade|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass by Lauris again ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: he know 4+@C in North|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Can 4@S be defeated without @H lead?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 3@H was ok ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: It may be interesting for the declarer and defenders but not for aged BBO commentators.|pg||
nt|othered1: it was within the shapes he had shown.|pg||
nt|blunotte11: Qui ci puo' scappare il pareggio|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is interesting. I think it should make, also single dummy|pg||
nt|robinswr: they don't rebid 1nt with 4=3=3=3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@c i think balanced hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c=?|pg||

nt|lestergold: another roalnd slam here|pg||
nt|me argent: EW will bid this slam easy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S - who guess ?|pg||
nt|robinswr: so rather than overcall 1spade, he bids 2spades |pg||
nt|othered1: @CQ should look good to west on this auction, was east strongly implies @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  that 3 spades looks better than the 1 heart bid found in OR...|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed, Hans|pg||
nt|hedyg: strong @c, weak 1 @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I assume a club lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c any gf?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@S never weak balanced in the system|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: bal or nat gf|pg||
nt|Walddk8: At matchpoints Joey would get to 6NT by East and score a top|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: ty Gio , i have a pd already :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: north on lead non lub 12 tops better than 12.85 |pg||

nt|hedyg: no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hedy, difficult to say - they change frequently ... |pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: It's also right, since there's no chance of a ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: I like 100 percent cold contracts|pg||
nt|me argent: well maybe not easy but eventually EW will wind their way their|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s giving long @c is a clever bid|pg||
nt|othered1: good decision by west|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think 4@S makes on any lead but a heart|pg||
nt|lml: its not that great a slam, it needs a bit|pg||
nt|hedyg: easy on @D lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2nt positive|pg||
nt|petergill: Re-opening Dbl could be light, so better to go via 2NT|pg||
nt|petergill: to invite I think|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3@c minimum with the other major|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|varange: 3@h anyone?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not me, not even if 2@D is not game-forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@h|pg||
nt|varange: ditto|pg||
nt|lestergold: but of coyurse in reality another dull flat board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer will duck this|pg||
nt|hedyg: might get a @H switch|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 2@d = 8+?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 2 @H  spade support? |pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  doubling 4 diamonds was ok as well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even a double dummy low trump is not enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: it makes but surely not easy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem is: 2@S is forcing or not ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ask again|pg||
mb|3D|nt|xenya: yes, but it's not a bad slam|pg||
nt|lml: well if you chose to take the heart finesse it is less than 50-50|pg||
nt|lml: the heart finesse by itself is 50|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On a trump lead, itÂ´s rather bad|pg||
nt|bridge_one: OK :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c= nat or any 16+, 2@d = 8+|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, to many doubtful honors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Never mind, he has nothing sensible to play if he wins|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why let the opponents go down, if you can do it yourself|pg||
nt|tweety1: is 2 'c special or a sortta inverted?|pg||

nt|hedyg: now 2@H= @H + @c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, but also 5/4 and 12 hcp|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s is GF - otherwise 3@s directly over 2@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s would deny 8 hcps, np?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this 4@H means 6+5+ ( i think)|pg||
nt|hedyg: direct|pg||
nt|hedyg: Clair should pass|pg||
nt|hedyg: his hcps in @s and @d not good for his pd|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s over 2@c is inviting - so can have also 10 11bad - means not interest to know the hand of p|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I expect Fantunes to bid 6@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he would quite like a @S switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The problem is how to make it on the natural club lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: might lead @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: i know i would|pg||
nt|cuan: 2NT asks with good hand. 3@C = 4@H minimum, 3@H = limit|pg||
nt|hedyg: helpful lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Through 2@S, looks like one or the other was relaying|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think minimum balanced 2@h - but i don't know they system|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Adter you had East's hand on the previous deal, you now swap seats in Mike's club and get North's|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec says 13 tricks on minor suit squeeze|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  close match though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  overtricks may count...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poor partner |pg||
nt|Walddk2: So you always finesse his queen?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Declarer can get rid of a heart loser and ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: you need to get rid of 2 @s losers|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, indeed. Yawn....|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Less than 4 tricks = impossible|pg||
nt|jcmax:  It is pretty funny that this pair never seems to actually name the suits they hold :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the KEY is 2@d - relay GF after 1@C strong - weaker would bid different|pg||

mb|4S|nt|hedyg: cannot ruff on @d lead|pg||
nt|tweety1: a spect says|pg||

nt|sharkey: *Losing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No-one expects Pescara to win this match. You don't get many opportunities against these guys, so when you get one, like here, you simply must take advantage to stand any chance|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry, you are right |pg||
nt|hedyg: i thnk Totaro smokes a pipe, that can take a while|pg||

nt|milton_se: also trumps 3-2, pitching Hs on Ds|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm talking about the position he was in after playing @S to K|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after A K in @S know @S are 4/1 ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nunes will open 1@C, then let's see if Lanzarotti can bid clubs naturally|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Coffee-620/650 here|pg||
nt|hedyg: finally on the board|pg||
nt|me argent: 2@Cs?|pg||
nt|me argent: by east|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q in @C is agood card - i would try 3@S by West|pg||
nt|hedyg: lost their vote|pg||
nt|sybarra: (not that we want to be there)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|wilkinsona:  yes, and I fancy a x of 4 diamonds really|pg||
nt|sharkey: But taking the initial @H pitch on @C cud hardly lose at all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here declarer has to create one red trick extra - to make 4 @S|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: +3 |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: must be impossible slam to reach then R :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: last board|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fornaciari 7 imps down|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 620 would be a huge surprise :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: given the finesses,  just easy from this vantage point|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Over two days that's the second full slam swing perpetrated by Fantunes.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S ON|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bridge_one: toilette Hedy (: bad break, but anytime need !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in Italy many use 1@C 2@C overcfall natural|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: Angelini + 73|pg||
nt|daman: this hand will not generate a swing for either side|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: score is ok now|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 8 boards|pg||
nt|othered1: I know players who would bid 3N on south hand (I wouldn't)|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would |pg||
nt|bjacobs: All right, as we expected, Gullotta DID get the play right in 5@HX on board 39 - score corrected|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But unless I have missed something, 2@S was in fact down 1 on 41?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and we got a new leader|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - in this set|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: hi didn't play the A@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: this may end up in a pityful 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: some play X= 5-7 here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: west in the OR  bid only 1@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@D much more difficult here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good idea. Passing to show 0-7 is too wide a range |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: now my k@d is a bad value|pg||
nt|hedyg: mine too :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even for E/W|pg||
nt|robinswr: bidders win passers lose|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s vuln is solid|pg||
nt|jcmax:  I wouldn't have minded terribly being in 6S on the previous hand. especially if they don't lead a club|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) especially!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: We have seen it before, 5@D is actually the best game|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 1 entry to hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That was first hurdle - better let South be declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Trabucchi bids again, they will get doubled in anything|pg||
nt|milton_se: but probably not after that doubtful 3S bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a proper sloam here all on a 2/2 break basically|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@c drury|pg||
nt|mdgraham: courageous pass by South.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: good choice|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Did we stop the one-way-ticket here?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c= 14  + 4 + @cs or 15+ balanced, f1|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Roland|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H = 4+@s|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: no double over 2@H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not more that 3@H for N/S here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 0-11|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: gazzilli|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: 1@H again canapé opening|pg||
nt|bridge_one: lucky, could lose a big game |pg||
nt|Walddk2: whack!|pg||
nt|hedyg: now showed the 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass - dbl - 3nt - i prefere to pass - but in North i would bid 3@s after  pass pass  with 5/5|pg||
nt|othered1: Is it clear to pass as north, too?   If my partner wouldn't act as south, maybe north has to protect.|pg||
nt|robinswr: again bidders in|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3@s support|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm west didnt even give it a thought|pg||
nt|henryb: so a bad slam, Mike. 40%|pg||
nt|brolucius: Great fit for E/W. but a slam still needs a 2-2 trump break.|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but it should have been explored at least|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  another slam hand, what more do you want|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H= more @s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I doubt you have time for coffee|pg||
nt|hedyg: siiiiiiii|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@d relay 8+|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess west can look for slam here|pg||
nt|me argent: EW will end up in 4@Hs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|varange: there goes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S make easy 4@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so a little swing now|pg||
nt|milton_se: 5 or 6 imps?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Henry Bethe|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|robinswr: win|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I don't see what difference that makes, but you're the one at the table.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: one more double|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: How do you fancy a spade to the ace and @C9 return in 3NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: hand is limited to 16 since no 1 @c opening|pg||
nt|xenya: good prediction, Roland|pg||
nt|milton_se: he let them off the hook, but they were eager to take it anyway|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sticks or circles :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 800|pg||
nt|henryb: GM all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seams, that Lauria could settle for 620 here - everything well placed|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think the pass is a bit spineless - those balck pips would persuade me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: still, calling lauria spineless is a bit....wrong|pg||
nt|hawe45:  His unluck is, that partner has exactly what he can use|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He just needs spades 3-3, the heart finesse, clubs 3-2, and @CQ onside|pg||
nt|tejjyid: true, but his partner knows that - if lauria X's then his partner can offer an opinion|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Come on fellas, 4@S is a ridiculous contract|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Idoubt they can get to game here - but if West had Kxxxx @H|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no chance to bid game Bill, agreed|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as the cards lie, not possible to make 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, 1100 if he covers|pg||
nt|xenya: though why N should convert is not quite clear|pg||
nt|yo_yo: looks like NS will get some imps at last|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: Double dummy, I know, but 3NT can go down, 5@D can't|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT= no 6 cards @H. no 2nd suit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but still think East should T/O double 3@D, if he can|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure it is - with @S 4-2 and the @C Queen offside, itÂ´s expensive|pg||
pc|d2|nt|milton_se: 7|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@S wow!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bridge_one: 4@S no DBL ! :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: more dinner offers..|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With North as declarer, a lousy @D-lead kills the contract -|pg||
nt|hedyg: E must switch to @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @cA and a @d switch...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s is too passive|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Just guess the @H-suit, and you write 620|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now S has time to set up @h  after a correct guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no fantasy with that @s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot doublefinesse in @H, needs 2 entries for that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I normally say: If onlÃ¦y at least one of the opponentÂ´s hands is wide open (dummy) you should try to kill the contract|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think they can beat 4@S even with a bad guess because East will only get in once|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That East did NOT play @H, might signal having the King|pg||
nt|me argent: ahh finally right:)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s3|nt|othered1: prior to the 4 @S bid, what had east shown/denied in strength?|pg||
nt|varange: cheap round|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like " we are either too high or too low in 3 @s"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C lavinthal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if Lanzarotti cashes his other ace ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North know the partner could have points without @S - so can pass with a interesting hand - possible to have to play a game (also in @D)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: if he switches to @D after A@c it is down|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|varange: no such luck|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate as cards lie its 100% so it m,ay be a swing|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  thats at least 4/5 slam hands now|pg||
nt|othered1: @D, low @D isn't a bad start|pg||
nt|me argent: of course making 10 tricks does present a challenge|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 9 of @s?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  No - not right - declarer ducks the 10 - and guesses the @H|pg||
nt|brolucius: West would need a special trump asking bid, to ask North how many trumps he held.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did he not have 9 top tricks with @DKx on?|pg||
nt|hedyg: off the Schneider|pg||
nt|mdgraham: six boards left....|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|jcmax:  I like South's lead here. He hopes go get in with the SK and then get a ruff. Only here they have too many trumps though|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bridge_one: Lanzarotti can read doubleton in @H in South |pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: but as a kib notices S can duck a small @d|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it CAN be down|pg||
nt|xenya: double finesse in @H would be a normal play, but here declarer has only one entry to hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: but E can play J@D :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: shall i cash the 10 @c or not?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: major for N/S|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  sometimes the defence to 1 NT is cut and thrust stuff|pg||
nt|lestergold: ive been sipping diet lemon and lime juice all day|pg||
nt|varange: looks beautiful|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Tuscany - north of tuscany|pg||
nt|othered1: Interesting 5-level decision opposite a weak NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no pollution - never !|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: maybe dbl should show a good balanced hand and 3@C and 3@D show majors with clubs showing better hearts|pg||
nt|henryb: as I said; perfect vision|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2/1 @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Forza Italia|pg||
nt|lml: etc|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I had choosen 5@h. there must be majors on E|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then after some time when Angelini was on lead with @SA he played another club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strange|pg||
nt|othered1: Save will mke it a little closer or, maybe, a lot closer if they go to 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did declarer not ruff a club he might have asked himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: never thought declarer would ruff a @c loser?|pg||
nt|milton_se: nice win if 6H now :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i wrote 2/2 sry|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c is too high|pg||
nt|bridge_one: strong hand in East|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sharkey: even 4@H without @D ruffs looks like a lot of work|pg||
nt|lml: anyway West would not be shut out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This lead you must ruff with the @H Ace!!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: or the 8 :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To show who is the king|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and I had also stretched to 6@c. at least as a save|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think anybody would be impressed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lml: 6@C must have been a consideration by south and it is right on the hand of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=14026  Andrea Manno|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@c on a @H lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@c is ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@s was ON - so 4@h less one is a good result for N/S|pg||
nt|hedyg: -1? how?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H is carrying a reasonable principle too far. 11 loser hands should shut up unless prodded vehemently|pg||
nt|hedyg: by E ofc|pg||
nt|othered1: winning @H play -- I dont' see a real reason to play east for Q|pg||
nt|tweety1: okey okey|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess so|pg||
nt|tejjyid: natural-ish, anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: can he get out now at 54 ! |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i see -3 except for a miracle|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2down|pg||
nt|varange: wow|pg||
nt|petergill: Should be 110 or perhaps even 140|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Interisting @C-play here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: perhaps that 5yh &6th @D are worth a few extra HCP|pg||
nt|sporteye: the first pass didn't really happen|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, plus a few points for the declarer play |pg||
nt|bridge_one: i owuld bid 5 |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: will play for long @ss in S playing A@s first|pg||
nt|lml: but then again you don't know they are making 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, 6@H won the board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it's only a matter of by how much|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass by Fantoni i think 0 or 2+defensive tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl would be one defensive trick|pg||
nt|varange: Manno's 4H bid - very nice|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but i amn't sure in this sequence ...|pg||
nt|othered1: Not over yet.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is over because North is on lead against spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol Fabio|pg||
nt|othered1: Pushing *these* guys around isn't easy.|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs to lead @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, Lanzarotti is a seasoned customer|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: me too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 8 cards, my partner strong, 5@C with 8 cards need|pg||
nt|hedyg: to make 5@c you must finesse in @d|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: can ruff out @C 10 but short of entries...|pg||
nt|othered1: Lauria, of course, makes winning decision, only 4  imps away|pg||
nt|robinswr: you don't want to give up a trick defending 1nt and leading a 4-card suit could easily do that|pg||
nt|sporteye: contract surely is 3NT by Versace|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Are you looking at a different screen?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Easier to play than to bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT must have been a raise in @c|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they dont play...just claim...1 trick in each suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok all I have to go get on an airplane to return home from business trip,  cu all later today |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|othered1: seems inefficient to give the opponents and easy 3@C cue-bid|pg||
nt|milton_se: Nunes can't know the value of the Cs|pg||
nt|hedyg: really not a good contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes- anytime need to play the finesse playing bridge :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye Shirley, ty :)|pg||
nt|jcmax:  The diamonds can be set up with a finesse and 1 ruff. There are just enough entries in dummy to actually make 5C|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: if no @H lead only -1|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2down with @H lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona:  a transfer put the singleton diamond on lead in the other room|pg||
nt|lml: we used to call the 5 level the binsky level|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphztg: j @c?|pg||
nt|brolucius: The trouble with diet drinks is the disgusting artificial sweetener that they use. Why can't they just make some drinks which aren't sweet at all?|pg||
nt|robinswr: doesn't matter on this hand|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hedyg: why?|pg||
nt|xenya: by the sound of the auction 5@H has every chance i think|pg||
nt|varange: yes, think so|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 1 down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can ruff @d also - so ggod contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 2@ss and @H ruffing out @D does not work, must finesse|pg||
nt|jcmax:  the defence would probably take 2 rounds of spades against 5C and then switch to a heart|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ralfwil: but probably Linda. No @c tricks in the defence|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hawe45:  430 - next|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb: 110 after the lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Club lead was too hard to find, and @C switch not easy to find|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lml: there was an American player who seemd to always play 5 of a major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Give the young man in the South seat a lot of credit for this big result|pg||
nt|varange: -2 leading the SINGLETON heart, Hedy?|pg||
nt|othered1: Neatly played the strain with no ruffs out|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tweety1: correct = good for NS i mean:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: you would need Kx in @D for that|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wilkinsona:  looks like the same 9 tricks..|pg||
nt|sharkey: initial @D lead shud be 8 trick only - 2 ruffs and 3 aces|pg||
nt|brolucius: My favourite cocktail is 'Caipirinha, no azucar!'|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|lml: it was a reminder that wasnt usually a good spot|pg||
nt|hedyg: yessssssssssss Hugh LOL|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A in @h @H after K in @S and last @h|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: NS end up with a ruff for 110 to EW |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|brolucius: Sugar cane spirit and crushed limes.|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanwhile accurate defence form Lauria looks like beating 1N|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lml: souths problem is that 5@H might not make ot 6@H might make.  He doesn't know they landed in the goldilocks spot|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: Have to discuss something interesting while there is a 1NT contract going on in the background.|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Declarer then has to win, come to his hand with the CA, finesse in diamonds, ruff a diamond and get back to dummy with the CK.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|othered1: Funny how the 1N opening, instead of 1@S, put Ew into a guessing game based on general evaluation.|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d to hand, ruff @s, play @Hs and disc 1 @D from dummy to unblock the suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: in 4 @c no need to take the risk of the finesse|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: 7@c?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fair slam 6@C is|pg||
nt|lml: the 6@s slam down 1 was a push as predicted|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5 bds to go and 9 imps|pg||
nt|irwinbo: 6 clubs makes but can they get there|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think watching \Lauria defend double dummy is not background stuff fro me|pg||
nt|lestergold: its what Im here to enjoy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: would seam @h in the hand @S ruff and @D save in @h 2/2 - but the problem is @D 4/1 - so correct to play @d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4/0, sry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Diamonds must split; otherwise E-W would have bid again|pg||
nt|tomi2: is this the last segment of the semi finals?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|tomi2: 6 boards only, they really need a miracle now|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S looks good on EW cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  N/S has a good @H-contract here - game is possible |pg||
nt|xenya: some hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent grand slam, virtually impossible to bid|pg||
nt|daman: the fat lady is in the hallway doing her scales|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 miracle not enough|pg||
nt|daman: no pun intended|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs point out there was a show-up squeeze vs N after Q@H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hedy, in this auction East can have 3 @C cards - so 5@C is right to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: not a great slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 6 should be possible|pg||
nt|varange: angelini might now be wondering about his eyesight|pg||
nt|varange: 4@d? really?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My partner pre-empts with 4@C, not 4@D. You know the feeling?|pg||
nt|varange: :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hedyg: if W opens 1@c they might never bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would open the W hand|pg||
nt|milton_se: recognize that :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D is VERY wet|pg||
nt|varange: pure wuss|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i have the screen|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: lauria doesn't have it|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: it's the same|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Fast slam here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: if @D 4-0 then 7@S makes |pg||
nt|petergill: What will Versace open? Pass ... !|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 5-4 majors|pg||
nt|jcmax:  oh that is true, the diamond finesse is already the 11th trick :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: which doesnt work if S plays small @H ofcourse|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and can also have AK in @d |pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  Simon bids seven clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Neither N opened 1 NT...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H= 4cards|pg||
nt|me argent: 21SS = a weak raise|pg||
nt|me argent: 2@Ss|pg||
nt|othered1: Lauria chooses to get both suits into the auction at once.  |pg||
nt|robinswr: if 2clubs is michaels, i play it promises 5-5 or better |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: like landy|pg||
nt|robinswr: you could double 1club s and correct diamonds to hearts |pg||
mb|2H|nt|xenya: me too|pg||
nt|irwinbo: no but it does make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree - very little chace to make|pg||
nt|henryb: David only gets interested when the contract is doubled or at least a slam|pg||
nt|othered1: with @S not longer than @H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: How can slam ever be worse than a finesse?|pg||
nt|milton_se: "if pard has no major singelton 5D may be ebough"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poor judgement|pg||
nt|hedyg: all bid with the E hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1@d nat or 18-20  bal|pg||
nt|hedyg: okok i know 1@d can be singleton..|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5/4 is more usefull and frequently - i agree this use of 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i think so Ed|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hawe45:  A BIG 2 @H for my taste|pg||
nt|milton_se: no price for bravery, indeed|pg||
nt|varange: I wonder what Versace may be thinking now|pg||
nt|brolucius: What an exaggeration...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D instead dbl (with 4/3 in majors) because it is important to give the lead|pg||
nt|daman: in North America we have a saying...."It's not over until the fat lady sings...."|pg||
nt|othered1: East's hand qualifies as weak|pg||
nt|me argent: south went quietly|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 5/4 or 4/5 or 4/6 or 6/4 - not 5/5|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: North in the other room can't open 1NT as they play 12-14|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Roland - explains that :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I wouldn't open 1NT even if I could|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: not played|pg||
nt|othered1: wouldn't you?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a perennial question: 1@S or double?  I like 1@S myself, but it's a religious matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: but I think many would...|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is only in 8 card fit and knows it|pg||
nt|petergill: No @H preempt when he has a good hand for spades - even at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i pass|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The reason 1@S is good, because of this auction here - you can follow up with a double|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  Im with you there Roland|pg||
nt|sharkey: S shud be getting ambitious after pd's reverse|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: me too:)...|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: it's the truth, for me he's the n.1|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ah, this should be good. 2@S.|pg||
nt|henryb: not much, I think. At least the Abbott seems to play only games and slams|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: with E cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: me too|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: but i could be 18-20|pg||
nt|hedyg: and vs 5@c there is no need to play Q@H, if pd has the K@H small @h is fine too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H is 5+@S 4@H weak|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: looks like 2@hs and @s finesse|pg||
nt|henryb: I might well bid 3@c|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes - with this strength I prefer 1@S, but if I can only bid once then I am more inclined to X|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4-9 hcps|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharkey: they'll bid slam now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  4 diamonds a good bid there it seems|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No 620|pg||
nt|lml: still worth pushing them up one|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@d = balanced strong or weak in one major|pg||
nt|othered1: how so they overcall with 5-5?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: you need not only Q@D on side but @ds 3 3 and @c split|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - OR small @D now|pg||
nt|milton_se: pretty easy trump lead :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Trump-lead and we shalll see|pg||
nt|me argent: i certainly would NOT have been a passer with that south hand|pg||
nt|henryb: Of course I do not make off-shape TO doubles|pg||
nt|othered1: If I had a good-bad 2N or the like available, I'd compete.  If not, I'd stay out|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would lead 4th best|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl by Lauria = goos hand|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: is the abott based on roland?|pg||
nt|othered1: Better get @H into the action in time and maybe north can find the @HJ play|pg||
nt|hedyg: so you play 1@d..|pg||
nt|othered1: Versace, in OR, of course agreed with the bidders|pg||
nt|jcmax:  An enterprising S might have tried a "lead-directing" 1D over 1C and gotten his side to 3D|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sharkey: 4@H from N music to South's ears...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  ...so 7 clubs it is...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But if you double first, then it's back to you at 2@D, you are stuck with bidding 2@S|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not a great slam, true, but in the immortal words of Jerry Clerkin: "I've seen sicker dogs get well"|pg||
nt|petergill: 11 hands in a row declared by EW|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Iff oponents play @H, all depends on the @S-handling|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table - @D switch - spade to king, spade to ten and jack, claim soon after|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But one can hardly go wromg|pg||
nt|petergill: Run @S8, or spade to nine is the only losing option I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-loosers woÂ´nt disappear, @H-shift|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Might be no swing, Lauria takes 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: (So I take your point if the hand is weaker, you might consider doubling)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: unappealing|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphztg: heheeh|pg||
nt|daman: NS were robbed on this hand|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@C makes for a handsome payoff|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  maybe a play for 10 now..|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, a review of the latest Abbot book, in English Bridge, mentioned that 60% of the deals were slams. |pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: finesse that spade|pg||
nt|henryb: tote that barge?|pg||
nt|lestergold: will the great man get this right?|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok so 3 @hs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|petergill: Perhaps Lanzarotti was wondering about the passed hand jumping to 4@H, and thinking about partner having @SAK if declarer is 47 in majors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: In OR Fantoni-Nunes weren't close to bidding slam|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  thinking about it...|pg||
nt|robinswr: then my next lead is suit preferance|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|othered1: not a great hand for odd-even first discards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @C4 is OK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
nt|petergill: North is a passed hand so|pg||
nt|hedyg: on OR W also passed with the 8 card suit!|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Losing the partscore battle is just as expensive as not bidding a making non-vulnerable game|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: oh....|pg||
nt|henryb: he would, but he is dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only the @S-plan works|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: @SA is marked in South|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphztg: wrong minor|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  snatching defeat it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D can also make|pg||
nt|sharkey: he'll not finesse in @D...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c would ask for @H|pg||
nt|othered1: found it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they dont use this concept od lead-directing Sabine :) but i agree because they are also other advantege: opps think i have 5 cards,so can not call a easy 3Nt :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What's the problem? 13 easu tricks :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After the bidding - and the lead - South MUST have @S Ace|pg||
nt|me argent: its a bidders game at the 2 level|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think I look at texture of suits as well - great @S, poor @H, a weak hand, I might well bid @S|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: it is better than that i think. you don;t necessarily need 33 daimonds do you?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: easy even|pg||
nt|petergill: North has @CAK and !QJ = no @SA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can this be happening?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Such disrespect for the spot cards?|pg||
nt|petergill: Does dummy have @S4 or @S8 left? |pg||
nt|petergill: Simon?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Alternatively, does declarer still have @S3?|pg||
nt|robinswr: got to go now|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2D|pg||
nt|othered1: unlucky west has hidden @C10.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@D|pg||
nt|othered1: he can claim by pulling trumps, if he tries for more he needs the likely @D finesse|pg||
nt|tejjyid: in general I like X becasue you show 11 or 12 crds in your hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But not the 5th spade ...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona:  as you say Roland, no probs|pg||
nt|othered1: That changes things radically, so declarer now can just go about setting up @S for extra tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: for EO 1@d could be 18-20, so i cant pass with E cards|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes i play 1@d:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: why? you dont have game opposite 18-20|pg||
nt|hedyg: but maybe they cannot pass|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Played from the other side, might this have a different outcome?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT will easily make - without a @D-lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni could have made it, but he did not know that a diamond duck was right at trick 1|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2NT 4/4 majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: sad really|pg||

nt|bridge_one: but each pair paly different gadgets ... |pg||
nt|hawe45:  West seem to have a natural @C-lead|pg||
nt|henryb: One of the good reasons not to play J denies.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Indeed Peter, and it cost them a trick.  One of the most costly tricks in history|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Monte Carlo Bermuda Bowl Final Italy vs USA?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2NT??|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 even 8 now|pg||
nt|henryb: BORING. Seven tricks with the spade position|pg||
nt|henryb: eight even|pg||
nt|henryb: so he went one down?|pg||
nt|othered1: too high already, I think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, but witrh 6@C they are many that use rubishol to bid the suit ...|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Amazingly EW can actually win game in hearts here|pg||
nt|hedyg: and in @c|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: The previous hands may have influenced the bidding - boards 9 & 12|pg||
nt|xenya: doesn't 1@S shown number of controls?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1nt shows 4 controls|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c stayman|pg||
nt|hedyg: or more likely puppet|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so 10 tricks without J@D or 9@D lead|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Spain, italy, sweden, Britain,lastweek the Reisinger, unbelievable|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes both ON : 4@H and 5@c|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hedyg: so double was takeout|pg||
nt|ritong: even with it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: which is unlikely|pg||
nt|othered1: or with it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D J = 630 |pg||
nt|hedyg: he just plays small and suit blocks?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C means 1) natural 11/16 @h @c or any 16+|pg||
nt|petergill: Win @CQ or play low?|pg||
nt|petergill: low, then spade to king, then heart to queen?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Queen might keep the entries going to the long spade?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I do think he will start on the hearts, finessing West for the jack|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Queen helps West to find the @D-switch|pg||
nt|petergill: Is there some deceptive way to play clubs, to minimize the chance of the unwanted @D switch?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh I see - so nine, covered with 10, etc?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East shall NOT cover an eventual @C 9!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What should that help?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: he made|pg||
nt|henryb: okay|pg||

nt|me argent: fantones should get to this DOOMED 4@Ss|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i apologize!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Lauria hasn't missed a lead since 1969  .... so 40 years on we are lucky enough to see it|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe, we dont have their CC|pg||
nt|lml: I don't think so.  |pg||
nt|varange: what was that all about?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No comment|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3@h max|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@c checkback|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2nt : 3@h and max|pg||
nt|lestergold: back to 7 if switches|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: so Cameo thought it was a good idea to play in notrump when partner has three hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: should be 3 ctrols|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But who cares after that lead|pg||
nt|othered1: someone noticed :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think it makes little difference, if declarer plays West for @HJ, as he surely will|pg||
nt|othered1: On a very good day, you lose 2@C and 1@H.  On a bad day you go for more than 1, making the 36 percent game an inadequate target|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in IMP need to call this game|pg||
nt|sharynr: whatever the result is or could be, I think passing 1NT is not wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3 tens, i dont pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to mucch 10 and 44 to pass at 1Nt - it is a gambling pass ...|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|hedyg: N was sure he had @Cs|pg||
nt|hedyg: so both N and S didnt know|pg||
nt|bridge_one: takeout, but i think with 2+@S - can play 2@S Dbled|pg||
nt|lestergold: but indeed who would?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@h means  <7 . sgl @s 4+@h|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fiori_Napoletano.txt|pg||
nt|lml: I guess its possible |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: wait a moment, i'll ask|pg||
nt|milton_se: with a weak doubleton ...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and he was right :)|pg||
nt|henryb: It is not entirely clear to me how S makes 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharkey: may not make the next time Roland|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vincenzo: lol !|pg||
nt|hedyg: he had that, A= 2, K=1|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  but why not switch, partner cant have 3 hearts|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 3@c giving a weak support in @H and long @c in a limitated hand would work very well here|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: over strong @c they bid X to show 4+4+ Ms so he knows opps have @s fit|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|wilkinsona:  cant recall the occasion in 1969, perhaps you can remind us....|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|bjacobs: 3@C, 1@D, 3@S, 2@H|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They would not have played in NT if Versace had doubled 2@C, but I bet that Angelini did not lead one because there was no double|pg||

pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Not really, I was only 6 then|pg||

nt|brolucius: He could instead have taken a spade finesse, still OK if the finesse loses but spades are 3-3. I suppose his intention on this line was to finesse twice in diamonds if the first ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: finesse lost. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: Sabine Auken hate the Gazzilli convention :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bridge_one: to play the gazzilli !|pg||

nt|petergill: An advance sacrifice over the failing 4@H?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I quite like the convention where this redouble shows specifically honour-doubleton|pg||
nt|petergill: North needs to pass 4@S. |pg||
nt|othered1: You get there trivially if you can open south 1@S.  |pg||
nt|sharynr: there will be an awful lot of very thin games when these hands are opened |pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  slam time?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so one major or other type of strong hand, i think |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3nt  even aces|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: so 4@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@S better because you can sometimes discard a club on the 13th diamond.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: we (I) often think of the italians as being wild bidders, but look at how conservative they have been here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a strange rerun of our previous discussion - should West double 2@C or bid 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: they don't seem to use the 2@d as a game force checkback|pg||
nt|milton_se: over-aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like it Tony|pg||
nt|hedyg: no only 1 major over 1NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: depending on agreements - i prefere to play multi with only one major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All of a sudden Nunes can "see" the singleton heart in partner's hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S by Lauria introduce many type of hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Henry your good at percentages what would u say here|pg||
nt|henryb: Trabucchi now ahead three boards to one|pg||
nt|lestergold: dims 3/3u dont have to ind the club q and two way search is better than 50% normally because of the info that gets picked up |pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, 4@S would have made, I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: @D ruffs could make this costly|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I prefer 2@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if you can bid once, show support|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but he IS heavy for it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, it was another two-step|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  Strange to le the weak hand play!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  let|pg||
nt|henryb: 6@s is about 66%|pg||
nt|me argent: that was fast|pg||
nt|ritong: missing a key, then 6 only  pure|pg||
nt|othered1: @SK = A?|pg||
nt|tweety1: aces or Key Cards?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: k of trumps is an ace|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: so 2 aces|pg||
pc|s8|nt|wilkinsona:  thought it was just a mater of 6 or 7|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 4@c : 5@h and 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: at least|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  thanks, Simon|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: after 2@s bid|pg||
nt|lml: not crazy about that bidding structure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On a @S-lead, "itÂ´s NOW"|pg||
nt|othered1: That was easy and impressive.|pg||
nt|tweety1: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: i m sure you love this auction, joey|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Funny - at one table they play 3 @S - here the suit isÂ´nt evebn mentioned during the bidding|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphztg: 3@s : txs for 3nt|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: so 6S is probably better than 50% slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: after @s lead playing A@C is tuff, if KJx in E no more entry to hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my J from Jxx not a success|pg||
nt|ritong: he has no entry to hand no matter what,after @c A|pg||
nt|ritong: so the best is @c to the 9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does the encyclopedia say|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks best, and pray|pg||
nt|hedyg: must keep communications open|pg||
nt|othered1: Encyclopedia doesn't have entry problems|pg||
nt|ritong: a kind of table presence problem imo|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think, this is a guess. @CV 2-2 works - and then only single @C K also|pg||
nt|hedyg: encyclopedia says play 5@c......|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: @c from dummy?|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|varange: so we have now identified two bridge players who actually have a life: Sabine and Papi :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S can make 4@h, but E/W make 4@S !|pg||
nt|othered1: That was ineffective|pg||
nt|henryb: Well now, I think N-S can barely make 3@h|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps Versace cannot risk playing @D's until after clubs? |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ralfwil: Will make if S ruffs 2@d on the table before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: might require careful handling|pg||
nt|othered1: In OR, west doubled 1@H opening, and did have support for other suits|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4H down on a S lead|pg||
nt|ritong: "fond of the fast lane" you are|pg||
nt|me argent: for me hank simple is good|pg||
nt|ritong: sure enough|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: easy, fast and right bid...what else?|pg||
nt|ritong: next:)|pg||
nt|tweety1: fast and furious|pg||
pc|d2|nt|me argent: indeed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3nt no chance|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@s difficult but possible|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: lauria play 3nt...there's always a chanche|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ritong: @c to the Q wins stiff J|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The South hand does not have many entries. He may well play a club to the queen|pg||
nt|bridge_one: :) right Simon |pg||
nt|othered1: West's @C holding opposite a rebid suit, looks like it will provide many tricks.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  even|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's because of the double versus 2@D question|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: Somewhat lucky that Lauria does not have anything wasted in diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree with that double|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: is it clear to lead a heart? what about a club at trick 2?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West would try to give a constructive raise at 2@s - pass not the best|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud W cue 5@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: domani si riprende con il 2° tempo di semifinale alle 10.30|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: now the @d finess|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both suits (@S and @D) are placed in favor of declarer - who kan even afford to loose a @D-trick|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Ralf, that seems the best  plan|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps the only winning one|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Still 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: That's not safe|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW feeling confortable ahead probably see no reson to gamble here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  maybe north told him about the diamond situation|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe just the 2-bid's preemption working|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb: even better because you might not get a heart lead!|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rodal f: Lost some tempo now so max 11. Can become 10 and gain for Romania|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and will utter a silent curse|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe not so silent|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: why not @h to dummy and @c?|pg||
nt|othered1: against lesser opponents, @C guess might be easier to make|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: with this layout, the good move was cross to dummy with a @h, pplay a @c and duck the @c K|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brolucius: A 9-6 scoreline after 13 boards is not exactly a swingy set.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if duck 9 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|irwinbo: club would work|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well i wasnt asking about what works, but what is right|pg||
nt|bridge_one: great Roland ! perfect italian !|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
mc|11|nt|rodal f: Back at 11|pg||
nt|ralfwil: trumps is best from W, but doesn´t help|pg||
nt|hawe45:  13th @C now - East discarding a @D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: me? no|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, it all adds up to nought|pg||

nt|lestergold: not of  course a good one|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but agree entries difficult|pg||

nt|othered1: beating 4@S is non-trivial here, too.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I might make 9Â½ tricks in 4 @S|pg||
nt|othered1: ne3eded @C ruff to take trumps separately|pg||
nt|bridge_one: we must remember they are playing all day, so can be tired at this hour|pg||
nt|tejjyid: neat, hey|pg||
nt|bjacobs: just like this session, basically|pg||
nt|tejjyid: bidding, schmidding|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Another exciting deal!|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: well it was a normal distribution|pg||
nt|petergill: Unerring by West, as he can tell from Lauria's second Dbl that partner was likely to have @DA or @HA|pg||
mb|1H|nt|varange: and a handsome lead it is|pg||
nt|ritong: nice hands for the finish, anyway|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Might this make 3NT?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They do have 26 combined points|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, tough bid for LAuria|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 93 85 but in open must still play the hand where 5@c was ON|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: looks like 4@S should make|pg||
nt|tweety1: 2 @s|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|bridge_one: not more that 5@D for N/S|pg||
nt|othered1: not on @CA and another |pg||
nt|hawe45:  With the @C-ruff you defeat it|pg||
nt|hedyg: S thinking slam|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 1NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3@d any singleton GF|pg||
nt|hedyg: they already played that|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45:  But 140 will bring them close|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and that's what was led  A@C|pg||
nt|othered1: this has been played at a nice pace.|pg||
nt|me argent: 2nt by nunes?|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that will get them there I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: cost 7 imps|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hedyg: if they get there|pg||
nt|varange: but we can rely on Fantunes to find at least one slam in the next two boards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thumbs down on the 1n opening :(|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: but  N should have played the 8@d or 3@h|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: N should have help his p|pg||
nt|jcmax:  EW can make a grand slam in hearts here. The question is: would a diamond preempt by S have made it harder or easier to reach it?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@h asks where|pg||
mb|5D|nt|hedyg: no 5 level|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec says Roland grabnd slam i say too good for roland grand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now 4@C usually played as a splinter, so East must look elsewhere.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  nice when partner opens and you have 4 Aces|pg||
nt|lestergold: however back in the land of reality this should be a flat 6H plus one in both rooms|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: and 4 card support|pg||
nt|ritong: pass by north is not super brave|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd bid 2@S on south hand, but I don't know how fisky north can be at these colors|pg||
nt|petergill: are NS playing the Nightmare System?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think it's destined to make|pg||
nt|tejjyid: now maybe 3@H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: oh, yes (; i hoped they would must play !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 3@d don't work :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: He did - Lauria cud still have A or K |pg||
nt|ralfwil: even 4@h is too expensive - 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  800 - even shortly before Christmas|pg||
nt|marlowepi: substandard hearts and substandard spades for a 3H fit-jump, from a purist's perspective|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW not quite as active in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: Clair knows N is short in @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as most play, 2C in competition is not a GF, so then it would not be clear that this pass is forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: Franchi should have 4 @ss for his 3@H bid|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS may be shut out now...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Nt by North difficult to make 3Nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10.14 NT|pg||
nt|ritong: declined|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 7 @D correct|pg||
nt|rodal f: As u ain't Georgio with ure Duracel well placed some where:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  - if Souths bids on|pg||
nt|xenya: EW haven't discovered their true potential|pg||
nt|ralfwil: besides - I haven´t had a bid on N|pg||
nt|varange: I like the 1NT opening|pg||
nt|brolucius: Could just bid 6@H. I once had a partner who HATED leaps to the six-level. That made me do it even more often. |pg||
nt|henryb: another hand for fourth best!|pg||
nt|hedyg: now told him what to lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: typical with unbalanced hands|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think he can guess his partners singleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: but maybe not the 5 card fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass by Lauria over 5@d forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H asked where the singleton was|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 3down vuln - but E/W have slam - also the big|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe pass shows the singleton @c|pg||
mb|5H|nt|bridge_one: the previous pass hoping in DBL in North and trasform give a problem to bid now|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot give up on the vulnerable game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: south pass ... could try a open 1Nt - 12 hcp|pg||
nt|henryb: or at least long suit|pg||
nt|petergill: Lanzaroti and Buratti were a top pair playing Nightmare System who got banned for a couple of years for wrong-doing, and now that they have returned I think they are not allowed to ...|pg||
nt|petergill: partner each other, but I'm not sure. |pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@D with xxx in clubs?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: semi balanced: 7222, 6322 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The second double even more interesting|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most partnerships play that you are obliged to cue-bid the @DA on the West cards, even if you are minimum. With a second-round control you can sign off with a poor hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: I have a feeling that laria will have to steamroller this one to slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: For a flat board.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  this is probably enough negativity from west to avoid the making grand|pg||
nt|tweety1: maybe 3 @h shows @h values?|pg||
nt|ritong: these guys bid faster than my typing, unfair|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot bid slam  with xx in @d|pg||
mb|6H|nt|hedyg: oh!|pg||
nt|hedyg: so new leader again..|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is expensive|pg||
nt|xenya: for an instant i thought EW got them...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Angelini + 90 after 13 boards|pg||
nt|me argent: not best|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@h seam too much prudent|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  does this have a chance, ...seems it might..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure you can go down when you are in 3|pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps that was tough the way the bidding went|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Vlad, W was not able to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can support later if partner will act|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would not be content with defending 2@S when opps are vulnerable?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, no grand, so East's 4@S suggests that he is not yet willing to bid even 6@H. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Plenty of entries to East to play spades twice, and that's game, set and match|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or at least Game|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Isn't it only 2 down Giorgio? W doesn't have a trump to ruff a spade :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: finance crisis syndrome: not content with anything|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it could obviously go very wrong, but surely North had to double 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: better pass , so your p could bid rdbl|pg||
nt|tejjyid: textbook avoidance play|pg||
nt|hedyg: famous last words lol|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with void in @d !|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: of course, doubling 3@d can generate a disaster, on the other hand north can envisage a @c SLAM, so he must bid imho|pg||
nt|petergill: You can scroll down to Nightmare at http://www.bridgeguys.com/NGlossary/GlossN.html if you are a system fanatic|pg||
nt|tomi2: beeing told that 4@D shows problems in @C in their methods|pg||
nt|ritong: fantoni suspects this @d K to be short|pg||
nt|tweety1: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: thus, he might attack trumps from his hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 2@s by west :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: he did play the 4 and pitched the 5 at his first opportunity...is that not suit pref for @H|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: dont remember ed|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rocco47: 12 per Failla|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they play 2@c good hand - so 4@d is dangerous - better 3Nt or Dbl ?|pg||
nt|ritong: or not|pg||
nt|tweety1: any way to play trumps like for E|pg||
nt|tweety1: lucky|pg||
nt|othered1: doesn't have the luxury of going to dummy to start trumps.  This will give N a chance at a @C entry|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: N has to play the Q@c anyway|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right Sabine :) i saw only now !|pg||
pc|d3|nt|varange: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: Lauria will surely go now even if west 'signs off'|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: W has to give the k@s|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: now 5@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is a bit much on those moderate trumps. The @SK might be enough for West to bid 6@H, though.|pg||
nt|hedyg: why was a @H led in OR?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharkey: We've said that before...|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ritong: apparently fulvio estimates he can afford it|pg||
nt|othered1: I think so if they're carding lavinthal.|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 5@h showed shortness in @d, maybe else W would double|pg||

nt|brolucius: Ten tricks in hearts? You need a bundle of entries to the East hand to take the red-suit finesses.|pg||

nt|hedyg: to my excellent fellow commentators George Holland and Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|daman: thx Hedy and Tomas|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes, excellent!|pg||
nt|ritong: brave overcall with 5332|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The final segment starts in around 75 minutes I believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 6@S not easy to call|pg||
nt|Walddk8: 13 top tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: also because N didnt bid 5@d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 4@d help to evaluate the hand for the void in @D by Lauria|pg||
nt|othered1: Would you have bid as north? and will you sell below 7@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk8: If they really bid 6@S, North must take the save|pg||
nt|bridge_one: having Q10932 in @h pass isn't a bad choise|pg||
nt|Walddk8: They are not going to bid 7|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i want to say that now is easier to call without 5@d by N|pg||
nt|sharynr: i think passing 4D leaves the opps a chance to go wrong, but also leaves them too much room|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i study the system|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: so i can put what i like in mine:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: we also try to!|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: now there is a position to find 4@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: buona  cena Simon :)|pg||
nt|xenya: which is excellent|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S i meant|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i am more unlucky of you :) i must still study in my terrible job (:|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphztg: grazie,you too!|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty :)|pg||
nt|ritong: stole the pot  wd|pg||
nt|othered1: East doesn't get shut out often.|pg||
nt|sharynr: i would have bid at least 5, maybe 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: let's hope they land in 4@H NOW|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: surely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What's wrong with 6@C?|pg||
nt|lestergold: always hard to bid the 'par' of 5H here at these colours|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are overboard|pg||
nt|othered1: What was 2@D?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: well done Intonti|pg||
mb|4H|nt|henryb: 5@h is two down, Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: red Ks do not have to be favourably placed|pg||
nt|hedyg: as well as to the FOGB with Gianluca Frola and to Vincenzo delle Cave|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes   still brave inspite of 14 hp and good @h s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 2@s will show a good - at least 5-card - @s and a good hand|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm afraid that might not be too easy though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is right-sided|pg||
nt|yo_yo: looks as if this makes  |pg||
nt|hedyg: and of course thanks to Ed :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They are not the only ones|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lots of vugraph this weekend. Broadcasts from Scotland (Gold Cup finals) and Spain in progress, and in 30 minutes we are getting another one: Sweden|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry FIGB|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 45 minutes|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty all for joining, we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|bridge_one: xfert|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Does not promise hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i ask at the end of the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no txs|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: just 2@D losers|pg||
nt|bridge_one: slow approch by lauria|pg||
nt|bridge_one: AK in @C are great|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Spectators or blunders, Bill?|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: fantoni pushing hard in the bidding on brd 14|pg||
nt|xenya: nothing, really, 6@C is OK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@H playble|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: The Law of Total Tricks often breaks down at the four and five levels - 11 + 9 trumps but 9 + 10 total tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and also AJ in @h, so a try for seven now is correct|pg||
nt|othered1: Assuming the cue-bid is legit, west's hand is pretty good.|pg||
nt|stewball: hi everyone srry to be late..storms here|pg||
nt|hedyg: Sabine last hand you would have bid 3@s over 1@h showing a singleton somewhere? then pd would bid 3nT asking and you would bid 4@c?|pg||
nt|hedyg: ( i try to learn from Sabine )|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need the finesse in @d i suppose|pg||
nt|hedyg: in Sabine's system direct 4@c would be void i think|pg||
nt|jcmax:  you are a real expert Hedy. that is indeed the way we play!|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Sabine :) i try to do as Simon...copy what i like|pg||
nt|hedyg: and i surely like your stuff|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: learn and copy:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes!|pg||
nt|jcmax:  The problem is declarer doesn't know yet trumps are 4-1. So he may be reluctant taking the finesse that theoretically could lose|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think the finesse need - K in @d out need to much things to make the contract|pg||
nt|jcmax:  This is a very hard hand to declare. Declarer does well to take his time|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so the finese seam the best chance|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if K in @D out (in east) A in @C in West, the hand became impossible|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Which two diamond losers if I may ask|pg||
nt|milton_se: nothing wrong at all, but South can't see it|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3@s with N cards|pg||
nt|varange: but Nunes makes the slam-killer 3NT bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: You cannot finesse them both.|pg||
nt|po-s: has to take 11|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1nt are @s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Lots of specs, not surprising given the quality of the table|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: that's that|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi jhon :)|pg||
nt|stewball: i'm here in time for the last hand?:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may by 7 with Q of @s |pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would bid 7 now in west|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: not a flat board...|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk8: At least the play in 7 is easy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be 6@D by Lauria a little optimistic with Jxx in @C|pg||
nt|othered1: 7@S is one bad contract.  NO real credit for getting there|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the proble Ed is what bid over 6@d ? having Q in @s and A in @h with AK in @c i must bid 7 - i don't see the cards ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: problem ()|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@D is a fine call, and west could bid an easy 7 with @CAKQ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also with xxa in @s ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Grands wich Roland like to bid Al:)|pg||
nt|Walddk8: How does he know that Lauria doesn't have @CQ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@d is too much, for my opinion|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|jcmax:  well done!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: played the other way up in OR on @S lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no  same way played|pg||
pc|cT|nt|varange: the ace and the queen |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 7@H ok with 4 cards - with 3 cards can be a misunderstand ...|pg||
nt|Walddk8: ahh, Giubilo wasn't sure that Lauria had spades as his longer suit|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: The thing is that this may be huge a swing for Trabucchi because Fantoni will open 1@C in the other room|pg||
nt|bridge_one: finesse - Intonti is very precise player|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sharkey: thanks everyone - interesting match|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i suppose netryprobs Henry|pg||
nt|hedyg: immediately attacking the side suit while still in control all suits|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk8: But the maestro is still there|pg||
nt|bridge_one: what means 2@D Simon ?|pg||
nt|sharynr: @C9 lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they use xfert in canapé ?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: still dont know|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: everybody in silence|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Our appreciation to the FIGB for ensuring that this event is brought to BBO vugraph. Gianluca Frola, and on behalf of BBO, Vincenzo Delle Cave, have been instrumental in setting up ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: a fine show|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next set after a short break, 10-15 minutes is my estimate|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yeah|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  by the way Roland, spec metions a win for Denmark over Scotland today....|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: everyone has finished|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree with that bidding. Either 3@s from N or 3@d from S after 2nt|pg||
nt|brolucius: No reason to finesse in hearts anyway.|pg||
nt|Walddk8: wow!|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Got a losing option now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 2@d xfert but longer @s if strong|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Can it be from 964?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Must be curling|pg||
nt|varange: ah. I see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and *then* they must avoid slam|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This auction was the same as OR up to the final bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @S lead better for defence|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: made now|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty all, bye for now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that overcall got what it deserved|pg||
nt|sharynr: can this ever be from @CQ109.....i think not|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - can have 964|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphztg: also fantoni|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think one should be too harsh on NS -- after all, they have only 7 spades, but stoppers in all suits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: bye all|pg||
nt|ritong: you prefer double?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thanks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very busy vugraph weekend ahead of us|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I sympathise with South though|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so do I|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Such a double could have been the difference|pg||
nt|bjacobs: His partner is going to deliver precisely 0 tricks to the defence|pg||
nt|tejjyid: perhaps partner didn't have a weak jump available in @C|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Italy, Spain, Scotland and Sweden. All great events|pg||
nt|me argent: its souths final pass that i find interestin |pg||
nt|me argent: g|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  seems so...|pg||
nt|lestergold: restricted choice etc|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sharynr: so must go up|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: well played|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's where we came in!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all|pg||
nt|petergill: bidding Five over Five fails once again|pg||
nt|petergill: although the vulnerability made it fairly attractive|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, one can be a BIT sympathetic on this deal|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Credit Versace for having taken a bid over 4@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: thereby stimulating the auction|pg||
nt|petergill: good point Bill|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Cheers|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphztg: byee|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Thx all and bye for now|pg||
nt|varange: bye simon|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But we lost to Sweden in women's handball, that's bad|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this 1Nt is strange (normally 4@H + 5+ in a minor) - they probably use to give a open strong without other major|pg||
pc|h3|nt|daman: I have to leave   ciao  everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Lauria has seen it all before|pg||
nt|sharynr: need to go|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|othered1: Thanks Simon for the fine presentation!  Thanks everyone else and bye!|pg||
nt|Walddk8: What can you say?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: wait|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: now i can ask 2@d meaning|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to be the best in the world is a good idea to be lucky :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ask, please|pg||
nt|stewball: forcing stayman?|pg||
nt|Walddk8: no|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think xfert - with @s only longer and gf|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Transfer according to the CC|pg||
nt|Walddk8: But continuation is not there|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they use complicated continuation Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk8: 2@d trf, but can be with 4@h if longer @s, I am told|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, but longer @S means also GF|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Simon ?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: all the 2 suiter majors are bid with 2@d|pg||
nt|Walddk8: they use 2@d with any 4-5 major, and apparently also with 6-4 -> rightsiding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: OK, a different kind of xfert - i imagine this !|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thx all|pg||
nt|bridge_one: BYE |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: bye bye|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Thanks all and buona notte|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bjacobs: I can see why North bid just 2@C - it's just a tad strong for a WJO|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Losing to Sweden is terrible, in all sports|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
