mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: rehi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: welcome all to the 3rd stanza|pg||
nt|athene: hi welcome back everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbe: sorry, different distribution|pg||
nt|athene: @CJ lead could be ducked by declarer|pg||
pc|s7|nt|april7: could it be a misunderstandingß|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hello again|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petepunt: nice relaxing 1st board|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk7: Morning David, Peter and Mike|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome back to the 2nd stanza with your operators Christine and Stuart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult to judge what the South hand is worth facing a 2NT opener|pg||
nt|athene: this would have decent chances on a minor-suit lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: AKx of hearts would be better, with the @CQ instead. @HQ is rather wasted  |pg||
nt|april7: unfortunately 1 down, no parkingplace for the @S or @D loser|pg||
nt|athene: as it is, he might duck a spade and hope for (very unlikely) minor-suit squeeze|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: S asking if 4th lead, E says no as he has doubled, therefore presuming its a 3rd or 5th card lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we could speculate about this for some time, methinks|pg||
nt|athene: ducking a spade rectifies the count but also gives up on the @SJ being some sort of menace|pg||
nt|athene: he will be thinking about complicated three-suit squeezes without the count|pg||
nt|athene: we may be here for some time...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as one does...|pg||
nt|april7: whats the difference whether its 4th or 3d/5th lead|pg||
nt|athene: i think north should bid 3@C over 2@S here|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: if he isn't going to open 3@C|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|athene: there might be some ending where you really need to know the distribution|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|Walddk7: and good morning to Jeffrey Allerton|pg||
nt|jallerton: Hello everybody|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petepunt: looks like he wil play for a @D @C sqz that doesnt work|pg||
nt|athene: even if you got to a successful throw-in ending (e.g. @SKQ, @CQ with east) he could just exit with the @CQ to block the suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if West throws a club now, he likely has five, with four on the table|pg||
pc|h7|nt|april7: back again and good afternoon|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: the trumps lie well for the double finesse, but entries to dummy are just a bit short :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: yes, minor-suit squeeze looks the best (only) legitimate chance|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|april7: so thats why it goes down 1|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: south just did too much|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petepunt: where did it go wrongin the bidding ?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|athene: north has the world of key cards - he can't not bid slam after south shows even mild interest, can he?|pg||

nt|Walddk7: 13 tricks??|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome to the Gold cup Semifinal Christine Walker operating|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (on a 2-1 trump split)|pg||
nt|april7: duülication of values|pg||
nt|xenya: EW were a bit lucky on that one|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|petepunt: doubt N will raise 1N here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|athene: yes, surprising decision from west to pass 3nt with four spades and a small doubleton|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|april7: here we have an easy 4@S contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a superb exampple of a 2@C overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|jallerton: 1@d = "Stayman"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: In the other s/f Matheson - Sime bid 1N-3N. @HK lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT =17-19|pg||
nt|athene: north way too good for 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but no convenient cue-bid; it's possible to use 2NT in that position as the good raise|pg||
nt|april7: it wil be a 4@H contract for EW|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: finding the usual Jxx in dummy |pg||
nt|petepunt: 1@C two + ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petepunt: X of 2@S would be negative and show similar ahand for N|pg||
nt|athene: four top losers, and nowhere to put them even if the defence don't cash them right off|pg||
nt|athene: @H1097 lead more likely than @HK onside; maybe you rise ace here|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 17-19 3Hts|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: perhaps he just decided that with everyone bidding, Robson had to have a light 2@C overcall, so 3@C wasn't going to hurt|pg||
nt|april7: after ace of@D E has a choice ow plays and might guess wrong, so E must help and lead @C after K of @H|pg||
nt|athene: a trump lead is possible, with declarer known to have three|pg||
nt|athene: trying just to stop a ruff in the closed hand|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|athene: but that sort of "trusting opponents" strategy can allow opps to talk you out of things|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jallerton: yes, any 11-13/17-19 bal or natural|pg||
nt|athene: of course it might find partner's @HQ :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: better to trust your partner|pg||
pc|h6|nt|april7: good duck by N|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|xenya: 1@D showed @Hs, 2@HS was 4 hearts and minimum -- well, S decided it was worth bidding 4|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jallerton: The @d play for 3 tricks anyway, so the lead did not give away the contract|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|april7: E guessed wron but still down because 9 and 10 of @D dont drop|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|athene: if declarer had the @D10, it would be necessary for west to play a club now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: so well done|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|petepunt: playing 1n as 17-19 means you can bid over 1@C on very min values safely|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|athene: east, of course, knows the diamonds aren't going anywhere for declarer|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: north has to play @SQ right away to block the suit|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|col3435: what would 1@c : 1M mean? do we know?|pg||
nt|athene: as well as causing problems in the bidding, the nebulous 1@C opener can make things hard for the defence in the play, though - they might not think of declarer having a concealed ...|pg||
nt|athene: trick source in diamonds|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c9|nt|jallerton: N/S play an interesting treatment: 1@h/@S response to 1@c shows a 5+-card suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: knowing Crouch, it won't be natural|pg||
nt|athene: oh, sorry, the @DQ is good too :) no need|pg||
nt|april7: 11 tricks  not needing double finesese|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petepunt: id1@D stayman that figures|pg||
nt|jallerton: No, Crouch has to play Forrester's system!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite right too|pg||

nt|april7: good defence in pairs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Good, both scores corrected now|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the defence have lots of time to get their club established against 4@S here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the 6@H was flat, but Silverstoen had a chance - West led a club from the queen|pg||
nt|april7: 2 giants meet|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: 4@S looks normal for north, assuming 1@S promised five|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: wow, he splinters!?|pg||
nt|petepunt:  4@S looks eniugh for me |pg||
nt|april7: 4@S onlyand 5@H only 1 down|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: the overtricks have vanished :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: e won't give up|pg||
nt|athene: some might bid only 3@S with south over the double, but you don't really know what to do when they then bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: so you might as well take the "4@S over 4@H" push right away|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: now double from east|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@S = 1NT|pg||
nt|april7: N will afterwards consider 5@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzaf: Ooops|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West dumps @DQ to give himself an entry to dummy |pg||
nt|april7: but 5@H is a good save|pg||
nt|athene: surprising lack of activity from east|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: E?W did well not to save bit now theyhave to take care in def|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: even making a slam try|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|athene: how on earth did 5@H make in the other room? :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in order to take the spade finesse, perhaps....|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk7: lol|pg||
nt|april7: 4th @D could be the second discard|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|april7: and will|pg||
pc|h4|nt|april7: so 6@H would have been a good save, but N made the forward move to stop EW|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h8|nt|athene: Silverstone led his aces|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|athene: so Forrester had two pitches for diamonds, with the ruffing finesse in spades|pg||
nt|petepunt: hackets been around since the ark so easy switch @C :)|pg||

nt|athene: will declarer play on clubs or diamonds?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Do you agree with North's t/o double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but he was a bit unlucky his partner had such a great heart suit|pg||
nt|athene: and nothing at all wasted in spades|pg||
nt|petepunt: trying to cut out @S suit with his opening , i suspect|pg||
nt|athene: double is game-try (3@S would be merely competing)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petepunt: non vul yes, but vul|pg||
nt|april7: the only way toplay 7@H is the ruffing finesse in @C and fortunate @H are 2-2. Hand much to strong for a 5@C opening.imo|pg||
nt|athene: north, unsurprisingly, doesn't accept the try|pg||
pc|sK|nt|col3435: it wouldn't have occurred to me, though that doesn't mean it's bad|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have been asked why Crouch is playing here and not playing football :)|pg||

nt|petepunt: its a perfect fit n/s |pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you want to play this hand in game? I suppose it's virtually cold if @s are 2-2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: three minor losers, and the hearts can be played either way |pg||
nt|petepunt: need to guess 1major suit right |pg||
nt|athene: 3@C was clearly intended as pre-emptive|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: west can put two spades through but it doesn't quite give east three trump tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: will silverstone hook the @S9 for the overtrick? :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jallerton: why do you have to guess @h?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, the third heart goes on a diamond |pg||
nt|athene: but i am not sure you can play that without a lot of artificial kit, because you need some way to make a real (invitational) 3@C bid|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|c4|pg||

nt|athene: double is a possible alternative for south|pg||

nt|april7: 5@C or 3NT for the lucky position of the @D suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|athene: 1@S forcing, no major (X would be hearts; 1@H would be spades)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|petepunt: isnt 1n 17-19 ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d = no 5-card major, 1NT =17-19|pg||
nt|athene: many would overcall 2@D with north|pg||
nt|april7: EW has a partscore in @S and NS might try a @C partscore|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|athene: but robson is there for him!|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|april7: W will X and E will bid 2@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: no fears about re-opening|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not a big fan of 1NT, with only one spade stop|pg||
nt|athene: silverstone just needs to know if his partner has a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|athene: if he has, 6@C must be good|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: so what does N have avaiable here? Is this showing short @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 3@S - singleton club 3 suit hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzaf: In principle 44 Majors  but TF judged his hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: will worry @D may be 4-1|pg||
nt|jallerton: Declarer may try to lead a @s hoping 2nd hand has the ace, planning to switch to @d|pg||
nt|jallerton: though contuining @s OK if with @s 3-3 or guesses @h|pg||
nt|jallerton: Declarer does not know that @c are 4-4|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks like 7 tricks tho.|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you might bid 1nt to show values, but here, partner is never moving over it anyway, so you aren't getting to game|pg||
nt|april7: If N finds Q of @C, 7 tricks, if not....|pg||
nt|athene: so why not just bid 2@D?|pg||
nt|april7: should E have a singleton @D then 6 @C to be made|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure he has  achieved much by taking this very scenic route to 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: inersting tx|pg||
nt|athene: i don't have the NS system details; i assume north just asked for 5- and 4-card majors|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: he might duck this|pg||
nt|april7: down again on @S lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petepunt: or @Sare 4-2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: @SK is one hurdle cleared, but no luck in either red suit|pg||
nt|april7: unfortunately @D dont break|pg||

pc|d6|nt|petepunt: spec thinks dec may be sqz;d out of 7th |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|athene: hoping his partner has an entry (major-suit ace or even @CQxx if declarer misguessed)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|april7: S will try @D and then doublefinesse in @H|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|c3|nt|athene: at BAM i think he takes the @DAK and gives up; there's too much danger of conceding 12 tricks otherwise|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: now he needs three heart tricks |pg||
nt|athene: do you start with the @HJ or a small one? the @HJ looks very silly if west has a singleton @HK|pg||
nt|athene: but gains against singleton @H10 offside or west not covering|pg||
nt|april7: I think J is best|pg||
nt|april7: i OR 2 down, should be only 1 down here|pg||
nt|april7: no sorry J of @D maeks another trick|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: small diamond from west now|pg||
nt|petepunt: Wests failure to open 15-17 1N may help here|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe he will play a club, playing his partner for the @CK?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|petepunt: a@D first would have avoided this guess ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Knew ducking a @d to East was safe as East could not be cashing two clubs (West known to have the jack)|pg||
nt|jallerton: not the @h finesse option|pg||
nt|petepunt: hence q@C known to be with Waterlow|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petepunt: but 10@H keeps options open now|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|april7: W might try asmall @D now, before releaising the ace|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: that was always the problem - east ends up throwing his clubs, so declarer is very unlikely to go wrong in the suit|pg||

nt|petepunt: its easier up here though!|pg||
nt|athene: if it's very close, you should perhaps go for the winning line because if you're wrong it's only one down|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: but if you play the other way and it's wrong, you are two down|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|athene: but it certainly wasn't easy|pg||
nt|athene: lightish 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 4@S By S to be made due to fall of JQ of @C, will they reach it?|pg||
nt|athene: will north go for 3nt, rather than 4@H, with a 4333?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|petepunt: as a feather|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|jallerton: 2@d shows 6!+ hearts?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it might be hard to show the heart support AND suggest notrumps|pg||
mb|4H|nt|col3435: transfer seems likely, given who South is|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, that was the explanation at the table|pg||
nt|april7: very aggressive X, EW have 3NT on a @H lead because of @H 4-4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ligtish 1@D, too|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: when you play against pairs who open 2+ 1@C you really need some good rules as to when your club bids are natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: especially when 1@C might be only two cards in a balanced weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: south's double is 4+ spades i guess, and north's is exactly three spades|pg||
nt|athene: "serious 3nt" or something might get in the way|pg||
nt|athene: or 4@H of course :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: an anti-restricted-choice hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jallerton: Is this really the right hand to pass it on though?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzaf: E asking N if S has atleast 1 @C, response is yes|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3n looks like it oculd have made ? in O/R|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|april7: very lucky lead for S|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|petepunt: again nothing on for e/w |pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|petepunt: passnormally shows 6@D and weak|pg||
nt|col3435: Pass seems OK to me, you want to keep it low on the misfit (partner might be bidding again if you bid 2@h) and you're well placed if LHO does something|pg||
nt|col3435: but it's obviously a bit of a gamble still|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North probbaly happy to be playing in anything but hearts |pg||
pc|d4|nt|april7: but who would think of @C on this bidding|pg||
nt|april7: S is not believing in his luck|pg||
nt|april7: S doesn't trust the @D 10 lead as top of sequence and K with E, E wouldn'*t lead @D now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|petepunt: not by W though|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: now a spade to the @S10, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: it's always a delicate business when you want to draw trumps but preserve a trump in dummy to control a weak suit|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you have any reason whatsoever to expect your @d to be better than partner's @h?|pg||
nt|april7: another tough decision|pg||
nt|athene: you might play the @HA now, on the basis that even if east does have @HQxx left, you have chances of getting the diamond away on a club|pg||

nt|april7: without a @C lead, perhaps Q of @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 5@C sugested as more informative by S first time|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps thought that dummy was likely to have a trick source in clubs, in which case an aggressive lead was necessary|pg||

nt|jallerton: A bit of waiting for Robson to finish too!|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Thanks ably assisted by Stuart Bradnam|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might consider holding up the @CK and finessing diamonds into north - that would be right if north had the @HA |pg||
nt|athene: but when people respond 2@C to 1major, it's very often just a balanced hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|april7: E might duck @C and try to finesse @D the right way|pg||

nt|mdgraham: well judged by EW - 5@H is down one|pg||
nt|athene: i might have been a little bit worried with east - you do have a very pure hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: N/S likely to take out insurance in 6@D if Hackets bids one more .|pg||
nt|april7: is 1NT by E forcing, in what system?|pg||
