mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|mmmakela: bad heart break here|pg||

nt|justin c: is this a vul overcall?|pg||

mb|3D!|an|diamonds and spades|mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: danger in finding the 5-5 fit it seems..|pg||

nt|xenya: it's true that N was unlikkely to have 7 hearts, but the play doesn't cost |pg||
nt|justin c: i guess if north's hand is an overcall, east's is a fit jump|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: that one should have been -3 but may have escaped for -2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not a classic fit jump  but  a bit good for a siple 2@S maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: this might not make either!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: my granny told me to always have a good suit when I fit jump!|pg||
nt|justin c: Sanders' granny not nearly so shy|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: yes, EW had better stay out of game here|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: interesting pass by W -- are they playing a strong 1@C or something?|pg||

pc|h5|pg||

nt|rnmalik: the stiff 9@S very important card|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: i must say i don't understand 4@S|pg||
nt|justin c: trying to get a forcing game going|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a trick in each suit to lose  and a sharp double by South|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: a bit lucky perhaps -- many would bid game with EW's hands, vulnerable|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzak: checking cc|pg||
nt|xenya: and 3N looks particularly promising|pg||
nt|xenya: also, S might consider a double over 1@S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this runs into a ruff, but a small ruff was better for north it seems|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so might go differently elsewhere|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mmmakela: y they did "well" in OR to reach 3 NT|pg||
nt|xenya: once again, declarer seems to have adopted an inferior plan|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Even 1NT in danger it seems|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|xenya: seems the contract will be in danger then?|pg||

nt|rednaxela: Sime back in the lead.  5 imps on the previous board where 2@s went off against 1@s made at this table.|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: double fit time|pg||
nt|rednaxela: This could test our players' high level judgement.|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: Yes he did|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer tried to keep his option open, playing back a diamond and got in a mess|pg||
nt|rnmalik: their lead is also reducing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: last board of the set now|pg||
nt|chthonic: Bye all|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, the match is much closer now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wilkinsona: odds are the final contract will be doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: so well done by Derek Sanders for the first big swing of the match|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: fit jumps at the 5 level, crickey|pg||
nt|rnmalik: last board of the segment|pg||
nt|xenya: and this is the last board of stanza 4|pg||
nt|xenya: i like S's 3N -- somewhat unfortunate N had 6 spades and bid them|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rednaxela: We have been too high for the last three bids.  Will it stop?|pg||
nt|xenya: 4 more to come|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yes, but if he bid 3 spades first he would then pass 3N|pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: E promising 15-17 now|pg||
nt|xenya: 1N=15-17|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: last board of this set.. thanks everyone, next set starts 2pm GMT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|wilkinsona: and straight into bat again..|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if covers 7&8 guarantee a stopper|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not so easy to see where tricks come from here..|pg||
nt|xenya: playing a strong NT, EW would have probably landed in 2@S -- i wonder if that was available here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6@D?|pg||
nt|rednaxela: too high to make, I meant.  5@c was obviously a great save.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: thats a well judged pass of 4 clubs by John Matheson...|pg||
nt|xenya: he could hardly do that in their methods i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: 2 Heart - reverse attitude, suit preference|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: oops..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: that pass by Bif...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...invites the wrong decision...|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Converting to 6@d gave E/W two more chances to go wrong at no extra cost!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Sanders is wondering what the pass meant|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if it gave him  a choice, he might go on|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N looks quite playable here -- the 2@D opening (somewhat unorthodox perhaps) seems to have worked well|pg||
nt|xenya: this requires careful play|pg||
nt|justin c: 2@C some sort of checkback looking for @S fit|pg||
nt|justin c: and finding it|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yo_yo: yes and McGeorge shows a max with 3@S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wilkinsona: ..admit I would't find it..|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wilkinsona: may pass, dont really expect him to x|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh oh|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: Now North is thinking|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south should have doubled, surely|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: not that 2@S is much better on this layout|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that double didnt take long|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona: it is, but after this sequence to odds that 2 spades is preferable have changed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Derek has had not much luck with finneses..|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rednaxela: Well, well!|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: Quick as a flash!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: for example, if declarer banks on 3-2 @S, he will go down|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|wilkinsona: ...successful with the drop here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wilkinsona: its easy when we see 4 hands, but Bif could have double 6d and stuart 6 h|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer has the rest|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i understand -- still W is 5-4-3-1|pg||
nt|justin c: 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: -1 now|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wilkinsona: as there is are slight chances that (a) E may have a singleto spade and (b) E may elect to raise with 3|pg||
nt|xenya: and that's what has happened|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @DA and K@H|pg||
nt|xenya: the @D A is right, but declarer found it out too late|pg||
pc|c5|nt|wilkinsona: sorry Gerald double 6 heart I meant|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sT|mc|10|nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: bye for now|pg||
nt|justin c: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: End of stanza 6, thanks all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: bye  everyone|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks Justin/Stuart|pg||
