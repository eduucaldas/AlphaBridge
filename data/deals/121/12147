nt|Walddk2: Systems Simon?|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is the tightest match of the round of 16|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't believe that Clair passed|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: wrong board|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe they are not playing this board at all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: wait a moment|pg||
nt|hedyg: Carlo would not open 1NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1NT not exactly textbook either|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like they turned the board|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe "tightest match" meant...|pg||
nt|hedyg: closest score Marshall|pg||
nt|hedyg: might a free translation from French|pg||
nt|Walddk2: wronf file it seems. open room operator shut down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "tight" is american slang for "tipsy"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Simon will do too|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: wrong file system|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: we quit and then come back|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: hi everyone from a foggy, freezing Manchester|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looking at the NS hands, 6@C is not so unreasonable |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 6@C is pretty good and preemption might boost them into it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nothing new there then|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Yes nightmer|pg||
nt|milton_se: buying this cheaply|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not lucky enough perhaps?|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: But it's awkward to bid 5@C now since partner will think opener has more hearts|pg||
nt|henryb: Have Fantunes changed system? The last time I watched them they played forcing one bids and 10-13 two bids|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No change there|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they're in the open room:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might take the money here|pg||
nt|hedyg: double passed out by Versace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: If the defence never leads @H, 4@S might not make|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hawe45:  As long as E/W doÂ´nt touch the @H-suit, all is OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Do we know if 2@C is natural?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: GF|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks natural|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would be tempted to bid 5@D with an 8 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Takes a very good defence to defeat 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: E-W play Angelini's version of Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  canape sequence from north it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1any has always been forcing, 14+   and 2any  10-14|pg||
nt|henryb: Ah, but we do not have Fantunes|pg||
nt|brolucius: South can discount a slam since they play a strong 1@C system.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: @d lead?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well as cards lie 6 of a red looks pretty good|pg||
nt|lestergold: not suggesting it should be bid!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Notice the canapé style of N-S. So Blue Club it is, Simon?|pg||
nt|othered1: Old-fashioned forcing 2N would describe south's hand well, too.|pg||
nt|hedyg: guess he already showed that with 4 @d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is a very interesting match|pg||
pc|cA|nt|milton_se: not a double?|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N looks fairly cold also|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N+2 looks likely at both tables|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: after this board, i'll ask them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Andrea Manno is one of the Italian rising stars. Still a junior, in his early 20's I think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West does have a tricky decision at trick 2|pg||
nt|petergill: @CQ shows the jack, then West should continue clubs, I think|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wilkinsona:  this might go ddown..|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like off 4?|pg||
nt|varange: do you know much about NS Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S with four cards is somewhat dangerous when you know that partner has close to nothing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DA and another is the only defence|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|othered1: What would be the effect of @CK under the ace?|pg||
nt|othered1: @DK, rather|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We shall see|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Drop the King, South|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1st hurdle overcome by Giubilo, but then what?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: would be a good play. South must be aware of extreme diamond length|pg||
nt|varange: hi Giorgio|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me find a Nightmare CC|pg||
nt|varange: the lastest version please Roland, not the old one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Roland|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, I don't know them|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And no old-fashioned signalling with the trumps E/W, please|pg||
nt|petergill: unless Wes worries that South's @H losers might go on dumy's |pg||
nt|petergill: @D's|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lanzarotti-Manno had a terrific first set against Fantoni-Nunes last night|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: At least|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 1@H showed @s|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing a standard system, South would have to bid 2@D (fourth suit) at his second turn, in case North was strong and a slam was a good bet.|pg||
nt|bardo: 3 sa anche in aperta|pg||
nt|henryb: Playing a standard system North would open 1@c, S 1@d, N 1@H, S 1@s, N 2@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: here is a nightmare CC http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf    this is what they play, more or less|pg||
pc|cT|nt|othered1: might depend on EW's carding agreements|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|milton_se: y, especially when Cs may be an option|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The king would not help against good defenders as East would follow with the 10 from 108x|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Full credit to Giubilo regardless. Very well done!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyway, down now. Unlucky.|pg||
nt|othered1: Right, can't do better than make winning decision|pg||
nt|hedyg: so as usual Versace made the right decision|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: 1NT was a stronger  NT than 15/17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I could think of a few puns with South's name involved :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course at tis stage declarer cannot be sure of hs contract]|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: More if declarer isn't careful|pg||
nt|brolucius: If the @S2 was indeed led from a 4-card suit (which is a good bet if 4th-best leads are in operation), declarer would know that the contract was safe. He could lose no more than ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: three spades and the @CK. By playing the @SJ, he breaks communications when West has five spades. |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Same lead against 6 NT - and Soiuth can make it double-dummy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|varange: :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no 15-17|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice 10@s in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  There is a danger in the @C-suit, if North tries some safety-play - and East plays the Jack. Might give North bad plans.|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Simon, i thought you said they play strong NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: hi|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wilkinsona:  ok,....ddddown|pg||
nt|sharkey: Lauria knows pd is void in @S as wud have played Q from QJ|pg||
nt|varange: no limericks please!|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|hedyg: and he did have 19 hcps|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yeah, cause usually who plays strong @c play weak nt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems very logical|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  lucky we can see all the hands and know that every card is right|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c5|pc|d2|nt|petergill: Manno will play off 5 or 6 rounds of @S|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|brolucius: East still has a spade, so the suit will be 4-4 (unless West found an unlikely lead from a 3-card suit into a bid suit).|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Nightmare was wrote for Buratti - Probably now they will play different gadgets, but the base of system is for sure the same of book|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: this club suit aint coming in|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  Defence has placed the @C-stopper at West only, bad idea|pg||
pc|c6|nt|varange: no easy exit available, is there?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, S is sort of endplayed|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: West's @C8 was best - a @h would have been fatal|pg||
nt|petergill: @D or @h now?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: west about to have his 2h promoted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria knows the whole hand now and will pitch a diamond|pg||
nt|sharkey: In OR E overcalled 1@S thus N not subjected to the pressure bid 4@S - so no sacrifice|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hawe45:  It makes now!|pg||
nt|petergill: If West discarded a @H when he pitched @H8, South crosses to @Dk, leads a heart up, then pins @HJ10|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There's a lot of play left in this hand.  This is where GIB doesn't really help us|pg||
nt|petergill: I think @C4 looks OK, but I'm not sure|pg||
nt|petergill: When I wrote @H8, I meant @C8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I suppose it's the last trump that really turns the screw ... but will declarer know this?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a fine system. I like that 18-19 balanced is included in the 1@D opening|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt weak, so 1@c can be 15/17 bal - 1@C can have 11hcp with 6@c 5x ! or any 15+ with 4+@C|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Nunes is out of table|pg||
nt|bridge_one: thie the old version - they change frequently the sequence, overall when change the partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  1M  ;  1NT  18-19   much better than the awkward jump to 2NT|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H can be 4 cards in 3 suit hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Those who missed the first set did not miss anything. The bridge was pretty awful (if you are wllowed to use pretty and awful in the same sentence)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c9|nt|bjacobs: And will he pick the position?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wrong again|pg||
nt|milton_se: trying to beat it costs an overtrick|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: We can see that he can make it if he reads the position, but he can't|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|milton_se: but it is for free|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Which I think is to drop West's @HAK doubleton|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|petergill: @HJ clarifies to East that it is South who has @HQxx|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: off 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but a diamond pitch would had led to 800|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  Aftes EastÂ´s double: Yes|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, the @CK was onside.|pg||
nt|petergill: Good defence|pg||
mc|9|nt|Walddk2: What a start, great hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It could certainly be argued that the bidding was helpful|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and funny bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: Fantastic hand - perhaps South might have picked the ending|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: uwelcome|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d played in EW|pg||
nt|othered1: I couldn't stay out if they had bid the pointed suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 14 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|varange: amaazing layout|pg||
nt|yo_yo: dicing with death|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: nko reason for the stiff KC to be found|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To me Easts hand more looks like a @C-@d reverse hand - no intermediates for NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: did u mean to say that the bridge wa pretty awesome?|pg||
nt|othered1: Here's Masselli's 2-suited bid -- bid them both.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: and the lead would be @S, not @c|pg||
nt|milton_se: oops|pg||
nt|varange: ouch|pg||
nt|brolucius: West is (much) too good to bid 4@S, so he marks time with the fourth suit. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: West's hand is suited for a strong jump shift at his first turn, but no-one plays those any more I guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 2@S and then 4@S, to show a great suit but not many controls.|pg||
nt|daman: very oxymoronic|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems, that only South is vulnerable...!|pg||
nt|hedyg: no entry to the S hand for a @H finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: can doublefinesse in both black suits|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@h with maximum .... strange|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Rehi, everyone!|pg||
nt|hedyg: re Ed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: technically is correct to play double finesse - so 4@h made|pg||
nt|varange: hi Ed|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: I am Fabio not Simon :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Paper thin game ... but once East has opened, it's inevitable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nunes is in the same position in the other room. With four cards left, East is down to the singleton @HK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer has @HQx and @DAx|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: seems 2@H was forcing..|pg||
nt|xenya: a wheel came off?|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh sry Fabio!|pg||
nt|hedyg: ciaooooo!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: we have changed|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ciaooo|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Funny situation - you must play for 2-2 in @D or accept to loose a trich to SOUTH, not to North|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and read it!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wilkinsona:  unless its led|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  even when I do play em I can't get my partners to use them|pg||
nt|lestergold: this must mean please make a cue bid pard|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: We often see the weak jump shift mis-used on BBO VuGraph, so perhaps better to play strong jump shifts, even if you never use them.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|varange: two|pg||
nt|milton_se: nice to agree on what´s forcing :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so i see!|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sharkey: Assuming a @S lead dont think you need @C finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: here declafrer can afford the safety play|pg||
nt|hedyg: not really enough for reverse|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure - but minimum!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The @H-suit brings this 3 NT safely home|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a @s lead...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Whatever lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: guess @h help the declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: now he needs to ask for another one!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: lauria is a good soldier:)|pg||
nt|henryb: Its not that uncommon to play strong JS at the two level in a 2/1 structure|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S is forcing because it was preceded by the fourth-suit bid.|pg||
nt|lestergold: but Lauria with massive controls will soon get the message] |pg||
nt|brolucius: West might 'invent' 4@D, to see if East has a heart control.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i agree|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: it's the winning bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: not actually easy to bid this hand|pg||
nt|henryb: look how easy this hand is after 1@d-2@s: East splinters with 4@h and West bids Backwood|pg||
nt|brolucius: Obviously does not show a diamond control, when bid so slowly... |pg||
nt|Walddk2: West in the other room could not be 100% certain that they had a heart control between them|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sometimes you have to lie:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: going for the throat|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow a rare thing to see 2 @H X|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Back in the match|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: but we were deprivd of watchi9ng for it|pg||
nt|hedyg: and a @d switch..|pg||
nt|othered1: avoided trump lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - but created by NorthÂ´s bidding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ok - 3@h is 4 cards with minimum, can be 14 only with 4333 - right - agrre the gadget|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: in open room the heart barrage by n/s identified the heart shortnes to west|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  well bid 4 hearts, thats good lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: Lauria cannot/willnot pass with this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Long pause then 4@S is not really the way to bid the hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S seems a bit risky on those values.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  YES - take @S Ace and play @H|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: cambiaghi apologize for his bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: franco saved him|pg||
nt|xenya: this one might not be easy|pg||
nt|irwinbo: he will now make it|pg||
nt|hedyg: actually the @c gave nothing, declarer would have played small @c to jack|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for sure - also more that one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Irwin :)|pg||
nt|varange: and then to not forget :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be OK after a jump shift but West has not really suggested full slam values, just because he bid 3@S.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D does not help Giubilo one bit|pg||
nt|lestergold: still hard here how does west know that Lauria hasnt got two small hearts now?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: at least South turned up with 3 nice @H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Right defence means 500|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|hedyg: so 2 @H was nf?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharkey: indeed - and here it will be difficult to get a @C ruff|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|brolucius: West correctly assumes that East must have a heart control for his strong bidding with nothing in trumps.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 4@S denied a red cue bid (I assume it did), 5@D should also promise a heart control|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: without club lead declarer can afford to bang down club ace before leading up to it to cater for the KC stiff|pg||
nt|xenya: not clear what happened -- any ideas?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wilkinsona:  has east not shown 5 diamonds 4clubs and 3 spades, perhaps|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: 1 IMP back here|pg||
nt|brolucius: With a singleton heart in dummy, South's signal should be suit-preference - not that it makes any difference here.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|varange: maybe some misunderstanding of what 2@d means|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not think he has said anything about club length it was just a cue|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Well defended, West|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 14 is their maximum Gio!|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT is 12.14|pg||
nt|varange: yes, but he has 4333|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, maximum only with 4333|pg||
nt|petergill: A low heart opening lead might have worked, but is not likely in the real world|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You find pairs, who lead smalle from a doubleton...!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphztg: y|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: pass or correct|pg||
nt|xenya: he chose a wrong plan it seems|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Simon :) you are the best!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Listen: We have 4 @H, 3 @C + 2 ACES - here in Denmark the total is 9|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but how do you know you have 4 hearts?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That combines 3-3 @H OR 3-3 @C - not so bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 2@C did, Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I think Lauria has shown 3154|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|hedyg: you play A@H and @H ducked and then?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I puy my money on West|pg||
nt|hedyg: small @s|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hawe45:  More @h|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bridge_one: otherwise minimum|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sharkey: sry - push|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: He's not going to care if South has @DQxx|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|hedyg: only if you can see through the cards|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: you lose 2 hearts if they are 4-2 and 3 spades then|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now only 200|pg||
nt|othered1: I like that equation (4-3-3-3 with minimum)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this table is interesting to see the new style in bridge - Fantoni Nunes invention is 2 level open for any 5+cards 10/12|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot doublefinesse @S now|pg||
nt|hedyg: so must guess|pg||
nt|milton_se: that 3rd club seems to be a mistake|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Lanzarotti use many interesting gadget (1@H 1@S with or withour 4cards, jump in xfert for majors, 1M 3minor = limit 6in minor and 4cards in other major, etc.)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|h8|pg||

nt|wilkinsona:  now here is a slam hand..|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes oon a non dimaond lead|pg||
nt|henryb: a quasi-slam, anyway|pg||

nt|petergill: Great hands, these|pg||
mb|1C|nt|milton_se: a very good 6D here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  a couple of diamond cue bids along the way|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Nice game in OR|pg||
mb|1H|nt|wilkinsona:  Lauria played carefully just to lose 2 clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w did wll to bid game here- finding a perfect fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West passed, and East had an interesting three-suited 2@C opening available next door|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass - italian style|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also foe E/W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: weak Nt in all vuln|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@C suction?|pg||
nt|varange: look slike it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well good enuf for roland on the grounds that chances of them getting away with a slam is better than 12.85%|pg||
nt|milton_se: or trash|pg||
mb|1S|nt|varange: the SDAM theory again - Six Diamonds Always Makes :)|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@c strong or natural?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Natural|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: nat|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  first diamond bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: e4spwecially if they splinter a diamond void instead of a heart void|pg||
nt|bridge_one: interesting convention - 2x over 1nt = x+1 suit or x+2/x+3 two suit hand - ungherese convention|pg||
nt|bridge_one: suction - corect|pg||
nt|bridge_one: correct|pg||
nt|othered1: so I assume 2@H is choice of major promising @D fit,if that's what north has|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@h means @D fit|pg||
nt|othered1: this does give opponents lots of information about both hands, if it can be of use|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D relay, 2@H singleton spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: likely to be bid here also now|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ralfwil: the safe contract, but @hA is on side, so the problem is to find 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS system : http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fiori_Napoletano.txt|pg||
nt|xenya: finding a fit in a minor after 1N opening is often a problem|pg||
nt|xenya: an exercise in slam bidding -- shouldn't be too difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Italy/angelini-sementa.pdf  I believe this is the card Angelini plays with Versace too|pg||
nt|henryb: why 3@d and not two?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's their NT opener?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 15-17|pg||
nt|othered1: west doesn't have a 1N opener, regardless of range, playing with someone who can bid as well as east|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i see Giubilo doesnt open 1NT with 5/4 in the blacks|pg||
nt|hedyg: wish i knew what 2@c is|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|hedyg: @D lead would be good if S showed @ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: and 2 @s|pg||

nt|lestergold: hi Henry seems we have more commentators than specs hwere|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: agree vladimir, but 3nt from S gave no options|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In the northern part of Europe, you are NOT allowed to pass a hand like EastÂ´s|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: at least 5-4 minors short in @s ga,e try or more|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: more east to find 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the rest of the world neither|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 9 tricks easy|pg||
nt|milton_se: now they can't miss it|pg||
nt|hedyg: Simon can you help us?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: 11 tricks appear possible if defenders fail to draw some trumps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C may be some sort of ask - 2@S maximum?|pg||
nt|othered1: well fittijng hands, with no unsupported Q or J.  HCPs don't do these hands justice|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: here i'm|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Board 19: A spec gives me the mood to ask, what if South duck simply with the @H QUEEN?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Nunes led the mandatory trump against the known Marmic hand|pg||
nt|milton_se: question is: will they go for 7?|pg||
nt|varange: he'll look for the grand, will he?|pg||
nt|brolucius: West described his hand a lot better here than his counterpart managed at the other table.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: No problem, spade to hand, and clear the last trump|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: he can ruff 1 @h and 1 @d for 11 tricks|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Now Clair has revealed the diamond position|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1S clear with that hand regardless of toybox|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would he have done if the response had been 2@S?|pg||
nt|othered1: quite a difference in judgement between rooms over the 1N opening|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We would all bid 2 @C - or? (As North)|pg||
nt|petergill: The Law of Total Tricks is notoriously inaccurate at the FIVE level, according to the theory in the latest books|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bridge_one: always, also after 1red open|pg||

nt|xenya: and where will it get them?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cameo could have bid his hand better. Double must be wrong with a singleton heart|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3@C pass 4@s - now no defence by N/S|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||

nt|othered1: in a @C system, if I can open 2@C with east's hand, I"d consider it.  But not 1|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bad communication for the defence|pg||

nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: 50 per cent though -- any black lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: and West could have passed if it was appropriate from his hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me 2nt in this sequence is forcing and shows a 4-card support and @c control and 3@c the same without a @c control|pg||
nt|othered1: @C6 could be a threat|pg||
nt|hedyg: did N really bid X with 6 @hs? he must work this out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D Ace and a @d - the roof comes down|pg||
nt|hedyg: but if he plays A@D and @d ruff N discs 1 @s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Has no alternative, East|pg||
nt|othered1: Is that best defense there?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9@H could well be from doubleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: S passed 2@c X so likely has 4 @cs and 5 @d|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H was a gutsy bid that deserved 5@H by N imo|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is why i said need to lead D 8|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: @H was never bid in OR|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@H not vuln it was a good choise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with @S by West South could take a chance to make the contract with a end game against East|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: should even up the scores a bit|pg||
nt|othered1: but slightly less likely to sit Dbl with relative @H length.|pg||
nt|petergill: Wirgren and Lawrence's book was the book I had in mind. Something like: LoTT is very good at 2 and 3 levels, OK at 4 level but bad at 5 level, if I recall correctly|pg||

nt|varange: :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: surely with K@D Manno would have played @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last time Fulvio missed a defence was Aug 7, 1993|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec asks what exactly did the 1 spade bid mean|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H seems clear to me. taking the save is not so clear. EW might have only 8 spades, and 3D did not necessarily show 5-5. S has defense and N has no shortness. also, it is not clear ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at all--to me, anyway--whether the pass over 4S is, or should be, forcing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 1@S Roland not so sure declarer can't read the same the hands - with 6@h with one+ honor few don't bid 2@h over 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|Walddk2: forcing? even thinking about it is an overbid|pg||
nt|irwinbo: when he draws trump, south's hand will count out|pg||
nt|hedyg: are you sure he missed it then?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: apparently equivalent to a negative double but without holding 4 spades|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: nf imo but the fact is that S did not double 4@s, so N might think about 5@H|pg||

nt|mdgraham: no|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't and likely would also pass north's hand, but that is close|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not me  but I open North hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|othered1: Notht he greatest weak NT opening, if that's my style.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has the best hand from the three "openers"|pg||
mb|1S|nt|wilkinsona:  I should say that some specs may be confused, after all it was EW that intoduced the artificiality, so why should they complain if it goes wrong?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@D=@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Transfer responses|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On that board, with probably at best an 8-card fit, it would be a huge violation to proceed to the 5-level|pg||
mb|2H|nt|xenya: EW had better keep low on this one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - the xfert over 1@C open work very well|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can be also 11 with 6@C 5any|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Well bid by Fantunes to reach top spot|pg||
nt|hedyg: anybody bid 3@c with the S hand over 1@s?|pg||
nt|irwinbo: not me|pg||
nt|hedyg: i find it very tempting|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|milton_se: 1NT 14-16?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 14 Pearson Points|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  yep 5 diamonds is great|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A heart lead dooms the contract because West must get in with @DQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer does not have enough tricks without diamonds|pg||
nt|varange: probably|pg||
nt|xenya: well now a spade lead looks like a killer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Lauria likes his 10s|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S by Versace is the right call, not Pass, in case anyone wonders|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hedyg: okok so i am alone :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid 2C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes Hedy, alone :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poor defence in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spade to the ace and another. At least East could have ashed a top heart first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: cashed even|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, even on a spade continuation, where is the 9th trick?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South know the shortness in @D in North|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can caount 2 down with his hand|pg||
nt|othered1: so the third best hand opens 4th seat.|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has 11|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pearson points  what are those?|pg||
nt|hedyg: and 2 10s!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: normal hcp + spade length|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NO - the best of the three!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@h not 4 cards - |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, an ace, and 3-card support.  A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  I DO hope, that South is NOT thinking of any bid but PASS|pg||
nt|hedyg: more imps to Angelini|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Right - but not with that hand...|pg||
nt|petergill: Lauria has a good hand, and South is hoping to be able to Dbl 4@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Versace is thinking of passing 3@C|pg||
nt|petergill: Would you?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: pass because the chance to beat 4@s is hight with K in @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1nt relay - could pass witt not interesting hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT= 4 @s?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1nt 4@s, sry |pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Fabio :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh, East endplayed himself|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A in @H in North instead A in @d with K in @c (probably after 4@c) is down before to start|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am sure he would like to forget this deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: I thought that was a Reese thing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Isn't 3@C more a long-suit try, not necessarily guaranteeing 4+ clubs?|pg||
nt|petergill: Me too - no - it could be a 3-4 fit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: East had a pretty clearcut pass of 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb: even so, why bid Stayman with North's 4-3-3-3 and extra values|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT is a better game, strangely on a 5-4 heart fit.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@d one 5 major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they play Blue Club, they can only have a 5-card major if maximum (15-16)|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho interesting point here is that 9 cold top tricks in 3n and 4H is only about a 50 percenter|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@h ask the major|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2nt...@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: complete duplication|pg||
nt|cuan: no, is thinking if play 4@S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: So which system is it, Simon; did you ask?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer may attempt some sort of elimination play, to avoid the club finesse.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: like a roman club|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  yep elimni on after the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: and if it wasnt on he would have a fat chance of catchinmg Lauria napping|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would need to eliminate diamonds and exit on the third round of spades - not much of a chance.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  but th spade 9 is in play now is it not?|pg||
nt|othered1: 1.5 quick tricks, no aces, opposite a passed hand?  Not close to best|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, 1@S would have the same logic that 1@h 1@s (denie @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 1Nt will be played fron strong site|pg||
nt|hedyg: no system is perfect|pg||
nt|hedyg: and he already knew about @H fit so np|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but to play 1nt from right site help , ovrall in MP competition|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: It is not Roman Club for several reasons. 1NT shows 17-20 in RC, and opening 3-card suits is normal|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he was always playing in a major, either 4@H or 4@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: and always rightsided|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: That would be a huge compliment to Lauria's declarer play|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|xenya: not that other let it through though|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: other leads*|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H promises 3 cards @H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@S is used like relay gf|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Correct defence|pg||
nt|petergill: NS make 3@H, so going about -200 in 3@S is not so bad at IMPS|pg||
nt|petergill: If you think about it, Lauria could bid 3@H with various hands with three clubs in them, so 3@C in this auction will almost always be a 4+ card suit, but Passing 3@C without prior ...|pg||
nt|petergill: discussion that one is allowed to do so would be a big view to take. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: We can see Lauria has No Chance, but he's wondering how to use his scant entries to dummy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: now as long as they dont touch the @ds...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: even with a 5-card suit on the side|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@H asking for @D|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Irrelevant, the hand was lost in the other room|pg||
nt|milton_se: over now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: 13 IMPs back...|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: declearer doesnt put his " heart|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: his 3 heart|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2 off|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  thanks viewgraph|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 4 hearts,1 diamond, 1 club |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Besides, Roman Club died many years ago|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: yes but -1 could save some|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona:  seemed to pretty well while it lasted though|pg||
nt|henryb: Died with CC Wei's money?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|milton_se: got in trouble when discarding a H|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: North having all 3 top @H's is bad news for Lorenzo Lauira, since that tends to play @SKJ and @DA as mostly offside|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|petergill: He stripped South of club exits|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Neat|pg||
nt|petergill: Nice endplay of South by Lauria|pg||
nt|cuan: for LV 3@C is long suit try. without, 2NT or 3@H. Rarely 5-5 (Ghestem overcalls)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|brolucius: Declarer is eliminating diamonds, as we expected.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lml: ducking another heart seems right not sure what he was afraid of|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: N cannot believe the actual constellation of the @ds|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bridge_one: with Q10 in @d South is sure to beat 4@S not playing @D - i don't understood the return @D|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hawe45:  HCP: The 3 hands are same size - but East has two solid suits |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now if the @SJ had the decency to drop ...|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|h4|pg||

nt|bridge_one: need a big swing ...|pg||
nt|varange: interesting hand now|pg||
nt|petergill: my mistake|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hedyg: 10-12 unbalanced|pg||
nt|othered1: How do you make 7 from west, where south can't lead @HQ?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|sharkey: 3@C?|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed, it's an excellent 6@S|pg||
nt|lml: you can even handle 4-0 onside|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 @H - doÂ´nt ask about my opinion...!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 6 was a lucky push for Angelini when 5@D made in the other room after a spade lead to the jack|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: 2@D  18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|varange: lucky in both rooms then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East's hand is the one you get regularly if you visit Mike's rubber bridge club in London|pg||
nt|petergill: How many @S will EW bid?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a pretty good slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: again a two-suiter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only Q@h lead help to make 7|pg||
nt|hedyg: a good 9 counts as 10 too|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@S needs a finesse which on the bidding might well fail|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It might make even with @SK offside?|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, better than a finesse|pg||
mb|4C|nt|wilkinsona:  this time it was the turn of the other team to catch a good OR result|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: don't you prefer dbl with N cards?|pg||
nt|hedyg: DD 6 @d|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@h : @h or a strong balanced hand|pg||
nt|petergill: as long as @H 4-3 for discards|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: might bid NT now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a lot to be said for overcalling 2D for the lead, despite the dangers|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: both majors short in @c|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for m y club its got a ten in it i usually get complete yarboroughs|pg||
nt|othered1: movie seems to give them 7 at a point where 1H loser was unavoidable|pg||
nt|hedyg: N felt squeezed?|pg||
nt|milton_se: this is an extremely good 12 -- can East imagine it?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think they will stop at 6|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: I think 2@H is ill-judged|pg||
nt|milton_se: all happy to pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East can't imagine, but west know this :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I have a feeling that the double here will help EW zero in on this hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@C  asking for majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D at least one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C  I have both|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has nothing more than he promised when he opened 1@C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But entry-problems later on|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So on the diamond lead, you play 3 hearts to pitch the diamonds, ruff a diamond, and try the spade finesse ...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Right|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@h cue denies 1st or 2nd round control in @D|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lml: they can make that slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S give the cue in .. @C (sgl or void)|pg||
nt|hedyg: E can imagine and he has ways to ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: on @H lead?|pg||
nt|lml: 6nt has 3 heart 3 spades 2 clubs and 4 diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best contract is 6 NT by East - extremely unlucky|pg||
nt|lml: maybe not|pg||
nt|xenya: but the defence will get 2 tricks earlier|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6nt is only on a squeeze, but N will return a @c to break it|pg||
nt|lml: I was just looking at that|pg||
nt|hedyg: unlikely N leads  @C vs 6NT? S did not double 3 @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: there is a good chance you will be on lead|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@s ask|pg||
nt|yo_yo: kokish  ?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2nt bal |pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have bid differently|pg||
mb|5H|nt|bridge_one: 6 more points in the majors suit in west - easy for east go to slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: you might do it double dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And the auction has not been favourable for an overcall|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c-2@d-2@h = 4+h unbal  --> 2@s relay - 3@s = 4@h/5+@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty to spec|pg||
nt|othered1: Can west define where his high cards lie and not Kxxx, Kx,  Kxxxxx,  A|pg||
mb|5S|nt|hedyg: now?|pg||
nt|lml: it does have to be played by east|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my experience the danger of such overcalls is greatly exaggerated when pd is a passed hand, we are NV, and RHO has not yet spooken|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  made in OR by simply playing towards the heart Q|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So spades mentioned for the first time at the 6-level!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 4 diamond minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 5nt choose the major|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, i might be on lead. but there is probably an equal chance that psrtner will be on lead if they bid a game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would rebid my @h over 3@c |pg||
nt|irwinbo: me too|pg||
nt|hedyg: with @s fit?|pg||
nt|hedyg: when do you show fit?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, bec @S fit work the same|pg||
nt|hedyg: you might be searching for a new pd|pg||
nt|bridge_one: find: Irwin :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|petergill: but after 3 @H's, you are in wrong hand to finesse, but still Ok in 6@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You can ruff a diamond fror the entry?|pg||
nt|petergill: a bit worried about 7-1 @D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, in that case, you have an alternative play - a low spade from the West hand.  As long as the @SK is not with the 4th heart, you will be ok|pg||
nt|petergill: cannot afford low spade after three @H's as then the defence might ruff one of your heart winners. |pg||
mb|6H|nt|wilkinsona:  right sided it seem, as a club lead from south...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Is it obvious this makes - or some choices to be made?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't matter with trumps 3-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leading towards @HQ seems best, but even if it loses, there are certain squeeze chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: if you play the @SA first and see the split West has to split spades when you lead to the queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Whatever the lead - both slams are doome to go down. A 3-years old monkey would find the @C-switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The opponents have not shown a fit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, it's a tight decision, but as we see, everything works|pg||
mb|6S|nt|lml: you can strip him and throw in on @CK|pg||
nt|xenya: well bid|pg||
nt|lml: he will have to lead a spade from the 10xx|pg||
nt|hedyg: after loosing A@H?|pg||
nt|lml: but that is completely hypothetical|pg||
nt|hedyg: no throwins in 12 LOL|pg||
nt|lml: oh sorry silly me|pg||
nt|irwinbo: llook at the bidding in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe @c discard better|pg||
nt|varange: he might have felt the need to show a suit before the bidding got too high, with the pass in West showing a wide range (0-7)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Then North ducks ONE @h-round|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This might bring in 12 tricks, playing the @dÂ´s from hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: he treated this hand as 25 balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: lauria prefer to bid a balanced hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Because he plays them better than most|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c puppet, 3@d 1 or 2 4 card majors|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: lead 4th|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think, that the two black doubletons are bad values - so never 25 for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: pass over 5@c was a better hand than 5 @D |pg||
nt|bjacobs: It will be most interesting to see how Lauria plays irt|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hedyg: only @s lead could save them|pg||
nt|cuan: 7@S or 6@S is quite the same|pg||
nt|petergill: Retaining @S2 and (after 3 hearts) playing for 2-2 spades (Ace and another) is much inferior and doesn't work|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: tell Lauria?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lml: this obviously has no play on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six flat boards out of 7 so far. Only the 9-IMP swing when E/W went for 800 in 4@S at the other table.|pg||
nt|lestergold: we are losing kibs at a rate of knots because of the dullness of the deals|pg||
nt|henryb: Would be a boring set at point-a board|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  yep even flattened the 3 club hand after a lively sequence|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Yes Ed, east know impossible to find A K K K - with this point the open was 1@D|pg||
nt|othered1: thanks.  I thought the range extended that high|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2nt = 2@h+ onesuiter or with spades min or max|pg||
nt|petergill: After 3 hearts, ruffing the diamond with @S10 to safeguard against 7-1 @d's looks wrong too |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So it's either cross to hand with a low diamond ruff, or a low spade from dummy|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: I can't see anything better than a low heart now|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: me too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Playing on clubs is an illusion as you need to get rid of two hearts|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  at the other table declarer played the ace first it seems..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: revoke is the only chance:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: trabucchi has to discard|pg||
nt|milton_se: y|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: now he wants to claim, but..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt have his mobile-number...? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What did K&R say?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Best but it doesn't help|pg||
nt|xenya: so you would just pass, Roland, awaiting developments? Or you would be content to defend 2@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would certainly pass|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: Ouch|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hedyg: lol Ralf|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sharkey: still works|pg||
nt|petergill: Turbo applies in their cue bid auctions, so bypassing 4NT meant an even number of keycards in East's hand|pg||
nt|petergill: With an odd number, East would bid 4NT over 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: I think West did a lot of cue bids in @H's to show AKQ |pg||
nt|bjacobs: 21 imps riding on this ... playing the @SA is possible (but I think inferior) and is unsuccessful|pg||
nt|petergill: Apparently EW play a sort of Turbo only when clubs are trumps|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he plans to ruff a @D with @S5, then should play @S10 next to discourage a cover|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Agree|pg||
nt|petergill: @SQ would be an error, as you do not want the spade covered|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  In pratice, East MUST start with small @S to the Queen. North MIGHT have all 4 trumps.|pg||
nt|lestergold: we need an injection of humour wouldnt be fait to pick on Jockland again|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sigh|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Bad luck Peter, he ruffed with the 6 not the 5 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, @S6 is better than @S5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: Well!|pg||
nt|petergill: General Principle: Declarer should ALWAYS play the higher of equals unless he can see a reason not to, so @S6 is superior to @S5|pg||

nt|cuan: on king, small|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now he has 3 plays!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: But leading @C A first may have ruined squeeze chances if @H K off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have Dano De Falco in spec. He is a much better analyst than me. Maybe he has an alternative (and better) line|pg||
nt|sharkey: N feeling a pinch?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  but may increase enplay chances perhaps|pg||

nt|marlowepi: on the first hand the D tap means you cant make 6S if E has Kxx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he endplayed himself instead of North|pg||
nt|milton_se: will still be endplayed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, if he cashes @CA first he has the tempo|pg||

nt|hedyg: ty Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=KJ+AQJx+AKxxx+AQ|pg||
nt|othered1: Or could west not hold the @DK, still 13 tricks with major K's?|pg||
nt|hedyg: with a good 12/13 they open 1x, A K K K would be good|pg||
nt|bjacobs: We should get extra money for trying to commentate such a tricky hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharkey: NS have a chance to regain |pg||
nt|bridge_one: give the 2 cards in @h is important !|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: However, 4@S can be defeated on best defence|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  needs a punt|pg||
nt|hedyg: we all have 1 like that|pg||
nt|hedyg: or give him KQ10xx - Kxx AKQxx|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 7@d with all good impasse|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@s weak but good|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I confess that it's impossible for West to find the heart lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: 1@s 4 cards, canapé|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Easy to make - difficult to bid = 6 @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: i.e. can have longer minor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why is that hand a problem? we will always reach spades with that hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D is acceptable|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing more|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 7 cause i see cards|pg||
nt|petergill: These great Italian EW players are the superstars whom Meckwell and the Americans beat to win the World Championships this year|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H I think|pg||
nt|cuan: "Nightmare system" for Lanzarotti-Manno. 2@S = 9-12 with 6@S |pg||
nt|bjacobs: So that makes the Americans Super Duper stars?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|sharkey: Can 4@S be defeated without @H lead?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 3@H was ok ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: It may be interesting for the declarer and defenders but not for aged BBO commentators.|pg||
nt|othered1: it was within the shapes he had shown.|pg||
nt|blunotte11: Qui ci puo' scappare il pareggio|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is interesting. I think it should make, also single dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: gazzilli sequence|pg||
nt|lestergold: another roalnd slam here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|wilkinsona:  that 3 spades looks better than the 1 heart bid found in OR...|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed, Hans|pg||
nt|hedyg: strong @c, weak 1 @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I assume a club lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c any gf?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@S never weak balanced in the system|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: bal or nat gf|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: ty Gio , i have a pd already :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: north on lead non lub 12 tops better than 12.85 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless 0-1 ctrl, don't know|pg||
nt|hedyg: no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hedy, difficult to say - they change frequently ... |pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: I think 4@S makes on any lead but a heart|pg||
nt|lml: its not that great a slam, it needs a bit|pg||
nt|hedyg: easy on @D lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2nt positive|pg||
nt|petergill: Re-opening Dbl could be light, so better to go via 2NT|pg||
nt|petergill: to invite I think|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3@c minimum with the other major|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|varange: 3@h anyone?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not me, not even if 2@D is not game-forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@h|pg||
nt|varange: ditto|pg||
nt|lestergold: but of coyurse in reality another dull flat board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer will duck this|pg||
nt|hedyg: might get a @H switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  doubling 4 diamonds was ok as well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even a double dummy low trump is not enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: it makes but surely not easy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem is: 2@S is forcing or not ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, but it's not a bad slam|pg||
nt|lml: well if you chose to take the heart finesse it is less than 50-50|pg||
nt|lml: the heart finesse by itself is 50|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On a trump lead, itÂ´s rather bad|pg||
nt|bridge_one: OK :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c= nat or any 16+, 2@d = 8+|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, to many doubtful honors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Never mind, he has nothing sensible to play if he wins|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why let the opponents go down, if you can do it yourself|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: @hQ 3rd in front.... and 12 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 2@H= @H + @c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, but also 5/4 and 12 hcp|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s is GF - otherwise 3@s directly over 2@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s would deny 8 hcps, np?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this 4@H means 6+5+ ( i think)|pg||
nt|hedyg: direct|pg||
nt|hedyg: Clair should pass|pg||
nt|hedyg: his hcps in @s and @d not good for his pd|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s over 2@c is inviting - so can have also 10 11bad - means not interest to know the hand of p|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I expect Fantunes to bid 6@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he would quite like a @S switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The problem is how to make it on the natural club lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: might lead @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: i know i would|pg||
nt|cuan: 2NT asks with good hand. 3@C = 4@H minimum, 3@H = limit|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: Adter you had East's hand on the previous deal, you now swap seats in Mike's club and get North's|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec says 13 tricks on minor suit squeeze|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  close match though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  overtricks may count...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poor partner |pg||
nt|Walddk2: So you always finesse his queen?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: Declarer can get rid of a heart loser and ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: you need to get rid of 2 @s losers|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, indeed. Yawn....|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Less than 4 tricks = impossible|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||

pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Losing two spades and one heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Singleton trump leads should be avoided|pg||
nt|varange: my partners never have that queen|pg||

nt|milton_se: probably, the Ds will set it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: this is the normal and best spot|pg||
nt|brolucius: South will have played the @DK at Trick 1.|pg||
nt|petergill: It means that both the Italians and Americans are great. There was only 2 hands between them in the Final in Sao Paulo.  The same American team easily won the Reisinger last week, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: maintaining the form. |pg||
pc|h3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphztg: no the J|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry|pg||
pc|cA|nt|henryb: 3N was a better contract. Again. 9 top tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: It was a clear error not to take the pitch right away|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|hedyg: short break?|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: we are ready now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|varange: @d now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: and @s back|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The last heart squeezes South|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt matter whether it squeezes him|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9@d is good when J10 drop|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he doesnt know that|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Small @S back will help East more than the Queen. East gets trouble now|pg||
nt|milton_se: not needed|pg||
nt|petergill: This will make 9 tricks, not 10, doesn't it? Or am I wrong?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: why not? does he not have the hand record? poor service|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kiwibridge: poor play here lucks in on the layout|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The point "I want to protect my diamonds" is not valid in my opinion. West is also short in diamonds. Since trumps rate to break 4-1, it is better to go for a tap|pg||
nt|varange: can still make if he drops the q@h|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North can NOT have the @D Ace|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: sure -- much safer, but no slam bonus|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|milton_se: did he really play the 10 of spades?|pg||

pc|h7|nt|bridge_one: yes :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphztg: y|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||

mb|1D|nt|wilkinsona:  yes, and I fancy a x of 4 diamonds really|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: We have seen it before, 5@D is actually the best game|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 1 entry to hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That was first hurdle - better let South be declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Trabucchi bids again, they will get doubled in anything|pg||
nt|milton_se: but probably not after that doubtful 3S bid|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With North as declarer, a lousy @D-lead kills the contract -|pg||
nt|hedyg: E must switch to @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @cA and a @d switch...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s is too passive|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Just guess the @H-suit, and you write 620|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now S has time to set up @h  after a correct guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no fantasy with that @s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot doublefinesse in @H, needs 2 entries for that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I normally say: If onlÃ¦y at least one of the opponentÂ´s hands is wide open (dummy) you should try to kill the contract|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think they can beat 4@S even with a bad guess because East will only get in once|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That East did NOT play @H, might signal having the King|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|othered1: prior to the 4 @S bid, what had east shown/denied in strength?|pg||
nt|varange: cheap round|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like " we are either too high or too low in 3 @s"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C lavinthal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if Lanzarotti cashes his other ace ...|pg||

nt|varange: no such luck|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

nt|wilkinsona:  thats at least 4/5 slam hands now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  No - not right - declarer ducks the 10 - and guesses the @H|pg||
nt|brolucius: West would need a special trump asking bid, to ask North how many trumps he held.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did he not have 9 top tricks with @DKx on?|pg||
nt|hedyg: off the Schneider|pg||
nt|mdgraham: six boards left....|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bridge_one: Lanzarotti can read doubleton in @H in South |pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: but as a kib notices S can duck a small @d|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it CAN be down|pg||
nt|xenya: double finesse in @H would be a normal play, but here declarer has only one entry to hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: but E can play J@D :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: You are speaking in Gaelic after drinking all that malt whisky.|pg||
nt|othered1: Do NS in OR normally lead A from !K?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because he does not have the hand record|pg||
nt|othered1: A from AK?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They might have done - and then not found the @S-switch. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: another hand in 5M in OR.  But they were focused on @D, so a good stop|pg||

nt|lml: I am not sure that I like using double to show majors over this 2NT bid.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Difficult for West|pg||
nt|lestergold: hcp division 20/20|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but i don't know if val magra means that|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bridge_one: @S 2/2 are terrible for N/S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DA, club switch|pg||

nt|bridge_one: Tuscany - north of tuscany|pg||
nt|othered1: Interesting 5-level decision opposite a weak NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no pollution - never !|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: maybe dbl should show a good balanced hand and 3@C and 3@D show majors with clubs showing better hearts|pg||
nt|henryb: as I said; perfect vision|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Forza Italia|pg||
nt|lml: etc|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I had choosen 5@h. there must be majors on E|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then after some time when Angelini was on lead with @SA he played another club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strange|pg||
nt|othered1: Save will mke it a little closer or, maybe, a lot closer if they go to 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did declarer not ruff a club he might have asked himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: never thought declarer would ruff a @c loser?|pg||
nt|milton_se: nice win if 6H now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: even 4@H without @D ruffs looks like a lot of work|pg||
nt|lml: anyway West would not be shut out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This lead you must ruff with the @H Ace!!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: or the 8 :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To show who is the king|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and I had also stretched to 6@c. at least as a save|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think anybody would be impressed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lml: 6@C must have been a consideration by south and it is right on the hand of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=14026  Andrea Manno|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@c on a @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@s was ON - so 4@h less one is a good result for N/S|pg||
nt|hedyg: -1? how?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H is carrying a reasonable principle too far. 11 loser hands should shut up unless prodded vehemently|pg||
nt|hedyg: by E ofc|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: i see -3 except for a miracle|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2down|pg||
nt|varange: wow|pg||
nt|petergill: Should be 110 or perhaps even 140|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: will play for long @ss in S playing A@s first|pg||
nt|lml: but then again you don't know they are making 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, 6@H won the board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it's only a matter of by how much|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass by Fantoni i think 0 or 2+defensive tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl would be one defensive trick|pg||
nt|varange: Manno's 4H bid - very nice|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but i amn't sure in this sequence ...|pg||
nt|othered1: Not over yet.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is over because North is on lead against spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol Fabio|pg||
nt|othered1: Pushing *these* guys around isn't easy.|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs to lead @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, Lanzarotti is a seasoned customer|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|sharkey: can ruff out @C 10 but short of entries...|pg||
nt|othered1: Lauria, of course, makes winning decision, only 4  imps away|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: Easier to play than to bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT must have been a raise in @c|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they dont play...just claim...1 trick in each suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: seems inefficient to give the opponents and easy 3@C cue-bid|pg||
nt|milton_se: Nunes can't know the value of the Cs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: if no @H lead only -1|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2down with @H lead|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  a transfer put the singleton diamond on lead in the other room|pg||

pc|d4|nt|vugraphztg: j @c?|pg||
nt|brolucius: The trouble with diet drinks is the disgusting artificial sweetener that they use. Why can't they just make some drinks which aren't sweet at all?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: why?|pg||
nt|xenya: by the sound of the auction 5@H has every chance i think|pg||
nt|varange: yes, think so|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 1 down|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: but probably Linda. No @c tricks in the defence|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henryb: 110 after the lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Club lead was too hard to find, and @C switch not easy to find|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: there was an American player who seemd to always play 5 of a major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Give the young man in the South seat a lot of credit for this big result|pg||
nt|varange: -2 leading the SINGLETON heart, Hedy?|pg||
nt|othered1: Neatly played the strain with no ruffs out|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  looks like the same 9 tricks..|pg||

nt|varange: I wonder what Versace may be thinking now|pg||
nt|brolucius: What an exaggeration...|pg||

nt|petergill: 11 hands in a row declared by EW|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Iff oponents play @H, all depends on the @S-handling|pg||

nt|petergill: Perhaps Lanzarotti was wondering about the passed hand jumping to 4@H, and thinking about partner having @SAK if declarer is 47 in majors|pg||

nt|othered1: found it|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: What's the problem? 13 easu tricks :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After the bidding - and the lead - South MUST have @S Ace|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: easy even|pg||

nt|petergill: Simon?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Alternatively, does declarer still have @S3?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|wilkinsona:  as you say Roland, no probs|pg||
nt|othered1: That changes things radically, so declarer now can just go about setting up @S for extra tricks|pg||

nt|bridge_one: gazzilli|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another opportunity|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Played from the other side, might this have a different outcome?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT will easily make - without a @D-lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni could have made it, but he did not know that a diamond duck was right at trick 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: sad really|pg||
nt|vincenzo: from the right side ..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that looks a bit thin for a strong club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DJ lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Trying to explain the previous board: Perhaps Lauria left the table as dummy and Versace reached over and pulled out the worng spade from dummy? Something like that did happen once ...|pg||
nt|petergill: before to this partnership|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: still my keyboard GAME!|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: everybody at the table except S "knew" what minor E held:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: fun to see North cards - he think East witt long @C :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: This should be good.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But OK - you must lead the @D 9 to keep South to 600|pg||
nt|hedyg: they seem to play 15+|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but each pair paly different gadgets ... |pg||
nt|hawe45:  West seem to have a natural @C-lead|pg||
nt|henryb: One of the good reasons not to play J denies.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Indeed Peter, and it cost them a trick.  One of the most costly tricks in history|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Monte Carlo Bermuda Bowl Final Italy vs USA?|pg||

mb|p|nt|vincenzo: wrong site ... sorry|pg||

nt|henryb: eight even|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: The previous hands may have influenced the bidding - boards 9 & 12|pg||
nt|xenya: doesn't 1@S shown number of controls?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1nt shows 4 controls|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c stayman|pg||
nt|hedyg: or more likely puppet|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so 10 tricks without J@D or 9@D lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: so double was takeout|pg||
nt|ritong: even with it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: which is unlikely|pg||
nt|othered1: or with it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D J = 630 |pg||
nt|hedyg: he just plays small and suit blocks?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C means 1) natural 11/16 @h @c or any 16+|pg||
nt|petergill: Win @CQ or play low?|pg||
nt|petergill: low, then spade to king, then heart to queen?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Queen might keep the entries going to the long spade?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I do think he will start on the hearts, finessing West for the jack|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Queen helps West to find the @D-switch|pg||
nt|petergill: Is there some deceptive way to play clubs, to minimize the chance of the unwanted @D switch?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh I see - so nine, covered with 10, etc?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East shall NOT cover an eventual @C 9!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What should that help?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Lauria hasn't missed a lead since 1969  .... so 40 years on we are lucky enough to see it|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe, we dont have their CC|pg||
nt|lml: I don't think so.  |pg||

nt|vugraphztg: 2nt : 3@h and max|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hedyg: should be 3 ctrols|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But who cares after that lead|pg||
nt|othered1: someone noticed :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think it makes little difference, if declarer plays West for @HJ, as he surely will|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: N was sure he had @Cs|pg||
nt|hedyg: so both N and S didnt know|pg||
nt|bridge_one: takeout, but i think with 2+@S - can play 2@S Dbled|pg||
nt|lestergold: but indeed who would?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@h means  <7 . sgl @s 4+@h|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fiori_Napoletano.txt|pg||

pc|sA|pc|c7|nt|hawe45:  claim, pls|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 or 0 tricks to the defence|pg||

nt|hedyg: sry commentators curse :(|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K in @c and !k better|pg||
pc|h8|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|hawe45:  Is the match over?|pg||

nt|hedyg: claiming 10?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i think s forgot the number of trumps played|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|lml: East doubled with his 5-4-4-0 but it was passed out and it was cold|pg||

nt|varange: somehow I think that Cameo took the 2NT as natural|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no no|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i talk with him|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3 boards and 7 imps|pg||
nt|bridge_one: otherwise to play natural is more effective|pg||
nt|hedyg: ask Papi :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|varange: in that case, I'm as lost as ever|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did he check back then I wonder|pg||
nt|varange: tx Simon|pg||
nt|brolucius: East likely to have something useful in diamonds when the hearts were so unevenly divided.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: :-)))))|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Mind you, Lauria also missed a defensive trick in 5@H doubled on board 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He got three hearts but did not seem to care|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: When he ruffed prematurely|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@d one major|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D multi|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3@d @H forcing|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This 3 NT is by far NOT hopelÃ¦ess|pg||
nt|othered1: Why was 3N down in OR?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  hopeless|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Papi love onle Woman Gazzilli :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  If you play small @C to the Queen|pg||
nt|petergill: Only 8 imps in it now. 18 boards to go in this 48 board semi-final, I think|pg||
mb|d|an|4+!s|nt|vugraphztg: 2@s : txs for 2nt or many distributions|pg||
mb|r|nt|petergill: A chance for EW to increase their lead slightly?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: Can be a IMP to gain for Serbia here. Even more if 6 is bidded and @D hitted. Exspext a flat board|pg||
nt|brolucius: Another splendid fit, this time for N/S.|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm 6S is a possible slam to bid with fair chances on a normal spade break|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6C??|pg||
nt|othered1: OH, did north find the @CQ play towards dummy?  that will hurt 2N on @S lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would think so - it seems a LONG way to 4@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh I wish I hadn't typed that!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easy lead after RD|pg||
nt|petergill: An advance sacrifice over the failing 4@H?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I quite like the convention where this redouble shows specifically honour-doubleton|pg||
nt|petergill: North needs to pass 4@S. |pg||
mb|5H|nt|wilkinsona:  slam time?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so one major or other type of strong hand, i think |pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: so 4@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@S better because you can sometimes discard a club on the 13th diamond.|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: they don't seem to use the 2@d as a game force checkback|pg||
nt|milton_se: over-aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like it Tony|pg||
nt|hedyg: no only 1 major over 1NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: depending on agreements - i prefere to play multi with only one major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All of a sudden Nunes can "see" the singleton heart in partner's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Henry your good at percentages what would u say here|pg||
nt|henryb: Trabucchi now ahead three boards to one|pg||
nt|lestergold: dims 3/3u dont have to ind the club q and two way search is better than 50% normally because of the info that gets picked up |pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, 4@S would have made, I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: @D ruffs could make this costly|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hawe45:  Strange to le the weak hand play!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  let|pg||
nt|henryb: 6@s is about 66%|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wilkinsona:  thought it was just a mater of 6 or 7|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 4@c : 5@h and 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: at least|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  thanks, Simon|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: after 2@s bid|pg||
nt|lml: not crazy about that bidding structure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On a @S-lead, "itÂ´s NOW"|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphztg: 3@s : txs for 3nt|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: so 6S is probably better than 50% slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: after @s lead playing A@C is tuff, if KJx in E no more entry to hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my J from Jxx not a success|pg||
nt|ritong: he has no entry to hand no matter what,after @c A|pg||
nt|ritong: so the best is @c to the 9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does the encyclopedia say|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks best, and pray|pg||
nt|hedyg: must keep communications open|pg||
nt|othered1: Encyclopedia doesn't have entry problems|pg||
nt|ritong: a kind of table presence problem imo|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think, this is a guess. @CV 2-2 works - and then only single @C K also|pg||
nt|hedyg: encyclopedia says play 5@c......|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: @c from dummy?|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|varange: so we have now identified two bridge players who actually have a life: Sabine and Papi :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S can make 4@h, but E/W make 4@S !|pg||
nt|othered1: That was ineffective|pg||
nt|henryb: Well now, I think N-S can barely make 3@h|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps Versace cannot risk playing @D's until after clubs? |pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: Will make if S ruffs 2@d on the table before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: might require careful handling|pg||
nt|othered1: In OR, west doubled 1@H opening, and did have support for other suits|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4H down on a S lead|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|ritong: @c to the Q wins stiff J|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The South hand does not have many entries. He may well play a club to the queen|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Somewhat lucky that Lauria does not have anything wasted in diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree with that double|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: is it clear to lead a heart? what about a club at trick 2?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West would try to give a constructive raise at 2@s - pass not the best|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud W cue 5@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: domani si riprende con il 2° tempo di semifinale alle 10.30|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: now the @d finess|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both suits (@S and @D) are placed in favor of declarer - who kan even afford to loose a @D-trick|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Ralf, that seems the best  plan|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps the only winning one|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Still 10 tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: That's not safe|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW feeling confortable ahead probably see no reson to gamble here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  maybe north told him about the diamond situation|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe just the 2-bid's preemption working|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb: even better because you might not get a heart lead!|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Lost some tempo now so max 11. Can become 10 and gain for Romania|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and will utter a silent curse|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe not so silent|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: why not @h to dummy and @c?|pg||
nt|othered1: against lesser opponents, @C guess might be easier to make|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: with this layout, the good move was cross to dummy with a @h, pplay a @c and duck the @c K|pg||
pc|d9|nt|brolucius: A 9-6 scoreline after 13 boards is not exactly a swingy set.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|irwinbo: club would work|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well i wasnt asking about what works, but what is right|pg||
nt|bridge_one: great Roland ! perfect italian !|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Back at 11|pg||
nt|ralfwil: trumps is best from W, but doesn´t help|pg||
nt|hawe45:  13th @C now - East discarding a @D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: me? no|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzzw: thank you for watching. Goodbye!!|pg||

nt|lestergold: now a possible granny|pg||
nt|lestergold: not of  course a good one|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but agree entries difficult|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Otherwise you may have no entry|pg||
nt|othered1: beating 4@S is non-trivial here, too.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I might make 9Â½ tricks in 4 @S|pg||
nt|othered1: ne3eded @C ruff to take trumps separately|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: well it was a normal distribution|pg||
nt|petergill: Unerring by West, as he can tell from Lauria's second Dbl that partner was likely to have @DA or @HA|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: and a handsome lead it is|pg||
nt|ritong: nice hands for the finish, anyway|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yo_yo: looks like 4@S should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: not more that 5@D for N/S|pg||
nt|othered1: not on @CA and another |pg||
nt|hawe45:  With the @C-ruff you defeat it|pg||
mb|1D|an|!h|nt|hawe45:  But 140 will bring them close|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and that's what was led  A@C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: if they get there|pg||
nt|varange: but we can rely on Fantunes to find at least one slam in the next two boards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thumbs down on the 1n opening :(|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: no 5 level|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec says Roland grabnd slam i say too good for roland grand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now 4@C usually played as a splinter, so East must look elsewhere.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  nice when partner opens and you have 4 Aces|pg||
nt|lestergold: however back in the land of reality this should be a flat 6H plus one in both rooms|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: and 4 card support|pg||
nt|ritong: pass by north is not super brave|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd bid 2@S on south hand, but I don't know how fisky north can be at these colors|pg||
nt|petergill: are NS playing the Nightmare System?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: He did - Lauria cud still have A or K |pg||
nt|ralfwil: even 4@h is too expensive - 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  800 - even shortly before Christmas|pg||
nt|marlowepi: substandard hearts and substandard spades for a 3H fit-jump, from a purist's perspective|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW not quite as active in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: Clair knows N is short in @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as most play, 2C in competition is not a GF, so then it would not be clear that this pass is forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: Franchi should have 4 @ss for his 3@H bid|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS may be shut out now...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Nt by North difficult to make 3Nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10.14 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  - if Souths bids on|pg||
nt|xenya: EW haven't discovered their true potential|pg||
nt|ralfwil: besides - I haven´t had a bid on N|pg||
nt|varange: I like the 1NT opening|pg||
nt|brolucius: Could just bid 6@H. I once had a partner who HATED leaps to the six-level. That made me do it even more often. |pg||
nt|henryb: another hand for fourth best!|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: the previous pass hoping in DBL in North and trasform give a problem to bid now|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot give up on the vulnerable game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: south pass ... could try a open 1Nt - 12 hcp|pg||
nt|henryb: or at least long suit|pg||
nt|petergill: Lanzaroti and Buratti were a top pair playing Nightmare System who got banned for a couple of years for wrong-doing, and now that they have returned I think they are not allowed to ...|pg||
nt|petergill: partner each other, but I'm not sure. |pg||
pc|hK|nt|varange: semi balanced: 7222, 6322 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The second double even more interesting|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most partnerships play that you are obliged to cue-bid the @DA on the West cards, even if you are minimum. With a second-round control you can sign off with a poor hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: I have a feeling that laria will have to steamroller this one to slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: For a flat board.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  this is probably enough negativity from west to avoid the making grand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: oh!|pg||
nt|hedyg: so new leader again..|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is expensive|pg||
nt|xenya: for an instant i thought EW got them...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wilkinsona:  does this have a chance, ...seems it might..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure you can go down when you are in 3|pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps that was tough the way the bidding went|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Vlad, W was not able to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can support later if partner will act|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would not be content with defending 2@S when opps are vulnerable?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, no grand, so East's 4@S suggests that he is not yet willing to bid even 6@H. |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|milton_se: finance crisis syndrome: not content with anything|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it could obviously go very wrong, but surely North had to double 3@D|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ritong: of course, doubling 3@d can generate a disaster, on the other hand north can envisage a @c SLAM, so he must bid imho|pg||
nt|petergill: You can scroll down to Nightmare at http://www.bridgeguys.com/NGlossary/GlossN.html if you are a system fanatic|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rocco47: 12 per Failla|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they play 2@c good hand - so 4@d is dangerous - better 3Nt or Dbl ?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|varange: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: Lauria will surely go now even if west 'signs off'|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: W has to give the k@s|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: now 5@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is a bit much on those moderate trumps. The @SK might be enough for West to bid 6@H, though.|pg||
nt|hedyg: why was a @H led in OR?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sharkey: We've said that before...|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually i think well bid by west|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  480 - last board|pg||
nt|xenya: easy 12 with 2-2 @Ss|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Even if he inserts the 10, which could have been right|pg||

pc|dT|nt|henryb: trying to be genius|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: To make Angelini stay in the match|pg||

mb|p|nt|varange: fantoni pushing hard in the bidding on brd 14|pg||
nt|xenya: nothing, really, 6@C is OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: The Law of Total Tricks often breaks down at the four and five levels - 11 + 9 trumps but 9 + 10 total tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Which two diamond losers if I may ask|pg||
nt|milton_se: nothing wrong at all, but South can't see it|pg||
