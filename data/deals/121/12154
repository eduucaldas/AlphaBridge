nt|yo_yo: he wont find the @D lead i guess|pg||

pc|d3|nt|wilkinsona: somewhat different auction to OR|pg||
nt|xenya: very different|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and north doubles for a club lead|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer can keep norths clubs out of the picture |pg||
nt|xenya: 3N does look a stretch, and N's double is --er -- a bit optimistic|pg||

nt|mmmakela: 3+2+3+1|pg||

nt|rednaxela: 'Only' needs the Q@c dropping and Hearts 4-4 now.|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|wilkinsona: we can see the cards, and south perhaps likely to have a singleton club after the x|pg||
nt|yo_yo: agree|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Mind you, he left himself with no entry for the Spade finesse.  Suppose North had covered the J@c?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 7@C?|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Ah, yes.  Still had a smaller pip.  Should have played the 8 or 9 under the Jack.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Gerald Tred working out the distribution|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks like a spade at trick 3, then|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: South deep in thought|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder what message @H 8  was?|pg||
nt|rednaxela: He may be wondering where declarer's high cards are for his 2NT.  Really needs a Diamond honour but wouldn't have played the suit that way if he had one.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bet @D 10 is coming|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: South's brow still furrowed|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Sime back in the lead.  5 imps on the previous board where 2@s went off against 1@s made at this table.|pg||

nt|yo_yo: 6@D?|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: oops..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: that pass by Bif...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...invites the wrong decision...|pg||

nt|yo_yo: Sanders is wondering what the pass meant|pg||
