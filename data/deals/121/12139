nt|hedyg: this is the tightest match of the round of 16|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't believe that Clair passed|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: wrong board|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe they are not playing this board at all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: wait a moment|pg||
nt|hedyg: Carlo would not open 1NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1NT not exactly textbook either|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like they turned the board|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe "tightest match" meant...|pg||
nt|hedyg: closest score Marshall|pg||
nt|hedyg: might a free translation from French|pg||
nt|Walddk2: wronf file it seems. open room operator shut down|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: 2 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: hi everyone from a foggy, freezing Manchester|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looking at the NS hands, 6@C is not so unreasonable |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 6@C is pretty good and preemption might boost them into it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nothing new there then|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Yes nightmer|pg||
nt|milton_se: buying this cheaply|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: But it's awkward to bid 5@C now since partner will think opener has more hearts|pg||
nt|henryb: Have Fantunes changed system? The last time I watched them they played forcing one bids and 10-13 two bids|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No change there|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they're in the open room:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might take the money here|pg||
nt|hedyg: double passed out by Versace|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|othered1: Do we know if 2@C is natural?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: GF|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks natural|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would be tempted to bid 5@D with an 8 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Takes a very good defence to defeat 6@C|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: E-W play Angelini's version of Precision|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wilkinsona:  canape sequence from north it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1any has always been forcing, 14+   and 2any  10-14|pg||
nt|henryb: Ah, but we do not have Fantunes|pg||
nt|brolucius: South can discount a slam since they play a strong 1@C system.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: @d lead?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well as cards lie 6 of a red looks pretty good|pg||
nt|lestergold: not suggesting it should be bid!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Notice the canapé style of N-S. So Blue Club it is, Simon?|pg||
nt|othered1: Old-fashioned forcing 2N would describe south's hand well, too.|pg||
nt|hedyg: guess he already showed that with 4 @d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is a very interesting match|pg||
pc|s6|nt|milton_se: not a double?|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N looks fairly cold also|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N+2 looks likely at both tables|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: after this board, i'll ask them|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wilkinsona:  this might go ddown..|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like off 4?|pg||
nt|varange: do you know much about NS Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S with four cards is somewhat dangerous when you know that partner has close to nothing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DA and another is the only defence|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|othered1: What would be the effect of @CK under the ace?|pg||
nt|othered1: @DK, rather|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We shall see|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Drop the King, South|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1st hurdle overcome by Giubilo, but then what?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: would be a good play. South must be aware of extreme diamond length|pg||
nt|varange: hi Giorgio|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me find a Nightmare CC|pg||
nt|varange: the lastest version please Roland, not the old one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Roland|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: No, I don't know them|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: At least|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 1@H showed @s|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing a standard system, South would have to bid 2@D (fourth suit) at his second turn, in case North was strong and a slam was a good bet.|pg||
nt|bardo: 3 sa anche in aperta|pg||
nt|henryb: Playing a standard system North would open 1@c, S 1@d, N 1@H, S 1@s, N 2@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: here is a nightmare CC http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf    this is what they play, more or less|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: might depend on EW's carding agreements|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, especially when Cs may be an option|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The king would not help against good defenders as East would follow with the 10 from 108x|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Full credit to Giubilo regardless. Very well done!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyway, down now. Unlucky.|pg||
nt|othered1: Right, can't do better than make winning decision|pg||
nt|hedyg: so as usual Versace made the right decision|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|hedyg: 1NT was a stronger  NT than 15/17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I could think of a few puns with South's name involved :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course at tis stage declarer cannot be sure of hs contract]|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: More if declarer isn't careful|pg||
nt|brolucius: If the @S2 was indeed led from a 4-card suit (which is a good bet if 4th-best leads are in operation), declarer would know that the contract was safe. He could lose no more than ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: three spades and the @CK. By playing the @SJ, he breaks communications when West has five spades. |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Same lead against 6 NT - and Soiuth can make it double-dummy|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|varange: :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphztg: no 15-17|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice 10@s in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  There is a danger in the @C-suit, if North tries some safety-play - and East plays the Jack. Might give North bad plans.|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Simon, i thought you said they play strong NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: hi|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona:  ok,....ddddown|pg||
nt|sharkey: Lauria knows pd is void in @S as wud have played Q from QJ|pg||
nt|varange: no limericks please!|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: and he did have 19 hcps|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yeah, cause usually who plays strong @c play weak nt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems very logical|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wilkinsona:  lucky we can see all the hands and know that every card is right|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: East still has a spade, so the suit will be 4-4 (unless West found an unlikely lead from a 3-card suit into a bid suit).|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Nightmare was wrote for Buratti - Probably now they will play different gadgets, but the base of system is for sure the same of book|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: this club suit aint coming in|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|varange: no easy exit available, is there?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, S is sort of endplayed|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: west about to have his 2h promoted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria knows the whole hand now and will pitch a diamond|pg||
nt|sharkey: In OR E overcalled 1@S thus N not subjected to the pressure bid 4@S - so no sacrifice|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
mc|9|nt|Walddk2: It's a fine system. I like that 18-19 balanced is included in the 1@D opening|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt weak, so 1@c can be 15/17 bal - 1@C can have 11hcp with 6@c 5x ! or any 15+ with 4+@C|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Nunes is out of table|pg||
nt|bridge_one: thie the old version - they change frequently the sequence, overall when change the partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  1M  ;  1NT  18-19   much better than the awkward jump to 2NT|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H can be 4 cards in 3 suit hand|pg||

mb|4H|nt|lestergold: 3N should go off on careful defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: but might it now before pd leads a @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: nope|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1nt possible, 2Nt long to make - so 2@s open would work here|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: uwelcome|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d played in EW|pg||
nt|othered1: I couldn't stay out if they had bid the pointed suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 14 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|varange: amaazing layout|pg||
nt|yo_yo: dicing with death|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: nko reason for the stiff KC to be found|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To me Easts hand more looks like a @C-@d reverse hand - no intermediates for NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: did u mean to say that the bridge wa pretty awesome?|pg||
nt|othered1: Here's Masselli's 2-suited bid -- bid them both.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: and the lead would be @S, not @c|pg||
nt|milton_se: oops|pg||
nt|varange: ouch|pg||
nt|brolucius: West is (much) too good to bid 4@S, so he marks time with the fourth suit. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: West's hand is suited for a strong jump shift at his first turn, but no-one plays those any more I guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 2@S and then 4@S, to show a great suit but not many controls.|pg||
nt|daman: very oxymoronic|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems, that only South is vulnerable...!|pg||
nt|hedyg: no entry to the S hand for a @H finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: can doublefinesse in both black suits|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@h with maximum .... strange|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Rehi, everyone!|pg||
nt|hedyg: re Ed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: technically is correct to play double finesse - so 4@h made|pg||
nt|varange: hi Ed|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: I am Fabio not Simon :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: seems 2@H was forcing..|pg||
nt|xenya: a wheel came off?|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh sry Fabio!|pg||
nt|hedyg: ciaooooo!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: we have changed|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ciaooo|pg||
pc|h7|nt|wilkinsona:  unless its led|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  even when I do play em I can't get my partners to use them|pg||
nt|lestergold: this must mean please make a cue bid pard|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: We often see the weak jump shift mis-used on BBO VuGraph, so perhaps better to play strong jump shifts, even if you never use them.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|varange: two|pg||
nt|milton_se: nice to agree on what´s forcing :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so i see!|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sharkey: Assuming a @S lead dont think you need @C finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: here declafrer can afford the safety play|pg||
nt|hedyg: not really enough for reverse|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure - but minimum!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The @H-suit brings this 3 NT safely home|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a @s lead...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Whatever lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: guess @h help the declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: now he needs to ask for another one!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: lauria is a good soldier:)|pg||
nt|henryb: Its not that uncommon to play strong JS at the two level in a 2/1 structure|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S is forcing because it was preceded by the fourth-suit bid.|pg||
nt|lestergold: but Lauria with massive controls will soon get the message] |pg||
nt|brolucius: West might 'invent' 4@D, to see if East has a heart control.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i agree|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: it's the winning bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: not actually easy to bid this hand|pg||
nt|henryb: look how easy this hand is after 1@d-2@s: East splinters with 4@h and West bids Backwood|pg||
nt|brolucius: Obviously does not show a diamond control, when bid so slowly... |pg||
nt|Walddk2: West in the other room could not be 100% certain that they had a heart control between them|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sometimes you have to lie:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: going for the throat|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow a rare thing to see 2 @H X|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Back in the match|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: but we were deprivd of watchi9ng for it|pg||
nt|hedyg: and a @d switch..|pg||
nt|othered1: avoided trump lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - but created by NorthÂ´s bidding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ok - 3@h is 4 cards with minimum, can be 14 only with 4333 - right - agrre the gadget|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: in open room the heart barrage by n/s identified the heart shortnes to west|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  well bid 4 hearts, thats good lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: Lauria cannot/willnot pass with this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Long pause then 4@S is not really the way to bid the hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S seems a bit risky on those values.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  YES - take @S Ace and play @H|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: cambiaghi apologize for his bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: franco saved him|pg||
nt|xenya: this one might not be easy|pg||
nt|irwinbo: he will now make it|pg||
nt|hedyg: actually the @c gave nothing, declarer would have played small @c to jack|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for sure - also more that one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Irwin :)|pg||
nt|varange: and then to not forget :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be OK after a jump shift but West has not really suggested full slam values, just because he bid 3@S.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D does not help Giubilo one bit|pg||
nt|lestergold: still hard here how does west know that Lauria hasnt got two small hearts now?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: at least South turned up with 3 nice @H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Right defence means 500|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: so 2 @H was nf?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: indeed - and here it will be difficult to get a @C ruff|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: West correctly assumes that East must have a heart control for his strong bidding with nothing in trumps.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 4@S denied a red cue bid (I assume it did), 5@D should also promise a heart control|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: without club lead declarer can afford to bang down club ace before leading up to it to cater for the KC stiff|pg||
nt|xenya: not clear what happened -- any ideas?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wilkinsona:  has east not shown 5 diamonds 4clubs and 3 spades, perhaps|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sharkey: 1 IMP back here|pg||
nt|brolucius: With a singleton heart in dummy, South's signal should be suit-preference - not that it makes any difference here.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|varange: maybe some misunderstanding of what 2@d means|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not think he has said anything about club length it was just a cue|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Well defended, West|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 14 is their maximum Gio!|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT is 12.14|pg||
nt|varange: yes, but he has 4333|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, maximum only with 4333|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphztg: y|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: pass or correct|pg||
nt|xenya: he chose a wrong plan it seems|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Simon :) you are the best!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Listen: We have 4 @H, 3 @C + 2 ACES - here in Denmark the total is 9|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but how do you know you have 4 hearts?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That combines 3-3 @H OR 3-3 @C - not so bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 2@C did, Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I think Lauria has shown 3154|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d8|nt|hedyg: you play A@H and @H ducked and then?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I puy my money on West|pg||
nt|hedyg: small @s|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  More @h|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bridge_one: otherwise minimum|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: sry - push|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d3|pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: only if you can see through the cards|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|xenya: you lose 2 hearts if they are 4-2 and 3 spades then|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now only 200|pg||
nt|othered1: I like that equation (4-3-3-3 with minimum)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this table is interesting to see the new style in bridge - Fantoni Nunes invention is 2 level open for any 5+cards 10/12|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot doublefinesse @S now|pg||
nt|hedyg: so must guess|pg||
nt|milton_se: that 3rd club seems to be a mistake|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Lanzarotti use many interesting gadget (1@H 1@S with or withour 4cards, jump in xfert for majors, 1M 3minor = limit 6in minor and 4cards in other major, etc.)|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4H infran|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To whom belongs the 5-level?|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS play weak NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: weak NT (may be not vuln, o am not sure if they play weak Nt also vul)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Accurate bidding is so much easier when there is no director present.|pg||
nt|lestergold: this not quite as good a slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the open room E-W are in 4@SX|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is a very strong weak NT|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: Looks like 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this colour that will not bea great success|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: both of pairs|pg||
nt|hedyg: @H suit got lost|pg||
nt|hedyg: W could double 1@s and correct a @c bid by pd to @d|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: EO to play, NS defense|pg||
nt|brolucius: If declarer is in a high heart contract, the odds favour playing East for the @HQ after West's overcall.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt weak but can be also with 5 Major|pg||
nt|hedyg: 11-14 NT|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sharkey: Makes played by E - otherwise has to guess @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be the first swing board|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  but 5 hearts went -2 OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe trying to make 5 lost an extra trick|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the pass of north natural - strange playing weak nt|pg||
nt|milton_se: now already too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: W is endplayed|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks normal to me, just maximum|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sharkey: assume misguessed @S - finesse |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: maybe dim lead took spade finesse? to pitch dim??|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  appears to be so|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no i 'm wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll take my 800 any day of the week|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like about 9 imps to angelinin|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: hope they get to 5@H as 4@H not too interesting...:)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: W seam end playd from the start of hand :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: needed to grab the lead in dummy and finesse spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: auction in open was kamikazi|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  seems that north left a bit unsaid in the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14.7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=KQx+Axx+xx+AJ9xx|pg||
nt|othered1: strange for north to make a try opposite 11-14|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: well im urprised on tehse values that e/w felt they could afford a slam investigation to 5 level|pg||
nt|hedyg: if  he played Q@s before @c and KJ are in N and @cs dont work he is down?|pg||
nt|milton_se: needs an optimistic mind :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no chance for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Angelini's 4@C next door is not easy to understand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: His hand has defence written all over it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona:  diamond lead, ruffing spade hook diamond pitch and led a club up allowing a ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very expensive foray that was|pg||
nt|brolucius: He did, but they play a strong 1@C, so South could not be that good.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  Whar is East looking for here? I would stupidly bid 4 @s|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|xenya: well he has not made it yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bidding 4 over 3 is almost always wrong|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wilkinsona:  ..not so sure..|pg||
nt|irwinbo: a hheart was the best lead  hard for west except that he then doesn't lead away from an aq combination|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|hedyg: the correct contract could be 3NT or 5 @c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I guess it depends if West is allowed to rebid 1NT with a 1444 shape|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe they are allowed to rebid 1N with stiff @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good reason|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|xenya: now he has|pg||
nt|othered1: Depending on what redouble means, I'm not sure that 3@C is intuitive either|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: not more that 6 tricks for defence|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|varange: now the finesse|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might as well try a club. Why not?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: an expense of 13 imps|pg||
nt|xenya: the 2@S in the OR looks even more hopeless, yet it was made|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@ss on @h and claim 12|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: @c is his only hope now|pg||

pc|dT|nt|bridge_one: after initial Dbl the play is easy for declarer - A@S in W is like sure|pg||

mb|d|nt|wilkinsona:  Lauria played carefully just to lose 2 clubs|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Natural|pg||

nt|wilkinsona:  first diamond bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: e4spwecially if they splinter a diamond void instead of a heart void|pg||
nt|bridge_one: interesting convention - 2x over 1nt = x+1 suit or x+2/x+3 two suit hand - ungherese convention|pg||
nt|bridge_one: suction - corect|pg||
nt|bridge_one: correct|pg||
nt|othered1: so I assume 2@H is choice of major promising @D fit,if that's what north has|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@h means @D fit|pg||
nt|othered1: this does give opponents lots of information about both hands, if it can be of use|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D relay, 2@H singleton spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: likely to be bid here also now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: the safe contract, but @hA is on side, so the problem is to find 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS system : http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fiori_Napoletano.txt|pg||

nt|yo_yo: what's their NT opener?|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|lestergold: in open fantunes got there not opening with north but responding to takeout double with 4S as anobvious bid in that sequence|pg||
nt|lestergold: here is not so clearcut|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid 3@s over that or forcing 3@D|pg||

mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: I use 2nt after 2@s as forcing|pg||

nt|yo_yo: mike do you remember  when we could now jump to 4@C to show this hand?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice if you can bid 3@c natural and forcing here|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i cant remember the name of the convention, sharples?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2! ask|pg||
nt|othered1: or any bid (2@S?) to turn auction forcing and looking for minors|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: cause 2@h is @h or something artifical|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: he'll be pleased to see Qxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  well south can upvalue now with the heart bid on the right|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3nt was alerted|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N looks like a sensible alternative. Also 11 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i bet this hyand wont produce a swing|pg||
nt|hedyg: there it is|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl by North means 15+|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: good point|pg||
nt|sharkey: also assume opening Multi VUL promise a decent suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure if that was Sharples, but then I never played it, so I don't know, really|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @C is good, either @H Ace in North - or two @H-ruffs will make it a winner|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure how they got there|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: amazing stop here, how did they manage that?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 16 IMPs on board 4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: so we will assume it showed @ss|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3nt 5@s and 3@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: @SQ-x-x was not enough for North to bid 3NT on his own, so he bids the hearts one more time. (Particularly as the opening bid promised only four cards).|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  maybe 12 tricks..|pg||
nt|henryb: have you started drinking already?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hawe45:  The wrong hand is playing here - most of us bid 2 NT as East - after pdÂ´s 2 @C|pg||
nt|xenya: not clear|pg||
nt|xenya: they might regret that|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like 9 tricks if he continues @S or not|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With West as declarer, 3 NT has problems|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3nt like a xfert - In Italy we have hight invention :)|pg||
nt|irwinbo: nice lie of the cards  making 5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so presumably 3S would relay to 3N, either to play or to show a minor-oriented slammish hand?|pg||
nt|hedyg: very few top players play 3 NT as natural nowadays|pg||
nt|brolucius: Who, me?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Lauria u reckon gonna go to bed with one of  his bullets?|pg||

nt|othered1: assuming you can pick up trumps|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

pc|h2|nt|hedyg: knocking out pd's entry..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - lay-down in both positions|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H showed  4 cards or maximum, 2@s relay, 3@c showed 4-4 @H+@c|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: 3@d probably asked about strength, 3@H mini|pg||
nt|hedyg: so closed in 3NT|pg||

nt|bridge_one: yes Hedy|pg||

nt|hedyg: 10@D?|pg||
nt|othered1: nothing too easy for east|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Declarer draws trumps immediately, hoping to educate his partner (who ran into so many ruffs last time he played a heart contract).|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  diamond now, then ruff out the club Q|pg||
nt|henryb: He might hold himself to 10|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|hedyg: is this for real?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as long as W has 3+ diamonds this is cold i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: he needed to play @s from dummy twice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why?|pg||
nt|hedyg: will only make 10 tricks now i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do you mean hearts?|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry yes @H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: distraction dy declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: misclick|pg||
nt|lestergold: club q has gone which malt are you on?|pg||
nt|othered1: That looks best|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if pitching @S m ight not have been better.|pg||

nt|othered1: that|pg||
nt|othered1: is a great reading.  Not sure it's clear at the table|pg||
nt|milton_se: not working though -- S shift and D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|irwinbo: he should have won the third spade in dummy and led a heart|pg||
nt|bridge_one: try 10 in @D down - @D 3/3 near to be impossible - must take the chance to leave the @D at opps that will take in @h|pg||
nt|hedyg: @s shift and 10@d|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but playing that way risks going down in cold contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless i am crazy, always a live possibility|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: this is called relay stayman, was popular when Lauria first started playing bridge|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A in @c, @C ruff and @d - the contract is sure with @D 3/3 or 4@D in West |pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@C denies|pg||
nt|lestergold: glenfidditch?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: Ruffing our @CQ does not help a lot as long as the 9 is higher than the 8. I think they play by that rule in Italy|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  sorry, played the J of clubs already|pg||
nt|hawe45:  520|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: hello Linda|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 2@d was ok with the mini hand , still in forcing. but 2NT is strange if not forcing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this line work the same - if @d 3/3 @C @C ruff @h|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if @D 4 in West work|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if 4@D in East they are a problem with both play|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
nt|hedyg: now @H endplays H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: Isn´t 2nt from E an underbid? For me shows 2@d minimum, so nothing more than 3nt can be actual|pg||

nt|othered1: as @D is conceding|pg||

nt|milton_se: 50 per cent though -- any black lead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: and West could have passed if it was appropriate from his hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me 2nt in this sequence is forcing and shows a 4-card support and @c control and 3@c the same without a @c control|pg||
nt|othered1: @C6 could be a threat|pg||
nt|hedyg: did N really bid X with 6 @hs? he must work this out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D Ace and a @d - the roof comes down|pg||

nt|hedyg: 1@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If South had passed at his second turn, I think 4@S would go down|pg||
nt|hedyg: E 2@c, S pass|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: very well !|pg||
nt|varange: :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: surely with K@D Manno would have played @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last time Fulvio missed a defence was Aug 7, 1993|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|lestergold: spec asks what exactly did the 1 spade bid mean|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H seems clear to me. taking the save is not so clear. EW might have only 8 spades, and 3D did not necessarily show 5-5. S has defense and N has no shortness. also, it is not clear ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at all--to me, anyway--whether the pass over 4S is, or should be, forcing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 1@S Roland not so sure declarer can't read the same the hands - with 6@h with one+ honor few don't bid 2@h over 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|Walddk2: forcing? even thinking about it is an overbid|pg||
nt|irwinbo: when he draws trump, south's hand will count out|pg||
nt|hedyg: are you sure he missed it then?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: apparently equivalent to a negative double but without holding 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: dbl without spades|pg||
nt|varange: you never know your luck in a big city :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not in a three set match, surely|pg||
nt|othered1: Passing these cards out at multiple tables is unlikely|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: yep|pg||

nt|mdgraham: no|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't and likely would also pass north's hand, but that is close|pg||

mb|1D!|an|!h|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has the best hand from the three "openers"|pg||

nt|hedyg: 1@D=@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Transfer responses|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: EW had better keep low on this one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - the xfert over 1@C open work very well|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can be also 11 with 6@C 5any|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Well bid by Fantunes to reach top spot|pg||
nt|hedyg: anybody bid 3@c with the S hand over 1@s?|pg||
nt|irwinbo: not me|pg||
nt|hedyg: i find it very tempting|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|milton_se: 1NT 14-16?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 14 Pearson Points|pg||
mb|1N|an|4!s|nt|wilkinsona:  yep 5 diamonds is great|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A heart lead dooms the contract because West must get in with @DQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer does not have enough tricks without diamonds|pg||
nt|varange: probably|pg||
nt|xenya: well now a spade lead looks like a killer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Lauria likes his 10s|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: okok so i am alone :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid 2C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes Hedy, alone :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poor defence in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spade to the ace and another. At least East could have ashed a top heart first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: cashed even|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, even on a spade continuation, where is the 9th trick?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South know the shortness in @D in North|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can caount 2 down with his hand|pg||
nt|othered1: so the third best hand opens 4th seat.|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has 11|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pearson points  what are those?|pg||
nt|hedyg: and 2 10s!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: normal hcp + spade length|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NO - the best of the three!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@h not 4 cards - |pg||
mb|2S|an|4!S 3!h|nt|hawe45:  I DO hope, that South is NOT thinking of any bid but PASS|pg||
nt|hedyg: more imps to Angelini|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|bridge_one: pass because the chance to beat 4@s is hight with K in @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1nt relay - could pass witt not interesting hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT= 4 @s?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1nt 4@s, sry |pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Fabio :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh, East endplayed himself|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A in @H in North instead A in @d with K in @c (probably after 4@c) is down before to start|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am sure he would like to forget this deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: I thought that was a Reese thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: East had a pretty clearcut pass of 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb: even so, why bid Stayman with North's 4-3-3-3 and extra values|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT is a better game, strangely on a 5-4 heart fit.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@d one 5 major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they play Blue Club, they can only have a 5-card major if maximum (15-16)|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho interesting point here is that 9 cold top tricks in 3n and 4H is only about a 50 percenter|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@h ask the major|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2nt...@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: complete duplication|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: So which system is it, Simon; did you ask?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer may attempt some sort of elimination play, to avoid the club finesse.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: like a roman club|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  yep elimni on after the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: and if it wasnt on he would have a fat chance of catchinmg Lauria napping|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would need to eliminate diamonds and exit on the third round of spades - not much of a chance.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  but th spade 9 is in play now is it not?|pg||
nt|othered1: 1.5 quick tricks, no aces, opposite a passed hand?  Not close to best|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, 1@S would have the same logic that 1@h 1@s (denie @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 1Nt will be played fron strong site|pg||
nt|hedyg: no system is perfect|pg||
nt|hedyg: and he already knew about @H fit so np|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but to play 1nt from right site help , ovrall in MP competition|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is not Roman Club for several reasons. 1NT shows 17-20 in RC, and opening 3-card suits is normal|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he was always playing in a major, either 4@H or 4@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: and always rightsided|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|xenya: not that other let it through though|pg||

mb|5C|nt|hedyg: on @H lead?|pg||
nt|lml: 6nt has 3 heart 3 spades 2 clubs and 4 diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best contract is 6 NT by East - extremely unlucky|pg||
nt|lml: maybe not|pg||
nt|xenya: but the defence will get 2 tricks earlier|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6nt is only on a squeeze, but N will return a @c to break it|pg||

nt|hedyg: unlikely N leads  @C vs 6NT? S did not double 3 @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: there is a good chance you will be on lead|pg||

nt|hedyg: he could have bid differently|pg||
mb|p|an|better|nt|bridge_one: 6 more points in the majors suit in west - easy for east go to slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: you might do it double dummy|pg||

mb|6D|nt|hedyg: now?|pg||
nt|lml: it does have to be played by east|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my experience the danger of such overcalls is greatly exaggerated when pd is a passed hand, we are NV, and RHO has not yet spooken|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  made in OR by simply playing towards the heart Q|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So spades mentioned for the first time at the 6-level!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 4 diamond minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 5nt choose the major|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, i might be on lead. but there is probably an equal chance that psrtner will be on lead if they bid a game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would rebid my @h over 3@c |pg||
nt|irwinbo: me too|pg||
nt|hedyg: with @s fit?|pg||
nt|hedyg: when do you show fit?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, bec @S fit work the same|pg||
nt|hedyg: you might be searching for a new pd|pg||
nt|bridge_one: find: Irwin :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  right sided it seem, as a club lead from south...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Is it obvious this makes - or some choices to be made?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't matter with trumps 3-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leading towards @HQ seems best, but even if it loses, there are certain squeeze chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: if you play the @SA first and see the split West has to split spades when you lead to the queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Whatever the lead - both slams are doome to go down. A 3-years old monkey would find the @C-switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The opponents have not shown a fit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: you can strip him and throw in on @CK|pg||
nt|xenya: well bid|pg||
nt|lml: he will have to lead a spade from the 10xx|pg||
nt|hedyg: after loosing A@H?|pg||
nt|lml: but that is completely hypothetical|pg||
nt|hedyg: no throwins in 12 LOL|pg||
nt|lml: oh sorry silly me|pg||
nt|irwinbo: llook at the bidding in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe @c discard better|pg||
nt|varange: he might have felt the need to show a suit before the bidding got too high, with the pass in West showing a wide range (0-7)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hawe45:  Then North ducks ONE @h-round|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This might bring in 12 tricks, playing the @dÂ´s from hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: he treated this hand as 25 balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: lauria prefer to bid a balanced hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Because he plays them better than most|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c puppet, 3@d 1 or 2 4 card majors|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: lead 4th|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think, that the two black doubletons are bad values - so never 25 for me|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass over 5@c was a better hand than 5 @D |pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: only @s lead could save them|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: tell Lauria?|pg||
pc|dA|mc|12|nt|lml: this obviously has no play on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six flat boards out of 7 so far. Only the 9-IMP swing when E/W went for 800 in 4@S at the other table.|pg||
nt|lestergold: we are losing kibs at a rate of knots because of the dullness of the deals|pg||
nt|henryb: Would be a boring set at point-a board|pg||

nt|bridge_one: Yes Ed, east know impossible to find A K K K - with this point the open was 1@D|pg||

nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ItÂ´s just swedish...!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hedy, a p could be also Marshall - so i am at two :) can you look to find one for you ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on the first hand the D tap means you cant make 6S if E has Kxx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he endplayed himself instead of North|pg||
nt|milton_se: will still be endplayed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, if he cashes @CA first he has the tempo|pg||
nt|brolucius: When all is said and done, a 2@D contract is a 2@D contract.|pg||
nt|henryb: you just don't have the matchpoint virus|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  spec says that some commentators need livening up|pg||
nt|lestergold: its the hands that need livening up-|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's diamond lead, on the last hand, broke up the squeeze that a kibitzer noted.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  note the 2clubs cracked from the open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland has failed to hack into the dealing bot today|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 24.55|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=KJ+AQJx+AKxxx+AQ|pg||
nt|othered1: Or could west not hold the @DK, still 13 tricks with major K's?|pg||
nt|hedyg: with a good 12/13 they open 1x, A K K K would be good|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: NS have a chance to regain |pg||
nt|bridge_one: give the 2 cards in @h is important !|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: However, 4@S can be defeated on best defence|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  needs a punt|pg||
nt|hedyg: we all have 1 like that|pg||
nt|hedyg: or give him KQ10xx - Kxx AKQxx|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 7@d with all good impasse|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|Walddk2: I confess that it's impossible for West to find the heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@s 4 cards, canapé|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hawe45:  Easy to make - difficult to bid = 6 @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: i.e. can have longer minor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why is that hand a problem? we will always reach spades with that hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D is acceptable|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing more|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 7 cause i see cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Can 4@S be defeated without @H lead?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 3@H was ok ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: It may be interesting for the declarer and defenders but not for aged BBO commentators.|pg||
nt|othered1: it was within the shapes he had shown.|pg||
nt|blunotte11: Qui ci puo' scappare il pareggio|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is interesting. I think it should make, also single dummy|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphztg: gazzilli sequence|pg||
nt|lestergold: another roalnd slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  that 3 spades looks better than the 1 heart bid found in OR...|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed, Hans|pg||
nt|hedyg: strong @c, weak 1 @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I assume a club lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c any gf?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@S never weak balanced in the system|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: bal or nat gf|pg||
mb|2N|an|minim|nt|hedyg: ty Gio , i have a pd already :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: north on lead non lub 12 tops better than 12.85 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless 0-1 ctrl, don't know|pg||
nt|hedyg: no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hedy, difficult to say - they change frequently ... |pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think 4@S makes on any lead but a heart|pg||
nt|lml: its not that great a slam, it needs a bit|pg||
nt|hedyg: easy on @D lead?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|varange: 3@h anyone?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not me, not even if 2@D is not game-forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@h|pg||
nt|varange: ditto|pg||
nt|lestergold: but of coyurse in reality another dull flat board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer will duck this|pg||
nt|hedyg: might get a @H switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  doubling 4 diamonds was ok as well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even a double dummy low trump is not enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: it makes but surely not easy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem is: 2@S is forcing or not ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, but it's not a bad slam|pg||
nt|lml: well if you chose to take the heart finesse it is less than 50-50|pg||
nt|lml: the heart finesse by itself is 50|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On a trump lead, itÂ´s rather bad|pg||
nt|bridge_one: OK :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c= nat or any 16+, 2@d = 8+|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, to many doubtful honors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Never mind, he has nothing sensible to play if he wins|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: @hQ 3rd in front.... and 12 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 2@H= @H + @c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, but also 5/4 and 12 hcp|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s is GF - otherwise 3@s directly over 2@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s would deny 8 hcps, np?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this 4@H means 6+5+ ( i think)|pg||
nt|hedyg: direct|pg||
nt|hedyg: Clair should pass|pg||
nt|hedyg: his hcps in @s and @d not good for his pd|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s over 2@c is inviting - so can have also 10 11bad - means not interest to know the hand of p|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I expect Fantunes to bid 6@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he would quite like a @S switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The problem is how to make it on the natural club lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: might lead @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: i know i would|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Adter you had East's hand on the previous deal, you now swap seats in Mike's club and get North's|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec says 13 tricks on minor suit squeeze|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  close match though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  overtricks may count...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poor partner |pg||
nt|Walddk2: So you always finesse his queen?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Declarer can get rid of a heart loser and ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: you need to get rid of 2 @s losers|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, indeed. Yawn....|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Less than 4 tricks = impossible|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: cannot ruff on @d lead|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Losing two spades and one heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Singleton trump leads should be avoided|pg||
nt|varange: my partners never have that queen|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: and @s back|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The last heart squeezes South|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt matter whether it squeezes him|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9@d is good when J10 drop|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he doesnt know that|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  Small @S back will help East more than the Queen. East gets trouble now|pg||
nt|milton_se: not needed|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: why not? does he not have the hand record? poor service|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kiwibridge: poor play here lucks in on the layout|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The point "I want to protect my diamonds" is not valid in my opinion. West is also short in diamonds. Since trumps rate to break 4-1, it is better to go for a tap|pg||
nt|varange: can still make if he drops the q@h|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: sure -- much safer, but no slam bonus|pg||
pc|sK|nt|milton_se: did he really play the 10 of spades?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphztg: y|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bridge_one: A K and J 10 @h make game !|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: If E, the owvecaller has @SAQ declarer's play is ok - a @D can be pitched on @C|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

nt|Walddk2: No-one expects Pescara to win this match. You don't get many opportunities against these guys, so when you get one, like here, you simply must take advantage to stand any chance|pg||

nt|bridge_one: the only chance is to find Qx in @h out !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in finesse isn't suffcient|pg||
nt|milton_se: also trumps 3-2, pitching Hs on Ds|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm talking about the position he was in after playing @S to K|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after A K in @S know @S are 4/1 ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nunes will open 1@C, then let's see if Lanzarotti can bid clubs naturally|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  yes, and I fancy a x of 4 diamonds really|pg||
nt|sharkey: But taking the initial @H pitch on @C cud hardly lose at all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here declarer has to create one red trick extra - to make 4 @S|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: +3 |pg||

nt|hedyg: some play X= 5-7 here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: west in the OR  bid only 1@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@D much more difficult here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good idea. Passing to show 0-7 is too wide a range |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: now my k@d is a bad value|pg||
nt|hedyg: mine too :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|Walddk2: We have seen it before, 5@D is actually the best game|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 1 entry to hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That was first hurdle - better let South be declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Trabucchi bids again, they will get doubled in anything|pg||
nt|milton_se: but probably not after that doubtful 3S bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a proper sloam here all on a 2/2 break basically|pg||

nt|mdgraham: courageous pass by South.|pg||

mb|3C|nt|vugraphztg: 3@s support|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm west didnt even give it a thought|pg||
nt|henryb: so a bad slam, Mike. 40%|pg||
nt|brolucius: Great fit for E/W. but a slam still needs a 2-2 trump break.|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but it should have been explored at least|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  another slam hand, what more do you want|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H= more @s|pg||
mb|3S|nt|varange: there goes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S make easy 4@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so a little swing now|pg||
nt|milton_se: 5 or 6 imps?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: How do you fancy a spade to the ace and @C9 return in 3NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: hand is limited to 16 since no 1 @c opening|pg||
nt|xenya: good prediction, Roland|pg||
nt|milton_se: he let them off the hook, but they were eager to take it anyway|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sticks or circles :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 800|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: as the cards lie, not possible to make 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, 1100 if he covers|pg||
nt|xenya: though why N should convert is not quite clear|pg||
nt|yo_yo: looks like NS will get some imps at last|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Double dummy, I know, but 3NT can go down, 5@D can't|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: 7|pg||

pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: 4@S no DBL ! :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: more dinner offers..|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  With North as declarer, a lousy @D-lead kills the contract -|pg||
nt|hedyg: E must switch to @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @cA and a @d switch...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s is too passive|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Just guess the @H-suit, and you write 620|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now S has time to set up @h  after a correct guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no fantasy with that @s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot doublefinesse in @H, needs 2 entries for that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I normally say: If onlÃ¦y at least one of the opponentÂ´s hands is wide open (dummy) you should try to kill the contract|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think they can beat 4@S even with a bad guess because East will only get in once|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That East did NOT play @H, might signal having the King|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|othered1: prior to the 4 @S bid, what had east shown/denied in strength?|pg||
nt|varange: cheap round|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like " we are either too high or too low in 3 @s"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C lavinthal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if Lanzarotti cashes his other ace ...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: if he switches to @D after A@c it is down|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|varange: no such luck|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: at any rate as cards lie its 100% so it m,ay be a swing|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  thats at least 4/5 slam hands now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hawe45:  No - not right - declarer ducks the 10 - and guesses the @H|pg||
nt|brolucius: West would need a special trump asking bid, to ask North how many trumps he held.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did he not have 9 top tricks with @DKx on?|pg||
nt|hedyg: off the Schneider|pg||
nt|mdgraham: six boards left....|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Lanzarotti can read doubleton in @H in South |pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: but as a kib notices S can duck a small @d|pg||

nt|xenya: double finesse in @H would be a normal play, but here declarer has only one entry to hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: but E can play J@D :)|pg||

nt|othered1: Interesting 5-level decision opposite a weak NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no pollution - never !|pg||
mb|5S|nt|lml: maybe dbl should show a good balanced hand and 3@C and 3@D show majors with clubs showing better hearts|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Then after some time when Angelini was on lead with @SA he played another club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strange|pg||
nt|othered1: Save will mke it a little closer or, maybe, a lot closer if they go to 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did declarer not ruff a club he might have asked himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: never thought declarer would ruff a @c loser?|pg||
nt|milton_se: nice win if 6H now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: even 4@H without @D ruffs looks like a lot of work|pg||
nt|lml: anyway West would not be shut out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This lead you must ruff with the @H Ace!!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: or the 8 :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To show who is the king|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lml: 6@C must have been a consideration by south and it is right on the hand of course|pg||

nt|hedyg: 6@c on a @H lead|pg||
mb|6H|an|I listent to and after i win|nt|bridge_one: 4@s was ON - so 4@h less one is a good result for N/S|pg||
nt|hedyg: -1? how?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H is carrying a reasonable principle too far. 11 loser hands should shut up unless prodded vehemently|pg||
nt|hedyg: by E ofc|pg||
mb|p!|nt|hedyg: i see -3 except for a miracle|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2down|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: will play for long @ss in S playing A@s first|pg||
nt|lml: but then again you don't know they are making 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, 6@H won the board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it's only a matter of by how much|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass by Fantoni i think 0 or 2+defensive tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl would be one defensive trick|pg||
nt|varange: Manno's 4H bid - very nice|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but i amn't sure in this sequence ...|pg||
nt|othered1: Not over yet.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is over because North is on lead against spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol Fabio|pg||
nt|othered1: Pushing *these* guys around isn't easy.|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs to lead @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, Lanzarotti is a seasoned customer|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sharkey: can ruff out @C 10 but short of entries...|pg||
nt|othered1: Lauria, of course, makes winning decision, only 4  imps away|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Easier to play than to bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT must have been a raise in @c|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they dont play...just claim...1 trick in each suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: seems inefficient to give the opponents and easy 3@C cue-bid|pg||

pc|sA|nt|hedyg: if no @H lead only -1|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2down with @H lead|pg||

nt|xenya: by the sound of the auction 5@H has every chance i think|pg||

pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: but probably Linda. No @c tricks in the defence|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lml: there was an American player who seemd to always play 5 of a major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Give the young man in the South seat a lot of credit for this big result|pg||
nt|varange: -2 leading the SINGLETON heart, Hedy?|pg||
nt|othered1: Neatly played the strain with no ruffs out|pg||

nt|lml: souths problem is that 5@H might not make ot 6@H might make.  He doesn't know they landed in the goldilocks spot|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: Have to discuss something interesting while there is a 1NT contract going on in the background.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h4|pc|s4|pg||
nt|othered1: Funny how the 1N opening, instead of 1@S, put Ew into a guessing game based on general evaluation.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: The previous hands may have influenced the bidding - boards 9 & 12|pg||

pc|d5|nt|hedyg: N was sure he had @Cs|pg||
nt|hedyg: so both N and S didnt know|pg||
nt|bridge_one: takeout, but i think with 2+@S - can play 2@S Dbled|pg||
nt|lestergold: but indeed who would?|pg||

nt|hedyg: claiming 10?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i think s forgot the number of trumps played|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|lml: East doubled with his 5-4-4-0 but it was passed out and it was cold|pg||

nt|ralfwil: who has taken a nap?|pg||

pc|h5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: i mean the dim ten|pg||
nt|brolucius: He could instead have taken a spade finesse, still OK if the finesse loses but spades are 3-3. I suppose his intention on this line was to finesse twice in diamonds if the first ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: finesse lost. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: Sabine Auken hate the Gazzilli convention :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to play the gazzilli !|pg||
nt|varange: I am told that Gazilli with a marinara sauce and a little white wine is very tasty|pg||
nt|varange: that is maybe because Sabine actually has a life|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|bridge_one: i asked at Lauria if he likw to play Gazzilli - he answer that it is usefull only playing a complicate version, giving the difference between 17/19 and 20/23|pg||

nt|hawe45:  hopeless|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Papi love onle Woman Gazzilli :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  If you play small @C to the Queen|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphztg: 2@s : txs for 2nt or many distributions|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Can be a IMP to gain for Serbia here. Even more if 6 is bidded and @D hitted. Exspext a flat board|pg||
nt|brolucius: Another splendid fit, this time for N/S.|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm 6S is a possible slam to bid with fair chances on a normal spade break|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6C??|pg||
nt|othered1: OH, did north find the @CQ play towards dummy?  that will hurt 2N on @S lead|pg||
mb|3H|nt|wilkinsona:  slam time?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so one major or other type of strong hand, i think |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: so 4@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@S better because you can sometimes discard a club on the 13th diamond.|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: they don't seem to use the 2@d as a game force checkback|pg||
nt|milton_se: over-aggressive|pg||
mb|d!|nt|sharkey: looks like it Tony|pg||
nt|hedyg: no only 1 major over 1NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: depending on agreements - i prefere to play multi with only one major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All of a sudden Nunes can "see" the singleton heart in partner's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Henry your good at percentages what would u say here|pg||
nt|henryb: Trabucchi now ahead three boards to one|pg||
nt|lestergold: dims 3/3u dont have to ind the club q and two way search is better than 50% normally because of the info that gets picked up |pg||
mb|3S|nt|hawe45:  Strange to le the weak hand play!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  let|pg||
nt|henryb: 6@s is about 66%|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  thought it was just a mater of 6 or 7|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 4@c : 5@h and 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: at least|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  thanks, Simon|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: after 2@s bid|pg||
nt|lml: not crazy about that bidding structure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On a @S-lead, "itÂ´s NOW"|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: 3@s : txs for 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so 6S is probably better than 50% slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: after @s lead playing A@C is tuff, if KJx in E no more entry to hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my J from Jxx not a success|pg||
nt|ritong: he has no entry to hand no matter what,after @c A|pg||
nt|ritong: so the best is @c to the 9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does the encyclopedia say|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks best, and pray|pg||
nt|hedyg: must keep communications open|pg||
nt|othered1: Encyclopedia doesn't have entry problems|pg||
nt|ritong: a kind of table presence problem imo|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think, this is a guess. @CV 2-2 works - and then only single @C K also|pg||
nt|hedyg: encyclopedia says play 5@c......|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: @c from dummy?|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|varange: so we have now identified two bridge players who actually have a life: Sabine and Papi :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S can make 4@h, but E/W make 4@S !|pg||
nt|othered1: That was ineffective|pg||
nt|henryb: Well now, I think N-S can barely make 3@h|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: Will make if S ruffs 2@d on the table before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: might require careful handling|pg||
nt|othered1: In OR, west doubled 1@H opening, and did have support for other suits|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4H down on a S lead|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|ritong: @c to the Q wins stiff J|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The South hand does not have many entries. He may well play a club to the queen|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Somewhat lucky that Lauria does not have anything wasted in diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree with that double|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: is it clear to lead a heart? what about a club at trick 2?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West would try to give a constructive raise at 2@s - pass not the best|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud W cue 5@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: domani si riprende con il 2° tempo di semifinale alle 10.30|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: now the @d finess|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both suits (@S and @D) are placed in favor of declarer - who kan even afford to loose a @D-trick|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Ralf, that seems the best  plan|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps the only winning one|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Still 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: That's not safe|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW feeling confortable ahead probably see no reson to gamble here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  maybe north told him about the diamond situation|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe just the 2-bid's preemption working|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb: even better because you might not get a heart lead!|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rodal f: Lost some tempo now so max 11. Can become 10 and gain for Romania|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and will utter a silent curse|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe not so silent|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: why not @h to dummy and @c?|pg||
nt|othered1: against lesser opponents, @C guess might be easier to make|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: with this layout, the good move was cross to dummy with a @h, pplay a @c and duck the @c K|pg||
pc|s9|nt|brolucius: A 9-6 scoreline after 13 boards is not exactly a swingy set.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|irwinbo: club would work|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well i wasnt asking about what works, but what is right|pg||
nt|bridge_one: great Roland ! perfect italian !|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: Back at 11|pg||
nt|ralfwil: trumps is best from W, but doesn´t help|pg||

nt|Walddk2: me? no|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzzw: thank you for watching. Goodbye!!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: we dont know what open room result is but given how good a slam this is it could be bid in open|pg||

nt|hawe45:  5-level again |pg||
nt|hedyg: this board and 1 more|pg||
nt|hedyg: Simon what about the score bd 45?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 4@h down 1|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d =|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok pls enter it|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i put the result|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes ty |pg||
nt|Walddk2: And the lead back to Trabucchi after board 12. 4@D  6@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: now a possible granny|pg||
nt|lestergold: not of  course a good one|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but agree entries difficult|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Otherwise you may have no entry|pg||
nt|othered1: beating 4@S is non-trivial here, too.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I might make 9Â½ tricks in 4 @S|pg||
nt|othered1: ne3eded @C ruff to take trumps separately|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: well it was a normal distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: and a handsome lead it is|pg||
nt|ritong: nice hands for the finish, anyway|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: looks like 4@S should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: not more that 5@D for N/S|pg||
nt|othered1: not on @CA and another |pg||
nt|hawe45:  With the @C-ruff you defeat it|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hawe45:  But 140 will bring them close|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and that's what was led  A@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: if they get there|pg||
nt|varange: but we can rely on Fantunes to find at least one slam in the next two boards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thumbs down on the 1n opening :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no 5 level|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec says Roland grabnd slam i say too good for roland grand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now 4@C usually played as a splinter, so East must look elsewhere.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  nice when partner opens and you have 4 Aces|pg||
nt|lestergold: however back in the land of reality this should be a flat 6H plus one in both rooms|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: and 4 card support|pg||
nt|ritong: pass by north is not super brave|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd bid 2@S on south hand, but I don't know how fisky north can be at these colors|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: He did - Lauria cud still have A or K |pg||
nt|ralfwil: even 4@h is too expensive - 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  800 - even shortly before Christmas|pg||
nt|marlowepi: substandard hearts and substandard spades for a 3H fit-jump, from a purist's perspective|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW not quite as active in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: Clair knows N is short in @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as most play, 2C in competition is not a GF, so then it would not be clear that this pass is forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: Franchi should have 4 @ss for his 3@H bid|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS may be shut out now...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Nt by North difficult to make 3Nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10.14 NT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  - if Souths bids on|pg||
nt|xenya: EW haven't discovered their true potential|pg||
nt|ralfwil: besides - I haven´t had a bid on N|pg||
nt|varange: I like the 1NT opening|pg||
nt|brolucius: Could just bid 6@H. I once had a partner who HATED leaps to the six-level. That made me do it even more often. |pg||
nt|henryb: another hand for fourth best!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bridge_one: the previous pass hoping in DBL in North and trasform give a problem to bid now|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot give up on the vulnerable game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: south pass ... could try a open 1Nt - 12 hcp|pg||
nt|henryb: or at least long suit|pg||
pc|cK|nt|varange: semi balanced: 7222, 6322 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The second double even more interesting|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most partnerships play that you are obliged to cue-bid the @DA on the West cards, even if you are minimum. With a second-round control you can sign off with a poor hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: I have a feeling that laria will have to steamroller this one to slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: For a flat board.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  this is probably enough negativity from west to avoid the making grand|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh!|pg||
nt|hedyg: so new leader again..|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is expensive|pg||
nt|xenya: for an instant i thought EW got them...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wilkinsona:  does this have a chance, ...seems it might..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure you can go down when you are in 3|pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps that was tough the way the bidding went|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Vlad, W was not able to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can support later if partner will act|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would not be content with defending 2@S when opps are vulnerable?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, no grand, so East's 4@S suggests that he is not yet willing to bid even 6@H. |pg||
pc|h7|nt|milton_se: finance crisis syndrome: not content with anything|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it could obviously go very wrong, but surely North had to double 3@D|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: of course, doubling 3@d can generate a disaster, on the other hand north can envisage a @c SLAM, so he must bid imho|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rocco47: 12 per Failla|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they play 2@c good hand - so 4@d is dangerous - better 3Nt or Dbl ?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|varange: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: Lauria will surely go now even if west 'signs off'|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: W has to give the k@s|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: now 5@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is a bit much on those moderate trumps. The @SK might be enough for West to bid 6@H, though.|pg||
nt|hedyg: why was a @H led in OR?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharkey: We've said that before...|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually i think well bid by west|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hawe45:  480 - last board|pg||
nt|xenya: easy 12 with 2-2 @Ss|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if he inserts the 10, which could have been right|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: of course fine bidding by Lauria goes without saying|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|henryb: trying to be genius|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
mc|7|nt|Walddk2: To make Angelini stay in the match|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: let's hope they land in 4@H NOW|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: surely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What's wrong with 6@C?|pg||
nt|lestergold: always hard to bid the 'par' of 5H here at these colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: 5@h is two down, Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: red Ks do not have to be favourably placed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 2@s will show a good - at least 5-card - @s and a good hand|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which two diamond losers if I may ask|pg||
nt|milton_se: nothing wrong at all, but South can't see it|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3@s with N cards|pg||
nt|varange: but Nunes makes the slam-killer 3NT bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: You cannot finesse them both.|pg||
nt|po-s: has to take 11|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Next set after a short break, 10-15 minutes is my estimate|pg||

nt|wilkinsona:  by the way Roland, spec metions a win for Denmark over Scotland today....|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: everyone has finished|pg||
