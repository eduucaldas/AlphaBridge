mb|2N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|patricck: look at those 4 jacks in the south hand....not a single one of them is worth a trick|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|sheila a: the 8 @h are quite alluring, though|pg||
nt|sheila a: sorry, 7|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cameron_1: hard to blame Dixon unsure Silverstoen has a 5@d call unless he thought it was re transer|pg||
pc|c2|nt|patricck: on a diamond lead declarer would make, and on a non diamond lead he could make if the Q@C was in fron to fhte jack, so it probably isn't too bad a slam to be in|pg||
nt|cameron_1: oh|pg||
nt|patricck: and it looks as though the lead has given it away anyway|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|sheila a: lead could be a singleton, but not much in the way of alternative lines|pg||

nt|cameron_1: might do in Qxx i guess but|pg||
nt|patricck: maybe partner should have doubled 4@S for the lead|pg||

mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Morning David, Peter and Mike|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome back to the 2nd stanza with your operators Christine and Stuart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult to judge what the South hand is worth facing a 2NT opener|pg||
nt|athene: this would have decent chances on a minor-suit lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: AKx of hearts would be better, with the @CQ instead. @HQ is rather wasted  |pg||
nt|april7: unfortunately 1 down, no parkingplace for the @S or @D loser|pg||
nt|athene: as it is, he might duck a spade and hope for (very unlikely) minor-suit squeeze|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: S asking if 4th lead, E says no as he has doubled, therefore presuming its a 3rd or 5th card lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we could speculate about this for some time, methinks|pg||
nt|athene: ducking a spade rectifies the count but also gives up on the @SJ being some sort of menace|pg||
nt|athene: he will be thinking about complicated three-suit squeezes without the count|pg||
nt|athene: we may be here for some time...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as one does...|pg||
nt|april7: whats the difference whether its 4th or 3d/5th lead|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||

pc|hA|pc|s5|pc|hT|nt|petepunt: looks like he wil play for a @D @C sqz that doesnt work|pg||
nt|athene: even if you got to a successful throw-in ending (e.g. @SKQ, @CQ with east) he could just exit with the @CQ to block the suit|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: well, it was North's fault. If he had had @HAKx and @CQ, 7@H would have been icy |pg||

nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome to the Gold cup Semifinal Christine Walker operating|pg||

mb|1H|nt|petepunt: doubt N will raise 1N here|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|3C|mb|4S|nt|april7: here we have an easy 4@S contract|pg||

nt|jallerton: 1NT =17-19|pg||
nt|athene: north way too good for 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but no convenient cue-bid; it's possible to use 2NT in that position as the good raise|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: finding the usual Jxx in dummy |pg||
nt|petepunt: 1@C two + ?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|petepunt: X of 2@S would be negative and show similar ahand for N|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: perhaps he just decided that with everyone bidding, Robson had to have a light 2@C overcall, so 3@C wasn't going to hurt|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: but that sort of "trusting opponents" strategy can allow opps to talk you out of things|pg||

nt|petepunt: will worry @D may be 4-1|pg||
nt|jallerton: Declarer may try to lead a @s hoping 2nd hand has the ace, planning to switch to @d|pg||
nt|jallerton: though contuining @s OK if with @s 3-3 or guesses @h|pg||
nt|jallerton: Declarer does not know that @c are 4-4|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks like 7 tricks tho.|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you might bid 1nt to show values, but here, partner is never moving over it anyway, so you aren't getting to game|pg||
nt|april7: If N finds Q of @C, 7 tricks, if not....|pg||
nt|athene: so why not just bid 2@D?|pg||

nt|petepunt: Wests failure to open 15-17 1N may help here|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe he will play a club, playing his partner for the @CK?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petepunt: a@D first would have avoided this guess ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Knew ducking a @d to East was safe as East could not be cashing two clubs (West known to have the jack)|pg||
nt|jallerton: not the @h finesse option|pg||
nt|petepunt: hence q@C known to be with Waterlow|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petepunt: but 10@H keeps options open now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|april7: W might try asmall @D now, before releaising the ace|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c9|pc|h8|pc|dA|pg||

nt|athene: if it's very close, you should perhaps go for the winning line because if you're wrong it's only one down|pg||

mb|1D|mb|d|an|4+ !H|nt|athene: but it certainly wasn't easy|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2@d shows 6!+ hearts?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|col3435: transfer seems likely, given who South is|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, that was the explanation at the table|pg||
nt|april7: very aggressive X, EW have 3NT on a @H lead because of @H 4-4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ligtish 1@D, too|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: when you play against pairs who open 2+ 1@C you really need some good rules as to when your club bids are natural|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|athene: especially when 1@C might be only two cards in a balanced weak hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|jallerton: Is this really the right hand to pass it on though?|pg||

nt|col3435: Pass seems OK to me, you want to keep it low on the misfit (partner might be bidding again if you bid 2@h) and you're well placed if LHO does something|pg||
nt|col3435: but it's obviously a bit of a gamble still|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sheila a: 5@d looks a good save, but you need to bid them first|pg||

pc|h4|nt|sheila a: I'm trying to avoid the 'seeing-all-4-hands' syndrome ... and failing :)|pg||
nt|patricck: perhaps if either hand had doubled the artificial @D bid in front of them|pg||
nt|sheila a: trouble is Silverstone would rather have a @c lead than a @d - if he's going to bid would have to be first round|pg||
