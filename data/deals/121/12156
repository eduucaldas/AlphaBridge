mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|vugraphzbe: sorry, different distribution|pg||
nt|athene: @CJ lead could be ducked by declarer|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome back to the 2nd stanza with your operators Christine and Stuart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult to judge what the South hand is worth facing a 2NT opener|pg||
nt|athene: this would have decent chances on a minor-suit lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: AKx of hearts would be better, with the @CQ instead. @HQ is rather wasted  |pg||
nt|april7: unfortunately 1 down, no parkingplace for the @S or @D loser|pg||
nt|athene: as it is, he might duck a spade and hope for (very unlikely) minor-suit squeeze|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: S asking if 4th lead, E says no as he has doubled, therefore presuming its a 3rd or 5th card lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we could speculate about this for some time, methinks|pg||
nt|athene: ducking a spade rectifies the count but also gives up on the @SJ being some sort of menace|pg||
nt|athene: he will be thinking about complicated three-suit squeezes without the count|pg||
nt|athene: we may be here for some time...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as one does...|pg||
nt|april7: whats the difference whether its 4th or 3d/5th lead|pg||
nt|athene: i think north should bid 3@C over 2@S here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: if he isn't going to open 3@C|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||

nt|athene: even if you got to a successful throw-in ending (e.g. @SKQ, @CQ with east) he could just exit with the @CQ to block the suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if West throws a club now, he likely has five, with four on the table|pg||

nt|xenya: EW were a bit lucky on that one|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: doubt N will raise 1N here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, surprising decision from west to pass 3nt with four spades and a small doubleton|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|april7: here we have an easy 4@S contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a superb exampple of a 2@C overcall|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 1@d = "Stayman"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: In the other s/f Matheson - Sime bid 1N-3N. @HK lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT =17-19|pg||
nt|athene: north way too good for 3@C|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: but no convenient cue-bid; it's possible to use 2NT in that position as the good raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: finding the usual Jxx in dummy |pg||
nt|petepunt: 1@C two + ?|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|petepunt: X of 2@S would be negative and show similar ahand for N|pg||
nt|athene: four top losers, and nowhere to put them even if the defence don't cash them right off|pg||
nt|athene: @H1097 lead more likely than @HK onside; maybe you rise ace here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: perhaps he just decided that with everyone bidding, Robson had to have a light 2@C overcall, so 3@C wasn't going to hurt|pg||
nt|april7: after ace of@D E has a choice ow plays and might guess wrong, so E must help and lead @C after K of @H|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: but that sort of "trusting opponents" strategy can allow opps to talk you out of things|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|jallerton: yes, any 11-13/17-19 bal or natural|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: better to trust your partner|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|april7: good duck by N|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|xenya: 1@D showed @Hs, 2@HS was 4 hearts and minimum -- well, S decided it was worth bidding 4|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d3|nt|jallerton: The @d play for 3 tricks anyway, so the lead did not give away the contract|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|april7: E guessed wron but still down because 9 and 10 of @D dont drop|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|athene: if declarer had the @D10, it would be necessary for west to play a club now|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: so well done|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petepunt: playing 1n as 17-19 means you can bid over 1@C on very min values safely|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: east, of course, knows the diamonds aren't going anywhere for declarer|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s6|pc|h8|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|col3435: what would 1@c : 1M mean? do we know?|pg||
nt|athene: as well as causing problems in the bidding, the nebulous 1@C opener can make things hard for the defence in the play, though - they might not think of declarer having a concealed ...|pg||
nt|athene: trick source in diamonds|pg||
pc|d5|pc|cT|nt|jallerton: N/S play an interesting treatment: 1@h/@S response to 1@c shows a 5+-card suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: knowing Crouch, it won't be natural|pg||

nt|athene: double is a possible alternative for south|pg||
nt|athene: but he prefers to get the good suit in|pg||
nt|april7: 5@C or 3NT for the lucky position of the @D suit|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@S forcing, no major (X would be hearts; 1@H would be spades)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|mb|r|nt|petepunt: isnt 1n 17-19 ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d = no 5-card major, 1NT =17-19|pg||
nt|athene: many would overcall 2@D with north|pg||
nt|april7: EW has a partscore in @S and NS might try a @C partscore|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: but robson is there for him!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|april7: W will X and E will bid 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no fears about re-opening|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not a big fan of 1NT, with only one spade stop|pg||
nt|athene: silverstone just needs to know if his partner has a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|athene: if he has, 6@C must be good|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: so what does N have avaiable here? Is this showing short @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 3@S - singleton club 3 suit hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzaf: In principle 44 Majors  but TF judged his hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: will worry @D may be 4-1|pg||
nt|jallerton: Declarer may try to lead a @s hoping 2nd hand has the ace, planning to switch to @d|pg||
nt|jallerton: though contuining @s OK if with @s 3-3 or guesses @h|pg||
nt|jallerton: Declarer does not know that @c are 4-4|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks like 7 tricks tho.|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you might bid 1nt to show values, but here, partner is never moving over it anyway, so you aren't getting to game|pg||
nt|april7: If N finds Q of @C, 7 tricks, if not....|pg||
nt|athene: so why not just bid 2@D?|pg||
nt|april7: should E have a singleton @D then 6 @C to be made|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure he has  achieved much by taking this very scenic route to 3nt|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petepunt: inersting tx|pg||

pc|c4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: hoping his partner has an entry (major-suit ace or even @CQxx if declarer misguessed)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|hT|pc|cA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: at BAM i think he takes the @DAK and gives up; there's too much danger of conceding 12 tricks otherwise|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: small diamond from west now|pg||
nt|petepunt: Wests failure to open 15-17 1N may help here|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe he will play a club, playing his partner for the @CK?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petepunt: a@D first would have avoided this guess ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Knew ducking a @d to East was safe as East could not be cashing two clubs (West known to have the jack)|pg||
nt|jallerton: not the @h finesse option|pg||
nt|petepunt: hence q@C known to be with Waterlow|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petepunt: but 10@H keeps options open now|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|april7: W might try asmall @D now, before releaising the ace|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: that was always the problem - east ends up throwing his clubs, so declarer is very unlikely to go wrong in the suit|pg||
pc|h9|nt|april7: S might be squeezed if S had JQ of @S|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: Hackett is doing his best to look like a man with the @CQ, though|pg||
nt|athene: sorry dummy had the @CQ :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petepunt: Will notice Waterlows 14HCP shown and Hackets pass over 1@S is the key|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s9|nt|athene: and @CJxxx with north wouldn't be any good as declarer would be picking that up|pg||

nt|petepunt: its easier up here though!|pg||
nt|athene: if it's very close, you should perhaps go for the winning line because if you're wrong it's only one down|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but if you play the other way and it's wrong, you are two down|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|an|5+|nt|athene: but it certainly wasn't easy|pg||
nt|athene: lightish 1@C|pg||
mb|1H!|an|could be 4!H + minor|nt|april7: 4@S By S to be made due to fall of JQ of @C, will they reach it?|pg||
mb|d!|nt|petepunt: as a feather|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|jallerton: 2@d shows 6!+ hearts?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|col3435: transfer seems likely, given who South is|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, that was the explanation at the table|pg||
nt|april7: very aggressive X, EW have 3NT on a @H lead because of @H 4-4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ligtish 1@D, too|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: when you play against pairs who open 2+ 1@C you really need some good rules as to when your club bids are natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: especially when 1@C might be only two cards in a balanced weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: south's double is 4+ spades i guess, and north's is exactly three spades|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|jallerton: Is this really the right hand to pass it on though?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzaf: E asking N if S has atleast 1 @C, response is yes|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|petepunt: again nothing on for e/w |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|petepunt: passnormally shows 6@D and weak|pg||
nt|col3435: Pass seems OK to me, you want to keep it low on the misfit (partner might be bidding again if you bid 2@h) and you're well placed if LHO does something|pg||
nt|col3435: but it's obviously a bit of a gamble still|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North probbaly happy to be playing in anything but hearts |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|petepunt: not by W though|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: now a spade to the @S10, maybe|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||

nt|jallerton: A bit of waiting for Robson to finish too!|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Thanks ably assisted by Stuart Bradnam|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: NS never bid at the other table|pg||
