nt|vugraphztg: buonasera|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Systems Simon?|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is the tightest match of the round of 16|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't believe that Clair passed|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: wrong board|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe they are not playing this board at all|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 1NT not exactly textbook either|pg||

nt|marlowepi: maybe "tightest match" meant...|pg||
nt|hedyg: closest score Marshall|pg||
nt|hedyg: might a free translation from French|pg||
nt|Walddk2: wronf file it seems. open room operator shut down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "tight" is american slang for "tipsy"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Simon will do too|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: wrong file system|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: we quit and then come back|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2 minutes|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: But it's awkward to bid 5@C now since partner will think opener has more hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: E-W play Angelini's version of Precision|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|milton_se: not a double?|pg||

nt|sharkey: looks like off 4?|pg||
nt|varange: do you know much about NS Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S with four cards is somewhat dangerous when you know that partner has close to nothing|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: No, I don't know them|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: At least|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 1@H showed @s|pg||

nt|hedyg: nice 10@s in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  There is a danger in the @C-suit, if North tries some safety-play - and East plays the Jack. Might give North bad plans.|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Simon, i thought you said they play strong NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona:  ok,....ddddown|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|hedyg: and he did have 19 hcps|pg||

nt|hedyg: right, 2suiter|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|lestergold: 3N should go off on careful defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: but might it now before pd leads a @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: nope|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1nt possible, 2Nt long to make - so 2@s open would work here|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: uwelcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 14 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|varange: amaazing layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: nko reason for the stiff KC to be found|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To me Easts hand more looks like a @C-@d reverse hand - no intermediates for NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: and the lead would be @S, not @c|pg||
nt|milton_se: oops|pg||
nt|varange: ouch|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: seems 2@H was forcing..|pg||
nt|xenya: a wheel came off?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wilkinsona:  unless its led|pg||
pc|d5|nt|varange: two|pg||
nt|milton_se: nice to agree on what´s forcing :)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|sharkey: Assuming a @S lead dont think you need @C finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: here declafrer can afford the safety play|pg||
nt|hedyg: not really enough for reverse|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure - but minimum!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The @H-suit brings this 3 NT safely home|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a @s lead...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Whatever lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: guess @h help the declarer|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: but we were deprivd of watchi9ng for it|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: cambiaghi apologize for his bid|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: franco saved him|pg||
nt|xenya: this one might not be easy|pg||
nt|irwinbo: he will now make it|pg||
nt|hedyg: actually the @c gave nothing, declarer would have played small @c to jack|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for sure - also more that one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Irwin :)|pg||
nt|varange: and then to not forget :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h7|nt|hedyg: so 2 @H was nf?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: indeed - and here it will be difficult to get a @C ruff|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: without club lead declarer can afford to bang down club ace before leading up to it to cater for the KC stiff|pg||
nt|xenya: not clear what happened -- any ideas?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: 1 IMP back here|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|h2|pg||

nt|xenya: he chose a wrong plan it seems|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Simon :) you are the best!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Listen: We have 4 @H, 3 @C + 2 ACES - here in Denmark the total is 9|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but how do you know you have 4 hearts?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That combines 3-3 @H OR 3-3 @C - not so bad|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: both of pairs|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: EO to play, NS defense|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sharkey: Makes played by E - otherwise has to guess @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be the first swing board|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  but 5 hearts went -2 OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe trying to make 5 lost an extra trick|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: W is endplayed|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: assume misguessed @S - finesse |pg||

pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||

nt|marlowepi: at all--to me, anyway--whether the pass over 4S is, or should be, forcing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 1@S Roland not so sure declarer can't read the same the hands - with 6@h with one+ honor few don't bid 2@h over 1@S overcall|pg||

pc|dK|nt|lml: they can make that slam|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: on @H lead?|pg||
nt|lml: 6nt has 3 heart 3 spades 2 clubs and 4 diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best contract is 6 NT by East - extremely unlucky|pg||
nt|lml: maybe not|pg||
nt|xenya: but the defence will get 2 tricks earlier|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6nt is only on a squeeze, but N will return a @c to break it|pg||
nt|lml: I was just looking at that|pg||
nt|hedyg: unlikely N leads  @C vs 6NT? S did not double 3 @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: there is a good chance you will be on lead|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lml: you might do it double dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And the auction has not been favourable for an overcall|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: now?|pg||
nt|lml: it does have to be played by east|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my experience the danger of such overcalls is greatly exaggerated when pd is a passed hand, we are NV, and RHO has not yet spooken|pg||
pc|d9|nt|wilkinsona:  made in OR by simply playing towards the heart Q|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So spades mentioned for the first time at the 6-level!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 4 diamond minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 5nt choose the major|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, i might be on lead. but there is probably an equal chance that psrtner will be on lead if they bid a game|pg||

nt|sharkey: Is it obvious this makes - or some choices to be made?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't matter with trumps 3-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leading towards @HQ seems best, but even if it loses, there are certain squeeze chances|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lml: if you play the @SA first and see the split West has to split spades when you lead to the queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Whatever the lead - both slams are doome to go down. A 3-years old monkey would find the @C-switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The opponents have not shown a fit|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lml: you can strip him and throw in on @CK|pg||
nt|xenya: well bid|pg||
nt|lml: he will have to lead a spade from the 10xx|pg||
nt|hedyg: after loosing A@H?|pg||

nt|hedyg: no throwins in 12 LOL|pg||
nt|lml: oh sorry silly me|pg||
nt|irwinbo: llook at the bidding in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe @c discard better|pg||
nt|varange: he might have felt the need to show a suit before the bidding got too high, with the pass in West showing a wide range (0-7)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  Then North ducks ONE @h-round|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||

pc|cA|nt|sharkey: But leading @C A first may have ruined squeeze chances if @H K off|pg||

nt|hedyg: only 1 entry to hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That was first hurdle - better let South be declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Trabucchi bids again, they will get doubled in anything|pg||
nt|milton_se: but probably not after that doubtful 3S bid|pg||

nt|xenya: good prediction, Roland|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  With North as declarer, a lousy @D-lead kills the contract -|pg||
nt|hedyg: E must switch to @d|pg||

nt|hedyg: 4@s is too passive|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Just guess the @H-suit, and you write 620|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now S has time to set up @h  after a correct guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no fantasy with that @s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot doublefinesse in @H, needs 2 entries for that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I normally say: If onlÃ¦y at least one of the opponentÂ´s hands is wide open (dummy) you should try to kill the contract|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think they can beat 4@S even with a bad guess because East will only get in once|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That East did NOT play @H, might signal having the King|pg||

nt|ralfwil: even 4@h is too expensive - 2 IMPs|pg||

nt|marlowepi: substandard hearts and substandard spades for a 3H fit-jump, from a purist's perspective|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW not quite as active in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: Clair knows N is short in @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as most play, 2C in competition is not a GF, so then it would not be clear that this pass is forcing|pg||

nt|varange: but Nunes makes the slam-killer 3NT bid|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: that's that|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|varange: the ace and the queen |pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: The thing is that this may be huge a swing for Trabucchi because Fantoni will open 1@C in the other room|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: thanks everyone - interesting match|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our appreciation to the FIGB for ensuring that this event is brought to BBO vugraph. Gianluca Frola, and on behalf of BBO, Vincenzo Delle Cave, have been instrumental in setting up ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: a fine show|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next set after a short break, 10-15 minutes is my estimate|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yeah|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  by the way Roland, spec metions a win for Denmark over Scotland today....|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: everyone has finished|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree with that bidding. Either 3@s from N or 3@d from S after 2nt|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Must be curling|pg||
nt|varange: ah. I see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and *then* they must avoid slam|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: also fantoni|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think one should be too harsh on NS -- after all, they have only 7 spades, but stoppers in all suits|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|wilkinsona:  seems so...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugraphztg: byee|pg||
