pc|h2|pc|c5|nt|wilkinsona: In gold cup the scores are compared every 8 boards, afterwhich the captains have alternate seeting options|pg||

nt|rednaxela: Sanders is a long standing advocate of the weak NT in all seats at all vulnerabilities.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT for EW played by E|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it is rare|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|xenya: 3N no doubt|pg||
nt|xenya: should be a routine 4@H EW|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: can still be, perhaps..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: as 3N may be possible|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you were right Justin|pg||
nt|justin c: this looks like the better game|pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: undo please|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: Either pre-emptive or slam try in spades|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: once again EW come in...|pg||
nt|justin c: 5@C just on the trump guess, but 3NT has potential tricks everywhere|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that will help the twins|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, now S can count on 3 tricks in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzak: 2@s any invite|pg||

nt|vugraphzak: It's christine have updated|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wilkinsona: only a spade switch holds to 8 it seems|pg||

nt|rednaxela: E/W need to get their Club trick established early, before it goes on Diamonds.|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: good auction fron NS|pg||

nt|xenya: no-one vulnerable, so they will bid freely|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: awkward bid for Derick Saunders in the East seat|pg||

nt|justin c: uncomfortably high|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: 1@S in one room, 3N in the other...|pg||

nt|xenya: actually it's quite close -- 3N i mean|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south needs to win here|pg||
pc|dT|nt|wilkinsona: In OR Matheson played and early diamond and was allowed to score the Q|pg||

nt|justin c: collins even further ahead now|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: bad heart break here|pg||
nt|xenya: the right play is to win 1st heart in hand and play a @C to the Q -- to guard against a possible trump promotion |pg||

nt|justin c: is this a vul overcall?|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe I'm just getting old :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well so are the twins, but it didnt stop them|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how old are they now?|pg||
nt|justin c: not sure|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: danger in finding the 5-5 fit it seems..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: getting well into concession territory|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: Willie Coyle once told me, in my junior days, that if you play strong Club you do so for all the hands where you don't open 1@c.|pg||
nt|xenya: it's true that N was unlikkely to have 7 hearts, but the play doesn't cost |pg||
nt|justin c: i guess if north's hand is an overcall, east's is a fit jump|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: that one should have been -3 but may have escaped for -2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not a classic fit jump  but  a bit good for a siple 2@S maybe|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wilkinsona: this might not make either!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: my granny told me to always have a good suit when I fit jump!|pg||
nt|justin c: Sanders' granny not nearly so shy|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: yes, EW had better stay out of game here|pg||
nt|xenya: and they did|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it is a good suit though when it breaks 2-2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: interesting pass by W -- are they playing a strong 1@C or something?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: best to play the ace here|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|justin c: prompt @S switch from south will deal with this|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|yo_yo: nice practical bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, without the double, seems a guess..|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wilkinsona: west does sell here to settle for 3N diamond fit not withstanding|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, the knowledge that partner is not 16+ symplifies things no end|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: S should pass|pg||
nt|xenya: no...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: the stiff 9@S very important card|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: i must say i don't understand 4@S|pg||
nt|justin c: trying to get a forcing game going|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a trick in each suit to lose  and a sharp double by South|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: a bit lucky perhaps -- many would bid game with EW's hands, vulnerable|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: checking cc|pg||
nt|xenya: and 3N looks particularly promising|pg||
nt|xenya: also, S might consider a double over 1@S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this runs into a ruff, but a small ruff was better for north it seems|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wilkinsona: so might go differently elsewhere|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mmmakela: y they did "well" in OR to reach 3 NT|pg||
nt|xenya: once again, declarer seems to have adopted an inferior plan|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Even 1NT in danger it seems|pg||
nt|xenya: what if S switches to @Cs now?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: seems the contract will be in danger then?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, club could have beaten it...|pg||
nt|xenya: but this gives declarer a vital tempo|pg||
nt|xenya: that would have probably led to 1N played by N|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: 3@S by N is by no means inviting|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south admitted to a balanced hand eventually|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: we can see that the cards are lying well for declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: anyhow, 3N is quite trivial and should be reached on any system |pg||
nt|mmmakela: still 2 @D with bad 5-carder seems strange|pg||

pc|cA|nt|xenya: again, EW in the OR reached 3N with a suit inadequately guarded|pg||
nt|xenya: no -- not with 4-2 @Ds|pg||

pc|c3|nt|wilkinsona: well at least they had a diamond overcall vs a take out x in OR|pg||

nt|rednaxela: 2NT suggest 15-17, which is a bit of an overstatement.|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile Collins have increased the lead to 32 imps|pg||
pc|d7|nt|wilkinsona: somewhat different auction to OR|pg||
nt|xenya: very different|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and north doubles for a club lead|pg||
nt|xenya: i wouldn't bid this hand like EW did|pg||
nt|mmmakela: will get 9 my bet|pg||

nt|mmmakela: spades and clubs ideally for decl|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer can keep norths clubs out of the picture |pg||
nt|xenya: 3N does look a stretch, and N's double is --er -- a bit optimistic|pg||
nt|xenya: this should be down 1 |pg||
nt|xenya: even if he misguesses @Hs, he is almost certain to get @Cs right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@C, @D and a @H-no |pg||
nt|xenya: sorry i was a bit rash it seems|pg||
nt|xenya: same problem in trumps|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S should count the losers and only makes he reduces his losers to 3 from 4|pg||
nt|xenya: well of course he can win now and play another club but that would be far from safe|pg||
nt|rnmalik: anothe @C-A and back|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wilkinsona: or 2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|wilkinsona: now just set up a spades for 9|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|xenya: he does have clubs but he doesn't have an entry|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3+2+3+1|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: perhaps a spades switch more accurate but with the clubs so bad this seems -1|pg||
nt|justin c: unfortunately the @DK is useless|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|wilkinsona: K is +1, and declarer may think he needs that |pg||

nt|yo_yo: agree|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Mind you, he left himself with no entry for the Spade finesse.  Suppose North had covered the J@c?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 7@C?|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Ah, yes.  Still had a smaller pip.  Should have played the 8 or 9 under the Jack.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Gerald Tred working out the distribution|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks like a spade at trick 3, then|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: South deep in thought|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder what message @H 8  was?|pg||
nt|rednaxela: He may be wondering where declarer's high cards are for his 2NT.  Really needs a Diamond honour but wouldn't have played the suit that way if he had one.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bet @D 10 is coming|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: South's brow still furrowed|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Sime back in the lead.  5 imps on the previous board where 2@s went off against 1@s made at this table.|pg||

pc|hA|mc|10|nt|ahh: west was passed hand |pg||
nt|yo_yo: well   that was quick, thanks all |pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe this match over now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: an early finish maybe and early to bed for the Collins team?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Keep them out of the bar !|pg||
nt|col3435: I wouldn't be conceding with less than 60 to make up|pg||
nt|col3435: not unusual to see 50 IMPs turned over in a set|pg||
nt|col3435: maybe if you're really tired :)|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: double fit time|pg||
nt|rednaxela: This could test our players' high level judgement.|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: Yes he did|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer tried to keep his option open, playing back a diamond and got in a mess|pg||
nt|rnmalik: their lead is also reducing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: last board of the set now|pg||
nt|chthonic: Bye all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, the match is much closer now|pg||
mb|1H|nt|wilkinsona: odds are the final contract will be doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: so well done by Derek Sanders for the first big swing of the match|pg||
mb|2D!|an|3 or 4 trump raise|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: fit jumps at the 5 level, crickey|pg||
nt|rnmalik: last board of the segment|pg||
nt|xenya: and this is the last board of stanza 4|pg||
nt|xenya: i like S's 3N -- somewhat unfortunate N had 6 spades and bid them|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rednaxela: We have been too high for the last three bids.  Will it stop?|pg||
nt|xenya: 4 more to come|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yes, but if he bid 3 spades first he would then pass 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: E promising 15-17 now|pg||
nt|xenya: 1N=15-17|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: last board of this set.. thanks everyone, next set starts 2pm GMT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wilkinsona: and straight into bat again..|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if covers 7&8 guarantee a stopper|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not so easy to see where tricks come from here..|pg||
nt|xenya: playing a strong NT, EW would have probably landed in 2@S -- i wonder if that was available here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6@D?|pg||
nt|rednaxela: too high to make, I meant.  5@c was obviously a great save.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wilkinsona: thats a well judged pass of 4 clubs by John Matheson...|pg||
nt|xenya: he could hardly do that in their methods i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: 2 Heart - reverse attitude, suit preference|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: oops..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: that pass by Bif...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...invites the wrong decision...|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Converting to 6@d gave E/W two more chances to go wrong at no extra cost!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Sanders is wondering what the pass meant|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if it gave him  a choice, he might go on|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N looks quite playable here -- the 2@D opening (somewhat unorthodox perhaps) seems to have worked well|pg||
nt|xenya: this requires careful play|pg||
nt|justin c: 2@C some sort of checkback looking for @S fit|pg||
nt|justin c: and finding it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yo_yo: yes and McGeorge shows a max with 3@S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|wilkinsona: ..admit I would't find it..|pg||
pc|h3|nt|wilkinsona: may pass, dont really expect him to x|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh oh|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: Now North is thinking|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south should have doubled, surely|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: not that 2@S is much better on this layout|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that double didnt take long|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|justin c: i have to go, bye all|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bye|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wilkinsona: it is, but after this sequence to odds that 2 spades is preferable have changed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Derek has had not much luck with finneses..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this contract may be in a spot of bother|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rednaxela: Well, well!|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: Quick as a flash!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: for example, if declarer banks on 3-2 @S, he will go down|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wilkinsona: ...successful with the drop here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wilkinsona: its easy when we see 4 hands, but Bif could have double 6d and stuart 6 h|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer has the rest|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i understand -- still W is 5-4-3-1|pg||
nt|justin c: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if so, it will undo a bit of the good work on the two previous boards|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|rnmalik: -1 now|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|wilkinsona: as there is are slight chances that (a) E may have a singleto spade and (b) E may elect to raise with 3|pg||
nt|xenya: and that's what has happened|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @DA and K@H|pg||
nt|xenya: the @D A is right, but declarer found it out too late|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wilkinsona: sorry Gerald double 6 heart I meant|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should be ok now though|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: bye for now|pg||
nt|justin c: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: End of stanza 6, thanks all|pg||

nt|yo_yo: thanks Justin/Stuart|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: protecting against @C being 4-1|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: 9 tricks, narrowing the gap a bit|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h8|nt|vugraphzak: restart 11:10 - thx all|pg||

nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: bye for now|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: 3 levels lower in OR!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: still a swing then to Collins |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks all|pg||
nt|xenya: to be fair, the layout was not too favourable|pg||
nt|xenya: but declarer could have coped it seems|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: Thanks all, we will be back shortly for Stanza 5 at 15:10 |pg||
