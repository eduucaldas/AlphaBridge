nt|chthonic: Hello, Roland and David|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: Robson has judged well to defend|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: only 1 overboard, not a bad crossing|pg||
nt|ady: looks like a push|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes.  hard to judge accurately|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Well, defense still has to perform|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzbe: sorry, different distribution|pg||
nt|athene: @CJ lead could be ducked by declarer|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|april7: could it be a misunderstandingß|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hello again|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome back to Stanza 5 of the Gold Cup Semi Final  Christine|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petepunt: nice relaxing 1st board|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|Walddk7: Morning David, Peter and Mike|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chthonic: good signaling by defense here -- I assume both have suit preferenced for hearts|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome back to the 2nd stanza with your operators Christine and Stuart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult to judge what the South hand is worth facing a 2NT opener|pg||
nt|athene: this would have decent chances on a minor-suit lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: AKx of hearts would be better, with the @CQ instead. @HQ is rather wasted  |pg||
nt|april7: unfortunately 1 down, no parkingplace for the @S or @D loser|pg||
nt|athene: as it is, he might duck a spade and hope for (very unlikely) minor-suit squeeze|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: S asking if 4th lead, E says no as he has doubled, therefore presuming its a 3rd or 5th card lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we could speculate about this for some time, methinks|pg||
nt|athene: ducking a spade rectifies the count but also gives up on the @SJ being some sort of menace|pg||
nt|athene: he will be thinking about complicated three-suit squeezes without the count|pg||
nt|athene: we may be here for some time...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as one does...|pg||
nt|april7: whats the difference whether its 4th or 3d/5th lead|pg||
nt|athene: i think north should bid 3@C over 2@S here|pg||
nt|chthonic: Not sure about covering that card.  Was ten tricks, now nine|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: if he isn't going to open 3@C|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|athene: there might be some ending where you really need to know the distribution|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk7: and good morning to Jeffrey Allerton|pg||
nt|jallerton: Hello everybody|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petepunt: hi jeff|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome back|pg||
nt|chthonic: With the club lead, five will roll smoothly|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, Chris seemed to suspect some underhand lead from south|pg||
nt|chthonic: surely a diamond now|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s9|nt|petepunt: looks like he wil play for a @D @C sqz that doesnt work|pg||
nt|athene: even if you got to a successful throw-in ending (e.g. @SKQ, @CQ with east) he could just exit with the @CQ to block the suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if West throws a club now, he likely has five, with four on the table|pg||
nt|chthonic: absolutely|pg||
pc|h4|nt|april7: back again and good afternoon|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes good defence|pg||
nt|chthonic: well defended|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: the trumps lie well for the double finesse, but entries to dummy are just a bit short :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: yes, minor-suit squeeze looks the best (only) legitimate chance|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|april7: so thats why it goes down 1|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: south just did too much|pg||
nt|chthonic: now eight if a heart had been led for uppercut|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petepunt: where did it go wrongin the bidding ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: number of tricks going down, hearts ruff missed tho'|pg||

nt|Walddk7: 13 tricks??|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome to the Gold cup Semifinal Christine Walker operating|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (on a 2-1 trump split)|pg||
nt|april7: duülication of values|pg||
nt|xenya: EW were a bit lucky on that one|pg||
nt|col3435: yes not much going on in that board|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petepunt: doubt N will raise 1N here|pg||
mb|d|mb|1N!|an|Shows Clubs|nt|athene: yes, surprising decision from west to pass 3nt with four spades and a small doubleton|pg||
nt|col3435: 14-16 NT, I believe?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|april7: here we have an easy 4@S contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a superb exampple of a 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3N seems to work here ith 5 clubs off|pg||
nt|chthonic: It has been suggested that a club at trick two would have made the defense harder.  True, but declarer must also guess clubs.  I am told that was done at other table but clubs not ...|pg||
nt|chthonic: guessed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 1@d = "Stayman"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: In the other s/f Matheson - Sime bid 1N-3N. @HK lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT =17-19|pg||
nt|athene: north way too good for 3@C|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: but no convenient cue-bid; it's possible to use 2NT in that position as the good raise|pg||
nt|april7: it wil be a 4@H contract for EW|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: hard to see how many spades there are for NS|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|chthonic: What was 2H?  |pg||
nt|col3435: well it looks like this sequence shows an invite with 4 spades|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: finding the usual Jxx in dummy |pg||
nt|petepunt: 1@C two + ?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: chance for Robson    has to sniff club position|pg||
nt|chthonic: This will be difficult enough at the five level...|pg||
nt|chthonic: He cannot really bid six |pg||
nt|chthonic: with those spades and no spade cue bid.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petepunt: X of 2@S would be negative and show similar ahand for N|pg||
nt|athene: four top losers, and nowhere to put them even if the defence don't cash them right off|pg||
nt|athene: @H1097 lead more likely than @HK onside; maybe you rise ace here|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 17-19 3Hts|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he just decided that with everyone bidding, Robson had to have a light 2@C overcall, so 3@C wasn't going to hurt|pg||
nt|april7: after ace of@D E has a choice ow plays and might guess wrong, so E must help and lead @C after K of @H|pg||
nt|athene: a trump lead is possible, with declarer known to have three|pg||
nt|athene: trying just to stop a ruff in the closed hand|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|athene: but that sort of "trusting opponents" strategy can allow opps to talk you out of things|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jallerton: yes, any 11-13/17-19 bal or natural|pg||
nt|athene: of course it might find partner's @HQ :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: better to trust your partner|pg||
pc|c7|nt|april7: good duck by N|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|chthonic: Well on the way to nine tricks with straightforward play|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be able to get a count now|pg||
nt|ady: can make now without club finesse|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: 1@D showed @Hs, 2@HS was 4 hearts and minimum -- well, S decided it was worth bidding 4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jallerton: The @d play for 3 tricks anyway, so the lead did not give away the contract|pg||
nt|chthonic: but needed to play diamonds|pg||
nt|col3435: lack of entries to dummy gives you something to worry about|pg||
pc|c6|nt|april7: E guessed wron but still down because 9 and 10 of @D dont drop|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: if declarer had the @D10, it would be necessary for west to play a club now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: so well done|pg||
nt|ady: now set up long diamond|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petepunt: playing 1n as 17-19 means you can bid over 1@C on very min values safely|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|athene: east, of course, knows the diamonds aren't going anywhere for declarer|pg||

nt|vugraphzaf: Are you all right Victor?  Yes, just reflecting.|pg||
nt|ady: cant think how 11 tricks made in 4@S OR|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..but the answer was 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Good, both scores corrected now|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: the defence have lots of time to get their club established against 4@S here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the 6@H was flat, but Silverstoen had a chance - West led a club from the queen|pg||
nt|april7: 2 giants meet|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: JD lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S looks normal for north, assuming 1@S promised five|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: shows hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: wow, he splinters!?|pg||
nt|petepunt:  4@S looks eniugh for me |pg||
nt|april7: 4@S onlyand 5@H only 1 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the overtricks have vanished :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|april7: e won't give up|pg||
nt|athene: some might bid only 3@S with south over the double, but you don't really know what to do when they then bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: so you might as well take the "4@S over 4@H" push right away|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: best lead for the defence here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: now double from east|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@S = 1NT|pg||
nt|april7: N will afterwards consider 5@S|pg||
nt|chthonic: yes, indeed.  Spades beginning with the jack is most effective for declarer.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Hi Its Christine|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzaf: Ooops|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West dumps @DQ to give himself an entry to dummy |pg||
nt|april7: but 5@H is a good save|pg||
nt|athene: surprising lack of activity from east|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: He's doing a great job at the other table|pg||
nt|chthonic: Hi, Christine.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petepunt: E?W did well not to save bit now theyhave to take care in def|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|april7: even making a slam try|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|chthonic: or back to nine ok, too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: strangely may be correct to have ducked the J|pg||
nt|chthonic: interesting point.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chthonic: JD in other room?  Seems same line would have brought in contract.  Robson's play was very nice -- not tested to find club queen as he would have been if two spades were cashed|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: how on earth did 5@H make in the other room? :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: in order to take the spade finesse, perhaps....|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|Walddk7: lol|pg||
nt|april7: 4th @D could be the second discard|pg||
nt|chthonic: this is not best, though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: spade ok for +1 it seems|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|april7: and will|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I meant JD lead gave 11 tricks to this contract|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|april7: so 6@H would have been a good save, but N made the forward move to stop EW|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this ok too|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|athene: Silverstone led his aces|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chthonic: Sorry -- still dwelling on last hand.|pg||
nt|ady: diamond led in OR    club dissappeared   and Hacket cross ruffed and endplayed east in trumps|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this should go off now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west gets in with a heart to promote a second trump it seems|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|chthonic: now the entry is gone for spades|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: so Forrester had two pitches for diamonds, with the ruffing finesse in spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: another good board for leading your own suit, NOT partner's|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: True, David, but North's double told him hearts were not breaking|pg||

nt|mdgraham: undoubled|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: interesting sequence here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this appears to be on the trump hook, and after that diamond lead from ace must be odds on|pg||
nt|chthonic: easy to see from our vantage point that ace of clubs, ruff, AK of trumps and a diamond works.  But what else?    Except the heart finesse|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona: diamond J for -4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: possible 5@C sacrifice EW, but you don't have to sacrifice if the opps don't bid game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and anyway not obvious how EW get in the bidding|pg||
nt|petepunt: its a perfect fit n/s |pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you want to play this hand in game? I suppose it's virtually cold if @s are 2-2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: three minor losers, and the hearts can be played either way |pg||
nt|petepunt: need to guess 1major suit right |pg||
nt|athene: 3@C was clearly intended as pre-emptive|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: west can put two spades through but it doesn't quite give east three trump tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: will silverstone hook the @S9 for the overtrick? :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jallerton: why do you have to guess @h?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: trouble is 3N may de on EW|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: no, the third heart goes on a diamond |pg||
nt|athene: but i am not sure you can play that without a lot of artificial kit, because you need some way to make a real (invitational) 3@C bid|pg||
nt|col3435: South doesn't have much for his 4@d here|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: Silverstone could have taken action    asfar as Dixon was concerned Silverstone might have a bust|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chthonic: this will be bloody |pg||

nt|vugraphzaf: No -4 agreed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@S forcing, no major (X would be hearts; 1@H would be spades)|pg||

pc|hT|nt|petepunt: isnt 1n 17-19 ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d = no 5-card major, 1NT =17-19|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no fears about re-opening|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not a big fan of 1NT, with only one spade stop|pg||
nt|athene: silverstone just needs to know if his partner has a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|athene: if he has, 6@C must be good|pg||
pc|cK|nt|col3435: so what does N have avaiable here? Is this showing short @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 3@S - singleton club 3 suit hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzaf: In principle 44 Majors  but TF judged his hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: will worry @D may be 4-1|pg||
nt|jallerton: Declarer may try to lead a @s hoping 2nd hand has the ace, planning to switch to @d|pg||
nt|jallerton: though contuining @s OK if with @s 3-3 or guesses @h|pg||
nt|jallerton: Declarer does not know that @c are 4-4|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks like 7 tricks tho.|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you might bid 1nt to show values, but here, partner is never moving over it anyway, so you aren't getting to game|pg||
nt|april7: If N finds Q of @C, 7 tricks, if not....|pg||
nt|athene: so why not just bid 2@D?|pg||
nt|april7: should E have a singleton @D then 6 @C to be made|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: yep, thats what happened OR|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petepunt: inersting tx|pg||

nt|athene: he might have made the game anyway, though, of course|pg||

nt|athene: 3@D will get them started|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petepunt: 5@D will be found now maybe |pg||
nt|april7: 4@H is maximum, so 5 @D a very good save and might push EW to 5 level|pg||

nt|athene: oh, sorry, of course he couldn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: I would open, but maybe there are system points we don't know|pg||
mb|1S|nt|josj: appeal pending in China v. Ch. Taipei match|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: yes score up after every 8 boads|pg||
nt|athene: he needed two diamond tricks :)|pg||
nt|col3435: I'd bid 1@h with the North hand, I think double is unusual these days|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  or 3NT for e/w |pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: he doesn't know that EW aren't going to end up in spades|pg||
nt|april7: without a @C lead, perhaps Q of @H lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: A failing 4@H seems possible here. |pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 5@C sugested as more informative by S first time|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps thought that dummy was likely to have a trick source in clubs, in which case an aggressive lead was necessary|pg||
mb|3H|nt|april7: due to the 6card suit W might raies to 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: I agree.  South showed some restraint -- a good thing|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   by Silverstone not so good on J@C lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: East will certainly bid game|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jallerton: Yes, this is the last board of the set.  Thanks to our operator, Christine Walker.|pg||
nt|col3435: they're short sets by vugraph standards|pg||
nt|petepunt: a bit of explaining needed to robson :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny how we tend to play sets of eight when most others seem to play sets of 16|pg||
nt|jallerton: A bit of waiting for Robson to finish too!|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Thanks ably assisted by Stuart Bradnam|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might consider holding up the @CK and finessing diamonds into north - that would be right if north had the @HA |pg||
nt|athene: but when people respond 2@C to 1major, it's very often just a balanced hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chthonic: I pass many hands my partners think I should open, but 13 HCP, 2 1/2 quick tricks and two four card majors is a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: 3NT had some chances as they avoided the spade lead on the bidding|pg||
pc|h6|nt|april7: E might duck @C and try to finesse @D the right way|pg||
nt|athene: but you look very silly if you lose to @DQx and south has the @HA as entry|pg||
nt|athene: anyway, the @DQ appears so all is well|pg||
nt|davidstern: That isnt the best lead for the defence|pg||
nt|davidstern: 10 tricks now 1-5-1-3|pg||
nt|davidstern: Unless declarer gets confused by the lead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: as it happens clubs are blocked  and Robson has not entry    so 3NT will make even on wrong spade guess|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|davidstern: Which he hasn't|pg||
pc|d3|nt|april7: thats true, but if its successful, then?|pg||

nt|petepunt: restart at 11:10, time penalties apply ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well judged by EW - 5@H is down one|pg||
nt|athene: i might have been a little bit worried with east - you do have a very pure hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: N/S likely to take out insurance in 6@D if Hackets bids one more .|pg||
nt|april7: is 1NT by E forcing, in what system?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 17-19|pg||
nt|april7: tu|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a huge fan of 1nt - the sixth heart is too important to bury|pg||
nt|athene: but anyway, they have wandered into game :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well the pass cost as 4 hearts made OR|pg||
nt|chthonic: Twelve IMPs away on the passed out hand|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: i assume 2@C was two-way checkback (forces 2@D, then 2@S is invitational)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS never bid at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: exactly as explained|pg||
nt|davidstern: Mind you he had to play it well to make. I wouldn't like to have to go back to my team mates and explain why I didnt open|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: it might be more of a double fit - give west the @SK instead of the @DA, for example|pg||
