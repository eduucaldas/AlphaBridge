nt|hedyg: this is the tightest match of the round of 16|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't believe that Clair passed|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: wrong board|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe they are not playing this board at all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: wait a moment|pg||
nt|hedyg: Carlo would not open 1NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1NT not exactly textbook either|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like they turned the board|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe "tightest match" meant...|pg||
nt|hedyg: closest score Marshall|pg||
nt|hedyg: might a free translation from French|pg||
nt|Walddk2: wronf file it seems. open room operator shut down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "tight" is american slang for "tipsy"|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: wrong file system|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: 2 minutes|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yo_yo: hi everyone from a foggy, freezing Manchester|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looking at the NS hands, 6@C is not so unreasonable |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 6@C is pretty good and preemption might boost them into it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nothing new there then|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Yes nightmer|pg||
nt|milton_se: buying this cheaply|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not lucky enough perhaps?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: But it's awkward to bid 5@C now since partner will think opener has more hearts|pg||
nt|henryb: Have Fantunes changed system? The last time I watched them they played forcing one bids and 10-13 two bids|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No change there|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they're in the open room:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might take the money here|pg||
nt|hedyg: double passed out by Versace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: If the defence never leads @H, 4@S might not make|pg||
mb|5D|nt|hawe45:  As long as E/W doÂ´nt touch the @H-suit, all is OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Do we know if 2@C is natural?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: GF|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks natural|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would be tempted to bid 5@D with an 8 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Takes a very good defence to defeat 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: E-W play Angelini's version of Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  canape sequence from north it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1any has always been forcing, 14+   and 2any  10-14|pg||
nt|henryb: Ah, but we do not have Fantunes|pg||
nt|brolucius: South can discount a slam since they play a strong 1@C system.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: @d lead?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well as cards lie 6 of a red looks pretty good|pg||
nt|lestergold: not suggesting it should be bid!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Notice the canapé style of N-S. So Blue Club it is, Simon?|pg||
nt|othered1: Old-fashioned forcing 2N would describe south's hand well, too.|pg||
nt|hedyg: guess he already showed that with 4 @d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is a very interesting match|pg||
nt|hedyg: N could have raised to 3@D|pg||
pc|h3|nt|milton_se: not a double?|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N looks fairly cold also|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N+2 looks likely at both tables|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: after this board, i'll ask them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Andrea Manno is one of the Italian rising stars. Still a junior, in his early 20's I think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West does have a tricky decision at trick 2|pg||
nt|petergill: @CQ shows the jack, then West should continue clubs, I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: but his pd acted anyhow|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona:  this might go ddown..|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like off 4?|pg||
nt|varange: do you know much about NS Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S with four cards is somewhat dangerous when you know that partner has close to nothing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DA and another is the only defence|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|othered1: What would be the effect of @CK under the ace?|pg||
nt|othered1: @DK, rather|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We shall see|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Drop the King, South|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1st hurdle overcome by Giubilo, but then what?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: would be a good play. South must be aware of extreme diamond length|pg||
nt|varange: hi Giorgio|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me find a Nightmare CC|pg||
nt|varange: the lastest version please Roland, not the old one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Roland|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, I don't know them|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And no old-fashioned signalling with the trumps E/W, please|pg||
nt|petergill: unless Wes worries that South's @H losers might go on dumy's |pg||
nt|petergill: @D's|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lanzarotti-Manno had a terrific first set against Fantoni-Nunes last night|pg||
nt|daman: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: hi|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi George :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: At least|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 1@H showed @s|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing a standard system, South would have to bid 2@D (fourth suit) at his second turn, in case North was strong and a slam was a good bet.|pg||
nt|bardo: 3 sa anche in aperta|pg||
nt|henryb: Playing a standard system North would open 1@c, S 1@d, N 1@H, S 1@s, N 2@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: here is a nightmare CC http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf    this is what they play, more or less|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Simon|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: might depend on EW's carding agreements|pg||
pc|h4|nt|milton_se: y, especially when Cs may be an option|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The king would not help against good defenders as East would follow with the 10 from 108x|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Full credit to Giubilo regardless. Very well done!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyway, down now. Unlucky.|pg||
nt|othered1: Right, can't do better than make winning decision|pg||
nt|hedyg: so as usual Versace made the right decision|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: 1NT was a stronger  NT than 15/17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I could think of a few puns with South's name involved :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course at tis stage declarer cannot be sure of hs contract]|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: More if declarer isn't careful|pg||
nt|brolucius: If the @S2 was indeed led from a 4-card suit (which is a good bet if 4th-best leads are in operation), declarer would know that the contract was safe. He could lose no more than ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: three spades and the @CK. By playing the @SJ, he breaks communications when West has five spades. |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Same lead against 6 NT - and Soiuth can make it double-dummy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|varange: :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no 15-17|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice 10@s in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  There is a danger in the @C-suit, if North tries some safety-play - and East plays the Jack. Might give North bad plans.|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Simon, i thought you said they play strong NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: hi|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wilkinsona:  ok,....ddddown|pg||
nt|sharkey: Lauria knows pd is void in @S as wud have played Q from QJ|pg||
nt|varange: no limericks please!|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dK|nt|hedyg: and he did have 19 hcps|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yeah, cause usually who plays strong @c play weak nt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems very logical|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  lucky we can see all the hands and know that every card is right|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|petergill: Manno will play off 5 or 6 rounds of @S|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|brolucius: East still has a spade, so the suit will be 4-4 (unless West found an unlikely lead from a 3-card suit into a bid suit).|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Nightmare was wrote for Buratti - Probably now they will play different gadgets, but the base of system is for sure the same of book|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: this club suit aint coming in|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hawe45:  Defence has placed the @C-stopper at West only, bad idea|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|varange: no easy exit available, is there?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, S is sort of endplayed|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: West's @C8 was best - a @h would have been fatal|pg||
nt|petergill: @D or @h now?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: west about to have his 2h promoted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria knows the whole hand now and will pitch a diamond|pg||
nt|sharkey: In OR E overcalled 1@S thus N not subjected to the pressure bid 4@S - so no sacrifice|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  It makes now!|pg||
nt|petergill: If West discarded a @H when he pitched @H8, South crosses to @Dk, leads a heart up, then pins @HJ10|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There's a lot of play left in this hand.  This is where GIB doesn't really help us|pg||
nt|petergill: I think @C4 looks OK, but I'm not sure|pg||
nt|petergill: When I wrote @H8, I meant @C8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I suppose it's the last trump that really turns the screw ... but will declarer know this?|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot avoid losing 2 @cs|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a fine system. I like that 18-19 balanced is included in the 1@D opening|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt weak, so 1@c can be 15/17 bal - 1@C can have 11hcp with 6@c 5x ! or any 15+ with 4+@C|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Nunes is out of table|pg||
nt|bridge_one: thie the old version - they change frequently the sequence, overall when change the partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  1M  ;  1NT  18-19   much better than the awkward jump to 2NT|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H can be 4 cards in 3 suit hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Those who missed the first set did not miss anything. The bridge was pretty awful (if you are wllowed to use pretty and awful in the same sentence)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: And will he pick the position?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wrong again|pg||
nt|milton_se: trying to beat it costs an overtrick|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: We can see that he can make it if he reads the position, but he can't|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|milton_se: but it is for free|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Which I think is to drop West's @HAK doubleton|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|petergill: @HJ clarifies to East that it is South who has @HQxx|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|sharkey: off 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but a diamond pitch would had led to 800|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  Aftes EastÂ´s double: Yes|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, the @CK was onside.|pg||
nt|petergill: Good defence|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk2: What a start, great hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It could certainly be argued that the bidding was helpful|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and funny bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: Fantastic hand - perhaps South might have picked the ending|pg||

mb|d|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: and that was with a 1@d opening in E|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: you started off something here Roland|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol Simon|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3N should go off on careful defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: but might it now before pd leads a @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: nope|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1nt possible, 2Nt long to make - so 2@s open would work here|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: uwelcome|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d played in EW|pg||
nt|othered1: I couldn't stay out if they had bid the pointed suits|pg||
nt|tomi2: is this the event that sends its champion the the European Champions Cup next year? I mean in Germany we also have a KO Cup and a Round Robin League, here the league is more ...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: West's hand is suited for a strong jump shift at his first turn, but no-one plays those any more I guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 2@S and then 4@S, to show a great suit but not many controls.|pg||
nt|daman: very oxymoronic|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems, that only South is vulnerable...!|pg||
nt|hedyg: no entry to the S hand for a @H finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: can doublefinesse in both black suits|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@h with maximum .... strange|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Rehi, everyone!|pg||
nt|hedyg: re Ed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: technically is correct to play double finesse - so 4@h made|pg||
nt|varange: hi Ed|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: I am Fabio not Simon :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Paper thin game ... but once East has opened, it's inevitable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nunes is in the same position in the other room. With four cards left, East is down to the singleton @HK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer has @HQx and @DAx|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: seems 2@H was forcing..|pg||
nt|xenya: a wheel came off?|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh sry Fabio!|pg||
nt|hedyg: ciaooooo!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: we have changed|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ciaooo|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Funny situation - you must play for 2-2 in @D or accept to loose a trich to SOUTH, not to North|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and read it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  unless its led|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  even when I do play em I can't get my partners to use them|pg||
nt|lestergold: this must mean please make a cue bid pard|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: We often see the weak jump shift mis-used on BBO VuGraph, so perhaps better to play strong jump shifts, even if you never use them.|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: two|pg||
nt|milton_se: nice to agree on what´s forcing :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so i see!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: Assuming a @S lead dont think you need @C finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: here declafrer can afford the safety play|pg||
nt|hedyg: not really enough for reverse|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure - but minimum!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The @H-suit brings this 3 NT safely home|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a @s lead...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Whatever lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: guess @h help the declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: now he needs to ask for another one!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: lauria is a good soldier:)|pg||
nt|henryb: Its not that uncommon to play strong JS at the two level in a 2/1 structure|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S is forcing because it was preceded by the fourth-suit bid.|pg||
nt|lestergold: but Lauria with massive controls will soon get the message] |pg||
nt|brolucius: West might 'invent' 4@D, to see if East has a heart control.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i agree|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: it's the winning bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: not actually easy to bid this hand|pg||
nt|henryb: look how easy this hand is after 1@d-2@s: East splinters with 4@h and West bids Backwood|pg||
nt|brolucius: Obviously does not show a diamond control, when bid so slowly... |pg||
nt|Walddk2: West in the other room could not be 100% certain that they had a heart control between them|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sometimes you have to lie:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: going for the throat|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow a rare thing to see 2 @H X|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Back in the match|pg||
nt|hedyg: did he find an extra ace?|pg||
nt|daman: would 2NT by North always be 15-18?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: but we were deprivd of watchi9ng for it|pg||
nt|hedyg: and a @d switch..|pg||
nt|othered1: avoided trump lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - but created by NorthÂ´s bidding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ok - 3@h is 4 cards with minimum, can be 14 only with 4333 - right - agrre the gadget|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: in open room the heart barrage by n/s identified the heart shortnes to west|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  well bid 4 hearts, thats good lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: Lauria cannot/willnot pass with this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Long pause then 4@S is not really the way to bid the hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S seems a bit risky on those values.|pg||
nt|tomi2: he fount out, that he was kind of off-shape, and tried to reapir this, but this does not work, because with extra points he would bid like this as well|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hedyg: well i know a balancing X can be less than 13 hcps ( with short @hs), but i really think he had no more bid|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: overbidding|pg||
nt|daman: it is not easy to beat 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: W feeling endplayed already|pg||
nt|daman: @D 10 is the key card|pg||
nt|daman: he  will play a @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would play 10@d asking pd not to play @D back|pg||
nt|daman: if he doesn't    they should make|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hawe45:  YES - take @S Ace and play @H|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: cambiaghi apologize for his bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: franco saved him|pg||
nt|xenya: this one might not be easy|pg||
nt|irwinbo: he will now make it|pg||
nt|hedyg: actually the @c gave nothing, declarer would have played small @c to jack|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for sure - also more that one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Irwin :)|pg||
nt|varange: and then to not forget :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be OK after a jump shift but West has not really suggested full slam values, just because he bid 3@S.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D does not help Giubilo one bit|pg||
nt|lestergold: still hard here how does west know that Lauria hasnt got two small hearts now?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: at least South turned up with 3 nice @H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Right defence means 500|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: if i had another @H i would play it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: so 2 @H was nf?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed - and here it will be difficult to get a @C ruff|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brolucius: West correctly assumes that East must have a heart control for his strong bidding with nothing in trumps.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 4@S denied a red cue bid (I assume it did), 5@D should also promise a heart control|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: without club lead declarer can afford to bang down club ace before leading up to it to cater for the KC stiff|pg||
nt|xenya: not clear what happened -- any ideas?|pg||
nt|daman: not many entries for plays in the minors     @D to the 9 now would work|pg||
pc|d5|nt|wilkinsona:  has east not shown 5 diamonds 4clubs and 3 spades, perhaps|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe playing a spade, that looks like e had a doubleton would be a good idea, in case his partner did not open 2@H and tell opps he had no 4 spades|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|daman: same diff|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is the moment|pg||
pc|s8|nt|daman: he is still OK|pg||
nt|daman: win the @S and play the @D Q|pg||
nt|hedyg: @ss and @ds could both be 3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: 1 IMP back here|pg||
nt|brolucius: With a singleton heart in dummy, South's signal should be suit-preference - not that it makes any difference here.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d7|nt|varange: maybe some misunderstanding of what 2@d means|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not think he has said anything about club length it was just a cue|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Well defended, West|pg||
nt|hedyg: but 14 is their maximum Gio!|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT is 12.14|pg||
nt|varange: yes, but he has 4333|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, maximum only with 4333|pg||
nt|petergill: A low heart opening lead might have worked, but is not likely in the real world|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You find pairs, who lead smalle from a doubleton...!|pg||
nt|hedyg: he would like to play a @d to the 9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphztg: y|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: pass or correct|pg||
nt|xenya: he chose a wrong plan it seems|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Simon :) you are the best!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Listen: We have 4 @H, 3 @C + 2 ACES - here in Denmark the total is 9|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but how do you know you have 4 hearts?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That combines 3-3 @H OR 3-3 @C - not so bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 2@C did, Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I think Lauria has shown 3154|pg||
nt|daman: hhhhhrrrrrrrrrmmmmmm|pg||
nt|hedyg: Q@D now?|pg||
nt|daman: unblock  yes|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|daman: no choice really|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|hedyg: you play A@H and @H ducked and then?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hawe45:  I puy my money on West|pg||
nt|hedyg: small @s|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hawe45:  More @h|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: otherwise minimum|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - push|pg||
nt|daman: if he was going to play the hand that was    he should have won the @S Ace and played the @D Queen|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc 1 @h on @D and cash A@S|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: He's not going to care if South has @DQxx|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|hedyg: only if you can see through the cards|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: you lose 2 hearts if they are 4-2 and 3 spades then|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now only 200|pg||
nt|othered1: I like that equation (4-3-3-3 with minimum)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this table is interesting to see the new style in bridge - Fantoni Nunes invention is 2 level open for any 5+cards 10/12|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot doublefinesse @S now|pg||
nt|hedyg: so must guess|pg||
nt|milton_se: that 3rd club seems to be a mistake|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Lanzarotti use many interesting gadget (1@H 1@S with or withour 4cards, jump in xfert for majors, 1M 3minor = limit 6in minor and 4cards in other major, etc.)|pg||

nt|varange: are they waving their arms, Simon?|pg||
nt|lestergold: tru i think that you are right that the bidding suggested the shape he held|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: not at all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they're talking about this auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: if 3055 then should have bid granny|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  yep, could be director time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next possible slam|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no director|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Angelini team quick out of the starting block|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Masselli will be relieved  to go only one down|pg||
nt|hedyg: new leader|pg||
nt|milton_se: still better to take 1st S finesse b4 the 3rd club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right, Krustjev is now playing|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: bad bid , bad played|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 2NT bid not deserve to make 3 NT|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|lestergold: 4H infran|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To whom belongs the 5-level?|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS play weak NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: weak NT (may be not vuln, o am not sure if they play weak Nt also vul)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Accurate bidding is so much easier when there is no director present.|pg||
nt|lestergold: this not quite as good a slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the open room E-W are in 4@SX|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is a very strong weak NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wasn't he the man with the shoe?|pg||
nt|tomi2: he pitched the "relatively" good club on @D instead od the bad heart?|pg||
nt|daman: well he knew he had a @H loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Looks like 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this colour that will not bea great success|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: both of pairs|pg||
nt|hedyg: @H suit got lost|pg||
nt|hedyg: W could double 1@s and correct a @c bid by pd to @d|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: EO to play, NS defense|pg||
nt|brolucius: If declarer is in a high heart contract, the odds favour playing East for the @HQ after West's overcall.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt weak but can be also with 5 Major|pg||
nt|hedyg: 11-14 NT|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sharkey: Makes played by E - otherwise has to guess @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be the first swing board|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  but 5 hearts went -2 OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe trying to make 5 lost an extra trick|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the pass of north natural - strange playing weak nt|pg||
nt|milton_se: now already too high|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To throw a shoe is forbidden now|pg||
nt|petergill: EW heading towards 4@H, I think|pg||
nt|daman: he played the @S and @Ds wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: W bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: dbl?|pg||
nt|daman: -5 instead of + 10|pg||
nt|daman: I would pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: W is endplayed|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks normal to me, just maximum|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sharkey: assume misguessed @S - finesse |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT is not as good as 4@H, as the cards lie. |pg||
nt|daman: double is aiming for a small target     partner already passed 1 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: maybe dim lead took spade finesse? to pitch dim??|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  appears to be so|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no i 'm wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll take my 800 any day of the week|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like about 9 imps to angelinin|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: hope they get to 5@H as 4@H not too interesting...:)|pg||

nt|hawe45:  13 tricks on a ruffing finesse in @C|pg||

nt|milton_se: mandatory trump lead|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H, 3@D or 3NT now? |pg||

nt|petergill: Versace shows his club support|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: W seam end playd from the start of hand :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: needed to grab the lead in dummy and finesse spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: auction in open was kamikazi|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  seems that north left a bit unsaid in the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14.7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=KQx+Axx+xx+AJ9xx|pg||
nt|othered1: strange for north to make a try opposite 11-14|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: well im urprised on tehse values that e/w felt they could afford a slam investigation to 5 level|pg||
nt|hedyg: if  he played Q@s before @c and KJ are in N and @cs dont work he is down?|pg||
nt|milton_se: needs an optimistic mind :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no chance for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Angelini's 4@C next door is not easy to understand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: His hand has defence written all over it|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  diamond lead, ruffing spade hook diamond pitch and led a club up allowing a ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very expensive foray that was|pg||
nt|brolucius: He did, but they play a strong 1@C, so South could not be that good.|pg||
nt|cuan: 4612|pg||
nt|petergill: and thus shows his singleton @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good bidding here|pg||
nt|hedyg: a high @D to show K@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: Angelini + 33|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45:  Whar is East looking for here? I would stupidly bid 4 @s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4@H is tres tricky|pg||
nt|petergill: With 4513 and opening strength, perhaps West would Dbl 1@D|pg||
nt|petergill: and East knows that West would bid a 4513 like that|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: well he has not made it yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bidding 4 over 3 is almost always wrong|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer is possibly best off not trying to finesse for @HQ|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he will ruff the 2nd @D, cross to @SK then play @H3, in case South has a singleton heart honour|pg||
pc|h9|nt|wilkinsona:  ..not so sure..|pg||
nt|irwinbo: a hheart was the best lead  hard for west except that he then doesn't lead away from an aq combination|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The only problem with that is that it starts to expose the spade losers|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: the correct contract could be 3NT or 5 @c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I guess it depends if West is allowed to rebid 1NT with a 1444 shape|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe they are allowed to rebid 1N with stiff @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good reason|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: now he has|pg||
nt|othered1: Depending on what redouble means, I'm not sure that 3@C is intuitive either|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not more that 6 tricks for defence|pg||
nt|petergill: but he might worry that on that line, @HA then spade though is bad for declarer, so perhaps cross to dummy in clubs?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: I think that's a bit better - if you are going to cross at all|pg||
pc|h2|nt|varange: now the finesse|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might as well try a club. Why not?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: an expense of 13 imps|pg||
nt|xenya: the 2@S in the OR looks even more hopeless, yet it was made|pg||
nt|petergill: hence Bill's suggestion about leading trumps out of hand|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs offering me dinner if he makes this...|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|hedyg: 2@ss on @h and claim 12|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: @c is his only hope now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer is gradually drawing trumps.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after initial Dbl the play is easy for declarer - A@S in W is like sure|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  Playing @D Ace forced him not to finesse - no way back|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petergill: Versace worked it out better than my first attempt - club to dummy was best|pg||

mc|7|nt|lestergold: hi|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: canape|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a big mistake, but E  hide his @h very well|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @D - played by NORTH!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: another weak open two suit - we will se how they arrange this hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  now here is a slam hand..|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes oon a non dimaond lead|pg||
nt|henryb: a quasi-slam, anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however a junior that play with Lanzarotti is for sure a good player :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Very good declarer play!!!|pg||
nt|petergill: @HK in case North has @HQ and can give South a club ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: Great hands, these|pg||
nt|daman: if they make it all the way to slam they will be disappointed|pg||
nt|tomi2: is there no "Lavazza" team in this competition?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|milton_se: a very good 6D here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  a couple of diamond cue bids along the way|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Nice game in OR|pg||
mb|2C|nt|wilkinsona:  Lauria played carefully just to lose 2 clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w did wll to bid game here- finding a perfect fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West passed, and East had an interesting three-suited 2@C opening available next door|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass - italian style|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also foe E/W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: weak Nt in all vuln|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@C suction?|pg||
nt|varange: look slike it|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: well good enuf for roland on the grounds that chances of them getting away with a slam is better than 12.85%|pg||
nt|milton_se: or trash|pg||
mb|3S|nt|varange: the SDAM theory again - Six Diamonds Always Makes :)|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@c strong or natural?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Natural|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: nat|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  first diamond bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: e4spwecially if they splinter a diamond void instead of a heart void|pg||
nt|bridge_one: interesting convention - 2x over 1nt = x+1 suit or x+2/x+3 two suit hand - ungherese convention|pg||
nt|bridge_one: suction - corect|pg||
nt|bridge_one: correct|pg||
nt|othered1: so I assume 2@H is choice of major promising @D fit,if that's what north has|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@h means @D fit|pg||
nt|othered1: this does give opponents lots of information about both hands, if it can be of use|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D relay, 2@H singleton spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: likely to be bid here also now|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s shows 6-5, not strong|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: the safe contract, but @hA is on side, so the problem is to find 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS system : http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fiori_Napoletano.txt|pg||
nt|xenya: finding a fit in a minor after 1N opening is often a problem|pg||
nt|xenya: an exercise in slam bidding -- shouldn't be too difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Italy/angelini-sementa.pdf  I believe this is the card Angelini plays with Versace too|pg||
nt|henryb: why 3@d and not two?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's their NT opener?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 15-17|pg||
nt|othered1: west doesn't have a 1N opener, regardless of range, playing with someone who can bid as well as east|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i see Giubilo doesnt open 1NT with 5/4 in the blacks|pg||
nt|hedyg: wish i knew what 2@c is|pg||
nt|hedyg: E knows he has too many hcps in minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: @D lead would be good if S showed @ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: and 2 @s|pg||
nt|petergill: I think it's good to see the world's best players (EW here, and NS at the other table) outplaying the commentators who can see 52 cards to their 26|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: sry 1 NT= 13-16 then?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i bid 3@s with S cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @S beat|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  lead inhibitor|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Henry seems we have more commentators than specs hwere|pg||
nt|tomi2: but he has Qx support and AAK, isnt this worth some kind of slamtry?  maybe the problem is to show his partner if he supports hearts or spades, so he chose the "easy" way|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@C is useless, no?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: agree vladimir, but 3nt from S gave no options|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In the northern part of Europe, you are NOT allowed to pass a hand like EastÂ´s|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: at least 5-4 minors short in @s ga,e try or more|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: more east to find 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the rest of the world neither|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 9 tricks easy|pg||
nt|milton_se: now they can't miss it|pg||
nt|hedyg: Simon can you help us?|pg||
nt|hedyg: opposite 2 singletons|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: 11 tricks appear possible if defenders fail to draw some trumps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C may be some sort of ask - 2@S maximum?|pg||
nt|othered1: well fittijng hands, with no unsupported Q or J.  HCPs don't do these hands justice|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: here i'm|pg||
nt|hedyg: spec suggests 2@c= xfer to 2@d except if pd has 15+ or 6 @cs|pg||

nt|Walddk2: We don't have 521 commentators|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: exact|pg||

nt|bjacobs: We have to pray that one of them will do something really dumb.  Not likely, I suppose|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Board 19: A spec gives me the mood to ask, what if South duck simply with the @H QUEEN?|pg||
nt|tomi2: depending on partnes quality in spades, if he had AKQJx it wd be an unsefull discard|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Nunes led the mandatory trump against the known Marmic hand|pg||
nt|milton_se: question is: will they go for 7?|pg||
nt|varange: he'll look for the grand, will he?|pg||
nt|brolucius: West described his hand a lot better here than his counterpart managed at the other table.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 plus 2 plus 1 i think about that yes|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No problem, spade to hand, and clear the last trump|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  ItÂ´s not logical to pass the East-hand - and the bid later on |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or a club for that matter|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bridge_one: late|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|varange: well stopped|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantunes are in 7@D next door|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No play|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: isn't better to continue the bid with a cuebid dialog?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: if my p has the k@h|pg||
nt|xenya: well if N had the @HK instead of the @SK...  |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 7 is cash|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  3 x @H is a good start for the defence|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: he can ruff 1 @h and 1 @d for 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d8|nt|milton_se: depends on the meaning of 2S -- if it denies H stopper, or just 2nd suit|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a push |pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 2@S=4@S, 5@C, 14-15 hcp|pg||
nt|othered1: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: more likely|pg||
nt|hedyg: 11 with QJ@D dropping|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@c is a txs for 2@d when opener has a minimum hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: can pull AK @S first|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Are you SURE?!?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|irwinbo: east is squeezed isn't he|pg||
nt|hedyg: attitude leads? or 3/5? or Slawinsky?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: attitude|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|irwinbo: east is squeezed isn't he|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: @h now|pg||
nt|hedyg: so is dummy soon|pg||
nt|bridge_one: automatic squeeze vs East, true Irwin|pg||
nt|hedyg: not trying to play a @s for ruff, knows W must have AK@S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  then|pg||
pc|c5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|henryb: His counterpart showed 16+ with long clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lauria could discount his @HK and had already shown fair spades, so no reason to go on without a helpful card in partner's long suits.|pg||
nt|hedyg: but will ruff @cs :)|pg||

pc|h5|pc|c4|pc|s2|pc|dT|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i cant remember the name of the convention, sharples?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2! ask|pg||
nt|othered1: or any bid (2@S?) to turn auction forcing and looking for minors|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: cause 2@h is @h or something artifical|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ask|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easy bidding, fast play|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This auction is almost automatic|pg||
nt|hedyg: why 1@d?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I must admit, that I dont know their systems and the meaningof this action|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: maybe there's 18-20 bal in their system|pg||
nt|hedyg: i thought NS play 5 card major|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i hope to know more after the auciotn|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: auction|pg||
nt|tomi2: with 18 bal opposite a positive 1nt i would bid easy 3nt, why telling opps too much about this hand. but then again, they maybe need some space to discover their heart fit etc.|pg||
nt|daman: better minor?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|varange: he'll be pleased to see Qxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  well south can upvalue now with the heart bid on the right|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3nt was alerted|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N looks like a sensible alternative. Also 11 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i bet this hyand wont produce a swing|pg||
nt|hedyg: there it is|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl by North means 15+|pg||
mb|6H|nt|lestergold: good point|pg||
nt|sharkey: also assume opening Multi VUL promise a decent suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure if that was Sharples, but then I never played it, so I don't know, really|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @C is good, either @H Ace in North - or two @H-ruffs will make it a winner|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure how they got there|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The Law of Total Tricks tells South not to try to bid something over 5@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And North for that matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: amazing stop here, how did they manage that?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 16 IMPs on board 4|pg||
nt|petergill: NS can make 4@S, or 5@S from the South side (no @D ruff), I think|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: the lead was a@h|pg||
nt|petergill: so the 5@C save is sound|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: versace claim|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: so we will assume it showed @ss|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3nt 5@s and 3@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: @SQ-x-x was not enough for North to bid 3NT on his own, so he bids the hearts one more time. (Particularly as the opening bid promised only four cards).|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  maybe 12 tricks..|pg||
nt|henryb: have you started drinking already?|pg||
nt|daman: now this is interesting|pg||
nt|tomi2: aq6 is not better than aq9 ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1nt ; 10-11 with one 5 card major|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  The wrong hand is playing here - most of us bid 2 NT as East - after pdÂ´s 2 @C|pg||
nt|xenya: not clear|pg||
nt|xenya: they might regret that|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like 9 tricks if he continues @S or not|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With West as declarer, 3 NT has problems|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3nt like a xfert - In Italy we have hight invention :)|pg||
nt|irwinbo: nice lie of the cards  making 5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so presumably 3S would relay to 3N, either to play or to show a minor-oriented slammish hand?|pg||
nt|hedyg: very few top players play 3 NT as natural nowadays|pg||
nt|brolucius: Who, me?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Lauria u reckon gonna go to bed with one of  his bullets?|pg||
nt|henryb: No, Tony|pg||

pc|h3|nt|hedyg: knocking out pd's entry..|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@H showed  4 cards or maximum, 2@s relay, 3@c showed 4-4 @H+@c|pg||

nt|othered1: nothing too easy for east|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: Declarer draws trumps immediately, hoping to educate his partner (who ran into so many ruffs last time he played a heart contract).|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  diamond now, then ruff out the club Q|pg||
nt|henryb: He might hold himself to 10|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|hedyg: is this for real?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as long as W has 3+ diamonds this is cold i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: he needed to play @s from dummy twice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why?|pg||
nt|hedyg: will only make 10 tricks now i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do you mean hearts?|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry yes @H|pg||

nt|othered1: that|pg||
nt|othered1: is a great reading.  Not sure it's clear at the table|pg||
nt|milton_se: not working though -- S shift and D|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|irwinbo: he should have won the third spade in dummy and led a heart|pg||
nt|bridge_one: try 10 in @D down - @D 3/3 near to be impossible - must take the chance to leave the @D at opps that will take in @h|pg||
nt|hedyg: @s shift and 10@d|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but playing that way risks going down in cold contract|pg||

nt|lestergold: glenfidditch?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Ruffing our @CQ does not help a lot as long as the 9 is higher than the 8. I think they play by that rule in Italy|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i think 2 trounds of trumps ending in dummy, then diamond toward hand. when E follows, play another D|pg||
nt|henryb: Perhaps Laphroaig. hallucinatory|pg||
nt|brolucius: I thought Glenfiddith was in the Harry Potter films.|pg||
nt|lestergold: hogmanay  is on the way folks|pg||
nt|lestergold: that was glenquiditch|pg||
nt|hedyg: the OR has kindly overtaken us so we can have comparisons|pg||
nt|othered1: a 20-20 hand, with the OR getting pretty high|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Roland-hand - 20-20|pg||
nt|hedyg: well he didnt have the 1 NT bid to start with..|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think it was a brain freeze.  He miscounted or mis-saw his hand or he thought for an instant 2NT was forcing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Hedy @dKQx in partners suit...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here 3 NT in West is the best spot|pg||
nt|lml: I predict they will get to game this time|pg||
nt|varange: quite a rock crusher in South|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, bit of a misfit|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: Assume EW use 14-16 NT OR - may be problems with 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Better 4 @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 @S from West...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S on a diamond guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, need to lead 8 of D :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3@c ghestem or 1@s?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: two suit for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is Ghestem?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i prefer too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  does not take much to stir you bunch up|pg||
nt|lestergold: ochai the noo|pg||
nt|henryb: so how do we stop in 3@c?|pg||
nt|lestergold: we are rotten sasenacs|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: in 2nt bid, there are weak hands with minor|pg||
nt|daman: NS should end up in a @S partial|pg||
nt|hedyg: these are the last 16 boards of this match and NS are looking for swings i guess|pg||
nt|josj: niet|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  Ew need to flatten 3N made in the other room|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C = 5@D+5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: @s and @d|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If they can bid 5@S by South, Peter, I reckon I can beat it ... I'll find the "obvious" low club lead from West|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|vugraphztg: in 3 position i prefer to open 1nt |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: with that cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT is a transfer to 3@C, I am told.|pg||
nt|henryb: we need something to fill the boring hands, so we pick on careless comments|pg||
nt|hedyg: well that 1@d opening was not a good idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: e/w did well to bid and make 3N in open rather lucky contract needing more favourable positions thatn I ever get|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1 spade is dbl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Toys R USeless|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it is the gheste with exclusion of suit - so 3@C deny @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: whatever it means|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Aggressive raise by Angelini opposite 13-15|pg||
mb|3D|nt|doncapone1: pa  noapte  buna|pg||
nt|lml: good bid by East giving west a choice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now Clair has revealed the diamond position|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1S clear with that hand regardless of toybox|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would he have done if the response had been 2@S?|pg||
nt|othered1: quite a difference in judgement between rooms over the 1N opening|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We would all bid 2 @C - or? (As North)|pg||
nt|petergill: The Law of Total Tricks is notoriously inaccurate at the FIVE level, according to the theory in the latest books|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: always, also after 1red open|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So they might as well take the save in 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: An overcall to show both majors would have worked better here|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed -- EW can take a few tricks in @Hs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S is a transfer to 2NT, and 2NT a transfer to 3@C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 "C neither|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @C|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C must be a bad raise|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt that George|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: Y - with @S lead even @S6 % 5 enter into play|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will Lauria upgrade?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  for example north led a heart vs 3N OR, might not here|pg||
nt|lestergold: if west is now limited to a weak nt then east hasnt got a raise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To sign off in clubs or hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: in 2nt there are weak in @c,weak in @d and strong hands slam try|pg||
nt|othered1: Which @D opening, here or in OR?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North will surely bid again|pg||
nt|hedyg: i like 2@c by a passed hand, would certainly bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: here :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS may catch this|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I prefer - in a natural system - to opoen the East-hand with 1 @C|pg||
nt|varange: bid 2NT and pray?|pg||
nt|varange: over a 2S reposnse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Haven't read 'em.  Don't intend to ...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: or not LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: running scores at http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirank.html|pg||
nt|lml: this one is pretty easy in either game|pg||
nt|xenya: i think 3N didn't seriously suggest a NT contract -- just a descriptive bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 8 or 9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with 6+ hearts or a balanced hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: excellen lead    ...... for..... declarer|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  good system it seems..|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: q642 not really good suit... |pg||
nt|Walddk2: He might have added a point or two for Versace's dummy play|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no X over 4@s, so 5@H?|pg||
nt|xenya: what is all that supposed to mean?|pg||
nt|milton_se: 2S seems optimistic|pg||
nt|xenya: and where will it get them?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cameo could have bid his hand better. Double must be wrong with a singleton heart|pg||
nt|varange: just forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bid a natural 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3@C pass 4@s - now no defence by N/S|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: should do better than 3 NT|pg||
nt|othered1: in a @C system, if I can open 2@C with east's hand, I"d consider it.  But not 1|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bad communication for the defence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On 21 you can beat even 4 @S - double dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is an open book for declarer|pg||
nt|milton_se: any time|pg||
nt|petergill: Most top Italians do not overcall much on 5332 or 6322 shapes - too many losers|pg||
nt|daman: only 2 down|pg||
nt|hedyg: next swing|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@c or nat or weak with 3@s|pg||
nt|tomi2: this system does not work on these deals|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: oh well these guys dont believe in part scores|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol - or going after the VUL game bonus|pg||
nt|lestergold: going after the expected hert lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe spade lead now|pg||
nt|lml: he was showing his club values for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Simon :) what would we do without you!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i was born ready|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: i think this is going off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When South follows to three rounds of spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D   3@C  = major ask|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as if one had opened a natural 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c is better than 1@d, but "natural bidders" might get to 2@c after 1@d-P-P-balance|pg||

nt|othered1: meanwhile, south hasn't made 1N yet|pg||
nt|blunotte11: deve trovare la settima presa|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|daman: well  North turned down the game try   South has no business bidding 4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: 5@C 4@h, will read 3@s, so impossible don't guess the @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now Versace needs to avoid a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: 50 per cent though -- any black lead|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lml: and West could have passed if it was appropriate from his hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me 2nt in this sequence is forcing and shows a 4-card support and @c control and 3@c the same without a @c control|pg||
nt|othered1: @C6 could be a threat|pg||
nt|hedyg: did N really bid X with 6 @hs? he must work this out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D Ace and a @d - the roof comes down|pg||
nt|hedyg: but if he plays A@D and @d ruff N discs 1 @s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Has no alternative, East|pg||
nt|othered1: Is that best defense there?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9@H could well be from doubleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: S passed 2@c X so likely has 4 @cs and 5 @d|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: 2@H was a gutsy bid that deserved 5@H by N imo|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is why i said need to lead D 8|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|hedyg: @H was never bid in OR|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@H not vuln it was a good choise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with @S by West South could take a chance to make the contract with a end game against East|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: should even up the scores a bit|pg||
nt|othered1: but slightly less likely to sit Dbl with relative @H length.|pg||
nt|petergill: Wirgren and Lawrence's book was the book I had in mind. Something like: LoTT is very good at 2 and 3 levels, OK at 4 level but bad at 5 level, if I recall correctly|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bridge_one: so the counterplay was perfect|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@C and J@d|pg||
nt|tomi2: other table had even some cuebid sequence after their 2/1 bid|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: It is on the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hedy, in open room which overcall by west ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If South had passed at his second turn, I think 4@S would go down|pg||
nt|hedyg: E 2@c, S pass|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: very well !|pg||
nt|varange: :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: surely with K@D Manno would have played @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last time Fulvio missed a defence was Aug 7, 1993|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: spec asks what exactly did the 1 spade bid mean|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H seems clear to me. taking the save is not so clear. EW might have only 8 spades, and 3D did not necessarily show 5-5. S has defense and N has no shortness. also, it is not clear ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at all--to me, anyway--whether the pass over 4S is, or should be, forcing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 1@S Roland not so sure declarer can't read the same the hands - with 6@h with one+ honor few don't bid 2@h over 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|Walddk2: forcing? even thinking about it is an overbid|pg||
nt|irwinbo: when he draws trump, south's hand will count out|pg||
nt|hedyg: are you sure he missed it then?|pg||
nt|tomi2: probably both souths did not know if 3@S shows the weak hand type or some real 2/1 GF with support|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lestergold: apparently equivalent to a negative double but without holding 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: dbl without spades|pg||
nt|varange: you never know your luck in a big city :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the first set Angelini-Versace played with Fantunes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: yes -Simon confirmed 2@S|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|bridge_one: 2@H normally nf - otherwise Dbl and np|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have yet to see Lauria-Versace|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|hedyg: the early @s play killed his entry |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|lml: thats a pretty good way to play it|pg||
nt|varange: the little 2@s on the prev brd brought another 6 imps|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: sry Simon I interpreted your msg as "dbl" @S - i.e. 2...|pg||
nt|lestergold: luck in the club suit but sadly none in the heart suit|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bridge_one: small @s at 3th trick was excellent|pg||
nt|varange: amazing |pg||
pc|c6|nt|varange: Val Magra on the scoreboard now|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|brolucius: The support groups are warming up the stage before the main act comes on.|pg||
nt|henryb: If they play by US rules, we won't: both angelini and Giubilo have to play two sets|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's probably true, but the LoTT can still prevent you from making horrible errors, like on board 21|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: disc @H?|pg||
nt|othered1: east is presuming south has @C9|pg||
nt|daman: this auction is a clear demonstration of why bridge is a partnership game     you elect to include partner in the auction...he gives you his information....and you overrule him     ...|pg||
nt|daman: not the way the games is supposed to be played|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not in a three set match, surely|pg||

nt|hedyg: anybody open the W hand?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 15+|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphztg: yep|pg||

nt|henryb: we would break 48 boards into four sets of 12|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1nt could have 5 card major, as now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't and likely would also pass north's hand, but that is close|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|othered1: Notht he greatest weak NT opening, if that's my style.|pg||
nt|daman: EW are just bidding and defending solidly and NS are imploding|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has the best hand from the three "openers"|pg||
mb|2N|nt|wilkinsona:  I should say that some specs may be confused, after all it was EW that intoduced the artificiality, so why should they complain if it goes wrong?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@D=@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Transfer responses|pg||
nt|bjacobs: On that board, with probably at best an 8-card fit, it would be a huge violation to proceed to the 5-level|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: EW had better keep low on this one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - the xfert over 1@C open work very well|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can be also 11 with 6@C 5any|pg||
nt|hedyg: how do you play when you are down 50 with only 10 boards to go?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: the same as im even|pg||
nt|daman: you keep reaching and you will have trouble winning|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: cause opposite could always make mistakes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Well bid by Fantunes to reach top spot|pg||
nt|hedyg: anybody bid 3@c with the S hand over 1@s?|pg||
nt|irwinbo: not me|pg||
nt|hedyg: i find it very tempting|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|milton_se: 1NT 14-16?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 14 Pearson Points|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  yep 5 diamonds is great|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A heart lead dooms the contract because West must get in with @DQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer does not have enough tricks without diamonds|pg||
nt|varange: probably|pg||
nt|xenya: well now a spade lead looks like a killer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Lauria likes his 10s|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S by Versace is the right call, not Pass, in case anyone wonders|pg||
nt|hedyg: 50 imps of mistakes?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: okok so i am alone :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid 2C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes Hedy, alone :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poor defence in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spade to the ace and another. At least East could have ashed a top heart first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: cashed even|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, even on a spade continuation, where is the 9th trick?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South know the shortness in @D in North|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can caount 2 down with his hand|pg||
nt|othered1: so the third best hand opens 4th seat.|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has 11|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pearson points  what are those?|pg||
nt|hedyg: and 2 10s!|pg||

nt|daman: those 23 IMPs this set could be pushes     thenyou are down 21|pg||

pc|s5|nt|lml: East had a pretty clearcut pass of 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb: even so, why bid Stayman with North's 4-3-3-3 and extra values|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT is a better game, strangely on a 5-4 heart fit.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@d one 5 major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they play Blue Club, they can only have a 5-card major if maximum (15-16)|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho interesting point here is that 9 cold top tricks in 3n and 4H is only about a 50 percenter|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@h ask the major|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2nt...@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: complete duplication|pg||
nt|cuan: no, is thinking if play 4@S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: So which system is it, Simon; did you ask?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer may attempt some sort of elimination play, to avoid the club finesse.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: like a roman club|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  yep elimni on after the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: and if it wasnt on he would have a fat chance of catchinmg Lauria napping|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would need to eliminate diamonds and exit on the third round of spades - not much of a chance.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  but th spade 9 is in play now is it not?|pg||
nt|othered1: 1.5 quick tricks, no aces, opposite a passed hand?  Not close to best|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, 1@S would have the same logic that 1@h 1@s (denie @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 1Nt will be played fron strong site|pg||
nt|hedyg: no system is perfect|pg||
nt|hedyg: and he already knew about @H fit so np|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but to play 1nt from right site help , ovrall in MP competition|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: It is not Roman Club for several reasons. 1NT shows 17-20 in RC, and opening 3-card suits is normal|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he was always playing in a major, either 4@H or 4@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: and always rightsided|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: That would be a huge compliment to Lauria's declarer play|pg||

pc|d5|nt|xenya: not that other let it through though|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 1@S is used like relay gf|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hawe45:  Correct defence|pg||
nt|petergill: NS make 3@H, so going about -200 in 3@S is not so bad at IMPS|pg||
nt|petergill: If you think about it, Lauria could bid 3@H with various hands with three clubs in them, so 3@C in this auction will almost always be a 4+ card suit, but Passing 3@C without prior ...|pg||
nt|petergill: discussion that one is allowed to do so would be a big view to take. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: We can see Lauria has No Chance, but he's wondering how to use his scant entries to dummy|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: now as long as they dont touch the @ds...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: even with a 5-card suit on the side|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@H asking for @D|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: Irrelevant, the hand was lost in the other room|pg||

nt|wilkinsona:  thanks viewgraph|pg||
nt|tomi2: expecting 6@H-2 will be a push is worse then beeing declarer in 6@H imo|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphztg: 4 hearts,1 diamond, 1 club |pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Besides, Roman Club died many years ago|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|milton_se: got in trouble when discarding a H|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|petergill: North having all 3 top @H's is bad news for Lorenzo Lauira, since that tends to play @SKJ and @DA as mostly offside|pg||
mc|9|nt|petergill: He stripped South of club exits|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Neat|pg||
nt|petergill: Nice endplay of South by Lauria|pg||

nt|lml: you can even handle 4-0 onside|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 @H - doÂ´nt ask about my opinion...!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 6 was a lucky push for Angelini when 5@D made in the other room after a spade lead to the jack|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D  18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|varange: lucky in both rooms then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East's hand is the one you get regularly if you visit Mike's rubber bridge club in London|pg||
nt|petergill: How many @S will EW bid?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a pretty good slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: again a two-suiter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only Q@h lead help to make 7|pg||
nt|hedyg: a good 9 counts as 10 too|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@S needs a finesse which on the bidding might well fail|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It might make even with @SK offside?|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, better than a finesse|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wilkinsona:  this time it was the turn of the other team to catch a good OR result|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: don't you prefer dbl with N cards?|pg||
nt|hedyg: DD 6 @d|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@h : @h or a strong balanced hand|pg||
nt|petergill: as long as @H 4-3 for discards|pg||
nt|daman: this will make|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: might bid NT now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a lot to be said for overcalling 2D for the lead, despite the dangers|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: both majors short in @c|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for m y club its got a ten in it i usually get complete yarboroughs|pg||
nt|othered1: movie seems to give them 7 at a point where 1H loser was unavoidable|pg||
nt|hedyg: N felt squeezed?|pg||
nt|milton_se: this is an extremely good 12 -- can East imagine it?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think they will stop at 6|pg||
nt|daman: probably +1|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: I think 2@H is ill-judged|pg||
nt|milton_se: all happy to pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East can't imagine, but west know this :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I have a feeling that the double here will help EW zero in on this hand.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C  asking for majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D at least one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C  I have both|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has nothing more than he promised when he opened 1@C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But entry-problems later on|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So on the diamond lead, you play 3 hearts to pitch the diamonds, ruff a diamond, and try the spade finesse ...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Right|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@h cue denies 1st or 2nd round control in @D|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lml: they can make that slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S give the cue in .. @C (sgl or void)|pg||
nt|hedyg: E can imagine and he has ways to ask|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: on @H lead?|pg||
nt|lml: 6nt has 3 heart 3 spades 2 clubs and 4 diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best contract is 6 NT by East - extremely unlucky|pg||
nt|lml: maybe not|pg||
nt|xenya: but the defence will get 2 tricks earlier|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6nt is only on a squeeze, but N will return a @c to break it|pg||
nt|lml: I was just looking at that|pg||
nt|hedyg: unlikely N leads  @C vs 6NT? S did not double 3 @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: there is a good chance you will be on lead|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@s ask|pg||
nt|yo_yo: kokish  ?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2nt bal |pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have bid differently|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bridge_one: 6 more points in the majors suit in west - easy for east go to slam|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lml: you might do it double dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And the auction has not been favourable for an overcall|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c-2@d-2@h = 4+h unbal  --> 2@s relay - 3@s = 4@h/5+@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty to spec|pg||
nt|othered1: Can west define where his high cards lie and not Kxxx, Kx,  Kxxxxx,  A|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: now?|pg||
nt|lml: it does have to be played by east|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my experience the danger of such overcalls is greatly exaggerated when pd is a passed hand, we are NV, and RHO has not yet spooken|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|wilkinsona:  made in OR by simply playing towards the heart Q|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So spades mentioned for the first time at the 6-level!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 4 diamond minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 5nt choose the major|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, i might be on lead. but there is probably an equal chance that psrtner will be on lead if they bid a game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would rebid my @h over 3@c |pg||
nt|irwinbo: me too|pg||
nt|hedyg: with @s fit?|pg||
nt|hedyg: when do you show fit?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, bec @S fit work the same|pg||
nt|hedyg: you might be searching for a new pd|pg||
nt|bridge_one: find: Irwin :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|petergill: but after 3 @H's, you are in wrong hand to finesse, but still Ok in 6@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You can ruff a diamond fror the entry?|pg||
nt|petergill: a bit worried about 7-1 @D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, in that case, you have an alternative play - a low spade from the West hand.  As long as the @SK is not with the 4th heart, you will be ok|pg||
nt|petergill: cannot afford low spade after three @H's as then the defence might ruff one of your heart winners. |pg||
pc|hA|nt|wilkinsona:  right sided it seem, as a club lead from south...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Is it obvious this makes - or some choices to be made?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't matter with trumps 3-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leading towards @HQ seems best, but even if it loses, there are certain squeeze chances|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lml: if you play the @SA first and see the split West has to split spades when you lead to the queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Whatever the lead - both slams are doome to go down. A 3-years old monkey would find the @C-switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The opponents have not shown a fit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, it's a tight decision, but as we see, everything works|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lml: you can strip him and throw in on @CK|pg||
nt|xenya: well bid|pg||
nt|lml: he will have to lead a spade from the 10xx|pg||
nt|hedyg: after loosing A@H?|pg||
nt|lml: but that is completely hypothetical|pg||
nt|hedyg: no throwins in 12 LOL|pg||
nt|lml: oh sorry silly me|pg||
nt|irwinbo: llook at the bidding in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe @c discard better|pg||
nt|varange: he might have felt the need to show a suit before the bidding got too high, with the pass in West showing a wide range (0-7)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hawe45:  Then North ducks ONE @h-round|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This might bring in 12 tricks, playing the @dÂ´s from hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: he treated this hand as 25 balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: lauria prefer to bid a balanced hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Because he plays them better than most|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c puppet, 3@d 1 or 2 4 card majors|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: lead 4th|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think, that the two black doubletons are bad values - so never 25 for me|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass over 5@c was a better hand than 5 @D |pg||
nt|bjacobs: It will be most interesting to see how Lauria plays irt|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: only @s lead could save them|pg||
nt|cuan: 7@S or 6@S is quite the same|pg||
nt|petergill: Retaining @S2 and (after 3 hearts) playing for 2-2 spades (Ace and another) is much inferior and doesn't work|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: tell Lauria?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lml: this obviously has no play on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six flat boards out of 7 so far. Only the 9-IMP swing when E/W went for 800 in 4@S at the other table.|pg||
nt|lestergold: we are losing kibs at a rate of knots because of the dullness of the deals|pg||
nt|henryb: Would be a boring set at point-a board|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  yep even flattened the 3 club hand after a lively sequence|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Yes Ed, east know impossible to find A K K K - with this point the open was 1@D|pg||
nt|othered1: thanks.  I thought the range extended that high|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2nt = 2@h+ onesuiter or with spades min or max|pg||
nt|petergill: After 3 hearts, ruffing the diamond with @S10 to safeguard against 7-1 @d's looks wrong too |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So it's either cross to hand with a low diamond ruff, or a low spade from dummy|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: I can't see anything better than a low heart now|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: me too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Playing on clubs is an illusion as you need to get rid of two hearts|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  at the other table declarer played the ace first it seems..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: revoke is the only chance:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: trabucchi has to discard|pg||

pc|h4|nt|hedyg: now he wants to claim, but..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt have his mobile-number...? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What did K&R say?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Best but it doesn't help|pg||
nt|xenya: so you would just pass, Roland, awaiting developments? Or you would be content to defend 2@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would certainly pass|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: Ouch|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: lol Ralf|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|sharkey: still works|pg||
nt|petergill: Turbo applies in their cue bid auctions, so bypassing 4NT meant an even number of keycards in East's hand|pg||
nt|petergill: With an odd number, East would bid 4NT over 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: I think West did a lot of cue bids in @H's to show AKQ |pg||
nt|bjacobs: 21 imps riding on this ... playing the @SA is possible (but I think inferior) and is unsuccessful|pg||
nt|petergill: Apparently EW play a sort of Turbo only when clubs are trumps|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he plans to ruff a @D with @S5, then should play @S10 next to discourage a cover|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Agree|pg||
nt|petergill: @SQ would be an error, as you do not want the spade covered|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hawe45:  In pratice, East MUST start with small @S to the Queen. North MIGHT have all 4 trumps.|pg||
nt|lestergold: we need an injection of humour wouldnt be fait to pick on Jockland again|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sigh|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Bad luck Peter, he ruffed with the 6 not the 5 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, @S6 is better than @S5|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bjacobs: Well!|pg||
nt|petergill: General Principle: Declarer should ALWAYS play the higher of equals unless he can see a reason not to, so @S6 is superior to @S5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: the !Q play guards against 4 trumps with N|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Un-doubled anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody can double that|pg||
nt|ralfwil: pl´robably flat|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If South finds the cover, declarer will be on the horns of a very unusual dilemma|pg||
nt|cuan: on king, small|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now he has 3 plays!|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sharkey: But leading @C A first may have ruined squeeze chances if @H K off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have Dano De Falco in spec. He is a much better analyst than me. Maybe he has an alternative (and better) line|pg||
nt|sharkey: N feeling a pinch?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  but may increase enplay chances perhaps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oh, he left|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  could it give declarer a losing line..|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|brolucius: As I have said before, I don't suddenly find a dull hand intriguing just because they will be scoring it at point-a-board. |pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Must cash @CA first|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|petergill: We found a (minor) reason to play @S10 not @SQ, so that was an exception |pg||
nt|cuan: is the same|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: Retaining @S2 is important|pg||

nt|daman: now it's getting tough|pg||
nt|daman: they tried to transfer to 3@H in the OP and got passed out|pg||
nt|daman: OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes misunderstanding|pg||
nt|daman: cruel fate|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: little pause|pg||
nt|daman: halfway|pg||
nt|hedyg: Angelini + 53|pg||
nt|hedyg: running scores are slow, results after 4 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ready...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 8 boards to go and 61 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: go|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: NS have a chance to regain |pg||
nt|bridge_one: give the 2 cards in @h is important !|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: However, 4@S can be defeated on best defence|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  needs a punt|pg||
nt|hedyg: we all have 1 like that|pg||
nt|hedyg: or give him KQ10xx - Kxx AKQxx|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 7@d with all good impasse|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@s weak but good|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: I confess that it's impossible for West to find the heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@s 4 cards, canapé|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hawe45:  Easy to make - difficult to bid = 6 @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: i.e. can have longer minor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why is that hand a problem? we will always reach spades with that hand|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D is acceptable|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing more|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 7 cause i see cards|pg||
nt|petergill: These great Italian EW players are the superstars whom Meckwell and the Americans beat to win the World Championships this year|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H I think|pg||
nt|cuan: "Nightmare system" for Lanzarotti-Manno. 2@S = 9-12 with 6@S |pg||
nt|bjacobs: So that makes the Americans Super Duper stars?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Can 4@S be defeated without @H lead?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 3@H was ok ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: It may be interesting for the declarer and defenders but not for aged BBO commentators.|pg||
nt|othered1: it was within the shapes he had shown.|pg||
nt|blunotte11: Qui ci puo' scappare il pareggio|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is interesting. I think it should make, also single dummy|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphztg: gazzilli sequence|pg||
nt|lestergold: another roalnd slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  that 3 spades looks better than the 1 heart bid found in OR...|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed, Hans|pg||
nt|hedyg: strong @c, weak 1 @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I assume a club lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c any gf?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@S never weak balanced in the system|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: bal or nat gf|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hedyg: ty Gio , i have a pd already :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: north on lead non lub 12 tops better than 12.85 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless 0-1 ctrl, don't know|pg||
nt|hedyg: no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hedy, difficult to say - they change frequently ... |pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think 4@S makes on any lead but a heart|pg||
nt|lml: its not that great a slam, it needs a bit|pg||
nt|hedyg: easy on @D lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2nt positive|pg||
nt|petergill: Re-opening Dbl could be light, so better to go via 2NT|pg||
nt|petergill: to invite I think|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3@c minimum with the other major|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|varange: 3@h anyone?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not me, not even if 2@D is not game-forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@h|pg||
nt|varange: ditto|pg||
nt|lestergold: but of coyurse in reality another dull flat board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer will duck this|pg||
nt|hedyg: might get a @H switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  doubling 4 diamonds was ok as well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even a double dummy low trump is not enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: it makes but surely not easy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem is: 2@S is forcing or not ?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: yes, but it's not a bad slam|pg||
nt|lml: well if you chose to take the heart finesse it is less than 50-50|pg||
nt|lml: the heart finesse by itself is 50|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On a trump lead, itÂ´s rather bad|pg||
nt|bridge_one: OK :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c= nat or any 16+, 2@d = 8+|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, to many doubtful honors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Never mind, he has nothing sensible to play if he wins|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why let the opponents go down, if you can do it yourself|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: @hQ 3rd in front.... and 12 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 2@H= @H + @c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, but also 5/4 and 12 hcp|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s is GF - otherwise 3@s directly over 2@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s would deny 8 hcps, np?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this 4@H means 6+5+ ( i think)|pg||
nt|hedyg: direct|pg||
nt|hedyg: Clair should pass|pg||
nt|hedyg: his hcps in @s and @d not good for his pd|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s over 2@c is inviting - so can have also 10 11bad - means not interest to know the hand of p|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I expect Fantunes to bid 6@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he would quite like a @S switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The problem is how to make it on the natural club lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: might lead @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: i know i would|pg||
nt|cuan: 2NT asks with good hand. 3@C = 4@H minimum, 3@H = limit|pg||
nt|hedyg: helpful lead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Adter you had East's hand on the previous deal, you now swap seats in Mike's club and get North's|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec says 13 tricks on minor suit squeeze|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  close match though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  overtricks may count...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poor partner |pg||
nt|Walddk2: So you always finesse his queen?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer can get rid of a heart loser and ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: you need to get rid of 2 @s losers|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, indeed. Yawn....|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Less than 4 tricks = impossible|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hedyg: cannot ruff on @d lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Losing two spades and one heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Singleton trump leads should be avoided|pg||
nt|varange: my partners never have that queen|pg||
nt|hedyg: i protect my @ds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C it is solide lead ...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: Auction started now|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|miguelgon: now 1 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he gave the defence a second chance|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looking at dummy not many choices left|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: But will Giubilo believe this?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did|pg||
nt|hedyg: but ofcourse Fuvio knows better :)|pg||
nt|daman: surround play of the @D J|pg||
pc|dT|nt|daman: sorta|pg||
pc|dA|nt|varange: @s lead for me too... I know - poor partner|pg||
nt|milton_se: probably, the Ds will set it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: this is the normal and best spot|pg||
nt|brolucius: South will have played the @DK at Trick 1.|pg||
nt|petergill: It means that both the Italians and Americans are great. There was only 2 hands between them in the Final in Sao Paulo.  The same American team easily won the Reisinger last week, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: maintaining the form. |pg||
nt|daman: partner needed an hono(u)r|pg||
nt|hedyg: too late to open the @ss now|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|vugraphztg: no the J|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry|pg||
pc|s6|nt|henryb: 3N was a better contract. Again. 9 top tricks|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It was a clear error not to take the pitch right away|pg||
nt|daman: contract will  make now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: short break?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if break, it is long Hedy :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: short break|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: we are ready now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|varange: @d now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: and @s back|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The last heart squeezes South|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt matter whether it squeezes him|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9@d is good when J10 drop|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he doesnt know that|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  Small @S back will help East more than the Queen. East gets trouble now|pg||
nt|milton_se: not needed|pg||
nt|petergill: This will make 9 tricks, not 10, doesn't it? Or am I wrong?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: why not? does he not have the hand record? poor service|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: poor play here lucks in on the layout|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The point "I want to protect my diamonds" is not valid in my opinion. West is also short in diamonds. Since trumps rate to break 4-1, it is better to go for a tap|pg||
nt|varange: can still make if he drops the q@h|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North can NOT have the @D Ace|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|xenya: sure -- much safer, but no slam bonus|pg||
pc|dK|nt|milton_se: did he really play the 10 of spades?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - after the bidding|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bridge_one: yes :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphztg: y|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A K and J 10 @h make game !|pg||
nt|daman: 5 IMPs to Nardullo     they need larger swings|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sharkey: If E, the owvecaller has @SAQ declarer's play is ok - a @D can be pitched on @C|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: Trabucchi team shut out so far this set - 26-0 at the moment|pg||
nt|othered1: And isn't that really his only play?|pg||
nt|varange: awww|pg||

nt|sharkey: *Losing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No-one expects Pescara to win this match. You don't get many opportunities against these guys, so when you get one, like here, you simply must take advantage to stand any chance|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry, you are right |pg||
nt|hedyg: i thnk Totaro smokes a pipe, that can take a while|pg||

nt|milton_se: also trumps 3-2, pitching Hs on Ds|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm talking about the position he was in after playing @S to K|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after A K in @S know @S are 4/1 ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nunes will open 1@C, then let's see if Lanzarotti can bid clubs naturally|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Coffee-620/650 here|pg||
nt|hedyg: finally on the board|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  yes, and I fancy a x of 4 diamonds really|pg||
nt|sharkey: But taking the initial @H pitch on @C cud hardly lose at all|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here declarer has to create one red trick extra - to make 4 @S|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: last board|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: Angelini + 73|pg||
nt|daman: this hand will not generate a swing for either side|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphztg: score is ok now|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 8 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: this may end up in a pityful 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: some play X= 5-7 here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: west in the OR  bid only 1@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@D much more difficult here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good idea. Passing to show 0-7 is too wide a range |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: now my k@d is a bad value|pg||
nt|hedyg: mine too :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even for E/W|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We have seen it before, 5@D is actually the best game|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 1 entry to hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That was first hurdle - better let South be declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Trabucchi bids again, they will get doubled in anything|pg||
nt|milton_se: but probably not after that doubtful 3S bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a proper sloam here all on a 2/2 break basically|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@c drury|pg||
nt|mdgraham: courageous pass by South.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: good choice|pg||

mb|2D|nt|vugraphztg: 3@s support|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm west didnt even give it a thought|pg||
nt|henryb: so a bad slam, Mike. 40%|pg||
nt|brolucius: Great fit for E/W. but a slam still needs a 2-2 trump break.|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but it should have been explored at least|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  another slam hand, what more do you want|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H= more @s|pg||

nt|milton_se: 5 or 6 imps?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Henry Bethe|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: How do you fancy a spade to the ace and @C9 return in 3NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: hand is limited to 16 since no 1 @c opening|pg||
nt|xenya: good prediction, Roland|pg||
nt|milton_se: he let them off the hook, but they were eager to take it anyway|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sticks or circles :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 800|pg||
nt|henryb: GM all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: as the cards lie, not possible to make 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, 1100 if he covers|pg||
nt|xenya: though why N should convert is not quite clear|pg||
nt|yo_yo: looks like NS will get some imps at last|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Double dummy, I know, but 3NT can go down, 5@D can't|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT= no 6 cards @H. no 2nd suit|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|milton_se: 7|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@S wow!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bridge_one: 4@S no DBL ! :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: more dinner offers..|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  With North as declarer, a lousy @D-lead kills the contract -|pg||
nt|hedyg: E must switch to @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @cA and a @d switch...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s is too passive|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Just guess the @H-suit, and you write 620|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now S has time to set up @h  after a correct guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no fantasy with that @s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot doublefinesse in @H, needs 2 entries for that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I normally say: If onlÃ¦y at least one of the opponentÂ´s hands is wide open (dummy) you should try to kill the contract|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think they can beat 4@S even with a bad guess because East will only get in once|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That East did NOT play @H, might signal having the King|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: prior to the 4 @S bid, what had east shown/denied in strength?|pg||
nt|varange: cheap round|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like " we are either too high or too low in 3 @s"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C lavinthal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if Lanzarotti cashes his other ace ...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: if he switches to @D after A@c it is down|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|varange: no such luck|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: at any rate as cards lie its 100% so it m,ay be a swing|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  thats at least 4/5 slam hands now|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - not right - declarer ducks the 10 - and guesses the @H|pg||
nt|brolucius: West would need a special trump asking bid, to ask North how many trumps he held.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did he not have 9 top tricks with @DKx on?|pg||
nt|hedyg: off the Schneider|pg||
nt|mdgraham: six boards left....|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bridge_one: Lanzarotti can read doubleton in @H in South |pg||
pc|d9|nt|ralfwil: but as a kib notices S can duck a small @d|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it CAN be down|pg||
nt|xenya: double finesse in @H would be a normal play, but here declarer has only one entry to hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: but E can play J@D :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: shall i cash the 10 @c or not?|pg||

nt|brolucius: You are speaking in Gaelic after drinking all that malt whisky.|pg||
nt|othered1: Do NS in OR normally lead A from !K?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because he does not have the hand record|pg||
nt|othered1: A from AK?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They might have done - and then not found the @S-switch. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: another hand in 5M in OR.  But they were focused on @D, so a good stop|pg||

nt|bridge_one: Tuscany - north of tuscany|pg||
nt|othered1: Interesting 5-level decision opposite a weak NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no pollution - never !|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: maybe dbl should show a good balanced hand and 3@C and 3@D show majors with clubs showing better hearts|pg||
nt|henryb: as I said; perfect vision|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Forza Italia|pg||
nt|lml: etc|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I had choosen 5@h. there must be majors on E|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then after some time when Angelini was on lead with @SA he played another club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strange|pg||
nt|othered1: Save will mke it a little closer or, maybe, a lot closer if they go to 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did declarer not ruff a club he might have asked himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: never thought declarer would ruff a @c loser?|pg||
nt|milton_se: nice win if 6H now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: even 4@H without @D ruffs looks like a lot of work|pg||
nt|lml: anyway West would not be shut out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This lead you must ruff with the @H Ace!!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: or the 8 :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To show who is the king|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and I had also stretched to 6@c. at least as a save|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think anybody would be impressed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lml: 6@C must have been a consideration by south and it is right on the hand of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=14026  Andrea Manno|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@c on a @H lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bridge_one: 4@s was ON - so 4@h less one is a good result for N/S|pg||
nt|hedyg: -1? how?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H is carrying a reasonable principle too far. 11 loser hands should shut up unless prodded vehemently|pg||
nt|hedyg: by E ofc|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: i see -3 except for a miracle|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2down|pg||
nt|varange: wow|pg||
nt|petergill: Should be 110 or perhaps even 140|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: will play for long @ss in S playing A@s first|pg||
nt|lml: but then again you don't know they are making 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, 6@H won the board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it's only a matter of by how much|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass by Fantoni i think 0 or 2+defensive tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl would be one defensive trick|pg||
nt|varange: Manno's 4H bid - very nice|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but i amn't sure in this sequence ...|pg||
nt|othered1: Not over yet.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is over because North is on lead against spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol Fabio|pg||
nt|othered1: Pushing *these* guys around isn't easy.|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs to lead @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, Lanzarotti is a seasoned customer|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: can ruff out @C 10 but short of entries...|pg||
nt|othered1: Lauria, of course, makes winning decision, only 4  imps away|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: Easier to play than to bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT must have been a raise in @c|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they dont play...just claim...1 trick in each suit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: seems inefficient to give the opponents and easy 3@C cue-bid|pg||
nt|milton_se: Nunes can't know the value of the Cs|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: if no @H lead only -1|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2down with @H lead|pg||
pc|hT|nt|wilkinsona:  a transfer put the singleton diamond on lead in the other room|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|vugraphztg: j @c?|pg||
nt|brolucius: The trouble with diet drinks is the disgusting artificial sweetener that they use. Why can't they just make some drinks which aren't sweet at all?|pg||

nt|varange: yes, think so|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 1 down|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but probably Linda. No @c tricks in the defence|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|henryb: 110 after the lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Club lead was too hard to find, and @C switch not easy to find|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: there was an American player who seemd to always play 5 of a major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Give the young man in the South seat a lot of credit for this big result|pg||
nt|varange: -2 leading the SINGLETON heart, Hedy?|pg||
nt|othered1: Neatly played the strain with no ruffs out|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wilkinsona:  looks like the same 9 tricks..|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: not a great slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 6 should be possible|pg||

mb|1S|nt|xenya: me too|pg||

nt|bridge_one: agree - very little chace to make|pg||
nt|henryb: David only gets interested when the contract is doubled or at least a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: How can slam ever be worse than a finesse?|pg||
nt|milton_se: "if pard has no major singelton 5D may be ebough"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poor judgement|pg||
nt|hedyg: all bid with the E hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1@d nat or 18-20  bal|pg||

mb|2H|nt|hawe45:  A BIG 2 @H for my taste|pg||
nt|milton_se: no price for bravery, indeed|pg||
nt|varange: I wonder what Versace may be thinking now|pg||
nt|brolucius: What an exaggeration...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D instead dbl (with 4/3 in majors) because it is important to give the lead|pg||
nt|daman: in North America we have a saying...."It's not over until the fat lady sings...."|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: North in the other room can't open 1NT as they play 12-14|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Roland - explains that :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I wouldn't open 1NT even if I could|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: not played|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: but I think many would...|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  Im with you there Roland|pg||
nt|sharkey: S shud be getting ambitious after pd's reverse|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||

nt|henryb: not much, I think. At least the Abbott seems to play only games and slams|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: with E cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: me too|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: but i could be 18-20|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: looks like 2@hs and @s finesse|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sharkey: they'll bid slam now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  4 diamonds a good bid there it seems|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No 620|pg||
nt|lml: still worth pushing them up one|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@d = balanced strong or weak in one major|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: you need not only Q@D on side but @ds 3 3 and @c split|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - OR small @D now|pg||
nt|milton_se: pretty easy trump lead :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Trump-lead and we shalll see|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: is the abott based on roland?|pg||
nt|othered1: Better get @H into the action in time and maybe north can find the @HJ play|pg||
nt|hedyg: so you play 1@d..|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: 4@H from N music to South's ears...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  ...so 7 clubs it is...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not a great slam, true, but in the immortal words of Jerry Clerkin: "I've seen sicker dogs get well"|pg||
nt|petergill: 11 hands in a row declared by EW|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Iff oponents play @H, all depends on the @S-handling|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table - @D switch - spade to king, spade to ten and jack, claim soon after|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But one can hardly go wromg|pg||
nt|petergill: Run @S8, or spade to nine is the only losing option I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-loosers woÂ´nt disappear, @H-shift|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphztg: heheeh|pg||
nt|daman: NS were robbed on this hand|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@C makes for a handsome payoff|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  maybe a play for 10 now..|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, a review of the latest Abbot book, in English Bridge, mentioned that 60% of the deals were slams. |pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: finesse that spade|pg||
nt|henryb: tote that barge?|pg||
nt|lestergold: will the great man get this right?|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok so 3 @hs|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: Perhaps Lanzarotti was wondering about the passed hand jumping to 4@H, and thinking about partner having @SAK if declarer is 47 in majors|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sharkey: In OR Fantoni-Nunes weren't close to bidding slam|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  thinking about it...|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|othered1: not a great hand for odd-even first discards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @C4 is OK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
nt|petergill: North is a passed hand so|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: oh....|pg||
nt|henryb: he would, but he is dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only the @S-plan works|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: @SA is marked in South|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphztg: wrong minor|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  snatching defeat it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D can also make|pg||
nt|sharkey: he'll not finesse in @D...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c would ask for @H|pg||
nt|othered1: found it|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What's the problem? 13 easu tricks :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After the bidding - and the lead - South MUST have @S Ace|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: it is better than that i think. you don;t necessarily need 33 daimonds do you?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: easy even|pg||
nt|petergill: North has @CAK and !QJ = no @SA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can this be happening?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Such disrespect for the spot cards?|pg||
nt|petergill: Does dummy have @S4 or @S8 left? |pg||
nt|petergill: Simon?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Alternatively, does declarer still have @S3?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|wilkinsona:  as you say Roland, no probs|pg||
nt|othered1: That changes things radically, so declarer now can just go about setting up @S for extra tricks|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: for EO 1@d could be 18-20, so i cant pass with E cards|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes i play 1@d:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: why? you dont have game opposite 18-20|pg||
nt|hedyg: but maybe they cannot pass|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: I suspect that 5@D was trump queen ask (clubs)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||

nt|varange: ah. Angelini lead|pg||
nt|varange: 30/27|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: assume Multi...|pg||

mb|2S|nt|hedyg: strong @c opening|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@s 8-10|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: and a @D lead...?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  this multi includes a strong club hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: 1@S is heart positive|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s= @H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I cannot see any other hame than 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H is more @hs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: gazzilli|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another opportunity|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Played from the other side, might this have a different outcome?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT will easily make - without a @D-lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni could have made it, but he did not know that a diamond duck was right at trick 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: sad really|pg||
nt|vincenzo: from the right side ..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that looks a bit thin for a strong club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DJ lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Trying to explain the previous board: Perhaps Lauria left the table as dummy and Versace reached over and pulled out the worng spade from dummy? Something like that did happen once ...|pg||
nt|petergill: before to this partnership|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: still my keyboard GAME!|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: everybody at the table except S "knew" what minor E held:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: fun to see North cards - he think East witt long @C :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: This should be good.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But OK - you must lead the @D 9 to keep South to 600|pg||
nt|hedyg: they seem to play 15+|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but each pair paly different gadgets ... |pg||
nt|hawe45:  West seem to have a natural @C-lead|pg||
nt|henryb: One of the good reasons not to play J denies.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Indeed Peter, and it cost them a trick.  One of the most costly tricks in history|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Monte Carlo Bermuda Bowl Final Italy vs USA?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2NT??|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 even 8 now|pg||
nt|henryb: BORING. Seven tricks with the spade position|pg||
nt|henryb: eight even|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: The previous hands may have influenced the bidding - boards 9 & 12|pg||
nt|xenya: doesn't 1@S shown number of controls?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1nt shows 4 controls|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c stayman|pg||
nt|hedyg: or more likely puppet|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so 10 tricks without J@D or 9@D lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: so double was takeout|pg||
nt|ritong: even with it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: which is unlikely|pg||
nt|othered1: or with it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D J = 630 |pg||
nt|hedyg: he just plays small and suit blocks?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C means 1) natural 11/16 @h @c or any 16+|pg||
nt|petergill: Win @CQ or play low?|pg||
nt|petergill: low, then spade to king, then heart to queen?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Queen might keep the entries going to the long spade?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I do think he will start on the hearts, finessing West for the jack|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Queen helps West to find the @D-switch|pg||
nt|petergill: Is there some deceptive way to play clubs, to minimize the chance of the unwanted @D switch?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh I see - so nine, covered with 10, etc?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East shall NOT cover an eventual @C 9!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What should that help?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria hasn't missed a lead since 1969  .... so 40 years on we are lucky enough to see it|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe, we dont have their CC|pg||
nt|lml: I don't think so.  |pg||
nt|varange: what was that all about?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No comment|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3@h max|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@c checkback|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2nt : 3@h and max|pg||
nt|lestergold: back to 7 if switches|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: so Cameo thought it was a good idea to play in notrump when partner has three hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: should be 3 ctrols|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But who cares after that lead|pg||
nt|othered1: someone noticed :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think it makes little difference, if declarer plays West for @HJ, as he surely will|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: N was sure he had @Cs|pg||
nt|hedyg: so both N and S didnt know|pg||
nt|bridge_one: takeout, but i think with 2+@S - can play 2@S Dbled|pg||
nt|lestergold: but indeed who would?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@h means  <7 . sgl @s 4+@h|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona:  cant recall the occasion in 1969, perhaps you can remind us....|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: 3@C, 1@D, 3@S, 2@H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: They would not have played in NT if Versace had doubled 2@C, but I bet that Angelini did not lead one because there was no double|pg||
nt|milton_se: y +4 by force|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not really, I was only 6 then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I read about it|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets try the Q@H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  No @s 9-unblock in first @S-round|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bridge_one: i wrote @h/@C - was a distarction - @S/@C - 1Maj 1nt 2@c = Gazzilli = 5M4+@C 11/16 or 5+M any 17+|pg||
nt|hedyg: unlucky|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  claim, pls|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 or 0 tricks to the defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 2 exciting boards this match has become very quiet|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|bjacobs: Actually, the long spade is the easy 9th trick now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lml: 2 back  the 5@H hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry commentators curse :(|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K in @c and !k better|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|henryb: I think Lauria needed to win the @d and clear the suit|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Is the match over?|pg||
nt|lml: interesting auction.  South opened 3@C with 4-6 in the blacks and North bid 5@C.  |pg||
nt|hedyg: claiming 10?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i think s forgot the number of trumps played|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|lml: East doubled with his 5-4-4-0 but it was passed out and it was cold|pg||

nt|othered1: Why was 3N down in OR?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  hopeless|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Papi love onle Woman Gazzilli :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hawe45:  If you play small @C to the Queen|pg||
nt|petergill: Only 8 imps in it now. 18 boards to go in this 48 board semi-final, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: 2@s : txs for 2nt or many distributions|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: A chance for EW to increase their lead slightly?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Can be a IMP to gain for Serbia here. Even more if 6 is bidded and @D hitted. Exspext a flat board|pg||
nt|brolucius: Another splendid fit, this time for N/S.|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm 6S is a possible slam to bid with fair chances on a normal spade break|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6C??|pg||
nt|othered1: OH, did north find the @CQ play towards dummy?  that will hurt 2N on @S lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would think so - it seems a LONG way to 4@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh I wish I hadn't typed that!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easy lead after RD|pg||
nt|petergill: An advance sacrifice over the failing 4@H?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I quite like the convention where this redouble shows specifically honour-doubleton|pg||
nt|petergill: North needs to pass 4@S. |pg||
pc|cT|nt|wilkinsona:  slam time?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so one major or other type of strong hand, i think |pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: so 4@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@S better because you can sometimes discard a club on the 13th diamond.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|varange: they don't seem to use the 2@d as a game force checkback|pg||
nt|milton_se: over-aggressive|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like it Tony|pg||
nt|hedyg: no only 1 major over 1NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: depending on agreements - i prefere to play multi with only one major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All of a sudden Nunes can "see" the singleton heart in partner's hand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: Henry your good at percentages what would u say here|pg||
nt|henryb: Trabucchi now ahead three boards to one|pg||
nt|lestergold: dims 3/3u dont have to ind the club q and two way search is better than 50% normally because of the info that gets picked up |pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, 4@S would have made, I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: @D ruffs could make this costly|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hawe45:  Strange to le the weak hand play!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  let|pg||
nt|henryb: 6@s is about 66%|pg||
pc|c3|nt|wilkinsona:  thought it was just a mater of 6 or 7|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 4@c : 5@h and 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: at least|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  thanks, Simon|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: after 2@s bid|pg||
nt|lml: not crazy about that bidding structure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On a @S-lead, "itÂ´s NOW"|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3@s : txs for 3nt|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: so 6S is probably better than 50% slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: after @s lead playing A@C is tuff, if KJx in E no more entry to hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my J from Jxx not a success|pg||
nt|ritong: he has no entry to hand no matter what,after @c A|pg||
nt|ritong: so the best is @c to the 9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does the encyclopedia say|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks best, and pray|pg||
nt|hedyg: must keep communications open|pg||
nt|othered1: Encyclopedia doesn't have entry problems|pg||
nt|ritong: a kind of table presence problem imo|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think, this is a guess. @CV 2-2 works - and then only single @C K also|pg||
nt|hedyg: encyclopedia says play 5@c......|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: @c from dummy?|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|varange: so we have now identified two bridge players who actually have a life: Sabine and Papi :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S can make 4@h, but E/W make 4@S !|pg||
nt|othered1: That was ineffective|pg||
nt|henryb: Well now, I think N-S can barely make 3@h|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps Versace cannot risk playing @D's until after clubs? |pg||
pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: Will make if S ruffs 2@d on the table before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: might require careful handling|pg||
nt|othered1: In OR, west doubled 1@H opening, and did have support for other suits|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4H down on a S lead|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ritong: @c to the Q wins stiff J|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: The South hand does not have many entries. He may well play a club to the queen|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Somewhat lucky that Lauria does not have anything wasted in diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree with that double|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: is it clear to lead a heart? what about a club at trick 2?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West would try to give a constructive raise at 2@s - pass not the best|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: shud W cue 5@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: domani si riprende con il 2° tempo di semifinale alle 10.30|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: now the @d finess|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both suits (@S and @D) are placed in favor of declarer - who kan even afford to loose a @D-trick|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Ralf, that seems the best  plan|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps the only winning one|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Still 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: That's not safe|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW feeling confortable ahead probably see no reson to gamble here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  maybe north told him about the diamond situation|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe just the 2-bid's preemption working|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|henryb: even better because you might not get a heart lead!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: Lost some tempo now so max 11. Can become 10 and gain for Romania|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and will utter a silent curse|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe not so silent|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: why not @h to dummy and @c?|pg||
nt|othered1: against lesser opponents, @C guess might be easier to make|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ritong: with this layout, the good move was cross to dummy with a @h, pplay a @c and duck the @c K|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: A 9-6 scoreline after 13 boards is not exactly a swingy set.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|irwinbo: club would work|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well i wasnt asking about what works, but what is right|pg||
nt|bridge_one: great Roland ! perfect italian !|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|rodal f: Back at 11|pg||
nt|ralfwil: trumps is best from W, but doesn´t help|pg||
nt|hawe45:  13th @C now - East discarding a @D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: me? no|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzzw: thank you for watching. Goodbye!!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: we dont know what open room result is but given how good a slam this is it could be bid in open|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|ritong: but it still loses against stiff jack|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Agree with rit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No comments|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps a slight misunderstanding over the redouble?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: yep no heart lead adding more equity|pg||
nt|bridge_one: "domani si riprende con il 2° tempo di semifinale alle 10.30" is good Roland :)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: attacking hearts too soon means a spade ruff (almost inevitable) will lock you out of dummy|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|brolucius: They would need to identify the great fit, which is not easy.|pg||
nt|hedyg: considerate play of A@d :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  brilliant defence to beat 1NT was not enough to win that board...3D was -2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yo_yo: 405 and 406   play Ace and low to Q   78%   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: you have to duck any club honour from East. Might be from KJx|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: much needed swing to Lucchesi|pg||

nt|hedyg: ty :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i put the result|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes ty |pg||
nt|Walddk2: And the lead back to Trabucchi after board 12. 4@D  6@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: now a possible granny|pg||
nt|lestergold: not of  course a good one|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but agree entries difficult|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Otherwise you may have no entry|pg||
nt|othered1: beating 4@S is non-trivial here, too.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I might make 9Â½ tricks in 4 @S|pg||
nt|othered1: ne3eded @C ruff to take trumps separately|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: well it was a normal distribution|pg||
nt|petergill: Unerring by West, as he can tell from Lauria's second Dbl that partner was likely to have @DA or @HA|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: and a handsome lead it is|pg||
nt|ritong: nice hands for the finish, anyway|pg||
mb|3D|an|10-11 3!h support|nt|yo_yo: looks like 4@S should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: not more that 5@D for N/S|pg||
nt|othered1: not on @CA and another |pg||
nt|hawe45:  With the @C-ruff you defeat it|pg||
nt|hedyg: S thinking slam|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hawe45:  But 140 will bring them close|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and that's what was led  A@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: if they get there|pg||
nt|varange: but we can rely on Fantunes to find at least one slam in the next two boards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thumbs down on the 1n opening :(|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hedyg: no 5 level|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec says Roland grabnd slam i say too good for roland grand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now 4@C usually played as a splinter, so East must look elsewhere.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  nice when partner opens and you have 4 Aces|pg||
nt|lestergold: however back in the land of reality this should be a flat 6H plus one in both rooms|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: and 4 card support|pg||
nt|ritong: pass by north is not super brave|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd bid 2@S on south hand, but I don't know how fisky north can be at these colors|pg||
nt|petergill: are NS playing the Nightmare System?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: He did - Lauria cud still have A or K |pg||
nt|ralfwil: even 4@h is too expensive - 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  800 - even shortly before Christmas|pg||
nt|marlowepi: substandard hearts and substandard spades for a 3H fit-jump, from a purist's perspective|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW not quite as active in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: Clair knows N is short in @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as most play, 2C in competition is not a GF, so then it would not be clear that this pass is forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: Franchi should have 4 @ss for his 3@H bid|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS may be shut out now...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Nt by North difficult to make 3Nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10.14 NT|pg||
mb|4D|nt|hawe45:  - if Souths bids on|pg||
nt|xenya: EW haven't discovered their true potential|pg||
nt|ralfwil: besides - I haven´t had a bid on N|pg||
nt|varange: I like the 1NT opening|pg||
nt|brolucius: Could just bid 6@H. I once had a partner who HATED leaps to the six-level. That made me do it even more often. |pg||
nt|henryb: another hand for fourth best!|pg||
nt|hedyg: now told him what to lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: the previous pass hoping in DBL in North and trasform give a problem to bid now|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot give up on the vulnerable game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: south pass ... could try a open 1Nt - 12 hcp|pg||
nt|henryb: or at least long suit|pg||
nt|petergill: Lanzaroti and Buratti were a top pair playing Nightmare System who got banned for a couple of years for wrong-doing, and now that they have returned I think they are not allowed to ...|pg||
nt|petergill: partner each other, but I'm not sure. |pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@D with xxx in clubs?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|varange: semi balanced: 7222, 6322 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The second double even more interesting|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most partnerships play that you are obliged to cue-bid the @DA on the West cards, even if you are minimum. With a second-round control you can sign off with a poor hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: I have a feeling that laria will have to steamroller this one to slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: For a flat board.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  this is probably enough negativity from west to avoid the making grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: oh!|pg||
nt|hedyg: so new leader again..|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is expensive|pg||
nt|xenya: for an instant i thought EW got them...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Angelini + 90 after 13 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  does this have a chance, ...seems it might..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure you can go down when you are in 3|pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps that was tough the way the bidding went|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Vlad, W was not able to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can support later if partner will act|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would not be content with defending 2@S when opps are vulnerable?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, no grand, so East's 4@S suggests that he is not yet willing to bid even 6@H. |pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: finance crisis syndrome: not content with anything|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it could obviously go very wrong, but surely North had to double 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: better pass , so your p could bid rdbl|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ritong: of course, doubling 3@d can generate a disaster, on the other hand north can envisage a @c SLAM, so he must bid imho|pg||
nt|petergill: You can scroll down to Nightmare at http://www.bridgeguys.com/NGlossary/GlossN.html if you are a system fanatic|pg||
nt|tomi2: beeing told that 4@D shows problems in @C in their methods|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rocco47: 12 per Failla|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they play 2@c good hand - so 4@d is dangerous - better 3Nt or Dbl ?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|varange: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: Lauria will surely go now even if west 'signs off'|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: W has to give the k@s|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: now 5@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is a bit much on those moderate trumps. The @SK might be enough for West to bid 6@H, though.|pg||
nt|hedyg: why was a @H led in OR?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sharkey: We've said that before...|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|hedyg: claim|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: Even if he inserts the 10, which could have been right|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: of course fine bidding by Lauria goes without saying|pg||

nt|petergill: EW are overboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: 5@h is two down, Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: red Ks do not have to be favourably placed|pg||
nt|hedyg: as well as to the FOGB with Gianluca Frola and to Vincenzo delle Cave|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ralfwil: 2@s will show a good - at least 5-card - @s and a good hand|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm afraid that might not be too easy though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is right-sided|pg||
nt|yo_yo: looks as if this makes  |pg||
nt|hedyg: and of course thanks to Ed :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They are not the only ones|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lots of vugraph this weekend. Broadcasts from Scotland (Gold Cup finals) and Spain in progress, and in 30 minutes we are getting another one: Sweden|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry FIGB|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 45 minutes|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty all for joining, we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: just 2@D losers|pg||
pc|sT|nt|varange: fantoni pushing hard in the bidding on brd 14|pg||
nt|xenya: nothing, really, 6@C is OK|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|petergill: The Law of Total Tricks often breaks down at the four and five levels - 11 + 9 trumps but 9 + 10 total tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Which two diamond losers if I may ask|pg||
nt|milton_se: nothing wrong at all, but South can't see it|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3@s with N cards|pg||
nt|varange: but Nunes makes the slam-killer 3NT bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: You cannot finesse them both.|pg||
nt|po-s: has to take 11|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1nt are @s|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: that's that|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: played the other way up in OR on @S lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no  same way played|pg||
pc|h8|nt|varange: the ace and the queen |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: The thing is that this may be huge a swing for Trabucchi because Fantoni will open 1@C in the other room|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharkey: thanks everyone - interesting match|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i suppose netryprobs Henry|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: Our appreciation to the FIGB for ensuring that this event is brought to BBO vugraph. Gianluca Frola, and on behalf of BBO, Vincenzo Delle Cave, have been instrumental in setting up ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: a fine show|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next set after a short break, 10-15 minutes is my estimate|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yeah|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  by the way Roland, spec metions a win for Denmark over Scotland today....|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: everyone has finished|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree with that bidding. Either 3@s from N or 3@d from S after 2nt|pg||
nt|brolucius: No reason to finesse in hearts anyway.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Must be curling|pg||
nt|varange: ah. I see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and *then* they must avoid slam|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|hedyg: made now|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty all, bye for now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that overcall got what it deserved|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphztg: also fantoni|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think one should be too harsh on NS -- after all, they have only 7 spades, but stoppers in all suits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: bye all|pg||
nt|ritong: you prefer double?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: thanks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very busy vugraph weekend ahead of us|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Italy, Spain, Scotland and Sweden. All great events|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|wilkinsona:  seems so...|pg||
nt|lestergold: restricted choice etc|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: well played|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's where we came in!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all|pg||
nt|petergill: bidding Five over Five fails once again|pg||
nt|petergill: although the vulnerability made it fairly attractive|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, one can be a BIT sympathetic on this deal|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Credit Versace for having taken a bid over 4@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: thereby stimulating the auction|pg||
nt|petergill: good point Bill|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Cheers|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphztg: byee|pg||
nt|varange: thanks all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thx all and bye for now|pg||
nt|varange: bye simon|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: But we lost to Sweden in women's handball, that's bad|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this 1Nt is strange (normally 4@H + 5+ in a minor) - they probably use to give a open strong without other major|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|daman: I have to leave   ciao  everyone|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|othered1: Thanks everyone and bye!|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|hedyg: ty all, bye for now|pg||
nt|xenya: would be in interesting to see the result in OR on that hand|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
