nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: buonasera|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Systems Simon?|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is the tightest match of the round of 16|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't believe that Clair passed|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: wrong board|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe they are not playing this board at all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: wait a moment|pg||
nt|hedyg: Carlo would not open 1NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1NT not exactly textbook either|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like they turned the board|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe "tightest match" meant...|pg||
nt|hedyg: closest score Marshall|pg||
nt|hedyg: might a free translation from French|pg||
nt|Walddk2: wronf file it seems. open room operator shut down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "tight" is american slang for "tipsy"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Simon will do too|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: wrong file system|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: we quit and then come back|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2 minutes|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But it's awkward to bid 5@C now since partner will think opener has more hearts|pg||
nt|henryb: Have Fantunes changed system? The last time I watched them they played forcing one bids and 10-13 two bids|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No change there|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they're in the open room:)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: E-W play Angelini's version of Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  canape sequence from north it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1any has always been forcing, 14+   and 2any  10-14|pg||
nt|henryb: Ah, but we do not have Fantunes|pg||
nt|brolucius: South can discount a slam since they play a strong 1@C system.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: @d lead?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well as cards lie 6 of a red looks pretty good|pg||
nt|lestergold: not suggesting it should be bid!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Notice the canapé style of N-S. So Blue Club it is, Simon?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|milton_se: not a double?|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N looks fairly cold also|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N+2 looks likely at both tables|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: after this board, i'll ask them|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wilkinsona:  this might go ddown..|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like off 4?|pg||
nt|varange: do you know much about NS Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S with four cards is somewhat dangerous when you know that partner has close to nothing|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, I don't know them|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: At least|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 1@H showed @s|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing a standard system, South would have to bid 2@D (fourth suit) at his second turn, in case North was strong and a slam was a good bet.|pg||
nt|bardo: 3 sa anche in aperta|pg||
nt|henryb: Playing a standard system North would open 1@c, S 1@d, N 1@H, S 1@s, N 2@d|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|milton_se: y, especially when Cs may be an option|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: 1NT was a stronger  NT than 15/17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I could think of a few puns with South's name involved :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course at tis stage declarer cannot be sure of hs contract]|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: More if declarer isn't careful|pg||
nt|brolucius: If the @S2 was indeed led from a 4-card suit (which is a good bet if 4th-best leads are in operation), declarer would know that the contract was safe. He could lose no more than ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: three spades and the @CK. By playing the @SJ, he breaks communications when West has five spades. |pg||
pc|s6|nt|varange: :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no 15-17|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice 10@s in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  There is a danger in the @C-suit, if North tries some safety-play - and East plays the Jack. Might give North bad plans.|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Simon, i thought you said they play strong NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: hi|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wilkinsona:  ok,....ddddown|pg||
nt|sharkey: Lauria knows pd is void in @S as wud have played Q from QJ|pg||
nt|varange: no limericks please!|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|hedyg: and he did have 19 hcps|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yeah, cause usually who plays strong @c play weak nt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seems very logical|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  lucky we can see all the hands and know that every card is right|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: East still has a spade, so the suit will be 4-4 (unless West found an unlikely lead from a 3-card suit into a bid suit).|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: this club suit aint coming in|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|varange: no easy exit available, is there?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, S is sort of endplayed|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|lestergold: west about to have his 2h promoted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria knows the whole hand now and will pitch a diamond|pg||
nt|sharkey: In OR E overcalled 1@S thus N not subjected to the pressure bid 4@S - so no sacrifice|pg||
pc|c6|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: Those who missed the first set did not miss anything. The bridge was pretty awful (if you are wllowed to use pretty and awful in the same sentence)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wrong again|pg||
nt|milton_se: trying to beat it costs an overtrick|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|milton_se: but it is for free|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|sharkey: off 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but a diamond pitch would had led to 800|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, the @CK was onside.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c3|pc|hK|nt|xenya: S will get one more trick, but that's all|pg||

nt|hedyg: right, 2suiter|pg||
nt|daman: mea maxima culpa|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: you started off something here Roland|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: 3N should go off on careful defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: but might it now before pd leads a @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: nope|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1nt possible, 2Nt long to make - so 2@s open would work here|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: uwelcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 14 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|varange: amaazing layout|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: nko reason for the stiff KC to be found|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To me Easts hand more looks like a @C-@d reverse hand - no intermediates for NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: did u mean to say that the bridge wa pretty awesome?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: and the lead would be @S, not @c|pg||
nt|milton_se: oops|pg||
nt|varange: ouch|pg||
nt|brolucius: West is (much) too good to bid 4@S, so he marks time with the fourth suit. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: West's hand is suited for a strong jump shift at his first turn, but no-one plays those any more I guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 2@S and then 4@S, to show a great suit but not many controls.|pg||
nt|daman: very oxymoronic|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: seems 2@H was forcing..|pg||
nt|xenya: a wheel came off?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  unless its led|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  even when I do play em I can't get my partners to use them|pg||
nt|lestergold: this must mean please make a cue bid pard|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: We often see the weak jump shift mis-used on BBO VuGraph, so perhaps better to play strong jump shifts, even if you never use them.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|varange: two|pg||
nt|milton_se: nice to agree on what´s forcing :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Assuming a @S lead dont think you need @C finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: here declafrer can afford the safety play|pg||
nt|hedyg: not really enough for reverse|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure - but minimum!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The @H-suit brings this 3 NT safely home|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a @s lead...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Whatever lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: guess @h help the declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: now he needs to ask for another one!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: lauria is a good soldier:)|pg||
nt|henryb: Its not that uncommon to play strong JS at the two level in a 2/1 structure|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S is forcing because it was preceded by the fourth-suit bid.|pg||
nt|lestergold: but Lauria with massive controls will soon get the message] |pg||
nt|brolucius: West might 'invent' 4@D, to see if East has a heart control.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i agree|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: it's the winning bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: not actually easy to bid this hand|pg||
nt|henryb: look how easy this hand is after 1@d-2@s: East splinters with 4@h and West bids Backwood|pg||
nt|brolucius: Obviously does not show a diamond control, when bid so slowly... |pg||
nt|Walddk2: West in the other room could not be 100% certain that they had a heart control between them|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sometimes you have to lie:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: but we were deprivd of watchi9ng for it|pg||
nt|hedyg: and a @d switch..|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: in open room the heart barrage by n/s identified the heart shortnes to west|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  well bid 4 hearts, thats good lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: Lauria cannot/willnot pass with this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Long pause then 4@S is not really the way to bid the hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S seems a bit risky on those values.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  YES - take @S Ace and play @H|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: cambiaghi apologize for his bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: franco saved him|pg||
nt|xenya: this one might not be easy|pg||
nt|irwinbo: he will now make it|pg||
nt|hedyg: actually the @c gave nothing, declarer would have played small @c to jack|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for sure - also more that one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Irwin :)|pg||
nt|varange: and then to not forget :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be OK after a jump shift but West has not really suggested full slam values, just because he bid 3@S.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D does not help Giubilo one bit|pg||
nt|lestergold: still hard here how does west know that Lauria hasnt got two small hearts now?|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: so 2 @H was nf?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: indeed - and here it will be difficult to get a @C ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: West correctly assumes that East must have a heart control for his strong bidding with nothing in trumps.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 4@S denied a red cue bid (I assume it did), 5@D should also promise a heart control|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: without club lead declarer can afford to bang down club ace before leading up to it to cater for the KC stiff|pg||
nt|xenya: not clear what happened -- any ideas?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wilkinsona:  has east not shown 5 diamonds 4clubs and 3 spades, perhaps|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: 1 IMP back here|pg||
nt|brolucius: With a singleton heart in dummy, South's signal should be suit-preference - not that it makes any difference here.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|varange: maybe some misunderstanding of what 2@d means|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not think he has said anything about club length it was just a cue|pg||
mc|12|nt|vugraphztg: y|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: pass or correct|pg||
nt|xenya: he chose a wrong plan it seems|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Simon :) you are the best!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Listen: We have 4 @H, 3 @C + 2 ACES - here in Denmark the total is 9|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but how do you know you have 4 hearts?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That combines 3-3 @H OR 3-3 @C - not so bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 2@C did, Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I think Lauria has shown 3154|pg||

pc|c5|nt|lestergold: well im urprised on tehse values that e/w felt they could afford a slam investigation to 5 level|pg||
pc|cT|nt|wilkinsona:  diamond lead, ruffing spade hook diamond pitch and led a club up allowing a ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We don't have 521 commentators|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Nunes led the mandatory trump against the known Marmic hand|pg||
nt|milton_se: question is: will they go for 7?|pg||
nt|varange: he'll look for the grand, will he?|pg||
nt|brolucius: West described his hand a lot better here than his counterpart managed at the other table.|pg||

nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: @SQ-x-x was not enough for North to bid 3NT on his own, so he bids the hearts one more time. (Particularly as the opening bid promised only four cards).|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  maybe 12 tricks..|pg||
nt|henryb: have you started drinking already?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hawe45:  The wrong hand is playing here - most of us bid 2 NT as East - after pdÂ´s 2 @C|pg||

nt|bridge_one: it is the gheste with exclusion of suit - so 3@C deny @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|doncapone1: pa  noapte  buna|pg||
nt|lml: good bid by East giving west a choice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now Clair has revealed the diamond position|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1S clear with that hand regardless of toybox|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: always, also after 1red open|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So they might as well take the save in 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: An overcall to show both majors would have worked better here|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed -- EW can take a few tricks in @Hs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S is a transfer to 2NT, and 2NT a transfer to 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Y - with @S lead even @S6 % 5 enter into play|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will Lauria upgrade?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  for example north led a heart vs 3N OR, might not here|pg||
nt|lestergold: if west is now limited to a weak nt then east hasnt got a raise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To sign off in clubs or hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: in 2nt there are weak in @c,weak in @d and strong hands slam try|pg||

nt|lml: this one is pretty easy in either game|pg||
nt|xenya: i think 3N didn't seriously suggest a NT contract -- just a descriptive bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 8 or 9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with 6+ hearts or a balanced hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: excellen lead    ...... for..... declarer|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  good system it seems..|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: no X over 4@s, so 5@H?|pg||
nt|xenya: what is all that supposed to mean?|pg||
nt|milton_se: 2S seems optimistic|pg||
nt|xenya: and where will it get them?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cameo could have bid his hand better. Double must be wrong with a singleton heart|pg||
nt|varange: just forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bid a natural 2@D|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C pass 4@s - now no defence by N/S|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||

pc|c4|nt|lestergold: oh well these guys dont believe in part scores|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol - or going after the VUL game bonus|pg||
nt|lestergold: going after the expected hert lead|pg||

pc|c2|nt|lestergold: i think this is going off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When South follows to three rounds of spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D   3@C  = major ask|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as if one had opened a natural 2NT|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Now Versace needs to avoid a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: 50 per cent though -- any black lead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: and West could have passed if it was appropriate from his hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me 2nt in this sequence is forcing and shows a 4-card support and @c control and 3@c the same without a @c control|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H was a gutsy bid that deserved 5@H by N imo|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is why i said need to lead D 8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: @H was never bid in OR|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@H not vuln it was a good choise|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: should even up the scores a bit|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is on the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hedy, in open room which overcall by west ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If South had passed at his second turn, I think 4@S would go down|pg||
nt|hedyg: E 2@c, S pass|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec asks what exactly did the 1 spade bid mean|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H seems clear to me. taking the save is not so clear. EW might have only 8 spades, and 3D did not necessarily show 5-5. S has defense and N has no shortness. also, it is not clear ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at all--to me, anyway--whether the pass over 4S is, or should be, forcing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 1@S Roland not so sure declarer can't read the same the hands - with 6@h with one+ honor few don't bid 2@h over 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|Walddk2: forcing? even thinking about it is an overbid|pg||
nt|irwinbo: when he draws trump, south's hand will count out|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: apparently equivalent to a negative double but without holding 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: dbl without spades|pg||
nt|varange: you never know your luck in a big city :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the first set Angelini-Versace played with Fantunes|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 2@H normally nf - otherwise Dbl and np|pg||

pc|d7|pc|s5|pg||
mc|9|nt|brolucius: The support groups are warming up the stage before the main act comes on.|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|xenya: EW had better keep low on this one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - the xfert over 1@C open work very well|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Well bid by Fantunes to reach top spot|pg||
nt|hedyg: anybody bid 3@c with the S hand over 1@s?|pg||
nt|irwinbo: not me|pg||
nt|hedyg: i find it very tempting|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no|pg||
nt|milton_se: 1NT 14-16?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|wilkinsona:  yep 5 diamonds is great|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A heart lead dooms the contract because West must get in with @DQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer does not have enough tricks without diamonds|pg||
nt|varange: probably|pg||
nt|xenya: well now a spade lead looks like a killer|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: okok so i am alone :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid 2C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes Hedy, alone :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poor defence in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spade to the ace and another. At least East could have ashed a top heart first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: cashed even|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, even on a spade continuation, where is the 9th trick?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South know the shortness in @D in North|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can caount 2 down with his hand|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|hawe45:  I DO hope, that South is NOT thinking of any bid but PASS|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|bridge_one: pass because the chance to beat 4@s is hight with K in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh, East endplayed himself|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A in @H in North instead A in @d with K in @c (probably after 4@c) is down before to start|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am sure he would like to forget this deal|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: East had a pretty clearcut pass of 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb: even so, why bid Stayman with North's 4-3-3-3 and extra values|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT is a better game, strangely on a 5-4 heart fit.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@d one 5 major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they play Blue Club, they can only have a 5-card major if maximum (15-16)|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho interesting point here is that 9 cold top tricks in 3n and 4H is only about a 50 percenter|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2@h ask the major|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 2nt...@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: complete duplication|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: So which system is it, Simon; did you ask?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer may attempt some sort of elimination play, to avoid the club finesse.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: like a roman club|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  yep elimni on after the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: and if it wasnt on he would have a fat chance of catchinmg Lauria napping|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would need to eliminate diamonds and exit on the third round of spades - not much of a chance.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  but th spade 9 is in play now is it not?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is not Roman Club for several reasons. 1NT shows 17-20 in RC, and opening 3-card suits is normal|pg||

pc|h2|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Doesn't matter with trumps 3-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leading towards @HQ seems best, but even if it loses, there are certain squeeze chances|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: if you play the @SA first and see the split West has to split spades when you lead to the queen|pg||

nt|lml: oh sorry silly me|pg||
nt|irwinbo: llook at the bidding in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe @c discard better|pg||

nt|varange: tx Simon|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Mind you, Lauria also missed a defensive trick in 5@H doubled on board 1|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: 2@s : txs for 2nt or many distributions|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Can be a IMP to gain for Serbia here. Even more if 6 is bidded and @D hitted. Exspext a flat board|pg||
nt|brolucius: Another splendid fit, this time for N/S.|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm 6S is a possible slam to bid with fair chances on a normal spade break|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6C??|pg||
mb|4S|nt|wilkinsona:  slam time?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so one major or other type of strong hand, i think |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: so 4@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@S better because you can sometimes discard a club on the 13th diamond.|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: they don't seem to use the 2@d as a game force checkback|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like it Tony|pg||
nt|hedyg: no only 1 major over 1NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: depending on agreements - i prefere to play multi with only one major|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: Henry your good at percentages what would u say here|pg||
nt|henryb: Trabucchi now ahead three boards to one|pg||
nt|lestergold: dims 3/3u dont have to ind the club q and two way search is better than 50% normally because of the info that gets picked up |pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  Strange to le the weak hand play!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  let|pg||
nt|henryb: 6@s is about 66%|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wilkinsona:  thought it was just a mater of 6 or 7|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 4@c : 5@h and 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: at least|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  thanks, Simon|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: after 2@s bid|pg||
nt|lml: not crazy about that bidding structure|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: so 6S is probably better than 50% slam|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: Will make if S ruffs 2@d on the table before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: might require careful handling|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Somewhat lucky that Lauria does not have anything wasted in diamonds|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: is it clear to lead a heart? what about a club at trick 2?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: shud W cue 5@D?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: now the @d finess|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both suits (@S and @D) are placed in favor of declarer - who kan even afford to loose a @D-trick|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Ralf, that seems the best  plan|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps the only winning one|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Still 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: That's not safe|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW feeling confortable ahead probably see no reson to gamble here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  maybe north told him about the diamond situation|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|henryb: even better because you might not get a heart lead!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Lost some tempo now so max 11. Can become 10 and gain for Romania|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|brolucius: A 9-6 scoreline after 13 boards is not exactly a swingy set.|pg||

pc|d5|nt|vugraphzzw: thank you for watching. Goodbye!!|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: yep no heart lead adding more equity|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: attacking hearts too soon means a spade ruff (almost inevitable) will lock you out of dummy|pg||

nt|xenya: which is excellent|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S i meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: grazie,you too!|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: let's hope they land in 4@H NOW|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: surely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What's wrong with 6@C?|pg||
nt|lestergold: always hard to bid the 'par' of 5H here at these colours|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|henryb: 5@h is two down, Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: red Ks do not have to be favourably placed|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ralfwil: 2@s will show a good - at least 5-card - @s and a good hand|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm afraid that might not be too easy though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is right-sided|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kiwibridge: just 2@D losers|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|varange: fantoni pushing hard in the bidding on brd 14|pg||
nt|xenya: nothing, really, 6@C is OK|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: Which two diamond losers if I may ask|pg||
nt|milton_se: nothing wrong at all, but South can't see it|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3@s with N cards|pg||
nt|varange: but Nunes makes the slam-killer 3NT bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: You cannot finesse them both.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: that's that|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|varange: the ace and the queen |pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: The thing is that this may be huge a swing for Trabucchi because Fantoni will open 1@C in the other room|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sharkey: thanks everyone - interesting match|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i suppose netryprobs Henry|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Our appreciation to the FIGB for ensuring that this event is brought to BBO vugraph. Gianluca Frola, and on behalf of BBO, Vincenzo Delle Cave, have been instrumental in setting up ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: a fine show|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next set after a short break, 10-15 minutes is my estimate|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yeah|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  by the way Roland, spec metions a win for Denmark over Scotland today....|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: everyone has finished|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree with that bidding. Either 3@s from N or 3@d from S after 2nt|pg||
nt|brolucius: No reason to finesse in hearts anyway.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Must be curling|pg||
nt|varange: ah. I see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and *then* they must avoid slam|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|vugraphztg: also fantoni|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think one should be too harsh on NS -- after all, they have only 7 spades, but stoppers in all suits|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  seems so...|pg||
nt|lestergold: restricted choice etc|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: well played|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphztg: byee|pg||
nt|varange: thanks all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thx all and bye for now|pg||
nt|varange: bye simon|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But we lost to Sweden in women's handball, that's bad|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this 1Nt is strange (normally 4@H + 5+ in a minor) - they probably use to give a open strong without other major|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h6|pc|c7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Losing to Sweden is terrible, in all sports|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|hedyg: ty all, bye for now|pg||
nt|xenya: would be in interesting to see the result in OR on that hand|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thanks all and bye!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: bye|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|wilkinsona:  ...its just a game...|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back soon|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  by for now..|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: bye|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|rocco47: non hanno detto contro, cosi sorpasso per 1 mp|pg||
mc|11|nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|bridge_one: BEY ALL ! this last hand very good ! |pg||
nt|hedyg: so Lucchesi goes on to the next round|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty all, good night, buona notte|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer follows Restricted Choice in the club suit, winning against single @CQ or @CJ, losing only to @CQ-J, odds of 2-to-1 in his favour.|pg||
nt|henryb: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: see u later folks|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks to Simon, our great operator! |pg||
nt|lestergold: also safe play in any case because he cant afford to let Lauria in in case 3Dims can be cashed|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ty|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks for watching!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: bye!|pg||
nt|lestergold: bye thx to all got a little mre interesting in later handfs|pg||
