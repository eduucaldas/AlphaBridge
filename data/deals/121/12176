nt|justin c: five spades, heart ace, diamond through would constitute a 'good thing' i suppose|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|wilkinsona: In gold cup the scores are compared every 8 boards, afterwhich the captains have alternate seeting options|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2 @S would be equal to +110 and 2@D -2 would be a just result|pg||

nt|chthonic: Swing opportunities here|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: this one is a bit trickier|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Sanders is a long standing advocate of the weak NT in all seats at all vulnerabilities.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT for EW played by E|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it is rare|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|xenya: 3N no doubt|pg||

mb|p|pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: 9 easier:)|pg||

nt|xenya: on a bad day, that double could have been costly|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can still be, perhaps..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: as 3N may be possible|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you were right Justin|pg||
nt|justin c: this looks like the better game|pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: undo please|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: Either pre-emptive or slam try in spades|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: once again EW come in...|pg||
nt|justin c: 5@C just on the trump guess, but 3NT has potential tricks everywhere|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that will help the twins|pg||
nt|chthonic: A rather tame ending, well judged.  Potential in other room for more action.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: yes, now S can count on 3 tricks in clubs|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: 2@s any invite|pg||
nt|xenya: now it's easy -- 8 top tricks plus the @HJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: asking about lead styles|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Bif McGeorge makes the normal lead from west..|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h7|nt|wilkinsona: ..this time to more effect|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wilkinsona: ..but seems to give the 9th trick|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wilkinsona: this may go down also|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Margaret when you get a chance, who are NS?|pg||

pc|c5|nt|wilkinsona: thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: It's christine have updated|pg||
pc|c9|nt|wilkinsona: only a spade switch holds to 8 it seems|pg||

nt|xenya: *find|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

pc|d4|nt|yo_yo: well i suppose normal|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, interfering always creats probs, but NS seemed to have agreements sorted, and with an extra club in the north hand would have played 2Cxx|pg||

nt|rednaxela: E/W need to get their Club trick established early, before it goes on Diamonds.|pg||

nt|xenya: it's true that N was unlikkely to have 7 hearts, but the play doesn't cost |pg||
nt|justin c: i guess if north's hand is an overcall, east's is a fit jump|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: that one should have been -3 but may have escaped for -2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not a classic fit jump  but  a bit good for a siple 2@S maybe|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|wilkinsona: this might not make either!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: my granny told me to always have a good suit when I fit jump!|pg||
nt|justin c: Sanders' granny not nearly so shy|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, EW had better stay out of game here|pg||
nt|xenya: and they did|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it is a good suit though when it breaks 2-2|pg||
nt|chthonic: Or perhaps NS had a misunderstanding about a possible transfer overcall??|pg||
mb|2N|nt|xenya: interesting pass by W -- are they playing a strong 1@C or something?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: best to play the ace here|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: prompt @S switch from south will deal with this|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: nice practical bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, without the double, seems a guess..|pg||
nt|chthonic: I would guess a misunderstanding.  West opened a strong club and north bid 1H.  Seems NS got their systems confused.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: west does sell here to settle for 3N diamond fit not withstanding|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yes, the knowledge that partner is not 16+ symplifies things no end|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: S should pass|pg||
nt|xenya: no...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: the stiff 9@S very important card|pg||
nt|chthonic: And here we have a reverse auction in which the fourth suit serves as a weak relay preparatory to a signoff.  |pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: i must say i don't understand 4@S|pg||
nt|justin c: trying to get a forcing game going|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a trick in each suit to lose  and a sharp double by South|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: a bit lucky perhaps -- many would bid game with EW's hands, vulnerable|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: checking cc|pg||
nt|xenya: and 3N looks particularly promising|pg||
nt|xenya: also, S might consider a double over 1@S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this runs into a ruff, but a small ruff was better for north it seems|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wilkinsona: so might go differently elsewhere|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mmmakela: y they did "well" in OR to reach 3 NT|pg||
nt|xenya: once again, declarer seems to have adopted an inferior plan|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Even 1NT in danger it seems|pg||
nt|xenya: what if S switches to @Cs now?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: seems the contract will be in danger then?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, club could have beaten it...|pg||
nt|xenya: but this gives declarer a vital tempo|pg||
nt|xenya: that would have probably led to 1N played by N|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: 3@S by N is by no means inviting|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rnmalik: J@S now|pg||
nt|xenya: well it makes of course -- but what is the percentage?|pg||
nt|justin c: cant see any way home for declarer here|pg||
nt|justin c: Imagine north will continue @H|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|mmmakela: this MUST be wrong|pg||
nt|justin c: waiting for me to predict something so he can do the opposite :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: The Collins team live in Kent, so a long journey up to Peebles for the finals |pg||
nt|yo_yo: a @C now will kill any danger of a trump coup|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I think Gerald Tred might be wishing he hadnt doubled |pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: EW being somewhat cautious|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: in fact 3N made OR|pg||
nt|xenya: they can't do that i think, with @Hs blocked|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: reasonable to settle for game..|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rnmalik: badly played no other reason|pg||
nt|chthonic: One too many -- trying to get a swing -- with the usual bad ending.  These cards really are not offensive in nature|pg||
nt|chthonic: Only a distribution that does not exist can give declarer any hope -- AX of hearts in the north hand|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|yo_yo: The Tredinnick twins were in the final last year |pg||
nt|rednaxela: Can't say I'd have found that lead.|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: yep|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: 7 from eleven |pg||
pc|h9|nt|wilkinsona: they can, though..south opened 1 spade 3rd place and got an unwanted spades lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: It's a cue bid!|pg||
nt|xenya: but naturally, W is reluctant to bid 3N with @Hs wide open -- as he might suspect|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: they won an  IBPA award for the  Precision best bid hand of the year: http://personal.eunet.fi/pp/lneimo/2009_IBPA_Awards.pdf|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: 10 tricks but game is hard to reach even after N has opened|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|xenya: so a flat board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice hand for Rubens Transfer Advances - 2@D from  West (hearts), then 2@S |pg||
nt|justin c: thought the other table might reach it if north passes as dealer|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|xenya: but to be fair, it's not quite obvious where and how they could get in|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then East might move on|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|xenya: as a result, they reach a hopeless minor-suit game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it's hard to get to 4@H if no-one bids hearts|pg||

pc|d2|nt|wilkinsona: well at least they had a diamond overcall vs a take out x in OR|pg||

nt|rednaxela: 2NT suggest 15-17, which is a bit of an overstatement.|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile Collins have increased the lead to 32 imps|pg||

pc|sT|nt|wilkinsona: somewhat different auction to OR|pg||
nt|xenya: very different|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and north doubles for a club lead|pg||

nt|mmmakela: spades and clubs ideally for decl|pg||

pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona: declarer can keep norths clubs out of the picture |pg||
nt|xenya: 3N does look a stretch, and N's double is --er -- a bit optimistic|pg||
nt|xenya: this should be down 1 |pg||
nt|xenya: even if he misguesses @Hs, he is almost certain to get @Cs right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@C, @D and a @H-no |pg||
nt|xenya: sorry i was a bit rash it seems|pg||
nt|xenya: same problem in trumps|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S should count the losers and only makes he reduces his losers to 3 from 4|pg||
nt|xenya: well of course he can win now and play another club but that would be far from safe|pg||
nt|rnmalik: anothe @C-A and back|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or 2|pg||
nt|chthonic: Whether ace and another and a heart back for the ruff, or the underlead directly, it should be done|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: looks like a spade at trick 3, then|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: South deep in thought|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder what message @H 8  was?|pg||
nt|rednaxela: He may be wondering where declarer's high cards are for his 2NT.  Really needs a Diamond honour but wouldn't have played the suit that way if he had one.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bet @D 10 is coming|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: South's brow still furrowed|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Sime back in the lead.  5 imps on the previous board where 2@s went off against 1@s made at this table.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: couple os small swings put the Sime team back in front but that may be short lived..|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: what a relief for E to see the @DQ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
mc|8|nt|xenya: the auctions in both rooms were practically identical except that in the OR S passed over N's 4@S -- here he bid 4N|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: double fit time|pg||
nt|rednaxela: This could test our players' high level judgement.|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: Yes he did|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer tried to keep his option open, playing back a diamond and got in a mess|pg||
nt|rnmalik: their lead is also reducing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: last board of the set now|pg||
nt|chthonic: Bye all|pg||
nt|chthonic: A three IMP pickup for the favorable vulnerability save|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, the match is much closer now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|wilkinsona: odds are the final contract will be doubled|pg||
mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: so well done by Derek Sanders for the first big swing of the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Here is an interesting situation -- with the awful diamond split, disaster looms|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yo_yo: fit jumps at the 5 level, crickey|pg||
nt|rnmalik: last board of the segment|pg||
nt|xenya: and this is the last board of stanza 4|pg||
nt|xenya: i like S's 3N -- somewhat unfortunate N had 6 spades and bid them|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: We have been too high for the last three bids.  Will it stop?|pg||
nt|xenya: 4 more to come|pg||
mb|3H|nt|wilkinsona: yes, but if he bid 3 spades first he would then pass 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: true|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mmmakela: E promising 15-17 now|pg||
nt|xenya: 1N=15-17|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: last board of this set.. thanks everyone, next set starts 2pm GMT|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: and straight into bat again..|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if covers 7&8 guarantee a stopper|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not so easy to see where tricks come from here..|pg||
nt|xenya: playing a strong NT, EW would have probably landed in 2@S -- i wonder if that was available here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6@D?|pg||
nt|rednaxela: too high to make, I meant.  5@c was obviously a great save.|pg||
nt|chthonic: A nice call|pg||
mb|4C|nt|wilkinsona: thats a well judged pass of 4 clubs by John Matheson...|pg||
nt|xenya: he could hardly do that in their methods i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: 2 Heart - reverse attitude, suit preference|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|wilkinsona: oops..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: that pass by Bif...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...invites the wrong decision...|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Converting to 6@d gave E/W two more chances to go wrong at no extra cost!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Sanders is wondering what the pass meant|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if it gave him  a choice, he might go on|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N looks quite playable here -- the 2@D opening (somewhat unorthodox perhaps) seems to have worked well|pg||
nt|xenya: this requires careful play|pg||
nt|justin c: 2@C some sort of checkback looking for @S fit|pg||
nt|justin c: and finding it|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: yes and McGeorge shows a max with 3@S|pg||
nt|chthonic: a tempting call.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: ..admit I would't find it..|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: may pass, dont really expect him to x|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh oh|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: Now North is thinking|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south should have doubled, surely|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|xenya: not that 2@S is much better on this layout|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that double didnt take long|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|justin c: i have to go, bye all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: bye|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wilkinsona: it is, but after this sequence to odds that 2 spades is preferable have changed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Derek has had not much luck with finneses..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this contract may be in a spot of bother|pg||
nt|chthonic: And making five will finish us off -- six diamonds down in the other room for a swing to the leaders|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rednaxela: Well, well!|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: Quick as a flash!|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|xenya: for example, if declarer banks on 3-2 @S, he will go down|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|wilkinsona: ...successful with the drop here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wilkinsona: its easy when we see 4 hands, but Bif could have double 6d and stuart 6 h|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer has the rest|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: yes, i understand -- still W is 5-4-3-1|pg||
nt|justin c: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if so, it will undo a bit of the good work on the two previous boards|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d2|mc|12|nt|rnmalik: -1 now|pg||
nt|chthonic: or six.|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: last stanza has finished, thanks all for watching and thank you to Craig for commentating|pg||
nt|chthonic: six hearts was not a good contract -- a diamond lead --- |pg||
nt|chthonic: Thanks, all -- enjoyable match|pg||
