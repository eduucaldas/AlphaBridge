nt|jillm:  at the other table they also o'called 1nt but north bid 2d so ew got back to hearts,  garvey made a nice pass here, a good suit and an entry|pg||
nt|athene: big opportunity for Small here|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|lml: yes I think Small is going to win.  Garvey and Cooke have had a very good game at this table|pg||
nt|jillm:  another potential swing|pg||
nt|roswolf: especially on bds 17-20|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S opener was really something|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No part score here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jillm:  yup|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hinden's 4@S is my style|pg||
nt|athene: now NS play 4@C as non-leaping michaels i think so south will be a bit stuck maybe|pg||
nt|ady: slam time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6DX|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: he can double or just bid 4@C anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a great bid by the lady again|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: shows c and h|pg||
nt|jillm:  i think you need a better hand to overcall 4c|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|athene: garve might like his hand facing 5-5 in hearts and clubs :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Cooke put a club among his hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of prime controls|pg||
nt|jillm:  i didn't realize he showed hearts also|pg||
nt|athene: he has room for 4@D as a generic slam try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Non-leaping Michaels, clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but he may feel he is too good|pg||
nt|lml: he has quite a nice hand here|pg||
nt|athene: or you could play 4@D = slam try in @H, and 4@S = slam try in @C |pg||
nt|roswolf: north is odds on to explore and may punt a slam|pg||
nt|athene: lots of room, just a Q of agreements|pg||
nt|jillm:  if his partner is supposed to be 5/5 and he is looking for slam he might bid 6h to set clubs up for pitches|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: 6 diamonds a good spot|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But 6 @D with a @H-lead seems to be one down|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed 5nt pick a slam is possible|pg||
nt|ady: does not have to be down     draw one trump   then  play hearts|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Right|pg||
nt|ady: may be difficult slam to bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes, the bidding, we see, looks natural|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html  for standings after round 8 of 9 |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: he could easily bid the heart slam |pg||
nt|roswolf: going a scientific route|pg||
nt|jillm:  roland, what was 5d?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have no idea|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though 4@D was natural - or Cooke thought it was|pg||
nt|Walddk2: D support I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: natural|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|roswolf: overboard|pg||
nt|lml: this might be hard to beat|pg||
nt|roswolf: could make 5@H with the chinese finesse i suppose|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think you can make 5@H legitimately|pg||
nt|athene: well lead @HJ certainly picks up the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so you have just two diamond losers|pg||
nt|jillm:  i would be very nervous if I were North playing a 4/3 after a preempt by opponent|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jillm:  has to shorten the "long" suit right away|pg||
nt|lml: I think there might have been a shot on a small spade lead but not this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: s says 4d poss a H flag|pg||
nt|athene: maybe pitch a @D from dummy on this trick|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: just trying to retain control to limit the undertricks if it all goes wrong|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||

pc|d9|pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|athene: i think this board should be chalked up as part of the cost you pay for non-leaping michaels|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: but even so, it looks as though they had a misunderstanding over 4@D as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: an original push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 17 also played in game next door|pg||
nt|athene: they could have survived if it had gone 4@C - 4@D (slam try in @H) - 4@H (no thanks!) -  pass|pg||

nt|lml: hello|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Linda Lee|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D may not be everyone's cup of tea in first, but it's their style|pg||
nt|athene: no weak-2@D opener available for NS (they play Multi) but Garvey would probably have bid 3@D anyway|pg||
nt|lml: I am old fashioned.  I remember when three level preempts used to show 7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That was in the 1930's, Linda|pg||
nt|athene: 7? he has 8! :) one to spare :)|pg||
mb|p!|an|forc to rdbl|nt|athene: oh, you mean seven cards in your suit|pg||
nt|lml: its not just that he has 6, its the quality of the suit and the fact that his hand is flat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it does make it harder for E-W to bid their reasonable grand slam|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4@D is very pre-emptive - west has to bid 4major on a wide range of strengths|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tough for Hirst to express his values. 4@H could be anything|pg||
nt|lml: well I would bid again on the East hand.  Lets see if he does|pg||
nt|athene: because going to the 5-level voluntarily is very serious indeed|pg||
nt|lml: then Hirst should get excited|pg||
nt|lml: if East takes a bid then they might still get quite high|pg||
nt|athene: South's decision over 4@D was interesting too - he knows opps prohbably have at least a small slam on|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
nt|lml: 4@S seems like a reasonable slam try|pg||
nt|athene: one theory is that if you bid 5@D there, west will bid 5major showing values (or double) and you make it *easier* for them to bid a slam|pg||
nt|lml: hi Geoff|pg||
nt|athene: but if you just pass, west will bid a heavy 4major|pg||
nt|athene: and east might pass with a heavy 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: and there they rest|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: as indeed happened|pg||
nt|lml: well you got it right|pg||
nt|athene: this is why people like to pre-empt lots these days :)|pg||
nt|lml: I would have bid again|pg||
nt|lml: 4@S is pretty safe|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: e/w can make 9 tricks in no-trumps  on a spade lead     can make 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: West will know you have 6 and on a terrible hand he can often pass|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: while pre-empts are nasty why no forward move?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is too cautious imo|pg||
nt|lml: I would make a forward move even if that weren't true|pg||
nt|lml: I agree complete with you|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|ady: I think North is well pleased to be out of the auction|pg||
pc|h2|nt|justin c: after the 3@D opening you probably dont want to be in 7|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: but then again you convinve yourself that things might not be spltting|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|justin c: increased chance of bad major suit break|pg||
nt|marlowepi: an old-fashioned E would pass with that umpteen loser hand, and S might open a strong NT and go down 3|pg||

mb|3H|mb|4S|mb|4N|mb|5S|mb|6H|nt|jtr: It is a new world when they have to be alerted:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxx: Results should be refreshed shortly after this match: http://tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html|pg||
nt|jallerton: surely too rissky to bid 7|pg||
nt|jallerton: unlikely to be on firm ground over 5@S|pg||
nt|jtr: Will they lead a @s if he does?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Great stuff, the Yarborough man bidding, freely, at the 4-lavel|pg||
nt|bobh1: if 4n was RKC then what is 6@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: undiscussed?|pg||
nt|bobh1: sounds like it might be a @s void|pg||
nt|bobh1: most people have discussed this|pg||
nt|bobh1: DEPO is the most common agreement|pg||
nt|jallerton: so 6@H is not allowed?|pg||
nt|jtr: Better than DOPI as you can show voids|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|bobh1: of course allowed but perhaps shows a void|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Is that key card?  For how many keys?  and other possible questions|pg||
mb|7H|nt|bobh1: good save|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North's pass is plain wrong!|pg||
mb|7S|nt|jtr: Odd number with ahigher ranking void for me|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobh1: pass of 6@s confirms the void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: aThe wrong hand bid the grand and west knows it|pg||

pc|dK|nt|jtr: Bit wet to pass|pg||
