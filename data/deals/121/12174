nt|chthonic: Yes.  hard to judge accurately|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chthonic: Well, defense still has to perform|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbe: sorry, different distribution|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|Walddk7: Morning David, Peter and Mike|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|chthonic: good signaling by defense here -- I assume both have suit preferenced for hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome Back|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Final Stanza and only 12 imps between the teams|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good evening to Mike Gold|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome back to the 2nd stanza with your operators Christine and Stuart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult to judge what the South hand is worth facing a 2NT opener|pg||
nt|athene: this would have decent chances on a minor-suit lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: AKx of hearts would be better, with the @CQ instead. @HQ is rather wasted  |pg||
nt|april7: unfortunately 1 down, no parkingplace for the @S or @D loser|pg||
nt|athene: as it is, he might duck a spade and hope for (very unlikely) minor-suit squeeze|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: S asking if 4th lead, E says no as he has doubled, therefore presuming its a 3rd or 5th card lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we could speculate about this for some time, methinks|pg||
nt|athene: ducking a spade rectifies the count but also gives up on the @SJ being some sort of menace|pg||
nt|athene: he will be thinking about complicated three-suit squeezes without the count|pg||
nt|athene: we may be here for some time...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as one does...|pg||
nt|april7: whats the difference whether its 4th or 3d/5th lead|pg||
nt|athene: i think north should bid 3@C over 2@S here|pg||
nt|chthonic: Not sure about covering that card.  Was ten tricks, now nine|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Roland and all All distinguished players here|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: if he isn't going to open 3@C|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|athene: there might be some ending where you really need to know the distribution|pg||
nt|lestergold: Forrester a legend playing with well known Peter Crouch|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w xenior world champions|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east is strictly speaking not west|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk7: and good morning to Jeffrey Allerton|pg||
nt|jallerton: Hello everybody|pg||

nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome back|pg||
nt|chthonic: With the club lead, five will roll smoothly|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west is his more regular partner and has many successes to his name|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wilkinsona: yep, Chris seemed to suspect some underhand lead from south|pg||
nt|chthonic: surely a diamond now|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|petepunt: looks like he wil play for a @D @C sqz that doesnt work|pg||
nt|athene: even if you got to a successful throw-in ending (e.g. @SKQ, @CQ with east) he could just exit with the @CQ to block the suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if West throws a club now, he likely has five, with four on the table|pg||
nt|chthonic: absolutely|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|april7: duülication of values|pg||
nt|xenya: EW were a bit lucky on that one|pg||
nt|col3435: yes not much going on in that board|pg||
mb|1C|nt|petepunt: doubt N will raise 1N here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: u would normally want to be in 4S on the e/w cards|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: yes, surprising decision from west to pass 3nt with four spades and a small doubleton|pg||
nt|col3435: 14-16 NT, I believe?|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|nt|april7: here we have an easy 4@S contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a superb exampple of a 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3N seems to work here ith 5 clubs off|pg||
nt|chthonic: It has been suggested that a club at trick two would have made the defense harder.  True, but declarer must also guess clubs.  I am told that was done at other table but clubs not ...|pg||
nt|chthonic: guessed|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Tony Wilkinson|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they are|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone, close match|pg||
nt|lestergold: Waterlow will not expect 5 spades on his left on the bidding|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 1@d = "Stayman"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: In the other s/f Matheson - Sime bid 1N-3N. @HK lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT =17-19|pg||
nt|athene: north way too good for 3@C|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: but no convenient cue-bid; it's possible to use 2NT in that position as the good raise|pg||
nt|april7: it wil be a 4@H contract for EW|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: hard to see how many spades there are for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear Crouch to the 'rescue'|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chthonic: What was 2H?  |pg||
nt|col3435: well it looks like this sequence shows an invite with 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: finding the usual Jxx in dummy |pg||
nt|petepunt: 1@C two + ?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: chance for Robson    has to sniff club position|pg||
nt|chthonic: This will be difficult enough at the five level...|pg||
nt|chthonic: He cannot really bid six |pg||
nt|chthonic: with those spades and no spade cue bid.|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to blame crouch he knows pard has length in spades but expects his vlaues to be elsewhere!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4Sx in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: big swing to Waterlow in the wings then|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Tony|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi again Mike ..I have been re-rostered|pg||
nt|lestergold: in time to see Forrester roasted here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Paul leads his partners suit|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: my partners stopped leading my suits a while back|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im not convinced of the soundness o Crouch's actions here with an aceless 6 count and a poor heart suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: at end of day Crouch should realise that his club values are not working too well in offence|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petepunt: X of 2@S would be negative and show similar ahand for N|pg||
nt|athene: four top losers, and nowhere to put them even if the defence don't cash them right off|pg||
nt|athene: @H1097 lead more likely than @HK onside; maybe you rise ace here|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 17-19 3Hts|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: perhaps he just decided that with everyone bidding, Robson had to have a light 2@C overcall, so 3@C wasn't going to hurt|pg||
nt|april7: after ace of@D E has a choice ow plays and might guess wrong, so E must help and lead @C after K of @H|pg||
nt|athene: a trump lead is possible, with declarer known to have three|pg||
nt|athene: trying just to stop a ruff in the closed hand|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: but that sort of "trusting opponents" strategy can allow opps to talk you out of things|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: dare I say I'm not convinced by the soundness of norths double|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d3|nt|jallerton: yes, any 11-13/17-19 bal or natural|pg||
nt|athene: of course it might find partner's @HQ :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: better to trust your partner|pg||
pc|sK|nt|april7: good duck by N|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h3|nt|chthonic: Well on the way to nine tricks with straightforward play|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be able to get a count now|pg||
nt|ady: can make now without club finesse|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@D showed @Hs, 2@HS was 4 hearts and minimum -- well, S decided it was worth bidding 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: im getting questionjs from specs is Crouch the footballer -answer er .... no.... another do we agree with forrester's double?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|d9|nt|jallerton: The @d play for 3 tricks anyway, so the lead did not give away the contract|pg||
nt|chthonic: but needed to play diamonds|pg||
nt|col3435: lack of entries to dummy gives you something to worry about|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|april7: E guessed wron but still down because 9 and 10 of @D dont drop|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|d5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer had the @D10, it would be necessary for west to play a club now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: so well done|pg||
nt|ady: now set up long diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was dangerous but passing is also dangerous|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petepunt: playing 1n as 17-19 means you can bid over 1@C on very min values safely|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: east, of course, knows the diamonds aren't going anywhere for declarer|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|dT|pc|cT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: mind u on this hand this crouch bravely rushed in for the ball just l;ike his fottball namesake|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|athene: north has to play @SQ right away to block the suit|pg||
nt|ady: cant think why Silverstone dis not cash 2nd spade  and then switch to a diamond|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well oppo seem to be running into trouble so I like the pass found elsewhere|pg||
nt|lestergold: dixon lutrked in the long grass and pounced with the north hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: Dixon was of course a great money player in his youth|pg||
nt|lestergold: money p,layers often have a killer insinct combined with  protective hide|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|col3435: what would 1@c : 1M mean? do we know?|pg||
nt|athene: as well as causing problems in the bidding, the nebulous 1@C opener can make things hard for the defence in the play, though - they might not think of declarer having a concealed ...|pg||
nt|athene: trick source in diamonds|pg||
nt|chthonic: eight. then|pg||
pc|hQ|mc|9|nt|jallerton: N/S play an interesting treatment: 1@h/@S response to 1@c shows a 5+-card suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: knowing Crouch, it won't be natural|pg||
nt|athene: oh, sorry, the @DQ is good too :) no need|pg||
nt|april7: 11 tricks  not needing double finesese|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S looks normal for north, assuming 1@S promised five|pg||

nt|lestergold: Waterlow one of the games great gentlemen not a ompliment i hand out lightly|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|april7: e won't give up|pg||
nt|athene: some might bid only 3@S with south over the double, but you don't really know what to do when they then bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: so you might as well take the "4@S over 4@H" push right away|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: best lead for the defence here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now double from east|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@S = 1NT|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: strangely may be correct to have ducked the J|pg||
nt|chthonic: interesting point.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chthonic: JD in other room?  Seems same line would have brought in contract.  Robson's play was very nice -- not tested to find club queen as he would have been if two spades were cashed|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: how on earth did 5@H make in the other room? :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I remmeber sparring with Watermow 40 years ago at the Harrow Bridge Club when i was a real beginner as opposed to merely an old begiiner|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: in order to take the spade finesse, perhaps....|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk7: lol|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: west gets in with a heart to promote a second trump it seems|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you agree with North's t/o double?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: but he was a bit unlucky his partner had such a great heart suit|pg||
nt|athene: and nothing at all wasted in spades|pg||
nt|petepunt: trying to cut out @S suit with his opening , i suspect|pg||
nt|athene: double is game-try (3@S would be merely competing)|pg||

pc|s9|nt|petepunt: non vul yes, but vul|pg||
nt|april7: the only way toplay 7@H is the ruffing finesse in @C and fortunate @H are 2-2. Hand much to strong for a 5@C opening.imo|pg||

nt|lestergold: pass very conservative|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has 17 and 4 of the other major|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: another good board for leading your own suit, NOT partner's|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: True, David, but North's double told him hearts were not breaking|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|ady: 15 hcp  n/s   playing in 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: undoubled|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yas, and a swing still needed|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: interesting sequence here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this appears to be on the trump hook, and after that diamond lead from ace must be odds on|pg||
nt|chthonic: easy to see from our vantage point that ace of clubs, ruff, AK of trumps and a diamond works.  But what else?    Except the heart finesse|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wilkinsona: diamond J for -4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possible 5@C sacrifice EW, but you don't have to sacrifice if the opps don't bid game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and anyway not obvious how EW get in the bidding|pg||
nt|petepunt: its a perfect fit n/s |pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you want to play this hand in game? I suppose it's virtually cold if @s are 2-2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: three minor losers, and the hearts can be played either way |pg||
nt|petepunt: need to guess 1major suit right |pg||
nt|athene: 3@C was clearly intended as pre-emptive|pg||
nt|lestergold: givi8ng opps easy ride in 2 of a minor is nor normally recommended bridge altho here cards not lying too well for e/w so their 'pushing' power is limited|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: west can put two spades through but it doesn't quite give east three trump tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: will silverstone hook the @S9 for the overtrick? :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jallerton: why do you have to guess @h?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: trouble is 3N may de on EW|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, the third heart goes on a diamond |pg||
nt|athene: but i am not sure you can play that without a lot of artificial kit, because you need some way to make a real (invitational) 3@C bid|pg||
nt|col3435: South doesn't have much for his 4@d here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|ady: Silverstone could have taken action    asfar as Dixon was concerned Silverstone might have a bust|pg||

mb|p|nt|davidstern: Ah win heart and four rounds of clubs pitching heart and three diamonds |pg||

mb|p|nt|petepunt: isnt 1n 17-19 ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d = no 5-card major, 1NT =17-19|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: W will X and E will bid 2@S|pg||

pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: no fears about re-opening|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not a big fan of 1NT, with only one spade stop|pg||
nt|athene: silverstone just needs to know if his partner has a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|athene: if he has, 6@C must be good|pg||
pc|h3|nt|col3435: so what does N have avaiable here? Is this showing short @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 3@S - singleton club 3 suit hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzaf: In principle 44 Majors  but TF judged his hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: will worry @D may be 4-1|pg||
nt|jallerton: Declarer may try to lead a @s hoping 2nd hand has the ace, planning to switch to @d|pg||
nt|jallerton: though contuining @s OK if with @s 3-3 or guesses @h|pg||
nt|jallerton: Declarer does not know that @c are 4-4|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks like 7 tricks tho.|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you might bid 1nt to show values, but here, partner is never moving over it anyway, so you aren't getting to game|pg||
nt|april7: If N finds Q of @C, 7 tricks, if not....|pg||
nt|athene: so why not just bid 2@D?|pg||
nt|april7: should E have a singleton @D then 6 @C to be made|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure he has  achieved much by taking this very scenic route to 3nt|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, thats what happened OR|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|petepunt: inersting tx|pg||

nt|lestergold: just the one to be made providing ofm course e/w cash out|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|april7: S will try @D and then doublefinesse in @H|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|athene: at BAM i think he takes the @DAK and gives up; there's too much danger of conceding 12 tricks otherwise|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: now he needs three heart tricks |pg||
nt|athene: do you start with the @HJ or a small one? the @HJ looks very silly if west has a singleton @HK|pg||
nt|athene: but gains against singleton @H10 offside or west not covering|pg||

pc|sK|nt|petepunt: a@D first would have avoided this guess ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Knew ducking a @d to East was safe as East could not be cashing two clubs (West known to have the jack)|pg||

pc|dT|nt|chthonic: play club ace first, actually|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petepunt: not by W though|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can still try something, though defence will find a counter now it seems|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: now a spade to the @S10, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: it's always a delicate business when you want to draw trumps but preserve a trump in dummy to control a weak suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: going for the drop of @SQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you have any reason whatsoever to expect your @d to be better than partner's @h?|pg||
nt|april7: another tough decision|pg||
nt|athene: you might play the @HA now, on the basis that even if east does have @HQxx left, you have chances of getting the diamond away on a club|pg||
nt|april7: restricted choice :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: no|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: no problems now; @DQ, ruff away the ace, etc|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: final knockings always held in the plush setting of the Peebles hotel where much fione dining take splace away from the table|pg||

nt|jallerton: This is the last board.  Many thanks to our operator in Peebles.  64 boards is a lot!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Can't gain 14 IMPs even if they bid a slam|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Unless they get doubled and redouble|pg||
nt|jallerton: 14 is the swing for grand vs game NV|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Thankyou Goodnight all Christine|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jallerton: but @cA can't run away|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|Walddk6: Well done, Christine! Please pass that on to all operators. They have been great!|pg||
nt|jcwla: Barring something outre, it's Allfrey and Collins in tomorrow's final.  Thanks to Roland, Stephen, Jeffrey, all other commentators and all specs.  So long for now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 4@c shows @c + @h, but South has a lot more values than he has promised|pg||
nt|Walddk6: But 4@C should be forcing|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Isn't it for you, Jeffrey?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, but he has to guess whether he has sufficient extras for slam|pg||
nt|me argent: 5@Cs not the bravest of bids|pg||
nt|jallerton: I play 4D agrees @H, 4@S agrees @s here|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Right, me too, hence 5@C shows a bad hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: so I would have bid 4@s on North hand|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Dixon's is much better than bad|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: sorry 4@S agrees @c|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||

nt|mdgraham: this will be competitive - NS to reach at least 5@D? |pg||
nt|athene: the opening lead away from a king gave him a tempo|pg||
nt|april7: and the contract|pg||
nt|athene: he might have made the game anyway, though, of course|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure|pg||
nt|davidstern: So it seems|pg||
nt|davidstern: Put me down as an opener and I AM conservative|pg||
nt|chthonic: Gee|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: last board then, so thanks to everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petepunt: last board ?|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D will get them started|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it looks like slam time|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: nice south hand|pg||
mb|3S|nt|petepunt: 5@D will be found now maybe |pg||
nt|april7: 4@H is maximum, so 5 @D a very good save and might push EW to 5 level|pg||
nt|athene: south might bid clubs now, for the lead|pg||
nt|athene: oh, sorry, of course he couldn't|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6C excellent altho in fact nothing wrong with 6N|pg||
mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: I would open, but maybe there are system points we don't know|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: appeal pending in China v. Ch. Taipei match|pg||
mb|3N|nt|col3435: yes score up after every 8 boads|pg||
nt|athene: he needed two diamond tricks :)|pg||
nt|col3435: I'd bid 1@h with the North hand, I think double is unusual these days|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  or 3NT for e/w |pg||
nt|lestergold: now surely Crouch will make some kind fo ffort with his monster|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surprise south had to double|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6H of course also rolls in|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: avid 6 diamonds tho'|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is south could only presumabl;y show his massive two suityer on the first ound with a bid like 4S which may have got them too high on another day|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he doesn't know that EW aren't going to end up in spades|pg||
nt|april7: without a @C lead, perhaps Q of @H lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: A failing 4@H seems possible here. |pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 5@C sugested as more informative by S first time|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps thought that dummy was likely to have a trick source in clubs, in which case an aggressive lead was necessary|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: due to the 6card suit W might raies to 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: they ahve avoided 6D but sadly all the other cold slams|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chthonic: I agree.  South showed some restraint -- a good thing|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   by Silverstone not so good on J@C lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: East will certainly bid game|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jallerton: Yes, this is the last board of the set.  Thanks to our operator, Christine Walker.|pg||
nt|col3435: they're short sets by vugraph standards|pg||
nt|petepunt: a bit of explaining needed to robson :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny how we tend to play sets of eight when most others seem to play sets of 16|pg||
nt|jallerton: A bit of waiting for Robson to finish too!|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Thanks ably assisted by Stuart Bradnam|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might consider holding up the @CK and finessing diamonds into north - that would be right if north had the @HA |pg||
nt|athene: but when people respond 2@C to 1major, it's very often just a balanced hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well this could still be a deciding board|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|chthonic: I pass many hands my partners think I should open, but 13 HCP, 2 1/2 quick tricks and two four card majors is a lot|pg||
pc|c8|nt|davidstern: 3NT had some chances as they avoided the spade lead on the bidding|pg||
pc|cA|nt|april7: E might duck @C and try to finesse @D the right way|pg||
nt|athene: but you look very silly if you lose to @DQx and south has the @HA as entry|pg||
nt|athene: anyway, the @DQ appears so all is well|pg||
nt|davidstern: That isnt the best lead for the defence|pg||
nt|davidstern: 10 tricks now 1-5-1-3|pg||
nt|davidstern: Unless declarer gets confused by the lead|pg||
mc|12|nt|ady: as it happens clubs are blocked  and Robson has not entry    so 3NT will make even on wrong spade guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: Crouch was chicken in my view and i do not see why 3n promised vaslues and upper limit can be quite seriously strong|pg||
nt|lestergold: over 3N he cn afford to bid the 4S he did not want to risk on the first round|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so quickly to the other room thanks all|pg||
nt|lestergold: if forrester jumped to 6D then Crouch could try 6H or 6N|pg||
