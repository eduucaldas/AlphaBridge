pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: well looking lijke 7 imps on the way for Allfrey|pg||
nt|athene: switching to the @CQ probably needs the layout to be almost exactly as it is - partner needs the @HA to stop declarer drawing trumps, and if declarer had slightly weaker clubs you ...|pg||

nt|athene: maybe declarer thought the double of 1@H was standard i.e. promising four spades|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of this session|pg||
nt|lestergold: not er the best play ive ever seen |pg||
nt|athene: even if it was alerted and explained, he might just have had a momentary blackout|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: this should be one down on a spade lead? the defence can set up the spades along with top tricks everywhere else|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: at this level you must read oppos cards or ask questions not be lazy|pg||
nt|lestergold: its tuff a tteh top|pg||
nt|lestergold: in any case the spades were solid missing ace so why play a spade before drawing the trumpets|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: It was explained|pg||
nt|ady: this is 1NT by North|pg||
nt|athene: north's 1NT?|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffe hand and thats exactly what im off to make|pg||
