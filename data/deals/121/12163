pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|vugraphzaf: Welcome back to the 2nd stanza with your operators Christine and Stuart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult to judge what the South hand is worth facing a 2NT opener|pg||
nt|athene: this would have decent chances on a minor-suit lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: AKx of hearts would be better, with the @CQ instead. @HQ is rather wasted  |pg||
nt|april7: unfortunately 1 down, no parkingplace for the @S or @D loser|pg||
nt|athene: as it is, he might duck a spade and hope for (very unlikely) minor-suit squeeze|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: S asking if 4th lead, E says no as he has doubled, therefore presuming its a 3rd or 5th card lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we could speculate about this for some time, methinks|pg||
nt|athene: ducking a spade rectifies the count but also gives up on the @SJ being some sort of menace|pg||
nt|athene: he will be thinking about complicated three-suit squeezes without the count|pg||
nt|athene: we may be here for some time...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as one does...|pg||
nt|april7: whats the difference whether its 4th or 3d/5th lead|pg||

nt|xenya: EW were a bit lucky on that one|pg||
nt|col3435: yes not much going on in that board|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: doubt N will raise 1N here|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, surprising decision from west to pass 3nt with four spades and a small doubleton|pg||
nt|col3435: 14-16 NT, I believe?|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|april7: here we have an easy 4@S contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a superb exampple of a 2@C overcall|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 1@d = "Stayman"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: In the other s/f Matheson - Sime bid 1N-3N. @HK lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT =17-19|pg||
nt|athene: north way too good for 3@C|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: but no convenient cue-bid; it's possible to use 2NT in that position as the good raise|pg||
nt|april7: it wil be a 4@H contract for EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chthonic: What was 2H?  |pg||
nt|col3435: well it looks like this sequence shows an invite with 4 spades|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: finding the usual Jxx in dummy |pg||
nt|petepunt: 1@C two + ?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|petepunt: X of 2@S would be negative and show similar ahand for N|pg||
nt|athene: four top losers, and nowhere to put them even if the defence don't cash them right off|pg||
nt|athene: @H1097 lead more likely than @HK onside; maybe you rise ace here|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 17-19 3Hts|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he just decided that with everyone bidding, Robson had to have a light 2@C overcall, so 3@C wasn't going to hurt|pg||
nt|april7: after ace of@D E has a choice ow plays and might guess wrong, so E must help and lead @C after K of @H|pg||
nt|athene: a trump lead is possible, with declarer known to have three|pg||
nt|athene: trying just to stop a ruff in the closed hand|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|athene: but that sort of "trusting opponents" strategy can allow opps to talk you out of things|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jallerton: yes, any 11-13/17-19 bal or natural|pg||
nt|athene: of course it might find partner's @HQ :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: better to trust your partner|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|chthonic: Well on the way to nine tricks with straightforward play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: 1@D showed @Hs, 2@HS was 4 hearts and minimum -- well, S decided it was worth bidding 4|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jallerton: The @d play for 3 tricks anyway, so the lead did not give away the contract|pg||
nt|chthonic: but needed to play diamonds|pg||
nt|col3435: lack of entries to dummy gives you something to worry about|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: E guessed wron but still down because 9 and 10 of @D dont drop|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||

pc|c7|nt|athene: so well done|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petepunt: playing 1n as 17-19 means you can bid over 1@C on very min values safely|pg||

nt|athene: some might bid only 3@S with south over the double, but you don't really know what to do when they then bid 4@H|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: suggestion is its a shape showing bid |pg||

nt|marlowepi: hard to tell from W hand what the NT range is:)|pg||
nt|chthonic: Spade and a heart shift will set this, of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could be anything from 11-14 to 15-17|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|col3435: 14-16 I think (for both pairs)|pg||
nt|chthonic: And that seems likely|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jallerton: Do you agree with North's t/o double?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: but he was a bit unlucky his partner had such a great heart suit|pg||
nt|athene: and nothing at all wasted in spades|pg||

nt|athene: double is game-try (3@S would be merely competing)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|petepunt: non vul yes, but vul|pg||
nt|april7: the only way toplay 7@H is the ruffing finesse in @C and fortunate @H are 2-2. Hand much to strong for a 5@C opening.imo|pg||
nt|athene: north, unsurprisingly, doesn't accept the try|pg||
nt|chthonic: Or not|pg||

mb|4H|nt|athene: another good board for leading your own suit, NOT partner's|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jallerton: True, David, but North's double told him hearts were not breaking|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: interesting sequence here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: possible 5@C sacrifice EW, but you don't have to sacrifice if the opps don't bid game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and anyway not obvious how EW get in the bidding|pg||
nt|petepunt: its a perfect fit n/s |pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you want to play this hand in game? I suppose it's virtually cold if @s are 2-2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: three minor losers, and the hearts can be played either way |pg||
nt|petepunt: need to guess 1major suit right |pg||
nt|athene: 3@C was clearly intended as pre-emptive|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: west can put two spades through but it doesn't quite give east three trump tricks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: will silverstone hook the @S9 for the overtrick? :)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|jallerton: why do you have to guess @h?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: no, the third heart goes on a diamond |pg||
nt|athene: but i am not sure you can play that without a lot of artificial kit, because you need some way to make a real (invitational) 3@C bid|pg||
nt|col3435: South doesn't have much for his 4@d here|pg||

nt|chthonic: this will be bloody |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petepunt: y|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|april7: 2@C pass would have been enough, what was the 3@C bid for?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: that gains if someone has @D10xx left but the singleton diamond doesn't have the @H10|pg||

nt|marlowepi: winner at the 100-second trance. so if W emerges from said trance with 5C, you are b****red|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bothered|pg||
nt|lestergold: odd auction in closed Hacket opened east with a no trump presumably weak|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: is that odd?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Greenwood raised to game with only 9 points only explanation is that \Hackett was playing strong and upgraded|pg||

nt|chthonic: Ouch|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: North not happy!!!|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@S opener or 2NT?|pg||
nt|athene: double is a possible alternative for south|pg||
nt|athene: but he prefers to get the good suit in|pg||
nt|april7: 5@C or 3NT for the lucky position of the @D suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: No -4 agreed|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@S forcing, no major (X would be hearts; 1@H would be spades)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|col3435: there goes the lead, then|pg||
nt|chthonic: Rather a disastrous set|pg||
nt|col3435: that's a big advantage disappear in 5 boards|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petepunt: isnt 1n 17-19 ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d = no 5-card major, 1NT =17-19|pg||
nt|athene: many would overcall 2@D with north|pg||
nt|april7: EW has a partscore in @S and NS might try a @C partscore|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|athene: but robson is there for him!|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|april7: W will X and E will bid 2@S|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: no fears about re-opening|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not a big fan of 1NT, with only one spade stop|pg||
nt|athene: silverstone just needs to know if his partner has a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|athene: if he has, 6@C must be good|pg||
pc|cA|nt|col3435: so what does N have avaiable here? Is this showing short @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 3@S - singleton club 3 suit hand|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: In principle 44 Majors  but TF judged his hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: will worry @D may be 4-1|pg||
nt|jallerton: Declarer may try to lead a @s hoping 2nd hand has the ace, planning to switch to @d|pg||
nt|jallerton: though contuining @s OK if with @s 3-3 or guesses @h|pg||
nt|jallerton: Declarer does not know that @c are 4-4|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks like 7 tricks tho.|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you might bid 1nt to show values, but here, partner is never moving over it anyway, so you aren't getting to game|pg||
nt|april7: If N finds Q of @C, 7 tricks, if not....|pg||
nt|athene: so why not just bid 2@D?|pg||
nt|april7: should E have a singleton @D then 6 @C to be made|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure he has  achieved much by taking this very scenic route to 3nt|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petepunt: inersting tx|pg||
nt|athene: i don't have the NS system details; i assume north just asked for 5- and 4-card majors|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: he might duck this|pg||
nt|april7: down again on @S lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petepunt: or @Sare 4-2|pg||

mb|1C|nt|lestergold: i do not think 3N should be bid with a weak nt and 9 points opposite|pg||

nt|petepunt: its easier up here though!|pg||
nt|athene: if it's very close, you should perhaps go for the winning line because if you're wrong it's only one down|pg||
nt|chthonic: There is certainly no lack of courage in these players...... A real fight is going on|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|athene: but if you play the other way and it's wrong, you are two down|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: but it certainly wasn't easy|pg||
nt|athene: lightish 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 4@S By S to be made due to fall of JQ of @C, will they reach it?|pg||
nt|athene: will north go for 3nt, rather than 4@H, with a 4333?|pg||
nt|col3435: nasty spot for South here|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: as a feather|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|jallerton: 2@d shows 6!+ hearts?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: it might be hard to show the heart support AND suggest notrumps|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|col3435: transfer seems likely, given who South is|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, that was the explanation at the table|pg||
nt|april7: very aggressive X, EW have 3NT on a @H lead because of @H 4-4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ligtish 1@D, too|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: when you play against pairs who open 2+ 1@C you really need some good rules as to when your club bids are natural|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|athene: especially when 1@C might be only two cards in a balanced weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: south's double is 4+ spades i guess, and north's is exactly three spades|pg||
nt|athene: "serious 3nt" or something might get in the way|pg||
nt|athene: or 4@H of course :)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: an anti-restricted-choice hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jallerton: Is this really the right hand to pass it on though?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzaf: E asking N if S has atleast 1 @C, response is yes|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3n looks like it oculd have made ? in O/R|pg||
pc|d5|nt|april7: very lucky lead for S|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|petepunt: again nothing on for e/w |pg||
pc|h4|pc|c8|nt|petepunt: passnormally shows 6@D and weak|pg||
nt|col3435: Pass seems OK to me, you want to keep it low on the misfit (partner might be bidding again if you bid 2@h) and you're well placed if LHO does something|pg||
nt|col3435: but it's obviously a bit of a gamble still|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North probbaly happy to be playing in anything but hearts |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|april7: but who would think of @C on this bidding|pg||
nt|april7: S is not believing in his luck|pg||
nt|april7: S doesn't trust the @D 10 lead as top of sequence and K with E, E wouldn'*t lead @D now|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d7|nt|petepunt: not by W though|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: now a spade to the @S10, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: it's always a delicate business when you want to draw trumps but preserve a trump in dummy to control a weak suit|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|jallerton: Do you have any reason whatsoever to expect your @d to be better than partner's @h?|pg||
nt|april7: another tough decision|pg||
nt|athene: you might play the @HA now, on the basis that even if east does have @HQxx left, you have chances of getting the diamond away on a club|pg||
nt|april7: restricted choice :)|pg||

mb|2D|nt|athene: he doesn't know that EW aren't going to end up in spades|pg||
nt|april7: without a @C lead, perhaps Q of @H lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petepunt: 5@C sugested as more informative by S first time|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps thought that dummy was likely to have a trick source in clubs, in which case an aggressive lead was necessary|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: due to the 6card suit W might raies to 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: I agree.  South showed some restraint -- a good thing|pg||

nt|jallerton: A bit of waiting for Robson to finish too!|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: Thanks ably assisted by Stuart Bradnam|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might consider holding up the @CK and finessing diamonds into north - that would be right if north had the @HA |pg||
nt|athene: but when people respond 2@C to 1major, it's very often just a balanced hand|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|april7: E might duck @C and try to finesse @D the right way|pg||

nt|mdgraham: well judged by EW - 5@H is down one|pg||
nt|athene: i might have been a little bit worried with east - you do have a very pure hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: N/S likely to take out insurance in 6@D if Hackets bids one more .|pg||
nt|april7: is 1NT by E forcing, in what system?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 17-19|pg||
nt|april7: tu|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a huge fan of 1nt - the sixth heart is too important to bury|pg||
nt|athene: but anyway, they have wandered into game :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 2@C was two-way checkback (forces 2@D, then 2@S is invitational)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: NS never bid at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: exactly as explained|pg||
