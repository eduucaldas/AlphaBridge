mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well, adventurous contract, but|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he wont find the @D lead i guess|pg||
nt|rednaxela: 2NT suggest 15-17, which is a bit of an overstatement.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|wilkinsona: somewhat different auction to OR|pg||
nt|xenya: very different|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and north doubles for a club lead|pg||
nt|xenya: i wouldn't bid this hand like EW did|pg||
nt|mmmakela: will get 9 my bet|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but the contract is a make it seems...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: spades and clubs ideally for decl|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...has a chance...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona: declarer can keep norths clubs out of the picture |pg||
nt|xenya: 3N does look a stretch, and N's double is --er -- a bit optimistic|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: now just set up a spades for 9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: 3@S, 5@C 1@D and 1@H|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: he does have clubs but he doesn't have an entry|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3+2+3+1|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: K is +1, and declarer may think he needs that |pg||
nt|yo_yo: no, they get 4 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|rednaxela: 'Only' needs the Q@c dropping and Hearts 4-4 now.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|yo_yo: so much easier double dummy ....|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Indeed.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: we can see the cards, and south perhaps likely to have a singleton club after the x|pg||
nt|yo_yo: agree|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Mind you, he left himself with no entry for the Spade finesse.  Suppose North had covered the J@c?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 7@C?|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Ah, yes.  Still had a smaller pip.  Should have played the 8 or 9 under the Jack.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Gerald Tred working out the distribution|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks like a spade at trick 3, then|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: South deep in thought|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder what message @H 8  was?|pg||
nt|rednaxela: He may be wondering where declarer's high cards are for his 2NT.  Really needs a Diamond honour but wouldn't have played the suit that way if he had one.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bet @D 10 is coming|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: South's brow still furrowed|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Sime back in the lead.  5 imps on the previous board where 2@s went off against 1@s made at this table.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: couple os small swings put the Sime team back in front but that may be short lived..|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|ady: doubling 3 diamonds might cause damage in some cases if e/w play the hand  and north leads diamonds rather than a possible club|pg||

nt|mmmakela: if covers 7&8 guarantee a stopper|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not so easy to see where tricks come from here..|pg||
nt|xenya: playing a strong NT, EW would have probably landed in 2@S -- i wonder if that was available here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6@D?|pg||
nt|rednaxela: too high to make, I meant.  5@c was obviously a great save.|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: that pass by Bif...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...invites the wrong decision...|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Converting to 6@d gave E/W two more chances to go wrong at no extra cost!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Sanders is wondering what the pass meant|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if it gave him  a choice, he might go on|pg||
