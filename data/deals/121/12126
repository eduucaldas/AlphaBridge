nt|jallerton: Yes, and double is possible as well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Provided that you play Equal Level Conversion|pg||
nt|bobh1: opposite a passed hand less likely to be missing much|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You are not going to pass 3@C, are you?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Cold grand slam in clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: as grands go this looks straightforward to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The sharks at MP would bid 7NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: its harder to count tricks in these hand so these two suited grands are pretty hard to get to|pg||
nt|lestergold: simplw part score hand 2S N/S limit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: 2H e/wlimit|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jillm:   roland what is 2s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6+ clubs, 11-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: that actually makes it a lot easier|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: than a standard system|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they will have gadgets to cope|pg||
nt|jillm:  if north had opened a standard 1c east could have ocalled 1d and west could preempt and make things a little more difficult|pg||
nt|lml: it usually denies 4 card major in this type of system|pg||
nt|lml: but it doesnt say so on the card|pg||
nt|lml: you open 1@H and canape|pg||
nt|lml: if you had 34|pg||
nt|roswolf: i hope that the gadgets ARE there|pg||
nt|lml: if you had 4|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2@S denies a 4-card major i think - they open 1@H with 4 spades and have a special bid (2@H opener) for 4 hearts and long minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT relay, 3NT in theory a balanced maximum|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Max it is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe they count stiff ace as balanced|pg||
nt|lml: South has such a great hand here.  He needs to find out about hearts|pg||
nt|athene: the key is that both long suits are running|pg||
nt|roswolf: balanced is a slight stretch|pg||
nt|athene: south can rkcb in clubs and then perhaps spiral for the @HQ - but i am not sure you can get down to side queens|pg||
nt|lml: he may not have wanted to show a singleton ace|pg||
nt|athene: especially with clubs as trumps, you don't usually have enough room|pg||
nt|roswolf: le punt is likely too|pg||
nt|roswolf: the key is what 4@C is?|pg||
nt|lml: this is along the same paths as our system|pg||
nt|lml: 4@C here should be keycard|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3H off one a freasonable result for e/w|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: either 4@C or 4@D will be RKCB for clubs, i am sure|pg||
nt|lml: at least that is what I play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We had a very impressive auction from Sweden earlier today where Bertheau pinpointed a vital jack with Nystr√∂m. They then bid the making 7@D on  AQJxx  Kxx  as opposed to the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: failing 7@S   KQxxx  Axx|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jillm:  they may have a method of breaking the relay to ask for side suit queen (or third rd control), and if they don't South might take a chance|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: if rkcb south will still be wondering about the heart position|pg||
nt|athene: 2 keycards + @CQ|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|athene: ok, he doesn't look for the perfecto|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: very :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|bobh1: the 4@d bid was a better effort than 3@d in the other room but the same result|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 4@D would be conventional for E-W in the other room|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html  for standings after round 8 of 9 |pg||

nt|Walddk2: Interesting result from the CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like Allerton's 3NT opposite 12-14|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lml: that should be looking for a second round control though really|pg||
nt|Walddk2: at these colours|pg||
nt|roswolf: does have style|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of long suits around here but n/s likely to prevail in spade game|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup linda|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West passed? That's criminal NV v V in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillm:   maybe 3c means something other than what west has|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: so bid 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: unlikely to go 6 off though|pg||
pc|d6|nt|othered1: that's avery conservative 3@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not exactly insured by Lloyd's, but I won;t be doubling Mr. Bennet's 4S overcalls at these colors anytime soon|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: You can't pass and let the opponents have a free run|pg||
nt|athene: double from north now|pg||
nt|athene: maximum, short clubs|pg||
nt|athene: i would expect|pg||
nt|roswolf: murky auction time|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he wants exactly 44 majors for that, though|pg||
nt|lml: North only has a touch extra|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Marshall|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lml: I would pass as Garve did|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lml: I usually play that as about 11-14 but its not that much more|pg||
nt|jillm:   I would have bid 3c with west hand |pg||
nt|athene: much better played the other way up|pg||
nt|lml: even as the balance... yes|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lml: still they didn't go for -300|pg||
pc|d7|mc|10|nt|marlowepi: E opened 3D rather than more because with diamond ace there is a greater chance that 3N may make. with KQT he would have bid 4D or even 5D i reckon.|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Marshall!|pg||

nt|othered1: Of course, at these colors, partner will play you  for Qxxxxxx and won't bid game anyway.  If he does, you may have slam.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|lml: so 5 imps... earned at the other table though|pg||
nt|lml: North will bid something I think|pg||
nt|athene: 5@H is a lot to bid |pg||
nt|athene: especially with three small spades|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: he assumed his partner was short in spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H is natural in 3rd|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: 1h nat 3rd in hand|pg||
nt|lml: he just had to bid with a passing partner and this vul|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|lml: I knew he would|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C fit-showing jump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have reversed 1@H and 1@S, but only in 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|lml: tough call for West|pg||
nt|lml: pass seems right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you bid 1@S or double with East's cards?|pg||
nt|roswolf: should pass imo|pg||
nt|lml: I am a doubler|pg||
nt|lml: but I wont argue with 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S looks ok; you expect to double hearts later on if partner hasn't raised spades already|pg||
nt|jillm:  i bid 1s and then double next time|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|lml: he has quite a good hand|pg||
nt|lml: sometimes you are at the three level the next time around though|pg||
nt|athene: west's double should be a responsive double of hearts, i think|pg||
nt|athene: that's a good general agreement for use against all these artificial raises|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: of course, she might have had some other reason. but in the (unlikely) event that it were I who opened 3D, that would be my reason:)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: i use the subjunctive about 3 times a year|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north reasonably assuming that south has 5D these 4441 hands so awkward to bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and the subjective about 3 times per minute|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillm:  if I double I could be at 3 level next time around also, with my partner not having enough to bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: another principle situation where you need general agreements|pg||
nt|lml: well here you are he doubled in a millisecond|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i prefer a 1N rebid with south personally as the lesser evil|pg||
nt|othered1: many would choose to rebid 1N on south hand (if within range).  Matter of partnership preference.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jillm:  I do not like west's pass at all, he knows his partner is void|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is a re4asonable assumption, but still not a great bid. with opps quiet chances of short spades opposite are high, and with 3 weak trumps 3D is a lot to bid|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: in this situation though I am not sure it suggest 5-4-4|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they have penalised too early|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: I think East would double with a good hand and some support|pg||
nt|lml: but still he has to have a heart void|pg||
nt|jillm:  I think pass is such a losing bid, particularly at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: with diamonds as favourably placed as possible, this ugly contract may well limp in|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the fact that all it can do is limp in even with favorable lie of cards corroborates that 3D was an overbid|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: I blame south north had ten points and a reasonable expectation that south had 5 diamonds 2dims would have been an underbid on thier fairly naturl methods|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: 1N would be more attractive with a singleton queen or king. this hand, however, is all primes and to me it shrieks SUIT, so i agree with the approach taken by S|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: 4@S is a big bid though.  You don't have a great fit.  The @HA is wasted|pg||
nt|lml: maybe|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT perhaps, relying on that @H10|pg||
nt|athene: if you can stop south getting in...|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think 4@S was a great bid from one of the few lady players in this competition|pg||
nt|athene: taking the money looked reasonable with no game certain to make, or even reasonable sure|pg||
nt|jillm:  partner must have a very good hand at this vulnerability |pg||
pc|s9|nt|lml: that is one thing you can be sure of|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: I doubt whether N/S is a regular partnership|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, it is convenient to blame S for not bidding 1N on his hand because of what N held & what N did. but 1N could work out hideously also, and then maybe we would be blaming him ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for not rebidding the obvious 2C:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: i think N and S both had legitimate decisions to make. i support S more than N, but the judgment could easily go the other way|pg||
nt|lestergold: with 4/4/41 you hav a choice between two inaccurate rebids- i prefer the conservative 1N as at least you are point max and you do have the ace as a singleton|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: nicely timed here by declarer|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: in uk the 2c rebid defintitely implies 5D|pg||

nt|xenya: 2@D is an option. but maybe a bit wet -- 2@S does look a bit ugly, but at least it shows a decent suit and helps keep the bidding alive in case S has extras |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i am not a phonetic about sound overcalls:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Was not easy for Frances Hinden to switch to a club at trick 2 in the other room (heart lead). She went for a diamond, and then 4@S could no longer be defeated|pg||

nt|athene: true, that's another points :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: pity diamonds were trumps|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1@S  5+ hearts  11-15|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not to yours Marshall/|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C would be both majors 8-13 so if he shows spades it's a max|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hate 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: EW playing X as a 1@S overcall and 1NT as a t/o double of hearts, by the look of it|pg||

mb|1C|mb|d|mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: i actually prefer strong NT by a siugnioficant margin, but if i play weak NT i use it whenever possible. if it gets bad results, all the easier to convince partner to swtich to ...|pg||

mb|d|nt|roswolf: down the middle|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: flying hack time?|pg||
nt|othered1: 6 imps, the big swing of the match so far to Dhondy on Board 5, when east in OR chose to raise partner's suit with Axx, rather than rebidding a poor 6-card minor.  Imps earned to ...|pg||
nt|othered1: my eyes.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would open that S hand with a STRONG NT in 3rd seat at these colors|pg||
nt|lestergold: weak no trump is  rabbiot killing weapon but its fundamentally unsound against top opposition|pg||
nt|othered1: I disagree completely.   Weak NT serves a similar purpose to Polish @C, in limiting distribution on weak openers.  There's much more to the bid's efficacy than just preempting.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: i think west is just about worth 2@S - passing first time over 2@H in other room was a little bit wet|pg||
nt|lml: I think he bid 4@H with the intent of doubling 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: club lead|pg||
nt|athene: play partner for the @HA, i suppose|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They can tap this to pieces. I don't think a club lead is good|pg||
nt|athene: yes you are right|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|athene: it looks pretty likely that spades are precisely 4-4-4-1 round the table|pg||
nt|roswolf: -2 if declarer is lucky|pg||
nt|athene: so Garvey can force, hold up ace of trumps and continue the force|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just tap dummy|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|athene: north's @S9 is starting to wake up now|pg||
nt|athene: not to mention the fact that he has four trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perfect defence. "When you have trump length, lead your longer side suit". Good rule of thumb|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: lucky not to be doubled|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: both have contributed to teh debacle|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 7 losing trick count & already overstated the hand and the club suit with the free 2C bid|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: i agree south gross overboard pard didnt redouble so how can south see game values here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no upside in the 2C bid as it does not take any spoace away and the O/D ratio is not very high|pg||

nt|athene: in situations like that you have to go back over the play mentally and remember all the spot cards played by the defence early on|pg||
nt|lml: its one of those you think about after the match and try to figure out what you should have done (not double dummy) but generally|pg||
nt|athene: almost always they give you the key to the distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: light weak 2|pg||
nt|jillm:  by his thinking it seems like north is trying to figure that out now |pg||
nt|Walddk2: So take your time and ask yourself some questions. There is no prize for finishing first|pg||
nt|lml: well he actually does have a heart suit|pg||
nt|lml: it seems normal to me at this vul|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like the pace at this table, but Garvey surely played too fast on 11|pg||
nt|jillm:  and it is very hard to go on to the next board when you do that, very hard to let it go|pg||
nt|athene: playing fast can induce the defenders into hasty innacuracies|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: and yourself|pg||
nt|athene: if you think you can speed the whole table up and it will benefit you more, you do it, surely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: which was what happened when he tried to cash @S10 which he should know would not stand up|pg||
nt|jillm:  grant baze was the master of that, and barry crane|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room west tried 3@H which wasnt a success|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is easier to let that board go for Garvey.  He has been having a good session|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: or 5 down|pg||
nt|athene: declarer going all out to take the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The heart suit is dead now|pg||
nt|lml: North has 2 heart tricks now|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think -5 is deserved here|pg||
nt|athene: north doesn't know that his partner has a second heart|pg||
nt|lml: if NOrth wins and plays clubs it could be worse|pg||
nt|jillm:  down more if North takes ace and shifts to club after running spades|pg||
nt|athene: he looks a bit silly if he captures this and east actually started with @HQ10x|pg||
nt|lml: can East really have that and play in notrump?|pg||

nt|lml: yeppers|pg||
nt|athene: well, peoplehave been known to play in 3nt with 4-card support for a weak 2|pg||
nt|lml: still when you are looking at down 2 maybe you should just take it|pg||
nt|roswolf: EAST CLEARLY HAS A DOUBLETON|pg||
nt|lml: down 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry to shout|pg||
nt|lml: I like beating non vul undoubled contracts without worrying too much about undertricks|pg||
nt|lml: North has to be very sure after all East can have anything|pg||
nt|athene: as far as the score goes, an extra 50 or two isn't so important, true|pg||
nt|athene: but psychologically, if you take the absolute maximum every time, on defence|pg||
nt|jillm:    east should have more than he does|pg||

nt|marlowepi: tempo in the bidding is so important. suppose S passes (more or less normal) instead of doubling. then NS are likely to buy it at 2S and may make|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: if you take them three down, not two down, and four down, not three down, ever single time|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: sometimes you get 5 down when you were trying to take 1 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Conclusion. N-S make 3NT. They should have bid, vulnerable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cooke's pause worries me|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's @S10 was a nice play|pg||
nt|roswolf: clearly south has his doubts too|pg||
nt|lml: on the positive side declarer is pretty well going at least 2 down no matter what|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe @S9 would have been a better choice as North's return|pg||
nt|athene: but the play in hearts must have some significance|pg||
nt|athene: surely north would hold up his @HA if there was any danger|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|hawe45:  Interesting situation - what is Souths holding, when he - after 1 minute - takes the @D K?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: hmm imo south is asleep but gets it right on waking|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now the question is which minor Garvey will switch to|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|roswolf: ah north failed to find the club switch|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cT|mc|9|nt|roswolf: ok -4 will do|pg||
nt|vugraph814: thats end of this set, we shall start in 5 minutes or less|pg||
nt|othered1: thanks all and see you shortly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: see you soon|pg||
