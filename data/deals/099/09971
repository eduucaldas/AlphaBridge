mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: real key from Sasha's point of view is the @D suit|pg||

nt|daman: missed a big chance to put the opps away|pg||
nt|daman: if they bid the grand in the CR     watch out|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: 13 tricks not certain -- need good things to happen in a red suit|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and guess which good thing happened :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so for the puritans, just a question of whether 6@S arrived at convincingly or not -- which gets an extra 5 points :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al no style points?|pg||
nt|daman: my guess is if you were in 7 and had to play it wide open?  you would end up making on a high crossruff after pitching @Ds on the @Hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a sure line for 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well most lines work|pg||
nt|daman: and ruffing @Cs along the way    East cannot get out of her own way on the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure george -- that seems to rely upon @H 33  surely better to try @D first|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|c5|pc|h8|pg||
