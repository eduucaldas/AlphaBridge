mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|buffytvs: that makes me feel better -- I was thinking it was me :)|pg||
nt|daman: 4 @H will be the likely contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C down, i dont see a possiblity to play the reduction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: of course if lead @S, otherwise also 5@C made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curious that the 9 card fit missing only Q has 2 losers, but 8 card fit missing QJ has only 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very strange deities our gods of probability|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: I'm sure Rosie has visions , but Stasha will not cooperate :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: we believe mancuso is still up by 3 imps with a very long way to go|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not mutually exclusive Ray|pg||
nt|bridge_one: everyone would choise 2@H instead 3@c here ? i amn't sure about this hand - very difficult|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: from what i've seen this week, Stasha tendency between less optimistic => pessimistic|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: oops|pg||
nt|jstokes: i'm not sure about 3@C; suggests short spades to me|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C by South A in @c (by North, having the K)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: we have a rule in New York not to put down 8 cards suits in dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow - 4@H   laying down 8 bagger as dummy is RIGHT |pg||
nt|daman: only because you have to move the board to lay them out :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be a misunderstand, or also a natural bid (don't having Aces) giving the best information to play slam or not - this is true only if they play 2@D or 3@C forcing game|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: unless they are trumps say the kibitzers :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: can we try that auction again, vugraph?|pg||
nt|cbernstn: did east bid 5@C?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: seems the most likely explanation -- they avoided 3Nt after South doubled for th diamond lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but 5@C has no play|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more play for EW than NS :)|pg||
nt|pef: I'd find east bidding 5c pretty surprising, would be more likely to look for a 43 major fit|pg||
nt|buffytvs: for sure :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right peter -- 2 Moysians to explore before picking @C|pg||
nt|buffytvs: actually they might make 4@H|pg||
nt|rcm: this auction seems very strange|pg||
nt|cbernstn: 3NT down in other room, where 3NT was the contract on the first 3 boards|pg||
nt|pef: well looks like the final contract was 5c down 1 which actually gained 3 imps vs 3nt down 2 in the close room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein DBL of 3@S gave Wittes an option she probably wouldn't have taken otherwise|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can lose the ruff in @S bec is the natural trump trik  for North - but need to play A - now North can make 2 ruff|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i think 2@D big winner in the long run -- 2@S caters to such a small window of hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jumping back to last hand -- it's been pointed out to me that hand should make after @S at trick 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: ruffing with the 8 of diamonds by quinn may have cost a trick because now declarer had two entires to lead toward the spades|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in 5@C  ruff 3rd spade, use @D to dummy to ruff @D, use @H to ruff again -- now trump endplay|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i may have missed one reduction play - and cask 2nd @H but you get the picture|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: works only because West @S return lets her start reduction|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jstokes: needs one less ruff than one might think, because the trump endplay substitutes for the usual coup at the end|pg||

nt|buffytvs: lol -- North is endplayed already|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: examining the convention cards for this event, a surpisingly small number of pairs play Puppet Stayman over 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting choice of 4th best|pg||

nt|ahollan1: of course - nothing would have worked|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pef: not sure if I believe the q of diamonds was actually played, but even it if wasn't, shawn was going to make the contract, win a club in dummy cash the 10 of spades, squeezing north|pg||

nt|daman: eventually perhaps|pg||
nt|jstokes: with clubs not breaking it does|pg||

nt|buffytvs: I suspect we have the auction on 41 and the cards from 40 here|pg||
nt|pef: this is obviously the board from last round|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: more than just good, I would say, nearly 100% for a small slam, pretty much exactly 50% for a grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Quinn overcalled 1@S as South and pushed her opps to 3@C|pg||
nt|daman: in the OR|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: the 9 of @h made it on the last hand - nice try by Cohen|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jstokes: pushed west to make an unusual 2@C raise on 3, which worked out well|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: now 4@D shortness or 4@S mild slam try |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: 4@S is slam try because 2N-4@H is Texas Transfer to 4@S with no slam interest|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|pef: if this really was the auction I'm very surprised|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h8|nt|buffytvs: well, the play won't take long :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly -- must either super accept or go after invited|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cbernstn: I think N might have moved over 3@H|pg||
nt|pef: in that 3nt shawn quinn made a few boards ago, they did go down in the open room,  declarer didn't time the play nearly as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cindy - do you have a preference of type of super accept?|pg||
nt|pef: so far this is looking to be a very good set for the mancuso team|pg||
nt|cbernstn: I might have bid 3NT with North hand over 3@H|pg||
nt|pef: there are lots of possible ways to play the superaccept.  some would say jumping to 4s is limited with 4 good spades and you cuebid with a really good hand.  others might say you ...|pg||
nt|pef: will have so much to cuebid that cuebids show limited, but good values, and bidding 4s is a really strong hand in controls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm i thought 3N often covers unusual shape WITHOUT @S|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Linda and I play step response superaccepts, showing trump quality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so thinking 4@C as either source of tricks or just cue bid|pg||
nt|pef: another topic even a lot of experienced partnerships don't discuss enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tell us more Ray|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I'm trying to remember LOL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|buffytvs: iirc, 1st step superaccept is 3 trumps with a ruffing value, next is 4 trumps, top is 4 trumps to a top honour -- 3NT is 4trumps but 4333|pg||

nt|ahollan1: major  c) you must define whether opener allowed to rebid 1N holding 4@H or 4@S|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: what a difference @DJ or 10 would make in West hand|pg||

nt|buffytvs: declarer may not feel that good about playing West for @cA|pg||
nt|pef: on the board we talked about both north and south stretching to bid 2h and 3h, mancuso gained 5 imps because north did not overcall 2h, instead balanced later, so they played in ...|pg||

nt|buffytvs: the dbl is 4M + longer minor or diamonds -- in this case she has both|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL =  a) 4@H/@S & 5+@C/@D  b) @H 1-suit  c) STR @H & @S  d) STR @S 1-suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|pef: north/south have an excellent 4h contract|pg||

nt|cbernstn: Dbl shows 4-card major & 5-minor|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl again|pg||
mb|p|nt|cbernstn: OR just hearts|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bridge_one: bat also pass :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|buffytvs: or a really big hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: or diamonds|pg||
nt|pef: e/w also in 3nt on board 46 so possible the shutout will continue|pg||
nt|buffytvs: lot of hand types|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right or @D|pg||
nt|pef: what do you guys think, assuming the double of 2h showed heart cards, wouldn't you bid 4h on the south hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so nobody knows until the end :)|pg||
nt|pef: the cards you need to be onside all rate to be so|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I think DBL probably says -- let's defend if you have @H -- but don't think it SHOWS @H length|pg||
nt|pef: I mean if partner has as llittle as xxx qjxxx xx xxx aren't you willing to be in game?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: agree -- depends on what the dbl means|pg||
nt|cbernstn: Since South could have hand types that don't include hearts, N must have good hearts, I would think.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 3@H probably the @H + minor type -- single suit @H would bid 4@H|pg||
nt|cbernstn: Warranting a game bid by South.|pg||
nt|pef: we are all speculating, obviously, but I agree with what cindy just said|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Rozie knows pard has zilch - so pass good|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in open room South Dbl again over 2@h|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but pass is ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without J   zilch would be drek|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|buffytvs: most of time South will have hearts for the dbl|pg||
nt|pef: seems much more useful over the 2h transfer for double to show hearts (and ask for a heart lead).  if that's true, bidding only 3h seems rather timid|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: i'm not convinced -- i think it is like many pass/correct situations|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: so can't make pure penalty double ever|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|tlc: seems like all roads lead to +140 and a 1 IMP pickup for Mancuso here...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|bridge_one: yes - however would need to play @h from dummy after the dbl|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|tlc: well 170 now...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pef: but with just values, wouldn't it make more sense to pass the transfer and then double if it went 2s pp?|pg||
nt|pef: very unlikely to have a pure penalty double of spades|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 2 imp|pg||
pc|h8|nt|buffytvs: Isn't 3@H forward-going?  If she passes 2@S she'll now be known to have one of the heart hands anyway...|pg||
nt|daman: the last 32 board should be exciting|pg||
mc|10|nt|pef: yeah, but you'd bid that missing the q of diamonds or with only 5 diamonds, big diffrerence|pg||
