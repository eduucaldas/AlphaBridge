pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: and NS have duly arrived at it|pg||
nt|milton_se: In fact, 9 tricks seem easy for the defense|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: as the cards lie there's no problem|pg||

nt|kapitanski: hello Silvia  Hello Roland|pg||
nt|snorris: nt ??|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|milton_se: Will N/S find the 3NT game?|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: this looks like a makeable 3NT contract|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: if S invites now I think N will accept|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|milton_se: what range is 1NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: well wrong prediction (as usual)|pg||
nt|charles_l: 2@d must show 6 so W has an easy pass|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: S decided to bid game because of the vulnerability I suppose|pg||
pc|s6|nt|snorris: well at least he has yhe king singelton|pg||
nt|milton_se: OK, there it is. Requires only a D finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: he should play the @D right I think|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: I mean he should guess them right|pg||
nt|milton_se: that's the odds-on plat|pg||
nt|milton_se: play|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: that's true|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kapitanski: will have the pleasure to watch the best pair-s and the best team-s  in  BUlgaria|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kapitanski: marashev-conchev  bronze medals euro champ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|milton_se: oops -- Cs can't give 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: S was somewhat stuck for a lead, and the @SQ turns out to be very helpful for declarer|pg||
nt|charles_l: normal if unfortunate lead|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|kapitanski: karakolev-danailov   last yar   national team  Bg  and  champions  many times|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|charles_l: everytime i lead from QJ dummy has the 10|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|xenya: same with me|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: now he has to get @Cs right|pg||
nt|xenya: i think he will|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody|pg||
nt|snorris: hi Ed|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: J is always a losing play unless S has AK or N has no @Hs now , which is unlikely|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sT|nt|othered1: Hi, Snorri|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphb1: wlc, Ed|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, but still an inferior line|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d6|pc|h9|nt|vugraphb1: he could have made it if he had play K of @H |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|charles_l: S would lead from @cAK |pg||

nt|yo_yo: hello from Manchester|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would seem to be a flat board, but who can tell after the last set?|pg||
nt|haans: question was 4@D a good bid???????|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: I'm not sure why S bid 2@C|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bt: on board 14 ew got involved and helped ns bid the difficult to bid game|pg||
nt|milton_se: 1S would have forced Arne to pass -- not showing real Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: Feels like this start means that Frirond won't compete...|pg||
nt|haans: enter with 2@D penalised?|pg||
nt|milton_se: 5NT should be this, I think: all 1st controls|pg||
nt|magnus_e: 6@h from north|pg||
nt|diaoff: Hans-Ove and Everfresh both on 151 now|pg||
mb|1D|nt|brolucius: I was just thinking to myself that 40 years ago some players would have responded 3NT...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that seems a good description of North's hand|pg||
nt|diaoff: Might end up too high in @H here|pg||
nt|wygbe1: rehi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: ...or have they also started to apply the modern pick-a-slam conv? :)|pg||
nt|vugraph815: That's what East thougt while Weat interpreted it as asking about trumphonours and that he needed three to bid the grand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bjurn: apparently neither did he :)|pg||
nt|haans: not as per cc|pg||
nt|milton_se: ... not easy to take back 20 imps from Berik|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: yes a good old fashioned bid|pg||
nt|papa hall: For those of you not familiar with Swedish geography....2@H is called Askeröd...named after a little town in southern Sweden|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many time a overcall at level 1 is more effective that a preemptive at 3 level|pg||
nt|bt: 2N was conservative?|pg||
nt|magnus_e: on board 14 Törnqvist in other room showed 13+ with norhs hand. It led to 4@s. Good evaluation. |pg||
nt|diaoff: Never argue with success, and the zones were in favour|pg||
nt|vugraph815: I think you could set it for 800, so... no :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|magnus_e: 3@h extras i suppose?|pg||
nt|diaoff: will stop in 5 now I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: South didnt think north could have the @H suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: West has read the text-books 'Only weak players lead from a jack', but he held all the jacks.|pg||
nt|diaoff: Or not...|pg||
nt|haans: we will soon find the answer to that question|pg||
nt|vugraph815: But sure, partner could have had an extra @D and then it would have been a good sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|haans: 4@S preemtive???|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: EW didnt end up too high, NS did. :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: im all for passing 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraph815: And by consuming a lot of space you make it easier for them to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|diaoff: will also lead hearts the safe way making 5|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt with 19 isn't standard, overall with 5 closed suit|pg||
nt|haans: yes they did not find their @C|pg||
nt|vugraph815: So all in all, I think it's an acceptable choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: Not always good to win the auction :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|diaoff: Now he will not score any @D tricks|pg||
nt|vugraph815: Even with this extremely favorable @H-layout, declarer only has 7 tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|haans: yes we all have been there :)|pg||
nt|bjurn: generally the double is a good indication |pg||
nt|milton_se: probably meant so -- lucky break though|pg||
pc|d5|nt|po-s: make?|pg||
nt|diaoff: oops you are right po, now there is trouble|pg||
nt|magnus_e: yes, ruff @s then trumphs|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: true spoken|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bjurn: this wont be too expensive thou|pg||
nt|haans: extra spade trick?|pg||
nt|diaoff: 33 in @S will save him, y|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: he'll still make q@C|pg||
nt|vugraph815: Pia thinks....|pg||
nt|haans: double on @Hxxx|pg||
nt|po-s: but now trump|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|diaoff: It was -500 until now|pg||
nt|bt: opps competing to 3@H wasnt bad either ...|pg||
nt|vugraph815: Well, it's your job to analyze, not mine :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: u welcomed grönkvist|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|milton_se: not making, because 9S will be promoted|pg||
nt|haans: and clubs ruff with @STen|pg||
nt|milton_se: meant not making a peaceful -100|pg||
nt|magnus_e: heart back!|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|milton_se: also 5-4 in unbid suits would indicate X|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bridge_one: however need to see how effective is the use of 2Major opening with 10/12 - many great pair use this system today|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|arvid: Why didnt East bid 2@S?|pg||
nt|milton_se: still in chock?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|po-s: sloppy play|pg||
nt|diaoff: many are tired now, apparently|pg||
nt|milton_se: did Arne miss that?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|magnus_e: playing too fast|pg||
nt|po-s: Declarer could have just ruffed a spade either directly after HA or after two high hearts|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bt: i think north severly undervalued his hand here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wygbe1: oops|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s5|nt|milton_se: oops|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|haans: well still down|pg||
