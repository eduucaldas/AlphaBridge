nt|nigel_k:  I'm not so sure it is too weak to reverse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Clubs they killed in the 50's, diamonds in the 60's, and hearts have been forgotten|pg||
nt|pelu: just use finger-signals for count :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We only have spades and NT left|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: that is because of an unnecessay bid  of 3C by E|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  East was too quick to set spades as trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My point above|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Clear double|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: if partner does not bid hearts, then go back to spades|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@C is unilateral|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rnmalik: with so many Cs no|pg||

mb|p|nt|kastan88: again slamish hand, and all are running on EW-line, this time 2 aces off|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I also think the West hand is too good for the jump to 4S|pg||
nt|pelu: again:) 2 Aces off|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 3@C was just invitational or better, Nigel. If so, West had to jump to game to show extras|pg||

nt|mariner1: Closed Room|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: if slow auction from Rozanne was invite, then 3N probably the most costly bid|pg||
nt|daman: unfortunately the Moss team is running out of time   7 boards to accumulate 45 IMPs     tall order|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well we can't say there haven't been enough slams this set|pg||
nt|daman: they had their chances|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|onebid: RKC should end the suspense|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@C good call|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it is amazing that they even played this set -- after first 3 sessions it would have been very easy to give up|pg||
mb|2C|nt|onebid: I totatally disagree - when I have 4 card support, I tell partner the good news right away!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right key feature is source of tricks NOT the singleton @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: will the 2@S jam them out of slam, or help|pg||
nt|onebid: hmmm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sounds like Judy does not have agreement that some have where immediate splinter guarantees an honor in all unbid suits|pg||
nt|onebid: I bid 2NT right away - not splinter|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Closed Room EW never bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: ahhh   i can live with 2N|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like Migry's style, she does not sit on her hands...........|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but abhor splinter|pg||
mb|3D|nt|onebid: would anyone else bid 2@S?|pg||
nt|mariner1: if you sit on your hands you lose a lot of matches,,,,,,,,,, and have flat|pg||
nt|mariner1: hands..........|pg||
nt|mariner1: Migry is after a swing|pg||
nt|onebid: or flat... never mind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in this situation -- i like -- don't think i'd always do it|pg||
nt|onebid: instead of 4@H, how about 4@D now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: writing by Cohen|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hmm 4@H as picture bid?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: 4@D after partner's natural 3@D sounds like a @D fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 2@S serves a purpose   it gums up the auction and it might allow you and your partner to find a useful sacrifice if you have a fit   on the other hand, you could easily go for a ...|pg||

nt|onebid: 3@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@S seems too ambiguous -- about @S holding, and which red suit supported|pg||
nt|onebid: both black?|pg||
nt|onebid: round is clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: I meant minor kings........ eyes spinning today|pg||
nt|onebid: mine too Rob:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: since 3@H forcing, i would assume 3@S=@D|pg||
nt|onebid: not on Stasha's auction certainly - but on mine:)|pg||
