nt|fabsayc: at least for blackwood purposes, 4NT would agree spades|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|othered1: And unluckily, but 6@C and 6!N are so superior to 6@S, not terribly unluckily|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Nicely done|pg||

mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Operator?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: it looks to me as if you can come to 6 tricks on any defense, maybe 7|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Add 3 IMPs to the Mancuso score. The result here was 5@SX-3 on board 100 = 800|pg||

nt|Vugraphu5: the contract is 4s in W|pg||

nt|Vugraphu5: I am in sync now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed you are :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The N-S hands fit very well|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|1N|nt|othered1: getting to game isn't trivial here|pg||
nt|raghavan: difficult to reach 4H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks nearly impossible actually|pg||
nt|kit: and even more difficult now|pg||
nt|chip: yes, particularly if N devalues the diamond king, and the known offside heart honor(s)|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Migry trying hard|pg||
nt|kit: if this is a mixed raise with 4 trumps, South just could go|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@D a mixed raise or more invitational?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chip: In this auction, I think mixed is pretty invitational (since 3H would suggest a decent hand vul over 1N).|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: is game really makeable on a trump lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: we'll find out maybe|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe we'll find out :)\|pg||
nt|chip: On a trump lead, need to finesse the diamond 10 to make it, and not going to happen in 3.|pg||
nt|raghavan: where will the losers go if Trump is lead|pg||
nt|kit: would need to set up long club and get there|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|othered1: you can now avoid quick @S loser|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|kit: have 5 trump tricks, 2 diamonds, 1 spade, 1 club |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now SQ?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|chip: You can take more trump tricks than that, since if you finesse the diamond 10, W never gets in to lead more trumps.|pg||
nt|othered1: but she can win, @C to dummy, and hook @D|pg||
nt|kit: if take diamond finesse, and pitch spade on diamond, that seems to work|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a massive board for Mancuso, but Moss still has a chance on board 112. If they will be allowed to play in 4@S. North did not bid at the other table|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|d6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|othered1: overtake let her get more trumps in at cost of extra @S trick NS|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|chip: good play by West, but won't be good enough since now the spade 9 comes into play.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|chip: E needed to lead a low spade.|pg||
nt|othered1: right|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
mc|9|nt|othered1: nicely done for the overtrick, but they are only in 3|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: claim as 4|pg||
nt|kit: didn't she make 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|kit: there is an imp riding|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no kit|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes made 4|pg||
nt|chip: looked like it to me, and makes an IMP difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So overwrite in MOVIE along board 109      3HS+1|pg||
