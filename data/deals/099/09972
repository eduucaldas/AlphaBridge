mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: now S has to sort of guess about N's @S quality|pg||

pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: 13 tricks not certain -- need good things to happen in a red suit|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so for the puritans, just a question of whether 6@S arrived at convincingly or not -- which gets an extra 5 points :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al no style points?|pg||
nt|daman: my guess is if you were in 7 and had to play it wide open?  you would end up making on a high crossruff after pitching @Ds on the @Hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a sure line for 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well most lines work|pg||
nt|daman: and ruffing @Cs along the way    East cannot get out of her own way on the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure george -- that seems to rely upon @H 33  surely better to try @D first|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: I knew Cansino as convention over opp 1N -- didn't know there was another meaning|pg||

nt|mariner1: same, add points and spades to get to 15 to open|pg||
nt|mariner1: so  a support REDBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Rob phrase better -- note to make, since Support DBL/RDBL originally invented for use in context of Strong Club system - some 2/1 players play support DBL but NOT support ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the idea is that in context of big club - opener never holds strong hand, but in 2/1 maybe big hand|pg||
