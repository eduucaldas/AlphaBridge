pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: 13 tricks not certain -- need good things to happen in a red suit|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and guess which good thing happened :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so for the puritans, just a question of whether 6@S arrived at convincingly or not -- which gets an extra 5 points :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al no style points?|pg||
nt|daman: my guess is if you were in 7 and had to play it wide open?  you would end up making on a high crossruff after pitching @Ds on the @Hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a sure line for 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well most lines work|pg||
nt|daman: and ruffing @Cs along the way    East cannot get out of her own way on the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure george -- that seems to rely upon @H 33  surely better to try @D first|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in encyclopedia this is also called Rule of 15  [which has 2nd definition that covers a lead convention]|pg||

nt|mariner1: same, add points and spades to get to 15 to open|pg||
nt|mariner1: so  a support REDBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Rob phrase better -- note to make, since Support DBL/RDBL originally invented for use in context of Strong Club system - some 2/1 players play support DBL but NOT support ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 83 Moss gained 10 back as the @S game was not found|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mariner1: I was thinking they might find the A@C lead to beat 4....... no chance though on 83|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the idea is that in context of big club - opener never holds strong hand, but in 2/1 maybe big hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: S in a fix here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cohen not opening has really made things difficult for Pollack|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: players closing eyes resting, while she thinks|pg||
