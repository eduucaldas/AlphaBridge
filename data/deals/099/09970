nt|bt: i was away at the bank, lol|pg||
nt|bt: so a possible good result for skalman, but likelier a push|pg||
nt|diaoff: could have made an overtrick forcing the @Cs there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|brolucius: Still 9 IMPs, with two boards (and four comparisons) to go.|pg||
nt|magnus_e: well south had 7@c - Larsson couldn´t actually see that|pg||
nt|po-s: bidding may be different|pg||
mb|d|nt|diaoff: One more standard 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: in poland they play x of 1@C as me 2|pg||
nt|milton_se: not unreasonable 4S but not making|pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: let them x|pg||
mb|d|nt|bt: if south had 6 clubs, the contract was cold|pg||
nt|haans: next deal please|pg||
nt|milton_se: side Ds?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraph815: Only spade contract here|pg||
nt|diaoff: Hard choice for S|pg||
nt|diaoff: This is not the kind of boards that Skalman needs|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: funny, he passed a slightly better hand on board 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|magnus_e: what an ugly bid : 3@s|pg||
nt|bt: in a natural system the west hand here must be very close to a negative double|pg||
nt|bt: i could use other words also|pg||
nt|haans: yes so he is no pole|pg||
nt|haans: looking at @D thinking 'what if ...'|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some work to do here. I wonder if he can manage it.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it makes seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|brolucius: He has to avoid a club loser.|pg||
nt|haans: pass = transfer|pg||
nt|bjurn: with nothing to protect Cilla (E) allows Pia (W) to hog the contracts|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: it seems natural to go over to dummy and finesse @C|pg||
pc|dA|nt|milton_se: would probably do the same, but X would be right this time|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||

pc|s8|pg||

nt|Walddk6: This is the last board of the match. Many thanks again to Martin Stoszek, our very capable operator in Bonn. Well done!|pg||
nt|diaoff: A trumph switch in trick two would have held it to ten tricks, once again|pg||
nt|bt: so we all disagreed on the bidding there|pg||
nt|papa hall: Argentine? Are you drinking Lars?|pg||
nt|bt: i wish|pg||
nt|vugraph815: Declarer got a trick on the @H10|pg||
nt|vugraph815: That's why he made 8|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: Yes, Martin has been great.|pg||
nt|bt: so no the 2+@C might bite ew ...|pg||
nt|bt: now|pg||
nt|haans: 6@C?|pg||
nt|vugraph815: The players are starting to look tired|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraph815: In my stupidity I thought it was impossible to present with any more tricks...|pg||
nt|vugraph815: any more tricks to him even|pg||
nt|haans: in bridge all is possible|pg||
nt|milton_se: Brunzell-Nielsen went down in the grand|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk6: Also thanks to our excellent commentators: Kath Nelson and David Bird|pg||
nt|bjurn: 2@D is natural with either 6+@D or 5+@D with 4+@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S ON for N/S|pg||
nt|diaoff: Looks good until you see the NS hands...|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: no, KD|pg||
nt|haans: EW play häxan |pg||
nt|magnus_e: 4@h will go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: tough to bid now though|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and 5@C for E/W|pg||
nt|milton_se: not easy to find now|pg||
nt|bt: should be easier|pg||
nt|papa hall: with some very, very good guessing, maybe|pg||
nt|vugraph815: Good preempt by West, kept them out of the cold slam|pg||
nt|milton_se: but ruffing first D high|pg||
nt|haans: forcing|pg||
nt|magnus_e: could they stop in time?|pg||
nt|diaoff: I doubt|pg||
nt|magnus_e: maybe now, 4@h with Larsson´s D|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: better pass at 4@C :)|pg||
nt|papa hall: Now cI don't think 4@S will be an issue any more|pg||
nt|arvid: 7@C is a good contract|pg||
nt|diaoff: Absoloutely|pg||
nt|milton_se: excellent 6C if not S lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|magnus_e: I will bid 1S with norths hand|pg||
nt|bt: i a conservative old man, but isnt north close to bididng 1@S here?|pg||
nt|milton_se: sorry 7C|pg||
nt|haans: good or bad|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D GF if good|pg||
nt|milton_se: normally, staying below 4H would be disgraceful|pg||
nt|magnus_e: 2@h from N. Is it forcing?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|diaoff: No problem, any lead|pg||
nt|arvid: The problem is the bidding|pg||
nt|diaoff: True :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, missed one M trick|pg||
nt|diaoff: Maybe an old-fashioned jump-shift to 3@C would hhave made life easier|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bt: great minds think alike|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Peterson passed, but much better bid 1@S|pg||
nt|milton_se: you see that as old-fashioned?|pg||
nt|haans: good so GF|pg||
nt|magnus_e: that was a sucess for the double of 1@s :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bt: ruff spade. lead a heart|pg||
nt|milton_se: no, sir, we old men bid 1S|pg||
nt|haans: häxan and gazzilli are the same convention|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk6: Finally, our appreciation to the DBV (German Bridge Federation) for bringing this prestigious event to BBO vugraph. Josef Harsanyi, Matthias Schüller and Peter Eidt have been ...|pg||
nt|Walddk6: instrumental in setting up a great show|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good old checkback 2@C i assume|pg||
nt|milton_se: serious mistake, I'd say|pg||
nt|haans: agree ruff were needed start low|pg||
nt|haans: (i know this game :))|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bt: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|diaoff: Many do, but I still play so...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|diaoff: That was lucky!|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: The club position is unfavourable.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: A club lead would kill the game before it had a chance. He has led a club.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a rotten lead for the Estonians |pg||
nt|milton_se: me too, but only 1-suited as this|pg||
nt|milton_se: easy enough then 1H - 3C - 4D...|pg||
nt|milton_se: well on their way now|pg||
nt|diaoff: ..but will also go down|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|milton_se: good bid!|pg||
nt|diaoff: A kibitzer suggest 5@D exclusion BW over 3@C, but this will also work I guess|pg||
nt|milton_se: can you be sure that 3C promises this suit?|pg||
nt|diaoff: No, that is the problem|pg||
nt|milton_se: Berik is 24 VPs up for the championship now|pg||
nt|milton_se: sure, D shift and Cs|pg||
pc|dT|nt|magnus_e: nice play|pg||
nt|papa hall: Arne must be getting old...that was his longest thinking pause ever|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good line by declarer|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d3|nt|diaoff: Strange, shouldn't 5NT ask for two honnors?|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|diaoff: I think 3NT is the only game making - impossible to reach though, especially at this table :)|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: take out double better than bidding suit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|milton_se: we both do -- at least in theory :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: Playing a different NT range, South would open 1NT and play the contract after a transfer response.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: when i lead a doubleton my partner never has AQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Never? That's unlucky.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe it just seems that way :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: very good slam, but not much room to find it|pg||
pc|c6|nt|milton_se: 4H would be more hoorable :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brolucius: Keep playing and one day...|pg||
nt|haans: they were not prepared|pg||
nt|bjurn: I'm not sure why W didnt bid 3@D, maybe a bit too weak?|pg||
nt|diaoff: Alternatively, Andersson could have shown a two-suiter with 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: vul may b to strong|pg||
nt|milton_se: honorable|pg||
nt|magnus_e: they must be tired...forget system in second bidding round !|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s9|pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|diaoff: Maybe too weak, but at least you end up in the right suit|pg||
nt|milton_se: song: but it is over now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: after ps pass bids must be stronger in - vul|pg||
nt|bt: it was over after norths pass on 1@H|pg||

mb|2S|nt|bridge_one: we can see if E/W use weak open with 55|pg||

nt|yo_yo: hello from Manchester|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would seem to be a flat board, but who can tell after the last set?|pg||
nt|haans: question was 4@D a good bid???????|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|bjurn: I'm not sure why S bid 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: on board 14 ew got involved and helped ns bid the difficult to bid game|pg||
nt|milton_se: 1S would have forced Arne to pass -- not showing real Cs|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|milton_se: Feels like this start means that Frirond won't compete...|pg||
nt|haans: enter with 2@D penalised?|pg||
nt|milton_se: 5NT should be this, I think: all 1st controls|pg||
nt|magnus_e: 6@h from north|pg||
nt|diaoff: Hans-Ove and Everfresh both on 151 now|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brolucius: I was just thinking to myself that 40 years ago some players would have responded 3NT...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that seems a good description of North's hand|pg||
nt|diaoff: Might end up too high in @H here|pg||
nt|wygbe1: rehi all|pg||
mb|d|nt|diaoff: ...or have they also started to apply the modern pick-a-slam conv? :)|pg||
nt|vugraph815: That's what East thougt while Weat interpreted it as asking about trumphonours and that he needed three to bid the grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: apparently neither did he :)|pg||
nt|haans: not as per cc|pg||
nt|milton_se: ... not easy to take back 20 imps from Berik|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: yes a good old fashioned bid|pg||
nt|papa hall: For those of you not familiar with Swedish geography....2@H is called Askeröd...named after a little town in southern Sweden|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many time a overcall at level 1 is more effective that a preemptive at 3 level|pg||
nt|bt: 2N was conservative?|pg||
nt|magnus_e: on board 14 Törnqvist in other room showed 13+ with norhs hand. It led to 4@s. Good evaluation. |pg||
nt|diaoff: Never argue with success, and the zones were in favour|pg||
nt|vugraph815: I think you could set it for 800, so... no :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|magnus_e: 3@h extras i suppose?|pg||
nt|diaoff: will stop in 5 now I guess|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yo_yo: South didnt think north could have the @H suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: West has read the text-books 'Only weak players lead from a jack', but he held all the jacks.|pg||
nt|diaoff: Or not...|pg||
nt|haans: we will soon find the answer to that question|pg||
nt|vugraph815: But sure, partner could have had an extra @D and then it would have been a good sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: 4@S preemtive???|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: EW didnt end up too high, NS did. :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: im all for passing 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraph815: And by consuming a lot of space you make it easier for them to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|diaoff: will also lead hearts the safe way making 5|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt with 19 isn't standard, overall with 5 closed suit|pg||
nt|haans: yes they did not find their @C|pg||
nt|vugraph815: So all in all, I think it's an acceptable choice|pg||
pc|d6|nt|diaoff: Not always good to win the auction :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|diaoff: Now he will not score any @D tricks|pg||
nt|vugraph815: Even with this extremely favorable @H-layout, declarer only has 7 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|haans: yes we all have been there :)|pg||
nt|bjurn: generally the double is a good indication |pg||
nt|milton_se: probably meant so -- lucky break though|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|po-s: make?|pg||
nt|diaoff: oops you are right po, now there is trouble|pg||
nt|magnus_e: yes, ruff @s then trumphs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|haans: true spoken|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjurn: this wont be too expensive thou|pg||
nt|haans: extra spade trick?|pg||
nt|diaoff: 33 in @S will save him, y|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he'll still make q@C|pg||
nt|vugraph815: Pia thinks....|pg||
nt|haans: double on @Hxxx|pg||
nt|po-s: but now trump|pg||
pc|sK|nt|diaoff: It was -500 until now|pg||
nt|bt: opps competing to 3@H wasnt bad either ...|pg||
nt|vugraph815: Well, it's your job to analyze, not mine :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: u welcomed grönkvist|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|milton_se: not making, because 9S will be promoted|pg||
nt|haans: and clubs ruff with @STen|pg||
nt|milton_se: meant not making a peaceful -100|pg||
nt|magnus_e: heart back!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|milton_se: also 5-4 in unbid suits would indicate X|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bridge_one: however need to see how effective is the use of 2Major opening with 10/12 - many great pair use this system today|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|arvid: Why didnt East bid 2@S?|pg||
nt|milton_se: still in chock?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|po-s: sloppy play|pg||
nt|diaoff: many are tired now, apparently|pg||
nt|milton_se: did Arne miss that?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|magnus_e: playing too fast|pg||
nt|po-s: Declarer could have just ruffed a spade either directly after HA or after two high hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjurn: 1@D is either 11-13 balanced, 4+@D unbalanced or occasionally 4M, 5@C with a bad @C suit|pg||
nt|milton_se: minor Xfer?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bt: ns heading twards 2@H|pg||
