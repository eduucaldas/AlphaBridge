nt|henryb: bidding 3@s would probably get you a plus score against 4@d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S preempts against us are among our worst bidding nightmares. whenever 3N is a possibility you have to commit immediately. and of course there are other ways that 3S can be ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: awkward. too many balls in play and no room to explore. but when they bid 4S u just shrug & double. something it is not best double-dummy, but the agony factor is minimized. that ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is another reason why in general 3S is a better tactical weapon that 4S on these "borderline" preempot hands|pg||

pc|h7|nt|henryb: as so many, Duinn and Wittes play 3@c shous a good club suit and less than a game force|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hlortz: both pairs passed up the weak 4 card @S suit,,,|pg||
nt|cindy:  this could be doomed|pg||
nt|henryb: when South chooses to surpress the spades there is no way to find the suit|pg||
nt|cindy:  tough to find @d switch i guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am quite certain that at the table i would open 1S with that hand|pg||
nt|hlortz: seems like someone ought to bid the @S suit....|pg||
nt|henryb: It is hard after N opens 1@d|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: different points of view. for me it is the hand with 100 honors that is responsible for mentioning spades, not the hand with four small, when the latter has AKQxxx of another suit|pg||
nt|hlortz: 7@H lead because of weak suit. they probably play attitude vs NT?|pg||

nt|othered1: Anyone prefer 1@D?  I do, if allowed by my agreements|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|nt|lml: 3@D will be it I still think|pg||
nt|lml: if you bid 1@D you will still probably end up bidding 3@D over 3@C|pg||
nt|othered1: Not much choice for west, who certainly can't bring majors back into consideration.  |pg||
nt|onebid: I think it's a difficult choice and partnership agreements make the difference. I can't criticize either|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rather decent of East to hold @SQ10x|pg||
nt|lml: if Moss bids 4@C here she might push Glasson|pg||
nt|lml: but why would she?|pg||
nt|onebid: that would be a serious overbid by Moss|pg||
nt|othered1: make 5@D with a red suit lead|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: now baker says she needs to stop sorting her hand, so she will play right cards|pg||

nt|othered1: That's a useful tool here|pg||
mb|d|mb|5H|nt|onebid: you'd have to put a gun to my head to get me to play that hideous convention|pg||
nt|lml: the double makes Migry's decision easier|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't like double - gives the opponents so much more room - two extra  bids (pass and redouble) |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: as it turns out regular blackwood will show you all the KC|pg||
nt|othered1: XX part of a convensional set of responses?|pg||
nt|othered1: conventional|pg||
nt|lml: if 5@d is KC then redouble is probably ROPI|pg||
nt|onebid: 1st round control my guess|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|othered1: I've seen these confused by top pairs, though they shouldn't be.|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the 4@H response took up quite a bit of room too   |pg||
nt|lml: it always looks easier when you are not playing the hand|pg||
nt|onebid: It's for that reason I so dislike exclusion - so many disasters!|pg||
nt|othered1: did something go wrong with system or is this just a very conservative decision by north?|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: sorry answering spectator|pg||
nt|onebid: I guess the former|pg||
nt|lml: I think the redouble showed the first step|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I would put money on system - if 5@D is erkcb, then North can bid 5N for side kings - South bids 6@C |pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: redouble was the wrong answer as per Silvia|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think north could have made decision to play 6 so quickly if there was solid ageement on sequence |pg||
