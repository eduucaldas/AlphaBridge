nt|ady: cant now     I did earlier|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not that great  a slam but they have to bid it because it makes and has made in tyhe open|pg||

nt|lestergold: and as for 3n|pg||
nt|lestergold: might as well be in slam slam is a better prospect|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chick: similar to bd 27, except trust your partner worked there and not here|pg||
nt|lestergold: monstrous contract im saurprised that Ms Goldberg has floated this|pg||
nt|irwinbo: east west will lose points. sad on way because there was a bad slam bid and made in the other room. just in a way because 3 nt is an awful contract|pg||

nt|ady: looks like 8 tricks is a about the limit for their 25 hcp    more imps for Moss|pg||
nt|cbernstn: I do not think South hand worth 8 pts.  Jacks are overrated, and hand is 3343, yuck.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n would probably be unlucky but its nmot winning bridge to not bid 3n with these cards|pg||

nt|lestergold: the sandwhich finesses are right and u know where the cards are|pg||
nt|lestergold: the theory courtesy of a world silver meddalist|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|jwit: Shawn will have to put in the 9 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i noticed a few competitors play transfers over the 2N rebid -- would have been intersting to see that in action|pg||
nt|jwit: To give declarer any problems|pg||
nt|jwit: We play transfers over 2N|pg||
nt|mariner1: entries to dummy an issue now|pg||
nt|jwit: Would work well here.  Would bid 3H, showing 4H and 4S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D doesn't seem to fit transfers or checkback -- any guesses|pg||
nt|jwit: Will be easy if Shawn plays the spade Ace, not so easy otherwise|pg||
nt|rcm: shawn should not play A|pg||
nt|jwit: I would think 3D would be checkback, asking partner to show 3 hearts or 4 spades|pg||

nt|mariner1: Dinkin 71  Glasson 24 with 3 boards to score|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mariner1: make that 6 to score (3 to play in one room) Dinkin - Glasson|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dinkin no longer a shutout, but 32-1 is pretty close|pg||
nt|mariner1: (my spys have spinning heads :)  )|pg||
nt|jwit: Spade return probably best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the rate their going -- the room with Cohen-Pollack vs Deas-Palmer will still be going strong when we're done here|pg||
