nt|marlowepi: welcome roland |pg||
nt|andyv:  Welcome back all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Sacramento in California for the Unites States Women's Championship. Finals, six segments of 16 boards; this is the fourth and last today|pg||
nt|pef: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Peter Friedland, ed Shapiro and Andy Vinock|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 4@S  without a heart lead|pg||
nt|lml: to open or not top open?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Ed.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Sir RR of course :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is a question of what, not whether|pg||
nt|reisig: whew ...he remembered :)|pg||
nt|ady: hi Roland |pg||
nt|lml: the prediction so far is clubs 1 or 3|pg||
nt|ady: hi Ed|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb: Presumable 14 to 16 or 17|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Sacramento in California for the Unites States Women's Championship. Playoff, six segments of 16 boards over two days; this is the first|pg||
nt|pef: mancuso had a very good third segment.  let's see if the boards are as swingy for this one|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi all... last set produced some fireworks.|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: obliging of E to hold 4 spades and not hearts|pg||
nt|reisig: They beat 4@s (by West)|pg||
nt|ady: if east plays 4@S   almost certain to make|pg||
nt|lml: you don't love double but the other choices aren't so good|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S isn't a hateful spot, but isn't automatic as the cards lie.|pg||
nt|andyv:  already we have Wittes and Quinn going against Deas and Palmer|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|hlortz: Looks like a pretty routine 3NT to start off|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Cindy Marshall, Henry Bethe and Henry Lortz, all from USA|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi all |pg||
nt|andyv:  aces should influence south|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: hello|pg||
nt|henryb: the winner of this match becomes one of the two US teams in the Venice Trophy|pg||
nt|henryb: this is a little tricky to play: declarer would like to set up three black tricks to go with 6 red ones|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i am not a fan of double, though it could be the winner. a lot depends on your weak 2 style though|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd prefer to get my long major into the auction, w ith such major suit disparities.  But nothing's clear.|pg||
nt|lml: who should bid more?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: but perhas should set up one spade and then work on diamonds|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: N correctly passed the double, where many would bid 4C. that almost surely will fetch a game bid from opps, which u dont want to hear. meanwhile, if you pass sometimes they stop in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S|pg||
nt|lml: but then again missing an iffy bid is not so bad|pg||
nt|lml: NV|pg||
nt|pef: hi all|pg||
nt|jstokes: Hi and welcome to session 3 of 6 for the finals|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi all|pg||
nt|pef: we're in the third of 6 segments of the first final match of the women's team trials|pg||
nt|pef: wow, 4s seems a bit pushy after only 2s by partner|pg||
nt|othered1: double may help place @S, to declarer's benefit|pg||
nt|pef: yes, and the lie of the clubs is lucky|pg||
nt|pef: but not a whole lot of dummy entries|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||
nt|reisig: You can tell from my silence ..I'd agree to anything|pg||
nt|lml: this isnt't that tense in 3|pg||
nt|pef: a pretty normal 3nt, although the two-suited overcall by west may cause declarer to go wrong in clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jstokes: really a max 1NT here; she caught up in round 2 of the bidding :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|3for3: good start for mancuso here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: now only making 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree, ed. you might easily make a 5-2 spade game or 3NT if you bid 3S, but if you double go down in a crappy 43 heart game|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|lml: going to be glad they are in partscore I think|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb: now its easy: win in dummy and play a club for 9. And with the good diamonds should end up with 11|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pef: very close match so far|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pef: has to go down now|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jstokes: as you said, Peter|pg||
nt|pef: as predicted.  now only 8 tricks most likely|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|lml: nice play by Goldberg... shows shes awaks|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@S made 5 in other room|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|reisig: Hiya Danny!!!|pg||
nt|3for3: hi richie, all|pg||
nt|lml: well done to North-South really to hold it tight|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Deas bid 4s over 3s, so result acutally 4s down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi danny. |pg||
nt|3for3: that makes sense|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jstokes: same opening in other room -- with no interference they play in 1NT|pg||
nt|pef: I'm being asked who is e/w.  I'm not sure, but the operator will get it up eventually.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|henryb: a sneaky way to grab an extra for the defense|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pef: well spoke a little too soon|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d7|nt|andyv:  yeap|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|othered1: now @H woiuld have beaten it|pg||
nt|pef: palmer needed to return a heart first|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  10@C in dummy should have been a warning|pg||
pc|sT|pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|pef: I think she played a bit carelessly, declarer almost surely was 55 and she could see this coming|pg||

nt|onebid: likely competition here|pg||
nt|onebid: NS will need to sell out early, though|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Vugraphu5: e-w bid precision|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk5: Hi Ellen, Mike, Giorgio and Henry|pg||
mb|d|nt|hlortz: hi all|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not more of 2@S for N/S here|pg||
nt|caitlin: hi there Roland|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|onebid: I think I'd prefer 1@S to neg X|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Henry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good day all|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Hi Roland , Henry & Martin|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: has to bid 2@S now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or not...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|onebid: now she can't show 5 spades without overstating her values|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S was more easy to make that 1Nt|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: this looks one shy|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|hlortz: yes if 1@S showed 5, maybe better to raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe can play spades|pg||
nt|hlortz: looks like 4@H 2@S and 1@C for the defense...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with A A K and passed hand may be 2@H more clear - but probably the bad distribution 4333 give at South the idea to choose 1nt|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt need a present by def|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: I dont like the negative double at all |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|onebid: Bob Glasson tells me 1@S would show minors!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this move is interesting|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|d4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|mdgraham: that is an interesting treatment |pg||
nt|lml: that is unfortunate|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|bridge_one: but not sufficient to make 7 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|onebid: well, we will get reliable method info:)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: so presumably double showed spades? Or simply responsive?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: nice clear discarding by berkowitz|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|bridge_one: would need to continue A in @d and small @d for Qxx in west or East|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't know - East may need a crocodile in spades, else East may be endplayed to lead away from the @DQ |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|cT|pc|h8|pg||

nt|3for3: so 11 for mancuso, more than they won the entire first 16|pg||
nt|pef: I'm surprised that's the play declarer made in diamonds.  it seems far better to lead toward the j10xx in dummy than lead the J|pg||
nt|3for3:  deas and palmer|pg||
nt|pef: she knew her partner was 5431 with 4 hearts.  if she had only 3 h and kqjxx of diamonds surely would have bid 2d rather than double over 1s|pg||
nt|pef: so almost everything was known|pg||
nt|andyv:  known or visible|pg||
nt|pef: a good hand to study for defensive reasoning|pg||
mb|1D|nt|othered1: Hi, Danny!|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|marlowepi: he has a second account for when he wants to do that|pg||
nt|lml: they deserved to win imps with the nice defense.  |pg||
nt|3for3: lol|pg||
nt|pef: that wins with a doubleton or stiff honor with the hand with the majors and still is ok if a stiff 9|pg||
nt|andyv:  running clubs might have caused a little discomfort to Deas|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: she might pass|pg||
mb|2D|nt|3for3: 2@S here...|pg||
nt|3for3: 1@S shows 5|pg||
nt|pef: no, I think it's right to play diamonds first, if you run clubs you don't have the transportation to take advantage of the actual diamond situation|pg||
nt|andyv:  agreed... was just talking about discomfort level:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they had the same exact defence at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: N shows a limit raise + in @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@d?|pg||
nt|pef: wow|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cindy:  whats their notrump range ?|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S   about the limit for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: this one is interesting. deas just decided to force to game whicih seems reasonable at that point|pg||
nt|jstokes: Deas's hand did get better with the opps bidding diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: yes - 4d|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul will mace sac unpalatable|pg||
nt|pef: a bit more excuse at the other table, west hadn't doubled, but still seems like a clear error|pg||
nt|othered1: with west having tons of extras, east could have profited by playingh 2@CX|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb: and gets her side oveboard. but since E-W can make 3@s or 4@c, perhaps not so bad|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and all they will biod|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  1N on last hand with 14 but not 1N this time|pg||
nt|henryb: 14-17 I believe|pg||
nt|cindy:  ok|pg||
nt|3for3: identical auction other table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on a bad day they get their heart ruff in the short trump hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: ak and a heart is best|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|jstokes: three rounds of trumps is best but hard to lead that singleton with such good options|pg||
nt|pef: the ak is on lead, actually|pg||
nt|jstokes: ah yes -- then maybe|pg||
nt|pef: not unreasonable with 10xxx of spades|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pef: wow, that would have been my last choice by far for a lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, actually 10@s was my last choice|pg||
nt|jstokes: trying to give partner a ruff, i guess|pg||
nt|jstokes: spades could be 5-4-3-1|pg||
nt|pef: yes, playing to get 2 hearts a spade ruff and another trick, I guess, but catering to them holding exactly 8 cards in both majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like a good 6@d contract was missed here|pg||
nt|pef: I think I would have passed with the east hand.  in the worst case they are +180, but if that's true we almost surely don't have a game and in the best case we get 800 or so (like ...|pg||
nt|pef: on this hand|pg||
nt|pef: yeah, 6d is really good, isn't it|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  once it was confirmed that E had more than zero diamonds!1|pg||
nt|pef: would probably take 7-1 clubs to beat it|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: the only way to go down is 2H a heart ruff and ducking the club return|pg||
nt|andyv:  if n/s play 3/5 leads against suits, seems playing low spade would retain more options|pg||
nt|pef: or maybe spades 5-1 and some other bad fortune|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|Walddk4: The winning team will be USA1 in the Venice Cup (women's World Championships) in Brazil in late August/early September. The loser will get another chance against the winning team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: of a playoff match between the losing semi-finalists. That team will be USA2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Full coverage of both matches in the BBO Vugraph Theatre today, Wednesday and Thursday|pg||
nt|cavendish: lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  options limited but will work because of stiff 10@h|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: she has to rise on the club|pg||
nt|ady: declarer  must refuse club finesse  after the 3rd heart is ruffesed|pg||
nt|ady: ruffed|pg||
nt|othered1: as the cards lie here . . . |pg||
nt|Walddk4: The winning team will be USA1 in the Venice Cup (women's World Championships) in Brazil in late August/early September. The loser will get another chance against the winning team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: of a playoff match between the losing semi-finalists. That team will be USA2|pg||
nt|lml: we already know Goldberg is awake so this should be no problem|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like a matter of how seriously west's 3@Cshould be taken as a slam try, not just poking around for a stopper for 3N|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|jstokes: still time to stop the spade ruffs|pg||
nt|andyv:  can go down now|pg||
nt|pef: did she really play a heart?  now it's easy to beat|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h6|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|pef: the only thing that would present joann from playing ace and another heart is not believing declarers could make that play|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h7|mc|11|nt|reisig: an instant @c ace :)|pg||
nt|pef: well the first priority is getting to 3n, but west looks strong enough to me to afford to bid 4c over 3n, especially at imps|pg||

nt|lml: or their methods would be unworkable|pg||
nt|onebid: likely both|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and can double show four spades?|pg||
nt|lml: I imagine it must be 4+S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not the best of starts for NS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they need a spark very soon|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: told dbl=4/5@S, 2@H=6@S|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes S raised to 2@S in the other room for +110|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: some pairs would use a Garbage Multi 2@D for that South hand  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: not more that 4@S for N/S - 5@D less one for E/W with finesse in @D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but E/W vuln, so difficult to find the defence|pg||
nt|hlortz: hard to take vul vs non vul save over a 2nt though :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|onebid: Dbl shows 4-5 spades and 2@H shows 6 spades.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just about enough shape to make it right though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: a treatment which I think needs support doubles, to identify the degree of fit if the auciton gets competitive   |pg||
pc|d4|nt|onebid: a very workable method if well discussed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oops|pg||
nt|mdgraham: "system on, partner"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many use texas to play in the majors, other use great texas|pg||
nt|hlortz: i would think 5@D would be -2 though no?|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|bridge_one: this it is the second time i see in hight competition the pass over a texas !|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lml: yes but call me old fashioned I like to bid 1S with spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it sounds most playable|pg||
nt|onebid: Berkowitz will need to shift to diamonds early|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|c6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so better use the great texas 4@C for @H, 4@D for @S, impossible to pass :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: yes, other time last years worlds?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|lml: that early enough|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|onebid: that's early!|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h9|pc|sQ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bridge_one: no, i seen a pass few week ago|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|sT|nt|lml: I suppose the double really is a 1@S bid |pg||
nt|mdgraham: must play club or heart now |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: the idea is if there is room, transfers on|pg||
pc|sK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: by that rule it would apply here, since 4@D available for hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can also play dbl=I would have bid that (so double here=transfer to hearts)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hlortz: some play on only thru 3@C as 3@D-4@D needed for stayman.. anyway better to have agreement|pg||

nt|marlowepi: so awake or asleep there is something to think about|pg||
nt|andyv:  does seem odd|pg||
nt|andyv:  west certainly is worth one more try|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: If 4@C wasn't western and was a quite strong raise,east might have cue-bid back.  But that's hindsight ridden.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|marlowepi: well, E is also eligible to remember it is IMPs, and return a club|pg||

nt|3for3: 2@D multi|pg||
nt|lml: if she doesnt return a club she will beat it be force|pg||
nt|lml: interesting... no honors but sseven hearts|pg||
nt|lml: vulnerable protection|pg||
nt|3for3: plenty of honors....in other suits|pg||
nt|ady: 4@s   the limit for n/s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she will not beat it by force if N has the ten of clubs|pg||
nt|lml: so who likes 3@H|pg||
nt|3for3: or 4nt|pg||
nt|3for3: I prefer zero hearts|pg||
nt|ady: vulnerability reversed  5@D a save for e/w|pg||
nt|3for3: south must be careful in 4 spades...or north even|pg||
nt|3for3: can't ruff in, must pitch club|pg||
nt|lml: I don't mind 2@D|pg||
nt|lml: I wouldnt bid it myself because my partners hates those bids but bridge in a final is about pressure|pg||
nt|lml: passing doesn't create pressure|pg||
nt|3for3: north south are playing option 2 vs mutli|pg||
nt|lml: if you bid 3@H in second chair at these colors you are Marty Bergen|pg||
nt|3for3: double is the 'book' bid for north|pg||
nt|pef: east may open 1nt in which case will play 4s.  then up to south to find a club lead, probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: of course I forgot about the weak 2 on a 10 high suit vul. :)|pg||
nt|pef: 2d is the dreaded multi, of couse, showing a weak 2 in a major|pg||
nt|othered1: Do they also include a strong option?|pg||
nt|andyv:  quality obviously not an issue:)|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|3for3: double is 13-16 or any strong hand|pg||
nt|lml: well it qualifies as that for sure.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: fyi, the dbl was fastr, the pass was slow|pg||
nt|lml: pass here shows diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: but maybe not quite as good ass this|pg||
nt|reisig: They opened 2@s in other room and went down in 4@s|pg||
nt|lml: 2@S by South is below my level ... |pg||
nt|reisig: Both are ...well...not so good|pg||
nt|ady: should not go down      did not discard a club on 3rd diamond?|pg||
nt|reisig: This match will be CLOSE...in a minute|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what they play 3@D as over the double.  Likely diamonds|pg||
nt|3for3: let's hope so.|pg||
nt|lml: And maybe not forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: multi by W has the advantage that you are more likely to score your spade queen. however, i have a strong aversion to 2-level openings with seven-card suits. that sentiment is far ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: from universal though |pg||
nt|andyv:  pretty gutsy dbl of 3@c in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: at the other table they did pass 2cx, but only beat it 2|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|cindy:  e/w has a @d partial|pg||
nt|lml: I have passed with the South hand before this thinking 2@D was not game but Sprung is more disciplined|pg||
nt|3for3: 3@H must be a transfer?|pg||
nt|reisig: Jo was trying to remember the notes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wouldnt be tempted to defend 2DX when we might be cold for 7S|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H?|pg||
nt|henryb: Sorry to be late|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Henry|pg||
nt|3for3: hi henry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome henry|pg||
nt|ady: hi Henry|pg||
nt|reisig: Henry  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: N and S both reading defense to multi notes for long time, N now outside asking director question|pg||
nt|reisig: does the director know the notes|pg||
nt|3for3: probably not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: can he carry a tune?|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: what is 3@h?|pg||
nt|3for3: this will likely get NS past the last plus on the hand.|pg||
nt|lml: North Americans are unfamiliar with Multi.  THe problem with the notes is they don't take you far enough into the auction|pg||
nt|ady: seems very easy going  to be able to look at system notes during the game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is a defense, not their own system notes|pg||
nt|henryb: If East starts three rounds of diamonds, North can make 4@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but all pairs competing for the honor of playing in a world championship would do well to come to the table ready for multi, which is so widely played |pg||
nt|lml: or a heart|pg||
nt|henryb: In fact 4@s is cold, isn't it? on any defense?|pg||
nt|reisig: I think ..North wants to cue bid 4@h :)|pg||
nt|ady: and widely played for m any years|pg||
nt|jstokes: yes, and looks like it could have been made|pg||
nt|pef: yes, at imps, absolutely.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: ew can make more @D than NS can @S but may not get in the auction|pg||
nt|pef: I don't think it can be made with an initial trump lead and continuations.  seems like you have to lose 3 hearts, a diamond, and a spade|pg||
nt|jstokes: might end play west with a late heart|pg||
nt|jstokes: east i mean|pg||
nt|pef: but it does look like e/w can make 4s|pg||
nt|rcm: Quinn needed to X 4C toset contract|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: In North America if they are playing multi then you are allowed to read your defense or the defense provided|pg||
nt|lml: strange as that may seem to the Europeans who are asking me.|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's what Quinn did |pg||
nt|pef: yeah, that does look right|pg||
mb|p|nt|jstokes: a game try and you hold seven to the A |pg||
nt|andyv:  now we are in swing territory|pg||
nt|pef: this might push them to the vul. game|pg||
nt|pef: 4c is transfer into your major|pg||
nt|pef: so east gets to play it|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: which might get doubled|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|henryb: I would have balanced with East, but it is close and not unreasonable to pass|pg||
nt|hlortz: inhibited by vulnerablility perhaps|pg||
nt|othered1: Fine auction|pg||
nt|3for3: well, they seemed to dodge that bullet|pg||
nt|reisig: now ..just make it|pg||
nt|henryb: Now she just has to make it|pg||
nt|3for3: i like cheapest minor to be a cuebid over multi too|pg||
nt|lml: The spectators are pointing out something that we have been writing in our blog|pg||
nt|3for3: not sure it is in the published defense|pg||
nt|lml: North Americans will have to play against Multi without notes in Brazil|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: sprung states, 3h showed invite or better in spades|pg||
nt|lml: They should start now|pg||
nt|andyv:  at other table, are they playing a big club system?|pg||
nt|othered1: might find@D ruff here for -1|pg||
nt|pef: I don't think so|pg||
nt|pef: (about the strong club system)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|pef: better lead a trump to have a chance to beat it|pg||
nt|andyv:  again trump lead seems best|pg||
nt|pef: and ahrd to believe she will from qxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  she might prefer that to akx:)|pg||
nt|pef: cruel :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|henryb: or by the fact that partner, an aggressive opener, was a passed hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  the acution does scream for a trump lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Specs think finding the ruff is unlikely.  I disagree,|pg||
nt|othered1: also point to north @S spots|pg||
nt|andyv:  if hearts are played, options are limited... have to find the D ruff|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hlortz: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club discrad on 3rd D does the trick|pg||
nt|pef: apparently not loud enough :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  damn ipods!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|lml: Well we know Goldberg is awake|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi there:)|pg||
nt|jstokes: HI|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  might do a scissor coup here|pg||
nt|othered1: and 3rd @H to pitch another @C?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: But Goldberg isn't playing this|pg||
nt|ady: both tables failed|pg||
nt|reisig: Danny ...don't look!|pg||
nt|andyv:  she gets the ruff that she really didn't want|pg||
nt|pef: ruff low is her best shot|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb: same bad play made by Baker in the other room.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: they played it from the asleep side apparently|pg||
nt|lml: Sprung didn't count her tricks|pg||
nt|lml: or losers or something|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pef: now ruff with the queen and play a spade.  that beats it|pg||
nt|pef: beats it 2 actually as rich reisig just pointed out|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow|pg||
nt|pef: hmm, she just knocked out here own entry|pg||
nt|andyv:  has to finesse|pg||
nt|pef: no, she can win and play the low club ruffing with the queen, now ruff a club or a heart lead the 10 of spades|pg||
nt|rcm: finess is marked|pg||
nt|othered1: It's beginning to look like the end of several long days, with play perhaps less sharp than earlier|pg||
nt|pef: I mean the low diamond|pg||
nt|pef: let's try that again.|pg||
nt|andyv:  i'll be nice, Peter:)|pg||
nt|pef: win the ace or queen, lead the 9 of diamonds ruffing with the queen of spades, ruff a club or heart low, lead the 10 of spades|pg||
nt|pef: win any return, draw trump, claim|pg||
nt|andyv:  good line|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|pef: south has had nothing but big decisions so far this match.  every board, literally|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pef: well done!|pg||
nt|caitlin: wd|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  but couldn't declarer simply have pitched the club on first ruff?|pg||
nt|pef: north needed to just return a diamond when she was in before playing a club|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|rcm: nice play by Beth|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|othered1: @C pitch loses when east has all three spaces, so ruffing isn't a zero play|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
nt|andyv:  at other room, E used both trum to ruff out diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  trump|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c9|pg||
pc|sT|nt|othered1: spades, not spaces|pg||
nt|reisig: If W has KQJ of @c  ..still OK ....:)|pg||
nt|lml: Michael Rosenberg put it this way (thanks Michael) she should have said "how can I make if West has the @SQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you mean if W is 6-6?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb: seems unlikely in the extreme that West has 12 cards in hearts and clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pef: I was just thinking about that.  south then has to switch to a spade.  declarer gets 4 spades, 2 diamonds 3 hearts and a club ruff for 10 tricks|pg||

nt|bridge_one: the important is not play in the bad major .. all system are ok, the best choise must be automatic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not the sort of result to cheer up team-mates|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally big pair training in difficult hands, so possible they don't remember the more easy gadgets|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: 1@c Precision|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this must be strong @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yes, EW Presision pair.|pg||
mb|2D!|an|transfer|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: with 4@d in South would be more difficult for E/W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4 cards in @D i means|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: the bid in the pre, board was not a transfer.  the problem was in the south.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty Valentin|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3 or 4 @S with East ? not more value about initial Dbl - of course depending on agreements|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|onebid: odd not to rebid 2@D|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: West could bid 4@D as pick-a-major - but then the lead is coming through the @DKJ|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: matter of style - some like to support with three cards |pg||
nt|lml: I had a question about how you can play internationally for more than 1 country|pg||
nt|onebid: yes, but strong enough playing Precision to bid 2@S if partner prefers to 2@H|pg||
nt|lml: Apparently Migry Zur has played for Israel before|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, can rebid 2@d, and then 2@s if partner bids 2@H|pg||
nt|lml: She has always played for Israel|pg||
nt|lml: My understanding is that you have to stop playing for the other country for 2 years|pg||
mb|4H|nt|onebid: Can that really be true?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I believe Balicki-Zmudzinski are transferring from Poland to Russia |pg||
nt|lml: Glasson does have a lovely max playing Precision and ruffs|pg||
nt|onebid: right Mike|pg||
nt|lml: yes so that have to take a holiday for a while to qualify|pg||
nt|onebid: I doubt 2 years|pg||
nt|lml: I recall that Gavin Wolpert told me that.  He is switching from Canada to the US|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, 2@S is better - need to be the declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: interesting trump shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: It may vary by country|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|hlortz: making 5... next.... not the sort of hands moss is looking for...|pg||

nt|stewball: hi everyone|pg||
nt|lml: its better for south if she doesn't realize she could have made it and just goes on|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we can blame it on Multi :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Blame me|pg||
nt|pef: not 100% sure about that, but I think that's right|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway, pick up of 5 for Mancuso team|pg||
nt|pef: but then again I didn't understand beth palmers declarer play on the previous board, either :)|pg||
nt|pef: well at any rate, match is down to 12 imps, a single vul. game swing|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the match gets a bit tighter.|pg||
nt|pef: and we have another interesting hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: that's what partners are for....to let us know|pg||
nt|lml: what happens to me in this situations is I think about it, figure it out and try to forget it ... not always so well|pg||
nt|othered1: Pointed out by scotty, @C ruffing won't make last hand if @S were all off.|pg||
nt|ady: this likely to be flat    4@S|pg||
nt|lml: we will get to see their methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right Ed, but he is used to playing with Zia, who opens weak 2s with 6-6. most of us donty|pg||
nt|lml: except Goldberg is going to bid|pg||
nt|henryb: declarer could not make it if East had @sQxx, always 4 losers, so should worry about losing to @sQ in West|pg||
nt|pef: looks like 4h is the best contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I find that opening a strong club causes everyone to jump in no matter what|pg||
nt|othered1: A compromise opening over either minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  so Lynn bids diamonds when she doesn't have them and NT when she does.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: if E had all three spades, he has a stiff club, so ruffing the diamond does make on an elimination i think|pg||
nt|caitlin: 6@S adventuresome|pg||
nt|pef: 6s at the other table.  seems a bit stratospheric on those cards|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|marlowepi: i mean if W really is 6-6|pg||
nt|pef: double here shows hearts and probably at least diamond tolerance|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  seems like too much work to make 6@s|pg||
nt|pef: can east possibly pass?  |pg||
nt|othered1: can east, with extra high cards, sit this out?|pg||
nt|rcm: beth would do well do pass, but very tough|pg||
nt|othered1: and, if so, will south?|pg||
nt|andyv:  how fast does S bid 2@S if Beth passes?|pg||
nt|rcm: that would be my bid|pg||
nt|pef: about 1 millisecond :)|pg||
nt|pef: that may at least tie the record for best diamond holding ever by 1nt opening bidder on that auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: she in the tank|pg||
nt|andyv:  tough hand for Beth to pass... 3@c seems so natural|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: she is...|pg||
nt|pef: yes, so easy to have a slam here|pg||
nt|rcm: should she pass, would make on power|pg||
nt|othered1: The redouble should tell east that slam isn't likely to be easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  true, and dbl throws a damper on value of stiff @d|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb: really?. maybe West has 7 hearts in that case|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but then maybe 3H more likely. in  any case, singleton spade queen is a zillion times more likely|pg||
nt|reisig: this auction may not be over|pg||
nt|lml: 5@D isn't terrible|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bidding 3D then 5D is, though|pg||
nt|caitlin: I wonder about the splinters with Aces|pg||
nt|andyv:  never do them unless it works|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: Interesting. I would have thought West strong enough to bid 2@d and then 2@s over a 2@h preference|pg||
nt|cindy:  agree|pg||
nt|cindy:  this plays pretty well|pg||
nt|jstokes: seems the best alternative here -- partner's hypothetical @DK isn't likely to be of much value|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: But Karen operates very much on the KISS principle with Lynn|pg||
nt|cindy:  a heart to the 8 eventually |pg||
nt|hlortz: s might well put up Q@H on a @H toward dummy trying to look like KQ|pg||
nt|ady: might get out for down 1 in 5@D|pg||
nt|3for3: joann wasnt thinking i bet|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i back your bet|pg||
nt|andyv:  oops|pg||
nt|pef: go pam, low spade!|pg||
nt|rcm: 3N down 1 |pg||
pc|d2|nt|3for3: she bids the limit of the hand right away as a matter of style|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N wasn't one of my immediate options|pg||
pc|d9|nt|henryb: I think you duck a club, win the spade, ruff a club and play top diamonds|pg||
nt|cindy:  yeh|pg||
nt|othered1: What's the likelihood partner has 5 running @S on this auction?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: i know|pg||
nt|andyv:  sane auction|pg||
nt|rcm: uh oh, making|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|andyv:  no fun for the kibitzers|pg||
nt|caitlin: sensible stop|pg||
nt|pef: michael rosenberg told me he thinks 6s can probably make and arguing with michael rosenberg about a declarer play is a very bad idea!|pg||
nt|jstokes: I agree about the not arguing part|pg||
nt|pef: ah and the second  best declarer in the room (double dummy at least) gib agrees with michael|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|ady: 5 level might be dangerous for e/w   and 4NT  seems unusual action with a void?|pg||
nt|reisig: Must leave for while..sorry|pg||
nt|ady: lead might give it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: see ya RR|pg||
nt|jstokes: seems like you'd need to ruff a few diamonds, which would make it hard to pick up spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  1 imp loss|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|henryb: now a high diamond to pitch a @h|pg||
nt|andyv:  If Michael says it can be made, then it definitely is a lot of work!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pef: gib says south can now play any card in her hand and make 6|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|othered1: for whom?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hlortz: seems odd to start drawing trump with all the @C losers...|pg||
nt|henryb: although almost anything will see her home from here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart ace (unblock ten) and a heart|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|andyv:  Dinkin|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|Vugraphu8: did not see if wittes unblocked ace|pg||
pc|cA|nt|3for3: unblock not needed|pg||
nt|othered1: no need to unblock 10 and if south doesn't cover, can lead @D|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lml: Glasson should bid here |pg||
nt|mdgraham: easy slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 4@C seems practical|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: easy if you blackwood, otherwise seven the danger|pg||
nt|hlortz: many play a reverse doesnt show extras after a 2 over 1|pg||
nt|bridge_one: easy in bridge nothing ... remember 4@H before - |pg||
nt|mdgraham: only question is how to avoid seven, and there is a useful convention for that|pg||
mb|4H|nt|irwinbo: thank you  no problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not too hot, not too cold...just right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: like the porridge|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Keep your luke-warm porridge in London|pg||
nt|lml: what would have happened if East had overcalled 1NT I wonder|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you don't like porrisge, Roland? |pg||
nt|onebid: hearts may have been better, but this can work|pg||
nt|othered1: except 4@C is far from cold|pg||
nt|onebid: right Ed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is probably ace asking|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for sample, many use 4@C like cuebid and raise in @h ....|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: might play a quiet 2@H if east had tried 1N|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|bridge_one: 2@H with regular strenght is to privilege the distribution (after 2 over 1 can be advantageous|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: good cash on this strong bidding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the lead A in @D after the auction is correct, playing to find sgl in East|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: NS might get to 3@D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: rigth|pg||

nt|cindy:  yes|pg||
nt|3for3: another slam|pg||
nt|lml: nice hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so that we dont get sleepy|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C   or 6NT   for n/s|pg||
nt|3for3: jo will be disappointed to be off an ace and settle for the small|pg||
nt|pef: yet another problem for south (but a lot less stressful in 4 than in 6)|pg||
nt|andyv:  in open room Q@S was led followed by 3 rounds of spades.|pg||
nt|pef: and somehow the match has just turned around and mancuso is leading|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Gavin Wolpert|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Gavin|pg||
nt|gavin:  hey|pg||
nt|rcm: Hi Gavin|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: hi|pg||
nt|othered1: Another slam and a good hand type for a big @C system|pg||
nt|pef: match could easily be even after this board.  this seems like a fairly easily biddible slam|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ady: should not be difficult to reach|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you mean she won;t bid exclusion and then the grand?|pg||
nt|3for3: an opening bid opposite a strong 2.  |pg||
nt|lml: It should be fast and furious to 6|pg||
nt|othered1: Chance for NS to get to a better contract and pick up imps with 6N|pg||
nt|3for3: barely plural, imps, that is|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cindy:  hmm|pg||
nt|stewball: well thats one solution....|pg||
nt|stewball: at these colors i would mind watching for 1 round of the bidding|pg||
mb|2N|nt|othered1: the competition vul NS can put up here should be brushed aside easily (or punished if higher)|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: who knows maybe N has the minors|pg||
nt|henryb: I think 1N is a reasonable solution for that hand, probably better than 2@c|pg||
nt|pef: do the rest of you think the west hand is a three card limit raise type of hand or just a simple raise of 1s?|pg||
nt|pef: because in the open room after 1s p 2s they stopped in 4h|pg||
nt|othered1: simple raise for me.  Max HCP, minimum shape|pg||
nt|gavin:  i think it evaluates to a 3 card limit raise, but its more practical to just make a simple raise NV|pg||
nt|othered1: But, again, Precision should eat this hand up.|pg||
nt|andyv:  i'm old fashioned... would have bid 1N and then 3S or 4H depending on partner's rebid|pg||
nt|rcm: I prefer negX go 2N|pg||
nt|gavin:  interesting that 1NT natural game forcing wasnt possible on this hand|pg||
nt|pef: 2nt eats up a fair amount of space|pg||
nt|pef: I guess they play transfer type bids after an overcall|pg||
nt|gavin:  having JTx of spades is an excellent holding, its definitely worth more than a normal 1 point for a Jack|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: she is in the tank...|pg||
nt|gavin:  the TD fits well with the king as well, those are two things i like about the texture of the hand|pg||
nt|pef: I agree, makes me believe it's a limit raise type of hand at imps, even nv|pg||
nt|andyv:  i wonder if dbl has a different meaning for them.|pg||
nt|pef: maybe double shows hearts?|pg||
nt|pef: some strong clubbers play it that way|pg||
nt|gavin:  however, im expecting my partner to push to game with a singleton, and if partner has a singleton heart or diamond, then i have wasted values|pg||
nt|gavin:  i like to upgrade hands where i have a good hand facing more than 1 singleton|pg||
nt|gavin:  here, only a singleton club suits our hand|pg||
nt|othered1: isn't double usually less t han a game force in Precision?|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like they can play some check back system|pg||
nt|gavin:  since partner would have opened 1NT w/ 15-17 and 5-3-3-2, im expecting them to accept my limit raise with either 5-4-2-2, 6-3-2-2 or a singleton somewhere, with the unbalanced hands coming way more frequently|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: the director is requested to monitor the time|pg||
nt|gavin:  this hand doesnt fit well with the 5-4-3-1 hands, so i would just raise to 2S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|3for3: although if they dont cash ace, they dont get it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wimps. exclusion and then the grand. an immediate 13 IMPs then 30 more on psychological carryover|pg||
nt|3for3: not easy to exclude in partner's first bid suit|pg||
nt|lml: 2@H in this auction doesn't show extra|pg||
nt|henryb: no kidding|pg||
nt|marlowepi: danny your glass is always half empty :(....|pg||
nt|lml: I do play it can be 4-4-4-1 though|pg||
nt|othered1: now 2@S and hope to straighten things out later or take immediate control?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  well  it wont make W  fall in love with her hand|pg||
nt|pef: well this one looks pretty easy, although some chance of adventuring up to the five or six level|pg||
mb|3H|nt|stewball: well its clearly better than 2@c imo|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@c self KC.|pg||
nt|henryb: I got none, pard|pg||
nt|othered1: reasonable to take control, even if it might make 6N less easy tofind.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she is asking herself for keycards?|pg||
nt|3for3: something like that|pg||
nt|henryb: Oh; I fot 4 with the Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  3D was probably some sort of 3 suited bid, 3H showed 4H, now i would expect palmer to bid 4D|pg||
nt|gavin:  as she is on the high end of her bidding|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb: and our good partner bids 2@h and not 2@s|pg||
nt|henryb: got|pg||
nt|henryb: 5@c is I forgot?|pg||
nt|lml: I don't think Goldberg plays that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or it shows a full house|pg||
nt|lml: this could be a problem|pg||
nt|lml: a big problem|pg||
nt|3for3: jo knows that wasn't kc, so hopefully will assume partner has no ace, no cuebid|pg||
nt|henryb: nah. It is an impossible response|pg||
nt|lml: the problem is Sprung can't ask for the diamond ace now|pg||
nt|lml: and if she has to guess she will probably guess wrong|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i doubt it|pg||
nt|othered1: Our rule used to be that jumps to 6N either were right or warned that the wheels had come off.  Would, luckily, work well here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: good that the @C finesse is off otherwise might make too many|pg||
nt|gavin:  4S keycard ?|pg||
nt|robinswr: yes|pg||
mb|5C|an|1-4|nt|henryb: so partner obviously thought it set trump and asted for a cue, and did not show @dA|pg||
nt|lml: maybe they know what they are doing and we don't|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 4C is taken as natural, the jump in a 2-1 auction should demand a cuebid|pg||
nt|henryb: this is dangerous|pg||
nt|othered1: very|pg||
nt|marlowepi: henry and i saying same thing in somewhat different ways|pg||
nt|henryb: partner might think you have @c and @h|pg||
nt|lml: if she knows that Goldberg doesn't have the @DA she would have just bid the slam|pg||
nt|lml: she doesn't know|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right, but when N bids 6C she is going to pass|pg||
nt|henryb: and when North passes she will pass out|pg||
nt|lml: at least Goldberg knows that 5@H is some kind of grand slam try|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't think N popped in|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Undo please|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lml: it can be nothing else so she should cuebid an ace if she has one|pg||
nt|lml: Sprung will give up|pg||
nt|lml: I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|henryb: I would bid 6N|pg||
nt|othered1: atransfer to 6N?|pg||
nt|lml: another grand slam try|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trying for 8|pg||
nt|3for3: clever, she is begging for ace of d, and will end in 6nt?|pg||
nt|henryb: or 6@s to get partner to bid 7 with the @dA|pg||
nt|othered1: getting to the perfect spot at last possible call?|pg||
nt|pef: lots of people pointing out that 6d is quite a good contract.  with diamonds no worse than 3-1 you can first play to drop the queen of spades and if that fails take a heart finesse|pg||
nt|pef: queen ask?|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|lml: she hopes that Goldberg will bid 7@C with the @da and she can play 6NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: good recovery by Sprung|pg||
nt|3for3: whewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: jo has been shaking her head for 10 min|pg||
nt|lml: they can right up that auction and look at it later|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i must say it is very unselfish holding that S hand to work so hard for N to play it|pg||
nt|othered1: If 4@C had been natural and forcing, this would have been a correct auction.|pg||
nt|lml: I don't know if under pressure I could have done as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: jo now informing opp 4c is rkc|pg||
nt|henryb: In case partner had QJ KQJx KJxxx Jx and this protects the @dK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 4C were nat & forcing, then 5C denied the ace of D and they would be in 6 an hour ago|pg||
nt|lml: She bid it this way to try to force a cuebid after partner didn't read the KC bid|pg||
nt|lml: She figured it was her only chance to get to the grand and I think she did great|pg||
nt|henryb: Palmer might find the @d lead on this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: have to have lots of partnership confidence, even in the midst of confusion, to take those actions, but they sure worked.|pg||
nt|andyv:  well done|pg||
nt|pef: well done and that should put the match to within 1 imp|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gavin:  palmer knew about everything except the great spade fit, on this hand 6NT is a complete claim|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: Yes, they seem tohave been on top of this one all the way|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lml: She is going to be so relieved|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|caitlin: with www.bbotv.com/vugraph you not only see scores of other tables but card by card play with arrows at bottom|pg||
pc|hA|mc|12|nt|pef: both of those things fail, of course, so 6d doesn't make on this lie today|pg||
nt|gavin:  6H may go down a few ways, one is they lead a singleton spade and they get in with the ace of hearts and give a spade ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: thought so|pg||

nt|onebid: don't like Migry's bid|pg||
nt|lml: Migry doesn't know who is saving|pg||
nt|othered1: she's sure not staying fixed|pg||
nt|lml: she knows they have one defensive trick but not sure how many more|pg||
nt|onebid: to quote the old saying Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: and she has a live partner, too.|pg||

pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: but wont with this diamond layout|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: @D10 comes down|pg||
pc|d3|nt|onebid: and the 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|hlortz: with the 10@D falling and A@D doubleton.. easy game :)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

pc|d8|nt|bridge_one: South|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: but at this vulnerability, the opponents are likely bidding to make|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c7|nt|othered1: North knows that partner is very short in @D, so maybve should allow her some room to have gotten into the auction on the shortness.|pg||

nt|henryb: now that is what I call a real 3@d bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: baker is getting ribbing for her lack of spades on that hand, she said "i promised diamonds, not spades"|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb: 5 boards in an hour|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: the other answer is "I thought my @c spot was a @s"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|othered1: this is 10-12 NT position, so no chance of south upgrading|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all the praise aside, what if N had held:  QJx  KQJx  QJxx  JX  ???|pg||
nt|3for3: not for this par|pg||
nt|3for3: pair|pg||
nt|othered1: oops|pg||
nt|3for3: 15-17 throughout|pg||
nt|othered1: Do they upgrade to 1N frequently?|pg||
nt|3for3: jo was close to an upgrade, but she and connie play it has to be a great 14...|pg||
nt|henryb: that is a Great 14|pg||
nt|lml: I agree with Henry|pg||
nt|lml: how much greater can you get|pg||
nt|lml: she only has two spot cards really|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm rarely an upgrader, b ut would consider it here with those nice 10 & 9s|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|othered1: Then would open 1@H|pg||
nt|3for3: the hand looks suit oriented too|pg||
nt|3for3: and nt probably better from partner's side|pg||
nt|lml: it mostly does and it helps on this auction for sure|pg||
mb|2D|nt|cindy:  hey marshall|pg||
nt|henryb: well, Shawn, -130 or -50?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surprised karen did not bid 3H|pg||
nt|cindy:  i would be worried about the Qxx of @s when opening 3@d red|pg||
nt|henryb: I would not. If partner has 5@s she can bid 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: thats only because Connie plays them better :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: Moss down by 79|pg||
nt|pef: lot of imps, although a lot of boards still to go|pg||
nt|andyv:  slight comeback|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|pef: the playoff is 6 segments, also|pg||
nt|caitlin: closed room for playoffs is not up|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: kidding|pg||
nt|reisig: Henry is (again) looking for trouble :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Did Connie have a way to distinguish 4 trumps from 3?|pg||
nt|lml: this looks easy but it isn't totally|pg||
nt|ady: the A10@D doubleton very helpful for declarer  cannot really go down|pg||
nt|lml: However whatever she does on the lie of the cards she will make it|pg||
nt|lml: for that reason|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: If we are going to play a partial, these diamonds should be trump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wouldn;t worry about the spade holding. unlikely that it will matter on offense and it is just one maybe defensive trick. meanwhile, it enhances our likelihood of scoring it on ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: defence|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if pd lacks the D ace, one tap in dummy kills the board. lopsided hands almost always play best in the long suit|pg||
nt|hlortz: in the other room NS sounded so strong that they escaped being doubled in 5@S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pef: everyone agree with 3c?  I like 3h better, myself.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: she might play diamonds fairly early|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jstokes: i would hate not supporting hearts after that start|pg||
nt|andyv:  i prefer pass... seem to have little defence against spades|pg||
nt|pef: 3c would be my third choice after 3h and pass|pg||
nt|pef: deas looking at the vulnerability and the form of scoring|pg||
nt|pef: going to give 4s a lot of thought|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|pef: should be another medium gain for mancuso here unless connie goldberg does something really strange|pg||
nt|gavin:  the best defense will be for palmer to win and lead a low trump, dease can win and lead a low trump back|pg||
nt|gavin:  to preserve their 3 natural trump tricks|pg||
nt|gavin:  if deas cashes ak then they lose one of their tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: or @S jack and west can cash two and still  have the 9 in hand|pg||
nt|gavin:  right|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|ady: bad duck     club switch would have put the contract in jeopardy|pg||
nt|lml: she doesnt know about the @DA10|pg||
nt|andyv:  defence should be easy on this one|pg||
nt|pef: and double wasn't strange|pg||
nt|caitlin: like X??|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: but i would certainly bid 3H as a lead director as W. N could easily be about to bid spades, with a void in diamonds while S holds the ace. then D lead allows N to pitch what might ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: be the crucial loser|pg||
nt|pef: finally, an easy lead for south!|pg||
nt|andyv:  unlucky hand for E/W|pg||
nt|pef: the score in this segment is only 18-6 so far, but every board has been an adventure.  good spectator set so far|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gavin:  suprising play since palmer has qjt9 of diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|pef: if she continues diamonds, an easy down 2|pg||
nt|pef: but it's still down 1, isn't it, losing 3 spades, 2 diamonds and a heart (if she had returned a trump)|pg||
nt|gavin:  she can see how important a trump shift is|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|lml: this is a reasonable line|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb: KISS Marshall. Also, bidding 4@d stops the 3@s bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this would be a very karen-like call, so must conclude they are not playing thjat as a lead director (though i would have bet they were)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: declarer just pulled a wrong card|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i regard 3H as KISS, Henry. it keeps the defense simple|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: director having hard time with ruling|pg||
nt|henryb: It complicates the bidding|pg||
nt|henryb: and that is not a good idea|pg||
nt|reisig: next!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: ah the card she was looking for|pg||
pc|c7|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's interesting in the open room, E/W never got into the auction.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|othered1: I must go.   Thanks everyone -- great presentation -- and bye.|pg||
nt|lml: bye now|pg||
nt|ady: maybe ducking spade was right if leaving a trump out at this stage|pg||
nt|lml: Palmer can only give up the overtrick now|pg||
nt|ady: will play A@C    if tghere is a c lub switch|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|ady: cant risk playing low|pg||
nt|lml: she can't afford to duck with a trump out|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|cindy:  how can it complicate the bidding when S had made a takeout dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  South jumped to 3@c on her 2nd turn.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you have the agreement that 3H in this sequence is lead-directing with support, as i think is common, then it no more complicates the bidding than a double of stayman. but 4D ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: does shut out 3S, true|pg||

nt|lml: those auctions tend to go badly when the adrenal is flowing|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|lml: early in a match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on board 5, East did overcall 1NT, and EW bought 2@H |pg||
nt|onebid: good strategy then|pg||
nt|onebid: 1N-3N|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hlortz: wow i would think either 1@H or 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: surely South didn't pass|pg||

mb|p|nt|hlortz: me :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass by South is a surprise ...|pg||
mb|2D!|an|FG checkback|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but she must have done|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lml: and a very quick spade|pg||
nt|onebid: 3rd best? or attitude?|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: never mind - lead in East:(|pg||
nt|lml: if it was attitude I personally would lead the 7|pg||
nt|lml: a nice ambiguous card|pg||
nt|onebid: sort of - don't ask, don't tell?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt and 4@H both made|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|onebid: next|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually is not a bad idea as a swing bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: especially in a conservative framework to start with|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|lml: a spade lead is one of those you dont need to say your sorry leads|pg||
nt|othered1: may be some overtrick considerations . . . |pg||
nt|fabsayc: main problem is getting to hand to draw trumps|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||

pc|s8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lml: the heart lead is aggressive in a passive sort of way but I would have lead a spade too|pg||
nt|lml: it might be something to do when you are behind in a match|pg||

nt|pef: yes, good play, protect partner from making a mistake.  overtaking a cashing a diamond couldn't hurt|pg||
mb|1D|nt|andyv:  wonder what 2@d opener is for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the problem is that the MAIN thing one cares about at IMPs at this vul is opps bidding and making 4S. and if they have enough to bid FOUR spades over 4D, hardly improbable, then u ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: r going to be wishing u had bid 3H|pg||
nt|jstokes: multi|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cindy:  im sure they have an agreement and she wouldnt just be throwing some ambiguous bid out there|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|gavin:  looks like no games make here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pef: now double makes more sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  hard to stay out of it|pg||
nt|gavin:  north south has the values for game, but with the ace of spades offside and diamonds not breaking|pg||
mb|2D|nt|othered1: Vul game should be bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: director recomanded faster play|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well that just raises the issue of whether 3H over the double SHOULD be lead-directing, which is a different question|pg||
nt|lml: most logical contracts are playable here|pg||
nt|pef: hard to believe it's right for both sides to play 2nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  both sides want to play 2N|pg||
nt|pef: although my team once made 3s at both tables in a swiss team|pg||
nt|caitlin: is it right for E-W?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|hlortz: I'd vote yes, @D support, @H lead.... |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|hlortz: meanwhile a routine 3N here...|pg||

mb|p|nt|pef: I think I would have passed 2n with lynn's hand, what does the panel think?|pg||
nt|caitlin: hearing YES and HORRIBLY WRONG:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  where are the tricks coming from?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: they play this board swiched N with S|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 1D! bid was a bit light, however|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|lml: the old unbid suit lead|pg||
nt|reisig: Estab the @ss|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D, obviously, was forcing, even in partner's suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably 2 way nm|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: 4@H  would have been a reasonable raise after south bid them 3 times    if North had 2 small clubs and Q@S extra   3NT could have problems   |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N had a hard bid over 3H. without club ten, i think 4H semi-clear. club ten complicates things. but if S actually huddled (as well she might) over 3D, then i would bid 4H as N|pg||
nt|ady: not 3 spades    just doubleton   |pg||
nt|3for3: just sell 2 spades now?|pg||
nt|lml: so how do you make 6|pg||
nt|reisig: Looks easy|pg||
nt|lml: 6 or 5|pg||
nt|gavin:  now the defense has to be a little carefull|pg||
nt|pef: seemingly helpful lead for declarer, but still down with a modicum of care|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: The winning team will be USA1 in the Venice Cup (women's World Championships) in Brazil in late August/early September. The loser will get another chance against the winning team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: of a playoff match between the losing semi-finalists. That team will be USA2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Full coverage in the BBO Vugraph Theatre today, Wednesday and Thursday|pg||
nt|3for3: they made 6 in other room when west flew ace on club lead.  |pg||
pc|d2|nt|pef: looks like down 2 if the defense is very careful|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c lead at other table|pg||
pc|d6|nt|caitlin: I figured one round finesse|pg||
nt|caitlin: of T|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I'll enter the result at the end|pg||
nt|andyv:  but float 8 or play 10?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I can't follow it|pg||
nt|caitlin: Valentin do we know what card was played here?|pg||
nt|jstokes: when the bd is switched, very hard to follow the play from the VuGraph operator's stand|pg||
nt|caitlin: np|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jstokes: as we thought|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|reisig: @s 10?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: we might have even more specs if they weren;t playing with full coverage|pg||
nt|lml: okay then 6 hearts 3 diamonds 2 clubs and?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: yes really the ten, is that why lynn pitched a spade?|pg||
nt|reisig: throw low ones ..save high ones...mostly|pg||
nt|lml: so when she leads the 9 if is is ducked she stays in dummy|pg||
nt|lml: and it doesnt matter|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gavin:  Deas could have afforded a club pitch as well|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|cindy:  lol|pg||
nt|gavin:  when palmer played the QC at trick one, Deas became aware that declarer has AJ of clubs,|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|reisig: I'll stop looking|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: if the Q@S is wrong  could go down on this line   I think cashing just 2 hearts  and playing spades is better|pg||
nt|lml: what a pretty sight for declarer|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|3for3: brb switching computers|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in answer to questions from specs about why i would choose 4H if S huddled over 3H, it is for bend-over-backward ethical reasons|pg||
nt|reisig: I've heard that excuse before|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the most likely reason for a huddle by S over 3H is that she has some club help and was thinking of bidding 3NT|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: when the auction goes 1N-3N, we owe the gallery a little diversion|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gavin:  discarding a club would have the same affect as an encouraging spade|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|gavin:  so if u are in a situation like this, where your spot cards in spades would be decieving to partner|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gavin:  u might find a more descriptive discard outside of hte suit that you want to give partner a signal in|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|gavin:  here partner will know not to play hearts or diamonds|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gavin:  so if you throw away a club, inferentially partner will realize you want spades played|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 3NT by south|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not easy though, except for an optimist about clubs running|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt also by North ,,, the problem is 5@C down !|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes with J@C dropping 3N good otherwise down a lot maybe...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: test|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not inconceivable that NS will get to a slam here|pg||

nt|bridge_one:  A Q in @H and K in @D bad placed give impossible to make also game in @C - inverted disposition instead South make Slam |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lml: how many do you open in first seat?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@s|pg||
nt|onebid: 1 or 3|pg||

nt|lml: But I can understand 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: depends on who's at the table|pg||
nt|lml: now it is easy to bid spades|pg||
nt|othered1: aupgrading to a 14-16 opening?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|onebid: they play Precision|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|onebid: and she has 3 tens|pg||
nt|lml: the double is oviously just cards|pg||
nt|othered1: card says 14-16 in this position.  10-12 favorable 1-2-3 pos. 15-17 4th.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt is a bid made to play Nt fron the right site|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: thirteen of them....|pg||
nt|onebid: close enough|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, 3NT should go clattering off|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gets fuzzy from here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C for any pairs isn't forcing - for N/S instead is forcing of course|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: Nice to have that double available|pg||
nt|hlortz: will get too high....|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C or 3@H by South after 3@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite playable to play 2@C followed by 3@C as GF|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|lml: I am not sure they are playing 10-12.  I think eaarlier Berkowitz opened 15 or something like that 1NT|pg||
nt|onebid: 14-16 Linda|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H my choice|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|hlortz: especially if 1! D-3@C is invitational|pg||
nt|hlortz: er 1@D-3@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: exactly|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but with 8 @C and strong hand south think to have chance to play slam .... for this reason choise 4@C|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lml: that makes sense|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: arggh this is not a blackwood hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4Nt i think natural, non encouraging bid (otherwise North could havbe the possibility to make a cuebid|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hlortz: shows alert 2keycards + Q@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: right|pg||
nt|hlortz: 4@C was keycard in @C|pg||
pc|c5|nt|othered1: Variable NT, see above.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: about the only practical chance is to cross to a club and lead @DQ |pg||
nt|fabsayc: one slight chance and she better do it quick|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|onebid: play for stiff J@D|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the decision is close anyway, and i would be glad to bid 4H to prevent any hint of unconscious influence|pg||
nt|pef: a bit hard to predict where this one will end up|pg||
nt|pef: another really good slam|pg||
nt|gavin:  another difficult slam, with north sout having 6 club tricks 5 hearts and the Ace of spades|pg||
nt|gavin:  27 pointer|pg||
nt|pef: yes and deas might get to open 2s here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: but it might take a while to get there :)|pg||
nt|gavin:  if north chooses to open 1H, I would 2/1 with south hand|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|lml: don't you love it that it is close|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has an automatic opener for me, but many would pass|pg||
nt|pef: nope, wasn't sure if they played 2s and spades and a minor|pg||
mb|2C|nt|caitlin: 2@H doubled in open|pg||
nt|andyv:  just what South wanted to hear|pg||
mb|2H|an|Michaels|nt|reisig: 6@c seems a stretch|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: jo just looked at me and smiled ... she is thinking of other hand i think|pg||
nt|lml: none of these players would pass North's hand.  It is not the fashion|pg||
nt|pef: might get there after that start, don't you think?|pg||
nt|gavin:  i dont see how|pg||
nt|gavin:  north doesnt have enough clubs to raise|pg||
nt|andyv:  simple raise to 3@c may get them there|pg||
mb|3C|nt|henryb: 4@s seems a little much to me|pg||
nt|hlortz: how many @S would you bid as south? 4 seems a bit much....|pg||
nt|gavin:  unfortunately you cant raise 2C to 3C here with only 3 card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4S seems like a lot to bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ashamed of her opening....:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: ty|pg||

mb|3H|nt|henryb: Me, I would bid 1, or 3|pg||

nt|henryb: Back up Cheryl|pg||
nt|lml: is that right?|pg||
nt|lml: sorry GOldberg|pg||
nt|lml: she can't be 4-4-4-1|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c-3@h-3N?|pg||
nt|lml: and she isn't balanced|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: the room just erupted in laughter|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, on a beautiful platinum setting|pg||
nt|lml: I hope they have figured this out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is it RKC this time?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: and jo passed me a note saying "i bet we get it right this time"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe it is only on over 2H :)|pg||
nt|ady: reverse the e/w red suit cards   6@C ok|pg||
nt|reisig: This is not the hand for ace asking|pg||
nt|henryb: you can't go slamming when partner can open that hand|pg||
nt|gavin:  as 2C doesnt promise a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|pef: you can't but she did :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and now 3@s seemed more pressing for S|pg||
mb|4C|nt|marlowepi: having the ace of your suit means you shd generally not preempt to the max|pg||
nt|henryb: that is an interesting theory|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: surely 4s now?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|marlowepi: also the S hand has a LOT of losers, and stiff heart king is a better defensive than offensive value|pg||
nt|pef: seems like this will just make.  going to lose a heart, a spade, a spade ruff, and 2 clubs, I think|pg||
nt|gavin:  4D by south confirmed a spade control|pg||
nt|andyv:  having control in both outside suits, seems a good time for rkc|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  since wittis didnt cuebid 3S, quinn needed to have one when she bid 4D|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, partner hasn;t PROMISED the hand is this bad|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|pef: nicely done (unless of course pam bids 7)|pg||
nt|gavin:  right or 6H|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: Michael Rosenberg points out wryly that their results with RKC were better when they had a misunderstanding about it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: that is a lovely comment|pg||
nt|ady: will gain 2 imps    |pg||
nt|reisig: Bid a terrible slam ..go down --win 2 IMPS!   Nice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam still live on vienna coup double squeeze|pg||
nt|pef: right|pg||
nt|gavin:  6H deas would get to double for the lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pef: and the lead shifts back to mancuso|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|henryb: declarer here has 6 winners. to me that means you preempt 3, not 4 at equal vulnerability|pg||
nt|andyv:  and then the ultimate mp result of 6N:)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: lots of exceptions, and i typed it a bit quickly. what i mean is that when you are deciding between, say, 3 & 4, having the ace is a liability for the more aggressive preempt|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hlortz: the fortunate lie lets declarer out for down 2 but the opponents cant really make anything|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@d seems about their maximum|pg||
nt|gavin:  ya maybe in this spot shed be better off passing and hoping palmer could count the clubs|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pef: specs want to know if we would have balanced with the west hand|pg||
nt|pef: I think I would have bid 2d.  anybody else?|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  not my choice... too light of hand|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another point is that your suit is spades, and 3S may do all the preempting that needs to be done--4S might just force the opps ionto a winning decision. meanwhile, if opps bid 4H ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over yr 3S, partner will be very well placed to make the winning decision|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  if pd can't act over 2@c, where are we going?|pg||
nt|jstokes: close -- 2@D could find a good fit but pass seems reasonable as well|pg||
nt|pef: see, its the men who have become cowards and then women aggressive bidders these days|pg||
pc|s5|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least hearts should behave after this... unlikely Lynn has 12 cards in the unbid suits|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|henryb: she actually can make it from there: @dA and eight rounds of clubs would provide a double squeeze|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hlortz: yes here 3@S might get the opponents overboard via dbl from west|pg||
nt|lml: no you cant|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: I must be blind; I can't see it|pg||
nt|henryb: but I suppose the diamond finesse looked like a better shot|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lml: Deas just keeps the @HQ and the S!J|pg||
nt|lml: she doesnt need to keep diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb: @hK, @dA, @cAK and 6 more clubs|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hlortz: interestingly here W would double any   of spades 1, 2, 3 or 4|pg||
nt|henryb: In the other room Sanborn bid a quiet 1@s and subsided. E-W playing 3@d|pg||
nt|henryb: bidding 3@s would probably get you a plus score against 4@d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S preempts against us are among our worst bidding nightmares. whenever 3N is a possibility you have to commit immediately. and of course there are other ways that 3S can be ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: awkward. too many balls in play and no room to explore. but when they bid 4S u just shrug & double. something it is not best double-dummy, but the agony factor is minimized. that ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is another reason why in general 3S is a better tactical weapon that 4S on these "borderline" preempot hands|pg||
nt|henryb: they taking a break?|pg||
nt|henryb: 1 hour 10 minutes for 8 boards is not breaking any speed records|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes but faster than yesterday when they had played 6 boards in 1 hr 20 min|pg||
nt|cindy:  was super slo mo|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the cards were stuck together?|pg||
nt|cindy:  20 min to play a part score for an overtrick was a little much|pg||
nt|henryb: Beth Palmer took 16 minutes to play a card yesterday|pg||

nt|lml: a club or a diamond work not too bad but I think it might be cold anyway|pg||
nt|onebid: hard to find 7 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|othered1: as typical of tight IN contracts, lots of decisions for both sides|pg||
nt|lml: north south have 3 hearts, 2 spades a club and a diamond or two|pg||
nt|onebid: yes, frequently easier to play 3 than 1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's 10:30 pm here in England - this qualifies as a beer-from-the-fridge hand |pg||

nt|cindy:  lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all we said was that the slam was still alive at trick two|pg||

nt|henryb: I only said she could make it, not that she should|pg||

mb|p|nt|jstokes: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: lucky 4s on this hand, not clear if they will get there, thought|pg||

mb|1C|nt|cindy:  im not naming names about the 20 min part score|pg||
nt|henryb: no, it was trick 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  then again, i would have opened the N hand 1@s|pg||
nt|pef: I'm not all that crazy about 2s on the north hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: Still 6@C was very ambitious on that hand|pg||
nt|pef: I agree, 2s with that much combined defense/offense seems wrong, especialy nv|pg||
mb|d|nt|jstokes: 1@S seems reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: aree|pg||
mb|2C|nt|henryb: you see what I mean about aggressive openings?|pg||
nt|gavin:  you will lose your 5-3 spade fit by doubling, because if you double and bid spades it will show a big hand which you dont have|pg||

nt|hlortz: opening that E hand VUL is a style... opinions?|pg||

nt|henryb: yucch|pg||
nt|lml: If North-South don't get into the auction then East-West should win some imps here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ambitious is good. the slam had adequate play single dummy|pg||
nt|reisig: Big swing coming here|pg||
nt|lml: after the lead of the @HA|pg||
nt|pef: mike rosenberg gives pass 100, 1s 80, and 2s 20|pg||
nt|pef: michael, I mean, not mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: sorry, 2s 60|pg||
nt|pef: another well known spec thinks anything other than 1s is a zero|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: thought for a moment both sides were going to be playing 1nt|pg||
nt|gavin:  this way typically you will still find your heart fit, here they were turned off by the negative double |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cindy:  i open light but thats a little much for me|pg||
nt|hlortz: thats the polite version of my opinion :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  and have opps play in a poor contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  other table, W dbld. the 1@C bid|pg||
pc|h2|nt|caitlin: open room in 4@S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: I am just not that ambitious|pg||
nt|lml: so how do North-South get into this auction.  In the other room they opened 3@C|pg||
nt|henryb: gotta go. bye|pg||
nt|lml: it isn't my style to do that but white on red is a green flag|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i can see opening 2C if playing a forcing club. but 3C seems like trying to hit a vanishingly narrow target|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   hav e a save in 4@S       north opened 3@C  in OR  so n/s never contested in spades   but e/w pushed thenselves to the 5 levedl  and a spade lead beat the contract|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lml: some specs think I should have said a red flag|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gavin:  south had a tough decision about whether to rebid her clubs or bid 1NT|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|lml: the other way might be if the South hand bid over 1NT.  I wouldn't but there is the school that you have to disturb notrump|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|gavin:  this hand will be very difficult|pg||
pc|c5|nt|henryb: If she foes after @d, will probably make it. If after @h, probably one down|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|reisig: Is there a sanity school?|pg||
nt|gavin:  she knows that palmer has a singleton spade|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: for me, the E hand is only the 10-9 of diamonds away from an opening. LTC is right, playability in 3 suits including both majors, and i would be bidding the suit i probably want ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: led. with these ratty spots, though, i would pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that school is usually in session at Matchpoints|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|robinswr: notice that opening 3clubs (preempt unless it makes you sick) wins 12 IMPs|pg||

nt|othered1: couldn't east have @CK109|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: something is going....the match|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in other room East open 1@D, so South could overcall at 1@S ofr 4@S by the partner |pg||

nt|marlowepi: right like making 3C when cold for 7S, as Michael R points out|pg||
nt|robinswr: the preempt gave EW a problem. Notice that even Novice pairs would end up in 4hearts and make it|pg||
nt|ady: an easy 3NT for n/s  here   can see no reason to bid above game level|pg||
nt|reisig: one reason...makes 6|pg||
nt|lml: the old Bob Hammon slam|pg||
nt|robinswr: i wonder if palmer will open 2diamonds (multi showing a weak 2 in spades|pg||
nt|lml: that seems a bit hungry to me vulnerable|pg||
nt|ady: 5-3-3-2   shape    vul    not my cup of tea |pg||
nt|robinswr: what i'm saying is that preempts change the opponents bids from scientific to judgement|pg||
nt|robinswr: non-vul it would be clear|pg||
nt|lml: or you go for 800 if they just hit you|pg||
nt|robinswr: what's worse is when you preempt and it goes all pass|pg||
nt|lml: that was the risk on the previous 3@C bid|pg||
nt|lml: if this hand gets passed out in 2@S it probably isn't too bad|pg||
nt|robinswr: One should not let outside 4-card majors deter you from preempting|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that depends who the "one" is|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: cannot argue with those who would pass even with AT9x of diamonds. for the record, though there are obvious dangers of opening hands like this, it is not rare to find partner with, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: say, AQxxxx of clubs and another ace (or king where u have the ace). then opening brings in 12 IMPs. obviously, though, there are less happy endings possible...|pg||
nt|lml: you say that but it never works for me.  |pg||
nt|lml: We are guaranteed to be cold for game in the major|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or did you mean, when we are playing against you :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: if 2spades gets passed out, partner has an opening bid with a singleton spade|pg||
nt|pef: "kings are not that good offense to open light at the 1-level.  So pass will lead to a better auction, usually.  Here p 1c 1s 2c, 3nt is possible.|pg||

nt|andyv:  any stayman bidders?|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|pef: 4s looks playable, although the 4-1 break might leave declarer a trick short|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would think if E had bid stayman 2@S would have ended auction|pg||
nt|jstokes: and if west had passed, they would have found spades after a TO double of hearts|pg||
nt|caitlin: and if the Queen had........she'd be a King:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  a crown?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Vugraphu8: ew play 3/5 vs nt|pg||
nt|robinswr: best play for a safe overtrick is to lead a club to the 8|pg||

nt|lml: thats fairly unusual.  A lot of people who play 3/5 vs suits play 4th or attitude versus nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  interesting quinn definitely wants to play in hearts even if her partner has only a singleton|pg||
nt|gavin:  the fewer trumps partner has, the more important it is to play in hearts|pg||
nt|gavin:  because her dummy will prove useless in 3nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb: you might well make 3N on the E-W cards|pg||
nt|gavin:  1n - 3n ?|pg||
nt|pef: a routine 3nt? although little has been routine tonight|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Peter, reserved only for overcalls:)|pg||
nt|pef: 4h is probably the normal contract here|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: heavy favorite|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c apparently a transfer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the double greatly improves the W hand for 3NT purposes|pg||
nt|hlortz: so W may bid 3N with the big @D fit|pg||
nt|gavin:  they did wiel to take 11 tricks in the other room|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gavin:  10 or 11|pg||
nt|gavin:  diamond lead gives 10, the need to do some business to find 11th|pg||
mb|d|nt|hlortz: or not|pg||
nt|ady: expensive save in OR |pg||
nt|lml: its tempting to bid now when it looks like your side might have the cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not clear the hand belongs to you|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could easily be an EW misfit with E having a good hand|pg||
nt|lml: you just don't know and you are worried partner doesn't have the right shape to bid|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you are long in opponents suit you should be conservative (AJx when opponents opened 2spades is long|pg||
nt|ady: expensive  especially when 4@S will go down|pg||
nt|lml: thats a good point |pg||
nt|robinswr: if they opened 2hearts it would make more sense to bid 3diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: but they are unlikely to get too high anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont see a reason not to bid 3D here. that doesnt commit u to much|pg||
nt|lml: Goldberg may bid because she almost has a diamond strait|pg||
nt|lml: straight|pg||
nt|lml: but I think she will pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if E has a good hand, double into game is not likely|pg||
nt|ady: either way  is on to a good rfesult|pg||
nt|ady: result|pg||
nt|andyv:  and there you are!|pg||
nt|pef: very well, one might guess a defensive slip somewhere along the line|pg||
nt|pef: really aggressive woolsey type double|pg||
nt|pef: four card major and a longer minor|pg||
mb|3N|nt|robinswr: she has 3spades and partner who is problably short did not bid|pg||
nt|pef: but continues the trend of  nothing is routine|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I am sure that is why she finally passed|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@SX making|pg||
nt|pef: another easy one to play, I would think|pg||
nt|caitlin: board 42 open room|pg||
nt|pef: I was watching a little bit, kit woolsey seemed to think it should be beaten|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: back soon|pg||
nt|robinswr: since 2spades showed heart values  sprung did not want to lead one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: (a) when S passed she did not know which suit W had  (b) there is not much danger in a delayed 3D. and sometimes pd can bid a game|pg||
nt|robinswr: they need lots of overtricks to get to 800|pg||
nt|robinswr: partner could have an opening bid with 3spades, and 3nt would be makable|pg||
nt|caitlin: he changed his mind|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|pef: not quite sure what the harm was in playing a heart to dummy and taking a spade finesse, but I guess the double really convinced her the k of spades was offside|pg||
nt|othered1: that play doesn't seem very routine, either|pg||
nt|gavin:  no big deal|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  play pd for k@c|pg||
nt|gavin:  she thought ks was offside|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||

pc|hK|pc|d7|pc|c3|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s9|nt|caitlin: Kit says yes it should have been beaten but timing very tricky|pg||
nt|andyv:  pulled only one round of spades and was able to cash two diamonds without South ruffing, the x ruffed|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably defence needed to be able to lead 2 rounds of trump|pg||

nt|hlortz: a low scoring set so far 19-9 after 12 no explosive boards....|pg||

nt|bridge_one: yes, agree - bec AK AK and k in @H are better to play @H instead Nt|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|gavin:  tough hand to lead from |pg||
nt|gavin:  different people feel differently|pg||
mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: 1D is the "normal" bid on the N hand, but i hate opening in my weakest suit. would be wistful to open 1S or 1N. but of course those have downsides too|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S an unlikely spot   OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: as so many, Duinn and Wittes play 3@c shous a good club suit and less than a game force|pg||
nt|pef: oops|pg||
nt|andyv:  dn 2|pg||
nt|gavin:  wow deas 3H bid, either she is trying to offer 3nt, or she is an extremely aggressive slam bidder|pg||
nt|gavin:  3h here i assume showed a spade fit|pg||
nt|gavin:  i am guessing since lynne's trumps are so bad|pg||
nt|gavin:  she wants to try to escape to 3nt|pg||
nt|pef: with most people would be unbalanced try in spades, but not here, obviously|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hlortz: both pairs passed up the weak 4 card @S suit,,,|pg||
nt|cindy:  this could be doomed|pg||
nt|henryb: when South chooses to surpress the spades there is no way to find the suit|pg||
nt|cindy:  tough to find @d switch i guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am quite certain that at the table i would open 1S with that hand|pg||
nt|hlortz: seems like someone ought to bid the @S suit....|pg||
nt|henryb: It is hard after N opens 1@d|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: different points of view. for me it is the hand with 100 honors that is responsible for mentioning spades, not the hand with four small, when the latter has AKQxxx of another suit|pg||
nt|hlortz: 7@H lead because of weak suit. they probably play attitude vs NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: But was a most interesting contract which could have been made after a low club lead|pg||
nt|pef: need to quickly exchange the 10 of clubs with a spot in declarer's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 4@H is the superior game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4H is interesting too|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  well  this looks like a hand where you need to get your tricks quickly|pg||
pc|c5|nt|othered1: this is a position where it's possible for south to underlead an ace, which east will consider, then reject.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: i prefer 3S over 3C unless that would show club support|pg||
nt|lml: 4@H is not as "interesting" as 4@S|pg||
nt|gavin:  i would dsay this is not a situation where its possible|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: 3NT is also interesting|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|gavin:  you wouldnt underlead an ace into the strong nt bidder|pg||
nt|pef: possible, but awfully unlikely into the teeth of the nt opener|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|ady: Q@D lead seems best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: am not a fan of the spade lead from that holding. the major suit holdings in the N hand suggest a passive defense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would probably lead a club, through dummy;s shorter suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamond will be ducked and helps declarer establish dummy;s long suit|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|andyv:  cash out time |pg||
nt|gavin:  theh time you would underlead an ace is when dummy is the hand which is strong|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb: perhaps 3rd from even?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: i dont really understand the queen of hearts play holding four|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes could be 3rd/even tho more common vs suits than NT...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphu8: baker accidentally led 7 hts instead of 5, they play 4th best|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah thanks|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: mccallum says she would have shifted to diam if correct ht had been led|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so both defenders played accidental cards|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|othered1: That a more obvious case|pg||

mb|2D|mb|3S|nt|lml: 3@D will be it I still think|pg||

nt|onebid: I think it's a difficult choice and partnership agreements make the difference. I can't criticize either|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rather decent of East to hold @SQ10x|pg||
nt|lml: if Moss bids 4@C here she might push Glasson|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: now baker says she needs to stop sorting her hand, so she will play right cards|pg||

nt|lml: maybe 4@S is best ... just go for it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially when all you remember is the good results :)|pg||
nt|lml: of course there is the uncertainty of what suit Palmer has|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2aces outside 4-card majors all ok with me|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the other room West was quiet from start to finish; that's not winning bridge in my book|pg||
nt|robinswr: i think 3spades is a cuebid in support of hearts|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S making a poor result for Maricuso in OR     difficult defence to beat it    but e/w should play 5 of a minor    likely down 1|pg||
nt|lml: everyone thinks 4@s is a splinter and 3@s is a cuebid|pg||
nt|3for3:  4@d should be the cuebid|pg||
nt|onebid: not everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: not finals. Glasson tm is 109/7 in 1st playoff|pg||
nt|robinswr: sprung should have passed and found out opener's suit|pg||
nt|lml: lots of specs.  Goldberg and Sprung are unfamiliar with multi and I think this is making it worse|pg||
nt|pef: the loss isn't going to be as big as expected.  e/w are in 2c doubled in the other room which will probably be +280 e/w|pg||

mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: welcome to richie reisig|pg||
nt|reisig: hiya all :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi richie|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: was not a joke|pg||
nt|reisig: Hi Cindy :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  :)|pg||
nt|gavin:  yeah i like inviting on that hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  QJTx and QJTxx in the majors are great holdings|pg||
nt|gavin:  plus i am a huge fan of 5422|pg||
nt|pef: will she now accept her own try?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  i think palmer was close to an accept|pg||
nt|gavin:  if the JD was the JC|pg||
nt|gavin:  she showed 11-13|pg||
nt|gavin:  and has a nice doubleton, and aces|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|pef: yeah, four trumps and a doubleton heart, probably would have accepted vul.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk4: They had better prepare a defence then, because they will see a lot of Multi's in Brazil|pg||
nt|gavin:  this hand fit quite badly, her doubleton was useless|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The winning team will be USA1 in the Venice Cup (women's World Championships) in Brazil in late August/early September. The loser will get another chance against the winning team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: of a playoff match between the losing semi-finalists. That team will be USA2|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|lml: now Goldberg is thinking thank you for not passing out 3@H|pg||
nt|robinswr: would goldberg lead a club from K98|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Should she have dropped the stiff kong on that lead? Not sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: king even|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stiff King Kong? Fay Wray in this event?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|lml: Dropping the stiff king is out of my league|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|robinswr: when they make that lead the king should be dropped|pg||
nt|lml: still a great score for East-West who won the board right after Sprung bid 3@H|pg||
nt|gavin:  here if quinn had a higher spade|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|gavin:  she might think of playing a low heart hoping her partner can win the trick and play a diamond for her to ruff high|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|s7|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|gavin:  its looking to be very difficult to beat this contract, that might have been her last hope, but here with the 5S being her highest spade she can see its impossible|pg||
mc|9|nt|cindy:  that last hand was the most exciting one we have had i believe :-)|pg||
nt|cindy:  sominex hands|pg||
nt|hlortz: one of our bigger swings 2 whole IMPs here|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: made 4 - corrected the movie|pg||

nt|onebid: 8 spades?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: fourteen on top|pg||
nt|othered1: LOts and lots of tricks here and 7 should be attainable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't remember such a set on BBO before with so many dead-flat boards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nine!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: it would be a lot more interesting if East was the dealer|pg||
nt|onebid: Xfer then GSF|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N and north probably won't let go, if she can find little @D wastage in south's hand.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: but that is just it, most of them where not necissarily flat|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hlortz: glasson team likes flat boards ; moss not so much|pg||
nt|bridge_one: nine perfectly flat boards arn't frequently|pg||
nt|fabsayc: easily 100 imps either way|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|hlortz: yes many swings possible|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bridge_one: 4@H for N/S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mnay would have been tempted to open as South|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: GSF?  Couldn't they be off an ace?|pg||
nt|lml: exclusion blackwood|pg||
nt|lml: is my thinking|pg||
nt|onebid: yes - need agreements on responses|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a useful tool here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would open, for example :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|onebid: you'd have to put a gun to my head to get me to play that hideous convention|pg||
nt|lml: the double makes Migry's decision easier|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't like double - gives the opponents so much more room - two extra  bids (pass and redouble) |pg||
mb|3H|nt|lml: as it turns out regular blackwood will show you all the KC|pg||
nt|othered1: XX part of a convensional set of responses?|pg||
nt|othered1: conventional|pg||
nt|lml: if 5@d is KC then redouble is probably ROPI|pg||
nt|onebid: 1st round control my guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: aces are good |pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 4@H for sure .... NOT !|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|othered1: I've seen these confused by top pairs, though they shouldn't be.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i thought South would choise 4@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: she may wish she had done|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D in 3th position can be weaker that a normal open|pg||
nt|fabsayc: third seat opener syndrome|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this may be 10 more to Glasson|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the 4@H response took up quite a bit of room too   |pg||
nt|lml: it always looks easier when you are not playing the hand|pg||
nt|onebid: It's for that reason I so dislike exclusion - so many disasters!|pg||
nt|othered1: did something go wrong with system or is this just a very conservative decision by north?|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: sorry answering spectator|pg||
nt|onebid: I guess the former|pg||
nt|lml: I think the redouble showed the first step|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I would put money on system - if 5@D is erkcb, then North can bid 5N for side kings - South bids 6@C |pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: redouble was the wrong answer as per Silvia|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think north could have made decision to play 6 so quickly if there was solid ageement on sequence |pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|onebid: well, Sylvia may have mis-answered, but it happens way too often|pg||
nt|lml: Spectators keep asking.  I don't redouble showed the D!A|pg||
nt|lml: @SA|pg||
nt|lml: sorry typos|pg||
nt|lml: @DA|pg||
nt|lml: partner said they had a diamond void|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes 2s is no risk|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|h2|pg||

nt|hlortz: yes it was the most complicated hand so far|pg||
nt|marlowepi: next hand is the last one|pg||
nt|lml: sorry 2@H I thanks|pg||
nt|pef: both tables playing the same board,  unusual to have both in sync like this|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|reisig: But -- not terribly hard to reach 7 of some strain|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  another part score battle|pg||
nt|othered1: many players can bid a forcing one round 2@C here, but styles vary greatly.|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: With 14 top tricks one would assume that it is easy to bid a grand slam, but it was a 13 IMP swing to Glasson in the playoff match|pg||
nt|ady: will reach same contract as OR    11 tricks a good result|pg||
nt|pef: everyone has probably worked it out by now, but deas and palmer play a strong club system where 1d can be as few as one (or maybe even zero)|pg||
nt|jstokes: Palmer-Deas don't cater to these hands with short diamonds; their 1@D opening promises at least none|pg||
nt|pef: not too much of a battle given the relative assets|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|robinswr: i play support doubles here so 2hearts shows 4|pg||
nt|3for3:  so do they|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  5@d ?|pg||
nt|pef: 3h seems a bit aggressive to me even though she was limited by the failure to open 1c|pg||
nt|pef: especially after the 1s rebid|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl seems awkward|pg||
nt|pef: north might have tried a double after 2 of a minor|pg||
nt|pef: clearly double by them just shows values|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cindy:  yep|pg||
nt|hlortz: exclusion |pg||
nt|henryb: exclusion KCB|pg||
nt|hlortz: asking for keycards outside @D|pg||
nt|jstokes: and this is a bit uncomfortable for Palmer|pg||
nt|gavin:  yeah everyones made their best bid so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: 2@H in open|pg||
nt|gavin:  palmer goes low because of their system|pg||
nt|andyv:  and who needs a stopper in opps suit?|pg||
nt|pef: but unless 2c is game forcing, not quite clear to me why you wouldn't bid 2c|pg||
nt|gavin:  in standard they would likely end up in 2nt|pg||
nt|pef: with neither having a heart stopper?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hlortz: sry echo|pg||
nt|cindy:  5N now and piece of cake|pg||
nt|henryb: 0 or 3, and N will take a chance on 3|pg||
nt|reisig: I always need my fingers to figure out the response|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  the negative double gave deas the inference that 1nt wasnt the right place to play the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: oops|pg||
nt|cindy:  ruhrow|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we want to thank our splendid operator Cheryl Mandala for her crisp and informative work at the controls. Many thanks to the USBF, under the able guidance of Jan Martel, for making ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this broadcast possible. Kudos galore to this crack team of commentators, who kept me from making this broadcast impossible--Cindy Marshall, Henry Bethe, Henry Lortz, and in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: late-inning relief, Richie Reisig|pg||
nt|hlortz: as cindy said 5n, 6@C to show k@C and 7|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: anyone understand what's going on?|pg||
nt|andyv:  E/W|pg||
nt|gavin:  palmer assumed that since quinn never raised that they likely had a stopper|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems if immediate 2@c is forcing, then dbl followed by 2@c would not be|pg||
nt|pef: but why didn't deas pass 1nt?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb: I would not, since partner could have xx QJx AKJx Kxx|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So a 13 IMP swing in this match too|pg||
nt|henryb: or something like that|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: 5s showed only 1 kc by agreement|pg||
nt|reisig: Like I said ...need fingers|pg||

nt|marlowepi: reincarnation|pg||
nt|cindy:  shouldnt it be 5N (2) ?|pg||
nt|henryb: yes|pg||
nt|reisig: of course|pg||
nt|cindy:  thingws have gone awry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and much gratitude to our terrific specs for their perceptive comments and trenchant questions. especially when they agree with me|pg||
nt|andyv:  and @s back|pg||
nt|othered1: well, west did have a real @D suit and had promised none (though probably has some on this auction)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cindy:  thx to the spec that woke me up to that|pg||
nt|lml: interesting play by Deas.  A spade seemed automatic for a lot of players|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hlortz: you found someone to agree with you.? LOL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i use a second account for that purpose, henry|pg||
nt|cindy:  thx all   :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: baker wistfully wanted to be able to dbl 5d to suggest save, but agreement is asks for club lead|pg||
nt|henryb: one more board, no?|pg||
nt|cindy:  ohhh|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  10@s?|pg||
nt|gavin:  because palmer didnt bid 1NT directly over 1H|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|andyv:  don't like the openin lead|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|gavin:  negative double denied 4S in their system, |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pef: well after that lead, this one is going to be a push|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: nice try|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pef: ah, right|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: spade unlikely to help on any lie of cards, i think|pg||
nt|jstokes: so a quiet down 1|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|gavin:  which is a minor suit value showing bid (typically she has a hand that couldnt bid 1NT)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: it helps when partner has the @SA anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as it is in dummy...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|lml: oh sorry I am playing from the wrong side :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h6|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|h3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|gavin:  the slow 1NT was to protect against deas having like 4432 or 4342 where they have no fit|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h5|nt|lml: remember Laugh-In ... never mind|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|othered1: I can't make exclusion RKC work for me.  Perhaps because I can't make simple RKC work, either.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: no indeed - 55:0 shutout so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: maybe you should always double in that auction just for practice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT-2@h-2@S-3@s as FG works quite well as you can cue-bid below game|pg||
nt|hlortz: thanks to the fellow commentators and all the specs....|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|bridge_one: can duck with this disposition of HC in @C|pg||

nt|lml: I might adapt that agreement|pg||

nt|bridge_one: but 1Nt is hard|pg||

nt|pef: I guess he can just draw trumps and take 10 tricks with spades 3-2|pg||
nt|andyv:  she too|pg||
nt|pef: 4 spades, one ruff, ace of clubs, 2 diamonds and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|pef: yes, she, also :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|caitlin: as in US WWWWWWWWW BC:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  is it that easy to make 4?|pg||
nt|caitlin: if North goes about ruffing clubs NO|pg||
nt|pef: yes, 4 spades, ace of clubs, one club ruff, 2 diamonds, and 2 hearts, just has to be a bit careful.  but win this play 3 rounds of trumps and lead the k of diamonds|pg||
nt|caitlin: or ducks and innocent looking heart comes back|pg||
nt|andyv:  other table had a problem|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jstokes: wow|pg||
nt|pef: they went down in the open room, apparently nobody believes in trumps splitting 3-2|pg||
nt|jstokes: yep, she didn't draw trumps and when the heart finese lost, the def got a heart ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  if she draws trump, doesn't she lose 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|pef: actually karen mccallum played it.  won the club played j of diamonds to the ace, heart back finesse, ruff|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|pef: no, draw trumps and lead the k of diamonds|pg||
pc|h4|nt|reisig: short break ...to discuss excl Blackwood responses|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pef: ruff a club, pitch one on the long diamonds, heart finesse or heart and heart.  easy game|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, W can't get in to cash club|pg||
nt|pef: that doesn't matter|pg||
nt|pef: you still have a trump in the north hand to take care of a club even if it could be played|pg||
nt|andyv:  only matters if E started with 4 clubs|pg||
nt|pef: no, doesn't andy, even if he had a club when he won the k of hearts north would still have a trump left and be out of clubs|pg||
nt|andyv:  you are right....dyslexia strikes again!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: the diamond is a judo play in a way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and thanks to Mother Nature for creating women, so that we could have this event to watch|pg||
