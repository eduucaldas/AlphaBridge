nt|nigel_k:  Two solid results for Cope to start then|pg||

nt|yo_yo: Scotland are doing well|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is Mike Ash Scottish?  He used to play for Manchester|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, he moved to Scotland some years ago|pg||
nt|iain sime: Mike Ash has sensibly converted to Scottish. He played in Beijing last year.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: Czerniewski taking his time ...|pg||
nt|iain sime: Is Gunnar Hallberg English?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||

nt|yo_yo: what nationality is Czerniewshi?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: possible for n/s to reach 4@S      very bad split|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: yes, I've told Michael already and he will fix when he gets chance!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/seniorcamrosetms.htm  for most of the system cards|pg||

nt|yo_yo: everyone comes to England! (except Ash)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: west led a trump but i would think you can still get away with just losing 1 heart, @DK, 3 spades, surely|pg||
nt|don paulus: quite a start !|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Ed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: East put an end to a spade contract    seems double from Saisbury would be take-out|pg||
nt|sheila a: It's not common to play penalty doubles in this situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: may try a link to dummy|pg||

nt|bobholl: hi all :) sry for being late|pg||
nt|athene: yes the club lead is better for the defence|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer may lose 4 spades playing from his hand|pg||
nt|ady: contract seems no problem|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead  would have been much better for defence|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|s3|nt|bobholl: may be costfull 8 of @S|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: more reason to play upside down carding, folks :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed; one should not give count at all costs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or as Bill says: play udca|pg||
nt|sheila a: Ah. I wonder if N needed to put in the 10@c|pg||
nt|ady: maybe diamond switch is in time|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: needs to play ace|pg||
nt|sheila a: This is actually a tricky hand to play and defend|pg||
nt|ady: then diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: he's got his finger on the ace|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to John Murchan|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|Walddk4: In the Camrose Trophy and Lady Milne (women), the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland play as separate entities, unlike other international competitions where the Irish Bridge ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Union sends one team to represent the island of Ireland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Six teams are taking part in this event. The sixth spot goes to the host, this year England. They are represented by two teams: England and The Patron|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Shirley Ybarra from D.C.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sheila a: Morning, Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm and tx Roland |pg||
nt|ady: problem now    the hearts are all good   east should have discarded a spade rather than a heart|pg||
nt|ady: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|toobad: good agternoon all|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|toobad: after even|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Tim is a marvellous operator who commentates as he operates :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: he las to lead the @S10 to pin the @S9|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: but he does neither very well :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sheila a: I have nothing but sympathy for the players, getting a board like this first up|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: I was thinking the same. You want a nice easy board first up in the morning.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: *has|pg||
nt|othered1: East, able to count declarer's tricks, switched in time.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|bobholl: will he notice his 4 :)|pg||
nt|don paulus: yes good switch - creates extra trick|pg||
nt|vbman: needed to play dia to make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does that mean they might be disqualified for posting the wrong cc? |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure he knew his @S6 and @S4 were equals|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: He will but he is still on a guess|pg||
nt|athene: after @S5&@S7 went earlier |pg||
pc|d6|nt|sheila a: Having pitched a @h, E would have done better to duck the A, cutting communications|pg||
nt|ady: I think this will be a swing for wales|pg||
nt|sybarra: did we just hear a sigh of relief?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Calls for more coffee and easier boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: S tells me that double would have been for t/o|pg||

nt|athene: perhaps he was thinking the @S8 play earlier might be a grosvenor?|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|othered1: is the club finesse clear even on early @D line?|pg||
nt|vbman: then with a dia in bag....|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: ok, Hallberg-Czerniewski are playing 15-17NT, 4cM, 3 weak 2's, standard count|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well the "Scots" are playing 15-17  so i guess we will get a funny club opener|pg||
mb|1C|an|2+|nt|Walddk2: 500 is a good result for E-W. N-S have a slam|pg||
nt|athene: that seems a bit far-fetched|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I have been in much worse|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C=majors,   just the bid N wanted to hear |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: As the cards lie, you will end up with 13 tricks in spades and hearts|pg||
nt|bobholl: this migth help|pg||
nt|athene: south might well have considered 4@H over the second double|pg||
mb|2H|nt|iain sime: Mike and Liz are playing 1C = 2+ with an artificial forcing 1D response.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S makes and 3N with both Q @c and @S being stiff|pg||
nt|sheila a: Ok, that's not a weak NT - is it??|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C for majors   which may well put e/w off playing in spades     now may play 3NT|pg||
nt|toobad: 2 H seems a reasonable contract|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: it's often a bad idea to put partner with shortage based on opps' bidding - but there, it did look reasonable|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: looks like 4@H can be made here even on minimal values|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  The heart slam needs 1 of 2 finesses and reasonable breaks, the spade slam is not so good and needs 2 finesses unless clubs break|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: and if north DOES have short diamonds, south has a very nice pure fit in three suits|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results posted at http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/Internationals/SeniorsCamrose2009.htm|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  3NT is better but it doesn't matter with the heart finesse working|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am surprised Liz didnt repond 1NT with her flat hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: the CC indicates 1@h reply is 5+|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but Maybe West showed 5@H?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks Tim :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Both boards a weak balanced hand has raised with three|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vbman: e may think long minor as dia of mc donagh|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C doubled might have worked out well |pg||
nt|ady: west after penalty  r  n/s vul against not|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Alex Adamson|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Good afternoon.|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: hi Alex|pg||
nt|toobad: easy to make even|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I would consider 1NT with East even if 1H does show five|pg||
nt|yo_yo: wow that open room is galloping along|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rednaxela: Excellent start for Scotland in the event as we near the halfway point.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: Would you not have doubled 5@D with the South hand?|pg||
nt|bobholl: the double is (if penalty oriented ) a bad bid|pg||
nt|athene: if south's X is penalties, it's a terrible bid|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I would still be thinking with the South hand|pg||
nt|athene: if it isn't, north's pass is pretty bad|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead makes this tough, and maybe beats it|pg||
nt|sheila a: So you can penalise them when they overcall your NT after all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rednaxela: The match against England was always going to be crucial.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mariner1: W can't stop N from ruffing @c and cashing the red winners|pg||
nt|don paulus: this changes the scope|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: he's giving this some thought|pg||
nt|sheila a: Good trump lead|pg||
nt|ady: seems around down 2   |pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: Cz just checking some facts before leading to T3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|don paulus: only 1 H loser now - 2 dia|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: yep, comparisons already!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sheila a: E had better not play the K|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: could be a poor result for n/s if e/w reach 4@S  in OR   and there is a club lead|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

nt|yo_yo: these are the sorts of hands i like to play on vugraph, nothing can go wrong :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: just cant handle it after trump lead |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rednaxela: when we were lucky.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|asnuttyas: Do you think Waterlow was more likely to duck @CA smoothly if he held Axxx instead of Axx ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: Panto was still thinking so Liz claimed to speed things up :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|iain sime: Declarer is going to shrug his shoulders and finesse in hearts. 12 tricks in the other room is a surprise.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes i cant understand 12 tricks|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Must have been an accident in diamonds|pg||
mc|11|nt|mariner1: except no entry to @c|pg||

nt|yo_yo: well now we might find out about their NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe not with 5422|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: and we might resume our discussion from yesterday about whether to open it with 5cM|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: And it kept E-W out|pg||
nt|don paulus: if N had switched - no chance|pg||
nt|iain sime: i think 1H is better even if 15/17.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes Tim but 5422 not everyone's choice of NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: wouldn't find many opening that 1NT|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The offshape strong NT is spreading faster than swine flu so nothing would surprise me|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: I hate to say it but Cz doesn't look fully fit :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: Hallberg prob going to play a lotta hands|pg||
nt|iain sime: This is an easy 5422 with no rebid problem. 2245 should consider 1NT,|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If the first board is any indication, Cz will go to some lengths to ensure he is dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: I think we'll also see a lot of very quick claims|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: but have to stay out of slam |pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: E-W are going to play 4@S now perhaps|pg||
nt|bobholl: if he guesses everything he migth make 4 @H|pg||

nt|vbman: if they all play the same deck|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: looks -2 at least|pg||
nt|vbman: control issues are going to gain importance here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: I wonder if this might let it make?|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: might take an unlikely @D lead from N to set this|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: or a switch|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Awkward over 3@s - 3NT could easily be the best contract.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|nigel_k:  South cooperating with North's efforts to be dummy by avoiding the 3S bid|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sheila a: In @s a heart ruff comes into possibility|pg||
nt|ady: I know south has a void   but they do have 3 aces missing    should manage to stay in a safe game|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  A game you would want to bid, especially vulnerable|pg||
nt|athene: the rare unfavourable sac :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzsf: Cz thinking|pg||
nt|ady: if you play in spades   you might get a heart ruffed   and if you play in hearts  you might get a spade ruffed    but still ok for game at the 4 level|pg||

nt|yo_yo: ahha now we know Tim|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: 2 good but normal passes from NS|pg||
nt|athene: north needed just a little more high-card strength, or south needed fewer spades|pg||
nt|sheila a: Although 3NT would be easier to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: we do indeed!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Lovely scenery I am told. I haven't been there|pg||
nt|mariner1: HI Marshall|pg||
nt|othered1: a modern overcall -- very old-fashioned players would double and north will ensure game is reached in @S|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   looks easy for e/w     played by west     can also make 5@D|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mariner1: not my idea of a weak 2 though VUL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi ed and rob|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sheila a: But maybe 2@h is quite high enough|pg||

pc|s3|nt|vbman: now down in 5dia|pg||

pc|cK|nt|sybarra: no only  4 |pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: dissapointing    this couldbe a vul game swing     both east and west had something to spare|pg||
nt|sheila a: EW may need to discuss this auction afterwards|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: 2@D fit non-jump slowed them down|pg||
nt|toobad: good lead directional bid from Panto|pg||
nt|capercliff: 6N has some chances|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: Looks like it.  Tough to get @S into the auction (a weak 2 isn't a consideration for me)|pg||
nt|capercliff: but maybe that is not realistic|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|othered1: At least they'll go plus NS, not a hopeless result on a tough hand|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: on a non-@S lead its cold|pg||
nt|capercliff: could be squeeze chances as well|pg||
nt|rednaxela: 4@s could have got out for 500.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: some N players who pass initially would fancy a responsive double with the N hand, but that hardly does the trick|pg||

pc|h7|nt|asnuttyas: i would think so after pd has made a non Gf 2/1|pg||

nt|don paulus: 4 spades NS|pg||
nt|capercliff: 2@c must promise another bid at least for this pair, otherwise he wouldnt have bid 2@h|pg||
nt|toobad: undoubtedly|pg||
nt|iain sime: Hallberg played 2 then 9 of clubs. The 2 was a count signal which was needed in this circumstance- entry less dummy.|pg||
nt|iain sime: The 9 should have been suit preference for spades.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is it obvious to south that the dummy had no entry?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I dont think so|pg||
nt|iain sime: If diamond king was an entry East had eight on top. 4C, 2D and 2S.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North took the second club so he must have interpreted South's play as count|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bobholl: 5 @D undoubled i guess :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: ed, i do want to be in 4S---on this one|pg||
mb|1D|nt|nigel_k:  Good for N/S if West gets the spade bid in first|pg||
nt|athene: will east get cute and try the @C7 lead against 5@D?|pg||
nt|othered1: Only the most rabid "any 11" openers would bid with north's hand.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|nigel_k:  He cannot then switch due to the failure to Smith peter|pg||
nt|iain sime: A poor result for Scotland in the other room. West led spades and declarer won the first round.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bobholl: kib says 3NT ew :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: unlead A@H to beat 4@S?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: not true. those who miscount their points might also open|pg||
nt|mariner1: or A@H and one|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: he did alert, didn't catch the expl but must be Drury|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: these plays are against the odds unless you have a lot of information suggesting a) partner has the spot card you need and b) drastic steps are necessary anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: they do make 5 @D as I look again,  |pg||
nt|rednaxela: The sort of hand the Italians would find there way to 3NT.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: its not a pretty contract |pg||
nt|capercliff: yes and right side it as well probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: yes     at worst on a club finesse|pg||

nt|vugraphzsf: yes|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: good(?) old fashioned Acol|pg||

nt|vugraphzsf: I was thinking that|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|yo_yo: oh dear|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: :(|pg||
nt|iain sime: i agree 1S. With a hand that would pass a 1NT rebid (12/14) you should bid the major.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: playing bridge on Vugraph isnt nice when you are not 100%|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If partner will bypass spades to rebid 1NT you probably should|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: Hallberg is back.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Still they would then get to 3NT by south with the same grizzly result|pg||
nt|iain sime: 3nt would have had a chance if declarer had ducked the lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: TDs for this event: Richard Bolton, John Pryor|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah but south could have ducked the first spade|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Bennett took the first spade in the open room |pg||
nt|yo_yo: now he's well down|pg||

nt|yo_yo: but yes he still need to get @C right, thanks kibs :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: i suppose he suddenly realised he doesn't in fact have a heart stop|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|asnuttyas: no - W is squeezed, not E|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West was likely playing games, believing the hand belonged to the opponents in hearts|pg||

pc|h5|nt|capercliff: or W before declarer I should say(assuming played from S)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|don paulus: only 2 now|pg||

nt|vugraphzsf: ah, not cashing cAK then|pg||

nt|yo_yo: time for tea :)|pg||
mb|2D|an|relay|nt|sybarra: yikes,  ok as long as you have methods |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsf: featherweight!|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: missed a pass here|pg||
nt|vbman: yep|pg||
nt|sheila a: W possibly considering double, but not attractive at the vulnerability|pg||
mb|3C|an|Puppet|nt|marlowepi: in the days of my first youth, Ghestem--Bacherich were a force to be reckoned with in French bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: best defense beats this|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: oops, sorry chaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It's simple because the layout is friendly. On a bad day you could go down|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure east needed to be all that scared of spades - if his opps had lots of strength between them, then very likely, their spades were 4-4|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps 5-3 as it was|pg||
nt|mariner1: np Tim|pg||
nt|vbman: some specs say they cant see hands|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice to get east on lead|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  doubled   800 on a trump lead     but unlikely contract|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: because otherwise south would have been bidding 2@S rather than doubling|pg||
nt|bobholl: not if they play NFB :)|pg||
nt|toobad: brought home would not be my description|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: W has to win and pl @D back to have a shot|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: not sure about that. if W leads a diamond, E is unlikely to cash the heart ace|pg||
nt|mariner1: play|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsf: Hallberg prob wishes he had weak NT available|pg||
nt|sheila a: Presumably E has denied 3 card support|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   present no problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: Hallberg's pass at his second turn wasn't alerted|pg||
nt|sybarra: or Halberg wishing he played penalty doubles |pg||
nt|sheila a: W has a nice hand, but without a fit he shouldn't get too excited|pg||
nt|ady: dont think west has a case to look further in view of Hallberg's pass on the 2nd round of bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: agree David,  E must have a spade card |pg||
nt|ady: in dangerous waters|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: no, but surely they aren't mad enough to do that? :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: has it now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why does W need to lead a D back at T2?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well cash As and cc pitching the @D losers|pg||
nt|vbman: pard has two singl?|pg||
nt|mariner1: @SA|pg||
nt|mariner1:  then @c @c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is only one pitch on clubs|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|toobad: they must have got a lot of help|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: looks like 2 to me|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@C  J@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: and me!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is because W returned a club instead of the diamond you were recommending|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is a hand I would much prefer to bid 2@h over 1n|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: hmmmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: oh my|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in exactly 1 hour: England v Patron|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: right I said needed @D to have a chance to beat it|pg||
nt|vbman: played a cl before lost place|pg||
nt|sybarra: clubs not behaving.... |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  He wants to eliminate clubs in case one hand has QJxx to allow a heart endplay|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: i am discussing the defense u were recommending: club to ace and diamond shift|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and i said i dont think W has to return a diamond|pg||
nt|mariner1: E in Zugzwang here|pg||
nt|mariner1: the longer E thinks the more sure S is of the position|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: @SA lead at trick one was the major help|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: These two pairs were in the very successful South African Bermuda Bowl team in Shanghai in 2007. Eliminating Italy (the major upset) and losing by just 8 IMPs to USA1 in the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: semi-finals|pg||
nt|bobholl: you say that 40% of the bridgeworld is mad (40 is a guess)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: couple of spade ruffs?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Probably play clubs before last trump|pg||
pc|d3|nt|don paulus: open room made the 3 nt board 1 - 10 imps|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sheila a: difficulties getting back and forward|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: yeah ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: spec tells me cold on 2 @S ruffs,  but the transportation is "challenging"|pg||
nt|ady: cant get back to hand twice   onnced to rudff a club and again to draw trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: and to take the @h finesse!|pg||
nt|sybarra: can we just lead from the wrong hand once?|pg||
nt|ady: will likely draw trumps now  and hope for 3-3  and some luck in the red suits   but clubs 4-2 is bad|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok,  another spec suggesting squeeze on N by running trumps|pg||
nt|sybarra: having trouble seeing that on e|pg||
nt|sheila a: might go to hand with K@d, ruff @s high, overtake 10@c and hope trump 3-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: maybe when he sees 4@c with S he'll go for that|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since E opened vul, i think S already is 100% sure of the position regardless of the huddle|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: i can't believe it's that high|pg||
nt|ady: had diamonds been 3-3  this could make now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|nigel_k:  I don't think diamonds before clubs was right, but he can't go down as it happens|pg||
pc|s7|nt|nigel_k:  Declarer correctly started with AC to cater for singleton K in South|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: well i mean more than 40% of the bridge world IS mad, but i can't believe 40% play negative free bids :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: but perhaps 1N doesnt deny 4@s|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|sheila a: K@h looks favourite to be onside|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h2|pg||

pc|h8|nt|sybarra: true |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
mc|10|nt|yo_yo: seems it wasnt so easy then|pg||

nt|rednaxela: 1NT|pg||
mb|1N|an|15-17|nt|bobholl: being mad and playing NFB :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: even playing a 15-17 nt? |pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: I don't know the strength of this but I guess they've agreed strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: in the old days this would be passed out|pg||

mb|2N|an|mild slam try in !d|nt|asnuttyas: 1nt every day|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: And they went off in 4@h on the hand where EW here 'missed' game|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: half-time called, 1 hour remaining|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: S could make 4S on D lead|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Yes|pg||
nt|capercliff: I seem to remember having this discussion before:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S would have to be 100,000 days old to pass|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: probably  right to reopen west at matchponts, but too risky here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Here is a normal 4@H that won't make due to bad breaks|pg||

pc|h2|nt|rednaxela: As was 2@h|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H 4-1 @D K wrong :)|pg||
nt|athene: a very common mix-up in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: west, when he bid 3@S, clearly wanted his opps to go 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: but east wasn't in on the Cunning Plan|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would not reopen at MPs red. too many ways to lopse, like -200 or simply helping them make 140 or 170 by giving info away|pg||
nt|sheila a: but q@s is an entry|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|vugraphzra: sry  i will correct it|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard to get all these situations right - in some situations you can use double to say "i want to bid on here, but you can pass if you have a stack"|pg||
nt|vugraphzra: tks|pg||
nt|athene: but of course that requires a lot of discussion so you know when it applies|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Normally a 6322 hand|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 5 corrected to 5!X-1, so 12 IMPs instead of 14|pg||

pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: 5@CX-1|pg||

pc|c6|pc|h5|pg||

nt|mariner1: N should be thinking slam|pg||

nt|marlowepi: with clubs not 4-0, there is a "sure-tricks" line for slam, which is prettier than the mundane discard of a heart from dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: don't know, no questions/explanations yet|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bobholl: ligth speed :)|pg||

nt|iain sime: Probably Paul is English. Maybe he will move to Scotland.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: give up a @S and out|pg||

mb|4S|nt|othered1: Normal good spot.  Grand well off-odds|pg||
mb|p|nt|asnuttyas: he will spurn the @H gift at trick 1|pg||
nt|capercliff: 6@d on a finesse|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@S 2@H 3@D and 5@C and out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it pays to keep in practice for when the elimination is the only line|pg||

nt|iain sime: Another Moysian game, reached in both rooms.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sheila a: One advantage of 2NT is it tells N his minor suit cards are all working.|pg||

nt|vugraphzsf: Cz asking questions but I can't make out the explanations|pg||

pc|hA|nt|sheila a: Indeed, the QJ of @c are key|pg||

pc|hT|nt|yo_yo: Paul Hackett   a great bridge player in his own right but now more famous maybe for being the father of the Hackett twins|pg||

nt|bobholl: board 8 was 6@C on @S a rigth|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem with opening 2@C is, partner will get to play it|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: sorry, of course Liz kept two clubs for the finish|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not a max with a 5 card major, will he upgrade|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: dang, 7 disappeared! Now for board 9. Sorry for confusion ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|asnuttyas: only a good sac if you can't find the @D switch|pg||
nt|capercliff: some action here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@H will prove to be very reveling to EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: 25-0 on 3 boards now :O|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: The Irish are in the lead :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what was 2h?|pg||
nt|mariner1: W should bid a @S game|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H looks like Muiderberg/Tartan type|pg||
nt|ady: a part score for n/s in spades  seems the limit|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3S seems about right for W now. i wonder what the delay is|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: hey, Ash rates 15-17 with M as 1M bid!|pg||
mb|2S|an|raise in !h|nt|nigel_k:  If South bids hearts naturally, North is going to 6 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 54 55 56 less than opening count|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: S went for a glass of water|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I'd value that around 18 so maybe he bid 1H for that reason|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: you don't need much to make 6@D|pg||
nt|bobholl: whicj is cold if you double finesse in @H|pg||
nt|athene: the auction started the same way in the other room but north decided not to bid 6@D|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think 3H at the other table was a second negative, not sure about this one|pg||
nt|vbman: has a trump less for slam consideration|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3@D  |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, south doesn't have a second negative|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need to get hearts right in 6@D. That is not automatic|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Gain for Wales - they stopped out of slam on the 6@c hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: The @D callhas clarified things for east.  Whether it's enough is a question.|pg||
nt|don paulus: should try to ruff couple of diamons - but N also single|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for those unfamiliar with Muiderberg, it conventionally means: "i have a bad shapely hand that i want to describe to the opponents so that they can bid a game they would not ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: otherwise bid, and then make it when they otherwise would probably fail"|pg||
nt|mariner1: this can be made|pg||
nt|othered1: That would be the normal line without the @D bid by south|pg||
nt|mariner1: lose a trump, a @D overruff and a @c|pg||
nt|capercliff: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As we pointed out in the open room, 6@H is cold here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a fit jump apparently|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: but it is the %play :)|pg||
nt|athene: now he will surely bid six|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was going to just crank up my nerve and bid 2 @S here |pg||
nt|Walddk4: also on a diamond lead|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|vugraphzsf: air-con being switched off|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know my pard always bids my singleton |pg||
nt|ady: this seems one too high|pg||
nt|sheila a: Maybe S thought he was too good for a simple 2@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: spade to the nine first round?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: oh no, diamond overruff before that|pg||
nt|sybarra: or club ruffs, @S6 may score |pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: Waterlow looks surprised at that|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|nigel_k:  I'd be more worried about missing 7 if I was North|pg||
nt|athene: @CA lead you need no guess|pg||
nt|athene: ruff, draw trumps, play @CQ pitching loser|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Eber won't lead @CA|pg||
nt|bobholl: well it is around 70% now the play :)|pg||
nt|athene: gotta love that @D8 :)|pg||
nt|iain sime: I am sure Roland would have been in 6H in a jiffy :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: wrong again :(|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hardly get to slam on a combined 27 count!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: ruff this with @DA for style|pg||
nt|bobholl: now cold :)|pg||
nt|othered1: yeah, south's trump spots are inadequate to the task here|pg||
nt|sheila a: @d likely to be 6-2, is it worth trying to ruff one?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mariner1: E might go awry here though|pg||
nt|don paulus: wrong black 9 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: connection slowed down then - was the air-con keeping it up? ;)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|nigel_k:  He will need to work on clubs before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|athene: no, @DK, @D to @D8, @CQ is fine|pg||
nt|athene: you have @S ruff as late entry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Muiderberg enjoys a kind of universal popularity. those who choose to play it apparently love it, and those who play against it love it even more|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: he pulled J, now thinking|pg||
nt|capercliff: uh oh|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Who cares about points?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: if he had ruffed with 4@S it might have been more revealing|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like my fit jumps to have 5+ in the suit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobholl: k of @D small @D @C Q throwing @H|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, you're right|pg||
nt|don paulus: loser on loser ?|pg||
nt|don paulus: diamond|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hQ|nt|ady: now down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: as predicted!|pg||
nt|sybarra: scooooooooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrreee    (as the hockey folks say)|pg||
nt|sheila a: Well predicted Shirley|pg||
nt|ady: could not see how that play could gain     know he cant get to dummy to enjoy a club trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: but now Cz has a small problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe @D 10 on first trick? |pg||
nt|sybarra: or what carding do they play?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Key for declarer is keep W on lead rather than E|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: I think it was atti on Q lead|pg||
nt|ady: diamond for west can hardly cost|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: can still make via @S finesse now|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 12 tricks for the taking|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I do!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: This pretty much seals the match|pg||
nt|capercliff: must now|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|asnuttyas: although Panto could still easily hold the @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: she's thinking about this next move|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: Restricted Choice applies tho|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Could play Panto for the bare Queen.|pg||
nt|capercliff: he did play the K@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: fingering @dK|pg||
nt|capercliff: should be enough to play the finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: drink of water, mint, ... picks up her cards again ...|pg||

nt|ady: even if south had the 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: some days are like this |pg||

nt|yo_yo: but I am old fashioned|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: a @D would have been a better play from Panto - he gave the @H distibution away|pg||

nt|athene: west didn't expect south to have so much club strength, given he didn't bid 3nt over 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set now. Many thanks to Roz Bernstein, our very capable operator at Wilderness. Well done!|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Cope have good chances of a pickup on 11 and/or 12 as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: good grief, carnage at the other table|pg||
nt|vbman: which cl did s play to the king?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: he did play the 5 not the 10|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S again here is easier|pg||
nt|ady: but south might have bid 2@S  instead of re-opening with double and might have bought the contract|pg||
nt|sheila a: indeed|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 7 where we had dicussion of bidding, e/w at other table played 1 nt |pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: yes, well done|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And finally on to the exciting contract of 1@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: great auction in the OR!|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: what count did that show?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bet he will not open 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to my excellent co-commentators, Bill, Nigel and Bob|pg||
nt|sybarra: bravely bid 1 nt on the 10xxx hand |pg||
nt|sheila a: better to bid 1NT bravely than 2Nt :)|pg||
nt|ady: yes after 1@C  double  east chose to bid 1NT rather than re-double|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: N says "I'm not allowed to alert the double", S "he's just woken up"!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: correct again Kath|pg||
mb|2C|an|GF or weak 2!d|nt|vugraphzsf: presumably reverse? or perhaps atti?|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: will Panto bid a frisky 3nt over 3@D?|pg||
nt|iain sime: The long awaited board 10. Could be flat, could be + a lot.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  That must be some kind of record for the strongest 1 level opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsf: I don't have a CC to hand so can only guess|pg||
mb|2D|an|relay|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Our appreciation to the South African Bridge Federation for brining this event to BBO vugraph. Carol Grunder has been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: he will, he will|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: that was on bd 7  where we discussed what to do with the 10xxx of sp hand  |pg||
nt|rednaxela: Scotland have indeed bid the 23 count 3NT on board 5....and made it.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Did anyone call Guinness?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: I wonder why Hallberg rebid 2Nt rather than 2@s ehre|pg||
nt|yo_yo: :)|pg||
nt|iain sime: not flat.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sheila a: Ah - to get that lead!|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D in N might have helped the leader |pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: maybe he likes his club stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: @dQ lead and he'd take only one trick!|pg||
nt|ady: can make 9 tricks  with 2 spade entries and heart king well placed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results posted at http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/Internationals/SeniorsCamrose2009.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: and that if he guesses right at the end|pg||
nt|ady: yes   diamond lead   disaster|pg||
nt|sybarra: when my pard db's and I hold a suit....I think I am suppose to bid |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 50 mins: Scotland v Patron|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Last set will start after a break for about 15 minutes|pg||
nt|capercliff: Liz obviously wanted to get to dummy to play a @d before touching trump|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Credit to Roy Bennett for not balancing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well Waterlow always has his bid!|pg||
mb|6H|nt|athene: the cards don't lie too well for declarer but he snuck home in the other room|pg||
nt|vbman: can u ask s player sometime?|pg||
nt|othered1: do we assume EW use weak NT and thus east's raise shows very sound values?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why very sound? couldn't E have :  AJx   x   AQxxx   Jxxx ?|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: Ash decided not lead his pd's suit - or 4th highest of his own|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I know pard has clubs but......|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|sheila a: Normally worth bidding a good suit like that for the lead|pg||
nt|iain sime: Yes, well done Roy. 1H-P-P-1S-6D! would have been fun.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: I would think so |pg||
nt|capercliff: he did well not too|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If declarer runs spades N will come under pressure|pg||
nt|mariner1: and @S lead works here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: N in the tank|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15 IMPs to Scotland|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzsf: eyebrows raised in N|pg||
nt|sheila a: It's always a bleak moment when you realise you have led declarer's 6 carder against NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: N certainly can not think that E suit is @D |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|nigel_k:  He'll need to bare AD allowing a throw in if declarer reads it correctly|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and 18-12 VPs|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|athene: he needs to bare the @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: throw one club and one diamond|pg||
nt|bobholl: the 52 crds way is always correct :) but i think he will play that way |pg||
nt|athene: ah no- that's no use|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: just pitched the @C N could have lead thru declarer |pg||
nt|ady: n/s  certainly have a part score in clubs|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|nigel_k:  If North doesn't look too uncomfortable he's probably ok either way :)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: and to Kath, Iain and Nigel, our excellent commentators|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Back in about 40 minutes with England v Patron|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh yes, dont go home yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oops, sorry|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|rednaxela: Four people did.|pg||
nt|toobad: only Falkirk fans watching|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Easy grand slam in three denominations :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in Open Room gave up easy|pg||
mb|2C|an|GF|nt|mariner1: oh that was 2@D NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: hearts, clubs, NT|pg||
mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: i like having a weak 2 bid in the suit that opps declare in (as E did at other table)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so they played in the 4 2 fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: has anyone asked about the FA Cup Final?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 6@H is the most likely final spot, i would guess|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think you need to find the queen of clubs to make 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: Burn's law violation|pg||
nt|capercliff: another boring hand|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Indeed, and you won't|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D = hearts, 2@D = 4th suit forcing, i assume|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rednaxela: Falkirk hit the post.|pg||
nt|capercliff: claim 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: he's thinking about it|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: These two pairs were in the very successful South African Bermuda Bowl team in Shanghai in 2007. Eliminating Italy and losing by just 8 IMPs to USA1 in the semi-finals|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I like 1@H here by @S|pg||
nt|othered1: I can't imagine passing 2@D on the south hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: imagine your initial thoughts about your defensive prospects as u pick up the E hand, compared to how you feel when opps alight in 2D :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N is too aggressive|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: their fourth 3NT jump of the evening, if I count right|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S bid by west dubious|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: you have 14 however no help in @c|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: yes - italy-south africa was the big upset of that event|pg||
nt|capercliff: Liggat decided to make his opp squirm a bit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: More IMPs to Scotland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzsf: looks like 11 now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: undo pls|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible they might power to 7@H - it all comes down to the difference between the @CQ and @CJ |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@S might have made if played by North|pg||
nt|yo_yo: for those asking North is the father, not the brother, this is the SENIORS camrose|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: Not easy to lead a red card from the East hand|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: a simple 2S over 1NT would leave pd very well placed to make a final decision|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: not on pointcount -- partner should have a 10+ count for the 1N response to balancing double of 1@C|pg||
nt|sheila a: Yes, E obviously took him for a little extra|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: 4@S could be kickback RKCB for hearts|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: That makes sense. 5@H  2 keycards and trump queen|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|nigel_k:  With a possible bad trump break and uncertainty about the third club and fourth diamond, grand is optimistic|pg||
nt|athene: 5@S looking for the grand - but surely north would just show side kings, not the (critical) @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: i guess if north shows the @SK, south might bid 7, knowing he has a pitch for his third club|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: Another option was for Cope to bid 6@C to ask for 3rd rd control|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: there's a slight question-mark over the trump suit too, as nigel points out|pg||
nt|athene: so this is all pretty reasonable|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: i don't see any reason not to finesse clubs, so probably 1430|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes but N does not have to have 2 @c stoppers|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|othered1: Ands west doesn't have to have a real @C suit here|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  There aren't enough entries to play a dummy reversal and discard clubs on diamonds so he will end up finessing|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree with Marshall that a careful check was reasonable|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we all open that 11 count?|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|ady: england played 3NT on board 8   when a grand slam is on top and wales played in 6@D|pg||

nt|marlowepi: not sure how that affects the statement that 2S is the obvious rebid for S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ah ok|pg||
nt|mariner1: W has to have someting and he has it ALL behind S|pg||
nt|ady: more imps for Wales|pg||
nt|sheila a: not an unreasonable line, but not a working one|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is the penultimate board,  |pg||
nt|rednaxela: 5 imps back to england as Scotland go down in partscore at both tables on board 6.|pg||
nt|capercliff: suppose claiming was premature with a safe @h finesse available|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This hand is unlucky for England, on most days they would be gaining 6 or 7 imps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont like balanced 11 count openers|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No that's a hideous opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: both bid corectly IMO|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if the defence hadn't gone just so, they would have had ten tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: correctly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT the most likely contract, but 4@H can also make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: maybe 2@C after 1N....... they need a checkback|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Cope opened 1@S at the other table|pg||
nt|bobholl: that strong a "weak " 2|pg||
nt|mariner1: and N could have raised @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: Mc thought of coming in there!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no need for artificialities when 2S would tell whole story|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It's a VERY good weak 2|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Possible sac in clubs for E-w.|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: possible sac in 1ntX haha|pg||
nt|capercliff: lol|pg||
nt|capercliff: wd to get to 5@d in the other room|pg||
nt|capercliff: N decided to pass|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It's worse than an average 11 count |pg||
mb|2S|an|3-card support|nt|vugraphzsf: that'll excite McGowan|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would be uneasy opening 2@S on a hand that good unless partner knew i might have a 6-loser hand|pg||
nt|rednaxela: That will surprise McGowan.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mariner1: well EW in  Open Room found a @c slam try on the Moysian fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: Having pulled, Ash now has a pretty good hand.|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: Liz may think Waterlow has semi-psyched at this point|pg||
nt|capercliff: 5@d looks a better spot that 4@h, even though @h's are 44|pg||
nt|capercliff: and 3-2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sheila a: W didn't feel his hand worth an intervention in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: the light opener worked against them|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: they know each other :)|pg||
nt|don paulus: 11 top tricks in nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: Ash: "nice trumps, partner"|pg||
nt|iain sime: Playing a 15/17 nt only good eleven counts should be opened in/ seats. Otherwise the weak NT range becomes too wide.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: yes, perhaps S restrained himself because he also had playability in diamonds :)|pg||
nt|vbman: the gap widens ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of this session.......|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: E shakes his head but he doesn't know what's happened in OR|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: 4 top losers    will do well to make     can pick up the clubs|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: cant blame either of N/S for their actions really|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Has a learned spec points out, he could also expect finesses through East to work.|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: McGowan, seeing Ash ruff: "oh no"|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Eber can pretty much count 9 tricks by setting up diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: well he only has 8 winners for sure, but opps are almost always going to have to help him out|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@D 3@C 2@H are only sure :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The opponents can't avoid giving him a 9th|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's that 10?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|capercliff: this is not a bad place to play, lets be fair|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: He might contrive to lose two hearts, two diamonds and the @SA.|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: made 10 tricks in spades  in OR    could be some needed imps back for england|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I think Ash might have patterned out with 3@h.|pg||
nt|capercliff: on another day the 1N hand would have KQ@h|pg||
nt|iain sime: reverse count|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|othered1: 6N isn't hateful at all and might make.|pg||

pc|c5|nt|iain sime: But when dummy has a singleton it is suit preference.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: He already 'stole' his 9th trick|pg||
nt|athene: the @SK was double-edged - he grabs a ninth trick but risks setting up 5 for opps|pg||
nt|bobholl: but has to guess on small @S now|pg||
nt|athene: well, it would be very unlucky if this gave the defence three spades and @DAK, i suppose|pg||

nt|mariner1: http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/seniorselections.htm  -  Tournament site|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|asnuttyas: He may have chosen to do that, but he was facing a hand that couldnt make more than a LR in @Ds|pg||

pc|h8|nt|bobholl: wow |pg||
