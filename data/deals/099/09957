nt|charles_l: W was passed, and 7-4 hands play better in the longer suit anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: here we go|pg||
nt|charles_l: current standings http://www.bridge.ee/festival/teams09.htm|pg||
nt|april7: W will open in 4th position and will probably end up in 1NT|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Starting with a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: It's not laydown, though|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ehsana: South and west shud ahve been partners :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: @CJ nice placed|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  There is a club/spade squeeze on South for the 12th trick|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But could be interesting if South refuses twice to take the AC|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Maybe a heart can be ducked to North in that case to establish a fourth heart|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, it's a make with open cards, but ...|pg||
nt|haans: may 3NT show clubs?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|charles_l: 300 on a partscore hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What is the NT range, Raul?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  They have 33 HCP and no reason to play in a suit contract so I expect they'll find their way to 6NT eventually|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: I'll try to find out|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: strange???????? even 3C would play better|pg||
nt|april7: contract is the same,but played by E making 8 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: 15-17 nt cc on http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=OpenTeams&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CConventionCa...|pg||
nt|haans: rds%2F2008Pau%2Deuropean and click on Estonia and look at the system card for the pair|pg||
nt|haans: no good lead for south|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk4: Very unusual lead against a slam|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Double dummy you just go after hearts now, concede a trick to North who has no more clubs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|charles_l: E had no chance|pg||
nt|april7: now 9 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jstokes: maybe 9 now after that shift|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: may make nine, but not a deal to get too excited about |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i think 10|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then later South will be squeezed in the bllack suits|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He can't do that now because South has a card to spare|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, East has to discard before South|pg||
nt|haans: fairly easy squeez now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No squeeze any more|pg||
nt|Walddk4: South sitting *over* the menaces|pg||
nt|haans: yes right u are|pg||
pc|h3|nt|don paulus: didnt expect S to pass on 2 D dbl|pg||
nt|charles_l: well 2@d is a very ugly bid|pg||
nt|ehsana: not if it makes :)|pg||

nt|charles_l: S will open/overcall 5@c|pg||

pc|dT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: an A is a must lead if u got one!|pg||
nt|irwinbo: west should bid|pg||
nt|jstokes: yes to leading an ace, but here it is still not clear what to do after that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps West should risk a double |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|charles_l: no :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: kindly add +2 any bets.|pg||
nt|charles_l: @d lead anyone?|pg||
nt|charles_l: not o that lead :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ace of spades and W signals w Q|pg||
nt|irwinbo: or four hearts|pg||
pc|sK|nt|charles_l: apparantly not|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|h3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|charles_l: @h now|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think it can only be made by taking AD at trick one and later establishing a diamond by ruffing|pg||
pc|h8|nt|don paulus: 3 c for spades ?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  Two extremely difficult play problems to start this set. We'll see if the other table can solve them.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|charles_l: big is an underbid|pg||
mb|d|nt|nigel_k:  This will be a very thin 3NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzrc: this is round 9 of 14|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|charles_l: on the surface it looks like only 3 losers in 4@h|pg||
nt|april7: in other room might even go to 5@H after 5@C and going down probably 2|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4 H by NS looks plausible|pg||
nt|charles_l: but i dont think there are 10 tricks on @h lead|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|mmmakela: there went the ruff|pg||
nt|april7: another unfortunate lead allowing the contract to be made|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however EW back in business here after that lead|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt to agressive|pg||
pc|s9|nt|irwinbo: spade ace lead and a diamond shift puts this down one|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I'd expect 2NT there to be a better than a strong NT, but not necessarily 23 HCP|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Some players would just bid 3NT and hope partner has something|pg||
nt|haans: lucky dummy had any cards|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|charles_l: trump switch too late now|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think 3NT can make because South will be endplayed with AC and forced to provide a second diamond finesse|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: CA and QC overtaken by KC and another S and small will help their cause|pg||
nt|charles_l: he can just win @CA and lead out @s5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true that is also there|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|nigel_k:  But declarer needs to guess everything correctly|pg||

nt|vugraphzrc: Sester told Bendiks not alert Dbl again :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Here, South won KD but had to give declarer the ninth trick by playing clubs|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|charles_l: not on repeated trump leads|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 4@h i mean|pg||
nt|charles_l: 2/3@s for NS? i think 4 is a bit too much|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|charles_l: honestly not the bidding i imagined :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: +500 on a couple of @d ruffs|pg||

nt|vugraphzrc: but they were very quick|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: never bad to get 500 versus a dodgy vul game  |pg||

nt|haans: after 1nt|pg||
mb|2D|nt|charles_l: there's one gone now|pg||
nt|don paulus: 2 left|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: an English player (Tony Forrester) kept a four-year record of exactly that point.  |pg||
nt|jstokes: on the hand with 9 solid clubs, E opened in front of the clubs in the other room, then 5@C - 5@H, making 6 with a club lead and North not splitting @DKQ on a diamond lead|pg||

nt|rnmalik: but why did E not lead a C?|pg||
nt|charles_l: no idea|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I think on the same bidding in the open room, the lead was C|pg||
nt|charles_l: different bidding|pg||
nt|don paulus: he probably will if W dbls - NS may turn to D then|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cs bid by W|pg||
nt|rnmalik: why DBL and put them in a better contract|pg||
nt|don paulus: to tell p he can safely lead yr suit even after NT bid by ops|pg||
nt|don paulus: 4 diamonds also dbl|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1 as compared to -5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: suit worth bidding is worth leading|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry I am harping on the same issue 2Cs vul over 1S has to be very good at least 7 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: anyone for cup of tea pl Don, Charles|pg||
nt|charles_l: 2@c over 1@s different that over 1@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: loss of 5 imps|pg||

nt|charles_l: the question is why are they even in the bidding?|pg||
nt|april7: exactly 9 trick because of @S 4-4|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|charles_l: some expert pairs playing transfer advances would bid 2@d on W to show a good raise|pg||
