mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: that 7@S was board 82 -- sorry about confusion|pg||
nt|onebid: 11 seems to be the standard now. Used to be only when playing strong club|pg||
nt|onebid: yes, that's a lot of imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this one does have good @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think checkback mechanisms have helped reduce the minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: I agree with that. I check spades first befor deciding|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: true Al, if you open light your system needs to have good controls|pg||

nt|onebid: odd, but 4@S looks best|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead does 4@S in I think|pg||
nt|onebid: not an easy hand, but a better chance I think - minus that lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: they started playing board 89, so will skip to that board|pg||
nt|mariner1: can NS actually endup in 4@S though?|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|d|nt|mariner1: back to the 3N or 4@S problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: that large lady is in the park, and is thinking about warming up|pg||
nt|onebid: Will she be on American Idol?|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe we need a large man for a ladies game?|pg||
nt|onebid: Big Train?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Pavoratti|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe  walter is doing commentary in the other match|pg||

nt|mariner1: can Wojo sing?|pg||
nt|onebid: Walter a great analyst|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: mee mee mee mee|pg||
nt|daman: tough call for @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS might not be in 3N now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: asks 3d?|pg||
nt|onebid: Chuck can sing@H|pg||
mb|3C|mb|d!|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: well might end up in 3N after all|pg||
nt|onebid: unless they go off the tracks|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: but I am not fat, large maybe|pg||
nt|mariner1: Migry made a good 3@D jump|pg||
nt|onebid: the Jxx @D ought to persuade her to bid 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: after all, pard heard the opener|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Pollack's DBL was NEG  [takeout]|pg||
nt|mariner1: btw I do not love 1N with only Kx in @D,,,,,,,, admittedly many bid it|pg||
nt|onebid: looks suit oriented|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe the slow auction showed some help in @D rather than immediate 3@S|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: or just made 3@S invitational|pg||
pc|h7|nt|onebid: don't understand why she didn't start with 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Judy overcalls 1H?      I know Marshall Miles would|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|c3|nt|onebid: 2@C it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: phew|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would bid 1@H too  or 2@C.....|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: and I much prefer 1@H to the 2@C|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s8|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|c7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe  i never guess the best suit to bid -- so 1N for me|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|mariner1: when I bid 1N overcall I want to have what looks like 2 stops|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mariner1: its a good part of my hand|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|cK|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: but opening bids in minors get no respect|pg||
nt|onebid: can't hurt to bid your longest suit - rarely ends the bidding|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mariner1: again, most do not think that way|pg||
nt|onebid: still, I don't hate 1NT|pg||
