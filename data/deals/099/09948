nt|Walddk4: Mist be pass pass 1@D, operator|pg||
nt|pef: north probably didn't open 1d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Montreal Relay was a forerunner to relay systems to get pure distribution info|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Undo please|pg||
nt|pef: opening bids have gotten a lot lighter, but that probably doesn't even meet strong club players standards :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: sorry folks, the connection dropped and i lost  everything will resume with board 2|pg||
nt|pef: what was the final contract on board 1?|pg||

mb|2H|nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: another operator who would rather be playing |pg||
nt|jcwla: We're back in the City of Trees, where the Mancuso team (and esp Quinn) have shown great mental toughness in putting the disappointment of Board 95 of the USA1 final behind them ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: and methodically building this 55-IMP lead.  |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jstokes: Hi Giorgio, all|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4N is Quanitative here|pg||
nt|avivs: Glasson needs to catch up which explains the "upgrade"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right off a hand with swing potential -- depending upon where @DK lives |pg||
nt|jcwla: Back from comp problems, hopefully they're resolved.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who upgraded?|pg||
nt|avivs: unless they are playing a different range than 15-17|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not yet written -- science of showing 3 card support and outside EIGHT bagger|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: and just to even things out --- the other room just crashed :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|buffytvs: that makes me feel better -- I was thinking it was me :)|pg||
nt|daman: 4 @H will be the likely contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C down, i dont see a possiblity to play the reduction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: of course if lead @S, otherwise also 5@C made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curious that the 9 card fit missing only Q has 2 losers, but 8 card fit missing QJ has only 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very strange deities our gods of probability|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: I'm sure Rosie has visions , but Stasha will not cooperate :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pef: we believe mancuso is still up by 3 imps with a very long way to go|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not mutually exclusive Ray|pg||
nt|bridge_one: everyone would choise 2@H instead 3@c here ? i amn't sure about this hand - very difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: from what i've seen this week, Stasha tendency between less optimistic => pessimistic|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: oops|pg||
nt|jstokes: i'm not sure about 3@C; suggests short spades to me|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C by South A in @c (by North, having the K)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: we have a rule in New York not to put down 8 cards suits in dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow - 4@H   laying down 8 bagger as dummy is RIGHT |pg||
nt|daman: only because you have to move the board to lay them out :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be a misunderstand, or also a natural bid (don't having Aces) giving the best information to play slam or not - this is true only if they play 2@D or 3@C forcing game|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: unless they are trumps say the kibitzers :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|pef: can we try that auction again, vugraph?|pg||
nt|cbernstn: did east bid 5@C?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: seems the most likely explanation -- they avoided 3Nt after South doubled for th diamond lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but 5@C has no play|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more play for EW than NS :)|pg||
nt|pef: I'd find east bidding 5c pretty surprising, would be more likely to look for a 43 major fit|pg||
nt|buffytvs: for sure :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right peter -- 2 Moysians to explore before picking @C|pg||
nt|buffytvs: actually they might make 4@H|pg||
nt|rcm: this auction seems very strange|pg||
nt|cbernstn: 3NT down in other room, where 3NT was the contract on the first 3 boards|pg||
nt|pef: well looks like the final contract was 5c down 1 which actually gained 3 imps vs 3nt down 2 in the close room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein DBL of 3@S gave Wittes an option she probably wouldn't have taken otherwise|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c5|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: N wasn't really going to sit if S bid 2@H, was she?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 2@D was quite a call -- couldn't North have been 4432, for example?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can lose the ruff in @S bec is the natural trump trik  for North - but need to play A - now North can make 2 ruff|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pef: yes, I would think 2s is better, surely north is prepared for hearing either major|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i think 2@D big winner in the long run -- 2@S caters to such a small window of hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jumping back to last hand -- it's been pointed out to me that hand should make after @S at trick 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: ruffing with the 8 of diamonds by quinn may have cost a trick because now declarer had two entires to lead toward the spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: in 5@C  ruff 3rd spade, use @D to dummy to ruff @D, use @H to ruff again -- now trump endplay|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|nt|pef: although I don't see how she made 5, we'll need to check that|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i may have missed one reduction play - and cask 2nd @H but you get the picture|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: works only because West @S return lets her start reduction|pg||
mb|p|nt|jstokes: needs one less ruff than one might think, because the trump endplay substitutes for the usual coup at the end|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 1st club to Ace shows the need to try|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|buffytvs: lol -- North is endplayed already|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

nt|pef: well up to 8 tricks now, will she find a ninth?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: examining the convention cards for this event, a surpisingly small number of pairs play Puppet Stayman over 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting choice of 4th best|pg||

nt|ahollan1: of course - nothing would have worked|pg||

nt|ahollan1: doesn't it need guess of @SJ?|pg||
nt|daman: eventually perhaps|pg||
nt|jstokes: with clubs not breaking it does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or @C ruff beats off top|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but i like the auction|pg||

nt|daman: nobody would return a @C with the North hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North could imagine to swith in @C - the partner could be also void in that suit, and with A in @D would be good also a sgl|pg||

nt|cbernstn: Let's just say that both N & S pushed their hands to the limit.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from John Carruthers -- on 54  if @D taps at trick 3 and later -- might still beat 4@H so good play by Declarer to claim|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|d8|pg||

nt|ahollan1: there are actually a few pairs in this championship who do NOT play Kokish -- but not many|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: North hand not strong enough, but 2@C-2@D start made me think of it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I suspect we have the auction on 41 and the cards from 40 here|pg||
nt|pef: this is obviously the board from last round|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pef: more than just good, I would say, nearly 100% for a small slam, pretty much exactly 50% for a grand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: Quinn overcalled 1@S as South and pushed her opps to 3@C|pg||
nt|daman: in the OR|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: the 9 of @h made it on the last hand - nice try by Cohen|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jstokes: pushed west to make an unusual 2@C raise on 3, which worked out well|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: now 4@D shortness or 4@S mild slam try |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S is slam try because 2N-4@H is Texas Transfer to 4@S with no slam interest|pg||
pc|h3|nt|buffytvs: Mmm.. if South is interested in a spade slam without the @SAK, why doesn't North make a move?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pef: if this really was the auction I'm very surprised|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a bit surprising that Bjerkan neither gave super-accept NOR tray after Weinstein invite|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|nt|pef: once north didn't super accept, surely she could make a move over 4s|pg||
nt|daman: making 2 will be a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i really like the 1@S overcall|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|buffytvs: well, the play won't take long :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly -- must either super accept or go after invited|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cbernstn: I think N might have moved over 3@H|pg||
nt|pef: in that 3nt shawn quinn made a few boards ago, they did go down in the open room,  declarer didn't time the play nearly as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cindy - do you have a preference of type of super accept?|pg||
nt|pef: so far this is looking to be a very good set for the mancuso team|pg||
nt|cbernstn: I might have bid 3NT with North hand over 3@H|pg||
nt|pef: there are lots of possible ways to play the superaccept.  some would say jumping to 4s is limited with 4 good spades and you cuebid with a really good hand.  others might say you ...|pg||
nt|pef: will have so much to cuebid that cuebids show limited, but good values, and bidding 4s is a really strong hand in controls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm i thought 3N often covers unusual shape WITHOUT @S|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Linda and I play step response superaccepts, showing trump quality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so thinking 4@C as either source of tricks or just cue bid|pg||
nt|pef: another topic even a lot of experienced partnerships don't discuss enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tell us more Ray|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I'm trying to remember LOL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|buffytvs: iirc, 1st step superaccept is 3 trumps with a ruffing value, next is 4 trumps, top is 4 trumps to a top honour -- 3NT is 4trumps but 4333|pg||
nt|pef: the last three boards are all potential pickups for mancuso|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but East has not promised 4@C|pg||

nt|Vugraphu5: they're all afraid of me :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|pef: yes, they had the same auction on what we thought was a fairly easy slam to bid--guess neither partnership had discussed how to show various hand types over the 3 level transfer ...|pg||
nt|pef: and just how strong a slam invitation it was|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|pef: but not getting to the other slam was even more surprising.  in one case they just made a mild try and gave up, in the other blackwood|pg||
nt|ahollan1: key point here for partnerships playing any form of checkback -- is opener's first option 3 card support or 4 of other major|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: quinn's pass denies 3+@S|pg||

nt|Vugraphu5: i can't speak english anymore |pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: as operator, i found BBO UNDO mechanism very troublesome -- it doesn't happen quickly and huge risk of losing track of rest of auction or play of cards|pg||

nt|pef: wow, one in a row for us|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu5: why I left the auction :)|pg||

nt|pef: next one scheduled to start at 1:30 PM Pacific time|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the dbl is 4M + longer minor or diamonds -- in this case she has both|pg||

mb|p|nt|pef: north/south have an excellent 4h contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|cbernstn: OR just hearts|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bridge_one: bat also pass :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: or a really big hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: or diamonds|pg||

nt|buffytvs: lot of hand types|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right or @D|pg||
nt|pef: what do you guys think, assuming the double of 2h showed heart cards, wouldn't you bid 4h on the south hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so nobody knows until the end :)|pg||
nt|pef: the cards you need to be onside all rate to be so|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: I think DBL probably says -- let's defend if you have @H -- but don't think it SHOWS @H length|pg||
nt|pef: I mean if partner has as llittle as xxx qjxxx xx xxx aren't you willing to be in game?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: agree -- depends on what the dbl means|pg||
nt|cbernstn: Since South could have hand types that don't include hearts, N must have good hearts, I would think.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 3@H probably the @H + minor type -- single suit @H would bid 4@H|pg||
nt|cbernstn: Warranting a game bid by South.|pg||
nt|pef: we are all speculating, obviously, but I agree with what cindy just said|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Rozie knows pard has zilch - so pass good|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in open room South Dbl again over 2@h|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but pass is ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without J   zilch would be drek|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|buffytvs: most of time South will have hearts for the dbl|pg||
nt|pef: seems much more useful over the 2h transfer for double to show hearts (and ask for a heart lead).  if that's true, bidding only 3h seems rather timid|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: i'm not convinced -- i think it is like many pass/correct situations|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: so can't make pure penalty double ever|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|tlc: seems like all roads lead to +140 and a 1 IMP pickup for Mancuso here...|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|bridge_one: yes - however would need to play @h from dummy after the dbl|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|tlc: well 170 now...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pef: but with just values, wouldn't it make more sense to pass the transfer and then double if it went 2s pp?|pg||
nt|pef: very unlikely to have a pure penalty double of spades|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 2 imp|pg||
pc|h7|nt|buffytvs: Isn't 3@H forward-going?  If she passes 2@S she'll now be known to have one of the heart hands anyway...|pg||
nt|daman: the last 32 board should be exciting|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pef: yeah, but you'd bid that missing the q of diamonds or with only 5 diamonds, big diffrerence|pg||
