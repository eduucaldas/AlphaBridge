nt|petergill: Declarer cannot see all 52 cards - there are several ways to play the @C suit|pg||

nt|petergill: West is counting - N has 6 @H's, 3 @D's from the lead, 2 spades (no 2@S opening by South) and thus 2 clubs|pg||

pc|h9|nt|jtr: 0r 2-6-4-1?|pg||
nt|petergill: yes, possibly|pg||
nt|jtr: But there are only 8 tricks then|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jtr: even with 10x@s|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: but Steve's point about needing @CJ10 doubleton in order to have any chance of 9 tricks is the vital point I think|pg||
nt|petergill: so West will play North for @CJ10 doubleton I think|pg||
nt|petergill: With 108, North would play 8 on the first club|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|henryb: probably should not with 97 in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: May as well duck the @H, no rush |pg||
nt|jtr: well, 108 is interesting|pg||
nt|petergill: Very very slowly, I think West will eventually make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jtr: In fact the 10 would work better on this hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Good point, @Cx - 8 - 9 - J then run !Q to pin @C10 |pg||
nt|petergill: so West has to allow for the expert North to have played @C10 from 108 sometimes, I guess|pg||
nt|henryb: you play the 10 to give declarer a losing possibility: if you play the 8 declarer will play the 9 and later squash your 10|pg||
nt|petergill: Plenty for the players to think about, not as much for those of us who can see all 52 cards to think about|pg||
nt|jtr: same applies to J8 too|pg||

nt|jtr: then pick a minor|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: It's easier to duck small to K in a side suit than in trumps|pg||

nt|petergill: 2@C|pg||

nt|sybarra: on bd 15,  11 imps to poland on the hand our aunt millie's would have beaten |pg||

nt|henryb: or 17-19 with 4 hearts|pg||
nt|jtr: ah|pg||

nt|vugraphzry: East thinking now :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Will i make a phone call?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@CX is no good for NS but 3@S doubled is hard to get East in to lead spades |pg||
nt|sybarra: aunt gertrude already in 4 @H?|pg||
nt|jtr: She would have doubled 1@c it seems|pg||
nt|petergill: unless West underleads @HAK at Trick One, but what expert would underlead @HA against a suit contract?|pg||
nt|jtr: 15 HCPs after all|pg||
nt|sybarra: specs are having fun with aunt millie's and gertrude's   |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: I do not understand the 3@c bid ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S might have been a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|jtr: I think East will bid 3@h though|pg||
nt|petergill: East has nice clubs, and has shown only 0-6 HCP with 1@D|pg||
nt|henryb: then why not bid 2N as balance rather than X|pg||
nt|vugraphzry: but he has a 5th @H...|pg||
nt|petergill: Because now South can run from 3@CX (about -500) to 3@SX (possibly +730)|pg||
nt|jtr: East is confused|pg||
nt|jtr: Because partner has taken a view |pg||
nt|jtr: I think anyway|pg||
nt|petergill: If South bids 3@S, West will dbl - such is the Polish style|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Great decision by East|pg||
nt|petergill: Best lead to 3@SX is a small spade, but that is double dummy - on other layouts it will destroy the possibility of partner leading their singleton spade later on|pg||
