nt|ahollan1: the match for USA1 is separated by only 5 imps -- my guess that's where we'll find the bulk of kibitzers|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a partscore in @h or @d for NS|pg||

nt|cbernstn: and about 4@c ew|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@D should close it out|pg||
nt|ralfwil: cannot agree with this preemptive opening witn 3-3 in majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|mariner1: Migry not willing to come in RED vs White...... don't blame her|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|mariner1: 2N by W :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs play Smith Echo vs NT -- but that really isn't an issue on this hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: though 2N could be made|pg||
nt|cbernstn: Pollack will duck this|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mariner1: S should duck this|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|mariner1: so was not too high :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: the other table of that match 5@C down 1   -- what a difference a choice of level makes|pg||
nt|mariner1: will someone get shoved too high here?|pg||
nt|cbernstn: 5@C good save on 67|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@H showing a good @S raise|pg||

mb|3C|an|queries, cant see responses|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@S would close this out|pg||
nt|cbernstn: Think 5@C down 1 for push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a large portion of contestants this week playing transfer advances to both overcalls and after 1Major-DBL|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3@C very aggressive with the 11 count|pg||

nt|mariner1: true on a good day this makes,, no 3 3 @H mirror|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cbernstn: Pollack's heart holding unattractive, given the bidding, so game try was aggressive|pg||
nt|hantveit: Sorry, got a phone from Brogeland - he sends his regards.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion N should have bid 3@h over 3@c |pg||
nt|mariner1: well I am not sure 3@C was right opposite the passed hand|pg||

nt|mariner1: 6@S here works|pg||
nt|cbernstn: Nice 6@S slam for EW on this one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do we only have 3 tables on vugraph again today??|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes only 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or just no synch with Closed Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: we do not have a Closed Room here|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: ruling last night changed score by 7 imps|pg||
nt|hantveit: is the hand worth 4h?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Chuck will enter Closed Room scores IF he can get them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too bad -- so audience -- we won't see changing scores until spies get Closed Room results to our operator and he has time to manually enter them into BBO|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: will try to get closed room results when i get a chance|pg||
mb|2D|an|4 cds|nt|ahollan1: each table is in it's own, locked room at the playing site|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2 @D 2 way drury likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D 2-way drury|pg||
nt|mariner1: shows 4 card @S support|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|an|splinter|nt|hantveit: I think I would prefer 3h in MP and 4h in imps. Only 6 losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if available -- i prefer a fit showing jump inn @C|pg||
nt|mariner1: Migry 4@H now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ..... to prevent PARTNER from making a Splinter in @C  :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|d|nt|cbernstn: now the test is to avoid 7|pg||
nt|mariner1: problem with a fit showing here is it makes getting the @H void hard to get across|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, the void is important to show as soon as possible. |pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure why she bid 4@D|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4@d must be wonderful for W|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: W seems to know though :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not uncommon to have agreement to show A/K before shortness|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: now really easy for declarer|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cbernstn: Anyone know which board went to committee last night?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: sorry Cindy I don't , maybe Chuck can find out|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't read bulletin -- didn't even know there was an appeal :(|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with those good @s, a crossruff is probably the best play|pg||

nt|mariner1: Bulletins|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now need to ruff 2 @h|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe a kibber can find out for us :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: no appeal, Director review the hand record, misunderstood a bid, and reversed ruling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do we at least know who's playing in Closed Room?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: when you can see all cards - yes|pg||
nt|cbernstn: Thanks, Chuck.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D-1@H;2@H-?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you are too fast for me Rob :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mariner1: N should make a game try if that is the auction up 2 to 2 @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S help suit game try?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|hantveit: North has 8 losers, south has 7. 10 tricks because of the dbl fit in H and D.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2N even|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N artificial ask about @H length?   nope  I think 2@H end|pg||
nt|ralfwil: confusing or?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: I think the hand is worth 3d over 2h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- that took long time for computer to register|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the type hand a team behind can be aggressive on....... so I expect NS in|pg||
nt|mariner1: Closed to bid this game|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mariner1: I would have made a try in N,,,,,,|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: little break here for water|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, norths hand is too good too pass.|pg||
nt|mariner1: of course everything is sitting well|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: For me N´s hand is worth at least 12 points|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if agreement about who makes aggressive move Sasha's pass is more reasonable if opener makes agressive upgrades|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|hantveit: you need trumphs 3-2 68% + diamonds divided or both onside giving you 85% I think|pg||
mc|11|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but i don't downgrade enough to make PASS automatic :)  |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: this hand could be interesting|pg||
nt|cbernstn: They should also be expecting Moss team to be bidding aggressively.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mancuso lead now 10, but Deas-Palmer on their way to 6@S [board 70] where other table 4@S+2|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs a reverse @S hunt to make game MAYBE|pg||
nt|hantveit: they will end up in 4spades I guess... must find spade q to make|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H anyone?|pg||
mb|2D|an|yes, thats what she bid|nt|ahollan1: curiously, i lost [too many] matches against woolsey-manfield, boyd-robinson - many moons ago - when they took conservative route after building nice lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D establishes game force -- Pollack always going to prefer @S though|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hantveit: a club lead ace and a diam q must be ducked...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: this route shows 3 card support where direct raises [including conventional]  show 4+ support|pg||
nt|mariner1: this will be tough to play I think|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|hantveit: very hard to duck the dia q, let us see...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: difficult to find the reversed finess in @s|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: auction makes it hard to shift to @DQ -- but at imps - what other chance to set the contract|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|s8|pc|d6|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||

mc|9|nt|ralfwil: agree cindy!|pg||

nt|ahollan1: we should get a pool going to see how many time lead changes in that match|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S makes EW here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: start with  1@C-P-1@D-1@S  ??|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a lucky 4@s with two aces in front|pg||
nt|mariner1: both missing Aces are in front of the kings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think they'll get to 4@S|pg||
nt|hantveit: will they find it, not enough strength to bid it?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and @s 2-2|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has a rag(ish) 11|pg||
nt|mariner1: not the worst, just not real good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah -- that's a nice 11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no rebid problems|pg||
nt|cbernstn: This is just the sort of action hand that Moss wants.|pg||
nt|hantveit: if you are well behind, you might push a little bit extra on Moss'hand.|pg||
nt|mariner1: open and duck under the table?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: shift N´s and S´s cards and only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think EW find 4@S here no matter what N does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF Cohen passes, does Migry open 14+ - 17 1N?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moss and Migry were very aggressive last night in similar situations|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now THAT would be reasonable state-of-match swing try|pg||
nt|ralfwil: upgrade E with those bad suits? @c A432  and @h J975?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last night  Jack Oest gave a hilarious translation  "14+ = all 14"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4 comparisons have been entered -- Glasson picks up another 5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: To upgrade a 14-points hand, it shall contain a good 5-card suit or a lot of 10 and 9|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al on that hand last night we did see Migry open a 1N that we all agreed was not|pg||
nt|mariner1: a + 14|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: players back|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's right -- it was Migry then too|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: tada :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: and there is the 1N :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but I would open 1@C in north|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hantveit: do they use 14-16 nts?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H Texas to @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if that not an opening, then Sasha definitely should make game try on previous hand|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS standard signals -- odd-even 1st discard|pg||
nt|hantveit: the best is actually to duck this so south can play a low heart later|pg||
