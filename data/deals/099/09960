nt|athene: perhaps he was thinking the @S8 play earlier might be a grosvenor?|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|othered1: is the club finesse clear even on early @D line?|pg||
nt|vbman: then with a dia in bag....|pg||
mb|1N|an|11-14!|nt|Walddk2: 500 is a good result for E-W. N-S have a slam|pg||
nt|athene: that seems a bit far-fetched|pg||
mb|2C|an|!h + !s, 5-4 or better|nt|Walddk2: I have been in much worse|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C=majors,   just the bid N wanted to hear |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|an|.|nt|Walddk2: As the cards lie, you will end up with 13 tricks in spades and hearts|pg||
nt|bobholl: this migth help|pg||
nt|athene: south might well have considered 4@H over the second double|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mariner1: 4@S makes and 3N with both Q @c and @S being stiff|pg||
nt|sheila a: Ok, that's not a weak NT - is it??|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C for majors   which may well put e/w off playing in spades     now may play 3NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: it's often a bad idea to put partner with shortage based on opps' bidding - but there, it did look reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  The heart slam needs 1 of 2 finesses and reasonable breaks, the spade slam is not so good and needs 2 finesses unless clubs break|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: and if north DOES have short diamonds, south has a very nice pure fit in three suits|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results posted at http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/Internationals/SeniorsCamrose2009.htm|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vbman: e may think long minor as dia of mc donagh|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C doubled might have worked out well |pg||
nt|ady: west after penalty  r  n/s vul against not|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Would you not have doubled 5@D with the South hand?|pg||
nt|bobholl: the double is (if penalty oriented ) a bad bid|pg||
nt|athene: if south's X is penalties, it's a terrible bid|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I would still be thinking with the South hand|pg||
nt|athene: if it isn't, north's pass is pretty bad|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead makes this tough, and maybe beats it|pg||

nt|Walddk2: has|pg||
nt|athene: it's a good sac against 2@H though|pg||
nt|othered1: but that lead may help declarer.  |pg||
nt|sybarra: and could have a @H ruff in@S |pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: not likely now|pg||
nt|sheila a: But it's a risky business to lead a singleton in dummy's known long suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: too late |pg||
pc|c7|nt|nigel_k:  A game you would want to bid, especially vulnerable|pg||
nt|athene: the rare unfavourable sac :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzsf: Cz thinking|pg||
nt|ady: if you play in spades   you might get a heart ruffed   and if you play in hearts  you might get a spade ruffed    but still ok for game at the 4 level|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It's simple because the layout is friendly. On a bad day you could go down|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure east needed to be all that scared of spades - if his opps had lots of strength between them, then very likely, their spades were 4-4|pg||

nt|mariner1: np Tim|pg||
nt|vbman: some specs say they cant see hands|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice to get east on lead|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  doubled   800 on a trump lead     but unlikely contract|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: because otherwise south would have been bidding 2@S rather than doubling|pg||
nt|bobholl: not if they play NFB :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: W has to win and pl @D back to have a shot|pg||

nt|sheila a: Presumably E has denied 3 card support|pg||

nt|vugraphzsf: Hallberg's pass at his second turn wasn't alerted|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mariner1: The Irish are in the lead :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what was 2h?|pg||
nt|mariner1: W should bid a @S game|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H looks like Muiderberg/Tartan type|pg||
nt|ady: a part score for n/s in spades  seems the limit|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3S seems about right for W now. i wonder what the delay is|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  If South bids hearts naturally, North is going to 6 diamonds|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: 54 55 56 less than opening count|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: S went for a glass of water|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you don't need much to make 6@D|pg||
nt|bobholl: whicj is cold if you double finesse in @H|pg||
nt|athene: the auction started the same way in the other room but north decided not to bid 6@D|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think 3H at the other table was a second negative, not sure about this one|pg||
nt|vbman: has a trump less for slam consideration|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3@D  |pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: well, south doesn't have a second negative|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need to get hearts right in 6@D. That is not automatic|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Gain for Wales - they stopped out of slam on the 6@c hand|pg||
mb|3S|nt|othered1: The @D callhas clarified things for east.  Whether it's enough is a question.|pg||
nt|don paulus: should try to ruff couple of diamons - but N also single|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for those unfamiliar with Muiderberg, it conventionally means: "i have a bad shapely hand that i want to describe to the opponents so that they can bid a game they would not ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: otherwise bid, and then make it when they otherwise would probably fail"|pg||
nt|mariner1: this can be made|pg||
nt|othered1: That would be the normal line without the @D bid by south|pg||
nt|mariner1: lose a trump, a @D overruff and a @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: but it is the %play :)|pg||
nt|athene: now he will surely bid six|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was going to just crank up my nerve and bid 2 @S here |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzsf: air-con being switched off|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know my pard always bids my singleton |pg||
nt|ady: this seems one too high|pg||
nt|sheila a: Maybe S thought he was too good for a simple 2@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: spade to the nine first round?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: oh no, diamond overruff before that|pg||
nt|sybarra: or club ruffs, @S6 may score |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|nigel_k:  I'd be more worried about missing 7 if I was North|pg||
nt|athene: @CA lead you need no guess|pg||
nt|athene: ruff, draw trumps, play @CQ pitching loser|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Eber won't lead @CA|pg||
nt|bobholl: well it is around 70% now the play :)|pg||
nt|athene: gotta love that @D8 :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: wrong again :(|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: ruff this with @DA for style|pg||
nt|bobholl: now cold :)|pg||
nt|othered1: yeah, south's trump spots are inadequate to the task here|pg||
nt|sheila a: @d likely to be 6-2, is it worth trying to ruff one?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: E might go awry here though|pg||
nt|don paulus: wrong black 9 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: connection slowed down then - was the air-con keeping it up? ;)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|nigel_k:  He will need to work on clubs before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|athene: no, @DK, @D to @D8, @CQ is fine|pg||
nt|athene: you have @S ruff as late entry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Muiderberg enjoys a kind of universal popularity. those who choose to play it apparently love it, and those who play against it love it even more|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: he pulled J, now thinking|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: if he had ruffed with 4@S it might have been more revealing|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|ady: could not see how that play could gain     know he cant get to dummy to enjoy a club trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: but now Cz has a small problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe @D 10 on first trick? |pg||
nt|sybarra: or what carding do they play?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Key for declarer is keep W on lead rather than E|pg||

nt|athene: west didn't expect south to have so much club strength, given he didn't bid 3nt over 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set now. Many thanks to Roz Bernstein, our very capable operator at Wilderness. Well done!|pg||

nt|vugraphzsf: he did play the 5 not the 10|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S again here is easier|pg||
nt|ady: but south might have bid 2@S  instead of re-opening with double and might have bought the contract|pg||
nt|sheila a: indeed|pg||

nt|sybarra: bravely bid 1 nt on the 10xxx hand |pg||
nt|sheila a: better to bid 1NT bravely than 2Nt :)|pg||
nt|ady: yes after 1@C  double  east chose to bid 1NT rather than re-double|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: N says "I'm not allowed to alert the double", S "he's just woken up"!|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzsf: presumably reverse? or perhaps atti?|pg||

nt|vbman: can u ask s player sometime?|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know pard has clubs but......|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|sheila a: Normally worth bidding a good suit like that for the lead|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: I would think so |pg||
pc|h2|nt|nigel_k:  If declarer runs spades N will come under pressure|pg||
nt|mariner1: and @S lead works here|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: N in the tank|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzsf: eyebrows raised in N|pg||
nt|sheila a: It's always a bleak moment when you realise you have led declarer's 6 carder against NT|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c6|pc|h3|pc|c4|pg||

pc|h8|nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: he needs to bare the @CJ|pg||

nt|athene: ah no- that's no use|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h9|pc|d4|pg||

pc|hA|nt|nigel_k:  If North doesn't look too uncomfortable he's probably ok either way :)|pg||

nt|athene: yes - italy-south africa was the big upset of that event|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: undo pls|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible they might power to 7@H - it all comes down to the difference between the @CQ and @CJ |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: a simple 2S over 1NT would leave pd very well placed to make a final decision|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|othered1: not on pointcount -- partner should have a 10+ count for the 1N response to balancing double of 1@C|pg||
nt|sheila a: Yes, E obviously took him for a little extra|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: 4@S could be kickback RKCB for hearts|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: That makes sense. 5@H  2 keycards and trump queen|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|nigel_k:  With a possible bad trump break and uncertainty about the third club and fourth diamond, grand is optimistic|pg||
nt|athene: 5@S looking for the grand - but surely north would just show side kings, not the (critical) @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: i guess if north shows the @SK, south might bid 7, knowing he has a pitch for his third club|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: Another option was for Cope to bid 6@C to ask for 3rd rd control|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: there's a slight question-mark over the trump suit too, as nigel points out|pg||
nt|athene: so this is all pretty reasonable|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see any reason not to finesse clubs, so probably 1430|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes but N does not have to have 2 @c stoppers|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|othered1: Ands west doesn't have to have a real @C suit here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|nigel_k:  There aren't enough entries to play a dummy reversal and discard clubs on diamonds so he will end up finessing|pg||

nt|marlowepi: not sure how that affects the statement that 2S is the obvious rebid for S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ah ok|pg||
nt|mariner1: W has to have someting and he has it ALL behind S|pg||
nt|ady: more imps for Wales|pg||
nt|sheila a: not an unreasonable line, but not a working one|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is the penultimate board,  |pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobholl: both bid corectly IMO|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if the defence hadn't gone just so, they would have had ten tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: correctly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT the most likely contract, but 4@H can also make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: maybe 2@C after 1N....... they need a checkback|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Cope opened 1@S at the other table|pg||
nt|bobholl: that strong a "weak " 2|pg||
nt|mariner1: and N could have raised @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: Mc thought of coming in there!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no need for artificialities when 2S would tell whole story|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: It's a VERY good weak 2|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|athene: i would be uneasy opening 2@S on a hand that good unless partner knew i might have a 6-loser hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well EW in  Open Room found a @c slam try on the Moysian fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|sheila a: W didn't feel his hand worth an intervention in the other room|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobholl: they know each other :)|pg||
nt|don paulus: 11 top tricks in nt|pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: yes, perhaps S restrained himself because he also had playability in diamonds :)|pg||
nt|vbman: the gap widens ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of this session.......|pg||
nt|vugraphzsf: E shakes his head but he doesn't know what's happened in OR|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: 4 top losers    will do well to make     can pick up the clubs|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Eber can pretty much count 9 tricks by setting up diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: well he only has 8 winners for sure, but opps are almost always going to have to help him out|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@D 3@C 2@H are only sure :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The opponents can't avoid giving him a 9th|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|brolucius: He might contrive to lose two hearts, two diamonds and the @SA.|pg||
nt|bobholl: but he doesn't know (yet)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session in 40 minutes...........|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: made 10 tricks in spades  in OR    could be some needed imps back for england|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|othered1: 6N isn't hateful at all and might make.|pg||

nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: He already 'stole' his 9th trick|pg||
nt|athene: the @SK was double-edged - he grabs a ninth trick but risks setting up 5 for opps|pg||
nt|bobholl: but has to guess on small @S now|pg||
nt|athene: well, it would be very unlucky if this gave the defence three spades and @DAK, i suppose|pg||
