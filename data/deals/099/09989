nt|jcwla: I consider the E hand just a hair light and W may have taken it a bit too seriously.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pef: pam was planning on making a three card limit raise of hearts.  perhaps at this vul in these match conditions she's thinking of  bidding 5?  |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|pef: I don't think much of 5h there even under these conditions--she has quite good defense|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: and 5h rates to be down 2 or so with partner passing on her second  round|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Wittes had a tough problem but doesn't feel like 5@H can be right.|pg||
nt|tlc: the 4s bid achieved one of several positive results...|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|jcwla: Obviously with a 50+ imp lead she did not want to write down -620 on this hand.|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Pass does not feel right with Pam's hand but 5@H just feels worse - pd said nothing over 2@H, you were planning on showing a 3-card limit raise, now you're letting them make you ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: bid 5?  Double seems like least of evils although an argument for pass given the match situation.|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|pef: I think at imps pass strikes me as the least of evils.  with partner passing over the 2h cuebid it most likely means she wasn't accepting a 3 card limit raise so no reason to ...|pg||
nt|pef: suspect you have a biddable game.  vul. they were either bidding to make or to push you into a "cheap" save, so you don't rate to beat it more than 1.  just because you have a bit ...|pg||

nt|othered1: I like to open my long suit|pg||
nt|pef: "hate" I mean|pg||

nt|tlc: i raise 1S as well..|pg||
nt|pef: much less of a distortion|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: if i open 1C and have to rebid 2C i have only shown 5 of my cards, opening 1D and rebidding 2C i have described 8...|pg||
nt|othered1: didn't know the system accepted insufficient bids|pg||
nt|jcwla: I'm usually 100% with Jim but those @D's look closer to 3 than 4.|pg||
nt|pef: who said you should rebid 2c?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pef: more room to describe you hand when you get to hear 1c twice in the auction :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: Very strange - it seemed to have removed all of the bids after the opening Pass, so I put them in and then it accepted them later in the auction|pg||

nt|othered1: 3N looks right, it's 2N that I'd wonder about|pg||
nt|pef: doesn't look like it will make, but pam erred in not covering the 10 of clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I have to confess I don't KNOW she bid 3 - it was when I was confused about what had happened to the auction. I'll make sure when they're done|pg||
nt|jcwla: They're pushing here.|pg||
nt|pef: need to play the 10 of hearts right now|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry, I've completely lost the play|pg||
nt|pef: guess she only has 8 tricks so doesn't have to lead the 10 of hearts to beat it, but it's the right play, anyway|pg||
