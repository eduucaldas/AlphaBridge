mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N makes here|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|henryb: Pot :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Lotta|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: may play 3NT here rather than 5@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|sheila a: I feel like I've been transported into the pages of a bad joke book :)|pg||
nt|duschek: I imagined Lady Luck|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|duschek: Although kibitzers propose anything from "No" to "Good" :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|henryb: It is all Jim's ancestors' fault|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Would you all have bid 3@h at this stage?|pg||
nt|ady: dont like 3@H|pg||
nt|duschek: Anyway, hard to imagine any other contract than 3NT here, although the imagination was fine in the closed room|pg||
nt|henryb: I would|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|henryb: now that bid I do not understand|pg||
nt|duschek: With two small hearts and fine suits, 3@D is reasonable|pg||
nt|sheila a: I hope this isn't getting slammish|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to not get too frisky here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I also think 3@D is the smallest lie|pg||
nt|henryb: should show 6-4 IMO. the alternative is to bid 3@s I think|pg||
nt|duschek: East is a tad too strong for simply bidding 3NT on the second round of bidding - which might also get them to the wrong contract if West had a singleton spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H on a doubleton should have an honour|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H sounds stronger than he is to me also|pg||
nt|sheila a: It would be easy for E to imagine W with a singleton @s now|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|mariner1: or an honor as Roland says|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|duschek: In my system, 3@D is no lie. You have to have a bid which does not show extra length, and I prefer for 3@C to show 5-5 rather than for 3@D to show 6-4|pg||
nt|sheila a: Your system is a lot like mine, Jacob|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|sheila a: Anyway they have got to a decent spot so we can only assume within their agreements all was well|pg||
nt|duschek: Usually, the 5-card club suit is more interesting to partner than a 6-card diamond suit, which is why I prefer the system that way|pg||
nt|henryb: I prefer both to show extra length and 3@s to be a punt: no spade stopper, no three hearts, no extra length|pg||
nt|duschek: I wonder if my system has anything in common with Henry's :)|pg||
