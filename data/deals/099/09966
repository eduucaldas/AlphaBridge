mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharynr: do both sides play forcing @C|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|sharynr: i guess so :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzrd: yes estonian beach diamond has strong 1 cl opening :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharynr: love that name.....beach diamond :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: North still proving he likes to bid!|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzrd: oo yes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrd: opps asked about 1 sp|pg||
nt|vugraphzrd: natural or seminatural was answer|pg||
nt|xenya: now NS may get into trouble|pg||
nt|sharynr: perhaps he should bid 1@D to at least get a lead in that suit :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|xenya: then i undo too|pg||

nt|sharynr: by|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|xenya: still 9 tricks are there: 2@Cs, 3@Ds, 2@Hs and 2@S|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: nothing the defence can do about this -- except presenting declarer with a 10th trick|pg||

nt|xenya: however it seems right for EW to stop below game|pg||
nt|xenya: how good is 3N here -- 12%?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|sharynr: it certainly does not feel like it needs to be bid (as in bd 3):) a plus is a plus|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|sharynr: hopefully north will not be looking for slam :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|mb|2H|mb|3H|nt|sharynr: 1NT with no stopper in @S...was it conventional?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|xenya: just a diversion i think|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharynr: 4@D!!!|pg||
nt|xenya: as is 4@D|pg||
nt|sharynr: more diversion?|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|mb|5H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|sharynr: if Oja and Tihane played together,,,the bidding would never end|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharynr: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrd: they have played|pg||
nt|sharynr: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzrd: all at this table have played together|pg||
nt|vugraphzrd: so no surprises here|pg||
nt|sharynr: then they must know each other's styles|pg||
nt|sharynr: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzrd: yeah and a lot of kidding goes around too|pg||
nt|xenya: well what ever E's plan was, it has certainly flopped|pg||
nt|vugraphzrd: thats why they the latest table now|pg||
nt|sharynr: this will be costly, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzrd: already called for 2 round|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sharynr: hahaha|pg||
nt|xenya: should be a cold bottom for EW|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s5|nt|sharynr: this lead should save them a trick|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|xenya: but 4 down is enough for NS to get the top|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S looks a very slight overbid to me -- at least at MPs |pg||
nt|sharynr: after that lead should be easier to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: true |pg||
nt|sharynr: especially once trumps are splitting 2-2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|sharynr: so it is clear that North likes to bid :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 2-2 @Ss is a necessary condition|pg||
nt|xenya: why E didn't lead partner's suit is a mystery though|pg||
nt|sharynr: perhaps he wanted to see dummy first|pg||

nt|vugraphzrd: yes, he did|pg||
nt|sharynr: i dont blame him, as East made a VERY tricky switch to a trump from Qx!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: but yes, as kibitzer points out, he could have discarded last @D from dummy rather than trump|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|xenya: that board shows the difference between the tactics at IMPs and MPs -- at IMPs: at MPs you shouls strive to get a plus score, no matter how small, if you go down on a borderline ...|pg||
nt|xenya: hand, you are certain to get a poor score|pg||
