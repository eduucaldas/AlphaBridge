nt|ahollan1: i like 5@D too george -- but more because Pollack KNOWS Cohen can't cue in red suit|pg||
nt|daman: missed a big chance to put the opps away|pg||
nt|daman: if they bid the grand in the CR     watch out|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: 13 tricks not certain -- need good things to happen in a red suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and decent trump split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and guess which good thing happened :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: so for the puritans, just a question of whether 6@S arrived at convincingly or not -- which gets an extra 5 points :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al no style points?|pg||
nt|daman: my guess is if you were in 7 and had to play it wide open?  you would end up making on a high crossruff after pitching @Ds on the @Hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a sure line for 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well most lines work|pg||
nt|daman: and ruffing @Cs along the way    East cannot get out of her own way on the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure george -- that seems to rely upon @H 33  surely better to try @D first|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s2|pc|d8|pg||

mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|jstokes: yes, very annoying when opponents bid 4@S on this type of hand and need 3-3 spades (and get it)|pg||
nt|jstokes: North very pleased with 3@H :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|xenya: N must be surprised to see 3@H from S|pg||
mb|5H|nt|jstokes: another good vul vs nv save|pg||

nt|mariner1: 7 makes on Q@D find|pg||
nt|mariner1: my guess in 6N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the opening 1@C bid and lead of lowest outstanding @C made the distribution a sure thing|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|mariner1: and 6N it was in Closed Room|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: i've seen a number of pairs now play  1N-4@S as slam try with 4@C & 4@D -- but usually strength is Quantitative rather than slam force|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@S is forcing or a weak minor|pg||
nt|mariner1: her next call describes which|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|onebid: I'd try 5NT - forcing to 6 inv to 7, with opener accepting by bidding suits up the line|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: is 4@D here treated as key card?|pg||
nt|mariner1: no alert so maybe not|pg||
