nt|kareno: We don't use GIB when we comment ... it knows all the cards and we prefer to work hard with declarer :)  |pg||
nt|othered1: will east open?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jstokes: exciting start for the specs -- other room in 7@S here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are in 7 next door|pg||
nt|pef: another slam, actually a grand on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|3for3: indeed 7 a good spot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Walter Johnson|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play Precision with variable NT  10-12 1st/2nd & nv 3rd, 14-16 vul 3rd, 15-17 4th|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|pef: very normal 3nt here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi everyone|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and we're off...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jstokes: Hi Walter|pg||
nt|pef: they did well to get to the grand in the open room.  bidding here might take awhile|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW don't :)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: what happened to Bd 1 I wonder?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Operator we have no score in Movie on Board 1|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bigtrain: how do you play this one?|pg||
nt|pef: not a lot of losers, but the grand is only fair, I think, takes some work to get to 13 tricks if hearts arent' 33|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm impressed they got to the grand - it's hard to bid.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not sure i would want to be in 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: apparently a push in 3 @H |pg||
nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: i updated board 1 in the movie|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Walddk4: In the playoff match Team Glasson are up by 61 IMPs with 32 boards to go|pg||
nt|pef: me neither.  it might actually come down to the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|kareno: Not with hearts 3-3 though.  Two ruffs in dummy and Bob's your uncle!|pg||
nt|jstokes: Sanborn in the other room got to use exclusion (I think), so she knew partner had the @HA and the @SKQ|pg||
nt|bigtrain: you wouldn't make much of a living depending on making grand with this assortment|pg||
nt|pef: opening lead was the 4 of diamonds in the open room.  Kerri Sanborn now in the tank|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: interesting options in the play though|pg||
nt|pef: the seemingly innocuous lead may cause her to go right as unlkely to lead away from a queen against a grand|pg||
nt|jstokes: diamond lead suggests the queen is off|pg||
nt|buffytvs: hi Ellen|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|3for3: after a big rally in the 4th segment|pg||
nt|pef: they must have really closed the gap the last quarter, weren't they down by like 100 before that?|pg||
nt|jstokes: yes, the trailing team won the last set by about 60|pg||
nt|lestergold: 11 tricks one way or the other now likely|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: hard to estimate the probabilities of the grand, but I would think no better than 50%.  anyone try to calculate it?|pg||
nt|kareno: Would love to be a fly on the wall in the OR!!|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi there Ray :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Ellen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C checkback - from Renee's 2@D looks like 2-way checkback|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Rob:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: And Al:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: so Peggy shows 5@S 4+@H invite|pg||
nt|buffytvs: good lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: Valentin is our super operator, hi Valentin|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: hi|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but I think she's ok for 10 tricks still|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: what -- not Chuck?  we've had him for so many matches i forgot there were others doing the deed :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: he'll be soon|pg||
nt|caitlin: well I have had the honour of Valentin:)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I doubt that South is having a big problem on this tirck :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you were at other table -- Chuck pulled double duty for a number of sets when other room wasn't on BBO - so he had to manually entery their scores to satisfy our need to know |pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room they stopped in 3 @S here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there time to knockout @C, lose @H AND ruff @H?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: it's a pushy game but you'd want to be there|pg||
nt|mariner1: N and S were in auction in Open Room|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: some missunderstanding about an alert is cleared with the director|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think key may be that South must win @H and won't have 3rd trump|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bigtrain: here yuou go karen - http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/|pg||
nt|pef: here, no inference on the diamond as leading away from the queen against a small slam much more likely|pg||
nt|bigtrain: fly away|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: too late|pg||
nt|mariner1: true Al, needs to do some ruffing|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: @C looks right - but i'm not sure it matters on the layout|pg||
pc|c2|nt|3for3: probably in the low to mid 60's|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks - I'll see if I can watch both!!|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|buffytvs: giving up on heart ruffs to set up clubs, -- but that's not going to work here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now if defense wants to play 3rd round of trump - they give up tempo because north entry is @DA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no - still 1 @H ruff i think|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pef: has to be a little bit careful with entries here to get all her tricks.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: 5@S, 1@H, 2@D, 1@C 1 @H ruff|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: and the last play was not|pg||
nt|lestergold: the club should wait- get those 3 spade tricks going first|pg||
nt|pef: now the queen of diamonds I think, and then with a heart return might not take the spade finesse and only make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing on spades would have guaranteed 11|pg||
nt|pef: since after the club way, no good path to 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|pef: in the open room kerri sanborn is now at the crossroads of deciding whether to play hearts 33 or take a diamond finesse.  that tiny clue on the opening lead might cause her to go ...|pg||
nt|pef: right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now easy for declarer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes, that cleared things up a lot|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes A@D helped|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|pef: so a chance to win an imp on that board for dinkin|pg||
nt|jstokes: Irina's playing it, and she just made|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|kareno: She did go right.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: declarer doesn't know that though|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|pef: the way she played it looks like she still needed hearts 33|pg||
nt|pef: so yet another lead change|pg||
nt|kareno: No, she needed Qx of diamonds as she played it.  Had a place for the losing heart.|pg||
nt|kareno: But I'm not sure completely what she had in mind - some sort of squeeze I think.|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, sorry.. was talking about OR.  See what happens when I have too many screens to watch!|pg||
nt|pef: allan falk points out the right play at this point is heart club squeeze or hearts 33.  win the j of spades|pg||
nt|pef: ruff a club, heart to the ace draw trump, k of diamonds, diamond j|pg||
nt|pef: that works if the long heart is with the ace of clubs or hearts 33|pg||
nt|ahollan1: soft play of @DA -- not sure what Glasson was hoping for --- hang on -- maybe declarer 5521|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|buffytvs: now South has to win the heart and has no more trumps...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah - still no rush to play @D|pg||
nt|caitlin: strange with QJx in dummy|pg||
mc|9|nt|mariner1: so off 1 anyway|pg||

nt|pef: if she was going to play three hearts why not draw the last trump?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: heart rerturn and North got to ruff it with the @SJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: well Renee and Lisa were innocent on that hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i expect that spcs are praying for a more exciting han d than the last two|pg||
nt|pef: oh well, was playing for 4 imps as it turned out|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW make 3N here if they get there|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 3@C - 3NT?|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|ahollan1: 3@C-3N looks very likely|pg||
nt|buffytvs: aha|pg||
nt|mariner1: well no 3N for EW now|pg||
mb|d|nt|pef: battle of the minor suits here|pg||
nt|3for3: heavy 3d seat preempt here|pg||
nt|jstokes: how many diamonds now?|pg||
nt|jstokes: 4 works best on this one|pg||
nt|caitlin: well they got there quickly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well we knew SOMEBODY would bid 3N :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: S may yet pass|pg||
nt|buffytvs: probably a 1-suited minor hand -- not Gambling.  They likely play Namyats|pg||
nt|sybarra: not my typical 3 nt opening, ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the tangential benefit of playing Namyats|pg||
nt|mariner1: S knows the suit is @c|pg||
nt|caitlin: nor mine|pg||
nt|sybarra: (but I play gambling) |pg||
mb|4C|nt|lestergold: e/w cant quite makle the game|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4c limit|pg||
nt|caitlin: as I do|pg||
nt|mariner1: N is just jamming as much as possible... makes it tough for EW to find a spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes NS play Namyats with 3N covering normal 4@C/@D preempts|pg||
nt|buffytvs: it's  frisky, but I like aggressive preempts 3rd chair white against red|pg||
mb|d|nt|pef: not best if e/w figure out to hit this, but that's unlikely, 5c seems painful but likely|pg||
nt|lestergold: i suspected it wouldbe overboar|pg||
nt|pef: goldberg might double now to show extra defensive values|pg||
nt|caitlin: on last hand 3@S+1|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am with Ray....... aggression :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: certain does make it difficult for e/w |pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room N opened 3@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: *certainly|pg||
nt|caitlin: it's called tetesterone:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the swing not so much from system as from decision to open at 3 or 4 level|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 2 4@S here -1  in Open Room 3@S +1 so 6 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|jstokes: 7 imps -- 2310 would be lose 20|pg||
nt|buffytvs: EW could end up anywhere now  -- very hard for them|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: west not surprisingly with 5 card support hopes for thevulnerable game to rollc in|pg||
nt|pef: especially since she believe her partner is likely to have a stiff diamond after the 4d bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and partner does but sadly pard apart form goo suit is minimum for the bid|pg||
nt|3for3: good lead by sprung, she will be able to judge the shift too|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: oh right, they were vul.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bigtrain: next|pg||
nt|kareno: Is this a repechage movement?  One to qualify?  Or two teams?  Thanks.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2 teams|pg||
nt|3for3: 2 to q|pg||
nt|jstokes: the winner of this match is USA1 -- the loser plays another 96 board match|pg||
nt|pef: there is a playoff for who gets to play the loser of this match for USA2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so @CAm ruff, a heart, a diamond and maybe a spade too|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pef: looks like the 3rd push to start this segment|pg||
nt|kareno: So the playoff going on now is meaningful - winner of that plays loser of this.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bigtrain: y|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kareno: Been there, done that!  |pg||
nt|pef: in the playoff glasson was up by 120 or so imps after 3 segments, it was down to 20 or so going into the last segment|pg||
nt|bigtrain: back up around 50 last i looked|pg||
nt|mariner1: the mirrored hands and 4 - 2 @H make this moysian a loser|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: cant be made tho whatever the shift only be made if north overtook dim and led heart away from the \K|pg||
nt|kareno: When you lose the Final match, you are going into a match on a downer and the other team you have to play has just won its match.  It's tough.|pg||
nt|jstokes: 45 now|pg||
nt|pef: back up to 45 now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: around 50  :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|caitlin: 3N E-W in other room|pg||
nt|mariner1: the 3rd @S and the 4 @D are double problens|pg||
nt|mariner1: problems|pg||
nt|caitlin: so an opening 3N sure did its work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can we get somebody to run quick simulation about what Renee is supposed to do over the DBL|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pef: that play seems unlikely|pg||
nt|3for3: these plays do not look correct|pg||
nt|jstokes: surely not|pg||
nt|lestergold: not likely to happen except on a eugene eunesco film set|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u this is impossible operator please?|pg||
nt|pef: british commentators are all required to use obscure analogies whenever possible :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: IONESCO is the correct sopelling im told by Rumanian watchdog committee|pg||
nt|pef: yes, that is correct.  you may have shot your bolt too early :)|pg||
nt|pef: roland, if you are watching, I just had a spec plead for no cricket comparisons|pg||
nt|lestergold: i have plenty more some fo them made of cardboard or egg yolk and some in shape of boomerang|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N is cold if played for Q@H in S , hooked through N|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|3for3: play likely went d,d draw trump, spade to queen|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: at IMPs -- i suspect Pass wins in long run  at matchpoints, who knows - maybe even 4N [to play]|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|pef: to all the specs sending messages--I think we all believe this line of play is unlikely|pg||
nt|pef: ah there we go|pg||
nt|buffytvs: assuming the dbl just showed cards, either 4NT seems right -- probably the latter|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jstokes: I think it is safe to assume down 1 for a push|pg||

nt|buffytvs: the thing about these hands is that you know things aren't breaking, so don't get too pushy|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the 3N reaps a reward|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so everybody passes -- except Renee|pg||
nt|mariner1: part scores only here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Glasson gets full credit for the swing -- good result coming regardless of Macuso's bid|pg||
nt|buffytvs: perhaps there some agreement about the dbl of 4@C that we're not aware of|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: chance for a swing her|pg||
nt|jstokes: Deas-Palmer like to open the bidding :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pef: interesting enough on the last board, one team was in 7s and the other 6, but in this case 7 went down so 17 imps to the side that bid only 6|pg||
nt|mariner1: someone might get shoved up 1 too high|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pef: so a 30 imp swing on whether or not you make 7s--certainly one of the largest swings possible|pg||
mb|2H|nt|othered1: You open south's hand?  I agree with pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without interference, 4@C may be ask about hand type -- perhaps DBL said - hey i was going to say that|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: chance just evaporated|pg||
nt|pef: yes e/w might get to game.  3nt has no play on a spade lead and duck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more likely -- i have some cards but no direction|pg||
nt|mariner1: will E call again?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: probably 2s now?|pg||
nt|jstokes: 1@D for them promises none or more|pg||
nt|3for3: how can one promise nothing?|pg||
nt|pef: or double?|pg||
nt|pef: so what's the panel consensus for the right bid by east?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s|pg||
nt|3for3: i bet double|pg||
nt|jstokes: I think I like X -- keeps it low and she may not be forcing to game (although that is somewhat extreme)|pg||
nt|lestergold: west can only bid 2n and east can then pass or bid 3d as long as 3d would not be forcing|pg||
nt|3for3: thats the problem with 2@S, too bulky|pg||
nt|lestergold: too strong for a diamond limit raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|jstokes: West will be eager to rebid her diamonds|pg||
pc|cA|nt|3for3: 1nt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: double is fine|pg||
nt|pef: now maybe 2n all pass?|pg||
nt|caitlin: harder vul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sutherlin not very far from having hand that could DBL 2@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: hard to bid with 7 losers RED|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as takeout|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to get the @D ruff in this time  or cash |pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: maybe better if it keeps them low!|pg||
nt|jstokes: I'm sure you are right about the all pass -- less sure about 2N|pg||
nt|pef: but vul. at imps, bidding only 2n with three aces is going to take a lot of discipline|pg||
nt|lestergold: west goinmg nowhere unless dsragged kicking and screaming|pg||
nt|3for3: maybe 2@D now|pg||
nt|pef: so I guess 2d, 2s, 2n, 3n are all possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: when you open on that pile of festering garbage your heart sinks every time ur pard makes a forcing bid|pg||
nt|jstokes: I think they are used to it|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes im used to watching it|pg||
nt|pef: some people have suggested 3d but I think that's unlikely because of their methods|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|pef: let's be fair, it may be garbage, but you have no evidence it is actually festering|pg||
nt|jstokes: good prediction Peter|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: and just in time subsided|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: oh i like to pile on the adjectives |pg||
nt|lestergold: without an ace and the qualioty of the 5 card suit it festers!|pg||

nt|kareno: I don't|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Glasson off to a fast lead but we have seen these matches before and lot of bds to play |pg||
nt|mariner1: could see action here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|pef: four pushes in a row--very unlike all the segments yesterday|pg||
nt|bigtrain: more likely to open E than S|pg||
nt|pef: at least with those who would give me a dirty lucky when I put down that dummy in 3nt :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Palmer passed an equivalent hand in 3rd seat last board|pg||
nt|kareno: And I'm more likely to open south's :)|pg||
nt|pef: east just opened a significantly worse hand here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems we heard that in last Glasson match|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D leads tap N in @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|kareno: Piece of cheese.|pg||
nt|pef: wow, boy do I hate that double|pg||
nt|othered1: dbl?  A psychic negative double?|pg||
nt|kareno: Me too!  |pg||
nt|bigtrain: ahhh - the attracton of favorable vulnerability|pg||
nt|othered1: redouble probably shows more @C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it makes you feel invulerable  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and here another likely opne|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard for n/s to stay out of 4s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pef: the major excuse for bidding on deas hand is that since her partner didn't open 1c, she thinks opps. likely have a vul. game|pg||
nt|pef: is 2d natural or a cue bid here given that 1d shows zero or more?|pg||
nt|pef: hope they discussed that|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: can N come in at all?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N now?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bigtrain: has to be a Q once 2@C is in play|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't know - I would not bid it with north's hand.  No fit, no direction.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: not clear to me why it's so hard, 11 opposite 11 and both have 3 hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: the duplication in hearts will not be expected by either of them|pg||
nt|pef: why not, west didn't bid 2h|pg||
nt|lestergold: south has a good quality 11  and northchunky too|pg||
nt|3for3: good stop, and the first swing of the set, it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah buit i forgot north doesnt bid!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this time she wilol be rewarded|pg||
mb|3N|nt|3for3: she showed a lim raise, and is now done|pg||
nt|othered1: That could be dangerous without discussion, but playing against amorphous @D is so common, I"m sure they know what's up here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: I think north might have bid 3s, but then south should probably pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: anyone else would at least find a 3s bid which would put south under pressure |pg||
nt|pef: to answer the question from a few specs.  only we get to see the running imp score. the players don't know it|pg||
nt|mariner1: over 2N I think not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- just don't let me pick stocks|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so a gain for Mancuso now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N makes too|pg||
pc|h7|nt|othered1: And 3N is a fine spot|pg||
nt|pef: dinkin gained 3 imps on the passout|pg||
nt|pef: n/s played 3c making in the open room|pg||
nt|othered1: But NS in other room got in reopening after east had opened 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rob still smoking something intersesting -- hallucinating that N might ever enter auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: and makes 4 now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pef: yep, first blood in this segment|pg||

nt|ahollan1: soooo close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: start on @S -- if NS don't continue @H then extras|pg||
nt|ahollan1: once 2nd @H played -- claim10|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: a not insignificant 6imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: I doubt defense would allow 11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is not a @S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: oh maybe now @SQ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: Chuck is taking ove|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pef: at the other table, north opened the bidding which led to a 1d 1h 1s p 2s p 4s auction|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: odd-even 1st discard - @S4 tough to read|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|bigtrain: beth wasn't able to get the joke -- she still think lynn may have her bid|pg||
nt|bigtrain: could have won an IMP with a @D shift|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|pef: she might make only 2 if she ruffs a club high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done Lisa|pg||
nt|buffytvs: good play by Berkowitz, although nothing metters here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|buffytvs: hops with @SA to preserve poartner's entry|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: lets face it its a bit unlucky no heart lead and it rolls in obviously all hearts in one hand and a bid so will always get a heart lead|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pef: if she was going to play clubs, better to play a spade to dummy and lead one covering whatever was played.  if qjxx on her left she still has the diamond entry to cash the spade ...|pg||
nt|pef: and take the heart finesse|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, the king of clubs is a tired play.|pg||
nt|pef: leading the k of clubs first never gains over that|pg||
nt|pef: now she'll most likely settle for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: Not a good time to get tired.  If you lose this set, you're back for two more sets tonight.|pg||
nt|pef: very good point. good news is, loser doesn't necessarily lose, bad news is, 96 more boards!|pg||
nt|jstokes: also good everone has 6 on their team|pg||
nt|othered1: yes.  going through this with only 4 woiuld require amazing stamina|pg||
nt|pef: I think one of the teams in the playoff is only 4 handed|pg||
nt|3for3: no|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: but we have all bid and made many games on these two hand types|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pef: actually the club spots are perfect, so she will make 3|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: will they find it?|pg||

nt|pef: south, I mean, not douth|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jstokes: on a similar hand yesterday Deas-Palmer were the only hand to bid a good slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: gross underbidding by west in the open room|pg||
nt|caitlin: too flat for me |pg||
nt|caitlin: I like 11s to have better shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2.5 quicks, easy rebids with both majors -- automagic|pg||
nt|mariner1: those nice majors are too tempting|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no suit, no rebid, 8 losers vulnerable -- not for me|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: rebid is easy if p responds a major or 1N|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pef: at the other table after a 1s opening east bid four card drury (2d) and west bid 4c a splinter, east naturally bid 4s, and west passed.  I think west was worth at least another try|pg||
nt|3for3: second time deas has bid blackwood with a void this match|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: here west has not been put off by the splinter she doesnt want to hear- the splinter does not deny the KD!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: if p bids 1@D I risk 1@H,, life is good|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well rebid over 1@D depends upon agreement -- if frequently bypass @D then 1N a [strong] contender|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: 5d presumably saying can you help in diamonds?|pg||
nt|jstokes: now 6@D will put here at ease|pg||
nt|jstokes: probably for spade queen|pg||
nt|3for3: deas assumes partner has some diamond card, but couldnt the k of diamonds be kc?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|lestergold: so guessing about the dim|pg||
nt|pef: yes, very likley east has at least one high diamond honor|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh yes likely but oplenty of room to have more in clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: and less in diamonds|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: at any rate most of us would drive to slam on the west hand with very little encouragement fro pard|pg||
nt|pef: 6s certainly isn't laydown, but the 44 heart split will make the play easy|pg||
nt|pef: many play that both 4s and 4n by north on this auction show different type of strong balanced hands.  they bid 4s at the other table which presumably is 44 in the minors and ...|pg||
nt|pef: forcing to at least 4nt|pg||
pc|cT|nt|buffytvs: and opposite a balanced 6-count you go for a quiet 500...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: even playing 4 card majors, i'd bid 1@C before 1@H -- can't handle 2@D response|pg||

nt|pef: 2d is multi for those who just came in|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 16+ HCP|pg||
mb|2D|an|gf 5+D's|nt|lestergold: but bidding close games is not Ms. Goldberg's forte|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 8+ HCP, 5+@D  forcing to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: shows a weak 2 in one of the majors|pg||
nt|othered1: Ew can make a partial, so Mancuso is likely looking at 4 or 5 imps|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mariner1: 2 @D is an interesting bid on these cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|jstokes: this will test Mike's theory about North's "never bidding"|pg||
nt|lestergold: this theory has been confirmed time and time again already|pg||
nt|3for3: we would all raise to 3@H if the K@S was elsewhere|pg||
nt|pef: i think 2s is nearly automatic vul. at imps.  |pg||

nt|mariner1: oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well my thoery confirmed again|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@C = 4@H|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pef: yeah, south is endplayed with anything but a trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: I said yesterday that Ms. Goldberg's coach should have a quiet word and tell her that green is not always beautiful|pg||
nt|3for3: game isn't a bargain without both red tens...|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: one of the advantages of multi is the transfer effect|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: green being the colour of the [pass card if you hadnt worked it out!|pg||
nt|3for3: green was pretty good on the hand they avoided the zero play 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: for every bad game they miss there will be 2 or more games missed that roll in|pg||
nt|robinswr: if you are going to make a game try, maybe you should bid 3diamonds which is nf if partner has three hearts and invitational if partner has four hearts|pg||

nt|mariner1: 4@H has good play here EW|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|pef: well being passive on this one will gain imps.  but seeing the prior result n/s may overcompensate|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would be more likely to have bid 3hearts over 1heart|pg||
nt|3for3: me 2, steve, but just short there too|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pef: possible the opening bid will keep ns out of the doomed 3nt, but probably they'll still be in game|pg||
nt|mariner1: can NS hold a 4@S save to 300?|pg||
nt|caitlin: tapped in hearts|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Sutherlin will find the @DQ now if she needs to in 4@H|pg||

nt|mariner1: cross ruff and slide 10@S past W|pg||
mb|3H|nt|3for3: normal to drive to game here|pg||
nt|pef: granted 4s can be made here with an unlikely spade guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree with 2h and something in reserve the stiff Ks was not pulling its weight in that 14 count|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: no 3nt it will be|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pef: 3h is a splinter raise of diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: wwo she splintered on this minimum hand!!|pg||
nt|robinswr: i must admit that 2diamonds is not the bid i would make here.  Either 2clubs which could be random or 2hearts which promises 5|pg||
nt|pef: playing 2/1 splinters like that don't show extras|pg||
nt|lestergold: someone injected her with something??|pg||
nt|3for3: this just shows 4 trump, they are already in a game force|pg||
nt|jstokes: after GF 2/1, splinters don't show extras (for most)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i see|pg||
nt|othered1: Will east lead partner's suit (and her own) against 3N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: they should be sound openers which goldberg has|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: i think i would bid 4spades assuming that shows a weak hand|pg||
nt|3for3: need another pass|pg||
nt|jstokes: need undo pls|pg||
nt|pef: i think we get the idea|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not that anyone was going to bid it, but 3NT makes EW|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: nice bid Renee |pg||
nt|rodal f: Might rater think at a 5@H after the honors placed at N|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and now 4@H is fairly easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky lead Joann|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: I this can be made but requires some very good views|pg||
nt|othered1: It's possible here that west had nothing in @D and long @C, but east made the right judgment|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|jstokes: no reason I can see to get spades right|pg||

nt|pef: although probably only down 1 for a 2 imp gain|pg||

nt|lestergold: arguable should have ducked the q|pg||
nt|lestergold: operator was the7 dim played?|pg||
nt|pef: so the margin now 2 imps|pg||

nt|pef: long break given they are already a bit behind time|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1: I don't understand line of play.  Couldn't @D be 4-4?|pg||

pc|c2|nt|jstokes: yes, they lead 3rd and 5th vs NT|pg||
nt|othered1: On the other hand, the auction didn't give up much about north's hand, and is it absolute they'd continue @D?|pg||

nt|pef: never mind|pg||
nt|jstokes: did well to get to game at other table -- pretty lucky one|pg||
nt|pef: certainly a chance for a swing here.  4s not a very good contract, but both aces are onside and it makes|pg||
nt|3for3: essentially on 2 hooks.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: contract is 4s by east|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: i missed the bidding|pg||
nt|3for3: enter a 4@S opening for east|pg||
nt|mariner1: yet another 3N EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: if opener could have the 5-card suit, maybe running @C would have applied some pressure.|pg||

nt|3for3: last hand was only 1 down, we think|pg||

mb|p|nt|jstokes: 6@C here at the other table -- no play|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: they claimed down 1|pg||
nt|3for3: this could tighten things considerably|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al you and I need more eyes...... or are we confused by the "three" we not have?|pg||
nt|mariner1: now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C or 1@D?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pef: that make sense.  so actual score must be 146-138|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: :)|pg||
nt|pef: probably a 14-16 nt opening and west just transferred to game?|pg||
nt|3for3: that is their range|pg||
nt|3for3: an unlikely low heart lead would work|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|kareno: It's quite a match!|pg||

nt|buffytvs: me too|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pef: really?|pg||
nt|jstokes: ah yes|pg||
nt|jstokes: of course|pg||
nt|buffytvs: keeps both suits in play, while 1@d usually losed clubs completely|pg||
mb|p|nt|jstokes: WOW|pg||
nt|lestergold: well here is an example of a game that on   abad day would be drifting 2 or so off|pg||
nt|pef: goldberg better return the king of clubs so sprung can get the lead of the event award|pg||
nt|lestergold: woo what a lead|pg||
nt|pef: would like to see the auction that allowed her to work that out|pg||
nt|3for3: is this correct?|pg||
nt|lestergold: now a chance for ms. Goldberg to shine not difficult tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: we would lie to know why the natural lead of the qd was not advanced|pg||
nt|3for3: for those wondering, the auction is not correct, the operator missed it, and just 'caught up' by entering the final contract as the opening bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: even if you forsee rebid problems?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a 1 @D opener,  |pg||
pc|s2|nt|bigtrain: comfortable spot and a new (likely) leader|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N nice call|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe Hideous Hog approach of opening WEAKER minor :)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: i have an easy NT rebid over anything|pg||
nt|caitlin: ughh|pg||
nt|caitlin: singleton?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: different problem|pg||
nt|caitlin: 1-4-4-4|pg||
nt|mariner1: Glasson still has Moss on the Schneid so far.......|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 1444, playing strong NT, you have to open 1@D on a minimum hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pef: so barring something really strange happening with 6c, this will be 10 or 11 imps to mancuso and yet another lead change|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF 2@D forcing to 3@D [i.e. 2N forcing] then i don't like 3N unless it shows this specific strength|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|sybarra: bet the claim is fast|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@D inverted I would think|pg||

pc|h3|nt|3for3: 5@C is a good spot for EW though, so -200 is not so bad|pg||
nt|pef: but note that 4s is actually cold on these cards e/w and in fact in the playoff match was reached at at least one table|pg||

pc|sK|nt|pef: lots of ways to beat this--one way to let it make|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes no way round that because a heart hjas to be ruffed|pg||
nt|robinswr: i think she should have bid keycard |pg||
nt|3for3: a precision expert predicted 6@C was possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh my theyve bid it!!|pg||
nt|robinswr: 4diamonds followed by 4spades would tell her that no club honor was opposite|pg||
nt|pef: actually it goes down even if the ace of diamonds is led.  only entry to dummy is a heart ruff and then you can't ruff a spade successfully|pg||
nt|lestergold: sad club finesse right but no play|pg||
nt|3for3: one mans sad...|pg||
nt|3for3: joann should have a fair idea that east is void in diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 imps to Mancuso unless as spec has suggested.... club lead but i dont think so|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: lots of chat concerning possible hand shape by east and west|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead i lay money on|pg||
nt|lestergold: safe and unbid|pg||
nt|3for3: I don't believe 2@C was forcing, so Lynn effectively had the choice of 2 or 6|pg||
nt|pef: a spade or a low heart lets 6c make, any other lead beats it (according to the all powerful gib)|pg||
nt|pef: but I agree with lester, the q (or j depending on methods) of hearts seems rather likely|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think gib today is not a gibbon|pg||
nt|pef: once again for the new specs.  we get to see the barometer scoring, but the players do not.  however since this segment currenlty is 18-18, its the same massive 2 imp margin we ...|pg||
nt|pef: started with at board 81|pg||
nt|3for3: 4nt was roman keycard for hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems a bit high to be playing specific kings -- slight improvement would be to use 5@S rather than 5NT|pg||
nt|kareno: Normally an attacking lead is a good idea against a slam and Lynn Deas does so.|pg||
nt|3for3: in 6 at other table|pg||
nt|pef: she really can't go wrong here except for the overtrick|pg||

nt|othered1: If there's a tie, how many boards in overtime?|pg||

mb|3D|nt|buffytvs: ah, it's unlimited|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 4 @H better |pg||

nt|ahollan1: promoting @S tenace |pg||
nt|buffytvs: I agree Al -- too good|pg||
nt|sybarra: too good? |pg||
nt|mariner1: agree, too good with AQ @S over N|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I'd bid 4@H without the spade cards for example|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H sounds like weak hand, no defense|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5D|nt|pef: after pass by sprung, of course the winning call here would have been pass by deas, but that's nearly impossible to find|pg||
nt|3for3: Goldberg did well to stay mum the next round....16 points but no tricks|pg||
nt|pef: several specs make rude comments about west's opening bid|pg||
nt|pef: unfortunately mike gold is no longer here to call it "festering"|pg||
nt|3for3: in 1NT north south other room|pg||
nt|jstokes: look at those tens!|pg||
nt|jstokes: they open (almost) all 11 counts, so this in only slightly subpar|pg||
nt|bigtrain: more than slightly -- have a feeling it goes back to when they played the mini-NT at this color|pg||
nt|pef: being this close after so many boards is really physically as well as mentally draining|pg||
nt|pef: I do feel sorry for whoever has to play a bunch more tonight|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 32 tonight and 64 tomorrow!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now -- should Sutherlin bid 4@C along the way - is another good question|pg||
mb|5H|nt|lestergold: xchance for a much needed earner for Dinkin here|pg||
nt|passell: hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice 5@H|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 4@H presumably has some specific meaning in terms of strength or slam interest|pg||
nt|mariner1: maximizes the return|pg||
mb|d|nt|3for3: hi mike|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree there Shirly. A stright 4 @H bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: lotta red cards on the bidding board|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3: this is a good setup for precision|pg||
nt|pef: a subtle point but the opening 6 of hearts lead probably convinced declarer that it was better to take the second spade finesse instead of the second heart finesse.  they lead 3/5|pg||
nt|passell: very  exciting|pg||
nt|3for3: yikes|pg||
nt|pef: meanwhile in the playoffs with 2 boards to go it's over and glasson is the winner (they are up by 49 imps)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: so the loser here plays glasson in a few hours|pg||
nt|kareno: Absolutely, Peter.  You get to a point where you're like walking wounded!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: unbelieveable early deathj of auction in open|pg||
nt|3for3: much of this team, with kareno, qualified for the 2003 Venice trophy as USA2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|nt|pef: not so unbelievable in standard|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the Playoff match between Glasson and Moss, Glasson only up by 28 IMPs now. The margin was 127 IMPs at some point last night!|pg||
nt|pef: passing with werst over 2c is a little conservative, but nv with an unexciting 7 count is it so clear to advance to the 3 level|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c infrangible 6c  on good day as today for example buty give it a 4/2 ht break and its not such chopped liver|pg||
nt|3for3: but as i recall, they lost 1st round then won 2, not the other way around|pg||
nt|pef: oops, played her partner for a doubleton spade it appears, and 2h may now make instead of failing immediately|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|pef: very hard to see how 2c made only 4 in the open room.  I wonder if that's a scoring error with clubs 22 and hearts 33.  what three tricks could she lose?|pg||
nt|3for3: it made 6|pg||
nt|3for3: +4|pg||
nt|sybarra: I seemed to have been been out voted,  but the X will help Mancuso team perhaps |pg||
nt|buffytvs: so two aces for the defense, and that's it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anybody have anything good to say about Lisa's DBL?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|3for3: 2+4=6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|kareno: Indeed, we conceded the equivalent of THIS match so we would have energy to fight the repechage match.  That worked out well for us.|pg||
nt|caitlin: no|pg||
nt|ahollan1: best response -- shows all 4 Jacks|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|pef: but still rates to go down|pg||
nt|buffytvs: probably a forcing pass situation at these colours|pg||
nt|rodal f: In white. Def are at @S AQX and u have a lot in pards color. 4@H strigt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hope not -- all actions made under pressure  -- and 3@D surely wasn't an underbid|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pef: oh, sorry, yes, made 6.  my eyes are going, I just saw the 4 and not the 170 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: it depedns on ur methods of 2c is not a  one round fource the n maybe east should bid 3c or at least agree that with a minimu and 4 clubs partner m,ust raise|pg||
nt|robinswr: palmer should have bid 6clubs again|pg||
nt|pef: :)|pg||
nt|pef: a reminder to the specs who are asking why palmer opened 1c.  they are playing a strong club system|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do we have a tie after this board?|pg||
nt|3for3: we have a couple of good boards coming|pg||
nt|jstokes: we do|pg||
nt|pef: no, this should be 7 imps for 450 or a swing of 280|pg||
nt|pef: so dinkin roars back into the lead by 1, I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Right, 123-124|pg||
nt|jstokes: does make 5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|robinswr: unlucky the vulnerabilties are reversed on these two hands|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||

pc|c7|nt|pef: well only 1 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so no practice finesse|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did E expect to by it at @H after this bid?|pg||

nt|3for3: i doubt jo will|pg||
nt|3for3: too strong|pg||
nt|robinswr: too strong|pg||
nt|pef: hmm, that seems odd, although maybe n/s play lower of touching honor leads and then 10 was ambiguous?|pg||
nt|3for3: yes they do|pg||
nt|pef: danny, do they play roussineau leads?|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores here unless someone gets too energetic|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: will West transfer to @H or use Garbage Stayman?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|3for3: she'd be more likely to open 2@C|pg||
nt|pef: I agree with that completely|pg||
nt|mariner1: W transfer or garbage stayman?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: garbage|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: ah, that explains it.  n/s lead the lower of touching honors, so the 10 showed the j or shortness|pg||
mb|2D|nt|passell: gambling 3 nt seems like a strange bid since slam is so possible|pg||
nt|pef: the first comment, not the opening 2c.  zero possible defensive tricks seems wrong to open 2c|pg||
nt|pef: now what?|pg||
nt|robinswr: is that a penalty double or a negative double?|pg||
nt|3for3: She would never open either, just more a point that the hand is too good for 3nt|pg||
nt|3for3: too many flaws for Jo to preempt|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al types faster|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: both :)|pg||
mb|2H|an|garbage/|nt|3for3: might get to 3nt now|pg||
nt|pef: an awful lot of people would open 2s nv on that hand despite the flaws|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 43 fit instead of 52|pg||
nt|mariner1: garbage it is|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|robinswr: with a weak hand it might be right to pass 1spade and wait for a reopener|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: but she did well to avoid doing so|pg||
nt|othered1: Disciplined weak 2's have lots of plusses to them.|pg||
nt|3for3: 2d seat, poor suit, side ace, side Qxx in a major.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: of course not a whole lot of quick entries to the south hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: time for a non-systemic pass?|pg||
nt|3for3: one slow one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously - last night every time responder chose to transfer - found partner with best fit in longest suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: no quick entry to dummy hurts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here - nothing but doom and gloom|pg||
nt|caitlin: @D lead should help|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the 'natural' diamond lead will help|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who don't like the term Garbage Stayman -- some call it Scrambling Stayman :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: By those 2HPs in W u had to be right AL:)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: wd to not lead a diamond|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|pef: not arguing with you at all, but I stand by my statement.  there is a school (ask kit woolsey for example) who believe greatly undisciplined preempts occasionally fool partner but ...|pg||
nt|pef: more often fool opponents|pg||

nt|pef: even he she had guessed right, would still have a lot of work to do given the way diamonds split|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|robinswr: when the score is between down 1, just making and making with an overtrick, redouble is with the odds|pg||

mb|p|nt|pef: seems nearly impossible to get to slam at this point|pg||
nt|pef: they did open 2s on the previous board in the open room.  west overcalled 3h and is playing it there|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@S 2@H 3@D and 2@C means slam easy|pg||
nt|mariner1: N will press this to slam I think|pg||
nt|buffytvs: change North's D!J to the C!J and it's not nearly as good a contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: in addition to the a of clubs,  best card in J of @S|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||

mb|2H|nt|pef: also to bbo for making it possible, especially roland wald for his tireless work in arranging all of the commentary|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: interesting pass by north, but very reasonable when you think about it|pg||
nt|jstokes: Deas again fearless|pg||
nt|pef: I think I would have passed out 1s by south.  where are the hearts?|pg||
nt|jstokes: Thanks, Peter.  And thanks to Roland, the USBF and Jan Martel|pg||

mb|4S|an|kickback|nt|pef: a spec points out correctly that west can't be 55 or better in the majors because they play a 2h opening bid is that hand|pg||

nt|jstokes: Thanks, Peter.|pg||
nt|pef: ed shapiro  (and anyone I missed)|pg||
nt|robinswr: Danny Sprung|pg||
nt|pef: and to bbo of course for making it all possible with Roland Wald not being pair nearly enough for arranging all of this|pg||
nt|passell: 3clubs dbld only went 1 down in other room|pg||
nt|pef: Ah, yes, Danny, who did his very best to be non partisan|pg||
nt|pef: they are in 5c on board 95 in the open room.  that would appear to be going down a peaceful 1 for a tie|pg||
nt|jstokes: Sanborn-Levitina in 5@C on last board, so seems a push|pg||
nt|kareno: 5@c in the OR on the 3nt hand.  That will be a push or possibly down two for a pickup for Mancuso.|pg||
nt|pef: so barring anything really bizarre there, the edge has to go to mancuso|pg||
nt|pef: e/w would have to go for a number in the open room on this board to swing enough imps|pg||
mb|5S|nt|pef: and to Jan Martel of the USBF for all the operations work in Sacramento and her dedicated vugraph volunteers|pg||
nt|mariner1: 34 total imps in 13 compares is on the lean side this session|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|ahollan1: more amazing 10@H making is a push|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 4Sx was RKCB effectively, 5@H was 2 with the Q|pg||
nt|mariner1: undo|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Rene bidding 6@H before Lisa can get there |pg||
nt|mariner1: big opening here|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: yes preempt|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|caitlin: 5@H alerted as 2 without???|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pef: Mancuso is going to leap back into the lead with this bid gain|pg||
nt|passell: down 1 now|pg||
nt|pef: so she'll be making either 2 or three here|pg||
nt|kareno: It's a heartbreaker to lose such a close match and then have to play your heart out again in another long one to follow.|pg||
nt|pef: somebody just said 5c made in the open room|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|buffytvs: you really need South to be asking -- then she can value those black QJ combinations|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pef: actually a bunch of people just did|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kareno: Oh, my.  If  5@c made then this match has just reversed yet again.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pef: wow, apparently shawn quinn won a diamond with the ace and returned a diamond|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|robinswr: it would have been down 4|pg||
nt|pef: yes sacrificing the trump trick would come back multifold|pg||
nt|jstokes: only 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|passell: the losers in trump and diamonds go together|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pef: see everyone in just a few minutes for the exciting final session|pg||
pc|hT|nt|othered1: That's what the movie says|pg||
nt|kareno: Whew!!|pg||
nt|pef: well there was the 30-footer at the buzzer|pg||
nt|pef: shawn is an incredibly fine player, she must have been totally dead-tired to do that|pg||
nt|jstokes: amazing:  West won the diamond ace (after trumps were gone), cashed the ace of spades and play a diamond back, diamonds never having been bid|pg||
mc|13|nt|kareno: Right you are, Peter.  So it's Mancuso who will have to pick up the pieces of a lost match and go and play hard now in another tough one.|pg||
nt|pef: well thanks again to all the specs hope it was exciting enough for you.|pg||
nt|othered1: Not a 30 footer, more like a dropped fly ball with two outs in the 9th in a tie game and a man on 3rd.|pg||
nt|kareno: Spec waiting for an undo of the diamond return :)|pg||
nt|reisig: @d return ..is the WORST play ...I've seen|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty folks...ty Rob:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: and me buddies here:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: thanks all! back in 20 minutes!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: night all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Open Room bidding  15 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D big pickup vs 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Glasson again of to very fast start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: she actually played a card to trick 2 -- maybe thought 4 missing trump would break FIVE-oh|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops probably shouldn't have said that to the entire room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sprung asked for keycards from SOUTH and did go onto 7@H|pg||
pg||
