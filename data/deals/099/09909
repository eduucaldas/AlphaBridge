mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|kit: starting out with a possible slam -- goes down on likely diamond lead|pg||
nt|kit: rather unlucky -- hearts 5-2 and spade hook off|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Because of Lynn Deas' wheelchair, the players are sitting at the table at different positions than are marked on the table. I will hopefully manage to figure out who's who to enter ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: the bids and plays, but I'll apologize in advance if I have more undo's than normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2NT is forcing after a jump response.|pg||

nt|henryb: well bid by E-W|pg||
nt|kit: If South goes up ace of diamonds, declarer can make via spade-diamond squeeze -- but she will never play for that|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c2|pc|d3|nt|lml: this is a nice board to get settled|pg||
nt|brolucius: A gentle board to launch the set.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|lml: I always hope for those.  I have a way of messing up the first board if it is too challenging|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I will have to go deal with a problem at another table, so no play for a moment. Back as fast as possible|pg||
nt|brolucius: If declarer was desperate for extra entries to dummy in the club suit (not here), she could have led the @C7 to the @C10, retaining her @C5 to cross to the @C6 on the fourth round.|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||

nt|iain sime: 15/17|pg||
nt|paulg: would you open Lucas 2@h with Cuthbertson's hand, or is it too playable in spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Til de knap så rutinerede: Når man åbner på Nords hånd, skal man regne med at komme for højt ganske ofte|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  it was better than the previous Lucas 2@H that McGinley came up with earlier|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|iain sime: I guess that is why he didn't.|pg||
nt|capercliff: too good for a lucas 2 no?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ebrok: Der strammes helt igennem!|pg||
nt|pkl: God dobling, ja.|pg||
nt|werge: Med @C-udspillet ligner det tre stik til Vest - og en skævt fordelt trumffarve|pg||

mb|p|pc|d2|nt|Rafa: Estas son las ultimas 16 manos de la final de equipos libres|pg||

pc|s4|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|capercliff: must admit though id be more inclined to open McGinley 2@h than this one|pg||

nt|kit: clearly South made normal diamond discard -- declarer tested hearts, and when they were bad took losing spade finesse|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|santyclz: It's hard to understand but for some reason the players seem to have other things on their mind rather than ensuring the vg operator can see all their plays.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: An operator is a spectator|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It's really not a concern of theirs, Joe|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lml: Cheri Bjerkan is playing with Sue Weinstein|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks!|pg||
nt|lml: both pairs are playing 2/1 as are a good part of the field|pg||
nt|lml: a few precision/strong club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Jan is bionic, in three places at a time. Well done :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D expressed the type of spade raise that West holds.|pg||
nt|kit: whatever that is|pg||
nt|brolucius: Trionic.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: right|pg||
nt|lml: 3D is a constructive 4 card raise I am pretty sure|pg||
nt|kit: always more exciting to play in 3@S than 2@S|pg||
nt|lml: they wouldnt have played 2S I don't think|pg||
nt|lml: Karen would have been in there|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play 1@S - 3@S as pre-emptive, you have to use other bids, such as 3@C and 3@D to show genuine raises.|pg||
nt|kit: Of course N-S can make quite a lot of clubs or diamonds, but would North have come in over 2@S?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lml: they do play 3S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: as preemptive|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Playing Precision, Palmer can jump to 3@H to show this hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb: and after that lead can take 13 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: I like 3D because you keep them out|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c5|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Palmer: "Do you play odd/even?" Pollack "yes"|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: I expect both North and South would think they had enough to compete over 1@S - 2@S.|pg||
nt|lml: I play it too I am afraid|pg||
nt|kit: why would 3@D keep them out more than 3@S?  Just gives them a free double without danger|pg||
nt|lml: I meant 3D as opposed to 2S|pg||
nt|kit: okay|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry - I had to be out of the room and only was given play to first 3 tricks. Will have to enter result and hopefully all will then be normal from now on|pg||
nt|lml: I like 3S to be really preemptive|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S is more pre-emptive, as you say, and therefore used on a weaker hand.|pg||

nt|boltonian2:  some action here maybe|pg||

nt|capercliff: many*, 2 is normal I gues|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  just the two I think|pg||
nt|iain sime: Double?|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  might double to think of the alternative|pg||
nt|capercliff: the 4@h's makes t awkward|pg||
nt|paulg: just a simple overcall, don't want to lose the opportunity to get hearts into the game or show power later|pg||
nt|paulg: N-S's efforts have prevented a good slam being bid here|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|capercliff: I would not open this 2@c|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: hvad med en dobling?|pg||
nt|werge: Fra hvem?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: jeg ved godt den ikke er køn, men... (fra Peter)|pg||
nt|werge: Har du arvet?|pg||
nt|pkl: Den eneste, der kunne doble var Nord. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: nej|pg||
nt|ebrok: med 2hj.? Så hellere 1 sp|pg||
nt|werge: Nords dobling ville være ret risikabel|pg||
nt|werge: Makker melder altid den farve, vi ikke har|pg||
nt|ebrok: Enig igen|pg||
nt|Rafa: El equipo chileno empató el 1er. lugar con Brasil en el Festival Sudamericano en Lima el año pasado|pg||
pc|h3|nt|boltonian2:  this is by no means certain|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  done well to reach this game, but it is going to be a difficult make|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Rafa: Chile no ha ganado un torneo sudamericano oficial desde aprox. 1950|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

nt|pkl: Jeg ville kunne forstå en dobling fra Dorthe, men pas er den sympatisk melding|pg||
nt|ebrok: nu kan han vinde, og bør vinde !!|pg||
nt|iain sime: Well stopped; the trump break sinks 5H.|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, it's not an obvious game to bid and (it may be) unlucky to find the 4-1 trump break|pg||

nt|brolucius: A good bidding test now.|pg||
nt|kit: nice 6@C here, but may not be so easy to bid|pg||
nt|lml: it always seems harder to bid clubs|pg||
nt|lml: most club bids dont mean clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That suit disappeared in the 50's|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|brolucius: West will accept any try in clubs, with all those controls.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kit: but might be worried about club support|pg||
nt|brolucius: If East has no controls, she must have a good club suit to make a try.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: West is looking at 8 controls, so if partner can bid clubs, she should accept any slam try|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ah, a natural 4@C. That's a good start.|pg||
nt|kit: this Deas will raise to 3 happily|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: is it?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: apparently|pg||
nt|kit: if natural -- although if gerber that will work also|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I cannot believe players at this level are using Gerber.|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is ace asking... I cant imagine they dont transfer with clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: and the bad @d break will defeat it|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: want a bet|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: There was no alert to 4@c|pg||
nt|lml: odd but ok|pg||
nt|santyclz: Normal spot though, likely to be duplicated.|pg||
nt|kit: declarer can get 3 club tricks with double finesse, but that's still only 8|pg||
nt|henryb: I would expect so|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: East did well.|pg||
nt|kit: good aggressive lead -- and finds partner's queen, but not good enough|pg||
nt|lml: sometimes the way to bid a slam is just to bid it|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, doesn't even find partner's queen -- but won't matter of course|pg||
nt|lml: I confess I would have gone slower|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Shot but sweet; I like it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Leading through the strong hand, in hearts, might have put declarer to an early guess - even if she did hold ace and queen of the suit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Short even|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: However, if East fails to split on the clubs and declarer takes the double finesse, then I believe West comes under pressure with spade ace still in dummy|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s4|pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|kit: If East does split, declarer will have to waste the spade ace to repeat the finesse|pg||
nt|kit: So she should split, but I can easily see a defender slipping|pg||
nt|henryb: Only if declarer plays clubs before the second @d I think|pg||
nt|kit: if declarer plays a club now and East doesn't split, I think it makes|pg||
nt|henryb: otherwise West can putsh a heart winner safely|pg||
nt|henryb: pitch|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Palmer asked Pollack to show her the spade and now is studying the hand|pg||
nt|kit: if heart is pitched, declarer can set up a spade|pg||
nt|kit: and queen of diamonds still in dummy|pg||
nt|santyclz: If declarer plays @cs before the 2nd @d she'll make 4 @cs apply pressure to w and spend the evening explaining her line to a committee.|pg||
nt|kit: how can declarer ever take 4 club tricks?|pg||
nt|henryb: can't Kit.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: She's still studying - nothing has happened|pg||
nt|kit: if 9 of clubs holds, club to queen and ace, king of clubs, and West is squeezed in 3 suits|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Deas  appears to be studying her bidding notes :)|pg||
nt|kit: if East splits, declarer can't play the third club without squandering ace of spades, and West will be okay|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I would have bet on this table to be the slow one with Palmer & Pollack, both of whom are not exactly speedy - don't know how slow we'll be though|pg||
nt|henryb: meanwhile Baker-McCallum stayed out of the good club slam on 17 and were rewarded with 10 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: After that hand, Deas commented "good slam"|pg||
nt|henryb: Weinstein on this board just conceded down 1 when diamonds did not break|pg||
nt|henryb: Shawn Quinn ran the @c8 at this point and made the hand on the squeeze afainst West|pg||
nt|kit: she is really taking her time -- this has to be overdoing it|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Palmer is still thinking, but she has now turned the 8 of diamonds over and picked up her cards again, so maybe she's getting ready to do something|pg||
nt|henryb: 14 minutes|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: Pollack has had plenty of time to work out to split|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kit: but she didn't use her time wisely it seems|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|kit: But Palmer blew it -- played for wrong squeeze|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Dinkin is the NPC of the Baker team|pg||

nt|henryb: probably although I tink there are chances if the @dA is not cashed now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: 2@d was probably some kind of artificial waiting bid, looking for further description|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: McCallum: "my clubs are really good"|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: which one do you like best heart slam or spade slam... you don't need the heart finesse in spades but you may not need the spade break in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This event will decide which two teams will be representing USA in the Venice Cup (women's World Championships) in Brazil in late August/early September|pg||
nt|kit: this overcall may get a preemptive raise from Weinstein, which will make the slam more difficult to bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lynn Baker was punished for bidding twice with the West hand|pg||
nt|kit: hard to fault her for that|pg||
nt|chip: I don't blame her for doing so.|pg||
mb|1N|an|f1|nt|kit: Imagine if Palmer has 3@D weak available here|pg||
nt|henryb: might not choose it with those hearts|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Assuming they are not playing transfers after intervention, 1@H is better than a double now.|pg||

nt|kit: Double by North probably wouldn't have been for penalties|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|lml: they found the fit|pg||

nt|brolucius: North must judge if she is worth 4@D.|pg||
nt|kit: Palmer may now try 3@D|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lml: I like that bid and not because I am looking at both hands|pg||
nt|kit: good bid by McCallum -- shows better than a mere 4@S call|pg||
nt|brolucius: Three key cards in the hand, so worth an effort below game.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: she should pass now. 2@D showed her hand. Partner must have a stack of clubs|pg||
nt|chip: yes, partner might not always have 4 trump tricks for this. Still, South didn't promise defense.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: this bid gives partner a chance to look at her hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: but maybe not quite that stack|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: but partner is doubling opposite what might be zero defensive tricks, so partner figures to really have it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: I am not giving up on the south hand now|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H is last train -- now, Baker has to decide if she is worth more|pg||
nt|lml: she can keycard or bid 5C I suppose|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not so clear that South will bid again.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spades are poor.|pg||
nt|kit: I think she should -- in fact, she can pretty well picture her partner having exactly what she has|pg||
nt|lml: I agree she should but will she?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: I think South should just take over and bid RKC -- finds out what she needs to know|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|kit: the hand with the source of tricks has to take control|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: what is 5@D?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And a point to make on the lead. Deas does not want ruffs, so she leads from length. That's what is recommended if you have many *good* trumps|pg||
nt|kit: the trump end-play battle will soon begin|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many inexperienced players would lead the singleton diamond|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|lml: 0 or 3|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1430 responses.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: yes, 0 or 3|pg||
nt|kit: then why did South sign off?|pg||
nt|kit: unless she was afraid of 0, but that is impossible considering the 4@D call|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I can't ask her|pg||
nt|lml: some people play that when you have 3 you should bid on but surely not in this auction|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: I disagree -- when you have trump length you do want ruffs to avoid end-plays.  The K@S lead only correct since KQJ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|d2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|brolucius: South's sign-off is hard to understand when all key-cards are present. She can hardly have meant it as a safety measure in case North held 0 key-cards because then North sould not ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: have cue-bid 4@D.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lml: she can hope that the suits dont break|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so even Kit would lead @SK from that holding; that's my point|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: perhaps North was expected to bid on if she had 3.  Not a treatment I like|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|kit: of course -- but with no jack of spades, I would have led a diamond|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c7|nt|kit: if you can't tell whether 0 or 3, you shouldn't have been bidding RKC in first place|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure that is what she meant but it makes not sense to give North that chance in this auction|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|kit: Now declarer knows the whole story when Deas returned a spade rather than a red card|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Well, she can't have 0 for two slam tries, so Baker should have bid the slam herself|pg||
pc|h7|nt|brolucius: South could also have passed. On the other hand, North can hardly think that South was intending to bid the slam only if North had FOUR or more key cards, so I think she should ...|pg||

mb|2N!|an|!ds|mb|p|nt|lml: now good pairs get good results|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not a fan of walking the dog with the West cards here|pg||
nt|kit: The cute pass by West -- understandable with the balanced hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How often will the opponents get to NT?|pg||
nt|chip: not so rare to defend NT.|pg||
nt|kit: with partner a passed hand, likely either 2@S won't make or opponents can make something at 3-level anyway|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|lml: after a mistake|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kit: McCallum had no real reason to bid more -- she was quite minimal for her previous bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: South must have upgraded to a 15-17 2NT.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So you wouyld rather get in with 3@S now?|pg||
nt|kit: expecting diamond shortness in her partner's hand|pg||
nt|chip: I think 1N was 14-16, (and normal even if off-shape in their strong club system), 2N=D, and 3D = don't like?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lml: there notrump range is 14+-17|pg||
nt|kit: surprising here that McCallum doesn't have a better approach than the bludgeoning 4NT invite with 5-4 in minors|pg||
nt|lml: I dont see this as a 14+ myself|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 4NT was a bit of a stretch and I expect she is pleased that partner passed.|pg||
nt|kit: I wouldn't exactly call the 4-3-3-3 South hand "+"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Well, she did get a plus score out of nowhere, so hard to argue with her actions|pg||
nt|chip: just another flat board.|pg||
nt|henryb: Given 5@d I think 3@d was I"I Like"|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: I agree Henry|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb: still N-S will gain 2 imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: West will shift to a heart, and even Palmer won't take too long to play this one|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|lml: on the lie of the cards they are going to make a fair number of tricks|pg||
nt|kit: jack of spade suit-pref|pg||
nt|henryb: -50 in this room, +110 in the other|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: or so I thought|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: I think it is 14-|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is a temptation to 'try something' on the board after you have had a likely adverse swing. |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: lucky for defense that hearts aren't KQ with East and AJ with South|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Deas had put her diamonds down with the 3 & 2 reversed, so when Palmer gestured at diamonds on this trick, she actually played the 3, then pointed out that we had "a multi-colored ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: wish trick"|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||

pc|h2|nt|Vugraphu1: Declarer said"I'm in my hand|pg||
nt|lml: I always like to "get the cards"|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would have been remarkable to bid this slam and not the previous one. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are losing two other rooms on a regular basis I am afraid, so please be patient as far as comparisons are concerned|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: and led a heart to the K - everyone agreed she was in her hand - don't know why. Anyway, will now claim|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: E alerted 2@d - no questions have been asked|pg||
nt|kit: now East has a problem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One would have thought that they had discussed what 2@D shows over a Precision 1@D|pg||
nt|kit: is 2@H forcing?|pg||
nt|kit: What does one do with no suit to Q-bid?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why an alert if it's natural?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Doubt e thinks it's Michaels...|pg||
nt|chip: natural is an alert here.|pg||
nt|kit: I'm pretty sure they know what 2@D is -- that's not the problem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't alert bids|pg||
nt|Walddk2: natural bids|pg||
nt|kit: with screens, you alert anything that moves|pg||
nt|chip: in acbl you do if normally not natural (e.g. 1H-DBL= penalty is an alert)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: you are not allowed to alert any doubles any more, at least on this side of the pond|pg||
nt|henryb: I believe, Roland, that "natural" cue bids are alertable in ACBL-land|pg||
nt|kit: how can you be forbidden to alert doubles when there are screens?|pg||
nt|chip: in acbl few are alerts, but very unusual ones are.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: anyone bid on the east hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: No!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 1@S by South, then probably 1NT by North ending it|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Obviously she didn't think it was Michaels|pg||
nt|chip: guess pollack had no sensible way to bid her hand safely.|pg||
nt|kit: She will not be happy if a club is led, but the will be saved|pg||
nt|chip: actually 3N maybe about as good as 4H.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Deas asks Cohen: "what's 2@d?" Cohen: "I think it's natural; we didn't discuss it" Then Palmer asks Pollack and she also says it's natural|pg||
nt|kit: So, how does one make a Q-bid on this auction when there is nothing to Q-bid?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess in ACBL-land Michaels is not alertable, so 2@D natural is. Upside-down thinking in my book|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: 2@C would be a borderline effort at matchpoints. Quite awful, as I see it, vulnerable at IMPs.|pg||
nt|chip: well, nice to have what 95% play be no alert, and have the unusual bid be an alert. that was the original intent after all|pg||
nt|santyclz: My mother would have led a @c.|pg||
nt|kit: My preference is that after a natural overcall of their nebulous suit, a bid of the other minor is the Q-bid|pg||
nt|chip: yes, useful method to play (and what i play also)|pg||
nt|henryb: any two-suited cue is not alertable; in fact in general cue bids are not alertable, but when a bid has a normal "conventional" meaning, an unexpectable natural one is alertable|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|kit: If South take a push here, they will get to 3NT which I don't think will make|pg||
nt|lml: I would bid NV |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lml: some people like to lead a club honor from a long suit like that|pg||
nt|kit: I would have bid 2@C on East hand, even vulnerable.  Seldom gets doubled even if you are in trouble|pg||
nt|kit: however, vs. precision diamond, it is maybe 50-50 whether people play natural or michaels|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|brolucius: Yes, but low is better because you may want partner to have a club left when she gains the lead.|pg||
nt|lml: so one NO! one no and one yes|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d9|nt|henryb: 2@c response to partner's 1N opener natural would be an alert|pg||
nt|kit: Anyway, on an auction like this what difference.  The bid itself is self-alertable as there is no "standard" agreement, and North knows enough to ask if she cares.|pg||
nt|henryb: and penalty doubles of natural opening bids below 4@h would be alerts|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lml: low is better depending on who has the doubleton|pg||
pc|c8|nt|brolucius: We now know who the sound bidders are...|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|kit: and when partner puts the stiff ace on your king, you aren't so happy|pg||
nt|lml: its right to lead low more often than its wrong|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: alert procedure is a grey area all over the world, and every federation can do as they see fit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: You are not going to win the auction, with clubs as your suit, so you risk a borderline overcall only when you are desperate to have that suit led. Here East held fair spades too ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: and would be happy with that lead.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer will have no choice but to follow the rabbi's rule|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|lml: should duck|pg||
nt|lml: or ask for better diamond spots|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The slam was bid in the other room on 5. 13 IMPs to Glasson|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: that slam hand is the kind you don't want to discuss in the partnership until at least one day has passed|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|santyclz: TWIAVBP The World Is A Very Big Place.  I learned commentating the Bulgarian match the other day that a penalty x of a precision 1@c opening is "standard".|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: I don't understand what's wrong with 1@S. And if you can't bid 1@S in your methods, at least you should be able to support hearts|pg||
nt|kit: maybe a simple raise to 2@H is best on East hand -- clearly not worth 1NT, then 3@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's wrong if the opener may raise to 2@S on three cards, which is popular in England (at least). You would then bypass your 5-3 heart fit.|pg||
nt|kit: problem with 1@S is that partner often raises on 3 -- and then what?|pg||

nt|lml: but a heart does look ugly|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: if partner passes 1NT, that is likely a far better contract than 3@H |pg||

nt|lml: IH-1S-2S-3H?|pg||
nt|lml: but you have a double fit then|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@H - 1@S - 2@D... and then 2@H does not even show three-card support. 3@H is an overstatement.|pg||
nt|lml: 10 points|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|mb|p|nt|lml: okay if you don't think you have a limit raise then I can see the point behind 2H|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|lml: partner better be twitchy on the game tries then|pg||
nt|kit: if you call that 10 points, I think you need a new point-counting system|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|kit: 4-3-3-3 no aces -- ugh|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: I spent 30 years overbidding hands with only three-card support. It must have cost me several 100s of IMPs.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: I agree it is a truly ugly 10 and not really a limit raise|pg||
nt|kit: They will get to 4@S now after the raise -- depends on the diamond pickup|pg||
nt|lml: but gets better if partner raises spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I think McC wrote that 3@c shows 3 spades, but not positive - might have been 3 clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: Main use of 2NT is to check whether partner has four-card support when she has raised spades.|pg||
nt|kit: I guess E-W can get a club ruff to defeat 4@S on club lead|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Club lead is quite likely, too.|pg||
nt|chip: heart lead gives the defense a chance here, but club Q is pretty normal.|pg||
nt|kit: Not such an easy hand -- but the lead is helpful -- now declarer can set up 2 club tricks -- but she doesn't know that for sure|pg||
nt|kit: I think she will fire a club back, though|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|lml: yes everything else looks pretty bad|pg||
nt|brolucius: Baker might have bid 4@S instead of taking an extra round.|pg||
nt|kit: Not sure what Baker was probing for in the auction -- perhaps she was going to pass 3NT if McCallum had bid that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't count on the scoreline, specs. Several boards from the closed room are not entered. The poor operator is having a hard time with frequent disconnects|pg||
nt|kit: or perhaps her 3@S was a well-judged signoff, but McCallum chose to bid on|pg||
nt|lml: north has a good bad hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Director has been called because the auction might have been only invitational and Baker took a long time to bid 3@s, so McCallum's 4@s bid might have been influenced by the ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: hesitation.|pg||
nt|lml: 4S is a decent contract it just might go down|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Now dummy has been put down and McC has explained that the reason she showed a minimum with an acceptance was in case partner was going to make a slam try. Facts are all agreed and ...|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|kit: declarer won't get diamonds wrong -- with West being short in clubs, declarer will play king of diamonds first for sure|pg||
nt|brolucius: I hate the situation where a side can see whether the game makes and then complain. That seems too generous to them - not that there is an easy solution.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit: not so sure about her actual play -- she saved the entry, but risked giving opponents time to set up spade trick if diamond king off.|pg||
nt|chip: no longer has the entries for the S,D squeeze, so will make 3 (but happy to do that)|pg||
nt|kit: but her play may well have been best, since she couldn't afford to take a losing diamond finesse with no more entries to her hand|pg||
nt|henryb: I have to leave you for dinner. See you in about 3 hours|pg||

mb|2D!|an|transfer|mb|p|nt|brolucius: On this auction a double does not promise both majors. You may have only one. After 1@C (1@D) a double does show both majors.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kit: The redouble probably just shows some strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But double with 4-3 can easily get you to the wrong strain, like here|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|kit: which should go down -- but something funny might happen along the way|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I think Weinstein should have bid 2@S, not 2@H -- so she could then bid 3@H later if need be|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some play that redouble shows A-x or K-x in partner's suit and says that you like the suit led. When you have a true fit, you raise or cue-bid.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Baker is making gestures that suggest to me that 3@c wasn't invitational, but it's not completely clear|pg||
nt|chip: 3N is down 2 if they get their tricks.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kit: I wonder what 2@S is -- seems like Deas has routine transfer then 3NT call|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: Weinstein got herself in a box -- she wanted to compete over 3@C with her stiff club, but was afraid to try 3@S -- that is why she should have bid 2@S rather than 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: yes, odd to give the opponents a nice chance to double or not.|pg||
nt|kit: Now defense has to get it right -- and that might not be so easy|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|brolucius: She was hardly strong enough to take so many bids on that hand. If she were stronger, then 2@S and 3@H would have been justified. |pg||
nt|kit: if East dumps queen it will be easy, but I don't think she will|pg||

mb|3H|nt|brolucius: She will be worried about a club lead through the king.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kit: But E-W figure to get to normal 4@S contract in any event|pg||

nt|Walddk2: is that also alertable?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: It looked to me as if she said it was invitational, but I wasn't sure enough to write that in |pg||
nt|kit: 4@S goes down on club lead, but I don't think we will be seeing that'|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: 3NT is interesting -- On club lead declarer has 8 top tricks, and South is under plenty of pressure|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|kit: McCallum to the rescue :)|pg||
nt|lml: this is an even stranger turn of events|pg||
nt|brolucius: A 1@S overcall. NV, does not show much.|pg||
nt|lml: I am not a bidder on the north hand|pg||
nt|lml: anyone who would?|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, McCallum would be on her own in a bidding panel.|pg||
nt|santyclz: @d lead?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: when I do that they bid game|pg||
nt|kit: I really don't like the 4@D call -- it isn't going to make, and if it pushes opponents into game McCallum can't be happy|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some pairs play that a Pass, over 2@D, shows a weaker hand than 2@S. Which way round they play it would affect East's subsequent bidding of course.|pg||
nt|lml: she survived it but it gets low marks|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 2@S was the weaker option, than 3@S would show a pretty strong hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Baker asked about the auction and that was the only bid not discussed - Weinstein told her that 2@c showed spades and 3@S showed a better hand|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|lml: the only good thing about this is that game is NV. |pg||

nt|capercliff: Drury is a necessary evil, nothing worse than missing a game or getting too high if you dont play it|pg||
nt|paulg: is this hand too good for 14-16 1NT?|pg||
nt|paulg: probably not with weak majors|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  not for me|pg||
nt|jackth: 6 imps en camino para Chile|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Ligner det ikke en game Ø/V|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bridge_one: without the incident of 4@H (12 IMP) Gueglio would make a good session|pg||
nt|ybob: EW puede ganar 3@H sin salida triunfo|pg||
mb|p|nt|ebrok: Alle til Schaltz!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|pkl: Ja - endnu et godt spil til Schaltz, men jeg tror det er for sent. |pg||
nt|mollerjep: godt til schou|pg||
nt|pkl: 6@C vinder uden ruder ud, men med resultatet i lukket rum er det ligegyldigt|pg||
nt|bridge_one: .|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  though, it is a disciplined pass from Steel, can come in with a double now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|nt|ybob: raro remate :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mollerjep: 10 stik og 8 til schou|pg||
nt|pkl: Hov - det er selvfølgelig et elendigt spil for Schaltz|pg||
nt|paulg: the 2@s raise is pretty wide ranging over an overcall and, unfortunately, it is a courtesy raise this time|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  protecting the K@H|pg||
nt|minimonkey: How you getting on John? Exams have been cutting down on my bridge so in theory in a week ill havea lot more emails for you :)|pg||
nt|paulg: hi Frazer!|pg||
nt|minimonkey: Woops|pg||
nt|minimonkey: Sorry All|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  its ok, we'll pretend we were joined by a John earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: hello everyone |pg||
nt|bridge_one: correct|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bridge_one: the jump at 3@D with normal hand but good suit is usewd today by many players|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bridge_one: East have for sure 2 of 3 cards hight - so small from dummy is the best|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg: Steel is quite conservative when non-vul .. playing opposite McGeorge it is a sensible policy|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ybob: la posición del @C puede dejar esto en -1, no ahora que juega el J|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bridge_one: @D would kill immediatly the contract|pg||
nt|capercliff: I think this is the first duplicated auction we have seen this set, other than 1Nppp|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  the auction looks pretty standard|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|iain sime: Seems to have reached a fairly ugly game though. |pg||
nt|paulg: i guess West could have made a 3@H game try to gain a couple of imps|pg||
nt|ybob: era para chico al 8|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jackth: buenos pasos de los chilenos para un topscore de 150 :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|henryb: I am not sure I understand the auction: what suit has been bid and raised?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzpq: i think north is finding out what hand has south to play 6 or 7 nt|pg||
nt|capercliff: some would play a X is a game try in this sequence|pg||
nt|capercliff: partner could then pass for penalties or bid on|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ybob: hola, damas 6º libres 5º|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|capercliff: 3@h being reserved for something else|pg||
nt|jackth: :(|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzpq: they play after 3 H 3 spades as support in spades and cuebid support in D|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s3|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|henryb: so 2@s showed|pg||

pc|cT|nt|jackth: mal interpretado el 10@d|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|bridge_one: slam depending by 2 finesse. so 3Nt is right|pg||

nt|Walddk2: In chess there is an easy solution: the clock. Not so as far as bridge is concerned|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 2nd imp Glasson has scored this round.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: "I can't remove it yet. The commentators are still trying to explain the bidding to the kibitzers!"|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Here is a heart slam you can't bid because you are off two keycards|pg||
nt|chip: maybe after the double you could bid it.|pg||
nt|chip: using cue-bidding rather than RKC.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You could still be off the two black aces|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Pollack put the RDBL card on the tray, then took it back instantly, shaking her head. Perhaps they play transfers starting with RDBL|pg||
nt|kit: possible, if you could dodge the RKC problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 2@c could be anything|pg||
nt|kit: 2@C probably a relay to 2@D -- to play, or show some other kind of hand|pg||
nt|lml: it looks that way on her hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, or a transfer.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: West was slow to alert 2@c, but now has. I can't see either note|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could be two 'real' aces|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|kit: Baker wants to get to 2@S, but do they know whether transfers apply here or not?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The closed room is down again I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: N alerted 2@s; unless I missed it, S didn't|pg||
nt|lml: the confusion begins|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: so it looks like they are on shaky ground, to put it mildly|pg||
nt|kit: I don't understand the pass at all, whatever their methods over the double are|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: It is OK when you have spades, in that case. 2@H is the bid that may or may not be a transfer.|pg||
nt|kit: guess McCallum worked it out|pg||
nt|lml: it didnt seem likely that 2@S was a transfer to clubs or whatever|pg||
nt|lml: back to confusion|pg||
nt|brolucius: The only real solution, a tricky one, is to know your system.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other semi-final Moss leading 24-1 against Mancuso through 10 boards|pg||
nt|lml: that is a surprise Mancuso rocked in the round robin|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT will worry South.|pg||
nt|lml: South knows the wheels have come off now|pg||
nt|kit: if Lynn is practical, she will pass before the wheels really come off|pg||
nt|lml: what is 2NT according to North can you see|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not a great 19, but a pretty good one.|pg||
nt|kit: unless she was afraid her partner was psyching at favorable and wanted to see what was going on|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@S is a bit risky in case it means something different opposite whatever North thinks 2@S showed. Safer to pass.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I'm sorry, I can't see the note, & I can't ask during the auction because that would alert the players to the fact that there was an alert|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course! |pg||
nt|brolucius: We are all grateful that you are the VG operator and not any of us. A very difficult job, that I would retire from after about two boards.|pg||
nt|kit: clearly North thought system was on (whatever 2@S would have been in their system), and South didn't think system on|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: They must be opening very light since Pollack didn't even make slam try|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lml: a lot of people play system on over 2@C in most cases|pg||
nt|kit: this shows the importance of having good general rules which will cover sequences not specifically discussed|pg||
nt|lml: my notes say system on over 2@C not matter what|pg||
nt|lml: it might not be best but it is clearest|pg||
nt|kit: something like:  If they bid 2@C, double is Stayman and system on -- regardless of what 2@C means|pg||
nt|kit: she probably decided to believe the vul takeout doubler|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|kit: doesn't matter what is best -- agreement is what is important|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|chip: actually I think she could have done well by making a penalty double of 2D. good chance to hold declarer to 4 tricks.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|santyclz: Say goodnight Gracie.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but she has no idea how good their trump fit is|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Spot on|pg||
nt|lml: I am certain that the time you are most likely to forget your system is when you are playing in something important|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am capable of forgetting anything anywhere|pg||
nt|lml: I bring a little card to the table.  I call it a cheat sheet with the things I am going to forget on it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not least vacuum cleaning|pg||
nt|lml: I read it just before game time|pg||
nt|brolucius: A kibitzer suggests that 2NT should show a maximum hand with good spade support. I prefer to bid 3@S on such a hand and to reserve 2NT to show a misunderstanding. |pg||
nt|kit: favorable heart layout, but unfortunately enemy clubs set up|pg||
nt|lml: it could be but the spade support wasnt that good|pg||
nt|chip: Its as good a stab as 3N I think.|pg||

nt|pkl: Men jeg forstår man ikke bryder sig om åbningen ... hvor er potentialet???|pg||
nt|ebrok: 2 meldinger på hver side af skærmen|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@S is 1 down with corwct counterplay|pg||
mb|3H|nt|werge: Lystig dans nu|pg||
nt|ebrok: Fra asken i ilden|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT on forNS - also 5@C and chances for 6|pg||
nt|iain sime: 3D is a mini splinter- not game forcing|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  4@S does not look completely unreasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: no way for a swing here|pg||
nt|jackth: creo que ambos serán interpretados igual|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jackth: como va la mesa me parece que debería salir a buscar la Q de triunfo|pg||
nt|jackth: el problema es que no sabe del J tampoco|pg||
nt|ybob:  lo verá en el muerto en un ratito ... :)|pg||
nt|jackth: jajajajaja|pg||
nt|jackth: tarde me parece, pero tienen una rueda que requiere de 7 tipo Chagas!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mollerjep: uha, det bliver mindst 1100....|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  though S will suspect a bad @S break|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes and might have chances if trumps were 3-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|ebrok: blir det 3 ruD?|pg||
nt|pkl: Hvorfor D Peter ikke 2NT??|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now 11 tricks |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: the 2NT rebid is a real disabler when it comes to investigating minor suit slams ... just as well when it would go down|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ybob: no me parece correcto|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jackth: y si... ahora a buscar la Q|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mollerjep: 3hj til 1100|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now @H from dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|jackth: la no salida de triunfo ayuda a que no acierte la posición, me parece que jugará a Q9 |pg||
pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: 97 in @S in the dummy are very usefull to ruff @H |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and probably 12|pg||
pc|hT|nt|werge: Flot meldt!|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|ebrok: Det ender vel ikke med 1100?|pg||
nt|werge: Det er ubegribeligt, at en spiller, som FØRER, vil mishandle Vests kort sådan|pg||
nt|mollerjep: jo, lige præcis...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now @C again|pg||
nt|capercliff: can this make from here?|pg||
nt|iain sime: still has chances. |pg||
nt|capercliff: if he plays on @c I think he can|pg||
nt|iain sime: needs to ruff a heart|pg||
nt|capercliff: but he also needs to ruff a @c as well|pg||
nt|paulg: needs to ruff a heart and then play to ruff the third club|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|pkl: Jeg ser 800 uden problemer|pg||
nt|werge: Ruderstart havde givet 1-2 stik mere|pg||
nt|ybob: tranquilas 10 bazas acá|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|mollerjep: Nu ved jeg ikke, men hvad er der galt med 3 x ru...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|iain sime: Now clubs.|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  the @H lead might have helped, if he feels E has 3@H, then he must have 4@S|pg||
nt|jackth: intentó pero sólo alarga la diferencia|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ebrok: Plejer man ikke at give lidt rabat i den slags spil ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: uhmm after 2@H openening A in @D difficult in East|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|werge: Peter ved, at Dorte har double ruder - videre!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right K @D|pg||
mc|12|nt|henryb: It seems more likely that declarer will play @dAK than run the J, so one down|pg||
nt|iain sime: It is easy seeing all four hands. If West had switched to a diamond, that would have sunk it.|pg||
pg||
qx|o29|st||md|3SKJ93HJ9543DQ4CK4,SHQ6DKT532CAQJ652,SQT8652HT87DA9CT7,SA74HAK2DJ876C983|sv|b|nt|brolucius: Mind you, the situations in this set have not been particularly obscure.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Baker apologized, but no further discussion of what had gone wrong|pg||
mb|2D!|an|weak 2 bid in a Major|mb|p|nt|brolucius: If Naker apologised, transfers must have been 'on' and she should have said 2@H instead.|pg||
nt|kit: the multi here wont' make life easy for N-S|pg||
nt|kit: Palmer will bid at least 3@H pass or correct, maybe more|pg||
nt|lml: this one|pg||
nt|lml: I think Pollack is going to be sorry she didnt bid over 2D|pg||
mb|4C!|an|transfer to suit|nt|brolucius: ..Baker..|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Walddk2: Our table is the only table up (out of 4) at the moment. Poor connections. Sorry about that|pg||
nt|kit: This should be easy 4@S hand, unless declarer misguesses the spades|pg||
nt|lml: I like apologizing in a way.  It helps to clear the air.  But my personal preference is to say nothing at the table|pg||
nt|brolucius: We have already seen this start, where 3@D showed about 8 points and four-card support.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: by this, means Palmer wants Deas to bid one under her suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: of course now maybe Pollack will be rammed into slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: 5C seems wrong. DBl to show clubs, then 4N much better.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Get in against the Multi right away is what is recommended. Many play double as 12-14 balanced or any 17+ (will bid again). So double it would be with this hand|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: yes 2@D-4@C says show suit via transfer - and 2@D-4@D says bid your suit naturally|pg||
nt|kit: anyway they survived and got normal result|pg||
nt|chip: their defense is DBL is 13-15, but might upgrade with AK A.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: Yes, I like my partner to apologize.|pg||
nt|kit: If South happens to lead ace and a diamond, something interesting might happen|pg||
nt|lml: I would lead my stiff|pg||
nt|brolucius: A club lead would be obvious if it wasn't an honour.|pg||
nt|lml: it may not work but I hate it when I miss a ruff|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: this would be my choice also|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: now there is a chance|pg||
nt|brolucius: Nothing else is remotely attractive from that hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I don't know how long it really took to lead the club - I had to get the other match restarted - sorry - hopefully we'll be better next quarter |pg||
nt|kit: I'm sure declarer didn't really duck|pg||
nt|lml: I hope not|pg||
nt|lml: very strange and bad play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jan is multi-tasking, very tough for her|pg||
nt|lml: she has been great|pg||
nt|brolucius: She has done well.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Have they really played only about 8 boards in two hours at the other table?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I have the results for boards 8, 9 & 10 from the other room, where for some reason the computer has decided it no longer wants to get on the internet - 3 - 3S E +170, 9 3D n +130 ...|pg||

mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: They are coming, slowly but surely|pg||
nt|chip: seems marginal to DBL 2S with such a defensive hand.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|santyclz: Scrambling or leb?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: efective as kept opponents out of 3NT -- of course that might not make|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: They both alerted but I couldn't get either explanation and they're trying to go fast, with only 10  minutes for 3 boards|pg||
nt|kit: I think that 3@S call is just plain absurd|pg||

nt|capercliff: indeed, 2@s non-forcing |pg||

nt|boltonian2:  yes, 4@S looks to have 4 possible losers|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  4@H that was|pg||

nt|vugraphzpq: gabino alujas thinking|pg||
pc|s4|nt|boltonian2:  yes well spotted|pg||

pc|s3|nt|henryb: suit preference for @s|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bridge_one: but also @c win the same bec no way to make k IN @C in the dummy|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Looks like the 480 got credited to the wrong side for the 12 IMP swing on board 11. Thanks to several specs for letting me know|pg||
nt|brolucius: A board described in the Sunday bulletin for this event featured a player who (oh dear) overcalled 2@C on a five-card suit and went for 800. I wonder if West read it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the very first board|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: NV|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 11 corrected now|pg||
nt|lml: NV I don't think you need 6|pg||
nt|kit: Might be better to pass on North's hand -- if South passes it out, how bad can that be?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well at least the spade is the ten|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next set is scheduled to start in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|kit: won't be enough if defense is decent|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: This was a 10 IMP swing in the other match|pg||
nt|kit: normal 3NT -- not clear if it will make or not|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|brolucius: You might pass. But if you do and partner re-opens with a double, it is not entirely clear what you should do then.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Made at one table, down at the other|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Vugraphu1: Cohen asks about lead - 3/5. Also Smith echo vs NT|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|lml: 765 of spades are remarkably high|pg||
nt|kit: West could have done better, but this still looks like down 1|pg||
nt|kit: difficult to find heart shift|pg||
nt|brolucius: East ruffs high, attempting an uppercut, but of course her trumps were sequential.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: With something like 8-6-2 she would have ruffed with the 8.|pg||
nt|lml: dont knock the 765 they are good cards|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|d6|pg||

mb|3N|nt|werge: Doping-test - intet mindre|pg||
nt|ebrok: N-S spiller nær-fjern, hvor 3 kl viser hj-farve og gamekrav|pg||
nt|bridge_one: giving a limit hand with raise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@d can be dangerous|pg||
nt|capercliff: and not sure it can make on a @d ead|pg||
nt|iain sime: Would be pushed to make slam on a diamond lead.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|bridge_one: i don't know if 2@C is gazzilli, but i suppose is natural|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: no gazzilli (2@H isn't contemplate in gazzilli with 2 cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so may be they play without a GF open, similar to Fantoni Nunes|pg||
pc|d5|nt|capercliff: X just in case they play in a @c slam|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ybob: 3St = 3@H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bridge_one: if it is a special gazzilli, then 3@S after 2@H need with Kx in @C and 10 hcp with QJx n @S|pg||
nt|ybob: E promete bal 24+ |pg||
pc|d2|nt|robinswr: 2diamonds could be Bart, and this sequence shows 9-10 points ( I play exactly two spades)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|iain sime: first round control.|pg||
nt|paulg: 4@h may be ambiguous here -- last train or cue bid or both|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  why are you more pushed on a @D lead? it is all on the @S play isn't it|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d9|nt|werge: 5 @D spør´ vel efter trumf dame|pg||
nt|ebrok: sikkert|pg||
nt|paulg: but Walker has prime cards in clubs|pg||

nt|capercliff: a @d lead kills an entry right away|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|iain sime: 4NT was maybe not the right question. |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  not sure you need the entry|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  5 might actually be more difficult than 6 though|pg||
nt|paulg: hard for Walker to see 5-6 opposite|pg||
nt|mowen: is it reasonable to cash @SAK and play the same hand for 3@Ss and 3@Cs|pg||
nt|capercliff: Walker might take some time with this one|pg||
nt|paulg: Walker takes time on most hands ... I think Cuthbertson is the only fast player at the table|pg||
nt|capercliff: safety play must be to finesse @s twice anyway no?|pg||
nt|mowen: not so good if the finesse loses|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|henryb: If you have the West hand, or something similar, do not, I beg of you, bid 2@h. double! partner may have a penalty pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Stewe :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|capercliff: if it loses then you lose a @d and a @s?|pg||
nt|mowen: ok so he plans to hook the spade|pg||
nt|iain sime: Club switch now.|pg||
nt|mowen: low heart now?|pg||
nt|paulg: i guess ducking the diamond in case spades are 4-1 offside|pg||
nt|capercliff: a low @h would be sneaky, trying to force dummy somewhat|pg||
nt|mowen: will probably work though|pg||
pc|s9|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|ebrok: Forventet ligespil|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but also playing gazzilli after 2@C 3@s iommediatly is perfect to give the structure and the force of hand by East|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|robinswr: 2hearts shows two or three hearts which allows you to play the 5-2 heart fit|pg||

mb|2S|nt|brolucius: South should pass now.|pg||

nt|kit: seems like Palmer should have some better way to start describing her hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: wow|pg||
nt|lml: she ducked the CQ?|pg||

nt|santyclz: Thanks also to BBO for providing us this platform without which none of the would be possible.|pg||

nt|santyclz: And finally, thanks to you, the spectators who drive the whole process.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kit: 3@D call somewhat aggressive, but passing could miss a game if partner is strong|pg||

nt|Walddk2: hehe|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|Vugraphu1: :)|pg||
nt|kit: On this layout, the 3@D call definitely got them too high -- not even clear that 2@D would make|pg||
nt|lml: not a friendly hand for north-south|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D was luck to find a fit. I think South should pass on such a weak hand with 5-4-2-2 shape.|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Thanks to all spectators for watching. Sorry about the technical difficulties. We hope it'll get better eventually|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: more likely than not will catch a fit|pg||
nt|brolucius: As Reese used to point out, you have to do two tricks better to make it worth your while playing one level higher. And if partner raises, you may have to play two levels higher.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do join us again a little later|pg||
pc|d8|nt|santyclz: The next segment is scheduled for about 2 hours, after the dinner break.|pg||
mc|8|nt|lml: can there be a game?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Game time is in 20 minutes, but we may be facing a delay|pg||
nt|lml: the only positive thing is souths spade texture|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We most likely will|pg||
nt|chip: was she planning to pass then 2C to show two places to play?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thx all, bye for now|pg||
nt|santyclz: For vg times set to your timezone:  http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
nt|chip: how did W claim? seems she was going down 1?|pg||
nt|kit: at least 1 it would seem|pg||

nt|bridge_one: yes, this is possible Steve - but 2@s after isn't the best idea|pg||
nt|robinswr: i agree about the final 2spade bid|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, this board could decide whether or not Maiolani carry on the match for the last 16|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  if NS get to 7@H then McGeorge will find the fairly simple squeeze|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: last hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpq: yes, this is the last hand of the first segment, they are playing 16 more boards tonight|pg||
nt|paulg: easy double for Cuthbertson|pg||
nt|capercliff: for those of you who may not know, the Maiolani team is from Glasgow and the Steel team of course from Edinburgh|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fcarioca: I'm guessing EW will bid 6@D here...|pg||
mb|d|nt|bridge_one: depending on the bid by south|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to make 6@S need @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@H would be more effective|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ebrok: 3 tiere+ 9 hp=3 nt i nord|pg||
nt|robinswr: i'm guessing that 4hearts will make it difficult to bid slam (3hearts is insufficient)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not vulnerable|pg||
nt|jackth: un torneo que tuvo de todo! gracias a todos! |pg||
nt|Rafa: especialmente pisco sours!|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|vugraphzpq: tomorrow we are going to broadcast the finals|pg||
nt|paulg: Double from Walker will just show 4 hearts .. although I expect he'd prefer more points|pg||
nt|paulg: i don't think they'll bid it|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  it is a good contract|pg||
nt|jackth: jajajaja|pg||
nt|ybob: mandén uno acá|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: The Steel team are favourites with a lot of international experience; only Ian Howie has played for Scotland in the Maiolani team.|pg||
nt|granguru: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|ebrok: Bagefter med 39 IMP|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the difference betrween 3@H and 4@H overcall is very hight !|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  33 break or K@D in W with the 4 @C|pg||
nt|Rafa: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ebrok: 41|pg||
nt|fcarioca: In fact any non @D lead allow 6@s to be made, due to singleton !K...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 3@D asking about distribution (to know a sgl)|pg||
nt|granguru: oops sorry private|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|paulg: or 4-2 with the @cJ dropping|pg||
pc|h8|nt|werge: - og flere, hvis de melder 3 NT her...!|pg||
nt|ebrok: Udspil?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: nw opps know fit and distribution|pg||
nt|Rafa: Seguimos a las 14:10 de Chile, son las 12:36 actualmente|pg||
nt|Rafa: Final a 64 manos, 4 ruedas de 16 manos|pg||
nt|Rafa: la 3era rueda comienza en una hora y media|pg||
nt|Rafa: Esta mesa ya finalizó|pg||

nt|Rafa: volvemos en 1,5 horas|pg||

nt|werge: Den smule jeg kender til bridge, da er det ikke hænder som disse, man skal spille "all in" på!|pg||
nt|ebrok: Det må bliveru, ja|pg||
nt|pkl: Jeg forstår en opvurdering hos Nord, men Syd burde nedvurdere|pg||
nt|pkl: Enig med ruder ud|pg||
nt|fcarioca: singleton @CK allows it to make, no communication NS|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes. i haven't seen K sgl in @c in South|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ebrok: Ja, "floppet" var ikke en rammer|pg||
nt|paulg: Maiolani are a dangerous team though who played in the quarter-finals of the Gold Cup last December|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  even better then|pg||
nt|ybob: todo esto, para mostrar invitacional en ST de E|pg||
nt|ybob: np|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|bridge_one: the Dbl at 4@H is a old way to procede - normally Dbl means no interest in @H|pg||
nt|robinswr: This is Lerner's fault|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally is a advantage to know anythings about the hand of p, but there are the possibility to give informations very usefull at opps for the counterplay|pg||
nt|iain sime: This looks like one off .|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Congrats to the winning team, Fred, Mané, Vita, Gabriele, Leão, Aranha|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jackth: unos pocos imps más... estamos atrasados con los soures! |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ebrok: 9 stik|pg||
nt|paulg: This is the last hand of the third set and I'd like to thank our excellent operator, Stephen Peterkin, ...|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  so 10 imps back, will it persuade Maiolani to carry on for the last 16?|pg||
nt|ybob: Cuidado a los campeones que el 2011 vuelve P. G. :)|pg||
nt|jackth: PG?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|robinswr: will he lead a low heart|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@C giving the chance to choise the best minor|pg||
nt|paulg: David Gerrard, Fiona Greenwood and the SBU for organising this boardcast, ...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pkl: Men 3NT er stadig hjemme hvis man gætter klørfarven|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: BYE ALL ! ty for kibitz BBO :)|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  you never know, might be able to ruff another @D for the 8th|pg||
nt|jackth: @h bloqueado y quedaron del buen lado además|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|iain sime: Could have gone down quickly- club ace, two spades and two ruffs, with a trump to come.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg: i'd play on if the lead is less than 80|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bridge_one: yes, K in @H is more precise|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ebrok: du kan ike gætte galt|pg||
