nt|mtvesuvius: If partner cared about your aces, he would have asked|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry all, she could not misguess of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it's very good to play the K anyway... W hardly can have 3 aces|pg||
nt|daman: too complicated    just get a client and use their name like we do on this side of the pond|pg||
nt|yuval10: Both south players, here and on the other table, are girls|pg||
nt|hedyg: junior client?|pg||
nt|daman: sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are in a hurry?|pg||
nt|yuval10: they need to take care of Filip|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|minimonkey: Thats a pretty looking 10 count east has, i suspect it will be opened|pg||
nt|ady: e/w    will lose 3 imps  here|pg||
nt|lestergold: do we have lift off scottie|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: I do not see why east bid 5d over 4h|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 4h looks iffy, but makeable|pg||
nt|lestergold: beam me up|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hedyg: how about playing bridge for fun, honour and fame?|pg||
nt|hedyg: as it should be|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: or even slightly better than that|pg||
nt|hedyg: even!|pg||
nt|petergill: Vulnerable games at IMPS should be about 35% chance to be worth bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: in front of partner|pg||
nt|daman: might be a dounle partscore swing on this|pg||
nt|daman: double*|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|yuval10: North did well with his distributional hand , so now he gets another one|pg||
nt|mariner1: there we go|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Walddk2: Another normal game. Has a better chance if played by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i thought 40%|pg||
nt|lestergold: Adam you are right o course you are but players often go wrong with these hands|pg||
nt|hedyg: he likes to bid a lot|pg||
nt|daman: EW are on for 3@D|pg||
nt|thegarve:  surprising to give up to 5@S at the other table|pg||
nt|wygbe1: entries are a problem though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Arvidsson has a maximum for his 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: OK|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah i cee Hedy|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: my partners always bid 2@d..|pg||
nt|yuval10: mine too|pg||
nt|yuval10: correction - 3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: good competitivie hand to start with|pg||
nt|ahollan1: frisky unfavorable 2N with only 54|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS have a lot of experience already in playing national and international competitions|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Passing 2@C would not cross my mind|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i dont think this is going to be a success|pg||
nt|yuval10: normal auction|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT on fir n/s  as long as e/w can take 5 heart tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: i will try 35%..|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1@h promises 3@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think South has a X here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h high enuf on these cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: vulnerable south cant safely back into this|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c has play but north may have tried 3h which says bid 3n if u have a heart guard to pard|pg||
nt|wygbe1: that lead blew the whole heart suit as well|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: hmm not a good double but hard to pass even if not a junior|pg||
nt|hedyg: i trust you Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: @D7 or @Dq back as suit pref to show @HK?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hed like to double |pg||
nt|lestergold: roland is in slam here|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is the one to bid a lot if you will play AK@H|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sorry specs; we don't have E-W's CC, so we can't tell what 1@S is|pg||
nt|lestergold: its the rubberneck slam|pg||
nt|wygbe1: low club works well here|pg||
nt|thegarve:  should make 10 tricks picking up the @h suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: swap North and East hands and -- ouch?|pg||
nt|mariner1: frisky 5@C too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry North and WEST|pg||
nt|lestergold: a doubtful 2n at unfavourable north had to bid 5c|pg||
nt|mariner1: K@D swapped and its a maker|pg||
nt|xenya: all would be well with the @DK on.. as it is, this is down 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: on a reasonable chance of the dim finesse thru opener but sadly not today |pg||
nt|mariner1: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_vugraphs&event=USWBC2009  - for|pg||
nt|mariner1: leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: has play? it's infrangible as you used to say|pg||
nt|lestergold: if they play that|pg||
nt|yuval10: same lead, probably same result|pg||
nt|yuval10: defense can cause troubles to declarer if N will return @c now|pg||
nt|athene: nine tricks here whether or not west leads from @HAxxx, i would guess|pg||
nt|ady: thats a good proposition for n/s  with QXX  opposite 10XX|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: restrained 3@s bid|pg||
nt|petergill: even at the expense of wasting the Beer Card|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yuval10: too easy for Roland|pg||
nt|minimonkey: Both N and S unwilling to stick their necks out at this vulnerability, the fact that EW dont have to have a spade fit here adds to the danger|pg||
nt|ady: got the worst lead   but still ok|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: nor 1@c..|pg||
nt|thegarve:  lest see if he makes 12 |pg||
nt|yuval10: and she does|pg||
nt|athene: east can put her partner with the @HA and hence nothing else |pg||
nt|ady: just the formality for playing a top diamond from the south hand to guard against 5 to the  ten|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/q7l6em  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all 4 tables of semi-final are being shown on vugraph|pg||
nt|mariner1: might not actually have running scores,,,,,,,|pg||
mc|10|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a sort of a "raptor 1NT" on the other table|pg||
nt|xenya: um == down 2 on a @D ruff|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you can't stand just watching one -- http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/    one window per table|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|an|slam try w clubs|mb|p|nt|caitlin: now I think we are in slam territory in bidding as we should be|pg||
nt|roswolf: well we SHOULD be but these auctions often go astray|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes losing heart on @SK|pg||
nt|chick: there is some danger of ending in 6N, and with a @H lead that will be disasterous|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|roswolf: without precise agreements about the meaning of 4nt after cue bids i think east will have a difficult call over 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: SORT OF LAST TRAIN I SUPPOSE|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|roswolf: assuming west passes|pg||
nt|daman: this is a great slam|pg||
nt|caitlin: The Mancuson team is made up of Renee Mancuso, Peggy Sutherlin, Shawn Quinn, Pamela Wittes, Connie Goldberg and JoAnn Sprung|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry Mancuso|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@Dwas rkc and 4@S was Queen ask i am told by a spec|pg||
nt|caitlin: see http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&task=list&event=12|pg||
nt|roswolf: but obviously west is unsure - |pg||
nt|daman: has to pass|pg||
nt|caitlin: Moss team is Sylvia Moss, Mirgry Zur Campanile Sue Picus, Linda Portman Linda Lewis G. Margie Gwozdinsk|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well maybe there has been a keycard misunderstanding|pg||
nt|roswolf: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a huff + puff well done as per Harry Potter|pg||

nt|roswolf: this is a good slam imo|pg||
nt|hedyg: beauty is in the eye of..|pg||
nt|lestergold: nice misfit here|pg||
nt|yuval10: been kibitzing/playing against her so many times, i always admired Emma's card playing :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: its usually on bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly Hedy|pg||
nt|daman: stopped in partscore in the CR   +230|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure looks like NS could find a game here|pg||
nt|lestergold: if lebensohl then yes perhaps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Malmö is Sweden's 3rd largest city after Stockholm and Gothenburg|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only a bridge away from Copenhagen where I live|pg||
nt|thegarve:  reached the final of the European Cup a few decades ago|pg||
nt|yuval10: this looks like another chance for "the fanclub" to gain imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, Malmö FF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C strong|pg||
mb|1C|nt|daman: is 1@C a fert?|pg||
nt|hedyg: pls undo Johnny|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And the venue for the European Bridge Team Championships in 2004|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: very good even|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s need to play this in 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D is a nice spot|pg||
nt|yuval10: Roland will bid ( and made ) 6@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: other human beings may settle for the safe game|pg||
nt|cicus: the biggest mistake was S pass over 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 17+|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yuval10: "Filip's fanclub" are currently in 2nd place, and going strong here, too|pg||
nt|daman: or, as they say in Denmark, a phert|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S  8+   5+ hearts|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D shows spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 1D=4+@S and another suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@H strong|pg||
nt|yuval10: if you don't have lebensohl available you should pass with W|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@d has a better chance to make with W on lead than 6@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: another  Roland slam?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: 3@H should set @H as trump now|pg||
nt|roswolf: strong jump shift !? a novelty these days|pg||
nt|hedyg: and still beforcing|pg||
nt|petergill: Personally I like Strong Jump Shifts much more than the in-vogue weak jump shifts responses|pg||
nt|hedyg: @c lead kills 5@cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: she would have bid 1@s with 4 4 Ms as well|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't really understand why bid 1NT here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: North should trap pass|pg||
nt|yuval10: from N|pg||
nt|athene: NS need to find the diamond fit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: hm they care all getting their toes wet here|pg||
nt|hedyg: as usual the @d suit is lost|pg||
nt|athene: but looks as though it's gone by the wayside|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: but i would have continued with 3@H, requesting cue bids, not 4@H|pg||
nt|daman: not any more|pg||
nt|daman: quatre carreaux|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It was raining for 2 full weeks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 2@H= @s or both minors|pg||
nt|lestergold: but mosty liely will settle for 3n with overtricks|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: but same finish|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 2NT=lebensolh|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d gf stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: the play double stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the punt rather spoiled things - 3! would have allowed south to show his handH|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tough for Lindström without a spade control|pg||
nt|hedyg: how about 3@s by N denying control in minors?|pg||
nt|petergill: South likes her controls, but is minimum|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not like the 1n bid by north|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s= 8+, 5+@hs|pg||
nt|yuval10: very impressive performance by the "fanclub" team so far, in both rooms|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n the money bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: they can stretch it forward by bidding 3NT here|pg||
nt|lestergold: the pragamtic bid what else folks?|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|mariner1: now its found|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s a normal contract facing an unlucky distribution|pg||
nt|hedyg: so E on lead all contracts now|pg||
nt|hedyg: except NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: once again we see how bad is it to ask RKCB when you have 2 ( or more ) quick losers in a suit|pg||
nt|minimonkey: So I think that means that 2D is GF, so South can go past 2NT to show her 5+ diamonds|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's just that RKCB can't help you in those situations|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Frazer, gf stayman|pg||
nt|yuval10: N in the other table would've done a lot better by bidding 4@s, if he wants to try slam|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=2255  for the tournament website with results and other tidbits|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North does not lack courage|pg||
nt|daman: as a rule, most juniors do not lack courage|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT should show 19+|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Say, 19-21|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The 1@S response here is surely better than the 1@H in the other room|pg||
nt|yuval10: N realizes her @s problem|pg||
nt|minimonkey: No way they get to slam here with S having at most a 12 count, it has now been wrongsided for the club lead if S had the king instead of the queen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They know their system these youngsters. They put a lot of effort into it|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: now 13 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: definitely 10000% better|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: North needs to pass hoping partner will reopen with a double|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would pass and bid 2h on the next round to play|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: now he can kill his vulnerable opponents|pg||
nt|yuval10: but bid 3NT nontheless|pg||
nt|lestergold: allowed to rely on the strong hand holding something there|pg||
nt|mariner1: lost again?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5d not really very much better than 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: but today 6d makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: a poor contract less than 50%|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D tough to play with no A@H lead|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is only slightly better than 6@D -- on a @H lead?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4th @c is not good|pg||
nt|mariner1: have to play 2 @D and the ruff a @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: then|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but 3n makeswhen dim finesse is wrong and hearts break so quite a good contrat id say a lot better thabn d but not much better than 5d maybe even worse|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6N makes only on a @H lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: better than 6d i meant to type|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: this will do|pg||
nt|daman: I once was lost and now I am found|pg||
nt|thegarve:  a double would have made the play easier|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed clear double in my view|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@d X could've been interesting |pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 1 off though|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lestergold: confucious he say play 3n with nine top trik and all suits stopped|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is the 10th tricks now|pg||
nt|yuval10: 11 more for the admirers of Filip|pg||
nt|thegarve:  South should double this knowing the a@S is an entry|pg||
nt|athene: once E-W find a big heart fit, north knows his partner's second suit is a minor|pg||
nt|athene: and he is lucky enough to have both - although the 5-level is very high if you might have only a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Enter North, stage left|pg||
nt|ady: seems n/s should save in 5@D here agains the e/w 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 2@s= minimum, 3@c=no singelton and 5card @H |pg||
nt|lestergold: it makes on a ht guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i wonder who is Filip|pg||
nt|yuval10: i know|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: or as u say pass the reopening double if it comes|pg||
nt|lestergold: either way i want to play this hand in hearts eitehr by us or preferably the opps|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: the new-born sun of Sara Sivelind and Karl Asplund, which are of course a very close friends for both NS here and EW on the other table|pg||
nt|yuval10: Son, sry|pg||
nt|hedyg: and i am told he is 1 month old and very cute|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 4@d no cuebid by N, wd|pg||
nt|yuval10: an awkward auction, but they stayed out of slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm in camp that says 1@S rebid shows unbal hand, can live with 1@S guaranteeing 4@C and maybe bal, but really don't like 1@S with 4333|pg||
nt|lestergold: well academic theyve stopped in a sensible 5d which cannot go off as cards lie|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: if no @H lead, does anyone expect to see a @D finesse?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mtvesuvius: well, I don't particularly want to play in 2@h knowing I'm getting a 5-1/6-0 split|pg||
nt|lestergold: do you not agree that 1n was a dreadful bid?|pg||
nt|jaheim: .|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: Yes Hedy, that is a possible way to bid it, if that's your agreement. Probably not their agreement here, or else she could have bid it|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: what I would like to do is penalize 2@c or 2@s or wherever they run|pg||
nt|yuval10: he's surely does :)  as cute as a baby can be|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like @s and 2@h's and 5 imps for the 2008 champs|pg||
nt|mariner1: George can you "see" the @D now? :)|pg||
nt|daman: sure can   scroll up|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10 imps|pg||
nt|yuval10: if 3@h was suit, and 3@s was cuebid agreeing @h's, hard to understand why North didn't bid 4@h over 4@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: ut perhaps they played it some other way|pg||
nt|minimonkey: I suppose S having A??? xxx  Kxxxx A??? is possible but as was just said if partner has that hand 1 slam try ought to be enough|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Where was that coffin you were nailing Roland?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: why did she do that?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|hedyg: she probably thought 2@H had shown her hand already|pg||
nt|lestergold: does south know that the double shows a void??|pg||
nt|athene: east will play @DA and another, presumably, but declarer can eventually set up the fifth spade|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|yuval10: North went for an extra overtrick here|pg||
nt|yuval10: not bad, when she knows she can't lose more than 3 @h's|pg||
nt|lestergold: was safe to do so|pg||
nt|mariner1: Amazing grace! How sweet the sound|pg||
nt|mariner1: That saved a wretch like me!|pg||
nt|mariner1: I once was lost, but now am found;|pg||
nt|mariner1: Was blind, but now I see|pg||
pc|s6|nt|daman: going to be hard to beat this|pg||
nt|hedyg: she is trying to avoid the @c finesse|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: so you play in 2 hearts and opps have a trump trick ur only at 2 level|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Westlin|pg||
nt|wygbe1: dont know what west is thinking about - h exit is automatic|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: she had a sort of squeeze on W|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think he expected it|pg||
nt|lestergold: if not it would be extremely dangerous to double for penalties|pg||
nt|thegarve:  north should have bid over 2NT knowing south was short in @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: then she could have bid 4@c|pg||
nt|minimonkey: Good point|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2NT over 2NT ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: well... what can he bid?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: though once the K@s was in W chances are the rest is in E|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wygbe1: yikes|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: I think 2@H is fine; then 3@H over 2NT setting the suit and asking for lowest cue bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhhhhhhh nooooooooooo!|pg||
nt|yuval10: oops|pg||
nt|daman: an old bagpipe favo(u)rite|pg||
nt|ady: seems  should be -300     time to set up 5th spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: technically that was surely not the best line|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|hedyg: i wonder about the 2NT bid with no @s stopper..|pg||
nt|ady: 8 imps for n/s|pg||
nt|athene: declarer is just wondering whether to ruff this or pitch the @H2, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't matter as the cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: he knows west doesn't have a singleton diamond but he might be thinking about @Dxxx with west and stiff @DA with east|pg||
nt|athene: then it would be a bit harder to get the long spade going|pg||
pc|d5|nt|thegarve:  there are snails who sit there forever, Roland has a top 10|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: This way, you can cross ruff|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: if east doesn't have a trump to return|pg||
nt|athene: and if east DOES have a trump to return you know they are 2-2|pg||
nt|athene: so you can set up the spade|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|hedyg: actually not just sort of|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So the heart discard was probably very good play|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|mtvesuvius: true, but I think that if partner bids 2@d, there is no reason for me not to let him play there|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I must play with at least 5 of the top 10 or it feels like that|pg||
nt|lestergold: unneccasirly going off when dim and hearts all swrong|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: you must let him in this sequence i agree|pg||
nt|hedyg: what has he done?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hedyg: if 2@H is strong ok to bid 3@d IMO|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|yuval10: Carl Ragnarsson informs me now that Filip, and his mother of course, is in the VUgraph room, having his meal |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: claim?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|petergill: AKQ to eight is 8 out of 13 tricks, equivalent (well, sort of equivalent) to about 24/40 or 25/40 high card points, so North might simply have 4NT'd her way to 6@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: she..|pg||
nt|daman: compressed a making game into one which fails|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems to be lost now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: yes, although perhaps with stiff @DA east should return a heart to let her partner lead another trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: these pairs use 3rd from even, low from odd  or 3rd/5th -- so @S2 means 3 or 5|pg||
pc|s9|nt|yuval10: even if the @h's are 3-3, he needs the @d finesse in order to make this|pg||
mc|13|nt|hedyg: that should not show extras just strength|pg||
nt|lestergold: do we need to know that?|pg||
nt|yuval10: as she can only manage 4@h's, 4@c's and 1@s at most|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's a she, of course|pg||

nt|pocken: Good aftrenoon|pg||
nt|petergill: Summary - that was a tricky hand to bid.|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Per-Ola, welcome|pg||
nt|petergill: Hello Per-Ola|pg||
nt|lestergold: the point is that 1n was anawful bid by north|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: we already agreed that...|pg||
nt|lestergold: did we|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I thought so :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: need to go now, thanks all and see you later!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: Saturday afternnon?|pg||
nt|lestergold: bye shalom, Yuval|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Yuval|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She had a blind spot, happens to all of us|pg||
nt|po-s: what can he make?|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he bids 3@c i guess NS will find themself in 5@c very quickly|pg||
nt|wygbe1: then declarer gave it back by not playing the good club when the only trump out was the ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed I have Martin|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't want to see it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  please name and shame|pg||
nt|minimonkey: Not having cued 4C N sould see 2 quick losers in the suit and knew to stay out of slam|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think it was at all clear to save with north's hand|pg||
nt|athene: with @SA and a heart trick|pg||
nt|athene: but it sure worked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't even earn all the matchpoints|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS could get too high here|pg||
nt|lestergold: and going off whne dim iswrong and hearts are misguessed tool- much better to play to discard a ht onthe spade before committing to a play in diamonds|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry hedy saturday afternoon kitchen nightmare site|pg||
nt|hedyg: she must feel terrible :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: trick compression is an "Art" with some of us :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: and once again West keeps on bidding north's suits|pg||
nt|daman: so it is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fine slam bid by the young ladies in the other room|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has one of those hands that looks better than it is.......|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u 2c by east oukld easily be passed out none of thepthers have a comfortable bid|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: I guess E-W can match it here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 2@C overcall -- All PASS makes sense -- esp if NS playing Support DBL|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mariner1: the frequent disconnects causing a lot of issues|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: South has a lot of catching up to do, to show her hand|pg||
nt|pocken: With a standard treatment of a 2H jump shift, 1C!  - 1H! - 1NT - 3Sp! would do the trick|pg||
nt|yuval10: and N keeps bidding NT...|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry its a bridge nightmare site not a kitchen nightmare site |pg||
nt|lestergold: whats going on here|pg||
nt|lestergold: fun iondeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only Top 5 for now. 1-2: PO Sundelin, Barnet Shenkin - 3-4: Andrew Robson, Glenn Grøtheim - 5: Bauke Muller|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: west's turn to be carted off to the bridge prison|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H= 10-13|pg||
nt|lestergold: for a vulnerable overcall in suchsa dangeropus position i think two consecuitive life sentences|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s should reach 3n here which has good chances|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   on for n/s       bad result  in CR   3S_2  for -200|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@C is a bit conservative|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the 1 opening didnt do justice to it|pg||
nt|lestergold: ew for e/wis enormous|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think this 1NT is as bad as the previous one|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s for e/w enormous|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: tough to find 4@s now|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is gonna hurt|pg||
nt|yuval10: "The babes" are surely gaining ground as the match prograss|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes Al whio can bid anythinmg now?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mtvesuvius: this 1NT is just as bad as the last one...|pg||
nt|hedyg: his pd will kill him first, the rest of the team later|pg||
nt|athene: quite an aggressive overcall with no aces - but you have decent playing strength i suppose|pg||
nt|mariner1: well did not have to worry about getting too high it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: this cant bethe auction|pg||
nt|xenya: this can't be real, Rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: playing the 3 - 2 fit might be interesting|pg||
nt|lestergold: we are too high in clubs i tyhink for n/s|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes something looks off|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c a likely overcall byeast|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if playing Cole -- 2@C would be artificial FORCE|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 card suit a few outside cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c would be a forcing bid in any system, im familiar with|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c by south|pg||
nt|xenya: even if 2@C came from E, what about the rest of the auction?|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: 4@H?|pg||
nt|yuval10: if 3@s is GF+ with 6+ @s's, West's hand is excellent against it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H looks like 'flag' for spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: flag being?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: flag = I like spades very much and I have honour concentration in hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats what we both susp[ected|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: could be worse i guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: funnily enuf north will not actually retire on the penalty|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes found some good cards in E|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west still needs a tuff word from the coach perhaps behind the bike shed|pg||
nt|hedyg: low encouraging|pg||
nt|lestergold: swop the j and 4 of spades and the q and 5 of clubs for example|pg||
nt|hedyg: Johnny?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and u have more bloodshed than in the french reolution|pg||
nt|lestergold: revolution|pg||
nt|lestergold: or Ramsey's kitchen nightmares|pg||
nt|hedyg: are they taking a break?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: Sandra is thinking!|pg||
nt|lestergold: west is probably hiding|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhh ty|pg||
nt|yuval10: @s lead is best of course, but not much indication for West to lead it|pg||
nt|cicus: might easily lose 2 diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he plays the doubkle dim finesse which is probably better odds than ace and another|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|roswolf: north has to rescue this for her side|pg||
nt|roswolf: no double?|pg||
nt|yuval10: lol they just found it|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland wants to be in 6s which makes i think|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: lol|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: did I miss something? lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: our 3rd match will be a very interesting one|pg||
nt|mariner1: anyone play garbage stayman with W?|pg||
nt|yuval10: Iceland juniors VS "the babes"|pg||
nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: trick onj lead |pg||
nt|yuval10: so it's quite hard to understand 4@s is that context, Roland|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: ok, 3@S was 1@s3@h and both minors|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: 1@H by N would show 20+|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So 1@S = ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d was 0-7|pg||
nt|hedyg: it doesnt say :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 1sp 4+, could be canape|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/WomensTeams/Sweden/rimstedt-sjoberg.pdf|pg||
nt|daman: 1@S was canape?|pg||
nt|lestergold: adam do you tyhink the 1n card should be removed from svenson's biddin g box?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: no. I just think he needs to use it less often|pg||
nt|yuval10: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the entry position may force declarer to get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perhaps, but Asplund had no longer a cue bid available at the 4-level|pg||
nt|athene: E-W play transfer advances after overcalls? -  so 2@H = transfer to spades = good raise|pg||
nt|ady: 5 diamonds also should make for n/s|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: yes they do|pg||
nt|bjacobs: lowering the coffin into the ground ...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: ty Johnny|pg||
nt|bjacobs: makes sense ... 4 spades, < 20, South knew to close proceedings|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: could be|pg||
nt|mariner1: entries to dummy an issue|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: west is expecting thinmgsnlioke the qc to be wrong|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|hedyg: he must play for the Q@C to be on|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Per-Ola Cullin|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Per-Ola|pg||
nt|pocken: hi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finally a person who knows the system|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Please explain|pg||
nt|hedyg: we hope!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, this is the end of the championships|pg||
nt|athene: if west had raised direct to the 3-level that might have made things much harder for NS|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|thegarve:  played Grotheim recently and he held his reputation, but he did defend a few of the hands in tempo|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 2@C followed by 2H was 11-13 6+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thx Tommy|pg||
pc|c7|nt|daman: Hi Per-Ola|pg||
nt|hedyg: why play 9@s?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  might take a double @d finesse|pg||
nt|thegarve:  the first three do sit there and sit there and sit there|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: no 5@C - i think south badly mis-evaluated her hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: not obvious to play @d now|pg||
nt|minimonkey: I thought 3S seemed far too natural...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: This auction has been decoded|pg||
nt|pocken: @S = 16-19 4+|pg||
nt|daman: a spec says.....I think, 1S=4+ can be 5, over 1NT response 2C would be 5+S, 2D/2H canape with 5+ suits and 2S canape with 5+ clubs..|pg||
nt|pocken: 1NT asks|pg||
nt|pocken: 2@C = 5+@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 made next case|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he does|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhh bidding misunderstanding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A deserved win for Iceland Juniors, an average of over 22 VPs before this match|pg||
nt|athene: but even with 4-card support, her offence/defence ratio wasn't good|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: has to get back to hand for the fourth club|pg||
nt|athene: with all the high cards in the opps' suits, it looked more like a 3-card raise|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bjacobs: How old is the N/S pair?|pg||
nt|pocken: 24-26-ish|pg||
nt|daman: Roland's age|pg||
nt|lestergold: phew says west|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs suggesting singleton 8@S in S|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://tinyurl.com/q7l6em  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|thegarve:  going off|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade switch now|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually heart is good enuf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So maybe 4@H took up too much bidding space|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|roswolf: just cashing out|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
pc|d4|nt|thegarve:  watch out if Alan Mayo (recently back on the UK scene) gets onto vugraph - a medallst  for sure|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What did 1@D show?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 11-13bal or 11-16 with @D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So the @DK wasn't necessarily a bad value.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: And certainly the @HAQ had good chances of being over the king|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: the points weren't necessarily wasted, they were just defensive values as well as attacking|pg||
nt|athene: West in the other room did show a mixed 3-level raise right away|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So you'd have to say West's hand was pretty good.  It's true that she gave the opponents room to find 3NT, but it's just hindsight to suggest she should have bid it differently|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: Thanks ... so I guess relatively experienced|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my|pg||
pc|dT|nt|thegarve:  smith peter in @c says continue hearts|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hedyg: not even if added!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: When I started teaching my younger brother how to play bridge, he became obsessed with opening 1NT. He opened 1NT on any hand that had 11+ HCP in it... This seems to be a similar ...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: case :)|pg||
nt|xenya: wasn't N's pass a bit consevative?|pg||
nt|mariner1: no ruff there|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: well its only oveertricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite hard to blame E for playing the Ace to prevent probably @h ruffs|pg||
nt|hedyg: squeeze on S or so she thinks|pg||
nt|mariner1: what is the translation of the EW team name?|pg||
nt|hedyg: E showed 5-4 minors with singleton @s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In the other rom, South had bid 1NT ... now the hand is much weaker|pg||
nt|lestergold: northnwas fixed what can she bid?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yuval10: i meant our last match for the day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Three cool dudes and a babe|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: NS using standard signals -- it's a wonder they made it past the round robin :)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: mutliplied perhaps?|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: exactly, safety first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I see|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is off|pg||
nt|mariner1: 10@S to try to reach dummy again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Renee's pass looks right in long run -- partner has 0-2@H and couldn't find a more descriptive bid over 2@C|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mariner1: nice :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 'hunkar' is stolen from English 'hunk'|pg||
nt|hedyg: he forgot the system|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because you know any spade finesses are losing|pg||
nt|athene: well i don't know that it's just hindsight|pg||

pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: So forget flags for the time being :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: merciless|pg||
nt|lestergold: so 2 off for push|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I was born in 1887|pg||
nt|hedyg: so why did W pass 4@s?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or lower it if you wish|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: he knows his partner and guess he dindt know|pg||
nt|hedyg: how can he be sure partner forgot the system?|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||

nt|lestergold: well er em 1100 perhaps a little sad but the bid deserved to be punished in my opinion but apparently not in one or two specs opinions|pg||
nt|cicus: 2 declarers feeling bad|pg||
nt|hedyg: only..|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this quick match now|pg||
nt|athene: if you leave opps plenty of room when you have a nine-card fit, you need to have some specific reason for it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She did ... game try|pg||
nt|athene: yes but you can show strength and still go to the 3-level|pg||
nt|athene: as west did in the other room |pg||
nt|mariner1: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_vugraphs&event=USWBC2009  - for|pg||
nt|mariner1: leaderboard|pg||
mb|1H|nt|daman: Roland has seen a third generation of trees|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because this gives them exposure to many common tactical situations|pg||
nt|Walddk3: N-S are very experienced, E-W are not, so please bear with them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 17+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will Migry respond 1@S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or ... show bal 3 card limit raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: true but there are hands that qualify and therefore i try to cater for them|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: nice slam here, but it must be played in @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: well anothyer corker|pg||
nt|Walddk3: That was how we all learned the game, the hard way|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm could be trouble here|pg||
nt|lestergold: difficult choice|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bjacobs: Whereas playing obscure big club methods, you lose that experience|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s now?|pg||
nt|yuval10: a bit pessimistic approach by E IMO|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c for e/w with a 6s good save available|pg||
nt|hedyg: you all pass in W?|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards spitting here at e/w|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- neither|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores here|pg||
nt|lestergold: but part score ok in either major|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: OK I give in - West bid it badly|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: im still learning it Roland the hard way|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I do|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d = 9-11 ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks to our outstanding operator Tommy Andersson, great job! to my excellent fellow commentators Yuval Yener, Frazer Morgan and Roland Wald for donating their time and expertise ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: to guide us through these boards; as well as to the Swedish Bridge Federation(Carina Westlin) and the Filbyter Bridge Club (Carl Ragnarsson) for sharing this event with us.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this hand is close to slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: east must surely bid 4s over 3s!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, East was a bit pessimistic, but it does require partner to have the K@h|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: otherwise it's not a very good slam to be in|pg||
nt|lestergold: or heart finesse also|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL we all are|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I do,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 8 loser hand -- not an unreasonable approach by Migry|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hedyg: join the club|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: at least that what it was previously :)|pg||
nt|cicus: should be a raise, it was for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w havr  stayed fortuiously low...... so far|pg||
nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and the kind and helpful comments, we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back at 3:50 am Los Angeles, 6:50 am New York, 12.50 Paris, 11:50 am London, 8:50 pm Sydney|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@s , if shows shortness, will discourage South|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D lead best however @S was likely|pg||
nt|lestergold: north cant back into this so easy ride for Moss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i did check their CC -- 1@H-1N is Semi-F|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&task=list&event=12  -  Convention|pg||
nt|mariner1: Cards (click on Players names to see system cards)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yuval10: 4@s is better because it can also create a force and help the partnership in this particular situation when opps bid 5@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'll preserve my right to remain silent.... :P|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|daman: moi aussi|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice stop by East, might be tempting to bid some more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT  17-19|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H is interesting here - given that south bid 1@D a moment ago to show spades + minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think east was very right to downvalue her ten count no aces no ryuffing values not a good hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS only submitted System Summary Form -- EW SSF & ACBL Convention Card|pg||
nt|xenya: of course|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pocken: sorry answered E-W age, N is even younger, and played for a looong time, so sure she tried natural system|pg||
nt|bjacobs: sorry, |pg||
nt|lestergold: south may have been tempted to dip[ his oar in the water|pg||
nt|thegarve:  should compete with 2@h pass is sleepy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/q7l6em  for running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|roswolf: as a spec suggests 6@C looks good|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: well, that's one way to bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt cost to bid 4s then west with good clubs and an outside high card may get the message|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: double is a bridge gaol offence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/q7l6em  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 2@d=3-sup 9+|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 3@s= void|pg||
nt|yuval10: thanks Hedy, Roland, Frazer, thanks all|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d either natural gf or 9-11 with fit|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mtvesuvius: 4@s is definitely right though|pg||
nt|yuval10: 13 tricks comming EW's way now|pg||
nt|yuval10: 9+ in their case|pg||
nt|yuval10: if it stays the same now, then after lunch, we'll have 1st vs 2nd, with 15 VP's seperating between the teams|pg||
nt|yuval10: therefor, "the fanclub" would have to win 23:7 to win the title|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: more than close?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: you would expect X to be @H + minor|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT seems likely to make e/w  as in closed room     10@S  doubleton in north hand makes life easier |pg||
nt|athene: sorry 1@D was @S + another i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: D by arvidsson would have been @h + 1|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mtvesuvius: and now a double my Melin based on his "2@s tricks"|pg||
nt|hedyg: can they find the grand on a finesse?|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice lead by N|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: his hand is nmegative value in defence lucfky that his spade would stand if pard led it|pg||
nt|lestergold: if southc doubles for takeout north bids 3c then east bids 3s and that gets whacked|pg||
nt|lestergold: south shopuld probably put some pressure on especially not vul he can stand playing in 3 denominations|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: ok, just the slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: well no entries to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Iceland Juniors 13 VPs clear at this point|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes not in @H, in @c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This lead won't paralyse declarer, but nothing would have|pg||
nt|ady: passive 10@S lead|pg||
nt|xenya: and perhaps 2@H showed some values above minimum|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bjacobs: I am told North about 21-22|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: i cannot understand how n/s stayed in a part score in the closed room|pg||
nt|lestergold: and only managed to make 5 as spec points out|pg||
nt|yuval10: personally, i hate to TO double with void|pg||
nt|cicus: many hate but voids keep coming|pg||
nt|Walddk2: from Filips fanclub|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yuval10: unless E tries a @s now|pg||
nt|yuval10: in the last match, that is|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk3: Because they are young and inexperienced, and because they are on vugraph for the first time in their lives|pg||
nt|yuval10: which he doesn't|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|mtvesuvius: He needs to pass, which should be suggesting a save|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|yuval10: many times Partner will leave it with 4 cards and let them play in the 2 level with 9 cards is just horrible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In 1 hour and 15 minutes after the lunch break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not positive, but it seems Constructive Raises don't fit in well with Semi-F NT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: Thx everyone, enjoy your meal|pg||
nt|yuval10: they failed to bid game in the other room on board 25, but it was still worth 8 imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: I play 2@H as constructive 8-10 with no redeeming value to make it worth a limit|pg||
nt|mariner1: raise......... looks like EW do the same|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: Melin joins the convict parade|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do not like letting opps play in 2 level suit contracts if i can do anything about it|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|pocken: Petersen knew they had a 8+ minor suit fit, however, all depends on partner´s @S-holding|pg||
nt|ady: north will soon get end played|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: well you need to be objective and it does need a 3-2 break in trumps + other non-bad breaks|pg||
nt|lestergold: the meat wagon is filling up|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Doubling for the fun of it is not good...|pg||
nt|yuval10: a much-needed swing for "the babes"|pg||
nt|lestergold: but it only involves cashing ticks ruffing losers taking finesses Roland- |pg||
nt|Walddk3: Then you can have a debate as to whether they should have been on vugraph at all, but that's the decision of the organisers, not us. And we fully respect the decision they make|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mtvesuvius: yes, brings the match much closer.|pg||
nt|yuval10: the X only cost 3 imps|pg||
nt|yuval10: for itself, that is|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: True, but partner may have saved over 6@c|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: the double is telling partner not to same|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i originally suggested|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: save*|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, excluding the fact that they might have find the save|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Correct|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course they should be on vu-graph|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Full stop.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h4|nt|yuval10: best was to cash Q@h and play another one, but....|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: Malmölaget the defending champions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Team picture here ...|pg||
nt|ady: now north can go nowhere|pg||
nt|athene: you could duck this trick as a sort of protest :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: J@d first|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=2255|pg||
nt|ady: yes    avoid being end-played for the moment|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: is that was the case Per-Ola then i think the ant should have tried 4@C|pg||
nt|pocken: N-S is Sweden´s most experienced junior pair|pg||
nt|daman: doink|pg||
nt|yuval10: no matter, declarer has his contract now|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next match (in about 25 minutes): Viktor vs Tre hunkar o en babe (Three cool dudes and a babe). 'Hunkar' stolen from English 'hunk'|pg||

nt|vugraphzqy: 2@D=weak with @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: do they make thos?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 9-11 or GF with @d's, as spectators makred it|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not necessarily easy to bid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: 4@S with four top losers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, E-W can make 5@D easily|pg||
nt|wygbe1: good sac against 5d|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: yes, not much to this hand here...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9-12 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will we see support dbl now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: probabbly will get there |pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: there should be a way to disable it..|pg||
nt|po-s: 1NT=spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- thank you Eric Rodwell|pg||
nt|lestergold: it can go off of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: club lead will defeat it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = 3@S  says nothing about strength|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lestergold: well i have specs asking me why they onkly made 11 and i dont know why ui cant answer them|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s 10-13|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like multi 2@d..|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C fit showing jump|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm,,, 4c nice bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rodwell invented Support DBL in context of Big Club system, so never had to worry about what to do with extra strength but NOT 3 of partner's major|pg||
nt|lestergold: it also means that a club will be led and the ruff will beat 4s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've been big fan of fit-showing jumps since ... last millenium|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course 4h only off one but i doubt whether n/s will risk defending at this vulnerbaility they will bid 4s as either insurance or to make|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S is off with a @c ruff........ so any call here could be a phantom|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: you would!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Specs demanding a webcam|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not really on a sane bidding sequence|pg||
nt|thegarve:  4th highest longest and strongest|pg||
nt|wygbe1: this could be interesting - will they play it in 3n? yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bech wanted to shut out the majors I suppose|pg||
nt|wygbe1: now will n lead h?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did, but ....|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: 3n = partner will bid pass|pg||
nt|wygbe1: there is a lot to be said for the heart ace on this auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cashing @HA seems normal against a gambling 3NT, although it should have side values in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|lestergold: push coffee hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4th seat even|pg||
nt|thegarve:  now that lead is poor|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: Filip's fanclub, the leaders before this round, is losing 22:8 to "Ida" team, and therefor are heading for 3rd place|pg||
nt|hedyg: not best for EW|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW belongs to a game, and even a slam, but not in NT....|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S reasonable for sure though|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Yeah, I reckon those Viktor players are pretty good looking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C by South is obviously a super contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: very weak, very short, very vulnerable|pg||
nt|daman: wonderful vul opening|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2nd hand....|pg||
nt|lestergold: the bidding is good by both sides now lets see the killing defence|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: Good practical bidding|pg||
nt|daman: I would like to trade places with him|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d relay|pg||
nt|lestergold: no work likely for the magistrates here|pg||
nt|hedyg: tell them to check the movie of the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW udca|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c ruff coming now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: would you pass 3NT as W?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: have I spoken too soon?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a double dummy quite reasonable slam but hiow on earth do you justify bidding it|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@c probably showed 1 of the top 3 club honors|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: spade*|pg||
nt|athene: quite often, if one side plays natural weak-2 and one side plays multi (or 2@D=@H, as here) then you get swings because the tempo of the auction is changed - i.e. the other ...|pg||
nt|athene: opponent is in the passout seat|pg||
nt|athene: so on this hand for example|pg||
nt|ady: points split     e/w  unable to enter bidding    can make 3@D|pg||
nt|athene: if north opened 2@H then west would be in passout seat and might well double|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: soutyh cant be tyhat chuffed with his collection|pg||
nt|po-s: apparently Asplund doesn´t know who is on lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 13 more IMPs to Iceland Juniors|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: the coach needs to speak to him|pg||
nt|cicus: I can see no sensible way to it either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Make that 12|pg||
nt|thegarve:  leading a @c is giving declarer too much respect|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And now on to the last board of the match|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mtvesuvius: and once again we see a "memo to self" double... giving NS extra chance to cuebid|pg||
nt|hedyg: and W did not open the last hand..|pg||
nt|lestergold: if udca why ten lea surely udca u lead lower from doubnleton|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT rebid by N in CR|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And well matched here|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland uve been coaching n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they are defending this for one off|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure about psychological affect of Migry screaming for @D return|pg||
nt|lestergold: well done could be a swing here as 4s makes unless this ruff is engioneered|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fit-showing jump gets full credit|pg||
nt|lestergold: udca apparently carding not leads|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe -- no udca just signals, not leads|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i only ever played udca once a long time ago i liee twice|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: At MP you would want to be in 6NT (when diamonds come in)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Yes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: 6n played by west is cold too|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: the hnadcuff sellers are out of business after all|pg||
nt|po-s: looks like they bid non-controls|pg||
nt|yuval10: well, East can't possibly ignore his own suggestion....can he? :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I'm strongly opposed to doubling cuebids, unless you really want the lead, since it helps the opponents so much|pg||
nt|lestergold: his self reminder to lead a club|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: lol, he has to listen to himself now :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: dosn cost as it happens|pg||
nt|lestergold: still a club and heart loser |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|hedyg: again a matter of agreements what 2NT means|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: Yes, Ulrika's 3NT rebid was sensible|pg||
nt|lestergold: but u didnt coach east to underlead his ace of hearts thats not fair|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|po-s: maybe - if West ducks a small heart from dummy he gets endplayed after two D ruffs and CA|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed P-O|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Also possible, but Ola did not like his heart holding. Was afraid of wrong-siding NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would, must be partner's decision. Can't come as a surprise that I have six hearts|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and E-W, and they will learn it eventually. Give them time|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: nice J@s|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: one off very good bridge|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yuval10: now @s from N|pg||
nt|hedyg: now @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Yuval :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|minimonkey: No, Im not sure I would bid 3NT as E, surely 3C would be forcing having not overcalled it when you had the chance|pg||
nt|yuval10: 8 boards finished here, only 4 in the CR|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: last board of this match coming up|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, so now there are some chances for 6...|pg||
nt|lestergold: without a spade lead or with one|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: now a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ola and Mikael Rimstedt in the closed room are twin brothers, 13 years young|pg||
nt|lestergold: small heart from dummy west will know to rise|pg||
nt|yuval10: he didn't even bothered|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer did well not to overruff with the K, otherwise defense would've been able to cash out the remaining tricks|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: Roland, can you buy me a keybaord which does not allow any typos please?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|hedyg: overtake and play @s|pg||
nt|lestergold: in fcat more justification for bidding 6N than 6d|pg||
nt|xenya: note that leading the @HA, THEN switching to @Cs is not good enough|pg||
mc|9|nt|lestergold: might be communication difficulties tho|pg||
nt|yuval10: last board of the day, thanks to our capable operator - Johnny karlsson|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: thanks|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The formula is simple. Iceland Juniors are 16 VPs ahead of Filips Fanclub, so 23-7 or better is needed|pg||
nt|yuval10: not easy, but it's makeable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I don't mean to rush our anonymous operator -- a kibitzer asked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C or 1@D?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|yuval10: hmmm that's "Friklund" , operator :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome back to Linköping for the Swedish Junior Teams Championships. Nine rounds of 12-board matches. This is a match from round 3|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW needs to create some swings|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Jenny who?|pg||
nt|daman: soft 3NT to start|pg||
nt|daman: Rimsted|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi all hi Adam|pg||
nt|yuval10: and W starts with a light 1@s|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3NT a bit pessimistic|pg||
nt|petergill: 31-32 balanced usually is not enough for 6NT, hence the sensible 3NT bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: mini NT |pg||
nt|daman: yep   Gavin is a fellow Canadian|pg||
nt|yuval10: i guess 2@s by N = 3(+) cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: a shame about the lie of the minor suits|pg||
nt|xenya: now they have wrongsided both major contracts, sort of|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: 2@c was ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And a minimal sort of result for N/S|pg||
nt|daman: SOS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Malmölaget = The Team from Malmö (Sweden's 3rd largest city after Stockholm and Göteborg)|pg||
nt|hedyg: denying a 5 card suit i assume|pg||
nt|hedyg: and @H stopper?|pg||
nt|yuval10: hence South's 3@s bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h indeed loses 2 tricks in each suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: i guess N is not happy with her @c stopper, thus no raise|pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice X|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2hx is not abad save againsgt a n/s game albei a dodgy game|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d is general game try|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: and last match will square off the Iceland Juniors with "Filip's Fanclub"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just for the curious -- what improvement would you need to make to South hand to play 1@C opening followed by Reverse to 2@D?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well north is only in once- on opening lead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: an overtrick or two maybe forthcoming|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2 and 3@d seems to have been forcing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The simple play is the complete cross ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to William FRisby|pg||
nt|xenya: that should be enough |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: might make 11 tricks here with a squeeze in @h/@h over W|pg||
nt|yuval10: East knows that the suits aren't breaking for declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: she later accepted her own gametry|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: and they sure are NOT!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right, so she might as well have punted 4@H over 2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: especially with the dim switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: but nothing terribly attracive for west to play |pg||
nt|lestergold: best hope mfiding qd with [pard|pg||
nt|yuval10: W played in the Swedish team for the "white house" tournement, that did very well by finishing 3rd |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The babe is playing in the other room, Maria Helin|pg||
nt|yuval10: both East and West played several times in the Swedish juniors/schools teams in many occasions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tre hunkar = three cool guys|pg||
nt|lestergold:  no dim loser so will make|pg||
nt|lestergold: spades will take care theeof|pg||
nt|xenya: ah yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes can make by ducking here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: Without @C10, 6NT would be a poor contract. Even as the cards lie, a declarer in 6NT might fail by taking the @D finesse. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hunkar stolen from English 'hunk'|pg||
nt|lestergold: the name of that team sounds like the title of a certain kind of movie|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pronounced hoonkar|pg||
nt|yuval10: they're very creative as far as team's names are concern :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like this contract is going down a lot|pg||
nt|hedyg: a good time to play @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|athene: good afternoon everyone :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: duck automatic|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: but W could have 4+ @cs and it might be enough for 6 @Cs?|pg||
nt|yuval10: as a spec pointed out|pg||
nt|hedyg: wont need the squeeze now|pg||
nt|yuval10: but indeed, he won't need that now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nothing can stop it working - including ruffing the top diamond with @SK|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|daman: this will be painful|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like only 6 tricks forthe dfence|pg||
nt|lestergold: must keep north out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't qualify officially as a Yarborough, but Renee's 2-10s not really a factor here|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you Kate has to duck then spade honour when she leads a spade up|pg||
pc|d5|nt|thegarve:  Great team name|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bjacobs: self inflicted though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Malmölaget had a 25-4 VP win in round 1, Filips Fanclub a bye|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: well south has solved all problems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kate :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u south was right to attack diamonds|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: East might have bid 3@C, to look for 6@C. |pg||

nt|xenya: MOVIE shows a very curious auction on 9 (to say the least) |pg||
pc|cT|nt|petergill: 1@C - 1@H - 2NT - 3@C - 3@H - 3NT - Pass is a possible auction, the slow way to 3NT suggesting some interest in 6@C as an alternative contract|pg||
