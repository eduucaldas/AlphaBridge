nt|duschek: So it's advantage Chile before the last 16 boards, but no decisive lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Arguably two of the best pairs in South America at this table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agree John, Beto?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|granguru: Lambardi is one of the best players in the world|pg||
mb|d|nt|granguru: PAcareu Robles are the best junior one most probably|pg||
nt|Rafa: Official score is 78,5 Argentina 102 Chile|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|beto: agree roland|pg||
nt|duschek: 4@H seems to make here, but unclear whether it's biddable with 11 opposite 11|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Ventin is from Spain originally I believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|beto: so if ties Chile wins|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|beto: Ventin is from spain|pg||
pc|h3|nt|beto: but is playing for argentina|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|granguru: I have no info regarding Ventin..as Lambardi used to play with Lucena for many many years|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|beto: i think he has a residence in there|pg||
nt|duschek: Apparently it was - Robles drove it all the way to game once he heard partner had an opening bid with 5-4 in the majors|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Service unavailable = too many hits. Try again later|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|duschek: E/W may easily get overboard here unless West resists the temptation to respond 1@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: aha, weak with 5-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|beto: 2@H must me weak 5@S4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H was the alternative, showing spades|pg||
nt|duschek: 2@H is probably showing a weak hand with 5@S4@H - advance Flannery or whatever it's called|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|beto: nice stop although 4@S looks good in this bidding seeing only NS cards|pg||
nt|duschek: There are those who would have bid a direct 4@S holding South's cards, but perhaps the strong hearts persuaded him to be cautious|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree|pg||

nt|granguru: in 1961 the number of players of a team was ilimited|pg||
nt|beto: Any of these champiosnhips were held in Chile John?|pg||
nt|granguru: 1951*|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|duschek: I wonder which type of hand was actually indicated by that 2@S jump overcall|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|beto: i would guess intemediate 11-15|pg||
nt|othered1: Another flat AKA opposite an opening bid.  In last set those hands got to 1N|pg||
nt|granguru: 1951. Santiago, Chile. Players were Alfonso Ag√ªero Antonio Carrasco Carlos Doren Jorge Guzman Antonio Herrera Jorge oVALLE Jorge Suarez and Julio Subercaseaux (founder of the main ...|pg||
nt|granguru: bridge Club in chile:Club Snatiago)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|othered1: Admitted, here north has implied some length in pointed suits|pg||
nt|duschek: But then, perhaps not that attractive holding six to the ace-deuce and two doubleton queens on the side|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|granguru: The tie was in Montevideo and Punta del Este in 1964|pg||
nt|othered1: west has to win second @C and shift to @H.  Not all that clear on auction|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wrong sided this contract, defense should be easy|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|granguru: If my memory does not fail me they were Roberto Asriel Jorge Guzman esteban Casian Roberto Kaufman and Eric Simons|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|beto: need to duck clubs twice, but then defence has to manage to swith to a @H when west wins the 2nd club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When was the last time Brazil was not in a final?|pg||
nt|beto: i dont know roland|pg||
nt|granguru: The another winner was Argentina|pg||
nt|duschek: Will West overtake and shift to a heart? Not obvious - South could have quite a different high card distribution|pg||
