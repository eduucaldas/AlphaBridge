nt|diaoff: After finding out the distribution, S will put this in 4@H I guess|pg||
nt|milton_se: but N/S must find the Ds early|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South bids only 3@H because he remembered (yes) that his partner passed in the first seat.|pg||

nt|wygbe1: rehi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: ...or have they also started to apply the modern pick-a-slam conv? :)|pg||
nt|vugraph815: That's what East thougt while Weat interpreted it as asking about trumphonours and that he needed three to bid the grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: apparently neither did he :)|pg||
nt|haans: not as per cc|pg||
nt|milton_se: ... not easy to take back 20 imps from Berik|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: yes a good old fashioned bid|pg||
nt|papa hall: For those of you not familiar with Swedish geography....2@H is called Askeröd...named after a little town in southern Sweden|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many time a overcall at level 1 is more effective that a preemptive at 3 level|pg||
nt|bt: 2N was conservative?|pg||
nt|magnus_e: on board 14 Törnqvist in other room showed 13+ with norhs hand. It led to 4@s. Good evaluation. |pg||
nt|diaoff: Never argue with success, and the zones were in favour|pg||
nt|vugraph815: I think you could set it for 800, so... no :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|magnus_e: 3@h extras i suppose?|pg||
nt|diaoff: will stop in 5 now I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: South didnt think north could have the @H suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: West has read the text-books 'Only weak players lead from a jack', but he held all the jacks.|pg||
nt|diaoff: Or not...|pg||
nt|haans: we will soon find the answer to that question|pg||
nt|vugraph815: But sure, partner could have had an extra @D and then it would have been a good sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|haans: 4@S preemtive???|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjurn: EW didnt end up too high, NS did. :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: im all for passing 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraph815: And by consuming a lot of space you make it easier for them to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|diaoff: will also lead hearts the safe way making 5|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt with 19 isn't standard, overall with 5 closed suit|pg||
nt|haans: yes they did not find their @C|pg||
nt|vugraph815: So all in all, I think it's an acceptable choice|pg||
pc|s3|nt|diaoff: Not always good to win the auction :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|diaoff: Now he will not score any @D tricks|pg||
nt|vugraph815: Even with this extremely favorable @H-layout, declarer only has 7 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: yes we all have been there :)|pg||
nt|bjurn: generally the double is a good indication |pg||

pc|s8|nt|po-s: make?|pg||
nt|diaoff: oops you are right po, now there is trouble|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|haans: true spoken|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjurn: this wont be too expensive thou|pg||
nt|haans: extra spade trick?|pg||
nt|diaoff: 33 in @S will save him, y|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yo_yo: he'll still make q@C|pg||
nt|vugraph815: Pia thinks....|pg||
nt|haans: double on @Hxxx|pg||
nt|po-s: but now trump|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|diaoff: It was -500 until now|pg||
nt|bt: opps competing to 3@H wasnt bad either ...|pg||

nt|milton_se: meant not making a peaceful -100|pg||
nt|magnus_e: heart back!|pg||
pc|dT|nt|milton_se: also 5-4 in unbid suits would indicate X|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however need to see how effective is the use of 2Major opening with 10/12 - many great pair use this system today|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h7|nt|arvid: Why didnt East bid 2@S?|pg||
nt|milton_se: still in chock?|pg||

nt|milton_se: did Arne miss that?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

mb|1N|an|forcing|nt|yo_yo: This is a good example of why to play in a 4-4 fit|pg||

nt|othered1: If he ruffs low, takes ace and finds out that east held all trumps, he still needs to get off dummy without promoting a trick for east.   So ace seems right here|pg||
nt|snorris: east should have followed with the 10 and q on 2, and 3. dimond|pg||
nt|snorris: that might have induced n to ruff low|pg||
nt|othered1: really east can be counted on to card randomly here, so north shouldn't put too high a premium on the card east plays|pg||
