nt|fann4: 3NT by North would have shown both minors|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: unfortnately, I couldn't find results on the home page of the tournament|pg||
nt|fann4: Perhaps an unusual 3NT by West?|pg||
nt|fann4: A bit light, but good shape|pg||
nt|cicus: updated 11 days ago|pg||
nt|cicus: 3NT would be natural for most pairs|pg||
nt|cicus: in my country a jump to 4@D would show a @H@D 2-suiter|pg||
nt|fann4: Some trumps leads will sink 3@S, but EW make 5@H on the good red suit breaks|pg||
nt|fann4: 3NT now? natural?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, 5@H down with a @C ruff.|pg||
nt|fann4: True, but game is on for EW|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3NT now should be unusual after having passed 2@S originally.|pg||
nt|fann4: I can't see how 3N now can be natural.|pg||
nt|cicus: 3NT now should show 2 suits, surely|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Then 4@C by E, 4@D by W showing reds, and 4@H by E.|pg||
nt|cicus: very timid approach|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cicus: it looks it is characteristic of Egyptian women's bidding|pg||
nt|fann4: Some specs suggest West bid 4@D over 2@S - Leaping Michaels - but the hand seems far too weak for that action.|pg||
nt|cicus: they were very cautious in their last match atoo|pg||
nt|jcwla: Leaping Michaels should be closer to a game in hand.|pg||
nt|cicus: here 4-5 losers is the accepted definition for that bid|pg||
nt|fann4: So long as the defence switch trumps early this will go 1 down.|pg||
nt|cicus: this hand is a bad 5, can easily be 6 or more|pg||
nt|jcwla: East might conceivably take a stronger action over 3NT even though it could be considered hanging partner.|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: who is Nicola?|pg||

nt|jcwla: It has some human qualities. :)|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Because we had Nicola up when she claimed, now we have Phillips. We prefer surnames|pg||
nt|fann4: I confess - I would have overcalled 1@H |pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|cicus: yes, 1@H for me as weel|pg||
nt|cicus: *well|pg||
nt|jcwla: I agree, Jeff, a clear preference for @H's, and not enough extra strength or length for double-then-@H's to be best.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|cicus: now Nicola is not sure 2@H would be forcing?|pg||
