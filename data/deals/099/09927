nt|marlowepi: soyez les bienvenus a cette ile merveilleuse|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: hi all|pg||
nt|imp_bridge: here we have the second session (out of 4) of the CAC finals|pg||
nt|lml: as it turns out it doesn't matter much except that it got the double of 2C in|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|nt|imp_bridge: The winner qualifies for the Bermuda Bowl in Sao Paulo|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://cacguadeloupe2009.com/accueil.htm - Tournament Site|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially with such slow stuff, yes. on the other hand the strong hearts and weakness outside might mean 4H is better. but for me the deciding factor is that the weak suit is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clubs, so bidding stayman may help them on the lead by permitting W to double. so i also bid 3N|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: sorry i was typing all that before N bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and i meant "permitting E to double"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hello jan and Rob :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrw: closed room started with board 1 too ..... so we should have their results quickly|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lml: even though South doesn't want North in he needs heart tricks and nowhe knows the ace is onside|pg||
nt|imp_bridge: i still have lots of excellent hands|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: obviously need heart ace onside. the third club was difficult for W. the D discard makes it easier to find the winning diamond play, ace then hook ten|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: he knew the ace was onside already, because he needed it there|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lml: if he had won the second club he had an enplay|pg||
nt|lml: but now its just down 1|pg||
nt|lml: there is an argument for winning the second club.  East is very likely to have 5 but I can undestand why he won it|pg||
mc|8|nt|lml: if he still had a club the diamond now would squeeze East who hs to throw a heart|pg||
nt|lml: then South throws East in with a club|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: slam here NS|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the simple line--which fails--is to play W for both major suit cards. likely since E is a passed hand. |pg||
nt|mariner1: problem is 6 o r7 and 7 has an issue|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|imp_bridge: 6n = best|pg||
nt|lml: Cordon reversed but he still hasn't fully shown the strength of his hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unlikely that 7 will be bid|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: N suit is not solid and S is short there. hioghly probable they will play 6|pg||
nt|mariner1: do they play Lebensohl over reverses?|pg||
nt|lml: 2@S in that auction is an ambiguous bid for most people.  It shows spades but the values are unclear|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|marlowepi: why ambiguous? it shows spade length and has no upper limit|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lml: he now has shown his 3 suited hand.  3@C is forcing no matter what|pg||
nt|imp_bridge: well that is the question, some do play it as weak|pg||
nt|lml: I hate 4@C|pg||
nt|lml: it is going to confuse Cordon|pg||
nt|lml: you don't want to play on a 4-3|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: well, if that is how a pair plays it, it is still not ambiguous|pg||
nt|lml: sorry I missed a bit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: after 2S! 2nt was probably natural|pg||
nt|imp_bridge: previous brd Gua made 3n +1|pg||
nt|lml: not sure what 3@C was|pg||
nt|imp_bridge: so first blood to Guadeloupe in this set|pg||
nt|lml: I would guess they didn't get a club lead|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: je signale aux spectateurs francophones que s'ils veulent poser des questions ou des commentaires en francais, j'essayerai de repondre|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|imp_bridge: no records, communications here at Gua are diff|pg||
nt|lml: 3@C must have been artificial and shown value|pg||
nt|lml: or they were confused|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|imp_bridge: i would have bid 6n over 2n|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|mariner1: well 12 tricks is no problem so door open for a big swing here|pg||

nt|lml: but they need methods to show a strong hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 7 was not ruled out yet|pg||
nt|lml: maybe 3@S would have been better over 2@H|pg||

mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: yes 7 might be on, but even if so it is almoist surely going to be difficult to bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S suit coming in makes it simple|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: A @c on side...... only thing wrong is K@D off|pg||
mb|1N!|an|forcing|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: a jump rebid in a GF sequence should show a truly solid suit. with 7 it would be fine, i think, but not 6|pg||

nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|lml: I don't play that a reverse is game forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: most people don't |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lml: if you do then that's completely different|pg||
nt|marlowepi: duly noted. but perhaps this NS do|pg||
nt|mariner1: Linda do you play Lebensohl over reverses?|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|imp_bridge: that is why a lot use Wolff sign-off|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: I am surprised that Burville never showed his five card heart suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case i will amend my earlier comment: "a jump rebid in a forcing sequence should show a truly soild suit....."  presumably the 2H rebid is at least forcing|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: 2NT seems clear to me by N|pg||
nt|imp_bridge: i am not suprised at all Linda|pg||
nt|lml: I don't play 2@s shows values with most partners even though I play Lebensohl.  I do with one or two|pg||
nt|imp_bridge: 2@H is to risky|pg||
nt|lml: the forcing notrump sequence is difficult|pg||
nt|mariner1: Lebensohl has 3 advantages A. you can show more hands  B. it is the|pg||
nt|mariner1: sequences over NT interference   C. it helps you remember the system by being|pg||
nt|mariner1: used more ofter (I like C.)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|imp_bridge: 2n is more or less what yr hand is worth|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: rob are you suggesting that if you DON'T play Leb you have the disadvantage of not remembering that you don;t?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lml: I like bidding suits but each to his own.  I agree though the problem on this hand is you have no good way to show an invitational hand with a decent 5 card heart suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: no I have the disadvantage of remembering it when in NT sequences :)|pg||
nt|lml: this is the worst auction for 2/1 players|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|imp_bridge: this not so bad|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lml: this hand plays so very well for north-south even the spades are perfect|pg||
nt|mariner1: I also play Lebensohl over weak 2's by opponents|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|imp_bridge: south might even bid 3@H with a bolster in the suit|pg||
