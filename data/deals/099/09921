mb|p|nt|vugraphzja: se incia la ultima ronda de la final.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mollerjep: en dejlig abningshånd i nord, ikke sandt hr. Werge :-)|pg||
nt|iain sime: 15/17|pg||
nt|paulg: would you open Lucas 2@h with Cuthbertson's hand, or is it too playable in spades?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|werge: Til de knap så rutinerede: Når man åbner på Nords hånd, skal man regne med at komme for højt ganske ofte|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  it was better than the previous Lucas 2@H that McGinley came up with earlier|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iain sime: I guess that is why he didn't.|pg||
nt|capercliff: too good for a lucas 2 no?|pg||
nt|paulg: it would have caused a more interesting auction for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznn: hi all|pg||
nt|paulg: Maiolani clawed some imps back in the last set, but still a big deficit|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|werge: Glimrende indslag af Vest|pg||
nt|mollerjep: og den får hvad den fortjener|pg||
nt|capercliff: is everyone opening with 5-4 these days?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ebrok: Der strammes helt igennem!|pg||
nt|pkl: God dobling, ja.|pg||
nt|werge: Med @C-udspillet ligner det tre stik til Vest - og en skævt fordelt trumffarve|pg||
nt|werge: Det er ikke rart at lade @C 10 løbe...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|Rafa: Estas son las ultimas 16 manos de la final de equipos libres|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome back to Sacramento in California for the Unites States Women's Championship. Finals, six segments of 16 boards; this is the fifth|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|bridge_one: Hello ! have fun !|pg||
mb|p|nt|cbernstn: Hi :)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kit: 4@S call gamling on catching a good fit -- reasonable|pg||
nt|kit: but will not make on normal line of play I don't believe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to David Grainger from Canada|pg||
nt|drg: Hi all|pg||

nt|henryb: Hello|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: slam is ON|pg||
mb|5N|nt|henryb: sort of the same auction as the other room|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Kit|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: declarer will probably cross to ace of spades and lead diamond to queen -- hoping for king onside or 3-3 diamonds to pitch losing hearts|pg||
nt|henryb: with the 1@d opening bid that looks fairly doomed|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 5Nt ask for extra value ( i think)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cbernstn: Maybe specific kings?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: No questions or answers at the table, so I don't know, sorry|pg||
nt|ady: 2 rounds of trumps could be drawn   and 4 rounds of clubs played   discarding a diamond from dummy  as the cards lay|pg||
nt|bridge_one: oor good sgl (for smpl @C or @D)|pg||
nt|cbernstn: Will North draw 2 rounds of trump and then try running four clubs for a diam pitch?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 7 impossible bec sgl in @H in W|pg||
nt|ady: this is not a bad line |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|kit: right|pg||
nt|henryb: but later she will play @hK, @hA and a @h to the 10|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: so no communication - 7 only seeing all cards|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kit: defense better get hearts going |pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|kit: uh oh|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now chance of making|pg||
nt|drg: Made in the other room as well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Peg Kaplan|pg||
nt|pbundy: hi everyone|pg||
nt|kit: more likely, heart to ace, heart, and then decide whether to play North for honor-doubleton or South for QJ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pbundy: very exciting match!|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: not going for that line|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this line lose only with @h 5/1|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for 7|pg||
nt|ady: caught up some imps here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: Sutherlin cashed spade and then thought -- would have been better to think first|pg||

nt|boltonian2:  some action here maybe|pg||
nt|capercliff: how any @d over 1@s?|pg||
nt|capercliff: many*, 2 is normal I gues|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  just the two I think|pg||
nt|iain sime: Double?|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  might double to think of the alternative|pg||
nt|capercliff: the 4@h's makes t awkward|pg||
nt|paulg: just a simple overcall, don't want to lose the opportunity to get hearts into the game or show power later|pg||
nt|paulg: N-S's efforts have prevented a good slam being bid here|pg||
nt|paulg: although the same may happen in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg: hi Alex|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  good afternoon|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: ok, that changes it.|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  the question remains redundant|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  i missed a board, EW missed a slam|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|capercliff: I would not open this 2@c|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  might make it more difficult for EW to realise that diamonds are going to be the problem for 6@H though|pg||
nt|jackth: el acuerdo perfecto para esta mano en la otra mesa|pg||
mb|4C|an|splinter|nt|werge: Den spærrer godt, sådan en 1 @C|pg||
nt|capercliff: would anyone here pen 2@c?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|iain sime: Dave Walker passed 2C in the hope of being on lead v. 3NT.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|r|nt|ebrok: hvor gerne han end ville, syd kunne ikke finde en melding|pg||
nt|werge: Der ser ud til at være samme forskel i de to semifinaler - med Konow i spidsen i den anden|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: hvad med en dobling?|pg||
nt|werge: Fra hvem?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: jeg ved godt den ikke er køn, men... (fra Peter)|pg||
nt|werge: Har du arvet?|pg||
nt|pkl: Den eneste, der kunne doble var Nord. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: nej|pg||
nt|ebrok: med 2hj.? Så hellere 1 sp|pg||
nt|werge: Nords dobling ville være ret risikabel|pg||
nt|werge: Makker melder altid den farve, vi ikke har|pg||
nt|ebrok: Enig igen|pg||
nt|Rafa: El equipo chileno empató el 1er. lugar con Brasil en el Festival Sudamericano en Lima el año pasado|pg||
mb|p|nt|boltonian2:  this is by no means certain|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  done well to reach this game, but it is going to be a difficult make|pg||
mb|5S|nt|Rafa: Chile no ha ganado un torneo sudamericano oficial desde aprox. 1950|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|vugraphzpd: 2 gange på en dag :-)|pg||
nt|pkl: Jeg ville kunne forstå en dobling fra Dorthe, men pas er den sympatisk melding|pg||
nt|ebrok: nu kan han vinde, og bør vinde !!|pg||
nt|iain sime: Well stopped; the trump break sinks 5H.|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, it's not an obvious game to bid and (it may be) unlucky to find the 4-1 trump break|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg: the @cK lead asks for upside count|pg||
nt|ybob: Hola a todos :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|boltonian2:  that might have been the best play|pg||
nt|paulg: diamond or @c3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|iain sime: Yes, a third round of diamonds may be the best shot.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|werge: Har man overhovedet lov at brudge åbningen 1 C som spærremelding?|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @C|pg||
pc|c6|nt|boltonian2:  it was the diamond ony my screen, but this could be good too|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ebrok: det ligner 5 Imp til Schou|pg||
nt|capercliff: could e some communication problems after the @h break is found|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pkl: 1@C var ganske effektiv som spær i gamle dage ;-)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulg: i think a trump back would have been better, but McGeorge will not be confident of the spade situation|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|boltonian2:  ruff this and play a @D?|pg||
nt|capercliff: cant make it from this point I think|pg||
nt|paulg: ruff and anything except a trump?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bridge_one: hello again|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|iain sime: Yes.|pg||
nt|capercliff: interesting hand, I think the best play was to duck a @s right away|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bridge_one: second hand of 3th session|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|boltonian2:  a further two tricks coming for NS at least|pg||
nt|paulg: but going 3 down now|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|boltonian2:  good defence from Walker|pg||
nt|jackth: 4 imps|pg||

nt|pbundy: watching this hand in another match, i saw migry reach 6@D and succeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The winning team will be USA1 in the Venice Cup (women's World Championships) in Brazil in late August/early September. The loser will get another chance against the winning team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: of a playoff match between the losing semi-finalists. That team will be USA2|pg||
nt|athene: south might open a strong NT with this hand?|pg||
nt|athene: strong doubletons, awkward shape otherwise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the playoff match Team Glasson are up by 61 IMPs with 32 boards to go|pg||
nt|kit: definitely will open strong NT|pg||
nt|ady: slam in 3 suits for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|drg: 6@D for E/W here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|kit: hand is very notrumpish, and 1@C followed by 2@D is awkward on this hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: I think even I could make 6@D, Peg, on a very good day|pg||
nt|pbundy: if you played carefully, roland :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|athene: 3nt won't be too exciting|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: well, this was an unexpectged turn of events|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sanborn: "hmmm, might not make this"|pg||
nt|henryb: which will get her to 3N after North tries Stayman|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5C|an|alerted by N|nt|raghavan: Vul 2c X will be big penalty |pg||
nt|kit: I would guess down 3 at a quick glance|pg||
nt|cbernstn: exclusion?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C perfect with shortness in @C|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: The pace of the auction was not as I entered it - I had to go to the other room to help the operator get started there :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: I Know Sabine Auken recommends that you overcall 2@C often after 1@D, but I am not sure she means at these colours|pg||
nt|kit: North has type of hand which might well be better in 3NT even if they have 4-4 fit |pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl is to search a defence, not for the lead, of course !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@H is cue, so 5@C can be keycards with exclusion of @C - but can be also a natural cue giving void|pg||
nt|ady: poor double    I think   allows north to pass    gives n/s more room|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 7 down at 7@c|pg||
mb|5N|nt|Vugraphu1: Sanborn asks about leads "4th best"|pg||
nt|ady: 5NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: i was a bit surprised|pg||
nt|kit: Unfortunately, most systems force North to make that decision herself, when the strong notrumper would probably be better placed to make that decision|pg||
mb|7S|nt|cbernstn: I think she means that as response to exclusion -- 2 with Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: what you't like to know for that decision is mostly what partner's diamonds look like|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: dinkin team behind, but nothing given how many hands are left|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will have to drop Q@D diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Perlman was counting on her fingers the way I do to confirm the number of keycards, so I'm pretty sure that 5NT was in fact a keycard answer|pg||
pc|c8|nt|drg: can still win some ugly imps for -800 here if slam reached at the other table|pg||
nt|cbernstn: maybe not; can run hearts through west's trump|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 7 @S i presume 5Nt was keycards|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pbundy: quite true, david|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: They are in 3NT, though|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: reverse dummy   with hearts 3-3    this will make with 2 club ruffs|pg||
nt|ady: 6 trump tricks    5 hearts   and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with @H 3/3 np however, also with one ruff|pg||
nt|cbernstn: She'll want to give this all possible lines.|pg||
nt|ady: need 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I've seen two auctions where exclusion was doubled yesterday and today - different approaches by the two pairs, yesterday's added pass and XX to their steps, today's just did ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: normal steps. Doesn't matter what you do so long as you know what it is, and both of them did|pg||
nt|cbernstn: Hearts 3-3 is worse than diamond finesse, but can combine chances, I think |pg||
nt|bridge_one: in total 2 ruff with @H 3/3 - so what with @h 4/2 ?|pg||
nt|cbernstn: Diam queen dropping, combined with 3-3 split for example; but this is tough|pg||
nt|ady: dont think you do both|pg||
nt|cbernstn: And she may not make without seeing hearts 3-3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: np with 9 in @S in North, but the 8 is a risk |pg||
nt|bridge_one: can make with 9 in @S in West also with @H 4/2 and @S 3/2|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Picus studying the dummy, now opened her cards back up and looking at both hands|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kit: I would overcall -- occasionally they get you, but not often, and sometimes they are wrong when they try|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: One trick disappeared for the defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so 500 will not cost|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Didn't actually see Bjerkan's discard, but I'm guessing it was a club|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @S 4/1 need other fitctures to make the contract|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c7|pc|h8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this was the risk - of course the finesse in @D is more probably that @H 3/3 |pg||
nt|ady: really on the odds should go down|pg||
nt|ady: was not in a position to try both|pg||
nt|bridge_one: another chance was to play AK in @D before to play last @S from South, for a squeeze @H@D or @H 3/3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c9|pc|h9|pc|s7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|paulg: i like to be able to bid clubs over a short 1@c|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  at this vul I imagine Cuthbertson will come in at some point later|pg||
nt|capercliff: unless they bid lots of @s first|pg||
nt|paulg: sure, but an immediate 3@c would probably have scooped the pot|pg||
nt|iain sime: EW scored 300 in the other room.|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  though if McGinley bids a @S they will be in four before that can happen|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  maybe W will only bid 3|pg||
nt|capercliff: I would imagine 3@c is not natural for some reason|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  an easy 4@S should steady things though|pg||
nt|paulg: another thin game that will probably fail|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  though, as you say, it is going off|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|pkl: .... men 3 af tre er 12.5% ... vi har vist alle været i dårligere slemmer|pg||
nt|capercliff: hmm|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  hmm, not where we imagined this auction would end up|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is interesting indeed|pg||
nt|iain sime: playing equal level conversion, 2D does not show extras.|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  no, though I think I would still have gone for 3@C with the N hand|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  ok, on the plus side we now have communication with the other room|pg||
nt|iain sime: We seem to have established a link with the other room, so should get comparisons.|pg||
nt|paulg: Howie-McGinley are a conservative pair and so far this has not been working to their advantage|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|paulg: Walker is a passed hand|pg||
nt|capercliff: the N bid is what I was wondering about|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  me too, unless W thought 3NT might still be the intended spot|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulg: i think most top players would respond 1@s on this hand for instance|pg||

nt|pbundy: yep|pg||
nt|raghavan: in Hearts will be better|pg||
nt|kit: note that had North followed small, declarer would have put in the 9 as safety play against trumps being 4-0 originally|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i agree :) last hand with 4 controls and 11 hcp is without majors, so right to pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: In the semi's, no one asked anything. This hand, they did ask each other what they had, but alleged that the points were 10, 8, 10, 11 which led to some questioning glances|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lml: I wonder why sanborn didn't give Levitina the spade ruff.  I know it didn't matter but its odd|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D opener might get them to 4@S off 4 top tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ady: 3NT  looks on for n/s    though needs some good fortune|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: @H10xx is a bad holding for south, when East bids the suit|pg||
nt|athene: so she might manage to put the brakes on|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lml: thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@S promises 5+ spades there (X = 4 spades) so the raise with three is routine|pg||
nt|lml: I now understand they play standard carding so the 6 and then the Jack was discouraging|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S can make 3Nt|pg||
nt|ady: even though 4-1  the clubs arfe well placed|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kit: pretty difficult to stop on the South hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: but also 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: soft 10 - but - a heavy 2@S|pg||
nt|cbernstn: Even if N passes, they'd get to game, so this an unlikely swing hand.|pg||
nt|ady: east will probably lead a major|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Perlman, putting down dummy: "so this hand's going to be cold for 6@c"|pg||
pc|h4|nt|raghavan: ????|pg||
nt|pbundy: perhaps mancuso should have cue'd somewhere along the line|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tough to reach slam after a single raise. However, I like 2@S with 4333 if it's constructive|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|lml: unfortunately she is always getting a heart lead|pg||
nt|henryb: If partner is going to open the N hand, and I understand many do, then S should not be committing to game|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Quinn: "what did my partner bid?" as leads the heart 9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: me too would lead in the suit with the honor|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: I disagree -- you just bid vulnerable games with hands like that.  If they go down, so what|pg||
pc|s5|nt|drg: hand isn't really good enough for anything but 2@S initially|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Mancuso could have bid 4@C over 3@H. That must show a maximum 2@S|pg||
nt|drg: yes|pg||
nt|pbundy: yep, roland|pg||
nt|kit: or perhaps Sutherlin should have done something which showed slam interest?|pg||
nt|raghavan: With 20 points + singleton A + P showing values, I would try|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pbundy: don't know their methods; if mancuso can have much less, then sutherline might have been in jeopardy higher|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: Problem is that Mancuso can't both show heart support and show a max at the same time|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|ady: worried  about a diamond switch|pg||
nt|ady: might well play KC    and hope for heart finesse|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: even if you go down, it will be a flat board :)|pg||
nt|lml: the hand is a bit unlucky the points are all in the wrong places.|pg||
nt|henryb: so 6 inps what|pg||
nt|lml: you can't really tell|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: but if you stay out of a bad game and it happens to make, you know you just lost ten imps|pg||
nt|kit: so 10 imps when it makes -- so what|pg||
nt|lml: just move a heart around and give one of the n-s hearts to quinn |pg||
nt|kit: or give North ace of diamonds and no king of clubs -- and club hook on|pg||
nt|henryb: when the score is 107 to 102 both 6 imps and 10 imps matter|pg||
nt|athene: the only thing you might try to do is get north to play it - that might well swing a trick|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: now better placed|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||

nt|ady: now 11 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|pc|hT|nt|drg: 4@C-4@D confirming slam interest, the west hand can probably force to slam now and jump to 6@H to offer a choice|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Mancuso: "I could have bid 4@c, sorry"|pg||
nt|pbundy: well - 4@C will get 4@D (i would think)|pg||

nt|ady: yes     balanced 11  4 diamonds to the nothing   possible|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: Glasson up by a massive 127 IMPs after the 3rd quarter in the playoff match|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W can make 3@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pbundy: that is a massive lead|pg||
nt|henryb: I think only Deas-Palmer play Multi|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: segment rather, since they play six stanzas|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If the match goes the distance, that is|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|pbundy: seems like 3nt will be down 1.......|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out that if i bothered to remember the bidding on board 67 i would know how NS play 2@D :)|pg||
nt|henryb: failry conservative action by North|pg||
nt|athene: north has a slight problem over 2@H - passing might miss a game, but bidding on might go negative|pg||
nt|cbernstn: loses 2 clubs, 2spades, 1h|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: well, you can't win by conceding I've always said|pg||
nt|kit: 4-4-3-2, 10 HCP, weak trumps -- I can't blame North for passing|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Quinn: "you guys get dealt a lot of 11 counts" Sanborn: "but this is 14" Quinn: "it looks like 11"|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|henryb: I don't either, but here it missed a pretty good game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, TRUE|pg||

pc|sA|nt|kit: 2@D is game-forcing checkback|pg||
nt|pbundy: not 100% clear in this instance, kit - might be to their advantage to concede and be fresher for USA  2 match?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, you got that wrong, Peg|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they concede, they are out|pg||

nt|pbundy: and i doubt anyone will be conceding any time soon in this match!|pg||

nt|pbundy: do you have the timing to make with a club out?|pg||
nt|drg: if they are continued|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|lml: Levitina might have bid over 2@h vulnerable especially with a diamond fit|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|pbundy: i must admit if i chose a club i would not lead the 5|pg||
nt|athene: of course, when you take a slightly cautious view in the auction, everything is 3-2 onside|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On 69 North did not open (as Henry suggested), so they managed to stop in 2@S|pg||
nt|lml: I am surprised she didn't|pg||
nt|kit: The key is South's great spot cards -- but difficult for South to bid 3@H|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: N-S in the other room have requested the director to monitor the time. E-W are taking a long time to bid 53|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think so -- East can still shift to spade in time|pg||
nt|pbundy: 2nd highest for me IF i lead that suit|pg||
nt|drg: east must shift though|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pbundy: perhaps they smith however|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|drg: smith doesn't help much with a singleton|pg||
nt|kit: club discard should settle things|pg||
nt|drg: but the club discard gets the point accross|pg||
nt|pbundy: past my bedtime i'm afraid - lol|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|athene: yes the @D9 is worth a lot|pg||
nt|henryb: I.m not. Goldberg and Sprung play a slightly sounder style|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry, I didn't get a look at Levitina's first club - it was the K|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|kit: this is a good example of why leading a 4-card suit is often not necessary -- when it is the killer, there is still time to recover|pg||
nt|raghavan: Good timing|pg||
mc|9|nt|raghavan: in playing H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still only 2 rounds of bidding on 53 in the other room. It has taken 8 minutes so far|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|bridge_one: the Dbl by South at 3@S meqans points - after AK in @d in North, North must have a high Honor in @C - so South must hold K in @H otherwise Dbl would be not justified - for this ...|pg||

nt|athene: 1@S from north will get them to game for sure this time |pg||
nt|bridge_one: of course with a perfect counterplay only 2|pg||
nt|ady: you were right Giorgio    though the defense was a little puzzling|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pbundy: i think i would|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Eventually, they bid the heart slam on board 53, so we are close to a tie shortly|pg||
nt|kit: I would open 1@H -- if I have to rebid 2NT over 1@S, that isn't terrible|pg||
nt|pbundy: that's my choice, kit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the bridge is beautifull because is full of tricks|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3D|nt|henryb: and she will need to guess the @s to make it|pg||
nt|athene: and likely to lose two diamonds, club, spade|pg||
nt|lml: oddly this one isn't as good|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|henryb: which she probably will not|pg||
nt|lml: the heart high cards are just not as helpful|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: I think one should avoid opening 1NT with a 5-card major unless the rebid would be impossible or the hand has notrump written on it|pg||
nt|pbundy: pretty good slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S means also raise in @c IN THIS SEQUENCE|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: declarer may well get spades right, since needs entries for minor-suit plays|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this wont make|pg||
nt|cbernstn: No, but N kind of boxed into bidding it.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: but the opening lead will help with clubs surely|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|drg: especially 17 counts it's easy to avoid opening 1NT|pg||
nt|pbundy: not certain you'd reach it with a 1@H opener  but better odds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: According to the K&R Hand Evaluator the North hand is worth 18.15|pg||
nt|kit: Amazing that N-S don't have better methods here -- 3NT could be a really silly contract if North has xxx in diamonds|pg||
nt|raghavan: made 6|pg||
nt|rcm: surprised Irina bid 1N with N hand, much too good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=Jx+AK10xx+Kxx+AQx  18.15|pg||
nt|athene: @CQ looks normal lead|pg||
nt|lml: too bad she is not going to get a heart lead|pg||
nt|henryb: she will get the clubs played right away|pg||
nt|lml: they might lead D!A|pg||
nt|kit: and when no spade lead, that is an indication that East might have queen|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however for North 3Nt is correct - can make finding the same cards with K in @H instead K in @S, or with AK in @s etc.|pg||
nt|ady: no game for n/s    defending diamonds  would have been best   |pg||
pc|s7|nt|kit: queen of clubs lead seems pretty normal|pg||
nt|lml: but the @CQ looks attractive enough|pg||
nt|athene: with discards threatened on hearts, you would expect an attacking lead though|pg||
nt|lml: even without the @SQ she would lead it|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: would need A10 in @D in North to make 3Nt|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: i don't think this auction so screams for a trump lead that lack of one signals the @SQ|pg||
nt|lml: a chance here|pg||
nt|athene: grosvenor in diamonds :)|pg||
nt|athene: with two discards on hearts, no reason for declarer to get this right|pg||
nt|lml: a grosvenor she might get right|pg||
nt|kit: but an effective one -- declarer may well go up king of diamonds, and that will be that|pg||
nt|athene: surely it's right to go up here|pg||
nt|athene: for any spectators who aren't familiar with this term|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Palmer-Deas just bid the spade slam on 70 after a strong club sequence where East showed heart stortage, @DK and @SQ|pg||
nt|kit: maybe not -- would West risk an underlead looking at those hearts?|pg||
nt|athene: a Grosvenor Coup is where you deliberately play "wrong"|pg||
nt|athene: because the opponent won't take advantage of it|pg||
nt|henryb: one way or another the hand will be over after this trick|pg||
nt|athene: if you play low here, you often go down in cold game when west underled the @DA|pg||
nt|athene: surely she will rise @DK|pg||
nt|kit: well, if East had QJ doubleton of diamonds she might have led a diamond ...|pg||
nt|athene: the only complication is that the number of spade losers is still unknown|pg||
nt|lml: she can afford to lose to stiff honors and still have a play|pg||
nt|kit: and as pointed out, would West really underlead AQx or AJx?|pg||
nt|henryb: I suspect the sounder opening style will help Goldberg-Sprung on 71, and that they will bid that game|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Unfortunately they are not allowed to have that tool at the table|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h8|nt|athene: declarer doesn't want to rise @DK and lose THREE diamonds when she wasn't losing a trump|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so the J in South would work|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h2|nt|kit: Experts do have that tool at the table -- it is called experience|pg||
nt|lml: nice defense... points to Quinn|pg||

nt|kit: hard to see why stiff diamond vs. stiff major would make a difference, but I don't know their methods|pg||
nt|pbundy: well - if north had shown more than a 15 to 17 nt, would have been much easier|pg||
nt|kit: too much discussion about points -- If North had had queen of diamonds instead of queen of clubs then slam would have been so-so at best, yet hand would initially look same ...|pg||
nt|kit: strength to North|pg||
nt|pbundy: they did find the heart lead to beat 2@S and motor into the lead |pg||
nt|pbundy: board 54|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hand evaluation is not that easy but very important. As Kit said, it comes with experience|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All these players are very experienced|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry - they took a break too quickly for me and I had to minimize the screen so no one could see. Back now|pg||
nt|athene: the reason you might, as declarer, get that right, is that west might not know how many tricks the defence need fast in diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: remember, Quin though declarer probably 5-2-3-3|pg||
nt|henryb: easy 4@s for E-W|pg||

nt|athene: E-W don't have all that many big cards|pg||
nt|lml: its a bit lucky 25% basically ... borderline even vul|pg||
nt|lml: you only want to get there after the hand is over|pg||

nt|athene: ah sorry only if played by East - 14-16 NT or something like that|pg||
nt|lml: thats the basically part|pg||

nt|lml: I open that playing that notrump range and that is the only time|pg||
nt|lml: anyone else like to open that hand|pg||
nt|athene: north?|pg||
nt|kit: Deas-Palmer got to the slam on board 70, when their drury bid was 2@C so didn't get doubled|pg||
nt|athene: yes, of course|pg||
nt|kit: shows how much luck there can be in bridge|pg||

nt|lml: that was an interesting idea about methods over the double|pg||

nt|athene: 2@C puppet to 2@D, to make a mild invitation with 2@S|pg||
nt|lml: I like to bid 1NT there too and then let partner checkback|pg||
nt|kit: but Quinn does well to take an invitational sequence|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: do feficit down to below 100|pg||
nt|Walddk2: deficit|pg||
nt|kit: Wittes has easy 4@S call now -- too bad if king of diamonds seems bad|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: east will surely pounce on even a mild invitation like a starving chihuahua on a pork chop|pg||
nt|lml: they may get pushed and they did|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|drg: X is my choice. 1NT overstates the HCP and understates the distribution|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 48-2 now in this set!|pg||
nt|pbundy: agreed|pg||
nt|kit: this is the sort of vul game you just bid|pg||
nt|athene: yes, she has downgraded @DK under a lead-directing double once today|pg||
nt|athene: and lost a slam|pg||
nt|athene: she isn't doing it again!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: but by rights the @DA should be offside|pg||
nt|kit: key was Quinn't decision to invite --many would have just signed off at 2@S|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: or no spade lead if playing a heart    needs a little nerve|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: How good is 4@S? Pretty bad|pg||
nt|lml: wasn't Quinn invited Wittes was going.  |pg||
nt|henryb: a little better than your slams, Roland|pg||
nt|kit: true, 4@S isn't great -- but it has one virtue this deal|pg||
nt|athene: it is certainly amazing how often people downgrade a king on the bidding|pg||
nt|athene: when the player over them shows strength in that suit|pg||
nt|athene: and how rarely it's right|pg||
nt|lml: with the double I would think it would be about 10-15%|pg||
nt|henryb: the 3@d bid restored the king|pg||
nt|lml: at least in part|pg||
nt|henryb: and South did not overcall 1@d, which with a good diamond suit including the Ace she might well have|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need to be brave to play the king of @H if West duck the Ace !|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: So Glasson's lead down to 'only' 81. Was 127 before the started, remember|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This game is way below par, even vulnerable, but who can argue with success|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|pbundy: i've seen people pick up that   in 16 hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 32 more boards tomorrow, so all is not lost yet|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lml: get it over with|pg||
nt|lml: how good that feels|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|nt|ady: would only go down if west hand QJXXX  and east AX   and palyed a 2nd heart|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ady: played|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d5|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ady: might certainly try a heart at MPS|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: a spec points out that on a trump lead the game is even worse - it probably needs 2-2 trumps|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h9|nt|bridge_one: at MP ok|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: because you don't have any fast way back to hand after leading a diamond up|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: so they might well be stopping the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|kit: you have king of hearts entry (as both aces need to be onside to have a chance anyway)|pg||
nt|kit: so if it is making, they can't stop the diamond ruff even with a trump lead|pg||
nt|athene: yes but if south has a third trump|pg||
nt|kit: both opponents can't hold a second trump with trumps 3-1|pg||
nt|henryb: and if the aces are split, they will have difficulty leading three trumps|pg||
nt|athene: yes right|pg||
nt|lml: this all sounds like a logic problem|pg||
nt|athene: they can't duck the diamond to the @DK, to allow the right hand to win|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: hang on - yes they can?|pg||
nt|kit: if they duck, play another diamond, win second trump in hand, diamond ruff|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: yes yes|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: they have to block the diamonds|pg||
pc|sT|pc|dK|nt|athene: that's cute :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|henryb: why are we playing this?|pg||
nt|athene: well, trumps are unlikely to break 3-3 when you have a 6-3 fit, so you "only" need the two aces|pg||
nt|kit: good way to fill time looking at this while Quinn plays this out when it is just a claim|pg||

nt|iain sime: Maiolani has got on the board, but this could be another six or eight imps to Steel.|pg||

mb|5H|nt|henryb: me too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if they try will make 7|pg||

nt|bridge_one: after the splinter 2 key cards are welcome for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 3@C is okay too I meant better than redouble|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C allows them to bid 2@D and pd to bid 2@H on a great day :)|pg||
mb|5N|nt|kit: this shows how bad the redouble was -- E-W could easily be cold for 5@C if West has good clubs, and the suit was never bid|pg||
nt|lml: I don't like redouble opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|athene: yes, it has to be right to get your second suit in|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: call me crazy - but i would have responded 2@D to 1@H|pg||

mb|6H|mb|p|nt|pbundy: i know; i know...... a strange thought|pg||
nt|henryb: They are cold for 5@c|pg||
nt|athene: especially since it's lower-ranking than the suit south is likely to bid (or jump in)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: but since 2@C doesn't show this kind of playing strength, I still prefer 3@C|pg||

nt|pbundy: IF it's a diamond preempt :)|pg||
nt|drg: with KJTx@D X will be right unless south bid 2@S holding 4 of them, as the diamonds can't be going anywhere|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I had two already in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: They did earlier, Roland, you must have been someplace else :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *They|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S pass pass Dbl ; pass pass pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: might have the same problem OR|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: dont think thats a likely auction|pg||
mb|2H!|an|Majors|nt|cbernstn: Yes, it's a standard 2s opening, and a difficult reopening by E|pg||
nt|lestergold: not at imps|pg||
mb|2N!|an|Lebensohl|nt|drg: not only bid just 2@S, but passed after her partner's game try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, watching football (soccer) at the same time|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: again 1Nt - but shows points|pg||
nt|kit: East hand easily worth jump shift IMO|pg||
nt|lml: 2 games make as the cards lie|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: We even had time to get chocolate chip cookies from the front desk during the earlier break :) (I"ve been on a Doubletree chocolate chip cookie diet at this tournament|pg||
nt|kit: needs almost nothing to make game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H dont, majors|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n looks like a lebensohl bid|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, presume a preference in minors or @D |pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I don't know whether 2N was Leb or minors - |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: which she might do on the hand she has, perhaps|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: you wouldn't be happy if you rebid 2@C on that east hand and partner passed after some thought|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it must  be lebensohl in style |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pbundy: do we have spade leaders or diamond leaders on this auction?|pg||
nt|henryb: 170 later|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C isn't a bad spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: it looks to me like Wittes was counting her points rather than looking at her hand|pg||
nt|athene: a lot better than 4@S a moment ago :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, full lebenshol|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3d presumably directly would be game going|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Vugraphu1: I'm pretty sure that Bjerkan wrote Majors for 2@h but it's possible it was hearts and another|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lml: it was a lazy bid|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: could be better to defend a heart  contract with a singleton spade to lead   the diamond suit is moderate for a 3 level contract|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|pbundy: partner had the WRONG pointed king :(|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|kit: slam is very bad percentage when opponents might be stopping in a part-score|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ady: and 3 low hearts  not a good attribute|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs to get the dim right|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|d3|nt|cbernstn: probably would have defended 2@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: still looks like losing 2 clubs and 1 off|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Weinstein first pulled out the ten, then put it back and played the K. Perlman: "that was a careful King, right?"|pg||
nt|lestergold: Perlman knows that clubs will not be breaking 3/3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: oh yes, i am not suggesting it is right to bid slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Quinn: "sorry" "I could have bid 2@h and kept you alive, sorry"|pg||
pc|d2|nt|drg: diamond lead seems pretty normal. AQTx would be avoided, but the 5th diamond makes an enormous difference|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: Can she do anything about it. Any pressure play ?she is thinking|pg||
nt|lestergold: I do not see any hope tho|pg||
nt|bridge_one: me too i don't see a way to make the contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: small @S and duck win|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|kit: diamond lead clear -- needs just one thing -- any other lead needs a parlay|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: so, make a wish|pg||

nt|henryb: hard|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb: I predict someone will bid 5@d|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: the michaels at 2@H is standard - 4@S same|pg||

mb|p|nt|fcarioca: 3 rounds of @C discarding @SQ might make the trick...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now declarer must play to exclude West to entry - so A in @C K in @C and 10 @C work bec West don't have Q or J in @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: these players know each other well, but non-Scots may not realise that a McGeorge 1@c bid in third seat is an artifical bid|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 55-2 now this set for Moss in the playoff match, so 'only' 74 in arrears (was 127 before the set started)|pg||
nt|kit: and I'm not suggesting seriously that opponents might stop in part-score -- at least I wouldn't have been so had I not seen what happened|pg||
nt|athene: if west had bid 2@H, what would east do? she might just bid 3@C over that|pg||
nt|ady: this match would be very close if Picus had guessed the winning line in 7@S   over 30 imp swing|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S  making for e/w     n/s  can lose 500 in 5 diamonds   for a save|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: very short break|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this vulnerability unlikley to be attempted with north's picture gallery of jacks|pg||
nt|ady: yes   I agree   clubs need to be 3-3  to gain a sure entry   and K@D needs to be right  and you are not making a big save|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim finesse wrong and it would be 800 odds definitely not in favour of this sort of vulneable adventure|pg||
nt|bridge_one: woulod need a sgl/void in North to think at a defence - 5422 can be a disaster|pg||
nt|lestergold: except at mps it is a policy of man to virtually neve knowingly sacificie vulnerable- only take insurance hwne its a very close situation|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pbundy: yep; club guess|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: that wasnt the finesse Wittes needed|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Indeed, but not for NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: she does; also a good diamond suit for a diamond contract|pg||

mb|1H|nt|kit: sometimes happens when one of my opponents miscounts his hand|pg||
nt|kit: if gambling, this is a very big position with this shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is not an opening I like. This hand is not suited for it in my view|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: 3nt is specifically gambling? or showing a strong 4+-level minor pre-empt?|pg||
nt|kit: I think gambling|pg||
mb|2H|nt|raghavan: Jump to 3s  - respect to 3rd H open|pg||
nt|kit: I guess they play this as limit raise -- most pairs don't|pg||
nt|Walddk2: THis must be limit for them. I like 3@D better|pg||
nt|lestergold: no games here|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|bridge_one: so they use solid suit to open at level 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: me 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Simply because it gives opener one more step to re-invite (3@H)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: When the tray came back, Sutherlin said "I bid 3@s - I didn't mean to - I'm sorry partner, I pulled the wrong card" Mancuso: "It's okay partner, I have you covered"|pg||
mb|3H|nt|henryb: she does not have a 4 level minor preempt|pg||
nt|kit: but hard to argue with success, as it got them to exactly what they can make|pg||
nt|kit: or so I thought|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT has many flaws, one of which is a void|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: If I read Kerri's note correctly, it was gambling with no side A or K. |pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Opponents asked about auction and NS said never had it before|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   might get too high here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: shouldnt do|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   looks doomed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East would agree to play 2@s |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well that last part was right but this is not my gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: west cannot thinkl she ha a game try opposite a 2 level raise surely?|pg||
nt|lestergold: it would need an absoluteb perfecto opposite for game to be on|pg||
mb|p|nt|drg: makes 4 today, not even a bad spot on the K@D lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h is not guaranteed|pg||

nt|boltonian2:  not sure you need the entry|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  5 might actually be more difficult than 6 though|pg||
nt|paulg: hard for Walker to see 5-6 opposite|pg||
nt|mowen: is it reasonable to cash @SAK and play the same hand for 3@Ss and 3@Cs|pg||
nt|capercliff: Walker might take some time with this one|pg||
nt|paulg: Walker takes time on most hands ... I think Cuthbertson is the only fast player at the table|pg||
nt|capercliff: safety play must be to finesse @s twice anyway no?|pg||
nt|mowen: not so good if the finesse loses|pg||

nt|mowen: low heart now?|pg||
nt|paulg: i guess ducking the diamond in case spades are 4-1 offside|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You can distinguish between a limit raise with 3 and 4 card support (2NT, 3@D) or vice versa|pg||
nt|raghavan: since 2d=2s, 3S shows real 11-13 with support|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: They apparently play 3@s as a mixed raise, but Peggy thought she was too good for it as a passed hand. Mancuso pointed out it was on 2 of 2 finesses|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Now a discussion about 3NT ... ending with Quinn: "they make 2N"|pg||
mb|1C|nt|henryb: Mancuso may gain imps for defending 3H down 2. Deas-Palmer bid 6@c, which is probably one down|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb: on 74|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Quinn just realized what Sanborn had and says "you had a good hand"|pg||
nt|cbernstn: This looks like a tricky hand.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|cbernstn: 3nt and 5-minor look to be down NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: it would be highly natural for n/s to reach a minor suit game which is unlucky in the dim breask|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: north has a lot of meshing honours, with her partner surely having a singleton spade|pg||
nt|athene: she might just bid 4@H?|pg||
nt|athene: even if east has a stack, there might well be a trump coup|pg||
nt|henryb: meanwhile Moss has continued the charge and is now down only 32|pg||
nt|kit: yes, she can envision a possible slam now|pg||
nt|athene: you can pretty much play it through in the bidding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes both impossible|pg||
nt|ady: only a part score here|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3n would have had  play on a non  spade lead but that cant happen|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   can make  3  of either major   and n/s  4 of either minor|pg||
mb|4C|nt|pbundy: does 3@C show extras?  i assume 2@S does not :)|pg||
nt|kit: this 2@S call looks very strange, particularly since partner pretty much denied 4 spades|pg||
nt|drg: asking for trouble|pg||
nt|pbundy: we'll have to play together one of these days kit ....  same wavelength|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcm: Agree, Kit, would have bid 3C before 2S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I don't think it is entirely clear|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|kit: off we go into the wild blue yonder|pg||
nt|drg: now asking for more trouble|pg||
nt|athene: i think south might have rebid 3@H rather than 2@H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s have managed to stop!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good stop|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|athene: if you assume that bidding at all shows a minimum hand|pg||
nt|lml: unless redouble shows xx or worse 2@H doesn't show hearts as good as that|pg||
nt|kit: I think North's final pass was very conservative -- even if South doesn't have king of diamonds, it is almost certainly onside|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: but odds of two dim losers here are small|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not easy to make - i would risk to play game|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pbundy: i bet peggy is shocked to be playing 4@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: No double, no trouble?|pg||
nt|kit: why?  4@C is probably making, isn't it?|pg||
nt|drg: fortunately for E/W diamonds are 3-3 with the ace onside and the singleton club is the J|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Mancuso: "down 1" Sanborn: "I was rooting for making 6"|pg||
nt|rcm: this probably comes home|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes making|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: The only bids Mancuso made that I understand were her opening 1@D call and the pass of 4@C|pg||

nt|raghavan: Yes kit esp af|pg||
nt|raghavan: ter her Partner passed 1st|pg||
nt|raghavan: Sother did not pass- so Mansc expected 11+|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Perlman: "what am I in, 4?" Weinstein: "is that good or bad?" Perlman "I'm not sure"|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i think its odds on to make it makles on all 2/2 dim breaks makes when ad onside and when j ios singleton 5d tgoes off of course if they canfind a dim ruff|pg||

nt|ebrok: Det må bliveru, ja|pg||
nt|pkl: Jeg forstår en opvurdering hos Nord, men Syd burde nedvurdere|pg||
nt|pkl: Enig med ruder ud|pg||
nt|fcarioca: singleton @CK allows it to make, no communication NS|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes. i haven't seen K sgl in @c in South|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ebrok: Ja, "floppet" var ikke en rammer|pg||
nt|paulg: Maiolani are a dangerous team though who played in the quarter-finals of the Gold Cup last December|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  even better then|pg||
nt|ybob: todo esto, para mostrar invitacional en ST de E|pg||
nt|ybob: np|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the Dbl at 4@H is a old way to procede - normally Dbl means no interest in @H|pg||
nt|robinswr: This is Lerner's fault|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally is a advantage to know anythings about the hand of p, but there are the possibility to give informations very usefull at opps for the counterplay|pg||
nt|iain sime: This looks like one off .|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fcarioca: Congrats to the winning team, Fred, Mané, Vita, Gabriele, Leão, Aranha|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jackth: unos pocos imps más... estamos atrasados con los soures! |pg||

nt|paulg: This is the last hand of the third set and I'd like to thank our excellent operator, Stephen Peterkin, ...|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  so 10 imps back, will it persuade Maiolani to carry on for the last 16?|pg||
nt|ybob: Cuidado a los campeones que el 2011 vuelve P. G. :)|pg||
nt|jackth: PG?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|robinswr: will he lead a low heart|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|pkl: Men 3NT er stadig hjemme hvis man gætter klørfarven|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c2|nt|paulg: my fellow commentator - Alex Wilkinson - and all the kibitzers for your help|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  thanks all|pg||
nt|paulg: the next set is scheduled to start in 50 minutes|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|werge: Man kan KUN gætte rigtigt|pg||
nt|robinswr: don't know why you would lead the ace against a slam you need count not attitude if Qxx is in dummy|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: BYE ALL ! ty for kibitz BBO :)|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  you never know, might be able to ruff another @D for the 8th|pg||
nt|jackth: @h bloqueado y quedaron del buen lado además|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|iain sime: Could have gone down quickly- club ace, two spades and two ruffs, with a trump to come.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c3|nt|paulg: i'd play on if the lead is less than 80|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bridge_one: yes, K in @H is more precise|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ebrok: du kan ike gætte galt|pg||

nt|werge: Som jeg hele tiden har sagt: Det er hænder som disse, man skal gi´ den hele armen...!|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|robinswr: i guess if clubs are 4-1 he can play on spades|pg||
nt|Rafa: la ultima rueda de esta final se juega a las 17:00 hora de Chile, 18:00 de Argentina|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pkl: Nej - du kan ikke gætte galt. |pg||

nt|ebrok: som jeg sagde, læg mærke til de gode10ere|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can make the hand also with @C 4/1 with the finesse in @S or @S 3/3 or @S 4/2 and Qx|pg||
nt|robinswr: if learner asks his teammates why they didn't bid slam, they should say becaues opponent bid 4hearts|pg||
nt|bridge_one: interval about 20 minutes before other session|pg||
nt|Rafa: www.sudamericanobridgechile2009.cl resultados e información|pg||

mc|6|nt|mcarroll: A real phantom sacrifice as they stopped in 2@S when 4 is on|pg||
pg||

nt|raghavan: I endorse what peg said|pg||
nt|pbundy: and we finish with a bit of shape here!|pg||
nt|raghavan: My spl Tx to Roland for encouraging me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set in this room. Many thanks to the USBF and Jan Martel in particular, our splendid operator and vugraph organizer|pg||
nt|lml: if she bids 5@C Sanborn will bid 5@D|pg||
nt|kit: I think her proper try is 5NT -- pick a slam, and try to make it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to our excellent commentators: Linda Lee, Kit Woolsey, Henry Bethe and Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Quinn: "Sorry, I should have led a club, then she couldn't cross to her hand in spades, would have to cross in diamonds ... then I wouldn't even get that trick ... hate to make ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: things easy on Kerri, though"|pg||
nt|lestergold: except topday when it cant make!!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Or rather claimed, conceding 2 diamonds and the spade|pg||
nt|bridge_one: last board , i presume - so THX all !|pg||
nt|ady: poor 12 pts west|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: part score in spades for n/s  best|pg||
nt|ady: may overcall 1NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but 4/3 in majors, so can open|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lml: I don't know if I would be sure enough of my analysis to do that|pg||
nt|ady: likely passed out|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Last segment scheduled to start in 50 minutes, but we may get an early restart, so don't go too far away |pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Perlman: "this is going to be a boring hand"|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: North might well have just shut up here and let opponents pick their poison|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Both teams have generally wanted to start shortly after the comparison, so I suspect we'll start about 15-20 minutes after the last table finishes|pg||
nt|lml: poo Wittes Levitina keep bidding her suits|pg||
nt|ady: will struggle   especially on diamond lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: The heart lead defeats 4@S or 5@D, the club lead defeats 3NT|pg||
nt|drg: n/s likely headed for some game here, but all are beatable|pg||
nt|pbundy: is that everyone's opener here?|pg||
nt|drg: heart lead and club shift beats 3N as well|pg||
nt|pbundy: i must admit i would pass in 2nd chair|pg||
nt|kit: not the low heart lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: will bid 2D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 32 more boards tomorrow|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: The winning team will be USA1 in the Venice Cup (women's World Championships) in Brazil in late August/early September. The loser will get another chance against the winning team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: of a playoff match between the losing semi-finalists. That team will be USA2|pg||
nt|kit: Just what Levitina wanted to hear|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Mancuso asked about 3@d and Sanborn wrote an answer but I can't read it|pg||
nt|pbundy: well- unless peggy finds a club lead against 3nt, opening is a winner.......  i'm assuming that is where they land|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the playoff match Glasson up by 73 with three boards to be scored|pg||
nt|pbundy: although that does not seem like a clear cut supposition at this point|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Closed room on board 74, so restart on schedule seems likely|pg||
nt|ady: I would think 2 down|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Play has been very fast in this room|pg||
nt|lml: both sides are trying to go for a number|pg||
nt|kit: Quinn is a passed hand, but seems like she has already shown this with the double|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sprung-Goldberg are the slowest pair in this match, I think|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pbundy: now this does surprise me...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: 1 down for sure|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: very good double by Wittes -- not the time to chicken out|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: sure, they might make it 1 time in 10 -- but that's not the way to bet|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rcm: easy down 1|pg||
nt|athene: why did north bid 3@C over 2@H? seems strange|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This may go 2 down although declarer can escape for down 1|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pbundy: conceivably even 2, if sutherlin leads 3 rounds of hearts|pg||
nt|lml: it does to me too... she knows the north-south hands are not going to mesh well|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pbundy: sanborn must guess what to do|pg||
nt|kit: Sutherlin will certainly do that|pg||
nt|pbundy: i liked their chances in 3nt a whole lot better.......|pg||
nt|raghavan: kerri confuses|pg||
nt|rcm: needs to trust partner's H8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @HQ can't fool anyone. Mancuso would not lead top from  xxx|pg||
nt|rcm: shouldn't be confusing at all|pg||
nt|kit: I can't believe she is even thinking|pg||
nt|rcm: with 8-6-3, would either lead 3 or 6|pg||
nt|kit: if declarer has stiff heart, nothing can be done about it anyway|pg||
nt|raghavan: ok trying|pg||
nt|raghavan: to confuse|pg||
nt|kit: even if they lead top from xxx in their partnership|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sutherlin put the screen down to ask Levitina a question - they're writing so maybe I'll be able to tell - it was about 3@d and I think Levitina wrote "I took it to be 56 forcing"|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: trying to push opps into 3@H so you can double and lead four rounds of hearts?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C went 2 down on 74, so 9 IMPs to Mancuso|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|lml: I think Kit said something about not bidding tight slams when your opponents might not bid game|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must guess to ruff high and finesse @D10 to escape for 1 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: but Picus can make 3h if she reads them|pg||
nt|lestergold: restricte choice etc|pg||
nt|lestergold: finesse that 8h!|pg||
nt|ady: may try a black card|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|pbundy: looks like sanborn has guessed that|pg||
nt|kit: so far, so good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble is you don't know they stopped in a part-score|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: no, but they could work out it was a lively possibility|pg||
nt|lestergold: cann get back later for the ht|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanwhile e/w have their 7 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: now diamond to ace, club ruff, diamond up, and ....|pg||
nt|athene: since they play a strong club but the pair in their seats doesn't|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bridge_one: 1 down|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ady: meantime lose a diamond 2 clubs and a spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: that couldnt be prevented|pg||
nt|lestergold: on the dim lead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: they can see it might go 1@S all pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thx to all spectators for watching; hope you enjoyed the show and will be back for the finale a little later|pg||
nt|athene: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I am told that the other match will finish ahead of this one :), but we will not be able to resume the Vugraph until both matches start the final segment, because they are playing ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: the same boards in both matches|pg||
nt|lml: thanks it has been fun to watch this seesaw battle|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: wd|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ady: should p lay heart now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a fun way to go down only one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if play the finesse in @H if West play the 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: that would be a test playing th heart now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|nt|pbundy: yep|pg||
nt|kit: 2 low spades go on JH and AC, so down 1|pg||
nt|pbundy: for a push...........|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pbundy: hope to see everyone tomorrow for the final set of these 2 matches!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thx to all spectators for watching, hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|pbundy: night :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: See you tomorrow|pg||
nt|lestergold: no westr fels that safety play for one off is good bridge|pg||

nt|ady: did|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ok now :)|pg||
