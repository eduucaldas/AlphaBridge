nt|mdgraham: matter of style - some like to support with three cards |pg||
nt|lml: I had a question about how you can play internationally for more than 1 country|pg||
nt|onebid: yes, but strong enough playing Precision to bid 2@S if partner prefers to 2@H|pg||
nt|lml: Apparently Migry Zur has played for Israel before|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, can rebid 2@d, and then 2@s if partner bids 2@H|pg||
