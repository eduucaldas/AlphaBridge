nt|brolucius: North would like to play this slam, to protect his @DK.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Bermuda can't complain about not getting any cards here.|pg||
nt|brolucius: If South is first to bid no-trumps, North can perhaps play in 6@C, but the @DA is onside anyway.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Unfortunately we lost all data from this set|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk3: So this is the scoreline before the set started|pg||
nt|vugraphzrw: i will enter the data progressively|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now 2@H - 3NT, perhaps and North will play 6NT.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Perfect for fourth-suit forcing, since South does not know whether spades, clubs or NT will be best, nor at what level.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: just around the magic 33 points  for slam, even I bid this one|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if 2@H is played as forcing to game, which I think is easily the best method, North might still jump to 3NT because of the double stopper in hearts.|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4NT should be taken as a limit bid because no suit has been agreed. In that case North can say 6NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well bid!|pg||
nt|imp_bridge: agree david, though what we call in our country: optional blackwood|pg||
nt|brolucius: If spades break really badly, you can still lead towards the @DK.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|brolucius: You hear people saying that they will 'show aces if they are willing to accept the try', but there cannot really be two aces missing when you have the values for 6NT.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Perhaps 5@C was about right.|pg||
nt|imp_bridge: so it is guadeloupe who will represent zone 5 in the upcoming bermuda bowl|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some Norths would have bid 4NT on their hand (instead of 4@C) but that would be a bit over the top.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Agreed - no 5 level safety.|pg||
nt|imp_bridge: remember 6@S on previous was not that great on a SMALL diamond lead (not poss of course, ace bare)|pg||
