nt|duschek: on|pg||
mb|1N|nt|othered1: rather 11C - 1@H - 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: it isn't like 3NT is the worst contract ever been in last hand -- sometimes spades are 4-4, sometimes they don't find the spade lead when 3-card holding is on lead|pg||
nt|granguru: 1@D=4+@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west will relay with 1s|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: relay this|pg||
nt|duschek: The normal contract, but stone dead|pg||

pc|cK|pc|h7|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|duschek: It's not that any other lead is attractive in view of the auction|pg||
nt|kit: the contract will be the same, but number of undertricks might vary|pg||
nt|duschek: Agree|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: down 2 if he finesses hearts, 1 if he plays on diamonds|pg||

nt|granguru: Chile increased the gap to 27|pg||
nt|kit: I doubt if East would ever sell to 3@C with stiff club and heart support|pg||
mb|2C|nt|duschek: If 1@C shows at least three clubs, it is hard to imagine North selling out to 2@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|beto: lots of losers|pg||
nt|kit: looks like the bad trump split does him in|pg||
nt|granguru: -2 probably|pg||
nt|kit: otherwise, he might have 9 tricks in time -- 4 clubs, 2 diamonds, 1 heart, 2 spades|pg||
