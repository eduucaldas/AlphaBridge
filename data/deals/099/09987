nt|mariner1: Closed Room|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: if slow auction from Rozanne was invite, then 3N probably the most costly bid|pg||
nt|daman: unfortunately the Moss team is running out of time   7 boards to accumulate 45 IMPs     tall order|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well we can't say there haven't been enough slams this set|pg||
nt|daman: they had their chances|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|onebid: RKC should end the suspense|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mariner1: 2@C good call|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it is amazing that they even played this set -- after first 3 sessions it would have been very easy to give up|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: I totatally disagree - when I have 4 card support, I tell partner the good news right away!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right key feature is source of tricks NOT the singleton @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: will the 2@S jam them out of slam, or help|pg||
nt|onebid: hmmm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sounds like Judy does not have agreement that some have where immediate splinter guarantees an honor in all unbid suits|pg||
nt|onebid: I bid 2NT right away - not splinter|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Closed Room EW never bid|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ahhh   i can live with 2N|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like Migry's style, she does not sit on her hands...........|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but abhor splinter|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: would anyone else bid 2@S?|pg||
nt|mariner1: if you sit on your hands you lose a lot of matches,,,,,,,,,, and have flat|pg||
nt|mariner1: hands..........|pg||
nt|mariner1: Migry is after a swing|pg||
nt|onebid: or flat... never mind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in this situation -- i like -- don't think i'd always do it|pg||
nt|onebid: instead of 4@H, how about 4@D now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: writing by Cohen|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: hmm 4@H as picture bid?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: 4@D after partner's natural 3@D sounds like a @D fit|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: 2@S serves a purpose   it gums up the auction and it might allow you and your partner to find a useful sacrifice if you have a fit   on the other hand, you could easily go for a ...|pg||
nt|daman: huge number for entering a live auction|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mariner1: S figures its on a hook at worst|pg||
nt|onebid: Yes - mis-saw auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my only question 3@H vs 4@H|pg||
nt|onebid: 3@S|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: 3@S seems too ambiguous -- about @S holding, and which red suit supported|pg||
nt|onebid: both black?|pg||
nt|onebid: round is clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: I meant minor kings........ eyes spinning today|pg||
nt|onebid: mine too Rob:)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: since 3@H forcing, i would assume 3@S=@D|pg||
nt|onebid: not on Stasha's auction certainly - but on mine:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or just trying to get to 3N|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: migry not thinking, |pg||
pc|d7|nt|mariner1: both round K's in pocket,,,,, life is good and K@C is 3rd|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dinkin leads other match by 8     one table finished, i think, the other bidding 89|pg||
nt|onebid: had an eye exam and eyes were dilated|pg||
nt|onebid: 8 is really close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh   96 boards, not 90|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and they have 8 boards left to compare|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think i had some of judy's eye drops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's my story -- and i'm sticking to it|pg||

nt|daman: mancuso now up by 2|pg||
nt|onebid: It is true that many play extremely weak 2's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Australia/New Zealand, more an issue of hyperactive 3level preempts|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: of course for many of them 2@S would be 2-suiter|pg||

nt|ahollan1: quite a set for only 3 real swings|pg||
nt|mariner1: one issue I often see is teams play something that is popular in their area and so|pg||
nt|mariner1: it often is just a push, then they get into outside competition and it is hari kari.....|pg||
nt|mariner1: self destruction|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: Moss actually had a big chance to rally|pg||
