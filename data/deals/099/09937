pc|h2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|beto: i think he has a residence in there|pg||

pc|hA|nt|beto: nice stop although 4@S looks good in this bidding seeing only NS cards|pg||
nt|duschek: There are those who would have bid a direct 4@S holding South's cards, but perhaps the strong hearts persuaded him to be cautious|pg||
