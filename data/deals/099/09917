mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|an|transfer|nt|pamela: north should find a bid here   if south does not get in way...or it might make it easier for N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C garbage ?   nope -- just play 6 card suit|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: this is 2nd time to day that responder has just guessed to transfer with both majors -- and both times found partner with most support for long suit|pg||

nt|mariner1:  and E has a good hand for 4 @H|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes lots of time though....... 4 more sessions|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wow  Notes say 1@D-1Major could be 3 -- no mention that 1@S = 5+|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&task=list&event=12  -  Convention|pg||
nt|mariner1: Cards (click on Players names to see system cards)|pg||
mb|4D|an|rkc 4h 0-3|mb|p|nt|sssvablue: this should be a routine hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: there are not full cards for some players|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to further confuse me -- Convention Card says "Xfers after 2N rebid by opener"|pg||
mb|4H|an|murky here|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|sssvablue: This probably differentiates strength of spade hands|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: so 3@H was a transfer back to her own suit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sssvablue: Yes showing slam interest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D great contract, but has Lewis even hinted she holds 4??|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Margie says murky here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
nt|sssvablue: is that murky with or without a z?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: zzz|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|s5|pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||

nt|ahollan1: seems @SAK then when bad split - try @H finesse to get rid of 3rd @C|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can make 4@H I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if trump 32 with Q not dropping -- just run @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: @c position might cause an issue since E has Kxxx @H|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|4S|nt|mariner1: 4@S should be off......|pg||
nt|mariner1: can they DBL here?|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Neither would like to bid on, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: depending upon position of the mood -- i absolutely agree with 1@S -- or i absolutely disagree with 1@S ..... except for the times when i'm just not sure|pg||
