nt|granguru: bridge Club in chile:Club Snatiago)|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|othered1: Admitted, here north has implied some length in pointed suits|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|granguru: The tie was in Montevideo and Punta del Este in 1964|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|granguru: If my memory does not fail me they were Roberto Asriel Jorge Guzman esteban Casian Roberto Kaufman and Eric Simons|pg||

nt|fabsayc: not much chance that will work|pg||
nt|duschek: Except West still has a heart, sorry|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||

nt|sssvablue: a little saving grace here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes but even if your overtake is not 100% clear|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Why signal for a switch, when you can overtake and do it yourself .... build a fence around partner|pg||
pc|h6|nt|benjent: A diamond switch could have been horrible of course - we have the benefit of seeing South's hand|pg||

mc|11|nt|mariner1: so Selatan ends on a high note|pg||
nt|sssvablue: The point is that if you signal for a diamond switch, it is better to lead them yourself ... move the a@d to clubs and it would be essential|pg||
