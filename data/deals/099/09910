mb|p|nt|vugraphzja: se incia la ultima ronda de la final.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mollerjep: en dejlig abningshånd i nord, ikke sandt hr. Werge :-)|pg||
nt|iain sime: 15/17|pg||
nt|paulg: would you open Lucas 2@h with Cuthbertson's hand, or is it too playable in spades?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|werge: Til de knap så rutinerede: Når man åbner på Nords hånd, skal man regne med at komme for højt ganske ofte|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  it was better than the previous Lucas 2@H that McGinley came up with earlier|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|iain sime: I guess that is why he didn't.|pg||
nt|capercliff: too good for a lucas 2 no?|pg||
nt|paulg: it would have caused a more interesting auction for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznn: hi all|pg||
nt|paulg: Maiolani clawed some imps back in the last set, but still a big deficit|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|werge: Glimrende indslag af Vest|pg||
nt|mollerjep: og den får hvad den fortjener|pg||
nt|capercliff: is everyone opening with 5-4 these days?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ebrok: Der strammes helt igennem!|pg||
nt|pkl: God dobling, ja.|pg||
nt|werge: Med @C-udspillet ligner det tre stik til Vest - og en skævt fordelt trumffarve|pg||
nt|werge: Det er ikke rart at lade @C 10 løbe...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Rafa: Estas son las ultimas 16 manos de la final de equipos libres|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ebrok: kl 10 kom efter nogen pause|pg||

nt|werge: - så er beten sikker|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|werge: - en såkaldt klassisk situation|pg||
nt|iain sime: 5/5 vulnerable but 5/4 not is popular.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h9|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hT|nt|boltonian2:  but go back to board 14 to see what is acceptable|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|capercliff: must admit though id be more inclined to open McGinley 2@h than this one|pg||

nt|boltonian2:  some action here maybe|pg||
nt|capercliff: how any @d over 1@s?|pg||
nt|capercliff: many*, 2 is normal I gues|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  just the two I think|pg||
nt|iain sime: Double?|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  might double to think of the alternative|pg||
nt|capercliff: the 4@h's makes t awkward|pg||
nt|paulg: just a simple overcall, don't want to lose the opportunity to get hearts into the game or show power later|pg||
nt|paulg: N-S's efforts have prevented a good slam being bid here|pg||
nt|paulg: although the same may happen in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg: hi Alex|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  good afternoon|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: ok, that changes it.|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  the question remains redundant|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  i missed a board, EW missed a slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|capercliff: I would not open this 2@c|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  might make it more difficult for EW to realise that diamonds are going to be the problem for 6@H though|pg||
nt|jackth: el acuerdo perfecto para esta mano en la otra mesa|pg||
mb|d|nt|werge: Den spærrer godt, sådan en 1 @C|pg||
nt|capercliff: would anyone here pen 2@c?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|iain sime: Dave Walker passed 2C in the hope of being on lead v. 3NT.|pg||

nt|werge: Der ser ud til at være samme forskel i de to semifinaler - med Konow i spidsen i den anden|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: hvad med en dobling?|pg||
nt|werge: Fra hvem?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: jeg ved godt den ikke er køn, men... (fra Peter)|pg||
nt|werge: Har du arvet?|pg||
nt|pkl: Den eneste, der kunne doble var Nord. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: nej|pg||
nt|ebrok: med 2hj.? Så hellere 1 sp|pg||
nt|werge: Nords dobling ville være ret risikabel|pg||
nt|werge: Makker melder altid den farve, vi ikke har|pg||
nt|ebrok: Enig igen|pg||
nt|Rafa: El equipo chileno empató el 1er. lugar con Brasil en el Festival Sudamericano en Lima el año pasado|pg||
pc|d4|nt|boltonian2:  this is by no means certain|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  done well to reach this game, but it is going to be a difficult make|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|Rafa: Chile no ha ganado un torneo sudamericano oficial desde aprox. 1950|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|vugraphzpd: 2 gange på en dag :-)|pg||
nt|pkl: Jeg ville kunne forstå en dobling fra Dorthe, men pas er den sympatisk melding|pg||
nt|ebrok: nu kan han vinde, og bør vinde !!|pg||
nt|iain sime: Well stopped; the trump break sinks 5H.|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, it's not an obvious game to bid and (it may be) unlucky to find the 4-1 trump break|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg: the @cK lead asks for upside count|pg||
nt|ybob: Hola a todos :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|boltonian2:  that might have been the best play|pg||
nt|paulg: diamond or @c3|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|iain sime: Yes, a third round of diamonds may be the best shot.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|werge: Har man overhovedet lov at brudge åbningen 1 C som spærremelding?|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @C|pg||
pc|hK|nt|boltonian2:  it was the diamond ony my screen, but this could be good too|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ebrok: det ligner 5 Imp til Schou|pg||
nt|capercliff: could e some communication problems after the @h break is found|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pkl: 1@C var ganske effektiv som spær i gamle dage ;-)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulg: i think a trump back would have been better, but McGeorge will not be confident of the spade situation|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|boltonian2:  ruff this and play a @D?|pg||
nt|capercliff: cant make it from this point I think|pg||
nt|paulg: ruff and anything except a trump?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hello again|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|iain sime: Yes.|pg||
nt|capercliff: interesting hand, I think the best play was to duck a @s right away|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bridge_one: second hand of 3th session|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|boltonian2:  a further two tricks coming for NS at least|pg||
nt|paulg: but going 3 down now|pg||

nt|capercliff: yes very good defence|pg||

nt|Rafa: En directo desde Santiago de Chile, la final de equipos libres del 59º Torneo Sudamericano de Bridge|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: weak @S + minor - muideberg style|pg||
mb|p|nt|pkl: 12 stik, tror jeg|pg||
nt|iain sime: We don't have communication to the other room, but I can tell you that Steel won 4 on 1 and 10 on 2, so leads 14-0.|pg||
nt|Rafa: hola Roberto|pg||
nt|jackth: 4@s Pepe|pg||
mb|p|nt|boltonian2:  part score battle now, EW good for|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  3@S|pg||
nt|paulg: i like to be able to bid clubs over a short 1@c|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  at this vul I imagine Cuthbertson will come in at some point later|pg||
nt|capercliff: unless they bid lots of @s first|pg||
nt|paulg: sure, but an immediate 3@c would probably have scooped the pot|pg||
nt|iain sime: EW scored 300 in the other room.|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  though if McGinley bids a @S they will be in four before that can happen|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  maybe W will only bid 3|pg||
nt|capercliff: I would imagine 3@c is not natural for some reason|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  an easy 4@S should steady things though|pg||
nt|paulg: another thin game that will probably fail|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  though, as you say, it is going off|pg||

pc|h6|nt|bridge_one: effective 2@s - E/W could play slam here|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|pkl: .... men 3 af tre er 12.5% ... vi har vist alle været i dårligere slemmer|pg||
nt|capercliff: hmm|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  hmm, not where we imagined this auction would end up|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is interesting indeed|pg||
nt|iain sime: playing equal level conversion, 2D does not show extras.|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  no, though I think I would still have gone for 3@C with the N hand|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  ok, on the plus side we now have communication with the other room|pg||
nt|iain sime: We seem to have established a link with the other room, so should get comparisons.|pg||
nt|paulg: Howie-McGinley are a conservative pair and so far this has not been working to their advantage|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|paulg: Walker is a passed hand|pg||
nt|capercliff: the N bid is what I was wondering about|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  me too, unless W thought 3NT might still be the intended spot|pg||
pc|c9|nt|paulg: i think most top players would respond 1@s on this hand for instance|pg||
nt|capercliff: how many brds per set?|pg||
nt|paulg: McGeorge shows three diamonds and mildy suggests a club switch|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|vugraphznn: 16|pg||

nt|Walddk2: No score entered on 3|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I was out of the room; when I returned they told me "making 6"|pg||
nt|brolucius: Must have risen with the ace, ditched a heart on the spades and drawn trumps. |pg||
nt|daro1950:  hi again every one hope techical prob straight now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: not exactly a classic weak 2 with 6-5|pg||
nt|henryb: just bid 4@s or investigate? I think it depends on weak 2 style|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: a quick claim... next board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but not recorded in MOVIE|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: My idea of a game try on the East hand is to bid game and let partner try to make it|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: should get to 4@H here easily enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it is, thx Jan|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Dinkin is the NPC of the Baker team|pg||
nt|kit: 2@C inverted -- apparently can have 4-card major.  Most pairs play it denies a major.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT will play OK, with the clubs 3-2, but 4@H is a better contract of course.|pg||
nt|lml: I think that Lynn decided ignore her major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&task=list&event=12  for team rosters and system cards|pg||
nt|lml: it was such an ugly suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: McCallum writing a note, 2@d usually natural but could be (now it's where I can't see rest)|pg||
nt|lml: I like to do that when I have slam oriented hands|pg||
nt|henryb: mine too|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: perhaps Linda|pg||
nt|kit: investigating won't tell whether the mesh is good or not|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: not so much on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, and if North held genuine clubs it could be important to announced the strong club support.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: ok we see Closed scores, so need Open :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|kit: The clubs are favorable, but the bad trump split will doom the contract it appears|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: well, it looks like they can have 4-card major in their style, as they have found the 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|lml: it works|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: McCallum note: 2@d usually natural - can be min. bal. planning to pass 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb: probably although I tink there are chances if the @dA is not cashed now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: 2@d was probably some kind of artificial waiting bid, looking for further description|pg||
nt|brolucius: Usual to bid stoppers (rather than suits) after a fit has been found in a minor suit.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: McCallum: "my clubs are really good"|pg||
nt|daro1950:  pretty light opener by Lewis|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|brolucius: West can expect discards to come eventually on the clubs so, quite rightly, she makes an attacking lead in one of the other side suits.|pg||
nt|henryb: fewer now|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|avivs: I'm surprised Lewis opened this hand... Margie style is very old fashioned... she only bids with full values|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: K-J-x-x is one of my favourite leads. I struggle to suppress a smile when I hear players say that they 'never lead away from kings'.|pg||
nt|lml: it doesnt matter but sometimes splitting her honors might work better|pg||
nt|kit: declarer worried about how best to handle a 4-1 trump split now|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|daro1950:  yes a flat 11 count doesnt have much going for it|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s3|pc|dT|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: they end is nigh|pg||
nt|ahollan1: System Summary form actually states "Linda opens lighter than Margie" :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|henryb: she had to cross ruff a few tricks to set up the @hJ, then the @sA and the @hJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Not a deal that will feature in tomorrow's bulletin.|pg||
pc|s7|mc|10|nt|daro1950:  guess I should read the notes then, actually might have been the only way to get to 4|pg||

nt|mariner1: 4 @H here seems normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some pairs can show weak/inv @S + @H hands over minor opener -- but EW just play weak jump shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: If that is so, I play a lot of good bridge.|pg||
nt|santyclz: This looks like fun.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: which one do you like best heart slam or spade slam... you don't need the heart finesse in spades but you may not need the spade break in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This event will decide which two teams will be representing USA in the Venice Cup (women's World Championships) in Brazil in late August/early September|pg||
nt|kit: this overcall may get a preemptive raise from Weinstein, which will make the slam more difficult to bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lynn Baker was punished for bidding twice with the West hand|pg||
nt|kit: hard to fault her for that|pg||
nt|chip: I don't blame her for doing so.|pg||
nt|daro1950:  Yes heart game is on, lets see how they bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Imagine if Palmer has 3@D weak available here|pg||
nt|henryb: might not choose it with those hearts|pg||
mb|4D!|an|hearts|mb|p|nt|daro1950:  texas makes it easy|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brolucius: Assuming they are not playing transfers after intervention, 1@H is better than a double now.|pg||
nt|kit: then they would get to defend 4@C doubled|pg||
nt|chip: may get the same auction here?|pg||
nt|kit: Double by North probably wouldn't have been for penalties|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@D Texas to @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: they found the fit|pg||
nt|lml: now can they find the slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: North must judge if she is worth 4@D.|pg||
nt|kit: Palmer may now try 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|avivs: Wittes hand is closer to an opener than Lewis on last hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the inferences on last hand included:  no PJS, no 2-way checkback  -- so Margie just saw hand as ok 1-suiter|pg||

nt|mariner1: leaderboard|pg||
nt|daro1950:  well Lewis did have 2 bullets|pg||
nt|mariner1: with @H 2 2 the play is easy|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: I like that bid and not because I am looking at both hands|pg||
nt|kit: good bid by McCallum -- shows better than a mere 4@S call|pg||
nt|brolucius: Three key cards in the hand, so worth an effort below game.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: she should pass now. 2@D showed her hand. Partner must have a stack of clubs|pg||
nt|chip: yes, partner might not always have 4 trump tricks for this. Still, South didn't promise defense.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: this bid gives partner a chance to look at her hand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|henryb: but maybe not quite that stack|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: but partner is doubling opposite what might be zero defensive tricks, so partner figures to really have it|pg||
nt|avivs: looks like they will lose a spade and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously EW notes say 1@C-1@D  and 1minor-1Major response can be 3 cards|pg||
nt|mariner1: no way for defense to stop a @D ruff|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: I am not giving up on the south hand now|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H is last train -- now, Baker has to decide if she is worth more|pg||
nt|lml: she can keycard or bid 5C I suppose|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not so clear that South will bid again.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spades are poor.|pg||
nt|kit: I think she should -- in fact, she can pretty well picture her partner having exactly what she has|pg||
nt|lml: I agree she should but will she?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: I think South should just take over and bid RKC -- finds out what she needs to know|pg||
nt|lml: :) wd|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kit: the hand with the source of tricks has to take control|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: what is 5@D?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: And a point to make on the lead. Deas does not want ruffs, so she leads from length. That's what is recommended if you have many *good* trumps|pg||
nt|kit: the trump end-play battle will soon begin|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many inexperienced players would lead the singleton diamond|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: same auction in Closed Room here|pg||
nt|mariner1: we have scores now and only 1 imp in 1st 3 boards,,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: to see results in other room CLICK  MOVIE on TOOLBAR and then OPEN or|pg||
nt|mariner1: CLOSED|pg||
nt|avivs: no need for a @d ruff - 4th diamond is a winner|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes did not see that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Margie doesn't see it, so is playing the hand single dummy|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: 0 or 3|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1430 responses.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: yes, 0 or 3|pg||
nt|kit: then why did South sign off?|pg||
nt|kit: unless she was afraid of 0, but that is impossible considering the 4@D call|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I can't ask her|pg||
nt|lml: some people play that when you have 3 you should bid on but surely not in this auction|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c4|nt|kit: I disagree -- when you have trump length you do want ruffs to avoid end-plays.  The K@S lead only correct since KQJ|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|brolucius: South's sign-off is hard to understand when all key-cards are present. She can hardly have meant it as a safety measure in case North held 0 key-cards because then North sould not ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: have cue-bid 4@D.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|lml: she can hope that the suits dont break|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|avivs: nice technique giving herself the extra chance for 10th trick in spades|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: so even Kit would lead @SK from that holding; that's my point|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|kit: perhaps North was expected to bid on if she had 3.  Not a treatment I like|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|kit: of course -- but with no jack of spades, I would have led a diamond|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: if you can't tell whether 0 or 3, you shouldn't have been bidding RKC in first place|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure that is what she meant but it makes not sense to give North that chance in this auction|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kit: Now declarer knows the whole story when Deas returned a spade rather than a red card|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h9|nt|avivs: will ruff a club and try for Hx in diamonds|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, she can't have 0 for two slam tries, so Baker should have bid the slam herself|pg||
pc|d8|nt|brolucius: South could also have passed. On the other hand, North can hardly think that South was intending to bid the slam only if North had FOUR or more key cards, so I think she should ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: have bid on anyway. |pg||
nt|lml: I agree even if you play those methods when you know what to do, do it|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: Reasonable flat board|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|hQ|pc|c8|pc|hT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there is a great out-of-print book called "The Extra Chance"   can't remember if Jannersten or Reese :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: similar line in Closed Room|pg||
pg||
qx|o38|st||md|4SJ943HKJ43D952C72,SAQ86H82DJTCT8543,S52HQ96DQ743CAK96,SKT7HAT75DAK86CQJ|sv|e|nt|brolucius: That will be a depressing bad board for North-South, whatever actually went wrong.|pg||
nt|lml: Thats a good point.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She could also have passed the double of 5@D to get a redouble (= 1st rd control) from McCallum|pg||
nt|kit: yes, and a shame after they had an excellently judged auction up to the end despite the interference|pg||
nt|lml: ITs almost like McCallum thought I have really stretched to make the 4@d cuebid and I am not going to bid again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Both West players were unlucky to find this layout|pg||
nt|henryb: In the other match the board was pushed in 3@d making|pg||
nt|kit: North sold out to 2@S in closed room -- losing bridge IMO with singleton spade|pg||
nt|kit: And a big loser on this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Cohen hadn't taken her hand out of this board, so the other table pushed the tray over for her to get it and she pushed it back because it wasn't her deal, then someone said she ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: needed her hand and she says "I might bid better without it :)"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Now discussion of how many tricks NW could make on the last hand :)|pg||
nt|avivs: Margie is a terific card player|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: We don't know what pass of the double would mean in their methods|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|lml: now good pairs get good results|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not a fan of walking the dog with the West cards here|pg||
nt|kit: The cute pass by West -- understandable with the balanced hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How often will the opponents get to NT?|pg||
nt|chip: not so rare to defend NT.|pg||
nt|kit: with partner a passed hand, likely either 2@S won't make or opponents can make something at 3-level anyway|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: after a mistake|pg||
nt|daro1950:  back to previous hand, next will be of interest|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this is less dramatic|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: McCallum had no real reason to bid more -- she was quite minimal for her previous bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: South must have upgraded to a 15-17 2NT.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So you wouyld rather get in with 3@S now?|pg||
nt|kit: expecting diamond shortness in her partner's hand|pg||
nt|chip: I think 1N was 14-16, (and normal even if off-shape in their strong club system), 2N=D, and 3D = don't like?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lml: there notrump range is 14+-17|pg||
nt|kit: surprising here that McCallum doesn't have a better approach than the bludgeoning 4NT invite with 5-4 in minors|pg||
nt|lml: I dont see this as a 14+ myself|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 4NT was a bit of a stretch and I expect she is pleased that partner passed.|pg||
nt|kit: I wouldn't exactly call the 4-3-3-3 South hand "+"|pg||
nt|avivs: will make many tricks after this lead|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|kit: Well, she did get a plus score out of nowhere, so hard to argue with her actions|pg||
nt|chip: just another flat board.|pg||
nt|henryb: Given 5@d I think 3@d was I"I Like"|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Henry|pg||
nt|avivs: defense can get 2 hearts and 2 clubs if they switch to hearts on time|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb: still N-S will gain 2 imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: West will shift to a heart, and even Palmer won't take too long to play this one|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: on the lie of the cards they are going to make a fair number of tricks|pg||
nt|kit: jack of spade suit-pref|pg||
nt|henryb: -50 in this room, +110 in the other|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kit: or so I thought|pg||
nt|daro1950:  the heart seems clear enough|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lml: I think it is 14-|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is a temptation to 'try something' on the board after you have had a likely adverse swing. |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|kit: lucky for defense that hearts aren't KQ with East and AJ with South|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Deas had put her diamonds down with the 3 & 2 reversed, so when Palmer gestured at diamonds on this trick, she actually played the 3, then pointed out that we had "a multi-colored ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: wish trick"|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|lml: so despite their efforts they got a flattish board which should calm them down|pg||
nt|lml: Baker and McCallum have had quite a workout so far|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Declarer said"I'm in my hand|pg||
nt|lml: I always like to "get the cards"|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would have been remarkable to bid this slam and not the previous one. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are losing two other rooms on a regular basis I am afraid, so please be patient as far as comparisons are concerned|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: and led a heart to the K - everyone agreed she was in her hand - don't know why. Anyway, will now claim|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|dJ|mc|9|nt|mariner1: and the Scourge of Scotland Falls and the beer card not enough|pg||
nt|daro1950:  looking forward to next board since we got a preview need some excitement|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry, I lost the play there, doing too many things at once|pg||
pg||
qx|o39|st||md|1SK64HA842D742CAJ2,SAT8HKJ9653DTCT63,S2HT7DAKJ98653C74,SQJ9753HQDQCKQ985|sv|b|nt|chip: note that Ew found the defense to beat 5C: tap the N hand.|pg||
nt|daro1950:  might get some action here|pg||
nt|mariner1: could see some action here|pg||
nt|daro1950:  no problem|pg||
nt|daro1950:  Here we go|pg||
nt|mariner1: now 3N NS or 4@S EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: timing would be key in 4@S|pg||
mb|1C|nt|avivs: my guess is 5@d-1 by NS|pg||
mb|2H|nt|daro1950:  I expect that S opens and we get a heart preempt North will have tough call|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Aha|pg||
nt|kit: light overcall, for sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: E alerted 2@d - no questions have been asked|pg||
nt|kit: now East has a problem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One would have thought that they had discussed what 2@D shows over a Precision 1@D|pg||
nt|kit: is 2@H forcing?|pg||
nt|kit: What does one do with no suit to Q-bid?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why an alert if it's natural?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Doubt e thinks it's Michaels...|pg||
nt|chip: natural is an alert here.|pg||
nt|kit: I'm pretty sure they know what 2@D is -- that's not the problem|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't alert bids|pg||
nt|Walddk2: natural bids|pg||
nt|kit: with screens, you alert anything that moves|pg||
nt|chip: in acbl you do if normally not natural (e.g. 1H-DBL= penalty is an alert)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: you are not allowed to alert any doubles any more, at least on this side of the pond|pg||
nt|henryb: I believe, Roland, that "natural" cue bids are alertable in ACBL-land|pg||
nt|kit: how can you be forbidden to alert doubles when there are screens?|pg||
nt|chip: in acbl few are alerts, but very unusual ones are.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: anyone bid on the east hand?|pg||
nt|3for3: 3nt will end this auction.....I think|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: No!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 1@S by South, then probably 1NT by North ending it|pg||
nt|daro1950:  well so much for the fireworks|pg||
nt|avivs: preempting with good support for both unbid suits is not a good idea|pg||
nt|mariner1: in the other match Sanborn/Lavitina pulled 4@S to 5@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: there was no DBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: Levintina|pg||
nt|daro1950:  2H bid certainly changed the complexion of the hand from Easts perspective|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Obviously she didn't think it was Michaels|pg||
nt|chip: guess pollack had no sensible way to bid her hand safely.|pg||
nt|kit: She will not be happy if a club is led, but the will be saved|pg||
nt|chip: actually 3N maybe about as good as 4H.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Deas asks Cohen: "what's 2@d?" Cohen: "I think it's natural; we didn't discuss it" Then Palmer asks Pollack and she also says it's natural|pg||
nt|kit: So, how does one make a Q-bid on this auction when there is nothing to Q-bid?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess in ACBL-land Michaels is not alertable, so 2@D natural is. Upside-down thinking in my book|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@C would be a borderline effort at matchpoints. Quite awful, as I see it, vulnerable at IMPs.|pg||
nt|chip: well, nice to have what 95% play be no alert, and have the unusual bid be an alert. that was the original intent after all|pg||
nt|santyclz: My mother would have led a @c.|pg||
nt|kit: My preference is that after a natural overcall of their nebulous suit, a bid of the other minor is the Q-bid|pg||
nt|chip: yes, useful method to play (and what i play also)|pg||
nt|henryb: any two-suited cue is not alertable; in fact in general cue bids are not alertable, but when a bid has a normal "conventional" meaning, an unexpectable natural one is alertable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: David - i was just going to ask what people think of the 2@H bid |pg||
nt|3for3: good pass by wittes|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Dinkin - Glasson match W only bid 1@H which made it easier for E to get the @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: suit it|pg||
nt|avivs: 10 easy tricks|pg||
nt|3for3: play will be quick|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|kit: If South take a push here, they will get to 3NT which I don't think will make|pg||
nt|lml: I would bid NV |pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: some people like to lead a club honor from a long suit like that|pg||
nt|kit: I would have bid 2@C on East hand, even vulnerable.  Seldom gets doubled even if you are in trouble|pg||
nt|kit: however, vs. precision diamond, it is maybe 50-50 whether people play natural or michaels|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it may have actually helped NS find 3N|pg||
nt|avivs: now 11 easy tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my vote is 1@H also -- this is not just an offensively oriented single suiter|pg||
nt|daro1950:  I agree that 2H is touchy with 3 sp and 3 cl on this hand, but it does seem to be the modern style, may well have done it myself|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Closed Room here is down temporarily so will be a bit before we see that|pg||
nt|mariner1: result|pg||
nt|3for3: EW do well in spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I'm told the two tables are not linked here - I think that the other table must have been disconnected and then restarted wrong. Simplest way for me to correct is to close and ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: reopen here, so I will do that now, since you are saying play not interesting.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think style is coming back around -- so preempt has suit integrity and 1-level covers broader scope|pg||
nt|3for3: will probably push the opponents to 5@D if they get there|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Other table just restarted and he says he joined, so should be linked, so I will stay here and claim in a moment|pg||
mc|11|nt|brolucius: Yes, but low is better because you may want partner to have a club left when she gains the lead.|pg||
nt|lml: so one NO! one no and one yes|pg||
pg||
