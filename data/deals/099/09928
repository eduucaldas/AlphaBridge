mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|brolucius: 3NT is not so easy to beat.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: South has bid it, despite holding only one ace.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulhac: 4H looks like the only possible game contract|pg||
nt|robinswr: NOt sure that's right with no aces|pg||
nt|brolucius: With so many aces missing, a spade lead will beat it easily.|pg||
nt|paulhac: If you knock out the A@C 4@H looks unbeatable but difficult to get to|pg||
nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Danny|pg||
nt|kit: hi Danny|pg||
nt|jstokes: Hey Danny|pg||
nt|paulhac: Hi Danny|pg||
nt|brolucius: If South had opened 1@H (playing four-card majors), they might have stumbled into it.|pg||
nt|robinswr: danny are you rooting for anyone here?|pg||
nt|3for3: not going to see that this side of the atlantic|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Danny may be emotionally involved, but he has promised not to show it|pg||
nt|3for3: I can try :)|pg||
nt|kit: The 3NT call does appear a bit optimistic -- even if North has Qxxxx of diamonds and an ace, which is a max, that is still only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|paulhac: Good hand for 4 card major players|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H is better, but not particularly good. Might hit a diamond ruff.|pg||
nt|kit: Would you really prefer to be in 4@H vs. a 4@D looking at just the N-S hands?|pg||
nt|brolucius: I expect West will (eventually) lead a spade.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|robinswr: Ace of spades just in case there's a stiff king|pg||

pc|d6|pc|h2|pc|dQ|nt|paulhac: I agree 4@D is considerably a better contract but......|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer might have held K-10-x.|pg||
nt|kit: the low spade lead could be right, but I think a higher one is percentage|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h3|nt|robinswr: like the ace|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c6|pg||

nt|brolucius: North has to choose between Double and 2@S. Double looks better.|pg||
nt|robinswr: pass here should say I would have passed 2clubs doubled|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D now from South|pg||
nt|brolucius: While she has the chance.|pg||
nt|kit: On this sort of auction, if South passes it should be a penalty pass of the redouble|pg||
nt|kit: this is very important for partnerships to get sorted out|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sprung asking about something (RDBL?) and Berkowitz writing - can't see, sorry|pg||
nt|kit: what else can the redouble show but a good hand (not clear she has it)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She has a decent suit|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but if it South does have a penalty pass she will be a bit nervous|pg||
nt|brolucius: She has a good hand, yes. I was agreeing that the meaning of redouble was clear. |pg||
nt|kit: don't get me wrong -- I like the redouble -- but there is risk|pg||
nt|robinswr: hard to have a penalty pass holding AKQJ98|pg||
nt|kit: of course, if it catches the opponents in a mixup, that is a possible gain -- and I have seen that happen|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|kit: Now, is Goldberg worth an invite?  I think so -- she could be a lot weaker for the reopening|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3 or 4 is the question|pg||
nt|3for3: 3 seems right|pg||
nt|3for3: JoAnn is not shy|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4 is way too much, as I see it.|pg||
nt|kit: 4 is not needed -- if partner passes 3, that will be well high enough|pg||
nt|paulhac: If she invites should South bid 4?|pg||
nt|kit: good lord no|pg||
nt|robinswr: with a stiff club, 4 would be right|pg||
nt|kit: remember, my equation ...|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kit: no aces + no kings + no singletons + no voids = no bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Glasson asks about 3@s and Goldberg shrugs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and three small clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: not to mention 4333|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: What is there to ask about 3@S?!|pg||
nt|kit: just making noise|pg||
nt|paulhac: 4@S is difficult to beat does it not need a heart lead?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: one should reject an invite only if you think you might be too high already -- and South definitely thinks that|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|3for3: a@C sp for @H's|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|3for3: as if west needs to know that....|pg||
nt|robinswr: better to win the 8 and then play the Ace|pg||
nt|rcm: West should ruff with 9|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might have risked a heart switch, hoping that West held the @HQ, since hearts are likely to vanish on the diamonds. |pg||
pc|dT|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: that might be defense vs. 4@S David, vs. 3@S I think East hopes diamonds not running|pg||
pc|hA|nt|robinswr: when you win the 8 of clubs, all the rest of the clubs are suit preferance|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Goldberg-Sprung discussing what bids over RDBL would be|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some players lead low from the club holding that North has here (against NT).|pg||
nt|jstokes: and, hopefully, what no bid over XX would be|pg||
nt|brolucius: It can work well to lead low when partner has a doubleton high card.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: They just put board 35 on the tray instead of 37 and Glasson said "we're going to play it in 1@d this hand" Berkowitz: "no, I know how to make it now (3N)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Many thanks to Jan, who always gives us some amusing tit-bits from the table-side.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|paulhac: Good result for E/W in the other room|pg||
nt|3for3: yes, very|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: Low club was not a successful lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3: heart shift at trick 2 best?  hard to find|pg||
nt|kit: low club lead looks like an unnecessary position here |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Vugraphu1: Berkowitz asks about the lead: "King or shortness"|pg||
nt|3for3: woolsey leads....|pg||
nt|kit: Assuming this is ducked, the king of clubs continuation will shut out the 10 of spades|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|3for3: I believe Kit popularized them in a Bridge Today article|pg||
nt|kit: this lead is Rusinow -- it is not asking for drop of jack|pg||
nt|brolucius: West plays the @C9, hoping to mislead North. Many players use count signals to expose such deception.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/RGlossary/RusinowLeads.html|pg||
nt|3for3: hard to give count with 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Berkowitz asks about carding - Upside Down|pg||
nt|robinswr: the lead of the Q is from the King when you have at least four. With three or fewer it is top|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strange question when she is looking at the jack |pg||
nt|3for3: No, they play Q from KQx as well|pg||
nt|kit: why is it strange question -- declarer always entitled to know opponents carding|pg||
nt|jstokes: and count might be relevant|pg||
nt|robinswr: so from QJ10 you lead the queen and when the king shows up partner and declarer knows that you are leading a short suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's strange because it is not relevant to her here|pg||
nt|kit: declarer should always ask, regardless of holding in suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I disagree unless you do it all the time|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wouldn't like to have to explain that to a director.|pg||
nt|robinswr: its always better to ask before dummy comes down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I do not believe that she does|pg||
nt|kit: that doesn't matter Roland -- if you did that, then it would automatically give info to opponents when you do ask|pg||
nt|3for3: in a 16 board set, I like to ask before board 1....ends all of those problems|pg||
nt|Walddk2: FWIW, I think it's misleading to ask with such a holding|pg||
nt|robinswr: and always ask as soon as you see the lead |pg||
nt|brolucius: As Roland said, a low club was led at the other table.|pg||
nt|kit: well, we will have to agree to disagree then|pg||
nt|kit: not the first or last time, I'm sure -- after all, we are bridge players|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: She asked Sprung, not Goldberg - NE and SW on same side of screen. She whispered so Goldberg isn't aware that she asked|pg||
nt|robinswr: if you ask before seeing dummy then there can't be misleading|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don;t think you should ask 'Can it be from Q-J-x?' when you are looking at the jack. I agree with Roland.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: For those who weren't here for earlier segments, Goldberg is often very slow and Sprung is "not a speed demon"|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|kit: you shouldn't ask a specific question like that, I agree -- but surely a general question about the lead methods|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did ahe not do it before they started then? Or had a look at their CC?|pg||
nt|brolucius: South sensibly does not waste her queen.|pg||
nt|robinswr: general questions about leads are expected|pg||
nt|kit: This shift is okay for now I believe |pg||
nt|3for3: declarer was always entitled to 5 black suit winners,one way or another|pg||
nt|kit: right -- and now declarer has to play something|pg||
nt|paulhac: Difficult to see where 9 tricks are coming from|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: still, I think that on balance North was better continuing with king of clubs -- but that would be difficult to prove|pg||
nt|brolucius: My spy in the Closed Room tells me that the defense was not so brilliant, even after the low club lead. That is why the contract was made.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If the CC reads udca, what is there to ask about. I think the question was asked at an unfortunate time, in a situation where declarer wanted North to continue clubs. I am not ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: saying she did that intentionally, but I claim that it was the wrong time to ask|pg||
nt|kit: wasn't a question about carding -- was about leads|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, she asked about carding and was told udca|pg||
nt|3for3: I agree with Roland here...poor idea to ask at that time|pg||
nt|kit: and the convention card doesn't leave room to distinguish between lead from QJx and QJxx|pg||
pc|h7|nt|brolucius: This hand is being played as if it were a chess match. |pg||
nt|3for3: there was a committee in houston where someone lost a board for similar action|pg||
nt|kit: declarer praying for some kind of rain --maybe KQx of hearts |pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|c4|nt|3for3: this puts some pressure on north now|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kit: did South really overtake the 9?  That seems very strange, to say the least|pg||
nt|paulhac: Looks as though this can now make|pg||
nt|robinswr: the heart spots are coming into play|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|kit: Now North is in trouble -- first got squeezed on the third round of spades, and now may get endplayed in addition|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the Closed Room, North switched to the @DQ to give the contract near the end.|pg||
nt|3for3: this line appears legit though|pg||
nt|kit: this illustrates why i thought North should have continued with king of clubs at trick 2.  Even if it blows a club trick, it kills the dummy and gives her safe exits later on|pg||
nt|paulhac: Declarer might be tempted to finesse the hearts if North exits with a club|pg||
nt|kit: declarer won't finesse the heart -- no way South would have overtaken with KQ of hearts|pg||
nt|3for3: declarer can then has 8 winners, and can endplay north to lead from the diamond queen, I think|pg||
nt|kit: yes, easily.  This was not best defense at all.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|d5|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|kit: declarer has to read the position, but from North's club discard it should be clear that North was under extreme pressure|pg||
nt|robinswr: very easy to defend when you are looking at all 52 cards|pg||
nt|kit: but she got first part wrong|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|3for3: i still think best play leads to a make for EW|pg||
nt|kit: het she can recover -- two rounds of diamonds, then jack of hearts|pg||
nt|3for3: she is down, now it seems|pg||
nt|kit: now, however, defense prevails unless something silly happens -- which it won't|pg||

nt|Walddk2: They are on board 40 next door|pg||
nt|kit: no kidding -- not only did she overtake, but then she squeezed her partner|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: No point overtaking to clear the spades because there was no entry for the established spades.|pg||
mb|d|nt|robinswr: not sure why you need a t/o double here|pg||
nt|kit: double is obviously takeout -- can be played either way|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not all pairs (by any means) would have an understanding as to what such a double means.|pg||
nt|3for3: takeout sure comes up more often|pg||
nt|jstokes: takeout after a major opening, for sure; either way here to me|pg||
nt|kit: but do you really need a takeout double when partner has denied majors?|pg||
nt|robinswr: if partner denies a 4-card major why do you need a t/o double|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kit makes a good point.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is penalty in my world, but I am not playing|pg||
nt|robinswr: if they bid 2spades and you have another ace, wouldn't you like to double it for penalties|pg||
nt|brolucius: South will raise the hearts, which will help E-W if West is not sure about the double.|pg||
nt|3for3: can't have another ace|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sprung & Berkowitz writing notes - I think Sprung had missed the 1@d opening and said that 2@h was hearts + minor. Now straightened out|pg||
nt|3for3: they play a big @C|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2nt would be for takeout|pg||
nt|robinswr: so would 2spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Once Sprung told Berkowitz that 2@h was natural, Berkowitz wrote t/o for DBL, and looked fairly certain, but not 100%|pg||
nt|3for3: no steve...2@S is natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3: not everyone denies a 5 card major like you|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree Danny, 2@S should show 5-6|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever of South to pass on the second round, in case West was about to misunderstand the double. She will bid now. |pg||
nt|kit: South might well have raised immediately|pg||
nt|robinswr: they are in her 5-card suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sprung is calling the director - I don't know why|pg||
nt|kit: not so clever -- gives opponents chance to find their best fit|pg||
nt|robinswr: maybe berk didn't alert her|pg||
nt|3for3: north and east on same side of screen|pg||
nt|kit: she may be claiming that she would have bid 3@H immediately if double clearly explained as takeout?|pg||
nt|3for3: and director in the room...so not so far away|pg||
nt|brolucius: West felt free to bid 2@S because she has already denied a four-card spade suit. If East did not hold four spades herself, she would move elsewhere.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sprung and Berkowitz and the director have gone out of the room to discuss. Goldberg is smoking. Glasson & I took turns going to the restroom (we have a bathroom in the playing ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: room). I still don't know what Sprung is discussing with the directors. But they're now coming back|pg||
nt|kit: yes, the 2@S call might well be least of evils|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bathroom in the playing room. That is something new.|pg||
nt|jstokes: the must both be aware of the possibility of a club fit onthis auction|pg||
nt|3for3: not for american trials|pg||
nt|paulhac: The 2@S call suggests 4-3 in the minors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The winning team after 96 boards will be USA2 in the Venice Cup (women's World Championships) in Brazil in late August/early September. Team Dinkin are USA1 after defeating Mancuso ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: in a very exciting final|pg||
nt|3for3: they use either hotel rooms, or small conference rooms|pg||
nt|jstokes: how far do they have to go to smoke?|pg||
nt|3for3: here it is a small conference room...in white plains next week will be actual hotel rooms for knockouts|pg||
nt|3for3: there is a balcony on every room here|pg||
nt|3for3: so smoking very easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are in Sacramento, California|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Now everyone is back at the table & sprung is thinking|pg||
nt|brolucius: We have not mentioned that there is play for 4@H.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not, they are|pg||
nt|brolucius: I suppose declarer in hearts is likely to misguess the diamond queen.|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@H has play, but needs several good things|pg||
nt|kit: can scoop the whole heart suit -- and on the bidding, probably should|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sprung has now taken the director away from the table again.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Danny, watch out!|pg||
nt|kit: so can even afford to misguess diamonds|pg||
nt|3for3: I doubt they will come close to bidding game here|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Stayman is perfectly normal (for good reasons).|pg||
mb|3D|nt|paulhac:  Stayman looks reasonable to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: sprung shows worries about diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: only problem is that Sout has to make the unilateral decision between 4@S and 3NT, when North's hand may have 4 spades but be very notrumpish|pg||
nt|jstokes: good thing they have the J and T of diamonds, or expressing worry could be costly|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Goldberg confirms with Glasson that 2@d was natural|pg||

mb|1H|nt|paulg: Unfortunately I do not have one for Howie and McGinley|pg||
nt|capercliff: im assuming this is a weak 2?|pg||
nt|paulg: i think it's hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  think it will be a lucas two|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  although i doubt it is really either to be honest|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3H|nt|mcarroll: But difficult to bid|pg||
nt|capercliff: indeed, 2@s non-forcing |pg||
nt|vugraphznn: should be compulsory to raise with support...|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|boltonian2:  tough one to bid, but 4@S does make, with a raise W would have gone on|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Good morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: I prefer 2N to 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ebrok: Gad vide, hvad 4 sp ville have vist?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass by North at 1@S isn't natural|pg||

pc|h4|nt|paulg: this looks like a chance of a swing|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: rigth 3Nt|pg||
nt|paulg: 3NT will make reasonably comfortably and 4@h looks to go down|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  yes, 4@S looks to have 4 possible losers|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  4@H that was|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South  could bid his @C, but with 2Aces and bad @c can pass ...|pg||
nt|paulg: Walker may need to upgrade to a strong 1NT with the East hand to flatten the board|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  might well do|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fcarioca: The problema on S not bidding @c is on N now....|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|iain sime: Good morning all.|pg||
nt|jackth: wow... salida poco afortunada|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bridge_one: but also 3@H would give at South the chance to read the hand and take with A in @H to play @C|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb: Needs to shift to a @s now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpq: gabino alujas thinking|pg||
pc|h3|nt|boltonian2:  yes well spotted|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  John Matheson, kibitzing, correctly pointed out that declarer should have ducked the @D9|pg||
nt|paulg: of course he's now going down in 3NT so it probably doesn't matter|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a present by each line in this hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fcarioca: wow|pg||
nt|bridge_one: another present - may be now declarer would find the right way to make the contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K in @D and Q in @S in the dummy are sufficient to ruff a @H and discard a @C over the K in @H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q in @D can't be played from QJ ...|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Lets be fair with Gabriele: How can he imagine N with 7 @H and S with 7 @C, and none bid.... |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  good morning|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|henryb: good play by S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bridge_one: to win West must make all tricks in @D or discard a @C - so or QJ doubleton in @D, or Ax in @H in South|pg||
pc|c4|nt|henryb: suit preference for @s|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bridge_one: but also @c win the same bec no way to make k IN @C in the dummy|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|jstokes: have to bid over even semi-forcing NT, don't you think|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|kit: they play semi-forcing -- presumably Sout felt her hand too strong to pass ...|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|brolucius: The reason South bid again was, I suppose, that North might have held an 11-count. Still, South's points were not well disposed and I think a Pass would have been OK on her hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have had many interesting discussions among commentators in this segment|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: My criterion of when to pass with 5-3-3-2 is:  I will pass if I wouldn't accept a 3-card limit raise|pg||

nt|bridge_one: the problem to play a elimination is that opps can keep 3 tricks before !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so need a mistake to work|pg||
nt|mowen: hi Iain|pg||
nt|capercliff: this will fetch some action|pg||
nt|iain sime: Both pairs here play 15/17 NT, multi 2D and Lucas twos in the majors.|pg||

nt|boltonian2:  though depends how you play the spade suit|pg||
nt|Rafa: estmos esperando resultados de damas|pg||
nt|Rafa: no han terminado|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bridge_one: 2@C bal 20/22 is a idea of Giorgio Duboin|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@S is a regular contract here|pg||

nt|mowen: tricky on a @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: even if he is 6-4 in the majors, he might think about bidding again when playing 2/1|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Doping-test - intet mindre|pg||
nt|ebrok: N-S spiller nær-fjern, hvor 3 kl viser hj-farve og gamekrav|pg||
nt|bridge_one: giving a limit hand with raise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@d can be dangerous|pg||
nt|capercliff: and not sure it can make on a @d ead|pg||
nt|iain sime: Would be pushed to make slam on a diamond lead.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i don't know if 2@C is gazzilli, but i suppose is natural|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bridge_one: no gazzilli (2@H isn't contemplate in gazzilli with 2 cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so may be they play without a GF open, similar to Fantoni Nunes|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|capercliff: X just in case they play in a @c slam|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ybob: 3St = 3@H|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if it is a special gazzilli, then 3@S after 2@H need with Kx in @C and 10 hcp with QJx n @S|pg||
nt|ybob: E promete bal 24+ |pg||
pc|c7|nt|robinswr: 2diamonds could be Bart, and this sequence shows 9-10 points ( I play exactly two spades)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|iain sime: first round control.|pg||
nt|paulg: 4@h may be ambiguous here -- last train or cue bid or both|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  why are you more pushed on a @D lead? it is all on the @S play isn't it|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pg||
nt|werge: 5 @D spør´ vel efter trumf dame|pg||
nt|ebrok: sikkert|pg||
nt|paulg: but Walker has prime cards in clubs|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|capercliff: not sure it can be last train as @c have been bid naturally twice|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|werge: 1430 om 8 sekunder|pg||
nt|ybob: 5@D 3 kca, 5@S preg Q @H , 5Nt = no la tengo|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|ebrok: De fik lidt hjælp her , men var nok end i 6 hj alligevel|pg||
nt|capercliff: a @d lead kills an entry right away|pg||
pc|s4|nt|iain sime: 4NT was maybe not the right question. |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  not sure you need the entry|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  5 might actually be more difficult than 6 though|pg||
nt|paulg: hard for Walker to see 5-6 opposite|pg||
nt|mowen: is it reasonable to cash @SAK and play the same hand for 3@Ss and 3@Cs|pg||
nt|capercliff: Walker might take some time with this one|pg||
nt|paulg: Walker takes time on most hands ... I think Cuthbertson is the only fast player at the table|pg||
nt|capercliff: safety play must be to finesse @s twice anyway no?|pg||
nt|mowen: not so good if the finesse loses|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|henryb: If you have the West hand, or something similar, do not, I beg of you, bid 2@h. double! partner may have a penalty pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Stewe :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|capercliff: if it loses then you lose a @d and a @s?|pg||
nt|mowen: ok so he plans to hook the spade|pg||
nt|iain sime: Club switch now.|pg||
nt|mowen: low heart now?|pg||
nt|paulg: i guess ducking the diamond in case spades are 4-1 offside|pg||
nt|capercliff: a low @h would be sneaky, trying to force dummy somewhat|pg||
nt|mowen: will probably work though|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jstokes: thanks, David.  keep practicing those "shes"|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|an|4 card Major, longer minor|nt|brolucius: If the players had made only one error in two hours (like me), they would have a few more IMPs in their plus column!|pg||
nt|kit: 4-card major and longer minor I believe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit territory now -- what will North's DBL show when West bids 2@H transfer|pg||
nt|jstokes: a Kit invention, right?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's part of the Woolsey defence to 1NT; that is correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: would depend upon partnership agreement -- in general, doubles of artificial low-level calls show that suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Berkowitz wrote something, but it's not close enough for me to read it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we had long rambling discussion in the other room -- especially about South's 2nd bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Next session starts in 15 minutes, but there may be a slight delay.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I suspect we'll be close to on time next session|pg||
nt|pef: yes, some of us thought after 2h transfer and double then 2s by opener, that bidding only 3h by south was timid|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Starting it, I mean - when it will end is anyone's guess :)|pg||
nt|kit: of course, if West does transfer North will know that South's major is hearts|pg||
mb|2C|an|alerted by S|mb|d|nt|jstokes: to play in the minor|pg||
nt|brolucius: Presumably pass or correct for the minor.|pg||
nt|kit: 2@C is pass or correct|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H would have been to play in overcaller's major. Is that not so, Kit?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: North did not alert 2@c, but is now writing something, so I'm sure everyone agrees it asks for S's minor|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Now North may do the same in the majors!|pg||
mb|2H!|an|Pass or correct|nt|pef: has north shown any values yet?|pg||
nt|jstokes: just did now|pg||
nt|kit: North is now asking for major -- pass or correct -- having not hit a club suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: isn't it Pass/Correct IF south holds just 4M & 5+minor?   or do Sprung-Goldberg not include other hand types in DBL|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/system/woolsey.html|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: West had the chance to spring into life with 2@S, but she chose not to. |pg||
nt|kit: If Sprung happens not to have a major (just long diamonds, hoping to get away with it), she would now bid 3@D|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@d by advancer asks for the Major over the DBL - 2M says "my suit"|pg||
nt|brolucius: Away goes the club and declarer will make too many tricks.|pg||
nt|kit: I think West should just transfer right away -- what she would have done with no interference|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jstokes: way too many tricks -- and no IMPs for Glasson this session|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to all spectators for watching; hope you enjoyed the show. We will be back shortly with segment 4 of 6. Don't miss it!|pg||
nt|brolucius: You are right. I had not noticed that. |pg||
nt|kit: yes, 4@H does very well today -- but everything is on, and suits are splitting well, and the mesh is good.  On a different day, not so good.|pg||
