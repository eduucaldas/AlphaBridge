nt|bjurn: These two pairs play similar systems; strong club with 14-16 NT and nebulous 1@D opening. |pg||
nt|papa hall: This will be a battle of pace...EW fast as lightening and NS slower than paint drying|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: the strong club hasnt hit my part of the world yet|pg||
nt|haans: hi all (and Roland :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: Hi|pg||
nt|haans: berik leads frirond 5th chance for 3rd|pg||

nt|magnus_e: hi all|pg||
nt|diaoff: Hi Magnus|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|milton_se: hej Magnus|pg||

nt|vugraph815: I don't know if it's good, but thx anyway :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: not known for being shy :)|pg||
nt|diaoff: Now it will not end on the 2-level, which is maximum both ways|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bt: so this is completely natural|pg||
nt|bt: and east should cuebid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is that allowed these days?|pg||
nt|papa hall: Yes...does feel stranghe, doesn't it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: bidding naturally I mean|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yo_yo: I've been waiting for that sequence to come up |pg||
nt|brolucius: North is well worth a double, on his passed hand.|pg||
nt|haans: haglund can count tre spades with me short i dummy|pg||
nt|diaoff: We start with an easy one|pg||
nt|diaoff: After finding out the distribution, S will put this in 4@H I guess|pg||
nt|milton_se: but N/S must find the Ds early|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South bids only 3@H because he remembered (yes) that his partner passed in the first seat.|pg||
nt|haans: NS has changed pair tsellden-andersson play swedish clubs = 11-13 or strong|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|magnus_e: yes they will, N starts to discourage for spades|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|bt: special license requiered|pg||
nt|milton_se: good evening|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hej Bertil|pg||
nt|haans: 4@D forcing 4@H end of relays|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bt: no @D Q lead, lol|pg||

nt|milton_se: not much of a drama here|pg||
nt|bt: west is pondering bad lies|pg||
nt|vugraph815: North has showed 3.4|pg||
nt|vugraph815: *3-4-3-3 and 11-13 hcp, just what he has :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|milton_se: is there any way to go wrong? can't see it|pg||
nt|diaoff: Best lead, but Haglund will surely make it|pg||
nt|magnus_e: :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: thats down 1|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, a few well-deserved IMPs back to Estonia (who realise that we are hoping for a close match).|pg||
nt|bt: east would already have claimed by now, if declarer|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yo_yo: they want a close match too |pg||
nt|yo_yo: with them in front|pg||
nt|milton_se: six easy tricks w QH well placed|pg||
nt|diaoff: 11 now with the passive lead|pg||
nt|milton_se: making 5 now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|magnus_e: or 2! have to make right decision in hearts|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/r3f2gp  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|haans: are he to open up @C or @D|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: Declarer has plenty of work to do, to make 3@H. Perhaps he cannot manage it.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|milton_se: true -- the 11-13 bal may well have 3 Hs|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: for those who dont know what the Bonn Nations cup is , here's a link: http://www.bridge-club-bonn.de/cms/_home/detail.php?nr=1204&rubric=Home|pg||
pc|s6|nt|milton_se: probably :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: That attack on the club suit has proved very effective.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lots of famous names on those lists of nations|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Dan Bylund|pg||

nt|bt: but who knows|pg||
nt|milton_se: oops finessed 8D?|pg||
nt|vugraph815: No, the defender claimed one down|pg||
nt|milton_se: Arne's got a good nose, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|magnus_e: another 4@s +1|pg||
nt|bt: 4@S but how to bid it|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bjurn: EW will probably end up in 1NT after 1@D -1@H; 1NT|pg||
mb|2H|nt|papa hall: and 4@S|pg||
nt|milton_se: not self-evident at all to bid|pg||
nt|bt: maybe south is worth 11-13 balanced?|pg||
nt|magnus_e: problably South would have 9p instead of 7|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bt: i vote yes|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bjurn: 1@H can be 3c suit|pg||
nt|bt: 3@D now ...|pg||
nt|haans: 14-16 passed<+|pg||
nt|milton_se: some tough businessman there...|pg||
nt|wygbe1: hi all|pg||
nt|milton_se: morning Jim|pg||
nt|haans: hi jim|pg||
nt|haans: svensson-karlsson are said to play natural (whatever that is?)|pg||
nt|vugraph815: They are playing 4-card Ms and 15-17 NT|pg||
mb|3S|nt|milton_se: this may be more interesting|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.1842  for the tournament website with convention cards, pictures and other tidbits. Ability to read and ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: understand Swedish an advantage|pg||
nt|papa hall: Yes, that @S-holding certainly should be worth something extra....you can finesse the 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Our operator in this room is Johan Grönkvist. Welcome Johan|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The most important person of them all|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt by misstake im sure|pg||
nt|milton_se: 14-16 treated as 15-17...|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: It was an example of the 'forcing defence', although declarer had quite a strong holding in clubs (the suit of the force).|pg||
nt|diaoff: 3NT|pg||
nt|magnus_e: easy 4@h |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2nt as trf|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yo_yo: so here we have drury in action|pg||
nt|diaoff: May be hard for W to visualize easts hand now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|diaoff: There is a block in diamonds, still hard to make though.|pg||
nt|haans: play low now|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, the mutual weak Ds may lead them wrong|pg||
nt|magnus_e: but if i g|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not a popular system in UK  |pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||

pc|c6|nt|haans: :( just a joke :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/r3f2gp  for standings and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|diaoff: 8 tricks on a natural plan of play|pg||
pc|c5|nt|magnus_e: oes wrong in @d he might go down|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|milton_se: this won't be a success|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: do you play drury David?|pg||
nt|brolucius: With trumps 2-2, ten tricks are there.|pg||
nt|diaoff: Now he will make 10 tricks with the friendly layout|pg||
nt|milton_se: Only a backward H finesse will threaten this|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: do not ruff next spade play loser|pg||
nt|diaoff: Just throw a looser if @S are played|pg||
nt|diaoff: echo :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d3|nt|haans: i was first :))|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|bjurn: due to the friendly lay in @Hs this will probably only go one down|pg||
pc|sK|nt|diaoff: good nose it was|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|diaoff: It will make|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bt: given the 11 counts opened here i think the south hand is "obvious" to open|pg||

nt|bjurn: had N ducked @HQ declarer wouldnt have had entries to establish the @H tricks|pg||
nt|haans: better than expected|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 3n is a lucky make on this one|pg||
mb|1C|nt|haans: all right here 4@S easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: shall we learn to duck?|pg||
nt|milton_se: H shift in 3rd trick was needed to take 2|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: i play it with some partners,  yes it was banned for ages|pg||
nt|bt: you mean i use my judgement?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|brolucius: Back in the happy days where the EBU was paranoid about young players psyching.|pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: But then Rimstedt could have established the clubs|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|sga1: Pl dont send me invitations. I dont like to play :9|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if s sits, they must play undisciplined 3n openers - at least opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|haans: more chancy bid in 3rd hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|milton_se: :)|pg||
nt|magnus_e: easy bid and will easy to play!|pg||
nt|haans: may have stopper(S)|pg||
nt|haans: standard- (nowdays)invite|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sga1: sry|pg||
nt|milton_se: not easy to impress on Pia :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: Some work to do for North|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: ew in sync with their preemptive style|pg||
nt|diaoff: nice fit here, but a @S lead settles it|pg||
nt|milton_se: now it's Johansson who has to show his nose ability|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|bjurn: so S shouldnt duck the @DQ then? |pg||
nt|diaoff: Yes, but it will make due to the bad connections for the defense|pg||
nt|milton_se: The bidding will certainly help|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Bessis is keen not to miss two games in a row...|pg||
nt|diaoff: Exactly, take and switch to spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: some play anything goes in 3d and 4th seat|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|brolucius: I am told: In the other room, South failed to return a heart for a ruff and lead a diamond. That's the only reason 3 made.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: presumably J shows 10|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i play 10 from that holding|pg||
nt|milton_se: KS should be w South, but JS?|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|magnus_e: now lo spade ducked to south|pg||
nt|milton_se: ducking a S will work|pg||
nt|diaoff: Exactly|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|diaoff: Time for a finesse...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|milton_se: y, and endplay won't work w one H left|pg||
pc|s5|nt|diaoff: Warne will be happy not having to guess @D|pg||
nt|diaoff: thats an alternative - anything will do|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|haans: right |pg||
nt|milton_se: can't go wrong now|pg||

nt|brolucius: Anyway, that's how we like it. A 9-IMP game.|pg||
nt|milton_se: trivial 4H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 6@S?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|milton_se: wouldn't SK first be correct as to the H break?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: interesting south hand here ;-)|pg||
nt|bt: reasonable bertil, yes|pg||
nt|milton_se: good fit, but 4S stands no chance|pg||
nt|diaoff: N likes her hand (21-22)|pg||
nt|milton_se: Hans-Ove being 2nd now|pg||
mb|1H|nt|diaoff: Pia considering 3@C asking or 3@H transfer|pg||
nt|milton_se: difficult choice for South|pg||
mb|p|nt|papa hall: Anything can be correct from S´s view|pg||
nt|milton_se: might be a grand with the right hand at N...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bt: thats positivie thinking opposite 10-12 ;-)|pg||
nt|papa hall: Now he knows it´s not a grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|magnus_e: Nice bidding, 3@c was what south needed|pg||
mb|3S|nt|milton_se: thought this would be a splinter position|pg||
nt|milton_se: or would that be a void?|pg||
nt|haans: i do not think he can |pg||
nt|haans: else why wait|pg||
nt|haans: he needs dia que|pg||
nt|milton_se: the friendly C break means 13 tricks w/o trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: Hard to see how Berik managed to make 4@S here|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bjurn: I'm not sure I'd bid 3@H as W|pg||
nt|milton_se: very good|pg||

mb|p|nt|magnus_e: could he make it?|pg||
nt|milton_se: now it comes|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|magnus_e: why not open with 4@h|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: unlucky for the French |pg||
