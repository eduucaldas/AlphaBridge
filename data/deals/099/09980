nt|bjurn: These two pairs play similar systems; strong club with 14-16 NT and nebulous 1@D opening. |pg||
nt|papa hall: This will be a battle of pace...EW fast as lightening and NS slower than paint drying|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: the strong club hasnt hit my part of the world yet|pg||
nt|haans: hi all (and Roland :))|pg||

nt|milton_se: not known for being shy :)|pg||
nt|diaoff: Now it will not end on the 2-level, which is maximum both ways|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bt: so this is completely natural|pg||
nt|bt: and east should cuebid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is that allowed these days?|pg||
nt|papa hall: Yes...does feel stranghe, doesn't it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: bidding naturally I mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: I've been waiting for that sequence to come up |pg||
nt|brolucius: North is well worth a double, on his passed hand.|pg||
nt|haans: haglund can count tre spades with me short i dummy|pg||
nt|diaoff: We start with an easy one|pg||
nt|diaoff: After finding out the distribution, S will put this in 4@H I guess|pg||
nt|milton_se: but N/S must find the Ds early|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South bids only 3@H because he remembered (yes) that his partner passed in the first seat.|pg||
nt|haans: NS has changed pair tsellden-andersson play swedish clubs = 11-13 or strong|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|magnus_e: yes they will, N starts to discourage for spades|pg||

pc|d9|nt|milton_se: is there any way to go wrong? can't see it|pg||

nt|milton_se: thats down 1|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|brolucius: So, a few well-deserved IMPs back to Estonia (who realise that we are hoping for a close match).|pg||

pc|sT|nt|yo_yo: they want a close match too |pg||

pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|brolucius: Declarer has plenty of work to do, to make 3@H. Perhaps he cannot manage it.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|milton_se: true -- the 11-13 bal may well have 3 Hs|pg||

mb|p|nt|papa hall: and 4@S|pg||
nt|milton_se: not self-evident at all to bid|pg||
nt|bt: maybe south is worth 11-13 balanced?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: The most important person of them all|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt by misstake im sure|pg||
nt|milton_se: 14-16 treated as 15-17...|pg||
mb|5D|nt|brolucius: It was an example of the 'forcing defence', although declarer had quite a strong holding in clubs (the suit of the force).|pg||

nt|magnus_e: easy 4@h |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2nt as trf|pg||

nt|brolucius: With trumps 2-2, ten tricks are there.|pg||

nt|milton_se: Only a backward H finesse will threaten this|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|haans: do not ruff next spade play loser|pg||

mb|3D|nt|haans: all right here 4@S easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: shall we learn to duck?|pg||
nt|milton_se: H shift in 3rd trick was needed to take 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i play it with some partners,  yes it was banned for ages|pg||
nt|bt: you mean i use my judgement?|pg||

mb|4D!|nt|sga1: Pl dont send me invitations. I dont like to play :9|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if s sits, they must play undisciplined 3n openers - at least opposite a passed hand|pg||

nt|diaoff: nice fit here, but a @S lead settles it|pg||
nt|milton_se: now it's Johansson who has to show his nose ability|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjurn: so S shouldnt duck the @DQ then? |pg||
nt|diaoff: Yes, but it will make due to the bad connections for the defense|pg||
nt|milton_se: The bidding will certainly help|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|brolucius: Bessis is keen not to miss two games in a row...|pg||
nt|diaoff: Exactly, take and switch to spades|pg||
pc|cT|nt|wygbe1: some play anything goes in 3d and 4th seat|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|brolucius: I am told: In the other room, South failed to return a heart for a ruff and lead a diamond. That's the only reason 3 made.|pg||

nt|milton_se: trivial 4H here|pg||

mb|p|pc|cA|nt|magnus_e: what an ugly bid : 3@s|pg||

nt|Walddk6: This is the last board of the match. Many thanks again to Martin Stoszek, our very capable operator in Bonn. Well done!|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Also thanks to our excellent commentators: Kath Nelson and David Bird|pg||

nt|papa hall: with some very, very good guessing, maybe|pg||
nt|vugraph815: Good preempt by West, kept them out of the cold slam|pg||
nt|milton_se: but ruffing first D high|pg||
nt|haans: forcing|pg||
nt|magnus_e: could they stop in time?|pg||
nt|diaoff: I doubt|pg||
nt|magnus_e: maybe now, 4@h with Larsson´s D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: better pass at 4@C :)|pg||
nt|papa hall: Now cI don't think 4@S will be an issue any more|pg||

nt|diaoff: Absoloutely|pg||
nt|milton_se: excellent 6C if not S lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|magnus_e: I will bid 1S with norths hand|pg||

nt|milton_se: sorry 7C|pg||
nt|haans: good or bad|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D GF if good|pg||
nt|milton_se: normally, staying below 4H would be disgraceful|pg||
nt|magnus_e: 2@h from N. Is it forcing?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|diaoff: No problem, any lead|pg||
nt|arvid: The problem is the bidding|pg||
nt|diaoff: True :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, missed one M trick|pg||
nt|diaoff: Maybe an old-fashioned jump-shift to 3@C would hhave made life easier|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|bt: great minds think alike|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Peterson passed, but much better bid 1@S|pg||
nt|milton_se: you see that as old-fashioned?|pg||
nt|haans: good so GF|pg||
nt|magnus_e: that was a sucess for the double of 1@s :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bt: ruff spade. lead a heart|pg||
nt|milton_se: no, sir, we old men bid 1S|pg||
nt|haans: häxan and gazzilli are the same convention|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk6: Finally, our appreciation to the DBV (German Bridge Federation) for bringing this prestigious event to BBO vugraph. Josef Harsanyi, Matthias Schüller and Peter Eidt have been ...|pg||
nt|Walddk6: instrumental in setting up a great show|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good old checkback 2@C i assume|pg||

nt|diaoff: Many do, but I still play so...|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|diaoff: That was lucky!|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|brolucius: The club position is unfavourable.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: A club lead would kill the game before it had a chance. He has led a club.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a rotten lead for the Estonians |pg||
nt|milton_se: me too, but only 1-suited as this|pg||
nt|milton_se: easy enough then 1H - 3C - 4D...|pg||
nt|milton_se: well on their way now|pg||
nt|diaoff: ..but will also go down|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|milton_se: good bid!|pg||
nt|diaoff: A kibitzer suggest 5@D exclusion BW over 3@C, but this will also work I guess|pg||
nt|milton_se: can you be sure that 3C promises this suit?|pg||
nt|diaoff: No, that is the problem|pg||
nt|milton_se: Berik is 24 VPs up for the championship now|pg||
nt|milton_se: sure, D shift and Cs|pg||
pc|s9|nt|magnus_e: nice play|pg||
nt|papa hall: Arne must be getting old...that was his longest thinking pause ever|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good line by declarer|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|diaoff: Strange, shouldn't 5NT ask for two honnors?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|diaoff: I think 3NT is the only game making - impossible to reach though, especially at this table :)|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: take out double better than bidding suit|pg||
pc|c6|nt|milton_se: we both do -- at least in theory :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: yep|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: Playing a different NT range, South would open 1NT and play the contract after a transfer response.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: when i lead a doubleton my partner never has AQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Never? That's unlucky.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe it just seems that way :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: very good slam, but not much room to find it|pg||
pc|s5|nt|milton_se: 4H would be more hoorable :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|haans: they were not prepared|pg||
nt|bjurn: I'm not sure why W didnt bid 3@D, maybe a bit too weak?|pg||
nt|diaoff: Alternatively, Andersson could have shown a two-suiter with 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: vul may b to strong|pg||
nt|milton_se: honorable|pg||

nt|yo_yo: hello from Manchester|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would seem to be a flat board, but who can tell after the last set?|pg||
nt|haans: question was 4@D a good bid???????|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: I'm not sure why S bid 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: on board 14 ew got involved and helped ns bid the difficult to bid game|pg||
nt|milton_se: 1S would have forced Arne to pass -- not showing real Cs|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|milton_se: Feels like this start means that Frirond won't compete...|pg||
nt|haans: enter with 2@D penalised?|pg||
nt|milton_se: 5NT should be this, I think: all 1st controls|pg||
nt|magnus_e: 6@h from north|pg||
nt|diaoff: Hans-Ove and Everfresh both on 151 now|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I was just thinking to myself that 40 years ago some players would have responded 3NT...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that seems a good description of North's hand|pg||
nt|diaoff: Might end up too high in @H here|pg||
nt|wygbe1: rehi all|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|diaoff: ...or have they also started to apply the modern pick-a-slam conv? :)|pg||
nt|vugraph815: That's what East thougt while Weat interpreted it as asking about trumphonours and that he needed three to bid the grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: apparently neither did he :)|pg||
nt|haans: not as per cc|pg||
nt|milton_se: ... not easy to take back 20 imps from Berik|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|yo_yo: yes a good old fashioned bid|pg||
nt|papa hall: For those of you not familiar with Swedish geography....2@H is called Askeröd...named after a little town in southern Sweden|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many time a overcall at level 1 is more effective that a preemptive at 3 level|pg||
nt|bt: 2N was conservative?|pg||
nt|magnus_e: on board 14 Törnqvist in other room showed 13+ with norhs hand. It led to 4@s. Good evaluation. |pg||
nt|diaoff: Never argue with success, and the zones were in favour|pg||
nt|vugraph815: I think you could set it for 800, so... no :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|magnus_e: 3@h extras i suppose?|pg||
nt|diaoff: will stop in 5 now I guess|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: South didnt think north could have the @H suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: West has read the text-books 'Only weak players lead from a jack', but he held all the jacks.|pg||
nt|diaoff: Or not...|pg||
nt|haans: we will soon find the answer to that question|pg||
nt|vugraph815: But sure, partner could have had an extra @D and then it would have been a good sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|haans: 4@S preemtive???|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: EW didnt end up too high, NS did. :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: im all for passing 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraph815: And by consuming a lot of space you make it easier for them to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|diaoff: will also lead hearts the safe way making 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt with 19 isn't standard, overall with 5 closed suit|pg||
nt|haans: yes they did not find their @C|pg||
nt|vugraph815: So all in all, I think it's an acceptable choice|pg||
pc|hK|nt|diaoff: Not always good to win the auction :)|pg||

nt|milton_se: y but quite a diff between 100 and 300|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|vugraph815: Guess so|pg||
nt|diaoff: Probably|pg||
nt|milton_se: one of the great arts: played board is played :)|pg||
nt|vugraph815: The other room has now caught us so perhaps we'll get some scores to compare with soon :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: agreed|pg||
nt|brolucius: A possible heart slam but not a club slam.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 1@D-1@S-3NT?|pg||
nt|milton_se: really not the bid I like -- 3C or pass|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|yo_yo: This is a good example of why to play in a 4-4 fit|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjurn: 1@D is either 11-13 balanced, 4+@D unbalanced or occasionally 4M, 5@C with a bad @C suit|pg||
nt|milton_se: minor Xfer?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bt: ns heading twards 2@H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|milton_se: 3C may lead to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjurn: now South will surely lead @Cs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: xfert, not DONT|pg||
nt|milton_se: down on trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: on any lead but Cs in fact|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C weak or strong now he had to do all bidding himself|pg||
nt|haans: but why complain? an easy make|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: warne happy now?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: It is possible that 1@D did not quite get the job done of describing his excellent club suit.|pg||
nt|diaoff: Must avoid taking the first @D here|pg||
nt|diaoff: Indeed!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bt: or 3@h|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|bridge_one: 2@S is or very strong hand, or minimum with a limit raise in @H|pg||
nt|haans: no loos a @D|pg||
nt|haans: 4th best leadf|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bt: so which one was thie? :-)|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|brolucius: Declarer is muttering "Where is the 4-1 trump break when you want it?"|pg||
nt|vugraph815: S shows max w exactly 3@h|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: is 1@C - 1@H  - 4@C too old fashioned?|pg||
nt|brolucius: I think you are forgetting, Kath, that we all open 1@D on that North hand.|pg||
nt|milton_se: all signs said it was frozen|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c4|nt|po-s: but everything would have given away a suit, spade, heart dia trump|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bridge_one: sry, i seen only now 1Nt by South, not by east !|pg||
nt|bt: west shortened the play for us specs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be too much grappa :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: that wasn't what was needed|pg||
nt|bt: can it ever be too much grappa?|pg||
nt|papa hall: Lars you have a problem|pg||
nt|diaoff: 6@C is a better contract|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|milton_se: in good control|pg||

nt|papa hall: Oh...my mistake|pg||
pc|d7|nt|milton_se: Ss not much of a problem|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|arvid: Not an easy hand to play when hearts 4-1|pg||
nt|milton_se: no, really not, but looked good|pg||
nt|arvid: Yes, but so much easier when we know that east has both @D king and queen|pg||
nt|milton_se: Scania has really recovered after a disastrous start in the finals|pg||
