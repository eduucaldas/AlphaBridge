nt|Walddk2: If you play 5-card majors, there is no alternative to 2@S in my opinion. Even in a 4-card major system I would raise spades|pg||

nt|vugraphzpt: The ruling will clearly affect P&L final position|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: The delay is ruling and gettting final scores delivered to me|pg||
nt|poohbear: so the @h lead might not be so wrong. If the directors had asked the first 3 experts and they all said a @s lead then as long as they were sure about the hesitation the ruling ...|pg||

nt|poohbear: no ruling as of yet|pg||

nt|po-s: David, it would be sad if the reverse were true|pg||
nt|poohbear: The screen got pushed to Feldman who was the only person who had a chance to act so clearly it was his hesitation|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|po-s: I guess the bidding was similar at many tables|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Now West hesitated and East led a heart|pg||
nt|poohbear: which I think is the correct lead but not at all clearcut|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Not wanting to cast anything on anybody I would actively not lead a heart in this situation. |pg||
nt|jbgood: hesitated ,|pg||
nt|poohbear: anyway I am off to enjoy some Cavendish free food:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: why put myself in harms way - they cant call the director because I DIDNT lead a heart|pg||

nt|vugraphzpt: I await ruling and results|pg||
nt|henryb: Aren't Pepsi and Feldman on the same side, and couldn't Lev be thinking if for example he were 5-5 in the red suits?|pg||

nt|vugraphzpt: No screen runs top left to bottom right|pg||
nt|henryb: I mean Pepsi thinking|pg||
nt|henryb: Yes, but it could have been Pepsi thinking about whether to pass 3N|pg||
nt|henryb: the tray went to Pepsi and Feldman|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Which would you back Pepsi to be thinking of bidding over 3NT or partner doubling - anyway as I said why put yourself in harms way|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/seniorcamrosetms.htm  for most of the system cards|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: NS play 2/1 with multi and tartan 2s|pg||
mb|d|mb|2C|nt|duschek: It seems the Mackenzies play 2/1 with a strong NT, whereas Scannell/Glynn play 5-card majors and a weak NT|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: no!|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: What does 'no' mean, Henry?|pg||
nt|henryb: if you were going to pass 2@d -- and partner did not overcall -- you should bid 1@h not double.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: It might have been better for Moyna to overcall there|pg||
nt|roswolf: well to play in a 4-2 minor fit when you have a 5-3 major fit is not a good omen!|pg||
nt|duschek: Seems both North and South underbid - 2@D with opposite a balancing double sounds like appr. 6-10 HCP, and having decided to double, South should continue with 2@H|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree|pg||
nt|henryb: If you double -- I think that is right -- you bid 2@h over 2@d|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Kath can tell us|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|duschek: South has 14 fine HCP with aces and tens, so in my view it is a borderline decision between 1@H and a double followed by 2@H|pg||

nt|henryb: they aren't violating Burn's Law, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the irish slam bidding is notoriously unreleable|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|duschek: No, you have to play it badly - it seems the easy play is to test hearts, then go for 3 tricks in clubs by playing the @CAK and then a club towards the jack|pg||

nt|vugraphzsg: "I KC and a useful void"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, and a normal contract. Third time lucky. Boards 1 and 2 were not|pg||

nt|roswolf: very true|pg||

nt|duschek: At other tables, E/W might very well have all the bidding space for themselves. South's hand can only be opened if you have a bid which can show a weak hand with both majors|pg||
