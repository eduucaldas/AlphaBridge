nt|ahollan1: you can access those and session/running scores  at http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USWBC2009/Bracket.php?stage=PlayoffFinals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: click on team name to get SSF & CC|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not yet written -- science of showing 3 card support and outside EIGHT bagger|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: and just to even things out --- the other room just crashed :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: that makes me feel better -- I was thinking it was me :)|pg||
nt|daman: 4 @H will be the likely contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C down, i dont see a possiblity to play the reduction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: of course if lead @S, otherwise also 5@C made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curious that the 9 card fit missing only Q has 2 losers, but 8 card fit missing QJ has only 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very strange deities our gods of probability|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: I'm sure Rosie has visions , but Stasha will not cooperate :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pef: we believe mancuso is still up by 3 imps with a very long way to go|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: not mutually exclusive Ray|pg||
nt|bridge_one: everyone would choise 2@H instead 3@c here ? i amn't sure about this hand - very difficult|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from what i've seen this week, Stasha tendency between less optimistic => pessimistic|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: oops|pg||
nt|jstokes: i'm not sure about 3@C; suggests short spades to me|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C by South A in @c (by North, having the K)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: we have a rule in New York not to put down 8 cards suits in dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow - 4@H   laying down 8 bagger as dummy is RIGHT |pg||
nt|daman: only because you have to move the board to lay them out :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be a misunderstand, or also a natural bid (don't having Aces) giving the best information to play slam or not - this is true only if they play 2@D or 3@C forcing game|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: unless they are trumps say the kibitzers :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|h3|nt|pef: can we try that auction again, vugraph?|pg||
nt|cbernstn: did east bid 5@C?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: seems the most likely explanation -- they avoided 3Nt after South doubled for th diamond lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but 5@C has no play|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more play for EW than NS :)|pg||
nt|pef: I'd find east bidding 5c pretty surprising, would be more likely to look for a 43 major fit|pg||
nt|buffytvs: for sure :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right peter -- 2 Moysians to explore before picking @C|pg||
nt|buffytvs: actually they might make 4@H|pg||
nt|rcm: this auction seems very strange|pg||
nt|cbernstn: 3NT down in other room, where 3NT was the contract on the first 3 boards|pg||
nt|pef: well looks like the final contract was 5c down 1 which actually gained 3 imps vs 3nt down 2 in the close room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein DBL of 3@S gave Wittes an option she probably wouldn't have taken otherwise|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i think 2@D big winner in the long run -- 2@S caters to such a small window of hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jumping back to last hand -- it's been pointed out to me that hand should make after @S at trick 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: ruffing with the 8 of diamonds by quinn may have cost a trick because now declarer had two entires to lead toward the spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|pef: more than just good, I would say, nearly 100% for a small slam, pretty much exactly 50% for a grand|pg||

mb|3S|nt|jstokes: pushed west to make an unusual 2@C raise on 3, which worked out well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now 4@D shortness or 4@S mild slam try |pg||
mb|p|pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: 4@S is slam try because 2N-4@H is Texas Transfer to 4@S with no slam interest|pg||

nt|ahollan1: exactly -- must either super accept or go after invited|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cbernstn: I think N might have moved over 3@H|pg||
nt|pef: in that 3nt shawn quinn made a few boards ago, they did go down in the open room,  declarer didn't time the play nearly as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cindy - do you have a preference of type of super accept?|pg||
nt|pef: so far this is looking to be a very good set for the mancuso team|pg||
nt|cbernstn: I might have bid 3NT with North hand over 3@H|pg||
nt|pef: there are lots of possible ways to play the superaccept.  some would say jumping to 4s is limited with 4 good spades and you cuebid with a really good hand.  others might say you ...|pg||
nt|pef: will have so much to cuebid that cuebids show limited, but good values, and bidding 4s is a really strong hand in controls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm i thought 3N often covers unusual shape WITHOUT @S|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Linda and I play step response superaccepts, showing trump quality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so thinking 4@C as either source of tricks or just cue bid|pg||
nt|pef: another topic even a lot of experienced partnerships don't discuss enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tell us more Ray|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I'm trying to remember LOL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|buffytvs: iirc, 1st step superaccept is 3 trumps with a ruffing value, next is 4 trumps, top is 4 trumps to a top honour -- 3NT is 4trumps but 4333|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but East has not promised 4@C|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: thing to note for most of the specs who play "frequently bypass @D" -- a) that doesn't mean always  b) you must define strength for responder for bidding 1@D when holding 4 card ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: major  c) you must define whether opener allowed to rebid 1N holding 4@H or 4@S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: what a difference @DJ or 10 would make in West hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i suppose if we give Quinn @D10 gods will move !J to North|pg||
nt|buffytvs: declarer may not feel that good about playing West for @cA|pg||
nt|pef: on the board we talked about both north and south stretching to bid 2h and 3h, mancuso gained 5 imps because north did not overcall 2h, instead balanced later, so they played in ...|pg||
nt|pef: only 2h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or @H 33 --- but both work   go figure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you think about @DJ and duck trick 1?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|buffytvs: I think it's the right play|pg||
nt|jstokes: no reason in the world to bypass diamonds with a game going hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: original Walsh said 1@D denies 4@H/@S unless forcing to game -- others says Invitational+ strength|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: key is that partnership should know|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: MUST know|pg||

nt|buffytvs: but same inference|pg||
