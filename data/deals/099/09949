nt|ahollan1: Montreal Relay was a forerunner to relay systems to get pure distribution info|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Undo please|pg||
nt|pef: opening bids have gotten a lot lighter, but that probably doesn't even meet strong club players standards :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: sorry folks, the connection dropped and i lost  everything will resume with board 2|pg||
nt|pef: what was the final contract on board 1?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: click on team name to get SSF & CC|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not yet written -- science of showing 3 card support and outside EIGHT bagger|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|buffytvs: that makes me feel better -- I was thinking it was me :)|pg||
nt|daman: 4 @H will be the likely contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C down, i dont see a possiblity to play the reduction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: of course if lead @S, otherwise also 5@C made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curious that the 9 card fit missing only Q has 2 losers, but 8 card fit missing QJ has only 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very strange deities our gods of probability|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: I'm sure Rosie has visions , but Stasha will not cooperate :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: we believe mancuso is still up by 3 imps with a very long way to go|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not mutually exclusive Ray|pg||
nt|bridge_one: everyone would choise 2@H instead 3@c here ? i amn't sure about this hand - very difficult|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|ahollan1: from what i've seen this week, Stasha tendency between less optimistic => pessimistic|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: oops|pg||
nt|jstokes: i'm not sure about 3@C; suggests short spades to me|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C by South A in @c (by North, having the K)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: we have a rule in New York not to put down 8 cards suits in dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow - 4@H   laying down 8 bagger as dummy is RIGHT |pg||
nt|daman: only because you have to move the board to lay them out :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be a misunderstand, or also a natural bid (don't having Aces) giving the best information to play slam or not - this is true only if they play 2@D or 3@C forcing game|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: unless they are trumps say the kibitzers :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|pef: can we try that auction again, vugraph?|pg||
nt|cbernstn: did east bid 5@C?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: seems the most likely explanation -- they avoided 3Nt after South doubled for th diamond lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but 5@C has no play|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more play for EW than NS :)|pg||
nt|pef: I'd find east bidding 5c pretty surprising, would be more likely to look for a 43 major fit|pg||
nt|buffytvs: for sure :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right peter -- 2 Moysians to explore before picking @C|pg||
nt|buffytvs: actually they might make 4@H|pg||
nt|rcm: this auction seems very strange|pg||
nt|cbernstn: 3NT down in other room, where 3NT was the contract on the first 3 boards|pg||
nt|pef: well looks like the final contract was 5c down 1 which actually gained 3 imps vs 3nt down 2 in the close room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein DBL of 3@S gave Wittes an option she probably wouldn't have taken otherwise|pg||

nt|ahollan1: N wasn't really going to sit if S bid 2@H, was she?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 2@D was quite a call -- couldn't North have been 4432, for example?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bridge_one: can lose the ruff in @S bec is the natural trump trik  for North - but need to play A - now North can make 2 ruff|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i think 2@D big winner in the long run -- 2@S caters to such a small window of hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jumping back to last hand -- it's been pointed out to me that hand should make after @S at trick 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: ruffing with the 8 of diamonds by quinn may have cost a trick because now declarer had two entires to lead toward the spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in 5@C  ruff 3rd spade, use @D to dummy to ruff @D, use @H to ruff again -- now trump endplay|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pef: although I don't see how she made 5, we'll need to check that|pg||

mb|p|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: i may have missed one reduction play - and cask 2nd @H but you get the picture|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|buffytvs: lol -- North is endplayed already|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: examining the convention cards for this event, a surpisingly small number of pairs play Puppet Stayman over 2N|pg||

pc|d7|nt|pef: 4h here depends on guessing diamonds, but hard to fault north for not bidding more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least thats what the notes say - even though we probably don't think West qualifies|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can make 4@h E/S|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jstokes: this looks pretty good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D would be a good defence|pg||
nt|daman: this will hurt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't it need guess of @SJ?|pg||
nt|daman: eventually perhaps|pg||
nt|jstokes: with clubs not breaking it does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or @C ruff beats off top|pg||
nt|daman: it's not a bad game at all and when you compare, and you see NS were in 3@D making?   teeth will gnash|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i like the auction|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: IF 1N was that strong, seems East might have made a takeout dbl of 2@H [if that is option]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so many ifs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cbernstn: Black suit plays will place red-suit honors in West hand|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: the movie has down 3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: there are actually a few pairs in this championship who do NOT play Kokish -- but not many|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: North hand not strong enough, but 2@C-2@D start made me think of it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I suspect we have the auction on 41 and the cards from 40 here|pg||
nt|pef: this is obviously the board from last round|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pef: more than just good, I would say, nearly 100% for a small slam, pretty much exactly 50% for a grand|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|daman: Quinn overcalled 1@S as South and pushed her opps to 3@C|pg||
nt|daman: in the OR|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: the 9 of @h made it on the last hand - nice try by Cohen|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jstokes: pushed west to make an unusual 2@C raise on 3, which worked out well|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: now 4@D shortness or 4@S mild slam try |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: 4@S is slam try because 2N-4@H is Texas Transfer to 4@S with no slam interest|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|buffytvs: Mmm.. if South is interested in a spade slam without the @SAK, why doesn't North make a move?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|pef: if this really was the auction I'm very surprised|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a bit surprising that Bjerkan neither gave super-accept NOR tray after Weinstein invite|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|pef: once north didn't super accept, surely she could make a move over 4s|pg||
nt|daman: making 2 will be a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i really like the 1@S overcall|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|buffytvs: well, the play won't take long :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly -- must either super accept or go after invited|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cbernstn: I think N might have moved over 3@H|pg||
nt|pef: in that 3nt shawn quinn made a few boards ago, they did go down in the open room,  declarer didn't time the play nearly as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cindy - do you have a preference of type of super accept?|pg||
nt|pef: so far this is looking to be a very good set for the mancuso team|pg||
nt|cbernstn: I might have bid 3NT with North hand over 3@H|pg||
nt|pef: there are lots of possible ways to play the superaccept.  some would say jumping to 4s is limited with 4 good spades and you cuebid with a really good hand.  others might say you ...|pg||
nt|pef: will have so much to cuebid that cuebids show limited, but good values, and bidding 4s is a really strong hand in controls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm i thought 3N often covers unusual shape WITHOUT @S|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Linda and I play step response superaccepts, showing trump quality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so thinking 4@C as either source of tricks or just cue bid|pg||
nt|pef: another topic even a lot of experienced partnerships don't discuss enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tell us more Ray|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I'm trying to remember LOL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|buffytvs: iirc, 1st step superaccept is 3 trumps with a ruffing value, next is 4 trumps, top is 4 trumps to a top honour -- 3NT is 4trumps but 4333|pg||

nt|ahollan1: will Quinn open 2@D in 2nd seat?|pg||
nt|pef: lots of gremlins this match|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pef: i bet she opens 2 or 3  (I know kit woolsey would open 3)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: we have [at least] 2 of the recently crowned USA 1 team watching our table|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: thing to note for most of the specs who play "frequently bypass @D" -- a) that doesn't mean always  b) you must define strength for responder for bidding 1@D when holding 4 card ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: major  c) you must define whether opener allowed to rebid 1N holding 4@H or 4@S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: what a difference @DJ or 10 would make in West hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i suppose if we give Quinn @D10 gods will move !J to North|pg||
nt|buffytvs: declarer may not feel that good about playing West for @cA|pg||
nt|pef: on the board we talked about both north and south stretching to bid 2h and 3h, mancuso gained 5 imps because north did not overcall 2h, instead balanced later, so they played in ...|pg||
nt|pef: only 2h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or @H 33 --- but both work   go figure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you think about @DJ and duck trick 1?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|buffytvs: I think it's the right play|pg||
nt|jstokes: no reason in the world to bypass diamonds with a game going hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: original Walsh said 1@D denies 4@H/@S unless forcing to game -- others says Invitational+ strength|pg||

pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: IF West doesn't cover|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|buffytvs: 2nd chair red, West opened a weak 2 on a king-high suit -- so declarer placed her with the missing ace as well|pg||
pc|c2|nt|buffytvs: sorry, white|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but same inference|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but is it best line?   i suppose Bjerkan playing West to hold @CA or East to hold Ace AND Queen|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i'm a fan of offshape NT opening and overcalls -- but no aceless with unsure stopper|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: after 15-17 NT -- will Pollack just bid 3N or show @C along the way?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C ON now|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 2@C puppet 2@D   then show invitational hand with bad suit|pg||
nt|cbernstn: Glasson has yet to score this segment.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: will have to guess trumps to make 4@H on this one|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: or just game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: Margie - are players letting you see their cards?? that's the biggest hurdle for most|pg||
nt|bridge_one: bidding the strong one suit hand would be beter in this hand - but difficult to choise this without singletons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: following play of hand can be brutal|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: they're all afraid of me :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: yes, they had the same auction on what we thought was a fairly easy slam to bid--guess neither partnership had discussed how to show various hand types over the 3 level transfer ...|pg||
nt|pef: and just how strong a slam invitation it was|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|pef: but not getting to the other slam was even more surprising.  in one case they just made a mild try and gave up, in the other blackwood|pg||
nt|ahollan1: key point here for partnerships playing any form of checkback -- is opener's first option 3 card support or 4 of other major|pg||
nt|cbernstn: best to duck the ace on this trick|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|buffytvs: I prefer to show support first|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: i don't think statistics favor either approach -- just key to be on same page|pg||

nt|pef: another potential gain for mancuso, although would take a lot to make 4h as cindy pointed out with best defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i just don't know if that should help or hinder guess in trump|pg||

nt|Vugraphu5: i need to wait for a break to ask them.  I seem don't remember.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Margie toying with us again hehe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=transfer to @H  3@S is natural preempt :)|pg||

nt|bridge_one: np, you are the best Margie !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: finally we have a fun operator !|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: I'm used to it :) I tske myself least seriously of all |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: quinn's pass denies 3+@S|pg||
nt|pef: tough problem for quinn, maybe 3n, but awfully short of aces|pg||
nt|buffytvs: those clubs are enticing though|pg||
nt|pef: but I bet she picks 3nt as the best of bad alternatives|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: i can't speak english anymore |pg||
nt|buffytvs: i agree -- i think she'll shoot it|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: as operator, i found BBO UNDO mechanism very troublesome -- it doesn't happen quickly and huge risk of losing track of rest of auction or play of cards|pg||

nt|pef: wow, one in a row for us|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|Vugraphu5: why I left the auction :)|pg||

nt|buffytvs: yes -- wd in a tough situation|pg||
nt|pef: thanks to my fellow commentators, cindy, al, and ray|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it also covers game forcing hands that rest of world would transfer|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, but the problem was after 4@C (over 3@C), 4@H, 4@s, and now 4Nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and can also learn about opener's long minors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops -- I'm using "Montreal Relay" in wrong context -- sorry about that|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3 more sets of 16 to play today -- next in about 35 minutes|pg||
nt|cbernstn: Thanks.  Interesting set of hands.|pg||
nt|pef: to bbo, of course for making this all happen, despite some apparent wireless connectivity problems in sacramento|pg||
nt|bridge_one: difficult communication for E/W to play 4@h - the layout of @h was favorable|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ahollan1: we're playing tag signoff here :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now that Kit Woolsey is in the room, Mancuso trots out Forcing 1N|pg||
mb|d|nt|pef: to Roland Wald for arranging this ragged crew and to Jan Martel and her team of volunteers at the USBF|pg||
nt|pef: three more sets today before we put the women's team trials to rest|pg||
nt|pef: next one scheduled to start at 1:30 PM Pacific time|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the dbl is 4M + longer minor or diamonds -- in this case she has both|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL =  a) 4@H/@S & 5+@C/@D  b) @H 1-suit  c) STR @H & @S  d) STR @S 1-suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how's that for a specific convention|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: he hates that convention|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: north/south have an excellent 4h contract|pg||
nt|pef: a good hand for these methods|pg||
nt|cbernstn: Dbl shows 4-card major & 5-minor|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl again|pg||
mb|p|nt|cbernstn: OR just hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: bat also pass :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|buffytvs: or a really big hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: or diamonds|pg||
nt|pef: e/w also in 3nt on board 46 so possible the shutout will continue|pg||
nt|buffytvs: lot of hand types|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right or @D|pg||
nt|pef: what do you guys think, assuming the double of 2h showed heart cards, wouldn't you bid 4h on the south hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so nobody knows until the end :)|pg||
nt|pef: the cards you need to be onside all rate to be so|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: I think DBL probably says -- let's defend if you have @H -- but don't think it SHOWS @H length|pg||
nt|pef: I mean if partner has as llittle as xxx qjxxx xx xxx aren't you willing to be in game?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: agree -- depends on what the dbl means|pg||
nt|cbernstn: Since South could have hand types that don't include hearts, N must have good hearts, I would think.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 3@H probably the @H + minor type -- single suit @H would bid 4@H|pg||
nt|cbernstn: Warranting a game bid by South.|pg||
nt|pef: we are all speculating, obviously, but I agree with what cindy just said|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Rozie knows pard has zilch - so pass good|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in open room South Dbl again over 2@h|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but pass is ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without J   zilch would be drek|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|buffytvs: most of time South will have hearts for the dbl|pg||
nt|pef: seems much more useful over the 2h transfer for double to show hearts (and ask for a heart lead).  if that's true, bidding only 3h seems rather timid|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: i'm not convinced -- i think it is like many pass/correct situations|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so can't make pure penalty double ever|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d2|nt|tlc: seems like all roads lead to +140 and a 1 IMP pickup for Mancuso here...|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: yes - however would need to play @h from dummy after the dbl|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|tlc: well 170 now...|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|pef: but with just values, wouldn't it make more sense to pass the transfer and then double if it went 2s pp?|pg||
nt|pef: very unlikely to have a pure penalty double of spades|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 2 imp|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|buffytvs: Isn't 3@H forward-going?  If she passes 2@S she'll now be known to have one of the heart hands anyway...|pg||
nt|daman: the last 32 board should be exciting|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pef: yeah, but you'd bid that missing the q of diamonds or with only 5 diamonds, big diffrerence|pg||
nt|jstokes: thanks all |pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks again Margie!!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: BYE ALL !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next set   2 hours 15 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: thanks commentators see you 6 pm pacific|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks everybody -- especially kibitzers!!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|buffytvs: not sure I would|pg||
nt|pef: thanks everyone for watching. we hope connectivity improves for the next set!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: bye for now everyone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't be surprised if this board is push|pg||
