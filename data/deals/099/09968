pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: 13 tricks not certain -- need good things to happen in a red suit|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: so for the puritans, just a question of whether 6@S arrived at convincingly or not -- which gets an extra 5 points :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al no style points?|pg||
nt|daman: my guess is if you were in 7 and had to play it wide open?  you would end up making on a high crossruff after pitching @Ds on the @Hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a sure line for 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well most lines work|pg||
nt|daman: and ruffing @Cs along the way    East cannot get out of her own way on the play|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in encyclopedia this is also called Rule of 15  [which has 2nd definition that covers a lead convention]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rob -- we've found an 11 that I would NOT open :)|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: I knew Cansino as convention over opp 1N -- didn't know there was another meaning|pg||

nt|mariner1: same, add points and spades to get to 15 to open|pg||
nt|mariner1: so  a support REDBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Rob phrase better -- note to make, since Support DBL/RDBL originally invented for use in context of Strong Club system - some 2/1 players play support DBL but NOT support ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 83 Moss gained 10 back as the @S game was not found|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|mariner1: I was thinking they might find the A@C lead to beat 4....... no chance though on 83|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the idea is that in context of big club - opener never holds strong hand, but in 2/1 maybe big hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: S in a fix here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cohen not opening has really made things difficult for Pollack|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: players closing eyes resting, while she thinks|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: is DBL takeout??|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: is 2N nat or scramble?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: what is 2@H??  |pg||

nt|Vugraphu6: Stasha's eyes opened wide with the 4 spades call|pg||
