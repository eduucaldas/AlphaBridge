nt|april7: hello everybody and good morning|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: welcome back|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: round 3 is about to begin|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: and i play every day with players with a half century behind them and they double with those hands- but i had 16 points partner|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|april7: NS will reach 4@S andhave to guess the @C situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: world's best players sometimes nmake beginner errors and we are entitled as commentators to identify them|pg||
nt|milton_se: makes anyhow?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Avram, Bertil and Markku|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|doks: 12 tricks in @S available|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S   on diamond finesse|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and you can point out that despite the 16 points, the opposition scored 790 points|pg||
nt|lestergold: so perhaps slightly less than 50% slam|pg||
nt|april7: H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi all!|pg||
nt|milton_se: hi again Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yes Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: well judged|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: my policy is not to pull punches if they are supposed to be top class players|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|nigel_k:  I agree with South's 4S - the North hand is unusually suitable given the auction and slam is still average|pg||
nt|doks: after 2@S showing minimum, S wasnt interested|pg||
nt|lestergold: if i am commnetating on players who i know cant follow suit then my tongue stays in my cheek|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mmmakela: safer than 4 spades|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, a 4-1 trump break might be bad|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: hi all welcome|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mmmakela: 4 H makes|pg||
nt|milton_se: another non-dramatic game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: yes    a little more than minimum in support of spades|pg||
nt|doks: 4@D from N is interesting|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: what is 2d mean for n/s?|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry misread with the difficult names|pg||
nt|lestergold: ignore pl|pg||
nt|april7: NS should reach 4@H without any problems,losing only 2@S and 1 @D|pg||
mb|4H|nt|april7: Bergen raises I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yes - Leapong Michaels - diamonds plus a major that I hope is not held by the opposition  |pg||
nt|lestergold: hard not to bid game with north and unlucky to go off on gthe ruff|pg||
nt|thommos: hard to pass|pg||
nt|doks: 5looser hand 6-5 and good fillers|pg||
nt|thommos: no aces |pg||
nt|lestergold: but look how close e/w are to game themselves|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h can make|pg||
nt|thommos: ny west|pg||
nt|doks: S have a wrong A|pg||

nt|mmmakela: now makes 11|pg||
nt|mmmakela: safe 11 thanks to the spade 10|pg||
nt|haans: 50 years ago now dod know hown to handle the hearts suit. they did some good thinking before playing AK or finessing.|pg||
nt|haans: today we know AK is right|pg||
nt|mmmakela: IF opps haven't bid that is|pg||
nt|april7: 50 years ago I was told  8 ever 9 never|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: 50 years ago??? 20 for me|pg||
nt|mmmakela: many bidding sequences make finessing attractive|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|ady: 3 imps for team 2     doubled or not  looks like a good save   4@H   likely to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: end of round 5|pg||
nt|ady: very close now|pg||
nt|lestergold: but they werent bidding 4h no try at all!|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course they do not know about the double fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: rounds 6 and 7 are next, after that there's a 1.5h break|pg||
nt|ady: yes    so it seems|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: most are still playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: next round in about 10 minutes|pg||
nt|ady: going for coffee|pg||

nt|lestergold: n/s perfecto here|pg||
nt|april7: S shouldl overcall 1NT and N should  transferto @S|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: ah, natural bidding. One diamond=1@D|pg||
nt|april7: but W might bid 2@H nonforcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4h infrangible on combined 18 count|pg||
nt|doks: 18 count laydown game|pg||
nt|lestergold: will they identify the super fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon North knows about it right now|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: if 2@H swohs 6+, than yes|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|haans: a make|pg||
nt|april7: S chuses another line|pg||
pc|hK|nt|charles_l: i prefer 1N to 2@c, what do you think?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: well they have bid this more successully than the last hand|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  With four small spades and opponents having 7+ spades, North's hand is huge now|pg||
nt|lestergold: east's double was a sucker double|pg||
nt|doks: Majors are allways easyest to bid|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt = 7 2C = 8|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: doubling 4@H seems a bit strange|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|lestergold: why does east assume that three spades are standing|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Almost worth considering a redouble|pg||
nt|ady: especially with AKQ spades   where his partner may well have been longer|pg||
nt|lestergold: almost certainly not after pard's spade b id lucky 2 were standing|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|milton_se: I´d go for1NT|pg||
nt|april7: 2@C  should actually go down by good defence,losing 2 @D, 1@C,2 @S and 1 @H|pg||
nt|milton_se: y|pg||
nt|haans: long way to 2 @D|pg||

nt|charles_l: KNR (http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=q8+qj5+a63+aqjt4) suggests to devalue the major quacks 15.25|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: the sort of hand one criticises beginners for doubling with|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: may lose some of that  lead now|pg||
nt|doks: right switch to restrict to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: a redouble with an overtrick might have been encountered|pg||
nt|mdgraham: "criticising" is a bit strong. Pointing out why double is a bad idea, yes|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|thommos: the double was aggressive|pg||

pc|s8|pc|dK|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||

nt|haans: easy 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: 4@s perhaps safer|pg||
nt|april7: 1@S 2@D 2@S 3@C 3@H 3@S 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: especially if W bid 2@C|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: n/s   likely to play 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: close board, as 3@S is making|pg||
nt|haans: my bid now is 3NT|pg||
mb|2D|nt|doks: 1@C=bal or any strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3ncan m ake n/s quite favourable lie of cards especiallyin club suit|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ady: cards lay well|pg||
nt|april7: would you bid as E 2@C???|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|charles_l: no|pg||
mb|3S|nt|charles_l: not over 1@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|thommos: and @D suit|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: well a normal 3n|pg||
nt|lestergold: minimum values but normal|pg||
nt|charles_l: @DQ and @CK lie nicely|pg||
nt|charles_l: might duck the first @s on general principles|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence off to best lead but lead only needs to be lost by declarer once in diamodns to make this very lucky situation|pg||
nt|doks: in long run its better to bid close games, it gives opportunity for opps slip a little and let it make|pg||
nt|lestergold: 10 tricks actually available |pg||
nt|ady: should make 10 tricks    |pg||
nt|lestergold: this has been my mnatra for some time|pg||
nt|lestergold: top players bid the pips off|pg||
nt|charles_l: then they play the pips off :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so sometime a game goes off|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: so what|pg||
nt|charles_l: might consider over 1@d|pg||
pc|h3|nt|april7: vul.against nonvul.??|pg||
nt|haans: over 1@D yes good prempt|pg||
nt|charles_l: then no :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|charles_l: you need to consider how much space you take up|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|april7: Haans is optimist!:)|pg||
nt|charles_l: 1@c (1@d) is such a useless pre-empt'|pg||
nt|charles_l: that you better have a good hand and suit|pg||
nt|charles_l: or bid 1@c (2@d) instead|pg||
nt|april7: either or|pg||
pc|h4|nt|nigel_k:  I reckon this is less than a 10% chance on the N/S cards and you don't need to bid those against good opponents|pg||
nt|haans: penalizing overcalls has gone out of style|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is what good bridge is about |pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: this is the last board of round 3|pg||
nt|charles_l: http://www.asimere.com/BridgeArticles/EHAA%20style%20Acol.htm - "Nobody can double for penalties any more."|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: after round 4 there's a break|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: it's certainly a good idea to bid close games at teams - not so sure about pairs though|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well yes in theory you are right as is often the case with 12 opp 13 no 5 card suit but 3n is difficult to defend against as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: and also nmot possible to identify whetehr a particular copmbined 25 count will yield an only 10% contract or not|pg||
nt|charles_l: a quote from www.bridgematters.com -- "the key to using a Meckwell type system is declaring and defending like Meckwell."|pg||
nt|lestergold: and not possibkle toidentify that you only have the min 25 points either|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with 12 opposite 13 you should definitely be in 3N, as that is where the vast majority of the field will be playing|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree Mike|pg||
nt|doks: even if U go down, U will be in nice company|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, company, anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: you just have to bid these hands to game as if its not making then its usually lflat if it is making then you have explaining to do to teammates why you failed to bid stone cold 25 ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: [point papa mama game|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|nigel_k:  I agree with the bidding on this one, but both hands are absolute minimum for their action|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think e singing from same hymn sheet|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|charles_l: unless you're in a bidding magazine challenge - then there will be ONE hand with 28 combined miltons you need to bid to a partscore :)|pg||
mc|10|nt|ady: should have played a low diamond    jack cant gain except a mis defence|pg||
nt|thommos: 11 now|pg||
nt|charles_l: ty all - esp Raul|pg||
nt|haans: ty charles|pg||
nt|charles_l: back for next round in 10-15min i estimate|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: yes|pg||
nt|haans: have fun :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: the result of 29 was changed into result of 31|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: because the cards of 31 were put into board 29|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: but dealer/zones was that of board 31|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: I meant 29|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: well anyway, hopefully they'll work it out somehow :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: I'll close the broadcast now|pg||
