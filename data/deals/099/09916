nt|ady: South may open in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|lml: or will someone interrupt her party|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if breathing, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Marshall, Linda, David and Ed|pg||
nt|lml: hello :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome roland |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 4@S  without a heart lead|pg||
nt|lml: to open or not top open?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Ed.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Sir RR of course :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is a question of what, not whether|pg||
nt|reisig: whew ...he remembered :)|pg||
nt|ady: hi Roland |pg||
nt|lml: the prediction so far is clubs 1 or 3|pg||
nt|ady: hi Ed|pg||
mb|3C|nt|henryb: Presumable 14 to 16 or 17|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Sacramento in California for the Unites States Women's Championship. Playoff, six segments of 16 boards over two days; this is the first|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: obliging of E to hold 4 spades and not hearts|pg||
nt|reisig: They beat 4@s (by West)|pg||
nt|ady: if east plays 4@S   almost certain to make|pg||
nt|lml: you don't love double but the other choices aren't so good|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|hlortz: Looks like a pretty routine 3NT to start off|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Cindy Marshall, Henry Bethe and Henry Lortz, all from USA|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi all |pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: hello|pg||
nt|henryb: the winner of this match becomes one of the two US teams in the Venice Trophy|pg||
nt|henryb: this is a little tricky to play: declarer would like to set up three black tricks to go with 6 red ones|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i am not a fan of double, though it could be the winner. a lot depends on your weak 2 style though|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd prefer to get my long major into the auction, w ith such major suit disparities.  But nothing's clear.|pg||
nt|lml: who should bid more?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|henryb: but perhas should set up one spade and then work on diamonds|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: N correctly passed the double, where many would bid 4C. that almost surely will fetch a game bid from opps, which u dont want to hear. meanwhile, if you pass sometimes they stop in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S|pg||
nt|lml: but then again missing an iffy bid is not so bad|pg||
nt|lml: NV|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|reisig: You can tell from my silence ..I'd agree to anything|pg||
nt|lml: this isnt't that tense in 3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|3for3: good start for mancuso here|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: now only making 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree, ed. you might easily make a 5-2 spade game or 3NT if you bid 3S, but if you double go down in a crappy 43 heart game|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: going to be glad they are in partscore I think|pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb: now its easy: win in dummy and play a club for 9. And with the good diamonds should end up with 11|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|s4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|lml: nice play by Goldberg... shows shes awaks|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@S made 5 in other room|pg||
mc|9|nt|reisig: Hiya Danny!!!|pg||
nt|3for3: hi richie, all|pg||
nt|lml: well done to North-South really to hold it tight|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Deas bid 4s over 3s, so result acutally 4s down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi danny. |pg||
nt|3for3: that makes sense|pg||

nt|onebid: likely competition here|pg||
nt|onebid: NS will need to sell out early, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu5: e-w bid precision|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk5: Hi Ellen, Mike, Giorgio and Henry|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hlortz: hi all|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not more of 2@S for N/S here|pg||
nt|caitlin: hi there Roland|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|onebid: I think I'd prefer 1@S to neg X|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Henry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good day all|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bridge_one: Hi Roland , Henry & Martin|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: has to bid 2@S now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or not...|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: now she can't show 5 spades without overstating her values|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bridge_one: 2@S was more easy to make that 1Nt|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: this looks one shy|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes if 1@S showed 5, maybe better to raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe can play spades|pg||
nt|hlortz: looks like 4@H 2@S and 1@C for the defense...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with A A K and passed hand may be 2@H more clear - but probably the bad distribution 4333 give at South the idea to choose 1nt|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt need a present by def|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|lml: I dont like the negative double at all |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|onebid: Bob Glasson tells me 1@S would show minors!|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that is an interesting treatment |pg||
nt|lml: that is unfortunate|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: but not sufficient to make 7 tricks|pg||

nt|3for3: so 11 for mancuso, more than they won the entire first 16|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Hi, Danny!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: he has a second account for when he wants to do that|pg||
nt|lml: they deserved to win imps with the nice defense.  |pg||
nt|3for3: lol|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|3for3: 2@S here...|pg||
nt|3for3: 1@S shows 5|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hlortz: N shows a limit raise + in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  whats their notrump range ?|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S   about the limit for n/s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: and gets her side oveboard. but since E-W can make 3@s or 4@c, perhaps not so bad|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and all they will biod|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cindy:  1N on last hand with 14 but not 1N this time|pg||
nt|henryb: 14-17 I believe|pg||
nt|cindy:  ok|pg||
nt|3for3: identical auction other table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on a bad day they get their heart ruff in the short trump hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|lml: the only way to go down is 2H a heart ruff and ducking the club return|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk4: The winning team will be USA1 in the Venice Cup (women's World Championships) in Brazil in late August/early September. The loser will get another chance against the winning team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: of a playoff match between the losing semi-finalists. That team will be USA2|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lml: she has to rise on the club|pg||
nt|ady: declarer  must refuse club finesse  after the 3rd heart is ruffesed|pg||
nt|ady: ruffed|pg||
nt|othered1: as the cards lie here . . . |pg||

pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lml: I like it when players remember they are playing imps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would be the wrong play to rise with club ace if E held KJxx  of trumps, 4 diamonds and the king of clubs|pg||
mc|8|pg||
qx|o19|st||md|1ST98742HQDT7CT974,SQ5HJT87632D9CQJ3,SAKJ6HAK54DQ86CA8,S3H9DAKJ5432CK652|sv|e|nt|lml: double must show spades.|pg||
nt|lml: or their methods would be unworkable|pg||
nt|onebid: likely both|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and can double show four spades?|pg||
nt|lml: I imagine it must be 4+S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not the best of starts for NS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they need a spark very soon|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: told dbl=4/5@S, 2@H=6@S|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes S raised to 2@S in the other room for +110|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: some pairs would use a Garbage Multi 2@D for that South hand  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: not more that 4@S for N/S - 5@D less one for E/W with finesse in @D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but E/W vuln, so difficult to find the defence|pg||
nt|hlortz: hard to take vul vs non vul save over a 2nt though :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|onebid: Dbl shows 4-5 spades and 2@H shows 6 spades.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just about enough shape to make it right though|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: a treatment which I think needs support doubles, to identify the degree of fit if the auciton gets competitive   |pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: a very workable method if well discussed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oops|pg||
nt|mdgraham: "system on, partner"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many use texas to play in the majors, other use great texas|pg||
nt|hlortz: i would think 5@D would be -2 though no?|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah oops indeed!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: this it is the second time i see in hight competition the pass over a texas !|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: yes but call me old fashioned I like to bid 1S with spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it sounds most playable|pg||
nt|onebid: Berkowitz will need to shift to diamonds early|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: so better use the great texas 4@C for @H, 4@D for @S, impossible to pass :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: yes, other time last years worlds?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lml: that early enough|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|onebid: that's early!|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: no, i seen a pass few week ago|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lml: I suppose the double really is a 1@S bid |pg||
nt|mdgraham: must play club or heart now |pg||
pc|sK|pc|c5|pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: the idea is if there is room, transfers on|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: by that rule it would apply here, since 4@D available for hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can also play dbl=I would have bid that (so double here=transfer to hearts)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hlortz: some play on only thru 3@C as 3@D-4@D needed for stayman.. anyway better to have agreement|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h8|mc|9|pg||

nt|marlowepi: so awake or asleep there is something to think about|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: well, E is also eligible to remember it is IMPs, and return a club|pg||
nt|lml: she gives up a club position|pg||
nt|3for3: i dont think jo will preempt, favorable colors notwithstanding|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D multi|pg||
nt|lml: if she doesnt return a club she will beat it be force|pg||
nt|lml: interesting... no honors but sseven hearts|pg||
nt|lml: vulnerable protection|pg||
nt|3for3: plenty of honors....in other suits|pg||
nt|ady: 4@s   the limit for n/s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she will not beat it by force if N has the ten of clubs|pg||
nt|lml: so who likes 3@H|pg||
nt|3for3: or 4nt|pg||
nt|3for3: I prefer zero hearts|pg||
nt|ady: vulnerability reversed  5@D a save for e/w|pg||
nt|3for3: south must be careful in 4 spades...or north even|pg||
nt|3for3: can't ruff in, must pitch club|pg||
nt|lml: I don't mind 2@D|pg||
nt|lml: I wouldnt bid it myself because my partners hates those bids but bridge in a final is about pressure|pg||
nt|lml: passing doesn't create pressure|pg||
nt|3for3: north south are playing option 2 vs mutli|pg||
nt|lml: if you bid 3@H in second chair at these colors you are Marty Bergen|pg||
nt|3for3: double is the 'book' bid for north|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|3for3: double is 13-16 or any strong hand|pg||
nt|lml: well it qualifies as that for sure.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: fyi, the dbl was fastr, the pass was slow|pg||
nt|lml: pass here shows diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: but maybe not quite as good ass this|pg||
nt|reisig: They opened 2@s in other room and went down in 4@s|pg||
nt|lml: 2@S by South is below my level ... |pg||
nt|reisig: Both are ...well...not so good|pg||
nt|ady: should not go down      did not discard a club on 3rd diamond?|pg||
nt|reisig: This match will be CLOSE...in a minute|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what they play 3@D as over the double.  Likely diamonds|pg||
nt|3for3: let's hope so.|pg||
nt|lml: And maybe not forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: multi by W has the advantage that you are more likely to score your spade queen. however, i have a strong aversion to 2-level openings with seven-card suits. that sentiment is far ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: from universal though |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|cindy:  e/w has a @d partial|pg||
nt|lml: I have passed with the South hand before this thinking 2@D was not game but Sprung is more disciplined|pg||
nt|3for3: 3@H must be a transfer?|pg||
nt|reisig: Jo was trying to remember the notes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wouldnt be tempted to defend 2DX when we might be cold for 7S|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H?|pg||
nt|henryb: Sorry to be late|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Henry|pg||
nt|3for3: hi henry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome henry|pg||
nt|ady: hi Henry|pg||
nt|reisig: Henry  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: N and S both reading defense to multi notes for long time, N now outside asking director question|pg||
nt|reisig: does the director know the notes|pg||
nt|3for3: probably not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: can he carry a tune?|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: what is 3@h?|pg||
nt|3for3: this will likely get NS past the last plus on the hand.|pg||
nt|lml: North Americans are unfamiliar with Multi.  THe problem with the notes is they don't take you far enough into the auction|pg||
nt|ady: seems very easy going  to be able to look at system notes during the game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is a defense, not their own system notes|pg||
nt|henryb: If East starts three rounds of diamonds, North can make 4@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but all pairs competing for the honor of playing in a world championship would do well to come to the table ready for multi, which is so widely played |pg||
nt|lml: or a heart|pg||
nt|henryb: In fact 4@s is cold, isn't it? on any defense?|pg||
nt|reisig: I think ..North wants to cue bid 4@h :)|pg||
nt|ady: and widely played for m any years|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hlortz: ew can make more @D than NS can @S but may not get in the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: In North America if they are playing multi then you are allowed to read your defense or the defense provided|pg||
nt|lml: strange as that may seem to the Europeans who are asking me.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: I would have balanced with East, but it is close and not unreasonable to pass|pg||
nt|hlortz: inhibited by vulnerablility perhaps|pg||
nt|othered1: Fine auction|pg||
nt|3for3: well, they seemed to dodge that bullet|pg||
nt|reisig: now ..just make it|pg||
nt|henryb: Now she just has to make it|pg||
nt|3for3: i like cheapest minor to be a cuebid over multi too|pg||
nt|lml: The spectators are pointing out something that we have been writing in our blog|pg||
nt|3for3: not sure it is in the published defense|pg||
nt|lml: North Americans will have to play against Multi without notes in Brazil|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: sprung states, 3h showed invite or better in spades|pg||
nt|lml: They should start now|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|henryb: or by the fact that partner, an aggressive opener, was a passed hand|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|hlortz: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club discrad on 3rd D does the trick|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|h7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: Well we know Goldberg is awake|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|othered1: But Goldberg isn't playing this|pg||
nt|ady: both tables failed|pg||
nt|reisig: Danny ...don't look!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb: same bad play made by Baker in the other room.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lml: they played it from the asleep side apparently|pg||
nt|lml: Sprung didn't count her tricks|pg||

pc|sK|pc|d2|pc|s4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c2|pc|s7|nt|othered1: @C pitch loses when east has all three spaces, so ruffing isn't a zero play|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|othered1: spades, not spaces|pg||
nt|reisig: If W has KQJ of @c  ..still OK ....:)|pg||
nt|lml: Michael Rosenberg put it this way (thanks Michael) she should have said "how can I make if West has the @SQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you mean if W is 6-6?|pg||
mc|9|nt|henryb: seems unlikely in the extreme that West has 12 cards in hearts and clubs|pg||

nt|bridge_one: the important is not play in the bad major .. all system are ok, the best choise must be automatic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not the sort of result to cheer up team-mates|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally big pair training in difficult hands, so possible they don't remember the more easy gadgets|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: 1@c Precision|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this must be strong @C|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: yes, EW Presision pair.|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 3 or 4 @S with East ? not more value about initial Dbl - of course depending on agreements|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|onebid: odd not to rebid 2@D|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: West could bid 4@D as pick-a-major - but then the lead is coming through the @DKJ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: matter of style - some like to support with three cards |pg||
nt|lml: I had a question about how you can play internationally for more than 1 country|pg||
nt|onebid: yes, but strong enough playing Precision to bid 2@S if partner prefers to 2@H|pg||
nt|lml: Apparently Migry Zur has played for Israel before|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, can rebid 2@d, and then 2@s if partner bids 2@H|pg||
nt|lml: She has always played for Israel|pg||
nt|lml: My understanding is that you have to stop playing for the other country for 2 years|pg||
pc|h2|nt|onebid: Can that really be true?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I believe Balicki-Zmudzinski are transferring from Poland to Russia |pg||
nt|lml: Glasson does have a lovely max playing Precision and ruffs|pg||
nt|onebid: right Mike|pg||
nt|lml: yes so that have to take a holiday for a while to qualify|pg||
nt|onebid: I doubt 2 years|pg||
nt|lml: I recall that Gavin Wolpert told me that.  He is switching from Canada to the US|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, 2@S is better - need to be the declarer|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|marlowepi: that's what partners are for....to let us know|pg||
nt|lml: what happens to me in this situations is I think about it, figure it out and try to forget it ... not always so well|pg||
nt|othered1: Pointed out by scotty, @C ruffing won't make last hand if @S were all off.|pg||
nt|ady: this likely to be flat    4@S|pg||
nt|lml: we will get to see their methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right Ed, but he is used to playing with Zia, who opens weak 2s with 6-6. most of us donty|pg||
nt|lml: except Goldberg is going to bid|pg||
nt|henryb: declarer could not make it if East had @sQxx, always 4 losers, so should worry about losing to @sQ in West|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lml: I find that opening a strong club causes everyone to jump in no matter what|pg||
mb|d!|nt|marlowepi: if E had all three spades, he has a stiff club, so ruffing the diamond does make on an elimination i think|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: i mean if W really is 6-6|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|henryb: really?. maybe West has 7 hearts in that case|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but then maybe 3H more likely. in  any case, singleton spade queen is a zillion times more likely|pg||
nt|reisig: this auction may not be over|pg||
nt|lml: 5@D isn't terrible|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bidding 3D then 5D is, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: Interesting. I would have thought West strong enough to bid 2@d and then 2@s over a 2@h preference|pg||
nt|cindy:  agree|pg||
nt|cindy:  this plays pretty well|pg||
mb|4N|nt|henryb: But Karen operates very much on the KISS principle with Lynn|pg||
nt|cindy:  a heart to the 8 eventually |pg||
nt|hlortz: s might well put up Q@H on a @H toward dummy trying to look like KQ|pg||
nt|ady: might get out for down 1 in 5@D|pg||
nt|3for3: joann wasnt thinking i bet|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i back your bet|pg||
mb|5C|nt|3for3: she bids the limit of the hand right away as a matter of style|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: I think you duck a club, win the spade, ruff a club and play top diamonds|pg||

nt|marlowepi: so that we dont get sleepy|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|ady: should not be difficult to reach|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you mean she won;t bid exclusion and then the grand?|pg||
nt|3for3: an opening bid opposite a strong 2.  |pg||
nt|lml: It should be fast and furious to 6|pg||
nt|othered1: Chance for NS to get to a better contract and pick up imps with 6N|pg||

mb|2C|nt|cindy:  hmm|pg||
nt|stewball: well thats one solution....|pg||
nt|stewball: at these colors i would mind watching for 1 round of the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|stewball: who knows maybe N has the minors|pg||
nt|henryb: I think 1N is a reasonable solution for that hand, probably better than 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: although if they dont cash ace, they dont get it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wimps. exclusion and then the grand. an immediate 13 IMPs then 30 more on psychological carryover|pg||
nt|3for3: not easy to exclude in partner's first bid suit|pg||

nt|marlowepi: danny your glass is always half empty :(....|pg||

mb|4C!|nt|cindy:  well  it wont make W  fall in love with her hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: well its clearly better than 2@c imo|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@c self KC.|pg||
nt|henryb: I got none, pard|pg||
nt|othered1: reasonable to take control, even if it might make 6N less easy tofind.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she is asking herself for keycards?|pg||
nt|3for3: something like that|pg||
nt|henryb: Oh; I fot 4 with the Q|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|henryb: and our good partner bids 2@h and not 2@s|pg||
nt|henryb: got|pg||
nt|henryb: 5@c is I forgot?|pg||
nt|lml: I don't think Goldberg plays that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or it shows a full house|pg||
nt|lml: this could be a problem|pg||
nt|lml: a big problem|pg||
nt|3for3: jo knows that wasn't kc, so hopefully will assume partner has no ace, no cuebid|pg||
nt|henryb: nah. It is an impossible response|pg||
nt|lml: the problem is Sprung can't ask for the diamond ace now|pg||
nt|lml: and if she has to guess she will probably guess wrong|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i doubt it|pg||
nt|othered1: Our rule used to be that jumps to 6N either were right or warned that the wheels had come off.  Would, luckily, work well here|pg||
mb|5H|nt|hlortz: good that the @C finesse is off otherwise might make too many|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: so partner obviously thought it set trump and asted for a cue, and did not show @dA|pg||
nt|lml: maybe they know what they are doing and we don't|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 4C is taken as natural, the jump in a 2-1 auction should demand a cuebid|pg||
nt|henryb: this is dangerous|pg||
nt|othered1: very|pg||
nt|marlowepi: henry and i saying same thing in somewhat different ways|pg||
nt|henryb: partner might think you have @c and @h|pg||
nt|lml: if she knows that Goldberg doesn't have the @DA she would have just bid the slam|pg||
nt|lml: she doesn't know|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right, but when N bids 6C she is going to pass|pg||
nt|henryb: and when North passes she will pass out|pg||
nt|lml: at least Goldberg knows that 5@H is some kind of grand slam try|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|lml: it can be nothing else so she should cuebid an ace if she has one|pg||
nt|lml: Sprung will give up|pg||
nt|lml: I think|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|henryb: I would bid 6N|pg||
nt|othered1: atransfer to 6N?|pg||
nt|lml: another grand slam try|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trying for 8|pg||
nt|3for3: clever, she is begging for ace of d, and will end in 6nt?|pg||
nt|henryb: or 6@s to get partner to bid 7 with the @dA|pg||
nt|othered1: getting to the perfect spot at last possible call?|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|lml: she hopes that Goldberg will bid 7@C with the @da and she can play 6NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: good recovery by Sprung|pg||
nt|3for3: whewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: jo has been shaking her head for 10 min|pg||
nt|lml: they can right up that auction and look at it later|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i must say it is very unselfish holding that S hand to work so hard for N to play it|pg||
nt|othered1: If 4@C had been natural and forcing, this would have been a correct auction.|pg||
nt|lml: I don't know if under pressure I could have done as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: jo now informing opp 4c is rkc|pg||
nt|henryb: In case partner had QJ KQJx KJxxx Jx and this protects the @dK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 4C were nat & forcing, then 5C denied the ace of D and they would be in 6 an hour ago|pg||
nt|lml: She bid it this way to try to force a cuebid after partner didn't read the KC bid|pg||
nt|lml: She figured it was her only chance to get to the grand and I think she did great|pg||
nt|henryb: Palmer might find the @d lead on this auction|pg||

nt|othered1: oops|pg||
nt|3for3: 15-17 throughout|pg||
nt|othered1: Do they upgrade to 1N frequently?|pg||
nt|3for3: jo was close to an upgrade, but she and connie play it has to be a great 14...|pg||
nt|henryb: that is a Great 14|pg||
nt|lml: I agree with Henry|pg||
nt|lml: how much greater can you get|pg||
nt|lml: she only has two spot cards really|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm rarely an upgrader, b ut would consider it here with those nice 10 & 9s|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|othered1: Then would open 1@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|henryb: kidding|pg||

nt|othered1: Did Connie have a way to distinguish 4 trumps from 3?|pg||

nt|ady: the A10@D doubleton very helpful for declarer  cannot really go down|pg||
nt|lml: However whatever she does on the lie of the cards she will make it|pg||
nt|lml: for that reason|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb: If we are going to play a partial, these diamonds should be trump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wouldn;t worry about the spade holding. unlikely that it will matter on offense and it is just one maybe defensive trick. meanwhile, it enhances our likelihood of scoring it on ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: defence|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if pd lacks the D ace, one tap in dummy kills the board. lopsided hands almost always play best in the long suit|pg||
nt|hlortz: in the other room NS sounded so strong that they escaped being doubled in 5@S|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|lml: she might play diamonds fairly early|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||

nt|lml: she doesnt know about the @DA10|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: but i would certainly bid 3H as a lead director as W. N could easily be about to bid spades, with a void in diamonds while S holds the ace. then D lead allows N to pitch what might ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: be the crucial loser|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lml: this is a reasonable line|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|henryb: KISS Marshall. Also, bidding 4@d stops the 3@s bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this would be a very karen-like call, so must conclude they are not playing thjat as a lead director (though i would have bet they were)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: declarer just pulled a wrong card|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i regard 3H as KISS, Henry. it keeps the defense simple|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: director having hard time with ruling|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N had a hard bid over 3H. without club ten, i think 4H semi-clear. club ten complicates things. but if S actually huddled (as well she might) over 3D, then i would bid 4H as N|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|3for3: brb switching computers|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in answer to questions from specs about why i would choose 4H if S huddled over 3H, it is for bend-over-backward ethical reasons|pg||
nt|reisig: I've heard that excuse before|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the most likely reason for a huddle by S over 3H is that she has some club help and was thinking of bidding 3NT|pg||

nt|othered1: aupgrading to a 14-16 opening?|pg||
mb|3C!|an|alerted |mb|p|nt|onebid: they play Precision|pg||
mb|3D|an|relay|mb|p|nt|onebid: and she has 3 tens|pg||

nt|othered1: card says 14-16 in this position.  10-12 favorable 1-2-3 pos. 15-17 4th.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt is a bid made to play Nt fron the right site|pg||

nt|onebid: close enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well, 3NT should go clattering off|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 3@C for any pairs isn't forcing - for N/S instead is forcing of course|pg||
mb|4H|nt|othered1: Nice to have that double available|pg||
nt|hlortz: will get too high....|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C or 3@H by South after 3@D|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 3@H my choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: especially if 1! D-3@C is invitational|pg||
nt|hlortz: er 1@D-3@C|pg||

mb|4N|nt|lml: that makes sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: arggh this is not a blackwood hand|pg||
mb|5S|mb|d|nt|bridge_one: 4Nt i think natural, non encouraging bid (otherwise North could havbe the possibility to make a cuebid|pg||

nt|reisig: This is not the hand for ace asking|pg||
nt|henryb: you can't go slamming when partner can open that hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|marlowepi: having the ace of your suit means you shd generally not preempt to the max|pg||
nt|henryb: that is an interesting theory|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|marlowepi: also the S hand has a LOT of losers, and stiff heart king is a better defensive than offensive value|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, partner hasn;t PROMISED the hand is this bad|pg||

nt|marlowepi: slam still live on vienna coup double squeeze|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb: declarer here has 6 winners. to me that means you preempt 3, not 4 at equal vulnerability|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: lots of exceptions, and i typed it a bit quickly. what i mean is that when you are deciding between, say, 3 & 4, having the ace is a liability for the more aggressive preempt|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hlortz: the fortunate lie lets declarer out for down 2 but the opponents cant really make anything|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@d seems about their maximum|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another point is that your suit is spades, and 3S may do all the preempting that needs to be done--4S might just force the opps ionto a winning decision. meanwhile, if opps bid 4H ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over yr 3S, partner will be very well placed to make the winning decision|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|c5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|d3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|henryb: she actually can make it from there: @dA and eight rounds of clubs would provide a double squeeze|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hlortz: yes here 3@S might get the opponents overboard via dbl from west|pg||
nt|lml: no you cant|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: I must be blind; I can't see it|pg||
nt|henryb: but I suppose the diamond finesse looked like a better shot|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: Deas just keeps the @HQ and the S!J|pg||
nt|lml: she doesnt need to keep diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb: @hK, @dA, @cAK and 6 more clubs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hlortz: interestingly here W would double any   of spades 1, 2, 3 or 4|pg||
nt|henryb: In the other room Sanborn bid a quiet 1@s and subsided. E-W playing 3@d|pg||
nt|henryb: bidding 3@s would probably get you a plus score against 4@d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S preempts against us are among our worst bidding nightmares. whenever 3N is a possibility you have to commit immediately. and of course there are other ways that 3S can be ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: awkward. too many balls in play and no room to explore. but when they bid 4S u just shrug & double. something it is not best double-dummy, but the agony factor is minimized. that ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is another reason why in general 3S is a better tactical weapon that 4S on these "borderline" preempot hands|pg||
nt|henryb: they taking a break?|pg||
nt|henryb: 1 hour 10 minutes for 8 boards is not breaking any speed records|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes but faster than yesterday when they had played 6 boards in 1 hr 20 min|pg||
nt|cindy:  was super slo mo|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the cards were stuck together?|pg||
nt|cindy:  20 min to play a part score for an overtrick was a little much|pg||
nt|henryb: Beth Palmer took 16 minutes to play a card yesterday|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i can see opening 2C if playing a forcing club. but 3C seems like trying to hit a vanishingly narrow target|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   hav e a save in 4@S       north opened 3@C  in OR  so n/s never contested in spades   but e/w pushed thenselves to the 5 levedl  and a spade lead beat the contract|pg||

mb|3C|nt|hlortz: both pairs passed up the weak 4 card @S suit,,,|pg||
nt|cindy:  this could be doomed|pg||
nt|henryb: when South chooses to surpress the spades there is no way to find the suit|pg||
nt|cindy:  tough to find @d switch i guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am quite certain that at the table i would open 1S with that hand|pg||
nt|hlortz: seems like someone ought to bid the @S suit....|pg||
nt|henryb: It is hard after N opens 1@d|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: different points of view. for me it is the hand with 100 honors that is responsible for mentioning spades, not the hand with four small, when the latter has AKQxxx of another suit|pg||
nt|hlortz: 7@H lead because of weak suit. they probably play attitude vs NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: But was a most interesting contract which could have been made after a low club lead|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: 4@H is the superior game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4H is interesting too|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  well  this looks like a hand where you need to get your tricks quickly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i prefer 3S over 3C unless that would show club support|pg||
nt|lml: 4@H is not as "interesting" as 4@S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: 3NT is also interesting|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: Q@D lead seems best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: am not a fan of the spade lead from that holding. the major suit holdings in the N hand suggest a passive defense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would probably lead a club, through dummy;s shorter suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamond will be ducked and helps declarer establish dummy;s long suit|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|henryb: perhaps 3rd from even?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont really understand the queen of hearts play holding four|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes could be 3rd/even tho more common vs suits than NT...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Vugraphu8: baker accidentally led 7 hts instead of 5, they play 4th best|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah thanks|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: mccallum says she would have shifted to diam if correct ht had been led|pg||

nt|Vugraphu5: we had a small break here|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: back in the gamenow|pg||

nt|othered1: 1 sound @D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Yes, a fine presentation|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone prefer 1@D?  I do, if allowed by my agreements|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not for West|pg||
nt|bridge_one: :)))|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lml: 3@D will be it I still think|pg||
nt|lml: if you bid 1@D you will still probably end up bidding 3@D over 3@C|pg||
nt|othered1: Not much choice for west, who certainly can't bring majors back into consideration.  |pg||
nt|onebid: I think it's a difficult choice and partnership agreements make the difference. I can't criticize either|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rather decent of East to hold @SQ10x|pg||
nt|lml: if Moss bids 4@C here she might push Glasson|pg||
nt|lml: but why would she?|pg||
nt|onebid: that would be a serious overbid by Moss|pg||
nt|othered1: make 5@D with a red suit lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|lml: and we get to where we knew we were headed from the start|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: now baker says she needs to stop sorting her hand, so she will play right cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to shift when you dont win ace at trick one. and hard to see how a lead of the heart five would change the defense|pg||
nt|hlortz: dont think such a comment good for partnership morale...|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|lml: the dreaded multi has come up a lot|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: awwwww|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the E treatment of Multi is apparently "i have MULTIple aces"|pg||
nt|lml: Goldberg is worried that Sprung will take 2@S wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I was away when this was played in the open room, so I did not have the chance to comment on the weak 2. I dislike it. No-one can make be pre-empt at the 2-level with 2 aces, but ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: if it's their style, fine with me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially fine with me if they play against me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H opening at my table too -- in Playoff match|pg||
nt|lml: 3@S |pg||
nt|robinswr: i like the style. preempts win |pg||
nt|lml: maybe 4@S is best ... just go for it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially when all you remember is the good results :)|pg||
nt|lml: of course there is the uncertainty of what suit Palmer has|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2aces outside 4-card majors all ok with me|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the other room West was quiet from start to finish; that's not winning bridge in my book|pg||
nt|robinswr: i think 3spades is a cuebid in support of hearts|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S making a poor result for Maricuso in OR     difficult defence to beat it    but e/w should play 5 of a minor    likely down 1|pg||
nt|lml: everyone thinks 4@s is a splinter and 3@s is a cuebid|pg||
nt|3for3:  4@d should be the cuebid|pg||
nt|onebid: not everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: not finals. Glasson tm is 109/7 in 1st playoff|pg||
nt|robinswr: sprung should have passed and found out opener's suit|pg||
nt|lml: lots of specs.  Goldberg and Sprung are unfamiliar with multi and I think this is making it worse|pg||
mb|3H|nt|reisig: was a joke ...I'm sure|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: They had better prepare a defence then, because they will see a lot of Multi's in Brazil|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk4: The winning team will be USA1 in the Venice Cup (women's World Championships) in Brazil in late August/early September. The loser will get another chance against the winning team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: of a playoff match between the losing semi-finalists. That team will be USA2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: now Goldberg is thinking thank you for not passing out 3@H|pg||
nt|robinswr: would goldberg lead a club from K98|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Should she have dropped the stiff kong on that lead? Not sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: king even|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stiff King Kong? Fay Wray in this event?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lml: Dropping the stiff king is out of my league|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|mc|10|nt|robinswr: when they make that lead the king should be dropped|pg||

nt|onebid: 8 spades?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: fourteen on top|pg||
nt|othered1: LOts and lots of tricks here and 7 should be attainable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't remember such a set on BBO before with so many dead-flat boards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nine!|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lml: it would be a lot more interesting if East was the dealer|pg||
nt|onebid: Xfer then GSF|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N and north probably won't let go, if she can find little @D wastage in south's hand.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: but that is just it, most of them where not necissarily flat|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hlortz: glasson team likes flat boards ; moss not so much|pg||
nt|bridge_one: nine perfectly flat boards arn't frequently|pg||
nt|fabsayc: easily 100 imps either way|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|an|alerted by N, not by S|nt|hlortz: yes many swings possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@H for N/S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mnay would have been tempted to open as South|pg||
mb|4H|nt|othered1: GSF?  Couldn't they be off an ace?|pg||
nt|lml: exclusion blackwood|pg||
nt|lml: is my thinking|pg||
nt|onebid: yes - need agreements on responses|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a useful tool here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would open, for example :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|onebid: you'd have to put a gun to my head to get me to play that hideous convention|pg||
nt|lml: the double makes Migry's decision easier|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't like double - gives the opponents so much more room - two extra  bids (pass and redouble) |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: as it turns out regular blackwood will show you all the KC|pg||
nt|othered1: XX part of a convensional set of responses?|pg||
nt|othered1: conventional|pg||
nt|lml: if 5@d is KC then redouble is probably ROPI|pg||
nt|onebid: 1st round control my guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: aces are good |pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 4@H for sure .... NOT !|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|othered1: I've seen these confused by top pairs, though they shouldn't be.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i thought South would choise 4@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: she may wish she had done|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D in 3th position can be weaker that a normal open|pg||
nt|fabsayc: third seat opener syndrome|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: this may be 10 more to Glasson|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the 4@H response took up quite a bit of room too   |pg||
nt|lml: it always looks easier when you are not playing the hand|pg||
nt|onebid: It's for that reason I so dislike exclusion - so many disasters!|pg||
nt|othered1: did something go wrong with system or is this just a very conservative decision by north?|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: sorry answering spectator|pg||
nt|onebid: I guess the former|pg||
nt|lml: I think the redouble showed the first step|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I would put money on system - if 5@D is erkcb, then North can bid 5N for side kings - South bids 6@C |pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: redouble was the wrong answer as per Silvia|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think north could have made decision to play 6 so quickly if there was solid ageement on sequence |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|onebid: well, Sylvia may have mis-answered, but it happens way too often|pg||
