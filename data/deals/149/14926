nt|Walddk2: Giv Nord Vests 98 i hjerter, QJ98, så er 3NT lidt bedre. På den anden side, det betaler sig sjældent at masterminde, når man har fundet en 4-4 fit i major|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Gary, evening, I guess?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|vugraphzpa: 1@c = 16+ any distribution|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: or 4@S possibly|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: they probably won't reach 6@S - even relay precision methods aren't usually geared to finding a 4-2 fit at the 6-level  |pg||

pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm this duck has allowed declarer to make what looked like an impossible contract on the heart lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in England many pairs use 2@C...2NT as invitational in NT, not necessarily showing a four card major. NS obviously treat it differently  |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: Hi Gary, Bas|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s2|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: here as in NZ it guaranteed a major|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|ady: not a good slam    apart from maybe having to guess where to try for thr 12th trick it needs diamonds to behave|pg||

nt|andyv:  ok|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes Bas 8pm Thurs here more rain forceast|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  hi Bas|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Bas, Gary and Sven-Olov|pg||
nt|andyv:  and welcome specs|pg||
nt|andyv:  first board very exciting|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and a board passed by :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think I've seen a pass out on first board yet|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: several @S's available EW|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  easy to compare with|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: altho 3N was an easier contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: In the NL it's not uncommon to play 1NT-2@C ; 2@H-2@S as invitational without 4@S and 2NT as invitational with 4@S, so that a @S contract can still be played from the NT opener's ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this board won't go to far in the bidding either|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: not sure if that is the case here, obviously|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree, David...not a great slam but to not even sniff it out seems conservative|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think the slam is a decent proposition. they might well lead a suit that resolves the guess for you|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: playing precision all 1-level openings are limited up to 15 hcp|pg||
nt|lestergold: very costly duck|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|andyv:  1@D xfer to @hs|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  EW play 5542, probably with unbalanced 1@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that's catching on here also|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  1@D shows hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with @CK on side it is quite makeable so could be a swing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: playable. In the UK lots of pairs play weak NT, so who becomes declarer is less of a consideration|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  N wants to bid 2@d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: different if it is a strong NT, of course|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Right|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: I guess I'll see next week, I'll be arriving in Brighton on Monday :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: Brighton congress?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: no probs here as cards lie|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: yes, starting this weekend|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|andyv:  N was able to show both minors.. S not interested|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: gl all taking part|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: with the 3-3 spade break declarer can afford the safety play of K@C   and club to the ace and be rewarded with an overtrick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not the optimum spot for anyone either|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: except ew|pg||
nt|andyv:  but it looks like it will play well|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzpa: with @h ace shown in N... then @c Q must be in S for the DBL ..or?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  with 4 trump, S might have tried a forcing game but doesn't know if @s or @d is best lead|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one thing I am quite proud of was winning the Brighton pairs in 1975, the last time it was a proper pairs event. Been a Swiss pairs ever since|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NZ Nationals 24 September - it's mine and the events 25th, not many have been to all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Where is Brighton I am asked. In southern England in the county of Sussex|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on the South Coast. Two piers, one functional and the other not....|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I don't mean to advertise, but I will anyway :) I'm still looking for a p for Brighton :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and a nice beach town in Canterbury New Zealand where I grew up|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, Englishmen were very good at picking names for newly founded settlement|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not that "New Amsterdam" was particularly hard, but hey|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: diasgree with messing about here should enter dummy and finesse spade immediately|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: yes, and some length expected too, so probably will startt the suit by leading the knave|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or New York|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: gl getting a pard Bas, our Brighton only had one pier|pg||

nt|vugraphzpa: S is thinking |pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d may gain 3 imps|pg||
nt|ady: would look silly if A@s was onside and 3NT makes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N could make if no smith echos in effect|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N is the most practical|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: choice of 7's|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|an|4+!D|nt|andyv:  N will at least invite|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: imaginative mike:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: no lead woud let this thru of course|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: With Andy on this one|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Though I am unsure how to look for Slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe won't get to game but N has to at least invite|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mdgraham: won't be easy...North will win the spade and might play clubs|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in which case East might figure that West needs either @SQ or @hA to beat this|pg||
nt|andyv:  I have parteners who like to see if I can make one more too.|pg||
nt|andyv:  N has to guess now to play @cs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry for silly remark above. i was multi-tasking and has spade ten and jack interchanged|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and from East's point of view, he might not be able to afford to duck the club |pg||
nt|ady: how can west have Q@S   would have surely played it at trick 1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: lots of science here|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes see last comment|pg||
nt|roswolf: i must say that bidding 4@S is unattractive but i agree it seems the normal bid|pg||
mb|3S!|an|5251|nt|kiwibridge: will it lead somewhere|pg||
nt|mdgraham: whether it will prove efficacious, we will have to wait and see|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D!|an|10-13 HCP|nt|mdgraham: 2@c=GF, 2@h=shape and so on|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: W has shown 5241 with a minimum, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but West played @S10, so North is marked with @SQ....so West needs @HA |pg||
nt|lestergold: east is fixed cannot pass cannopt double is barraged into bidding 4|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, just bid 4N over 2@s|pg||
mb|4H!|an|Aceasking|nt|kiwibridge: hi Henri :)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 7N gets the top marks|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C!|nt|andyv:  options are limited|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and now East needs to work that out...no problem |pg||
mb|5S|nt|andyv:  hi Henri:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: downsides of not bidding are too great like 4@h making when 4@s is cold|pg||

nt|roswolf: looks like a certain -2|pg||
mb|7D|nt|kiwibridge: need to know the @C is Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: spec thinks N should bid only 2N. perhaps so, but 3N puts more pressure on opps and is less revealing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: still any grand is a good one usually|pg||

nt|andyv:  3N the best game here|pg||
nt|garnetts: they should just about bid this to 5@C --the spade response will encourage east|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|andyv:  declarer will need to play at least one round of @ss before tackling @ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: no entry with the long diamonds  so 3NT safe n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20 hcp division scope for someone going overboard|pg||
mb|1S|nt|garnetts: not that easy to make though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West would have had to open 2@C if he had wanted to open the last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well very tame outcome|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks dodgy|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|mdgraham: 1NT=clubs?|pg||
nt|garnetts: INT show clubs I suppose|pg||
nt|garnetts: What do youn bid if you want to bid 1NT?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@C?|pg||
nt|garnetts: if you see what I mean|pg||
nt|mdgraham: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ace no cost to ruff finesse the @sQ|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|andyv:  interesting evaluation.... N wouldn't even sniff out a slam on 3 but believes this hand is worth investigating.|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  N tried a natural 4NT, since he could bid 3N with 11-13|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: West led @hK - may have switched to @D, but East overtook @HA and led a club|pg||
nt|andyv:  do you think S took 4N as natural?|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  yes|pg||
nt|garnetts: just been told you bid 1NT and don't alert :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much use with screens though|pg||
nt|garnetts: you can also make 4@S because they are 3/3 and you control @Ds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 1NT showed clubs, presumably 2@C was NF?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (just guessing)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: better be relay|pg||
nt|garnetts: well 2@C is an underbid then isn't it|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: In my view, 1N is a doubtful rebid holding that honor dispersion|pg||
nt|andyv:  this lead won't scare declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps not on the lead|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  he should anyway:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|mdgraham: possible - but then, how do you play in 2@C....|pg||
nt|garnetts: suppose the same way you play in 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, the engine is revving up |pg||
mb|d|mb|4C|an|*|nt|garnetts: must have had a shot of reddex which dates me |pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|mdgraham: we are just guessing as to the EW systemic nuances. Fun to do so though|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I'm not sure what S took it... do we know what type of keycard they are playing?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: suggest 2@C was GF relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now makes 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: well I am willing to bet a natural method would have got us here five minutes ago|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: agree, thats the down side of relay methods, you have to go thru the motions|pg||
nt|garnetts: not sure how to play this to be honest--neither will dec be--so this could take a while|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1N both ways for 5 imps to Garys Boys|pg||
nt|garnetts: spade discard and a club has its attractions |pg||
pc|s6|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: on 18, now they are on the grand|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|andyv:  it looked to me like S took it as straight old fashioned blackwood and showed his one ace.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Vugraphznk: It doesn't say much but neither bid was alerted|pg||
nt|andyv:  if ace asking it would not be alertable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: by sheer luck reaches a making contract when most would play 3N|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: With screens it is, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  both make so no loss|pg||
nt|andyv:  and actually 5@d may be a little easier|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  he can still go down in this one|pg||
nt|andyv:  thinking of finessing for J@s, Sven?|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  NS is not a regular partnership, NE is and SW was as juniors|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, S should have asked E what N's bid meant.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 13 boards, deficit 48. Still possible|pg||

nt|ady: sorry   misread the play     heart was played to the 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: Konow is back ... |pg||
nt|lestergold: south would raise to game of course|pg||
nt|andyv:  defense was difficult but NS could not afford to break the @s suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: flushed with success can they reach the failing @H game|pg||
nt|garnetts: an odd decision|pg||
nt|garnetts: why bid a suit when you have a nine card fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's an old story - to make game in a suit you have to bid that suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the 4 card @S resp was raised with 3 odd|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|vugraphzpa: 1 nt = 12-15 in this position|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats a 7 card fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. not as good as a 5/4 fit, but better than a 4/2 |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w on 18 missed the non-vul game in the other room for a loss of 6 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: it is so easy then u see alle cards - not so easy for N over 3@D|pg||
nt|garnetts: odd that west did not make any sort of try--very chunky nine count|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: a far better opener than last time|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why he went to the 3 level... well, actually, his pd did...|pg||

nt|mdgraham: opportunistic double of 3NT in the CR - certainly paid dividends|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: a 1 or4 hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: well bid  |pg||

nt|andyv:  this looks like it should make 4@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: last two hands have squashed the rally|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: "I forgot they played strong @c-system" Østergaard said|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if ever there was a 10-count that looked like a weak NT, that North hand does |pg||
nt|roswolf: slam possible here - might be difficult to bid though|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@h on the spade ace|pg||
nt|garnetts: conservative I mean :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite so|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|tjolpe:  yes, it's a good clue|pg||
nt|santyclz: Someone said (and I am not necessily endorsing this viewpoint)...|pg||
nt|garnetts: thats a decent 12 count for a flat hand|pg||
mb|2S|an|Weak !S|mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: yes, tens and things|pg||
nt|santyclz: If you are not liberal when you are young, you have no heart.  If you are not conservative when you are old you have no brain.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: much better than the last hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: lol Joe|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: look like 4@S can make unless south leads a top club and underleads at trick 2  for a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass?|pg||
nt|roswolf: support double may be good now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@d maybe easier to manage of course and also K@s protected|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  defense should be clear in 4@s.... S plays A or K@c, N plays Q and S plays 2@c for @d ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
nt|garnetts: I certainly endorse that--but the conservative bits hurts more|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: south will drive to slam now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  otherwise, 4 makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: one slam is dodgy the otyher excellent|pg||
nt|lestergold: both make here|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, for reasons of a-politicality (if that's a word) I refrain from expressing any opinion about the quote.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tjolpe:  a good sacrifice against 4 hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: man overboard again |pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: That's how they defended in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: correct defence  CR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: jack seems an odd choice|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: again this situation with QJx ... in the first half NS had the same situation with 109x |pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: do S know the @s-control?|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont see why he should|pg||
nt|roswolf: blackwood has caused a problem|pg||
nt|pelu: D = 3 card @H - 3@C ok, but why 41D by N and not 3@s??|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair question - but if north doesnt have a spade control his opening bid would be very thin|pg||
nt|pelu: give him @cK and not @sk|pg||
nt|pelu: even with @sQ (not K) N has a 1@D opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think W is more likely to have @CK than N, but as you say, 3@S would've prevented this issue|pg||
nt|roswolf: i suppose he could have QJx of spades and a void club but then he would habe cued 4@C perhaps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The question is, could he have a 4@D bid without @SK|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is what south has to decide|pg||
nt|roswolf: he is a world class player|pg||
nt|pelu: can he have @SK and bid 4@D :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: depends on how practised this partnership is|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol yes Peter|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's a valid argument as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is where i wish we had a running commentary on south's thoughts|pg||
nt|andyv:  this doesn't come close|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: since the spade suit is out of the equation --you could use 3S to show four hearts and 3@C  as weak|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|ady: let it through|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: well this seems to be a mega tank|pg||
nt|roswolf: good decision|pg||
nt|lestergold: but arrived at best spot well done|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  S will need a scissor's coup to hold it to down 1 on @d switch|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  E did it for him... not sure why E didn't return the @d...he knows W has 3@hs|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: I don't understand the jack unless they play Peter Lund's method where it promises one higher. Then we are in the same situation. I don't think they do, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: they do not !|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently not if S shifted|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: and they used the short break between the two sections to discus it |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  and S read the J@c as asking for a @h shift|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzpa: must be tired .. I assume|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how could it mean that when N never showed clubs?|pg||
nt|andyv:  they can't be... they are juniors|pg||

nt|mdgraham: the boards have been quite flat this set|pg||
nt|santyclz: Roth-Stone weak 2?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kiwibridge: E breaks the rules again|pg||
nt|andyv:  multi strikes again|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Some play 3@S as 1354 or 1345. This hand is perfect for it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a common treatment is a 3S response, both minors with 3 cards in other major. very useful when you often open 1NT with a 5 card major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When you get a 3NT rebid, you can forget about it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry roland was typing while you were expoiunding|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least no excitement for declarer on this one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or 3@H=4@D5@c and 3@S=5@D4@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  I prefer to show the frag rather than the splinter.. much more difficult for opps to dbl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they are going to lead yr short suit whatever you do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and bidding the stiff lets partner declare|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but more of a guess when pd can't dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Or you could play 2@S as MSS|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Minor Suit Stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: Houston ... We have a problem .......|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N must have shown shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  that seems to be going by the wayside with 4 suit transfers lately|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh dear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unsound bidding by North I think it's fair to say|pg||
nt|andyv:  ah, my type of bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think N realizes that they are way behind... only reason for that bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: Østergaard did not alert 3@c ... and I guess he might have taken it for a @c suit inviting to 3nt .... I am sure Mads meant it to be something else|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: But as you might know .... NS is not a regular partnership !|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the last few boards have all gone wrong :(|pg||
nt|ady: Q@D  instead of Q@S   then good contract      even J@D  would give play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all the more reason to keep methods simple|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6N would be cold if E had the diamond length|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: I guess Østergaard might move it to 6nt ...... but he takes his time before deciding what to do.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is cold if W won't ruff any of N's clubs |pg||
nt|pelu: East played @HA - and alle over - now a @H-ruff in dummy|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Almost the end now, so time for a few words of thanks: to our excellent operator Bas van Beijsterveldt, and to the Swedish Bridge Federation. Also to Carl Tagnarsson and Tomas ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Brenning for helping BBO to put on this broadcast.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tightens the match up nicely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks also to Gary Hanna (New Zealand), Joe Shair (USA), and David Carlisle (England) for commentary. I am Mike Graham (England). Also thanks to all spectators for some useful and ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perceptive comments. |pg||
mb|1D|nt|Vugraphznk: In about 25 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I may stay on a while :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you would think that East might have had some way to find out the ace position|pg||
mb|1H|nt|garnetts: lead directing|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thank you Mike, will you be here later on?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Carl Ragnarsson. R and T are too close together on the keyboard :( |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: 4H should come in|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Not sure, Norway at 4:00|pg||
nt|santyclz: But I had 14 points!  Didn't I have to bid?|pg||
nt|garnetts: you did Joe==anyone for double?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'll have a pint of whatever North seems to have got hold of please |pg||
nt|santyclz: That should be enough for east.|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes it beats viagra|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  @h spots sit well for N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good hand for Gazilli-ish methods|pg||
nt|pelu: 10 IMPs for Glopson on 27 - a lazy 3Nt by Fredin - 1@C - 1@S - 2@C - 3NT - and 5 @H-tricks for opp|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nice :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  smoothly moving from 5-3 fit to 4-3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and here the 4-3 is favoured over the 5-3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kiwibridge: but a helpful lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  if your side is prone to raising with 3, then you probably should support the 5 card suit when you have 3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: now ambiguity about forthcoming 4H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No ambiguity|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: if this makes the match is likely all over|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunate ending to this match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Østergaard thought 4@C is natural|pg||
nt|garnetts: not sure i am allowed to mention that before the watershed|pg||
nt|santyclz: If the 2 aces and 4-card @d support aren't enough for a x, surely the @c holding justifies one.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'm sure I don't know what you mean David|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D probably doesn't guarantee a diamond suit |pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  so did I|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: what on earth is happening here|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 rounds of spades does it|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: well, this is unfortunate. A pity for NS. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: see my profile for the answer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: which is the next line spoken by Marcellus|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a pity because that team played so well for so long. Now the wheels have come off completely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at least a void, I'm told :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, I am reminded that @ds don't mean @ds.  That is a cost of the system people forget.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|garnetts: I was wondering why East did not bid 1NT after 1@H too|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s3|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|andyv:  now one more club lead....|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|garnetts: or 1@S if it denied having them |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't matter|pg||
nt|andyv:  unscrambled the entire suit... E might have done better playing the J@s at trick 1|pg||
nt|santyclz: So is it a system charge that this is undoubles?|pg||
nt|santyclz: (undoubled?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|roswolf: incroyable why not cash the king?|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR Fredin played 3 rounds of @S - but Nilsson ruffed with @h8?? and overruffed with @h9 - |pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: bye all|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thank you all hope to see you later this week for more bridge :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: He can never get to dummy|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a suggestion that East really did bid 1@S - can you confirm or not, Bas? |pg||
nt|garnetts: actually I agree with the specs the only sound bid was 1@D |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I would've entered it if I saw it|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  good night all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Andy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thank you all, we'll be back with 16 more boards in about 20 minutes :)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|andyv:  typed before I saw him play a @s:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, indeed :) sorry|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sQ|mc|6|nt|Vugraphznk: No problem|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: We'll be back in approximately 80 minutes|pg||
