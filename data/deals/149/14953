nt|brolucius: believe that LHO had the heart king (and had not at leat attempted to cash another spade), Boye played the ace from dummy and called for the queen. East did NOT put on his king and ...|pg||

nt|jaheim: lots of toppairs playing 2 @D as a weak muli   and 2 @H @S as a serious weak 2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: presumably S cannot open 2H, but a more likely alternative would seem to be 1H. cant argue with success though:)|pg||

nt|brolucius: 2@H is often played as natural, rather than Michaels.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He should be able to cross-ruff his way to 10 tricks |pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe 2NT would have shown the minors, despite East's 1@D bid.|pg||

mb|p|pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: But not enough|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: The way it went, he did at least show longer clubs than spades - but he had to risk bidding at a higher level. |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They can take another heart, then switch to a trump, but declarer still has 10 tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's double was a Support Double, showing a hand of any strength and exactly three-card heart support.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|brolucius: East's strength was shown on the next round, when he declined to bid 4@H.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: to get to nine. but it is extremely pessimistic to save since there are zillions of hands where 3N fails, maybe by several tricks. so if you don;t try for that kind of good result ...|pg||

nt|baardolav: this will make +2 or something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2@d is a Multi, South can respond 2@h (pass/correct) or 2@S (pass/3@h). His hearts are good, could easily have bid 2@s   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: South with long hearts assumes his partner has spades :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@s is natural not forcing in weak multi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can play it that way.|pg||

nt|chick: this can make 4@H but not 5@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lesser evil and pass by E.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Pas probably limits the damage as any EW contract would be pretty expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @S slam can make, but unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: an aggressive lead which on this layout costs a trick|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: i have stopped bidding 4@H 30 years ago|pg||
nt|haans: support x better than delayed support|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: i would bid something - choice between 4n and 5H not easy but i would fera missing slam to much not to make a try|pg||
nt|sharkey: @CJ Jan Arne - and claim :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally prefer to use a 2@C rebid after 1@D opening to show a good hand. Gives you room to explore below 3N, at a cost on some natural auctions on lesser hands.|pg||

nt|vugraphznb: in board 1, Lunna got a diamond in the lead, and South was endplayed in spade|pg||

nt|chick: of course I'm famous for detesting moysians :)|pg||

nt|haans: but IMP so who cares :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in a short match overtricks sometimes matter|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: it was 8 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: but went quite fast in the end, so don't know exactly how|pg||
nt|haans: no good bid for E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1D seems fine to me|pg||
nt|chick: again, too good for a preempt|pg||
nt|haans: "Not for person below 100"|pg||
nt|mcarroll: now making all his small trumps with the crossruff - contract making|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|april7: N might reopen with a X, then S might reach qa @H contract at 3 level, but EW might compete to 3 @S|pg||

nt|jaheim: D  =  3 @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Spørs hvilke krav meldinger de har til rådighet - hvis 2 NT krav viser farge|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N migh be best on this on NS cards alone, but @H more likely to be found.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Good bid by Kvangraven|pg||
nt|lestergold: no lead to beat|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N|pg||
nt|sharkey: S unsure about @C suit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south may be tempted to play this in hearts|pg||
nt|jaheim: or lucky, finding p with 10 of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: if so three rounds of spades with the 9@h ruffing in would not be nice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S seems makeable on trump coup|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: may be even 6...|pg||

nt|marlowepi: hi henry:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
nt|haans: Henry :)|pg||
nt|haans: no alert of 2nt?|pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s would seem to have the advantage that it leaves more room, and your hand is better than a weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was bid as good-bad, but W is not sure. TD at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was not alerted|pg||
nt|haans: can be costly|pg||

nt|haans: invite or not invite that is the question|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H prermpt in my book|pg||
nt|chick: after the X, 2@H shows 8+ in my book :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: last board in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2 matches to go|pg||
nt|mcarroll: After I predicted a flat board on 6 I hesitate to say anything here - But............|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1   i think   ,  Liv Marit|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: yes, you're right jaheim|pg||
nt|april7: I think losing at most 2 @S and 2 aces|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: one more match|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|haans: AKK is extra in it self|pg||
nt|henryb:  better case at matchpoints|pg||
nt|sharkey: We would all lead @HQ vs 3 NT and set it....|pg||
nt|chick: and I have a known double fit in the majors (assuming a normal takeout double)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 2@D to show both M and some points|pg||
nt|haans: yep good for 2@D instead of @H bid|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|haans: im on Volls side|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Depends what 2NT showed|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: there has been a fair amountg of no trump avoidance too|pg||
nt|sharkey: May work out ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: im susrprised that 3n failed in open room|pg||
nt|haans: yes at IMP you seldom pass before game|pg||
nt|chick: that would also work if such agreed|pg||
nt|sharkey: This won't be easy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True Roland|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS wil be quite pleased to gain an imp after going four down vulnerable in a freely-bid game |pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: Solves trump problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ive checked play first took club the unatural way then after spade switch took a secons spade finesse rather than dim finesse when defenders had warned himn that spades were ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: both 'wrong'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, the cardinal sin, Mike. Declarer had his contract but went for overtricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Viego will suffer their first defeat |pg||
pc|c7|nt|henryb:  if partner signs off the game may be less than 50%|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i see contract failed in open but surely playing on clubs declarer should make this|pg||
nt|haans: you need a good 50% to bid non vul games|pg||
nt|haans: better bidding than OR|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: play for split honours in clubs shoul lose a heart a club and a diamond at most|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board for the match. Back in 10-15 mins|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sharkey: Had to lead @D9 for a set|pg||
nt|sharkey: Needed @H lead - not @HQ - to make|pg||

nt|april7: 1@S and 2 aces, sorry|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharkey: Ø må spille på at N må ha begge Ess for å vinne kontrakten|pg||
nt|lestergold: it wasnt for overtrick played for split spade honours rather than dim finesse which a priori was better odds but suspicous on the dfence|pg||
nt|sharkey: First make your contract - THEN overtricks...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Liv Marit!|pg||

nt|haans: i had a bid as North|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would also have made a takeout double.|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S at both rooms?|pg||
nt|haans: other bidding at OR|pg||
nt|henryb:  the combination of Souths double on board 4 and North's pass on 7 is strange to my eyes|pg||
nt|haans: Board 4 was +13 imp|pg||
nt|haans: do we have something to learn?|pg||
