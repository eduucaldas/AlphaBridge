mb|p|nt|haans: 1@D no 5 c M|pg||

nt|chick: Pass by S is also an alternative :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very odd to bid 4H when 3N is virtually sure to go down|pg||

pc|hT|nt|haans: i prefer 1@H to 3|pg||
nt|chick: with 2 aces and 3 hearts, N must know that 3N is doomed.   must be he thought 4@H was makeable|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case why wouldnt he bid it on the porevious round?|pg||

nt|lestergold: the play for a ruff iss too slow and north has no entry now to play diamonds so this will make after all|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: certainly true that Pass is an option for S. my comment about 1H was based on the manifest intention of S to do something other than the textbook pass, so i whould have prefaced my ...|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: certainly there are hands where 3N could make and 4HX be a good save -- mostly they start with a longish minor lacking only the ace plus two heart stoppers and enough spade tricks ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to get to nine. but it is extremely pessimistic to save since there are zillions of hands where 3N fails, maybe by several tricks. so if you don;t try for that kind of good result ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when your preempt creates the opportunity, you ought to stop  preempoting|pg||

nt|sharkey: May have made anyway Mike as N wud run into discard problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed but you are not supposed to be on declarer's payroll |pg||
nt|jaheim: 4 sp 1 unlucky down|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: last board in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: last board this match, back 15.30|pg||
nt|sharkey: OR doesn't look like an optimal result|pg||
nt|lestergold: well my last board and will bid u all farewell and thx to excllent operator and fellow commentator Carl|pg||
nt|sharkey: txs Mike - see you again soon|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx also to specs for comments|pg||

nt|vugraphznb: last board in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: last board in this match|pg||
nt|sharkey: So the Cider King and his kids take the lead 11-4|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks to our excellent operator, Liv Marit Grude, for a great job :)|pg||
nt|haans: to both table urKKKK|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ie let him make his own mistakes or no0t as the case may be|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not provide him with a route map to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Rite - and discrading !K at the end position and keeping 3 x @C may have resulted in a set|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: The challenge here is to bid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: @DK|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 3@h is slamtry with @c|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sharkey: 7 stikk mulig her|pg||
nt|jaheim: no  3 nt looks ok it playing on @Ds|pg||
nt|henryb:  but would you with AKK and four trumps, a couple of extra jacks and a doubleton?|pg||

mb|2C|nt|jaheim: if   playing|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: as all others try for game|pg||
nt|sharkey: S bid 2@H OR|pg||
nt|henryb:  I remind kibitzers that while I deeply appreciate comments I will not respond to anyone who does not have the courtesy to put their full names in their profile|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chick: as would I|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will get to game now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2NT Invitational Values min @S and 4 card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: but needs to lead a @D, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of this session has been when you are dealt a double then double|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why didnt S bid 3 NT?|pg||
nt|haans: invite or not invite that is the question|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H prermpt in my book|pg||
nt|chick: after the X, 2@H shows 8+ in my book :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|haans: AKK is extra in it self|pg||
nt|henryb:  better case at matchpoints|pg||
nt|sharkey: We would all lead @HQ vs 3 NT and set it....|pg||
nt|chick: and I have a known double fit in the majors (assuming a normal takeout double)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 2@D to show both M and some points|pg||
nt|haans: yep good for 2@D instead of @H bid|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: im on Volls side|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: there has been a fair amountg of no trump avoidance too|pg||
nt|sharkey: May work out ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: im susrprised that 3n failed in open room|pg||
nt|haans: yes at IMP you seldom pass before game|pg||
nt|chick: that would also work if such agreed|pg||
nt|sharkey: This won't be easy|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: Solves trump problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ive checked play first took club the unatural way then after spade switch took a secons spade finesse rather than dim finesse when defenders had warned himn that spades were ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: both 'wrong'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, the cardinal sin, Mike. Declarer had his contract but went for overtricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Viego will suffer their first defeat |pg||
pc|s9|nt|henryb:  if partner signs off the game may be less than 50%|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: i see contract failed in open but surely playing on clubs declarer should make this|pg||
nt|haans: you need a good 50% to bid non vul games|pg||
nt|haans: better bidding than OR|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: play for split honours in clubs shoul lose a heart a club and a diamond at most|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sharkey: Had to lead @D9 for a set|pg||
nt|sharkey: Needed @H lead - not @HQ - to make|pg||

nt|sharkey: Ø må spille på at N må ha begge Ess for å vinne kontrakten|pg||
nt|lestergold: it wasnt for overtrick played for split spade honours rather than dim finesse which a priori was better odds but suspicous on the dfence|pg||
nt|sharkey: First make your contract - THEN overtricks...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: evry tim you do wrong Have a talk with p|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: 9 dimds would be a better card to play by east|pg||
