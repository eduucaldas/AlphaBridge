nt|santyclz: This probably shouldn't make but it wouldn't be surprising if it does.|pg||
nt|jcwla: I like the choice of a simple @D bid -- but then I like both suits to be at least remotely decent to show a two-suiter.  Here, if pd led away from a high honor in @C's, it could be ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: disaster.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: hi Mike welcome|pg||
nt|henryb:  Who else thinks that North has overbid (if 3@h would have been non-forcing)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  a difficult hand for their system?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Mike|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm this duck has allowed declarer to make what looked like an impossible contract on the heart lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in England many pairs use 2@C...2NT as invitational in NT, not necessarily showing a four card major. NS obviously treat it differently  |pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: Hi Gary, Bas|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think n overbid with 2@c, but realize it's played differently by many people.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: here as in NZ it guaranteed a major|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c8|nt|ady: not a good slam    apart from maybe having to guess where to try for thr 12th trick it needs diamonds to behave|pg||

nt|tjolpe:  hi Bas|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Bas, Gary and Sven-Olov|pg||
nt|andyv:  and welcome specs|pg||
nt|andyv:  first board very exciting|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and a board passed by :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think I've seen a pass out on first board yet|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: several @S's available EW|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  easy to compare with|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: altho 3N was an easier contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: In the NL it's not uncommon to play 1NT-2@C ; 2@H-2@S as invitational without 4@S and 2NT as invitational with 4@S, so that a @S contract can still be played from the NT opener's ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this board won't go to far in the bidding either|pg||
nt|jcwla: I agree with Joe about not opening 2@C; not so much because it's not a really nice playing hand, it just doesn't best describe the nature of the hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|mdgraham: not sure if that is the case here, obviously|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree, David...not a great slam but to not even sniff it out seems conservative|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think the slam is a decent proposition. they might well lead a suit that resolves the guess for you|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: playing precision all 1-level openings are limited up to 15 hcp|pg||
nt|lestergold: very costly duck|pg||
nt|santyclz: The duck was certainly reasonable.  If e had 5+@cs he might have shown a 2-suiter and if he doesn't, you don't want n to get an entry for a @s lead.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|andyv:  1@D xfer to @hs|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  EW play 5542, probably with unbalanced 1@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that's catching on here also|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  1@D shows hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with @CK on side it is quite makeable so could be a swing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: playable. In the UK lots of pairs play weak NT, so who becomes declarer is less of a consideration|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  N wants to bid 2@d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: different if it is a strong NT, of course|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Right|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Or have I missed something?)|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|Vugraphznk: I guess I'll see next week, I'll be arriving in Brighton on Monday :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: Brighton congress?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: no probs here as cards lie|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, starting this weekend|pg||
nt|henryb:  What was 2@d?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  N was able to show both minors.. S not interested|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: gl all taking part|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: with the 3-3 spade break declarer can afford the safety play of K@C   and club to the ace and be rewarded with an overtrick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not the optimum spot for anyone either|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: except ew|pg||
nt|andyv:  but it looks like it will play well|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzpa: with @h ace shown in N... then @c Q must be in S for the DBL ..or?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 4 trump, S might have tried a forcing game but doesn't know if @s or @d is best lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: If 2@d means the same as last round, it is any unbalanced normal opening without a 4-card major.|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm not sure this is the pair that was playing that, but think so.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, they were|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: one thing I am quite proud of was winning the Brighton pairs in 1975, the last time it was a proper pairs event. Been a Swiss pairs ever since|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NZ Nationals 24 September - it's mine and the events 25th, not many have been to all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Where is Brighton I am asked. In southern England in the county of Sussex|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on the South Coast. Two piers, one functional and the other not....|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I don't mean to advertise, but I will anyway :) I'm still looking for a p for Brighton :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and a nice beach town in Canterbury New Zealand where I grew up|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, Englishmen were very good at picking names for newly founded settlement|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not that "New Amsterdam" was particularly hard, but hey|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: diasgree with messing about here should enter dummy and finesse spade immediately|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: yes, and some length expected too, so probably will startt the suit by leading the knave|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or New York|pg||

mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: won't be easy...North will win the spade and might play clubs|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in which case East might figure that West needs either @SQ or @hA to beat this|pg||
nt|andyv:  I have parteners who like to see if I can make one more too.|pg||
nt|andyv:  N has to guess now to play @cs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry for silly remark above. i was multi-tasking and has spade ten and jack interchanged|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and from East's point of view, he might not be able to afford to duck the club |pg||

nt|mdgraham: lots of science here|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes see last comment|pg||
nt|roswolf: i must say that bidding 4@S is unattractive but i agree it seems the normal bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kiwibridge: will it lead somewhere|pg||
nt|mdgraham: whether it will prove efficacious, we will have to wait and see|pg||

nt|henryb:  and then he accepts his own invitation?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Wonder what 1NT-2@D ; 2@H-2@S is to them|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't know what the nt range is but the Kaplan and Rubens hand evaluator rates that one at 13.45|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: 2@c=GF, 2@h=shape and so on|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: W has shown 5241 with a minimum, I think|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|henryb:  He is very lucky on this hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  I believe he actually needs the specific holdings he finds: @hQJ doubleton and spades 4-3|pg||
nt|santyclz: So this may very well be a swing hand as well.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not think this reaches the odds we would ordinarily want even for a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am not really sure what he is thinking about|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hoping some of his spot cards will grow up?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: but West played @S10, so North is marked with @SQ....so West needs @HA |pg||
nt|lestergold: east is fixed cannot pass cannopt double is barraged into bidding 4|pg||

pc|h7|nt|kiwibridge: need to know the @C is Q|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spec thinks N should bid only 2N. perhaps so, but 3N puts more pressure on opps and is less revealing|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Petersson had actually revoked during the play, he had the @H6 left, but declarer claimed and he was never exposed...|pg||

nt|garnetts: if you see what I mean|pg||
nt|mdgraham: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ace no cost to ruff finesse the @sQ|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|andyv:  interesting evaluation.... N wouldn't even sniff out a slam on 3 but believes this hand is worth investigating.|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  N tried a natural 4NT, since he could bid 3N with 11-13|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 1@d bid shows 0+@ds but a 4 card major.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|mdgraham: West led @hK - may have switched to @D, but East overtook @HA and led a club|pg||
nt|andyv:  do you think S took 4N as natural?|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  yes|pg||
nt|garnetts: just been told you bid 1NT and don't alert :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much use with screens though|pg||
nt|garnetts: you can also make 4@S because they are 3/3 and you control @Ds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 1NT showed clubs, presumably 2@C was NF?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (just guessing)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: better be relay|pg||
nt|garnetts: well 2@C is an underbid then isn't it|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: In my view, 1N is a doubtful rebid holding that honor dispersion|pg||
nt|andyv:  this lead won't scare declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps not on the lead|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  he should anyway:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: possible - but then, how do you play in 2@C....|pg||

nt|mdgraham: ah, the engine is revving up |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: must have had a shot of reddex which dates me |pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: A round-about route to the normal contract.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: we are just guessing as to the EW systemic nuances. Fun to do so though|pg||
nt|jcwla: Is the E hand considered a good hand in this system or...?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  I'm not sure what S took it... do we know what type of keycard they are playing?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: suggest 2@C was GF relay|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: now makes 3|pg||
nt|santyclz: With the @cs breaking w starts with 9 top tricks and many ways for an 10th.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

pc|c9|nt|Vugraphznk: It doesn't say much but neither bid was alerted|pg||
nt|andyv:  if ace asking it would not be alertable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: by sheer luck reaches a making contract when most would play 3N|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: With screens it is, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  both make so no loss|pg||
nt|andyv:  and actually 5@d may be a little easier|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  he can still go down in this one|pg||
nt|andyv:  thinking of finessing for J@s, Sven?|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  NS is not a regular partnership, NE is and SW was as juniors|pg||

nt|garnetts: I remember playing against a Cambridge uni pair  and after 10 mins 4@C was alerted and when asked was told it meant they should be in 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's fun to play these realy sequences, but there is a lot of remembering to do|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: LOL David|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: show me that stiff A@S said pard as we relayed to 7 making on 28 highs :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they missed out 3@C|pg||
nt|garnetts: Waiting for Godot|pg||

pc|d8|nt|pelu: but u have 19 HCP (incl the stiff @dk)|pg||
nt|lestergold: however I tink ovedr 3@d north should bid 3@H he has to downvalye his hand ie K@d stiff and wuith 5@h 3@s double is not best|pg||

nt|andyv:  defense was difficult but NS could not afford to break the @s suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: flushed with success can they reach the failing @H game|pg||
nt|garnetts: an odd decision|pg||
nt|garnetts: why bid a suit when you have a nine card fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's an old story - to make game in a suit you have to bid that suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the 4 card @S resp was raised with 3 odd|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|vugraphzpa: 1 nt = 12-15 in this position|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats a 7 card fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. not as good as a 5/4 fit, but better than a 4/2 |pg||
nt|mdgraham: this opening used to be popular in the UK some years back, but you don't see it much now |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Half-time, and in the other match one table is already finished|pg||

mb|3D|nt|pelu: it is so easy then u see alle cards - not so easy for N over 3@D|pg||

nt|andyv:  promises 3-1 in the majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: taken as both majors, by the look of it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H all right if it is your best suit, but not when it is your worst|pg||

nt|andyv:  this looks like it should make 4@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: last two hands have squashed the rally|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: "I forgot they played strong @c-system" Østergaard said|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if ever there was a 10-count that looked like a weak NT, that North hand does |pg||
nt|roswolf: slam possible here - might be difficult to bid though|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@h on the spade ace|pg||
nt|garnetts: conservative I mean :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite so|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: We've arrived at the anteprepenultimate board now :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: The 2@D making 4 was a push on 10 when the OR N/S got to NT but 2, making.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you must have a decent dictionary, Bas|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|an|*|nt|tjolpe:  yes, it's a good clue|pg||
nt|santyclz: Someone said (and I am not necessily endorsing this viewpoint)...|pg||
nt|garnetts: thats a decent 12 count for a flat hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|mdgraham: yes, tens and things|pg||
nt|santyclz: If you are not liberal when you are young, you have no heart.  If you are not conservative when you are old you have no brain.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: much better than the last hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: lol Joe|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|ady: look like 4@S can make unless south leads a top club and underleads at trick 2  for a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass?|pg||
nt|roswolf: support double may be good now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@d maybe easier to manage of course and also K@s protected|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, thanks|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not sure who introduced this during VGs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: natural bidding :) 1@D=singleton diamond|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|andyv:  defense should be clear in 4@s.... S plays A or K@c, N plays Q and S plays 2@c for @d ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
nt|garnetts: I certainly endorse that--but the conservative bits hurts more|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south will drive to slam now|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|andyv:  otherwise, 4 makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: one slam is dodgy the otyher excellent|pg||
nt|lestergold: both make here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: But it was sometime four years ago|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Well, for reasons of a-politicality (if that's a word) I refrain from expressing any opinion about the quote.|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|tjolpe:  a good sacrifice against 4 hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: man overboard again |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That's how they defended in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: correct defence  CR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: jack seems an odd choice|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: again this situation with QJx ... in the first half NS had the same situation with 109x |pg||
mb|2N!|nt|pelu: do S know the @s-control?|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont see why he should|pg||
nt|roswolf: blackwood has caused a problem|pg||
nt|pelu: D = 3 card @H - 3@C ok, but why 41D by N and not 3@s??|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair question - but if north doesnt have a spade control his opening bid would be very thin|pg||
nt|pelu: give him @cK and not @sk|pg||
nt|pelu: even with @sQ (not K) N has a 1@D opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think W is more likely to have @CK than N, but as you say, 3@S would've prevented this issue|pg||
nt|roswolf: i suppose he could have QJx of spades and a void club but then he would habe cued 4@C perhaps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The question is, could he have a 4@D bid without @SK|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is what south has to decide|pg||
nt|roswolf: he is a world class player|pg||
nt|pelu: can he have @SK and bid 4@D :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: depends on how practised this partnership is|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol yes Peter|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's a valid argument as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is where i wish we had a running commentary on south's thoughts|pg||
nt|andyv:  this doesn't come close|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: since the spade suit is out of the equation --you could use 3S to show four hearts and 3@C  as weak|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|ady: let it through|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|lestergold: well this seems to be a mega tank|pg||
nt|roswolf: good decision|pg||
nt|lestergold: but arrived at best spot well done|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|nt|andyv:  S will need a scissor's coup to hold it to down 1 on @d switch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't know what all this means (sorry) but I'm sure EW do|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E did it for him... not sure why E didn't return the @d...he knows W has 3@hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: I have received a bet that E has shown 4216 and 8 zz-points|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: I don't understand the jack unless they play Peter Lund's method where it promises one higher. Then we are in the same situation. I don't think they do, though|pg||

nt|marlowepi: apparently not if S shifted|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: and they used the short break between the two sections to discus it |pg||

mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: E breaks the rules again|pg||
nt|andyv:  multi strikes again|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: Some play 3@S as 1354 or 1345. This hand is perfect for it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a common treatment is a 3S response, both minors with 3 cards in other major. very useful when you often open 1NT with a 5 card major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When you get a 3NT rebid, you can forget about it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry roland was typing while you were expoiunding|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least no excitement for declarer on this one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or 3@H=4@D5@c and 3@S=5@D4@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  I prefer to show the frag rather than the splinter.. much more difficult for opps to dbl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they are going to lead yr short suit whatever you do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and bidding the stiff lets partner declare|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but more of a guess when pd can't dbl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why bother doubling 3@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Or you could play 2@S as MSS|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Minor Suit Stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: Houston ... We have a problem .......|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N must have shown shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  that seems to be going by the wayside with 4 suit transfers lately|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh dear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unsound bidding by North I think it's fair to say|pg||
nt|andyv:  ah, my type of bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think N realizes that they are way behind... only reason for that bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: Østergaard did not alert 3@c ... and I guess he might have taken it for a @c suit inviting to 3nt .... I am sure Mads meant it to be something else|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: But as you might know .... NS is not a regular partnership !|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the last few boards have all gone wrong :(|pg||
nt|ady: Q@D  instead of Q@S   then good contract      even J@D  would give play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all the more reason to keep methods simple|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6N would be cold if E had the diamond length|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: I guess Østergaard might move it to 6nt ...... but he takes his time before deciding what to do.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is cold if W won't ruff any of N's clubs |pg||
nt|pelu: East played @HA - and alle over - now a @H-ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: there may have been an endplay or if nnot certainly am op[portunity for misdefence|pg||
nt|lestergold: round of spades cash some dims play low heart i think declarer's rho may have been in trouble|pg||
nt|pelu: u can make 4@s on all leads - but have to play @H before 2x@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: but would need somethingh lime double dummy declarer play!|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i suspected that|pg||
nt|garnetts: not keen on 3@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: The score is not right.  The OR N/S matched the 4@S making from in here, it's a push not 9 to Gary's Boys.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Score still stands at 62-59 for Skalman.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The oppo can now bid, pass, or redouble, and a good pair will have agreemenst about these actions - you just give them more room to converse|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  10@h now|pg||

mb|p|mb|6H|nt|pelu: what a lead?|pg||

mb|p|pc|s6|nt|jcwla: Good enough to double, good enough to lead!|pg||

nt|roswolf: 1nt a transfer?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: no I exp that 1NT = 1@D bid - they have used transfers on 1@c-opening, 1@D =@h and 1@H=@S, but normal 1@S would be a @d-bid|pg||
nt|pelu: spects - help me :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am hungry indeed|pg||
nt|garnetts: better one here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: We are beginning to get the hang of the EW system - 1@D means I have an opening bid, and after that you bid one below the suits you have got |pg||
nt|mdgraham: like 2@h here :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: 11 imps from nowhere|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  If you hover your mouse over the other room score, a pop-up shows what the bidding was there.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  it will be hard to duplicate the score in the CR|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Næsten Junior had a chance after boards 28 and 29, but since then it has been downhill, and the favourites have it|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yeah, they play T-Walsh|pg||
nt|pelu: and? 1NT=?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_Walsh Wiki where would we be without you :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 1NT showing 6-9 without 4cM|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: In about 25 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I may stay on a while :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you would think that East might have had some way to find out the ace position|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: lead directing|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thank you Mike, will you be here later on?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Carl Ragnarsson. R and T are too close together on the keyboard :( |pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4H should come in|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Not sure, Norway at 4:00|pg||
nt|santyclz: But I had 14 points!  Didn't I have to bid?|pg||
nt|garnetts: you did Joe==anyone for double?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'll have a pint of whatever North seems to have got hold of please |pg||
nt|santyclz: That should be enough for east.|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes it beats viagra|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  @h spots sit well for N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good hand for Gazilli-ish methods|pg||
nt|pelu: 10 IMPs for Glopson on 27 - a lazy 3Nt by Fredin - 1@C - 1@S - 2@C - 3NT - and 5 @H-tricks for opp|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nice :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you don't like doubling as South (not four hearts) but it's something you have to do|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|andyv:  smoothly moving from 5-3 fit to 4-3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and here the 4-3 is favoured over the 5-3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: spades 2-2, hearts 3-3, diamond honours split - should be no problem|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: but a helpful lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  if your side is prone to raising with 3, then you probably should support the 5 card suit when you have 3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: now ambiguity about forthcoming 4H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No ambiguity|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: if this makes the match is likely all over|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  unfortunate ending to this match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Østergaard thought 4@C is natural|pg||
nt|garnetts: not sure i am allowed to mention that before the watershed|pg||
nt|santyclz: If the 2 aces and 4-card @d support aren't enough for a x, surely the @c holding justifies one.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'm sure I don't know what you mean David|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D probably doesn't guarantee a diamond suit |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  so did I|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: what on earth is happening here|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 rounds of spades does it|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: well, this is unfortunate. A pity for NS. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: see my profile for the answer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: which is the next line spoken by Marcellus|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a pity because that team played so well for so long. Now the wheels have come off completely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at least a void, I'm told :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, I am reminded that @ds don't mean @ds.  That is a cost of the system people forget.|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  now one more club lead....|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|garnetts: or 1@S if it denied having them |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Doesn't matter|pg||
nt|andyv:  unscrambled the entire suit... E might have done better playing the J@s at trick 1|pg||
nt|santyclz: So is it a system charge that this is undoubles?|pg||
nt|santyclz: (undoubled?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c5|nt|roswolf: incroyable why not cash the king?|pg||

pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: I have a suggestion that East really did bid 1@S - can you confirm or not, Bas? |pg||
nt|garnetts: actually I agree with the specs the only sound bid was 1@D |pg||
