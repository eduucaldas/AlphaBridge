nt|lestergold: well a tame defence may let this thru|pg||
nt|chick: ouch, and N rescues them|pg||
nt|haans: but ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: East elected to bid NV - not unexpected|pg||

pc|h6|nt|haans: 1@D no 5 c M|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||

nt|jaheim: NS  won the mixed pair chship this year|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: presumably S cannot open 2H, but a more likely alternative would seem to be 1H. cant argue with success though:)|pg||
nt|chick: Pass by S is also an alternative :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very odd to bid 4H when 3N is virtually sure to go down|pg||

nt|haans: why 4@H?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: i prefer 1@H to 3|pg||
nt|chick: with 2 aces and 3 hearts, N must know that 3N is doomed.   must be he thought 4@H was makeable|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case why wouldnt he bid it on the porevious round?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surely E was not going to pass 3HX|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: the play for a ruff iss too slow and north has no entry now to play diamonds so this will make after all|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: certainly true that Pass is an option for S. my comment about 1H was based on the manifest intention of S to do something other than the textbook pass, so i whould have prefaced my ...|pg||

nt|jaheim: må kanskje oppdateres|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: certainly there are hands where 3N could make and 4HX be a good save -- mostly they start with a longish minor lacking only the ace plus two heart stoppers and enough spade tricks ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to get to nine. but it is extremely pessimistic to save since there are zillions of hands where 3N fails, maybe by several tricks. so if you don;t try for that kind of good result ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when your preempt creates the opportunity, you ought to stop  preempoting|pg||

nt|chick: 4@H looks good superficially, but I think difficult to make.  3@S has no chance.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: technically 4@s is a vbiablem save but who is gonna bid it it could be heading for 800 not agood imnvestment unless you cansee al the cards|pg||

mb|1N|nt|othered1: @C systems handle east's hand easily.  But if you're willing to open the correct 1@D, standard shouldn't have a huge problem, either.|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: *Multi|pg||
nt|lestergold: festering awful wouldnt do it myself at equal vul|pg||
nt|lestergold: here it might make e/w auction difficult|pg||
nt|sharkey: Can't be distributional values either....|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Ø dukker en @S og NS må ta beiten på direkten|pg||
nt|chick: it looked same to me, but we trust our operator :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E hates this hand!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but west has a monster over east's bidding so should go on|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well im really getti9ng a full dose of commentatr's curse today|pg||
nt|sharkey: Whar would you bid Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: west's pass verylazy in my view and suicidal in a teams game|pg||
nt|lestergold: im 61 this month and feel about 18 mentally- er physically notm quite that|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: K of cl and a claim?|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club at its best|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: headed for game not making perhaps|pg||
nt|chick: this can make 4@H but not 5@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lesser evil and pass by E.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Pas probably limits the damage as any EW contract would be pretty expensive|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: i have stopped bidding 4@H 30 years ago|pg||
nt|haans: support x better than delayed support|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: i would bid something - choice between 4n and 5H not easy but i would fera missing slam to much not to make a try|pg||
nt|sharkey: @CJ Jan Arne - and claim :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally prefer to use a 2@C rebid after 1@D opening to show a good hand. Gives you room to explore below 3N, at a cost on some natural auctions on lesser hands.|pg||
nt|chick: wow, I would never sell out with S's hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud be off 1|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jaheim: ja   og ender opp med 2 bet |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: perfectly reasonable as games make on dim finesse|pg||
nt|jaheim: needs a sp lead to win, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n can make dpending on defence 5@d no play at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: except on spade lead|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Would you x NT after first x by W and pass by E?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W showed the other two suits by x.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think I would find the Pass, but I also think being aggressive is a winner in the long term|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: very little info from auction west has opted for non commital 'safe' trump lead|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: spade switch obvious but doesnt matter spade loser cannot go|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|othered1: At least it simplified the auction.  In standard, south's planned rebid after opening 1@D isn't easy.|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: EW will find 4@S|pg||

nt|haans: odd take out x|pg||
nt|henryb:  Going back to board one, where Lunna mysteriously took 12 tricks in 6N, shouldn't it be possible for big club players to reach 6@c?|pg||
nt|othered1: North has to act h ere and EW may find themselves defending a high @D contract|pg||
nt|haans: big clubs does anything :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: in board 1, Lunna got a diamond in the lead, and South was endplayed in spade|pg||

nt|haans: with u|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some would use stayman as N|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm that will tend to ruole out a heart contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib asked why not open weak 2@H with S hand on Bd 17.  Reason is weak 2 openings 3rd hand NV can be very weak at Expert level, and this was closer to an opening hand.  Also a ...|pg||

nt|lestergold: 6@c avaialble as cards liem 3n no good|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@c is what i meant to type|pg||
nt|sharkey: or 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: that too but game unlikely to be bid in either back suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S may actually be a better contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: both comntractsb less than 50% no real reason to justify bidding game here|pg||
nt|henryb:  down 2?????????|pg||

nt|henryb:  what I thought|pg||

nt|sharkey: or @D ruff before communications in @C cut off|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hmmay not necessartily be bid here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure - odds on to play for @C finesse on @H lead|pg||

nt|haans: 2@S GF|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|haans: three card raise rarer and rarer|pg||
nt|chick: three card raise should be extinct|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sharkey: yes -on review think 5@C better|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not like east's double tend to get into troubole when u faikl to bid ur main asset namely clubs here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Good score in the OR.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|henryb:  West has, imo, a marginal game force.|pg||
nt|haans: OR in 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now will bid|pg||
nt|haans: yes if no agreement|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and they seem set to bid it the same way here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 9 of 14|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But  6@C seems like a leap in the dark|pg||
mb|6C|nt|lestergold: and as u say it may well go off |pg||
nt|sharkey: @DA lead OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: Made it easy for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: is east that stromngb that a doubolem is needed before showing the clubs/|pg||
nt|haans: many play 2nt as invite or more|pg||
nt|haans: many scandinavians at least|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@D - 3 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: 2 hj med 4 kortstøtte,  ja ja, ikke min melding|pg||
nt|sharkey: if East were ready to bid 4@C on 3@D he shud be able to do the same over 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: combined 24 points doesnt have to bid game|pg||
nt|jaheim: mm   1 nt opening in W|pg||
nt|chick: at least S didn't draw the fatal (to defenders) club lead by bidding them|pg||
nt|chick: now can N find a heart?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Well Leaped|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  but woud you bid less than game opposite partner's opening 1@s?|pg||

pc|hA|nt|sharkey: Vet ikke hvor N fant doblingen i Åpent Rom?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C makes - not 6...|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 2S was said to be GF\|pg||
nt|chick: if 2@S is GF....|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: Fant den her og...|pg||

nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|haans: xy Stayman in Sweden we belive that was invented in Denmark long time ago|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think S should bid 5C over 3D, then he is in position to pass 5D|pg||
nt|henryb:  Suth could not affort Blackwood|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d7|pc|s5|pg||

pc|sT|pc|d9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|sharkey: East got the clue he neede|pg||
nt|haans: i agree 5@D not 4@D best bid|pg||

pc|dK|nt|jaheim: but needs to lead a @D, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of this session has been when you are dealt a double then double|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why didnt S bid 3 NT?|pg||
nt|haans: invite or not invite that is the question|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H prermpt in my book|pg||
nt|chick: after the X, 2@H shows 8+ in my book :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|nt|haans: AKK is extra in it self|pg||
nt|henryb:  better case at matchpoints|pg||
nt|sharkey: We would all lead @HQ vs 3 NT and set it....|pg||
nt|chick: and I have a known double fit in the majors (assuming a normal takeout double)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 2@D to show both M and some points|pg||

nt|lestergold: both 'wrong'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, the cardinal sin, Mike. Declarer had his contract but went for overtricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Viego will suffer their first defeat |pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  if partner signs off the game may be less than 50%|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: i see contract failed in open but surely playing on clubs declarer should make this|pg||
nt|haans: you need a good 50% to bid non vul games|pg||
nt|haans: better bidding than OR|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: play for split honours in clubs shoul lose a heart a club and a diamond at most|pg||
