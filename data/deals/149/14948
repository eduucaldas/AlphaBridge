mb|p|nt|h_karluk: This is a hand which has transportation problem, with only entry to hand even 2@s not easy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Hamdi. |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i believe that's another everyday situation, players sometimes get excited with 20 points|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but there's a solution with such holdings, just double then cue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: your partner will recognize you've the 20+ and pick the suitable level|pg||
nt|the saint: Off centre overcall from East|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|h_karluk: after this fact there's a double dummy solution|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|the saint: Too many cards look well placed to defeat this. And the diamond blockage is preventing the defence from setting up a force|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|3C|nt|the saint: 2@S two suited? And do we know the agreed range? |pg||

mb|3D|nt|the saint: Balancing protection from North.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: edit : 3-2 trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry for typo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Flat 4@H EW but will NS find there sac?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: 3@H probably invitational, with 2NT sign-off (Lebensohl) not that North is being invited anywhere :)|pg||
nt|the saint: Has walked into a strong hidden West hand. If East can have that hand then West must be an absolute supermax pass|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rodal f: A interesting 5@D. At right hand and a @H endplay?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: i said DD solution, the reason is quite obvious, south's 4 hcp could be @d A, in that case your K works |pg||

nt|h_karluk: but then maybe the question is why they did not try slam|pg||
nt|snorris: its a good slam actually|pg||
nt|the saint: I must confess a vested interest. I have known NS since they were 14-15. |pg||
pc|s5|pc|dA|nt|rmb1: Its rather an inaccurate position, if you "transfer a King" the TO double has a large effective range|pg||
nt|the saint: It will have a larger one simply through protecting|pg||

pc|dT|nt|h_karluk: <my review, my analyse> 2@d huge underbid|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d6|pc|s6|pg||
nt|rmb1: I met the "UK" team (asn TD) when they beat Oxford in the final of UK unniversities championship to qualify.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h6|nt|the saint: North, Graeme, is better known as 'Daaaaaaave' (long story) and South, David, as 'Mr Fish'.|pg||

pc|s3|nt|the saint: In fact, I don't think I have called them Graeme or David for at least 3 years|pg||
pc|s7|nt|snorris: but west should continue|pg||
nt|rmb1: It was confusing to have two davids in the team when one was referred to Fish and one non-David was referred to a Daaaave|pg||
nt|the saint: Graeme is actually his middle name. His passport says David|pg||
nt|rmb1: There is a debate on BBF on responding to (2M)-P-(P)-X-(P) with CAQxxxx and an outside A: is it too good for 3@C?|pg||
nt|the saint: It looks like Mr Fish can only make two more|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: 3NT E/W - be hard now to get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Will E feel the open from N as music at the air?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: As 4@S also was on.|pg||
nt|the saint: Off centre rebid best on that shape. N/S are playing straightforward 2/1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will try to do my best. AND SPECS. Come with inputs:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: maybe that's why east is hesitate to compete|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: This may boil down to guessing the @D queen. Two trumps and a spade loser seem assured|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|snorris: if you take it with ace east just ducks @s next time to keep connected with west|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @sA+ @dA+@dQ|pg||
nt|the saint: It may be difficult to get a complete count on the hand, so it is possible with the trump length being with W that Mr Fish will play E for the diamond length|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|snorris: now east must play @s|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|the saint: He can work out W is 4-4-x-x from the spade carding and trump length. I don't think he can work out any more. E is therefore 4-2-x-x so it becomes 7:5 to play East for the @D Q?|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: hard enough to play seeing all the cards - you can pitch a club on a spade (stop the S hand being forced) so comes down to which way you play the @h's|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: Ure nr 1?:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzjr: slam time for EW|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: probably end in 3NT|pg||
nt|othered1: That's an original Roth-Stone double, not good enough for a free bid?|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|iceking: i doubt some juniors play Roth-Stone style:)|pg||
nt|iceking: but i could be wrong!|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: a fair one|pg||
nt|othered1: Just tying to conjure up a rationale for the double|pg||
mb|3H|nt|h_karluk: prev deal 7@d would pay 800|pg||
nt|zman1: wonder if owen will underlead the K@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: Often OK to watch the way to the max|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: in practice i doubt many WGM would imagine that save|pg||
nt|iceking: so this will go few down |pg||
mb|4C|nt|snorris: Askgaard wants @h lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: took wrong hands up so at this board W is Askgaard|pg||
nt|h_karluk: allright OR also landed to 6@s doubled, so flat board|pg||
nt|snorris: ok...Kaare wants @h lead...|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: :) |pg||
nt|rmb1: Only 5 losers but he will do well to make this, need more entries|pg||
nt|zman1: 8@D lead is coming :)|pg||
nt|iceking: duck club 8 return |pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|h_karluk: Vladimir thinks that 6@s is a peaceful push, i agree buddy :)|pg||
nt|snorris: tsandard|pg||

nt|rodal f: Surpricing endstation|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|othered1: ducking -- in tempo -- is a pretty routine play.  Wonder what east sees as rush here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzph: not sure what is the contract i belive it is 3nt |pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks wery simular to the Viking press. Grøtheim - Tundal|pg||

nt|rmb1: In the OR, China passed out 3@D X on a similar auction, a hairty -1 was still +1IMP to UK|pg||
nt|iceking: when pd returns club 8 east should know how the clubs are|pg||
mb|5S|nt|rodal f: 2NT=18-19 I belive. At the edge for W to ask. Level 5 should be OK, but E came|pg||

nt|rodal f: By a lot of trapps at 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|rodal f: @HK as lead I was waiting for. Then NS could get 5 tricks by a @D10 returne in at @CQ.|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|the saint: North's 2@S bid is a fine example of what is known in English U20 circles as a 'Chucker Raise'. Backing in later with support, trying either to go for 800 or collect 670. |pg||
pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: as i predicted 4@s quite normal contract in such auctions and 5@c nine out of ten would receive double|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: He wont be unhappy atm though if the @cQ is with south Qxx 3NT cold|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h2|nt|the saint: Blockage in the spade pips may make it tricky to extract the max though|pg||
nt|sjicheng: tks howard, that means china also play multi 2D as i guess:)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|snorris: souths decision to not bid @ds turned out well|pg||

nt|rodal f: If a @S is played early enough it came be some fun. Else -1. Or more by some funny try's|pg||
nt|snorris: turns to @hs|pg||
nt|snorris: hx in north is a chance|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: I think he should have finessed the @h 1st no real rush to play clubs (unless 3@d was a 6 card suit ... vul ??)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still puzzle hand for me|pg||
nt|snorris: agree with the @h finesse first time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: most likely i would try to win the match at another board|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well he knows N 7/4 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: should hvae played @S before second c|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: have*|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|h_karluk: maybe sometimes we abandon to think split honors idea mostly works|pg||
nt|rmb1: East needed to cover @S10 to create the blockage|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||

nt|rodal f: @HA and @H?|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Info from the turney: http://www.bridgefestival.dk/|pg||

nt|sjicheng: another slam going hand here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|zman1: X shows GF values with no clear bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why bid 3 when EW have the majors? OK, Can be right some few times|pg||
nt|iceking: 2h ugly bid |pg||
nt|iceking: but only 2 options |pg||
nt|cappjr:  especially after his last h o'call|pg||
nt|iceking: pass is not a option in my book|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|zman1: X again?|pg||
nt|rodal f: X for cards?|pg||
nt|zman1: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: maybe 4@c to show @c and @h|pg||
nt|rodal f: But will he do?|pg||
nt|cappjr:  me neither|pg||
mb|3C|nt|snorris: 3@cs ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Only one killing lead against 6@H |pg||
mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: Snorri, you would better whisper, he might hear you:)|pg||
nt|zman1: does 4@C show @C and @H or @C and @D or @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This 2@H isn't exactly safe, either.|pg||
nt|iceking: now his pd can expect full values 2h here should be rather weakish hand |pg||
nt|iceking: cant |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: no snorris u bid 3@c with no stopper|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: best lead for defence|pg||
nt|snorris: NOW its a must to finesse @h first time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this contract might be an unanimously one at the field|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bridge is teamwork. But all up at the systems pair use. Seems as EW might felt down at a... here. Easyer at home than international|pg||
nt|zman1: i think he will get hearts right in 6@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: 4@c puppet 4@d, 4@h was a CoG bid|pg||
nt|cappjr:  missing a decent 3 nt|pg||
nt|iceking: 1nt p 3nt and 9 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: Note the problem set for EW by south's opening on a good 4-card @S suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|cappjr:  i was plus 600|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|snorris: with a little in @cs I bid 3 @cs|pg||
nt|snorris: no stopper I bid something else|pg||
nt|pelu: is KQ "a little" :):)|pg||
nt|snorris: only one trick with no help therefore 3@cs|pg||
nt|snorris: then 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sjicheng: en!....|pg||
nt|rodal f: The normal lead against 3NT as 6@H?|pg||
nt|sjicheng: anyway they didn't go 6@H. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: need to guess in @S or @CAQ, not a great slam I think|pg||
nt|sjicheng: i thnk so. at least it's a good choice for me|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: oh and the u exp pd with Jxx to bid 3NT????|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i think 4@h has a chance after @s lead, say west decides to hold up|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: double @H finesse = 75% start withe the @h8 so as not to block|pg||
nt|zman1: its hard bidding 6@D knowing partner has 2@S|pg||
nt|iceking: well w just made a poor bid i just cant pass is an optionn here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|snorris: he heard you:)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|snorris: pd bids 3 nt with something in @cs|pg||

nt|snorris: he knows I have "something" :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: 3@h would be my bid:) after 2n|pg||
nt|snorris: mine too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i admit uncontested 1h,2d>2h,2sp,2n shld be main body|pg||
nt|pelu: back to the play - 3Nt can be maded now!|pg||

pc|sK|nt|the saint: Now needs to switch.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|iceking: as it was east has 10 top tricks this time so he isnt ducking spades|pg||

nt|snorris: twice as good to play for the drop of the Queen|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c5|nt|the saint: The difficulty for S is that he can't see the weak diamond holding in the East hand. But he doesn't have any entries to the hearts so continuing them may be futile|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now the pay comes|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1 trick lost by opening the @H|pg||

nt|rodal f: @HA?|pg||
nt|sjicheng: should be |pg||
nt|rodal f: Not that easy for S to count up N|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Yes, when S discard @CA, North should know S has no loser|pg||
nt|sjicheng: but i think HA is a reasonable discard here. it's hard for N to totally have no C|pg||
nt|rodal f: If NS use UDCA it should be clear by the @H|pg||
nt|sjicheng: and discard of HA will guide N to play C|pg||

mb|1S|nt|iceking: at least in my style i would never think about 3h|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I just wanderd since all have more than 4. H-H have a lot more than 4|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rmb1: Aparrently he did not avoid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: but i can understand it would be fine bid for some others we all dont  think alike |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|zman1: ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sjicheng: N is brave here... will W find Spade lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: second time east doesnt bid his 6card club suit |pg||
nt|iceking: both time pd had 3card support |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: transfers over the double would work nicely|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: a little thought by Yang before pass|pg||
pc|d2|nt|the saint: I can't see how a spade can cost. On any layout|pg||
nt|rmb1: Chance missed, 6NT only needs hearts to break|pg||
nt|othered1: Even on h ands like east's, I get lucky when I get my long suit into the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: now a @C from dummy will bring this contract home|pg||
nt|sjicheng: it's still a difficult contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@S from N often used as 3 card in Norway - Holland as now Germany. Just force after 1@H|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|the saint: Fortunate for UK. I don't think W got even remotely to grips with his hand next door|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Good precision auction though... to a good spot|pg||
nt|iceking: yes good point Adam everyone should play transfers here|pg||
nt|iceking: you gain so much tempo in playing transfers here|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|sybarra: needs agreements I think, but would be better|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sybarra: anyone playing precision or special agreements |pg||
nt|sybarra: since I just arrived |pg||
mb|2N|mb|3H|nt|sybarra: this looks like MIchaels, which I would bid  (never promises a rose garden) or I have huge hand.... |pg||
nt|lmeili: me not! not this vulability|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think you get only one chance to bid the E hand |pg||

nt|sybarra: it is just a matter of style  |pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: yep|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: I can understand 1 @s also and you bid would have worked out better |pg||
nt|sybarra: *your bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: first 6 spade tricks on your bid |pg||
nt|lmeili: does'nt matter this hand, every thing breaks badly|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||

nt|vugraphzjr: east could have bid 3@s instead of 4, but i think its hard to stay at 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Roland on again|pg||

nt|vugraphzjr: Many thanks to Brdige Base Online and our great commentators!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|iceking: 54 imps in 16 boards is like 25-3 in vp |pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: This is the last board today|pg||
mb|2C!|an|Ms|nt|rodal f: As for ure nice work Edward and Shi|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: this might end here |pg||
nt|othered1: what a way to bid the east hand, even if it likely shows @S and minor|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: that R/W overcall is... not my choice|pg||
mb|2H|nt|the saint: Looks like both games are doomed and only double dummy play will keep 3N one off|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: wow, 3@h -- X seems much better if he is going to take a call|pg||
nt|sjicheng: it's my pleasure:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: streetfight is under the reality|pg||
pc|dA|nt|the saint: A chance NS could end up in 4S|pg||
nt|iceking: might as well open 1h instead |pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|rmb1: Looks like they will avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|the saint: That won't make either|pg||
nt|the saint: 4@S is not a bad spot|pg||
nt|othered1: If you're going to open north with 1N, it's likely your later judgment won't be optimal, either.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rodal f: That one is a bit hard. But look at 4@H|pg||
nt|iceking: 3h is really not  a option here either pass or dbl |pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Many thanks to Bridge Base Onilne for providing a great broadcast!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wander what X by 2@C would have been by NSs system|pg||
nt|sjicheng: pre congrats to german here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: Is there a systemic reason north couldn't open 11H?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: not that I know of|pg||
nt|iceking: i doubt that |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I played their system notes with Mitch last week|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and unless there is something I forgot, he could have opened this 1H (1N then semiforcing)... but chose 1N. Once he makes that decision though, needs to stick with it on the second ...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: round of bidding|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|the saint: Short trump hand takes the heart force|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sjicheng: willing to play a C doubled contract :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was it lucky diciplin to pass by those 10 good HPs?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d7|nt|the saint: MAke on any 3-3@S doubleton @SQ, and probably doubleton @S 9 too|pg||
nt|zman1: so another 25 VP's for USA :)|pg||
nt|ritong: the funny part of it is it won t cost any victorypoint, likely|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|othered1: In the Dark Ages, many thought it best not to put too many hands into 1N, since it can be tough to make good choices of games, etc.  But that has changed, it seems.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|mtvesuvius: the fact that it isn't good hasn't changed, Ed :)|pg||
