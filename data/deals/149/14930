nt|rodal f: Hi Hamdi. |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: i believe that's another everyday situation, players sometimes get excited with 20 points|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but there's a solution with such holdings, just double then cue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: your partner will recognize you've the 20+ and pick the suitable level|pg||
nt|the saint: Off centre overcall from East|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: after this fact there's a double dummy solution|pg||

nt|rodal f: Flat 4@H EW but will NS find there sac?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|rmb1: 3@H probably invitational, with 2NT sign-off (Lebensohl) not that North is being invited anywhere :)|pg||
nt|the saint: Has walked into a strong hidden West hand. If East can have that hand then West must be an absolute supermax pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A interesting 5@D. At right hand and a @H endplay?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i said DD solution, the reason is quite obvious, south's 4 hcp could be @d A, in that case your K works |pg||

nt|snorris: its a good slam actually|pg||
nt|the saint: I must confess a vested interest. I have known NS since they were 14-15. |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rmb1: Its rather an inaccurate position, if you "transfer a King" the TO double has a large effective range|pg||

nt|the saint: In fact, I don't think I have called them Graeme or David for at least 3 years|pg||
pc|s8|nt|snorris: but west should continue|pg||
nt|rmb1: It was confusing to have two davids in the team when one was referred to Fish and one non-David was referred to a Daaaave|pg||
nt|the saint: Graeme is actually his middle name. His passport says David|pg||
nt|rmb1: There is a debate on BBF on responding to (2M)-P-(P)-X-(P) with CAQxxxx and an outside A: is it too good for 3@C?|pg||
nt|the saint: It looks like Mr Fish can only make two more|pg||

nt|rodal f: Will try to do my best. AND SPECS. Come with inputs:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: maybe that's why east is hesitate to compete|pg||
pc|h5|nt|the saint: This may boil down to guessing the @D queen. Two trumps and a spade loser seem assured|pg||

nt|h_karluk: @sA+ @dA+@dQ|pg||
nt|the saint: It may be difficult to get a complete count on the hand, so it is possible with the trump length being with W that Mr Fish will play E for the diamond length|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|the saint: He can work out W is 4-4-x-x from the spade carding and trump length. I don't think he can work out any more. E is therefore 4-2-x-x so it becomes 7:5 to play East for the @D Q?|pg||

pc|c4|nt|snorris: a fair one|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: 1)you can stay in 2@s steada the dreaded 2NT|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|kareno: I use that when I play (Canadian style) two-way stayman.  I like in any case to play that sequence invitational as well as 2@c - 2@d - 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: 2) it frees up 1NT 2@h 2@s 2NT as forcing|pg||

nt|vugraphzph: yes|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|the saint: North's 2@S bid is a fine example of what is known in English U20 circles as a 'Chucker Raise'. Backing in later with support, trying either to go for 800 or collect 670. |pg||
pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: as i predicted 4@s quite normal contract in such auctions and 5@c nine out of ten would receive double|pg||
nt|snorris: and north 5@ds?|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: yes|pg||
nt|the saint: Named for junior James 'Chucker' Thrower who was a master of it|pg||

mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Info from the turney: http://www.bridgefestival.dk/|pg||

nt|cappjr:  auto|pg||
nt|iceking: yes i would bid 1nt everyday here |pg||
mb|p|nt|zman1: X shows GF values with no clear bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why bid 3 when EW have the majors? OK, Can be right some few times|pg||
nt|iceking: 2h ugly bid |pg||
nt|iceking: but only 2 options |pg||
nt|cappjr:  especially after his last h o'call|pg||
nt|iceking: pass is not a option in my book|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|zman1: X again?|pg||

nt|zman1: yes|pg||

mb|2H|nt|snorris: 3@cs ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Snorri, you would better whisper, he might hear you:)|pg||
nt|zman1: does 4@C show @C and @H or @C and @D or @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This 2@H isn't exactly safe, either.|pg||
nt|iceking: now his pd can expect full values 2h here should be rather weakish hand |pg||
nt|iceking: cant |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: no snorris u bid 3@c with no stopper|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: best lead for defence|pg||
nt|snorris: NOW its a must to finesse @h first time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this contract might be an unanimously one at the field|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bridge is teamwork. But all up at the systems pair use. Seems as EW might felt down at a... here. Easyer at home than international|pg||
nt|zman1: i think he will get hearts right in 6@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: 4@c puppet 4@d, 4@h was a CoG bid|pg||
nt|cappjr:  missing a decent 3 nt|pg||
nt|iceking: 1nt p 3nt and 9 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: Note the problem set for EW by south's opening on a good 4-card @S suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cappjr:  i was plus 600|pg||
pc|sK|nt|snorris: with a little in @cs I bid 3 @cs|pg||
nt|snorris: no stopper I bid something else|pg||
nt|pelu: is KQ "a little" :):)|pg||
nt|snorris: only one trick with no help therefore 3@cs|pg||
nt|snorris: then 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|pelu: oh and the u exp pd with Jxx to bid 3NT????|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i think 4@h has a chance after @s lead, say west decides to hold up|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: double @H finesse = 75% start withe the @h8 so as not to block|pg||
nt|zman1: its hard bidding 6@D knowing partner has 2@S|pg||
nt|iceking: well w just made a poor bid i just cant pass is an optionn here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|snorris: he heard you:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|snorris: pd bids 3 nt with something in @cs|pg||

nt|rmb1: When Alan became almost old enough to play Gerber he co-invented sliding rainbow gerber where any bid from 4@C+ could be Gerber|pg||
