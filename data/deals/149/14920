nt|april7: small @S, but how can one find that?:)|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzna: 4min left|pg||
nt|stoffers: so, S should bid 5@c because partner has normally 6+@c, as he would pass with like 5332 hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: huge round for the leaders|pg||
nt|sybarra: you dont even mind if pard had ak or aq of clubs and rest is good hand |pg||
nt|stoffers: dhe double of 4@h is takeout, but if N's hand were like xxx-Ax-xxx-Jxxxx he would for sure pass it|pg||
nt|april7: when S doubled for takeout,I think you should bid a 7card suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: esp. with stiff ace |pg||
nt|sybarra: of @H's |pg||
nt|april7: its ridiculous not to do it|pg||
nt|sybarra: your hand is worthless in most other suits |pg||
nt|stoffers: i agree, if you dont do takeoutdoubles with AKxx-x-AQJxxx-Kx|pg||
nt|april7: but then you can always bid 5 @D after 5@C|pg||
nt|stoffers: oh yea?|pg||
nt|stoffers: what if N had QJTxxxx!x and x@d?|pg||
nt|stoffers: 7 clubs and stiff diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: would N come in with clubs if W only bid 2 @H?|pg||

nt|april7: E has return problems!|pg||
nt|stoffers: due to two tings i guess: the speed of the lead (it took like 10sec's) a singleton is supposed to come faster|pg||

nt|stoffers: if you dont have a @s stopper 2@h is an option ofc|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: 4min left|pg||
nt|april7: this I disagree, the doubler must have a way out if opener doesn't have the other major|pg||
nt|stoffers: You cant get it all, and showing the other major is generally better, so thats what we do. The other minor isnt that important|pg||
nt|stoffers: if you promise BOTh other suits with your neg. doubles you will have to start passing a lot|pg||
nt|april7: and since 6P is enough to make a neg.X you shold either have opoeners suit or the 4th suit|pg||
nt|april7: but you have 13 cards, so you must be able to stand the call of the 4th suit!!!|pg||
