pc|c2|nt|psridhar: 2D over 1nt might not hv been natural or is it?|pg||
nt|voldenuit: natural for them |pg||
nt|andyv:  lead helps|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2d certainly easier to play than 1nt ; but 1nt shd make|pg||
nt|voldenuit: 3@c 3@d and 1@s it's seems |pg||
nt|andyv:  entries are the problem.... S needs to lead towards his @ds and @h (although opps may break @hs for him).|pg||
nt|psridhar: a h lead was best for defense and that was the only suit the leader held|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not shure by the system NS. Often best minor and then @D can be at 3 cards so 1NT stop is ok |pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: but Rehder goes for the stronger suit |pg||
nt|voldenuit: NS plays a very natural with better minor strong nt 2@c strong 2@d multi and 2M = 2 suiters |pg||
nt|andyv:  one plus for declarer is W can't attack @ss|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
