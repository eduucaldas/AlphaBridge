mb|p|nt|h_karluk: This is a hand which has transportation problem, with only entry to hand even 2@s not easy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Hamdi. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i believe that's another everyday situation, players sometimes get excited with 20 points|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but there's a solution with such holdings, just double then cue|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|the saint: 2@S two suited? And do we know the agreed range? |pg||
nt|Walddk6: Welcome Alan and Robin|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi |pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: Balancing protection from North.|pg||
nt|jlall: NS almost cold for 3N, but the red 9s that EW have are enough to stop it|pg||
nt|hackenbush:  sitting EW are Roger Lee and Jeremy Fournier from USA|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: when you see trumps 3-1 you can go with another round trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : 3-2 trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry for typo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Flat 4@H EW but will NS find there sac?|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|rmb1: 3@H probably invitational, with 2NT sign-off (Lebensohl) not that North is being invited anywhere :)|pg||
nt|the saint: Has walked into a strong hidden West hand. If East can have that hand then West must be an absolute supermax pass|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|rodal f: A interesting 5@D. At right hand and a @H endplay?|pg||
nt|jlall: west decided to give up before any doubling started|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|h_karluk: i said DD solution, the reason is quite obvious, south's 4 hcp could be @d A, in that case your K works |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Snorri Sveinsson|pg||
nt|snorris: Hi|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: Hi there, wlcm|pg||
nt|the saint: If 2N is Leb and X can be weaker, shouldn't S transfer a King?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|hackenbush:  NS from Germany are Thomas Gotard and Jan-Hendrik De Wiljes|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jlall: best defense here is to pull the trumps and exit with a spade|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|snorris: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|jlall: so that fournier cant take any heart tricks|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|snorris: will top @cs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but then maybe the question is why they did not try slam|pg||
nt|snorris: its a good slam actually|pg||
nt|the saint: I must confess a vested interest. I have known NS since they were 14-15. |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|rmb1: Its rather an inaccurate position, if you "transfer a King" the TO double has a large effective range|pg||
nt|the saint: It will have a larger one simply through protecting|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: <my review, my analyse> 2@d huge underbid|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|rmb1: I met the "UK" team (asn TD) when they beat Oxford in the final of UK unniversities championship to qualify.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|the saint: North, Graeme, is better known as 'Daaaaaaave' (long story) and South, David, as 'Mr Fish'.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|snorris: think 2@ds is gf and 3nt showing flat hand|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|d8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|rodal f: UPS:( Had time to wait for that. Test ure @H!!!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|the saint: In fact, I don't think I have called them Graeme or David for at least 3 years|pg||
pc|hK|nt|snorris: but west should continue|pg||
nt|rmb1: It was confusing to have two davids in the team when one was referred to Fish and one non-David was referred to a Daaaave|pg||
nt|the saint: Graeme is actually his middle name. His passport says David|pg||
nt|rmb1: There is a debate on BBF on responding to (2M)-P-(P)-X-(P) with CAQxxxx and an outside A: is it too good for 3@C?|pg||
nt|the saint: It looks like Mr Fish can only make two more|pg||
nt|the saint: If he attempts to set up the club he gets forced in spades|pg||
nt|the saint: http://ubridge2010.nsysu.edu.tw/result/round.php?rid=2 - link to latest results|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then west still could be able to dictate|pg||
pc|hT|mc|5|nt|jlall: so a bit unlucky that NS couldn't make a game|pg||
nt|jlall: but had roger bid 2@S the damage would have been a little bit less|pg||
nt|hackenbush:  Lee is an applied math and economics double major from Caltech. Fournier is a business management major from University of Tennessee.|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|kdr_fm: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush:  Both have represented the US numerous times in junior international tournaments.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|snorris: they play weak nt|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in a natural sys there would be some remedy : ie uncontested 1N>3@s (mild slam invite at diamonds)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi karel|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: gotcha thanks|pg||
nt|snorris: schaltz with a wild 3@hs|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Karel and welcome. Nice to see u:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rmb1: UK did not bid on board 1 in OR, so China made 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Another slam for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: hackenbush is also a member of the USA A team :)|pg||
nt|jlall: kibitzers pointing out that 3N would make on the last hand if the defense chose to lead a spade rather than a heart, that is true|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: maybe in his area there are such trends, in general consumes space, not a good bid|pg||
pc|hK|nt|the saint: Is that some kind of 5 card stayman or other method? Can't see any reason for enquiring otherwise|pg||
nt|jlall: this hand is not cold, I think declarer will play to ruff a heart and ruff a diamond (if necessary) in the dummy|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jlall: then he would be at risk of losing 2 trump tricks to K9xx, but it's possible he can score his small trumps in his hand via ruffing also|pg||
pc|h6|nt|snorris: many ways to 10/11 tricks here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if somebody intends to do that in USA sectionals or regionals warning auto comes : dont try to play both sides of the table|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: looks like a good stop @d ruff avail plus 3 aces|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hackenbush:  The open room started on board 15-16, so that by the time they start playing board 1 and on, there will be score comparisons.|pg||
nt|jlall: so it wouldn't surprise me to see declarer never touch trumps until the end|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|rmb1: Perhaps he would have the option of finding/showing a small doubleton and playing 4-3 H|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzjr: Unlegal first lead, TD|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: NS use kickback RKC 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: 4@s show 0/3, 4N ask @dQ|pg||
nt|jlall: now something like winning the DA, ace of hearts heart ruff, diamond to the king and a diamond seems likely. Winning the DA and leading one towards the king later in case lee has 5 ...|pg||
nt|jlall: diamonds, that way Fournier would only have the option of ruffing air|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|rodal f: Hard to see any road to bid 4@H EW. Any ideas Hamdi and Karel?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzjr: the first round is @C5-@C8-@CK-@CA|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Now the contract is 5@D by West|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: 6@d show @dQ and no other Ks|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|the saint: If South had covered, the 6,5 and 4 of clubs were eventually going to be promoted|pg||
nt|the saint: May concede an overtrick of they get too active. |pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|snorris: and 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|sT|nt|rmb1: Or more than one|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: sound line|pg||
nt|jlall: playing the SQ first seems risky...if they won and came back a spade you may have 2 diamond losers 1 spade loser and 1 heart loser|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: And right u was:)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jlall: he can survive this line though by simply cashing a diamond, playing ace of clubs ruff a club and exiting a diamond|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jlall: they get 2 diamonds, but have to give him the 2 spades at the end|pg||

nt|andyv:  Hi Walter, Jan, Roland and all|pg||
nt|janm: 3NT is pretty ambitious - I don't want to jinx "my" team by saying that they'll probably beat it, but it does look as if NS can get 5 tricks before EW can get to 9, even after EW ...|pg||
nt|janm: score 2 spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h being played in CR|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|janm: Declarer really doesn' thave anywhere to go for tricks except clubs, and they don't lie well at all for him - 4@h is also slated to go down, of course|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i understand the two-way raises over X but S seems like the prefect hand to use 2@C to show the pref for a @D lead on the way to 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  if @cs were 3-3, 4@h might have some play on an endplay.|pg||
nt|janm: Not clear whether declarer wants to run the hearts to force NS to pitch or preserve the heart entries to lead clubs towards his hand - he doesn't know N has all the club honors, ...|pg||
nt|janm: after all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: hi all, declarer still pondering as you can see on the live video :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Diamond to the king, one to the ace and exit a spade|pg||

nt|h_karluk: in case 4-4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Howard and specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: EW is playing a strong club system, west can have on 4@hs and about 9 hcps|pg||
nt|jlall: 3N looks like the best game|pg||
nt|jlall: and fournier is angling towards that with 2N|pg||
nt|jlall: I predict a 3N bid from lee, he has spade help and very slow values|pg||
nt|jlall: of course, no game looks very good on this layout, it's tough to stop with 25 HCP|pg||
mb|3S|nt|h_karluk: how about 5/3|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT E/W - be hard now to get there|pg||
nt|jlall: lee might be considering bidding 3S as a choice of games|pg||
mb|d|an|do not suggest lead !S against 3N|nt|rodal f: Will E feel the open from N as music at the air?|pg||
nt|jlall: a bit scientific|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: As 4@S also was on.|pg||
nt|the saint: Off centre rebid best on that shape. N/S are playing straightforward 2/1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will try to do my best. AND SPECS. Come with inputs:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: maybe that's why east is hesitate to compete|pg||
nt|jlall: perhaps he's worried fournier only has K9x of spades or so|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: This may boil down to guessing the @D queen. Two trumps and a spade loser seem assured|pg||
nt|jlall: now after the "don't lead spades" double, I think lee will certainly bid 3N|pg||
nt|jlall: the only thing that argues for hearts about his hand is that he has good trumps, everything else is very notrumpy|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: however, a @D give more challenge to 3N, declarer has only 1 @S trick|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|snorris: if you take it with ace east just ducks @s next time to keep connected with west|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @sA+ @dA+@dQ|pg||
nt|the saint: It may be difficult to get a complete count on the hand, so it is possible with the trump length being with W that Mr Fish will play E for the diamond length|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: the other thing is that he wants to play it from his side probably, but fournier would XX 3@S with the ace|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kevin Wilson|pg||
nt|jlall: Hi Kevin|pg||
nt|grypho:  Hi|pg||

nt|rmb1: As Alan suggest 4@S was off on board 2, so a huge 15IMP to China-A|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jlall: close to making on a partial strip now, but south would get a club ruff|pg||
nt|grypho:  if clubs were 3-3 a partial elimination might work, but not here|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|jlall: if he pulls 2 diamonds and allt he trumps, north can just play a spade|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|grypho:  any hocus pocus you can see J?|pg||
nt|jlall: nope|pg||
nt|jlall: not even double dummy|pg||
nt|jlall: single dummy he's just going to hope the club jack or queen is onside im sure|pg||
nt|grypho:  yes, it seems like all roads lead to 1 down unless N makes a significant mistake and cashes the @cAce|pg||

nt|jlall: do you think he should have bid 3N kevin? or was he right to try and rightside it with all of his kings and spade queen?|pg||
nt|jlall: he probably got to the better game (1 club honor onside) so it couldnt have been too bad|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kdr_fm: I open pretty light and even 4441 I'd still pass N - but worked very well here keeping E/W out of a cold game|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|grypho:  I think he should have bid 3nt because there was no reason to expect an extra trick in hearts.  I take partner's 2NT bid seriously|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s4|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|jlall: both games are really bad anyways hehe|pg||

pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|the saint: He can work out W is 4-4-x-x from the spade carding and trump length. I don't think he can work out any more. E is therefore 4-2-x-x so it becomes 7:5 to play East for the @D Q?|pg||

mb|p|nt|jlall: its a rare hand where you have to save red vs white |pg||
nt|grypho:  true sorry, @h easy to find from N|pg||

pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: in my book that's "the trap deal" |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: hard enough to play seeing all the cards - you can pitch a club on a spade (stop the S hand being forced) so comes down to which way you play the @h's|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ure nr 1?:)|pg||

nt|jlall: NS would do well to compete here|pg||
nt|hackenbush:  there's a saying...don't let them play 2@h|pg||
mb|2S|nt|snorris: a fair one|pg||
nt|othered1: Just tying to conjure up a rationale for the double|pg||
nt|jlall: this auction is a little different, since EW did not guarantee a fit|pg||
nt|jlall: i think gotard did very well to balance|pg||
nt|jlall: some might make a hypermodern X of 1@H with the south hand but I don't think that's their style|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: prev deal 7@d would pay 800|pg||
nt|zman1: wonder if owen will underlead the K@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: Often OK to watch the way to the max|pg||

nt|zman1: shih will bid 3@S to show max here after 3@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: yes, 3@s shd be 7 reese points|pg||
nt|jlall: if the club hook is on you might be able to pitch your heart and make on 3-1 spades, or you might just play for 2-2 spades|pg||
nt|hackenbush:  open room had a chance to make 3n on a strip squeeze after N ducked @sA and S wasted @s9 signalling, but declarer took the wrong view.|pg||

pc|s2|nt|jlall: more fundamentally, if you have a sure entry there's no reason to duck|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|rodal f: @HK as lead I was waiting for. Then NS could get 5 tricks by a @D10 returne in at @CQ.|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|rmb1: Losing to @HQ was a six loser, so -1 now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|jlall: I don't think I would have balanced with Gotard's hand, he did very well and probably saved 6 imps|pg||
nt|jlall: these small hands add up|pg||
nt|grypho:  but you would have doubled with south?|pg||
nt|jlall: i would have|pg||
nt|jlall: i guess that shows my general philosophy to get in early so you don't have to worry about it later hehe|pg||
nt|grypho:  i'm not that modern, i much prefer shortness in the bid suit |pg||
nt|jlall: 2@S is not so risky though, lee won't have 4 spades to bid 1N and fournier has 6 hearts so he's unlikely to have 4 spades...at least if you're wrong you don't often get doubled|pg||
nt|jlall: so it was a calculated bid by gotard|pg||
nt|grypho:  what about rebidding 2@c instead of 2@h?|pg||
nt|jlall: not a fan with hearts as good as KQJT9x, but in general yes i like it|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|kdr_fm: @s best chance now hoping N played @Sj from @SKJxxx orginally|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|jlall: suits that are 1 loser for sure opposite a stiff are special to me and should  be bid forever. bidding clubs can work out sometimes in helping partner evaluate though|pg||

nt|cappjr:  n will smile|pg||
nt|iceking: and east 1nt or?|pg||
nt|cappjr:  not me |pg||
nt|cappjr:  an ace and a trump|pg||
nt|othered1: my partner plays 11HX|pg||
nt|cappjr:  glp|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi Snorri:)|pg||
nt|the saint: Yup. And you can see how old it has made me|pg||
nt|the saint: Now East is second guessing because he didn't bid his hand properly in the first place|pg||
nt|rmb1: Ugly 1NT has left East bidding his major at 3 level|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@HX|pg||
nt|iceking: i dont think east should sit here most of the time when they try to nail you at 1 level they gottit!|pg||
nt|cappjr:  whos to say it can get better|pg||
nt|cappjr:  1 level is cheap|pg||
nt|iceking: anyway east has though one trump and a ace so could expect 200-500 |pg||
nt|jlall: lee's double is responsive, fourniers 3@S shows a strong hand|pg||
nt|jlall: lee is now thinking his hand is super-duper awesome, not expecting his partner to also have a stiff spade|pg||
mb|4S|nt|snorris: Houmøller keeping it a live...will e-w strike?|pg||
nt|snorris: and bid 4+|pg||
nt|snorris: ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: never give up Andreas, this is your 2nd day and we believe you'll be successful|pg||
nt|pelu: no be - he is :)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: whoa now thats alot a bidding vul with 2 points between an opening bid and a redouble|pg||
nt|snorris: Hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: re|pg||
nt|snorris: south 4@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: so he has chosen to bid 4@S to show such a hand|pg||
nt|jlall: now the textbook bid with fourniers shape would be 4N to see what partners longest suit is|pg||
nt|jlall: hes not really thinking slam with this hand opposite a passed hand|pg||
mb|5N|nt|jlall: I guess he is :)|pg||
nt|grypho:  I like 3@s from Fournier, but he will have to put the brakes on quick.  The @sK is useless|pg||
mb|p|nt|sjicheng: it's difficult for any games here|pg||
mb|6D|nt|the saint: North's 2@S bid is a fine example of what is known in English U20 circles as a 'Chucker Raise'. Backing in later with support, trying either to go for 800 or collect 670. |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: as i predicted 4@s quite normal contract in such auctions and 5@c nine out of ten would receive double|pg||
nt|snorris: and north 5@ds?|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: yes|pg||
nt|the saint: Named for junior James 'Chucker' Thrower who was a master of it|pg||
nt|rmb1: A manouvre we are capable of (however non-U20)|pg||
nt|grypho:  Lee can't have more then @cA, @dAQ and still be a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: well well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: should have been misjudged|pg||
nt|iceking: 3sp 2d 1club and what 3-4 trump tricks for 800-1100 |pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: well 200 for e-w is better then 170|pg||
nt|rmb1: ... we are all capable of|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Note in board  3, north light-response then pass|pg||
nt|jlall: honestly this is not the worst slam ever, trumps coming in is close to 50/50 a priori, but the opps who have 11 spades only bidding to the 2 level is usually a strong indication ...|pg||
nt|jlall: that they dont have singletons|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: x xx AQxxx Axxxx ?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|grypho:  not a horrible slam, but i only like to bid the ones that make|pg||
nt|jlall: still i think fournier probably overbid his hand|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|sjicheng: -2 as i can c so far|pg||
nt|jlall: AQxxx Axxxx partner can bid slam himself after we bid 3@S|pg||
nt|jlall: and i'm pretty sure roger would open that|pg||
nt|grypho:  @@vugraph, that hand gets opened|pg||
nt|jlall: even x xxx AQxx Axxxx offers basically no play for slam |pg||
pc|s2|pc|h4|pc|sQ|nt|jlall: but again, if i had these 2 hands I would want to play slam when the opps only bid to 2@S|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|cappjr:  nice play cam|pg||
nt|jlall: we can eliminate south ever having a stiff diamond for example|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|rmb1: UK continue to pick up 1 or 2 IMP, but not catching up on the early boards|pg||
nt|sjicheng: sry -1|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dT|nt|h_karluk: so far @d finesses never worked, always located Kx two times offside|pg||
pc|s3|nt|the saint: But I have much more sympathy for East's auction to 3@H next door|pg||
nt|iceking: i dont envy W here|pg||
nt|jlall: its just impossible|pg||

mb|1S|mb|1N|an|4!H 5+!c|nt|janm: They're playing very fast here - notice that we're now ahead of the Closed Room even though this table played boards 15 & 16 while the other started with 1|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|andyv:  unusual NT by W|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: A good hand for the sandwich NT to show 4 cards in the unbid Major and longer in the unbid minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  sorry... meant sandwich|pg||
nt|janm: 2@s probably promised 4 of them|pg||
nt|andyv:  although who ever came up with the convention "raptor" had some imagination.|pg||
nt|andyv:  can be down 2 with A@c lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: It was a convention first played by the poles|pg||
nt|bigtrain: more likely a @D lead|pg||
nt|janm: After this NT bid, some players use DBL to show a 3 card raise - others take advantage of all the cue bids to be able to make a penalty oriented double and also show 3 card ...|pg||
nt|janm: support, but most require 4 card support for the raise - that made it easy for Lien to bid game|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: but this showed specifically 4@H5+@c, not 4@H 5+m|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  hence the difference|pg||
nt|andyv:  right again Walter|pg||

nt|h_karluk: fair without doubled|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s auto off one|pg||
nt|snorris: ok|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but that doesn't mean bad contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just wondered abough the NT levels EW. By 2/1 it often use to be 15-17     18-19     20-21 If so E hade 20 for 2NT a open|pg||
nt|sjicheng: yeah, he may concern about the weak C suit|pg||
nt|jlall: wow, he started with the @DA? I guess he did not agree with my assessment!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A good save we precume:)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3@d or 4@d ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for me a puzzle|pg||
nt|cappjr:  oops|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|the saint: They gave away trump control next door before the club could be established for a spade pitch|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|4H|nt|snorris: is Schaltz to good for 2@hs?|pg||
nt|jlall: if south had 5 spades and a stiff diamond, he would certainly bid more than 2@S. If north had 7 spades it is extremely unlikely he would bid 1S then pass, and even if he had south ...|pg||
nt|jlall: might well bid 3S with 4 spades and a stiff anyways|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: What happend now by EWs system?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: say west has same hand and shape in addition with @hQ, would you x as passed hand or still overcall a spade?:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|snorris: this is not going to win|pg||
nt|h_karluk: personally when both vul at 2nd seat i do not support 3 level preempts when there is an unpassed partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: nope - will end play S at some point but I cant see 9 tricks|pg||
nt|grypho:  seemed 100% to play @d the other way, but we've moved on|pg||
nt|grypho:  alot of exciting and challenging boards here|pg||
nt|jlall: normally with 4 spades you bid 4@S on this auction over the 2nd double|pg||
nt|jlall: however with the heart king, 4 small spades, and some defensive values and a min gotard chose to pass, seems quite reasonable to me|pg||
nt|grypho:  He's downgrading the Kx of @hs|pg||
nt|grypho:  not a fun decision|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjr: about the screen: the procedure is not followed properly|pg||
nt|rodal f: If a @H comes?|pg||
nt|rodal f: -1|pg||
nt|iceking: could 2d be bal 19-20 and 3club stayman |pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: i almost "neder2 X with 5 card major|pg||
nt|pelu: "never"|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: and 5@D is making under any first lead|pg||
nt|iceking: some italian pairs play this way |pg||
nt|rodal f: By last board and this it seems to be (15) - 18|pg||
nt|jlall: 4@S looks like its down and 4@H is down at least 1 and probably more, so I'd say he made a good choice|pg||
nt|grypho:  I bid 4@s though because I do have 4@s, and patner may well have a stiff @c on this auction|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: oh yes, that's the general tendency|pg||
nt|iceking: in teams iam not sure w should try to look for major fit its so often correct just stay in 3nt with 30hcp and 2 bal hands|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: Any for @HQ from N?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|the saint: All the cards lying well for NS. This could and should be IMPs back. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: China A E-W 2NT = m's 5-5|pg||
nt|grypho:  stiff @h of course|pg||
nt|jlall: 4@S did make in the other room, but by south so they led a diamond|pg||
nt|jlall: played by north east would lead a heart|pg||
nt|jlall: and west would have a very obvious club ace shift|pg||
nt|jlall: north opened 1C, and west has 6 and dummy has 4|pg||
nt|grypho:  good detective work|pg||
nt|jlall: so in this room im fairly confident 4@S would be set|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzph: draw 1 club 1 spade play @h j back|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: He wont be unhappy atm though if the @cQ is with south Qxx 3NT cold|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|the saint: Blockage in the spade pips may make it tricky to extract the max though|pg||
nt|sjicheng: tks howard, that means china also play multi 2D as i guess:)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|snorris: souths decision to not bid @ds turned out well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems next year we will see Andreas at the field, chill bro :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|snorris: his hopes are up but now...|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jlall: wow|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kdr_fm: I could hear tat DOH from here :>|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: If a @S is played early enough it came be some fun. Else -1. Or more by some funny try's|pg||
nt|snorris: turns to @hs|pg||
nt|snorris: hx in north is a chance|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: I think he should have finessed the @h 1st no real rush to play clubs (unless 3@d was a 6 card suit ... vul ??)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still puzzle hand for me|pg||
nt|snorris: agree with the @h finesse first time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: most likely i would try to win the match at another board|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well he knows N 7/4 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: should hvae played @S before second c|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: have*|pg||
nt|h_karluk: gotcha|pg||
nt|rodal f: As cards lay ure right Andreas.|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: even if i could not see it i would try to think this way|pg||
nt|othered1: agree|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|snorris: got a @d lead|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kdr_fm: so 1@D, 2@c, 3@S, 2@H = 8 best he can i think|pg||
nt|jlall: north was just happy to cash out|pg||
nt|jlall: from his point of view if east has a club, clubs are 3-3 and they can be set up|pg||
nt|jlall: normal defense but on this layout a disaster|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: maybe sometimes we abandon to think split honors idea mostly works|pg||
nt|rmb1: East needed to cover @S10 to create the blockage|pg||
nt|the saint: When in with the spades, Mr Fish now needs to find the right red suit switch. Daaaaave can now show suit pref to diamonds.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|grypho:  must be right to win this in hand and play @d|pg||
nt|jlall: on best defense, declarer would have to guess to smother the @DT for -2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: Bit hard to see the @C layout so not unnormal try|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however things not predictable there|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: no rush playing second @c|pg||
nt|rodal f: @HA and @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: @h 10 back |pg||
nt|snorris: lacks one trick still|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: complete count now - S didnt return a @D doesnt have one so 1174 N|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|snorris: and 9 tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sjicheng: entryless to table....|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rmb1: 7 from 87 was too subtle for South|pg||
nt|zman1: E may have ATx...since N/S do not lead attitude in the middle of the hand|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|the saint: That is poor from South. He can see 652 in dummy, 3 in his own hand and declarer played the 4|pg||
nt|jlall: but this is very normal|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: @S and finto|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: so should have played a low spade|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer draw the big picture 99% <he is supposed a good listener of the auction> but the question is was North honest with his 3@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: finito|pg||

mb|p|nt|zman1: X shows GF values with no clear bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why bid 3 when EW have the majors? OK, Can be right some few times|pg||
nt|iceking: 2h ugly bid |pg||
nt|iceking: but only 2 options |pg||
nt|cappjr:  especially after his last h o'call|pg||
nt|iceking: pass is not a option in my book|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|jlall: probably 1@D shows hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|zman1: X again?|pg||
nt|rodal f: X for cards?|pg||
nt|zman1: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: maybe 4@c to show @c and @h|pg||
nt|rodal f: But will he do?|pg||
nt|cappjr:  me neither|pg||
nt|jlall: and 2@D is an artificial GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 3@cs ?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rodal f: Only one killing lead against 6@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Snorri, you would better whisper, he might hear you:)|pg||
nt|zman1: does 4@C show @C and @H or @C and @D or @H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|othered1: This 2@H isn't exactly safe, either.|pg||
nt|iceking: now his pd can expect full values 2h here should be rather weakish hand |pg||
nt|iceking: cant |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: no snorris u bid 3@c with no stopper|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: best lead for defence|pg||
nt|snorris: NOW its a must to finesse @h first time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this contract might be an unanimously one at the field|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bridge is teamwork. But all up at the systems pair use. Seems as EW might felt down at a... here. Easyer at home than international|pg||
nt|zman1: i think he will get hearts right in 6@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: 4@c puppet 4@d, 4@h was a CoG bid|pg||
nt|cappjr:  missing a decent 3 nt|pg||

mb|3N|nt|cappjr:  i was plus 600|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: with a little in @cs I bid 3 @cs|pg||

nt|snorris: only one trick with no help therefore 3@cs|pg||
nt|snorris: then 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sjicheng: en!....|pg||
nt|rodal f: The normal lead against 3NT as 6@H?|pg||
nt|sjicheng: anyway they didn't go 6@H. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: need to guess in @S or @CAQ, not a great slam I think|pg||
nt|sjicheng: i thnk so. at least it's a good choice for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: oh and the u exp pd with Jxx to bid 3NT????|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i think 4@h has a chance after @s lead, say west decides to hold up|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: double @H finesse = 75% start withe the @h8 so as not to block|pg||
nt|zman1: its hard bidding 6@D knowing partner has 2@S|pg||
nt|iceking: well w just made a poor bid i just cant pass is an optionn here|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: he heard you:)|pg||
nt|jlall: not sure what the bidding means, but the play should be easy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|snorris: pd bids 3 nt with something in @cs|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|janm: How much can NS make here? |pg||
nt|bigtrain: strong club by S...  i orefer not to upgrade the hand though|pg||
nt|bigtrain: prefer|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 1@S shows 5+@S and is GF|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4D|an| |nt|janm: Will Dwyer accept 3NT or perhaps bid 4@d to show his second suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|bigtrain: how can he not make a try opposite a big club?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: very nice 4@S bid by owen|pg||
nt|janm: I'm not sure what the alert to 4@d is - it looks and sounds natural to me - maybe that it's a good hand as well as diamond length?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  was it alerted?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: yes, but I can't catch the explanation|pg||

mb|1H|nt|sjicheng: will anyone say anything with N hand right here?:)|pg||

mb|1N|nt|snorris: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 3nt is quit ok|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3rd seat, both vul, passed p|pg||

nt|rodal f: Do A say B as ure bid N?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|rodal f: Waited 2@H|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @hs is harsh|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Undo?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|iceking: not sure why east didnt bid 2clubs here looks rather standard |pg||
nt|othered1: selling at 2-level doesn't do much better at imps than at matchpoints|pg||
nt|iceking: or dbl if playing snapdragon|pg||
nt|sjicheng: ops.... they missed:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: West refused to compete, +200 I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzph: 10 minuts to 3 biards|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: boards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure, takk|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say 1@h, x, now an enterpsing partner would blatantly push to 4@h|pg||
nt|rodal f: What if W was 0@S and 5@H?|pg||
nt|zman1: alright =|pg||
nt|grypho:  i hate 3nt b/c it handcuffs partner... maybe 2n was non-forcing but otherwise i would have bid it|pg||
nt|jlall: 6@D will not make, 6@S would make on a likely heart lead|pg||
nt|jlall: yes 2N must be non forcing for him to jump|pg||
mb|4D|nt|snorris: 4@hs+1 as you predicted Hamid|pg||
nt|snorris: in open room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: dammit buddy, what a field :) c'est la vie|pg||
nt|zman1: 7-4 open 1N? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzph: sry :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then ew would have a dilemma|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3@h is alot even with the @CA sing adding 3 for singlton and another for the 5th diamond !!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do S have many botles energi drink by his side Howard?:)|pg||
nt|sjicheng: yes, with his 7hcp and with 2 Js |pg||
nt|grypho:  i think @s are out now and a diamond contract will be reached|pg||
nt|jlall: even 5@D is a pretty dicey contract, though safe on this layout|pg||
nt|jlall: south is probably thinking he has a pretty good hand for a diamond slam |pg||
nt|jlall: maybe he will cuebid 5@C|pg||
mb|4N|nt|snorris: on last board|pg||
nt|rodal f: NP:) U've done well.|pg||
nt|grypho:  it depends on if he knows its a 4-4 fit or it could be better|pg||
nt|jlall: yeah im not sure what the range of his 1N bid was, and what the implications are after that|pg||
nt|jlall: maybe this is 4N natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Agree. Time for a system to change|pg||
nt|jlall: 4N is also a little dicey but fine on this layout|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Got a chance now.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bach to the Roland hand|pg||
nt|grypho:  germany did well to avoid trouble here and will likely just lose an imp or 2|pg||
nt|jlall: yes|pg||
nt|jlall: nice stop|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: wonder sp or d now|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: hmmm|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|snorris: might be best to play for @d king and hope @s are bad..|pg||
nt|pelu: if he go wrong, then defense will set up the @h-suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: remember previous boards @d was Kx at neck|pg||
nt|snorris: then 3nt wins and 4@ss not|pg||
pc|d2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@c<X> i don't know pass is even close, what i know 1@d a very rare preference|pg||
nt|grypho:  i would've led the @s7.  if you want declarer to think @ss aren't breaking the 7 is harder to read,,, but its splitting hairs really|pg||
pc|s7|nt|snorris: looks strange..Andreas?|pg||
nt|jlall: yes the key point is definitely don't lead hearts|pg||
nt|jlall: partner didn't raise, and RHO bid 1N 3N 4N...hes got hearts locked up haha|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|h_karluk: i think 4@s also makeable|pg||

nt|othered1: now only @S guess is needed.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Always 20 - 20HPs and often 4 in a major at here, 4@S|pg||
nt|jlall: roger has to cash his HA now if he wants it|pg||

nt|snorris: 4 @ss CAN be beaten with a @d lead..|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: :)|pg||
nt|jlall: a very good grand here, you don't need to guess clubs if you can ruff 2 spades and pitch 2 clubs on the diamonds|pg||
nt|jlall: north could splinter but his hand is so good he may just want to be in control, and start with 2@S|pg||
nt|grypho:  i prefer to take control|pg||
mb|4S|nt|snorris: otherwice 5@hs is agood save|pg||
nt|zman1: 3@H is a mixed raise|pg||
nt|grypho:  i hate the splinter|pg||
nt|jlall: 4S is probably keycard|pg||
nt|jlall: i guess if youre going with 7 opposite 3 keycards, and 6 opposite 2 this could be a reasonable approach|pg||
nt|jlall: it doesnt seem like it could hurt to get some extra information though|pg||
nt|grypho:  i think you can only count 12 tricks... 1@s, 7@h, 3@d, and 2@c|pg||
nt|jlall: thats 13|pg||
nt|grypho:  lol|pg||
nt|jlall: you need partner to have 3 spades for that though|pg||
nt|jlall: but even if he doesnt the jack of diamonds would do it, or anything|pg||
nt|grypho:  yeah, but i'd be willing to risk it|pg||
nt|jlall: fournier considering bidding 5@S, feeling the impending doom?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: off one fair :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vugraphzjr: An interesting hand now|pg||
nt|sjicheng: so south's 1C is polish style?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Yes, Prussian Club :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzph: said 11 tricks:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Max 200 (if Xed) to pay for EW by a normal ........|pg||
nt|jlall: maybe w/r but w/w that would be insane|pg||
nt|grypho:  can you see who's thinking|pg||
nt|jlall: uh oh|pg||
nt|jlall: it looks like south has taken this as exclusion keycard|pg||
nt|jlall: since he has shown 2 without the queen|pg||
mb|6H|nt|rodal f: Take ure unlucky 500 or try to be smart?|pg||
nt|sjicheng: ou....it becomes more interesting...|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: could be a fdriendly joke :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not Bergen?|pg||
mb|p|nt|zman1: no...7-10ish with 4@S|pg||
nt|iceking: north should play spade ten here and return heart |pg||
nt|iceking: after east bidding he seldom has 4hearts |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzph: wrong hand for @d singel|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *friendly|pg||
nt|grypho:  good call|pg||

pc|h5|nt|the saint: Now needs to switch.|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: this could be off one|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|snorris: did west know south didnt have 6 @cs?|pg||

nt|snorris: twice as good to play for the drop of the Queen|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|the saint: The difficulty for S is that he can't see the weak diamond holding in the East hand. But he doesn't have any entries to the hearts so continuing them may be futile|pg||

nt|sjicheng: should be |pg||
nt|rodal f: Not that easy for S to count up N|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Yes, when S discard @CA, North should know S has no loser|pg||
nt|sjicheng: but i think HA is a reasonable discard here. it's hard for N to totally have no C|pg||
nt|rodal f: If NS use UDCA it should be clear by the @H|pg||
nt|sjicheng: and discard of HA will guide N to play C|pg||

nt|cappjr:  however 4h in other room|pg||
mb|1N|nt|snorris: double by east?|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: no|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  and appreciated to the organizators & Mr Bionic Man|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT or 5@C both make 3NT chances for +1 with the @d's|pg||
nt|the saint: Y, NS play multi Landy|pg||
nt|iceking: or with no tens and 9s maybe north should just invite |pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|h_karluk: 3c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes 3@c would be nice now|pg||
nt|snorris: 3nt healthier then 5@cs thats for sure|pg||
nt|jlall: again I don't know their system, just speculating as to what happened|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: by n 3n good bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  he is as you know well Roland Wald, untiring efforts again|pg||
nt|zman1: might lead the 5@H|pg||
nt|cappjr:  probably will|pg||
nt|iceking: not my style though i would just bid 3nt here|pg||
nt|sjicheng: en! a big gain for germany|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@D forced bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: And pass:)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|cappjr:  vul at imps|pg||
nt|sjicheng: ou? 2C is transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seem normal for me|pg||
nt|zman1: or 4@C idk how he feels today|pg||
nt|cappjr:  diamond q??|pg||
nt|cappjr:  no|pg||
nt|iceking: hard to lead diamond q here |pg||
nt|iceking: need to be some kind of artist to find that|pg||
nt|cappjr:  can be 12 more imps for usa|pg||
nt|sjicheng: but i think 2H is a quite ok contract as well|pg||
mb|4H|nt|snorris: 3@cs- 3nt...my guess|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like the pass by Martin Schaltz|pg||
nt|grypho:  kickback is wonderful if you never mess it up|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: but he could bid 3@c 1 level b4|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: xx Peter?|pg||
nt|pelu: pass dont tell about the long @cs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant would you consioder xx as N?|pg||
nt|snorris: I would |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i see|pg||
nt|snorris: if it shows 1 stopper|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classic|pg||
nt|pelu: Yes - some play that 2Nt = doubble stop and Rd = 1 stopper|pg||
nt|rmb1: Was X TO or just an invitational "noise"?|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|jlall: wow|pg||
nt|jlall: on this lead, lee is in great shape|pg||
pc|c4|nt|the saint: Don't know. Either way, 3@D kind of forced him into 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: T/O|pg||
nt|the saint: Should switch as North would have unblocked|pg||
nt|the saint: If he had the J|pg||
nt|jlall: as long as he chooses to duck, playing gotard for QT|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: bad contract. unsound|pg||
nt|the saint: 7 must be from a doubleton looking at the pips too|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: 20.30 we go ag|pg||
nt|grypho:  wow is right|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cappjr:  must leave now...bye all|pg||
nt|jlall: good play, he had to do it to have any hope in this contract|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pelu: they missed the game - but +7 IMP - if briidge fair :):):)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like anything else is too slow (as the cards lie).|pg||
pc|d7|nt|iceking: thx Mike|pg||
nt|jlall: de wiljes trying to tap the dummy in desperation|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes sir:)|pg||
nt|jlall: lee should have put up the king there for sure imo|pg||
nt|jlall: this was a good play by de wiljes though, his best hope|pg||
nt|jlall: he did it very smoothly so lee was taken in|pg||
nt|grypho:  i'm all for maintaining end positions, but how could it cost?|pg||
nt|grypho:  he had entry problems as it was and there was a free chance for a trick AND an entry|pg||
nt|jlall: its a tough problem now|pg||
nt|jlall: he may choose to play a spade off dummy, and put in the 9 if south ducks|pg||
nt|jlall: that would be a winning line|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: Wasn't the first at my mind. 2@C often used as force by a auto 2@D answer|pg||
nt|jlall: good recovery|pg||
nt|jlall: now if he still plays north for the DA...|pg||
nt|grypho:  he wont, the @s king was good news|pg||
nt|jlall: brutal hand for lee|pg||
nt|jlall: if north has the trump king and the DA, he has to pitch here|pg||
nt|jlall: he has to consider the lead of a club|pg||
nt|jlall: with JT of diamonds, maybe north would prefer a diamond lead|pg||
nt|jlall: on the other hand if north had the DA and the HK, a spade back might have been fine in this position to set lee|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d8|nt|h_karluk:  plase follow BBO VG schedule, kibitzers proudly welcomed, bye for now|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: pairs finesse the @d8 :>|pg||
nt|snorris: west wmight go up with th ace and hope for 3 tricks in @hs in easts hand|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|othered1: That's simplifed the hand for declarer.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|snorris: thx all bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: the end thx evryone bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: for now|pg||
nt|iceking: not the best def declarer has 9 top winners now 10 even |pg||
nt|sjicheng: 2C is a forcing free bid normally:)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|iceking: so 12 more imps for USA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jlall: so lee has changed his mind about the diamond suit because north would probably not play the DJ there if that was the layout|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|the saint: A wobbly moment here. Needs to guess who has the @C K|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: -2?|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S now|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|jlall: well done|pg||
pc|c3|nt|the saint: If North has it, he has to burn the @H entry to finesse|pg||
pc|cT|nt|grypho:  very well done by lee|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|snorris: 1@c and then 1@s might not have shown a distributed hand..then south has problems bidding 3 @c insted of redouble|pg||

nt|sjicheng: :)|pg||
nt|sjicheng: looks like a straigh forward 4H?|pg||
nt|rodal f: By a @H lead?|pg||
nt|jlall: he played neither of them for the @DA :P|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|othered1: This can find its way to 4@H, or maybe 2 or 3N|pg||
nt|grypho:  fatal @c lead by N though but lee successfully takes advantage|pg||
mb|1S|nt|the saint: So Dec gave himself a potential losing play|pg||
nt|zman1: 3@C by S|pg||
nt|zman1: i think theyre doing normal puppet..|pg||
nt|jlall: yes a club was a very active choice, could have worked well but not on this layout|pg||
mb|1N|nt|zman1: so 3@D|pg||
nt|iceking: 4h seems like normal spot|pg||
nt|jlall: hehe|pg||
mb|p|nt|zman1: 3@H by S|pg||
nt|iceking: but should fail |pg||
nt|othered1: Standard auction of 1@C-1@H-2@D-2@H- 3@H - ?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jlall: did fournier really pass 1@C?|pg||

mb|p|nt|zman1: 3@S by N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|zman1: 4@C by S|pg||
nt|iceking: yes i like that 2d better bid then 2nt|pg||
nt|othered1: But they're not playing exactly standard.|pg||
nt|sjicheng: em.... but i think these young men are going|pg||
nt|sjicheng: 3nt is nice spot:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: The ultimat contract this time:) 4@H and @H=-1|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rmb1: Two almost identical results 3NT= v 3C= sees China's lead increase overwhelmingly|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Sorry for the miss |pg||
pc|hA|nt|zman1: then kevin might bid 4@D and let him takeover or 4N|pg||
nt|othered1: In USA it's forcing at least for 1 round.|pg||
nt|rodal f: @H lead is -1*|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sjicheng: now?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|rodal f: When * I correct my last sentence, Sr Shi.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: A @S switch is going to down|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|othered1: Looking more like 11D is negative|pg||
nt|iceking: yes strong club it is |pg||
nt|iceking: wonder why S broke the transfer |pg||
nt|jlall: roger is a big believer in leading a heart on this kind of hand, I'm a big believer in leading a spade...you have no entry and a topless suit, it's not that likely a heart will do ...|pg||
nt|jlall: anything|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|the saint: Possible swing back here. N/S are climbing without oxygen nw|pg||
nt|the saint: E/w sorry|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is 4@C Gerber?  Otherwise what is 4@D.  EW got too high anyway.|pg||
nt|the saint: Splinter and cue?|pg||
nt|the saint: E/W aren't old enough to use Gerber|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: spl. said E/w|pg||
nt|othered1: That is quite a good playing hand for @H.|pg||
nt|jlall: but if you catch partner with 3 hearts and the opps 2-2 it can work|pg||
pc|d5|nt|zman1: just needed a 2-2 @S break|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u make N as the main hand. Any safe play?|pg||
nt|sjicheng: yes, that's the price of greedy|pg||
pc|d2|nt|zman1: if west has QJ9x@S u cant do anything|pg||
nt|sjicheng: does that means the spade switch is not found?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: It's hard to find, though|pg||
nt|sjicheng: is there any smoking break for U champions?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Yes, now a toilet break|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: still 40 min for this round so I think it's ok :)|pg||
nt|sjicheng: ic:)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|iceking: yes maybe its fine|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rmb1: 4@D is "ambitious" opposite a splinter with a minimum and poor trumps|pg||
nt|the saint: Ah, the cuebidding roundabout - once you get on it, you can never get off in time|pg||
nt|rmb1: When Alan became almost old enough to play Gerber he co-invented sliding rainbow gerber where any bid from 4@C+ could be Gerber|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|grypho:  i'm a fan of a spade.  i dont think its even a choice|pg||

nt|rmb1: Real IMPs to UK when West recognised the need not to cue bid over 4@C|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|the saint: Took the side turning before the roundabout|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H is a normal spot, and should make much of the time.|pg||

nt|iceking: 3clubs is just 2 agressive |pg||

nt|iceking: yes it looks better to me also w should try shoot out some game here|pg||
nt|sjicheng: ou... he really came in....|pg||
nt|jlall: 2@C might be a transfer advance showing diamonds|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: No doubble no troubble|pg||
nt|zman1: -3ish|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Rainbow Gerber is documented at the wonderful but moribund poor bridge site http://www.poorbridge.com/?misc=28|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Last B was a interesting one for play as safe as u can.|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: That is the old version. Since then we have modified it and added Last Train Gerber and Over the Top Gerber, where both members of the pair can bid Gerber in the same auction.|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|jlall: north has deduced that south has some club length, and stiff K acts well as a stopper -- when they don't know you have stiff K|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: now they have 2 @C stopper|pg||
nt|grypho:  any club but the queen|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|zman1: there are only 4 layouts that kevin would go wrong|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jlall: this lead is quite poor in my opinion|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: still far from making|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|rmb1: I hope all this work has not modified Gerber to a point where it might be useful :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Tell|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rodal f: @C8 can be a hard card for E to find id @D@D@D|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|the saint: EW can wriggle, but I can't see an endplay here. So it is down to NS to misdefend this|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|jlall: declarer is still down as long as no one panicks|pg||
nt|grypho:  only 8 clear tricks though|pg||
nt|jlall: the normal thing to do is lead the @C ace wheny ou hold a side ace. |pg||
nt|jlall: that way you can pick up Kx or Jx on the second round|pg||
nt|grypho:  talk to him about it :)|pg||
nt|jlall: on this auction RHO is a big favorite to have only 2 clubs though, he showed long diamodns and hearts. So if I had to guess I'd say Kx on right is more likely than Kxx and Jx in ...|pg||
nt|jlall: dummy|pg||
nt|jlall: so if gotard plays a spade here|pg||
nt|jlall: fournier must pop and shift to hearts|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c3|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Would have worked quite nicely here, and 3@H is certainly an underbid... my main concern with 3N though is when partner has a doubleton spade|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: west will get the bad news in trumps (not unexpected when south had 3@S) and will push hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: @C8 will make declarer to cash @H|pg||
nt|rodal f: As now |pg||
nt|sjicheng: but no harm for contract seems|pg||

nt|jlall: although if it was Q876, declarer would have AJx opp xx|pg||
nt|jlall: and would likely not duck trick 1|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jlall: anyways, declarer has a chance|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jlall: a small diamond to the king and then the CQ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jlall: yes|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||

nt|sjicheng: em.... another big win for german|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jlall: that hesitation is scary :)|pg||
mc|10|nt|rodal f: Max was 500 but very hard to find. Belive 300 will give some IMPs|pg||

nt|vugraphzjr: east could have bid 3@s instead of 4, but i think its hard to stay at 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Roland on again|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Many thanks to Bridge Base Online and our great commentators!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Many thanks to Brdige Base Online and our great commentators!|pg||
nt|jlall: well played by lee|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: 54 imps in 16 boards is like 25-3 in vp |pg||

mb|1N|nt|rodal f: As for ure nice work Edward and Shi|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: this might end here |pg||
nt|othered1: what a way to bid the east hand, even if it likely shows @S and minor|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: that R/W overcall is... not my choice|pg||
mb|3N|nt|the saint: Looks like both games are doomed and only double dummy play will keep 3N one off|pg||
nt|grypho:  routine 3nt?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: wow, 3@h -- X seems much better if he is going to take a call|pg||
nt|sjicheng: it's my pleasure:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: streetfight is under the reality|pg||
pc|s4|nt|the saint: A chance NS could end up in 4S|pg||
nt|iceking: might as well open 1h instead |pg||
nt|grypho:  does an imp matter?|pg||
mc|10|nt|lmeili: pls come back in 15 mins|pg||
nt|jlall: should be an exciting final 3 matches to this event, it will be very close in the 2nd-5th spots now most likely|pg||
