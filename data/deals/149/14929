nt|lestergold: Morning hAANS AND HI SPECS|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: do we know the systems?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone !|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|haans: Hi Georgio|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello Hans :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Hello Geoffrey|pg||
nt|bridge_one: :)|pg||
nt|haans: and Hi Goeffrey|pg||
nt|bridge_one: always with smile !|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D after passed hand - i agree|pg||
nt|haans: me 2 but will EW find spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems normal yes|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|haans: one wonder what Naesten Juniors had deceided |pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 3nt to start with|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 5@C looks likely which should be ok|pg||
nt|haans: weak nT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 6 @C West prefere to play @C (also because the hand is weak)|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|haans: nothing|pg||
nt|jcwla: A potential swing board here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|roswolf: n/s use the weak nt it seems|pg||
nt|sharkey: weak NT...|pg||
nt|haans: popular im Denmark have i been told|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: should end up in 21S|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: appears South lucked out with 2@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: YUP|pg||
nt|sharkey: finding pd with 4 card fit|pg||
nt|haans: money on 2nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: my pd usually has two cards in the suit...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Both partnerships play nat 5-card MI best MI  (11)12-14|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Both pairs play natural 5MA best MI   (11)12-14NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i suppose 3nt is possible too if east bids|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by East is natural strong hand|pg||
nt|haans: East bidding 2@S im sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: usual light opener misfit hand overboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Bridgeministeriet means The Ministery of Bridge. The minister himself is the Danish national team player Gregers Bjarnasson, who do not play. But he is happy with his team and sent ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yesterday a sms after his boys won the semifinal. You declared and defended very well the minister wrote. Normally nice words like these do not come out of his mouth. |pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|haans: accept that bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: i will also:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: thx for the info peter|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for just 2|pg||
nt|sharkey: Problem here may be E is "too strong" - has to do it all himself|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry Hans|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: 5 Ma oc|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: So 2NT is as yoy see15-17 |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: I ssume that north did not come in with 2@s as shown|pg||
nt|lestergold: it must have been East's rebid|pg||
nt|haans: yep but no hard done|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D had been possible|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|bridge_one: the rule here is to bid for new suit only with interesting hand - perfect 3@C (and not DBL, by West) - only finding a interesting hand in West became usefull to bid the @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probablyh 4@D by North would work better, but not in this layout (4@s the same)|pg||
nt|haans: other rules if MP:)|pg||
nt|haans: but most slams in m stay in 3nt|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: sry 2s in east of corse|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if declarer found first round finesse of ten hearts its off|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bridge_one: correct way to play against Q10xx in South|pg||
nt|haans: playing safe|pg||
nt|lestergold: no harm done by operator only harm done by e/w|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: i would have played 4 rounds of spades ending in dummy|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: my book east didnt have an opener|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: agree Geoff - need help here - make them start discarding -|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D better bid than 2@D by W|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|haans: 2@S better than "@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: very much so|pg||
pc|dT|nt|h_karluk: Lars Moller is a very experienced player in the International field. Tenerife 2005 , Jesolo 2007, Beijing 2008 and Brasov 2009. Represented his country in Juniors category.|pg||

nt|andyv:  6@s will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: 2@c = Gameforce with @c|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|hedyg: no transfers|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: they probably won't reach 6@S - even relay precision methods aren't usually geared to finding a 4-2 fit at the 6-level  |pg||
nt|andyv:  type:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  typo|pg||

nt|lestergold: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Mike :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Mike Graham|pg||
nt|santyclz: This probably shouldn't make but it wouldn't be surprising if it does.|pg||
nt|jcwla: I like the choice of a simple @D bid -- but then I like both suits to be at least remotely decent to show a two-suiter.  Here, if pd led away from a high honor in @C's, it could be ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: disaster.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all (still just about morning here in London) |pg||
pc|h7|nt|kiwibridge: hi Mike welcome|pg||
nt|henryb:  Who else thinks that North has overbid (if 3@h would have been non-forcing)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|andyv:  a difficult hand for their system?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, it seems the pass of 2@D did not show anything -- for many it would show at least GF values.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Mike|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: hm this duck has allowed declarer to make what looked like an impossible contract on the heart lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in England many pairs use 2@C...2NT as invitational in NT, not necessarily showing a four card major. NS obviously treat it differently  |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Gary, Bas|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think n overbid with 2@c, but realize it's played differently by many people.|pg||
nt|henryb:  but crime is not punished: the duck at trick one gave the 10th trick|pg||

nt|haans: soon will bidding start at 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w need to be a little careful here|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i was born in the 19th century|pg||
nt|haans: openings nowdays are light|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Konow-Hagen play releay precision  system card here http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=375|pg||
nt|lestergold: light is ok that was featherlight bad hand bad suit not my idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: slam possible here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|roswolf: and may well make it|pg||
nt|haans: will try clubs before spades so slam a make|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm an aggressive opening ny east|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyone X the 1@S?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|roswolf: precisely|pg||
nt|roswolf: west should now recognise the duplication in the red suits|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S suprise|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad tencount not mandatory even today|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: this is the first of two segments in the semi final - total of 24 boards|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D gf|pg||
nt|roswolf: artificial gf i think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 points but A A and the Q in the long suit - today many pair open with that cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 4@S LOOKS MORE CHALLENGING|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: X=Inviting to game in H or better|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D here lighter|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Jepsen-Sørensen play nat 5 card MA best mi (11)12-14 NT|pg||
nt|haans: but precision need not 11-15 anymore|pg||
nt|lestergold: well lets see where this opener gets them|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sharkey: artificial|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|haans: accept x  if non vul|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: well it looks like south may be allowed to catch up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 3@s instead dbl by west would be possible|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here the problem is to call 4@H giving the idea to make a overbid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: 2D=GF check back|pg||
nt|sharkey: common to play 2@C as invitational - also in Denmark I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Peter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: otherwise too easy the defence at 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: might scrape this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: His partner Emil Jepsen in same frequency. Prague 2004 Denmark Schools team,  Tenerife 2005, Riccione 2005, Jesolo 2007, Beijing 2008, Brasov 2009 with Denmark Juniors team. That's ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: supposed to be a good partnership.|pg||
nt|haans: Q8 in clubs looks like three :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|roswolf: east's hand is good for cuebidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but a slow bid may produce an ethical problem for his pard - this is fine though|pg||
nt|haans: only thing wrong with that is no make :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably a misunderstand by E/W - West think to find only 3@h in East|pg||
nt|lestergold: theoretically 2 dims club and spade to lose|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: as is west's|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed the wrong game|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: 5@D made with a endplay|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: but the club force will make this hard to handle|pg||
nt|lestergold: note tjhat here the tens and nines are working!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: i fancy 6@D will be the final contract|pg||
nt|haans: many have no good bids after strong nt opening|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|bridge_one: would need the lead @C to beat|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: Looking at the map Vingsted appears to be located close to Århus... - kibs will surely correct me if this is incorrect|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Nicoleta Giura|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: Easy for us to see @CQ will drop - let's see if Mr. Hansen is in agreement|pg||

pc|c5|nt|lestergold: evening in Denmark?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: declarer should test the clubs by ruffing the third round and then play the spades/squeeze |pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: in Australia it is|pg||
nt|shevek: evening in sydney|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Nicoleta|pg||

nt|andyv:  ok|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes Bas 8pm Thurs here more rain forceast|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  hi Bas|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Bas, Gary and Sven-Olov|pg||
nt|andyv:  and welcome specs|pg||
nt|andyv:  first board very exciting|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and a board passed by :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think I've seen a pass out on first board yet|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: several @S's available EW|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  easy to compare with|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: altho 3N was an easier contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: In the NL it's not uncommon to play 1NT-2@C ; 2@H-2@S as invitational without 4@S and 2NT as invitational with 4@S, so that a @S contract can still be played from the NT opener's ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Good evening everybody:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Raija :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this board won't go to far in the bidding either|pg||
nt|jcwla: I agree with Joe about not opening 2@C; not so much because it's not a really nice playing hand, it just doesn't best describe the nature of the hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|mdgraham: not sure if that is the case here, obviously|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree, David...not a great slam but to not even sniff it out seems conservative|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think the slam is a decent proposition. they might well lead a suit that resolves the guess for you|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: playing precision all 1-level openings are limited up to 15 hcp|pg||
nt|lestergold: very costly duck|pg||
nt|santyclz: The duck was certainly reasonable.  If e had 5+@cs he might have shown a 2-suiter and if he doesn't, you don't want n to get an entry for a @s lead.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|andyv:  1@D xfer to @hs|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  EW play 5542, probably with unbalanced 1@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that's catching on here also|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  1@D shows hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with @CK on side it is quite makeable so could be a swing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: playable. In the UK lots of pairs play weak NT, so who becomes declarer is less of a consideration|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  N wants to bid 2@d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: different if it is a strong NT, of course|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Right|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Or have I missed something?)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: I guess I'll see next week, I'll be arriving in Brighton on Monday :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good evening and welcome to the fourth stanza of this final |pg||
nt|peachy: Hoi Bas :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: Brighton congress?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Ciao Mike|pg||
nt|peachy: Mike:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Bas, raija |pg||
nt|hedyg: Mike :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: no probs here as cards lie|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: yes, starting this weekend|pg||
nt|henryb:  What was 2@d?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|andyv:  N was able to show both minors.. S not interested|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: gl all taking part|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: with the 3-3 spade break declarer can afford the safety play of K@C   and club to the ace and be rewarded with an overtrick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not the optimum spot for anyone either|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: except ew|pg||
nt|andyv:  but it looks like it will play well|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzpa: with @h ace shown in N... then @c Q must be in S for the DBL ..or?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  with 4 trump, S might have tried a forcing game but doesn't know if @s or @d is best lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: If 2@d means the same as last round, it is any unbalanced normal opening without a 4-card major.|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm not sure this is the pair that was playing that, but think so.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, they were|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one thing I am quite proud of was winning the Brighton pairs in 1975, the last time it was a proper pairs event. Been a Swiss pairs ever since|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NZ Nationals 24 September - it's mine and the events 25th, not many have been to all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Where is Brighton I am asked. In southern England in the county of Sussex|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on the South Coast. Two piers, one functional and the other not....|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I don't mean to advertise, but I will anyway :) I'm still looking for a p for Brighton :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and a nice beach town in Canterbury New Zealand where I grew up|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, Englishmen were very good at picking names for newly founded settlement|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not that "New Amsterdam" was particularly hard, but hey|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: diasgree with messing about here should enter dummy and finesse spade immediately|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: yes, and some length expected too, so probably will startt the suit by leading the knave|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or New York|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwibridge: gl getting a pard Bas, our Brighton only had one pier|pg||
nt|hedyg: obviously EW playing a strong @c|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, thanks Gary|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: on another layout there may have been a trump promotion available on this line|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcwla: This might be a swing board one way or the other.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|peachy: On the surface, it looks like delarero nly loses 2 spades, 2 hearts and a club, but he will run short of tricks in the end|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: strong club relay system, oppo require LOTS of pass cards |pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: eg noe of south held j@s declarer would be mullered|pg||
nt|peachy: many strong club innovations have come from Swedish players, from early eighties on at least|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: as we can see|pg||
nt|peachy: not sure how many and which ones have become popular methods|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  hard for S to work out best sequence... seems like W can always come to 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: getting forced|pg||
nt|hedyg: for now he can disc a @h|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|lestergold: this is a lesson in how to go off in  laydown|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: I dont think it matters whether he discards on this or not, the troublesome clubs will continue|pg||
nt|hedyg: but might as well disc a loser|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice promotion for the @S6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: not clear what N thought the rush was to lead a club. where are declarer's club losers going?|pg||

nt|bridge_one: so may be a swing for E/W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if in open room the contract will be 4@S DBL|pg||

nt|jcwla: 2@D non-GF, on a hideous suit, combined with an indeterminate 2@S and a pass on a dime -- this seemingly cannot be where it's at.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well i think east'shand may qualify for an opener even by my standards|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now e/w need a certain convention called blackwood to avois another plausible slam|pg||
nt|haans: you very rarely can lead nearly|pg||
nt|shevek: guess it was ok both previous hands to open 10 hcp unbalanced|pg||
nt|shevek: as long as pd knows (part of the sys)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i thought tyne one spade opener was a little unbalanced in a different sense|pg||

nt|lestergold: looks like an easy 3N|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sharkey: previous hand I think the line Geoff pointed out previous hand is the most pragmatic - if not the best. Attempt ruff out @CQ - then try @S finesse |pg||
nt|haans: right play|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@C IS STANDOUT - how can west pass - momma mia|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|cK|pc|sT|nt|roswolf: yes as the auction went 3@C rather than double might have been better|pg||
nt|roswolf: embarrassing number of tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: East knew pd had max 1@H so probably shud just bid game and hope for a couple of @S in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Hansen tells x is good raise in S  0 somethg like 9+ ma 3-card support. X is that when he cant bid opps suit under level|pg||

nt|ady: would look silly if A@s was onside and 3NT makes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N could make if no smith echos in effect|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N is the most practical|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: choice of 7's|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|andyv:  N will at least invite|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roswolf: 4@S is an automatic "transfer"|pg||

nt|roswolf: good lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: E has to guess whether W has spade queen or heart ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: no chance i meant to type|pg||
mb|p|nt|tjolpe:  they'll end up in 3N|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's pretty conservative|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  I'd call it sound|pg||
nt|mdgraham: personally I wouldn't open at all with that West hand (it's all quacks), but I appreciate that many may disagree|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: imaginative mike:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: no lead woud let this thru of course|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only 29 high between them, just enough for game|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'll call it chicken:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: With Andy on this one|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Though I am unsure how to look for Slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe won't get to game but N has to at least invite|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would pass too|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps the five card "suit" encouraged him to open|pg||
nt|hedyg: notice pass by E with 12 hcps|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: won't be easy...North will win the spade and might play clubs|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in which case East might figure that West needs either @SQ or @hA to beat this|pg||
nt|andyv:  I have parteners who like to see if I can make one more too.|pg||
nt|andyv:  N has to guess now to play @cs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry for silly remark above. i was multi-tasking and has spade ten and jack interchanged|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and from East's point of view, he might not be able to afford to duck the club |pg||
nt|ady: how can west have Q@S   would have surely played it at trick 1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: lots of science here|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL ok|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sometimes bids don't register properly|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: ie when you enter them too fast|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: yes see last comment|pg||
nt|roswolf: i must say that bidding 4@S is unattractive but i agree it seems the normal bid|pg||
nt|peachy: :) NP|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kiwibridge: will it lead somewhere|pg||
nt|mdgraham: whether it will prove efficacious, we will have to wait and see|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@d invitational with five @h?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can NS get round to spades in time|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ady: yes   sorry|pg||
nt|ritong: hello everybody|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphznk: Invitational Smolen :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  and then he accepts his own invitation?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Wonder what 1NT-2@D ; 2@H-2@S is to them|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't know what the nt range is but the Kaplan and Rubens hand evaluator rates that one at 13.45|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: 2@c=GF, 2@h=shape and so on|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: W has shown 5241 with a minimum, I think|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|henryb:  He is very lucky on this hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  I believe he actually needs the specific holdings he finds: @hQJ doubleton and spades 4-3|pg||
nt|santyclz: So this may very well be a swing hand as well.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not think this reaches the odds we would ordinarily want even for a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am not really sure what he is thinking about|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hoping some of his spot cards will grow up?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: but West played @S10, so North is marked with @SQ....so West needs @HA |pg||
nt|lestergold: east is fixed cannot pass cannopt double is barraged into bidding 4|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, just bid 4N over 2@s|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Henri :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's what was written on the paper S gave me|pg||

pc|c7|nt|kiwibridge: 12 cards but has 13 :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Vugraphznk: Salut @H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7@D looks best in case N has Jxxx of spades|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 7N gets the top marks|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  options are limited|pg||
nt|peachy: If Dbl was Negative, N should know E does not have spades|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: and now East needs to work that out...no problem |pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  hi Henri:)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: downsides of not bidding are too great like 4@h making when 4@s is cold|pg||
nt|lestergold: etc etc|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like a certain -2|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: need to know the @C is Q|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: spec thinks N should bid only 2N. perhaps so, but 3N puts more pressure on opps and is less revealing|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|kiwibridge: still any grand is a good one usually|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is the first time diamonds have been bid naturally :) like it|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: any making grand, anyway|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|tjolpe:  he'll try the @C and take his nine if E doesn't cover|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  @CQ|pg||

pc|hA|pc|s3|nt|henryb:  well now. I guess he plans to play @sK, @c ruff, @sQ, @c ruff, @hK, @sA|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: as clubs lie can actually pick up all clubs but cant enjoy the 4th club |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: early claim coming :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: TD has been called|pg||
nt|hedyg: because?|pg||
nt|peachy: What happened, if you know"|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Wrang asked why no @S, Lagerman said something and then I think said that 1NT was not alerted|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Something with showing/denieing @S I suspect|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmmph|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Petersson claims he "alerted" as people with screens usually alert, just pointing at the cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 1NT shows a balanced hand I don't think it needs to be alerted |pg||
nt|peachy: pot calling kettle black eh... defenders discussing during play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it may need alerting if it shows or denies a specific number of spades|pg||
nt|peachy: I am not familiar what E has promised or denied so lets see|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Petersson claims he alerted it, Lagerman saying he didn't see it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if so, then that's tough|pg||
nt|hedyg: W could well have 3 cards in @s on the bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Alerting is the responsibility of the player who has to alert, also their responsibility to make sure the alert is seen by the opponents|pg||
nt|hedyg: so i am not sure what this is about except splitting hairs|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It seems nothing will come of it, TD advising to use an alert card from now on|pg||
nt|peachy: In the middle of the hand, no less|pg||
mc|11|nt|peachy: Weang started it|pg||
nt|peachy: Wrang|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There was a claim|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And then he poked his head and said "Why no @S?"|pg||
nt|peachy: ooh, I misunderstood. Aplogies|pg||
nt|peachy: I think Wrang might be sorry he did not bid 1S over the Dbl|pg||

nt|peachy: many would|pg||
nt|hedyg: they would not have played 3NT then|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: could be a swing here for the leaders   4@S should go down on a diamond lead|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 4S by N is fine:) needs low heart lead to beat it|pg||

nt|jcwla: No swing after all on 2, both hands played @D partials making 5.|pg||
nt|hedyg: if E showed 4 cards in @s with his X he was reluctant to reveal his holding|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT f1|pg||
nt|hedyg: or so it seems|pg||
nt|hedyg: as we can see S doesnt like to bid his @ss|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice description Bas - "alerted a little bit" :) |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It does, but it wasn't alerted at either side of the screen|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Well, you know how players can vaguely wave their hand over a bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Possibly throw in a shrug|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|nt|roswolf: north passed - not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: best opening bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: E carried away a bit here|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure what by, void in pd's suit? the 4 small @ds?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with one of my partners I play that 2NT by East here=excellent club raise. Works well, as you don't have to get above 3@C |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this should do it also|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ah, no, D lead still beats it|pg||
nt|andyv:  S did manage to make 4 in CR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no direction home|pg||

mb|5C|nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  If you hover your mouse over the other room score, a pop-up shows what the bidding was there.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and then to back in on the second round mama mia!|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I play that 2S by E shows the good raise|pg||
nt|peachy: since he already denied spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think he has an excellent raise at all|pg||
nt|peachy: the "impossible spade"|pg||
nt|hedyg: i play 2@s shows an excellent raise, here i would just bid 3@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, he has six :)|pg||
nt|peachy: not excellent, but I would still classify it as good raise|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that is all he has|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: North's protection vulnerable extremey brave altho on auction pard was marked with a fair amount of strength|pg||
nt|roswolf: now if north had opened..............|pg||
nt|roswolf: brave bordering on lunacy|pg||
nt|lestergold: although 4@s is a not unreasonable contract it looks unmanageable here as cards lie|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: now 2 down|pg||
nt|hedyg: no redeeming features except the 6th @c|pg||

nt|h_karluk: one|pg||

nt|andyv:  3N the best game here|pg||
nt|garnetts: they should just about bid this to 5@C --the spade response will encourage east|pg||
nt|jcwla: 10 big ones to Skalman on 3 when Nilsson and Fredin did not match the bid of 4@H.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Petersson had actually revoked during the play, he had the @H6 left, but declarer claimed and he was never exposed...|pg||
nt|hedyg: the official site is: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.1945|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  declarer will need to play at least one round of @ss before tackling @ds|pg||

nt|lestergold: 20/20 hcp division scope for someone going overboard|pg||

nt|mdgraham: West would have had to open 2@C if he had wanted to open the last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well very tame outcome|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks dodgy|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: 1NT=clubs?|pg||

nt|garnetts: What do youn bid if you want to bid 1NT?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@C?|pg||
nt|garnetts: if you see what I mean|pg||
nt|mdgraham: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: exactly|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: ace no cost to ruff finesse the @sQ|pg||
mb|r!|an|3!H|nt|andyv:  interesting evaluation.... N wouldn't even sniff out a slam on 3 but believes this hand is worth investigating.|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  N tried a natural 4NT, since he could bid 3N with 11-13|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 1@d bid shows 0+@ds but a 4 card major.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT looks right by N|pg||
nt|peachy: results should be here http://www.swangames.com/magic/magic/www.php?nsid=259&nr=1&ns=4, think link popped up when I went to the Results tab on the  Chairman's club website|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: West led @hK - may have switched to @D, but East overtook @HA and led a club|pg||
nt|andyv:  do you think S took 4N as natural?|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  yes|pg||
nt|garnetts: just been told you bid 1NT and don't alert :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much use with screens though|pg||
nt|garnetts: you can also make 4@S because they are 3/3 and you control @Ds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 1NT showed clubs, presumably 2@C was NF?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (just guessing)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: better be relay|pg||
nt|garnetts: well 2@C is an underbid then isn't it|pg||
nt|peachy: *Cup|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: In my view, 1N is a doubtful rebid holding that honor dispersion|pg||
nt|andyv:  this lead won't scare declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps not on the lead|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  he should anyway:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: possible - but then, how do you play in 2@C....|pg||
nt|garnetts: suppose the same way you play in 1NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, the engine is revving up |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: must have had a shot of reddex which dates me |pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: A round-about route to the normal contract.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: we are just guessing as to the EW systemic nuances. Fun to do so though|pg||
nt|jcwla: Is the E hand considered a good hand in this system or...?|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange lead when you know your pd is short in @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: S said he has the black suits|pg||
nt|peachy: this is hand where nobody can make a contract.  Can anybody say if any contract makes, either side?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  I'm not sure what S took it... do we know what type of keycard they are playing?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: suggest 2@C was GF relay|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: now makes 3|pg||
nt|santyclz: With the @cs breaking w starts with 9 top tricks and many ways for an 10th.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|garnetts: well I am willing to bet a natural method would have got us here five minutes ago|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1 overtrick IMP in the @H partial to Gary's Boys on 4.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kiwibridge: agree, thats the down side of relay methods, you have to go thru the motions|pg||
nt|garnetts: not sure how to play this to be honest--neither will dec be--so this could take a while|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1N both ways for 5 imps to Garys Boys|pg||
nt|garnetts: spade discard and a club has its attractions |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: on 18, now they are on the grand|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|andyv:  it looked to me like S took it as straight old fashioned blackwood and showed his one ace.|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think N can make 1NT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Vugraphznk: It doesn't say much but neither bid was alerted|pg||
nt|andyv:  if ace asking it would not be alertable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: by sheer luck reaches a making contract when most would play 3N|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: With screens it is, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  both make so no loss|pg||
nt|andyv:  and actually 5@d may be a little easier|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  he can still go down in this one|pg||
nt|andyv:  thinking of finessing for J@s, Sven?|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  NS is not a regular partnership, NE is and SW was as juniors|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, S should have asked E what N's bid meant.|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Teehee|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  I think he is pretty sure about the distribution|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kiwibridge: 3N I think much easier|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||

pc|cA|nt|jcwla: 5@SX in OR.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|garnetts: potential to get too high?  But with @D breaking spades 2-2 ace of clubs onside it will make 7|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: spade switch needed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless there is a D switch|pg||
nt|andyv:  lack of entries should prevent declarer from playing @hs wrong|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  he'll not be impressed of his dummy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Vugraphznk: After EW's previous relay auction, S requested an additional bidding box|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I see a lively board....|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1050 to EW in OR.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: yes    that is true    diamond lead has turned out better|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@H for me since i dont have 4 spades as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: you all bid 4@s over 2@s?|pg||
mc|9|nt|andyv:  then again...|pg||
nt|andyv:  did W really do anything wrong?|pg||
nt|andyv:  he xfered to 1N and then dbl to show that he thought the hand belonged to EW|pg||
nt|andyv:  but Gary's comment hit the nail on the head... that is some ugly opener by E|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  it eas E who got cold feet|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E 100% blame, a for opening and b not passing the X|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would get cold feet too if my pd dbl opps into game and I held the E hand:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and c making pard declarer :)|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  well, parntern could well be 3154 or so|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what a lousy spade break - 4@H might make, but North's jump to 4@S is practical bridge|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
pg||

nt|roswolf: this could be feisty|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here 4@H are èpossible guessing the @C|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: Konow go toilet|pg||
nt|haans: by experts 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: not very awake experts|pg||
nt|jcwla: First result in, no swing on 21 at 3NT/E making six.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: was a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: so 4@s dbl less one is the best contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is routine safety|pg||
nt|haans: bored experts|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@SX is cheap|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S easier to find than 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: only 3@D "what am i doing here"|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: nothing going to keep east quiet here|pg||
nt|lestergold: and what a dummy to buy by east that is if he is allowed to play 5@h|pg||
nt|shevek: good bid 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: first result = no slam in either rooms|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2nd seat also not 15-17|pg||
nt|h_karluk: at nonvul|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sharkey: 4@H likely|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|sharkey: East shudnt invite even|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would have raised spades if north's bid showed 5+|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@s only two off|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, but hard to know...|pg||
nt|haans: let opps have the 5 level|pg||
nt|lestergold: north too weak to bid again vul of course|pg||
nt|shevek: level 5 belongs to opps|pg||
nt|shevek: you type faster Haans :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|shevek: the @c pips are good|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: east may push his side into minus territory|pg||
nt|haans: 4@D as bad as 4@S -1|pg||
nt|roswolf: north hasnt any extras to bid game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: north can try 4@S hoping to find xxx or Hx in South|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|roswolf: west may axe anything bid now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: assume they have screen betweeen West and North?|pg||
nt|haans: Juniors are far from 40 imp pickup|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: View 500 game bonus VUL I think East shud go for game when 4-4 fit found|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Yes scrren here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: I cant see north biddin when screen closed|pg||

nt|vugraphzpa: Konow has just left the room ... we have a short break |pg||
nt|ady: sorry   misread the play     heart was played to the 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: Konow is back ... |pg||
nt|lestergold: south would raise to game of course|pg||
nt|andyv:  defense was difficult but NS could not afford to break the @s suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: flushed with success can they reach the failing @H game|pg||
nt|garnetts: an odd decision|pg||
nt|garnetts: why bid a suit when you have a nine card fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's an old story - to make game in a suit you have to bid that suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the 4 card @S resp was raised with 3 odd|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for a nice-looking 850. Unlucky, lose five :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I would too|pg||
nt|peachy: I would|pg||
nt|hedyg: you are a junior Bas :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why should I tell EW not to lead a heart?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: One of our trainers always says "The best auction is 1-2-4"|pg||
nt|peachy: I am most definitely a senior :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: me too :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpa: 1 nt = 12-15 in this position|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats a 7 card fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. not as good as a 5/4 fit, but better than a 4/2 |pg||
nt|mdgraham: this opening used to be popular in the UK some years back, but you don't see it much now |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Half-time, and in the other match one table is already finished|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w on 18 missed the non-vul game in the other room for a loss of 6 imps|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: it is so easy then u see alle cards - not so easy for N over 3@D|pg||
nt|garnetts: odd that west did not make any sort of try--very chunky nine count|pg||
nt|mdgraham: do you or don't you with the North hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: not for me |pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ady: found the best lead|pg||
nt|ady: top club would not have been good|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently EW play 2 different NT ranges according to colors?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty normal lead i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/wwill get too high ie get above 1@s |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 2@D 3-card Drury?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nor me, pushing it a bit too hard with an ace and a jack only  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there are people who do though|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even if you have clubs to run, they won;t beat 1NT|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: agreed north would have had a problem which he may have got wrong|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  absolutely unless the play som sort of Drury|pg||
nt|garnetts: they are usually 17|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  EW have lots of Jacks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 2 tricls to lose min  each of 2 suits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is down double-dummy|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: only @cs are off side|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer does not have entries to finesse both of the majors (and maybe clubs)|pg||
nt|peachy: so he might end up 1 down|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: 3 suits|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kiwibridge: a far better opener than last time|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why he went to the 3 level... well, actually, his pd did...|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  he have to bid 3@H, despite the fact that E denied a good hand|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  but6 why should it fail?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@C 1S + @D|pg||
nt|garnetts: often advsied to do so by people of our age :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: closed room lead 2@C|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzpa: no 1nt is 14-16 in third and fourth seat .. else 12-15 in first and second seat|pg||
nt|peachy: without help, he will, but an unrevealing auction. We'll see|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is down already|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: and is being defended in exatcly that fashion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, was|pg||
pc|c8|nt|tjolpe:  sorry for my bad finger on the left hand, it's got a life of it's own:(|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  he took the diamond finesse the wrong way|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  or the wrong finesse|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  probably a push, though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Bas, Mike, David and all specs, the hour is late and work tomorrow so I'll say farewell and thanks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: good view by declarer in trumps|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s making 2@c so no disaster|pg||
nt|mdgraham: shame on you, David :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks Gary, bye|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Alright, thanks Gary! See you|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North might have played a heart back there, with two small in dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now can East pin the @D10...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @d9|pg||
nt|hedyg: did not use the A@D for playing a major , lost 1 entry|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: ok thx|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|ady: looks like 7 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: juniors pull back 2 imps|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  might go two down now|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  if he tries a diamond|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1 imp lost on 5@D|pg||
nt|peachy: but the club ace was off|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ady: trying for the 8th|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: cash @C's now|pg||

pc|d7|pc|s2|pg||

nt|lestergold: 6@d infrangible but 6@s can be beat as we can see|pg||
nt|lestergold: by two tricks double dummy|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: n/s might get to 4@H HERE|pg||

nt|shevek: 6@h by south|pg||
nt|shevek: now|pg||

nt|lestergold: south can work out that no hearts likely to stand up in defence|pg||
nt|shevek: my pd bids 4@h when I could have void....|pg||
nt|haans: cannot ruff @D first wrong declarer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h would be unlucky choice|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: 4@H not a make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with not passed hand by the p i think 3@d a little gambling|pg||
mb|r!|nt|roswolf: do n/s play drury?|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe not but a likely contract|pg||
nt|haans: few drury after overcall|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope junior sees a 7 card suit and bids|pg||
nt|haans: right second site as per book|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|shevek: maybe 5@h was a good idea|pg||
nt|lestergold: well feeble 5@h bid succeeded in doing enuf dirty work |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well i would make a try as south|pg||
nt|lestergold: very hard tho to find this excellent slam with so much bidding spade taken up|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why not 2@h on S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Again Vulerability comes into play - NS may not chase this game being Non Vul|pg||

mb|p|pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: u mean 2@c then 2@h|pg||

nt|ady: 4@H  better than 3NT    a chance for some imps for the juniors here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: opportunistic double of 3NT in the CR - certainly paid dividends|pg||

nt|roswolf: a 1 or4 hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: mine is not so hot either--I speak better Hokkien|pg||

nt|mdgraham: but somehow switching is never that easy|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|tjolpe:  any way, they got some boars played|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: aggressive 3@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  N may be able to xruff this hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfers over 1@C are getting popular in the UK - in this auction the double of 1@D would say "I was going to bid 1@D", on other words I have hearts|pg||
nt|jcwla: W's @D raise denying A or K?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|garnetts: well bid  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS can take quite a decent penalty from 1@Sx (if it is passed out), but North can't tell that.|pg||
nt|garnetts: a low spade allows North to make lots |pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|ady: swing to the juniors    depends how great|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|andyv:  he'll need to get 1@d trick|pg||
nt|santyclz: My lead, the @hq, doesn't help much either.|pg||
nt|garnetts: double club finesse |pg||
pc|s3|pc|c5|nt|andyv:  now a @h back will make things difficult|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: north happy that spades arent bre4aking!|pg||

nt|andyv:  N had 10 tricks.... now I don't think so|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the cards are fairly well marked by thge auction|pg||

pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: agree, club would be normal|pg||

nt|ralfwil: I don´t like 2@s on W with a 6-card @h and a stiff @cA. 2@h for me with @sQxx|pg||

nt|lestergold: 2@c infrangible and game too much on the N/S cards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or at the table singleton, i think that means a trick for the declarer|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ralfwil: And see what happens after a @d lead and a @c shift|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: E with his best hand so far, unable to bid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  probably better off not being able to bid:)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: 4@S - mama mia -very courageous at red|pg||
nt|lestergold: however at these colours 500 even better than 450!|pg||

pc|cA|nt|tjolpe:  and the A and 6?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no problemo|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not a great fit, therefore not a great contract.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately the 10@c will pop up|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzpa: 3@d=6-3-3-1 distribution|pg||
nt|pelu: and if u can push them to 5@H - then a @CX-lead will defeat|pg||
nt|lestergold: if you find it of course|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: with a diamond loser   slam no certainty    needed the heart queen down|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tjolpe:  no, but may be J875|pg||
nt|andyv:  played the 9?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Gustawsson wearing a "Bafana Bafana" cap and a Durban T-shirt, nice gadgets to have :)|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  he was there to wath|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Nice|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  why did South play the @C9?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I thought he did...|pg||

nt|marlowepi: recycle them, it is very green|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s is not helpful... now E has to look for Q@s|pg||

nt|hedyg: he didnt ruff his good K@c did he?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  if you close your eyes, these slams are much easier to bid.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, they've missed it. This is getting interesting|pg||
nt|andyv:  again we see east getting a lot of info but not the info he needs to bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: why play an artificial system when it cant be used here :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: as some specs have said, @cA plus @HQ @SQ impossible (West is 5-7 hcp)  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: to bid a slam missing one ace and @h Q|pg||
nt|lestergold: however north 'wisely' told pard lets defend|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: overs now|pg||
nt|garnetts: no option now|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphznk: The TD was called in the OR on board 20 for a pause before 3@S, after which Fredin Doubled 4@S|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|garnetts: poor play by east|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c8|nt|hedyg: just another case of entering the bids faster than the program can digest|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: difficult for East - had to rise @HK and play @DA and another, not easy as North bid 3@D|pg||
pc|hT|nt|santyclz: E played a little to quickly there.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  good point Jan.  Problem was he was missing 2 Qs|pg||

nt|roswolf: imps being tossed around like confetti|pg||
nt|roswolf: well defended|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s have balance of pints but e/w have the game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: when i first started to VG <maybe 4 years ago>i got a good lesson from Roland, unless you are sure off two never double|pg||
nt|jcwla: An overtrick IMP to Bridgeministeriet in the 3NT on 25.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Jepsen left for toilet|pg||
nt|haans: ok for 3 in  suit but mb not 3nt directing lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@s on EW|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, that's better advice for doubling into game at IMPs.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Which I'm guessing is how it was intended.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: this again will be competitive|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Hansen had no count of clubs|pg||
mb|2C|nt|h_karluk: would it be a good slam now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|haans: NS may not find their suit|pg||
nt|haans: east poins are aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: is that really a vul 1@H overcall!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: unbiddable i suppose|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharkey: Cud be a 11 IMPs back to Næsten Junior|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think it is how high e/w will compete to if at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: two way c hook and a missing hearts Q which offside|pg||
nt|haans: not easy to find|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and normally you shouldn´t go wrong in 6@s, @hA and @hK and if @hQ still is out, finess in @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with an auto @d loser|pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: 2@S from E|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west will double?|pg||

mb|4H|nt|roswolf: this looks like 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some may PASS Geoff:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: What's 2@H?|pg||
nt|haans: maybe 2@H was reverse (strong)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: declarer looks in control here|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S did show 17+|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 14 points incl stiff @CQ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: finesse for @c Q but to which direction sir|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: SOUTH HAD BETTER SIGN OFF QUICKLY|pg||
nt|sharkey: After last hand they may be on a mission....|pg||
nt|haans: tomorrow 12.00 and 15.15 Paris time|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: the stratosphere is in danger|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: for the final|pg||

nt|roswolf: north appears still to be|pg||
nt|roswolf: interested i mean|pg||
nt|haans: still why 2@H?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it was alerted maybe peter can tell us?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: at last -|pg||

nt|shevek: not much choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 2@d some sort of Max with Majors maybe?|pg||
nt|lestergold: north playing 3@c i assume|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: that seems NF|pg||
nt|haans: or wjs|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Sorensen may not find @C switch|pg||

pc|c7|nt|haans: if so 3@H forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2NT=18-19  3H=Forcing|pg||
nt|jcwla: Nah, probably use a getout.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|shevek: not a boring match by all means, lots of imps going both sides|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|haans: have @SK|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: 3H forcing or inv/better interesting, say u have Qtx, Ktxxxx, xx, xx would not bid 3@h again?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: different bidding style. For me 3@h is a 6-card suit and 3@c is asking for a 3-card support|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: but maybe they ll bid 2@h straightforward who knows|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcwla: Can Wolff to get out at 3 level - 3@D artif GF checkback.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes Jordan, that's the way to see difference|pg||
nt|haans: wjs do not need Wolff|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 to Juniors on 26 - they played 2@D making while their counterparts stretched to 3NT failing by 1.|pg||
nt|haans: but i have never seen players stop a part-score if 18-18 against wjs|pg||
nt|haans: 19|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for now bragging rights to Emil Jepsen :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Michael would not have any difficulty to make this|pg||

nt|h_karluk: @h K at hand would be nice |pg||
nt|haans: certain he know that now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just some safety play in case 5 |pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: interesing that on hand where dim slam was missed no 8, and they played in 5@s was good result ,because in open n/s were allowed to play in 5@h doubled for only 300!|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: He gets back and sees 6@C lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: and again he's playing it :)|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  will he not play N for the @DA?|pg||
nt|garnetts: that will collect the Q@D lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Used to be people said -1 for 4333 distribution, now they seem to say +1 for support of all suits...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: must be getting old - I'd pass the West hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am dumbstruck|pg||
nt|peachy: I suppose 2S is a "hidden" cue of North's suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Petersson has written down 11 tricks in 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And I'm positive the play was correct|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
pc|d9|nt|andyv:  if he plays it straight up, he will make it but has to guess @ds|pg||
nt|andyv:  actually, may not need to guess @ds... he can get two @h pitches|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, 3@S described as maximum|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: SOUTH'S DOUBLE IS LIKELY TO HELP E/W|pg||

nt|marlowepi: he has no options|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|ady: yes   this can be made|pg||

pc|s4|nt|lestergold: well bid at any rate|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Haha, Ahlesved closed the screen to ask Nilsson a question and since Petersson is away, Fredin took the two Aces and put them away|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 11 HCP nv and a good 6 card suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'd almost have to open this, systematically|pg||
nt|hedyg: i only saw 10hcps, is 1 hcp hidden?|pg||
nt|peachy: the 11th HCP is in the 2 of diamonds:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: and in that 10 hcps is Jx in @H, not very attractive|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL Raija|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=Kx+Jx+KQJxxx+xxx|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 10.9 HCP :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: not hcps Bas :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I was thinking the @D7, it's good money|pg||
nt|mdgraham: match level|pg||
nt|hedyg: hcp= high card points|pg||
nt|peachy: I completely agree that the good diamond suit compensates|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I guess I'd open it as a weak 2@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Rule of 2/3 at the 2-level :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|kiwibridge: bummer|pg||

nt|garnetts: damage limitation now|pg||
nt|garnetts: well at least east did not bid 3NT|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|hJ|nt|jcwla: Let's see: suit length, wrong.  Suit quality, wrong.  Suit texture, wrong.  Below-opening playing strength, wrong.  Suit as percentage of hand's value?  Wrong.  2@S, if meant as a ...|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2NT=@cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: uh oh|pg||
nt|andyv:  I prefer to open those 1@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  promises 3-1 in the majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: taken as both majors, by the look of it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H all right if it is your best suit, but not when it is your worst|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: after sending the sledge to the other side of the screen Østergaard says .. sr 2@c is natural .. but too late :(|pg||

nt|mdgraham: natural and forcing?|pg||
nt|hedyg: cuebid, maybe asking for stopper?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And I also wonder how E could Splinter in @H in this auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: passed partnre, vul vs. not - risky|pg||
nt|santyclz: Normal lead against 2-suited bidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Marshall, you have the Q... how much more do you need?|pg||
nt|andyv:  the pedestrian 3N gained 10 imps for Gary's Boys on 11|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I prefer X, with the Ms reversed I would prefer 1@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Ouch|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh well academic as e/w overboard|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Someone told me he never applies the Rule of 20 to distributional hands, like these|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'd still open 1@H though|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: E took it as a Splinter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South: "content"|pg||
nt|hedyg: your fault Bas for mentioning splinters!|pg||
nt|peachy: I must say I am not impressed with Relay Precision success|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2NT showed clubs, then surely 3@H would be natural|pg||
nt|hedyg: well maybe it is like playing Ghestem...you need to learn it before you play it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: The @H's sort of look like four.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: prefer 1@H, bid 5-card major|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes Mike, but not 5 cards?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Ahlesved shaking his head in disbelief|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Can always bid 4@H over 3NT|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might be able to get spades into the game later, via a double perhaps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it's a matter of style|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: I have a suggestion that 3@H might just show values, not necessarily a suit. Obviously East intended to show 6/5, but it has been interpreted incorrectly |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: escaped the double   but still a loss for the juniors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I must point out, I'm not the Gary|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|hedyg: quite so|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and you can always follow up with 4@H just to emphasise the picture|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  W probably not sure that 5@c may not make|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pelu: the bidding by west is not consistent - first he pass and the he penalyse pd for opening in 3. seat|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Oh well, he has to play it himself :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: seems to me that every hand is a new adventure with the relay precision system|pg||

pc|h9|nt|garnetts: you see Mike the years of abuse have taken their toll on both of us|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|santyclz: The "normal" lead, however, seems to be far more effective the more unbalanced leader's hand is.|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Well, Petersson seemed to be shrugging as if "we didn't agree, I tried"|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Not sure who introduced this during VGs|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: natural bidding :) 1@D=singleton diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  defense should be clear in 4@s.... S plays A or K@c, N plays Q and S plays 2@c for @d ruff|pg||

nt|pelu: D = 3 card @H - 3@C ok, but why 41D by N and not 3@s??|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair question - but if north doesnt have a spade control his opening bid would be very thin|pg||
nt|pelu: give him @cK and not @sk|pg||
nt|pelu: even with @sQ (not K) N has a 1@D opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think W is more likely to have @CK than N, but as you say, 3@S would've prevented this issue|pg||
nt|roswolf: i suppose he could have QJx of spades and a void club but then he would habe cued 4@C perhaps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The question is, could he have a 4@D bid without @SK|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is what south has to decide|pg||
nt|roswolf: he is a world class player|pg||
nt|pelu: can he have @SK and bid 4@D :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: depends on how practised this partnership is|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol yes Peter|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's a valid argument as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is where i wish we had a running commentary on south's thoughts|pg||
nt|andyv:  this doesn't come close|pg||
pc|c3|nt|garnetts: since the spade suit is out of the equation --you could use 3S to show four hearts and 3@C  as weak|pg||
nt|peachy: I like it, but there are more than one ways to skin a cat |pg||

nt|lestergold: but arrived at best spot well done|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|andyv:  S will need a scissor's coup to hold it to down 1 on @d switch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't know what all this means (sorry) but I'm sure EW do|pg||
nt|hedyg: my pd at the club last night also plays 1NT-2NT natural, many prefer that|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  E did it for him... not sure why E didn't return the @d...he knows W has 3@hs|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: I have received a bet that E has shown 4216 and 8 zz-points|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't understand the jack unless they play Peter Lund's method where it promises one higher. Then we are in the same situation. I don't think they do, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: they do not !|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently not if S shifted|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: and they used the short break between the two sections to discus it |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s4|nt|andyv:  and S read the J@c as asking for a @h shift|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzpa: must be tired .. I assume|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how could it mean that when N never showed clubs?|pg||

nt|andyv:  not sure...never had that experience.  How about you, Marshall?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, they tried to become juniors but did not succeed|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  the diamond is not necessaary for beating the contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, but would set it 2 if S was not careful|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: West is complaining East didn't switch to his diamond|pg||
nt|garnetts: well done|pg||
nt|smoller: board 30 is dynamite, could be good for Saklman|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Steen|pg||

nt|Walddk4: But 13 behind|pg||
nt|smoller: Hi Bas|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: closest i ever got was poignant|pg||
nt|ady: danger of getting overboard |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Almost is a fine description|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: but they are trying to bid like juniors ... sometimes|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffe hand 3N|pg||
nt|garnetts: strong two lol|pg||
mb|1H|mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: need methods here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: I predicted that the same could easily happen here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: too much weight in the spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: Østergaard has not alerted 3@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: i need to go - family commitments looming so bid nu farewell and leave you in excellent hands of peter and geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 24 where here n/s played in 1@S in the other room 4@S WAS bid and doubled and Made!!!!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the boards have been quite flat this set|pg||
nt|santyclz: Roth-Stone weak 2?|pg||
nt|peachy: well, same auction so far|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: E breaks the rules again|pg||
nt|andyv:  multi strikes again|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Some play 3@S as 1354 or 1345. This hand is perfect for it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a common treatment is a 3S response, both minors with 3 cards in other major. very useful when you often open 1NT with a 5 card major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When you get a 3NT rebid, you can forget about it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry roland was typing while you were expoiunding|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least no excitement for declarer on this one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or 3@H=4@D5@c and 3@S=5@D4@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  I prefer to show the frag rather than the splinter.. much more difficult for opps to dbl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they are going to lead yr short suit whatever you do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and bidding the stiff lets partner declare|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but more of a guess when pd can't dbl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why bother doubling 3@S?|pg||
nt|smoller: fearing to be outbid? holding only 7 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Or you could play 2@S as MSS|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Minor Suit Stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: Houston ... We have a problem .......|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N must have shown shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  that seems to be going by the wayside with 4 suit transfers lately|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh dear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unsound bidding by North I think it's fair to say|pg||
nt|andyv:  ah, my type of bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think N realizes that they are way behind... only reason for that bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: Østergaard did not alert 3@c ... and I guess he might have taken it for a @c suit inviting to 3nt .... I am sure Mads meant it to be something else|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: But as you might know .... NS is not a regular partnership !|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the last few boards have all gone wrong :(|pg||
nt|ady: Q@D  instead of Q@S   then good contract      even J@D  would give play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all the more reason to keep methods simple|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6N would be cold if E had the diamond length|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: I guess Østergaard might move it to 6nt ...... but he takes his time before deciding what to do.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is cold if W won't ruff any of N's clubs |pg||
nt|pelu: East played @HA - and alle over - now a @H-ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: there may have been an endplay or if nnot certainly am op[portunity for misdefence|pg||
nt|lestergold: round of spades cash some dims play low heart i think declarer's rho may have been in trouble|pg||
nt|pelu: u can make 4@s on all leads - but have to play @H before 2x@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: but would need somethingh lime double dummy declarer play!|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i suspected that|pg||
nt|garnetts: not keen on 3@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: The score is not right.  The OR N/S matched the 4@S making from in here, it's a push not 9 to Gary's Boys.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Score still stands at 62-59 for Skalman.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The oppo can now bid, pass, or redouble, and a good pair will have agreemenst about these actions - you just give them more room to converse|pg||
nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
nt|pelu: Board 29 - Ias I see the play: only down 1 - not 8 but 6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  10@h now|pg||
nt|garnetts: if all partner can do is bid 2@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: not fearing imo, just bidding opposite a passed pd|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Peter|pg||
nt|smoller: careful defence lets N/S make two club tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: what's the hurry to get to 4@S?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzpa: 4 boards left after this one|pg||
nt|lestergold: any case regretfully must say bye for now |pg||
nt|roswolf: bye|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that gives a few overtricks!|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm told "normal opening strength denying a 4-card major."|pg||
nt|jcwla: Corrected now.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|pelu: what a lead?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: if North was going to look for slam, maybe 4@D might have been better|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will be back with the Open Pairs on Saturday and Sunday|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 5@D not a bad save here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might open 3NT to show my liberal bent|pg||
nt|jcwla: Right, not to mention what is the point?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To shut out Nord must be the reasoning, but it's not easy when you have the boss suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North even|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s3|nt|jcwla: Good enough to double, good enough to lead!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and if South has tipped off the spade length, East might get the trumps right - but he needs to guess clubs as well  |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: imaginative but unsound|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Too much Scandinavian today|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not now though|pg||
nt|smoller: I agree Mike. With a strong hand and the highest suit one should maybe investigate a little more|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, so you bid 1@S and Norht bids 4@h. You can still bid 4@S|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|d2|nt|peachy: He perhaps was anticipating 1H (1S) 4H so he would have to decide then anyway.  I appreciate the concept of putting opps to the guess|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: HUGE swing|pg||
nt|hedyg: mainly to the guess whether to double or not|pg||
nt|peachy: it just didnt work here|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: admittedly, you don't need much for 4@S, but when, as here, it goes badly wrong, partners tend to be a little unsympathetic|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|smoller: Could of course be right to bid 4@S, but looks a bit sillym when you can make only one|pg||
nt|pelu: now only -300|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcwla: E might have done everything anyway but this looks like 14 clearly on the head of Wrang.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The trouble is that you don't know when you bid 4 :)|pg||
nt|pelu: strange that S didnt drop a @h|pg||
nt|pelu: @H9 for @c and @h10 for @d|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, there are arguments against and in favor of boths view|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|roswolf: this could be embarrassing|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Wait, I meant not a bad contract -_-|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pelu: look at N's hand - EW has maded a slamtry - u cant exp values by pd - so @SQ look very "creativ"|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: suggestion of double followed by 2@S or 3@S - quite like that|pg||
nt|hedyg: back to 500|pg||
nt|hedyg: is he really thinking?|pg||
nt|smoller: Would have worked on this hand, Mike - but certainly not a silly way to bid, when your suit is SPADES|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: it is a pity that E was not, say, 4333 on the previous deal, then it would appear in newspaper columns|pg||

nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: no I exp that 1NT = 1@D bid - they have used transfers on 1@c-opening, 1@D =@h and 1@H=@S, but normal 1@S would be a @d-bid|pg||
nt|pelu: spects - help me :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am hungry indeed|pg||
nt|garnetts: better one here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: We are beginning to get the hang of the EW system - 1@D means I have an opening bid, and after that you bid one below the suits you have got |pg||
nt|mdgraham: like 2@h here :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: TD just asked for the meaning of a possible 1@S bid by S on board 19. S said it would be support in @H|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: 11 imps from nowhere|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  If you hover your mouse over the other room score, a pop-up shows what the bidding was there.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  it will be hard to duplicate the score in the CR|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: Næsten Junior had a chance after boards 28 and 29, but since then it has been downhill, and the favourites have it|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_Walsh Wiki where would we be without you :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 1NT showing 6-9 without 4cM|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And 1@S showing 4/5@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That is, if that is their style|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: TD is Bas's father, Marc|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Bas, now we know why he didnt bid 1@s!|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: Ministry of Bridge. Right, why don't we have that|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West showed his 16 count as 18-19|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: We have a Ministry of Defence. We need a Ministry of Bidding and a Ministry of Declarer Play|pg||
nt|pelu: but he bid 1NT on 15 HCP?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||

nt|jcwla: 11 back Bridgeministeriet on 30 - they bid and made 6@S.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If @h10 is a true card - Play @hK next time|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: at that point he had 7 tricks and shouldnt make more than the two high trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|shevek: he did , he did :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: do not understand 2@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: everyone bidding here on tram tickets|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but the Q could cause the declarer subterfuge in case he is convinced to hook the nine|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nice deceptive line at defense|pg||
nt|pelu: what now 2@d or 3/4 @h?|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D or 4@H?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for interm/adv, i cannot imagine works for experts|pg||

nt|lestergold: declarer surely should have played for one heart trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: ruff was unlikely|pg||
nt|shevek: just because north doubled... (light)|pg||
nt|shevek: doesn't mean @hA is there|pg||
nt|lestergold: but play low guarantees a heart trick and playing high only gets one heart trick when ace is right in any case|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: yes thx Bas, and Andy great to be with you, thx specs nice comments|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: when is round 2?|pg||
nt|garnetts: it is an old sore that you must have an ace to open with 1NT--I do not agree with it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Almost the end now, so time for a few words of thanks: to our excellent operator Bas van Beijsterveldt, and to the Swedish Bridge Federation. Also to Carl Tagnarsson and Tomas ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Brenning for helping BBO to put on this broadcast.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tightens the match up nicely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks also to Gary Hanna (New Zealand), Joe Shair (USA), and David Carlisle (England) for commentary. I am Mike Graham (England). Also thanks to all spectators for some useful and ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perceptive comments. |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Ultimate board of the session now|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board now of this match|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not for the outcome no, but it does for the IMPage|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, lost connection|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: In about 25 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I may stay on a while :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you would think that East might have had some way to find out the ace position|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: lead directing|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thank you Mike, will you be here later on?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Carl Ragnarsson. R and T are too close together on the keyboard :( |pg||
mb|1C!|an|Strong|mb|1S|nt|pelu: ok - the TD can go back to coffe-table - the ruling will not chance the winner|pg||
mb|p!|nt|Walddk4: Here is the ruling|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The TD has weighted the score|pg||
nt|peachy: I have to run, thanks everyvody. Kibitzers, I hope you enjoyed!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: wb Mike|pg||
nt|smoller: Nothing important as been said while you were away, Mike - dont worry|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Raija :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Skalman will lose 5.5 IMPs|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Raija :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks Raija|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: 4H should come in|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Not sure, Norway at 4:00|pg||
nt|santyclz: But I had 14 points!  Didn't I have to bid?|pg||
nt|garnetts: you did Joe==anyone for double?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'll have a pint of whatever North seems to have got hold of please |pg||
nt|santyclz: That should be enough for east.|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes it beats viagra|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  @h spots sit well for N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good hand for Gazilli-ish methods|pg||
nt|pelu: 10 IMPs for Glopson on 27 - a lazy 3Nt by Fredin - 1@C - 1@S - 2@C - 3NT - and 5 @H-tricks for opp|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nice :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you don't like doubling as South (not four hearts) but it's something you have to do|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|andyv:  smoothly moving from 5-3 fit to 4-3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and here the 4-3 is favoured over the 5-3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: spades 2-2, hearts 3-3, diamond honours split - should be no problem|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Gary will gain 5.5 IMPs|pg||
nt|smoller: on the TD decision?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Can you please tell me how to enter that Roland? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: weighted score|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: but a helpful lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  if your side is prone to raising with 3, then you probably should support the 5 card suit when you have 3|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|marlowepi: now ambiguity about forthcoming 4H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No ambiguity|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: if this makes the match is likely all over|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andyv:  unfortunate ending to this match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Østergaard thought 4@C is natural|pg||
nt|garnetts: not sure i am allowed to mention that before the watershed|pg||
nt|santyclz: If the 2 aces and 4-card @d support aren't enough for a x, surely the @c holding justifies one.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'm sure I don't know what you mean David|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D probably doesn't guarantee a diamond suit |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Blame it on your dad!|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  so did I|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: what on earth is happening here|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 rounds of spades does it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No you can't, Bas|pg||
nt|smoller: cheap for Skalman in my opinion|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I know :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well, this is unfortunate. A pity for NS. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: see my profile for the answer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: which is the next line spoken by Marcellus|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a pity because that team played so well for so long. Now the wheels have come off completely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at least a void, I'm told :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, I am reminded that @ds don't mean @ds.  That is a cost of the system people forget.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: 3@H is not much of a contract  |pg||
nt|pelu: ok winner Gary (USA) and his 4 swedish boys|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: We're almost 6 minutes in extra time, but I think any time penalties will go to Skalman, so that won't matter either|pg||
nt|smoller: This seems hopeless for East|pg||
nt|hedyg: or to Marc :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Btw, as opposed to what many people seem to think, Gary is not a sponsor, just a player|pg||
nt|smoller: yesss, Hedy|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all - back to soccer (on TV)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: What is soccer?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so congrats to Gary's boys!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, it was a most exciting match|pg||
nt|pelu: no Gary is a good friend of Peter Fredin|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The TD weighted for both. E was at fault because of the way he alerted, N as he had accepted (all the match) that alerts were made that way|pg||
nt|hedyg: our thanks to our hardworking operator Bas van Beijsterveldt, well done ! to my talented fellow commentators Raija David and Mike Graham for guiding us through these boards; as ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: well as to the Swedish Bridge Federation (Carl Ragnarsson and Tomas Brenning) for sharing this event with us.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|garnetts: I was wondering why East did not bid 1NT after 1@H too|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Thank you Hedy for your commentary here today :)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: d and s too close on the keyboard, blame it on Zitech|pg||
