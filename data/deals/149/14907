nt|lml: good morning|pg||
nt|lml: /afternoon|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2nd session... 30 boards this afternoon|pg||
nt|lml: this is one of those deals that if north south play in notrump you need to have the hand with the @HK on lead|pg||
nt|baardolav: well it is afternoon in Norway where the 4 players are. And the excellent operator Toro|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyone know the webcam link?|pg||

nt|vugraphzna: as you can see, they turned the board 180degrees|pg||
nt|lml: north south have got it right since West not East happens to have that critical card|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks Tor|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@d is one major?|pg||

nt|vugraphzna: it's syversen, actually|pg||
nt|lml: but it should still go one down.  East can ruff in hand and finesse the heart|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lml: winning the @CK would be a mistkae...oops|pg||
nt|baardolav: okey... syvertsen can make the @hq now...|pg||
nt|lml: I cant see why Hantverit didnt ruff the club to get to hand |pg||
nt|lml: it didn't cost anything to do so|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|lml: and I think he is thinking the same thing about now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: first hand - maybe not warmed up yet|pg||
nt|lml: sorry Hoyland|pg||
nt|lml: yes the first board can be the hardest|pg||
nt|lml: although the last board is always my problem... I am already halfway out the door when I play the last hand|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hantveit is one of the timeusers in Norway... |pg||
nt|mdgraham: score-up syndrome :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: I belive it is he that we wait for?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|baardolav: Very bad score for NS... 100|pg||
nt|lml: oh dear they didnt get -300|pg||
nt|lml: yes that is a bad score|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lml: -300 would still have been above average I think for e-w but -100 is a near top|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|mdgraham: I know players who would double 1@D with the South hand|pg||
nt|lml: not me|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: there is a case for this double of 1NT to be penalties |pg||
nt|lml: you can get in the second time as here anyway|pg||
nt|baardolav: i do...|pg||
nt|baardolav: the second double is penalty...|pg||
nt|lml: I don't think south meant it as penalty and I wouldn't mean it as penalty|pg||
nt|lml: I think you need to be able to balance and that is more important but I can see the argument the other way|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't think South means it as penalty either - but there is certainly a case for it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: yes I agree|pg||
pc|hK|nt|baardolav: no penalty this time... when you are loaded with  diamonds... and can not bid 1nt first time... you pass and double|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the risk of entering the bidding with the South hand is that North could be 3334 shape and you have no fit|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lml: but you dont want to pass 1NT out at matchpoints so you have to come back in|pg||

nt|lml: 3NT would have worked since even if hearts are led the suit blocks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not if South unblocks the @HJ|pg||
nt|lml: right.  He has to lead the top two hearts and south unblock|pg||
nt|lml: and there is an argument for leading a top heart in this auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. not easy, but possible.|pg||
nt|lml: it is unlikely to cost and you can always switch to clubs|pg||

nt|lml: I don't understand the double of 2@D it helps north-south|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: one problem with these kinds of 1NT defence can be sorting out the suit lengths|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: since North can show no preference and South gets to show the spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: after b34: http://bridgefestival.no/modules.php?name=NukeWrap&page=http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=Festival2010nmpar|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: doubling 2@D seems rather pointless, but then again it is pairs|pg||
nt|lml: can you see the point of the double of 2@D.  he doesn't have diamonds |pg||
nt|lml: we agree :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double shows cards... it is not a penalty double... bakke should have bid 2h|pg||
nt|lml: I would save the double to show a good five-card diamond suit or something like that|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to John-Eldar Pedersen|pg||
nt|lml: but West already showed cards|pg||
nt|johnp: hello all|pg||
nt|lml: he has a 1NT opener andhe still does|pg||

nt|lml: hi :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose you could use double to show a maximum 1NT opener|pg||
nt|johnp: long time ago since I had to use my free time for Roland, but I gladly do...|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lml: the problem with that is it shows nothing about suits.  |pg||
nt|lml: and we are talking about a 3 point range|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at pairs, there is a case to it to show 4/4 in the majors|pg||
nt|lml: yes I could see that since east is quite likely to have a 4 card major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just in case partner wants to compete - but he has passed already; presumably no 5M, as he would likely transfer with that |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lml: but -200 is quite unpleasant and is quite possible|pg||
nt|lml: and -180 is also possible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: conclusion: double seems rather pointless|pg||
nt|lml: if South has diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|lml: I like the 4-4 majors best|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: yes, South may have hearts, and you might have a 4/4 spade fit.|pg||
