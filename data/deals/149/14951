nt|andyv:  so, you are already starting with, at best, a 20% board that drops to almost 5 because most will be in 6N that don't get to 7|pg||
nt|haans: greatest error 3@D instead of 3@H|pg||
nt|haans: but how many will find 7nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  it will depend on how sophisticated their bidding is or how aggressive they are.|pg||
