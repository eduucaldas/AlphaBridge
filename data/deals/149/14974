nt|Walddk2: We have had at least 15 disconnects already today. Let's keep our fingers crossed and hope the connection will be stable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: here we go|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kdr_fm: the one major downside of a strong club is it is open to shamelss (almost suicide) barrage bids .. 1@c 3x and you are immediately on the back foot ... and 3x could be a 5 card suit ...|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: nv ..|pg||
nt|haans: my money on 3@H|pg||
mb|2C|nt|h_karluk: dis seems 4@s+1 for EW :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|sybarra: weakish type nt,  and N bidding a single suited hand (my guess) |pg||
nt|ady: no heart stopper   but can make 3NT with stiff ace    may end in 5@D   or 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|d|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: due to the blockage 3NT is cold - but 4@s seems more likely|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well moysian fit but 4@s a must|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 2@C seems capp a one suited hand|pg||
nt|haans: they simple did not find any m|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Capp is  3 on the list of "25 conventions you don't want to learn"|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|sybarra: for a moment,, N will be happy to see ace|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now 12 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: will make 11 tricks as they lay|pg||
nt|sybarra: what is your favorite over NT Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Woolsey or Meckwell|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A NT defence that does not have 2@C as both majors is not worth playing|pg||

nt|sybarra: interesting comment Roland,  hadnt thought about that feature|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You need to be able to ask for the longer major with 2@D; that's why 2@C is a must|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand   in spades for e/w|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Elementary my dear Watson|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: so EW overboard|pg||
nt|ady: looks like they overboard|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wonder if W is thinking E has a 5 card major |pg||
nt|haans: Half-Astro DavidC's Bridge Blog |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: If west figures the hand wasnt worth opening then it isnt worth a jump to 4@s opposite a 3rd in hand opener ... with the balanced nature 3NT could be an alternative|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: i assign the blame to West, imho he should check the depth with drury/revdrury, on the other hand i don't believe 3rd seat 4 cards M good idea |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|sybarra: why couldnt E open 1 @D?  (I know the "suit" is junky)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: agree, 1@d good|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would also open 1@S in 3rd seat but I don't expect partner to punish me|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: If West thinks he has an opener, he should have opened|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: I have to confess I'd open 1@s too - for lead purposes .... and ofc we have a drury like 2@c to chk|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ady: rather not open than start with 1D!|pg||
nt|ady: 1@D|pg||
nt|haans: i dont this premping double raise after opening third is a good idea If opps are dead they tend to be|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|s6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think we can also discuss 1st seat pass ok or not with 3 aces|pg||
