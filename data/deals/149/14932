nt|andyv:  yes but hard to see it|pg||
nt|marcsmith: NS can make 6H but bidding it may not be s easy|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: 4H seems premature tho|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  I always find 4@h unsatisfactory when you have such great trump|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes, but here 3D is not going to do much to encourage North|pg||
nt|andyv:  perhaps over 3@c S should bid 4@c|pg||
nt|marcsmith: perhaps 4D by North over Dbl is better -- would that be a splinter?|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzjr: EW leading T/9 shows 0 or 2 higher cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: This is a hand which has transportation problem, with only entry to hand even 2@s not easy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Hamdi. |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i believe that's another everyday situation, players sometimes get excited with 20 points|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but there's a solution with such holdings, just double then cue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: your partner will recognize you've the 20+ and pick the suitable level|pg||
nt|the saint: Off centre overcall from East|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: after this fact there's a double dummy solution|pg||

mb|1H|nt|andyv:  slam almost made|pg||
nt|cappjr:  just in case partner has 5 trumps and the club ace??|pg||
nt|andyv:  just needed 3 more tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No, because 4@D describes the hand below game|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 6H is a truly horrible contract even without the 5-0 trump break|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|andyv:  my problem with 4@d is S isn't aware the N isn't looking for @s help.... 4@c just puts the ball back into N'|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 2C GF relay rpresumably|pg||
nt|andyv:  N's court and he can decide if he wants to proceed.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 4C from North? seems about right at red|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: 3C seems sort of feeble|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
nt|andyv:  auction almost same as CR|pg||
nt|marcsmith: after 4C Soutyh would have an easy raise to 5C which would really stick it to West|pg||
nt|andyv:  in CR, E bid 4@c over 3@c|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 5C would beget 5H-6H-X methinks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To celebrate his 11 count?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S never peeped until his final turn when he dbld 6@h|pg||
nt|marcsmith: can anyone tell me what's wrong with 1H-1S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was different in the closed room as 2NT was forcing to game with heart support|pg||
nt|andyv:  and been informed S is of the female gender so my apologies|pg||
nt|ritong: uh?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then 4@C by East makes more sense|pg||
nt|marcsmith: spades is likely to play much better than hearts |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not so Andy|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  ah ha... misinformed again!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Alexandre was male last time, so unless ...|pg||
nt|ahalim: bj mon ami :)|pg||
nt|ritong: possibly regarding other room|pg||
nt|marcsmith: South's failure to bid has allowed the opponents to find their spade fit now|pg||
mb|4C|nt|marcsmith: if he'd raised clubs as he surely should oppo would surely end up in hearts at some level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room South is a young lady, Ms Xie|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marcsmith: now he raises having allowed the oppo to describe their hands|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i truly hate that typeof bidding|pg||
nt|marcsmith: West styill trying to play in the wrong suit|pg||
mb|5C|nt|marcsmith: how many spades does he think 3S shows|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|3C|mb|4C|nt|the saint: 2@S two suited? And do we know the agreed range? |pg||
nt|Walddk6: Welcome Alan and Robin|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi |pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: Balancing protection from North.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|h_karluk: when you see trumps 3-1 you can go with another round trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : 3-2 trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry for typo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Flat 4@H EW but will NS find there sac?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|r|nt|rmb1: 3@H probably invitational, with 2NT sign-off (Lebensohl) not that North is being invited anywhere :)|pg||
nt|the saint: Has walked into a strong hidden West hand. If East can have that hand then West must be an absolute supermax pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A interesting 5@D. At right hand and a @H endplay?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: i said DD solution, the reason is quite obvious, south's 4 hcp could be @d A, in that case your K works |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Snorri Sveinsson|pg||
nt|snorris: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Hi there, wlcm|pg||
nt|the saint: If 2N is Leb and X can be weaker, shouldn't S transfer a King?|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|snorris: 12 tricks|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|snorris: will top @cs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but then maybe the question is why they did not try slam|pg||
nt|snorris: its a good slam actually|pg||
nt|the saint: I must confess a vested interest. I have known NS since they were 14-15. |pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|rmb1: Its rather an inaccurate position, if you "transfer a King" the TO double has a large effective range|pg||
nt|the saint: It will have a larger one simply through protecting|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|h_karluk: <my review, my analyse> 2@d huge underbid|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|rmb1: I met the "UK" team (asn TD) when they beat Oxford in the final of UK unniversities championship to qualify.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|the saint: North, Graeme, is better known as 'Daaaaaaave' (long story) and South, David, as 'Mr Fish'.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|snorris: think 2@ds is gf and 3nt showing flat hand|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|rodal f: UPS:( Had time to wait for that. Test ure @H!!!|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|the saint: In fact, I don't think I have called them Graeme or David for at least 3 years|pg||
pc|c2|nt|snorris: but west should continue|pg||
nt|rmb1: It was confusing to have two davids in the team when one was referred to Fish and one non-David was referred to a Daaaave|pg||
nt|the saint: Graeme is actually his middle name. His passport says David|pg||
nt|rmb1: There is a debate on BBF on responding to (2M)-P-(P)-X-(P) with CAQxxxx and an outside A: is it too good for 3@C?|pg||
nt|the saint: It looks like Mr Fish can only make two more|pg||
nt|the saint: If he attempts to set up the club he gets forced in spades|pg||

mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|h_karluk: maybe in his area there are such trends, in general consumes space, not a good bid|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You have been dealt a two-suiter, so why show it as single-suited? You could have 6@C on and play in 2@S on 6-1 or 6-0|pg||
nt|marcsmith: if defence keep leading diamonds, the 4-1 trump break might come in to play|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i agree|pg||
nt|gracelin: How to rebid a 6-4 hand after a forcing 1NT response depends mostly on styles. The old fashion way is to rebid suit with a minimum and bid a new 4-card suit with extra.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: alhoug presumably 1N was forcing, so 2C doesn't always show clubs anyway|pg||
nt|marcsmith: the idea is that if partner bids 2NT then 1S-1N-2C-2N-3S is forcing so shows extras and 6-4|pg||
nt|marcsmith: but 1S-1N-2S-2N-3C is a weak 6-4 and nf|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, that's the thought.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i wouldn't consider than West hand a minimum tho|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, they played that in 50's|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|snorris: a lucky 3 nt n-s|pg||
nt|snorris: or not...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|the saint: I don't know what position Daaaaave was playing for by cashing and exiting in spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|snorris: @s lead kills it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double dummy makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: and of course repeated @s lead when in on@d k|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1st trick @sA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: rest well known|pg||
nt|snorris: might be better to take it with the jack and hope for no repet of @s lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in case 4-4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Howard and specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: EW is playing a strong club system, west can have on 4@hs and about 9 hcps|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: how about 5/3|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT E/W - be hard now to get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Will E feel the open from N as music at the air?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: As 4@S also was on.|pg||
nt|the saint: Off centre rebid best on that shape. N/S are playing straightforward 2/1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will try to do my best. AND SPECS. Come with inputs:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: maybe that's why east is hesitate to compete|pg||
pc|d4|nt|the saint: This may boil down to guessing the @D queen. Two trumps and a spade loser seem assured|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|snorris: if you take it with ace east just ducks @s next time to keep connected with west|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @sA+ @dA+@dQ|pg||
nt|the saint: It may be difficult to get a complete count on the hand, so it is possible with the trump length being with W that Mr Fish will play E for the diamond length|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|snorris: now east must play @s|pg||
nt|snorris: well only 8 tricks wven if he plays @h|pg||

pc|c3|pc|h7|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|snorris: e-w not quit in tune with how many @ss west has shown|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d9|nt|the saint: He can work out W is 4-4-x-x from the spade carding and trump length. I don't think he can work out any more. E is therefore 4-2-x-x so it becomes 7:5 to play East for the @D Q?|pg||

nt|ritong: admittedly, @d shift reduces to ten tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  only way the board would have been interesting is if this were a BAM|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: 6C has some merit here|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6C is a very decent contract for EW here.  Cold without a H lead and about 50% on H lead.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: probably goes down on a heart lead as the cards lie|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|marcsmith: would anyone else pass that East hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: yes, percentage play to establish D is to ruff out DK.|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|Walddk2: I would pass it|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|gracelin: Whether to open the East hand is a close decision.  I probably will today, but choose to pass tomorrow.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: it wouldn't occur to me to pass but it's not as attractive if you have to choose between 1D and 2C|pg||
nt|ritong: ditto|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i don't think it's particularly close|pg||
nt|andyv:  does lead make any difference how you play the @ds?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: no but on a non-heart lead you can just give up a diamond|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  so, on @h lead you need to get it right|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  so, lead does make a difference|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 2H bid may stop the H lead, but not sure if East has sown his strong 5-card lyb suit .|pg||
nt|ritong: as pat said three lines ago|pg||
nt|marcsmith: on a heart lead you have to guess and on this layout would get it wrong|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree, Marc|pg||
nt|marcsmith: well, i have no idea what the auction means -- has anyone actually bid te suit in which slam is decent?|pg||
nt|andyv:  W who doesn't have the suit (@cs):)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: I'd guess 1NT shows controls and 2C is a transfer to diamonds and 2H shows 4h|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N is xfer to @cs|pg||
nt|marcsmith: how West is supposed to guess that 6C is a possibility is beyond me|pg||
nt|gracelin: East's 1NT bid was alerted so maybe it showed clubs.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: ah ic 1N clubs|pg||
nt|andyv:  no worries because it's not going to happen|pg||
nt|marcsmith: ah so East has shown 4-5|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: not so easy for North to lead a heart|pg||
nt|marcsmith: so 6C would have made with West declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  that doesn't do any harm|pg||
nt|marcsmith: north clearly would have led a spade|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, I don't think N would have found @h lead.. probably @s or @c|pg||
nt|gracelin: so an imp to China.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: you would think so yes|pg||
nt|marcsmith: once East passes it's difficult to get to slam -- West can never envisage such a powerful hand in terms of playing strength|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marcsmith: usually Strong Club pairs open that sort of hand 2C |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|marcsmith: perhaps they don;t have a standard Precision style 2C available|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|ritong: not sure this is viable|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h7|pc|dK|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's a little light 2nd hand.  11 HCP with a singleton Q.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: light? nah|pg||
mc|12|nt|gracelin: Aceless and a weak 4-card major.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: good suit, capability to raise a response in either major|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: N/S should get to either 4@h or 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: 3NT seems down on a @c lead 4@h needs a good guess in trumps and even then|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: so 7 save should not be bad|pg||
nt|the saint: What can I say? He proved me wrong|pg||
mb|1D|nt|snorris: e-w might get doubled in 5@s on 5@hs!|pg||

pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: in my book that's "the trap deal" |pg||

nt|marcsmith: here you are quite happy for the opps to go down in 100s if it's your hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  S thinking of raising @cs?|pg||
nt|gracelin: against a weak NT opening, North has more reason to reopen.  I will do it probably 3 times a week.|pg||
nt|ritong: very funny|pg||
mb|3S|nt|marcsmith: disagree|pg||
nt|marcsmith: you need more to bid over a weak NT than a strong NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  nope|pg||
nt|marcsmith: here South is worth 3S over a weak NT|pg||
nt|marcsmith: has to look for game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: over a srong NT you should bid on any shape and partner should just find a fit|pg||
nt|gracelin: north shouldn't even be thinking of raising to game.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: he did not imo|pg||
nt|marcsmith: if you assume that when the oppo open a strong NT you don't have game, you can bid freely with shape and few values knowing partner will not hang you|pg||
nt|marcsmith: he has to|pg||
nt|marcsmith: it North has a decent 5-4 game could easily be cold|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm not wild about S's 3@s bid... N bid 2@c in p.o. seat.. like any balancing action, S has to give pd room to have a poor hand.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i disagree -- i think anything less than 3S is a huge underbid|pg||
nt|marcsmith: but then it wouldn't have occured to me to bid on that North hand|pg||
nt|ritong: i think he should bid 2@d, apparently "please pick your longer", then convert @hs in @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: as an invite|pg||
nt|gracelin: I fully agree with south's 3S bid, and I thk he will make it by using his long clubs. |pg||
nt|marcsmith: he'll make it ok but that's not really the issue|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think S has ways to invite without jumping|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|marcsmith: smile when he bids 2S?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gracelin: but will reach at least 3S anyway.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|marcsmith: seems like had work to me -- i'd much rather sit and collect 100-200 from 1NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  many use 2@d as asking for further description and pass or correct pd's 2@h bid... 2@s by pd would show invite values|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 4441 shapes are defensive|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@s over 2@d|pg||
nt|marcsmith: particularly with all those soft values|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|marcsmith: if North bids 2S over 2D ask then surly South should bid game|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|andyv:  right... because 2@s would show a good hand|pg||
nt|ritong: nine cards fit certainly makes a difference, yes|pg||
nt|marcsmith: well, North is supposed to be at least 5-4|pg||
nt|ritong: it would show longer @ss, basically|pg||
nt|andyv:  this relay has been around for 30 years|pg||
nt|marcsmith: it assumes you're playing a lousy method over 1NT tho|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why with min. hand, N would simply bid 2@h... S would p/c that|pg||
nt|marcsmith: against a weak NT, some sort of Asptro is much better|pg||
nt|gracelin: but most use 2D as either natural or a waiting bid for partner to bid his longer major.|pg||
nt|andyv:  an adjunct of Landy if you want to call it a lousy method|pg||
nt|marcsmith: it's why almost everyone plays that method is weak NT land|pg||
nt|marcsmith: it's a mthod designed for bidding over a strong NT tho|pg||
nt|marcsmith: which is totally different|pg||
nt|marcsmith: the whole philosophy is different against weak rather than strong NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: a 3rd trump will make 3S cold here.  On a red suit lead, declarer can play on clubs to pitch losers in other red suit, after losing to CQ.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c2|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|marcsmith: declarer would have done better to duck 2nd trump, wich would have endplayed East|pg||

nt|rmb1: Ugly 1NT has left East bidding his major at 3 level|pg||

nt|snorris: south 4@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: yes|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|the saint: North's 2@S bid is a fine example of what is known in English U20 circles as a 'Chucker Raise'. Backing in later with support, trying either to go for 800 or collect 670. |pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: as i predicted 4@s quite normal contract in such auctions and 5@c nine out of ten would receive double|pg||
nt|snorris: and north 5@ds?|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: yes|pg||
nt|the saint: Named for junior James 'Chucker' Thrower who was a master of it|pg||
nt|rmb1: A manouvre we are capable of (however non-U20)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|snorris: well well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: should have been misjudged|pg||
nt|iceking: 3sp 2d 1club and what 3-4 trump tricks for 800-1100 |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|snorris: well 200 for e-w is better then 170|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||

nt|snorris: then 9 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: oh and the u exp pd with Jxx to bid 3NT????|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i think 4@h has a chance after @s lead, say west decides to hold up|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: double @H finesse = 75% start withe the @h8 so as not to block|pg||
nt|zman1: its hard bidding 6@D knowing partner has 2@S|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: Dbl or 2C, or pass with the North hand over 1S ?|pg||

pc|c5|pc|d6|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|marcsmith: if partner has a double that will deliver four hearts 90+% of the time you can afford to compete to 3H|pg||

nt|the saint: Ah, the cuebidding roundabout - once you get on it, you can never get off in time|pg||
nt|rmb1: When Alan became almost old enough to play Gerber he co-invented sliding rainbow gerber where any bid from 4@C+ could be Gerber|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s2|pc|c5|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: 4@S probably the best|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|Walddk2: But you won't get to game as NS if you never bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yhey open on nothing and respond on less|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Daylight robbery|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where is the bridge police?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: You are :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: This won't make but he is not doubled|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so 200 is not bad against the N-S game|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Admittedly, EW made it very tough on NS. Not clear if and how they could get in|pg||

nt|Walddk2: OK then, looks like 300 now, so close to adequate compensation for the missed game|pg||

nt|vugraphzjr: east could have bid 3@s instead of 4, but i think its hard to stay at 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Roland on again|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Many thanks to Bridge Base Online and our great commentators!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|iceking: 54 imps in 16 boards is like 25-3 in vp |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|iceking: this might end here |pg||
nt|othered1: what a way to bid the east hand, even if it likely shows @S and minor|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: that R/W overcall is... not my choice|pg||
mb|1N|nt|the saint: Looks like both games are doomed and only double dummy play will keep 3N one off|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|mtvesuvius: wow, 3@h -- X seems much better if he is going to take a call|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: streetfight is under the reality|pg||
mb|3C|nt|the saint: A chance NS could end up in 4S|pg||
nt|iceking: might as well open 1h instead |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Looks like they will avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|the saint: That won't make either|pg||
nt|the saint: 4@S is not a bad spot|pg||
nt|othered1: If you're going to open north with 1N, it's likely your later judgment won't be optimal, either.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: That one is a bit hard. But look at 4@H|pg||
nt|iceking: 3h is really not  a option here either pass or dbl |pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Many thanks to Bridge Base Onilne for providing a great broadcast!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: Is there a systemic reason north couldn't open 11H?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: not that I know of|pg||
nt|iceking: i doubt that |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I played their system notes with Mitch last week|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and unless there is something I forgot, he could have opened this 1H (1N then semiforcing)... but chose 1N. Once he makes that decision though, needs to stick with it on the second ...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: round of bidding|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|the saint: Short trump hand takes the heart force|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|s9|nt|the saint: MAke on any 3-3@S doubleton @SQ, and probably doubleton @S 9 too|pg||
nt|zman1: so another 25 VP's for USA :)|pg||
nt|ritong: the funny part of it is it won t cost any victorypoint, likely|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|othered1: In the Dark Ages, many thought it best not to put too many hands into 1N, since it can be tough to make good choices of games, etc.  But that has changed, it seems.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|mtvesuvius: the fact that it isn't good hasn't changed, Ed :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|iceking: how much do you need for 25 in 16 boards|pg||

pc|s2|nt|iceking: 40-42 probably |pg||
nt|iceking: something like that|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|s7|nt|the saint: Thanks all. Entertaining as always from the boys|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzjr: many thanks to Bridge Base Online for providing a great environment!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|the saint: A lack of accuracy at both tables cost them in this match. Well played China|pg||
nt|rmb1: More from this event tomorrow and vuegraph continues from Norway and Sweden today (e.g. from me in 10 minutes)|pg||
nt|the saint: Time to stick the kettle on then|pg||
