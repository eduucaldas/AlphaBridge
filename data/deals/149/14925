pc|hQ|pc|s4|pc|h6|nt|psridhar: many play 4 lev bids as broken suits that need help for slam|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ady: if fact can make all 13 with diamond finesse|pg||
nt|rv: that explains 4n RKC and failure of SOuth to show void with key cards|pg||

nt|rv: everyone in panel leading a low @h?|pg||
nt|ady: I would have led a heart    think it pays to lead from that kind of holding especially with 5 card suit|pg||
nt|haans: do not like clubs lead = to me hiding |pg||
nt|haans: lead from  queen safer|pg||
nt|ady: you may have found that partner had help in hearts  rather than the strength in spades and present contract with 5 top winners|pg||
nt|haans: i do take that risk|pg||
nt|ady: you will get around an average score if heart lead works badly     but a very low score if heart lead is good  and dont lead it|pg||
