mb|p|nt|rodal f: Good evening all from Norway.|pg||

mb|2S|nt|vugraphzjr: EW leading T/9 shows 0 or 2 higher cards|pg||
mb|3C|nt|h_karluk: This is a hand which has transportation problem, with only entry to hand even 2@s not easy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Hamdi. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i believe that's another everyday situation, players sometimes get excited with 20 points|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but there's a solution with such holdings, just double then cue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: your partner will recognize you've the 20+ and pick the suitable level|pg||
nt|the saint: Off centre overcall from East|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|h_karluk: after this fact there's a double dummy solution|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|the saint: Too many cards look well placed to defeat this. And the diamond blockage is preventing the defence from setting up a force|pg||

mb|1N|nt|gracelin: 1NT seems to be a normal contract.  On H10 lead, declarer needs to guess SJ t make it.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|sybarra: we might all open 1 nt,   just happens to not make |pg||
nt|sybarra: or the guess as Patrick says|pg||
nt|gracelin: Declarer, doesn't want a club shift from north, might take right view on spade.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|the saint: 2@S two suited? And do we know the agreed range? |pg||
nt|Walddk6: Welcome Alan and Robin|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi |pg||
pc|h3|nt|the saint: Balancing protection from North.|pg||
nt|jlall: NS almost cold for 3N, but the red 9s that EW have are enough to stop it|pg||
nt|hackenbush:  sitting EW are Roger Lee and Jeremy Fournier from USA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|h_karluk: when you see trumps 3-1 you can go with another round trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : 3-2 trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry for typo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Flat 4@H EW but will NS find there sac?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|rmb1: 3@H probably invitational, with 2NT sign-off (Lebensohl) not that North is being invited anywhere :)|pg||
nt|the saint: Has walked into a strong hidden West hand. If East can have that hand then West must be an absolute supermax pass|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rodal f: A interesting 5@D. At right hand and a @H endplay?|pg||
nt|jlall: west decided to give up before any doubling started|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: i said DD solution, the reason is quite obvious, south's 4 hcp could be @d A, in that case your K works |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Snorri Sveinsson|pg||
nt|snorris: Hi|pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: Hi there, wlcm|pg||
nt|the saint: If 2N is Leb and X can be weaker, shouldn't S transfer a King?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hackenbush:  NS from Germany are Thomas Gotard and Jan-Hendrik De Wiljes|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jlall: best defense here is to pull the trumps and exit with a spade|pg||
pc|d5|nt|snorris: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|jlall: so that fournier cant take any heart tricks|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|snorris: will top @cs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but then maybe the question is why they did not try slam|pg||
nt|snorris: its a good slam actually|pg||
nt|the saint: I must confess a vested interest. I have known NS since they were 14-15. |pg||
pc|d8|pc|c3|nt|rmb1: Its rather an inaccurate position, if you "transfer a King" the TO double has a large effective range|pg||
nt|the saint: It will have a larger one simply through protecting|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: <my review, my analyse> 2@d huge underbid|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|h9|nt|rmb1: I met the "UK" team (asn TD) when they beat Oxford in the final of UK unniversities championship to qualify.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|the saint: North, Graeme, is better known as 'Daaaaaaave' (long story) and South, David, as 'Mr Fish'.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: Operator, when you get a chance, could you find out the actual player names?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|snorris: think 2@ds is gf and 3nt showing flat hand|pg||

nt|gracelin: South worried partner's DQ is from KQ10x so another D play will establish declarer's hypothetical DJ.|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1H|nt|gracelin: maybe north should shift to a club after winning DQ.|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: As often in Norway + 1@S is 3+|pg||
nt|lmeili: 1@s denied 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|gracelin: 1S could be showing less than 4-S as played by many partnerships these day.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ritong: yes, double would be @ss, 1 NT notrumps i suppose, so 1@s = " i m stuck"|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gracelin: a very useful gadget.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: that one should be strongly suggesting some slaughter|pg||
nt|rodal f: While others often promiss 5@S by the 1@S bid Henri. Matter of style/agreement|pg||
nt|ritong: that double, i mean|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: I also don't see the 3C bid.  Why not a straight forward 3H ? Does West suddenly find game interest or he wants to bring club/Diamond into picture ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: you can check what we talked about previously|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: south opened 1@c with 4@ds|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, one of the hand types of a 1C opening is a minimum balanced hand.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks like -1 here.|pg||
nt|gracelin: unless south shifts to D now, or cash SA,K.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south may also be puzzled by the 3C bid.|pg||
nt|gracelin: from north's count signals, south shud know by now that declarer has 6H + 3D.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|gracelin: south obviously played declarer for 0-6-3-4, thus the low spade shift.|pg||

nt|hackenbush: unfortunate that they reached their 7-0 instead of 7-1 slam|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|snorris: this looks like 4@ss|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: footnote : i guess EW 1N is not 15-17 balanced|pg||
nt|rodal f: An other nice layout, but bid it.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Karel from Ireland|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kdr_fm: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush:  Both have represented the US numerous times in junior international tournaments.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|snorris: they play weak nt|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in a natural sys there would be some remedy : ie uncontested 1N>3@s (mild slam invite at diamonds)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi karel|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: gotcha thanks|pg||
nt|snorris: schaltz with a wild 3@hs|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Karel and welcome. Nice to see u:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: UK did not bid on board 1 in OR, so China made 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Another slam for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: hackenbush is also a member of the USA A team :)|pg||
nt|jlall: kibitzers pointing out that 3N would make on the last hand if the defense chose to lead a spade rather than a heart, that is true|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|h_karluk: maybe in his area there are such trends, in general consumes space, not a good bid|pg||
pc|h9|nt|the saint: Is that some kind of 5 card stayman or other method? Can't see any reason for enquiring otherwise|pg||
nt|jlall: this hand is not cold, I think declarer will play to ruff a heart and ruff a diamond (if necessary) in the dummy|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jlall: then he would be at risk of losing 2 trump tricks to K9xx, but it's possible he can score his small trumps in his hand via ruffing also|pg||
pc|d2|nt|snorris: many ways to 10/11 tricks here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if somebody intends to do that in USA sectionals or regionals warning auto comes : dont try to play both sides of the table|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: looks like a good stop @d ruff avail plus 3 aces|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hackenbush:  The open room started on board 15-16, so that by the time they start playing board 1 and on, there will be score comparisons.|pg||
nt|jlall: so it wouldn't surprise me to see declarer never touch trumps until the end|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|rmb1: Perhaps he would have the option of finding/showing a small doubleton and playing 4-3 H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzjr: Unlegal first lead, TD|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzjr: NS use kickback RKC 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: 4@s show 0/3, 4N ask @dQ|pg||
nt|jlall: now something like winning the DA, ace of hearts heart ruff, diamond to the king and a diamond seems likely. Winning the DA and leading one towards the king later in case lee has 5 ...|pg||
nt|jlall: diamonds, that way Fournier would only have the option of ruffing air|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard to see any road to bid 4@H EW. Any ideas Hamdi and Karel?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzjr: the first round is @C5-@C8-@CK-@CA|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Now the contract is 5@D by West|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzjr: 6@d show @dQ and no other Ks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|the saint: If South had covered, the 6,5 and 4 of clubs were eventually going to be promoted|pg||
nt|the saint: May concede an overtrick of they get too active. |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|snorris: and 12 tricks|pg||
nt|hackenbush: it's often right to lead trumps on a preference auction, though leading from @cAK might be safer to get a look at dummy|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rmb1: Or more than one|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sound line|pg||
nt|jlall: playing the SQ first seems risky...if they won and came back a spade you may have 2 diamond losers 1 spade loser and 1 heart loser|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|rodal f: And right u was:)|pg||
mc|6|nt|jlall: he can survive this line though by simply cashing a diamond, playing ace of clubs ruff a club and exiting a diamond|pg||
pg||
qx|o4|st||md|2SQT9543HDT953CA92,S6HKJ7643DACJ7653,SAJ2HQT82DJ72CKQ4,SK87HA95DKQ864CT8|sv|b|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|gracelin: EW will probably be in 4H after the 1H opening.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Major fight til level 3?|pg||
nt|ritong: can we afford a safety lay? does not seem so|pg||
nt|ritong: play*|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rodal f: 3@C was a hard bid|pg||
nt|ritong: when you have eight or nine cards including AKJ, the first thing which comes to mind is to draw K, in this layout|pg||
nt|ritong: AKJ*|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ritong: AKJ9 grr:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: north shud deduct from opponent's bidding that his partner has distribution rather than strength|pg||
nt|ritong: this caters with Qxx both sides|pg||
nt|ritong: Q10xx*|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: to lose one trick only|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: in 3H maybe, Henri.  in 4H south cannot afford to have a trump loser, not to say that he also need club ruff with dummy's trump.|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, that was the initial question  can he afford it?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as the premium come after the 3@C bid.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|gracelin: will north double this ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: SIKORA for X now?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: Nope|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3 round of clubs are best for defense now.|pg||
nt|ritong: now he has three pitches|pg||
nt|ritong: so the safety play enters the picture for good|pg||
nt|ritong: for down one, yes, but a trick is a trick|pg||
nt|gracelin: if he were in 3H :)|pg||
nt|ritong: ta ta ta|pg||
nt|ritong: you certainly hate going down two when down one was easy, pat|pg||
nt|gracelin: in 3H, even after 3 round of clubs now, declarer has a safety play in trump to finesse H9 the first round if north follows.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|gracelin: but in 4H when declarer has good hope to make his contract, he will probably cash HA first.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: 1st trick @sA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: rest well known|pg||
nt|snorris: might be better to take it with the jack and hope for no repet of @s lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in case 4-4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Howard and specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: EW is playing a strong club system, west can have on 4@hs and about 9 hcps|pg||
nt|jlall: 3N looks like the best game|pg||
nt|jlall: and fournier is angling towards that with 2N|pg||
nt|jlall: I predict a 3N bid from lee, he has spade help and very slow values|pg||
nt|jlall: of course, no game looks very good on this layout, it's tough to stop with 25 HCP|pg||
nt|hackenbush: open room started on board 15 and 16 so that by the time they get to board 1, there will be score comparisons|pg||
pc|d7|nt|h_karluk: how about 5/3|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT E/W - be hard now to get there|pg||
nt|jlall: lee might be considering bidding 3S as a choice of games|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will E feel the open from N as music at the air?|pg||
nt|jlall: a bit scientific|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: As 4@S also was on.|pg||
nt|the saint: Off centre rebid best on that shape. N/S are playing straightforward 2/1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will try to do my best. AND SPECS. Come with inputs:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: maybe that's why east is hesitate to compete|pg||
nt|jlall: perhaps he's worried fournier only has K9x of spades or so|pg||
pc|h2|nt|the saint: This may boil down to guessing the @D queen. Two trumps and a spade loser seem assured|pg||
nt|jlall: now after the "don't lead spades" double, I think lee will certainly bid 3N|pg||
nt|jlall: the only thing that argues for hearts about his hand is that he has good trumps, everything else is very notrumpy|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: however, a @D give more challenge to 3N, declarer has only 1 @S trick|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s5|pg||
nt|grypho:  E is going to be happy hearts are not 2-2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|snorris: if you take it with ace east just ducks @s next time to keep connected with west|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @sA+ @dA+@dQ|pg||
nt|the saint: It may be difficult to get a complete count on the hand, so it is possible with the trump length being with W that Mr Fish will play E for the diamond length|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jlall: the other thing is that he wants to play it from his side probably, but fournier would XX 3@S with the ace|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kevin Wilson|pg||
nt|jlall: Hi Kevin|pg||
nt|grypho:  Hi|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|snorris: now east must play @s|pg||
nt|snorris: well only 8 tricks wven if he plays @h|pg||
nt|snorris: then west MUST play @s|pg||
nt|rmb1: As Alan suggest 4@S was off on board 2, so a huge 15IMP to China-A|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jlall: close to making on a partial strip now, but south would get a club ruff|pg||
nt|grypho:  if clubs were 3-3 a partial elimination might work, but not here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|jlall: if he pulls 2 diamonds and allt he trumps, north can just play a spade|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|grypho:  any hocus pocus you can see J?|pg||
nt|jlall: nope|pg||
nt|jlall: not even double dummy|pg||
nt|jlall: single dummy he's just going to hope the club jack or queen is onside im sure|pg||
nt|grypho:  yes, it seems like all roads lead to 1 down unless N makes a significant mistake and cashes the @cAce|pg||
nt|hackenbush: easy 11 tricks here|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c5|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://ubridge2010.nsysu.edu.tw/result/round.php?rid=9  for results and standings after round 9|pg||
nt|jlall: do you think he should have bid 3N kevin? or was he right to try and rightside it with all of his kings and spade queen?|pg||
nt|jlall: he probably got to the better game (1 club honor onside) so it couldnt have been too bad|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kdr_fm: I open pretty light and even 4441 I'd still pass N - but worked very well here keeping E/W out of a cold game|pg||
pc|cA|nt|grypho:  I think he should have bid 3nt because there was no reason to expect an extra trick in hearts.  I take partner's 2NT bid seriously|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|hJ|nt|jlall: both games are really bad anyways hehe|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|snorris: so -1...|pg||
nt|snorris: maybe -2 if west plays @ds and schaltz goes for it|pg||
nt|snorris: e-w not quit in tune with how many @ss west has shown|pg||
pc|s8|mc|9|nt|the saint: He can work out W is 4-4-x-x from the spade carding and trump length. I don't think he can work out any more. E is therefore 4-2-x-x so it becomes 7:5 to play East for the @D Q?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: North's @HQ overruff is a mistake|pg||
nt|grypho:  north could have cashed 2 high @cs and held this to 3, but he was trying to beat 2@h, not 4@hs|pg||

nt|rodal f: We have all 52 cards|pg||
nt|gracelin: I thk declarer has a sure play if trumps behave..|pg||
nt|rodal f: But what will N do|pg||
nt|gracelin: if East leads a club and on  the 3rd round club, dclarer has a guess.|pg||
nt|gracelin: could be right to discard a D if East has trump Qx and DK.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gracelin: now declarer can duck this, draw trumps and eliminated spades, then club to J will guarantee contract.|pg||

nt|sjicheng: hi everyone:)|pg||
nt|grypho:  this may appear to have a chance at going down if declarer were to misguess diamonds shomehow, but the hand will be stripped first and then the @d will endplay W|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|h_karluk: in my book that's "the trap deal" |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: hard enough to play seeing all the cards - you can pitch a club on a spade (stop the S hand being forced) so comes down to which way you play the @h's|pg||

nt|grypho:  I think he'll get it right and ruff with the 8 or the J|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kdr_fm: reasonable line no joy|pg||
nt|grypho:  Now that I think about it, he may drop the @dK IF he guesses @hs wrong here|pg||

mb|p|nt|snorris: a fair one|pg||
nt|othered1: Just tying to conjure up a rationale for the double|pg||
nt|jlall: this auction is a little different, since EW did not guarantee a fit|pg||

nt|jlall: some might make a hypermodern X of 1@H with the south hand but I don't think that's their style|pg||
mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: prev deal 7@d would pay 800|pg||
nt|zman1: wonder if owen will underlead the K@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: Often OK to watch the way to the max|pg||
nt|hackenbush: partner is allowed to have a pretty good hand for balancing 2@h still, since double and new suit by balancing hand shows about same strength as the same action direct seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: in practice i doubt many WGM would imagine that save|pg||

nt|jlall: these small hands add up|pg||
nt|grypho:  but you would have doubled with south?|pg||
nt|jlall: i would have|pg||
nt|jlall: i guess that shows my general philosophy to get in early so you don't have to worry about it later hehe|pg||
nt|grypho:  i'm not that modern, i much prefer shortness in the bid suit |pg||
nt|jlall: 2@S is not so risky though, lee won't have 4 spades to bid 1N and fournier has 6 hearts so he's unlikely to have 4 spades...at least if you're wrong you don't often get doubled|pg||
nt|jlall: so it was a calculated bid by gotard|pg||
nt|grypho:  what about rebidding 2@c instead of 2@h?|pg||
nt|jlall: not a fan with hearts as good as KQJT9x, but in general yes i like it|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c3|nt|kdr_fm: @s best chance now hoping N played @Sj from @SKJxxx orginally|pg||

pc|s3|nt|jlall: so he has chosen to bid 4@S to show such a hand|pg||
nt|jlall: now the textbook bid with fourniers shape would be 4N to see what partners longest suit is|pg||
nt|jlall: hes not really thinking slam with this hand opposite a passed hand|pg||

pc|s2|nt|sjicheng: it's difficult for any games here|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|the saint: North's 2@S bid is a fine example of what is known in English U20 circles as a 'Chucker Raise'. Backing in later with support, trying either to go for 800 or collect 670. |pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good morning to David Carlisle|pg||
nt|hackenbush: @sJ seems like an error, the finesse will still be there the next round|pg||

nt|the saint: Named for junior James 'Chucker' Thrower who was a master of it|pg||

nt|rmb1: ... we are all capable of|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Note in board  3, north light-response then pass|pg||
nt|jlall: honestly this is not the worst slam ever, trumps coming in is close to 50/50 a priori, but the opps who have 11 spades only bidding to the 2 level is usually a strong indication ...|pg||
nt|jlall: that they dont have singletons|pg||

nt|h_karluk: the declarer draw the big picture 99% <he is supposed a good listener of the auction> but the question is was North honest with his 3@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: finito|pg||
nt|hackenbush: now squeeze in the red suits after ruffing a heart|pg||
nt|garnetts: only line now is to ruff a heart and hope the Q comes dwon when you overtake the @D or that a squeeze operates|pg||

nt|h_karluk: not personal, seems quite normal contract|pg||

nt|snorris: this will end in 3NT e-w|pg||

mb|1H|nt|garnetts: troublesome 4@H contract here|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|rodal f: Info from the turney: http://www.bridgefestival.dk/|pg||

nt|cappjr:  1 nt|pg||

nt|sjicheng: another slam going hand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|zman1: X shows GF values with no clear bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why bid 3 when EW have the majors? OK, Can be right some few times|pg||
nt|iceking: 2h ugly bid |pg||
nt|iceking: but only 2 options |pg||
nt|cappjr:  especially after his last h o'call|pg||
nt|iceking: pass is not a option in my book|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2N shows limit+ strength with a 4+fit|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|jlall: probably 1@D shows hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|zman1: X again?|pg||
nt|rodal f: X for cards?|pg||
nt|zman1: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: maybe 4@c to show @c and @h|pg||
nt|rodal f: But will he do?|pg||
nt|cappjr:  me neither|pg||
nt|jlall: and 2@D is an artificial GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 3@cs ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Only one killing lead against 6@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Snorri, you would better whisper, he might hear you:)|pg||
nt|zman1: does 4@C show @C and @H or @C and @D or @H|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@H is attempting to play 3@H|pg||
nt|grypho:  this one will be quick|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: This 2@H isn't exactly safe, either.|pg||
nt|iceking: now his pd can expect full values 2h here should be rather weakish hand |pg||
nt|iceking: cant |pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: no snorris u bid 3@c with no stopper|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: best lead for defence|pg||
nt|snorris: NOW its a must to finesse @h first time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this contract might be an unanimously one at the field|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bridge is teamwork. But all up at the systems pair use. Seems as EW might felt down at a... here. Easyer at home than international|pg||
nt|zman1: i think he will get hearts right in 6@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: 4@c puppet 4@d, 4@h was a CoG bid|pg||
nt|cappjr:  missing a decent 3 nt|pg||
nt|iceking: 1nt p 3nt and 9 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: Note the problem set for EW by south's opening on a good 4-card @S suit|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cappjr:  i was plus 600|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|snorris: with a little in @cs I bid 3 @cs|pg||
nt|snorris: no stopper I bid something else|pg||
nt|pelu: is KQ "a little" :):)|pg||
nt|snorris: only one trick with no help therefore 3@cs|pg||
nt|snorris: then 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sjicheng: en!....|pg||
nt|rodal f: The normal lead against 3NT as 6@H?|pg||
nt|sjicheng: anyway they didn't go 6@H. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: need to guess in @S or @CAQ, not a great slam I think|pg||
nt|sjicheng: i thnk so. at least it's a good choice for me|pg||
nt|grypho:  2 losers and not much to think about, one can disappear if W ducks the @sAce|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: oh and the u exp pd with Jxx to bid 3NT????|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i think 4@h has a chance after @s lead, say west decides to hold up|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: double @H finesse = 75% start withe the @h8 so as not to block|pg||
nt|zman1: its hard bidding 6@D knowing partner has 2@S|pg||
nt|iceking: well w just made a poor bid i just cant pass is an optionn here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think this should make --not any more |pg||
pc|d4|nt|snorris: he heard you:)|pg||
nt|jlall: not sure what the bidding means, but the play should be easy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|snorris: pd bids 3 nt with something in @cs|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe 3@h instead of 3N still an option|pg||
nt|snorris: he knows I have "something" :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: 3@h would be my bid:) after 2n|pg||
nt|snorris: mine too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i admit uncontested 1h,2d>2h,2sp,2n shld be main body|pg||
nt|pelu: back to the play - 3Nt can be maded now!|pg||
nt|snorris: Michael led @d??|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway. A healty contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: 1@D = 0-6 hcp or 7-11 hcp unbal w/o 4M or 13+ bal w/o 4M|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|garnetts: This shows a lack of consistency --last hand they did not mention the five card minor after a 2NT overcall and here south did|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|pelu: yes 6,5 min ago :)|pg||
nt|snorris: hehe|pg||
nt|h_karluk: guys. lol|pg||
nt|hackenbush: south has not shown a slam try, 3@d just exploring the best game|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: and some style even could try 2N at 4th seat|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|garnetts: maybe South should have sttled for 2NT or 3NT--clear that North figured South's actions were a slam try |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|pelu: let s play @sK and no defense left|pg||
nt|cappjr:  you just cant pass your strong nt hands|pg||

mb|3H!|nt|gracelin: yes, most people play that way.|pg||

nt|rodal f: How many would give full speed at E and 3@S?|pg||

nt|vugraphzjr: E-W has a light 4@S, may bid in the competition|pg||

mb|d!|nt|grypho:  agreed, good point|pg||

mb|p|nt|snorris: right|pg||

mb|3S!|nt|rodal f: Waited 2@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Undo?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|iceking: not sure why east didnt bid 2clubs here looks rather standard |pg||
nt|othered1: selling at 2-level doesn't do much better at imps than at matchpoints|pg||
nt|iceking: or dbl if playing snapdragon|pg||
nt|sjicheng: ops.... they missed:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: West refused to compete, +200 I think|pg||

nt|vugraphzph: boards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure, takk|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say 1@h, x, now an enterpsing partner would blatantly push to 4@h|pg||
nt|rodal f: What if W was 0@S and 5@H?|pg||
nt|zman1: alright =|pg||
nt|grypho:  i hate 3nt b/c it handcuffs partner... maybe 2n was non-forcing but otherwise i would have bid it|pg||
nt|jlall: 6@D will not make, 6@S would make on a likely heart lead|pg||
nt|jlall: yes 2N must be non forcing for him to jump|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 4@hs+1 as you predicted Hamid|pg||
nt|snorris: in open room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: dammit buddy, what a field :) c'est la vie|pg||
nt|zman1: 7-4 open 1N? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzph: sry :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then ew would have a dilemma|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3@h is alot even with the @CA sing adding 3 for singlton and another for the 5th diamond !!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do S have many botles energi drink by his side Howard?:)|pg||
nt|sjicheng: yes, with his 7hcp and with 2 Js |pg||
nt|grypho:  i think @s are out now and a diamond contract will be reached|pg||
nt|jlall: even 5@D is a pretty dicey contract, though safe on this layout|pg||
nt|jlall: south is probably thinking he has a pretty good hand for a diamond slam |pg||
nt|jlall: maybe he will cuebid 5@C|pg||
nt|grypho:  this does have 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|snorris: on last board|pg||
nt|rodal f: NP:) U've done well.|pg||
nt|grypho:  it depends on if he knows its a 4-4 fit or it could be better|pg||
nt|jlall: yeah im not sure what the range of his 1N bid was, and what the implications are after that|pg||
nt|jlall: maybe this is 4N natural|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Agree. Time for a system to change|pg||
nt|jlall: 4N is also a little dicey but fine on this layout|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||

nt|rodal f: Bach to the Roland hand|pg||

nt|jlall: nice stop|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: wonder sp or d now|pg||

nt|h_karluk: flip a coin :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|grypho:  6@hs fails only because trumps are 4-1 (assuming you guessed the @hQ)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: hmmm|pg||
pc|hK|nt|snorris: might be best to play for @d king and hope @s are bad..|pg||
nt|pelu: if he go wrong, then defense will set up the @h-suit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: remember previous boards @d was Kx at neck|pg||
nt|snorris: then 3nt wins and 4@ss not|pg||
pc|h5|nt|garnetts: That 5@C maybe a suit preference signal for spades |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@c<X> i don't know pass is even close, what i know 1@d a very rare preference|pg||
nt|grypho:  i would've led the @s7.  if you want declarer to think @ss aren't breaking the 7 is harder to read,,, but its splitting hairs really|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|snorris: looks strange..Andreas?|pg||
nt|jlall: yes the key point is definitely don't lead hearts|pg||
nt|jlall: partner didn't raise, and RHO bid 1N 3N 4N...hes got hearts locked up haha|pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: i think 4@s also makeable|pg||

nt|bigtrain: can be 43 in M with 5@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2N asks |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: off one fair :)|pg||
mb|3S!|an|3415 13-15hcp|nt|vugraphzjr: An interesting hand now|pg||
nt|sjicheng: so south's 1C is polish style?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Yes, Prussian Club :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@S shows a non-min with this exact shape|pg||
nt|grypho:  so 5@cs next|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: 3NT is cold but hard to bid at this situation (knowing pd 3415 12+ to 15)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3N i suspect|pg||
nt|grypho:  not with Axx of @d, no way|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@C seems less likely to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzph: said 11 tricks:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Max 200 (if Xed) to pay for EW by a normal ........|pg||
nt|jlall: maybe w/r but w/w that would be insane|pg||
nt|grypho:  can you see who's thinking|pg||
nt|jlall: uh oh|pg||
nt|jlall: it looks like south has taken this as exclusion keycard|pg||
nt|jlall: since he has shown 2 without the queen|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he'll use 4@D to get to game if that's the case|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|rodal f: Take ure unlucky 500 or try to be smart?|pg||
nt|sjicheng: ou....it becomes more interesting...|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: could be a fdriendly joke :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not Bergen?|pg||
nt|grypho:  @@vugraph  ty|pg||
mb|5C|nt|zman1: no...7-10ish with 4@S|pg||
nt|iceking: north should play spade ten here and return heart |pg||
nt|iceking: after east bidding he seldom has 4hearts |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzph: wrong hand for @d singel|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *friendly|pg||
nt|grypho:  good call|pg||
nt|jlall: im not really sure what happened, but if I had to guess south responded to exclusion keycard|pg||
nt|jlall: thats what 4@S would be if you don't play kickback|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@H is @C blackwood|pg||
nt|bigtrain: wow...  talk about a surprise evaluation|pg||
mb|6C|nt|hackenbush: what would you lead here? 4-card unbid major is nice, but often Axxx is the suit declarer needs to set up|pg||
nt|garnetts: hard for East to play low |pg||
nt|garnetts: a number of lines of play all of which get enough tricks to make ---two @D finesses for example of the simple spade finesse |pg||
nt|grypho:  if we were counting tricks with the N hand... and we know the key cards situation...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: no quick loser does not mean 12 winners|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Need to lead @H for -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: he definitely overestimated the value of the @DA...  opposite shortness it's just not a good feature|pg||
nt|grypho:  6 club tricks, 1 diamond, 1 heart, and 1 spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: yes, @S Axx @H KQx @D x @C KQTx is mush more better|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Axx KQx xxx KQTx|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the good news is 5@C was probably going down|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: scrap home in this|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: it was but now i dont now how man|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: how many tricksØ|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: *!|pg||
nt|hackenbush: @hAT now marked with west|pg||
nt|garnetts: the deep @D finesse is the easiest path because no entry is needed |pg||
pc|c3|nt|grypho:  i agree with that|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|snorris: 4@hs -1|pg||
nt|grypho:  to make 6, you need the @s finesse and 2 honors doubleton in hearts|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: Andreas you can edit when you have free time|pg||
nt|the saint: Double dummy this is always off. If this is ducked, South can switch to a diamond|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not so difficult :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|the saint: Now needs to switch.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|iceking: as it was east has 10 top tricks this time so he isnt ducking spades|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: wow|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|grypho:  nice play by BOTH ides there|pg||
pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: this could be off one|pg||
nt|jlall: playing kickback I would take 4@S as keycard, and 4N as exclusion for spades|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|c4|nt|snorris: did west know south didnt have 6 @cs?|pg||
nt|rmb1: To clarify: the @H lead was not too difficult, switching to @D after two @Hs was harder|pg||
nt|jlall: I have no idea if NS play kicback though|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|snorris: 2 imps to the ministriet|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|sjicheng: a good defence by insist on trumps|pg||
nt|bigtrain: better to lead from dummy towrds the @HA|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kdr_fm: declarer has a decsion in spades.  @sT8 play J @SQ8 play to K|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sjicheng: so far|pg||
pc|c9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|snorris: twice as good to play for the drop of the Queen|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|the saint: The difficulty for S is that he can't see the weak diamond holding in the East hand. But he doesn't have any entries to the hearts so continuing them may be futile|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now the pay comes|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1 trick lost by opening the @H|pg||
nt|zman1: has to give ruff sluff for -2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seen|pg||
nt|zman1: if you want to see them actually play by video here you go http://weblive.nsysu.edu.tw/live2010.htm|pg||
nt|rodal f: @HA?|pg||
nt|sjicheng: should be |pg||
nt|rodal f: Not that easy for S to count up N|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Yes, when S discard @CA, North should know S has no loser|pg||
nt|sjicheng: but i think HA is a reasonable discard here. it's hard for N to totally have no C|pg||
nt|rodal f: If NS use UDCA it should be clear by the @H|pg||
nt|sjicheng: and discard of HA will guide N to play C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: so North should return @C immediately|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||

nt|jlall: RKC auctions|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk:  well done Andreas, thanks fellows|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 nt n-s might give some imps|pg||

mb|p|nt|rmb1: East's diamonds can be stronger (e.g. Jxx) and a diamond from South will still work|pg||
nt|iceking: 1nt 3nt maybe or|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|h_karluk: surprised, in my standards actually fast players|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still not enough.|pg||

nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  and appreciated to the organizators & Mr Bionic Man|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT or 5@C both make 3NT chances for +1 with the @d's|pg||
nt|the saint: Y, NS play multi Landy|pg||
nt|iceking: or with no tens and 9s maybe north should just invite |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 3c|pg||

nt|zman1: or 4@C idk how he feels today|pg||
nt|cappjr:  diamond q??|pg||
nt|cappjr:  no|pg||
nt|iceking: hard to lead diamond q here |pg||
nt|iceking: need to be some kind of artist to find that|pg||
nt|cappjr:  can be 12 more imps for usa|pg||
nt|sjicheng: but i think 2H is a quite ok contract as well|pg||
pc|h6|nt|snorris: 3@cs- 3nt...my guess|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like the pass by Martin Schaltz|pg||
nt|grypho:  kickback is wonderful if you never mess it up|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but he could bid 3@c 1 level b4|pg||

pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: xx Peter?|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i see|pg||
nt|snorris: if it shows 1 stopper|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classic|pg||
nt|pelu: Yes - some play that 2Nt = doubble stop and Rd = 1 stopper|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|jlall: wow|pg||
nt|jlall: on this lead, lee is in great shape|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|the saint: Don't know. Either way, 3@D kind of forced him into 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: T/O|pg||
nt|the saint: Should switch as North would have unblocked|pg||
nt|the saint: If he had the J|pg||
nt|jlall: as long as he chooses to duck, playing gotard for QT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: bad contract. unsound|pg||

pc|c2|pg||

nt|rmb1: Looks like anything else is too slow (as the cards lie).|pg||
pc|c8|nt|iceking: thx Mike|pg||
nt|jlall: de wiljes trying to tap the dummy in desperation|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: yes sir:)|pg||
nt|jlall: lee should have put up the king there for sure imo|pg||
nt|jlall: this was a good play by de wiljes though, his best hope|pg||
nt|jlall: he did it very smoothly so lee was taken in|pg||
nt|grypho:  i'm all for maintaining end positions, but how could it cost?|pg||
nt|grypho:  he had entry problems as it was and there was a free chance for a trick AND an entry|pg||
nt|jlall: its a tough problem now|pg||
nt|jlall: he may choose to play a spade off dummy, and put in the 9 if south ducks|pg||
nt|jlall: that would be a winning line|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Wasn't the first at my mind. 2@C often used as force by a auto 2@D answer|pg||
nt|jlall: good recovery|pg||
nt|jlall: now if he still plays north for the DA...|pg||
nt|grypho:  he wont, the @s king was good news|pg||
nt|jlall: brutal hand for lee|pg||
nt|jlall: if north has the trump king and the DA, he has to pitch here|pg||
nt|jlall: he has to consider the lead of a club|pg||
nt|jlall: with JT of diamonds, maybe north would prefer a diamond lead|pg||
nt|jlall: on the other hand if north had the DA and the HK, a spade back might have been fine in this position to set lee|pg||
nt|grypho:  that was just the trick and tempo declarer needed|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|h_karluk:  plase follow BBO VG schedule, kibitzers proudly welcomed, bye for now|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: pairs finesse the @d8 :>|pg||
nt|snorris: west wmight go up with th ace and hope for 3 tricks in @hs in easts hand|pg||

pc|h8|nt|snorris: thx all bye|pg||

nt|iceking: not the best def declarer has 9 top winners now 10 even |pg||
nt|sjicheng: 2C is a forcing free bid normally:)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|iceking: so 12 more imps for USA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d5|nt|jlall: so lee has changed his mind about the diamond suit because north would probably not play the DJ there if that was the layout|pg||
nt|grypho:  7 tricks will be claimed|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|the saint: A wobbly moment here. Needs to guess who has the @C K|pg||
mc|7|nt|rodal f: -2?|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S now|pg||

nt|sjicheng: 9 tricks are ready for collection:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: penalty try by West and North will oblige |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|iceking: or are they playing strong club 1d neg 2d transfer|pg||
nt|rodal f: When * I correct my last sentence, Sr Shi.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: A @S switch is going to down|pg||
nt|garnetts: better for east to double 2@H and let west decide what to do--I think east has too much to pass|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: Looking more like 11D is negative|pg||
nt|iceking: yes strong club it is |pg||
nt|iceking: wonder why S broke the transfer |pg||
nt|jlall: roger is a big believer in leading a heart on this kind of hand, I'm a big believer in leading a spade...you have no entry and a topless suit, it's not that likely a heart will do ...|pg||
nt|jlall: anything|pg||
pc|h3|nt|the saint: Possible swing back here. N/S are climbing without oxygen nw|pg||
nt|the saint: E/w sorry|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is 4@C Gerber?  Otherwise what is 4@D.  EW got too high anyway.|pg||
nt|the saint: Splinter and cue?|pg||
nt|the saint: E/W aren't old enough to use Gerber|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: spl. said E/w|pg||
nt|othered1: That is quite a good playing hand for @H.|pg||
nt|jlall: but if you catch partner with 3 hearts and the opps 2-2 it can work|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|zman1: just needed a 2-2 @S break|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u make N as the main hand. Any safe play?|pg||
nt|sjicheng: yes, that's the price of greedy|pg||
nt|grypho:  we may see a pause now... |pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: but how can west lead?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|zman1: if west has QJ9x@S u cant do anything|pg||
nt|sjicheng: does that means the spade switch is not found?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: It's hard to find, though|pg||
nt|sjicheng: is there any smoking break for U champions?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Yes, now a toilet break|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: still 40 min for this round so I think it's ok :)|pg||
nt|sjicheng: ic:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|iceking: yes maybe its fine|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rmb1: 4@D is "ambitious" opposite a splinter with a minimum and poor trumps|pg||
nt|the saint: Ah, the cuebidding roundabout - once you get on it, you can never get off in time|pg||
nt|rmb1: When Alan became almost old enough to play Gerber he co-invented sliding rainbow gerber where any bid from 4@C+ could be Gerber|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|hackenbush: looks like North took South's pull to 3@h as showing extra shape or strength|pg||
nt|garnetts: North has now made a penalty try--no one has covered themselves in glory here|pg||
nt|garnetts: South made his bed when he opned in third seat--and in fact has a very defensive hand type so should pass 3@Dx|pg||
nt|grypho:  west can lead spades|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|grypho:  i'm a fan of a spade.  i dont think its even a choice|pg||
pc|s8|nt|the saint: No sliding about it.|pg||
nt|grypho:  partner overcalled for a reason|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: TD push them to run faster|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|grypho:  he should have count in the spade suit from the opening lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|othered1: A and @H looks normal to me|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: When Q drop u still are at the line by the safety:)|pg||
nt|zman1: but if west has 4@S its 60% east has a singleton Q@S, J@S, or 9@S|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|the saint: You have to be at least 30 to play Gerber|pg||
nt|rmb1: Sorry, throwing in random extra adjectives for effect :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|grypho:  just 1 down|pg||
nt|grypho:  declarer is making sure that he has the timing correct|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|c3|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|iceking: now  only one down |pg||
pc|c4|nt|iceking: well if east playes clubs|pg||
nt|garnetts: surely not |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|grypho:  i think ace of hearts, 10 of diamondsjust make sure the King of @cs comes next and you are fine|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|garnetts: maximum penalty extracted now--|pg||
nt|garnetts: This type of hand can be a partnerhsip breaker--takes a really good temperment to let it go until after the match |pg||

nt|rmb1: Real IMPs to UK when West recognised the need not to cue bid over 4@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|zman1: so i believe kevin's line is the right way to go|pg||
nt|iceking: 3 more boards USA haveing a great match |pg||
nt|grypho:  but not likely to win any imps for the USA|pg||
nt|grypho:  if poland wins this match by 16 or more IMPS they guarantee themselves GOLD|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|rodal f: Til he lost something. @S was played from N?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|the saint: Took the side turning before the roundabout|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H is a normal spot, and should make much of the time.|pg||
nt|othered1: East doesn't have a totally obvious bid here|pg||
nt|iceking: 3clubs is just 2 agressive |pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|iceking: no east might just pass here |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjr: another interesting hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@D|pg||
nt|sjicheng: will anyone coming with N hand?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: i dont like 4h much |pg||
mb|p|nt|zman1: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: You might try 3N on west's hand.|pg||
nt|iceking: yes it looks better to me also w should try shoot out some game here|pg||
nt|sjicheng: ou... he really came in....|pg||
nt|jlall: 2@C might be a transfer advance showing diamonds|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rodal f: No doubble no troubble|pg||
nt|zman1: -3ish|pg||
nt|garnetts: South should quit now as should everyone else |pg||
nt|grypho:  usa is in a battle for a medal, with silver, bronze, or no medal all possibilities|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rmb1: Rainbow Gerber is documented at the wonderful but moribund poor bridge site http://www.poorbridge.com/?misc=28|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last B was a interesting one for play as safe as u can.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|the saint: That is the old version. Since then we have modified it and added Last Train Gerber and Over the Top Gerber, where both members of the pair can bid Gerber in the same auction.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: East might have tried 3@h, but having @hQx and only 3 diamonds is a turn-off|pg||
nt|grypho:  lucky there was no second double|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|jlall: north has deduced that south has some club length, and stiff K acts well as a stopper -- when they don't know you have stiff K|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: now they have 2 @C stopper|pg||
nt|grypho:  any club but the queen|pg||
nt|garnetts: should cross and lead a @D |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|zman1: there are only 4 layouts that kevin would go wrong|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jlall: this lead is quite poor in my opinion|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: still far from making|pg||
pc|h3|nt|grypho:  this is going to go down everal|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|rmb1: I hope all this work has not modified Gerber to a point where it might be useful :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: Tell|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|rodal f: @C8 can be a hard card for E to find id @D@D@D|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well done |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|the saint: EW can wriggle, but I can't see an endplay here. So it is down to NS to misdefend this|pg||
nt|grypho:  2@s, 2@h, and 2@cs at least and I think 1@d as well|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jlall: declarer is still down as long as no one panicks|pg||
nt|grypho:  only 8 clear tricks though|pg||
nt|jlall: the normal thing to do is lead the @C ace wheny ou hold a side ace. |pg||
nt|jlall: that way you can pick up Kx or Jx on the second round|pg||
nt|grypho:  talk to him about it :)|pg||
nt|jlall: on this auction RHO is a big favorite to have only 2 clubs though, he showed long diamodns and hearts. So if I had to guess I'd say Kx on right is more likely than Kxx and Jx in ...|pg||
nt|jlall: dummy|pg||
nt|jlall: so if gotard plays a spade here|pg||
nt|jlall: fournier must pop and shift to hearts|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|mtvesuvius: Would have worked quite nicely here, and 3@H is certainly an underbid... my main concern with 3N though is when partner has a doubleton spade|pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1: west will get the bad news in trumps (not unexpected when south had 3@S) and will push hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: @C8 will make declarer to cash @H|pg||
nt|rodal f: As now |pg||
nt|sjicheng: but no harm for contract seems|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: but now declarer could not ruff @D and need to lose @D and @S|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|rodal f: But some problems EW, -1?|pg||
nt|grypho:  i'm sure he has count in the spade suit|pg||
nt|jlall: he was not put to the test|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hackenbush: pitching a spade on @HT would have resulted in one more trick. This theme of making declarer unable to finish drawing trump comes up surprisingly often|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jlall: it seems like declarer erred there|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|sjicheng: ops....|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d3|nt|jlall: he could have won the SQ and played a spade at least to put fournier in|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|iceking: yes its a gamble but i do dislike 3h alot|pg||
pc|d5|nt|the saint: Daaaaave is going to have to insert an honour as North when the spade gets played|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|iceking: hand is just 2 good for that bid |pg||

nt|iceking: either 3nt or dbl |pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure it's too good, just inferior to taking the 3N position.|pg||
nt|grypho:  the director pressure may have caused him to play too quickly|pg||
nt|jlall: 3N +1 seems like a good result for germany here|pg||
nt|jlall: could easily see this going down|pg||
nt|hackenbush: players on break|pg||
nt|grypho:  we have a comparison on this board|pg||
nt|grypho:  at the other table it was 4@hX by N|pg||

nt|rodal f: played*|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|iceking: at least in my style i would never think about 3h|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I just wanderd since all have more than 4. H-H have a lot more than 4|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rmb1: Aparrently he did not avoid it|pg||
nt|garnetts: matter of choice between dble and 1NT--I prerfer 1NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: but i can understand it would be fine bid for some others we all dont  think alike |pg||
mb|3H|nt|garnetts: the second double shows a decent hand and probably only 3 spades--not four anyway |pg||
mb|p|nt|zman1: ?|pg||
nt|jlall: 3@C asking for 5 card majors|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sjicheng: N is brave here... will W find Spade lead?|pg||
nt|jlall: 3@D denying them|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: second time east doesnt bid his 6card club suit |pg||
nt|iceking: both time pd had 3card support |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: transfers over the double would work nicely|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: a little thought by Yang before pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: I can't see how a spade can cost. On any layout|pg||
nt|rmb1: Chance missed, 6NT only needs hearts to break|pg||
nt|othered1: Even on h ands like east's, I get lucky when I get my long suit into the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: now a @C from dummy will bring this contract home|pg||
nt|sjicheng: it's still a difficult contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@S from N often used as 3 card in Norway - Holland as now Germany. Just force after 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|grypho:  on a heart lead you have to just play the ace|pg||
nt|grypho:  not enough though|pg||
nt|jlall: yes you go down for sure if you do that|pg||
nt|grypho:  there will be no double here, but unless E leads a @s|pg||
nt|grypho:  the result will be the same|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|the saint: Fortunate for UK. I don't think W got even remotely to grips with his hand next door|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Good precision auction though... to a good spot|pg||
nt|iceking: yes good point Adam everyone should play transfers here|pg||
nt|iceking: you gain so much tempo in playing transfers here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jlall: south cannot read the 6 though, it might be Q876|pg||
nt|grypho:  my fault poor analysis there|pg||
nt|jlall: although if it was Q876, declarer would have AJx opp xx|pg||
nt|jlall: and would likely not duck trick 1|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h4|nt|garnetts: the key to making this appears to be to play ace and another heart early|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jlall: anyways, declarer has a chance|pg||
nt|hackenbush: lose 1 in each suit, and either an extra trump or diamond|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jlall: a small diamond to the king and then the CQ|pg||
nt|grypho:  i dont think there is any hocus pocus or any legitimate chance to make this hand... E will switch to a @d when he gets in b/c he knows N has long spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jlall: yes|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|jlall: very thoughtful play by lee|pg||

nt|rodal f: Roland on again|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Many thanks to Bridge Base Online and our great commentators!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Many thanks to Brdige Base Online and our great commentators!|pg||
nt|jlall: well played by lee|pg||
nt|grypho:  well earned push for the usa there|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|iceking: 54 imps in 16 boards is like 25-3 in vp |pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: This is the last board today|pg||
nt|garnetts: hard to avoid bidding to game and it is awful |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: As for ure nice work Edward and Shi|pg||
mb|4H|nt|iceking: this might end here |pg||
nt|othered1: what a way to bid the east hand, even if it likely shows @S and minor|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: that R/W overcall is... not my choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: Looks like both games are doomed and only double dummy play will keep 3N one off|pg||
nt|grypho:  routine 3nt?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the ouble of the ealier 4@S didn't cost many imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: wow, 3@h -- X seems much better if he is going to take a call|pg||
nt|sjicheng: it's my pleasure:)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the other table went -1|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: streetfight is under the reality|pg||
nt|hackenbush: last board now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|the saint: A chance NS could end up in 4S|pg||
nt|iceking: might as well open 1h instead |pg||
nt|grypho:  does an imp matter?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lmeili: pls come back in 15 mins|pg||
nt|jlall: should be an exciting final 3 matches to this event, it will be very close in the 2nd-5th spots now most likely|pg||
nt|lmeili: next match TaipeiB vs Isreal|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like they will avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|the saint: That won't make either|pg||
nt|the saint: 4@S is not a bad spot|pg||
nt|othered1: If you're going to open north with 1N, it's likely your later judgment won't be optimal, either.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: That one is a bit hard. But look at 4@H|pg||
nt|iceking: 3h is really not  a option here either pass or dbl |pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Many thanks to Bridge Base Onilne for providing a great broadcast!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wander what X by 2@C would have been by NSs system|pg||
nt|sjicheng: pre congrats to german here|pg||
nt|hackenbush: many thanks to my fellow commentators David and Justin|pg||
pc|s5|nt|othered1: Is there a systemic reason north couldn't open 11H?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: not that I know of|pg||
nt|iceking: i doubt that |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I played their system notes with Mitch last week|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and unless there is something I forgot, he could have opened this 1H (1N then semiforcing)... but chose 1N. Once he makes that decision though, needs to stick with it on the second ...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: round of bidding|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|the saint: Short trump hand takes the heart force|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hackenbush: and thanks also to our vugraph operator Phoebe Chang|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sjicheng: willing to play a C doubled contract :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was it lucky diciplin to pass by those 10 good HPs?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|the saint: MAke on any 3-3@S doubleton @SQ, and probably doubleton @S 9 too|pg||
nt|zman1: so another 25 VP's for USA :)|pg||
nt|ritong: the funny part of it is it won t cost any victorypoint, likely|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: In the Dark Ages, many thought it best not to put too many hands into 1N, since it can be tough to make good choices of games, etc.  But that has changed, it seems.|pg||
nt|garnetts: thanks all |pg||
pc|c3|pc|sQ|nt|mtvesuvius: the fact that it isn't good hasn't changed, Ed :)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|iceking: how much do you need for 25 in 16 boards|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|h6|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hackenbush: hope they all tie each other|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c4|nt|ritong: i dunno|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
mc|9|nt|rmb1: I think this is the last poard, thanks to the operator and to Alan for his comments.  Thanks to FISU and BBO for bringing us the coverage |pg||
nt|grypho:  the poles played this hand perfectly at the other table... they drew exactly 2 rounds of trump before playing @ss|pg||
nt|grypho:  thats it from here|pg||
nt|grypho:  if poland wins this match by 16 or more IMPS they guarantee themselves GOLD|pg||
nt|grypho:  you can go over to the other table and continue to watch the end of the match|pg||
