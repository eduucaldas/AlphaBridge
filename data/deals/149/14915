mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|psridhar: E found an enterprising 1H overcall in CR- i like that style|pg||
nt|rv: a few play 1M on 1@c-1@d to show unbal hand|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|rv: usually 9 cards (5m+4M) or rarely 4-4-1-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: N alerts both 1D and 1S, while S alerts none of them|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|rv: I like 1@h O/C as well, don't like to O/C with 4 cards unless with 5m on side and extras|pg||

mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|h_karluk: This is a hand which has transportation problem, with only entry to hand even 2@s not easy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Hamdi. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i believe that's another everyday situation, players sometimes get excited with 20 points|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but there's a solution with such holdings, just double then cue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: your partner will recognize you've the 20+ and pick the suitable level|pg||
nt|the saint: Off centre overcall from East|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: after this fact there's a double dummy solution|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|rv: there is a case for that sequence though showing fit is normally a priority in all GF auctions with slam possibilities|pg||
nt|psridhar: Chinese boys will be on a flier after that 1100 in the CR|pg||
nt|psridhar: problem is after u bid 2nt it will be tough for u to convince East that your spd bids later are not preferences; and W did now have a hand to take control|pg||
nt|psridhar: w did not have a hand for taking control in slam auction i mean|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psridhar: perhaps in a limited system like Precision 2nt will work well|pg||

mb|3H|nt|the saint: Balancing protection from North.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: edit : 3-2 trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry for typo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Flat 4@H EW but will NS find there sac?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|rmb1: 3@H probably invitational, with 2NT sign-off (Lebensohl) not that North is being invited anywhere :)|pg||
nt|the saint: Has walked into a strong hidden West hand. If East can have that hand then West must be an absolute supermax pass|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: A interesting 5@D. At right hand and a @H endplay?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: i said DD solution, the reason is quite obvious, south's 4 hcp could be @d A, in that case your K works |pg||

nt|snorris: Hi|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi there, wlcm|pg||
nt|the saint: If 2N is Leb and X can be weaker, shouldn't S transfer a King?|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|snorris: will top @cs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but then maybe the question is why they did not try slam|pg||
nt|snorris: its a good slam actually|pg||
nt|the saint: I must confess a vested interest. I have known NS since they were 14-15. |pg||
pc|d3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rmb1: Its rather an inaccurate position, if you "transfer a King" the TO double has a large effective range|pg||
nt|the saint: It will have a larger one simply through protecting|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: <my review, my analyse> 2@d huge underbid|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rmb1: I met the "UK" team (asn TD) when they beat Oxford in the final of UK unniversities championship to qualify.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|the saint: North, Graeme, is better known as 'Daaaaaaave' (long story) and South, David, as 'Mr Fish'.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|snorris: think 2@ds is gf and 3nt showing flat hand|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|rodal f: UPS:( Had time to wait for that. Test ure @H!!!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|the saint: In fact, I don't think I have called them Graeme or David for at least 3 years|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|snorris: but west should continue|pg||
nt|rmb1: It was confusing to have two davids in the team when one was referred to Fish and one non-David was referred to a Daaaave|pg||
nt|the saint: Graeme is actually his middle name. His passport says David|pg||
nt|rmb1: There is a debate on BBF on responding to (2M)-P-(P)-X-(P) with CAQxxxx and an outside A: is it too good for 3@C?|pg||
nt|the saint: It looks like Mr Fish can only make two more|pg||
nt|the saint: If he attempts to set up the club he gets forced in spades|pg||
nt|the saint: http://ubridge2010.nsysu.edu.tw/result/round.php?rid=2 - link to latest results|pg||

mb|p|nt|rmb1: UK did not bid on board 1 in OR, so China made 2@D|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: maybe in his area there are such trends, in general consumes space, not a good bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: Is that some kind of 5 card stayman or other method? Can't see any reason for enquiring otherwise|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|snorris: many ways to 10/11 tricks here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if somebody intends to do that in USA sectionals or regionals warning auto comes : dont try to play both sides of the table|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Will E feel the open from N as music at the air?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: As 4@S also was on.|pg||
nt|the saint: Off centre rebid best on that shape. N/S are playing straightforward 2/1|pg||
pc|s5|nt|the saint: This may boil down to guessing the @D queen. Two trumps and a spade loser seem assured|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|snorris: if you take it with ace east just ducks @s next time to keep connected with west|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @sA+ @dA+@dQ|pg||
nt|the saint: It may be difficult to get a complete count on the hand, so it is possible with the trump length being with W that Mr Fish will play E for the diamond length|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|the saint: He can work out W is 4-4-x-x from the spade carding and trump length. I don't think he can work out any more. E is therefore 4-2-x-x so it becomes 7:5 to play East for the @D Q?|pg||
