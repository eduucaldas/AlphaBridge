nt|lestergold: well a tame defence may let this thru|pg||
nt|chick: ouch, and N rescues them|pg||
nt|haans: but ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: East elected to bid NV - not unexpected|pg||

nt|jaheim: NS  won the mixed pair chship this year|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: presumably S cannot open 2H, but a more likely alternative would seem to be 1H. cant argue with success though:)|pg||
nt|chick: Pass by S is also an alternative :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very odd to bid 4H when 3N is virtually sure to go down|pg||
pc|hT|pg||

nt|haans: why 4@H?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: i prefer 1@H to 3|pg||
nt|chick: with 2 aces and 3 hearts, N must know that 3N is doomed.   must be he thought 4@H was makeable|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case why wouldnt he bid it on the porevious round?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surely E was not going to pass 3HX|pg||

pc|c2|nt|lestergold: the play for a ruff iss too slow and north has no entry now to play diamonds so this will make after all|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: certainly true that Pass is an option for S. my comment about 1H was based on the manifest intention of S to do something other than the textbook pass, so i whould have prefaced my ...|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Saur extracted the opponents' trumps. Extracted perhaps better than pull/draw when we have Saur on. Your job to guess his trade|pg||

nt|haans: no score in this match this far|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: certainly there are hands where 3N could make and 4HX be a good save -- mostly they start with a longish minor lacking only the ace plus two heart stoppers and enough spade tricks ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to get to nine. but it is extremely pessimistic to save since there are zillions of hands where 3N fails, maybe by several tricks. so if you don;t try for that kind of good result ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when your preempt creates the opportunity, you ought to stop  preempoting|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|haans: if they make 1NTx they do not get game |pg||
nt|chick: 4@H looks good superficially, but I think difficult to make.  3@S has no chance.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we can see that spade intervention might make this tricky, but the chance for that has gone|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lestergold: technically 4@s is a vbiablem save but who is gonna bid it it could be heading for 800 not agood imnvestment unless you cansee al the cards|pg||

nt|othered1: I personally prefer to use a 2@C rebid after 1@D opening to show a good hand. Gives you room to explore below 3N, at a cost on some natural auctions on lesser hands.|pg||

nt|lestergold: perfectly reasonable as games make on dim finesse|pg||

mb|d|nt|othered1: EW will find 4@S|pg||
mb|r!|nt|lestergold: well this slam wont be missed thats for sure|pg||
nt|othered1: South's double is interesting with that shape and not that many high cards|pg||
nt|haans: odd take out x|pg||
nt|henryb:  Going back to board one, where Lunna mysteriously took 12 tricks in 6N, shouldn't it be possible for big club players to reach 6@c?|pg||
nt|othered1: North has to act h ere and EW may find themselves defending a high @D contract|pg||
nt|haans: big clubs does anything :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: in board 1, Lunna got a diamond in the lead, and South was endplayed in spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose it depends on what you open 2@d on - if you can do it with 5@h, then yes, 2@S natural makes sense |pg||

nt|sharkey: 18-19|pg||
nt|lestergold: whether they bid the grand tho is open to question|pg||
nt|othered1: I might rebid @H on south's hand and I think it wins over the long term.|pg||
nt|haans: with u|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some would use stayman as N|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: hm that will tend to ruole out a heart contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib asked why not open weak 2@H with S hand on Bd 17.  Reason is weak 2 openings 3rd hand NV can be very weak at Expert level, and this was closer to an opening hand.  Also a ...|pg||
nt|sharkey: matter of agreement|pg||

nt|henryb:  Did South really have to act over 1@s Hans?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharkey: 7@C makes|pg||

nt|haans: dirty bridge|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|lestergold: 7N is technically better as well because if clubs broke badly you would have the spade position to fall back on|pg||

nt|haans: would have gone on if after 2nt invite|pg||
nt|haans: bridge not like all time|pg||
nt|haans: old|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The last thing Declarer will do is lead trumps, has to try for a semi-crossruff in the red suits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: important to know what these doubles are. After the redouble, penalty is a live possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: EW not agree about bidding|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|jaheim: tull   kl Q er jo inntak  :(|pg||

nt|othered1: right, south has a quite sound opening|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jaheim: y   think cl is trumph|pg||
nt|sharkey: The @S suit has not been mentioned so a mute point|pg||

nt|sharkey: Resultatsidene er fremdeles ikke oppe og går|pg||
nt|sharkey: In 7 board matches overtricks often significant in score|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@c avaialble as cards liem 3n no good|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@c is what i meant to type|pg||
nt|sharkey: or 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: that too but game unlikely to be bid in either back suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S may actually be a better contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: both comntractsb less than 50% no real reason to justify bidding game here|pg||
nt|henryb:  down 2?????????|pg||
nt|haans: will EW try slam|pg||
nt|haans: none at the table :)|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|3D|nt|haans: three card raise rarer and rarer|pg||
nt|chick: three card raise should be extinct|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: yes -on review think 5@C better|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not like east's double tend to get into troubole when u faikl to bid ur main asset namely clubs here|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rnmalik: Good score in the OR.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: identical auction so far|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb:  West has, imo, a marginal game force.|pg||
nt|haans: OR in 5@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Mike, all|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now will bid|pg||
nt|haans: yes if no agreement|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and they seem set to bid it the same way here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 9 of 14|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But  6@C seems like a leap in the dark|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and as u say it may well go off |pg||
nt|sharkey: @DA lead OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: Made it easy for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: is east that stromngb that a doubolem is needed before showing the clubs/|pg||
nt|haans: many play 2nt as invite or more|pg||
nt|haans: many scandinavians at least|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@D - 3 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: 2 hj med 4 kortstøtte,  ja ja, ikke min melding|pg||
nt|sharkey: if East were ready to bid 4@C on 3@D he shud be able to do the same over 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Martin. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@d South African transfer to 4@S....|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: Hardly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South really playing with fire here. You suspect 3@s would have been passed out|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: combined 24 points doesnt have to bid game|pg||
nt|jaheim: mm   1 nt opening in W|pg||
nt|chick: at least S didn't draw the fatal (to defenders) club lead by bidding them|pg||
nt|chick: now can N find a heart?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Well Leaped|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  but woud you bid less than game opposite partner's opening 1@s?|pg||
nt|chick: booo|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good lead.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: For defence.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sharkey: Vet ikke hvor N fant doblingen i Åpent Rom?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C makes - not 6...|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 4@d is forcing, I approve, otherwise 5@d seems indicated|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S was said to be GF\|pg||
nt|chick: if 2@S is GF....|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sharkey: Fant den her og...|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think South's hand is NTish - wud have tried 3@D to make pd bid 3 NT with @D stopper|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, its frustrating when you find later that you pushed them to a  possibly making game |pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|haans: xy Stayman in Sweden we belive that was invented in Denmark long time ago|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think S should bid 5C over 3D, then he is in position to pass 5D|pg||
nt|henryb:  Suth could not affort Blackwood|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: after the 3@D rebid, most players play 3@S as competitive only - they either double or bid 3@H as a game try|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: 2@D GF|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: as spec pointsn o9ut he has forced himnself to bid 4@c over 3@d by his pard whcih would be overdoing the hand|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcarroll: But on the bidding W may play S for a singleton @S and |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: East got the clue he neede|pg||
nt|haans: i agree 5@D not 4@D best bid|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rnmalik: AK@S and @HK pitching 3@Ds and @D finesse and one @C loser.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ingen overstikk her|pg||

nt|haans: 1@S-1n-3@S-p|pg||
nt|haans: 2n|pg||

nt|mdgraham: South now endplayed|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: best|pg||
pc|d4|nt|henryb:  5@d over 3@d would have implied the stiff club|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: serious defensive error here no need to inform pard about tyhe diamonds at that stage|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, not really endplayed...|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2NT Invitational Values min @S and 4 card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: but needs to lead a @D, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of this session has been when you are dealt a double then double|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why didnt S bid 3 NT?|pg||
nt|haans: invite or not invite that is the question|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H prermpt in my book|pg||
nt|chick: after the X, 2@H shows 8+ in my book :)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d2|nt|haans: AKK is extra in it self|pg||
nt|henryb:  better case at matchpoints|pg||
nt|sharkey: We would all lead @HQ vs 3 NT and set it....|pg||
nt|chick: and I have a known double fit in the majors (assuming a normal takeout double)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 2@D to show both M and some points|pg||

nt|lestergold: both 'wrong'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, the cardinal sin, Mike. Declarer had his contract but went for overtricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Viego will suffer their first defeat |pg||
pc|sA|nt|henryb:  if partner signs off the game may be less than 50%|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: i see contract failed in open but surely playing on clubs declarer should make this|pg||
