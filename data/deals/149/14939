nt|rodal f: Flat 4@H EW but will NS find there sac?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|rmb1: 3@H probably invitational, with 2NT sign-off (Lebensohl) not that North is being invited anywhere :)|pg||
nt|the saint: Has walked into a strong hidden West hand. If East can have that hand then West must be an absolute supermax pass|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: A interesting 5@D. At right hand and a @H endplay?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i said DD solution, the reason is quite obvious, south's 4 hcp could be @d A, in that case your K works |pg||

nt|the saint: I must confess a vested interest. I have known NS since they were 14-15. |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rmb1: Its rather an inaccurate position, if you "transfer a King" the TO double has a large effective range|pg||
nt|the saint: It will have a larger one simply through protecting|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sT|nt|h_karluk: <my review, my analyse> 2@d huge underbid|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe in his area there are such trends, in general consumes space, not a good bid|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|snorris: many ways to 10/11 tricks here|pg||

nt|snorris: and a good one|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: small smoking brake|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: were back:)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: N/S should get to either 4@h or 3NT|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: 3NT seems down on a @c lead 4@h needs a good guess in trumps and even then|pg||
mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: so 7 save should not be bad|pg||
nt|the saint: What can I say? He proved me wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: e-w might get doubled in 5@s on 5@hs!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mirror shape on NS|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rodal f: May we say hello to Zack.|pg||
nt|zman1: 2@C = 10-15 6+@C and XX just shows values|pg||

nt|snorris: wich north will double?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 18/22, weak side have cold slam, on vuln NS supposed to find 7 save, seriously why still i love this game :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|rmb1: North's energetic defence to 3NT here, cost 2IMP on board 3|pg||
mb|4N|nt|zman1: i guess 3 tricks on defense isnt good enough|pg||

mb|p|mb|5H|nt|snorris: bingo e-w|pg||
nt|zman1: thats a choice of leads|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: in my book that's "the trap deal" |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: hard enough to play seeing all the cards - you can pitch a club on a spade (stop the S hand being forced) so comes down to which way you play the @h's|pg||
mb|6S|nt|rodal f: Ure nr 1?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: If more @D?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Communication ain't that well NS|pg||

nt|iceking: but i could be wrong!|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: a fair one|pg||
nt|othered1: Just tying to conjure up a rationale for the double|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|zman1: X again?|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: This 2@H isn't exactly safe, either.|pg||
nt|iceking: now his pd can expect full values 2h here should be rather weakish hand |pg||
nt|iceking: cant |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: no snorris u bid 3@c with no stopper|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: best lead for defence|pg||
nt|snorris: NOW its a must to finesse @h first time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this contract might be an unanimously one at the field|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bridge is teamwork. But all up at the systems pair use. Seems as EW might felt down at a... here. Easyer at home than international|pg||
nt|zman1: i think he will get hearts right in 6@D|pg||

nt|h_karluk: and i think 4@h has a chance after @s lead, say west decides to hold up|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: double @H finesse = 75% start withe the @h8 so as not to block|pg||
