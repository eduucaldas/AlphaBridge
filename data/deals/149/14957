mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|jlall: 2@C is a weak 2|pg||
nt|jlall: just kidding :)|pg||
nt|lmeili: precision|pg||
nt|ritong: the question is can it include a major|pg||
nt|ritong: if so, south has a problem|pg||
nt|lmeili: 6@c or 5@c + 4M|pg||
nt|jlall: since north has purportedly showed an opening bid, I assume south will force to game|pg||
nt|lmeili: probably ll end at 3N|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|jlall: 3@C probably shows a minimum and no 4 card major|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ritong: "i know i should pass..." but i can t|pg||
nt|jlall: minimum can probably include up to 12, and partner could also have 3 hearts, so i don't blame him for bidding|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: certainly... this is an ubermin :)|pg||
nt|jlall: 4@C however i think shunta can pass|pg||
nt|lmeili: their 2@c opening shows 6@c|pg||
nt|lmeili: nothing about M|pg||
nt|jlall: now it's a misfit and 3N and 4@H are out of the game and there are marginal values...time to bail|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|cappjr:  4h better than 4c|pg||
nt|jlall: yep, he did well|pg||
nt|jlall: i was worried he would bid 5@C, I bet kalita would have cracked that|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yeah, this has reasonable play if the K@C is onside|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
nt|jlall: uh oh|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: hmm|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cappjr:  oh noo|pg||
nt|jlall: at least it timed out in a way that kalita was never doubling...he was just happy they weren't in hearts :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: well, escaped the double it seems... but I cannot see why he would be bidding 5@c unless he thought 4@h was a slam try w/@c?|pg||
nt|cappjr:  only 50 a trick....cheap enough|pg||
nt|jlall: yes, presumably there was some kind of misunderstanding here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: TYP|pg||

pc|s3|nt|vugraphzjr: EW leading T/9 shows 0 or 2 higher cards|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: This is a hand which has transportation problem, with only entry to hand even 2@s not easy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Hamdi. |pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|h_karluk: i believe that's another everyday situation, players sometimes get excited with 20 points|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but there's a solution with such holdings, just double then cue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: your partner will recognize you've the 20+ and pick the suitable level|pg||
nt|the saint: Off centre overcall from East|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d7|nt|h_karluk: after this fact there's a double dummy solution|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|the saint: Too many cards look well placed to defeat this. And the diamond blockage is preventing the defence from setting up a force|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|d4|pg||

nt|ritong: no sweat here  bulletproof 3no|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|jlall: yes, a nice breather|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 14-16 NT, transfer, etc etc, nice relaxing board for them|pg||
nt|jlall: some danger of going down if they find an inspired spade lead |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|cappjr:  may winn an imp on c lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|jlall: i imagine he'll overtake and work on hearts|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jlall: it might be a better play to put in the SQ catering to the DQ on and the SJ off, but this play caters to KJ of spades on... all of this shows why playing on diamonds first may have ...|pg||
nt|jlall: been better (so they can't play a spade through immediately), but it's all for overtricks|pg||
nt|ritong: amusing to observe that a @h leaves him with only 8 tops|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|the saint: 2@S two suited? And do we know the agreed range? |pg||
nt|Walddk6: Welcome Alan and Robin|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi |pg||
mb|2H|nt|the saint: Balancing protection from North.|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: when you see trumps 3-1 you can go with another round trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : 3-2 trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry for typo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Flat 4@H EW but will NS find there sac?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: 3@H probably invitational, with 2NT sign-off (Lebensohl) not that North is being invited anywhere :)|pg||
nt|the saint: Has walked into a strong hidden West hand. If East can have that hand then West must be an absolute supermax pass|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: A interesting 5@D. At right hand and a @H endplay?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: i said DD solution, the reason is quite obvious, south's 4 hcp could be @d A, in that case your K works |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Snorri Sveinsson|pg||
nt|snorris: Hi|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: Hi there, wlcm|pg||
nt|the saint: If 2N is Leb and X can be weaker, shouldn't S transfer a King?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|snorris: 12 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|snorris: will top @cs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but then maybe the question is why they did not try slam|pg||
nt|snorris: its a good slam actually|pg||
nt|the saint: I must confess a vested interest. I have known NS since they were 14-15. |pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|rmb1: Its rather an inaccurate position, if you "transfer a King" the TO double has a large effective range|pg||
nt|the saint: It will have a larger one simply through protecting|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h9|nt|h_karluk: <my review, my analyse> 2@d huge underbid|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|rmb1: I met the "UK" team (asn TD) when they beat Oxford in the final of UK unniversities championship to qualify.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|the saint: North, Graeme, is better known as 'Daaaaaaave' (long story) and South, David, as 'Mr Fish'.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|snorris: think 2@ds is gf and 3nt showing flat hand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: UPS:( Had time to wait for that. Test ure @H!!!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|the saint: In fact, I don't think I have called them Graeme or David for at least 3 years|pg||
pc|dT|nt|snorris: but west should continue|pg||
nt|rmb1: It was confusing to have two davids in the team when one was referred to Fish and one non-David was referred to a Daaaave|pg||
nt|the saint: Graeme is actually his middle name. His passport says David|pg||
nt|rmb1: There is a debate on BBF on responding to (2M)-P-(P)-X-(P) with CAQxxxx and an outside A: is it too good for 3@C?|pg||
nt|the saint: It looks like Mr Fish can only make two more|pg||
nt|the saint: If he attempts to set up the club he gets forced in spades|pg||
nt|the saint: http://ubridge2010.nsysu.edu.tw/result/round.php?rid=2 - link to latest results|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

nt|jlall: if kalita had the club 9 he would have played it at trick 1 so probably shouldnt get that one wrong|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|jlall: 1@C strong and artificial|pg||
nt|lmeili: where is Roland? his slam comes|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 16+ if unbalanced, 17+ if Balanced|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jlall: not sure what the double showed|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: and 3@s a max in that range, which he has|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: 1 imp at stake, then|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jlall: assuming west showed some kind of 2 suiter, I imagine declarer will play him to have short diamonds after he shows up with 2 spades which means getting @Ds right|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@c might be only @hs, though|pg||
nt|ritong: double*|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jlall: true|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|snorris: this looks like 4@ss|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: footnote : i guess EW 1N is not 15-17 balanced|pg||

mb|1S|nt|kdr_fm: hi all|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: gotcha thanks|pg||
nt|snorris: schaltz with a wild 3@hs|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Karel and welcome. Nice to see u:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rmb1: UK did not bid on board 1 in OR, so China made 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Another slam for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: maybe in his area there are such trends, in general consumes space, not a good bid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|the saint: Is that some kind of 5 card stayman or other method? Can't see any reason for enquiring otherwise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|snorris: many ways to 10/11 tricks here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if somebody intends to do that in USA sectionals or regionals warning auto comes : dont try to play both sides of the table|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: looks like a good stop @d ruff avail plus 3 aces|pg||
mb|p|pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|rmb1: Perhaps he would have the option of finding/showing a small doubleton and playing 4-3 H|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzjr: Unlegal first lead, TD|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: NS use kickback RKC 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: 4@s show 0/3, 4N ask @dQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Hard to see any road to bid 4@H EW. Any ideas Hamdi and Karel?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzjr: the first round is @C5-@C8-@CK-@CA|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Now the contract is 5@D by West|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: 6@d show @dQ and no other Ks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|the saint: If South had covered, the 6,5 and 4 of clubs were eventually going to be promoted|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|ritong: poles next room made it short|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ritong: mm..|pg||
nt|ritong: playing with fire|pg||
nt|jlall: someone points out that slam can be made on a club/diamond squeeze after setting up a spade trick and cashing the majors. that is true, but it is not a normal line|pg||
nt|jlall: please remember that the players cannot see all the hands like us!|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: I think 4N is enough with Shunta's hand over 3N|pg||
nt|jlall: I think the @CJ shift when in with spades would break up the squeeze also|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yeah, I believe it does.|pg||
nt|jlall: it's not clear what this bidding means|pg||
nt|ritong: til now, south has an unlimited hand, i guess|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|jlall: maybe 4@C was meant as gerber (I hope not!), or maybe he chose to raise on Hx|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|ritong: this has PLAY|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: hmm, would be a nice accident|pg||

mb|p|nt|jlall: i dont think 6@H can make |pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|ritong: so, extremely likely a 13 imps board|pg||
nt|ritong: but declarer has a making line|pg||
nt|jlall: can make it only triple dummy|pg||

nt|rodal f: Just wondered abough the NT levels EW. By 2/1 it often use to be 15-17     18-19     20-21 If so E hade 20 for 2NT a open|pg||
nt|sjicheng: yeah, he may concern about the weak C suit|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rodal f: A good save we precume:)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: personally when both vul at 2nd seat i do not support 3 level preempts when there is an unpassed partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: nope - will end play S at some point but I cant see 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzjr: about the screen: the procedure is not followed properly|pg||
nt|rodal f: If a @H comes?|pg||
nt|rodal f: -1|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|pelu: i almost "neder2 X with 5 card major|pg||
nt|pelu: "never"|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: and 5@D is making under any first lead|pg||
nt|iceking: some italian pairs play this way |pg||
nt|rodal f: By last board and this it seems to be (15) - 18|pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: oh yes, that's the general tendency|pg||
nt|iceking: in teams iam not sure w should try to look for major fit its so often correct just stay in 3nt with 30hcp and 2 bal hands|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any for @HQ from N?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|the saint: All the cards lying well for NS. This could and should be IMPs back. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: China A E-W 2NT = m's 5-5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzph: draw 1 club 1 spade play @h j back|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: He wont be unhappy atm though if the @cQ is with south Qxx 3NT cold|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|the saint: Blockage in the spade pips may make it tricky to extract the max though|pg||
nt|sjicheng: tks howard, that means china also play multi 2D as i guess:)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|snorris: souths decision to not bid @ds turned out well|pg||

nt|rodal f: If a @S is played early enough it came be some fun. Else -1. Or more by some funny try's|pg||
nt|snorris: turns to @hs|pg||
nt|snorris: hx in north is a chance|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: I think he should have finessed the @h 1st no real rush to play clubs (unless 3@d was a 6 card suit ... vul ??)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still puzzle hand for me|pg||
nt|snorris: agree with the @h finesse first time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: most likely i would try to win the match at another board|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well he knows N 7/4 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: should hvae played @S before second c|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: have*|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe sometimes we abandon to think split honors idea mostly works|pg||
nt|rmb1: East needed to cover @S10 to create the blockage|pg||
nt|the saint: When in with the spades, Mr Fish now needs to find the right red suit switch. Daaaaave can now show suit pref to diamonds.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Bit hard to see the @C layout so not unnormal try|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however things not predictable there|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: no rush playing second @c|pg||
nt|rodal f: @HA and @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: @h 10 back |pg||

pc|d3|nt|rodal f: @S and finto|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: so should have played a low spade|pg||

nt|jlall: but still, his side has a max of 31 HCP and no fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: it is a good slam though|pg||
nt|jlall: it's better than 50 % because you might pick up AJ doubleton with north, or stiff ace/stiff J|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|snorris: well they sh bid game|pg||
nt|the saint: Although as people have suggested, North can make things clearer by discouraging hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Info from the turney: http://www.bridgefestival.dk/|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last B.|pg||

nt|sjicheng: another slam going hand here|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|zman1: X shows GF values with no clear bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why bid 3 when EW have the majors? OK, Can be right some few times|pg||
nt|iceking: 2h ugly bid |pg||
nt|iceking: but only 2 options |pg||
nt|cappjr:  especially after his last h o'call|pg||
nt|iceking: pass is not a option in my book|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|zman1: X again?|pg||
nt|rodal f: X for cards?|pg||
nt|zman1: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: maybe 4@c to show @c and @h|pg||
nt|rodal f: But will he do?|pg||
nt|cappjr:  me neither|pg||
mb|4N|nt|snorris: 3@cs ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Only one killing lead against 6@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Snorri, you would better whisper, he might hear you:)|pg||
nt|zman1: does 4@C show @C and @H or @C and @D or @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This 2@H isn't exactly safe, either.|pg||
nt|iceking: now his pd can expect full values 2h here should be rather weakish hand |pg||
nt|iceking: cant |pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: no snorris u bid 3@c with no stopper|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: best lead for defence|pg||
nt|snorris: NOW its a must to finesse @h first time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this contract might be an unanimously one at the field|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bridge is teamwork. But all up at the systems pair use. Seems as EW might felt down at a... here. Easyer at home than international|pg||
nt|zman1: i think he will get hearts right in 6@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: 4@c puppet 4@d, 4@h was a CoG bid|pg||
nt|cappjr:  missing a decent 3 nt|pg||
nt|iceking: 1nt p 3nt and 9 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: Note the problem set for EW by south's opening on a good 4-card @S suit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cappjr:  i was plus 600|pg||
pc|c7|nt|snorris: with a little in @cs I bid 3 @cs|pg||
nt|snorris: no stopper I bid something else|pg||
nt|pelu: is KQ "a little" :):)|pg||
nt|snorris: only one trick with no help therefore 3@cs|pg||
nt|snorris: then 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sjicheng: en!....|pg||
nt|rodal f: The normal lead against 3NT as 6@H?|pg||
nt|sjicheng: anyway they didn't go 6@H. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: need to guess in @S or @CAQ, not a great slam I think|pg||
nt|sjicheng: i thnk so. at least it's a good choice for me|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|pelu: oh and the u exp pd with Jxx to bid 3NT????|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i think 4@h has a chance after @s lead, say west decides to hold up|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: double @H finesse = 75% start withe the @h8 so as not to block|pg||
nt|zman1: its hard bidding 6@D knowing partner has 2@S|pg||
nt|iceking: well w just made a poor bid i just cant pass is an optionn here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|snorris: he heard you:)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|snorris: pd bids 3 nt with something in @cs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: maybe 3@h instead of 3N still an option|pg||
nt|snorris: he knows I have "something" :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: 3@h would be my bid:) after 2n|pg||
nt|snorris: mine too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i admit uncontested 1h,2d>2h,2sp,2n shld be main body|pg||

nt|jlall: going for blood|pg||
nt|jlall: its a nice shot because 1N X is not game, if they make 180 its not a big deal|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, it can hardly cost a bunch and could be great fun|pg||
nt|sybarra: and scare pard half to dearh|pg||
nt|jlall: and on a good day you pick the right lead, your spades are behind RHO, and partner has a maximum and you get a ncie penalty|pg||
nt|sybarra: *death|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: not sure shunta is feeling ok right now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jlall: i think sikora has a rather easy @HQ lead, but maybe I'm biased by looking at all the hands!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: this is why you play transfers over X here|pg||
nt|ritong: might wonder " why on earth did i open my big mouth"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: so that you don't have the option to bid 1N!|pg||
nt|jlall: adam, i don't think you need to play transfers to stop yourself from making undisciplined 1N bids :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mtvesuvius: it's just a safeguard :)|pg||
nt|ritong: heh|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jlall: a popular treatment these days is also to play XX shows 2 spades and some values, that is a much safer way to get into the auction and compete. 1N can be pretty dangerous if you ...|pg||
nt|jlall: have nowhere to run and partner might overcall on a 9 count at the 1 level|pg||

nt|jlall: now we have an interesting position|pg||
nt|jlall: dummy can be stopped from having 2 entries|pg||
nt|jlall: and even if it did, declarer would be blocked out of his hand|pg||
nt|ritong: and already got squeezed of a potential good card|pg||
nt|jlall: right|pg||
nt|jlall: so any passive defense will work|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|jlall: sikora put in the queen which gives declarer 3 club tricks, but stops a spade trick. no matter which way he went was fine|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|snorris: twice as good to play for the drop of the Queen|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|the saint: The difficulty for S is that he can't see the weak diamond holding in the East hand. But he doesn't have any entries to the hearts so continuing them may be futile|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now the pay comes|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1 trick lost by opening the @H|pg||

nt|sjicheng: should be |pg||
nt|rodal f: Not that easy for S to count up N|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Yes, when S discard @CA, North should know S has no loser|pg||
nt|sjicheng: but i think HA is a reasonable discard here. it's hard for N to totally have no C|pg||
nt|rodal f: If NS use UDCA it should be clear by the @H|pg||
nt|sjicheng: and discard of HA will guide N to play C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: so North should return @C immediately|pg||

nt|jlall: suit preference on the run of the 3 hearts with the 9, signalling for the SK|pg||
nt|jlall: last hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|1H!|mb|p!|mb|1S!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|jlall: pass of 1@H probably showed 0-4|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jlall: I guess double of 1@S would have been penalty for NS, maybe some ambiguity because 1@S was probably pass or correct|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: shunta has a great hand for clubs, so he started with a cuebid. Now I predict he'll bid 3@H since 4@H might still be the top spot if partner has 3 of those|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|jlall: I'm not sure what towner will do, maybe punt with 3@S. He has a maximum hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: now if I were shunta I would just bid 5@C and be done with it|pg||
mb|6C|nt|jlall: hmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: I guess he figures hes on a heart finesse|pg||
nt|jlall: and it will be on given the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: not that unreasonable actually...but I don't think partner has guaranteed the club king yet|pg||
nt|ritong: the contract has a lot of play|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jlall: yes, he has caught a perfect hand for his bidding|pg||
nt|jlall: unfortunately, I think he knows too much and will end up hooking the club|pg||
nt|jlall: the heart*|pg||
nt|jlall: west is known to be 5-5 given that he not only made a 2 suited overcall, but later bid 3D. Also kalita is marked with 3-3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|jlall: i guess hes 1 trick short if RHO has Qxxx of hearts though?|pg||
nt|jlall: since he doesnt have entries to hook twice|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|jlall: if he has to ruff a heart that gives him 5 clubs, 1 ruff, 4 hearts, and 1 diamond|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|jlall: so on that basis, he might be forced to play for Qx of hearts!|pg||
