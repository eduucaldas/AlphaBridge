mb|p|nt|lestergold: and to u too Carl|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a tame defence may let this thru|pg||
nt|chick: ouch, and N rescues them|pg||
nt|haans: but ...|pg||
nt|jaheim: hi all|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: East elected to bid NV - not unexpected|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i must admit that as south i would chance a double here i like to earn imps|pg||
nt|jaheim: NS  won the mixed pair chship this year|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and adopting the trend towards 5 rather than 6 card suit|pg||
nt|jaheim: lots of toppairs playing 2 @D as a weak muli   and 2 @H @S as a serious weak 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: presumably S cannot open 2H, but a more likely alternative would seem to be 1H. cant argue with success though:)|pg||
nt|chick: Pass by S is also an alternative :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very odd to bid 4H when 3N is virtually sure to go down|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: I see 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|lestergold: nom heart ruff but an immediate diamond swirtch and force will be uncomfortabelm fro declarer|pg||

nt|april7: very aggressive bid by E|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 @D   prob   1 major|pg||

nt|Walddk2: What do you lead, guys? A heart or a spade?|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the last hand the heart finesse was a 50% shot. Playing to drop @HK-x-x or @HK-x in either hand must be less than that because you are playing for the king to be in the hand ...|pg||

nt|smoller: This will be complicate4d|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|brolucius: You sacrifice a king (maybe) to dislodge an ace that will be a vital entry for declarer. Names after some war-ship that was sacrificed to block the entry to a harbour.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  nice effort by west|pg||
nt|smoller: how to score the tird diamond trick?|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: certainly there are hands where 3N could make and 4HX be a good save -- mostly they start with a longish minor lacking only the ace plus two heart stoppers and enough spade tricks ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to get to nine. but it is extremely pessimistic to save since there are zillions of hands where 3N fails, maybe by several tricks. so if you don;t try for that kind of good result ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when your preempt creates the opportunity, you ought to stop  preempoting|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: vi ligger litt foran :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - problem was S was on lead - likely to favor declarer|pg||
nt|haans: we will not get abid fron West|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sorry, missed a few rounds as I had to get the phone|pg||
nt|april7: might end up in 4@S by NS or 5@H by EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or will we?|pg||
nt|haans: assume X is penalty|pg||
nt|haans: weak openings make it harder for opps to bid their cards|pg||

nt|haans: if they make 1NTx they do not get game |pg||
nt|chick: 4@H looks good superficially, but I think difficult to make.  3@S has no chance.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we can see that spade intervention might make this tricky, but the chance for that has gone|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: technically 4@s is a vbiablem save but who is gonna bid it it could be heading for 800 not agood imnvestment unless you cansee al the cards|pg||

pc|s5|nt|jaheim: K of cl and a claim?|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club at its best|pg||
nt|baardolav: this will make +2 or something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2@d is a Multi, South can respond 2@h (pass/correct) or 2@S (pass/3@h). His hearts are good, could easily have bid 2@s   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: South with long hearts assumes his partner has spades :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@s is natural not forcing in weak multi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can play it that way.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: headed for game not making perhaps|pg||
nt|chick: this can make 4@H but not 5@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lesser evil and pass by E.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Pas probably limits the damage as any EW contract would be pretty expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @S slam can make, but unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: an aggressive lead which on this layout costs a trick|pg||
pc|sT|nt|haans: i have stopped bidding 4@H 30 years ago|pg||
nt|haans: support x better than delayed support|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would bid something - choice between 4n and 5H not easy but i would fera missing slam to much not to make a try|pg||
nt|sharkey: @CJ Jan Arne - and claim :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally prefer to use a 2@C rebid after 1@D opening to show a good hand. Gives you room to explore below 3N, at a cost on some natural auctions on lesser hands.|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Would you x NT after first x by W and pass by E?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W showed the other two suits by x.|pg||

mb|2H|nt|othered1: EW will find 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well this slam wont be missed thats for sure|pg||

nt|haans: odd take out x|pg||
nt|henryb:  Going back to board one, where Lunna mysteriously took 12 tricks in 6N, shouldn't it be possible for big club players to reach 6@c?|pg||
nt|othered1: North has to act h ere and EW may find themselves defending a high @D contract|pg||
nt|haans: big clubs does anything :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: in board 1, Lunna got a diamond in the lead, and South was endplayed in spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose it depends on what you open 2@d on - if you can do it with 5@h, then yes, 2@S natural makes sense |pg||

nt|marlowepi: some would use stayman as N|pg||
nt|april7: should S open and N passes then E will come in in @H and then  perhaps 1,2,3 NT???|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: hm that will tend to ruole out a heart contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib asked why not open weak 2@H with S hand on Bd 17.  Reason is weak 2 openings 3rd hand NV can be very weak at Expert level, and this was closer to an opening hand.  Also a ...|pg||

nt|mdgraham: dbl looks like DONT  - six card suit somewhere. Bit thin if it is|pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: I don't think W should pass 1@D, has 5 P!!! and then 4@H would have been reached making 5 if starts with @S finesse but 10 tricks for sure|pg||

nt|sharkey: dont think they've been at the rubber bridge table too often :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i gain a lot more than i lose by doubling|pg||
nt|lestergold: last hand was a stand on the chair double|pg||
nt|henryb:  Not the best result for E-W, as 4@s is easy|pg||
nt|haans: agree :)|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H might make, but I sure wouldn't be happy in it|pg||
nt|chick: of course I'm famous for detesting moysians :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: :) - dont think 4@H makes either - tapped in @S |pg||
nt|haans: but IMP so who cares :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in a short match overtricks sometimes matter|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: it was 8 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: but went quite fast in the end, so don't know exactly how|pg||
nt|haans: no good bid for E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1D seems fine to me|pg||
nt|chick: again, too good for a preempt|pg||
nt|haans: "Not for person below 100"|pg||
nt|mcarroll: now making all his small trumps with the crossruff - contract making|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H p  p  X  p 4@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sound reasonable to me|pg||
nt|april7: on @H lead then 5,on @D ace lead only 4,but bidding might develop differently|pg||
nt|chick: would you jump to game with N's hand over 3@H P P X?  partner is under pressure and doesn't have to have 20 pts for a X|pg||
nt|april7: you are right, but even over 3@S S will bid 4, but thats a different story|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|april7: N might reopen with a X, then S might reach qa @H contract at 3 level, but EW might compete to 3 @S|pg||
nt|jaheim: i   wouldnt|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jaheim: and board 22|pg||
nt|lestergold: jsut swop around theK@d and K@c situation on last hand and u have forgone 800|pg||

nt|lestergold: lucky last habnd was only a mere 300|pg||
nt|haans: kib: ihj: Koppang - Olsen are both seniors|pg||
nt|april7: now perhaps 2@H nonforcing?|pg||

mb|d|nt|haans: do like 2@S|pg||
nt|jaheim: right|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: form theirmn gross overbidding|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 1NT = 8-12, at least 4-4 in @h and @s|pg||
nt|jaheim: weak with majors, if i dont remember wrong|pg||
nt|haans: for first time ever(?) can we see that they have no sceens|pg||
nt|haans: Lunna right no opening|pg||

mb|2S|nt|sharkey: Hva gjør V?|pg||
nt|jaheim: spar eller ru tro   |pg||

nt|sharkey: 6@D mulig?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Plutselig har Ø et "monster" - så lenge pd ikke har meldt av 3 korts farge|pg||
nt|jaheim: men på 2 trinnet,   3 ru er 5 kort imo|pg||
nt|jaheim: D  =  3 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Surely 4@H is the bid|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sharkey: Spørs hvilke krav meldinger de har til rådighet - hvis 2 NT krav viser farge|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N migh be best on this on NS cards alone, but @H more likely to be found.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: not 2|pg||
nt|chick: moot now as W elected to treat his hand as an opening bid|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|sharkey: Good bid by Kvangraven|pg||
nt|lestergold: no lead to beat|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N|pg||
nt|sharkey: S unsure about @C suit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south may be tempted to play this in hearts|pg||
nt|jaheim: or lucky, finding p with 10 of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: if so three rounds of spades with the 9@h ruffing in would not be nice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S seems makeable on trump coup|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: may be even 6...|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would prefer 1@s, but ..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi henry:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
nt|haans: Henry :)|pg||
nt|haans: no alert of 2nt?|pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s would seem to have the advantage that it leaves more room, and your hand is better than a weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was bid as good-bad, but W is not sure. TD at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was not alerted|pg||
nt|haans: can be costly|pg||
nt|henryb:  on either side?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2NT is usually a high card raise in hearts although he does not really have that|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Known as Truscott in Europe, Jordan in North America|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i am not a fan of the 4@s bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: No. Only three spades and defensively orientated.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pitiful:  i would have taken my chance on defence|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S does not guarantee five spades for most players, since a responsive double is often played as denying four cards in the other major.|pg||

nt|baardolav: yeah... |pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: not provide him with a route map to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Rite - and discrading !K at the end position and keeping 3 x @C may have resulted in a set|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last board of this segment, interesting hands as reflected by the respective scores, no unwanted swings.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Or 6NT? with 12 tops?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A bit surprising nobody found the red card after 4@S in OR|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: as all others try for game|pg||
nt|sharkey: S bid 2@H OR|pg||
nt|henryb:  I remind kibitzers that while I deeply appreciate comments I will not respond to anyone who does not have the courtesy to put their full names in their profile|pg||
nt|april7: switchto @H is best|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chick: as would I|pg||

nt|sharkey: 2NT Invitational Values min @S and 4 card support|pg||
nt|april7: but cross ruff is already open|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jaheim: but needs to lead a @D, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of this session has been when you are dealt a double then double|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why didnt S bid 3 NT?|pg||
nt|haans: invite or not invite that is the question|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H prermpt in my book|pg||
nt|chick: after the X, 2@H shows 8+ in my book :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: last board in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2 matches to go|pg||
nt|mcarroll: After I predicted a flat board on 6 I hesitate to say anything here - But............|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1   i think   ,  Liv Marit|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: yes, you're right jaheim|pg||
nt|april7: I think losing at most 2 @S and 2 aces|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: one more match|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|haans: AKK is extra in it self|pg||
nt|henryb:  better case at matchpoints|pg||
nt|sharkey: We would all lead @HQ vs 3 NT and set it....|pg||
nt|chick: and I have a known double fit in the majors (assuming a normal takeout double)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 2@D to show both M and some points|pg||
nt|haans: yep good for 2@D instead of @H bid|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|haans: im on Volls side|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Depends what 2NT showed|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: there has been a fair amountg of no trump avoidance too|pg||
nt|sharkey: May work out ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: im susrprised that 3n failed in open room|pg||

nt|lestergold: both 'wrong'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, the cardinal sin, Mike. Declarer had his contract but went for overtricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Viego will suffer their first defeat |pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  if partner signs off the game may be less than 50%|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: i see contract failed in open but surely playing on clubs declarer should make this|pg||
nt|haans: you need a good 50% to bid non vul games|pg||
nt|haans: better bidding than OR|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: play for split honours in clubs shoul lose a heart a club and a diamond at most|pg||
