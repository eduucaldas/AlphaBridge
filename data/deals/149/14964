mb|p|nt|vugraphzjr: EW leading T/9 shows 0 or 2 higher cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: This is a hand which has transportation problem, with only entry to hand even 2@s not easy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Hamdi. |pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: i believe that's another everyday situation, players sometimes get excited with 20 points|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but there's a solution with such holdings, just double then cue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: your partner will recognize you've the 20+ and pick the suitable level|pg||
nt|the saint: Off centre overcall from East|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: after this fact there's a double dummy solution|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|the saint: Too many cards look well placed to defeat this. And the diamond blockage is preventing the defence from setting up a force|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lmeili: @cAK beats 6@s|pg||
nt|ritong: promoting @s9|pg||
nt|chmitty: may be ... or may be not|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|chmitty: trump reduction ?|pg||
nt|ritong: needs three ruffs, plus being right sided at the end|pg||
nt|chmitty: let's see : Ace King @c ... then Ace @h and @h ruff|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chmitty: the @s that show the wrong distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: yep lack of an entry|pg||
nt|ritong: three ruffs, ok, but wrong side of the table after the process|pg||
nt|chmitty: exactly .. I'm suggested a "deep finesse" by playing @d to the 10 but does not give you an extra entry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: for the record, in these "oslo finesse" situations, very often defense can counter play inserting the honor in concern|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|chmitty: I'm surprised with the 3@h bid ... do they play it forcing ?|pg||
nt|lmeili: no, 3@h is terrible bid|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|chmitty: depends on their convention card ... may be it's forcing in their system|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|the saint: 2@S two suited? And do we know the agreed range? |pg||
nt|Walddk6: Welcome Alan and Robin|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi |pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: Balancing protection from North.|pg||
nt|jlall: NS almost cold for 3N, but the red 9s that EW have are enough to stop it|pg||
nt|hackenbush:  sitting EW are Roger Lee and Jeremy Fournier from USA|pg||
mb|3S|nt|h_karluk: when you see trumps 3-1 you can go with another round trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : 3-2 trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry for typo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Flat 4@H EW but will NS find there sac?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|rmb1: 3@H probably invitational, with 2NT sign-off (Lebensohl) not that North is being invited anywhere :)|pg||
nt|the saint: Has walked into a strong hidden West hand. If East can have that hand then West must be an absolute supermax pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A interesting 5@D. At right hand and a @H endplay?|pg||
nt|jlall: west decided to give up before any doubling started|pg||
mb|6H|nt|h_karluk: i said DD solution, the reason is quite obvious, south's 4 hcp could be @d A, in that case your K works |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Snorri Sveinsson|pg||
nt|snorris: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Hi there, wlcm|pg||
nt|the saint: If 2N is Leb and X can be weaker, shouldn't S transfer a King?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hackenbush:  NS from Germany are Thomas Gotard and Jan-Hendrik De Wiljes|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|jlall: best defense here is to pull the trumps and exit with a spade|pg||
pc|cK|nt|snorris: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|jlall: so that fournier cant take any heart tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|snorris: will top @cs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but then maybe the question is why they did not try slam|pg||
nt|snorris: its a good slam actually|pg||
nt|the saint: I must confess a vested interest. I have known NS since they were 14-15. |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|rmb1: Its rather an inaccurate position, if you "transfer a King" the TO double has a large effective range|pg||
nt|the saint: It will have a larger one simply through protecting|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: <my review, my analyse> 2@d huge underbid|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|s5|nt|rmb1: I met the "UK" team (asn TD) when they beat Oxford in the final of UK unniversities championship to qualify.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
mc|11|nt|the saint: North, Graeme, is better known as 'Daaaaaaave' (long story) and South, David, as 'Mr Fish'.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Will be tough to catch Poland, 32 VPs ahead of second with three matches to go|pg||
nt|ritong: israel currently fighting with two or three countries to hit the third step on the podium|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|ronpa: Poland seems to win and deserves it. they dominated the event since it started|pg||
nt|chmitty: Yep Poland has a very strong team ... some of them already in the open team|pg||

nt|hackenbush: unfortunate that they reached their 7-0 instead of 7-1 slam|pg||
mb|1N|nt|snorris: this looks like 4@ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: footnote : i guess EW 1N is not 15-17 balanced|pg||
nt|rodal f: An other nice layout, but bid it.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Karel from Ireland|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: hi all|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|hackenbush:  Both have represented the US numerous times in junior international tournaments.|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: they play weak nt|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in a natural sys there would be some remedy : ie uncontested 1N>3@s (mild slam invite at diamonds)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi karel|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|h_karluk: gotcha thanks|pg||
nt|snorris: schaltz with a wild 3@hs|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Karel and welcome. Nice to see u:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: UK did not bid on board 1 in OR, so China made 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Another slam for NS|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jlall: hackenbush is also a member of the USA A team :)|pg||
nt|jlall: kibitzers pointing out that 3N would make on the last hand if the defense chose to lead a spade rather than a heart, that is true|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: maybe in his area there are such trends, in general consumes space, not a good bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: Is that some kind of 5 card stayman or other method? Can't see any reason for enquiring otherwise|pg||
nt|jlall: this hand is not cold, I think declarer will play to ruff a heart and ruff a diamond (if necessary) in the dummy|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jlall: then he would be at risk of losing 2 trump tricks to K9xx, but it's possible he can score his small trumps in his hand via ruffing also|pg||
pc|s6|nt|snorris: many ways to 10/11 tricks here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if somebody intends to do that in USA sectionals or regionals warning auto comes : dont try to play both sides of the table|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: looks like a good stop @d ruff avail plus 3 aces|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hackenbush:  The open room started on board 15-16, so that by the time they start playing board 1 and on, there will be score comparisons.|pg||
nt|jlall: so it wouldn't surprise me to see declarer never touch trumps until the end|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rmb1: Perhaps he would have the option of finding/showing a small doubleton and playing 4-3 H|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzjr: Unlegal first lead, TD|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzjr: NS use kickback RKC 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: 4@s show 0/3, 4N ask @dQ|pg||
nt|jlall: now something like winning the DA, ace of hearts heart ruff, diamond to the king and a diamond seems likely. Winning the DA and leading one towards the king later in case lee has 5 ...|pg||
nt|jlall: diamonds, that way Fournier would only have the option of ruffing air|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: Hard to see any road to bid 4@H EW. Any ideas Hamdi and Karel?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzjr: the first round is @C5-@C8-@CK-@CA|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Now the contract is 5@D by West|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzjr: 6@d show @dQ and no other Ks|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|the saint: If South had covered, the 6,5 and 4 of clubs were eventually going to be promoted|pg||
nt|the saint: May concede an overtrick of they get too active. |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|snorris: and 12 tricks|pg||
nt|hackenbush: it's often right to lead trumps on a preference auction, though leading from @cAK might be safer to get a look at dummy|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sT|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|rmb1: Or more than one|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: sound line|pg||
nt|jlall: playing the SQ first seems risky...if they won and came back a spade you may have 2 diamond losers 1 spade loser and 1 heart loser|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|rodal f: And right u was:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jlall: he can survive this line though by simply cashing a diamond, playing ace of clubs ruff a club and exiting a diamond|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|jlall: they get 2 diamonds, but have to give him the 2 spades at the end|pg||
nt|hackenbush: Operator, West is Gilad Ofir, and East is Ory Assaraf from Israel|pg||

nt|h_karluk: 1st trick @sA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: rest well known|pg||
nt|snorris: might be better to take it with the jack and hope for no repet of @s lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in case 4-4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Howard and specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: EW is playing a strong club system, west can have on 4@hs and about 9 hcps|pg||
nt|jlall: 3N looks like the best game|pg||
nt|jlall: and fournier is angling towards that with 2N|pg||
nt|jlall: I predict a 3N bid from lee, he has spade help and very slow values|pg||
nt|jlall: of course, no game looks very good on this layout, it's tough to stop with 25 HCP|pg||
nt|hackenbush: open room started on board 15 and 16 so that by the time they get to board 1, there will be score comparisons|pg||
pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: how about 5/3|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT E/W - be hard now to get there|pg||
nt|jlall: lee might be considering bidding 3S as a choice of games|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: Will E feel the open from N as music at the air?|pg||
nt|jlall: a bit scientific|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: As 4@S also was on.|pg||
nt|the saint: Off centre rebid best on that shape. N/S are playing straightforward 2/1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will try to do my best. AND SPECS. Come with inputs:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: maybe that's why east is hesitate to compete|pg||
nt|jlall: perhaps he's worried fournier only has K9x of spades or so|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|the saint: This may boil down to guessing the @D queen. Two trumps and a spade loser seem assured|pg||
nt|jlall: now after the "don't lead spades" double, I think lee will certainly bid 3N|pg||
nt|jlall: the only thing that argues for hearts about his hand is that he has good trumps, everything else is very notrumpy|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: however, a @D give more challenge to 3N, declarer has only 1 @S trick|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|snorris: if you take it with ace east just ducks @s next time to keep connected with west|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @sA+ @dA+@dQ|pg||
nt|the saint: It may be difficult to get a complete count on the hand, so it is possible with the trump length being with W that Mr Fish will play E for the diamond length|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jlall: the other thing is that he wants to play it from his side probably, but fournier would XX 3@S with the ace|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kevin Wilson|pg||
nt|jlall: Hi Kevin|pg||
nt|grypho:  Hi|pg||
pc|dA|pc|hK|nt|snorris: now east must play @s|pg||
nt|snorris: well only 8 tricks wven if he plays @h|pg||
nt|snorris: then west MUST play @s|pg||
nt|rmb1: As Alan suggest 4@S was off on board 2, so a huge 15IMP to China-A|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|jlall: close to making on a partial strip now, but south would get a club ruff|pg||
nt|grypho:  if clubs were 3-3 a partial elimination might work, but not here|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|jlall: if he pulls 2 diamonds and allt he trumps, north can just play a spade|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|grypho:  any hocus pocus you can see J?|pg||
nt|jlall: nope|pg||
nt|jlall: not even double dummy|pg||
nt|jlall: single dummy he's just going to hope the club jack or queen is onside im sure|pg||
nt|grypho:  yes, it seems like all roads lead to 1 down unless N makes a significant mistake and cashes the @cAce|pg||

nt|jlall: do you think he should have bid 3N kevin? or was he right to try and rightside it with all of his kings and spade queen?|pg||
nt|jlall: he probably got to the better game (1 club honor onside) so it couldnt have been too bad|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kdr_fm: I open pretty light and even 4441 I'd still pass N - but worked very well here keeping E/W out of a cold game|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|grypho:  I think he should have bid 3nt because there was no reason to expect an extra trick in hearts.  I take partner's 2NT bid seriously|pg||

nt|jlall: both games are really bad anyways hehe|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d9|pc|c7|nt|snorris: so -1...|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
mc|11|nt|the saint: He can work out W is 4-4-x-x from the spade carding and trump length. I don't think he can work out any more. E is therefore 4-2-x-x so it becomes 7:5 to play East for the @D Q?|pg||

nt|zman1: 2@C = 10-15 6+@C and XX just shows values|pg||
nt|hackenbush: @dA is the indicated lead against gambling 3nt, but here it will block the suit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|snorris: a forcing pass from south?|pg||

nt|grypho:  wow... 5 of either minor cold EW and 4 of either major cold NS|pg||
nt|jlall: well 4@H is down on spade ruffs|pg||
mb|d|nt|jlall: its a rare hand where you have to save red vs white |pg||
nt|grypho:  true sorry, @h easy to find from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 18/22, weak side have cold slam, on vuln NS supposed to find 7 save, seriously why still i love this game :)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: in my book that's "the trap deal" |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: hard enough to play seeing all the cards - you can pitch a club on a spade (stop the S hand being forced) so comes down to which way you play the @h's|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: Ure nr 1?:)|pg||
nt|grypho:  this play will be quick|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: If more @D?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Communication ain't that well NS|pg||
pc|hT|nt|zman1: he has to find the @H shift |pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree|pg||
nt|zman1: now kevin will go for @D instead of @C|pg||
nt|jlall: interestingly if north had not opened, he might have later bid michaels and south would then know about the double fit|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hackenbush: last chance|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jlall: oh, but west would respond 1@S|pg||

nt|rodal f: No good road to find outstanding honors egher, but a direct @H for K was my last choice.|pg||
nt|the saint: Another aggressive X from N. Too much for my taste even with the perfect shape|pg||
nt|hackenbush: now can pitch a spade on diamond, and use diamond as entry to take spade finesse|pg||

mb|p|nt|snorris: a fair one|pg||
nt|othered1: Just tying to conjure up a rationale for the double|pg||
nt|jlall: this auction is a little different, since EW did not guarantee a fit|pg||
nt|jlall: i think gotard did very well to balance|pg||
nt|jlall: some might make a hypermodern X of 1@H with the south hand but I don't think that's their style|pg||
pc|h8|nt|h_karluk: prev deal 7@d would pay 800|pg||
nt|zman1: wonder if owen will underlead the K@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: Often OK to watch the way to the max|pg||
nt|hackenbush: partner is allowed to have a pretty good hand for balancing 2@h still, since double and new suit by balancing hand shows about same strength as the same action direct seat|pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: in practice i doubt many WGM would imagine that save|pg||
nt|iceking: so this will go few down |pg||
pc|hA|nt|snorris: Askgaard wants @h lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzjr: yes, 3@s shd be 7 reese points|pg||
nt|jlall: if the club hook is on you might be able to pitch your heart and make on 3-1 spades, or you might just play for 2-2 spades|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
nt|rodal f: @HK as lead I was waiting for. Then NS could get 5 tricks by a @D10 returne in at @CQ.|pg||

pc|s9|pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|rmb1: Losing to @HQ was a six loser, so -1 now|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jlall: I don't think I would have balanced with Gotard's hand, he did very well and probably saved 6 imps|pg||
nt|jlall: these small hands add up|pg||
nt|grypho:  but you would have doubled with south?|pg||
nt|jlall: i would have|pg||
nt|jlall: i guess that shows my general philosophy to get in early so you don't have to worry about it later hehe|pg||
nt|grypho:  i'm not that modern, i much prefer shortness in the bid suit |pg||
nt|jlall: 2@S is not so risky though, lee won't have 4 spades to bid 1N and fournier has 6 hearts so he's unlikely to have 4 spades...at least if you're wrong you don't often get doubled|pg||
nt|jlall: so it was a calculated bid by gotard|pg||
nt|grypho:  what about rebidding 2@c instead of 2@h?|pg||
nt|jlall: not a fan with hearts as good as KQJT9x, but in general yes i like it|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|kdr_fm: @s best chance now hoping N played @Sj from @SKJxxx orginally|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jlall: suits that are 1 loser for sure opposite a stiff are special to me and should  be bid forever. bidding clubs can work out sometimes in helping partner evaluate though|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ronpa: no reason, there are 2 entries to take the 2 needed finnesses|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Responder usually has clubs on this auction, so a club lead is out of the question|pg||
nt|ronpa: yes, no real chance to see A@C lead|pg||
nt|chmitty: 99 % of players would lead a small @s|pg||
nt|ronpa: he might choose 10@S (or 9) or even a @H|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ritong: assaraf having a look at opp's cc|pg||
nt|ritong: regarding leads|pg||
nt|ronpa: now declarer has lots of chances|pg||
nt|ronpa: even if he plays the J he can pin the 7|pg||
nt|chmitty: yep ... he can insert the J and play the 8 next|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He realises that he must take the first 9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No chance in diamonds, the pips are not good enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: declarer is asking questions|pg||
nt|chmitty: This is for this type of lead, which I produce twice a day, that I hate this game :)|pg||
nt|ronpa: he's trying to figure what they lead from H109xx|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The 10 is not conclusive I suspect. Can be from 109 with or without the queen|pg||
nt|ritong: whatever his decision, will be right in the end|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: hm|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ronpa: if he plays low first trick it might end up bad|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ronpa: now depends on their cc, if the lead denies an honour or not|pg||
nt|ronpa: if 10 denies he will make it, if not might end up 3 down|pg||
nt|chmitty: moment of truth in 30 seconds now :)|pg||
nt|ronpa: maybe he'll try low @D hoping defence wont open @C's|pg||

nt|chmitty: 2 USd he makes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I only use diet cokes|pg||
nt|ronpa: those are more expensive roland :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: so ... that's worth 1 diet coke ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not in London|pg||
nt|ronpa: he wants to finnesse and has the 7@S in his head|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 33 cl  30p|pg||
nt|chmitty: wouah ... nice country|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: he is asking questions again|pg||
nt|ronpa: He wont learn anything new. has to go with his feeling|pg||
nt|chmitty: the lead took a long time to come. That could be if West had 4@s and 5@c but now he knows it's not the case|pg||
nt|ronpa: playing the A@S also reduces the 100's if u are wrong but he might try the finnesse|pg||
nt|chmitty: so why would West hesitate so much to lead from Q109x @s ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I still remember when I paid 29 franc for a 20 cl bottle in a bar in Nice. About 100 years ago|pg||
nt|ronpa: Good question, maybe holding AKxx or KQxx clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe the card to lead|pg||
nt|chmitty: could be Ron, indeed|pg||
nt|ritong: either 10 or small|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It lasted all night :)|pg||
nt|ronpa: or maybe deciding if to lead 10@S or low one like henry said|pg||

mb|p|nt|snorris: awery nice 4 in major here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant as final contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the best spot at 4@CEW?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. as*|pg||
nt|jlall: NS have 11 spades but a lot of losers, and also just enough defense to stop a slam|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rmb1: North not tempted by his fine shape and 3 card support :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: if S take the @C-finess in trick 3/4 and the King is in W - he risk down 3-4|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: E/W may bid to 5@C ... only 2 points but 1417|pg||
nt|the saint: Not yet|pg||
nt|cappjr:  we hold a trials and the winners go|pg||
nt|iceking: ok so also for junior bridge|pg||
nt|cappjr:  sometimes we have a 2nd team selected from the other competitors|pg||
nt|iceking: S will bal here withdbl i assume|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cappjr:  yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tks Howard:)|pg||
nt|grypho:  S in a mature decision chooses not to raise to 4@s|pg||
nt|jlall: gotard has chosen 1@S because he's in third seat, causes a little confusion and maybe makes them misguess the play, and is also a bit safer than 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: dont like the rdbl - as now you've lost the @s suit unless u really brave and bisd 4@s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@c invites double|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard for N to see what's right.|pg||
nt|the saint: Dislike 1N. |pg||
nt|zman1: kevin might bid 2N here if W passes|pg||
nt|jlall: yes I agree, he didn't even bid 3@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|the saint: Great way to miss cold heart games|pg||
nt|the saint: And there is North bang on cue|pg||
nt|rmb1: You clearly understand these players well|pg||
nt|rodal f: U ment the @SJ for 7 if K was at the hook? Nooppee. Odds was to good to pass 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: insted of -2...if @ds are not behaving|pg||
nt|pelu: no problem Andreas - u are doing a fine job|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as South who won't double 5c?|pg||
nt|snorris: now north will bid 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: 4@h great spot to be in|pg||
nt|babs59: well you've know them AGES|pg||
nt|babs59: SORRY|pg||
nt|cappjr:  n will smile|pg||
nt|iceking: and east 1nt or?|pg||
nt|cappjr:  not me |pg||
nt|cappjr:  an ace and a trump|pg||
nt|othered1: my partner plays 11HX|pg||
nt|cappjr:  glp|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi Snorri:)|pg||
nt|the saint: Yup. And you can see how old it has made me|pg||
nt|the saint: Now East is second guessing because he didn't bid his hand properly in the first place|pg||
nt|rmb1: Ugly 1NT has left East bidding his major at 3 level|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@HX|pg||
nt|iceking: i dont think east should sit here most of the time when they try to nail you at 1 level they gottit!|pg||
nt|cappjr:  whos to say it can get better|pg||
nt|cappjr:  1 level is cheap|pg||
nt|iceking: anyway east has though one trump and a ace so could expect 200-500 |pg||
nt|jlall: lee's double is responsive, fourniers 3@S shows a strong hand|pg||
nt|jlall: lee is now thinking his hand is super-duper awesome, not expecting his partner to also have a stiff spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: Houmøller keeping it a live...will e-w strike?|pg||
nt|snorris: and bid 4+|pg||
nt|snorris: ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: never give up Andreas, this is your 2nd day and we believe you'll be successful|pg||
nt|pelu: no be - he is :)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: whoa now thats alot a bidding vul with 2 points between an opening bid and a redouble|pg||
nt|snorris: Hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: re|pg||
nt|snorris: south 4@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: yes|pg||
nt|hackenbush: spade lead now probably|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jlall: so he has chosen to bid 4@S to show such a hand|pg||
nt|jlall: now the textbook bid with fourniers shape would be 4N to see what partners longest suit is|pg||
nt|jlall: hes not really thinking slam with this hand opposite a passed hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jlall: I guess he is :)|pg||
nt|grypho:  I like 3@s from Fournier, but he will have to put the brakes on quick.  The @sK is useless|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sjicheng: it's difficult for any games here|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|the saint: North's 2@S bid is a fine example of what is known in English U20 circles as a 'Chucker Raise'. Backing in later with support, trying either to go for 800 or collect 670. |pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good morning to David Carlisle|pg||
nt|hackenbush: @sJ seems like an error, the finesse will still be there the next round|pg||
mc|7|nt|h_karluk: as i predicted 4@s quite normal contract in such auctions and 5@c nine out of ten would receive double|pg||
nt|snorris: and north 5@ds?|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: yes|pg||
nt|the saint: Named for junior James 'Chucker' Thrower who was a master of it|pg||
nt|rmb1: A manouvre we are capable of (however non-U20)|pg||
nt|grypho:  Lee can't have more then @cA, @dAQ and still be a passed hand|pg||
pg||

nt|ritong: personnally i like 3NT= sorry buddy, bad hand here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: in order to keep the four level if responder really has a monster|pg||
nt|chmitty: I play : 3NT a mild slam try, 4@s really bad ... a matter of discussion with your favorite partner|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So you play reverse "serious 3NT"|pg||
nt|ritong: kind of|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's better than the original serious 3NT, and even Rodwell agrees|pg||
nt|chmitty: good company :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ritong: well, several ways, all of them consistent|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ritong: but needs a serious debate with your reg pard|pg||
nt|ritong: because these hands are EXPENSIVE (homer nods approvingly)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: fair without doubled|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s auto off one|pg||
nt|snorris: ok|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but that doesn't mean bad contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just wondered abough the NT levels EW. By 2/1 it often use to be 15-17     18-19     20-21 If so E hade 20 for 2NT a open|pg||
nt|sjicheng: yeah, he may concern about the weak C suit|pg||
nt|jlall: wow, he started with the @DA? I guess he did not agree with my assessment!|pg||
nt|hackenbush: hi David and Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A good save we precume:)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3@d or 4@d ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for me a puzzle|pg||
nt|cappjr:  oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: They gave away trump control next door before the club could be established for a spade pitch|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|garnetts: Whatever 2@D is it is a good time to bid it:)|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|snorris: is Schaltz to good for 2@hs?|pg||
nt|jlall: if south had 5 spades and a stiff diamond, he would certainly bid more than 2@S. If north had 7 spades it is extremely unlikely he would bid 1S then pass, and even if he had south ...|pg||
nt|jlall: might well bid 3S with 4 spades and a stiff anyways|pg||
nt|hackenbush: most players would open North hand nowadays|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good practical bid by South |pg||
mb|3H!|nt|rodal f: What happend now by EWs system?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: say west has same hand and shape in addition with @hQ, would you x as passed hand or still overcall a spade?:)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|snorris: this is not going to win|pg||
nt|h_karluk: personally when both vul at 2nd seat i do not support 3 level preempts when there is an unpassed partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: nope - will end play S at some point but I cant see 9 tricks|pg||
nt|grypho:  seemed 100% to play @d the other way, but we've moved on|pg||
nt|grypho:  alot of exciting and challenging boards here|pg||
nt|jlall: normally with 4 spades you bid 4@S on this auction over the 2nd double|pg||
nt|jlall: however with the heart king, 4 small spades, and some defensive values and a min gotard chose to pass, seems quite reasonable to me|pg||
nt|grypho:  He's downgrading the Kx of @hs|pg||
nt|grypho:  not a fun decision|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjr: about the screen: the procedure is not followed properly|pg||
nt|rodal f: If a @H comes?|pg||
nt|rodal f: -1|pg||
nt|iceking: could 2d be bal 19-20 and 3club stayman |pg||
nt|garnetts: I would have almsot certainly always opened as North--we are passed the Alvin Roth theory nowadays too|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: i almost "neder2 X with 5 card major|pg||
nt|pelu: "never"|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: and 5@D is making under any first lead|pg||
nt|iceking: some italian pairs play this way |pg||
nt|rodal f: By last board and this it seems to be (15) - 18|pg||
nt|jlall: 4@S looks like its down and 4@H is down at least 1 and probably more, so I'd say he made a good choice|pg||
nt|grypho:  I bid 4@s though because I do have 4@s, and patner may well have a stiff @c on this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: oh yes, that's the general tendency|pg||
nt|iceking: in teams iam not sure w should try to look for major fit its so often correct just stay in 3nt with 30hcp and 2 bal hands|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: Any for @HQ from N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: All the cards lying well for NS. This could and should be IMPs back. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: China A E-W 2NT = m's 5-5|pg||
nt|grypho:  stiff @h of course|pg||
nt|jlall: 4@S did make in the other room, but by south so they led a diamond|pg||
nt|jlall: played by north east would lead a heart|pg||
nt|jlall: and west would have a very obvious club ace shift|pg||
nt|jlall: north opened 1C, and west has 6 and dummy has 4|pg||
nt|grypho:  good detective work|pg||
nt|jlall: so in this room im fairly confident 4@S would be set|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzph: draw 1 club 1 spade play @h j back|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: He wont be unhappy atm though if the @cQ is with south Qxx 3NT cold|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|the saint: Blockage in the spade pips may make it tricky to extract the max though|pg||
nt|sjicheng: tks howard, that means china also play multi 2D as i guess:)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Hi Howard|pg||
pc|d5|nt|snorris: souths decision to not bid @ds turned out well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems next year we will see Andreas at the field, chill bro :)|pg||
nt|hackenbush: if North is unpassed hand, 4@h might have been the key bid to reaching a close slam|pg||
nt|Walddk3: http://ubridge2010.nsysu.edu.tw/result/round.php?rid=10  for results and standings after round 10|pg||
nt|garnetts: take the ace now or lose it |pg||

pc|hA|nt|jlall: wow|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kdr_fm: I could hear tat DOH from here :>|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: If a @S is played early enough it came be some fun. Else -1. Or more by some funny try's|pg||
nt|snorris: turns to @hs|pg||
nt|snorris: hx in north is a chance|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: I think he should have finessed the @h 1st no real rush to play clubs (unless 3@d was a 6 card suit ... vul ??)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still puzzle hand for me|pg||
nt|snorris: agree with the @h finesse first time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: most likely i would try to win the match at another board|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well he knows N 7/4 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: should hvae played @S before second c|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: have*|pg||
nt|h_karluk: gotcha|pg||
nt|rodal f: As cards lay ure right Andreas.|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: even if i could not see it i would try to think this way|pg||
nt|othered1: agree|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|snorris: got a @d lead|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|kdr_fm: so 1@D, 2@c, 3@S, 2@H = 8 best he can i think|pg||
nt|jlall: north was just happy to cash out|pg||
nt|jlall: from his point of view if east has a club, clubs are 3-3 and they can be set up|pg||
nt|jlall: normal defense but on this layout a disaster|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: maybe sometimes we abandon to think split honors idea mostly works|pg||
nt|rmb1: East needed to cover @S10 to create the blockage|pg||
nt|the saint: When in with the spades, Mr Fish now needs to find the right red suit switch. Daaaaave can now show suit pref to diamonds.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|grypho:  must be right to win this in hand and play @d|pg||
nt|jlall: on best defense, declarer would have to guess to smother the @DT for -2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rodal f: Bit hard to see the @C layout so not unnormal try|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however things not predictable there|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: no rush playing second @c|pg||
nt|rodal f: @HA and @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: @h 10 back |pg||
nt|snorris: lacks one trick still|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: complete count now - S didnt return a @D doesnt have one so 1174 N|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|hackenbush: pitch one club on @hK and ruff one|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|garnetts: It is hard to guess why this is taking so long to play |pg||
pc|sT|nt|snorris: and 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sjicheng: entryless to table....|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rmb1: 7 from 87 was too subtle for South|pg||
nt|zman1: E may have ATx...since N/S do not lead attitude in the middle of the hand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|the saint: That is poor from South. He can see 652 in dummy, 3 in his own hand and declarer played the 4|pg||
nt|jlall: but this is very normal|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: @S and finto|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: so should have played a low spade|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer draw the big picture 99% <he is supposed a good listener of the auction> but the question is was North honest with his 3@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: finito|pg||
nt|hackenbush: now squeeze in the red suits after ruffing a heart|pg||
nt|garnetts: only line now is to ruff a heart and hope the Q comes dwon when you overtake the @D or that a squeeze operates|pg||
nt|hackenbush: might have been better to rise @sA last trick after seeing @s8|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|garnetts: yes agreed --should have done that ---having taken so long should have worked it out lol|pg||

nt|snorris: sure does|pg||
nt|snorris: 1@h-2@d, 2@h-?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@d - depends yr sys|pg||
nt|snorris: or a sneaky 2@ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: here we go|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be|pg||
nt|pelu: why do u want them to be in 4@H -1?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not personal, seems quite normal contract|pg||
nt|pelu: but 25 HCP - so prob game|pg||
nt|snorris: this will end in 3NT e-w|pg||
nt|rodal f: So was a phantom|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: China E-W 2D is multi, including 20-21 BAL|pg||
mb|1N|nt|garnetts: troublesome 4@H contract here|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: well they sh bid game|pg||
nt|the saint: Although as people have suggested, North can make things clearer by discouraging hearts|pg||
nt|iceking: 3rd hand 1sp maybe|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|rodal f: Info from the turney: http://www.bridgefestival.dk/|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last B.|pg||
nt|iceking: w now has to choose from 1nt or 2h |pg||
nt|cappjr:  1 nt|pg||
nt|cappjr:  auto|pg||
nt|iceking: yes i would bid 1nt everyday here |pg||
nt|sjicheng: another slam going hand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|zman1: X shows GF values with no clear bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why bid 3 when EW have the majors? OK, Can be right some few times|pg||
nt|iceking: 2h ugly bid |pg||
nt|iceking: but only 2 options |pg||
nt|cappjr:  especially after his last h o'call|pg||
nt|iceking: pass is not a option in my book|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jlall: probably 1@D shows hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|zman1: X again?|pg||
nt|rodal f: X for cards?|pg||
nt|zman1: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: maybe 4@c to show @c and @h|pg||
nt|rodal f: But will he do?|pg||
nt|cappjr:  me neither|pg||
nt|jlall: and 2@D is an artificial GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 3@cs ?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rodal f: Only one killing lead against 6@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Snorri, you would better whisper, he might hear you:)|pg||
nt|zman1: does 4@C show @C and @H or @C and @D or @H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|othered1: This 2@H isn't exactly safe, either.|pg||
nt|iceking: now his pd can expect full values 2h here should be rather weakish hand |pg||
nt|iceking: cant |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: no snorris u bid 3@c with no stopper|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: best lead for defence|pg||
nt|snorris: NOW its a must to finesse @h first time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this contract might be an unanimously one at the field|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bridge is teamwork. But all up at the systems pair use. Seems as EW might felt down at a... here. Easyer at home than international|pg||
nt|zman1: i think he will get hearts right in 6@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: 4@c puppet 4@d, 4@h was a CoG bid|pg||
nt|cappjr:  missing a decent 3 nt|pg||
nt|iceking: 1nt p 3nt and 9 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: Note the problem set for EW by south's opening on a good 4-card @S suit|pg||
mb|4N|nt|cappjr:  i was plus 600|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: with a little in @cs I bid 3 @cs|pg||
nt|snorris: no stopper I bid something else|pg||
nt|pelu: is KQ "a little" :):)|pg||
nt|snorris: only one trick with no help therefore 3@cs|pg||
nt|snorris: then 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sjicheng: en!....|pg||
nt|rodal f: The normal lead against 3NT as 6@H?|pg||
nt|sjicheng: anyway they didn't go 6@H. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: need to guess in @S or @CAQ, not a great slam I think|pg||
nt|sjicheng: i thnk so. at least it's a good choice for me|pg||
mb|5C|nt|pelu: oh and the u exp pd with Jxx to bid 3NT????|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i think 4@h has a chance after @s lead, say west decides to hold up|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: double @H finesse = 75% start withe the @h8 so as not to block|pg||
nt|zman1: its hard bidding 6@D knowing partner has 2@S|pg||
nt|iceking: well w just made a poor bid i just cant pass is an optionn here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think this should make --not any more |pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: he heard you:)|pg||
nt|jlall: not sure what the bidding means, but the play should be easy|pg||
mb|5H|nt|snorris: pd bids 3 nt with something in @cs|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: maybe 3@h instead of 3N still an option|pg||
nt|snorris: he knows I have "something" :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: 3@h would be my bid:) after 2n|pg||
nt|snorris: mine too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i admit uncontested 1h,2d>2h,2sp,2n shld be main body|pg||
nt|pelu: back to the play - 3Nt can be maded now!|pg||
nt|snorris: Michael led @d??|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway. A healty contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: 1@D = 0-6 hcp or 7-11 hcp unbal w/o 4M or 13+ bal w/o 4M|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: This shows a lack of consistency --last hand they did not mention the five card minor after a 2NT overcall and here south did|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pelu: yes 6,5 min ago :)|pg||
nt|snorris: hehe|pg||
nt|h_karluk: guys. lol|pg||
nt|hackenbush: south has not shown a slam try, 3@d just exploring the best game|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: and some style even could try 2N at 4th seat|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe South should have sttled for 2NT or 3NT--clear that North figured South's actions were a slam try |pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: let s play @sK and no defense left|pg||
nt|cappjr:  you just cant pass your strong nt hands|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jlall: thanks howard|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cappjr:  miss many games that way|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
pc|cT|nt|snorris: Ottos lottos gainig some imps perhaps|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|garnetts: Certainly a good case can be made for playing it that way--most regulat partnerships have an agreement here|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|grypho:  claim?|pg||
nt|hackenbush: 3@d might lead to a good 5-2 game with a black suit wide open, so I think 4nt is overbid after S didn't cue over 3@h|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|rodal f: So might a reed suit lead was the best? Still a normal lead is from a black suiter|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|iceking: w as we all see is just playing this hand poorly|pg||
nt|iceking: and first 7 imps for Germany 3nt whent 4 down in open room|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: i won't get surprised even if there would be 41h+1 on the field|pg||
nt|iceking: on club lead 3nt is hard |pg||
pc|h5|nt|iceking: need very good timing making it|pg||
nt|cappjr:  against me they led a spade|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *4@h+1|pg||
nt|garnetts: You may be right Howard--but only if they agreed it was just exploring the best game and carried no slam overtones|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: and here we are close to  NT +1|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|garnetts: North had other ideas |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|snorris: whats  NT peter?|pg||

pc|s2|pc|d6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|d8|pg||

nt|h_karluk: sure, takk|pg||

nt|rodal f: What if W was 0@S and 5@H?|pg||
nt|zman1: alright =|pg||
nt|grypho:  i hate 3nt b/c it handcuffs partner... maybe 2n was non-forcing but otherwise i would have bid it|pg||
nt|jlall: 6@D will not make, 6@S would make on a likely heart lead|pg||
nt|jlall: yes 2N must be non forcing for him to jump|pg||
pc|c5|nt|snorris: 4@hs+1 as you predicted Hamid|pg||
nt|snorris: in open room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: dammit buddy, what a field :) c'est la vie|pg||
nt|zman1: 7-4 open 1N? :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: sry :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then ew would have a dilemma|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3@h is alot even with the @CA sing adding 3 for singlton and another for the 5th diamond !!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do S have many botles energi drink by his side Howard?:)|pg||
nt|sjicheng: yes, with his 7hcp and with 2 Js |pg||
nt|grypho:  i think @s are out now and a diamond contract will be reached|pg||
nt|jlall: even 5@D is a pretty dicey contract, though safe on this layout|pg||
nt|jlall: south is probably thinking he has a pretty good hand for a diamond slam |pg||
nt|jlall: maybe he will cuebid 5@C|pg||
pc|hT|nt|snorris: on last board|pg||
nt|rodal f: NP:) U've done well.|pg||
nt|grypho:  it depends on if he knows its a 4-4 fit or it could be better|pg||
nt|jlall: yeah im not sure what the range of his 1N bid was, and what the implications are after that|pg||
nt|jlall: maybe this is 4N natural|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: Agree. Time for a system to change|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: hmmm|pg||
pc|c4|nt|snorris: might be best to play for @d king and hope @s are bad..|pg||
nt|pelu: if he go wrong, then defense will set up the @h-suit|pg||
pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: remember previous boards @d was Kx at neck|pg||
nt|snorris: then 3nt wins and 4@ss not|pg||
pc|c9|nt|garnetts: That 5@C maybe a suit preference signal for spades |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@c<X> i don't know pass is even close, what i know 1@d a very rare preference|pg||
nt|grypho:  i would've led the @s7.  if you want declarer to think @ss aren't breaking the 7 is harder to read,,, but its splitting hairs really|pg||
pc|cT|nt|snorris: looks strange..Andreas?|pg||
nt|jlall: yes the key point is definitely don't lead hearts|pg||
nt|jlall: partner didn't raise, and RHO bid 1N 3N 4N...hes got hearts locked up haha|pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: i think 4@s also makeable|pg||
nt|zman1: do u play west 7510 or 7420 or 6520?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s3|pg||
nt|hackenbush: board 7 declarer in open room did better not putting up @sJ on trick 1, and had more info in the endgame to guess right in spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzph: said 11 tricks:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Max 200 (if Xed) to pay for EW by a normal ........|pg||
nt|jlall: maybe w/r but w/w that would be insane|pg||
nt|grypho:  can you see who's thinking|pg||
nt|jlall: uh oh|pg||
nt|jlall: it looks like south has taken this as exclusion keycard|pg||
nt|jlall: since he has shown 2 without the queen|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: Take ure unlucky 500 or try to be smart?|pg||
nt|sjicheng: ou....it becomes more interesting...|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: could be a fdriendly joke :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not Bergen?|pg||
mb|p|nt|zman1: no...7-10ish with 4@S|pg||
nt|iceking: north should play spade ten here and return heart |pg||
nt|iceking: after east bidding he seldom has 4hearts |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzph: wrong hand for @d singel|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *friendly|pg||
nt|grypho:  good call|pg||
nt|jlall: im not really sure what happened, but if I had to guess south responded to exclusion keycard|pg||
nt|jlall: thats what 4@S would be if you don't play kickback|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hackenbush: what would you lead here? 4-card unbid major is nice, but often Axxx is the suit declarer needs to set up|pg||
nt|garnetts: hard for East to play low |pg||
nt|garnetts: a number of lines of play all of which get enough tricks to make ---two @D finesses for example of the simple spade finesse |pg||
pc|h2|nt|rmb1: Need to lead @H for -1|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: scrap home in this|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: it was but now i dont now how man|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: how many tricksØ|pg||
nt|vugraphzph: *!|pg||
nt|hackenbush: @hAT now marked with west|pg||
nt|garnetts: the deep @D finesse is the easiest path because no entry is needed |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|snorris: 4@hs -1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: Andreas you can edit when you have free time|pg||
nt|the saint: Double dummy this is always off. If this is ducked, South can switch to a diamond|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not so difficult :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|the saint: Now needs to switch.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|iceking: as it was east has 10 top tricks this time so he isnt ducking spades|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: this could be off one|pg||
nt|jlall: playing kickback I would take 4@S as keycard, and 4N as exclusion for spades|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|snorris: did west know south didnt have 6 @cs?|pg||
nt|rmb1: To clarify: the @H lead was not too difficult, switching to @D after two @Hs was harder|pg||
nt|jlall: I have no idea if NS play kicback though|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|snorris: 2 imps to the ministriet|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
nt|sjicheng: a good defence by insist on trumps|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kdr_fm: declarer has a decsion in spades.  @sT8 play J @SQ8 play to K|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sjicheng: so far|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|snorris: twice as good to play for the drop of the Queen|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|the saint: The difficulty for S is that he can't see the weak diamond holding in the East hand. But he doesn't have any entries to the hearts so continuing them may be futile|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now the pay comes|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1 trick lost by opening the @H|pg||
nt|zman1: has to give ruff sluff for -2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seen|pg||
nt|zman1: if you want to see them actually play by video here you go http://weblive.nsysu.edu.tw/live2010.htm|pg||
nt|rodal f: @HA?|pg||
nt|sjicheng: should be |pg||
nt|rodal f: Not that easy for S to count up N|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: Yes, when S discard @CA, North should know S has no loser|pg||
nt|sjicheng: but i think HA is a reasonable discard here. it's hard for N to totally have no C|pg||
nt|rodal f: If NS use UDCA it should be clear by the @H|pg||
nt|sjicheng: and discard of HA will guide N to play C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: so North should return @C immediately|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c4|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk:  well done Andreas, thanks fellows|pg||

nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  and appreciated to the organizators & Mr Bionic Man|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT or 5@C both make 3NT chances for +1 with the @d's|pg||
nt|the saint: Y, NS play multi Landy|pg||
nt|iceking: or with no tens and 9s maybe north should just invite |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 3c|pg||

nt|vugraphzjr: Sorry for the miss |pg||

nt|rodal f: When * I correct my last sentence, Sr Shi.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: A @S switch is going to down|pg||
nt|garnetts: better for east to double 2@H and let west decide what to do--I think east has too much to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Looking more like 11D is negative|pg||
nt|iceking: yes strong club it is |pg||
nt|iceking: wonder why S broke the transfer |pg||
nt|jlall: roger is a big believer in leading a heart on this kind of hand, I'm a big believer in leading a spade...you have no entry and a topless suit, it's not that likely a heart will do ...|pg||

mb|4H|nt|the saint: Possible swing back here. N/S are climbing without oxygen nw|pg||

nt|sjicheng: yes, that's the price of greedy|pg||
mb|p|nt|zman1: if west has QJ9x@S u cant do anything|pg||

nt|sjicheng: ic:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: yes maybe its fine|pg||

nt|the saint: Ah, the cuebidding roundabout - once you get on it, you can never get off in time|pg||
nt|rmb1: When Alan became almost old enough to play Gerber he co-invented sliding rainbow gerber where any bid from 4@C+ could be Gerber|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hackenbush: looks like North took South's pull to 3@h as showing extra shape or strength|pg||
nt|garnetts: North has now made a penalty try--no one has covered themselves in glory here|pg||

nt|rmb1: Real IMPs to UK when West recognised the need not to cue bid over 4@C|pg||
mb|1C|nt|zman1: so i believe kevin's line is the right way to go|pg||
nt|iceking: 3 more boards USA haveing a great match |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Til he lost something. @S was played from N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: Took the side turning before the roundabout|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H is a normal spot, and should make much of the time.|pg||
nt|othered1: East doesn't have a totally obvious bid here|pg||
nt|iceking: 3clubs is just 2 agressive |pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|iceking: no east might just pass here |pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzjr: another interesting hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@D|pg||
nt|sjicheng: will anyone coming with N hand?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: i dont like 4h much |pg||
mb|p|nt|zman1: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: You might try 3N on west's hand.|pg||
nt|iceking: yes it looks better to me also w should try shoot out some game here|pg||
nt|sjicheng: ou... he really came in....|pg||
nt|jlall: 2@C might be a transfer advance showing diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: No doubble no troubble|pg||
nt|zman1: -3ish|pg||
nt|garnetts: South should quit now as should everyone else |pg||
pc|hK|nt|rmb1: Rainbow Gerber is documented at the wonderful but moribund poor bridge site http://www.poorbridge.com/?misc=28|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|rodal f: Last B was a interesting one for play as safe as u can.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|the saint: That is the old version. Since then we have modified it and added Last Train Gerber and Over the Top Gerber, where both members of the pair can bid Gerber in the same auction.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: East might have tried 3@h, but having @hQx and only 3 diamonds is a turn-off|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|jlall: north has deduced that south has some club length, and stiff K acts well as a stopper -- when they don't know you have stiff K|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: now they have 2 @C stopper|pg||
nt|grypho:  any club but the queen|pg||
nt|garnetts: should cross and lead a @D |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|zman1: there are only 4 layouts that kevin would go wrong|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jlall: this lead is quite poor in my opinion|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: still far from making|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|rmb1: I hope all this work has not modified Gerber to a point where it might be useful :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tell|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|rodal f: @C8 can be a hard card for E to find id @D@D@D|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well done |pg||
pc|d9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|the saint: EW can wriggle, but I can't see an endplay here. So it is down to NS to misdefend this|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jlall: declarer is still down as long as no one panicks|pg||
nt|grypho:  only 8 clear tricks though|pg||
nt|jlall: the normal thing to do is lead the @C ace wheny ou hold a side ace. |pg||
nt|jlall: that way you can pick up Kx or Jx on the second round|pg||
nt|grypho:  talk to him about it :)|pg||
nt|jlall: on this auction RHO is a big favorite to have only 2 clubs though, he showed long diamodns and hearts. So if I had to guess I'd say Kx on right is more likely than Kxx and Jx in ...|pg||
nt|jlall: dummy|pg||
nt|jlall: so if gotard plays a spade here|pg||
nt|jlall: fournier must pop and shift to hearts|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mtvesuvius: Would have worked quite nicely here, and 3@H is certainly an underbid... my main concern with 3N though is when partner has a doubleton spade|pg||
pc|h9|nt|othered1: west will get the bad news in trumps (not unexpected when south had 3@S) and will push hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: @C8 will make declarer to cash @H|pg||
nt|rodal f: As now |pg||
nt|sjicheng: but no harm for contract seems|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: but now declarer could not ruff @D and need to lose @D and @S|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: But some problems EW, -1?|pg||
nt|grypho:  i'm sure he has count in the spade suit|pg||
nt|jlall: he was not put to the test|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|hackenbush: pitching a spade on @HT would have resulted in one more trick. This theme of making declarer unable to finish drawing trump comes up surprisingly often|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jlall: it seems like declarer erred there|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s3|nt|sjicheng: ops....|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jlall: he could have won the SQ and played a spade at least to put fournier in|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|iceking: yes its a gamble but i do dislike 3h alot|pg||
mc|10|nt|the saint: Daaaaave is going to have to insert an honour as North when the spade gets played|pg||

nt|chmitty: We all can see that defence could take 6 tricks ... in theory|pg||

nt|iceking: either 3nt or dbl |pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure it's too good, just inferior to taking the 3N position.|pg||
nt|grypho:  the director pressure may have caused him to play too quickly|pg||
nt|jlall: 3N +1 seems like a good result for germany here|pg||
nt|jlall: could easily see this going down|pg||
nt|hackenbush: players on break|pg||
mb|1D|nt|the saint: It appears I had reckoned without Mr Fish|pg||
nt|zman1: 5-0 break ur always -1|pg||
nt|hackenbush: live video: http://weblive.nsysu.edu.tw/live2010.htm|pg||
nt|hackenbush: now all back|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: If NS plated @D each time they was in. @C( would be hard to find. Was as I ment Edward.|pg||
nt|rodal f: played*|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: at least in my style i would never think about 3h|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: I just wanderd since all have more than 4. H-H have a lot more than 4|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rmb1: Aparrently he did not avoid it|pg||
nt|garnetts: matter of choice between dble and 1NT--I prerfer 1NT |pg||
mb|d|nt|iceking: but i can understand it would be fine bid for some others we all dont  think alike |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: the second double shows a decent hand and probably only 3 spades--not four anyway |pg||
mb|2S|nt|zman1: ?|pg||
nt|jlall: 3@C asking for 5 card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|sjicheng: N is brave here... will W find Spade lead?|pg||
nt|jlall: 3@D denying them|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: second time east doesnt bid his 6card club suit |pg||
nt|iceking: both time pd had 3card support |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: transfers over the double would work nicely|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: a little thought by Yang before pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: I can't see how a spade can cost. On any layout|pg||
nt|rmb1: Chance missed, 6NT only needs hearts to break|pg||
nt|othered1: Even on h ands like east's, I get lucky when I get my long suit into the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: now a @C from dummy will bring this contract home|pg||
nt|sjicheng: it's still a difficult contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@S from N often used as 3 card in Norway - Holland as now Germany. Just force after 1@H|pg||
pc|dA|nt|grypho:  on a heart lead you have to just play the ace|pg||
nt|grypho:  not enough though|pg||
nt|jlall: yes you go down for sure if you do that|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|the saint: Fortunate for UK. I don't think W got even remotely to grips with his hand next door|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Good precision auction though... to a good spot|pg||
nt|iceking: yes good point Adam everyone should play transfers here|pg||
nt|iceking: you gain so much tempo in playing transfers here|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jlall: south cannot read the 6 though, it might be Q876|pg||
nt|grypho:  my fault poor analysis there|pg||
nt|jlall: although if it was Q876, declarer would have AJx opp xx|pg||
nt|jlall: and would likely not duck trick 1|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|garnetts: the key to making this appears to be to play ace and another heart early|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|jlall: anyways, declarer has a chance|pg||
nt|hackenbush: lose 1 in each suit, and either an extra trump or diamond|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jlall: a small diamond to the king and then the CQ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jlall: yes|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jlall: very thoughtful play by lee|pg||
nt|grypho:  very good.  communication was an issur and that solved it|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|sJ|pc|c3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|sjicheng: em.... another big win for german|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jlall: he saw the ten drop|pg||
nt|jlall: so he knows he has 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jlall: that hesitation is scary :)|pg||
nt|hackenbush: sneaky play low spade from board. Hard for North to rise @sT|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Max was 500 but very hard to find. Belive 300 will give some IMPs|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: that R/W overcall is... not my choice|pg||
mb|4H|nt|the saint: Looks like both games are doomed and only double dummy play will keep 3N one off|pg||

nt|hackenbush: last board now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|the saint: A chance NS could end up in 4S|pg||

pc|s6|nt|lmeili: pls come back in 15 mins|pg||

nt|the saint: That won't make either|pg||
nt|the saint: 4@S is not a bad spot|pg||
nt|othered1: If you're going to open north with 1N, it's likely your later judgment won't be optimal, either.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|rodal f: That one is a bit hard. But look at 4@H|pg||
nt|iceking: 3h is really not  a option here either pass or dbl |pg||

nt|iceking: i doubt that |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I played their system notes with Mitch last week|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and unless there is something I forgot, he could have opened this 1H (1N then semiforcing)... but chose 1N. Once he makes that decision though, needs to stick with it on the second ...|pg||
