pc|h9|nt|vugraphzjr: EW leading T/9 shows 0 or 2 higher cards|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|h_karluk: This is a hand which has transportation problem, with only entry to hand even 2@s not easy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Hamdi. |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe that's another everyday situation, players sometimes get excited with 20 points|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but there's a solution with such holdings, just double then cue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: your partner will recognize you've the 20+ and pick the suitable level|pg||
nt|the saint: Off centre overcall from East|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: after this fact there's a double dummy solution|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|the saint: Too many cards look well placed to defeat this. And the diamond blockage is preventing the defence from setting up a force|pg||

pc|d3|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: North obviously took south's 4S as natural, and 6C a huge 2-suiter|pg||

pc|cK|pc|s8|pc|c4|nt|gracelin: So a Kickback for H, as I guessed earlier.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lmeili: according their teammates, 4@s is A asking, 5@s shows even/od (?) w/void|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d4|pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d7|pc|c9|nt|gracelin: I thk it's the right interpretaion if they do agree to use Kickback.  A simple 3S will show a spade hand.|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|3D|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|the saint: 2@S two suited? And do we know the agreed range? |pg||
nt|Walddk6: Welcome Alan and Robin|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi |pg||
mb|4D!|nt|the saint: Balancing protection from North.|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: when you see trumps 3-1 you can go with another round trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : 3-2 trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry for typo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Flat 4@H EW but will NS find there sac?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|rmb1: 3@H probably invitational, with 2NT sign-off (Lebensohl) not that North is being invited anywhere :)|pg||
nt|the saint: Has walked into a strong hidden West hand. If East can have that hand then West must be an absolute supermax pass|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|rodal f: A interesting 5@D. At right hand and a @H endplay?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i said DD solution, the reason is quite obvious, south's 4 hcp could be @d A, in that case your K works |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Snorri Sveinsson|pg||
nt|snorris: Hi|pg||
mb|5S!|nt|h_karluk: Hi there, wlcm|pg||
nt|the saint: If 2N is Leb and X can be weaker, shouldn't S transfer a King?|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|snorris: will top @cs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but then maybe the question is why they did not try slam|pg||
nt|snorris: its a good slam actually|pg||
nt|the saint: I must confess a vested interest. I have known NS since they were 14-15. |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rmb1: Its rather an inaccurate position, if you "transfer a King" the TO double has a large effective range|pg||
nt|the saint: It will have a larger one simply through protecting|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: <my review, my analyse> 2@d huge underbid|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|rmb1: I met the "UK" team (asn TD) when they beat Oxford in the final of UK unniversities championship to qualify.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|the saint: North, Graeme, is better known as 'Daaaaaaave' (long story) and South, David, as 'Mr Fish'.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|snorris: think 2@ds is gf and 3nt showing flat hand|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d5|pc|hA|nt|rodal f: UPS:( Had time to wait for that. Test ure @H!!!|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|the saint: In fact, I don't think I have called them Graeme or David for at least 3 years|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|snorris: but west should continue|pg||
nt|rmb1: It was confusing to have two davids in the team when one was referred to Fish and one non-David was referred to a Daaaave|pg||
nt|the saint: Graeme is actually his middle name. His passport says David|pg||
nt|rmb1: There is a debate on BBF on responding to (2M)-P-(P)-X-(P) with CAQxxxx and an outside A: is it too good for 3@C?|pg||
nt|the saint: It looks like Mr Fish can only make two more|pg||
nt|the saint: If he attempts to set up the club he gets forced in spades|pg||
nt|the saint: http://ubridge2010.nsysu.edu.tw/result/round.php?rid=2 - link to latest results|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: then west still could be able to dictate|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lmeili: S can't raise @d, 3@d shows 16+|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|lmeili: yes, every every one questions about it|pg||
mb|4H!|an|Kickback|mb|p|nt|gracelin: North can make an advance cue of 3S before gong to 4D. But anyway, they should be in 6D here. |pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|gracelin: it seems south's 4H was Kickback here, and north's 2nd step response showed 0/3 key card.|pg||

nt|vugraphzjr: Another slam for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: maybe in his area there are such trends, in general consumes space, not a good bid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|the saint: Is that some kind of 5 card stayman or other method? Can't see any reason for enquiring otherwise|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|snorris: many ways to 10/11 tricks here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if somebody intends to do that in USA sectionals or regionals warning auto comes : dont try to play both sides of the table|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: looks like a good stop @d ruff avail plus 3 aces|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Perhaps he would have the option of finding/showing a small doubleton and playing 4-3 H|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rmb1: North's energetic defence to 3NT here, cost 2IMP on board 3|pg||
