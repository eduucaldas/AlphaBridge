nt|sharkey: @CJ Jan Arne - and claim :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally prefer to use a 2@C rebid after 1@D opening to show a good hand. Gives you room to explore below 3N, at a cost on some natural auctions on lesser hands.|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: EW will find 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well this slam wont be missed thats for sure|pg||
nt|othered1: South's double is interesting with that shape and not that many high cards|pg||
nt|haans: odd take out x|pg||
nt|henryb:  Going back to board one, where Lunna mysteriously took 12 tricks in 6N, shouldn't it be possible for big club players to reach 6@c?|pg||
nt|othered1: North has to act h ere and EW may find themselves defending a high @D contract|pg||
nt|haans: big clubs does anything :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: in board 1, Lunna got a diamond in the lead, and South was endplayed in spade|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: 7N is technically better as well because if clubs broke badly you would have the spade position to fall back on|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|paulg:  North has denied primary spade support and shown values in diamonds, neither of which improve the south hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzna: indeed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that's the problem. South assumed that he had an opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: declarer not down yet, tho|pg||
nt|april7: very true, actually nothing wrong with the biddingthe minute N opens but unlucky|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It sometimes seems to me that in the English Acol system there are so many bids that are regarded as non-forcing that are regarded as forcing in other countries..  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: because responder is forever trying to find out if the opening bidder had an opening bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  the modern game is one of overbidding .. the stars do it and the rest of us copy|pg||
nt|paulg:  if declarer could see all four hands he would probably duck a heart now|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: N asks for the time, 6min left|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: kib suggested ducking a @h|pg||
nt|paulg:  of course there are many problems with the hand, not least wondering if East led a singleton|pg||
nt|chick: what about playing the @CQ, @S to A, pitching the spade from hand, then crossruffing?|pg||
nt|april7: then you lose 2 @H tricks|pg||
