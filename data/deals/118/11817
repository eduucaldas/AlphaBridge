nt|vbman: late for 2 sp tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: If the @H9 is a count signal, which is likely, it will tell West that East did indeed have six hearts for his vulnerable 2@H overcall.|pg||

pc|s3|nt|brolucius: If you agree to signal 2nd best (then 4th best) from four cards, this often differentiates between two and four. (Not here, though, once West has false-carded the @D7).|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Van Cleef and Sveindal are both bridge journalists. Senior has written about 50 books on the game (coming in at around 7th in the all-time list).|pg||

nt|brolucius: It was not at all easy for North to lead a high heart. South might have held @HJ-x rather than three low.|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk2: But in that case North has no entry to his hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: I'm sure they knew what the double meant, but South's holding was not certain within that category of hands.|pg||
