nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeredsea.com/index.html  for the festival website|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Eilat is Israel's southernmost city, a busy port as well as a popular resort, located at the northern tip of the Red Sea, on the Gulf of Eilat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the 15th edition of the Red Sea Festival|pg||
nt|jcmax: So, let's see. EW have a double fit in @H + @S. 12 tricks can be made in either denomination unless a diamond is led. Will they be tempted to bid slam?|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: MR. Birman is making the introduction now|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: for both the open match and the juniors match|pg||

nt|mildredb: Not me|pg||
