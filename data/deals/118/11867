nt|vinbtech: especially here when u have 55 |pg||
nt|chick: I guess the players want action too :)    10 points around the table, and suddenly we are at 3N|pg||
nt|othered1: If yoiu get @S into the auction, say by not preempting, 4@S might be biddable.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: Espen Erichsen plays a lot at the Young Chelsea club in West London |pg||
nt|lestergold: Commentator's curse but that will not feel quite as bad as the result here will feel to poor Tony Waterlow|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: Chick you had better say something to the card dealer|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|lestergold: Price's pre-empt following a double to show the enormity of his 8 points!|pg||

nt|mdgraham: sry,priv|pg||
nt|haans: they did well to stop at 4|pg||
nt|ady: some might have used a michaels overcall with the west hand    not sure if e/w play michaels |pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry 9 points|pg||
nt|othered1: That wasn't an automatic reopening at 3-level.|pg||

nt|othered1: they like to open the bidding, too.|pg||
nt|chick: probably ... limit with 4 trumps|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: ah|pg||
nt|lestergold: Price used to be the manage of TGRs bridge club many years ago|pg||
nt|haans: but overcall 1nt with 19?|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec has got it|pg||
nt|lestergold: but very slow|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: Invitationa lwith 3 or 4 @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H looks one too many - doubt EW will bid on at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|lestergold: will they phantom at unfav colours i doubt it|pg||
nt|chick: W nice diamonds, but 5@D pretty suicidal|pg||
nt|lestergold: absolutely which means small is capable of it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running scores in other matches: Rosen 69 - 103 Hackett; Hassett 102 - 101 Howard; Dhondy 64 - 69 Irens.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H makes, though, on second look....can set up a long club|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes what about spade lead|pg||
nt|chick: not with spade leads|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 18|pg||
nt|chick: 18, but I approve of 1N|pg||
nt|lestergold: small in tank|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: Simpson was a useful chap to havwe around if you got hijacked by a terrorist|pg||
nt|othered1: 18 to my count and it looks right.  Big difference between 1N openings and overcalls|pg||
nt|chick: ah, maybe anyway, with the A10x|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chick: the QJ@C is suspect, and it's more descriptive than doubling first|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: 5NT often used to ask for specific kings, rather than how many|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And there was an appeal in the Dhondy - Hassett match yesterday so that score is now 16-14 rather than 17-13|pg||
nt|lestergold: I take some responsibility for Small's addiciton to the game- I taught him physics and bridge- altho he eventually obtained a first class in physics he prefers bridge|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzat: Rosen 72 Howard 58|pg||

nt|lestergold: defence can only come to 4 more tricks yes down 2|pg||
nt|othered1: No, there are some more decisions to make|pg||
nt|othered1: south knows the @DA is off|pg||
nt|haans: and he knows were it is|pg||
nt|othered1: and at 300 points/ undertrick, south does well to work out how best to limit the loss.  Good players focus on that, not how they got to this spot.|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: Of course, if the opponents decide to play in your 7-card @S fit, 1@C is very clear|pg||

nt|lestergold: did u hear that folks ? the ever shy reticent and retiring quiet Chick|pg||
nt|chick: meanwhile, an interesting auction :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: im trying to fathom it|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Osborne thinking hard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: these matches are very long, three segments of 20 boards - so we will hit the comparisons when we get to board 17 |pg||
mb|3H!|nt|chick: The redouble alerted as showing @Ds,  probably the 1@h bid is an escape attempt|pg||
nt|lestergold: Whittaker has pushed boat out with this festering hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: personally, I can't imagine opening 1@C with 5 spades, not even the 65432.  Giving your partner accurate distribution info is the most crucial part of bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: weak no-trumpers might very well bid the EW cards 1NT-3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: better for East to play 4@H, as South is likely to lead @SQ|pg||
nt|haans: 3rd hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: and now S is happy to tell partner Don't compete further|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ady: on the face of it there are 3 top losers in 4 spades    but the 4-1 trump split  and the need to get diamonds right make it precarious|pg||
nt|lestergold: has made a definite penalty trybut its e/w who look like getting too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but as it is, NS have a chance to defeat the contract|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|lestergold: double dummy frigid|pg||
nt|lestergold: rabbi 's rule i think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I bet West passes the @C10|pg||
nt|chick: might make this when he serendipitiously gets 2 pitches on clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: when qx is doubleton offside you do not finesse isnt that the rabbi's rule|pg||
nt|chick: maybe, but I'd try to ruff out the Q, given the original takeout X by N|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: May be not, as Liggins doubled 3@h. North perhaps marked with Q@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: or did i mix it up with the rule about making sure the extractor is on when a rabbi is frying his bacon|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although, if South has an honour in clubs - and it looks like it from the lead (not @HA or K) then the double is thin without the @CQ    |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Does the Rabbi have a rule about the @CQ as well as the K?|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|lestergold: Price and Simpson do not perform consistently well but when they have their days they are pretty formidable|pg||

nt|peachy: bidding went off the rails|pg||

pc|dA|nt|dburn: the bad news is that you still can't make the contract|pg||

nt|subhranp: yes, that was simpler|pg||
nt|dburn: this is absurd|pg||
nt|dburn: if West had a doubleton heart, this line would have gone down|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what to say about the opening lead - don't have all that much sympathy with it, because dummy was almost certain to be void|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|dburn: and declarer was likely to have quite a few values in diamonds because West did not double the 3@d transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: Some discussion about a 'poor' explanation|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes bidding definitely indicated void|pg||
nt|dburn: but still, it's hard to blame a man too harshly for having two aces on lead against a slam and leading one of them|pg||
nt|jcwla: That sounds like sour grapes.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is hard to believe. Off in game, but slam is no problem|pg||
mc|12|nt|othered1: No problem with that lead|pg||

mb|4C!|nt|chick: what do you do when you figure out you are bidding  6511 opposite 1165?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: stop bidding asap|pg||
nt|chick: Pass as soon as possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: in 4H dummy could mostly end up in the trash can|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ady: as it happens e/w have done well to keep out of the bidding|pg||

nt|haans: you mean good try :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: Hackett looks at least ten years younger than his real age - I believe that he and Martin Hoffman won a world pairs championship when I was in short trousers|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: trump lead and declarer has problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially with the stiff spade in the short trump hand here|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: Small having a coughing fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: does a diamond do it folks?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small throws a spade only one discard|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: No he can play a trump to dummy and discard @c on @s|pg||

nt|lestergold: no biut when small disacrds a spade only one discard available|pg||
nt|chick: although if W pitches a spade on the diamond, can ruff the 2nd spade|pg||

nt|mdgraham: now only one spade will cash|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec has pointed out the diamond play thx to spec|pg||

nt|Walddk2: aha|pg||
nt|dburn: in fact, most of the time you get rather more information from Garvey than you need or want|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|an| |mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Which explanation did Crouch get is what is important, and was it the correct one according to their methods|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: 1@S had been my choice on N hand|pg||

nt|chick: A spec asks,  why not ruff the @D high, ruff a @C, pitch last club on @SK|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: K@s will be ruffed by Osborne|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: on the likely heart lead  2 spades should be down 1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, they have ended in 2@S, which will make, so EW are unlikely to revise their penchant for this sort of opening |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: E/W open 11-13 balanced 1C with a poor major and 1M with a good major.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: practical approach by East facing a strong NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: becasue east styill had a trump left and would be able to ruff that spade|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chick: 1@S for blocking purposes?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland would go negative on th e/w cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: yep :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: well i was wrong sold out to only 5D and that is chep|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 off ?|pg||
nt|chick: I like that too, it's a very pretty psyche bid, but E will double to uncover it :)|pg||
nt|haans: nowday they x for takeout|pg||
nt|lestergold: very cheap indeed|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: Is east good enough to double 1@S, I would but many want a better hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: thaty was the crucial thing on the hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: 2nt not modern bid :)|pg||
nt|chick: I think also he would have to lose a trump getting back to his hand to draw them|pg||
nt|lestergold: in other words you couldnt have the cake and eat it either the qh draws east's trump or its used to ruff a club only one or the opther|pg||

mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: 3@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S seems a bit unilateral|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 4 key cards missing - surely N cant have three of 'em !|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South might expect something like AK eighth for that|pg||
nt|othered1: despite a few tricks dropped in defense of 1@S doubled, EW have a very powerful card so far.|pg||

nt|lestergold: i was expecting a 3N attempt here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sons have been telling their fathers that for at least five thousand years, Mike|pg||

nt|lestergold: its one years experience repeated 4o times|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: double dummy very easy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: Thing lie well enough that I'd guess declarer will get his nine before EW find five.|pg||
nt|lestergold: spades play for three triks|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ady: lucky here Dixon has both missing aces   so cant get a heart ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: best lead here giving nothing away|pg||
nt|chick: it's certainly true that EW have the same problem, no long suit to set up|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard for e/w tho to come to more than aclub a diamodn and 2 spades on almost anhy line likely to be taken here|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not at all clear what the best line is|pg||
nt|othered1: How do  you play this?  Is win in dummy, @CA and low @D possible?|pg||
nt|chick: clubs will guarantee 3 tricks, but must keep the @HA entry|pg||
nt|haans: he must keep a lot of entries|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think win in dummy unblock lub  and try a diamond seems a reasonable opening gambit|pg||
nt|chick: that's the line I was thinking best, Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe simply low @D at trick 2.|pg||
nt|haans: but then he is at the wrong hand for spades|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: not too much virtue in maintating club blockage- clubs would normally provide 4 tricks on a 4/3 layout|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if they play enough Swiss Teams, they will at least make Grand Master one day  |pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: The phrase "opening bid" no longer means the same thing it used to (points and a suit)|pg||

nt|haans: if Hackett raise off they go|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|chick: not sure their 2N convention here, but 3N should show a solid runnable suit (IMO)|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that may get them to slam|pg||
mb|2D!|an|FSF|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@d showed hearts, so 2@d here is fourth-suit forcing|pg||
mb|2H|nt|haans: nothing we want to know |pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is one awkward aspect of the 8-11 range. South, with a 14-count, feels compelled to enquire |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT shows a maximum, no shortage (thanks Nick Irens)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: and N will be a bit uneasy to lay down that dummy !|pg||

nt|chick: poor 4N by west, he needs to know WHICH ace(s)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: can now make 13 tricks   and may well do so|pg||
nt|othered1: It wasn't ace-asking, I'd bet.  It was a strong takeout demand|pg||
nt|haans: portman rd: pick a minor?|pg||
nt|chick: E will worry about having to ruff, missing @CQ109x|pg||
nt|othered1: At least that's what it would be if it came up in my partnerships.   Not just pick a minor -- still a negative double, but with much extra strength.|pg||
nt|othered1: In my eyes, if the @SK were a working king, east would have a slam to bid.|pg||

nt|chick: void somewhere, I guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Just explained as void by osborne|pg||
nt|lestergold: void specified?|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Nope|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: The inference would be he thinks it's a void @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: however odds are diamonds or why arent opps barraging with their 11 card black suit fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not a bad idea to have ranges for various splinter bids. |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: eg 1M-4m 10-12, 13-15 go through 2NT, etc|pg||
nt|lestergold: east isnt writing home about the quality of his heart suit either|pg||
nt|chick: problem with that is 2N often denies a singleton/void|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can structure things so that 2NT includes a splinter option|pg||
nt|lestergold: Os in tank?|pg||
nt|chick: if 4@c is generic void, E must have a way to ask|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@D, one would imagine :) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: it seems to me that 3@S would be a better option for a generic void|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Almost the end now, so time for a few words of thanks: to our excellent operator David Muller, and to the English Bridge Union and Max Bavin for bringing this event to BBO vugraph.|pg||
nt|chick: This is the last board at this table|pg||

nt|vinbtech: ty all|pg||
nt|vinbtech: ty EBU and BBO|pg||
nt|capercliff: routine 4@h here?|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the session     looks like Hasset will win|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this should be flat|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Thanks also to Cornelia Yoder (USA) and Hans Sjostrom (Sweden) for commentary. I am Mike Graham (England). Also thanks to all spectators for some useful and perceptive comments. |pg||
nt|chick: Excellent job by David @H@H|pg||
nt|vinbtech: looks routine unless the 6S hand has had not enough say before 4H is reached !|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vinbtech: with his 6151 distribution|pg||
nt|chick: This is the last board of this session.   We will return in 1 hour with the next (last for today).|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2@D   transfer response showing hearts|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S     is 800    a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y -3 800|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: 53-0 so far this session - a veritable cricket score|pg||
nt|haans: @H we´ll meet again @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Wonderful when the hardware doesn't let you down|pg||
nt|haans: how did they stop at 3@D at OR|pg||
nt|haans: error?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|vinbtech: surely N will now close shop with 4H !|pg||
nt|capercliff: are they going too high?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: or is it W who has pulled the shutters ? lol|pg||
nt|capercliff: can set up the Q@d for a @c pitch?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: but still only 11 tricks  will need to draw 2 trumps to enjoy Q@D   so can only ruff 2 spades   |pg||
nt|chick: A very big thanks to our excellent vugraph operator, Steve Popham!!   Great job, Steve!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: only thing wrong with 3nt is no make|pg||
nt|chick: a minor annoyance :)|pg||
nt|haans: so true|pg||
nt|chick: I would bid 4@H with S's hand, and now I would certainly bid 4@H with N's|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: danger here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: So they get there anyway|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|chick: This is the last hand at this table for today.  |pg||
pc|h3|nt|capercliff: i think 6 can make perhaps|pg||
nt|chick: Many thanks to the English Bridge Union and Max Bavin and to BBO and Roland Wald for bringing this event to viewgraph!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chick: I guess the @SA tells everyone where the defensive entries are|pg||
nt|capercliff: will west be squeezed?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: SK and C - and squeeze not there !|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks to the British bridge organization, and to BBO, for bringing this event to us on vugragh!!|pg||
nt|chick: The Engish Bridge Union and Max Bavin  :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks also to the English Bridge Union and Max Bavin for his work in bringing this to BBO|pg||
nt|othered1: bye for now.|pg||
nt|chick: And to my fellow commentators Hans and Ed!|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|capercliff: yes must play a @c now|pg||
nt|capercliff: he could try and set up the @d for a pitch but west will ruff the 4th round|pg||
nt|capercliff: and he cant draw 2 rounds of trumps as he needs to ruff 3 @s's|pg||
nt|ady: dont think it can make without a club|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It needs a club switch now to break up the squeeze|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes only a @c now|pg||
nt|capercliff: and I think he can work it out|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Otherwise West will be squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|ady: only another spade will give it        highly unlikely|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|capercliff: or a @d|pg||
nt|capercliff: or a trump|pg||
nt|capercliff: he can make it now|pg||
nt|ady: now might make     diamond would have been ok|pg||
nt|capercliff: but he may try to ruff a @d good as the squeeze is double dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How does a diamond help the defence, David?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West is squeezed to pieces|pg||
nt|chick: Our vugraph operator Heather Dhondy has been great!  Thanks, Heather @H@H@H|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks also to the great commentators today, Martin Carroll (Ireland), and Mike Gold and Mike Graham (England).  I am Cornelia Yoder (USA).|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Thanks everyone|pg||
pc|hK|nt|capercliff: if @d are 4-4 he doesnt need the squeeze|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|chick: We'll be back tomorrow for more of the Premier League 2009 event!  http://www.ebu.co.uk/events/?eventid=12  |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|chick: Check the BBO vugraph schedule http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/v2schedule.php for times in your area.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: East under no pressure on the run of the diamonds|pg||
nt|chick: at least -1 is a push, and N will expect the same result at the other table|pg||
nt|ady: no you are right he can still do it|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cJ|pc|dA|nt|capercliff: and with the @s bid it is unlikely that both the @c cards are with W|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vinbtech: he's home and dry !|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|cQ|pg||
mc|11|nt|mcarroll: a hard earned overtrick imp!|pg||
