nt|hagz: Easy @s lead if South is declarer...|pg||
nt|haans: Hordaland taking a firm lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seemed he was in some danger of getting the @CK ruffed.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: These matches are 60 boards long. Three sessions of twenty boards.|pg||
nt|sharkey:  board 1 shud have boosted their confidence|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon and welcome back to the Royal National Hotel, London, for this fifth round match in the English Premier League. |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Sorry pc problems|pg||
nt|ritong: hi cornelia|pg||
nt|ritong: & mike|pg||
nt|ritong: & all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: http://www.ebu.co.uk/events/?eventid=12  for standings after 4 rounds|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|lestergold: wellthatis possible but its a bit eggs in one basket ish |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Townsend Goldplay the f system shhhh...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this is the sort of game that you tend to bid on momentum, just in case it makes   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: David, do you know if EW play the Crouch-Liggins methods, or something different?|pg||
nt|ritong: a minor flaw:)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|haans: good alert of !@C often forgotten|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brolucius: Liv, the VG operator, is kindly putting in the results from the other table by hand. We do not have a linked BBO table, so the auction at the other table is not available.|pg||
nt|brolucius: We can guess here that South rebid 3@C at the other table.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D/@H for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and some times the club queen is beheaded - and the contract makes even with 4 losers|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you pass as E?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think so Gold believes it fills a useul gap|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri: I would :)|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D for me|pg||
nt|brolucius: Probably, but I would have bid more as South.|pg||
nt|hedyg: unexpected lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Anyone prefer 1@H opening with S hand?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW undercompeting here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|drorp:  if they found the switch to spade in time, it'll be 120, if they don't, 180, not much of an interesting hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm Im surprised Allfrey passed over the double- im ven m,ore amazed he sells out here|pg||
nt|lestergold: at these colours one cannot blame forrester|pg||
nt|ritong: i was just kidding about our esteemed vug manager, i certainly would not question people s choices of system, especially a pair of GT caliber|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|haans: 2@C the invite bid|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|haans: they play Viking Precision Club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer hopes to ruff a heart.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: i prefer to show shape|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|haans: no :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C is any invitational hand|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|hedyg: in 2@c he is really not worried|pg||
nt|brolucius: The defenders are not in love with that idea.|pg||
nt|sharkey: I must admit I wud have opened 1@H|pg||
nt|vinbtech: with S instead of H - its 1C  for me ; else here i'd open 1H|pg||
nt|lestergold: so many club games and slams will be lost forever if you open heart|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW play a strong club system. |pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: especially Vul |pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: West accepts the invite, even with a 5422 13-count. The lure of the vulnerable game bonus|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: ok|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|haans: been boring this far|pg||
nt|drorp:  now's the "cruical" moment :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps better to start hearts from dummy and hide your di honor|pg||
nt|jbgood: -s|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: a very surprised gold, will make a lot of tick|pg||
nt|lestergold: tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: 1@H with 9-15|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|hedyg: push|pg||
mc|9|nt|lestergold: surprised that he is being allowed to play in 2D|pg||
pg||

nt|haans: 4-0 in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: i know downside when pard responds 1 spade and there is no interference|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jbgood: looks as if 4@s can be beaten |pg||
nt|mdgraham: perennial problem for North over a 1@S opener |pg||
nt|chick: W's hand was good enough for another bid, even opposite nil|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, we can anticipate a part-score swing there |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: acceptable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H with a bad suit, a (possibly) light 1NT...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: slam time?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jbgood: di ace, two hearts and a third heart promotes a trump trick|pg||
nt|sharkey: 12-14 I presume|pg||
nt|mdgraham: penalty double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Gues NS will Dbl with any hand 14+ vs weak NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they will be disappointed if so|pg||
nt|ritong: welcome to the one and only david burn|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sharkey: ty Mike - changes things|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, the NS system file would seem to indicate penalties...|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 2S weak i presume; else P= Forcing i presume with strength|pg||
nt|lestergold: wel it must be i assume|pg||
nt|sharkey: Thought the English played weak NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: no minus 200 for NS :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: You need some system to describe all the heart-support hands for West. 3@H is usually played as pretty weak with four trumps.|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S and 2NT for better hearts hands|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D probably means a strongish raise to the two-level.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Chance for East to bid his clubs.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is the lead that he might have needed against 4@S.|pg||
nt|dburn: good afternoon|pg||
mb|2N|nt|haans: its a vul game guys|pg||
nt|jbgood: but of course on a club lead 4@s is an easy make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South perhaps thinking that double would be a overdoing things a bit |pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: and he was right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It's not compulsory|pg||
nt|lestergold: er i do not think that my son's poremier league team would go near a weak no trump with a barge pole|pg||
nt|lestergold: er i do not think so Kath altho 6 of a major can make as acrds lie|pg||
nt|dburn: so can 6NT, of course, but...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hi David i think you missed last hand you might have had something to say|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is it likely to reach 6 of a major?|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|haans: how could they have avoided 4@S i OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be David can find out?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: nah|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|haans: hard to do right from east|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon David|pg||
mb|3S|nt|brolucius: North has a good diamond holding to match South's bid. Against thatm the @HK may be no good. Well, he has bid 4@S anyway. Very reasonable.|pg||
nt|vinbtech: the English have also moved on to higher (safer?) plateaus ! |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 14-16 1/2 15-17 3/4|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks David - makes all the difference, that jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: he plays for N to hold the @d king|pg||
nt|jbgood: not unreasonable|pg||
nt|jbgood: but he is likely to go down now|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c by W would not have been a minispinter but rather show @Cs + @Hs as passed hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: if this reaches slam it will probably be 6N|pg||
mb|6N|nt|chick: and 6N has plenty of possibilities|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on the previous board - if East dredges up a 1@s response, it is possible that EW will get to game |pg||
nt|lestergold: as indeed it has|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East's lead-directional bid has got the defence off to a good start.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: this will come down to a guess in dims|pg||
nt|yo_yo: my record is not so good at guessing J10x opp Kx|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharkey: ty David - with the fractions in there we're further confused :)|pg||
nt|chick: either a diamond lead, or the right guess in diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: gold is probably aware about the 5 @cs with declarer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lets see if Allfrey is better|pg||
nt|lestergold: or a club lead but itys a passive heart|pg||
nt|dburn: well, North may have some difficulty discarding|pg||
nt|lestergold: well im sure i wouldc get it wrong im bad at these 50/ 50 ish guesses|pg||
nt|ritong: since 3@d = long minor 3@h = which one and 3@s = @cs, most likely|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: -2 with best defense|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|hedyg: we have a CR result this time|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: best if he do not try toi give p a clubs ruff|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: hurray!|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzat: May contain 5M or 6m or singleton|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, I don't know why South bid 2@S on a three-card suit. |pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably conventional as someone suggested|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: "S could be 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 2@S could be 3 systemically|pg||
pc|h9|nt|brolucius: Yes, that was good. On a further club, declarer would have thrown the singleton heart and West would have to ruff from a natural trump trick.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jbgood: impossible|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: because Gold may have to bear his dim ace and then i delarer egts it wwrong hes auto ndplayed in any caase|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: PC problems at the other table|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: vsorry my typing|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: so this should roll in|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West may think that South has long diamonds - more likely to have the ace|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/England/townsend-gold.pdf|pg||
nt|ritong: more likely to have any specific card, be it ace or queen|pg||
nt|yo_yo: South could have both A & Q |pg||
nt|ritong: hi R|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you isnt wwest sort of squeezed if spade is cashed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: very exciting slam here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes West has to come down to singleton K @D|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|brolucius: They will not know how good/bad -500 is until they compare scorecards.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: mayboh well|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: that was premature|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it was too difficult|pg||

nt|haans: yes opps do not bid 4@H with a guarantee they will make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now there's a bad result|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5 level ....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one off in five of a major - probably bid under their own steam |pg||
nt|haans: bad only for some|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if it starts 1@H - 4@H, West can enter with a double and East will bid 4@S.|pg||
nt|lestergold: if not selway would have raised|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: I found out at end of hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: nah |pg||
nt|yo_yo: will be interesting to see the result when Erichsen plays it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|haans: or pass pass 3@D ?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: P by Selway  !|pg||
nt|sharkey: undo time|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i wondered|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp:  interesting choice to double with east, on the 7-4|pg||
nt|haans: hard to find 5@D save|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NOT a result team-mates have sympathy for |pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D is bold, at this score.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: save?|pg||
nt|drorp:  after Aa bids 3@h, atleast, Molberg is not going to let his opponents play when he's white VS red|pg||
nt|haans: GF relay or natural|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT is a good bid, but as the cards lie it is not the best contract.|pg||
nt|haans: i can not see N leading low hearts :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: No reason whatsoever, of course, for East to bid 4@S. West might have a long minor and a singleton spade (as he does in hearts, on this lay-out).|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to guess who is thinking...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed, they will sure;y get to slam |pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: 1@D=11-16|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - I must admit I just noticed - but that convention may backfire some day|pg||
nt|mdgraham: back, David - extra pass :)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: surely not a PASS here |pg||
nt|lestergold: a psyche here by patterson|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think i would have done the same as Allfrey |pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: yes 5@D or 5@H both makes|pg||
nt|drorp:  he went with 4@h, knowing his partner has void spade|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: Perhaps North is thinking of doubling, hoping that he can score 4 hearts. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: This is the NS bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont believe evrything u see|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|haans: only east know that he has a distributional hand|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|haans: still no make|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: not relaying|pg||
nt|haans: now |pg||
nt|haans: now relaying|pg||
nt|vinbtech: i thought Seeing is believing !|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: Declarer must now try not to look worried.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|drorp:  now Molgberg should pull it|pg||
nt|drorp:  well done|pg||
nt|drorp:  Aa doesn't know if it's 6-4 or 7-4, but i think it should be 7-4|pg||
nt|drorp:  note that 5@h goes down if the defense attack spades continously|pg||
nt|haans: opps may get a hearts ruff in 5@D|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@C their neg over reverse?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: sry|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: p-atterson off to the killer|pg||
nt|vinbtech: nice lead that |pg||
nt|sharkey: why not 3@H by N - try for 3 NT?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT looks better here, but you can understand why Selway didn't bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed 5C a bit precipitous|pg||
pc|s2|nt|drorp:  great decision from Aa, and this will be a push|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2009Brazil/Systems/bermudabowl/norway/groetheim-tundal.pdf|pg||
nt|mdgraham: link thanks to Jim Gordon|pg||
nt|jbgood: the contract was right-sided in the CR - to no avail..|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 3@C NF|pg||
nt|lestergold: with 8 tricks in his hand seems agood otion|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s7|nt|haans: sometimes easy ti kill :)|pg||
nt|haans: to|pg||
nt|hedyg: N cannot see him maybe|pg||
nt|brolucius: North can hardly expect South to hold seven diamonds to the K-Q, or West would have held up the ace on the first round.|pg||
nt|hedyg: the screen seperates them|pg||
nt|haans: still lead @D will get @H switch|pg||
nt|hedyg: but S has disced 1@h...|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@H and @d?|pg||
nt|hedyg: a bit DD|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be good to know what the @H5 discard means.|pg||
nt|hedyg: hardly encouraging in @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: option|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|brolucius: Brilliant!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: playing safe|pg||
nt|haans: but does @HA mean AK|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|hedyg: i prefer the K@H, surely with AKJ@H he would have led K@H|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: Remember: Ace from AKx is a trick one convention only|pg||
nt|hedyg: or ace|pg||
nt|brolucius: South knows that a diamond is no good, anyway.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: If N, after 3@C NF, believes 5@C will make - hard to see 3!NT not making if pd has @H stopper|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
mc|10|nt|drorp:  I'm being asked about the double of 5@d, it's true that it's not a clear action, or a good action, but maybe he felt like they're making 4@s|pg||
pg||
qx|c6|st||md|4S832HA3DA8753CA98,SKQJ6H84DKT92CK64,ST54HQJ652DQ6CJT2,SA97HKT97DJ4CQ753|sv|e|nt|haans: many rightly i think mean 2nt make it its forcing|pg||
nt|drorp:  surely the pass on 4@h wasn't forcing, so why would a pass on 5@d be?|pg||
nt|haans: AGAIN: Remember: Ace from AKx is a trick one convention only|pg||
nt|sharkey: or as kib suggests - even without @H stopper|pg||
nt|lestergold: game likely to be bid and off in the open room  |pg||
nt|sharkey: think 3 NT other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Much easier to screw up a defence like that than it may seem when we can see all four hands. (He said from bitter experience...)|pg||
nt|haans: i do think Zia said that in one of his books|pg||
nt|hedyg: S obviously thought W had KQ@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@H would have been clearer|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|haans: slam now?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I have the impression NS are not "in tune" this segment - may be my impression is wrong...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ritong: other room having disconnected several times, we do not have comparisons currently|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i disagree with pass by west i put in a dung shovel|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|drorp:  1NT denies 3 spades|pg||
nt|haans: an old transfer :)|pg||
nt|haans: easy to play|pg||
nt|brolucius: South hand is worth about 23 points with the good diamonds. Too good to show 20-22.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: the strong NT version of Multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 4 @d a good bid|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what would you bid then Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: I said a dung shovel|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: (not familiar with that)|pg||
nt|lestergold: a spade if u prefer|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: N/S not in tune in last segment or two either|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jbgood: this looks difficult|pg||
nt|haans: many play that 1nt show 18-19 bal 1@S waiting|pg||
nt|jbgood: not many in Norway, Hans:)|pg||
nt|haans: maybe going to 6nt?|pg||
nt|hedyg: more and more are playing this as showing 20-21|pg||
nt|mdgraham: where are these matches being played, David? |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbgood: doubt that - they are on the diamond route|pg||
nt|haans: at least now :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 22+ they open 2@c and use kokish relays to show 24 +|pg||
nt|lestergold: Lonon?|pg||
nt|lestergold: You obviously never played rubber bridghe with Lisa Shaw|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|jbgood: (I dont know a single one:))|pg||
nt|haans: no know that i rean BIN :)|pg||
nt|drorp:  establishing the spades would work, but he should start with clubs because other wise east can theoretically jump with K@s and play his 2nd heart, and west will have 2 more entries to establish his hearts and set the contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: rdbl - 4 sp - 4 NT |pg||
nt|vinbtech: good lead again|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed - but where in London|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Royal National hotel , London|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks|pg||
nt|vinbtech: but NS will make +400|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i gave up 4 card suit overcalls after a series of playing in unmakeable games at the 4 level|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jbgood: well - he skipped the xx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will find out they are off a key, so should stop in 6@D|pg||
nt|po-s: any other pet names for suits?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: and 2NT openings show both minors weak then|pg||
pc|sT|nt|drorp:  well, he didn't very hard ofcourse|pg||
nt|drorp:  so i think it's over now|pg||
nt|haans: kokish relay rarely needed (you do not have 24+ often)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: nice to watch|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|jbgood: a diamond return might have worked for the defense|pg||
nt|jbgood: job done|pg||
nt|jbgood: does Tundal know he is on the lead?|pg||
nt|haans: minor suit slams harder to find|pg||
nt|ritong: most likely, patience|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this one has merits. It is a good suit, you have a good holding in diamonds, and you cut out a 1@H response  |pg||
nt|ritong: lester in great shape today|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its a downside but its a big downside not getting an oar in when you have a good suit and an opening bid- you sell out to opps too often- you have features tov make up for the ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: lack of the fifth spade|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jbgood: spade does not work|pg||
pc|d3|nt|drorp:  he would be okay with a diamond return, playing the 9, and in control (again has to choose correctly to continue with spades so the defense communication is lost)|pg||
nt|lestergold: depends on which suit they primarily play on|pg||
nt|sharkey: We see @C breaking - but S could also elect to play on @H - doesnt know who has 4th @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: if clubs no problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: if hearts its not so good|pg||
nt|sharkey: easy from here :)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: both H and C reqd 3-3 here ; but H u require some more as well - i guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in hearts you will take two finesses, so you require 3-3 with spilt honours for four tricks |pg||
nt|lestergold: mertis of playing on hearts are that kJ may be on side or they may be split with a 3/3 brak etc- clubs simpy need to be 3/3 or you are fallingt back on miracles in hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if you play clubs you need a 3-3 break|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think its tough at the table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, @HKJ may be both onside - not when people like us are declarer, of course |pg||
nt|lestergold: the mathematicians can work out the precise percentages|pg||
nt|lestergold: any actuaries around here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: E/W play strong club 16+ unbalanced or 17+balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 1D is 3 way 11 -15|pg||
nt|lestergold: Erichsen is avery careful and thouightful player this will send him into a fait old tank|pg||
nt|lestergold: fair old tank|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 1H/S 5 cards usually|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think I go with the 33 break - then I dont need an actuary...|pg||
nt|lestergold: so duck a club for starters |pg||
nt|vinbtech: hope he comes out if it(tank) winningly !|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i must disclose a bias here as my son is on this team|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is the sort of guess you get right on a good day, and wrong on a bad one |pg||
nt|lestergold: so i hope too|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 2@C is a kind of multi|pg||
nt|lestergold: Mike 1 did you do a degree in philosophy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, physics|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Precision style or 5-9 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: sounds like the law of the excluded middle to me|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: oh i did one in pohysics and philosophy believe it or not|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|drorp:  can safely play diamond to 9 now, trying for an overtrick maybe|pg||
nt|lestergold: aslo lead directional a spade overcall on any day in mu view|pg||
nt|lestergold: as spec mentions pard being a passd hand no danger of any overbidding to game|pg||
nt|chick: would you do the same if pard were unpassed?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: more often than you might think :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharkey: Board 1 was a push|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he has made the winning decision but one spec thinks its the wromg play|pg||
nt|vinbtech: well,  i keep it simple - this is a Declarer's problem - i want him to succeed ! If it was a Defender's problem - I want the Defense to Succeed - Simple !|pg||
nt|sharkey: Whe Espen has chosen his path there's no turning back and he'll be +400|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: and on this occasion he mad the play I would have made|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|haans: kokish relay mean 2@C-2@D-2@H = natural or 24+ bal|pg||
nt|lestergold: now east will remove his options playing a heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably its my style|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: buit as he has made his bed he will lie in it|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|haans: and claim|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this premier league  take the place of the trials, am i right?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder why they bother with division 2 then|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is effectively the trials but because of various factors its not the only criterion that will be used by selectors|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and what happens when the teams members change to different teams, as happens|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: partnerships who won silver medals in bejing lasy year ar unlikley to beexcluded from england teamahtever the results of these trials/ or league|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that fact or just your opinion Mike|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|h6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: because players are forking out lots of money to play in the leagues|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: These trials are for Camrose only|pg||
nt|po-s: "unlikely" sounds like an opinion|pg||

nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: brb|pg||
nt|brolucius: A successful spade finesse would give declarer only an eighth trick, so might as well play a heart instead. That would work if East held the @HA and only two clubs.|pg||
nt|lestergold: What did you do with your physics degree Mike?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A thin game with the cards lying very luckily.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much  |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: i taught with mine|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp:  1@h shows exactly 3 hearts i think|pg||
nt|haans: now new big swing?|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H in CR|pg||
nt|lestergold: i out argued most people on most subjects with the other half of my degree|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is odd - South passed a 15-17 NT?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i dont think it ever earned me a penny in anger|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 2@C = precision 2@C or 5 - 9 4+@C 4+ M   !!!|pg||
nt|sharkey: NT Range?|pg||
nt|po-s: and Mike is in no way biassed|pg||
nt|ritong: nah, no way|pg||
nt|lestergold: corse not|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: And Commonwealth games|pg||
nt|ritong: a model for objectivity|pg||
nt|lestergold: ive always wanted to be a model but i was too fat|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: The Earopean team will come from the "training squad"|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose the selectors look at the butler rankings|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: ah|pg||
nt|sharkey: David keeps us on our toes :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep |pg||
nt|Walddk4: The winning team get to play for England in the Camrose Trophy. Come Sunday evening, the bottom two teams will be relegated to Division Two|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah    the training squad   ....|pg||
nt|yo_yo: used to be 3 , now it's 33|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and then do what they like, as ever|pg||
pc|d2|nt|drorp:  aggressive overcall from Aa, with a semi balanced hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: as we see not weak|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 15 - 17|pg||
nt|sharkey: It was never weak...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: ah yes majors has been trasferred|pg||
nt|haans: new addition to the system|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ebu.co.uk/events/?eventid=12  for standings after 4 rounds|pg||
nt|po-s: but "knowing more" sounds interesting. How long does a medal last? Shouldn´t other applicants/candidates be informed?|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 8 pairs last count|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a good point |pg||
pc|c3|nt|drorp:  quick 9 tricks i imagine|pg||
nt|drorp:  a diamond switch can hold it to 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzyr: the real score is 48-46 with Telemark ahead|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jbgood: and spade ace and another spade may give a push|pg||
nt|jbgood: giving away the trump suit, but still a gaining lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold/townsend would not allow weak no trumps on their team they would rule it systematically unsound|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: lol - must have experienced some telephone numbers|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is not the primary reason believe it or not|pg||
nt|lestergold: they ar not frightened of risking tele numbers|pg||
nt|lestergold: the problem for selectors is that very few partnerships as such have much international experience i mean as partnerships altho many have as individuals in previous partnerships|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: partnerships are what is importan to selectors|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|hedyg: very lucky indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is to do with tghe difficulties involved in constructive auctions|pg||
nt|lestergold: weak no trump is a great rabbit killing system|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 2@D opening 6+@D or 5@D 4M 10 - 15|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. Your NT range affects a lot of other areas of bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: its not good enough at the top and not played by many top internationals|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: think some of the top Italian teams play weak NT?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|brolucius: If North had won the second trump, a return to spades might have caused a problem.|pg||
nt|hagz: He has to guess the @s to made this... Or guess @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think @d not enough, he cannot disc 2@ss on 1 @d|pg||
nt|hagz: @c switch now|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|hagz: No, has to guess @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: could have eliminated @cs first|pg||
nt|lestergold: i played weak no trump for thirty years until my son disabused me of it and i would never go back there |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|s2|nt|brolucius: On the face of it, the spade suit is an example of Restricted Choice. K-J or K-10 with South is more likely than J-10. |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is scope for defensive error here|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: great thing about bridge you will always find some great players who bid like lunatics and get away with it|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h5|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: failing to cash their top tricks here unlikely|pg||

nt|haans: but why lead spades|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: look at the bidding by a certain world famous polsh pair|pg||

nt|jbgood: np - you do a great job|pg||
nt|vugraphzyr: ty:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: He did eliminate clubs, as Hedy suggested, but the cards lay unluckily for him.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Liv did he really make his contract?|pg||
nt|hedyg: looked like he lost 2@ss, 1@d and 1@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzyr: 9tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure what happened there|pg||
nt|lestergold: not two off surely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: going 2 down was impossible from that point|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hedyg: result corrected to -1|pg||
nt|hagz: Nice lead, the only lead that causes problems for declarer|pg||
nt|ritong: especially if south falsecards|pg||
nt|ritong: which was very possible|pg||
nt|brolucius: Vulnerable, West might have risked a heavy 3@D on that hand, with so little defence against the majors. But he is NV.|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp:  now a 3@s non forcing should be available|pg||
nt|haans: yes should|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: 3@D stronger with spades|pg||
nt|haans: or this time mabe weak|pg||
nt|drorp:  i don't see where he is stronger :) but that won't stop them from reaching 4@s whatever happens|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|drorp:  5@d goes for 300, but 5@s makes|pg||
nt|haans: as told to me from Norway 3@D is the weaker bid 3@S focing|pg||
nt|haans: multi landy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@D=5+@H, or @S+minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: I am saying that there are players who win bidding absurdly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 3 nt is tempting now - making 12..|pg||
nt|jbgood: or pass|pg||
nt|haans: More INFO from Norway: grebrof: enn 1@s - da ere motsatt - 3@h blir da den svake varianten|pg||
nt|haans: right u r|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk4: 1@H = spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer response|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: for them 2@H had not been forcing|pg||
mb|2D|nt|drorp:  this should end the auction unless south feels advanterous|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H would be enough for most pairs, even if not forcing. It is at least played as constructive nowadays.|pg||
nt|haans: 1 though 2 minds|pg||
nt|hedyg: i like 3@H here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: 3NT in the other room is going it a bit|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 5 cards he might have bid just 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4S has seious problems|pg||
mb|3D|nt|brolucius: South knows that the @HQ and one ace is missing.|pg||
nt|haans: 4@D no optimistic|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW CC at http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2009Brazil/Systems/bermudabowl/norway/groetheim-tundal.pdf|pg||
nt|lestergold: if they play there|pg||
nt|ritong: forrester has opted for game, seems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: playing transfer responses like this, it is a good idea to bid 1M with three cards and 2M with four |pg||
nt|ritong: his other option was 2 NT|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: this could be played in 3N in the open room|pg||
nt|dburn: or to play 1M shows a weak no trump and 1NT shows 18-20|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2 clubs a spade and a dim to lose unforunately for them|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: other table is arild årmot - bjørnar halderaker for telemark, molberg - aa for midt-trøndelag     (from Liv Marit)|pg||
nt|hedyg: @c now?|pg||
nt|brolucius: East would play a higher diamond when holding the @SK.|pg||
nt|hedyg: should be a quick @c though|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - On a good day 3 NT will make - N with 17 HCP and 5 card suit opposite pd's 8 points|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it was a very good 17-count with the five-card club suit |pg||
nt|lestergold: however even with the combijed 25 points and club fit, 9 tricks look difficult here as cards lie|pg||
nt|sharkey: David said 17 3/4?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: wait its cold|pg||
nt|lestergold: im silly|pg||
nt|po-s: What?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as it tells partner immediately what sort of fit you have, which can be important if the auction becomes competitve   |pg||
nt|yo_yo: forrester has cleverly arranged that his partner plays this|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: NS NT range?|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: other pair|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was maxi super maxi for a 1-1 nt but the pips didnt merit an upgrade- a club opebner followed by a 2n rebid would be a slight overbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: this pair play (14) 15 - 17 throughout|pg||
nt|drkvas: hi|pg||
nt|sharkey: Indeed - perhaps Vul you may have upgraded?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Erichsen's pass with an unappetising 8 count was disciplined especially at non vul|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hi Dr.|pg||
nt|lestergold: I would not upgrade north i may have pushed out a try with south vul|pg||
nt|lestergold: as we see the lack of pips inmtermediates in the club suit hwere have been significant|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - E made a good lead and @D9 coming into play|pg||

nt|lestergold: well sorry i hope he isnt but from a commentator's point of view i hope he is!|pg||
nt|ritong: awake or not, tough to see a losing option|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that means that sometimes you have to rebid 1M on a doubleton |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|haans: declare will have 2 spade tricks but ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if he dcides to psafety play the spades rather than cash a and K he would be off that line is of course against the odds as non 3/3 dim breaqk more likely|pg||

nt|brolucius: North's 4@D suggests that he placed South with a better heart suit for his leap to 3@H.|pg||
nt|lestergold: with south vul i may have squeaked out a stayman and an invite|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse of scotland usually significant|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South probably wondering what to do over the "inevitable" 4@S. Little does he know....|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: Slam may be considered here|pg||

nt|lestergold: on another daty ten tricks roll in without breaking sweat|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: With diamonds 3-3, allowing two spade discards and then a spade ruff in the South hand, 6@H is a make.|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H FG I assume after the Multi 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 2@C art FG|pg||
nt|mdgraham: auction is FG|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2 ways or just GF?|pg||
nt|sharkey: some play 2@C GF or invite hand after 1 M opening|pg||
nt|ritong: surprising|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: break or make?|pg||
nt|haans: which suit to finesse?|pg||
nt|ritong: they do not have a tool to show medium 5@s 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|hedyg: 2@s showing a good raise in @H we guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: unless 2@h showed both majors - which is slighly unlikely|pg||
nt|jbgood: result link: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=2010div_1|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w have close to a roland slam as cards lie better stay here in 4h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West's BBO username is "pitiful" - a play on words for the Reese description of fourth suit forcing - "the pitiful crutch" |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The two hands fit very well. Even then, you need a 3-3 diamond break. So, not a practical slam deal really.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a dim lead would create small probs|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes best lead|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, this system allows to know immediately if opener has tolerance for @ss, assuming no interference by opps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: at last Forrester gets his hands on the cards|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chick: can 4@H make NS?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: entries to dummy limited|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||
nt|haans: discard will tell as little as possible|pg||
nt|haans: 10-14 are more common than garbage 2 3-7 hcp|pg||
nt|sharkey: if S ducks first @C  may have problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: erichsen must duck to have a chance of beating|pg||
nt|vinbtech: surely u mean Fifth Suit Forcing, and not Fourth, Mike? |pg||
nt|lestergold: not easy|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he cannot seriously thinkl that declarer has played a  club to an unsupported K at trick 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 2@H 6+ @H no other 4 cd suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: fourth, I believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 2@h 6@H's no other 4 cd suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, a surprising @CA |pg||
nt|lestergold: one way or another declarer will now lose a heart and a spade and make|pg||
nt|vinbtech: i think Crouch devised the Fifth Suit Forcing convention |pg||
nt|lestergold: well of course he has to duck smoothly but I would have thought a player of erichsen's undoubted calibre would normally have found this duck|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Crouch has devised a lot of things|pg||
