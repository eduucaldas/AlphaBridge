nt|Walddk2: Why did he have to guess? He made a unilateral decision|pg||
nt|jallerton: true, but the 2@c chosen in the other room could easily have become the final contract from E's point of view|pg||
nt|bobh1: E might have suspected he had that problem and covered him by bidding 4@ss|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3@d would have suggested doubt about his @d stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT told partner that he wanted to play that contract whether East had three spades or not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is not negotiable in my view|pg||
