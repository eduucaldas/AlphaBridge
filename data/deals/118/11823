mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: i remember playing this system once|pg||
nt|athene: and you only needed to learn the responses to 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: because that's all that ever comes up|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|haans: i did never play that went to Carrot |pg||
nt|athene: the defence should just get four hearts, @SA, @DA here for 1nt tick|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: of course declarer could do better double-dummy by rising with @HK and playing spades|pg||
nt|athene: killing south's entry whilst the hearts are blocked|pg||
nt|athene: but no reason to find that|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|athene: not a bad shot, with two heart tricks in the bag, trying to set up a lot of diamonds|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: but perhaps it was better to return partner's suit - 1nt will often have good diamonds in the EW system|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: so, we have seen twice in a row now, how hard it is to defend 1nt|pg||
pc|hK|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: especially when you don't really know much about declarer's suits|pg||

pc|c8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can throw him in with the diamond|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|athene: west is known to have @D10 and two spades left|pg||
nt|athene: diamond exit was completely safe for 11|pg||
mc|10|nt|haans: but if you are wrong you are very wrong |pg||
pg||

nt|athene: you can't go down since there are only spades left :)|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|haans: but if you are wrong = kicked out of the team|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: i am told you can't go down since you have nine tricks already of course|pg||
nt|athene: that is a minor point i missed :)|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|haans: :( sorry :)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: now EW are on murky territory, i think|pg||
nt|haans: tricky bidding|pg||
nt|athene: does 3@D say "i was going to pass 3@D if you had rebid that, showing no major"?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: east obviously thinks so|pg||
nt|haans: 3@D was not good bid|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: with good chances for double stops in both majors and a club stop, you might just decide with that east hand "if i am going to play at the 3-level, might as well play in game"|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: but perhaps passing the double showed a club stopper|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|athene: wow, declarer did well (or was lucky) to get the trumps right|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|athene: with spades 6-2, don't you play north for the @DJ?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|athene: so that, together with her club suit for the double of 3@C, perhaps swings the view in the trump suit|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|h3|pg||

nt|haans: 4nt = quant?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: declarer doesn't have time to play on both black suits, after this threatening lead|pg||
nt|haans: one of the very best bids are NT over NT is NT that is 4nt over 3nt is quant|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|athene: welcome appearance of the @SJ; no squeeze, with west discarding after dummy, so just 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c6|pc|d9|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: if you play strong club, and 2@C shows 6+ cards, and you don't have any special bid for 3-suiter with short diamonds, you have to open 1@D on a lot of hands!|pg||
nt|haans: blue clubs open 1@H canape|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: the 1@D opener on its own wouldn't stop south leading a diamond, but maybe when east has "raised" them it will|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|athene: that would have to be 2@C for east i guess but i still prefer it to 1@D|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: but did he open light :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: now he can win @SQ and duck a diamond|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: then win @SA, finesse diamonds, make 4 diamonds, 2 spades, @CA at very least|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: a club lead would have put him under way more pressure|pg||

nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: you have a point there|pg||

nt|athene: west could have bid 2@C over 1nt if they play that as majors|pg||
nt|athene: or east could pull the double to 2@C|pg||
nt|athene: but was probably scared if he did that, partner goes back to 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: and you play 2@DX for -1100 :)|pg||
