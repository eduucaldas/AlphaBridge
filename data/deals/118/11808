nt|Walddk2: In the closed room, hearts were mentioned for the first time at the 6-level|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|brolucius: That was the right level to mention them.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Although David Burn had indicated hearts|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|d|nt|janm: Might be similar here :). CR started with a strong 1@c, here strong 2@c; but S isn't as willing to bid over 2@c|pg||
nt|jallerton: How many @d will South bid?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, 2@H looks best. No reason to bid 3@H.|pg||
nt|janm: I would have said more than none :)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4@D is a splinter bid.|pg||
nt|janm: That was in answer to how many diamonds by S|pg||
nt|janm: Room for E to ask for keycards and then bid 6@h when one is missing|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: South needs two good cards from partner. No doubt West would bid again over a sign-off anyway.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, a good auction. Well done.|pg||
nt|jallerton: E/W not a regular partnership so they have done well to sort this out|pg||
nt|janm: I'd have thought 4@s was a keycard ask, but I guess not - must have been a cue bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bowles trusted his partner to raise with the as-yet-unshown trump ace.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Nothing to the play - even I could manage this|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, East can't bid 6 - could easily be off the 2 red aces|pg||
nt|janm: "unshown" specifically, but surely 4@d showed SOMETHING|pg||
nt|brolucius: My mother would have made it, since two rounds of spades stand up before she draws trumps.|pg||
mc|12|nt|janm: But why not bid 5@d to say he really wants to bid 6? Or bid Keycard earlier|pg||

mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: A fast and efficient auction to the right contract, in spite of Garvey trying to put a spanner in the works|pg||

nt|janm: But from W's hand, that isn't how they're playing it; or do you think E wasn't sure?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: 1@D possible as a nuisance call.|pg||
nt|jallerton: I suspect EW have not discussed the sequence|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A lot of inference an unfamiliar partnership might struggle with - I think they did well|pg||
nt|brolucius: Usual to cue-bid in the cheaper of the opponents' suits to show a strong raise of partner's suit.|pg||
nt|jallerton: I ask again: how many @d?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|cuttysark: No too many - partner is a passed hand|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|janm: EW being more aggressive with 9 diamonds than NS were on the last hand with 11 :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4@D is more of a tactical bid, perhaps hoping to push N/S too high.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|cuttysark: Seems to have succeeded - they are 3 levels higher thn the other room:)|pg||
nt|jallerton: West can play @d9 as a suit pref signal here|pg||
nt|janm: Which it did, although I think 4 was also too high, despite the CR result|pg||
nt|brolucius: A triumph for West. His 4@D has worked excellently.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's @D9 will be suit preference, since there are no more diamond tricks to take.|pg||
nt|janm: Either a spade or a second diamond will prevent N from getting rid of the second spade loser on the heart Q|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html  for standings after round 5 of 9. |pg||
nt|brolucius: An attitude or count signal would be entirely pointless, so obvious to play S/P even if you have not discussed it.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The spade can't look tempting, but he should trust his partner|pg||
nt|janm: Just has to avoid a heart or club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Would be necessary if you swap @CJ and @CK.|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Hello Frances|pg||
nt|finch: Good evening.|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: Sandqvist has previously had a lot of trouble against the NS methods, but he may be getting used to them by now|pg||
nt|lestergold: Frances do you have any bias here?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Bill!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: I may have some personal bias, but I try not to show it when I commentate|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm I thought Burn might put one in at these colours|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|athene: Are EW playing Polish Club?|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: A 1@S opening more likely than 1@D from West, but less tempting playing 5-card majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: EW play Polish club.  NS play a strong club method called Submarine club including transfer openings|pg||
nt|athene: He can double this now, surely?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Do you agree that W should not have passed?|pg||
nt|lestergold: totally routine takeout|pg||
nt|finch: I can't feel very strongly about it. The West hand was not exactly a thing of beauty.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|fabsayc: should finesse diamonds immediately|pg||
nt|athene: Multi 2@D from South I guess - will North look for game?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|jbgood: that puts E in a fix|pg||
nt|jbgood: he cannot double in fear of 4 @s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east has no bid, or rather his only bid is "no bid"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agreeJon! and rather clear when partner has passed|pg||
nt|jbgood: the oldie "no bid" surely applies|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless he has a "penalty double card"|pg||
nt|jbgood: in the bidding box?|pg||
nt|jbgood: i really cannot see why he is thinking - at all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I don´t like this kind of pause - perhaps the VU operator. |pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: East's long pause:-)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|finch: South has a maximum weak two with very good spade pips - take away the @H10, fro example, and game is poor|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4H looks like a pretty good conttract|pg||
nt|finch: Certainly with these two hands you want to be in game|pg||

nt|ralfwil: can be computer problems - or?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With all cards visible - yes, but difficult|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: If you look for game with North's hand, you are going down at the 3-level a fair bit when partner has a bad hand and things aren't kind|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|janm: Different strategies from the two N's here, or maybe different systems, but the same contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H is not ideal, with so much defence. But it has not cost anything.|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|jallerton: strong @c N/S in other room|pg||
nt|brolucius: Normally you would start with 2NT, to show at least a sound raise to 3@H. And then bid 4@H. It's true that an immediate 4@H may deter a sacrifice, but you don't mind that so much ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: when you have K/A/K.|pg||

pc|h3|nt|jallerton: that's the best lead|pg||

nt|Walddk2: clubs 3-3 helps a lot|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, only one diamond ruff required, as Liz points out.|pg||
nt|janm: But repeated heart leads will force the long club hand. I'd rather be in 2 than 4 :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: I suppose N cannot play a @h when he is in, and if South wins the first @s, the suit is blocked|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this heart lay-out it is often right to discard from dummy. Not when you have three trump losers! |pg||

nt|fabsayc: simpson was the only one who did not have a clear charge, although 2nt rather than double was suspect|pg||
nt|athene: with scattered values and a poor suit, no reason to bid - he doesn't want to encourage a heart lead if Garvey has a natural lead in a different suit|pg||
nt|finch: I agree with Cooke no point in opening the South hand. You don't necessarily want a heart lead, and it's unlikely to be your hand.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|finch: In the Polish club style, West can be either way round in the minors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: as cards lie i think its impossible to beat 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: so e/w turn for a =170?|pg||
nt|athene: usually, holding the top three trumps gives the defence enough control to set something up|pg||
nt|athene: a ruff or something|pg||

nt|athene: Garvey takes an aggressive view - like Cooke a moment ago, he does have a 7-loser hand, but there, Cooke was in a 5-4 fit, not just a 5-3 fit|pg||

mb|3S|mb|d|nt|janm: What's 1NT? Artificial or he just didn't have a good bid with this shape and strength?|pg||

nt|athene: in side suits|pg||
nt|athene: but this is just normal unless you are in such a sound contract it's a case of "draw trumps, claim"|pg||
nt|finch: He needed to organise two ruffs in dummy. Cashing one top spade is possible, but two wasn't|pg||

nt|janm: I'm not sure whether it's a 2@s raise or Drury (out of comp); that's why I thought it was interesting |pg||

nt|brolucius: I don't like Drury on a Q-high hand. It should be more like a 10-count, shouldn't it? |pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: What would 2NT mean on East's second turn (board 11)?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 6-4 in the minors, and let 3@C be 5-5? But then you could have bid 2NT over 1@S, so perhaps 2NT should be natural|pg||
