mb|2N|mb|p|nt|othered1: ty|pg||
mb|3C|nt|othered1: since south bid @C, I guess that stops the suit enough to ignore all that support|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@c forces 3@D?|pg||
nt|othered1: Can anyone translate this?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Slam is horrible and should be avoided|pg||
nt|othered1: if Roland thinks slam is horrible . . .   But doesn't t his meet your 12 percent criterion?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 11 opposite 18/19 is not enough for slam usually except on distributional hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As it is, you can play hearts without loser, but then you still have a big problem in clubs|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|othered1: @Ckxx onside and @S split would be enough.  Maybe without @S split as well.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, you need clubs to produce three tricks|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: decided all alone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then you won't have to care about hearts if spades split|pg||
nt|othered1: somehow it feels like this is a deserved spot on that bidding.   Could make a better evaluation if I had a clue what the auction means.  even if 3@C is relay to 3@D, can't south ...|pg||
nt|othered1: override with AQJX in support of responder's suit?|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The South hand is not as great as it looks. 4333 is a minus|pg||
nt|hedyg: as in: you want to play slam? you play it!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now, if Levin can avoid the club lead  ... sure he can|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They bid them and supported them|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree that south's isn't a good 18 and they shouldn't get there.  But south's auction, if relatively natural, didn't help.  I think it's easier to get to bad slam if south had ...|pg||
nt|othered1: made a strong @S raise.|pg||
nt|othered1: or 19|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I make it 19, but I know what you mean|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: I guess this can make on partial elimination, but you need to guess very well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pull trumps, eliminate hearts, cash two top diamonds and play a club to the 10 spot|pg||
nt|othered1: Other room's auction was interesting as well, where north didn't continue after a game bid by south.  I would have bid again as north.|pg||
nt|othered1: But I wouldn't have bid 4@S as south|pg||

nt|Walddk2: On second thought, that finesse was an illusion|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Declarer did not finesse I am told|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Please UNDO, Yarden|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: 3 rounds of spades, ending in dummy. Take the heart finesse, cash two diamonds, ending in hand|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then play a club|pg||
nt|hedyg: N is declarer|pg||

nt|vugraphzap: Sorry, I didnt see all the cards. as for now, Dummy has: J@S, K@H, Q52@C.|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he has ruffed a @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fine, so he did take the heart finesse|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Back to that slam. Ruffing that diamond cannot gain as I see it|pg||
nt|othered1: Slam down will be a great result for EW, imp-wise, and illustrates the difference in luck factor between usual matchpoints and imp pairs.  Here boards are not all equal.|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|athene: it might sometimes when partner judges not to use it; it might also wrongside hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: An excellent 6@C now|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: If you have blinders on as to the rest of the shape.  Too good for play in @H opposite a good fit for a 2N opener|pg||
nt|athene: but probably it's pretty close between 2@D and 1@H - i doubt either one is going to lose imps significantly over a period of time|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|hedyg: 2@c forcing inverted minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Even with a 4-0 trump split, this can make. Declarer can reverse the dummy (two heart ruffs)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: tough slam to reach, near perfect mesh of cards|pg||
nt|othered1: Not the easiest slam to get to, but missing it is a chargable crime|pg||
nt|athene: in theory, you have all the room in the world after an inverted minor raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well what alternative to 3nt by levin?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: but if you don't have a *lot* of system for the followups, you just flounder around a lot of the time|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: but if you  play strong NT openings, you need a complex structure over the raise to take advantage of the space|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT denies A or K @s|pg||
nt|athene: because no-one knows if it's a slam auction or a choice-of-games auction|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But since this is IMPs, it must be safe to bypass 3NT and perhaps settle for 5@C if you lack controls. Not a big deal if you do. Matchpoints would be a different ballgame|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think from 3@d on it is slamtry|pg||
nt|othered1: good point|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with these auctions is, "play 3nt or in the minor?" decisions are very different from "play 5 or 6 of the minor?" decisions|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well at this point i think levin should bid slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Format is IMPs Across the Field|pg||
nt|othered1: As this is imps, 5@C is a possible contract, so east willhave to take definitive action here.  At matchpoints. some really press for slam when beyond 3N|pg||
nt|hedyg: his pd has bid everything in sight|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4c to me shows a pure hand, i.e. with heart king|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and no jacks, all working cards|pg||

nt|Walddk2: @SK and two in diamonds (finesse)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gib is now taking diamond finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: Gib plays DD|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he takes a diamond finesse, he only needs one ruff|pg||

nt|fabsayc: no ruff needed with diamond finesse|pg||

nt|roswolf: looks like it|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|cuttysark: It is suggested that East fell for the old -'lead trump against a Grand Slam' chestnut.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well now we will see how north tackles the trumps|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: curious that both teams bid grand missing the trump Q -- |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|santyclz: Oh well.  6@cs is a great contract, only the 4-0 break makes it difficult.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|vugraphzan: and now......|pg||
nt|xenya: both will make i expext|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suppose North's void makes it hard to introduce keycard|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: the future of the match lies in the hand of one Ron Pachtman |pg||
nt|cuttysark: No pressure, as they say|pg||
nt|roswolf: well east should be short in diamonds for his bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: if he goes doen it's probable that Poland will win it all, |pg||
nt|vugraphzan: remember - they need more than 38|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: E showed long spades, so the finesse is percentage play|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|s2|pg||

nt|vugraphzan: declarer looks at both defenders which is smiling|pg||
nt|cuttysark: No particular reason - if East has led a doubleton heart they both have 8 cards in the majors...|pg||
nt|roswolf: he will go for glory|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: nice drama we have here today :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: declarer still thinking of course|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1st against 2nd|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|athene: of course, 3@s is a stretch, but south follows the usual principle of allowing yourself to be pushed up one level to show support after pre-emption|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: the heart goes on the fourth diamond so this is getting claimed very soon|pg||
nt|athene: as soon as declarer finds that trumps aren't ridiculous, i would imagine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This movement was devised for chess in the late 20's by the Danish engineer J.H. Monrad, but was soon afterwards adopted for bridge tournaments|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can handle 5-0 trumps even|pg||
nt|hedyg: as soon as Levin plays the @d his pd asked for?|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt the @C3 was asking for a diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely he could afford a higher @c|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably club 3 just shows the king|pg||
nt|athene: yes, upside down attitude i assume|pg||
nt|hedyg: your pd bids 3@H and leads A@C....you dont play a preferential card when you have 6?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's upside down suit-preference :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cant he have two clubs?|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe :P|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: not that there is much point signalling attitude, i don't think, because if partner has led from @CAx and it's wrong, you have just blown the whole hand anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so he might as well continue them|pg||
