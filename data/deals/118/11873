mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: http://www.ebu.co.uk/events/?eventid=12  for standings |pg||

mb|3D|an| |nt|mdgraham: no double this time|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the worst distribution and force for East after passed hand :) 2Nt seam the best reply|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: perhaps fortunate that @hK is well placed - this was not the right side to play the hand from|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@s will perhaps calm N down|pg||
nt|haans: 6@C played by North spade lead harder to find|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bridge_one: East can establish 2@s, so np to make 3Nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence cannot establish the diamonds and the KH no time|pg||
nt|lestergold: and declarer has nine tricks without the qH|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|mdgraham: I admire South's restraint. He has obviously seen North's opening bids before|pg||
nt|peachy: very nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Can anyone tell me what was wrong with the J@D?  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: was thinking that - odd to lead 4th from J109xx|pg||
nt|haans: @H lead not an option|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: not textbook for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: well wont lead a singleton might be reluctant to bang an ace down and trump leads against small slams are not usually effective|pg||
mb|6C|nt|lestergold: maybe Towsend felt important to tell pard that lead was from length with entries|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: thk|pg||
nt|garnetts: Was wondering if I had been missing something for years---don't all yell a brain at me |pg||
nt|garnetts: Bet he plays the K@H |pg||
nt|bridge_one: finding Qx in @d at the partner, and A8xx at opps, the lead J lose one time - alternative, finding 8x in @D at the partner |pg||
nt|haans: yes spade it will be |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: they are playing a strong jump shift by responder, a rarity these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: you were half right|pg||
nt|dburn: well, leading low will cost if declarer has all of AKQ8 with four-card length in one hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i expect so|pg||
nt|lestergold: more by elimination than anything else|pg||
nt|haans: good slam|pg||
nt|chick: J984 isn't much better to lead from than the other choices though|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep has a lot of chances|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||

nt|haans: Hassett did not have any good lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: against a no trump opener and a slam that was slowly struggled to without south showing a particuklarly long side suit, i think Ad was a punt lead|pg||
mb|1N|nt|othered1: guess so|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suspect EW have a gadget for most things|pg||
nt|chick: by punt, you mean giveup?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|lestergold: how not how did they fail to come to 2 spades 2 hearts and a club declarer had only 3 dims 2 spades  2 hearts and a club without giving up a club trick|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.ebu.co.uk/events/?eventid=12  for standings after 6 rounds of 7|pg||

nt|haans: we have all done worse|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was tough for sure sometimes you have anace and king to cash or else but that wopuld be a bit of an insult to this partnership|pg||
nt|chick: yes, I don't think the A was that much worse than spade from J98x, just unlucky this time|pg||
nt|lestergold: they bid their way there carefully and were not likelyto have two quick diamond losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: I beg to disagree on that|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: was possibly down 2, now maybe 1|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|peachy: I was off by 1...|pg||
nt|haans: jump to 6@C did mean i have @D covered|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: I'll back making, if he doesn't lose too many trumps too early|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as long as clubs are 3-2, he can handle 3-1 spades  |pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course they have guaranteed diamond cover thats the point|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may have needed a heart switch there, rather than the club|pg||
nt|chick: hadn't they guaranteed cover in all suits?|pg||
nt|haans: 4@C que no @D que|pg||
nt|haans: sry 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but in the cas o dims east knows that the cover is seond round - whereas in spades cover may be only first round while still holding the ace of dims|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: declarer having a big think now|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are times for leading an unsupported ace against a small slam and times when its ill advisewd|pg||
nt|haans: we all agree to that|pg||
nt|chick: if only we had a way to know which is right when )|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: Tom now in deep thought|pg||
nt|chick: I wish we could have a tape recording of the thoughts :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: he may be best to play a diamond and let declarer struggle on as there are problems with lub losers as well as hearts|pg||
nt|haans: if clubs + hearts want he decl to do?|pg||
nt|lestergold: if townsend plays dim is not declarer without recourse?|pg||
nt|dburn: not exactly|pg||

nt|lestergold: wont gethit in 3 probably will in four|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after Dbl by North (points) East can bid prudent|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: @D  and @S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
nt|garnetts: Still kinda of fun to do some chain jerking as East|pg||
nt|bridge_one: overall if they use weak michael's in overcall|pg||
nt|lestergold: east wont want vul to risk 3H all pass when 4 is making|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 3@h is sufficient to give the hand at West ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we await with tenterhooks to see whose chains get jerked probably us commentators in the end|pg||
nt|garnetts: Try 2@D run to 2@S etch via 2NT build up a momentum|pg||
nt|mdgraham: won't want to give NS a shot at 500 when it is possible that they cannot make game - as here |pg||
nt|bridge_one: knowing @S @C 3@h means closed suit, game depending on hight cards out|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: very long thk|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold/townsend may have heard all this before|pg||
nt|lestergold: long thinks against gold are not winning tactics|pg||
nt|lestergold: he specialises in mind reading|pg||
nt|chick: we'll see who chickens out first :)|pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|othered1: 4@S may be tough, even if they don't get @H ruff.|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has to ruff a dim and then has toplay a club away from q then left with heart loser at the end|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh hes gone for a real chain jerker|pg||
nt|dburn: or perhaps he has just bid his longest suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: sadly not |pg||
nt|garnetts: but it is quite safe --he might even make it |pg||
nt|lestergold: no perhaps about it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H is a tactic bid, waiting ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: For what exactly|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h is an attempt to play in two hearts - there isn't anything tactical about it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this could be passed out and inm the fullness of time Hassett will be more delighted than he may immnediately realise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if west keep same cards without A in @d 2@H is made !|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if West has shown diamonds and spades, he doesn't have much of a problem here, imho - either 2@H is to play or it isn't|pg||
nt|lestergold: for that observation Geogio u get a medal|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bridge_one: 2@H to play, ok, but impossible the partner could bid anythink with A in @S and A in @D|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear to what extent this auction is forcing on North|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold's turn to tank|pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose North has to bid now |pg||
nt|mdgraham: if indeed it is forcing at all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Doubt South will go on over 5@C - he will be more afraid of 6@C making|pg||
nt|lestergold: i may have missed something please explain David|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: so 2@H is a tactical bid, hoping opps bid anything to can rebid 3@h after|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think so|pg||
mb|4C|nt|dburn: even if West did have both @sA and @dA, 4@h might still not make if he had a heart void|pg||
nt|garnetts: Double should promise another bid most of the time --unless they bid game in my view|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n meaning i dont know what to bid but i have something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting - why not pass 2NT? |pg||
nt|dburn: 2NT is natural, and Hassett should have passed it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because thik South wouldn't pass 2Nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not as if yuo don't have a good lead...|pg||
nt|othered1: did the double really accomplish anything?|pg||
nt|haans: looks like easy slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well we didnt predict this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, so ou can defend 3NT instead|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he will pass this|pg||
nt|lestergold: now surelty pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however better to counterplay 3Nt that 2Nt :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: well I'll be ............................|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hornswoggled?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem is: West keep a @h or he is void ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not unreasonable for towsend to think Gold has a heart guard here|pg||
nt|dburn: it doesn't much matter, since East is on lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it got hearts into the picture, I suppose |pg||
nt|othered1: and then partner waits for additional definition at a high leve.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I must say  that 2@c is rather modest in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Good lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: so e/w make 3N and score 500|pg||
nt|haans: irens now in lead|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: no 4@D cue|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: but I wouldn't complain about any judgment on the way to the fine 5@C|pg||

nt|lestergold: but west needs to work that out|pg||
nt|chick: he can see 6 likely tricks in the dummy|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: however there is also the fact that the 3d bid by east meant that townsend could not show just how good his support was|pg||

nt|ralfwil: no slam yet after 17 boards|pg||
mb|1C|an| |mb|4H|nt|lestergold: even so its not a game force hand opposite A Gold overcall which at these colours does little more than confirm its not a misdeal|pg||

pc|c7|nt|lestergold: both had cambridge degrees in beer consumption i think|pg||

nt|mdgraham: another major swing to Hassett - 6@H made on board 15|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not Burn---older than that-but I am not telling--wasn't me either |pg||
nt|mdgraham: spade lead into the AKJ|pg||

nt|garnetts: pretty unlucky lead a trump is unattractive against six |pg||
