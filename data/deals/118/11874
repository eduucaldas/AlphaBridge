pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: lucky lie of the cards, though. Diamond finesse onside and 2-2 trumps |pg||

nt|lestergold: 4d woulod have helped maybe Coyle as a little ashamed of his 2 over 1 response but he was a passed hand and i do agree he could have afforded the cue|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, 4@D may be taken as a high-card control, rather than a singleton, perhaps|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|an|15-17|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|lestergold: either way it would be music to Simpson'sears|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and what is the difference this time?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: none this time, but @DK may be more use than a shortage. Depends on style, really. |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well 2h /2s the probable limits here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder what 3@D was? Bergen raise? Fit-jump?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3s can be made double dummy|pg||

nt|lestergold: i do not see the downside in showing the hearts- partner cant raise hearts without 4 and with a weakish hand will in most cases revert toi spades in any case unless he has someting ...|pg||
