nt|Walddk2: Meanwhile, I can tell you what a Yarborough is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A hand with no card higher than a nine spot. The term is derived from Lord Yarborough of England, who offered a wager with odds of 1,000 pounds to one against the chance of any ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: player having such a holding. The actual chance of any player holding a hand with no card higher than a nine has been mathematically equated to 1,827 to 1|pg||

nt|Walddk2: That would likely show an unbalanced hand in their system|pg||
