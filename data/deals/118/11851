mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 1NT semi-forcing (2@c would be Drury)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect 3C-3S-3N|pg||
nt|brolucius: We sometimes hear the dreadful word 'semi-forcing' to describe such 1NT bids. Oh dear, Jeffrey has used it. |pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: I have to agree with David for a change (we agree twice a year)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either a bid is forcing or it's not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: equal knocks?|pg||
nt|brolucius: The traditional raise of 1@S to 3@S is also semi-forcing. Half the time partner accepts and bids 4@S.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i prefer to play 1N as semi-nonforcing|pg||
nt|bobh1: semi-forcing is slightly different from non-forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 'semi-forcing' does not exist ion my opinion|pg||

nt|brolucius: A well deserved swing to Hinden, anyway.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a reason behind the distinction in nomenclature -- what is called "semiforcing" is not made with the same range of hands as a traditional NF 1N response. the problem is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that the term chosen "semiforcing" is a bit of an oxymoron|pg||

nt|bobh1: opening light is popular isn't it?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps, though if E passes it would be normal i think for EW to reach game, via P-P-1S-2C-3C and with 6 LTC i think W would go to game|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: is the pass by N forcing now that S has bid 3D?|pg||

pc|s5|nt|bobh1: his choices amount to masterminding|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree, as do several specs, that S should bid on -- with these black suit holdings he should not be terribly afraid that opps can make 4S -- anyway they have stopped in 3 so why ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: assume they will bid 4?|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact the delayed 4@H might persuade E/W that it was a dubious prospect and they should not sacrifice.|pg||

mb|1H|nt|bobh1: 6@h needs a @d guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|marlowepi: i did more than hint. i think after 2C, which didnt show much, N is worth 3D over 2H. S could have a mountain|pg||

nt|jallerton: that made it easy to get to the excellent slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: But 3@D doesn't show the heart support. If South has a mountain he can go on over the jump to 4@H.|pg||

nt|brolucius: East may think he has done enough at this point, but they will get to six anyway. No, East has cue-bid past game.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 3S was a splinter, E has to love his hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: Surely West has enough with @HAKQ|pg||
nt|bobh1: W might have liked to have blackwood avail but the way they open a grand is out of the question|pg||
nt|brolucius: East can visualise two five-card suits, the @DA and a diamond ruff, giving 12 tricks on relatively few points.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E knows that W is a big favorite to hold club king, so his source of tricks makes up for his lack of a 4th heart|pg||
nt|bobh1: so he should just bid 6@h eventually|pg||
nt|jallerton: Why does he need Blackwood?  East cued 4@c then did not cue 4@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think they should both bid 6H simultaneously:)|pg||
nt|bobh1: so what's he thinking about?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: whether 6@H is semi-forcing or not|pg||
nt|brolucius: West has heard everything, including a denial of the @SA, so clear to bid 6@H now.|pg||
nt|bobh1: surely not 5@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has done full justice to his values, some would have bid less strongly. He could not justify raising a slow 5@H to 6@H.  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps they have recently agreed to a new form of RKC and W is wondering whether this is a good time to practice it since he knows he is going to 6H regardless|pg||
nt|jallerton: perhaps wondering if possible to offer choice of strains, sometimes 6minor may be better|pg||
nt|jallerton: but 5NT may be grand slam force here|pg||
nt|brolucius: That way lies disaster. No-one ever went bust from making obvious bids.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well he neednt fear getting too high if 5N is takjen as GSF|pg||
nt|brolucius: He may need to know how partner has taken it, though.|pg||
mb|5N|nt|bobh1: anything other than 6@h might be construed as some kind of grand slam try|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i dont know what the chpoice of strains would be. they have bid no strain but hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: There will be muted applause for them reaching the excellent 6@H, since they messed around at the end.|pg||
