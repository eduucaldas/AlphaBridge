pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bobh1: W had 5 lousy @s and very good @ds so i don't think 3n was wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he wanted to know if partner had three spades, he could have asked. He did not, so East must pass 3NT|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|bobh1: the problem with jump shift rebids by opener is you jam your own auction|pg||
nt|bobh1: W had to guess whether his @ds or his @s were more relevant|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well that does happen, it is true. but the converse problem is festering in 2C with 3 games cold|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did he have to guess? He made a unilateral decision|pg||
nt|jallerton: true, but the 2@c chosen in the other room could easily have become the final contract from E's point of view|pg||
nt|bobh1: E might have suspected he had that problem and covered him by bidding 4@ss|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3@d would have suggested doubt about his @d stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT told partner that he wanted to play that contract whether East had three spades or not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is not negotiable in my view|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@d suggest doubt about strain, doubt over @d stopper is only one possibility|pg||

pc|d4|nt|lestergold: howeevr cards fairly favourable here for decl;arer|pg||
nt|eggy: The spade position, coupled with teh DA should mean that the ruff won't help though, in practice|pg||
