nt|Walddk2: You have about a million bids between 3@S and 6@S. Why the rush?|pg||
nt|lesrays: can't understand the urgency, unless she is tired:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be 4@c instead 3@S would give more informations (obliged short in @C, so may be void)|pg||
nt|haans: missing 2 controls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but she never gave partner the chance to show her club void|pg||
