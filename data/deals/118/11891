nt|ritong: yes, that s the price for unfortunate grands vulnerable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and undeserved, one feels|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: however, it is not yet a crime to be lucky at the bridge table. |pg||
nt|gracelin: NS play very weak 1NT opening, so with 15HCP, it's 1D.|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly not, the point is the way you get lucky|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ritong: for example, getting a perfect system hand can be considered as a lucky strike|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzax: NS play Prec|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gracelin: 3D looks like a lucky make with the favorable spade position.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: getting a perfect system hand can depend on how much work you have done on your system  |pg||
nt|ritong: punting blindly is a bit less convincing, i d say|pg||

nt|othered1: and maybve 4@S|pg||
nt|ritong: west seems to have a balanced hand, declarer might well get @cs right|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sunsamvar: both have to have the @C fin and in the case of 3-1 break the 10 to fall|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South's bidding sounds constructive - North will go on|pg||
nt|gracelin: just repeat the finesse when C10 dropped in first round|pg||
nt|ritong: he seems to have a balanced hand because he did not compete when raised|pg||
nt|vugraphzax: N is thinking.....|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gracelin: a choice between 3NT and 5C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yes, 3@D would have been awkward for North |pg||

mb|1S|nt|gracelin: 4H looks cold to me.  Dummy has enough entries to establish long Diamonds|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: even if u lose to the @HQ|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|ritong: i m told " everything the same" about previous board|pg||
nt|ritong: i disagree|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ritong: could be K10x and stiff 8 with east|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: these guys certainly make life difficult for opps with aggressive interventions|pg||
nt|gracelin: West maybe worth a 4S raise over the double|pg||
nt|ritong: then, starting with @c J makes a (huge) difference|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: true west might make a vul sacrifice :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: starting CJ only cater for a singleton C8 with East, not the percentage play.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why not just bid a direct 4@S, if you intend to do so anyway?  |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|ritong: yes, but as we said, west is likely balanced|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a spec points out that "A direct 4S would make it a lot more difficult".|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ritong: and, if @c J is covered, you can check his number of @ss rejoining dummy|pg||
nt|gracelin: but West still achieve the par result.  I am sure Denis Sacul will make 4H if allowed to play.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i agree Patrick|pg||
nt|othered1: Movie doesn't provide details on how south went -2 in CR|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: must have tried very hard :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzax: S is thinking...|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: with North holding @HK, @CA, and @DK, it doesn't really matter what South does  |pg||

nt|gracelin: otherwise south can ruff the 3rd Diamond for 500|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|mb|r|nt|sunsamvar: will you open the west hand ?|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2 rounds of spade are ok for entry, After club lead, a cross ruff maybe needed|pg||
nt|ritong: east looking for trouble|pg||
nt|othered1: In CR, north is said to open and play 2@D.  What was that?|pg||
nt|ritong: redouble is the best way to get things complicated, it should be used only with pure shape or pure strength|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe he thinks that because West opened, he has an openoing hand |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|gracelin: North has a modern Precision 2D opening|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|othered1: but south wouln't pass, would he?|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Anyone play west's pass over redouble to show interest in defending?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: NS in the other room have not exactly covered themselves in glory these two deals   |pg||
nt|ritong: imo, bidding anything over redouble shows a shaped and relatively weak opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: but again, i m not a fan of redouble, so my view can be biased a bit|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|othered1: but west's first pass pretty much said the same thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: I am totally with you, Henri|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now south under pressure|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i am not a fan of the opening from West|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's an opening if they play Precision.|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't open west, either, but with 2.5 quick tricks, it's a very sound opening by today's standards|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't like the redouble, too. I am bidding 1H over the double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Well, North opened a similar hand on the first board, and did EW out of a vulnerable game  |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: cluck cluck|pg||
nt|ritong: normal, with void|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ritong: his problem was rather "do i bid game or not" i guess|pg||
nt|gracelin: then why redouble 2S , if you don't intend to sit.  Did he really think opponent will run to 3D ? |pg||
pc|cA|nt|gracelin: West has a tough call over 2S double.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: isnt a trump lead called for in this auction ?|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|sT|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|rado: at 52 yes but not sure at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no point on commentating on this utterly silly no play contract]|pg||

pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: If you cash two rounds of spades, you go down, because then you must rely on hearts to be 3-3|pg||
nt|rado: should duck now and later A@S and AKx @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is the proper technique indeed|pg||

nt|ritong: budi's 3NT is a wild bid, to say the least|pg||

nt|gracelin: West's 4H was on the other extreme|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|mdgraham: yes....some explaining to do|pg||

mb|p|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: red suit shift|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, guess Karwur will do that|pg||
nt|ritong: north is known to have 4@h, and declarer could hold @d AQ7x, so a @h looks clearcut|pg||
