nt|Walddk4: Good evening everyone and welcome back to London for TGRs Super League 2009. This is a match from round 7; two segment of 12 boards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evening all.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Mike, Mike and Hans!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good evening from CPH|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: hi Mike1 hi Raif and Hi Hans|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: I suspect the names are wrong - NS are a Hinden pair |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html  for standings after round 6 of 9. |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: second position preempts so often find [partner with the big han|pg||
nt|mdgraham: So the scoreboard banner is the wrong way round |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|hK|pg||
nt|lestergold: so a severe trick shortage here for Coyle|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: if 3@c can be like Easts hans I had passed on W. Stiff @cA!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  West had a clear-cut pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: well I do not recognise this as a  very regular partnership- Simpson normally partners Price|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: West is a (very good) rubber bridge player, where pre-empters tend to have a bit better hand|pg||

pc|h7|nt|lestergold: personally I believe in sound preempts in second position- this one is somewhat scrappy|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h8|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c7|pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The only contract I could have thought about as W is 5@c|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: not absurd by any means but dangerous when the odds are so high that your partner is the person you are probably pre-empting|pg||

nt|hawe45:  3 NT played by South seems to be a good spot|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: The team names are reversed on the scoreboard I'm afraid|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: N-S are in the Hinden team|pg||
nt|mdgraham: poor old North - can't even get to dummy in trumps|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so this should be 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: well should be 3 off for 800 not good business Mr. Scoltock|pg||
nt|lestergold: at these colours his equity in bidding 5C was not too great in my opinion|pg||

nt|mdgraham: mind you, might be only 500 if North is inspired enough to lead the @DK  |pg||
nt|lestergold: he has a chance now to almost flatten against 5S indeed but he should not have been given the chance|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Has North any other chance - than plaing the @d King?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  playing...|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 10-12 in this room first, followed by comparisons from the closed room when we roll over to board 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wonder how many of these guys are just in from a hard day in the office.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|an|12-14|mb|p|nt|bobh1: 3n is a reasonable spot|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|brolucius: A knowledgeable kibitzer tells me: None! They are lazy bums.  Well, we can do without that sort of language.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Back in the time when I played evening matches, I took it very easy at IBM during the day.|pg||
nt|jallerton: trump lead makes sense on this auction as dummy often has a 3-suiter with short @c|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jallerton: Is it too late for IBM to claim a refund of some of your salary, David?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true enough, though trump leads when they are 3-3 often do declarer no harm, not least because he generally can assume that they ARE 3-3|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|brolucius: I used to wear out their photocopiers, printing down articles and proofs for checking.|pg||
mc|9|nt|brolucius: It seems that declarer will survive his play of the @HA. Yes, he has.|pg||
nt|jallerton: took his ruffs then played dummy's spades, North forced to ruff and now the @hK was bared|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This does not look good. We have the Hinden team as N-S in both rooms|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anything you can do, Steve?|pg||
nt|eggy: Board 10 has been arrowswitched in the open|pg||
nt|brolucius: The sort of mistake that players can make after a hard day at the office. Not that these players believe in such labour, if I am advised correctly.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You mean the closed I hope, Steve|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The positions are right in the open room with Hinden as the home team|pg||
nt|jallerton: Well neither Hinden pair plays weak NT, so I'm sure it was Alexander/Hodgkiss whom we saw play 2@h|pg||
nt|eggy: No - in the closed they are seated correctly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then the set-up is incorrect|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Look at the scoreboard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It reads Hinden as home team|pg||
nt|eggy: I'm afraid so|pg||
