mb|3H|mb|p|nt|haans: good alert of !@C often forgotten|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brolucius: Liv, the VG operator, is kindly putting in the results from the other table by hand. We do not have a linked BBO table, so the auction at the other table is not available.|pg||
nt|brolucius: We can guess here that South rebid 3@C at the other table.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D/@H for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and some times the club queen is beheaded - and the contract makes even with 4 losers|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: Anyone prefer 1@H opening with S hand?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|drorp:  if they found the switch to spade in time, it'll be 120, if they don't, 180, not much of an interesting hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: no minus 200 for NS :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: You need some system to describe all the heart-support hands for West. 3@H is usually played as pretty weak with four trumps.|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S and 2NT for better hearts hands|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D probably means a strongish raise to the two-level.|pg||

nt|jbgood: 5 level ....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one off in five of a major - probably bid under their own steam |pg||
nt|haans: bad only for some|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if it starts 1@H - 4@H, West can enter with a double and East will bid 4@S.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: NOT a result team-mates have sympathy for |pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D is bold, at this score.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: save?|pg||
nt|drorp:  after Aa bids 3@h, atleast, Molberg is not going to let his opponents play when he's white VS red|pg||
nt|haans: GF relay or natural|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT is a good bid, but as the cards lie it is not the best contract.|pg||
nt|haans: i can not see N leading low hearts :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: No reason whatsoever, of course, for East to bid 4@S. West might have a long minor and a singleton spade (as he does in hearts, on this lay-out).|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to guess who is thinking...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: 1@D=11-16|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - I must admit I just noticed - but that convention may backfire some day|pg||
nt|mdgraham: back, David - extra pass :)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: surely not a PASS here |pg||
nt|lestergold: a psyche here by patterson|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: yes 5@D or 5@H both makes|pg||
nt|drorp:  he went with 4@h, knowing his partner has void spade|pg||
mb|3C|nt|brolucius: Perhaps North is thinking of doubling, hoping that he can score 4 hearts. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: This is the NS bidding|pg||

nt|drorp:  well done|pg||
nt|drorp:  Aa doesn't know if it's 6-4 or 7-4, but i think it should be 7-4|pg||
nt|drorp:  note that 5@h goes down if the defense attack spades continously|pg||
nt|haans: opps may get a hearts ruff in 5@D|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 3NT looks better here, but you can understand why Selway didn't bid it|pg||

nt|hedyg: the screen seperates them|pg||

nt|hedyg: but S has disced 1@h...|pg||

nt|sharkey: or as kib suggests - even without @H stopper|pg||
nt|lestergold: game likely to be bid and off in the open room  |pg||
nt|sharkey: think 3 NT other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Much easier to screw up a defence like that than it may seem when we can see all four hands. (He said from bitter experience...)|pg||
nt|haans: i do think Zia said that in one of his books|pg||
nt|hedyg: S obviously thought W had KQ@H|pg||

nt|haans: an old transfer :)|pg||
nt|haans: easy to play|pg||
nt|brolucius: South hand is worth about 23 points with the good diamonds. Too good to show 20-22.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: the strong NT version of Multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 4 @d a good bid|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: N/S not in tune in last segment or two either|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jbgood: this looks difficult|pg||
nt|haans: many play that 1nt show 18-19 bal 1@S waiting|pg||
nt|jbgood: not many in Norway, Hans:)|pg||
nt|haans: maybe going to 6nt?|pg||
nt|hedyg: more and more are playing this as showing 20-21|pg||
nt|mdgraham: where are these matches being played, David? |pg||
pc|s5|nt|jbgood: doubt that - they are on the diamond route|pg||
nt|haans: at least now :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 22+ they open 2@c and use kokish relays to show 24 +|pg||
nt|lestergold: Lonon?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbgood: (I dont know a single one:))|pg||
nt|haans: no know that i rean BIN :)|pg||
nt|drorp:  establishing the spades would work, but he should start with clubs because other wise east can theoretically jump with K@s and play his 2nd heart, and west will have 2 more entries to establish his hearts and set the contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: rdbl - 4 sp - 4 NT |pg||
nt|vinbtech: good lead again|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed - but where in London|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Royal National hotel , London|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks|pg||
nt|vinbtech: but NS will make +400|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|jbgood: well - he skipped the xx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will find out they are off a key, so should stop in 6@D|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: and 2NT openings show both minors weak then|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|drorp:  well, he didn't very hard ofcourse|pg||
nt|drorp:  so i think it's over now|pg||
nt|haans: kokish relay rarely needed (you do not have 24+ often)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: nice to watch|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jbgood: a diamond return might have worked for the defense|pg||
nt|jbgood: job done|pg||
nt|jbgood: does Tundal know he is on the lead?|pg||
nt|haans: minor suit slams harder to find|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jbgood: spade does not work|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|drorp:  he would be okay with a diamond return, playing the 9, and in control (again has to choose correctly to continue with spades so the defense communication is lost)|pg||
nt|lestergold: depends on which suit they primarily play on|pg||
nt|sharkey: We see @C breaking - but S could also elect to play on @H - doesnt know who has 4th @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: if clubs no problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: if hearts its not so good|pg||
nt|sharkey: easy from here :)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: both H and C reqd 3-3 here ; but H u require some more as well - i guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in hearts you will take two finesses, so you require 3-3 with spilt honours for four tricks |pg||
nt|lestergold: mertis of playing on hearts are that kJ may be on side or they may be split with a 3/3 brak etc- clubs simpy need to be 3/3 or you are fallingt back on miracles in hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if you play clubs you need a 3-3 break|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think its tough at the table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, @HKJ may be both onside - not when people like us are declarer, of course |pg||
nt|lestergold: the mathematicians can work out the precise percentages|pg||
nt|lestergold: any actuaries around here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: E/W play strong club 16+ unbalanced or 17+balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 1D is 3 way 11 -15|pg||
nt|lestergold: Erichsen is avery careful and thouightful player this will send him into a fait old tank|pg||
nt|lestergold: fair old tank|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 1H/S 5 cards usually|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think I go with the 33 break - then I dont need an actuary...|pg||
nt|lestergold: so duck a club for starters |pg||
nt|vinbtech: hope he comes out if it(tank) winningly !|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i must disclose a bias here as my son is on this team|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is the sort of guess you get right on a good day, and wrong on a bad one |pg||
nt|lestergold: so i hope too|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 2@C is a kind of multi|pg||
nt|lestergold: Mike 1 did you do a degree in philosophy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, physics|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Precision style or 5-9 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: sounds like the law of the excluded middle to me|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: oh i did one in pohysics and philosophy believe it or not|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|drorp:  can safely play diamond to 9 now, trying for an overtrick maybe|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: more often than you might think :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sharkey: Board 1 was a push|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he has made the winning decision but one spec thinks its the wromg play|pg||
nt|vinbtech: well,  i keep it simple - this is a Declarer's problem - i want him to succeed ! If it was a Defender's problem - I want the Defense to Succeed - Simple !|pg||
nt|sharkey: Whe Espen has chosen his path there's no turning back and he'll be +400|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: and on this occasion he mad the play I would have made|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d2|pc|h2|pg||
nt|haans: kokish relay mean 2@C-2@D-2@H = natural or 24+ bal|pg||

nt|roswolf: perhaps tony f will get this right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble is that Forrester thinks spades are 5-1 after the double of 4@S|pg||

nt|xenya: or maybe he has -- a bit complex|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they are, he does not mind if they take a ruff as Gold has no quick entry for another ruff|pg||

nt|Walddk2: What happens if he takes a spade finesse and a heart comes back?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: likely to get to 4@S, which is quite a respectable contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: a lucky day you make 6!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but should have four losers on a diamond lead  |pg||
nt|brolucius: Passed out deals are rarer than Yarboroughs nowadays.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, you can construct plenty of hands where South is 7222 or 7321 and 6@S has no play  |pg||
nt|lestergold: I must admit i am old fashioned enough not to like premept s in front of pard holding 4 cards in another major|pg||

nt|hedyg: he himself|pg||
nt|haans: yes as spec say may be fit showíng jump|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 1@S was not forcing, 2@D seems to be the best bid, committing to hearts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@D is stronger than 3@H, since North bid again and that would take the sting out of 3@H.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: bearing in mind that the clubs could be ruffed out and estanlibished without having tio rely on qH dropping |pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: I prefer Pass to 1@H|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H is certainly an active style|pg||
nt|sharkey: You dont have opening and you dont want @H lead are two good reasons|pg||
nt|lestergold: opening poor 11 counts is common place today|pg||
nt|lestergold: another advantage frankly of not being saddled with a weak no trump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed, but you have to wonder what the overall success rate is|pg||
nt|lestergold: modern theory states that its better to stretch to get a bid in quickly than pass... as long as pard does not punish you every time he holds a misfitting 12 count opposite your ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: opener|pg||
nt|sharkey: No problem with 11 points if you have a suit and/or want the lead |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as even though these openings are common, partner always seems to play you for full values|pg||
nt|lestergold: here erichsen has both amjors that is also a consideration|pg||
nt|lestergold: majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still it does mean that you get to play some interesting contracts|pg||

nt|sharkey: Preious hand may weill be played by N in OR if S doesnt open - which cud make a difference as @D lead not likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A dubious double of 3@C on that suit, as I see it.|pg||
nt|hedyg: somehow 3NT does not seem to show the strength of the N hand|pg||

nt|haans: Ha all|pg||
nt|haans: Hi|pg||
nt|brolucius: A common idea, among experts, to play transfer responses to 1@C.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|haans: among many today|pg||
nt|haans: spreading|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would perhaps like to bid, but he has a very flat hand.|pg||
nt|haans: nice 3@D bid :) will they find spades|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: E wont ike his K@D anymore now|pg||
nt|hedyg: not for continuing to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Walddk3: Is 3@S limit with three-card support?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Do they go through 2NT with 4?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyr: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: If East saw that North was considering a bid (and was therefore likely to hold diamond length), he might conclude that West was short in diamonds.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|brolucius: Probably a 'choice of games' cue-bid, since West cannot be thinking of a slam once he has passed 3@D.|pg||
nt|haans: N and E on the dsame side of a screen|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|hedyg: @S lead?|pg||
nt|hedyg: nothing else looks good|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: with spade ruff can hol to 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk3: Awkward hand to play|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Aa would have liked to be in dummy after  trick 1|pg||
nt|jbgood: but he will make it I think, ruffing a club and throwing a heart on the di king|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: 4@S safer than 4@H|pg||
nt|haans: this time|pg||
nt|jbgood: that surely didnt complicate matters|pg||
nt|Walddk3: No, but Aa must be wondering why he got a diamond into dummy's tenace|pg||
nt|haans: we all are :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: can still switch|pg||
nt|hedyg: Q@D meant as preferential here |pg||
nt|haans: lavinthal @DQ?|pg||
nt|haans: sry|pg||
nt|brolucius: Since no further diamond tricks can be taken, North's card would normally be suit preference. Here a high card requests a spade switch, so that the defenders can set up a spade ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: before declarer has discards on the clubs.|pg||
nt|hedyg: unlikely that E bid 3@h with K963 in @D|pg||

pc|s2|nt|sharkey: the hard way...|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|hedyg: not too late yet|pg||
nt|brolucius: There was more chance of making 4@S than 4@H.|pg||
nt|haans: triumph for Eide|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 4@D was intended as a 'choice of games' cue bid, East should have chosen 4@S. He had already overstated his heart suit. |pg||
