nt|bridge_one: now difficult to find 5@C for N/S|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H can make if they dont find the cluib ruff|pg||

nt|mdgraham: at a guess, EW are probably about 35-45 and NS a bit older, but I'm not certain of that |pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2NT probably a relay asking for shape and range|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@H, in that case, would mean: 'I do have four hearts, but cannot accept your game try because I am minimum.' |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: 2@S would be more economical. Then you have an extra step to show all kinds of patterns and strength|pg||

mb|d|nt|garnetts: double ot not?  |pg||
nt|lestergold: hard for hasset to compete at these colours|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many use super acceptation with 4 cards - here guess to bid only 2@H|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 4@h on NS with the right @d play but a cheap save in 5@c for EW|pg||
nt|peachy: great fitter in E though they dont know it yet|pg||
nt|chick: when I have 6-5 and partner raises, I start thinking slam|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|nt|ralfwil: 4@s can be more expensive than 5@c doubled|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I think Ew play that 2@S only promises three trumps |pg||
nt|chick: S wanted to defend spades, I suspect|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wild effort from North imho|pg||
mb|5D|nt|garnetts: I admit an initial 2@H would be takeout--but I like to be able to balance |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: if S bids clubs, N has hearts to run back to|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: better stop now|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: although I don't understand why S didn't bid hearts now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|othered1: was south's double clearly support?  Or maybe a "cue-bid" double (a favorite of mine)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon South expected 6/5|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: he will be tempted|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|peachy: i woulda have thought S's Dbl was some responsive type|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: and he has fallen for the temptation altho that was an error|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double probably general values|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dburn: maybe not on this lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold wasnt having any of this nonsense|pg||
nt|lestergold: he heard the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East have a good hand, the game depending on hight cards in West|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|garnetts: There 1NT is 14-16 I suppose?   With this very suitable 14 I would have bid 4@S but I like to be agressive |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|dburn: well, if you do not want the opponents to bid nonsense contracts, you had better make sure you beat them|pg||
nt|dburn: and this opening lead will not have that effect|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is sadly true|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would expect more from East--did West upgrade his 1NT?  (15-17)  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 9 in @D 3th, so can make 4@s|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, the double might cause declarer to do something fanicful in the play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but down if east play finesse at the 9@d|pg||
nt|dburn: since he has to negotiate the diamond suit|pg||

nt|bridge_one: overall if they use weak michael's in overcall|pg||
nt|lestergold: east wont want vul to risk 3H all pass when 4 is making|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 3@h is sufficient to give the hand at West ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we await with tenterhooks to see whose chains get jerked probably us commentators in the end|pg||
nt|garnetts: Try 2@D run to 2@S etch via 2NT build up a momentum|pg||
nt|mdgraham: won't want to give NS a shot at 500 when it is possible that they cannot make game - as here |pg||
nt|bridge_one: knowing @S @C 3@h means closed suit, game depending on hight cards out|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: very long thk|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold/townsend may have heard all this before|pg||
nt|lestergold: long thinks against gold are not winning tactics|pg||
nt|lestergold: he specialises in mind reading|pg||

mb|d|nt|othered1: 4@S may be tough, even if they don't get @H ruff.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: oh hes gone for a real chain jerker|pg||
nt|dburn: or perhaps he has just bid his longest suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: sadly not |pg||
nt|garnetts: but it is quite safe --he might even make it |pg||
nt|lestergold: no perhaps about it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H is a tactic bid, waiting ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: For what exactly|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h is an attempt to play in two hearts - there isn't anything tactical about it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this could be passed out and inm the fullness of time Hassett will be more delighted than he may immnediately realise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if west keep same cards without A in @d 2@H is made !|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if West has shown diamonds and spades, he doesn't have much of a problem here, imho - either 2@H is to play or it isn't|pg||
nt|lestergold: for that observation Geogio u get a medal|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@H to play, ok, but impossible the partner could bid anythink with A in @S and A in @D|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear to what extent this auction is forcing on North|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold's turn to tank|pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose North has to bid now |pg||
nt|mdgraham: if indeed it is forcing at all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Doubt South will go on over 5@C - he will be more afraid of 6@C making|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: so 2@H is a tactical bid, hoping opps bid anything to can rebid 3@h after|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think so|pg||
mb|5C|nt|dburn: even if West did have both @sA and @dA, 4@h might still not make if he had a heart void|pg||
nt|garnetts: Double should promise another bid most of the time --unless they bid game in my view|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n meaning i dont know what to bid but i have something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting - why not pass 2NT? |pg||
nt|dburn: 2NT is natural, and Hassett should have passed it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because thik South wouldn't pass 2Nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not as if yuo don't have a good lead...|pg||
nt|othered1: did the double really accomplish anything?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well we didnt predict this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, so ou can defend 3NT instead|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he will pass this|pg||
nt|lestergold: now surelty pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however better to counterplay 3Nt that 2Nt :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: well I'll be ............................|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hornswoggled?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem is: West keep a @h or he is void ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not unreasonable for towsend to think Gold has a heart guard here|pg||
nt|dburn: it doesn't much matter, since East is on lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it got hearts into the picture, I suppose |pg||
nt|othered1: and then partner waits for additional definition at a high leve.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: I must say  that 2@c is rather modest in my opinion|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|garnetts: Good lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: so e/w make 3N and score 500|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||

nt|Walddk2: There was a remarkable last last night where Liggins went down in game at tone table, whereas Garvey bid and made slam at the other!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *one|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the same denomination?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter Crouch was on lead against slam holding two aces; neither of them was cashing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only a passive lead would have defeated the slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H-1   6@S=|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: no 4@H -1 and 6 @s made at the other table.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Confirmed by Roland. Thanks.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And, Patterson, Crouch's partner, also had an ace!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So declarer was off three aces but still made the slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: South had a think, then reset and thought again|pg||

nt|mdgraham: The last session starts in about an hour|pg||
mb|r|nt|bridge_one: ty Brian|pg||
nt|peachy: Thx everyone|pg||
nt|othered1: Not that easy nowadays to nail pairs in low-levle contracts after they've opened the bidding and have been supported|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thanks all. a lot to do for Howard if they will level or win the match|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: they didn't seem to have any problem at the other table :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bridge_one: 2@d probably natural (new suit rever)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: On a good day 6@C makes; this is not the day|pg||
nt|garnetts: Kokish used to advocate a 1@D response to deny a five card major with this hand type |pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, what the hearts lack in quality they also lack in width|pg||
nt|lestergold: its not a great slam on most days|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: England being hit all over the park in Centurion. SA 58-0 after 5.2 overs!|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: very unlucky go down at 6@C - with @C 3/2 the chance to make slam are good|pg||
nt|lestergold: hiow do you get rid of that hearts loser unless hand with short dim ha only two trumps|pg||
nt|othered1: I thought south had gotten into the way, but . . . |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|garnetts: would be a great slam if it made |pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think North should have doubled that|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: or fall back on spae finesse|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: at least 3 down?|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree unless south is known to screw around with overcalls and his sequence could be just shape.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: past the point of no return|pg||
nt|lestergold: welll they are onwards and upards it seems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the imps will go outwards|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: another 12 imps into the deepening trough|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: In the open room, Dixon and Silverstone did not breathe on a wrong card one has to say. Perfect set for them|pg||
nt|garnetts: give and take what goes up often descends with a bang|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk4: It takes a minor miravle to deny Hassett now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ebu.co.uk/events/?eventid=12  for standings after 6 rounds of 7|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however with Q10x in support, KJ in other suit of my p, A out and nothing in other suit i agree with 4@C bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: the bridge gods are with them|pg||

pc|c3|nt|othered1: not so odd when fewer and fewer doubles are for penalty|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Come to think of it, 6@C isn't good. It needs more than clubs 3-2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: Thx all, back in 1 hour|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in open room south choose to bid 3@c over 2@d - after 3@h (3 cards support) and 3Nt by South|pg||
nt|lestergold: I said that a while ago Roland|pg||
