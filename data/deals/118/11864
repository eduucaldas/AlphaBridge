nt|garnetts: very unusual hand here |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Dixon and Silverstone reached top spot|pg||

nt|roswolf: now the fireworks may begin|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@D splinter is possible|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: How often have you been in a position where you don't need to draw a single round of trumps?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|garnetts: I have only seen it happen once to be honest |pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: With no outside aces, East is not tempted.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think east was right to bid 5@D immediately since the K@S was wasted--normal with slam potential to pass and then bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Dixon got a club lead in the other room and was able to pitch two spades on clubs|pg||
nt|garnetts: they will make six now as east won't quit by cashing I am sure |pg||
nt|roswolf: i think cashing the ace of hearts is probably right|pg||
nt|iain sime: Don't think it matters.|pg||
nt|garnetts: You alwasy hope to beat this by getting tow hearts later --he won't cash|pg||
nt|roswolf: looking at that dummy where is pards defensive tricks?|pg||
nt|garnetts: a couple of people suggesting that 3@S splinter would have better than 2@S-- I agree with that|pg||
nt|iain sime: No squeeze as no communications. Only six if South unguards clubs.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You can't stop Ranis now. The danger is that he bids a grand slam|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Strong no trump after passing since I have ben asked led to lots of missed games and the late Terence Reese once said he knew it wasn't bridge they were playing |pg||

mb|3H|nt|haans: 1nt = good bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, the 1NT overcall will simplify matters|pg||
nt|ady: Bowles needs to come in with hearts|pg||
nt|capercliff: are they using screens?|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: Yes, screens are used.|pg||
nt|vinbtech: if so,  they can proceed to 5C, making i suppose|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes the 3@h bid pushes them to a making contract|pg||
nt|ady: best e/w can do is play in 4@C    which will be a good swing for them|pg||
nt|capercliff: perhaps they would have bid it anyway|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: yes right  5@C does make on good club position|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: good decision to play 3NT. East can tell there may be a danger of spade ruffs|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|capercliff: W's 4th @d will go away on an established @s|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|vinbtech: with the wasted HK, 4C P is the option |pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: and one advantage of playing in no-trumps is that the opponents cannot cross-ruff |pg||

nt|iain sime: East is definitely erring on the side of caution with only 2S in third seat.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt comes into the mix here|pg||
nt|garnetts: very iffy hand as east two defensive tricks but huge attack potential--I would either pass for entry later showing a flawed weak two or open 4@S |pg||

nt|capercliff: can set up the Q@d for a @c pitch?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: but still only 11 tricks  will need to draw 2 trumps to enjoy Q@D   so can only ruff 2 spades   |pg||

pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||

nt|capercliff: he could try and set up the @d for a pitch but west will ruff the 4th round|pg||
nt|capercliff: and he cant draw 2 rounds of trumps as he needs to ruff 3 @s's|pg||
nt|ady: dont think it can make without a club|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It needs a club switch now to break up the squeeze|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes only a @c now|pg||
nt|capercliff: and I think he can work it out|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Otherwise West will be squeezed in the minors|pg||

nt|capercliff: but he may try to ruff a @d good as the squeeze is double dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How does a diamond help the defence, David?|pg||
