nt|brolucius: Perhaps they are not so keen on large plus scores as most BBO kibitzers.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: The runner seems to be on strike. No result from the other room|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|sharynr: would 3@C not have been a better try for game by South?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Game is playable but not particularly wonderful.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: 3@H is usually played as pre-emptive.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H should not be invitational at all|pg||
nt|andyv:  never understood bids like 3@hs in these auctions..dbl or 3@c had to be better|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: You have a million bids available as a game try|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|sertorius: i'm told they played 3H on the other room too|pg||
nt|brolucius: North did understand what 3@H meant and therefore passed.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Declarer seems to have played a spade to the king, so that he would be sure to lose two spades and it would not look like a missed game to his partner.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just as well that they stopped in 3|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Given the line of play just as well they stopped in three|pg||
mc|9|nt|andyv:  very considerate of N|pg||
pg||

nt|Walddk2: Renate Hansen, yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But a better cardcounting has given a short @c on E and with the actual distribution  - no @c-loss|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|mb|r|mb|3C|nt|chessmaste: There was also a subtle clue - East's delayed double|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Strange double of 1@D|pg||
mb|4C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: I wonder if East wishes he had been born without that L in his surname?|pg||
nt|brolucius: An extension of Burn's Law (you should have more trumps than the opponents) is that when you are in 3NT you should have more points than the opponents.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ralfwil: I once played with a partner who wanted to play Fischbein on 1, 2 and 3-level|pg||
nt|sharynr: clearly a misunderstanding as to the strength of 3@C after a redouble|pg||
nt|chessmaste: North's 3@C is the right bid - but not with this partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 3@C was admirable. West's redouble had announced the balance of the points, so South has no reason to attempt 3NT.|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Never mind, North did|pg||
pc|sT|nt|chessmaste: No need as you can see|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharynr: why should he, if declarer will do it for him :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and cashing @CAK did not cross East's mind|pg||
nt|andyv:  but too tough to pull trump for E|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c4|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|mc|8|nt|andyv:  not a pretty sight|pg||
pg||

nt|brolucius: North's 3@C was likely to be weak over the redouble, with a long suit. But even if West had passed, 3@C would show only about 8-10 and South would not have enough to bid 3NT. |pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 11 tricks in closed(!)|pg||
nt|sharynr: only made 5?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sharynr: @D lead prob|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ralfwil: looks like a @h finess after a @d lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  it took careful play, Sharyn|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Heart finesse is not a good idea after @DQ lead which you know is a singleton|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The @DQ lead (when declarer can see the !JD) is known to be a singleton or a doubleton, so the risk of a ruff is evident. |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: @DJ, I mean|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|sharynr: so 13 tricks is the recommended result then|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Anyway, if declarer is in six on such a lead, his diamond problem is solved. He can then afford to lose one trump trick but not two.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Place your bets|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She makes them all|pg||
nt|andyv:  6... a club is led|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  drat|pg||
nt|brolucius: That makes it interesting.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Only after the lead Mark but now 13 tricks|pg||

nt|ralfwil: a beer or whisky from me Roland when we met!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|brolucius: North would like to bid 2@S on that hand but perhaps they play it as stronger.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: 4@H has a chance, perhaps even 5@D, but not 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sertorius: yesterday against me they played it weaker|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: He can't make 4@S either|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sharynr: I think West has bid enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Something is wrong|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think N can make 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Operator, you need to UNDO|pg||
nt|sharynr: undo?|pg||
nt|sharynr: wow|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: 4@h looks easy now|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure 4@h makes sense in this auction either:)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Should be a doddle|pg||
nt|sharynr: probably not the actual auction|pg||
nt|brolucius: West bid 4@D and East 4@H.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right. Anyway, nothing wrong with the contract now|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is a better contract than 3NT, which needed quite a bit once the spades were cleared.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|sharynr: surely declarer knows that the @DK is right|pg||
nt|brolucius: I dare say that North bid 2@S at the other table, which would give East-West less space to sort out the best game.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s7|pc|d4|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|ralfwil: The only chance to defeat is if N plays @d 10 and W missguess|pg||

nt|Walddk2: More significantly, would North bid twice vulnerable on AQJxxx and out?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|sharynr: interesting 1@S opening|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|brolucius: This system, where you open a 4-card major and rebid 2NT on 12-14, sometimes 11, suffers from the weakness that responder has no space for a game-try. Consequently you get to game ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|chessmaste: I am not a betting man but I will put my stake on Van Helsing|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 7 and 8 in this room first, followed by comparisons from the closed room when we roll over to board 1|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brolucius: 6@H can be made if the defenders do not cash their two spade tricks.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Declarer can take a discard on either minor.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Alas I did not collect the Euro Millions roll over|pg||

mb|2H|nt|andyv:  any weak 2 bid should get them there|pg||
mb|3C|nt|brolucius: Those under the age of 20 would no doubt open 3@H on the West cards, rating is too strong for a weak two-bid.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that the team name should be CastellO (not i). Too late to correct it I'm afraid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: It must be easy now with easts hand|pg||

nt|ralfwil: and not 5@h either. Let partner decide|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 5@H - not my idea of a bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Undisciplined effort by West, who had already made a limit bid on his hand and had little idea what partner held.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||

mc|10|nt|sertorius: Nice weather here, 26ºC and sunny - not the best for playing bridge|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 5@H bid was choose-your-adjective and deserved to go down. |pg||
nt|chessmaste: I am reminded of the Flanders and Swan song - Have some Maderia my dear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madeira is a Portuguese archipelago in the mid Atlantic Ocean. It is one of the autonomous regions of Portugal, with Madeira Island and Porto Santo Island being the only inhabited ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: islands|pg||
nt|brolucius: You show your age, Mark. It was before my time.... |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Sorry I though you had a hand in the lyrics :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: East would have doubled 4@S, for 300.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Real Madrid and Portugal footballer Cristiano Ronaldo was born in Madeira and played for Nacional before going to Sporting Lisbon|pg||
nt|brolucius: When I was there last year, and on a previous occasion, I visited a Madeira lodge and paid a large amount to sample some 30-year-old wines.|pg||
