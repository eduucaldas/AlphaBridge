nt|mdgraham: E seemed to think a bit before the final pass, might have tipped South off to the 4-1 trump split |pg||

nt|athene: but they might need a bit more when only 4-4|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not exactly classical 3@C |pg||
nt|ady: the 3-1 split  plus the singleton club may make this difficult |pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: with that opening  e/w wont go wrong in with the clubs|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 9 tops in 3N .... if they get there!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sfoxa: plenty of games for EW|pg||
nt|athene: west has to be very worried about diamonds for 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|lestergold: Malinowski has asked for a diamond stop|pg||
nt|athene: now he doesn't want to play the 4-3 spade fit and get forced right off in the long trump hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: de Botton has answered a different question now what?|pg||
nt|athene: he will perhaps just bid  5@C here|pg||
nt|athene: you don't need much from partner - @SQ is enough!|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5C safe enuf as it happens|pg||
nt|sashac:  spade finesse for slam- really slightly more as often 50% slams are really|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps, for that reason, he will look for six|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|d|nt|sashac:  artur in slam mode|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: and one off made sadly|pg||
nt|lestergold: on eoff mode|pg||
nt|sashac:  no real justification for 4NT|pg||
nt|athene: i think on this auction over 3@D, a diamond stop is more useful than three spades, since west is very unlikely to have five spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: I agree strongly Bill|pg||
nt|athene: so when East bid 3@S, West put her with nothing in diamonds, which makes his hand much better|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|joest: this is an interesting sequence|pg||
pc|d8|nt|joest: I just had a discussion with a world class player last week who argued that this should show spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you would be worried about misisng slam with that East hand, facing a double of 3@C  |pg||
nt|joest: Im not smart enough to play that way :)|pg||

nt|ady: very flat 25 hcp   but should make at least 9 on the lay|pg||
nt|joest: yes friendly layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: low diamond lead?|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|athene: 1@H just shows any positive which can't make some other very specific bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: admittedly the clubs behave well|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|joest: i have not fared well leading from KQxx against NT; can't speak for others|pg||
nt|ady: diamond does not cost    still only 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|an|14+bal|mb|p|nt|athene: i think 1@S asks "what have you got, then?" and now 1NT is 11+ balanced|pg||
nt|athene: (they respond 2@D immediately with 8-10 balanced, √° la Meckwell, which lets opener get out to game fast when he doesn't have the world)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sashac:  7D from South is best spot and they are heading there|pg||
nt|athene: the grand slam isn't at all bad here|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|athene: in 7@D you can perhaps try to ruff the clubs good and fall back on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|athene: south is playing it, fortuitously, which protects the heart tenace|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: so the defence can't force you to commit early|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sashac:  dont need heart finesse if clubs are 4-2- can get spade ruff for 13th and keep heart entry if South declares|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|athene: jumps to six are real grand-killers|pg||
nt|athene: partner can have the world and still not dare to bid another one|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: dangerous to play clubs now.  could go down with heart onside when clubs 4-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: unless the bid of 6 showed something really specific|pg||
nt|athene: even a full relay system would have problems with this hand, to be fair - both red jacks in the south hand are critical|pg||
nt|sashac:  disappointing finish|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: even the @C109 gives you extra chances|pg||
nt|sashac:  16 tricks now|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
mc|13|nt|athene: the best most pure relay systems could do is north could find his partner had @Sxx @DAxx @DKxx @CKQxxx|pg||
nt|athene: and that's a lot worse for the grand than what he actually has|pg||
nt|athene: so if they bid it in the other room and know what they are doing - well done :)|pg||
