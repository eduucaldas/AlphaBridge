nt|bridge_one: 9 in @D 3th, so can make 4@s|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, the double might cause declarer to do something fanicful in the play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but down if east play finesse at the 9@d|pg||

nt|bridge_one: overall if they use weak michael's in overcall|pg||
nt|lestergold: east wont want vul to risk 3H all pass when 4 is making|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 3@h is sufficient to give the hand at West ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we await with tenterhooks to see whose chains get jerked probably us commentators in the end|pg||
nt|garnetts: Try 2@D run to 2@S etch via 2NT build up a momentum|pg||
nt|mdgraham: won't want to give NS a shot at 500 when it is possible that they cannot make game - as here |pg||
nt|bridge_one: knowing @S @C 3@h means closed suit, game depending on hight cards out|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: very long thk|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold/townsend may have heard all this before|pg||
nt|lestergold: long thinks against gold are not winning tactics|pg||
nt|lestergold: he specialises in mind reading|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh hes gone for a real chain jerker|pg||
nt|dburn: or perhaps he has just bid his longest suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: sadly not |pg||
nt|garnetts: but it is quite safe --he might even make it |pg||
nt|lestergold: no perhaps about it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H is a tactic bid, waiting ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: For what exactly|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h is an attempt to play in two hearts - there isn't anything tactical about it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this could be passed out and inm the fullness of time Hassett will be more delighted than he may immnediately realise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if west keep same cards without A in @d 2@H is made !|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if West has shown diamonds and spades, he doesn't have much of a problem here, imho - either 2@H is to play or it isn't|pg||
nt|lestergold: for that observation Geogio u get a medal|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@H to play, ok, but impossible the partner could bid anythink with A in @S and A in @D|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear to what extent this auction is forcing on North|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold's turn to tank|pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose North has to bid now |pg||
nt|mdgraham: if indeed it is forcing at all|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bridge_one: so 2@H is a tactical bid, hoping opps bid anything to can rebid 3@h after|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think so|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: even if West did have both @sA and @dA, 4@h might still not make if he had a heart void|pg||
nt|garnetts: Double should promise another bid most of the time --unless they bid game in my view|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n meaning i dont know what to bid but i have something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting - why not pass 2NT? |pg||
nt|dburn: 2NT is natural, and Hassett should have passed it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because thik South wouldn't pass 2Nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not as if yuo don't have a good lead...|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well we didnt predict this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, so ou can defend 3NT instead|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he will pass this|pg||
nt|lestergold: now surelty pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however better to counterplay 3Nt that 2Nt :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: well I'll be ............................|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hornswoggled?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem is: West keep a @h or he is void ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not unreasonable for towsend to think Gold has a heart guard here|pg||
nt|dburn: it doesn't much matter, since East is on lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzas: .. which is 22IMPs over the 60 boards|pg||

nt|vugraphzas: Second and third have 97 and 96 IMPs ... very close|pg||
