mb|4D|mb|p|nt|haans: openings gets weaker and weaker|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jcwla: Oh, now here's a thing of beauty.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  hey, it's a good 10 count|pg||
nt|brolucius: The spointer bid means that North can throw away her @DK-Q-J-x. That does not leave much!|pg||
nt|andyv:  and even has connectors|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 @S - do they have a system?|pg||
nt|jcwla: That's all you've ever needed, right, Andy?|pg||
nt|haans: S cannot believe N has all that in @D|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  rest is window trimmings, Jordan|pg||
nt|brolucius: Just what North wanted to hear.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Which is one more reason NOT to overcall with this East-hand |pg||
nt|andyv:  and how are you going to overbid if you don't open these solid 10 counts?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|haans: not the best lead :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||

mc|11|nt|andyv:  switch spades and this is a make|pg||
nt|haans: Sweden takes the lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  When is the bridge supposed to start?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bathroom break time for N/S I would think.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That spade slam is as awful as the missed grand slam before was good. A truly terrible pair of slam-bidding boards for the Austrians.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if N had won with J@s initially, he could have made this... truly a Roland slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: How could it be made?|pg||
nt|jcwla: A good question.|pg||

nt|haans: takerout x has been unfashion|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry E|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: You have six side-suit tricks, three rounds of trumps and two spare trumps. You are not up to 11 tricks for a squeeze, are you?|pg||

pc|cT|pc|s2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|brolucius: No point in a heart switch at this late stage, since West can count declarer for nine top tricks.|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|mb|2C|mb|d|mb|2S|nt|brolucius: I have never understood the Blue Club system. How can they survive opening 1@S on that South hand?!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|haans: now harder to find|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  W has a 3N bid here|pg||

nt|hawe45:  And they did it even with @S D x x x|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: West is worth a raise of the diamonds. 3NT not so attractive with South showing excellent clubs. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4@D - 10, 3NT - 7, Pass - 1. Oh, she has passed...|pg||

nt|brolucius: Well, you would have to travel a long way to see worse bidding than we have had on the early boards of this match. And this is Table 1!|pg||

nt|brolucius: No excuse, as Hans says. East took a risk with that giant hand and West had an easy raise of diamonds.|pg||
nt|andyv:  is it really that hard?  E dbld then bid a suit at 3 level... W is looking at stoppers in both of S's suits... where's the difficulty?|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|hawe45:  There is no diff - thatÂ´s the problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|andyv:  my type of opener|pg||
nt|jcwla: I agree.  Canape posed no prob.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jcwla: This is a GOOD opener compared to some we've seen.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|brolucius: Yes, it is good. It is almost an opening bid.|pg||
nt|haans: unusual bidding cause problem all the time for opps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 @D - for South a transfer?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|brolucius: I don't like 2NT much. Why should it not go for 800 or so, from her point of view?|pg||
nt|haans: an opinion: cornersoul: good bidding will ruin bridge (V. Mollo)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S... well, I must try not to be too rude. I will just say that it would not be my choice. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Never tell the same stoyr twice, East...!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  story|pg||
nt|haans: time to be rude here|pg||
nt|jcwla: I can understanding keeping a natural 1NT when opps have bid two suits, though it's not my preference.  But 2NT not so much.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't really like the original weak-jump response, with two aces in the hand. |pg||
nt|hawe45:  That hand is NO weak-jump|pg||
nt|andyv:  how limited is the 1@d bid?|pg||
nt|haans: thats for sure|pg||
nt|haans: 11-13?|pg||
nt|brolucius: We only need North to bid 4@D now for every one of the four to be given a black mark (by the admittedly very strict commentators for this match).|pg||
nt|andyv:  then 2@s might be ok... game would be pretty remote|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@D a re-xfr :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  esp. since they open 4 card majors (that are worth bidding)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|brolucius: The only possible reason to bid 3@S is if you are convinced, somehow, that your partner did not see the original 2@S.|pg||

nt|hawe45:  She must rather have misread 5 @C|pg||

nt|brolucius: This is when we need a video feed from the players' room. When this dummy hits the table and the camera zooms into Erhart's face.|pg||
mc|13|nt|brolucius: Erhart would not (should not) sign off after a one-ace response, so what did 5@C mean?|pg||
nt|andyv:  N could, at least, asked for Q@s|pg||
