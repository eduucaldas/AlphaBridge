mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|brolucius: Double was for take-out of spades but East quite rightly considered the value of passing. His partner could be stronger than he actually is.|pg||
nt|jwit: Good of WEst to get in.  1NT makes and they can make a heart part score.  Woops!!!|pg||

nt|haans: opps do not lie this|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jwit: This contract would not have faired so well without clubs behaving|pg||
pc|cT|nt|haans: only a small loss for EW|pg||

nt|haans: no results yet Bullitin 6 has not been presented|pg||
nt|jwit: Heart suit is going to block here for an overtrick|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was about a 50-50 decision for East, whether to bid or sit the double. His decision was somewhat unlucky.|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s9|pc|h8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: His partner did not double on the 1st round, so perhaps East expected him to hold at least two spades.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Could have been a light opener by South in the third seat. I have some sympathy with East's decision to pass the double.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: West is fortunate to be playing inverted minor responses. Otherwise he would have to bid 1@D on a 3-card suit.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jwit: 3NT best spot here|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: and they found it|pg||

mc|10|nt|brolucius: I was locked out and missed most of that. It was a classic inverted-minor auction with both player showing a stopper thereafter.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Test|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maria Erhart won the world women's championship (in the Austrian team), doubtless also with Smederevac in 1998.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|4D|mb|4H|mb|5D|nt|brolucius: We do not have linked tables, so the operator is kindly entering the result from the Closed Room by hand. Therefore we cannot see the bidding as we normally can.|pg||
nt|haans: slam can make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: This could be interesting.  On the surface it appears EW have a good slam, but suits not behaving may make it tough|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: West's pass may be forcing, since they were in a vulnerable game against NV opponents.|pg||
nt|haans: spade Q nice|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jwit: This will make, but they will lose a few imps|pg||
nt|brolucius: East had no space to suggest that he was very good for his 4@H bid. |pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Marc Smith was explaining to me last week how Meckstroth and Rodwell invert the normal meaning of double and a forcing pass. Too difficult for me to understand!|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C is a much better bid than an immediate 4@S, which might be bid on distribution rather than a bundle of high-card points.|pg||

nt|haans: and they will bid it|pg||
nt|jwit: Better from South hand, but will fetch regardless.|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: 2@C is artificial, so the double shows clubs.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|haans: Austrain ladies play Blue Clubs|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|brolucius: Still, I prefer 3@C on the West cards to take up space.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|nt|brolucius: East has mis-read the double!|pg||
nt|jwit: This will not be pretty|pg||
nt|haans: suicide |pg||
nt|brolucius: Another reason why 3@C would have been better... (Still, if East misreads the meaning of double, he may do the same for 3@C. He needs to know that 2@C was artificial in both ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: cases.)|pg||
nt|haans: They NS: hpm404: they play together since a whole life:(|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|brolucius: East was not worth a jump to 4@S, whatever he thought that West had.|pg||

mc|6|nt|haans: bloody|pg||
nt|brolucius: A well deserved disaster for East/West (he said sympathetically).|pg||
nt|haans: question as to has 2@C been alerted?|pg||
nt|jwit: EW need a miracle on the last board|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the risk of repeating myself, West held a possible seven tricks in his own hand and should have bid 3@C at his first opportunity,  rather than giving the opponents a clear run ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: with his double.|pg||
nt|haans: if 3@C was natuiral BIG IF|pg||

nt|jwit: Even at favorable vulnerability, 4S seems extremely risky, and looking at a club void, I would certainly fear partner's double shows clubs|pg||

nt|brolucius: You cannot lose when watching on BBO. Either you see some excellent bridge, or you see some awful mistakes and can think that you would have done better.|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|c5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|brolucius: North quite rightly waited to see that E/W bid game udner their own steam. Then it was entirely reasonable to sacrifice. To bid 4@C immediately would not be right on her hand.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Smerderevac is known to be a very sporting player (she once let my partner correct a mistake in a tournament in London).|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Barbosa and Pinto are Portuguese internationals, if I recall correctly.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2NT usually played as forcing to game, with 4-card heart support. (Jacoby 2NT)|pg||

nt|haans: Hi Jon|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jwit: Hi Hans|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would not be an awful slam to bid (because the hands fit well), but the diamond finesse is offside. |pg||
nt|jwit: This hand should be very flat, although slam is on a finesse, which fails|pg||
nt|haans: not exiting first board|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|brolucius: As always, we start with boards 7 and 8, so that we can have comparisons with the Closed Room once we go back to Boards 1-6.|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|jwit: I assume 2H is some kind of miniMichaels opener|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|haans: ekren i think|pg||
nt|haans: 2M weak|pg||
nt|brolucius: 'ekren' looks like a typo but is in fact a bridge convention.|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|jwit: North should duck this trick|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even a low heart switch from South would give the defenders only 5 tricks. But obvious to continue spades.|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|brolucius: North could read the spade position from the spot-card that South returned (also from the bidding).|pg||

mc|8|nt|brolucius: It was not easy for E/W to 'land on a sixpence' after that opening bid from North, but they managed it.|pg||
