mb|p|nt|haans: not walsh here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT is a fine bid by West although I would have bid that at my first turn|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pelu: would u bid 1NT when S X for @S???|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That hand has no-trump all over it|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: No I would not, Peter|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But I would over 1@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 2@C by south  optimistic|pg||
nt|pelu: long time sinse we played - I would 100 out of 100 bid 1@D|pg||
nt|sertorius: a heart lead seems to beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know you would|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sertorius: yes, now N can give partner a heart ruff|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: for sure not - I dont lay out smoke in the bidding|pg||
nt|sertorius: but hopefully West will ruff high?|pg||
nt|essegredo: a @S lead would be as effective, if south ducks the ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That would work, yes, but a heart will not|pg||
nt|ady: a spades l  ead ducked seems best|pg||
nt|sertorius: more efective in deed|pg||
nt|pelu: i dont need to duck - then he has @HA as entry - but I cant see the @H-ruff|pg||
nt|sertorius: S may still take the ace and play a small spade?|pg||
nt|ady: can win the heart lead and switch to low spade as well|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
