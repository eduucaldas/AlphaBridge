mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  easier now|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: this is the moment of truth...|pg||

nt|panja: !9 lead perhaps...|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: @C9|pg||
mb|p|pc|c7|nt|cuttysark: It is pointed out that North should add a loser becasue he has too many queens and only one ace - a valid point. because otherwise they have the right losers for slam!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|panja: this will not be easy...8 tricks shd be easy though|pg||
nt|xenya: best lead no doubt, still 9 tricks can  be made i think|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, the A team have put on 9 more imps, but this match could go either way.|pg||

pc|c4|nt|xenya: clubs are blocked|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cuttysark: And yes, North needs 2 entries to beat this by leading clubs, and he has only one.|pg||
nt|panja: @Dt exit will be best for S next|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And his clubs are too puny to keep the lead|pg||
nt|panja: the point is GIB sees @SQJ inside|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cuttysark: Well, North has to discard on the third heart. |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|panja: @DT exit...not easy to find...but is a very good idea|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cuttysark: Well, he can't play clubs with no entry, so the diamond must be tempting|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Perfectly safe|pg||
nt|panja: right...once he decided to switch, @DT seemed like the only option....so was not all that difficult after all|pg||

pc|s6|nt|cuttysark: Now he has given North an easy diamond discard|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Had to cash one spade before crossing in diamonds. hard position to see - I missed it looking at al the hands :)|pg||
nt|xenya: he had to play S for 2 spades -- cash @SAK, @D to the Q and 3 rounds of hearts |pg||
nt|panja: oh, he chucked his lifeline - the fourthe Diamond|pg||
nt|xenya: @D to the A that is|pg||
