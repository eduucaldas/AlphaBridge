mb|1D|nt|sybarra: this looks like muiderberg,  5 @H  and 4(+) minor |pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: 3nt played by S|pg||
mb|2D|nt|haans: my choice opening 1@H|pg||
nt|haans: simple 3nt no problem|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ralfwil: 3nt looks goon on NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: even vul I mght open 2 @S with S  (or multi if they play that)|pg||
nt|haans: long way to hearts now|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 split     south has fine shape   but with A@C wrong   not likely to make 4@H   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: From 1987 to 1994 worked on WBF as member and chairman|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  is 3sp invit?|pg||
nt|haans: right :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzmr: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: not even a jr here,  but why not?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: but trump split means only 8 tricks in a spade contract e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: looks like preemptive raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  4sp does win|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: s explained like invite|pg||

nt|ralfwil: yes, as @c10 is on side|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Jean Besse, of Switzerland, is one of the fixed lights of European bridge. He has played in more European Championships than any other player. |pg||
nt|h_karluk: A Swiss team without him would be like Hamlet without the Prince. Switzerland has often been in a challenging position in the European Championship but has never quite won the ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: title.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: 3@H may well make for n/s so 3@S down 1 a decent result for e/w|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The countryÂ’s best Olympiad performance was fifth place in New York in 1964.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|sybarra: "unfortunate" that trumps do not break"  just a joke |pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|nt|andreasw:  he should have layed low on first @c|pg||
pc|h9|nt|h_karluk: In 1954 Besse, and the legendary Karl Schneider, were enlisted by the French, winners of the European that year, to represent Europe against the U.S.A in the Bermuda Bowl.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: even 1 round @h ruff enough|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

nt|jcwla: Even with an "easy 1@S rebid," 1NT on this E hand makes life so much easier -- a lesson of experience.|pg||

nt|haans: about 1/3 of all IMP points are from defense|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@d on EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: at least 5IMPs to Olena|pg||
nt|dima:  I think on 38 Caponi opened 1@h and 2@d from Piedra was constructive @h raise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and Caroni cannot pass with that huge bulk|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: maybe lucky only in 3 then |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w likely to play 4@S |pg||
nt|haans: believe 5@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 3nt on EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3nt an easy task|pg||
mb|1C|nt|h_karluk: but the difference is big, approximately many of 5 like this one needed|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sybarra: need to stay out of 6 for sure|pg||

mb|p|nt|andreasw:  would u have accepted the invit u have minimum but u also have a good hand|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks   |pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: perhaps a dangerous cue bid here |pg||
nt|haans: some get hert this way|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: well I actually dont play 3 @S as invite,   so I would pass that bid |pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps difficult to stop there. But a @h lead is necessary do defeat a slam.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: hurt|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 @C is better hand with spade support |pg||
nt|haans: some bid 4@D and then 4nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure N never expected S would leap to 6 @D |pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opion: zBIG1959: and bye / bye / spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: not only are we missing the 2 aces,  just handling this with out loosing another trick is interesting |pg||
nt|haans: must play spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: but can not get back to hand without another loser |pg||

nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Send your mail to...|pg||
nt|hedyg: i thought 3@H has to show 2 high honours in @H|pg||
nt|ritong: the idea behind it is this: when someone opens game forcing , it very often is with a strong one suiter, maybe with a side suit|pg||
nt|ritong: so, the first thing to do is express if pard is interested, with a ruffing value for example|pg||
nt|ritong: with this hand, admitting east does not overcall, it would go 2@d 2@h (neg) 2@s 2 NT = i dislike @ss|pg||
nt|jcwla: I just don't see why they are having such trouble with this, would take a jump to game as showing this type of suit with about this many losers.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Alternatively in an uninterruped auction, 2@C-whatever response-3@S setting trumps and asking for controls.|pg||
nt|ritong: i guess he had a doubt about 3@h|pg||
nt|ritong: if not , it is just mandatory leaping to game with two aces missing|pg||
nt|hedyg: i do so much prefer playing gf 2@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: and controls|pg||
nt|ritong: anything works super with no interference|pg||

nt|sybarra: he is jr.   and keep him on the straight and narrow, |pg||
nt|reisig: hi ....:)|pg||
nt|dima:  Some action coming|pg||
nt|haans: here a grand|pg||
nt|dima:  Momentum might take you to 7@h on this pair of hands|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no game for either side|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: grand slam on for e/w     likely to play in 6|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt EW?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|dima:  Well you do miss @h Q so it is not a beauty|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: has been a great fellow commentator with me @H  thx Milan and Andreas.  @H  you all have fun now |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@h i expected, even 3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4 @d vs?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|haans: unlucky yes but ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: in rkc time not biddable grand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i didn't get that 2N, anyone knows?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: cu all again  @H@H1h|pg||
nt|dima:  Well - some Voidwoods are around but not clear whether TT play them|pg||
nt|haans: most bid 3@H showing singel|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Not for this pair I am sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i don't think that's an optional X|pg||
nt|h_karluk: clear penalty|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|reisig: bye Shirley|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: bye|pg||
nt|sybarra: not many entries to dummy here |pg||
nt|h_karluk: it seems a complete joke|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andreasw:  cards fitting perfect here|pg||
nt|sybarra: suprised, W just didnt bid 3 @S |pg||
nt|haans: in france they bid natural after 3@H as if they have game|pg||
nt|haans: idiotic |pg||
nt|h_karluk: and wrong thinking with that collection|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dima:  Now for most it would be @d fit + @h shortness|pg||
nt|sybarra: is there a reason for that? |pg||
nt|sybarra: isnt 3 @H a transfer?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|dima:  I told you about practical natural bidding|pg||
nt|dima:  Next board :)|pg||
nt|haans: so i learned from kib at other match|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: just 2 sure winners, but the aim should be unless obvious off 2 not worths to move|pg||
nt|haans: now @S8|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ralfwil: there is no other chance than to use the entries to pick up the @s suit, so discard a @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry @c suit....|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: think, think|pg||
nt|haans: must give opps a @D first to have entry in @D9|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Discard a @s and play @cQ and @dK is an entry for the next @c finess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: declarer knows the 3-0 split in @d, so ...|pg||
nt|haans: yes you have your first entry hear and now|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|reisig: Very conservative bidding|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|haans: yes trasfer but 3@S say ok lets play spades|pg||
nt|haans: forcing like|pg||
nt|sybarra: well had W been able to see E hand,  might have prefered spades|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|haans: we now use transfer before we bid Flint but france bids neither|pg||
nt|haans: France are only nation be world champions twice|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: at  trick two everything revealed for a 1st class card shark|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dima:  Will be over in 7 sec|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzmr: ew are very disciplined players|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ady: diamond quality saved worrying about spade split|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: this is also an option|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: N endplayed|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|vugraphzmr: short break for smoking|pg||

nt|reisig: How far - they need to go?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: they are outside pause is 5 mins.|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: they are back we will start the 2nd half|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: no matter refuse overruff or not|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
mc|6|nt|ralfwil: well played:)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i don't think Levy started with 1@d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: slam there|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|dima:  I think they had 12 boards scheduled for 1h 30-40 min :-)|pg||
nt|haans: fun to watch|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: will they reach 3N?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: obv 1@h|pg||
mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: undo?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W picked up an extra chance with @cKxx in front! |pg||
nt|h_karluk: ty operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: W used his timme well|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dima:  X = TO and all pass would be fine|pg||
nt|ady: n/s seem overboard in OR   3 spades down 1 iwth a good trump split|pg||
nt|ralfwil: time....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: aggressive lead, very risky|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans:  1@S opening? not me|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzmr: nope|pg||
nt|dima:  They will just peacefully go plus versus 2@c |pg||
nt|sybarra: we are just old fashioned Hans |pg||
nt|sharynr: hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi Sharyn , welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i like to open 1@h on S hand|pg||
nt|sharynr: would appear slam will be defeated on a trump lead|pg||
mb|3H|nt|reisig: I agree|pg||
nt|reisig: Good spots|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|dima:  so -3|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ralfwil: hello Sharyn:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: of course a spade lead will lead to 13 tricks|pg||
mb|5D|nt|haans: i do not like ace-less hands|pg||
nt|h_karluk: even a @d lead would serve a slam in practice|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|ady: Ribitas will go further ahead |pg||
mb|6H|nt|ralfwil: From N position,  a @h  is the most natural lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: they do have their drawbacks |pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but letÂ´s see|pg||
nt|h_karluk: slam there, right, however to passive trump lead off|pg||
nt|sharynr: kib sees a line to make on trump lead, by setting up the @s!0|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so only a @c ruff ok, that's the same line i saw, in practice perhaps last chance|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharynr: but in actuality, will prob take finesse in spades|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dima:  Ribitas team is a betting favorit in this match|pg||
nt|sharynr: with 1 club ruff should be 12 tricks|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||

nt|h_karluk: now has the luxury for 2@c ruffs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but may not finess in @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: without overruff fear|pg||
nt|ady: hi all    sorry   had a computer problem|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|h_karluk: just play @dK, then ruff to next|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello David!|pg||

nt|haans: quit right|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome David, good to see you back, i will sell my next 2 shifts and would be in picnic in Sunday:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: hi Ralf    Hamdi|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: 5@D   ambitious in OR   would have tht 4@S a better bet|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems last board of this segment|pg||
mb|2N|nt|haans: 3@C best bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the final board, thanks to organizators, BBO, operators, both room commentators. Kibitzers always welcomed|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: 6@d is not a bad spot ...but fails|pg||
nt|dima:  But I think following suit preference @s 3 from Partner North could just play @d A and a @D|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|andreasw:  will they reach it?|pg||
nt|dima:  I think they will get to 4@s|pg||
nt|haans: may miss game now|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S???|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks to organizators, bbo, fellows and kibbers|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: why 3@C you may ask|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like 3 @C  |pg||
nt|haans: 3@D is not clear sign off|pg||
nt|sybarra: may take the majors out of play also early|pg||
nt|haans: best lead @CJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmr: we'll see for the few moments|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@h now?|pg||
nt|dima:  They play reasonable weak jump overcalls, so 1@s + 2@s shows reasonable nonminimum hand|pg||
nt|haans: thats better|pg||
nt|ady: good 6@S   see if Olena can finish with a flourish|pg||
mb|4C|nt|haans: good slam in spades or clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  yep|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|nt|reisig: Some use 3@h here ..asking a stopper|pg||
nt|haans: ok |pg||
nt|haans: he he|pg||
nt|h_karluk: another crazy double in case input correct!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: best with opps bidding is that if you bid you do show a 6 carder|pg||
nt|dima:  Depends aa bit on partnership agreements :) Frensh style tends to promise values when you bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: not really easy|pg||
mb|r|nt|ady: defence does best not to take A@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmr: stop in 5 well done :)|pg||
nt|reisig: this time ..it's right :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: yes but still 6@D is good contract|pg||
nt|dima:  Some handling here for North, but cards are friendly|pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphzmr: 3rd Q unlucky is behind|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|dima:  Then he's crossruffing|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  @S8  now ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't believe Piedra doubled|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1954 Monte Carlo, Monaco BERMUDA BOWL.. Europe team : Jacques Amouraben (FRA), RenÃ© Bacherich (FRA), Jean Besse (SUI), Pierre Ghestem (FRA), Marcel Kornblum (FRA), Karl Schneider ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: (AUT)|pg||
nt|sharynr: is the play in 6@S THAT simple?|pg||
nt|sharynr: when trumps 3-1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes:)|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: Play will be fast|pg||

pc|d2|nt|sharynr: on @H lead|pg||
nt|ady: 12 tricks should not be a problem|pg||
nt|ralfwil: duck first one|pg||
nt|h_karluk: rest in peace jean played with karl, he was indeed one of the fixed lights of European bridge. He has played in more European Championships than any other player. |pg||
