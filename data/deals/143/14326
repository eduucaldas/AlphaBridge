nt|janm: 5@d is aggressive, but he can guess that his partner doesn't have much wasted in clubs, since the vulnerable opponents bid and raised them|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we are a trick short here |pg||
nt|janm: See how much more comfortable this would be if the 1@d opening had shown an unbalanced hand - then either West would have a major suit singleton and could cross ruff a bunch of ...|pg||
nt|janm: tricks, or he'd have a 5th diamond so they wouldn't be so likely to split badly|pg||

nt|janm: Or with S out of clubs, he can take a spade finesse and take spade tricks|pg||
nt|janm: He's trying to figure out ways to make it if things aren't lying well of course.|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably worried about how many @C del monte has |pg||
nt|janm: What if the heart was a stiff or doubleton for instance - then he might have to play a spade now, before pulling the rest of the trump|pg||
nt|janm: I suppose that Fruewith might have overcalled 2@c, even vul, with Kxx, Qxxx, x, AKxxxx and then he needs to play heart to the J, heart to the A diamonds and spade to the Q|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: very tense atmosphere here|pg||

nt|janm: Sorry, I often have 14 card hands :), but I meant AKxxx of clubs |pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect tense/intense|pg||
nt|janm: I think he decided that if N had only 5 clubs, he'd have the K of spades, so the spade finesse early was safe in a funny kind of way|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|janm: Some people play that the 2NT bid asks partner to bid the lowest suit in which he wouldn't accept an invitation - if that was what it meant here, it worked well|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|s2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|d7|nt|sybarra: can he make sure it stays untangled?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is he just going to cross ruff?|pg||
nt|janm: Looks as if he's planning to cross ruff but with S having the same shape as dummy, that might not work|pg||
nt|janm: He'd be better off for cross ruffing if dummy had some of his nice spade honors|pg||
nt|janm: Del Monte probably deciding whether he'll do better to ruff and play a trump to cut down on the ruffs, or copy dummy and pitch a diamond or ruff and play a diamond - complicated ...|pg||
nt|janm: hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  he has lots to think about here|pg||
nt|sybarra: no worries re time  I presume|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|janm: Guess we should think along with him - if he ruffs to play a trump, declarer can win in hand, ruff a club high, ruff a heart, play a club to pitch a heart as S ruffs ... I don't ...|pg||
nt|janm: think that works for declarer. If he ruffs and plays a diamond, declarer can ruff in dummy, ruff a heart, ruff a club or diamond high, ruff a heart - still isn't going to make it|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|janm: Certainly that seemed like the most "natural" thing to do here - now declarer can score a diamond ruff, 2 heart ruffs and the spade A, but I think that's it|pg||

nt|janm: 1@d showed either clubs or a balanced hand. DBL of 1@d showed 4+ hearts. 1@h I suspect showed a weak NT, don't know if it promised 3 hearts|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: That's a new typo for me - 1@c of course!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|janm: Usually one of the benefits of these methods is putting the overcaller on lead, but here it doesn't happen to matter|pg||
nt|sybarra: is this going to stretch?|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: me too,  think n/s is at least a trick short|pg||
nt|janm: And I will predict that 1@h showed 3 hearts, since I don't think N would have leaped to 4 if he didn't know they had an 8 card fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I have been wrong before also|pg||
nt|janm: It looks to me as if they have 4 losers they can't avoid (2 spades, 1 heart, 1 club) as well as not having 10 tricks, so it's going to be VERY hard for Del Monte to overcome that|pg||

pc|c2|nt|sybarra: low club|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully this helps but I think still a trick short|pg||
nt|janm: If East rises here, Klinger will have to hop with the spade K to lead that third heart, but things will be pretty clear by then. If East ducks, the club trick won't really go away, ...|pg||
nt|janm: because declarer only has the one trump and it's smaller than Klinger's|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||

nt|sybarra: wonder if any pressure on time?|pg||

nt|janm: spade|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: play is in dummy with the 6S taking the last trick|pg||
nt|janm: So 3@c had the bad result of possibly getting NS to 3@cx but when E pulled, it had the good result of leading them to the defense to beat 3@s - we think|pg||
