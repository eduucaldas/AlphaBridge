nt|idc: Oops, scratch my comment about competing: I was in some other part of the universe|pg||
nt|lestergold: nice 4@h available for e/w|pg||
nt|sybarra: not to stay out of 6 @H with trumps not breaking |pg||
nt|idc: or possibly a different one|pg||
nt|cuttysark: With 6 cards missing the jack the best odds play is to finesse - but not when South has thrown a diamond|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Jean wasnt tempted to finesse in @D |pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: *not=now|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A lot of cards are placed well for N/S herre but I would expect 1@H-2@H to end it.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|idc: A 4@d splinter from West might excite East|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: with this top heavy hand i would prefer to show the nspqades on the way if anything than splinter|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N or as it happens 5@c cold as cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Weak 1NT at N in OR|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that one exceeds my fear level|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzjc: 1nt shows doubleton spade or less than 8 pts|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|idc: CC says 3@c is Baron - some kind of balanced game raise - my guess is the CC is out of date|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lark20: with clubs sitting right, this is a good contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: what daylight robbery|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: well hardly balance|pg||
nt|idc: As a few specs have mentioned to me, 1@s is a better shot with the West hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: well if Baron, may alert them to the problem |pg||
pc|dK|nt|cuttysark: Wow - it is OK to open  weak NT with an 11 count, but I don't like to do ite with 4-3-3-3, particularly if partner is going to move with that South hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did they have weak 1NT openings in 42?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, was keystone of acol|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Oh yes - and even earlier|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Since North's hearts are not great he may well have an ace on the side|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: But he will not have both aces, so it looks right to clear spades and sit back|pg||
nt|jcwla: N does not have enough to merit risking the plus and even though it causes me psychic pain to pass 8-card fit auctions at the two level, any other action by E would be highly ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: imaginative.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|idc: Looks more like a delayed game raise with a @s suit, than shortage in @d being the key feature|pg||
nt|lestergold: wrong sided but it doesnt matter with club right|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h frigid vul for ireland and they are not even in teh auction|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: imagine sitting in a musty hall at cambridge during the second world war|pg||
nt|sybarra: or blackwood will  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: You would prefer to have the henad with @SK on lead, but that is difficult to judge|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: i think its Ian's mother in law at work|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cuttysark: If South decides to use Stayman - and why not, the chances of a 4-4 majors fit are quite good - she d=should bid 2@H over 2@D and hope to survive in a 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: first one black wueen played disappointment breath held andother black queen!|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|lestergold: roland has got into the bidding here for him an ecellent slam|pg||
nt|idc: Ah, was looking at wronf part of CC: 3@c is Baron over 1@s opening but after 1@h it is FG raise & artificial|pg||
nt|sybarra: so much for caution |pg||
nt|lestergold: and.... phew......|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cuttysark: North has no strong play|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially seeing the ten drop[|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Nice 10 (if you are declarer)|pg||
nt|rednaxela: indeed.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Ten-board rounds here, we're starting with 25 while the OR begins with 30, will try to figure it out.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: Claim, I think, before we have a senior moment|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: well ive seen worse slams but this doesnt only need a 2/2 heart break it also needs goodm spade behaviour|pg||
nt|lestergold: id say less than 505|pg||
nt|sybarra: this would be right if hts 2/2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hoping @SA was singleton|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: cheeky spade opener from hackett and the irish roll over and get done|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h8|nt|idc: She did just have a look at the BBO screen before she left 10 mins ago|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|idc: East could have asked for trump Q with 5@d presumably; has chosen a bad day to punt slam|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: well now |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c9|nt|idc: Hmmm|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
mc|10|nt|cuttysark: Anyway, looks as if Jourdain is going to make 7 tricks to flatten the board|pg||
nt|idc: But she'd left her wand in the hall, so I don't think she can be blamed|pg||

nt|xenya: not easy -- the only way to make it is to throw N in|pg||

nt|idc: I'd play dbl as takeout of spades first time - tough to see a way into the auction|pg||
nt|idc: Maybe East should overcall but *shrug*|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @D is multi |pg||
nt|lestergold: I cannot honestly say that the standard of bridge here is totally scinitllating|pg||
nt|idc: and according to CC, potentially undisciplined, so this will be a super maximum one|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: alert 2S = minors|pg||
mb|1N|nt|idc: Thanks Christine|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like this treatment as defense v multi |pg||
nt|idc: North might try @c now|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A nice comming if @C lead from N.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: inv minor i assume|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|sybarra: and...."we arrived" undoubled |pg||
nt|lestergold: no double!!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|rodal f: I wiched they had neg X at there system but ended well.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i think you need to be flexible with the meaning of these doubles or u just become a victim of daylight robbery these days|pg||
nt|lestergold: as here|pg||
nt|idc: Ireland stole a board from England to balance this one on 23: 12 IMPs to them|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i try one more club with north hand|pg||
nt|idc: I guess 4@s was making and since EW would have been in it at this table, good sac|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w in other room may not like the fact they were not in game |pg||
nt|lestergold: well if they are going to defend like that best bnot to make too many close doubles|pg||
nt|lestergold: better stop soon|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I would give evens on the Scottish pair in the other room bidding this to game.|pg||
nt|idc: Made 4@s here and 3@c in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Immediately? Or second time round?|pg||
nt|lestergold: however still one off|pg||
nt|sybarra: with score in other room,  this will not be end of the world |pg||
nt|lestergold: well unlikely to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: game|pg||
nt|lestergold: no reason tio pick the Q@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: heart lead no play in any case|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: looks about 4 tricks better to play than defend|pg||
nt|fabsayc: second time|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Guess that would push them to 3@S , and a little more pressure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and not much chance opponents will suddenly bid and make game|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to take thuis cant afford heart switch|pg||
nt|jcwla: Declarer will ride this around to hand and have plenty of opportunities to set up the gamegoing trick.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Meanwhile, the masive misfit hand, where the scots stopped in 4@h, the Irish have bid 6@c on a 5-1 fit.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cuttysark: Alex knows his men - the fact that a game canot be made des not stop them bidding it|pg||
pc|d7|nt|idc: This is a good stop|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: lucky second spade stop but a heart switch now defeats|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jcwla: Now just a matter of overtricks.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: Hackett is a well known burglar|pg||
pc|h6|nt|idc: I bring news from the other table - Ireland have reached 6@c on Bd 23|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean a bridge burglar of course|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|c2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You can't trust anybody these days - and it does look as if 4@S can make|pg||
nt|idc: Heh, I'm reminded of a story about Terence Reese & Boris Shapiro|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d5|nt|idc: Oh, and I'm too late, ALex has beat me to it|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cuttysark: So 7 imps to Wales: 49 imps is 25-3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they were burglars too|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well that play had no hope.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: pity they couoldnt play this hand in the much superior 3@d|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|idc: Boris had collected a few trophies from Reese, late at night after an event, and was heading home|pg||
nt|lestergold: they were light figered pickpockets|pg||
nt|jcwla: Appeared to be on the winning track with the @C discards.|pg||

nt|idc: I feel we should be having a party and trashing the commentator's lounge|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i had better send him a welcome to rainy england text now|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully he is back organizing us again soon |pg||
nt|rednaxela: sounds good to me, Mike!|pg||
nt|lestergold: no game here for anyone|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzjc: 6-10 pts 5@H and 5 of another|pg||
nt|idc: They walked the short distance to Reese's house and the police asked him|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rednaxela: Thanks, operator (Stuart)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: 4@H from moyna?|pg||
nt|lestergold: at equal vul i think south's opener is filthy|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: nop one else to organise us shirley it would be total chaos without him|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and 4@S from jean|pg||
nt|idc: To his credit, Reese immediately said he'd never seen the man before in his life|pg||
nt|lestergold: who would admit to knowing shapiro?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cuttysark: Looks as if Silverstone had a toy 2@H opener in the other room, showing both majors, I imagine|pg||
nt|idc: we need him; unruly bunch|pg||
nt|cuttysark: partners never cease to surprise you - West will be amazed to hear 1@S and should jump for joy|pg||
nt|lestergold: however it has pushed e/w overboard cant argue with success|pg||
nt|rednaxela: It has had a reward, however, this time.|pg||
nt|idc: Too good a story to spoil it by telling the truth :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|rednaxela: Can't say that I think much of North's 4h, other than that it also worked!|pg||
nt|lestergold: no double!|pg||
nt|lestergold: er something strange about this auction |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: pattinson has obviously seen his partner's 2 bids before|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Still couldn's get them to slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: leaping micaels, showing diamonds and hearts|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Over which 4@H has to be considered 'wet'|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this time jourdain has full values|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: all sorts of 'workd class' looneys barging in|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: i shall use my entried into dummy very wisely says hackett|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: he said to me last night, before he left,  "hope it is not anarchy while I am gone" |pg||
nt|lestergold: it will be|pg||
nt|idc: Dbl from East no doubt takeout of spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: no way to eat that club loser|pg||
nt|rednaxela: 6@c has gone 2 down.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: entries*|pg||
nt|jcwla: N was apparently waiting around for a reopening double; a level higher too good to pass up.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: luckily e/w cant make game|pg||
nt|idc: lol, but another stolen hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: not really|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: wimpy in NA speak|pg||
nt|lestergold: exvept shirley when you are around|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: believe me guys I am trying to keep the lid on  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well done - never easy to compete so far as a passed hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: strange action by pattinson tho with this 19 copunt|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cuttysark: I suppose they may not have discussed the requirements in detail - I play it as a hand with no more than 5 losers, so West is definitely worth a forward move|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: only way to let this thru would be to switch to a club and he has|pg||
nt|idc: EW can't dbl a strong NT for penalties, it shows a minor suit overcall|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: maybe felt that pard was likely to pull and go negative|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: why north has panicked i do not know|pg||
nt|idc: Not a method I like - sometimes the best penalties are v strong NT, when dummy has no entries as here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s2|pc|c5|nt|lestergold: oh but west has misread it|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's still very close and the risk/reward ratio too high for my taste.|pg||
nt|jcwla: But that's at IMPs -- at BAM totally different.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: 5@H if you trust partner|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|idc: West must have been tempted but perhaps not clear what a dbl of 2@s by him would be|pg||
nt|lestergold: wel I must leave you all now  maybe be around later bye for now|pg||
nt|sybarra: since most doubles are take out today ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: what a ping pong of errors|pg||
nt|jcwla: At IMPs -- the old adage is not to double into game unless confident of a two-trick set.  At BAM -- all such bets are off.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|sybarra: thx Mike,  always fun with you !!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lucky for NI here that @S play|pg||

nt|fabsayc: exactly|pg||
nt|idc: Just 2 IMPs in it now|pg||
nt|idc: and 3 boards to go|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to "press to the finish" here |pg||
nt|lestergold: well all these trange bidding systems so u cant show a strong hand |pg||
mb|1D|nt|idc: Bad time for either side to play in @h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: multi landy from Greer?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or 4@H? No messing|pg||
nt|lestergold: II think west might have gonr in the tank on that club switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: im no bidding theorist but i do not like to be gagged with 19 points|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjc: a major|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D is likely multi landy over nt |pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: like a 2 @D multi opening bid |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Probably the most sensible choice :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes not quite good enough for 4@H vulnerable|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now, will Moyna show here @S|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Don't think she should - too much rubbish in the minors|pg||
nt|lestergold: and workled out that it could not be right to play the Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: The cardplay not one for the textbooks there as the result ping-ponged and ended roses for N/S.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: go for it|pg||
nt|idc: That's an unusual way for it to gain: don't show your major first round, in case opponents are about to play in it|pg||
nt|idc: My partners used to like those methods - they claimed that the way I played them I never had strong hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I often play multi over nt |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4@S X +1 coming up|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|sybarra: it sort of goes with  multi openings |pg||
nt|lestergold: played very quickly it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not my choice if club was a nat bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: not that any lead would threaten this contract|pg||

nt|lestergold: not with gun to my head do i bid this 2@s at unfavourable vul|pg||
nt|idc: Normal enough bidding but a low spade lead will kill this|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do not agree with delaying actions here -- get that bid in early, take room away from the opps, and bring partner into the picture.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and is automatic|pg||
nt|lestergold: i lioke to have more tan 2 playing tricks to bid at this vul|pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|nt|sybarra: I would not have bid 2 @H's with E |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|sybarra: and I think that is what you meant |pg||
nt|lestergold: when i bid like this west has a spade stack passes and east reoepns with a double|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Anyway, This is the last board of this session. Many thanks to Sandra Claridge of Bridge Great Britain, and Michele Alexander and Peter Cohen of the West district of the Scottish ...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Bridge Union for organising the event, and to Bernard Teltscher for sponsoring it. Also to our excellent operator, Stuart Bradnam, and to my fellow commentator, Martin Johnson . |pg||
pc|h6|nt|cuttysark: And of course Frank Rodal, whose name I cannot spell correctly :)|pg||
nt|rednaxela: South's Diamonds are almost as good as North's Clubs.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: And, as they have just pointed out, there ar two more to play since they started with 17|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So sorry - don't go yet, still time for Wales to make a few more inroads|pg||
nt|idc: With a chunky 5-card suit and a couple of tens, I'd stretch to a game invite over 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|idc: Well, I guess the overcall makes that less attractive|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the childrfen are sent out|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jcwla: Trying to differentiate sound from not is not a good enough consideration, in my opinion.  Now you are a level higher and are giving the opponents a fielder's choice -- all so ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: partner won't think you have another king?  Include me out.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: a near certain singleton but you can afford to duck|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: not so sure about that duck however|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Should be a fair save against the vulnerable game|pg||
nt|idc: You'd expect North's spades to be lying over partner's honours there|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|rednaxela: 5 more imps to CBAI - Scotland down in game at both tables on board 24.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: I am wondering why North did not make a penalty double on the first round|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Perhaps he thought the hand too strong|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could have been entirely shut out if west had rebid 3s instead of 3d|pg||
nt|idc: spec makes the good point that 2@s dbld likely to be 500 - maybe East should consider passing?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|idc: I'm not sure|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile W might have chosen to express the max nature of their hand with a double of 2@S.|pg||

nt|idc: Not quite sure what happened there but -1 is what we seem to have|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: -2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: slam time|pg||
nt|lestergold: pretty good slam here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|fabsayc: only 19 imps a board needed for the tie|pg||
nt|idc: England hit back with two double figure swings: they bid good slam on 24 and game on 24 that NS 'stole' from the Irish here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: seems to me -1 is right given the defense, but I think n/s missed a trick |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: warming up the redouble cards|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks - at least I've proved what I said: I didn't know what was going on|pg||
nt|sybarra: right sorry -2 |pg||
nt|idc: Bd 25 the latter of those, sorry|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Ain't any easy 4@S. 3NT is better.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: note 6N by south is infrangible on any lie of thecards|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: a case for this being a passout|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR 25, E/W played on @C's early and set up a low overruff for E, holding decl to 2@H making 3 to win the bd.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|idc: The Irish play 2 over 1 game forcing, so let's see how they use the extra space|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: 3NT thin but possible here|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Ian im going to leave this in ur excellent hands as i am commentated out for now|pg||
nt|idc: Bye and thanks very much for your efforts Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: bye folks|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yo_yo: no messing around :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: That's how it's done :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well he will find out the good news in @D in a minute |pg||
nt|yo_yo: and the @C finesse works|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H  are 3-3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that adds up to a make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|idc: I prefer 2NT on 2nd round from South I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: lets see if W bids it  |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes he did |pg||
nt|idc: With SOuth having neither Ace for an entry, even @h lead is no good|pg||
nt|lestergold: did a wheel come off or would it be better to say that a wheel never came on!|pg||
nt|rednaxela: The difficulty is that south hasn't agreed Spades.  If 2@s showed 6 then 3@s by south might be better than 3@c.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: this one maybe too tough to find 3nt|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might do it with forcing stayman|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is feeble|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|idc: On the previous board, 2@h by E was doubled in OR, but only -1 so a flat board|pg||
nt|idc: Now I think on it, this attack on declarer's communications may be best|pg||
nt|idc: declarer has to decide how to time playing @s & @d|pg||
nt|idc: play one suit too much and perhaps defenders can continue it to set up tricks|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree. Still 3NT is better:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR 26, decl cashed AK and a low @C, putting N in to take the good @S9 and two clubs after S had taken @HK.  So a push at 3NT making.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|idc: on another layout: here one round of spades, then @d towards K, then back to @s will work|pg||
pc|h5|nt|idc: or even 2 rounds of spades with them 4-4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzjc: "i dont know where i found that lead from" says Simpson :)|pg||
nt|idc: @h switch declarer would have to duck, then hope for spades 4-4 when defence went back to them|pg||
nt|idc: and d!A onside: needs a lot this game|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy for sure |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: It's going well - |pg||
pc|c7|nt|cuttysark: Pips look good enough for 4@S also, though I agree there is no defence to 3NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S2 at S and 6 or 9 at N. Pitch @Ds from N at @H? Should still be on, but...|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|yo_yo: greer's looking for the 13th I bet|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cuttysark: Steen Moller points out that if North had discarded 3 diamonds he would have given declarer even greater problems|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no he wasnt|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe - but he will settle for 12, i am sure|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: this line i dont like|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you may as well cross ruff playing for spade 9 with south|pg||
nt|sybarra: is making 2 nt legit also? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: as long as he doesnt finesse the @H, he's home|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: can establish clubs with a ruffing finesse, but a crossruff looks simpler|pg||
pc|h9|nt|idc: The defenders have done ok so far, time to switch to clubs soon though|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cuttysark: Still, Patrick was never one for the simple line|pg||

nt|idc: I can hear the drum roll from here :)|pg||

nt|lestergold: and deserves to cost CBAI|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Last board of the set, though the open room is a few behind.|pg||
nt|idc: And a quiet 4@h for EW to finish I predict|pg||
nt|idc: NS could just have beaten 1NT I think, not easy to stop low once someone opens on the board|pg||
mb|3S|nt|idc: OK, last Board (at this table at least, other room is slower)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: sorry Ian  while we are suppose to be neurtral  sort of cheering for you guys |pg||
nt|idc: another close game that needs guesses - 4@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: no medal for that prediction|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: and yes, of course he did|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Last board of the day. We should thank all the organisers, and kath Nelson who has been a great commentator all day.|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: thanks Liz and everyone|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We are back at 10am tomorrow for the denouement|pg||
nt|idc: I suspectr Paul wanted to pass as North but 3@d probably right in case partner has a monster hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: On the hand where i predicted the Scots in the open room would bid their 22 count to game, they have been beaten to the punch - the Irish have bid their 18 count to 4@h.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i would like to see what Scotland make of that last hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR 27, W made the 2@S with the 5-1 offside split to win the bd.|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, W raised to 4@S immediately -- giving N/S a problem (which they solved nicely).  So often in bridge, if you think it's right to do it now, it was right to do it two ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: rounds ago.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|idc: That's sweet.   I used to use the St Lucia flag rather than Scottish one but BBO told me to 'fess up|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: 5 4 in hearts  spades|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Last board of this match - a 12 imp lead means 18-12 to Northern Ireland.|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Scotland coming bottom in last European Teams caused me to change flag, to much pity from other commentators!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Players have a short break now - restart at 15.40|pg||

pc|sA|nt|sybarra: the specs are the best!     we enjoy the comments and insights |pg||
nt|idc: A good game this but declarer will need to guess trumps (with the @dK wrong)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Current rankings can be found on sbuwest.co.uk/SeniorCamrose.html|pg||

nt|sybarra: nice Liz,  that is easier for most of dummies |pg||
nt|sybarra: like me |pg||
nt|idc: Rae had a clue from @d lead that dK was wrong but I don't see that matters much|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cuttysark: Bit of a comic defence in the other room: Victor Silverstone lead @S7 and it was ducked to the eight|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East presumably thought it was second highest. Maybe better to lead the ten from this sort of holding|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|idc: The other table has some boards to go, but here it is time to thank those involved in our vugraph show|pg||

pc|s6|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|idc: Just a guess in a sense, but restricted choice means K(JT) is twice as likely as JT in North|pg||
nt|sybarra: need the @D finesse now |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|idc: though you can pick up KJxx in South, so close decision what to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: far from an easy hand |pg||

pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: now home |pg||

nt|vugraphzjc: bye for now|pg||

nt|jcwla: Last board coming up, thanks to Roland, our operator, and all specs.|pg||

mb|2H|mb|d|nt|xenya: we saw this hand in the other room -- rather interesting|pg||

mb|3H|nt|jcwla: A moth-eaten 2@H here, but a chance for Rosenkranz XX here.|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Now presumably @C's and back to @D's.  Maybe not game but don't need it.|pg||
