nt|bobh1: we're down to the last segment of a pretty exciting match|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Vugraphzfj: Welcome back everyone, should be quite a show, last segment the players had severe time issues, hopefully not so this segment|pg||
nt|bobh1: jon opens 1n with a 6-card minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: results with 15 boards to play posted at  http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2010/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
nt|bobh1: seems normal to me but some avoid this|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobh1: i'll assume this is a penalty double|pg||
mb|2D!|an|!d + major|nt|bobh1: i think that is michael's preferred treatment|pg||
nt|bobh1: probably they would redouble with some kind of 1-suiter|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bobh1: S has to bid with 55|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notes say DBL created force through 2@H|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@h looks good|pg||
nt|kareno: I often open 1nt with six-card minor but I would have a weaker suit and more in the doubletons.  And hi all from Las Vegas :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bobh1: maybe not with best defense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Three rounds of hearts would work here for the defense.|pg||
nt|bobh1: dont see 10 clear tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bobh1: no suits to set up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CA @C also works because East can overruff 3rd round|pg||
nt|bobh1: they can easily stop a x-ruff|pg||
nt|kareno: Not a likely lead though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not totally double dummy if East @D & @S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobh1: Qx is low on the lead chart|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed Bob|pg||
nt|bobh1: but prob will work as well as anything|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|bobh1: now he sees 9 easy tricks but where is the 10th?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe he's hoping to trick them into not drawing trumps by appearing to do so himself|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on other tables using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but boards are NOT duplicated across matches|pg||
nt|kareno: Predicting down one.  West will eventually realize a third trump is needed.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think he will play a @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: may try for @D4-3   @DA, @D ruff with Q or 9, @H toward dummy|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|kareno: Kit :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: this won't help their time problems at all|pg||
nt|bobh1: i wonder if someone is monitoring them for this?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi kit - looking your team looking good with 15 to play|pg||
nt|kit: so far, yes|pg||
nt|kareno: That IS Flash Feldman at the wheel, isn't it?|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes|pg||
nt|bobh1: he's not known for his speed of play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes he is :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: he was warned last round for the slow play, at this rate|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i predict the directors will reappear|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|bobh1: as his son pointed out he is especially dogged when he is behind in a match|pg||

nt|kit: actually, the play will speed up now|pg||

nt|kit: West carefully counted declarer's tricks and saw there were only 9|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|mc|9|nt|kareno: Before I was disconnected, i was about to say that about thirty years ago I asked Mark Feldman why he thought so long as he played.  His response was that he was thinking of every ...|pg||
nt|kareno: single hand he had ever played to work out the current one.|pg||
nt|kareno: So just think how many MORE hands he has to think about now!!|pg||

nt|larrymori: and not rely on additional things|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|bobh1: dont like this 2@d either|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Since it was a Precision 1@D opening in other room, East was unable to raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: would bid 1n|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|kit: South might well have made a takeout double -- I think he should -- none vul, you don't win IMPs defending 2@D|pg||

nt|bobh1: success hinges on guessing the @d J|pg||
nt|bobh1: also true in 1n|pg||

nt|kit: Good judgment by Feldman, and should pick up 5 IMPs -- declarer will set up a heart trick for  7|pg||

nt|ahollan1: what change needed to North hand to open 4@S instead of 3@S?|pg||
nt|kit: you need a real 4-level preempt for 4@S opening (as opposed to other 4-level openings), since you are much more likely to be wearing it.|pg||
nt|kit: In other words, interchange North's majors and I might well open 4@H|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry MEGO   [my eyes glazed over]|pg||

nt|ahollan1: no void|pg||
nt|caitlin: in Canadian trails, Eric Murray's team won by 4 IMPs when director rolled back a grand slam bid by opponents|pg||
