nt|sybarra: probably worried about how many @C del monte has |pg||
nt|janm: What if the heart was a stiff or doubleton for instance - then he might have to play a spade now, before pulling the rest of the trump|pg||
nt|janm: I suppose that Fruewith might have overcalled 2@c, even vul, with Kxx, Qxxx, x, AKxxxx and then he needs to play heart to the J, heart to the A diamonds and spade to the Q|pg||
