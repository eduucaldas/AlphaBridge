mb|1N!|an|14-16|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2010/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  for half-time scores in all matches (45 of 90)|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: what is the difference between 1@s and X in this sequence? for me X is on a 4-card @s suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|warrens:  on the previous hand?  I think they play 1@S shows 0-3 spades|pg||

nt|jcmax: It is really a matter of style. x= 4+ is becoming increasingly popular. the idea is to make opener declarer whenever possible.|pg||
nt|warrens:  and to avoid bidding 1nt from the wrong side|pg||
nt|jcmax: All the Italians play that way for example.|pg||

nt|warrens:  looks like N/S missed a game here.  spade can be discarded on the 3rd club|pg||
nt|jcmax: Age should never be a limit in my opinion :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thx Sabine:)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|warrens:  but it does require 2 of 3 finesses |pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, in competitive auctions it's nice for partner to know if you have 4 or 5 spades (double/1@S). Everything has the pros and cons|pg||
