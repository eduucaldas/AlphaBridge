pc|sA|nt|andreasw:  so what is 2@c then:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: I exp that they play 2@C = relay to 2@C and 2@H = invitation with 5-4 in major|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHPL3: double checkback maybe|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHPL3: then 2@d automat and 2@h 5@s, 4@h inv|pg||

nt|pelu: inthe X-Y-NT convention: 2@D = GF |pg||
