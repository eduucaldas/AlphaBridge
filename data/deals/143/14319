mb|3N|nt|athene: pitching the diamond on the spade would have succeeded but only if he reads the cards well - he might have enough of a count to draw two rounds of trumps then take a ruffing club ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: I suspect not natural then    --:)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: i guess so|pg||
nt|athene: it's purely coincidental that 2@D has some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: as is usually the case with minor suit bids these days :)|pg||
nt|daman: a bonus|pg||
nt|hedyg: but maybe 2@d was multi and 2@s showed preference for @H|pg||
nt|garnetts: Is there a case for South doing more---or does this suggest a mild slam try?  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: of course there was no danger they would ever mention diamonds naturally - after all they only have a solid 6-4 fit in the suit|pg||
nt|daman: this will be over quickly|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d transfer|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@C say might have been a sign off, 4@H a real slam hand and transfer and raise mild |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: The diamond suit died on October 24, 1982; the club suit long before that|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Yes Hedy a good bid in my view |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: south has an awkward problem over 3@D; some values but he would like another heart for a double|pg||
nt|athene: this sort of problem is common when you have length but no strength in opponents' suit|pg||
pc|c8|nt|garnetts: pass and pass a reopening double?  |pg||

nt|athene: it's ok if you get a force going but often declarer just draws them all casually and it's kind of deflating|pg||

nt|garnetts: Grand slam potentially |pg||
nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and the kind and helpful messages, we hope you enjoyed the show!|pg||
nt|athene: not the worst grand slam ever - basically 2-2 hearts or stiff queen, pretty much|pg||
nt|daman: the auction in the CR was very succinct|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: we will be back in 30 minutes, is that correct Yves?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but even with the @HQ it would be difficult to find seven|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: as it depends on the void which isn't facing an ace|pg||
nt|daman: would he bid 5@H with Qxxx?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: yep but RKCB  will show that the Queen of trumps is missing |pg||
nt|hedyg: in 20 minutes|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: 5@C exclusion now maybe|pg||
nt|garnetts: The old Baron Grand slam try---also allowed either hand with extra length to bid the grand |pg||
nt|garnetts: That means AKxxxx facing xxxx or AKxxx facing xxxxx could get to to seven|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: my guess is EW might try to protect their lead   if in fact they think they have one|pg||
nt|athene: east might be a little worried about the @DK as well but he has the world and his partner showed a good hand so i think it's time to take control, if you have the mechanism to do ...|pg||
nt|athene: that|pg||
nt|garnetts: This involves here say 4@C 4@D 5@S--asking for the Queen of trumps or extra length and West xxxx signs off|pg||
nt|daman: but Caponi has shown us he is fearless|pg||
nt|garnetts: with xxxxx he bids 7@H |pg||
nt|hedyg: he could fit in @d and bid josephine?|pg||
nt|daman: or Eli|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: 5@C must be the bid if they have that agreement|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok he wants to hear a 4@C bid or not|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: i am sure they play exclusion|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|daman: 5 @Cexclusion seemed the best I think|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: double helps a lot|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: now after west doesn't redouble east knows he doesn't have the ace so can use blackwood happily|pg||
nt|garnetts: They always do--I simply cannot see the point of doubling when you are going to be on lead |pg||
nt|nafiz: hi|pg||
nt|athene: i suspect that without that double, East might not ever have been sure whether west had the @CA - of course 3nt might have denied it, i suppose|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|garnetts: The elephant double--tie a knot in your trunk to remind yourself it is your lead |pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d asking for Q@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|hedyg: and deciding not to look for the grand without it|pg||
nt|daman: I was getting indigestion waiting for this auction to end|pg||
nt|athene: it's not easy because west could still have *five* hearts and wouldn't show the @HQ (you show the trump queen if you know there is a 10+ card fit, but west doesn't know about ...|pg||
nt|athene: east's fifth heart)|pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe you should double with nothing in the suit to mislead dec as has been suggested anyhting is better than A109xx|pg||
nt|garnetts: But it could be used to suggest a save?  |pg||
nt|athene: in a lower-ranking suit at game-all? you don't want to be saving that often|pg||
nt|athene: if you weren't shapely enough to bid over 1@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: True--but can someone tell me that double has any useful purpose |pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|daman: not I, said the walrus|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

nt|daman: 12 board rounds|pg||
nt|daman: looks like we will do 11 and 12 and then revert to board 1|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|daman: this has the makings of a partscore   EW have to be careful not to win it :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: This has the potential for geeting too high--2@S is a make |pg||
mb|r|mb|2C|nt|daman: yes 2@S is the max|pg||
nt|garnetts: I hate the double |pg||
nt|garnetts: Should cost |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Unless South helps out lol|pg||
nt|daman: 2@S will end the auction|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|garnetts: It raises an interesting issues about actions after redouble--and also the nature of redouble itself|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: It also raises issues about the sanity of East :)   3@C is a penalty try as is 3@S |pg||

pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|c4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well he bid 2@D which should show a weakish opening ---North heard and still doubled 3@C and South has hard values not a quacky hand --so pass is obvious |pg||

nt|daman: Hi David|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well if two doctors were present they start committal procedings :)|pg||
nt|daman: North will have a dilemma over a weak 2 @H from West|pg||
mb|1H|nt|daman: sorry|pg||
nt|daman: 1@H|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: would we pass and then back in later?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: What is wrong with 1@S?  |pg||
nt|garnetts: Double is not an option in my view|pg||
nt|daman: the t/o double will inspire South to get busy in the minors|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|daman: I would pass or bid 1@S|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I am sure that 3@S shows a great deal more than North has got |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|daman: playing normal bridge it should|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Also South has an obvious 4@S bid --why bid 4@C ?|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|daman: North showed his preference?|pg||
nt|daman: in the minors?|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: 5@D may actually make --|pg||
nt|daman: gag|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|garnetts: West will do well to duck the K@D |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|daman: of course|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|daman: now a @C|pg||
nt|garnetts: I I had bid like that it would get doubled and go for 800 and now it makes the rest via a squeeze |pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: as far as south was concerned, obviously 4@D set diamonds and 4@S wasn't an offer to play, or he surely would have passed it|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h7|pg||

pc|c9|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hQ|pc|s9|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: is this a cue or is it "hang on, we don't want to play at the *5* level, do we??"|pg||
nt|daman: I'm sure there is a lot of eye-rolling at the table right now|pg||

nt|haans: quit right|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: 5@D   ambitious in OR   would have tht 4@S a better bet|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|reisig: 6@d is not a bad spot ...but fails|pg||
nt|dima:  But I think following suit preference @s 3 from Partner North could just play @d A and a @D|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|andreasw:  will they reach it?|pg||
nt|dima:  I think they will get to 4@s|pg||
nt|haans: may miss game now|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S???|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzmr: we'll see for the few moments|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@h now?|pg||
nt|dima:  They play reasonable weak jump overcalls, so 1@s + 2@s shows reasonable nonminimum hand|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|andreasw:  yep|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: Some use 3@h here ..asking a stopper|pg||
nt|haans: ok |pg||
pc|h8|nt|haans: best with opps bidding is that if you bid you do show a 6 carder|pg||
nt|dima:  Depends aa bit on partnership agreements :) Frensh style tends to promise values when you bid|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|ady: defence does best not to take A@D|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: stop in 5 well done :)|pg||
nt|reisig: this time ..it's right :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: yes but still 6@D is good contract|pg||
