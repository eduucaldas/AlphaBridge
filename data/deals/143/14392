mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@h makes... just have to bid it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can make 4@S even on best defence, but it's very tough after @HA and another, the defence Roy Welland got at the other table|pg||
nt|tsadek: seems all pairs play transfer today|pg||
mb|1H|an|alerted|nt|mittmouse: so does 5c|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You need to guess very well|pg||
nt|joest:  yes increasingly frequent Tarejk|pg||
nt|joest:  tarei|pg||
nt|joest:  how about tarek|pg||
nt|joest:  1@s is a takeout that denies diamond length|pg||
nt|joest:  in the Garner-Weinstein scheme of things|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  dbl = 3 spades I'm pretty sure|pg||
nt|mittmouse: hard to reach 4h now|pg||
nt|sharynr: what do you think East should bid, George|pg||
nt|sharynr: would you risk a 2@h bid|pg||
nt|mittmouse: because he has 4 little diamonds i sort of like a 2h bid from e|pg||
nt|sharynr: me too|pg||
mb|1S|nt|migry: 1@h =S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mittmouse: with the right s guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  may not need guess if they don't switch to @s|pg||
mb|3D|an|alerted|nt|tsadek: now 3@S like the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To be fair, East allowed 4@S to make when Welland made a tiny error|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @HA and another, ruffed. Then a club off dummy|pg||
nt|joest:  I would be mildly surprised if Richter accepts|pg||
nt|mittmouse: he might raise now billy is very solid|pg||
nt|sharynr: 3@H now looks right|pg||
nt|migry: and 1@s is 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think many would open the East hand|pg||
nt|migry: west could have made a game forcing relay|pg||
nt|lml: that would be fine if he had 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|mittmouse: wd |pg||
nt|sharynr: Richter might have tried to block earlier with a 3@d bid though|pg||
nt|mittmouse: s deserves this to happen he should bid 2s and now they are out of the auction|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: richter's pass of 2@D made this relatively easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  7 imps were gained on Board 36 where EW stopped in 2@s making 5|pg||
nt|mittmouse: y this check and raise approach never works|pg||
nt|migry: or show both his suits with a game force and 5-5 |pg||
mb|4D|nt|Vugraphzfc: Aker was not sure that Richter has 3 spades|pg||
nt|joest:  Thanks operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  3NT seems a trifle odd withonly Jxxx of hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Here it won't help you to guess well|pg||
nt|lml: West has a big hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tsadek: Weinstein need A@C and swithch to @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Provided that you get best defence|pg||
nt|tsadek: which is very diffuclt to be seen|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Which does not always happen|pg||
nt|joest:  yes a heart switch would be quite a good play|pg||
nt|joest:  ten of clubs is obviously Rusinow|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now i guess 4@D should beg for a sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: From Akers point of view, it would be a HUGE number to sacrifice|pg||
nt|mittmouse: how can u be begging for a sacrifice when u pass 2d not vul vs vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  now declarer needs to guess both queens|pg||
nt|tsadek: @S finess is normal but @D not clear|pg||
nt|migry: 4@s will end the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: the 3 matchs that are on vugraph--essentially no score changes half way through|pg||
nt|migry: they tend to open light so no danger of going overboard with these hands|pg||
nt|lml: 4@S is a bit precarious though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 3@d is 5-5 game force with good qual suit|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: well what is the point of 4@D otherwise|pg||
nt|sharynr: A thoughtful lead, hoping to retain the lead for a switch at trick 2|pg||
nt|mittmouse: true but i dont understand the approach|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|mittmouse: perhaps n should bid 4c originally then s has an easy 5c bid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest:  south will know that west probably has one heart honor (b/c east did not play one from AKQ), + the club Jack + the spade queen|pg||
pc|d7|nt|joest:  so seems to tilt the odds to playing the takeout doubler for the @DQ|pg||
nt|joest:  but these things are a bit easier looking at all 4 hands  :)|pg||
nt|lml: Welland has to decide to finesse the spade if South cashes. |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|lml: less precarious now|pg||

nt|joest:  two great results|pg||

mb|1D|nt|joest:  this looks to be a relatively uneventful 3NT|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|joest:  unless Garner leads a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  well, @d lead certainly would make life a lot easier for the defenders|pg||
nt|sharynr: good lesson H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sharynr: G|pg||
nt|mittmouse: there are probably other ways to reach 3nt|pg||
nt|migry: 1@d is unbalanced so roy "knows" west is short in spades|pg||
mb|2S|mb|4H|nt|joest:  whoa!|pg||
nt|joest:  now declarer might have to guess what is going on in hearts in some variations on the play|pg||
nt|tsadek: he can hear you Jack|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Richter ask for lr=eads|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  1@h should get Ron a little excited|pg||
nt|joest:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: North needs to hit this with his defence|pg||
nt|lml: I think he already showed the strong heart hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest:  they lead 4th est|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: we got there anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|migry: pass was obviously forcing|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|joest:  now the heart ten|pg||
nt|lml: yes.  But I think North should suggest defending|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  your comment was so true, George, on board 37.|pg||
nt|sharynr: see you all later...dinner time|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|andyv:  they bid 6@h in OR and were forced to make it... 13 imps for Welland|pg||
nt|joest:  double dummy could duck and block the hearts|pg||
nt|tsadek: we have to admit that it is a great lead |pg||
nt|tsadek: creat a chance for declarer to misplay the hand|pg||
nt|joest:  i'm mulling over the wisdom of playing clubs first to keep garner on lead |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lml: he already showed a good 6 card suit and a powerful hand|pg||
nt|migry: agree - too much in spades, too little in diamonds|pg||

nt|joest:  he assumed hearts were 4-4 and that he was safe doing what he did|pg||
nt|mittmouse: did he just risk his contract for an overtrick|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Billy is still asking what did happend on prev board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Ron said that Richter took the hook|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|lml: At this point the imp totals are 7-5 perfect for Welland!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  this set not going well so far for the Cohen team|pg||
nt|mittmouse: its going well for the canadian cohen|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting hand for S in this auction|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  as would I quite frankly|pg||
nt|joest:  3@c is one of many type raises|pg||
nt|joest:  artificial|pg||
mb|2S|nt|joest:  worst is a mixed raise.  Best case is balanced 12 or 13 with three card support|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mittmouse: quite a pass by smith |pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: you can't ask for better hands when you are leading|pg||
pc|d9|nt|andyv:  his hand is going down in value with each bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  and S thinks his is going up:)|pg||
nt|sharynr: Smith must be thinking that @C will be getting overruffed..|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: N& E are smilling|pg||
nt|andyv:  Ron always is smiling|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@d here is confusing|pg||
nt|joest:  not supposed to have four trumps in their methods as i understand them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C opener?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  and there is the proof|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: They are still smilling(BOTH), at this moment|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  S had a lot of ways to show support... but this isn't one of them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: RON: I call your bluff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: basically the right yarborough yields a spade game|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|mittmouse: this would have been a good time to be playing fit showing jumps after an ocall 3c fit  tells his whole story|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Mouser: I never heard of this action|pg||
nt|lml: the @D9 is a great lead for declarer|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  i'm pretty old fashioned... either bid 2@d or 2@h  (intending to bid 3@h later) with the S hand.|pg||
nt|mittmouse: it is not easy t come back to playing competitive bridge at a high level after a long break|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i think it is worth 2c especially if the opponents play a strong club at the other table|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Aker: I got to open 2c!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 2@c|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|andyv:  S was a bit creative but N is equally culpable.... does he really believe that S is 5-4 or 5-5 in the minors?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest:  cannot misguess diamonds so this will be a push at  +450|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|mittmouse: i think 2nt would show clubs and diamonds here|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|joest:  when will the next set start?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  so do I.. that's why I think N has some responsibility for this |pg||
nt|lml: declarer will lose a trump trick and a diamond and make 3 for "another boring hand"|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: "last chance," said Roy|pg||

nt|migry: and a great show by the Cohen team|pg||

mb|1N|an|14-16|mb|p|nt|migry: same here:)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|joest:  ok so about an hour from now|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@d is prob a Bergen raise . 4 trumps 6-9 points|pg||
nt|mittmouse: in order to get to a grand u have to find out about the q of s or 3rd rd control in both suits very hard|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest:  2@c = natural|pg||
nt|lml: yes they played even this set but they needed more|pg||
pc|h7|nt|joest:  (and aggressive)|pg||
nt|joest:  2@d feels like a tranasfer|pg||
nt|joest:  transfer|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  3@s |pg||
nt|mittmouse: hard to avoid bidding a slam here|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|sT|nt|poohbear: hmmm failure to cooperate strongly suggests that North treated his hand as a ,imit raise|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mittmouse: that is 1 way|pg||
nt|joest:  this should go quickly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Aker: I did open 2H with hand even when I was 16|pg||
nt|joest:  clubs look to be 6-2 so declarer has a legitimate worry if weinstein has H9x of hearts|pg||
nt|poohbear: limit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|joest:  would need to shake a club on a diamoind if that is the layout|pg||
nt|mittmouse: u need a relay to reach a grand with any assurance|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  well, they did better than I would have... I prefer 3@s over 3@c and then 4@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Smith: Was no unbid suit to guide me|pg||
pc|s4|nt|poohbear: maybe 3@s asked for shortness|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mittmouse: they must not play 2-1 gf otherwise why would he not bid 2nt|pg||
nt|poohbear: and 4@h denied|pg||
nt|mittmouse: if he bids 7 now he would be looking at the hand records|pg||
nt|poohbear: 7 might not be worse than a @s hook if North has 5 black cards only|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or the score|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is getting to swing time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 3@s is slam interest with shortness|pg||
nt|poohbear: what was 3@d?|pg||
nt|poohbear: limit or mixed?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Bergen 4 trumps   6-9 HCP|pg||
nt|poohbear: then he should cooperate|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then 4@C cue was clear|pg||
nt|poohbear: He has max and 2 working dbltns ( likely)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|joest:  forget that|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
mc|10|nt|poohbear: 13 tricks ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hmm|pg||
nt|poohbear: or did he ruff finesse the @ss|pg||
nt|poohbear: ?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: maybe he drew 2 rds of trumps playing safe for 6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Brady had claim 7 on a ruffing finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still make seven by rufffing out diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Than , Ron said that he got 1 trick|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: ruffing spade finesse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: NS just discussing how to make 7 on a ruffing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dont need it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if diamonds dont break you have spade diamond squeeze|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: NS went over boards and comment that on 62 6@h should be only down 1|pg||
nt|stewball: not sure of their methods but \N doesnt seem to have been very adventurous|pg||
nt|lml: thanks everyone and good night|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Cohen congrat Welland|pg||
nt|migry: i heard it was a really pleasant match|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Greg said, if we can not play bridge we at least can be gentelmen|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: match was very friendly|pg||
