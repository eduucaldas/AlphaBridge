pc|d2|nt|gavin:  his partner is a passed hand, so game will be tight at best (maximum 15 opposite 11)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||

nt|stewball: at 100 a trick they wont get hurt|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|bobh1: similar with offshape takeout doubles|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gavin:  there is a HUGE difference between overcalling 1NT when partner is unpassed|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|gavin:  and when partner is passed|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

nt|bobh1: to me it seems better to bid your suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  however if the defense can force out the spade and then play the last @S and ruff with the T@H, they can promote a 2nd heart trick in souths hand|pg||

mb|p|pc|hK|nt|gavin:  and also giving them an extra shot at discovering a big fit in @D|pg||
nt|gavin:  sometimes north will have a hand that cannot afford to bid over 4@S because he doesnt know if his minor fits his partners|pg||

nt|gavin:  i think more practical to splinter if it went pass by south|pg||
nt|gavin:  now you know partner has a big hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: he probably wouldn't have minded a crack at 5@h|pg||
nt|gavin:  east should be leary of south being 6-5|pg||
nt|gavin:  since he is vul against not and has not a lot of controls|pg||
nt|gavin:  he isnt too likely to be 5-5 given all of easts Aces |pg||
nt|bobh1: is this just a cash the @s A and ruff hand?|pg||
nt|gavin:  i think incorrect to cash A@S|pg||
nt|gavin:  risk a situation where north can overruff dummy when spades are 3-0 and play another trump preventing him from ruffing all his losers|pg||
nt|gavin:  he is cold as long as trumps are 2-1|pg||
nt|bobh1: a very reliable person told me its close|pg||
nt|gavin:  i dont see the advantage of it|pg||
nt|bobh1: whether to finesse or play for the drop|pg||
nt|gavin:  if u just take a spade finesse you will claim|pg||
nt|gavin:  if you play the ace first , you risk going down to 3-0 spades and an unfriendly layout|pg||
nt|gavin:  only risk is that south has no clubs and kx of spades|pg||

nt|gavin:  though he isnt really happy with his single @H stopper, its too big of a risk of missing a game by passing|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stewball: who bid 1nt|pg||
nt|bobh1: on the 3@d hand where berk might have doubled they didn't double in the other room either but got it an extra trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: E i think|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gavin:  south made the practical lead with akxx of @C, though a low one would work out much better|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gavin:  knowing when to lead high and when to lead low from akxx or akxxx against NT requires a little foresight to potential entry problems|pg||
nt|gavin:  if you have AKxxx and no outside entries|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gavin:  its extremely important to lead low|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|stewball: how about his long suit|pg||
nt|stewball: or is that unfashionable|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|gavin:  because leading high may prevent you ever getting in again after the suit is set up|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|gavin:  for instance if partner has xx and they break 3-3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bobh1: sontag might have led a @h|pg||
nt|gavin:  after you concede one round then need to be able to get in again to enjoy your winners|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h8|pc|d3|nt|gavin:  with akxx however, there isnt the same risk |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|bobh1: sometimes you float a bid out there, they eagerly bid 1n, and you begin to wonder whether to look elsewhere|pg||
nt|gavin:  you will need partner to have 3 or more to establish the suit|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|gavin:  so leading the ace wont harm you|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|gavin:  here it worked out badly because declarer would likely have let berkowitz have his jack on a low club lead|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|gavin:  but the best chacne at max tricks for sontag was to lead the ace and hope he could drop a doubleton queen somewhere and set up clubs|pg||
nt|stewball: are you so sure of that|pg||

nt|bobh1: 1n was always cold but more tricks were available|pg||
nt|bobh1: to the defense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  4@H goes down on diamond ruffs|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|bobh1: in the other room|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|d|an|2 suits same color|nt|bobh1: and we have a lead change|pg||
nt|bobh1: it seems they are racing along|pg||
nt|gavin:  will be very hard for east to resist bidding 4@S once he realizes he has a double fit|pg||
nt|bobh1: sontag has always been known to be fast|pg||
nt|gavin:  4@S will go 1 down|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|an|heart raise, singleton somewhere|nt|bobh1: i think david will hit it|pg||
nt|gavin:  once north south establish their @H fit, east will know his partner has @S and @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: ew should be defending here tho|pg||
nt|gavin:  yes but kind of random|pg||
nt|gavin:  if the ace of diamonds was the ace of spades then both hands make|pg||
nt|bobh1: as michael rosenberg just pointed out the lead against @hs swings 4 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: berk bid 4H but has taken it back -- looking for director to see if he can take it back; his screenmate has not bid|pg||
nt|bobh1: its a 6 or 2 hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: seems clear to lead the singleton right benito?|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: berk not sure about 2NT now; weinstein wants to know, so Berk is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: weinstein allowing berk to look at hisnotes|pg||
nt|bobh1: is that a good idea?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|vugraphzff: weinstein was more interested in knowing what the bid meant|pg||
nt|bobh1: sure i understand that |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|bobh1: he probably figured berkowitz would eventually remember anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||

nt|bobh1: sher and jackson have made consistently conservative decisions|pg||
mb|1D|an|2+|mb|2N|nt|bobh1: so far its an even match|pg||
nt|gavin:  a pretty good 4@S here north south, though it fails with the spade layout|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|gavin:  another hand where everyone is down 1|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  i really like sontag's 3@S bid|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gavin:  they probably play a convention called "unusual vs unusual"|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobh1: so if they are consistent in the other room they will defend 4@h|pg||
nt|gavin:  where south was able to bid 3@H with a great hand in @S, and 3@S with just a competative hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: but at imps its tuff not to take insurance|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: last hand for this set -- one more set tonight and 4 tomorrow for a total of 90|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|gavin:  sometimes west would avoid doubling on a hand like this to not tell his opponents the trump layout, however the 2NT bid from his partner would have already directed his opponents on how to play trumps|pg||

mc|9|nt|gavin:  it was an aggressive double|pg||
nt|stewball: more like a few pages|pg||
nt|bobh1: not a huge tragedy at imps if they make it|pg||
nt|gavin:  he knows they are a limited hand facing a non weak 2 bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: results available at USBF.org (2010 team trails; then results)|pg||
nt|gavin:  he can almost be sure that his right hand opponent has kqxxx of spades|pg||
nt|gavin:  because he didnt open 1 or 2@S|pg||
nt|stewball: tx all,,good match |pg||
nt|bobh1: right so he has 3 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: probably his pd has another|pg||
nt|stewball: lol..ok uncle|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe 2 more on a good day|pg||
nt|bobh1: on a bad day lose 5|pg||
nt|bobh1: not so terrible|pg||
nt|gavin:  impressive bridge so far|pg||
nt|gavin:  thats what its going to take|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: when he got up from the table, Baseggio said "my double was insane!"|pg||
