nt|bobh1: ns dont have a good fit|pg||
nt|bobh1: but they do have a slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: on this layout|pg||
nt|caitlin: so Meltzer is the 3rd seeded and Weinstein is final qualifier, 14th seeded|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|caitlin: will they find this slam?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bobh1: pretty good slam|pg||

nt|caitlin: correction: Weinstein not final qualifier, just lowest seeded after qualification|pg||

nt|ahollan1: which void to show??|pg||
nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi Linda|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lml: East West can make rather a look of diamonds it appears|pg||
nt|lml: how high do you think they will get?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jonathan Weinstein has choices here:  2@H, 2N?, 4@D|pg||
nt|lml: USBC stands for United States Bridge Championship I believe|pg||
nt|lml: I don't much like 4@D|pg||
nt|lml: the important thing about the South hand is a heart suit and a spade fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one philosophy is NEVER bid a different suit when known 9+ fit -- show fit immediately|pg||
mb|3C|mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: maybe 3@C is their game force raise|pg||
nt|lml: it must be some kind |pg||
nt|lml: of GF raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: this is a coffee hand - 3NT with friendly breaks|pg||
nt|lml: it might have worked out better for West to bid 4NT but his diamonds are so much better than clubs|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|lml: its not tha he has more tricks in clubs, its just that Rosenberg can better evaluate the hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: this is a no double not trouble hand I guess|pg||
nt|lml: do you think Rosenberg might venture a double?  He has an ace and a stiff diamond and some hearts?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: DBL wouldn't be unreasonable at all|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Gerben42: there is some interest in the play, after all declarer only sees 8 top tricks|pg||
nt|Gerben42: he would try to set up a @S in case @H dont work|pg||
nt|barnets: ok hi all|pg||
nt|lml: hi Barnet|pg||
nt|lml: the heart lead was helpful to declarer actually|pg||
nt|lml: since West couldnt ruff it!|pg||
nt|barnets: starngely n/s can make 5@S|pg||
nt|barnets: as dec can pitch a club on the a third heart|pg||
nt|lml: might not get it right on a non-heart lead though|pg||
nt|lml: it takes a brave declarer to put in the @H9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Larsen also in 6@S|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d2|nt|barnets: it would be hard even for mich rosenberg|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Gerben42: quite a horrid lead problem in S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: AND  Meltzer also responded 3@C|pg||
pc|hT|nt|barnets: not to split his heart honours|pg||
pc|h3|nt|barnets: when dec leads one up|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|lml: true |pg||
nt|barnets: then he would get the @C pitch|pg||
nt|barnets: it hink south did too much here|pg||
nt|barnets: bidding 6|pg||
nt|lml: since Feldman cant have the @DA I would probably just cash the @CA now|pg||
nt|barnets: he could have tried with 5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a down-side to @S?|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w were never going to 6@D|pg||
nt|lml: I agree 5@H is better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless 5@H means slam try but no @D control|pg||
nt|lml: I don't think it can really cost to cash the @CA here and if it does its only 50|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|d3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|Gerben42: it is even possible to make 11 tricks with open cards by cashing all non-@S tricks and endplaying N|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: well he does have a count and unless North has 4@D the @CA can't go away I suppose and that would make West's bid pretty strange|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: declarer known to be 5@S 3@H -- what distribution can he have where @CA never takes a trick?|pg||
nt|barnets: no swing|pg||
nt|lml: 4D and 1C|pg||
nt|lml: then the club goes on the heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what happens to 4th @D|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|h2|nt|bobh1: 5@h feels inadequate but what is better|pg||
nt|bobh1: perhaps 4n followed by 5@h?|pg||
nt|caitlin: same play in closed...has lost heart and club ruff|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s9|nt|barnets: so n/s miss a good slam|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: agressive game bidding in the open room led to -1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e. for the few times you bid 6@H and make, there will be more times when a) it goes down  b) partner will no longer bid 5@H when it is right|pg||

pc|dK|nt|Gerben42: after a minimum superaccept (maximum would bid 2NT for example) a signoff to 3@S is still in order|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|cT|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|barnets: 6@S is a great contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough rebid for North over 3@H|pg||
nt|lml: this is one of the problems with not raising in the first place... bidding hearts has an upside and a downside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and now hard for Weinstein to show 3@S|pg||
mb|5C|an|stiff|mb|p|nt|barnets: yes many would bid 3@S over 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: splinter to 5@C downplays may imply not @CK|pg||
nt|lml: Weinstein found a way to make a slam try and show his trump support|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this is downside of 2-controls from North perspective -- auction hasn't helped revealed  location|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: north thinks he has the @DK and @H K or @H ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm big clubber, so often think problem begins with 2@C -- instead of 1@S|pg||
nt|lml: he almost surely has a heart control either the @HA or @HK on the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C with 2 and quasi-3-suiter just seem too tough to unravel|pg||
nt|lml: which isn't all that good for north|pg||
nt|lml: but Weinstein's bids are pretty strong and suggest a source of tricks|pg||
nt|lml: in hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: dec just needs to take 2 diamond pitches on the hearts and ruff a club|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: good guessing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Larsen began with 1@S -- their guessing ended in 5@S|pg||
nt|barnets: no guessing needed|pg||
