nt|Walddk2: On a good day you can make something big when you look at the East hand, but here 4@S is the limit|pg||
nt|offthebend: I personally feel that Tamil Nadu have played more consistent bridge over all during this event  and the results speak so |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: The limit on best defence that is, but you don't always get that as we all know|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4NT!?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Asking for specific aces?|pg||
nt|ady: overboard  and the defence not too difficult|pg||
nt|offthebend: and a spec tells me that Tamil team has rotated their players in strict rotation -- keeping them all fresh :)|pg||
mb|5D|an|0-3|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No matter what 4NT means, I will not recommend it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: A@D lead and north can give suit preference   and either a club or 2nd diamond  will hold to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|offthebend: off to a bad start here - WB I mean |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It makes on a club switch, David|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sridhar should have followed with @D10 I think, as a suit preference signal for hearts|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|d8|nt|ady: unless playing reversed signals surely north should have played a big diamond|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Liz McGowan|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good afternoon everybody|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: It turns out that a trump was a safe exit|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon|pg||
nt|offthebend: Hi Liz Hi David |pg||
nt|ady: hi Subhash|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: 10 IMPs down the drain for no reason|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|offthebend: Sridhar should be giving count in the C instead of throwing those Diamonds -- sunder then knows exact shape and hangs on to all his Clubs only  |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|d9|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c3|pc|dJ|nt|cuttysark: Yes, he shgould pitch all his clubs, then South can play him for a heart guard|pg||

pc|cA|nt|ady: 10 imps for the leaders|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzau: director call|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's fair to say that if you think 4NT is the right bid with that hand, you will lose IMPs too often and you even deserve it|pg||
nt|ady: auction in CR   2@D   4@S    closer to the mark|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Slam does require partner to have 2 aces, or @CK and an ace - and when is he ever so helpful?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Director call for what?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can't imagine - better not to ask :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Directors usually don't adjust when you misbid :)|pg||
nt|pelu: East called :) - complain that his pd didnt have the cards he hoped for :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: on KC  south  played J@H    but the trick was open and he changed  East called director|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: :) @@ Peter:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|offthebend: hi Peter |pg||
nt|pelu: hi all - nice to be back in India|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would often like to ask a director if my partner is allowed to bid that way|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: sorry on CA  South pplayed J@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he found a club before the next trick?|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: yes   the trick was still Open|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Must have thought the spades were going on forever|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, in that case @HJ just becomes a major penalty card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It won't help declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: thats  whats conveyed to East|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzhs: e/w std|pg||
nt|drkvas: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E hand looked like it might be better served to bid 2@h michaels if they play that|pg||
nt|andyv:  not that W would get very excited|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Welcome All from Chenai India |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Welcme Raju|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Welcome |pg||
nt|suketbombi: unless he playing with chotan in other room|pg||

nt|vugraphzhs: other room Kachchu and Chotan|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: precision may make it easier for n/s to find their spot |pg||
nt|sybarra: which looks like about 3 @D max |pg||
nt|wygbe1: are ns playing weak nt?|pg||
nt|shevek: aren't we happy when opps bid OUR suit?  :)|pg||
nt|sga1: Now what N plans to do?|pg||
nt|sga1: 3NT?|pg||
nt|xenya: we are -- until partner bids our void at the 3-level|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: hi Raju/Sudhir/Nicoleta|pg||
nt|shevek: looks good from where WE seat :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: and Vladimir|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|suketbombi: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: N/S NT 15-17|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome dr. K |pg||
nt|xenya: somehow i fail to understand N's second pass|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|wygbe1: many would open n hand 1nt if 15-17|pg||
nt|andyv:  good evening everyone|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andreasw:  this should just be flat board|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good afternoon from Manchester UK|pg||
nt|andreasw:  hello|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Kath|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Welcome Kath|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, a bit strange...|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this could be down with a @h switch now and a @d back|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  certainly not too much to the play|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|shevek: I would just bid 2@c|pg||
pc|d7|nt|wygbe1: must have downgraded for no aces - it worked out since 4s down|pg||
nt|drkvas: @h now will prevent@c ruff |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|shevek: I know it's a bit strong for that, but void in pd's hand....|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzhs: morning Andy and welcome|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 4@H needs JT soubleton @H aFter 2 @Ss are cashed but no will have to settle for 1 dn with doubleton @HK comming down|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yo_yo: just a question of not getting too high|pg||
nt|drkvas: 140|pg||
nt|sybarra: not everyone would open 1 nt with S hand (with stiff K of @D) |pg||
nt|sybarra: but it worked |pg||
nt|drkvas: they r the strongest pair of their team  iguess will try things to over come the deficit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  dblton @s slowed down both N and S|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|andreasw:  S was endplayed sry|pg||
pc|sT|mc|10|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 600 is a very good result as 4@H can go down |pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: diamond lead may cause a problem   |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can 3NT always make is the question|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pelu: @c6 will be the stopper - but communication problems|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|ady: 6@C 2nd stoppper   but communications a problem|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|reisig: GREAT   :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Indeed, 4th best would have been better, but I think the defence can still prevail|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Great advertisement for 4th best from your longest and strongest|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: in Cr @D-lead - hold up by S and @d again - now S played on @h and no entry for West to the @D-s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Then decalrer could play low from dummy....|pg||
pc|s8|nt|reisig: now ...where have I heard that before?|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Could declarer not have made it after a heart was allowed to hold? What if he turns he attention to spades after that?|pg||
mc|9|nt|Walddk2: Oh well, they gave it anyway|pg||
pg||

nt|yo_yo: yes good for them!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: like these claims as operator:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: easy to get carried away by that lovely south hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do they play strong NT?|pg||
nt|andyv:  precision|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if so  here it comes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's the range?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: e/w nt 14-15...n/s 15-17|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand looks NTish no matter what the range is|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y es ok 6 imps and west bengal B is now in lead|pg||
nt|wygbe1: south would have to suppress his major, which is reasonable given the secondary cards and spots in the other suits|pg||
nt|drkvas: a quite start last set started with a grand slam:)|pg||
nt|granguru: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to John Plaut|pg||
nt|granguru: namaste prakash|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and to our operator, Mahesh|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Welcome John and Roland|pg||
nt|sga1: S got a chance to make in OR.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: u mean @S were not cashed?|pg||
nt|sga1: Freaky boards looks like this Set.|pg||
nt|sga1: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: yes they cashed @sAK|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes  a club pitch wud have seen an enplayed south|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: ty mahesh|pg||
nt|sga1: No they didn't in OR shifted after @s A|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oh mahesh U showed the @SQ i was shocked|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: sorry|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: 6 @D might be more likely |pg||
nt|yo_yo: now  what do NS play as defence?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sfoxa:  hello, Shirley, hi to all|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps easier also |pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Sveta, welcome |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wouldnt pass|pg||
nt|sga1: He played @h wrong A and Q|pg||
nt|suketbombi: other room did not Alok should have made this one tho after @HA|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  hehe |pg||
mb|d|nt|suketbombi: true but a 4-4-3-2 is always a good reason not to supress|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you leap to 4 or bid 3?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  2@s look normal|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6 card major, too much chance of a game for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: tired so cant see the black suits :(|pg||
nt|andreasw:  dbl?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: if 2/1 ish, E has not reason to go leaping around yet |pg||
nt|sybarra: but this bidding may stop them in 4 @S |pg||
nt|granguru: will NS be able to win 3NT|pg||
nt|suketbombi: if @HA does not fetch T or J have to finesse @Cs and hope for the best in @HS|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  vul probably stopped S|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably not my choice |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think S felt he had to do something with 12|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: unlikely to go beyong 3nt|pg||
nt|andreasw:  maybe 3nt or pass?|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes pard bids @D's|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzhs: thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: sad opportunity missed here |pg||
nt|shevek: @sA lead, switch to @d2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|wygbe1: 6d is a terrible contract but can be made if you can see through the cards|pg||
nt|suketbombi: show up squeeze after the minors are through|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sudhir Aggarwal|pg||
nt|shevek: the 2nd @s loser got away|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes but at this vUL does not want pd to pass out hence shows values and some tolerance for @HS i guess|pg||
nt|suketbombi: and a clear prefernce for 3nt tho |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S shut the auction off |pg||
nt|sga1: Hi all|pg||
nt|granguru: contract is asked at least|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Welcome Sudhir|pg||
nt|granguru: now to the TASK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|granguru: I think easy 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sga1: The bidding on Both boards is contrast in both rooms. S opened 4@h in 1 and N opened 4@s in 2 in OR.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  spot cards aren't exactly encouraging to bidding with S hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andreasw:  should get the @h ace away first after he can play on @s|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sga1: may be 10|pg||
nt|granguru: @H being 3-3 and well placed probably defense could never have beated this contract|pg||
nt|sga1: Here they opened 1@h and 1@s only.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|granguru: best for west is @HQ|pg||
nt|granguru: then after N ducks SMALL @h|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzhs: decl thinking|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|sga1: However contracts were same.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but 2 suits|pg||
nt|granguru: excellent defense|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|panja: hi all|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sga1: well done|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|granguru: declarer was at his hight|pg||
nt|sga1: Defense has to cash out now|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h4|nt|granguru: to avoid overtricks|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|andyv:  I agree Kath... I would have bid but then I don't pay much attention to -1100:)|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: When West refused to win the second heart, declarer could have made it by force by playing on spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|reisig: anyone overcall - 1@d?|pg||

nt|ady: east playing catch up     but will get further behind|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What's wrong with 1NT?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: 1NT is too "normal"|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|pelu: but the 3Nt bid - pd fight for the partscore - and u just kill him :) - I know that EW was down 45 IMPs, but East try to make miracles - and will pay|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|cuttysark: Similar situation in the last set: West bid after passing wice and East passed his 15 count 3 times. Maybe this East should have been watching|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Summer_Nationals/2010/External_Page.el  only website I have |pg||

nt|vugraphzhs: not in this room:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in the other room then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: cant see other room|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@S 4th suit FG|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 3@d: no @H support|pg||
nt|sga1: Board 1 contract 4@h, one hand void in @h, Board 2 contract 4@s one hand void in @s, this hand let us see.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: but alas 3 tricks for e/w more likely |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i might double with the West hand  andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  quality of @h suit makes me prefer dbl|pg||
nt|granguru: no 4@S|pg||
nt|shevek: east assumed East had 6 cards|pg||
nt|shevek: West|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  easier now|pg||
nt|drkvas: now 200|pg||
nt|drkvas: cash board|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|panja: this is the moment of truth...|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 4@D is likely to prevail due to friendly @SS inspite of bad @D break|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes it's not great, 10 high|pg||
nt|granguru: wonder what 3@S would have now meant|pg||
nt|granguru: it is better to have 3N being bid by the @SQ hand rather than the @SA one|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: could make all the tricks now |pg||
nt|sybarra: easier from here of course |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  altough not a piece of cake|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|sga1: I think NRK manouvered also for this.|pg||
nt|xenya: yet another non-making game|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i dont get why east not bid 1nt first|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what do we do here, bash out trumps and rely on the @D finesse?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  finesse @h and drop a @c on @s return|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: well bid|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @H is a natural winner with N along with @DA this contract is doomed anyway|pg||
pc|s9|nt|granguru: the lead is by no means so bad as it may look|pg||
nt|sga1: it is a good lead, NRK will duck.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: easy for us at this "altitude"  playing for @S's  2/2|pg||
nt|sybarra: and agree,  not sure he has an option |pg||
nt|granguru: As a matter of fact it is better to let the trick be won by the defense|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: on the right track so far |pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: that told S play the spade |pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: at least that is what my pard says to me |pg||

nt|vugraphzhs: West Bengal B 58....Mahrashtra DP 41|pg||
nt|sga1: i agree but since u and me were not there it gave chance to other Teams as well :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yo_yo: i prefer to bid @H but Gupta obviously knows what he is doing  (i hope)|pg||
nt|granguru: even by S|pg||
nt|xenya: well they could stop in 2@H here i think -- actually E's 4@H was a stretch|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  interesting deal - EW can manage +130 or 140, but NS can preempt with @c |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|drkvas: 11 bds 36 imps guj really needs some huge swings  last 1 was possible 800 if dbl n@s lead|pg||

mb|3C|nt|andreasw:  thsi dos not look good for N-S|pg||
nt|andyv:  the price is not right for N on this one|pg||
nt|yo_yo: why did Gupta have to bid at all|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes could make by just playing to set up spades and planning on losing 2d and 1c - by managing entries better 42 spades good enuf|pg||

nt|andreasw:  or missunderstood 2@d?|pg||
nt|andyv:  or @s and another (not clubs) and 3@d was pass or correct|pg||

mb|4D|nt|sybarra: will be glad no higher than 2 |pg||
nt|granguru: even with 2 unsefull queens|pg||
nt|sga1: EW in 4@h in OR -3 likely.|pg||
nt|babs59: this will go at least -1, more if diamond ruff allowed|pg||
nt|sybarra: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: n-s will do to get a @C parial here|pg||
nt|wygbe1: optimistic bid by w, very beatable|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oops 4@S is interesting here|pg||
nt|sga1: Same bidding in other room as well. Why not, we are watching some of the best players.|pg||
nt|granguru: they have only 17 useful points|pg||
nt|sybarra: so what was 3 @H?  just forcing?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  here i dont think Badal really had a choise|pg||
mb|4N|nt|andyv:  hard to comment on the 6@s bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i sympathise with Gupta , he has an enormous hand|pg||
nt|sga1: Only difference 4@h was doubled by W.|pg||
nt|granguru: reasonably|pg||
nt|xenya: can't escape it|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  yes. good decision to stop as low as possible. seems reasonable, if partner is limited to 15|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @DQ|pg||
nt|sga1: So 9 imps to TN would be leader once again after this.|pg||
nt|babs59: yes, on the diamond lead|pg||
nt|shevek: not penalty, just good hand|pg||
nt|shevek: they got there nevertheless|pg||
mb|5H|nt|andreasw:  S look his partner in the eye's and saw @s AKQ and went to slam only problem was that N blink to many times|pg||
nt|suketbombi: borrow  a@S Kachchu:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhs: cant see each other ..screens|pg||
nt|andreasw:  well there is the problem|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he felt the vibes then  :) |pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but got them wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: was trying to recover last board..south|pg||
nt|sandip2006: on @s lead|pg||
nt|drkvas: 4@s good spot makes|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: so the 1st dbl by Sunit|pg||
nt|granguru: but the bidding suggests not to double|pg||
nt|sga1: Kiruba didn't believe his partner will produce a trick. So he decided to pass.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  ask for stopper maybe?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 6@D can be made on this hand due to lack of @H communication  and a ruff and sluff in the end postion after elimination :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: E asking if its his lead?  |pg||
mb|6D|nt|andyv:  rkc might have taken care of that problem|pg||
nt|drkvas: a making contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: with @D over ruff positio will end up lossing 3 @Ss and a@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: can chandu manage that:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they sure need the point's|pg||
nt|suketbombi: only @C lead difficult to find|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|sybarra: and then S has the bad break to contend with |pg||
nt|andyv:  always a bad policy to chase bad results|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's on a finesse |pg||
nt|suketbombi: vow|pg||
nt|andreasw:  think a@c lead is fair enough|pg||
pc|cA|nt|panja: shd now switch to @SJ...at trick two|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Gujarat are panicking|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or a drop|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: bad luck|pg||
nt|andyv:  did N have to have the 10@s?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: true|pg||
nt|yo_yo: realise they are doing badly and trying to catch up|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: good result for Gujrat this board|pg||
pc|hA|nt|panja: what will S play after @H?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|panja: Ariz hasn't thought about that...|pg||
nt|sandip2006: venky should bid 3@d|pg||
nt|panja: E hand will be squeezed in the meantime..that will help South choose a benign shift|pg||
nt|babs59: they are keeping the match close, but swinging every 2nd hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well he is for sure not going to lead a trump, and a heart looks wrong, and N made a neg double so club is veyr likely choice|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|suketbombi: unreal|pg||
nt|granguru: you should count 0 defensive tricks on a non vul preemtive overcall or opening bid|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|panja: note that Venky does not know @CQ is dropping|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes true but had to be found|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a certtain surprise value in location of spade queen due to the 2H bid, otherwise spade might get the nod|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he cant get rid if everything in both hands can he? |pg||
nt|andreasw:  -1 no squezz|pg||
pc|d3|nt|suketbombi: no now -1 for sure|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|sga1: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a squeeze but it only produces a trick that is already there:)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|wygbe1: might eke this one out at this stage|pg||
nt|suketbombi: squeeze is for the 11th trick which can be ached by CR:)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d4|nt|sybarra: that did not help score of n/s |pg||

nt|sybarra: and fun,  I like the speed balls, |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: hope they played speed ball in nationals:)|pg||

nt|andreasw:  E-W shoudl reach 4@s or 3nt here and go down:(|pg||
nt|yo_yo: any comments Mahesh?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: silence all around|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very good|pg||
nt|panja: good play by Venky..if @CQ did not drop, he would have reverted to @S finesses|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant bring myself to say WD :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: cant lead @c with KX west...|pg||
nt|sybarra: my other comment would be "not great defense" |pg||
nt|yo_yo: no one would lead a @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont think W can find the club lead either |pg||
nt|sybarra: needs some swing bds |pg||
nt|drkvas: the dbl shd have come in the previous bd|pg||
nt|sga1: NS would not believe that they lost imps after this wonderful bid here.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sure make it as interesting as possible|pg||
nt|xenya: nice slam here|pg||
nt|sga1: Rather cold shud be easy to bid and make.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will bump into it by sheer hcps|pg||
nt|suketbombi: all the while prabha was playing for 5@HS with kachchu still ud have made here|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  venky shd be surely thowing his @C9 |pg||
nt|marlowepi: cruel game, if only he had more aces and kings|pg||
nt|andreasw:  paraguay scored!!|pg||
nt|suketbombi: not that it matters but always safe to do that|pg||
nt|suketbombi: vow:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: again I will say, if one opens off shape 1 nt  as S did, maybe should bid 3 @D over 2 @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: surely a precision club now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: n/s playing precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: e/w std|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: does N say X or just bid spades? |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's not the hit! a kib from Norway informed, that they play speed ball as 9 minutes for 3 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: sorry |pg||

nt|andreasw:  this can't be right?|pg||

nt|drkvas: hello andy welcome |pg||
nt|granguru: there is a chance to climb to 6 in a minor here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: 4 @H may be more of a challenge |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: they dont have TV here or could have watched football :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: taking bull by the horns, as we say,  he just bid it |pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: you missed Roland slam last board Raju :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will find an ace missing  kachchu would not believe this:)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andreasw:  another strong @c?|pg||
nt|panja: interesting play |pg||
nt|panja: @HQ will get ducked I guess..but W has @DK entry for @H's|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has Vahalia shown 5@D and 4@C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe just clubs so far |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: should be good result for n/s this board...5@c or 5@d|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope they dont bid another slam |pg||
nt|granguru: no chance, ofcourse|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we will have to tell you soccer scores then |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: watching on net :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: 0-1 55 mins|pg||
nt|sybarra: (the window behind vugraph ) |pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but this one doesn't look that strong|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes should be 5/4 either way|pg||
nt|drkvas: trump lead|pg||
nt|granguru: 3NT is a solid contract as the cards lie|pg||
nt|sga1: No way.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhs: yes..with this slow play can see score atleast|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at least, this board is "nothing special"|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: but still |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 5/4 either way, thanks to specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Vahalia thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: being red may slow him down |pg||
nt|yo_yo: bid up Vahalia!|pg||
nt|sga1: 3NT right contract. 3NT shows no 4-card major if 3@c was Puppet Stayman.|pg||
nt|granguru: looks like puppet|pg||
nt|granguru: Baron I was excplained..but then N should have said 3@D|pg||
nt|sga1: If 2NT is 20-21, kacchu wont beleive A is missing.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: with those poor pips i ma not sure 2nt opening is justified|pg||
nt|sga1: believe|pg||
nt|sga1: I agree Raju|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good 2D bid but pass by W is surprising|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  may be, try @h and fast claim?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: obviously, 3n was going down, but south didnt like position of club k for defense|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: 6-4 bid one more |pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult to Ariz to bid after a slow double|pg||
nt|granguru: explained*|pg||
nt|sga1: Difficult to believe, no one plays Baron on 2Nt opening (IMO)|pg||
nt|granguru: as Baron asks to start bidding 4-cards suits up-the -line|pg||
nt|suketbombi: the quality of the game  from here is only going to be erratic as WB will desperately hope against Hope fore some swings|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3@d bid was also agood bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hope is kibitzing|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  normal contract|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the lead is with North (poor thing)|pg||
nt|andyv:  @h|pg||
nt|andreasw:  with gupta two bids they could have ende't up in 3@s|pg||
nt|drkvas: ho god|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: ai |pg||
nt|drkvas: :)|pg||
nt|sga1: with points in short suits also|pg||
nt|babs59: but Chotan is trying to play all the hands.  haven't you noticed?|pg||
nt|babs59: 4 of the first 5 to North...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  which will give W a chance to dump 2 @ds after pulling 2 rounds of trump|pg||
nt|yo_yo: never with that strong west hand surely|pg||
nt|suketbombi: was a good board for gujrat but -5 now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4NT  would have brought home the bacon for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes it's good not to know a convention|pg||
nt|xenya: reaonable auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: will have a smoke break after this board|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he should be ok with a @C and max 2@HS to loose|pg||
nt|shevek: of course Mahesh :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: :)|pg||
nt|shevek: same contract is being played in OR|pg||

nt|shevek: bad trump break, but @s finesse on|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oh prabha on lead |pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  wow... nice lead|pg||
nt|sga1: Most of the players today bid NT with 5-card major, that is why Puppet Stayman is so popular.|pg||
nt|granguru: specially 2NT openings|pg||
nt|granguru: as it is in those hands where is it more important to have the strong hand deing declarer|pg||
nt|granguru: being*|pg||
nt|granguru: E knows west cant have more than 1 point|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Prabhakar thinking|pg||
nt|granguru: more than 3 in fact..as N might have 19 instead of 21|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: still waiting for east to play|pg||
nt|granguru: but if W has the S!J then no more than a Q outside..so there is no chance to find a fast entry in his hand|pg||

nt|sandip2006: 5@d for ew|pg||
nt|suketbombi: the gap is widening after a great rally from Gujrat|pg||

nt|yo_yo: are you sure you should broadcast that :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: we had lunch together .... |pg||

nt|suketbombi: those are veg prawns tho|pg||

nt|suketbombi: the catch -all 1@D:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: my bet is on 1 @D |pg||
nt|suketbombi: too weak a suit for 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: do we get veg prawns Raju|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: players out for smoke break|pg||
nt|andyv:  somehow 4 imp loss doesn't do justice to that beautiful auction|pg||
nt|drkvas: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Mahesh:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mahesh has been our hard working operator in this room since beginning,  doing a great job!|pg||
nt|andyv:  if you are going to abuse michaels, you should be 4-5 in the majors as pd with equal length will always chose the lower suit.|pg||
nt|drkvas: yes buddy mahesh are amongt the best vgraph teams gr8 job|pg||
nt|drkvas: good point andy |pg||
nt|drkvas: specs pls note the word abuse|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||

nt|drkvas: because bridge players have the tendency to say andy recommends it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Thanks Shirley and Dr.|pg||
nt|andyv:  oh, they would be in trouble if they followed me:)|pg||
nt|granguru: no 3NT this time|pg||
nt|sga1: TN collecting IMPs in drops slowly and steadily. :)|pg||
nt|granguru: but 4@H is easy|pg||
nt|suketbombi: mahesh i know that b4 you said|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: :)|pg||
nt|shevek: anyway, an unusual lead created an unusual result...|pg||
nt|suketbombi: well defened Prabhakar|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzhs: players asking football score :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  good sportsmanship|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes very nice by west|pg||
nt|sandip2006: n migt bid 41h|pg||
nt|panja: LTT does not quite apply well here...11 card fit for EW, 10 for NS but 11+8 total tricks, NS will make only 8 playing in @H|pg||
nt|granguru: 12 drops against nil|pg||
nt|granguru: around 2 drops per hand|pg||
nt|sga1: 6 Boards 12 IMPs in all|pg||
nt|suketbombi: TN riding high but still lot of bridge to be played here|pg||
nt|shevek: 5@dx by north in OR|pg||
nt|andreasw:  trying to create swing's|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Vahlia might bid 3@H now|pg||
nt|andyv:  we should have a general disclaimer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: multi or balanced?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: keep them updated on scores maybe they play faster?|pg||
nt|panja: to bid or not to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhs: yes sure|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that normal,  it pass 1@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and now they are in game|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok 4 now? |pg||
nt|shevek: yes, 4@h no play|pg||
mb|2H|nt|panja: Kista is pretty enterprising...so Venky must be thinking about covering a daring bid with that pass...|pg||
nt|babs59: you know, Chotan's 2NT last hand almost looks better than Kista's this hand|pg||
nt|shevek: as the @ss lie, great contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: as the @H are @HJ109 in one hand therecant be a trump promotion here|pg||
nt|sga1: Looks like first game swing for WB as EW playing in 4@s in other room.|pg||
nt|granguru: f.i. @SAK ruff @HQ and @Sruffed by E with a high trump...|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 4@H is dn one due to entryles dummy|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2@H is?|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 4@S is an excellent defense |pg||
nt|suketbombi: depends it is matter of when you get in love with your hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  maybe normal but doesn't look right|pg||
nt|sga1: 2@s showed 20-21 with 5@s?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  I'm sure N did not expect to participate in the auction, let alone be the declarer.|pg||
nt|granguru: funny SJ|pg||
nt|xenya: this won't be a success|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andreasw:  the 1@d pass look's okay to me what should he bid|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: well you would have to bid playing any other system|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1NT i suppose|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Vahalia can bid 3@H  because his hand is limited by failure to open strong @C|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andreasw:  i like the pass but then again i would have bid 1@c on S hand|pg||
nt|panja: hi all, this would not be an easy make because of the trump promotion...|pg||
nt|granguru: @SQ was the right play|pg||
nt|sga1: I prefer to play transfer here i.e. 3@h is @s raise and 3@s ask Partner to bid 3NT.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|sfoxa:  S is silent once again. with this hand, overcall seems a must|pg||
nt|sybarra: and likely 2 @S makes sense here |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: was thinking of football game :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes. but now beating 3nt looks like a miracle|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like to try to "jam" the auction, E/W got a free pass here |pg||
nt|sga1: so that strong hand plays.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Hi Panja|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Panja|pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi panja|pg||
nt|panja: Declarer can make by pinning @CT....but that is easier said|pg||
nt|panja: hi Raju, Shirley all|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes but venky here has a reason if u ask him he will tell u he was protecting @CK:)|pg||
nt|sga1: :) :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: right or wrong this wud be his answer:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  now 2 round's of @h |pg||

nt|yo_yo: always making i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: E chickened out of continuing @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: sorry was away...smoke break ...bidding had started|pg||
nt|shevek: a longer auction to the same contract....|pg||

nt|sybarra: he is not listening andreas |pg||
nt|andreasw:  he is watching the match:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: can N find j of spade and her did  but 1 @S, 5 @C and 4 @D...... |pg||
nt|sga1: on a @d lead this could have defeated.|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now not so good|pg||
nt|panja: oh leaving trump in the field|pg||
nt|suketbombi: strange|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kista may not be sure who has the 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: @sk will be 1 down now|pg||
nt|panja: that dbl of 1@H..surely @CQ is more likely to be with E...but N has ignored that clue..|pg||
nt|panja: Kista still not sure about @S situation? or is it about a trump with Venky?|pg||
nt|panja: W hasn't trump echoed....played @H3 and @h8...|pg||
nt|panja: 48 rather|pg||
nt|suketbombi: kista wud take his time but return @S safe an sure he has nothing to kiise here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if his partner has 4 then it's a ruff and sluff|pg||
nt|panja: y, @S seems the best option...but what if Declare had 6@H, 3@D..2@S 2@C>|pg||
nt|panja: then...a @D if W holds @DQ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: would like to thank TCS for sponsoring this tourney|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|sfoxa:  indeed, Shirley, you are right|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|suketbombi: this is the longest i have seen kissta thinking|pg||
nt|andyv:  somehow, pulling trump by declarer doesn't seem right on this hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to send the Dr. seat belt or super glue |pg||
nt|drkvas: lol|pg||
nt|babs59: 4 off in the other room seems excessive|pg||
pc|d7|nt|suketbombi: great double from chotan took them out of making 3nt:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yo_yo: they play precision andreas|pg||
nt|xenya: but possible on a @H lead by S|pg||
nt|babs59: the defence got both spades AND hearts going|pg||
nt|babs59: SK then H switch|pg||
nt|sga1: Defense got 4@h, 3@s and one @d|pg||
nt|babs59: when declarer tried the @SA before @Ds - 8 defensive tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes but AJX was the dummy here|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dT|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  I would have bid 1@h with N hand and allow pd to further describe his hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sandip2006: both hand sq |pg||

nt|vugraphzhs: venky gone for smoke ..brb|pg||
nt|sga1: TN has a chance for swing here as OR missed Game|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes 3nt on the @D hook|pg||
nt|suketbombi: because they play support double W cud not display his streanght may be cud have bid agressive 3@C having denied 3 @S on pd's dbl in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: all back now|pg||
nt|sga1: or 3@h after partner's double.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: east will ofcourse pass and so wll S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhs: easy for me when decl claims :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: they do not play precision as I recall |pg||

mb|p|nt|andreasw:  in my book slam time is all the time:)|pg||

nt|andreasw:  -2 ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a certain attraction to a preemptive 1N in 3rd chair esp at these colours, but really 1d is probably better since you are willing to compete to the 3 level. sometimes 1N ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: misses a D game or heart game|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: wonder why east bid 1 @D? |pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: this hand does not sit well for this bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy to bid 3 nt but they did in the other room |pg||
nt|andyv:  it was in the OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: with no interference |pg||
nt|andyv:  W never bid @ds in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: there was no overcall of 2@d on 1@c|pg||
nt|drkvas: ho they did bid it in the other room now the nail is on gujarats coffin andy:)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: chandu enquiring abt the dbl mahesh?|pg||

nt|suketbombi: bengal supportors are edgy but another 20 bds to g from here|pg||

pc|h5|nt|suketbombi: infact they wud loose an 2 imps here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 20 runs 32 balls decent target for them|pg||

nt|sybarra: no interference and 1 @C-1 @H, 2 nt, -3 nt|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2/4th leads|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oh 20 balls 32 runs sorry|pg||
nt|sga1: max 1 imp|pg||
nt|xenya: hard to see how this can fail|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no reason why he shd not|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is Harbhajan a national hero now after his match-winning 6 against Pakistan yesterday?|pg||
nt|shevek: sry, just noticed, in OR north played in 3@c one off|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||

nt|sga1: will loose 1 imp|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|suketbombi: better game contract than 3nt this one|pg||
pc|d3|nt|panja: it does not promise @D I guess, just a relay..|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so 11 trickÃ¸|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: this can be made but really needs some good guessing |pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s6|nt|yo_yo: 32 HCP   (I like 33...)|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: if W were to open 1D they still probably would play a partial but if somehow game was reached it should be made|pg||
mc|11|nt|sga1: cud be 2 if decl plays for drop of @DQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presuming N uses michaels|pg||

nt|sybarra: could have far worse if 3 nt making |pg||
nt|yo_yo: gosh  a long way to go :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  curious how we never remember our bad slams but always remember the bad ones opps have bid against us|pg||
nt|yo_yo: wrong andy!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: depends on your sex maybe but I do remember my bad slams|pg||
nt|andyv:  you remember your bad ones?  or your pd won't let you forget?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  lool|pg||
nt|yo_yo: actually I dont bid enough slams|pg||
nt|yo_yo: then am disappointed when all the 50% slams seem to make|pg||
nt|panja: misfit..|pg||
nt|panja: smoke break?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: back now..sorry was away|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: yes...all back now|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: me and venky had taken a smoke break|pg||
nt|drkvas: a little unfortunate too |pg||
nt|drkvas: i mean the 4@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  it should have been a push board... no reason for W not to bid|pg||
nt|drkvas: rt|pg||
nt|sga1: OR playing in 3N.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: @d was discarded on 3rd @s so was left with 3 @h east...|pg||
nt|granguru: a trap hand|pg||
nt|granguru: a NHNH|pg||
nt|granguru: or noone has nothing hand|pg||
nt|granguru: bath room again?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: yes all back now|pg||
nt|sga1: As no one smokes there it has to be a bathroom break only.|pg||
nt|granguru: they needed to comb themselves...press is here|pg||
nt|sga1: :) :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: n/s were discussing if 3@d x would have been passed for penalty|pg||
mb|1S|nt|drkvas: 59 in 5 for all practical purposes the match is over|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 5@D good sac on B37....|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Anal Shah will take over ...brb 5 mins|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they get in bidding ? |pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: michaels cue bid  showing @S and a minor|pg||
nt|panja: hi Anal..|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: hi panja|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  those playing weak/strong michaels might just bid 1@s with this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: red sacs are not easy however |pg||
nt|panja: no easy at this Vul|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i prefer to show a 2 suited hand as South|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you Kath |pg||
nt|panja: N shd bid 4@D and leave it to S to judge the rest|pg||
nt|sybarra: want to get this hand off my chest quickly |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S +1 |pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: difficult now, when East bids again Ariz might take him for a stronger hand|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yo_yo: but bidding 1@D has worked OK|pg||
nt|drkvas: sry 6|pg||
nt|granguru: 10s will play roles here|pg||
nt|shevek: hmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: will take a 5 min brak after this board|pg||
nt|xenya: aggressive|pg||
nt|shevek: 2NT not my choice|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  it helps in partnerships to have a firm guideline as to how good or bad your michaels bid can be|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c by EW will have some difficulty with the bad @d break, but 3N should work|pg||
nt|sga1: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: the Michaels weak or strong (but not inbetween) seems popular|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is a 14 count that is more oriented to defence than to @ss|pg||
nt|panja: I guess they won't venture now...|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt it is N taking the sac if anyone does it will be S |pg||
nt|andyv:  @s shift after this|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: @s lead|pg||
nt|sga1: @h switch|pg||
nt|xenya: not mine either, with just Ax as a stopper and only 8 hcp|pg||
nt|sga1: trying to create swing now.|pg||
nt|xenya: i think the natural @HK lead should defeat it |pg||
nt|shevek: good to bid , good to lead, @hK|pg||
nt|shevek: the vulnerability was right for west to be aggressive|pg||
nt|shevek: only 50s as they say....|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like N starting a 3 card raise sequence with 1 nt |pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|andreasw:  if they are lucky they will end up in 5@d 11 tricks but this dosen tlook good|pg||
nt|andyv:  E truly falling in love with his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: need to check east hands,,,might be dealt differnt cards :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  but then again 5@d would problebly fail with @s 4-2|pg||
nt|panja: could make on Xruff..|pg||
nt|drkvas: i see only 8 if def correctly|pg||
nt|sga1: E chose to overcall 1@s in other room. Is that right? or that is the style today.|pg||
nt|shevek: again great lead, definitely Prabhakar man of the match|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  9 imps to Gujarat on board 28 and they take the lead by one|pg||
nt|panja: note the 2@S bid...it shows Blacks...|pg||
nt|drkvas: good|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: Neither North nor South did enough here imo|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|panja: but the trouble is W has only 3 Clubs... |pg||
nt|sga1: The strongest hand W has not taken a bid so far.|pg||
nt|granguru: some minimum chance to win|pg||
nt|granguru: almost nil|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  that was interesting|pg||
nt|drkvas: a small little 6imp swing gujarats  way a bit toolittle too  late|pg||
pc|cA|nt|suketbombi: may misguess the @SQ fot ten tricks|pg||
pc|c9|nt|panja: after @DA or K, W is going to remove trumps...|pg||
nt|shevek: shd continue|pg||
nt|andreasw:  6 boardÃ¸s to gain 51 point's very hard|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: what happened here?|pg||
nt|babs59: Has Chotan's 5@D bid silenced everyone?|pg||
nt|xenya: not E, who doubled happily|pg||
nt|sga1: Not E who took out his sword.|pg||
nt|babs59: except for Kista, of course|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: should Vahalia bid again if his partner can only bid 2@S?|pg||
nt|drkvas: dec not having@s 10 is almost certain|pg||
nt|suketbombi: donno strange :(|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  almost looks like W passed a cue bid but, as Andreas pointed out, @ds are the best contract|pg||
nt|sga1: OR in 4@S likely to make as @S was led.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|andreasw:  board's|pg||
nt|sybarra: should play up to k and back  no misquess then|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  had to win that trick to have any chance|pg||
nt|drkvas: rt|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: fianls tomorrow at 9.15 am local time...|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: finals|pg||
nt|babs59: more overbid than strange|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|sybarra: not much to say here |pg||
nt|sybarra: will scramble home +1 or so |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes ok now |pg||
mc|11|nt|suketbombi: on bd 15 i said chotan displayed restraint and all laughed at me infact 5@D was more logical then comapred to this|pg||
nt|sybarra: but likely a push |pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: West passed?|pg||
nt|pelu: as I have seen by Chotan in this segment : he is going for 6@H :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Why did he open the bidding if it was not for showing the hand as a two-suiter?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C doe snot show extra in my book, just more shape over the double|pg||
nt|pelu: Yes, IF u open - u have to bid 2@c|pg||
nt|offthebend: EW have thrown in the towel Roland :) |pg||
nt|offthebend: and ALMOST sunset |pg||
nt|pelu: no if they have - then West would not open 1@h|pg||
nt|reisig: Is he thinking 3NT?|pg||
nt|offthebend: well he opened 1H hoping partner bids RKC for the grand -- turned into a boring auction for him |pg||

mb|4H|an|!h + !c|nt|suketbombi: what is happening in cricket?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: yes ind/pak game ...score pls|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s a good contract|pg||
nt|xenya: he will have to say it to his teammates later|pg||
nt|suketbombi: not likely to get to the slam Game wud be fine and happy to reach here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: FIT bid|pg||
nt|sga1: :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if u are so mucht behind slam is a good try|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: diffcult opening lead choice|pg||
nt|suketbombi: this 1nt should make tho|pg||
nt|suketbombi: but they are friends and will fight from here i know|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we will see if this is good advertisement for precision or not |pg||
nt|yo_yo: always show the major ( a rule for me)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :) yes good rule but pas may be an underbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: he already overbid last hand so passed now:)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: is it still called agarwala pairs?|pg||
nt|xenya: EW can make 4@S...|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: a @S would have worked, interestingly|pg||
nt|sybarra: but e/w here are ahead,  will see what other room does|pg||
nt|suketbombi: they are ahead :)|pg||
nt|sga1: That is why E has opened the hand as 1@h in OR.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes sry OR should reach slam:p|pg||
pc|d6|nt|drkvas: pass me the seat belt pls:(|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: super glue may be better :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: must say,  N assumed his role again as the agressive one of the n/s pair|pg||
nt|drkvas: :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|shevek: unusual vulnerable sacrifice |pg||
pc|hK|nt|suketbombi: i get many comments from some kibs but let me tell you chotan is one of the finest card players I know and has made  had an off beat/poor bid here let us leave it at that please|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|suketbombi: pak 195 /4 as told by Ajay Bagadia in 37 overs|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Anal is dummy now...Venky gone out for smoke|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Here we Vinay also...so lots of help around|pg||
nt|sga1: Declares has 4@d tricks, 2 @c tricks and one @S.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  only down 500... hardly worth writing home about it|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|shevek: again Prabhakar is the winner|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: ah yes they used blackwood on 29|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|granguru: is a much better bid than pass as if, as it is probable, he needs to ruff @H in dummy E cant overruff|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|andreasw:  and N open'd 4@s not 1@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 29, in OR, S inquired about the Q@s thru rkc and stopped at 5@s when N didn't have it|pg||
nt|sybarra: and up and back again or does he take hook |pg||
pc|dA|pc|h7|pc|d5|nt|sfoxa:  practical approach, especially when partner is known as "passer"|pg||
nt|sybarra: could have made more with hopping ace and playing low spade to j, and back |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wouldnt like to open 4@S with A,K,A|pg||
nt|andyv:  bad luck, as Kath says, cost 13 imps (unless you are on Gujarat team)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  for me it is a clear 1@s bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't mind 1 or 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru: I sould say it is impossible to beat the hand if declarer takes out trumps|pg||
nt|granguru: would*|pg||
nt|granguru: on the other hand a black suit move is risky|pg||
nt|sga1: yes|pg||
nt|granguru: as they are both freezed|pg||
nt|babs59: there could even be an explanation like he saw the 2S bid as from South not West|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|sybarra: can n/s untangle this now?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 10@S suspicious?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kista should have gone for the @S|pg||
nt|granguru: meaning that the one who moves them gives away a trick|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|drkvas: the bds are ticking by n guj losing further ground|pg||
nt|sybarra: some days the breaks just dont come your way :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: 4 boards left |pg||
nt|andyv:  and 4 more imps... there is no damage control anymore for NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: may see them swinging from the rafters now |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: they dont know or would have conceded|pg||
nt|sga1: New leader like after this Board|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  in 2/1, the hand is a 4@s bid as 1@s followed by 4@s is a much stronger (in hcps) hand|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sga1: likely|pg||
nt|granguru: wrong return|pg||

pc|h2|nt|sybarra: and taaadaaaa as they say |pg||
nt|granguru: @C5 lead because they lead low from xx|pg||
nt|suketbombi: now is the moment|pg||
nt|xenya: previous hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  E needed at least the 7@h to be able to lead the 10.. should have just lead 4th best @h|pg||
nt|drkvas: rather 16|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  and this too can go down|pg||
nt|drkvas: andy have a@h yar|pg||
nt|drkvas: :)|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|xenya: well at least this should go down|pg||

pc|c5|nt|suketbombi: he wants them to open up @HS & @CS|pg||
nt|shevek: true, only 1 imp this time|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  very impatient defense... 1N is the most difficult contract to play as declarer and also to defend|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a claim coming up I would think |pg||
nt|babs59: and Chotan's @d9 asked for a heart too, I expect (last hand)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|drkvas: andyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did "we go down" |pg||
nt|andreasw:  bye raju|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|suketbombi: yes the last hand @D9 was yelling|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|babs59: whereas in the other room, on winning DQ, Sridhar tried a club back - now easy for declarer|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sga1: -5 finally|pg||

nt|andreasw:  sry missclick:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and ty Kath and Andreas for being here.  And of course, ty to all the specs for joining us.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: unless 3NT is on!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: 14 more in 3 boards for a century|pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe "careless" is too strong a word|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: and thx again, Mahesh:)  |pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think I'd do anything that was remotely dangerous if I were NS today... like crossing a street...|pg||
nt|sybarra: hardly matters at the end of the day |pg||
nt|drkvas: naughty u|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ns likely to get to 2@Hs here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and certainly do NOT go to a casino |pg||
nt|andyv:  :))|pg||
nt|drkvas: it does the looser can have a drink more because u have a lot more to discuss:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have had days like this havent you?|pg||
nt|andyv:  N probably wondering when S will find his suit this set|pg||
nt|drkvas: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: only 2 bds to go  |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: no casino's in Chennai... nearest is Sri LANKA|pg||
nt|sybarra: so not many more chances |pg||
nt|andyv:  If you have played enough bridge, you have had a lot of days like this|pg||
mb|1S|nt|drkvas: if not suit atleast shirt:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: thanks everyone |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Thank You Kath|pg||
nt|sybarra: lucky them no casinos |pg||
nt|granguru: it is annoying to see the script dissappearing in some instances|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sga1: TN has played excellent Bridge throughout. Well done and Congratulations to the Team with our BFI President Kiruba.|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: the other room reached 2@H  after 1NT  2@C (Majors)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: doubt N really wants to sit with 1 point |pg||
nt|yo_yo: good job mahesh, i know it's not easy|pg||
nt|andreasw:  thx everyone has been great|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh dear  are they getting too high?|pg||
nt|granguru: EW went -2 on the OR|pg||
nt|sga1: Because of comp EW climbed to 3@s.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: i tht that:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: third time the text goes to nowhere|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|andyv:  does 16-18NT make W hand worth an invite?|pg||
nt|panja: I need to logoff, thx all, bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: bye|pg||
nt|shevek: the @h shortage with north points towards the @d fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mahesh is probably ready for the tourney to be over,  he has been excelllent operator throughout |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Thx Shirley|pg||
nt|sga1: This set only one Board was a Push.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sunsamvar: I have great hopes for the Kista Venky pair..|pg||
nt|andreasw:  only 2 imp's diffrent|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will shift to @D 7 still hard to get 7 tricks for def|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: thy may go +1 here |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I can certainly understand playing 3 as white v white (not vul) |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Venky is very steady, conservative and does not give anything away and should compliment Kista's brilliance very well|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzhs: 4@d 1 down board yet to be played in open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: board 33|pg||
nt|granguru: I want to say that 3@H or even 4@H would have been a rather normal contract|pg||
nt|suketbombi: one looser in every suit here should make 3 for 1 imp pick up|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: right andy,  just need the "experience"  (some days nothing right) |pg||
nt|drkvas: yes andy more days like this than the otherway round for me atleast:(|pg||
nt|sga1: Here simple and quiet bidding.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|andyv:  plus for W are the 10s... minus is the fact that hand is full of quacks and no distribution.... you might invite only because of the vul.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Ariz cant get to hand for @S finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: what I love about the jrs  (as a rule)  the are just living thru and laugh a lot |pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  we remember these days more vividly:)|pg||
nt|sga1: absolutely.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|granguru: as the distribution of the suit is terrible, no way to win such a contract here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: he might try another Rabbi's finesse|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|sybarra: ?|pg||
nt|xenya: impossible i think -- they are just setting up 7th trick for declarer|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: for those who dont know the rabbi's finesse is dropping the singleton King offside|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|xenya: not that he was unable to do it himself|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y cannot beat this nt tho 3@CS 2@DS & a@H is best defence can get|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ....|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|shevek: declarer refused the @c finesse|pg||
nt|andreasw:  kista mad it to easy|pg||
nt|andreasw:  made*|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: Sunil we have also seen the "personalities" of N/S  |pg||
nt|sybarra: club pls,  did the 7 of @H ask for that?|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems many jrs.  just think this is part of learning   |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|drkvas: the score sheet does not reflect the capabilities of ns both are very fine players this is one of those days|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|sybarra: N befing much more agressive,  and S being the more conservative one of the pair |pg||
nt|andyv:  2/1 odds on that play |pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: needs the hook I think |pg||
nt|shevek: going 2 off now|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s4|nt|xenya: oddly enough, S in the OR refused to compete with 3@D|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sga1: Now makes 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Shirley or shd it be bYE Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I will leave after this hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: so bye |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Thanks and bye Shirley|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Kerala is a swing team... wud not be suprised to see huge exchange of IMPS in the 3rd session|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx and great fun,  good luck rest  |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: last seg of q/f will resume in 10 mins|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Great work Mahesh|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: has he gone to Sleep ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: ill go to sleep soon|pg||
nt|yo_yo: "Play the Ace when the King is a singleton".   The creator of the Rabbi's Rule is Milton Shattner, appropriately nicknamed the Rabbi.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|sga1: Push|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|andyv:  he did.. his play only works if E held AKx of @hs|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andreasw:  a small would have been right|pg||
nt|suketbombi: does not have the claim button there|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile, 2@H in the other room went down -- 5 imps to the trailing team|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: board 25 was 2nt made 6 as @s q was covered |pg||
mc|10|nt|sybarra: lucky @D's were 3/3 at the end |pg||
