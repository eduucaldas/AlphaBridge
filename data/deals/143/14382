nt|vugraphzjp: by pumping his fist in the air|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: it seems that pumping your fist shows a strong nt|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: sorry for the slow start all...will just claim at the end of this hand for you|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: and pinching your fingers together shows a weak (small) nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: Welcome back everybody, reults of all matches being updated, here http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2010/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzjp: taylor just sighed as 3c was passed back to him|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzjp: tough to find the qs lead here|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: klimo just called for a small diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: nobody believed that is what he wanted though|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mildredb: much better contract thant in the OR|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|vugraphzjp: balcombe needs a lot of exit cards|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|afulton: this looks like a reasonable contract, but the early tap in @c with @s's not breaking well...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzjp: he instinctively pulled out the 4@S and then decided to think about it|pg||
nt|lml: well we can see that it doesnt matter|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|peachy: Team rosters here http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&event=18&task=list and if you click on the player name, you get system summary of what they play|pg||
nt|mildredb: defense did great by leading trump|pg||
mc|7|nt|mildredb: am informed that n/s is lall & lall|pg||
nt|peachy: north is Hemant Lall, not Kevin Bathurst in this segment|pg||

pc|d8|pc|h7|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h4|mc|9|nt|daman: looks like -1|pg||
nt|daman: I think he had a shot at making that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: They are calling the director|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: what is the director call for matt?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Beatty was told that 2@h was takeout while george was told michaels, they are taking issue with it|pg||
nt|daman: must be some form of misinformation perhaps|pg||
nt|daman: I think he still should make it    esp after the @D switch|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: there is a heated argument going on right now about whether or not that makes a difference|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: the result will surely stand...|pg||
nt|daman: absolutely|pg||
nt|daman: NS are trying to get something for nothing|pg||
nt|daman: even if trumps are 4-2   he should play AK of @Hs|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: 4-1? :)|pg||
pg||
qx|c47|st||md|1SK8HT9654DAJT87CJ,S97652H87D9CAK986,SQ4HAK3DKQ54CQT72,SAJT3HQJ2D632C543|sv|n|mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: no worries Bob, being an operator is like a long tailed cat in a room full of rocking rocking chairs|pg||
nt|mildredb: looks like a flat 4@H hand|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|afulton: Unfortunately, they had a better fit in @h's but you don't always get what you want!|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|lml: its possible to make 5@D but requires some guessing ... 3NT on a heart lead will not make|pg||
nt|lml: if you lead the @H2 you could block the suit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lml: that is one of the reasons your bridge teacher tells you to lead the @H10|pg||
nt|lml: Gord has learned that lesson!|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lml: so Ross knows he needs another trick even if he guesses diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: he could try to sneak a club threw|pg||
nt|mildredb: most likely the X = 3@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|afulton: that is the one difficult card to read if you are playing 3/5 leads v suits|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: playing the @D10 was not best|pg||
nt|lml: his teacher would have told him that too|pg||
nt|lml: it was never going to gain and here it gave up the diamond suit|pg||
nt|lml: so now Ross could try to sneak the club threw or run diamonds and put pressure on his opponents|pg||
nt|lml: hoping that the long hand gives up a heart|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|afulton: (i meant the 8@c's)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|lml: thats the good thing about being a very good player ... nobody believes you made a mistake|pg||
nt|stewball: hi everyone|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: Ross was sure that Campbell had a doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|lml: he doesnt actually need to cash out at this point|pg||
nt|lml: yes than you the name grosvenor can be heard wafting around|pg||
nt|lml: if they cash out it will make the play go faster so I am for that|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|lml: they took the slow road|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|lml: this will now go very slowly .......|pg||
nt|lml: Klim can throw a spade on the next trick so he is comfortable but campbell isnt sure what to throw|pg||
nt|lml: a heart cant be that wrong|pg||
nt|lml: but which black card|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: exactly what is happening|pg||
nt|lml: what is the @C9 telling him|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: he is mouthing numbers as he is thinking...counting something...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: or possibly some sort of western canada prayer|pg||
nt|lml: trying to figure out where the rest of the high cards are|pg||
nt|lml: what can Piotr have?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: he almost played a card|pg||

nt|vugraphzjp: The N/S pair are playing a weak NT (11-13 in first and second seat, 12-15 in third and fourth)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: The E/W pair are playing a strong club system|pg||
nt|lml: I am sorry I cant stay but I have family arriving.  I will check the results later tonight.|pg||

nt|vugraphzjp: this reminds me of the start of the last session|pg||
mb|1C!|an|Big|nt|ahollan1: both pairs playing Big Club|pg||
mb|d!|an|majors|nt|stewball: agrressive entry by Kit at these colors|pg||
nt|peachy: Precision Club|pg||
mb|1D|an|0-7|nt|stewball: 2nt leb likely|pg||
nt|afulton: he is colorblind|pg||
nt|mildredb: looks like Mathe for defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS convention card at   http://usbf.org/docs/2010usbc/acblcards/LallLall.jpg|pg||
nt|mildredb: 1@D most likely is 5-7|pg||
nt|peachy: South should be aggressive with  doublefit|pg||
nt|mildredb: while a pass = 0-4|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: after the DBL -- Wold 1@D probably 5-7 or 6-7|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry MB |pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzjp: We unfortunately had a slow start getting going this morning...One of our operators got stopped by the police for speeding on the way here|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: and then we had issues with her Internet connection|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: but all is up now...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: i guess some 7 counts are better than others|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|vugraphzjp: I believe 4th best leads|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: UDCA for E/W|pg||

nt|mildredb: great lead by Jacobus|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was this unlucky or should Hemant have guessed to play his stronger suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: coulda been 5-7 but thought he wrote 0-7, double makes me think the former|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: it takes a @S ruff to beat 4@H   and 4@S is gin I think|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: only played from kranyak's side, i believe|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jlrice: yes   could set with a heart lead from E|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|daman: where would we all end up on this hand    would we sit for 3NT?|pg||

nt|jlrice: they are playing 4H   which will likely have the same fate as 3NT|pg||

nt|daman: I agree|pg||

mb|2N|nt|jlrice: with the interference; NS might save over 4S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C covers NAT & BAL game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: another minus score for EW |pg||
nt|afulton: this should be push board|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: this should make 6 with both finesses working|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: campbell says 'nice hand'...because one of them needed one!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzfg: N/S - stand carding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here's another link -- this one is the KO Bracket   http://bridgewinners.com/knockout-bracket|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzjp: sry...had to walk away for a minute...will claim for yuo at the end of the hand...|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|jlrice: 4S has 3 losers off top   but wont be able to get to dummy to try to finesse the spade so will drop the Q|pg||
nt|peachy: spade switch would have been successful, this gives declarer a chance|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzjp: now campbell needs to sneak a club through|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|afulton: it's easy when we can see that the @d's break|pg||
pc|hA|nt|peachy: declarer taking a long time to think (or we have a trechnical issue)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: bart is in deep thought|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: i believe he is trying to work out lall's count|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: indeed|pg||
pc|h8|nt|peachy: but of course it is double dummy, I see all four hands|pg||
pc|h6|nt|afulton: but I'll bet he was considering what happens if they dont!|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|peachy: North's duck was good, East's not so good|pg||

mb|2S|an|Spades + minor|nt|daman: they may not have the tools to pick a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|dougdscsu: plays it safe and passes|pg||
nt|daman: decided not to compete I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|dougdscsu: didnt want to gamble on which minor Jacobs has i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: yes  did not want to try to pick which minor he doesnt have|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jlrice: plus has the defense to possibly beat them|pg||

nt|vugraphzjp: we have comparisons now|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: Yes that will be exciting :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: really only an IMP at stake since the @C are sitting well to pitch the @D losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Woolsey was glad that Stewart had a fairly rotten hand to prevent the Queen of Spades finesse|pg||
nt|mildredb: nice smooth play by justin|pg||
nt|mildredb: tough guess for Wold|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but if South holds @HKJ then must also hold @SA -- where @HQ works whenever North holds @HK|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|bigtrain: that was an example of interferring in big club auctions ending in a bad way...  n/s forced e/w to a game that probably wouldn't have been bid|pg||
nt|peachy: another competitive decision board here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|peachy: whichever side "gets" to play game, will go down|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|afulton: true... probably one scenario that went thru his head, "Win @d in dummy and lead @cK for pitch?"|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: 4D seems normal|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 4@S, you mean|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: no splinter in support by passed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: ah, yes...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: good morning to me|pg||
nt|bigtrain: wouldn't surprise me if the other table makes 5|pg||
nt|jlrice: EW have a good 3NT here    but might end up in 4H which would be down|pg||
nt|peachy: not necessarily true, but likely|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzjp: keith heard you|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the @S overcall will almost certainly influence them to choose @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S = NAT [no way to show 2-suiter except @H & @S]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: south and west feverishly writing to each other|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: director call, time for a brb|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pause means either:  a) hemant thinking about DBL  b) Jacobus wondering if they play regular or transfer lebensohl  c) system freeze|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: both have bid but didn't push bids back, i didn't type them in yet|pg||
nt|peachy: their conv card says Xfer leb|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: back |pg||
mb|d|nt|niclecuyer: good old Keith|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: lots of pressure from EW|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: good bid 4NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: yes...|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: Taylor should really say stop bidding now and whip this|pg||
nt|jlrice: seems like an aggressive 2C bid    with no heart fit and 3 card diamond suit I would rather pass with W|pg||
nt|jlrice: but if a pass denies 5C I would hate to see partner balance in with 2D|pg||
nt|peachy: North has a difficult decision to make, W has announced hearts and clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: pass seems a standout...  rebidding 2@C with 5-3 in the minors is forced over a 1@S resonse but here - pass solves all the problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: it is always fun when you have all these red doubles in front on you, X of 4NT then X of 5Cl...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: since e/w is playing a limited opener west can just bid game when he has no slam ambitions|pg||
nt|afulton: without @h lead, isn't hard.. but @c's give him 1 pitch and he had 2 discards to make in @d |pg||
nt|ahollan1: e) Jacobus WANTS 2N=@C & @D but telepathy doesn't work through screen|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzjp: you get into a rhythm|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: best feeling except on the odd time when they rapp it... which will not be here...|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: he may be wondering if the penalty is enough to compensate +650 but he does not know it will be -100 if he bids|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2 pitches|pg||

nt|peachy: on the syrface this actually looks makeable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on other vugraph tables using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
pc|h6|nt|niclecuyer: ooops|pg||
nt|bigtrain: KQ for one and 10/9 for the other|pg||
nt|bigtrain: plenty of entries also|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzjp: careful defense should nip this|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

nt|vugraphzjp: Taylor has a lot of trust in Balcombe's Dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: Some discussion between screenmates Nick and Ross|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 9c is either top of the suit, or top of an interior sequence|pg||
nt|peachy: unless QH is allowed to score|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c5|nt|bigtrain: there are risks which is why kit choose the line he did|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but boards are unique to each match|pg||

pc|c6|nt|vugraphzjp: balcombe and klimo are fighting over who clears the tray off the table|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|bigtrain: but in a pair game i would guess the field would make 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room  Jacobs' 2@S was @S + @C/@D so Kranyak passed with Jacobus hand|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mildredb: @HT may be suit pref|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jlrice: the play should go relatively quickly now for -1 as the show up squeeze does not work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or showing highest @H in case wold next tries lower @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting - did Kit discuss that in Partnership Defense?|pg||

pc|h2|pg||

nt|bigtrain: it's not likely he'd find it though|pg||
nt|bigtrain: squeeze still operates as a crisscroos |pg||
nt|bigtrain: hmmm  i thought i saw a duck of the @DK|pg||
nt|jlrice: robinson saved in 5C on the last hand so they have gone ahead again|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bigtrain: @D8 is critical|pg||
nt|mildredb: i don't think that was best|pg||
pc|c3|nt|peachy: i dont know, but I would have ruffed low last time, right or wrong|pg||
nt|mildredb: it may be a wash, but I would have, too :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores through 3rd segment of 6 available at  http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2010/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||

pc|c8|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|vugraphzjp: Taylor should encourage in spades here|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|vugraphzjp: error by taylor to play the k@S|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|niclecuyer: this will be a big swing for Gartaganis - tightening things up|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|vugraphzjp: looks like 3 more tricks for the defense|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: the K@S play was irrelevant...just traded tricks as this way forced the endplay on East|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: nice pickup for gartaganis|pg||

nt|ahollan1: MB - can you put that in Golf terms?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Transfer Lebensohl  also known as Rubensohl -- first documented by frequent Australian commentator Bruce Neill|pg||

nt|daman: his @C King should have deterred him from doing that|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|jlrice: 6D wont be down as much   but likely to get Xed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlrice: whereas they would have gone quietly in 5H|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: 800|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: jacobs' X is of the lightner variety, asking for an unusual lead|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: i don't think beatty will have any problems leading a @s|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: probably the @s 2 asking for a club back|pg||
nt|jlrice: but deutsch hasnt passed yet    but I cant see him bidding anything|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: seymon asking questions about the double of six diamonds, beatty indeed indicating it is for the lead|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: is he thinking of 6nt?|pg||
nt|jlrice: well   they can take 10 tricks in NT so I guess is a better spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: while Steve seemed sure the double was calling for a a lead, he seems unsure as to what :) |pg||

nt|ahollan1: a bit moot with other room 800|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzjp: 2c is for the majors|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: EW did what they had to do and gave a problem to NS which is what you are supposed to do, nicely done|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bigtrain: starting off with multi|pg||
nt|jlrice: this is an interesting one   can make 7 clubs but will be tough to get there now|pg||
nt|peachy: what is ur choice with N, interesting|pg||
mb|d|nt|bigtrain: 2NT asks for information - suit and strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: these people are courageous, unfav weak NT, I amd too old for this kind of action|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes  a double fit in the majors but NS has a diamond save|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they have an excellent chance to make a game with less than the normally required values|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: the bad trump split may doom 10 tricks though|pg||
nt|jlrice: but NS can get a ruff to set the contract|pg||
nt|afulton: it won't be easy game with @s 4-1 and tap on go|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jlrice: 3C is natural?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: can mean many things - that is there's no standard menaning|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i used to play it showed a 5-card M|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it appears to be natural\|pg||
nt|mildredb: i'd have bid @D :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|afulton: interesting development!|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would have guessed either 5 card suit  or minimum with hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that i find as very surprising|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: they had a screwup near the beginning of this set and it feels like they are swinging a bit|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: my "prayer" was answered, lots of decisions to make in this one|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|jlrice: this will be either down 1 or 2 depending on whether they find the club ruff|pg||
nt|jlrice: but should find it given that they will have a second chance as NS need to ruff heart|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mildredb: Hi, Raija - you are right - lots of tough decisions hands|pg||
pc|d4|nt|peachy: Welcome to Mildred Breed, a world class expert from the USA|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|niclecuyer: on board 2?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzjp: yes...klimo blocked the heart suit|pg||
nt|mildredb: looks like -1 - much needed 11 imps for Deutsch squad|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bigtrain: kit can handle the 5-0 split rather easily|pg||
nt|peachy: The Deutsch team has three young players, former and current Juniors|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes    he is very glad they didnt get to 7|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 7@H anyway  :)|pg||

nt|jlrice: yes 7H|pg||
nt|mildredb: oops|pg||
nt|mildredb: I spoke too soon|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|vugraphzjp: ross is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: stroking his head|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: you always want not to have to rely on 3-3 breaks...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: playing with the played tricks pile|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: he is going to come to 10 of those later...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: the abbot would find that he has 2 entries to dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: overtake the kd for one, and then finesse the 10 for a second entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: but only david bird would find that line|pg||
nt|peachy: this will REALLY help them|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|c5|nt|mildredb: yes, 17 imps|pg||

pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: Open Room   Kranyak also started with DBL -- now in 12@D  [Beatty bid immediate 5@C]|pg||
pc|d7|nt|niclecuyer: maybe the Rueful rabbit as well in a Hog imitation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: the rabbit would do it as penalty cards|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: ross just asked if he was in his hand|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: a kibitzer is pointing out that tricks are shrinking and now he will not be able to afford the club finesse in safety - although the point count would allow it...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mildredb: 16 imps - can't add :)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|mildredb: kibs are saying that trump lead would have been their choice & a good one it would have been|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: sorry all, lost connection|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: he played east for 4D, unlucky but that means playing east for KJ10 of clubs...|pg||

nt|jlrice: another slam hand for EW|pg||
nt|peachy: close enough for goverment work :)|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: 2@C = @H and @C or @D's|pg||
nt|jlrice: but NS has a good save in 7D|pg||
mb|3S|nt|niclecuyer: Ross must feel terrible right now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: keith just complained to klimo to stop flashing his bottom card to him|pg||
nt|bigtrain: preemption over a big club may make it tough to reach slam|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S doesn't seem adequate to me|pg||
nt|jlrice: will be a tough 6D to reach    |pg||
nt|poohbear: I agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: 3C is either a game forcing xfer to diamonds, or a drop dead bid of 3d|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: yes...ross should have gotten up from the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: keith should have told him to go to the washroom|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would have bid 3S  |pg||
nt|bigtrain: i bet they are able to handle it now and reach slam|pg||
nt|mildredb: that slammed the door on a shut out|pg||
mb|4S|nt|niclecuyer: yes these are 2 annoying, sort of unlucky battlefield decisions, time for some cold water splashing and back|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: klimo did it after board 2|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@c is likely Natural GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 3@S seems a standout and i'm sure they are people that would consider 4 :)|pg||
nt|jlrice: EW might get to 7H on this one though which they will be dissappointed not to make|pg||
nt|mildredb: that cost 5 imps for Jacobs team, but I'm sure Bramley felt the whole 16|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: considering diamonds are both of thier second suit  they might not know that they have such a big fit|pg||
nt|jlrice: and stop in game|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: just needs reasonable breaks in majors  but cant make on 4-0 hearts |pg||
nt|bigtrain: wonder if this is intended as exclusion RKC?|pg||
nt|jlrice: 5D looks like it has to be exclusion    |pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzjp: campbell almost just led out of turn|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: this one should be a quick 3 imps to Gartaganis|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: ross is going for a smoke while keith plays this|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that's why 3@S would have been so effective...  the @D would surely have been buried|pg||
nt|poohbear: Woolsey might just bid 4@h here to protect the @s king|pg||
nt|jlrice: yeah   Kx of spades does not look good cards to try for slam with|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzjp: this should be fast|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: leading out of turn is usually not a good idea unless you are about to lead against something cold anyway :)|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|afulton: he bid @d... is 5 extra length?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|niclecuyer: good idea - although cold water is better for health|pg||

nt|poohbear: trusting partner|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: simply normal to start a forcing 3@h?|pg||
nt|daman: either that or just bid 4@H|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: when you have a 5 card suit headed by KQJ - bid it at whatever the cost - they did not at the other table on the last board and finished with -400|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: campbell replied he is never off shape|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzjp: i will pass your suggestion onto daniel|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: it will be more difficult to make 1 than 2 here... in 2 you have to make it, in 1 you may do something not good|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: he won't mind if they win, if they don't the maybe my suggestion for the best French restaurant in Montreal would be better...|pg||
nt|jlrice: can make 6S but only if they hook J off spades and drop the Q of diamonds|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gavin:  if their relay's tell them that they have matching singletons in @C they are very unlikely to get too high|pg||
nt|jlrice: I do not know their system at all  |pg||
nt|gavin:  noone has a particularly strong hand, my guess is they settle in 4@H|pg||

nt|ahollan1: same hand - move @Dx to @Hx and 4@C is automatic|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: what is taking so long?|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 2D must be some sort of spade raise...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 2d is alerted...waiting for explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 2d is probably a suit, but may be lead directing|pg||
nt|poohbear: upgrading to 18-19 by East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=you made me bid|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lml: this should go down but it is harder to defend than play some times|pg||
mb|1N|nt|buffytvs: yes -- it looks as though EW really lost their way on defence at the oterh table|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 2D says I have the beer card (diamond 7) ... just kidding|pg||
nt|bigtrain: definitely too good for a 15-17 NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzfg: long consideration for 4 clubs on last hand, said trumps to poor|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|buffytvs: they started diamonds, then eventually managed to set up two spade tricks for declarer|pg||

nt|vugraphzjp: oooh..2d showed hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: klimo reminded campbell and he said 'i have hearts'|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: another 2 imps probably for Gartaganis|pg||
nt|poohbear: wonder what 2@d shows?|pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps 5@s 4@h inv|pg||
nt|poohbear: after 2@s bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: if so East should pass|pg||
nt|poohbear: no sense running from 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: and here!|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a better contract than 4S|pg||
nt|mildredb: this should be another dbl digit hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 0-4(5)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzjp: looks like it|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 2D showed hearts??|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I play that but not to show KJ10...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: spade switch may work...get rid of dummies trumps...|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|poohbear: Stewart sees things differently|pg||
nt|jlrice: with the favorable spade layout  2NT can be made though|pg||
nt|poohbear: true|pg||
nt|poohbear: but 10 of @ds is the reason 2NT makes. Otherwise 2@s would be better|pg||
nt|jlrice: 2S is better regardless   |pg||
nt|poohbear: I would lead a @c from South|pg||
nt|poohbear: After a @c lead North will have a good idea of the count since partner didnt lead a 5 card @d suit|pg||
nt|mildredb: yes, much :)|pg||
nt|peachy: don't even have to touch clubs to make|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lml: 1NT can be hard to defend|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the @S2 gives West the impression that declarer has Kx -- hence th cash of the ace|pg||
nt|lml: I like the idea of switching to a spade but the 2 isnt the right card|pg||
nt|lml: if she leads the @SQ for instance and then shift back to a heart that works pretty well|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so declarer has 7 tricks for sure now just by knocking out the @CA|pg||
nt|lml: even the @S6 might work|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont like that lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzjp: not now|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|afulton: like I said, toasting the Robinson team...|pg||
nt|poohbear: thats a ridiculous statement given the fact that they are leading and Robinson hasnt exactly shined|pg||
nt|afulton: that is true... but one can always wish the opponents a good game|pg||
nt|afulton: personally, i would like to see a team made up mostly of women make it to USA1|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think Ross is trying to induce a diamond switch from the defence|pg||
nt|buffytvs: there aren't many suits left after all|pg||
nt|lml: nick knows judy has the @H6|pg||
nt|lml: Taylor doesnt have 6 hearts|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: and so Judy has at least one more|pg||
nt|lml: @H9|pg||
nt|lml: sorry|pg||
nt|buffytvs: upside down dyslexia -- the rarest form :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: Please turn your screen right side up, Linda|pg||
nt|lml: well he got his diamond shift but can he afford to win the @D9 anyway|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|lml: I guess he can win the 9 and play heart heart|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he can just win thw king and play a club -- easy route to 7 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: whe can always overtake the diamond|pg||
nt|lml: its playing for the overtricks that is slowing this down|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- maybe they're all starting to think that every IMP wil be vital in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: and every imp is vital|pg||
nt|lml: sounds like Monty Python|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: wrong forum for that|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- and every IMP is good (thx specs)|pg||
nt|lml: honestly this isnt tha big a decision since he can always overtake later|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: it will easily make now...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzjp: this doesnt appear to be the same balcombe taylor pair we have been watching the last 2 days...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jlrice: will make an overtrick now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|peachy: now I'm surprised, he had 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: still does|pg||
nt|mildredb: just looking for overtrick - no danger|pg||
nt|peachy: no danger, due to C10 protecting the clubs|pg||

nt|buffytvs: everyone getting tired|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Gartaganis is 4-handed, and Korbel virtually so|pg||

nt|buffytvs: it's ok, I read typo|pg||
nt|jlrice: he might try 3NT over 3D though|pg||
nt|mildredb: brb|pg||
mb|1D|nt|gavin:  you dont want to bid 3@S in that spot if you think 1 side is definitely going down, only risk in passing out 3@C is if both sides make|pg||
nt|peachy: notvul|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Open Room still on Board 56|pg||
nt|ahollan1: catchall 1@D  [2@C opening promises 6+]|pg||
mb|2D|nt|starkist: and 1n tends to be two stoppers|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: somebody is pointing out that the score on board 4 is wrong, can this be ceckid out?|pg||
nt|poohbear: this is a 3.5 @h bid by mancuso|pg||
nt|poohbear: bids tend to be lighter in competition|pg||
nt|poohbear: She chooses the low road|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: my comments are appearing in slow motion so I will be saying everything after everybody else|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Declarer might assume that @hs not breaking and @ds are from failure to lead a singleton @d|pg||
nt|poohbear: clearly @ss arent 6-1|pg||
nt|jlrice: will be very happpy to see the heart situation  as 4H has no problems  but can not make 5|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: in which room is the score wrong?|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: this may lead to another win for Gartaganis|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: they played 3h+1 in this room...klimo jumped to 3h in the auction|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: and made 4?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: yes...made 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: needs to manage her entries carefully to make 4|pg||
nt|peachy: favorable diamonds, should make even on QS lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: ok |pg||
pc|c9|nt|poohbear: one round of trumps and start @ds|pg||
nt|mildredb: study long, but still 5 losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm studying trying to find the 4@S bid|pg||
nt|peachy: well friends, specs, colleagues, it has been fun and an honor to work with you, but I must go.  See you all later. Thanks so much.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gavin:  north needs to give an encouraging signal so partner knows to set up his spades before he enters with the king of diamonds|pg||
nt|gavin:  (the 7 i assume said i like it)|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: braaavo Ross...|pg||
nt|gavin:  north can see his K@D will be an entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: they play upside attitude, standard count...so the 7 was discouraging...|pg||
nt|mildredb: may just lead a low @D |pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzjp: slip up on def there|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lml: Judy might have thrown the @D10|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: can afford it if he wants to|pg||
pc|dK|nt|niclecuyer: oh well|pg||
nt|poohbear: now down|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: that would have made it a lot easier|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: diamonds are blocked now|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jlrice: yes    should have gone to K of hearts if was taking a second hearrt|pg||
pc|cA|nt|niclecuyer: obviously the spad was not clear enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: they dont have listed on the card what type of signal they give to an Ace in NT...perhaps that was standard count...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|niclecuyer: needs to guess the club now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: there is 20 minutes left on the clock|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: and 3 boards after this one to play|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: and 3 boards to go |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 2@D instead of 2@S is worth discussion|pg||
nt|mildredb: thx, Raija - enjoyed :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jlrice: now will not be able to get back to good diamonds|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gavin:  when  declarer has a guess for a queen like this|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: Piotr will guess this I think|pg||
nt|gavin:  they typically will try to see if they can figure out who has more @C|pg||
nt|gavin:  because the person who has 4, is more likely to have the queen, 4-3|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I would go down because it is the club Q and I cannot guess that Q|pg||
nt|gavin:  rather than just flipping a coin which is 50-50|pg||
nt|gavin:  so east is going to try to place shapes|pg||
nt|mildredb: well played by Bramley|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gavin:  as declarer it looks like south has 4@S,4@H (south played 3@H, 2@H, doesnt seem like J32)|pg||
nt|gavin:  and north discouraged spades|pg||
pc|sA|nt|buffytvs: much to declarer's relief|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: Nick has put his cards down, and is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: he is wondering how he can get to Judys hand|pg||
nt|lml: with a telegram|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: i will send someone over to whisper in his ear to cash the A@S and concede|pg||
nt|buffytvs: next!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: speed things along that way|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: Thank you Joey|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: He is playing right behind me|pg||
nt|lml: there is nothing anybody can do but let Nick waste the brain cells|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: seems normal to guess the clubs|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|gavin:  so when he sees diamonds 2-2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|gavin:  he will think south has only 3 clubs and north is the one with 4|pg||
nt|gavin:  and get it right|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: let's see|pg||
nt|gavin:  why normal ?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzjp: c'mon Ross, just claim already|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: let's see that lean|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: the odds are with you to play north for it|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|lml: its that pesky @D9|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: and there it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: all that for a push too|pg||
nt|mildredb: if my pard bid 2@D & then 3@S, I'd accept|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|gavin:  not based on their length|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|dQ|nt|gavin:  4-3 against the odds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: based on the lead perhaps|pg||
pc|c8|pg||

nt|daman: then you recoomend a pass|pg||
nt|daman: mm|pg||
nt|jlrice: I would|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Two more boards remaining in this segment, followed by a 1 hour and 15 minute break prior to the 5th of 6 segments :)|pg||
nt|daman: then you and I are on the same page|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|jlrice: but i would X if you told me to bid something  (and I wouldnt mind partner Xing with that)|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: Piotr and I were on the same wavelength :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: yes|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lml: but what about east-west|pg||
nt|peachy: Deutsch team needs an opportunity for swing, but this hand isnt it,|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think we both vote for DBL-2@S//PASS  but worth talking about how forcing the cue is|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mildredb: we can't complain about no excitement this round |pg||
nt|mildredb: i would bid 2@S, true|pg||
nt|mildredb: not 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this time South opens catchall 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: their hame does|pg||
nt|lml: game|pg||
nt|buffytvs: indeed it does|pg||
nt|mildredb: on a good day 4@S would make e/w, but that is not today|pg||
mb|2C|nt|peachy: South should just Texas, too remote to hope for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: that was efficient|pg||
nt|gavin:  never bad to be on the same wavelength as the guy watching on vugraph :)|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: always best :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: i must've misread compton's earlier explanation of 2c, or they are playing different systems lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: and just as I was going to say it's not likely to be bid :)|pg||
nt|lml: wolpert bid only 3@S |pg||
nt|lml: and they sold to 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: Nick is not a shy bidder|pg||
nt|lml: I think forcing club helps here too|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: actually, neither is Judy|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the opponents are quite likely to have a game of their own|pg||

nt|peachy: np Bob|pg||
nt|peachy: we got our wish...|pg||
nt|peachy: again|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: a good source out there says 2c is color prob crash, thanks greg|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|poohbear: now will get too high|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jlrice: they were destined to get too high from the start   i would think everyone would invite with souths hand|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: he says they are playing SCuM, double shows shape, clubs shows color|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|gavin:  seems like declarer did well to get out for down 1 on this spade layout|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: from what i have seen that is a 4 times daily ritual at balcombe table|pg||
nt|starkist: 5 wife calling him for coffee|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|peachy: brb|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jlrice: but opponents can make 4C  so a good sac over 3C  :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: this is exclusion BW|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: how to respond to exclusion with an additional side void :)|pg||

mb|5S|an|1/4|nt|daman: maybe a leap to 6@H    seems very perilous to do that|pg||
