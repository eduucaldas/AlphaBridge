mb|p|nt|sybarra: even vul I mght open 2 @S with S  (or multi if they play that)|pg||
nt|haans: long way to hearts now|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 split     south has fine shape   but with A@C wrong   not likely to make 4@H   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: From 1987 to 1994 worked on WBF as member and chairman|pg||

nt|h_karluk: Jean Besse, of Switzerland, is one of the fixed lights of European bridge. He has played in more European Championships than any other player. |pg||
nt|h_karluk: A Swiss team without him would be like Hamlet without the Prince. Switzerland has often been in a challenging position in the European Championship but has never quite won the ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: title.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: 3@H may well make for n/s so 3@S down 1 a decent result for e/w|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: spec mentioned 2 aces  missing    sorry an oversight|pg||

pc|s2|nt|sybarra: maybe 2 level is enough but the void makes me feel the hand is better|pg||

mb|3H|nt|sybarra: cu all again  @H@H1h|pg||
nt|dima:  Well - some Voidwoods are around but not clear whether TT play them|pg||
nt|haans: most bid 3@H showing singel|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dima:  Not for this pair I am sure|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i don't think that's an optional X|pg||
nt|h_karluk: clear penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: bye Shirley|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: bye|pg||
nt|sybarra: not many entries to dummy here |pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  cards fitting perfect here|pg||
nt|sybarra: suprised, W just didnt bid 3 @S |pg||
nt|haans: in france they bid natural after 3@H as if they have game|pg||
nt|haans: idiotic |pg||
nt|h_karluk: and wrong thinking with that collection|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dima:  Now for most it would be @d fit + @h shortness|pg||
nt|sybarra: is there a reason for that? |pg||
nt|sybarra: isnt 3 @H a transfer?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dima:  I told you about practical natural bidding|pg||
nt|dima:  Next board :)|pg||
nt|haans: so i learned from kib at other match|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just 2 sure winners, but the aim should be unless obvious off 2 not worths to move|pg||
nt|haans: now @S8|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: there is no other chance than to use the entries to pick up the @s suit, so discard a @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry @c suit....|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: think, think|pg||
nt|haans: must give opps a @D first to have entry in @D9|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Discard a @s and play @cQ and @dK is an entry for the next @c finess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: declarer knows the 3-0 split in @d, so ...|pg||
nt|haans: yes you have your first entry hear and now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|reisig: Very conservative bidding|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: yes trasfer but 3@S say ok lets play spades|pg||
nt|haans: forcing like|pg||
nt|sybarra: well had W been able to see E hand,  might have prefered spades|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|haans: we now use transfer before we bid Flint but france bids neither|pg||
nt|haans: France are only nation be world champions twice|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

mb|1D|nt|hedyg: just need to bid it|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bobh1: only with @cs 3-1 and the @s A strategically located is this in danger...or a foul trump break|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@c?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|bobh1: 6@c is vulnerable only to a @s ruff so is better i agree|pg||

nt|haans: quit right|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ady: 5@D   ambitious in OR   would have tht 4@S a better bet|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems last board of this segment|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: 3@C best bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: 6@d is not a bad spot ...but fails|pg||
nt|dima:  But I think following suit preference @s 3 from Partner North could just play @d A and a @D|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|andreasw:  will they reach it?|pg||
nt|dima:  I think they will get to 4@s|pg||
nt|haans: may miss game now|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S???|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks to organizators, bbo, fellows and kibbers|pg||
mb|2D|nt|haans: why 3@C you may ask|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like 3 @C  |pg||
nt|haans: 3@D is not clear sign off|pg||
nt|sybarra: may take the majors out of play also early|pg||
nt|haans: best lead @CJ|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzmr: we'll see for the few moments|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@h now?|pg||
nt|dima:  They play reasonable weak jump overcalls, so 1@s + 2@s shows reasonable nonminimum hand|pg||
nt|haans: thats better|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: good slam in spades or clubs|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andreasw:  yep|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|reisig: Some use 3@h here ..asking a stopper|pg||
nt|haans: ok |pg||
nt|haans: he he|pg||
nt|h_karluk: another crazy double in case input correct!|pg||
mb|4N|nt|haans: best with opps bidding is that if you bid you do show a 6 carder|pg||
nt|dima:  Depends aa bit on partnership agreements :) Frensh style tends to promise values when you bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: not really easy|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ady: defence does best not to take A@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmr: stop in 5 well done :)|pg||
nt|reisig: this time ..it's right :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: yes but still 6@D is good contract|pg||
nt|dima:  Some handling here for North, but cards are friendly|pg||
mb|6S|nt|vugraphzmr: 3rd Q unlucky is behind|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dima:  Then he's crossruffing|pg||
