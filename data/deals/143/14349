nt|Walddk2: Better than most of mine, I agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|babs59: they may well head to slam here too|pg||
nt|babs59: this time there is the 4-1 heart break|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I don't think Sunit will be tempted with his flat shape|pg||
nt|babs59: flat shape but prime controls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has no convenient way to invite slam now|pg||
nt|babs59: a fifth heart would sway him, I'm sure|pg||
nt|alok_daga: makes dble dummy after the noise by Sridhar|pg||
nt|vugraphzhr: he is contemplating , it looks|pg||
nt|babs59: yes, the double would alert him to the H play for sure|pg||
nt|alok_daga: 4hrts(the 9drops)5dmnds AK,A|pg||
mb|4N|nt|babs59: but he also needs to find DQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: For all Sunit knows, they could be without a spade control|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Blackwood is not the tool when you are off a control in a side suit|pg||
mb|6D|nt|babs59: perhaps he's taking the view that they are the underdogs - so a wild bash can't hurt|pg||
mb|p|nt|alok_daga: 6DMNDS BETTER|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: you still have to find the DQ Alok|pg||
nt|babs59: this is more in line with a "Roland" slam?|pg||
nt|alok_daga: tRUE|pg||
pc|sK|nt|alok_daga: Sunit on test|pg||
pc|sA|nt|babs59: this is the sort of hand Sunit would enjoy - in terms of potential gain at least|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: He may indeed get hearts right after North's double, but there is a risk that he gets diamonds wrong for the same reason|pg||

nt|alok_daga: 1st exam passed,now 2 find the DQ|pg||
nt|babs59: seems he's just playing to guess the Diamonds|pg||
nt|babs59: no spade ruff - so if he gets D wrong he'll go down more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But there is an entry issue|pg||
nt|babs59: perhaps he'll play a spade now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Say he cashes all trumps. Then he will be in the wrong hand and will get diamonds right perforce|pg||
nt|babs59: correct|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as he can no longer pick up Qxx with South|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|babs59: that must be my first ever correct prediction on BBO|pg||
nt|alok_daga: GUT FEELING SAYS,+1430|pg||
nt|babs59: if Sunderram now leads clubs, I think Sunit will be forced to get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|babs59: he has to decide whether to run the DJ immediately...  if not he'll be forced to pick the diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he will get diamonds right because 5431 is the most likely shape for the TO double. Then @DQ more often will be among the three|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|andyv:  it helps in partnerships to have a firm guideline as to how good or bad your michaels bid can be|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: the Michaels weak or strong (but not inbetween) seems popular|pg||
