nt|sybarra: not everyone would open 1 nt with S hand (with stiff K of @D) |pg||
nt|sybarra: but it worked |pg||
nt|drkvas: they r the strongest pair of their team  iguess will try things to over come the deficit|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Just my thoughts, Subhash. I think the hand is worth it because it also contains a fit for diamonds|pg||
nt|offthebend: mind you a very lucky layout of cards that 4H does make |pg||
nt|andyv:  W could have tried the Q@h if he knew how desperate his side's situation was|pg||

nt|yo_yo: yes good for them!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: like these claims as operator:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: easy to get carried away by that lovely south hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do they play strong NT?|pg||
nt|andyv:  precision|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if so  here it comes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's the range?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: e/w nt 14-15...n/s 15-17|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand looks NTish no matter what the range is|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y es ok 6 imps and west bengal B is now in lead|pg||
nt|wygbe1: south would have to suppress his major, which is reasonable given the secondary cards and spots in the other suits|pg||
nt|drkvas: a quite start last set started with a grand slam:)|pg||
nt|granguru: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to John Plaut|pg||

nt|Walddk4: and to our operator, Mahesh|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Welcome John and Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: ty mahesh|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: 6 @D might be more likely |pg||
nt|yo_yo: now  what do NS play as defence?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hello, Shirley, hi to all|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps easier also |pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Sveta, welcome |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wouldnt pass|pg||
mb|1H|nt|suketbombi: true but a 4-4-3-2 is always a good reason not to supress|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you leap to 4 or bid 3?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  2@s look normal|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6 card major, too much chance of a game for NS|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: if 2/1 ish, E has not reason to go leaping around yet |pg||
nt|sybarra: but this bidding may stop them in 4 @S |pg||
nt|granguru: will NS be able to win 3NT|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|andyv:  vul probably stopped S|pg||
mb|2D|nt|granguru: ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: unlikely to go beyong 3nt|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzhs: thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: sad opportunity missed here |pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: 6d is a terrible contract but can be made if you can see through the cards|pg||
nt|suketbombi: show up squeeze after the minors are through|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sudhir Aggarwal|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4 @S shut the auction off |pg||

pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  spot cards aren't exactly encouraging to bidding with S hand|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|sga1: may be 10|pg||
nt|granguru: @H being 3-3 and well placed probably defense could never have beated this contract|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|granguru: best for west is @HQ|pg||
nt|granguru: then after N ducks SMALL @h|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzhs: decl thinking|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|granguru: to avoid overtricks|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

nt|andyv:  another 3N?|pg||

nt|vugraphzhs: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe was afraid 3 @D was not forcing,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: and worried about  whether 3 @C was forcing |pg||
nt|sybarra: (my guesses) |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think you would go minus 1100 on that south hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: multi?|pg||

nt|yo_yo: that's good then :)|pg||

nt|drkvas: this is a tricky hand|pg||
nt|sga1: well defended|pg||
nt|granguru: EW time to try 3NT|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@H is a makeable contract as well|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|sfoxa:  hm, it looks like close to major game for NS, but @s or @h prevails?|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets play spades  looks easier |pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you, we only have YOUR word for that :)|pg||
nt|panja: 6@D for NS..not easy to get there though|pg||
nt|granguru: and even 5@H I believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: gosh, no weak 2, no multi from south|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes very for both sides|pg||
nt|sga1: We all would like to thank our Sponsors TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) for sponsoring this wonderful event.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: n/s play precision |pg||

nt|vugraphzhs: not in this room:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in the other room then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: cant see other room|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@S 4th suit FG|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 3@d: no @H support|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: but alas 3 tricks for e/w more likely |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i might double with the West hand  andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  quality of @h suit makes me prefer dbl|pg||
nt|granguru: no 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  easier now|pg||
nt|drkvas: now 200|pg||
nt|drkvas: cash board|pg||
mb|3N|nt|panja: this is the moment of truth...|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 4@D is likely to prevail due to friendly @SS inspite of bad @D break|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: yes it's not great, 10 high|pg||
nt|granguru: wonder what 3@S would have now meant|pg||
nt|granguru: it is better to have 3N being bid by the @SQ hand rather than the @SA one|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: could make all the tricks now |pg||
nt|sybarra: easier from here of course |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  altough not a piece of cake|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|sga1: I think NRK manouvered also for this.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: what do we do here, bash out trumps and rely on the @D finesse?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  finesse @h and drop a @c on @s return|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: well bid|pg||
pc|s3|nt|granguru: the lead is by no means so bad as it may look|pg||
nt|sga1: it is a good lead, NRK will duck.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy for us at this "altitude"  playing for @S's  2/2|pg||
nt|sybarra: and agree,  not sure he has an option |pg||
nt|granguru: As a matter of fact it is better to let the trick be won by the defense|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|sybarra: on the right track so far |pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: that told S play the spade |pg||
pc|sA|pg||

mb|d|mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: From Sunderram's point of view it's not even certain that 5@C will make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Far from it|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@c now|pg||
nt|offthebend: hands like these normally push opponents in to bidding marginal games which can some times be missed |pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone but me think pass with N hand is a bit too conservative?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|andyv:  now 5@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would volunteer 4@C with the North cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Takes the pressure off partner|pg||
nt|andyv:  pd made neg. dbl... his cards have to help N's hand|pg||
nt|offthebend: N is not certain of any 8/9 card fit ( except 6-2 in clubs or 5-3 in D ) if south has 3-cards in Hearts|pg||
nt|othered1: even if they have @S ruff, they have to find it on opening lead . . .|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|drkvas: 11 bds 36 imps guj really needs some huge swings  last 1 was possible 800 if dbl n@s lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  thsi dos not look good for N-S|pg||
nt|andyv:  the price is not right for N on this one|pg||
nt|yo_yo: why did Gupta have to bid at all|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes could make by just playing to set up spades and planning on losing 2d and 1c - by managing entries better 42 spades good enuf|pg||
nt|granguru: big swing for NRK|pg||
nt|sga1: Good 3NT by N.|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2S|nt|sybarra: another  non traditional 1 nt |pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: how do we show the North hand  open 1 and rebid 4?|pg||
nt|panja: EW can make 3@D or 1N here..and NS will make 2@H...|pg||
nt|granguru: almost impossible for NS to bid this good game in @H|pg||
nt|sga1: I agree.|pg||
nt|granguru: lets seee|pg||
nt|sga1: EW will play in 3@s here (likely).|pg||
mb|r|nt|sfoxa:  but this margin is tiny indeed - next one board and...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andreasw:  yes should be 11-13 and 7 @S|pg||
nt|granguru: S showed @H |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: we are on the same wave length :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: cool in Manchester   14C|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: 35 imps for Tamilnadu in 4 Boards|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sfoxa:  as it happens often|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice close match for us |pg||
nt|sga1: Redouble generally is played as Rosenkranz showing one top honour in @s.|pg||

nt|sga1: Vow :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  i knew it!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: not south though|pg||
nt|panja: perhaps only 7 tricks in @H on good defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think if S  is going to open 1 nt,  then should bid 3 @D over 2 @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: will be glad no higher than 2 |pg||
nt|granguru: even with 2 unsefull queens|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: n-s will do to get a @C parial here|pg||
nt|wygbe1: optimistic bid by w, very beatable|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oops 4@S is interesting here|pg||
nt|sga1: Same bidding in other room as well. Why not, we are watching some of the best players.|pg||
nt|granguru: they have only 17 useful points|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  hard to comment on the 6@s bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i sympathise with Gupta , he has an enormous hand|pg||
nt|sga1: Only difference 4@h was doubled by W.|pg||
nt|granguru: reasonably|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  yes. good decision to stop as low as possible. seems reasonable, if partner is limited to 15|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andreasw:  S look his partner in the eye's and saw @s AKQ and went to slam only problem was that N blink to many times|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: cant see each other ..screens|pg||
nt|andreasw:  well there is the problem|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he felt the vibes then  :) |pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but got them wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: was trying to recover last board..south|pg||
nt|sandip2006: on @s lead|pg||
nt|drkvas: 4@s good spot makes|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: so the 1st dbl by Sunit|pg||
nt|granguru: but the bidding suggests not to double|pg||
nt|sga1: Kiruba didn't believe his partner will produce a trick. So he decided to pass.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  rkc might have taken care of that problem|pg||
nt|drkvas: a making contract|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|suketbombi: with @D over ruff positio will end up lossing 3 @Ss and a@H|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|sybarra: and then S has the bad break to contend with |pg||
nt|andyv:  always a bad policy to chase bad results|pg||

pc|h4|nt|panja: shd now switch to @SJ...at trick two|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Gujarat are panicking|pg||

pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: bad luck|pg||

nt|yo_yo: true|pg||
nt|yo_yo: realise they are doing badly and trying to catch up|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: good result for Gujrat this board|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panja: what will S play after @H?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|panja: Ariz hasn't thought about that...|pg||
nt|sandip2006: venky should bid 3@d|pg||
nt|panja: E hand will be squeezed in the meantime..that will help South choose a benign shift|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|suketbombi: unreal|pg||

mb|3C!|nt|andreasw:  another strong @c?|pg||

nt|panja: @HQ will get ducked I guess..but W has @DK entry for @H's|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has Vahalia shown 5@D and 4@C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe just clubs so far |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: should be good result for n/s this board...5@c or 5@d|pg||

nt|granguru: no chance, ofcourse|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we will have to tell you soccer scores then |pg||

nt|sybarra: (the window behind vugraph ) |pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but this one doesn't look that strong|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes should be 5/4 either way|pg||
nt|drkvas: trump lead|pg||
nt|granguru: 3NT is a solid contract as the cards lie|pg||
nt|sga1: No way.|pg||
mb|3N!|an|denies 4 card major|nt|vugraphzhs: yes..with this slow play can see score atleast|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at least, this board is "nothing special"|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: but still |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 5/4 either way, thanks to specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Vahalia thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: being red may slow him down |pg||
nt|yo_yo: bid up Vahalia!|pg||
nt|sga1: 3NT right contract. 3NT shows no 4-card major if 3@c was Puppet Stayman.|pg||
nt|granguru: looks like puppet|pg||
nt|granguru: Baron I was excplained..but then N should have said 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  may be, try @h and fast claim?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: obviously, 3n was going down, but south didnt like position of club k for defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 6-4 bid one more |pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult to Ariz to bid after a slow double|pg||
nt|granguru: explained*|pg||
nt|sga1: Difficult to believe, no one plays Baron on 2Nt opening (IMO)|pg||
nt|granguru: as Baron asks to start bidding 4-cards suits up-the -line|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  normal contract|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the lead is with North (poor thing)|pg||
nt|andyv:  @h|pg||
nt|andreasw:  with gupta two bids they could have ende't up in 3@s|pg||
nt|drkvas: ho god|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: ai |pg||
nt|drkvas: :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  which will give W a chance to dump 2 @ds after pulling 2 rounds of trump|pg||
nt|yo_yo: never with that strong west hand surely|pg||
nt|suketbombi: was a good board for gujrat but -5 now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4NT  would have brought home the bacon for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes it's good not to know a convention|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow... nice lead|pg||
nt|sga1: Most of the players today bid NT with 5-card major, that is why Puppet Stayman is so popular.|pg||
nt|granguru: specially 2NT openings|pg||
nt|granguru: as it is in those hands where is it more important to have the strong hand deing declarer|pg||
nt|granguru: being*|pg||
nt|granguru: E knows west cant have more than 1 point|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Prabhakar thinking|pg||
nt|granguru: more than 3 in fact..as N might have 19 instead of 21|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: still waiting for east to play|pg||
nt|granguru: but if W has the S!J then no more than a Q outside..so there is no chance to find a fast entry in his hand|pg||

nt|panja: no easy at this Vul|pg||

nt|granguru: 10s will play roles here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  it helps in partnerships to have a firm guideline as to how good or bad your michaels bid can be|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c by EW will have some difficulty with the bad @d break, but 3N should work|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: the Michaels weak or strong (but not inbetween) seems popular|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is a 14 count that is more oriented to defence than to @ss|pg||
nt|panja: I guess they won't venture now...|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt it is N taking the sac if anyone does it will be S |pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Neither North nor South did enough here imo|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: we will see if this is good advertisement for precision or not |pg||
nt|yo_yo: always show the major ( a rule for me)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :) yes good rule but pas may be an underbid|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|granguru: is a much better bid than pass as if, as it is probable, he needs to ruff @H in dummy E cant overruff|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andreasw:  and N open'd 4@s not 1@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 29, in OR, S inquired about the Q@s thru rkc and stopped at 5@s when N didn't have it|pg||
pc|d7|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  practical approach, especially when partner is known as "passer"|pg||
nt|sybarra: could have made more with hopping ace and playing low spade to j, and back |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wouldnt like to open 4@S with A,K,A|pg||
nt|andyv:  bad luck, as Kath says, cost 13 imps (unless you are on Gujarat team)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  for me it is a clear 1@s bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't mind 1 or 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru: I sould say it is impossible to beat the hand if declarer takes out trumps|pg||
nt|granguru: would*|pg||
nt|granguru: on the other hand a black suit move is risky|pg||
nt|sga1: yes|pg||

pc|s2|nt|sybarra: can n/s untangle this now?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 10@S suspicious?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kista should have gone for the @S|pg||
nt|granguru: meaning that the one who moves them gives away a trick|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|drkvas: the bds are ticking by n guj losing further ground|pg||

nt|sga1: New leader like after this Board|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|andyv:  in 2/1, the hand is a 4@s bid as 1@s followed by 4@s is a much stronger (in hcps) hand|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sga1: likely|pg||
nt|granguru: wrong return|pg||
