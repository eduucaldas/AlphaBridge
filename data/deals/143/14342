nt|offthebend: sunit has many choices to bid his hand --- Splinter in Clubs , 4D as Fit showing or a simple 2S as  good raise or better for Hearts|pg||

nt|andyv:  not that W would get very excited|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: precision may make it easier for n/s to find their spot |pg||

nt|offthebend: not opening 1NT with E hand ? range must be different !!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|henryb:  Now that 2@d bid would not cross my mind. Double or Pass seem better|pg||

nt|vugraphzhs: :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: and worried about  whether 3 @C was forcing |pg||
nt|sybarra: (my guesses) |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think you would go minus 1100 on that south hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: multi?|pg||

nt|offthebend: as imporatnt as you want it to be :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Misfit and the Uttaranchal team seems to have overshot in the closed room|pg||
nt|babs59: it's a State-based event though|pg||
nt|babs59: I have no idea how many States there are in India - but our State-based nationals end with only 8 teams :)|pg||
nt|offthebend: Indian Summer Nationals in HOT HOT HOT Chennai - Known as Madras earlier |pg||
nt|henryb:  Apparently 2@d in the other room was the strong form of Multi?|pg||
nt|babs59: I gather the 'bridge season' is about to swing into full force in India, is that right?|pg||
mb|2D!|an|Multi|nt|sunsamvar: Dilli is hotter right now Subhashji|pg||
mb|2H!|an|TRF|nt|babs59: something to do during the hot monsoonal months??|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: yes - july onwards it does heat up -- the bridge season I mean  |pg||
mb|2S|nt|sunsamvar: there are around 30 states in India and about that many teams are taking part.|pg||
nt|po-s: Now seems the time for transfers - by opps|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|babs59: your Summer Nationals are state-based, and in a month's time we have our Winter Nationals which are state-based|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sunsamvar: Some large states like West Bengal, Maharashtra and the hosts Tamil Nadu have 2 teams and all others 1 each|pg||
nt|henryb:  Why would you bid 2N rather than double with the string balanced hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: I'd say Sunit is sighing with relief here|pg||
nt|po-s: great decision|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|babs59: 28 States I'm told, 30 teams - so 1 state didn't participate|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the match has become very close.. hold on to ur seats and ur mouse guys.|pg||
nt|henryb:  a club lead would probably have beaten this|pg||
nt|po-s: I don´t follow your math|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|babs59: Sunil said 3 states have 2 teams each|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|babs59: oh - more states didn't particpate - some government agencies also send teams|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|babs59: such as Indian Railways - usually a force, but here they didn't qualify|pg||
nt|offthebend:  Not all states send a team -- there are quotas for other government departments -- like revenue board  , Petroleum board etc |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and there are a couple of Institutional teams like the Railways|pg||
nt|po-s: ah, then I´m with you - and Subhash comes from one of the non-attenders?|pg||
nt|babs59: no - Subhash is just a non-participant :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|andreasw:  thsi dos not look good for N-S|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|sybarra: or does he need to? |pg||

nt|andyv:  the 3@d bid by S almost looks as if someone misbid... maybe S thought N's 2@s showed @s and @ds?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  or missunderstood 2@d?|pg||
nt|andyv:  or @s and another (not clubs) and 3@d was pass or correct|pg||

nt|babs59: this tournament has usually had a longer qualifying.  would you say the shortened qualifying has been a success, or did more 'fancied' teams (apart from just Railways) miss out?|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: extra lenght = trump Q i thought|pg||
nt|offthebend: I am surprised he made a move missing so many aces -- esp if they are Playing MAMYATS -- which means 4S is weaker |pg||

nt|yo_yo: wrong andy!|pg||

nt|yo_yo: actually I dont bid enough slams|pg||
nt|yo_yo: then am disappointed when all the 50% slams seem to make|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: michaels cue bid  showing @S and a minor|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  those playing weak/strong michaels might just bid 1@s with this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: difficult now, when East bids again Ariz might take him for a stronger hand|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  it helps in partnerships to have a firm guideline as to how good or bad your michaels bid can be|pg||
mb|4C|nt|yo_yo: the Michaels weak or strong (but not inbetween) seems popular|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is a 14 count that is more oriented to defence than to @ss|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|andreasw:  if they are lucky they will end up in 5@d 11 tricks but this dosen tlook good|pg||
nt|andyv:  E truly falling in love with his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: need to check east hands,,,might be dealt differnt cards :)|pg||
