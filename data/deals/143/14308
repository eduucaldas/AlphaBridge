nt|rednaxela: Evening, Anne.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: So far England have won all their matches, but England 2 (or the Sponsor's team) are close behind them.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: hello all and welcome to the 3rd session of the day, the 9th session in total|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|rednaxela: England 1 are in a clear lead, and so far unbeaten.|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rednaxela: John Holland has been undertaking fact finsing missions to Scotland.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|rednaxela: He recently lost a marathon Scottish Cup final that went to several sets of extra boards.|pg||
nt|idc: Eng 1 on 80 VPs,  Eng 2 on 73 if I can still add|pg||
nt|rednaxela: England 2, more accurately the Sponsor's Team, lie in 3rd place.|pg||
nt|xenya: weak 1N i guess -- not sure about 2@C|pg||
mb|2N|nt|idc: England 2 are the sponsors team, and a pretty good one too|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: The Patron's team actually won last year's event but are not elligible to hold the trophy.|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk10: Welcome to Oliver Clarke and Adam Magyar|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: Hi wellcome|pg||
nt|galadriel: The 2NT opening means they will play in @H rather than S but 4 of either major is fine|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good Morning, all and welcome to the Seniors Camrose.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|oliverc: hi Ivan|pg||
nt|idc: Morning Alex - or perhaps I should say Middle of the Night Alex|pg||
nt|xenya: if 2@C shows a 2-suiter, one of the suits must be @Cs -- if so, W had a clear 3@C bid i think -- but i'm nor sure |pg||

pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: We are a little short of commentators - all welcome|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|idc: Bernard Teltscher faces an unenviable choice of a major - so he has sensibly let partner speak|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good afternoon, and wlecome back to the Seniors Camrose in Glasgow|pg||
nt|rednaxela: For you perhaps!|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N is hopeless of course|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzmh: Current standings before last round GIB 183 Quantum 183 Shato rosenovo 178 Bacho 170|pg||
nt|Walddk10: wow tied 1st|pg||
pc|dK|nt|oliverc: so a nebulous 1@D from North, but the rest of the bidding fairly predictable|pg||
nt|sundiszno: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk10: Borth pairs play Precision|pg||
nt|Walddk10: Hi Adam|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Ys, most tournament pairs have a way of finding out about a 5 card Major in the 2NT opener, but when they have one of their own they tend to show that.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry, Ian, I interrupted you in full flow :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good afternoon, and welcome back to the Seniors Camrose for the match between Scotland and England 2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|idc: I can hear the specs shout with one voice: THANKS LIZ!|pg||
nt|idc: I forgot you have young(ish) children|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|galadriel: 2NT shows 19-20|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Had East been 5-2 in the Majors a 5-3 Spade fit could have been missed.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sundiszno: so this can be the final |pg||
nt|oliverc: this should make fairly comfortably|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Good stop by E/W, though slam can be made.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Current scores are: England 168; England 2 134; Northern Ireland 121; Ireland 113; Scotland 113; Wales 68|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Both pairs play basically natural systems with strong(ish) NT and 5-card majors|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|galadriel: Although even if you play 20-22, this is probably worth an upgrade|pg||
nt|idc: The defence to 1@hX could have been a carnage but it's a bit double dummy to manage that|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sundiszno: fairly comfortably is a little bit of an axaggeration :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cuttysark: Paterson will switch back to spades given the chance...|pg||

nt|rednaxela: Hallberg is from Sweden.  Silverstone is from Scotland, Waterlow is in Ireland and Holland...|pg||
nt|rednaxela: ...is from Manchester.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: you occasionally make 3NT with a combined 21 points - but not often!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|idc: We don't have any CCs for either pair, so we will make up their system as we go along|pg||
mb|1S|nt|idc: 1@h looks to be natural :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: I used to overcall 1NT with that sort of hand all the time, but partners persuaded me that average 15 counts were not good enough|pg||
nt|rednaxela: So a big swing to England 1 right away.|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Up to date scores and some CCs can be found at: http://www.sbuwest.co.uk/SeniorCamroseTeams.html|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sundiszno: wondered if he wouldn't open this hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello everyone from a rainy Manchester|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@D looks precision-like|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|oliverc: East? easy opening for precision|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 2@d is some kind of GF relay, I think|pg||
nt|sundiszno: yes|pg||
nt|idc: maybe it was the way I played them|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think the 2NT opener shows 20-21, but Paterson has upgraded because of the 5-card suit and good controls|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|xenya: helpful lead|pg||
nt|xenya: perhpas|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: i was a bit surprised John Holland didnt double the last contract|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rednaxela: After a 1@s opening in the other room E/W got to 3NT on board 1.  1 imp to Scotland.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: He is usually sharp on  the doubles|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: 19-20 possibly 21 says E|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|idc: the alternative for West was 1@s, not an unreasonable 4 card overcall|pg||
nt|cuttysark: OK - sorry, must study the CC :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The 'backward' trump finesse (running @HJ on the first round) would work here, but it is a 25% shot|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: now 7 top tricks, and i don't think he has more|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|idc: England are currently 28 VPs ahead of N Ireland in 2nd place - they will be tough to catch|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sundiszno: this depends basically on finding @sQ and @cJ|pg||
nt|sundiszno: easiest is to find @sQ|pg||
nt|xenya: but declarer is in a position to try his (her?) luck in side suits -- no risk so far|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|galadriel: With such a weak hand, Short chooses to lead partner's suit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sundiszno: but if the defense doesn't attack @hs early, you have plenty of time for even going wrong |pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|rednaxela: Partners like that sort of thing.|pg||
nt|galadriel: he himself has no sign of an outside entry|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North cannot get partner on lead to give him his ruff|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|oliverc: no particular reason to get the Clubs right here|pg||

nt|xenya: now time to stop that and just cash out|pg||

nt|sundiszno: again an easy game|pg||
nt|galadriel: 1NT is 14-16|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|rednaxela: Some people would have opened the North hand in 3rd seat at these colours.|pg||
nt|galadriel: AJ doubleton worth a slight downgrade|pg||
nt|xenya: again, 1NT opening and 21C overcall -- seems it just shows a major|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oliverc: The Aceless North hand not worth a push|pg||
nt|sundiszno: didn't you deal decisive boards for the last round, Ivan? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: how about a club lead|pg||
nt|galadriel: perhaps?|pg||
nt|xenya: now 2@D apperas to show @Hs -- a bit incosistent with NS's bidding on board 1 |pg||
mb|3H|nt|oliverc: :) X-ray vision a wonderful thing|pg||
nt|idc: This is an interesting play problem in 4@s|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Brave bid by Waterlw under a lot of pressure.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|idc: If Tony can manage an elimination then East might be left on lead with the 4th round of diamonds to be endplayed|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Yes, it doesn't quite have the look of a push-on-to-5 hand|pg||
nt|rednaxela: He may have hoped for a double fit.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: And found one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: @s now|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|idc: The @h lead makes that more likely|pg||
nt|xenya: tight partscore battle |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rednaxela: I'm not sure. 2-3-4-4 is at least better than 3-3-3-4.|pg||
nt|idc: Of course, he couldn't pass I'm sure, since the 4@h UCB created a forcing pass situation at the 5 level|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|galadriel: Well, it's described as "sound" so we can't argue with that|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East choosing a no-so-safe trump lead: but declarer canot get at dummy's club tricks. |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: John has a glimmer of hope|pg||
nt|xenya: this lead might help|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|idc: I'm guessing that, but most pairs would have that treatmment|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: 4H = splinter|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I would guess that 4@h was a splinter.  |pg||
nt|rednaxela: Christine, was 2@s H + a minor or H + C?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|idc: So it was (my eyes aren't focusing reliably at this early hour) so scratch "UCB" and replace with "splinter"|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: H + minor|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: And greetings from London everyone. No furniture, but I have a laptop, so no worries :)|pg||

nt|galadriel: Holland and Hallberg don't have a system posted - anyone know what they play?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|cuttysark: Intersting line from decalrer, but it looks as if he will make just one more trick with @DA|pg||

nt|rednaxela: So, England 2 strike back.|pg||
nt|xenya: +140 is obviously a good score on that hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Played the other way up in OR, @cJ lead meant a quick -1|pg||
nt|idc: the point still valid - once you have shown game values opposite opening bid, can't let opps play undoubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Strong NT, 5cM and 3 weak 2s I think (Hi all btw :))|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sundiszno: 2@c precision here|pg||
nt|oliverc: 2@C surprises me|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 11-15, 6+ @c, or 5+ @c and 4+M|pg||
nt|oliverc: Normally precision pairs would prefer 1@H over 2@C with the West hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: you leap in @H with shows 6-5 when you open 2@C|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Yes.|pg||
nt|idc: so West's pass over 5@h was at least midly encouraging for East to go on|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|galadriel: Thanks Simon - and Hi :)|pg||
nt|idc: One of the reasons I took to bridge in the 1980s was that play started in the afternoons, unlike chess tournaments|pg||
nt|idc: now that all seems to have changed - a pity|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|rednaxela: A wheel seems to have come off for the Scots in the Open Room on board 2.  With a vulnerable game on they defended a non-vul 2C-6.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And a third flat board - is this tight bridge?|pg||
nt|jtr: Ambitious 3@h maybe but they play 4-card majors|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I have a bed, a table and a chair, what more does one need?|pg||
nt|jtr: I had better not comment|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: Hi, Simon.|pg||
nt|copeyj: On the board before, as I said in private, if 1N was 14-16 I think it deserved to miss a game - you just should not downgrade vulnerable at all imo unless you have an ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: extraordainary reason to which it doesnt look to me like you do on that hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a dangerous double by michael Macdonagh|pg||
mb|2D|nt|oliverc: That's on the basis that it's easier to persuade East that you have a 5th Club after|pg||
nt|oliverc: opening 1@H than having a 5th heart once you open 2@C|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I recall that even early afternoon starts gave you trouble some times in these days.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Silence is Golden, but not typical of you, David|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: ok, but you must persuade hime you have a 6th also|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: Paterson explained it is 14-16 or a poor 17 count before play|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Agreed. To me that was a normal 17 count.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Usually it shows the other 2 suits|pg||
nt|lark20: esp vul|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I fell a victim to that recently, my partner didnt have the  2 suits he promised|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in fact it cost us the event|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I think 1NT or pass with the south hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and take action when 2@C comes back round to me|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning all |pg||
nt|jtr: Well, i dont want to be the first person banned by Walduk|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: ho9oray|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@C or 4@H makes here, but very hard to reach|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|copeyj: It was neither of them. It had two four card suits - makes it positively good for me :)|pg||
nt|jtr: A trump switch makes this interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Interesting result on board 2 in other room|pg||
nt|galadriel: EW going 6 down for a gain of 8 imps :)|pg||
nt|xenya: but not 3N|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|rednaxela: I'm guessing neither could make a penalty double, but someone had to do something!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|oliverc: I would merely point out that 4@H probably making here whereas 5@C is not :)|pg||
nt|xenya: which, however, might make on imperfect defence|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jtr: this will do too of course|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: on this lead, for example|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sundiszno: and in this hand, even if east had a 3rd @h, 5@c is safer, youdon't get shortened|pg||
nt|idc: Lots of good comments from specs|pg||
nt|idc: That's true, but I prefer to think of it as exceptional time management when I arrived at the table bleary eyed at 13:59|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|evtimov: opening 2@C is more aggressive than 1@H|pg||
nt|oliverc: true|pg||
nt|sundiszno: no, you get shortened right after the lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: If you don't play pass as forcing on 2 in the open room then S had to act|pg||
nt|idc: I had forgotten last hand 2NT was opened on just a 19 count - well judged by Tony in 3rd seat|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: hair-raising contract but irish luck may hold|pg||
nt|xenya: i fail to understand why N spurned the natural spade lead|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: but even then the defence must be careful|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yo_yo: John Holland & Gunnar Hallberg  won gold medals last year in south america|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: so formidable opponents|pg||
nt|jcomyn: photo finish|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: They are taking their time with this one|pg||
nt|idc: East hand hasn't proved much fun for Paul Hackett this hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: 2 rounds of spades, then S should switch to a diamond  |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jcomyn: as they say in racing - its a head-bobber|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|galadriel: Yes, even if X is t/o, you are 4-3 in majors|pg||

nt|copeyj: i wld have tox and bid 3@C over 2@D|pg||
nt|lark20: perhaps continuing the cross ruff would have been better|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|idc: Holland's 3@c may show a value raise to the 3 level with @s support|pg||
nt|idc: though some play it as a "mixed raise" - a hand between a preempt and a value raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: 3c = 4card support at least invitational|pg||

nt|vugraphznd: director at the table. result may change|pg||

mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: The Irish play 2/1 , 15-17 NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|evtimov: normal contract 3NT for -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: they missed a game earlyer 1nt opening vs 9count|pg||

mb|2H|nt|idc: West has a nice looking hand for 3NT now - 3 outside tops and some chance of 6 running @d|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|idc: Thanks Operator (Christine)|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: too many intermediates in the North hand for that here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: these two teams are tied in 1st place, so if they are close to a tie, a team from table 2 can win the event|pg||
mb|p|nt|evtimov: now if play @H maybe =|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Always an anxious moment when you open at the 1 level on a hand like this and see it passed out.|pg||
nt|idc: I meant playing in 3NT - not bidding it right away - this enquiry is sensible|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, I think their range is 15-17. Paterson/Short play 14-16|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: I like 1NT with the South hand but Michael obviously doesnt with a 5 card major|pg||
nt|idc: Now Tony's lead problem|pg||
nt|jtr: When will you be old enough to play in this Liz?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Never, at my current standard :)|pg||

nt|idc: I was thinking that in boxing they have heavyweight and superheavyweight divisions|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I must admit I have never got to grips with the mixed raise.  Seems to cut out the space needed to show where those 'some values' are, often leaving partner to guess if they are ...|pg||
nt|rednaxela: fitting or not.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: 3NT if you can see all the cards|pg||
nt|xenya: probably 2 off|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: anyone else ok with opening 1NT with a 5 card major?|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Second board of the set where a backward finesse would triumph - this time  running @C10|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Scotland pick up the first swing of the match on Board 4 - they had stopped well in 3@C, but England 2 tried 3@S - tow down|pg||

nt|idc: and the defence cashing @h to prevent any|pg||
nt|rednaxela: N/S have the values for 3NT but may need to get Diamonds right of Spades are led.|pg||

mb|p|nt|rednaxela: Yes, very different hand evaluation at the two tables leading to 7 imps to Scotland.|pg||
nt|xenya: this might help S find a spade lead |pg||
mb|3N|nt|jtr: 1NT makes a lot of sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: last board of the competition here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: that's a strong 2@S from Hallberg|pg||
nt|jcomyn: miggly-moggly old boards these|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe they dont play drury  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: still no game is there|pg||

mb|p|nt|oliverc: Support Double here showing 3-card @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: not realy probably just points|pg||
pc|s2|nt|idc: North worth a 4@c advance cue here?|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer can still make 11 tricks if he gets jearts right, but this is far from obvious|pg||
nt|xenya: more likely, he will make 10|pg||
nt|xenya: let us see|pg||
nt|vugraphznd: TD ajusted bo.4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|galadriel: Having eschewed the Lucas opening, Short will like his hand now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks as if South's 2@D overcall in the other room was ASPTRO? Anyway, they need todiscuss what 3@H means. Probably will now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|idc: I think so - that @dK looks pretty good |pg||
nt|idc: I'm afraid none of the pairs on show in this match have provided CCs, but we can assume that was a multi 2@d|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|oliverc: maybe. no chance of West having 5-card @S|pg||
nt|jtr: Needs a lot of overtricks to flatten the board|pg||
pc|dA|nt|oliverc: ouch|pg||
nt|evtimov: too oaggressive bid :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||

nt|galadriel: I think East would agree with you Simon |pg||
nt|xenya: how?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|galadriel: And so would I - if I played Lucas :)|pg||
nt|idc: Although it seems like just needing a 3-2 trump break, a little extra work needed in 6@s|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcomyn: indeed cagey stuff|pg||
nt|lark20: unfortunately Teltscher had nothing more to say|pg||
nt|idc: diamonds 5-1 and @h 4-2 might cause it problems |pg||
nt|idc: Hi Beryl|pg||
nt|lark20: Hi Ian |pg||
nt|idc: Just about worth being in it mind you - I guess Teltscher decided that say a 6 card @d suit was needed or something else extra|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|oliverc: If East was just showing points it's clearly pushed West too far|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|galadriel: This looks like a make with trumps 2-2|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps there is a squeeze against N |pg||
pc|h9|nt|idc: garnetts in spec asks the pertinent question: why didn't Victor Silverstone bid 2@s or even 3@h|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: http://www.sbuwest.co.uk/SeniorCamroseResults.html  scroll down for standings|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: drury: " a game invitational major suit raise by a passed hand"|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rednaxela: A pretty normal game.  With the Diamond finesse wrong it neds trumps 2-2, with it right it would make unless trumps were nasty.|pg||

nt|jtr: me too on a good day:)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c8|nt|rednaxela: In the Open Room East also opened a multi.  However, his partner repsonded 2@s, showing interest in going higher opposite Hearts.  This caused East to lead the Q@h rather than a ...|pg||

nt|xenya: yes -- just run diamonds and N is helpless |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h3|nt|idc: Not quite sure why Priday didn't try 4@h cue|pg||

nt|lark20: Yes He had the chance|pg||
pc|c7|nt|idc: We only have a result from the OR, no bidding, but they missed slam there too|pg||

nt|rednaxela: East may wrongly think that West's suit is one of the others.|pg||
nt|idc: A spec tells me you would have doubled it in ANY room|pg||
nt|idc: I like that comment, and not just for the faith it shows they have in you|pg||
nt|rednaxela: in my madness?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lack of aces is usually fatal|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: So, at the half way point in this set England 2 have narrowed the gap considerably.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: the drury mystery is solved, EW play 4 card majors so drury only with 4 card support |pg||
nt|Walddk4: NS can make 5@C but they may never get into the auction|pg||
nt|xenya: as it is, 11 tricks was enough to win the board  |pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzmh: Current standings before last round GIB 183 Quantum 183 Shato rosenovo 178 Bacho 170|pg||
mb|4N|mb|d|nt|jtr: 5@c is not a thing of beauty anyway|pg||
nt|cuttysark: EW can't make much, but they will not realise that till the play starts|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: there are many dangers - if partner bids 4@C over 3@D assuming you have the minor (which is usually the case) then you have to correct to 4@S which could be 1100 against game quite ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: easily|pg||
nt|idc: AT the half way point in the match, just that one game swing seperating them|pg||
nt|idc: sepArating them *blush*|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|xenya: imaginative 4N|pg||
mb|d|nt|galadriel: good stop again|pg||
nt|copeyj: i would overcall an intermediate 2@S if i had it and if not then i'd try 3@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: strange with a 6-3 H fit|pg||
nt|idc: I never could remember how to spell that, until I read a quick way to remember:|pg||
mb|5D|nt|golfsquash: Good morning Kath and John and all.|pg||
mb|d|nt|jtr: Ah now this is a proposition|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hi rory|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi rory|pg||
nt|idc: All roads seem to lead to 3NT here, but it may not make on this lead|pg||
nt|rednaxela: 3NT seems normal.  In the Open Room a Lucas 2@h by West caused N/S to play in Spades.|pg||
nt|jtr: Apart from the @h break|pg||
nt|cuttysark: God contract till hearts break 4-0|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3NT not a silly contract at all, but ...|pg||
nt|jtr: He may well get the bad news at trick one|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: John wanted to show his shape and Gunnar decided that was a safe place to play|pg||
nt|jcomyn: safe certainly but danger of game in open room|pg||
nt|idc: my parents separated because PA was a RAT|pg||
nt|jtr: A moment of happiness when the J holds|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: he can cross ruff the next few tricks to make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: INdeed, he thinks he has made it when the jack holds|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: another board goes to PONCOL|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|galadriel: I like 3@S|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|idc: Declarer has to guess which major Ace to knock out first, and a wrong guess leads to -1|pg||
pc|d9|nt|copeyj: vulnerable preempts show a real hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|Walddk4: This is fun, watching cricket simultaneously|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lark20: 4H may be there|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|idc: Ahha, I missed the @d pips|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: declarer can justtake his 7 trumps, but that's all|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|idc: In my alternate reality, South only has A8xx in @d - carry on all|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Will do.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: for -800 -- but even 3 down (+500) is enough to win the board|pg||
mc|7|nt|xenya: so EW can afford one mistake|pg||
nt|xenya: well done by EW|pg||
