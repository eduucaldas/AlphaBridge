pc|s4|nt|brgpro: normal|pg||

nt|brolucius: decline to cue-bid if you are not suitable for a slam. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why would you not be suitable for slam with five controls?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed. I would have bid 4@H.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: I am asked about controls. The ace is worth two, the king one control|pg||
