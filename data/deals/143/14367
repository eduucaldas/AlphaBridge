nt|vugraphzjp: by pumping his fist in the air|pg||

nt|poohbear: matter of agreements as to whether she should bid 3@h or 3@s|pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps just bid 4@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|poohbear: now there is no stopping Mancuso|pg||

nt|peachy: nice effective auction|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lml: its possible to make 5@D but requires some guessing ... 3NT on a heart lead will not make|pg||
nt|lml: if you lead the @H2 you could block the suit|pg||
mb|3C|an|alert|nt|lml: that is one of the reasons your bridge teacher tells you to lead the @H10|pg||
nt|lml: Gord has learned that lesson!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lml: so Ross knows he needs another trick even if he guesses diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: he could try to sneak a club threw|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|5D|nt|afulton: that is the one difficult card to read if you are playing 3/5 leads v suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: playing the @D10 was not best|pg||
nt|lml: his teacher would have told him that too|pg||
nt|lml: it was never going to gain and here it gave up the diamond suit|pg||
nt|lml: so now Ross could try to sneak the club threw or run diamonds and put pressure on his opponents|pg||
nt|lml: hoping that the long hand gives up a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|afulton: (i meant the 8@c's)|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|lml: thats the good thing about being a very good player ... nobody believes you made a mistake|pg||
nt|stewball: hi everyone|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|lml: Ross was sure that Campbell had a doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|lml: he doesnt actually need to cash out at this point|pg||
nt|lml: yes than you the name grosvenor can be heard wafting around|pg||
nt|lml: if they cash out it will make the play go faster so I am for that|pg||

nt|lml: they took the slow road|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lml: this will now go very slowly .......|pg||
nt|lml: Klim can throw a spade on the next trick so he is comfortable but campbell isnt sure what to throw|pg||
nt|lml: a heart cant be that wrong|pg||
nt|lml: but which black card|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: exactly what is happening|pg||
nt|lml: what is the @C9 telling him|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: he is mouthing numbers as he is thinking...counting something...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: or possibly some sort of western canada prayer|pg||
nt|lml: trying to figure out where the rest of the high cards are|pg||
nt|lml: what can Piotr have?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: he almost played a card|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: there it is|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lml: he should  have made both decisions by now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lml: and we are headed for one down.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|peachy: no fear, not vul|pg||
nt|poohbear: borderline raise on the East hand. I prefer to have something concrete when I raise freely with minimum point count|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|poohbear: either a high trump honor or an ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: or concentration|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|poohbear: 2NT shows @ds with @c tolerance|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: clearly cant be natural since North didnt bid over 1@s|pg||
pc|s3|nt|poohbear: 8 top tricks with a @s ruff|pg||
nt|poohbear: and trumps breaking|pg||
nt|peachy: many also abide by simpler rule that 2NT in competitive auction in never natural|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer needs to do something with @hs|pg||
nt|poohbear: With Ace  third should make it|pg||
nt|poohbear: Defence will be forced to play trumps |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|poohbear: at the other table they opted to play for Ace of @hs onside and went down|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: after first playing a @h to the J|pg||
nt|peachy: at this point, E can play whichever card she wants, declarer should make|pg||
nt|poohbear: only if he guesses @hs|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|an|don't lead !d?|mb|3C|nt|daman: 3NT is gin|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|poohbear: 3NT has 9 tops 4@h has play only if you guess to play for a @c @d @s dbl Squeeze|pg||
nt|poohbear: which would involve cashing the @c ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: and running trumps after the defense takes the first 3@s|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|poohbear: if defense takes 1 @s trick and shifts to a @c then declarer has to rise ace and develop a @s trick. essentially playing for 5-1 @cs|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|poohbear: Clearly the @c King is with North . What else can he have?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|poohbear: would be really good card reading if declarer makes this|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|h6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|daman: push|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|poohbear: so win the @d in hand and cash the @c ace and run trumps|pg||

nt|vugraphzjp: we have comparisons now|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: Yes that will be exciting :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: really only an IMP at stake since the @C are sitting well to pitch the @D losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Woolsey was glad that Stewart had a fairly rotten hand to prevent the Queen of Spades finesse|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bigtrain: that was an example of interferring in big club auctions ending in a bad way...  n/s forced e/w to a game that probably wouldn't have been bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|afulton: true... probably one scenario that went thru his head, "Win @d in dummy and lead @cK for pitch?"|pg||
mb|1S|nt|niclecuyer: 4D seems normal|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 4@S, you mean|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: no splinter in support by passed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: ah, yes...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: good morning to me|pg||
nt|bigtrain: wouldn't surprise me if the other table makes 5|pg||
nt|jlrice: EW have a good 3NT here    but might end up in 4H which would be down|pg||
mb|2C|an|alert|nt|vugraphzjp: keith heard you|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the @S overcall will almost certainly influence them to choose @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: good old Keith|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: lots of pressure from EW|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: good bid 4NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: yes...|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: Taylor should really say stop bidding now and whip this|pg||
nt|jlrice: seems like an aggressive 2C bid    with no heart fit and 3 card diamond suit I would rather pass with W|pg||
nt|jlrice: but if a pass denies 5C I would hate to see partner balance in with 2D|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bigtrain: pass seems a standout...  rebidding 2@C with 5-3 in the minors is forced over a 1@S resonse but here - pass solves all the problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: it is always fun when you have all these red doubles in front on you, X of 4NT then X of 5Cl...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bigtrain: since e/w is playing a limited opener west can just bid game when he has no slam ambitions|pg||
nt|afulton: without @h lead, isn't hard.. but @c's give him 1 pitch and he had 2 discards to make in @d |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: you get into a rhythm|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: best feeling except on the odd time when they rapp it... which will not be here...|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: he may be wondering if the penalty is enough to compensate +650 but he does not know it will be -100 if he bids|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2 pitches|pg||
nt|afulton: ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: ooops|pg||
nt|bigtrain: KQ for one and 10/9 for the other|pg||
nt|bigtrain: plenty of entries also|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: careful defense should nip this|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzjp: maybe even beat it 2...lack of entries to the West hand to take both D finesses and H finesses|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: Taylor has a lot of trust in Balcombe's Dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: Some discussion between screenmates Nick and Ross|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 9c is either top of the suit, or top of an interior sequence|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|bigtrain: there are risks which is why kit choose the line he did|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|d2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but in a pair game i would guess the field would make 5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|jlrice: the play should go relatively quickly now for -1 as the show up squeeze does not work|pg||
pc|h6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bigtrain: there is a squeese that works|pg||
nt|bigtrain: cash the @CA and run trump|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jlrice: yes   since clubs are 5-1|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it's not likely he'd find it though|pg||
nt|bigtrain: squeeze still operates as a crisscroos |pg||
nt|bigtrain: hmmm  i thought i saw a duck of the @DK|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: EW did what they had to do and gave a problem to NS which is what you are supposed to do, nicely done|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: starting off with multi|pg||
nt|jlrice: this is an interesting one   can make 7 clubs but will be tough to get there now|pg||
mb|2N|an|alert|nt|bigtrain: 2NT asks for information - suit and strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: these people are courageous, unfav weak NT, I amd too old for this kind of action|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes  a double fit in the majors but NS has a diamond save|pg||

mb|3C|an|alertable - shows clubs|nt|bigtrain: the bad trump split may doom 10 tricks though|pg||

mb|6H|nt|afulton: interesting development!|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: they had a screwup near the beginning of this set and it feels like they are swinging a bit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|jlrice: this will be either down 1 or 2 depending on whether they find the club ruff|pg||

nt|vugraphzjp: playing with the played tricks pile|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: he is going to come to 10 of those later...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: the abbot would find that he has 2 entries to dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: overtake the kd for one, and then finesse the 10 for a second entry|pg||

nt|jlrice: will be a tough 6D to reach    |pg||
nt|poohbear: I agree|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzjp: 3C is either a game forcing xfer to diamonds, or a drop dead bid of 3d|pg||

mb|2H|nt|niclecuyer: yes these are 2 annoying, sort of unlucky battlefield decisions, time for some cold water splashing and back|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: klimo did it after board 2|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@c is likely Natural GF|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bigtrain: 3@S seems a standout and i'm sure they are people that would consider 4 :)|pg||
nt|jlrice: EW might get to 7H on this one though which they will be dissappointed not to make|pg||
mb|5D|an|splinter|nt|jlrice: considering diamonds are both of thier second suit  they might not know that they have such a big fit|pg||
nt|jlrice: and stop in game|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: just needs reasonable breaks in majors  but cant make on 4-0 hearts |pg||
nt|bigtrain: wonder if this is intended as exclusion RKC?|pg||

mb|6H|nt|vugraphzjp: campbell almost just led out of turn|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: this one should be a quick 3 imps to Gartaganis|pg||

nt|bigtrain: that's why 3@S would have been so effective...  the @D would surely have been buried|pg||
nt|poohbear: Woolsey might just bid 4@h here to protect the @s king|pg||
