mb|p|nt|lml: I guess he could pass but vulnerable!|pg||
nt|lml: woops|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: some confusion about whether 3@H was forcing|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lml: its possible to make 5@D but requires some guessing ... 3NT on a heart lead will not make|pg||
nt|lml: if you lead the @H2 you could block the suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: that is one of the reasons your bridge teacher tells you to lead the @H10|pg||
nt|lml: Gord has learned that lesson!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|lml: so Ross knows he needs another trick even if he guesses diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: he could try to sneak a club threw|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|afulton: that is the one difficult card to read if you are playing 3/5 leads v suits|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: playing the @D10 was not best|pg||
nt|lml: his teacher would have told him that too|pg||
nt|lml: it was never going to gain and here it gave up the diamond suit|pg||
nt|lml: so now Ross could try to sneak the club threw or run diamonds and put pressure on his opponents|pg||
nt|lml: hoping that the long hand gives up a heart|pg||
pc|h3|nt|afulton: (i meant the 8@c's)|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|lml: thats the good thing about being a very good player ... nobody believes you made a mistake|pg||
nt|stewball: hi everyone|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: Ross was sure that Campbell had a doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|lml: he doesnt actually need to cash out at this point|pg||
nt|lml: yes than you the name grosvenor can be heard wafting around|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|lml: this will now go very slowly .......|pg||
nt|lml: Klim can throw a spade on the next trick so he is comfortable but campbell isnt sure what to throw|pg||
nt|lml: a heart cant be that wrong|pg||
nt|lml: but which black card|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: exactly what is happening|pg||
nt|lml: what is the @C9 telling him|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: he is mouthing numbers as he is thinking...counting something...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: or possibly some sort of western canada prayer|pg||
nt|lml: trying to figure out where the rest of the high cards are|pg||
nt|lml: what can Piotr have?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: he almost played a card|pg||

pc|s7|pg||

nt|lml: this type of auction should have been discussed; |pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|nt|lml: I play that as forcing without the interference but I agree it makes sense to play it as invitational after the interference with a cuebid available|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|lml: but the point is that it really should be discussed in a serious partnership|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lml: the cards are lying very well for North South|pg||

nt|vugraphzjp: we have comparisons now|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: Yes that will be exciting :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: really only an IMP at stake since the @C are sitting well to pitch the @D losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Woolsey was glad that Stewart had a fairly rotten hand to prevent the Queen of Spades finesse|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bigtrain: that was an example of interferring in big club auctions ending in a bad way...  n/s forced e/w to a game that probably wouldn't have been bid|pg||
nt|peachy: another competitive decision board here|pg||
mb|d!|an|hearts and clubs or spades and dia|nt|peachy: whichever side "gets" to play game, will go down|pg||
mb|2H!|an|transfer|nt|afulton: true... probably one scenario that went thru his head, "Win @d in dummy and lead @cK for pitch?"|pg||
mb|3H|nt|niclecuyer: 4D seems normal|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 4@S, you mean|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: no splinter in support by passed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: ah, yes...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: good morning to me|pg||
nt|bigtrain: wouldn't surprise me if the other table makes 5|pg||
nt|jlrice: EW have a good 3NT here    but might end up in 4H which would be down|pg||
nt|peachy: not necessarily true, but likely|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzjp: keith heard you|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the @S overcall will almost certainly influence them to choose @H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|niclecuyer: good old Keith|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: lots of pressure from EW|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: good bid 4NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: yes...|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: Taylor should really say stop bidding now and whip this|pg||
nt|jlrice: seems like an aggressive 2C bid    with no heart fit and 3 card diamond suit I would rather pass with W|pg||
nt|jlrice: but if a pass denies 5C I would hate to see partner balance in with 2D|pg||
nt|peachy: North has a difficult decision to make, W has announced hearts and clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: pass seems a standout...  rebidding 2@C with 5-3 in the minors is forced over a 1@S resonse but here - pass solves all the problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: it is always fun when you have all these red doubles in front on you, X of 4NT then X of 5Cl...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: since e/w is playing a limited opener west can just bid game when he has no slam ambitions|pg||
nt|afulton: without @h lead, isn't hard.. but @c's give him 1 pitch and he had 2 discards to make in @d |pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzjp: you get into a rhythm|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: best feeling except on the odd time when they rapp it... which will not be here...|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: he may be wondering if the penalty is enough to compensate +650 but he does not know it will be -100 if he bids|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2 pitches|pg||
nt|afulton: ?|pg||
nt|peachy: on the syrface this actually looks makeable|pg||
pc|s8|nt|niclecuyer: ooops|pg||
nt|bigtrain: KQ for one and 10/9 for the other|pg||
nt|bigtrain: plenty of entries also|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzjp: careful defense should nip this|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: maybe even beat it 2...lack of entries to the West hand to take both D finesses and H finesses|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: Taylor has a lot of trust in Balcombe's Dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: Some discussion between screenmates Nick and Ross|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 9c is either top of the suit, or top of an interior sequence|pg||
nt|peachy: unless QH is allowed to score|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|bigtrain: there are risks which is why kit choose the line he did|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzjp: balcombe and klimo are fighting over who clears the tray off the table|pg||

pc|d4|nt|jlrice: the play should go relatively quickly now for -1 as the show up squeeze does not work|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|bigtrain: there is a squeese that works|pg||
nt|bigtrain: cash the @CA and run trump|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jlrice: yes   since clubs are 5-1|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it's not likely he'd find it though|pg||
nt|bigtrain: squeeze still operates as a crisscroos |pg||

mb|1H|nt|vugraphzjp: 2c is for the majors|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: EW did what they had to do and gave a problem to NS which is what you are supposed to do, nicely done|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bigtrain: starting off with multi|pg||
nt|jlrice: this is an interesting one   can make 7 clubs but will be tough to get there now|pg||

nt|jlrice: yes  a double fit in the majors but NS has a diamond save|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they have an excellent chance to make a game with less than the normally required values|pg||
mb|5H|nt|bigtrain: the bad trump split may doom 10 tricks though|pg||
nt|jlrice: but NS can get a ruff to set the contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|jlrice: 3C is natural?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: can mean many things - that is there's no standard menaning|pg||

nt|bigtrain: it appears to be natural\|pg||
mb|p|nt|afulton: interesting development!|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would have guessed either 5 card suit  or minimum with hearts|pg||

pc|d3|nt|peachy: my "prayer" was answered, lots of decisions to make in this one|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|jlrice: this will be either down 1 or 2 depending on whether they find the club ruff|pg||

nt|vugraphzjp: playing with the played tricks pile|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: he is going to come to 10 of those later...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: the abbot would find that he has 2 entries to dummy|pg||

nt|peachy: close enough for goverment work :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|vugraphzjp: 2@C = @H and @C or @D's|pg||
nt|jlrice: but NS has a good save in 7D|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: Ross must feel terrible right now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: keith just complained to klimo to stop flashing his bottom card to him|pg||
nt|bigtrain: preemption over a big club may make it tough to reach slam|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S doesn't seem adequate to me|pg||
nt|jlrice: will be a tough 6D to reach    |pg||
nt|poohbear: I agree|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzjp: 3C is either a game forcing xfer to diamonds, or a drop dead bid of 3d|pg||

nt|vugraphzjp: keith should have told him to go to the washroom|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would have bid 3S  |pg||
nt|bigtrain: i bet they are able to handle it now and reach slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: yes these are 2 annoying, sort of unlucky battlefield decisions, time for some cold water splashing and back|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: klimo did it after board 2|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@c is likely Natural GF|pg||
mb|3S!|an|shows bad hand|nt|bigtrain: 3@S seems a standout and i'm sure they are people that would consider 4 :)|pg||
nt|jlrice: EW might get to 7H on this one though which they will be dissappointed not to make|pg||
nt|mildredb: that cost 5 imps for Jacobs team, but I'm sure Bramley felt the whole 16|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: considering diamonds are both of thier second suit  they might not know that they have such a big fit|pg||
nt|jlrice: and stop in game|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jlrice: just needs reasonable breaks in majors  but cant make on 4-0 hearts |pg||
nt|bigtrain: wonder if this is intended as exclusion RKC?|pg||
nt|jlrice: 5D looks like it has to be exclusion    |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: campbell almost just led out of turn|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: this one should be a quick 3 imps to Gartaganis|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: ross is going for a smoke while keith plays this|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that's why 3@S would have been so effective...  the @D would surely have been buried|pg||
nt|poohbear: Woolsey might just bid 4@h here to protect the @s king|pg||
nt|jlrice: yeah   Kx of spades does not look good cards to try for slam with|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: this should be fast|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: leading out of turn is usually not a good idea unless you are about to lead against something cold anyway :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: Will Stewart show the @d Q since he has extra length?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|afulton: he bid @d... is 5 extra length?|pg||

pc|hT|nt|poohbear: Mancuso should lead the @c king here|pg||
nt|poohbear: trusting partner|pg||
nt|jlrice: will be thinking about this for a while  but the rest of the suits are friendly enough|pg||
nt|jlrice: he can ruff both diamonds and pitch 1 club on the second spade   eventually pulling trump and giving up king of clubs|pg||

nt|poohbear: Pretty light 4@h bid:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: stand attitude card signal|pg||
nt|peachy: W is probably searching for way to beat but will comme up emptyhanded|pg||

nt|mildredb: the only person that gets any rest is dummy on these hands - everyone else working hard|pg||
pc|c9|nt|poohbear: they compensate :)|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|starkist: wow a push|pg||
nt|starkist: very different auction tho|pg||
nt|poohbear: one thing about playing strong @c is that your good hands look Stronger and your weak hands look weaker|pg||
nt|bigtrain: with 90 boards one 800 is inconsequential|pg||
pc|dK|nt|buffytvs: not sure why Ross suddenly decided to call it quits|pg||
nt|buffytvs: perhaps after the game force he felt the jump to 5@D showed distribution rather than high cards|pg||
nt|jlrice: defense can get 6 tricks   by getting a diamond and club ruff|pg||
nt|jlrice: woolsey might have done better by underleading the A of diamonds; Chan might have ducked to the Q|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzjp: weve lost the play here...will just claim|pg||

pc|d9|nt|peachy: in case they were not solid|pg||

nt|mildredb: ok, I shouldn't have said 'likely' - possible |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|buffytvs: clearly not an easy slam to reach|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: I think he'll just go for the ten, needs x-ray eyes to avoid two spade losers|pg||

nt|vugraphzjp: campbell replied he is never off shape|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzjp: i will pass your suggestion onto daniel|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: it will be more difficult to make 1 than 2 here... in 2 you have to make it, in 1 you may do something not good|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: he won't mind if they win, if they don't the maybe my suggestion for the best French restaurant in Montreal would be better...|pg||

mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: what is taking so long?|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 2D must be some sort of spade raise...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 2d is alerted...waiting for explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 2d is probably a suit, but may be lead directing|pg||
nt|poohbear: upgrading to 18-19 by East|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|lml: this should go down but it is harder to defend than play some times|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: yes -- it looks as though EW really lost their way on defence at the oterh table|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 2D says I have the beer card (diamond 7) ... just kidding|pg||
nt|bigtrain: definitely too good for a 15-17 NT|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: they started diamonds, then eventually managed to set up two spade tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: quiet pass...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: campbell says 'in case you are wondering, this case is extreme'|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: oooh..2d showed hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: klimo reminded campbell and he said 'i have hearts'|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: another 2 imps probably for Gartaganis|pg||
nt|poohbear: wonder what 2@d shows?|pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps 5@s 4@h inv|pg||
nt|poohbear: after 2@s bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: if so East should pass|pg||
nt|poohbear: no sense running from 2@s|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lml: and here!|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a better contract than 4S|pg||
nt|mildredb: this should be another dbl digit hand|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzjp: looks like it|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 2D showed hearts??|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I play that but not to show KJ10...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: spade switch may work...get rid of dummies trumps...|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|poohbear: Stewart sees things differently|pg||
nt|jlrice: with the favorable spade layout  2NT can be made though|pg||
nt|poohbear: true|pg||
nt|poohbear: but 10 of @ds is the reason 2NT makes. Otherwise 2@s would be better|pg||
nt|jlrice: 2S is better regardless   |pg||
nt|poohbear: I would lead a @c from South|pg||
nt|poohbear: After a @c lead North will have a good idea of the count since partner didnt lead a 5 card @d suit|pg||
nt|mildredb: yes, much :)|pg||
nt|peachy: don't even have to touch clubs to make|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: 1NT can be hard to defend|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the @S2 gives West the impression that declarer has Kx -- hence th cash of the ace|pg||
nt|lml: I like the idea of switching to a spade but the 2 isnt the right card|pg||
nt|lml: if she leads the @SQ for instance and then shift back to a heart that works pretty well|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so declarer has 7 tricks for sure now just by knocking out the @CA|pg||
nt|lml: even the @S6 might work|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont like that lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzjp: not now|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|afulton: like I said, toasting the Robinson team...|pg||
nt|poohbear: thats a ridiculous statement given the fact that they are leading and Robinson hasnt exactly shined|pg||
nt|afulton: that is true... but one can always wish the opponents a good game|pg||
nt|afulton: personally, i would like to see a team made up mostly of women make it to USA1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|buffytvs: I think Ross is trying to induce a diamond switch from the defence|pg||
nt|buffytvs: there aren't many suits left after all|pg||
nt|lml: nick knows judy has the @H6|pg||
nt|lml: Taylor doesnt have 6 hearts|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: and so Judy has at least one more|pg||
nt|lml: @H9|pg||
nt|lml: sorry|pg||
nt|buffytvs: upside down dyslexia -- the rarest form :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: Please turn your screen right side up, Linda|pg||
nt|lml: well he got his diamond shift but can he afford to win the @D9 anyway|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lml: I guess he can win the 9 and play heart heart|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he can just win thw king and play a club -- easy route to 7 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: whe can always overtake the diamond|pg||
nt|lml: its playing for the overtricks that is slowing this down|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- maybe they're all starting to think that every IMP wil be vital in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: and every imp is vital|pg||
nt|lml: sounds like Monty Python|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: wrong forum for that|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- and every IMP is good (thx specs)|pg||
nt|lml: honestly this isnt tha big a decision since he can always overtake later|pg||
pc|h5|nt|niclecuyer: it will easily make now...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzjp: this doesnt appear to be the same balcombe taylor pair we have been watching the last 2 days...|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
nt|peachy: now I'm surprised, he had 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: still does|pg||
nt|mildredb: just looking for overtrick - no danger|pg||
nt|peachy: no danger, due to C10 protecting the clubs|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: A lot of beginning players would just give a limit raise with jacobus' hand, but with 5 controls (ace = 2 king = 1) and a doubleton, its right to just bid game|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|buffytvs: he almost got the commentators for sure :)|pg||

nt|poohbear: 2@c shows at least 8 minor suit cards. May be 5-3 either way|pg||
nt|jlrice: will need to do some very good guessing to make 5D   but will probably stop in parrtscore|pg||
nt|mildredb: Bathurst evaluated as GF hand |pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzjp: Ross just admitted to having a brain fart playing that hand|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: pass by Gordon really?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: yes |pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: and the third round....|pg||
nt|gavin:  i think the 3@C bid tells a lot about the NT overcallers spade stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: yes|pg||
nt|gavin:  he wouldnt be so inclined to compete to 3@C with great @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 3s may be coming here...but so will 4@C then i bet...|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: good point|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 3Sp is hard to bid...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: good law bid|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I think he will sell tou|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: we needed to get larry cohen commentating|pg||
nt|peachy: Don't now their method, but I would accept with whatever my tool was (showing h)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|niclecuyer: normal I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: larry would be disappointed|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: :)|pg||
nt|gavin:  i think when your partner bids 2@S, vul , that it is important to compete with norths hand|pg||
nt|gavin:  partner will not raise on an empty balanced 6 count here|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: matchpoint is sometimes easier, close your eyes and bid|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: did he forget the @S9 was good?|pg||
nt|lml: imp players just arent used to playing for overtricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: no...he played it...just too fast for me to keep up in the end|pg||
nt|buffytvs: everyone getting tired|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Gartaganis is 4-handed, and Korbel virtually so|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: the not so obvious club switch is needed to hold this to no overtricks|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: another push|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think 2@d is a huge underbid|pg||
nt|jlrice: i wonder why stewart didnt invite with 3d|pg||
nt|peachy: no, explanations says limit plus|pg||
mb|4S|nt|niclecuyer: :) |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfg: can't see other explanations|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: Judy has to switch to a club now to hold this tight|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: that is the best shift and will hold it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: and that is why they are in the finals|pg||
nt|buffytvs: wd|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the problem is this auction opener may only have 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: 3c showed short diam, 3d asked for more info, 3n showed some extras|pg||
nt|peachy: some play that by S, 3C is good hand, 3D accept good, 3S crap etc |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: in which room is the score wrong?|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: this may lead to another win for Gartaganis|pg||

nt|vugraphzjp: yes...made 4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|poohbear: needs to manage her entries carefully to make 4|pg||

pc|s2|nt|niclecuyer: ok |pg||
pc|s4|nt|poohbear: one round of trumps and start @ds|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|gavin:  north needs to give an encouraging signal so partner knows to set up his spades before he enters with the king of diamonds|pg||
nt|gavin:  (the 7 i assume said i like it)|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: braaavo Ross...|pg||
nt|gavin:  north can see his K@D will be an entry|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: obviously the spad was not clear enough|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: Piotr will guess this I think|pg||
nt|gavin:  they typically will try to see if they can figure out who has more @C|pg||
nt|gavin:  because the person who has 4, is more likely to have the queen, 4-3|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I would go down because it is the club Q and I cannot guess that Q|pg||
nt|gavin:  rather than just flipping a coin which is 50-50|pg||
nt|gavin:  so east is going to try to place shapes|pg||
