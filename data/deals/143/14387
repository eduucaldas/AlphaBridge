nt|daman: big fingers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Etter PASSED the south hand -- but they still reached 7@D for a push|pg||
nt|debrose: so 4@C was needed to set up KC.  Rosenberg did not think partner didn't have at least one King.  Probably bid 5N to keep 7N in picture if partner cooperated|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rosenberg was going to bid the grand all the way; he was just investigating if they could have 13 top tricks in NT. 6@D made him settle for the diamond grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|dougdscsu: jacbous found a stellar opening lead in the closed room to set 4@h|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: jacobus*|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17, common to hold 5@H/@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|debrose: The expert consensus is that it is clearly better to show "specific Kings" over 5N, rather than number.  When a King is above the trump suit, it is a judgement call|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D isn't pure @H transfer   more like a Puppet to 2@H to show various hands|pg||
mb|r!|nt|daman: I'm not sure I agree with South's pass of 3@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: options are limited here because Feldman is Passed Hand|pg||
nt|debrose: Redouble shows at least 3 hearts, and values to compete to the 3 level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Debbie -- how does DBL affect the auction??    is RDBL now the super-accept of @H?|pg||
nt|debrose: Without the double, N would have to decide whether or not to super-accept|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She answered before you asked :)|pg||
nt|debrose: With the double, an extra option was available|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: sorry :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 4@D as re-TRF??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2010/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  for scores in all matches after 60 boards. 30 remain|pg||
nt|debrose: The only way to super-accept with 4 hearts for them is to bid 2@S, because as Al mentioned, 2@D can be various hands without hearts, and opener needs to leave room|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|debrose: Because 2@D can be hands without hearts, it is problematic if the opponents interefere|pg||

mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: 5@C could well have been a make. As it turns out, it's a save against 3NT. Maybe Michael can buy it for 4@C?|pg||
nt|debrose: Tough to go back to previous deal, with a 7-5 hand on the screen, but I'm getting asked about the quote|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|debrose: "It was a guess.  God told you to lead something, and I told you to lead something else.  You guessed wrong, that's all"|pg||
nt|debrose: said when Edgar Kaplan's partner led his own KQJ suit, rather than the one Edgar had doubled for|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So who said "If you don't lead my suit, you'd better be right!" ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sounds like Lew Mathe|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Mark Feldman longing for college days when they allowed Reduction Bids  [i.e. after 4@S-DBL  bid 3@C]|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Feldman would have preferred not have been involved|pg||
pc|dA|nt|daman: or would we play 4@H?|pg||
nt|jlrice: they are playing 4H   which will likely have the same fate as 3NT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dougdscsu: i dont like 2nt with the west hand, would just bid 2@h|pg||

mb|3H|nt|jlrice: yes  did not want to try to pick which minor he doesnt have|pg||
nt|debrose: Nobody likes to bid slams more than Rosenberg...  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting --  do 2@H 3@H show same strength but 4@H vs 5@H?|pg||
nt|debrose: Ok, maybe thousands like to as much, but not more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am asked if 2@H is not enough. I agree with 3@H when you have five of them|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlrice: plus has the defense to possibly beat them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would bid 2@H with four|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Roland, isn't the default for 3@H to show less strength and more shape?|pg||
nt|debrose: What I believe to be "Standard" is that a double jump is preemptive after partner's takeout double|pg||
mb|3S|nt|debrose: We prefer to use it as more highly invitational than the single jump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not standard in my book|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe key here is that Rosenberg is PASSED hand so doesn't have pure preempt|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|jlrice: seems much more likely to get a positive result from defending|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I prefer to distinguish between 4 and 5-card support, as do N-S here it appears|pg||
mb|p|nt|dougdscsu: lets see if he hooks the club|pg||
nt|debrose: No, key here is the partnership agreement.  3@H is better than 2@H - but I agree Al that undiscussed most would treat it as more hearts and less strength|pg||
nt|ahollan1: makes sense to me -- how often does the preemptive hand come up?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Debbie -- i was typing that before saw your comment about agreement :(|pg||
nt|debrose: It is not only distinguishing between four and five cards.  3@H is better than 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could be that it is more of a Europe / US distinction as Phil Clayton points out|pg||
nt|debrose: I think 3@H would probably always be five cards, though I don't know that we've spelled that out|pg||
nt|debrose: 2@H could be four, or five with not as good a hand|pg||
mb|5N|nt|ahollan1: may depend upon what is shown by cue bid then 2@H-3@H  or  2@S-3@H  |pg||
nt|debrose: Once North bid 3@H, South is always going to slam.  Grand slam barely possible xxx, AQxxx, Ax, xxx is maximum, but possible I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5N  Pick-a-slam?|pg||
nt|debrose: Yes, 5N is always pick-a-slam except where otherwise agreed |pg||
nt|debrose: nothing else would apply here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with @C position it doesn't really matter, but ...|pg||
nt|debrose: I recommend that agreement about 5N to all partnerships.  GSF is rarely needed (if you play exclusion), and you can still play it in certain situations you agree on in advance|pg||
mb|6S|nt|jlrice: he probably will|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: would Rosenberg bid same with  @Sx moved to @Hx ??    well maybe that is an opening bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One would assume that Feldman wants to choose he is own slam with AKQxxx and the support he got with 4@D. Is there a hand where Michael would cue bid 4@D with two small?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|debrose: If Rosenberg's hearts or spade were worse, he'd have had a clearer choice.  Here both were pretty good for the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or would he not just raise?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Roland -- the key is did 4@D guarantee primary @S support|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dougdscsu: so -2 now|pg||

nt|daman: his @C King should have deterred him from doing that|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: Both rooms chose this action, then were probably tempted to raise when partner bid hearts, but decided not to be too pushy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right, the prototype in olden days was 4441, but 5th diamond makes stayman much more attractive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now we can debate 1NT vs 1@H. I think 1@H would have got them to game|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It's a very good one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Roland what do you rebid over 1@H-1@S?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oops -- i'll have to finish reading that section|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|debrose: 2N obviously forcing here.  For a while it seemed "Standard" to treat that as invitational, but more and more experts now play 2N in response to one of a minor as forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C-2N  BAL Game Force   totally old concept|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: However, one needs a way to bid the invitational hand.  With some partners I use 2@h artificial for that purpose - balanced 11 |pg||
nt|debrose: or so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've also seen  1m-1N include 11 HCP|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We saw Berkowitz-Sontag do just that yesterday. 1@D  2@H = strong with hearts or 11-12 balanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but have felt nervous about non-forcing 2N bid since read my first book on ACOL|pg||
nt|debrose: Yes, 1N could include 11, and 2N GF start at 12, but that's not going to be very accurate|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|dougdscsu: would probably lead a @c |pg||
nt|jlrice: this will likely be down 1 since the KQ of diamonds are both offside|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think that 2@H bid is a Sontag invention -- he also plays [played?] it with Bates|pg||
mb|6C|nt|ahollan1: 4@H Kickback?  [RKC @C]|pg||
nt|debrose: Was 4@H Keycard or a splinter?  Many pair play "one-over Keycard", but that would be 4@D|pg||
nt|debrose: I think a club fit is assumed when opener bids 3@C, since responder must have at least 3 for 2N (I supposed some would bid it with 3-3-5-2...)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: I belive kickback but not explained in writting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm with you Debbie -- immediately assumed Splinter, but 5@C doesn't seem to fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meltzer may gain an IMP here. Baseggio maybe thinking about correcting to NT?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Franco just confirmed this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: maybe 4@D would be natural over 3@D  [but kickback in other situations]|pg||

pc|s6|nt|debrose: It's important to have VERY clear agreements on Keycard in general, and particularly non 4N Keycard bids|pg||

nt|debrose: With six-card minor and game only values, only transfer to the minor with a singleton |pg||
nt|debrose: Most play transfer to minor then new suit shows a singleton|pg||
nt|debrose: Yes, all other things being equal, it's more attractive to lead a major because dummy did not bid Stayman|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @SJxx is ugly though|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: A double in this position should GUARANTEE at least 4-4 in the other two suits or a very strong hand, and this is something Feldman knows Rosenberg strictly adheres to|pg||

pc|cQ|mc|11|nt|caitlin: Here are scores up till last match......sorry 5..forgot that @S8:)  http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2010/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nice try for west to hold singleton Q or J|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finally last hand of the segment|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlrice: 7H is a very good result in the other room|pg||
nt|bobh1: this one looks tame|pg||
mb|1H|nt|daman: play resumes in roughly 75 minutes from the completion of this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15 boards remain for this "round of 16" where 10 teams competing|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@H or will Rosenberg explore possible 3N|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ritong: or slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: it seems unlikely that South would stop below 7@H|pg||
nt|ritong: his pard is not supposed to hold the @s K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: slam opposite passed hand?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
mb|3D|nt|daman: this is exclusion BW|pg||
nt|daman: for @Hs|pg||
nt|jlrice: needs a 4-3 spade break  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: how to respond to exclusion with an additional side void :)|pg||
nt|daman: with great skill|pg||
nt|bobh1: S is a PH so maybe slam is remote|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: maybe a leap to 6@H    seems very perilous to do that|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bobh1: but choosing between 3n and 4@H might be an issue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Feldman did have available Fit Showing jump shift over 1@S, so that probably rules out slam|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jlrice: i would just assume i didnt have the void and say the KC i have|pg||
nt|daman: 5NT should be GSF|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: 5nt is queen ask|pg||
nt|daman: 5NT might have been better over 3@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: curiously @D wide open but 3N makes because of East's !9 blocks the suit|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3n will be ok because the @ds block|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bobh1: but looking at the NS hands alone you should be happy you avoided it|pg||
mc|11|nt|bobh1: ok bye all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 3@D was a "last train" type response to the 3@C probe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: back in a couple minutes|pg||
