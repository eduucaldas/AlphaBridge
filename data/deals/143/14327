nt|vugrapha2: Welcome to the final session of the VCC 2010|pg||
mb|1C|mb|4S|nt|janm: East might decide to make a light overcall, but 1@d doesn't take up any space and he has such good support for the majors, he'll probably pass|pg||

pc|s7|nt|sybarra: do you really want to sit with N hand?|pg||
nt|janm: But I don't know what 2@d by N was - maybe 2@c was a relay to 2@d and then S was going to describe his hand until the DBL. |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is the is an accident happening |pg||

nt|janm: but probably thought it looked more like a weak NT than an unbalanced hand with clubs|pg||

nt|sybarra: this is agressive |pg||

nt|janm: difference. It's because it makes life so much easier when 1@d shows shape|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 4/1 @D break will make this a challenge|pg||
nt|janm: 5@d is aggressive, but he can guess that his partner doesn't have much wasted in clubs, since the vulnerable opponents bid and raised them|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we are a trick short here |pg||
nt|janm: See how much more comfortable this would be if the 1@d opening had shown an unbalanced hand - then either West would have a major suit singleton and could cross ruff a bunch of ...|pg||
nt|janm: tricks, or he'd have a 5th diamond so they wouldn't be so likely to split badly|pg||
nt|janm: Klinger is a very strong player - maybe he'll be able to find 11 tricks - only has 2 obvious losers after all (club and spade)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||

pc|d3|pc|h8|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|janm: Or with S out of clubs, he can take a spade finesse and take spade tricks|pg||
nt|janm: He's trying to figure out ways to make it if things aren't lying well of course.|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably worried about how many @C del monte has |pg||
nt|janm: What if the heart was a stiff or doubleton for instance - then he might have to play a spade now, before pulling the rest of the trump|pg||
nt|janm: I suppose that Fruewith might have overcalled 2@c, even vul, with Kxx, Qxxx, x, AKxxxx and then he needs to play heart to the J, heart to the A diamonds and spade to the Q|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: very tense atmosphere here|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|h3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|janm: Sorry, I often have 14 card hands :), but I meant AKxxx of clubs |pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect tense/intense|pg||
nt|janm: I think he decided that if N had only 5 clubs, he'd have the K of spades, so the spade finesse early was safe in a funny kind of way|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|janm: Some people play that the 2NT bid asks partner to bid the lowest suit in which he wouldn't accept an invitation - if that was what it meant here, it worked well|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: can he make sure it stays untangled?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is he just going to cross ruff?|pg||
nt|janm: Looks as if he's planning to cross ruff but with S having the same shape as dummy, that might not work|pg||
nt|janm: He'd be better off for cross ruffing if dummy had some of his nice spade honors|pg||
nt|janm: Del Monte probably deciding whether he'll do better to ruff and play a trump to cut down on the ruffs, or copy dummy and pitch a diamond or ruff and play a diamond - complicated ...|pg||
nt|janm: hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  he has lots to think about here|pg||
nt|sybarra: no worries re time  I presume|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|janm: Guess we should think along with him - if he ruffs to play a trump, declarer can win in hand, ruff a club high, ruff a heart, play a club to pitch a heart as S ruffs ... I don't ...|pg||
nt|janm: think that works for declarer. If he ruffs and plays a diamond, declarer can ruff in dummy, ruff a heart, ruff a club or diamond high, ruff a heart - still isn't going to make it|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|janm: Certainly that seemed like the most "natural" thing to do here - now declarer can score a diamond ruff, 2 heart ruffs and the spade A, but I think that's it|pg||

nt|janm: 1@d showed either clubs or a balanced hand. DBL of 1@d showed 4+ hearts. 1@h I suspect showed a weak NT, don't know if it promised 3 hearts|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|janm: That's a new typo for me - 1@c of course!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|janm: Usually one of the benefits of these methods is putting the overcaller on lead, but here it doesn't happen to matter|pg||
nt|sybarra: is this going to stretch?|pg||
nt|janm: I hate to make predictions, because I'm usually wrong, but I'll bet on the defenders :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: me too,  think n/s is at least a trick short|pg||
nt|janm: And I will predict that 1@h showed 3 hearts, since I don't think N would have leaped to 4 if he didn't know they had an 8 card fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I have been wrong before also|pg||
nt|janm: It looks to me as if they have 4 losers they can't avoid (2 spades, 1 heart, 1 club) as well as not having 10 tricks, so it's going to be VERY hard for Del Monte to overcome that|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|sybarra: low club|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully this helps but I think still a trick short|pg||
nt|janm: If East rises here, Klinger will have to hop with the spade K to lead that third heart, but things will be pretty clear by then. If East ducks, the club trick won't really go away, ...|pg||
nt|janm: because declarer only has the one trump and it's smaller than Klinger's|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|janm: Or this even easier set, ruffing the club and later still taking the club AK, since he has no place to put his clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|sybarra: thx to Christine our terrific operator |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|janm: 1NT is probably 12-14 or thereabouts, and it looks as if 4@c is South African Texas, transfer to hearts. |pg||

nt|sybarra: and thx Jan to you also for your comments  |pg||

nt|janm: slammish hand and the opener can bid the step with a good hand for slam and the suit that's shown with just a normal hand.|pg||

nt|janm: Here West wasn't interested in slam anyway, but on some hands he'd have been happy to be able to make a mild slam try below game|pg||
mc|10|nt|janm: PIcking up the pace here - maybe the director told them to play a little faster :)|pg||
