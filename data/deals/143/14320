nt|ritong: not sure why|pg||
nt|ritong: two flaws|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2 10s|pg||
nt|henryb:  not me|pg||
nt|hedyg: stiff KQ is a flaw|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: both majors too|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: it just looks like a 14 count to me|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hi bill|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: hi everyone|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  It looks like a 13 count to me|pg||
nt|hedyg: lost the @hs|pg||
nt|ritong: no matter what, 4@s is obvious and will roll home quietly|pg||
nt|dima:  I agree with Henry|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: west can drop the @H10 under the @HA, trying to look like a man with @HQ10 doubleton|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dima:  So commentators can keep the audience laughing with their theoretical discussion|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  won't help|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure why S bid 4@d if he just bids 4@s now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dima:  Worth only 1 slamtry|pg||
nt|henryb:  declarer can then endplay East with the third heart|pg||
nt|athene: ok, west might find it hard to convince south now that he has @HQ10|pg||
nt|athene: yes the clubs are frozen so even @HAK would make the hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dima:  Not much to do here after the lead|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ritong: a bizarre situation where both defenders could have singleton @h|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not think that was right|pg||
nt|dima:  West might have doubled 1@s with 4@h and enough to jump to the 3 level ...|pg||
nt|henryb:  the jump to the three level was preemptive, not constructive|pg||
nt|hedyg: he didnt need anything except long @ds for the 3@d bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: which is exactly what he has|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|dima:  Yes but many people do not suppress hearts (admittedly with 109xx it might be a good idea to supress them)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: when the bidding has started 1@C 1@D 1@S, there is not much point finding hearts if you have both red suits|pg||
nt|athene: because if your partner has a heart fit it's a double fit hand anyway so you are fighting against spades|pg||
nt|ritong: a bizarre situation where both defenders could have doubleton @h|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol Henri|pg||
nt|athene: and when opponents have spades, all suits rank equal :)|pg||
nt|ritong: i mo he will play @ss by the top|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Bachar cleverly played 8@H, not the 9|pg||
nt|henryb:  declarer could now make an overtrick: @dK, @sA, @s and West is endplayed to break clubs|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer has to decide whether to finesse the spades|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|hedyg: forgot to cash K@D|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|athene: yes, cashing the @DK for a club pitch first must be right, if you are going to run the spade|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: then even if west wins @SKx and gives his partner a ruff, he will be endplayed|pg||
nt|henryb:  even if you are not/|pg||
nt|ritong: good point bill|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: can't the defence come to two spades and one trick in each of the other suits here?|pg||
nt|athene: against 3@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: opened 2@H(@H+other)|pg||
nt|athene: it was pretty good play (or bad defence) to land 3@H|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  or even down 2: But it is hard to tell which of N-S should act over 2@h|pg||

nt|hedyg: defense was not best|pg||

nt|ritong: 2NT would not shock me here|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt - transfer - accept - 4minor|pg||
nt|athene: is that natural or a cue for the major?|pg||
nt|athene: standard is natural (if opener's simple acceptance didn't promise a fit)|pg||
nt|athene: but you see people using it as the cue all the time|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|henryb:  1@d would not shock me|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Depends on accept structure, some people accept = 3+ fit for major, then it is Q in the first place|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dima:  Well this on is worth 20 points|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|dima:  what is 4NT now Blackwood or signoff?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Some, including me, play that transfer to @h, then 3@s is a slam try in @h, because with both majors would start with Stayman|pg||
nt|athene: i hold a militantly agnostic position on the meaning of 4NT in these auctions - "i don't know what it means, and no-one else does either"|pg||
nt|dima:  My prefered method also|pg||
nt|ritong: "the other major" as a global slam try is an excellent idea|pg||
nt|dima:  But the other major after TRF to @s kills a lot of space|pg||
nt|ritong: it does not work after a transfer|pg||
nt|ritong: after stayman, yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|ritong: after a transfer, 2nt 3@h 3@s 4@h, that is, i think is natural|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|dima:  With both majors you just always start with Stayman|pg||
nt|ritong: and slam mild try or not according to the rest of the system|pg||
nt|ritong: with 5/5? i guess you are joking|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||

pc|c2|nt|andreasw:  cards fitting perfect here|pg||
nt|sybarra: suprised, W just didnt bid 3 @S |pg||
nt|haans: in france they bid natural after 3@H as if they have game|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dima:  Now for most it would be @d fit + @h shortness|pg||
nt|sybarra: is there a reason for that? |pg||
nt|sybarra: isnt 3 @H a transfer?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dima:  I told you about practical natural bidding|pg||
nt|dima:  Next board :)|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|reisig: Very conservative bidding|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|haans: yes trasfer but 3@S say ok lets play spades|pg||
nt|haans: forcing like|pg||
nt|sybarra: well had W been able to see E hand,  might have prefered spades|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|haans: we now use transfer before we bid Flint but france bids neither|pg||

nt|hedyg: test @ds and finesse in @c|pg||
nt|ritong: dechelette can t afford to duck this|pg||
nt|ritong: because of the @h shift threat|pg||

nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you not Henry?|pg||
nt|henryb:  No; I would open 2@s and show a good hand with bad spades if partner asked|pg||

nt|ritong: a likely 3@d final contract|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: 3@d will work fine|pg||
mb|2C!|an|unicolore|mb|2N!|nt|hedyg: might make 10 tricks|pg||

nt|ritong: yes|pg||

mb|3C|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2NT was for @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: so they play system on|pg||
pc|c9|nt|henryb:  that is fairly normal over 2@c|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dima:  Yes - has a lot of advantages over artificial 2@c|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d3|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|henryb:  or even over natural 2@c|pg||
nt|dima:  well - you might want to compete in @d over NATURAL 2@c|pg||
nt|dima:  But memory strain is a bigger factor than ittle theoretical advantages|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes you might, but you also might want to bid Stayman|pg||

nt|henryb:  right, and since one also does not want to lose the advantages of transfers, it is popular, and probably right, to play "system on" over 2@c interference|pg||

nt|haans: quit right|pg||
mb|1N|mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|ady: 5@D   ambitious in OR   would have tht 4@S a better bet|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3@C best bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|reisig: 6@d is not a bad spot ...but fails|pg||
nt|dima:  But I think following suit preference @s 3 from Partner North could just play @d A and a @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andreasw:  will they reach it?|pg||
nt|dima:  I think they will get to 4@s|pg||
nt|haans: may miss game now|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S???|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: why 3@C you may ask|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like 3 @C  |pg||
nt|haans: 3@D is not clear sign off|pg||
nt|sybarra: may take the majors out of play also early|pg||
nt|haans: best lead @CJ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzmr: we'll see for the few moments|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@h now?|pg||
nt|dima:  They play reasonable weak jump overcalls, so 1@s + 2@s shows reasonable nonminimum hand|pg||
nt|haans: thats better|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|andreasw:  yep|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c9|nt|reisig: Some use 3@h here ..asking a stopper|pg||
nt|haans: ok |pg||
nt|haans: he he|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: best with opps bidding is that if you bid you do show a 6 carder|pg||
nt|dima:  Depends aa bit on partnership agreements :) Frensh style tends to promise values when you bid|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: not really easy|pg||

pc|c8|nt|vugraphzmr: stop in 5 well done :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzmr: yes but still 6@D is good contract|pg||
