mb|p|nt|yo_yo: NS play 2/1 GF with 15-17 NT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|sybarra: my guess is the 2 @H was 5 hts + a minor, |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|idc: So they can relax now and perhaps even allow themselves a sip of champagne during this match|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|idc: Yup|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Welcome to Mike Amops, who gamely helped out earlier - hope the hands are more exciting|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yo_yo: Greer  for NI is playing throughout but with 2 different partners|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Here he is playing with his wife, Moyna|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon all|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yo_yo: the Hands are also a married couple|pg||
pc|cA|pg||

pc|h4|nt|sybarra: welcome Mike |pg||

pc|cT|nt|cuttysark: Good evening everybody, and welcome back to the Seniors Camrose|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Our second featured match is Wales v England2, aka the sponsors team|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|idc: Declarer only has 3 losers but too much work to do for 10 tricks I think|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: hackett and harper one of the pairs who recently returned from Brazil winning the world seniors|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: hts splitting helps |pg||

pc|c9|nt|lestergold: Hi Liz|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: more that sips?  is that the pub version?|pg||
nt|idc: An understandable 3NT here but I guess 6@s is pretty good with East's @h overcall|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Ian|pg||

nt|idc: @hQ I meant|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Current standings, at the half-way point after the 1st Round Robin are: England 102; England 2 81; Northern Ireland 78; Scotland 72; Ireland 68; Wales 46|pg||
nt|sybarra: well some of us will only put in comments when "approprate"   |pg||
nt|idc: OR played last hand in 4@s, so just an IMP swing|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: Ew play Acol with a weak NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Results available on www.sbuwest.co.uk/SeniorCamrosehtml|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: The format here is 6 teams (including England 2, the sponsor's team)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20 hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: c@c a fair contract |pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: 6@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: only requires club break|pg||
mb|2S|nt|idc: They play each other twice over the weekend, two 14 board matches v each other team|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: some might have ventured in with north if system allows|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an easy one to reach tho|pg||
nt|sybarra: so how do most of play the X agst the 2 @d ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @d= lolng major is my guess |pg||
nt|lestergold: however i sense a 3N coming on|pg||
nt|lark20: Paul plays it for penalties|pg||
nt|sybarra: "dashing" into 3 nt now?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they wont go under slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland would be dashing into 6@c|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: i think that's a range probe|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Scotland are the holders of the Senior Camrose - I'll try to mention that a lot before tomorrow, since I doubt it will be true afterwards :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: obviously Peter doesnt mind the 2 doubletons for his NT opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: 32 points and an 8 card fit they should get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: think I will just as soon defend |pg||
nt|rednaxela: Welcome back everyone.  I suspect our operator is catching us up with events so far!|pg||
nt|lestergold: in theory that is|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that was commentators curse |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cuttysark: Patrick Jourdain is a Camrose veteran: he has won the Camrose playing for Scotland when he was here for a brief spell, but usually represents Wales|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Gareth Jones also plays Camrose for Wales, usually with son dafydd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: any actual residence requirement?|pg||
nt|idc: Well, we seem to be back|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome all to Scotland v Ireland in the 8th match of 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: for both andreas and Mike |pg||
nt|lestergold: i predcited 3N a long time ago|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: Indeed - a 2 year residence requirement, during which time you cannot play for any other country|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: n/s do well in a diamond contract|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: 2H denies a major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure why Jean wanted to know the range but I am sure the Mackenzies are pleased to know|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|idc: Our operators have managed to get the results for board 17 into the system while we had technical problems|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: brb all,   need to take neighbor to taxi  (she is invalid)   |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i think 3nt nt is a wery weak bid from hackett if he dosent like his hand he could at least invit to slam|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: well thats to bed with A@h|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rednaxela: N/S playing a safe 3NT.  6@c would have good play on a non-diamond lead.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: This is round 8 of 10 in the Senior Camrose.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: That is a fine lead from Price - reckons he will never establihs his own suit so may as well look for partner's|pg||
nt|xenya: seems the set started earlier than scheduled  |pg||

pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: its certainly a pessimistic bid surely anything wouold be forcing how about starting with 3C?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|idc: Ireland made a tricky 4@h in the other room on 17, so have an 8 IMP lead already|pg||
nt|lestergold: then Harper should bid 4@c and they are away|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h2|nt|rednaxela: Enland are in a commanding lead in the event. The two teams on show here are separated by only 2 vps.|pg||

nt|sybarra: and a bunch of extra tricks |pg||
nt|idc: Guess it needs a @h lead and @d switch, not a defence that is possible to find|pg||
nt|lestergold: someone keeps dealing 20/20 hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah thanks christine, i was an operator a few weeks ago, not easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but full credit to a thoughtful lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Not clear that the diamonds were 5-3|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: these are only "mildly" shapey |pg||
nt|sybarra: will W sit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w do no0t want to get too high here in spades|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And 6 imps to N ireland who stayed in 3@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C is multi landy, showing both majors|pg||
nt|yo_yo: (not sure if that promises 5/4 )|pg||
nt|lestergold: was 2@h forcing?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|idc: Everyone and their dog is playing weak major/minor 2M openings these days|pg||
mb|d|nt|cuttysark: South opened a Multi in the other room, so North is playing 2@H|pg||
nt|idc: NS here play 15-17 NT and 5 card majors|pg||
mb|2D|nt|idc: EW are 11-14 NT and a 5 card spade suit opening|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C -- both majors?|pg||
nt|xenya: just what E wanted to hear|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@d must be to stand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|cuttysark: Heart lead in the other room did not trouble declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is the explanation of this auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: N in the other room did well to hold to -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: -2|pg||
nt|idc: West hand is worth something between 2.25 and 2.51 @s according to my made-up-odds system|pg||
nt|lestergold: shoud be able m to scramble 9 tricks on cross ruff ines|pg||
nt|andreasw:  or not?|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: opposite a protective dbl it isn't quite as good|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: The 1NT was alerted, no doubt it is wide range, from 6-11 (no more since he is a passed hand)|pg||
nt|xenya: i would have thought so, yes|pg||
mb|d|nt|cuttysark: I suspect this double by the passed hand showed a major and a minor, or some such thing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: south says he should have atleast 4 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: it does look rather odd to choose the 4-2 fit rather than the 5-3 :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok, this convention perhaps should remain nameless|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: there are hazards but declarer should get out for the loss of 2 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Agree that 3@S is a bit optimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 15-17 NT when vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: without 2@s by east would harper have bid 31H?|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|idc: West was thinking of c!K to retain a @c entry to dummy for diamond ruffs|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: both the Welsh ladies represented Wales a few weeks ago in the Lady Milne|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The 'someone has blundered' defence to 1NT - it is becoming more popular|pg||
nt|fabsayc: meanwhile defense has had many opportunites to lead trumps|pg||
nt|idc: A @c switch (or the @sK) would have worked well there|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like S's was optional|pg||
nt|xenya: S's double*|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: good to see the ladies playing |pg||
nt|yo_yo: not for the english teams though :9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or scots|pg||
nt|rednaxela: J@c would have been best.  A small one could have been ducked to East.|pg||
nt|idc: But @h was the natural continuation, though declarer now has time to set up @d|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: hm... drWING TRUMPS DOES NOT SEEM TO BE BEST HERE|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry caps lock hit|pg||
nt|idc: It may work with South having @sQ9, but agree on a lot of other layouts|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe 2@H would have made -- hard to tell now|pg||
nt|xenya: but 3@C should go down|pg||
nt|andreasw:  it would have made|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: or irish|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: England 2 playing in diamonds in both rooms - not usually a successful ploy|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: north should havwe played a club|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|lestergold: home now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One Scottish lady played last year :)|pg||

nt|yo_yo: obviously no one good enough this year :)|pg||

nt|cuttysark: That was no lady, that was ....me|pg||
pc|dT|pc|cT|pc|d3|pg||

nt|lark20: I don't think !2H was frocing and south has a very flat hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|idc: I remember meeting Michael MacDonagh when he played for Ireland in European Champonships a few years ago|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: He had a different partner then IIRC|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Spades plays very well for E/W|pg||

nt|yo_yo: will peter raise it?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  how strong are N/S and E/W nt?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cuttysark: Waterlow did rather well to make 10 tricks in the other room - won't like losing an imp for his pains :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: We play hardly any Board-a-match scoring in Europe, which is a pity|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever hackett bids now they will play in spades|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they will problebly end up in 4@h here have to play carefully to win|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzjc: 20-22|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Ah - if it had been 19-20 they could play there, but even the 2-level looks rather high|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I'm not sure it counts as bridge but it is fun :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: most difficult form of the game (imo)|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Well, well!|pg||
nt|idc: Not a classic 1NT overcall by East but I admit to a sneaking admiration for the bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|lark20: better than 2@C|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Good afternoon, Mike.|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I suspect so; beyond me for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Alex|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: A gay leap to 5@C in the other room - unlucky to be doubled, but this is a better spot|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||

nt|lestergold: Hi Ian|pg||
nt|lark20: Hi you are lucky!|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I must admit I would be a 2@c bidder - trusting that partner would expect a decent hand from me vulnerable at the 2 level.|pg||
nt|lestergold: not sure i liked Rae's overcall of 1N|pg||
nt|idc: The @s position is favourable for declarer but just one too many losers overall|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|yo_yo: he's good at spotting those pips :)|pg||

nt|lestergold: low dim is a killere|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: hmmm|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure why he did that|pg||

mb|2S|nt|lestergold: 4@H form N/S looks makeable as cards lie|pg||

nt|idc: Scotland -500 in that 4@h X contract in OR - they will be surprised to learn that gains they 3 IMPs|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s can make game in either major as cards lie|pg||
mb|d|nt|andreasw:  the dbl now from W should get them in 6@H|pg||

mb|5D|nt|lestergold: if you hear pard clubs you can bid dims showing your hand|pg||
nt|idc: I guess they don't play transfer after the dbl for example - nice to be able to show good raise|pg||
nt|idc: or perhaps that *did* show a good raise?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@H strikes me as an appropriate shot with south's hand knowing that any club honours with north likey  to be well placed|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this feels like it should make|pg||
nt|idc: NS CC just says raises are preemptive after dbl|pg||

mb|5S|nt|cuttysark: No heart overcall in the other room|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this is ok too|pg||
nt|rodal f: But wich black hook after 1@H?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Decalrer has to guess which black suit to finesse - rather like an earlier hand he got wrong. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Rather him than me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he first has to play his queen|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they fiind the 4/4 fit|pg||
