nt|sga1: i agree but since u and me were not there it gave chance to other Teams as well :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i prefer to bid @H but Gupta obviously knows what he is doing  (i hope)|pg||
nt|granguru: even by S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  interesting deal - EW can manage +130 or 140, but NS can preempt with @c |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|drkvas: 11 bds 36 imps guj really needs some huge swings  last 1 was possible 800 if dbl n@s lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andreasw:  thsi dos not look good for N-S|pg||
nt|andyv:  the price is not right for N on this one|pg||
nt|yo_yo: why did Gupta have to bid at all|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes could make by just playing to set up spades and planning on losing 2d and 1c - by managing entries better 42 spades good enuf|pg||

nt|sybarra: Pard cannot expect me to have anything more than a club suit with 2 opps bidding |pg||
nt|andyv:  you told him on previous hands he wasn't bidding enough:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  lol|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah yes  my fault :(|pg||

nt|vugraphzhs: waiting for south....not on table|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  seems, the leader changes after this board|pg||

nt|sybarra: will E play to smother the 10 of @S?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: or does he need to? |pg||
nt|panja: hi Sandip|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  the 3@d bid by S almost looks as if someone misbid... maybe S thought N's 2@s showed @s and @ds?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  or missunderstood 2@d?|pg||
nt|andyv:  or @s and another (not clubs) and 3@d was pass or correct|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont play precision but the 2@D bid worked like a charm for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: 2@s was alerted strong|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: 2@d|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's with the name of the team Mahesh?|pg||

pc|s4|nt|suketbombi: a slender lead of 3 imps for TN|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sga1: -1 now|pg||
nt|sga1: 11 IMPs to WB|pg||
nt|suketbombi: venky is K venkatraman kista is the derivative of Pista  Krishnan Kacchu is dey sarkar while Chotan is bardhwan but all well known by their nick names|pg||

nt|yo_yo: well another hit for Ariz!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: 2@d was alerted as multi|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this looks interesting|pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS had better be careful on this one|pg||
nt|andyv:  which 4 of a major will it be or will they settle for 3N?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: it is much closer now may a tie at this stage|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wasnt playing close attention, i thought it was off|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello shirley|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: me 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: mis defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: no clue if I am late or early |pg||

nt|sybarra: hello again Mahesh |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Hello Shirley|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Afternoon ...Hot in Chennai here|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: brb |pg||
nt|sybarra: and a part score battle here|pg||
nt|granguru: good to look under it perhaps?|pg||
nt|granguru: chance for 4@H N-S|pg||
nt|sga1: Today is the Last Day of Summer Nationals with Team Final and Pairs Final (56 Pairs) going on.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Chennai weather as usual HOT HOT HOT|pg||
nt|granguru: and a 4@S defense for ew|pg||
nt|granguru: PLAY IS ALSO HOT HOT HOT HERE|pg||
nt|granguru: temperature increasing....|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: now all back|pg||
nt|sga1: from Smoke break?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: no one smokes here expect me|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||

nt|vugraphzhs: Hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|babs59: Hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi Vladimir welcome|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Raju|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: another  non traditional 1 nt |pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: how do we show the North hand  open 1 and rebid 4?|pg||
nt|panja: EW can make 3@D or 1N here..and NS will make 2@H...|pg||
nt|granguru: almost impossible for NS to bid this good game in @H|pg||
nt|sga1: I agree.|pg||
nt|granguru: lets seee|pg||
nt|sga1: EW will play in 3@s here (likely).|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  but this margin is tiny indeed - next one board and...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andreasw:  yes should be 11-13 and 7 @S|pg||
nt|granguru: S showed @H |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: we are on the same wave length :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: cool in Manchester   14C|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: 35 imps for Tamilnadu in 4 Boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  as it happens often|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice close match for us |pg||
nt|sga1: Redouble generally is played as Rosenkranz showing one top honour in @s.|pg||
nt|granguru: great bid|pg||
nt|sga1: Vow :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  i knew it!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: not south though|pg||
nt|panja: perhaps only 7 tricks in @H on good defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think if S  is going to open 1 nt,  then should bid 3 @D over 2 @S |pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: will be glad no higher than 2 |pg||
nt|granguru: even with 2 unsefull queens|pg||
nt|sga1: EW in 4@h in OR -3 likely.|pg||
nt|babs59: this will go at least -1, more if diamond ruff allowed|pg||
pc|d2|nt|suketbombi: n-s will do to get a @C parial here|pg||
nt|wygbe1: optimistic bid by w, very beatable|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oops 4@S is interesting here|pg||
nt|sga1: Same bidding in other room as well. Why not, we are watching some of the best players.|pg||
nt|granguru: they have only 17 useful points|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  hard to comment on the 6@s bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i sympathise with Gupta , he has an enormous hand|pg||
nt|sga1: Only difference 4@h was doubled by W.|pg||
nt|granguru: reasonably|pg||
nt|xenya: can't escape it|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes. good decision to stop as low as possible. seems reasonable, if partner is limited to 15|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @DQ|pg||
nt|sga1: So 9 imps to TN would be leader once again after this.|pg||
nt|babs59: yes, on the diamond lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andreasw:  S look his partner in the eye's and saw @s AKQ and went to slam only problem was that N blink to many times|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzhs: cant see each other ..screens|pg||
nt|andreasw:  well there is the problem|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he felt the vibes then  :) |pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but got them wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: was trying to recover last board..south|pg||
nt|sandip2006: on @s lead|pg||
nt|drkvas: 4@s good spot makes|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: so the 1st dbl by Sunit|pg||
nt|granguru: but the bidding suggests not to double|pg||
nt|sga1: Kiruba didn't believe his partner will produce a trick. So he decided to pass.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  rkc might have taken care of that problem|pg||
nt|drkvas: a making contract|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|suketbombi: with @D over ruff positio will end up lossing 3 @Ss and a@H|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then S has the bad break to contend with |pg||
nt|andyv:  always a bad policy to chase bad results|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's on a finesse |pg||
pc|d7|nt|panja: shd now switch to @SJ...at trick two|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Gujarat are panicking|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yo_yo: or a drop|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: bad luck|pg||
nt|andyv:  did N have to have the 10@s?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: true|pg||
nt|yo_yo: realise they are doing badly and trying to catch up|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: good result for Gujrat this board|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|panja: what will S play after @H?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|panja: Ariz hasn't thought about that...|pg||
nt|sandip2006: venky should bid 3@d|pg||
nt|panja: E hand will be squeezed in the meantime..that will help South choose a benign shift|pg||
nt|babs59: they are keeping the match close, but swinging every 2nd hand|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|suketbombi: unreal|pg||
nt|granguru: you should count 0 defensive tricks on a non vul preemtive overcall or opening bid|pg||
pc|cT|nt|panja: note that Venky does not know @CQ is dropping|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|sga1: yes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wygbe1: might eke this one out at this stage|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
mc|8|nt|sybarra: that did not help score of n/s |pg||
nt|drkvas: 9 bds 42 a tough ask|pg||

nt|nkgupt: 15 and insufficent chk is a 2nt for all?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|wygbe1: very good slam in h or d available|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: should be reached now - 6n is probly best, since no risk of ruff|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|nkgupt: 3@d=5+@h|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|wygbe1: 5n must be pick a slam|pg||
nt|wygbe1: n might have picked 6n with aq of spades|pg||
nt|nkgupt: wud hav expected 3@c-3@d(@d longer then @h)-3@h(showing 5 and forcing)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzau: inking|pg||
nt|wygbe1: apparently 3d showed 5h - maybe they play transfers? - and 5n must have been pick a slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wygbe1: i agree with nk - that would be better auction|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  once I took part in speedball tournament in Poland: 7 minutes for 2 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: lucky u Sveta|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow!!  that is fast |pg||
nt|sybarra: and fun,  I like the speed balls, |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: hope they played speed ball in nationals:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think ours are typically 10 min for 2 |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  fortunately, there were only 18 boards to play - even thereafter I got the feeling of the end of working week.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  E-W shoudl reach 4@s or 3nt here and go down:(|pg||
nt|yo_yo: any comments Mahesh?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: silence all around|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very good|pg||
nt|panja: good play by Venky..if @CQ did not drop, he would have reverted to @S finesses|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant bring myself to say WD :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: cant lead @c with KX west...|pg||
nt|sybarra: my other comment would be "not great defense" |pg||
nt|yo_yo: no one would lead a @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont think W can find the club lead either |pg||
nt|sybarra: needs some swing bds |pg||
nt|drkvas: the dbl shd have come in the previous bd|pg||
nt|sga1: NS would not believe that they lost imps after this wonderful bid here.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sure make it as interesting as possible|pg||
nt|xenya: nice slam here|pg||
nt|sga1: Rather cold shud be easy to bid and make.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will bump into it by sheer hcps|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: again I will say, if one opens off shape 1 nt  as S did, maybe should bid 3 @D over 2 @S |pg||
mb|2N|nt|yo_yo: surely a precision club now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: n/s playing precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: e/w std|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: does N say X or just bid spades? |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's not the hit! a kib from Norway informed, that they play speed ball as 9 minutes for 3 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: sorry |pg||
nt|andyv:  E passed?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this can't be right?|pg||

nt|granguru: there is a chance to climb to 6 in a minor here|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|sybarra: 4 @H may be more of a challenge |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: they dont have TV here or could have watched football :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: taking bull by the horns, as we say,  he just bid it |pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: you missed Roland slam last board Raju :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will find an ace missing  kachchu would not believe this:)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andreasw:  another strong @c?|pg||
nt|panja: interesting play |pg||
nt|panja: @HQ will get ducked I guess..but W has @DK entry for @H's|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has Vahalia shown 5@D and 4@C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe just clubs so far |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: should be good result for n/s this board...5@c or 5@d|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope they dont bid another slam |pg||
nt|granguru: no chance, ofcourse|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we will have to tell you soccer scores then |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: watching on net :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: 0-1 55 mins|pg||
nt|sybarra: (the window behind vugraph ) |pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but this one doesn't look that strong|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes should be 5/4 either way|pg||
nt|drkvas: trump lead|pg||
nt|granguru: 3NT is a solid contract as the cards lie|pg||
nt|sga1: No way.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzhs: yes..with this slow play can see score atleast|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at least, this board is "nothing special"|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: but still |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 5/4 either way, thanks to specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Vahalia thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: being red may slow him down |pg||
nt|yo_yo: bid up Vahalia!|pg||
nt|sga1: 3NT right contract. 3NT shows no 4-card major if 3@c was Puppet Stayman.|pg||
nt|granguru: looks like puppet|pg||
nt|granguru: Baron I was excplained..but then N should have said 3@D|pg||
nt|sga1: If 2NT is 20-21, kacchu wont beleive A is missing.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: with those poor pips i ma not sure 2nt opening is justified|pg||
nt|sga1: believe|pg||
nt|sga1: I agree Raju|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sfoxa:  may be, try @h and fast claim?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: obviously, 3n was going down, but south didnt like position of club k for defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 6-4 bid one more |pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult to Ariz to bid after a slow double|pg||
nt|granguru: explained*|pg||
nt|sga1: Difficult to believe, no one plays Baron on 2Nt opening (IMO)|pg||
nt|granguru: as Baron asks to start bidding 4-cards suits up-the -line|pg||
mb|4S!|an|cue|nt|andyv:  normal contract|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the lead is with North (poor thing)|pg||
nt|andyv:  @h|pg||
nt|andreasw:  with gupta two bids they could have ende't up in 3@s|pg||
nt|drkvas: ho god|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ai |pg||
nt|drkvas: :)|pg||
nt|sga1: with points in short suits also|pg||
nt|babs59: but Chotan is trying to play all the hands.  haven't you noticed?|pg||
nt|babs59: 4 of the first 5 to North...|pg||
mb|5H|nt|andyv:  which will give W a chance to dump 2 @ds after pulling 2 rounds of trump|pg||
nt|yo_yo: never with that strong west hand surely|pg||
nt|suketbombi: was a good board for gujrat but -5 now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4NT  would have brought home the bacon for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes it's good not to know a convention|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  wow... nice lead|pg||
nt|sga1: Most of the players today bid NT with 5-card major, that is why Puppet Stayman is so popular.|pg||
nt|granguru: specially 2NT openings|pg||
nt|granguru: as it is in those hands where is it more important to have the strong hand deing declarer|pg||
nt|granguru: being*|pg||
nt|granguru: E knows west cant have more than 1 point|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Prabhakar thinking|pg||
nt|granguru: more than 3 in fact..as N might have 19 instead of 21|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: still waiting for east to play|pg||
nt|granguru: but if W has the S!J then no more than a Q outside..so there is no chance to find a fast entry in his hand|pg||
nt|granguru: @SJ|pg||
nt|xenya: now they've bypassed blackwood|pg||
mb|6N|nt|yo_yo: good lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: N thinking?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: chotan has yelled from roof top that he has a minimumu minimum & minimum now wants a grand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: was waititng for tray|pg||
nt|xenya: ah|pg||
nt|suketbombi: tray with some goddies in it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: east must be looking at the bids after chotan passed|pg||
nt|suketbombi: .....|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @C underlead i am sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: waiting for east to lead|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|panja: S will not get his @CK now..|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes 4nt to show longer @Ds and 5@C longer @cs or equal|pg||
nt|suketbombi: bacon is not what Vahalia wud look for as he is strict Vegetarian|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok bringing home potatoes then |pg||
nt|sga1: good defense|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah what's the equivalent for vegetarians?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice play|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: difficult to underlead ace of spade now |pg||
nt|sybarra: that would be helpful to clear the @H in dummy |pg||
mc|12|nt|suketbombi: looking at @C A kacchu must have said I told you:)|pg||

nt|andyv:  hi Mahesh:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mahesh has been our hard working operator in this room since beginning,  doing a great job!|pg||
nt|andyv:  if you are going to abuse michaels, you should be 4-5 in the majors as pd with equal length will always chose the lower suit.|pg||
nt|drkvas: yes buddy mahesh are amongt the best vgraph teams gr8 job|pg||
nt|drkvas: good point andy |pg||
nt|drkvas: specs pls note the word abuse|pg||

nt|drkvas: because bridge players have the tendency to say andy recommends it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Thanks Shirley and Dr.|pg||
nt|andyv:  oh, they would be in trouble if they followed me:)|pg||
nt|granguru: no 3NT this time|pg||
nt|sga1: TN collecting IMPs in drops slowly and steadily. :)|pg||
nt|granguru: but 4@H is easy|pg||
nt|suketbombi: mahesh i know that b4 you said|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzhs: players asking football score :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  good sportsmanship|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes very nice by west|pg||
nt|sandip2006: n migt bid 41h|pg||
nt|panja: LTT does not quite apply well here...11 card fit for EW, 10 for NS but 11+8 total tricks, NS will make only 8 playing in @H|pg||
nt|granguru: 12 drops against nil|pg||
nt|granguru: around 2 drops per hand|pg||
nt|sga1: 6 Boards 12 IMPs in all|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|yo_yo: Vahlia might bid 3@H now|pg||
nt|andyv:  we should have a general disclaimer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: multi or balanced?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: keep them updated on scores maybe they play faster?|pg||
nt|panja: to bid or not to bid|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|vugraphzhs: yes sure|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that normal,  it pass 1@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and now they are in game|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok 4 now? |pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: Kista is pretty enterprising...so Venky must be thinking about covering a daring bid with that pass...|pg||
nt|babs59: you know, Chotan's 2NT last hand almost looks better than Kista's this hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|granguru: as the @H are @HJ109 in one hand therecant be a trump promotion here|pg||
nt|sga1: Looks like first game swing for WB as EW playing in 4@s in other room.|pg||
nt|granguru: f.i. @SAK ruff @HQ and @Sruffed by E with a high trump...|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 4@S is an excellent defense |pg||
nt|suketbombi: depends it is matter of when you get in love with your hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  maybe normal but doesn't look right|pg||
nt|sga1: 2@s showed 20-21 with 5@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I'm sure N did not expect to participate in the auction, let alone be the declarer.|pg||
nt|granguru: funny SJ|pg||
nt|xenya: this won't be a success|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andreasw:  the 1@d pass look's okay to me what should he bid|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: well you would have to bid playing any other system|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1NT i suppose|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Vahalia can bid 3@H  because his hand is limited by failure to open strong @C|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i like the pass but then again i would have bid 1@c on S hand|pg||
nt|panja: hi all, this would not be an easy make because of the trump promotion...|pg||
nt|granguru: @SQ was the right play|pg||
nt|sga1: I prefer to play transfer here i.e. 3@h is @s raise and 3@s ask Partner to bid 3NT.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  S is silent once again. with this hand, overcall seems a must|pg||
nt|sybarra: and likely 2 @S makes sense here |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: was thinking of football game :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes. but now beating 3nt looks like a miracle|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like to try to "jam" the auction, E/W got a free pass here |pg||
nt|sga1: so that strong hand plays.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzhs: Hi Panja|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Panja|pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi panja|pg||
nt|panja: Declarer can make by pinning @CT....but that is easier said|pg||
nt|panja: hi Raju, Shirley all|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes but venky here has a reason if u ask him he will tell u he was protecting @CK:)|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, sorry, 3nt is cold here, my wrong view|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: can N find j of spade and her did  but 1 @S, 5 @C and 4 @D...... |pg||
nt|sga1: on a @d lead this could have defeated.|pg||

nt|panja: oh leaving trump in the field|pg||
nt|suketbombi: strange|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kista may not be sure who has the 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: @sk will be 1 down now|pg||
nt|panja: that dbl of 1@H..surely @CQ is more likely to be with E...but N has ignored that clue..|pg||
nt|panja: Kista still not sure about @S situation? or is it about a trump with Venky?|pg||
nt|panja: W hasn't trump echoed....played @H3 and @h8...|pg||
nt|panja: 48 rather|pg||
nt|suketbombi: kista wud take his time but return @S safe an sure he has nothing to kiise here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if his partner has 4 then it's a ruff and sluff|pg||
nt|panja: y, @S seems the best option...but what if Declare had 6@H, 3@D..2@S 2@C>|pg||
nt|panja: then...a @D if W holds @DQ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: would like to thank TCS for sponsoring this tourney|pg||

pc|sK|pc|d4|nt|suketbombi: this is the longest i have seen kissta thinking|pg||
nt|andyv:  somehow, pulling trump by declarer doesn't seem right on this hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to send the Dr. seat belt or super glue |pg||
nt|drkvas: lol|pg||
nt|babs59: 4 off in the other room seems excessive|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: they play precision andreas|pg||
nt|xenya: but possible on a @H lead by S|pg||
nt|babs59: the defence got both spades AND hearts going|pg||
nt|babs59: SK then H switch|pg||
nt|sga1: Defense got 4@h, 3@s and one @d|pg||
nt|babs59: when declarer tried the @SA before @Ds - 8 defensive tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes but AJX was the dummy here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would have bid 1@h with N hand and allow pd to further describe his hand|pg||

mb|1D|nt|yo_yo: michaels cue bid  showing @S and a minor|pg||
nt|panja: hi Anal..|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: hi panja|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  those playing weak/strong michaels might just bid 1@s with this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: red sacs are not easy however |pg||
nt|panja: no easy at this Vul|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i prefer to show a 2 suited hand as South|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you Kath |pg||
nt|panja: N shd bid 4@D and leave it to S to judge the rest|pg||
nt|sybarra: want to get this hand off my chest quickly |pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: difficult now, when East bids again Ariz might take him for a stronger hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: but bidding 1@D has worked OK|pg||
nt|drkvas: sry 6|pg||
nt|granguru: 10s will play roles here|pg||
mb|5D|nt|andyv:  it helps in partnerships to have a firm guideline as to how good or bad your michaels bid can be|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c by EW will have some difficulty with the bad @d break, but 3N should work|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: the Michaels weak or strong (but not inbetween) seems popular|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is a 14 count that is more oriented to defence than to @ss|pg||
nt|panja: I guess they won't venture now...|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt it is N taking the sac if anyone does it will be S |pg||
nt|andyv:  @s shift after this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andreasw:  if they are lucky they will end up in 5@d 11 tricks but this dosen tlook good|pg||
nt|andyv:  E truly falling in love with his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: need to check east hands,,,might be dealt differnt cards :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  but then again 5@d would problebly fail with @s 4-2|pg||
nt|panja: could make on Xruff..|pg||
nt|drkvas: i see only 8 if def correctly|pg||
nt|sga1: E chose to overcall 1@s in other room. Is that right? or that is the style today.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  9 imps to Gujarat on board 28 and they take the lead by one|pg||
nt|panja: note the 2@S bid...it shows Blacks...|pg||
nt|drkvas: good|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: Neither North nor South did enough here imo|pg||
pc|h3|nt|panja: but the trouble is W has only 3 Clubs... |pg||
nt|sga1: The strongest hand W has not taken a bid so far.|pg||
nt|granguru: some minimum chance to win|pg||
nt|granguru: almost nil|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  that was interesting|pg||
nt|drkvas: a small little 6imp swing gujarats  way a bit toolittle too  late|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|panja: after @DA or K, W is going to remove trumps...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|xenya: what happened here?|pg||
nt|babs59: Has Chotan's 5@D bid silenced everyone?|pg||
nt|xenya: not E, who doubled happily|pg||
nt|sga1: Not E who took out his sword.|pg||
nt|babs59: except for Kista, of course|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yo_yo: should Vahalia bid again if his partner can only bid 2@S?|pg||
nt|drkvas: dec not having@s 10 is almost certain|pg||
nt|suketbombi: donno strange :(|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  almost looks like W passed a cue bid but, as Andreas pointed out, @ds are the best contract|pg||
nt|sga1: OR in 4@S likely to make as @S was led.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|andyv:  had to win that trick to have any chance|pg||
nt|drkvas: rt|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: fianls tomorrow at 9.15 am local time...|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: finals|pg||
nt|babs59: more overbid than strange|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h6|nt|sybarra: not much to say here |pg||
nt|sybarra: will scramble home +1 or so |pg||
pc|c2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|suketbombi: on bd 15 i said chotan displayed restraint and all laughed at me infact 5@D was more logical then comapred to this|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|babs59: Kista is also being allowed to avoid any endplay here|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|andreasw:  W did good by passing 4@d|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|panja: With E showing @C as well, it is a double fit for EW....so...4@D by N first time is not excessively risky...|pg||
nt|sga1: scores would be level after this board.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s5|nt|granguru: @C10 was needed|pg||
pc|c5|nt|babs59: now he gets off lead and declarer should lose several spades|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|panja: well..|pg||
nt|xenya: it appears that someone has forgotten the meaning of the double over 1@S overcall|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s6|nt|andyv:  maybe... if it's part of their system, he did... if not then partnership trust can be damaged|pg||
nt|andreasw:  something is wrong|pg||

pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: ah yes they used blackwood on 29|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|granguru: is a much better bid than pass as if, as it is probable, he needs to ruff @H in dummy E cant overruff|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andreasw:  and N open'd 4@s not 1@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 29, in OR, S inquired about the Q@s thru rkc and stopped at 5@s when N didn't have it|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sfoxa:  practical approach, especially when partner is known as "passer"|pg||
nt|sybarra: could have made more with hopping ace and playing low spade to j, and back |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wouldnt like to open 4@S with A,K,A|pg||
nt|andyv:  bad luck, as Kath says, cost 13 imps (unless you are on Gujarat team)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  for me it is a clear 1@s bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't mind 1 or 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru: I sould say it is impossible to beat the hand if declarer takes out trumps|pg||
nt|granguru: would*|pg||
nt|granguru: on the other hand a black suit move is risky|pg||
nt|sga1: yes|pg||
nt|granguru: as they are both freezed|pg||
nt|babs59: there could even be an explanation like he saw the 2S bid as from South not West|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: can n/s untangle this now?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 10@S suspicious?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kista should have gone for the @S|pg||
nt|granguru: meaning that the one who moves them gives away a trick|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|drkvas: the bds are ticking by n guj losing further ground|pg||

nt|sga1: New leader like after this Board|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  in 2/1, the hand is a 4@s bid as 1@s followed by 4@s is a much stronger (in hcps) hand|pg||

nt|sybarra: and a claim coming up I would think |pg||
nt|babs59: and Chotan's @d9 asked for a heart too, I expect (last hand)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|drkvas: andyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did "we go down" |pg||
pc|d4|pc|h9|nt|suketbombi: yes the last hand @D9 was yelling|pg||
pc|h8|nt|babs59: whereas in the other room, on winning DQ, Sridhar tried a club back - now easy for declarer|pg||

nt|andyv:  they took too many tricks, partner|pg||
nt|drkvas: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: will have a century lead by the end of this segment|pg||
nt|granguru: so with xxx they lead middle then low|pg||
nt|sga1: Lost one IMP shud have played @c before @d J.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|andyv:  and ty Kath and Andreas for being here.  And of course, ty to all the specs for joining us.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: unless 3NT is on!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: 14 more in 3 boards for a century|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: and thx again, Mahesh:)  |pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think I'd do anything that was remotely dangerous if I were NS today... like crossing a street...|pg||
nt|sybarra: hardly matters at the end of the day |pg||
nt|drkvas: naughty u|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ns likely to get to 2@Hs here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and certainly do NOT go to a casino |pg||
nt|andyv:  :))|pg||
nt|drkvas: it does the looser can have a drink more because u have a lot more to discuss:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have had days like this havent you?|pg||
nt|andyv:  N probably wondering when S will find his suit this set|pg||
nt|drkvas: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: only 2 bds to go  |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: no casino's in Chennai... nearest is Sri LANKA|pg||
nt|sybarra: so not many more chances |pg||
nt|andyv:  If you have played enough bridge, you have had a lot of days like this|pg||
mb|1N|nt|drkvas: if not suit atleast shirt:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: thanks everyone |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Thank You Kath|pg||
nt|sybarra: lucky them no casinos |pg||
nt|granguru: it is annoying to see the script dissappearing in some instances|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: the other room reached 2@H  after 1NT  2@C (Majors)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|sybarra: doubt N really wants to sit with 1 point |pg||
nt|yo_yo: good job mahesh, i know it's not easy|pg||
nt|andreasw:  thx everyone has been great|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh dear  are they getting too high?|pg||
nt|granguru: EW went -2 on the OR|pg||
nt|sga1: Because of comp EW climbed to 3@s.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: i tht that:(|pg||
pc|c7|nt|granguru: third time the text goes to nowhere|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  does 16-18NT make W hand worth an invite?|pg||
nt|panja: I need to logoff, thx all, bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: bye|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sunsamvar: I have great hopes for the Kista Venky pair..|pg||
nt|andreasw:  only 2 imp's diffrent|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will shift to @D 7 still hard to get 7 tricks for def|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: thy may go +1 here |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I can certainly understand playing 3 as white v white (not vul) |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Venky is very steady, conservative and does not give anything away and should compliment Kista's brilliance very well|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzhs: 4@d 1 down board yet to be played in open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: board 33|pg||
nt|granguru: I want to say that 3@H or even 4@H would have been a rather normal contract|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: right andy,  just need the "experience"  (some days nothing right) |pg||
nt|drkvas: yes andy more days like this than the otherway round for me atleast:(|pg||
nt|sga1: Here simple and quiet bidding.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  plus for W are the 10s... minus is the fact that hand is full of quacks and no distribution.... you might invite only because of the vul.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Ariz cant get to hand for @S finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: what I love about the jrs  (as a rule)  the are just living thru and laugh a lot |pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  we remember these days more vividly:)|pg||
nt|sga1: absolutely.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|granguru: as the distribution of the suit is terrible, no way to win such a contract here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yo_yo: he might try another Rabbi's finesse|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|sybarra: ?|pg||
nt|xenya: impossible i think -- they are just setting up 7th trick for declarer|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yo_yo: for those who dont know the rabbi's finesse is dropping the singleton King offside|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: not that he was unable to do it himself|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y cannot beat this nt tho 3@CS 2@DS & a@H is best defence can get|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ....|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: Sunil we have also seen the "personalities" of N/S  |pg||
nt|sybarra: club pls,  did the 7 of @H ask for that?|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems many jrs.  just think this is part of learning   |pg||
pc|s6|pc|c6|pg||
nt|drkvas: the score sheet does not reflect the capabilities of ns both are very fine players this is one of those days|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s3|nt|sybarra: N befing much more agressive,  and S being the more conservative one of the pair |pg||
nt|andyv:  2/1 odds on that play |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: needs the hook I think |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s5|pc|d4|nt|sga1: Now makes 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Shirley or shd it be bYE Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I will leave after this hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: so bye |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Thanks and bye Shirley|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Kerala is a swing team... wud not be suprised to see huge exchange of IMPS in the 3rd session|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx and great fun,  good luck rest  |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: last seg of q/f will resume in 10 mins|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Great work Mahesh|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: has he gone to Sleep ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: ill go to sleep soon|pg||
nt|yo_yo: "Play the Ace when the King is a singleton".   The creator of the Rabbi's Rule is Milton Shattner, appropriately nicknamed the Rabbi.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|sga1: Push|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|andyv:  he did.. his play only works if E held AKx of @hs|pg||
mc|7|nt|andreasw:  a small would have been right|pg||
nt|suketbombi: does not have the claim button there|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile, 2@H in the other room went down -- 5 imps to the trailing team|pg||
