mb|p|nt|joest:  it's a long way back to 4@h from here|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|joest:  not clear what Mouser should do first round.  pass certainly reasonable.  If he reasons that partner has diamond shortness, he might bid 2@h just so he doesn't get completely frozen out|pg||

nt|sharynr: what do you think East should bid, George|pg||
nt|sharynr: would you risk a 2@h bid|pg||

nt|sharynr: me too|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mittmouse: with the right s guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  may not need guess if they don't switch to @s|pg||

mb|3H|nt|mittmouse: wd |pg||

nt|mittmouse: s deserves this to happen he should bid 2s and now they are out of the auction|pg||
mb|4D|nt|fabsayc: richter's pass of 2@D made this relatively easy|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|mittmouse: perhaps n should bid 4c originally then s has an easy 5c bid|pg||

mb|1S|nt|joest:  as would I quite frankly|pg||
nt|joest:  3@c is one of many type raises|pg||
nt|joest:  artificial|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  worst is a mixed raise.  Best case is balanced 12 or 13 with three card support|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mittmouse: quite a pass by smith |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|andyv:  his hand is going down in value with each bid|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|joest:  for 0-1 controls, Weinstein has a moose|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yuck, not a good hand for kokish|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|henryb:  I have two questions: why not 7@h and how did he make only 6?|pg||
nt|joest:  Well Henry I cannot answer question  1|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  I can answer  2|pg||
nt|joest:  he claimed 980 at trick one|pg||
nt|henryb:  Can you answer question 2?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: table taking a break|pg||
nt|joest:  btw, I think Weinstein Garner would do great to reach 7@h|pg||
nt|joest:  one problem is that at this moment Garner doesn't know what trumps is|pg||
nt|joest:  another: how to diagnose the doubleton spade in Weinstein's hand, not to mention BOTH black doubletons|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is the problem with Kokish: the hand is much easier to bid after  ... 2@h-3@h|pg||
nt|joest:  not to mention that partner has four trumps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and the four needed trumps|pg||
nt|joest:  on this hand yes I agree henry|pg||
nt|henryb:  heart hands are generally better off without Kokish: responder gets to show values and trump support early|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i saw one table where this hand was claimed on ruffing spade finesse, to make only 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: have NS agreed a suit yet?   seems like N also bids 4C if 5-card spades and stiff heart...|pg||
nt|joest:  right Joanna    There are so many balls up in the air right now it is hard to see reaching 7@h with confidence|pg||
mb|4D|nt|fabsayc: 4@D by south (sort of waiting), then 5@H by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  5@h if you are absolutely positively sure it is forcing|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not know. North might also bid 4@c with a club suit and no git for either major|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Howard pulls out a bid and puts it back|pg||
nt|joest:  I think you're out of luck with that hand henry|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|joest:  Let's see |pg||
nt|fabsayc: double suit blackwood?|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|joest:  what is my response to RKCB witha void when I don't know what trumps are?|pg||
nt|henryb:  what would you do with xx/x/xxx/Kxxxxxx|pg||
nt|mildredb: some now play that over Kokish the 1st 2 steps are flip flop - for this very reason|pg||
nt|joest:  I think it is double RKCB here|pg||
nt|joest:  that's a good treatment Mildred.  With that responder could fix spades right now with 3@s and anything else is for hearts|pg||
nt|joest:  never heard of that but it is excellent|pg||
nt|joest:  in double roman, how does one show five key cards plus a void?|pg||
nt|joest:  trust me.  Garner and Weinstein are in uncharted waters again|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bid 7@C|pg||
nt|joest:  a familiar place for them this round :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: 3C= @H; 3@D= @H +@S; 3@H=@C & 3@S=@D over the 2@S bid|pg||

nt|joest:  5NT maybe was a warning|pg||
nt|fabsayc: surely shows a void|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Weinstein wants to alert more to his screenmate before the lead|pg||
nt|mildredb: does N know where the void is?|pg||
nt|joest:  if he does he will need to tell me how.  Probably b/c he has long diamonds he is guessing itis there|pg||
nt|joest:  i do believe there is some guesswork going on|pg||
nt|henryb:  if partner has odd key cards. probably yes|pg||

nt|mittmouse: hard to avoid bidding a slam here|pg||

nt|joest:  this should go quickly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Aker: I did open 2H with hand even when I was 16|pg||

mb|p|nt|poohbear: maybe 3@s asked for shortness|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mittmouse: they must not play 2-1 gf otherwise why would he not bid 2nt|pg||
nt|poohbear: and 4@h denied|pg||
nt|mittmouse: if he bids 7 now he would be looking at the hand records|pg||
nt|poohbear: 7 might not be worse than a @s hook if North has 5 black cards only|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or the score|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is getting to swing time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 3@s is slam interest with shortness|pg||

nt|poohbear: limit or mixed?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Bergen 4 trumps   6-9 HCP|pg||
