nt|sybarra: well some of us will only put in comments when "approprate"   |pg||
nt|idc: OR played last hand in 4@s, so just an IMP swing|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Ew play Acol with a weak NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Results available on www.sbuwest.co.uk/SeniorCamrosehtml|pg||
mb|3N|nt|idc: The format here is 6 teams (including England 2, the sponsor's team)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20 hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: c@c a fair contract |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 6@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: only requires club break|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: They play each other twice over the weekend, two 14 board matches v each other team|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: some might have ventured in with north if system allows|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an easy one to reach tho|pg||
nt|sybarra: so how do most of play the X agst the 2 @d ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @d= lolng major is my guess |pg||
nt|lestergold: however i sense a 3N coming on|pg||
nt|lark20: Paul plays it for penalties|pg||
nt|sybarra: "dashing" into 3 nt now?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they wont go under slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland would be dashing into 6@c|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yo_yo: i think that's a range probe|pg||
pc|d2|nt|idc: Scotland are the holders of the Senior Camrose - I'll try to mention that a lot before tomorrow, since I doubt it will be true afterwards :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: obviously Peter doesnt mind the 2 doubletons for his NT opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: 32 points and an 8 card fit they should get there|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: think I will just as soon defend |pg||
nt|rednaxela: Welcome back everyone.  I suspect our operator is catching us up with events so far!|pg||
nt|lestergold: in theory that is|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that was commentators curse |pg||
pc|c4|nt|cuttysark: Patrick Jourdain is a Camrose veteran: he has won the Camrose playing for Scotland when he was here for a brief spell, but usually represents Wales|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Gareth Jones also plays Camrose for Wales, usually with son dafydd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: any actual residence requirement?|pg||
nt|idc: Well, we seem to be back|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome all to Scotland v Ireland in the 8th match of 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: for both andreas and Mike |pg||
nt|lestergold: i predcited 3N a long time ago|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cuttysark: Indeed - a 2 year residence requirement, during which time you cannot play for any other country|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s do well in a diamond contract|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzjc: 2H denies a major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure why Jean wanted to know the range but I am sure the Mackenzies are pleased to know|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|idc: Our operators have managed to get the results for board 17 into the system while we had technical problems|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sybarra: brb all,   need to take neighbor to taxi  (she is invalid)   |pg||
pc|c7|nt|andreasw:  i think 3nt nt is a wery weak bid from hackett if he dosent like his hand he could at least invit to slam|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thats to bed with A@h|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rednaxela: N/S playing a safe 3NT.  6@c would have good play on a non-diamond lead.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: This is round 8 of 10 in the Senior Camrose.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cuttysark: That is a fine lead from Price - reckons he will never establihs his own suit so may as well look for partner's|pg||

nt|sybarra: and a bunch of extra tricks |pg||
nt|idc: Guess it needs a @h lead and @d switch, not a defence that is possible to find|pg||
nt|lestergold: someone keeps dealing 20/20 hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah thanks christine, i was an operator a few weeks ago, not easy|pg||
mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: but full credit to a thoughtful lead|pg||
nt|idc: They are fine as long as there is some shape to the hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|lestergold: 4@h on for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Not clear that the diamonds were 5-3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so just confirming, the last hand was 2 down?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: -2|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: these are only "mildly" shapey |pg||
nt|sybarra: will W sit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w do no0t want to get too high here in spades|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And 6 imps to N ireland who stayed in 3@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C is multi landy, showing both majors|pg||
nt|yo_yo: (not sure if that promises 5/4 )|pg||
nt|lestergold: was 2@h forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Everyone and their dog is playing weak major/minor 2M openings these days|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: South opened a Multi in the other room, so North is playing 2@H|pg||
nt|idc: NS here play 15-17 NT and 5 card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: EW are 11-14 NT and a 5 card spade suit opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Heart lead in the other room did not trouble declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is the explanation of this auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: N in the other room did well to hold to -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: -2|pg||
nt|idc: West hand is worth something between 2.25 and 2.51 @s according to my made-up-odds system|pg||
nt|lestergold: shoud be able m to scramble 9 tricks on cross ruff ines|pg||
pc|h2|nt|idc: opposite a protective dbl it isn't quite as good|pg||
pc|h9|nt|idc: The 1NT was alerted, no doubt it is wide range, from 6-11 (no more since he is a passed hand)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cuttysark: I suspect this double by the passed hand showed a major and a minor, or some such thing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: south says he should have atleast 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: it does look rather odd to choose the 4-2 fit rather than the 5-3 :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok, this convention perhaps should remain nameless|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: there are hazards but declarer should get out for the loss of 2 hearts and 2 spades|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Agree that 3@S is a bit optimistic|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: 15-17 NT when vulnerable|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: without 2@s by east would harper have bid 31H?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|idc: West was thinking of c!K to retain a @c entry to dummy for diamond ruffs|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yo_yo: both the Welsh ladies represented Wales a few weeks ago in the Lady Milne|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The 'someone has blundered' defence to 1NT - it is becoming more popular|pg||
nt|fabsayc: meanwhile defense has had many opportunites to lead trumps|pg||
nt|idc: A @c switch (or the @sK) would have worked well there|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h7|nt|yo_yo: good to see the ladies playing |pg||
nt|yo_yo: not for the english teams though :9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or scots|pg||
nt|rednaxela: J@c would have been best.  A small one could have been ducked to East.|pg||
nt|idc: But @h was the natural continuation, though declarer now has time to set up @d|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: hm... drWING TRUMPS DOES NOT SEEM TO BE BEST HERE|pg||

mb|2H|nt|cuttysark: Waterlow did rather well to make 10 tricks in the other room - won't like losing an imp for his pains :)|pg||

nt|lestergold: whatever hackett bids now they will play in spades|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzjc: 20-22|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Ah - if it had been 19-20 they could play there, but even the 2-level looks rather high|pg||

nt|sybarra: most difficult form of the game (imo)|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Well, well!|pg||

nt|lestergold: Hi Ian|pg||
nt|lark20: Hi you are lucky!|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I must admit I would be a 2@c bidder - trusting that partner would expect a decent hand from me vulnerable at the 2 level.|pg||
nt|lestergold: not sure i liked Rae's overcall of 1N|pg||
nt|idc: The @s position is favourable for declarer but just one too many losers overall|pg||

nt|sybarra: imp is an imp |pg||
nt|idc: some shape at last - but still 20-20|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A guddly partscore as we say in Scotland (well we don't really) |pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|lestergold: 4@H form N/S looks makeable as cards lie|pg||
nt|idc: I wonder if NS have a bid for this sort of hand|pg||
nt|idc: Scotland -500 in that 4@h X contract in OR - they will be surprised to learn that gains they 3 IMPs|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s can make game in either major as cards lie|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: i prefer double to the 1N overcall in open room|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: if you hear pard clubs you can bid dims showing your hand|pg||
nt|idc: I guess they don't play transfer after the dbl for example - nice to be able to show good raise|pg||
nt|idc: or perhaps that *did* show a good raise?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@H strikes me as an appropriate shot with south's hand knowing that any club honours with north likey  to be well placed|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: this feels like it should make|pg||
nt|idc: NS CC just says raises are preemptive after dbl|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks infrangible in spite of the result we see in the open|pg||
nt|idc: I wouldn't expect a hand as good as North's in a million years on that sequence|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike, you are killing us with the big words today |pg||
nt|lestergold: north shouldhave bid 3@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps south knows his customer|pg||
nt|idc: agree Mike and even then I'd worry I was too good|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i would not go that far!|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think too good for 3 @H's |pg||
nt|lestergold: checkback i assume |pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: its flattish an A and K what else can you bid Shirley|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Surprised?  They'll be banking on it.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: No heart overcall in the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: another option is XX and raise (not my favo) |pg||
nt|lestergold: an unlucky spot for n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: every card spitting viciously|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: jack|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: this is ok too|pg||
nt|rodal f: But wich black hook after 1@H?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Decalrer has to guess which black suit to finesse - rather like an earlier hand he got wrong. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Rather him than me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he first has to play his queen|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they fiind the 4/4 fit|pg||
nt|lark20: very fortunate lie of the spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a great contract less than 50% but makes today|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i dont think anything makes for n/s|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: redouble sorry not in my book|pg||

nt|rednaxela: And the shape just keeps on coming!|pg||
nt|lestergold: a stunning misfit here|pg||
nt|lestergold: a roland favourite hand type here|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: in the context of the close match, that was an avalanche of IMPs|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjc: fit jump|pg||
nt|lestergold: jump fit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: Combined 26 count where you want to stop in 1NT. Fortunately it will be flat in game going down|pg||
nt|lestergold: a favourite device with the hackett family|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 5@h the limit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: dashing to 1 nt again |pg||
nt|idc: South hand too weak for 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 2 @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: note that north here responds with a terible 5 count vulnerable too boot|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|cuttysark: Horrible start for Wales - but there are 8 boards to go. They need to dig in|pg||
nt|sybarra: it this another avalanche|pg||
nt|idc: the first time, I'm as surprised as Shirley we didn't see it the 2nd time|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would ahve passed personally|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even a heart lead is not enough - if he had led @HQ, now...|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 8 tricks looks the limit here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: with N|pg||
nt|cuttysark: leading low from this sort of holding may cost a trick: leading an honour may give up the whole suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: will Ken make a try here?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: yes |pg||
nt|rednaxela: Good stop.|pg||
nt|lestergold: conservative pard could eqasily hold a one loser heart suit and ace of clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: however wont argue with success|pg||
nt|lestergold: however nothing keeping e/w from 4@s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rednaxela: Ken Rae lives in Shetland, which is further north than Oslo or Stockholm, making him one of the more northerly internationalists outside Iceland.|pg||

nt|lestergold: a festering pile of jacks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cuttysark: Wales needs to bid this slam just to avoid losing more imps. England 2 playing really well|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am probably bidding 1 sp,   |pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: the point is west did cooperate once|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Agreed. The man with the aces should take charge|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cuttysark: England 2 need 39 imps for a maximum 25 VP; Wales need to lose by fewer than 67 to avoid a zero|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: when he has a mopnster he would bid game and go off not thanking his partner for responding on a quarter of a trick|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Club lead beats 4@H, but not easy for North to find that|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|idc: In the OR, the auction was interesting: West passed over 3@d then backed in with a game bid|pg||

nt|cuttysark: To misquote edgar Kaplan: double is a good call on this hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: I don't know if Es 1@H prommice 5 cards. If it's 4 card opening W have for a support X and not 2@H.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I expect there is a way to let it through - ducking aces has been a feature of the tournament :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: yes i saw a spectacular one yesterday|pg||
nt|rednaxela: If his partner's K@S had been the A@H he might have done the right thing.|pg||
