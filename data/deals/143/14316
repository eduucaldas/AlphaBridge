nt|idc: Ok, a quiet 1@d is over and you only had to suffer one of my 'jokes'|pg||
nt|idc: we can all pray for a more interesting hand here|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Stopping in 3NT seems a little unambitious.|pg||
nt|jtr: Nothing seems to be making this set|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@s was a good spot|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcomyn: ah an intrestinghand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: 5H + 5other|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: Club switch needed but maybe that's not too difficult. Wasn't for Gerrard|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: East should try to put down a better dummy next time :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: should be but aint|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lark20: 4H surely better|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|idc: Another 19 count 2NT (though one or both may play it as 19-21 of course)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jtr: They wont reach game here|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: often 5/4 at green |pg||
nt|golfsquash: coffe time, 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|golfsquash: ee|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|rednaxela: I'm guessing this must be a Weak NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: 3D = max 4d's likely not 4c's|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the defender's major suits lie pretty favourably for 6NT|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks Christine, that's useful info|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: Waterlow explaining VS made slam try 16 + he accepted it but VS decided not to on|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rednaxela: I would have thought that 2@d followed by 3@d would get East's hand across.|pg||
nt|idc: It looks like Victor Silverstone tried for a 4-4 @c fit as a slam try, ignoring the weak 4 card @h suit|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|galadriel: Yes, he might have tried 3|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Pass is rather timid with a 6 card suit opposite a take out double.|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is also a good stop - and in addition a good lead from Paterson|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think N/S play 5cM but Holland chose to open a tactical 4 card 1@S in 3rd (non vul obv)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: draw 2 rounds of trumps and set about the @D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Englands score is about to soar,  4@S  on board 7 about to make|pg||
pc|s9|nt|idc: I don't mind shading a little for decent 19 counts, but what often happens is people start shading 18 counts too|pg||
nt|jtr: phew|pg||
pc|s7|nt|idc: That's not an unreasonable way to do it|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|galadriel: Yes, I like that too - lead directing|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|idc: So I guess we've had a puppet Stayman sequence and East is declarer|pg||
nt|jtr: They can beat 3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rednaxela: It looks like weak NT was in use in both rooms.  This is the sort of hand where having one pair playing 14-16 guarantees you a swing - of some sort.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: I'm not trying to argue, by the way, that 6NT is a thing of beauty.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|idc: It isn't a great 6NT; even @s coming in for 4 tricks leaves you with some work still to do|pg||
nt|jtr: this way|pg||

pc|h9|nt|jtr: Very well done|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Excellent defence|pg||
pc|hT|nt|idc: The play would have been more interesting that in 3NT, so commentators like contracts like 6NT here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rednaxela: E/W making the most of their trumps, but declarer will be okay.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: no, 7 was flat after all|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|idc: In OR, East played 3NT and played SOuth for @sQ|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|idc: Interesting with the @sT falling from North on 1st round of suit|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c3|nt|rednaxela: He will ruff the Club good.|pg||

nt|idc: Colin SImpson couldn't tell how the @d suit was lying - South could have had 4, 5 or 6 of them|pg||
nt|rednaxela: It's not just that E/W have 32 points but holding all the Aces and all the Kings they have a lot of flexibility about to play the hand.  At least it is quicker this way.|pg||
nt|jtr: Easy slam Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, cold as ice|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: The boards have been quiet|pg||
nt|jtr: Or is it?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: So England 1 back in the match now - 5 IMPs behind with 5 boards to go|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, it will get a heart lead|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rednaxela: The players have tended towards the conservative.|pg||
nt|copeyj: N/S do play 4cM - here is a link to their convention card from their W Ch'ship win in Sao Paolo|pg||
nt|copeyj: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/seniorsbowl/england/hallberg-holland.pdf|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah right:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: Since this applies to both sides it could be described, liberally, as a conservative coalition.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Cheers|pg||
nt|idc: 3 or 4 for SOuth now?|pg||
nt|jtr: Or @dA?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|galadriel: Aaahhh Alex - nice one|pg||
nt|copeyj: I would not consider X with the E hand here|pg||
nt|copeyj: the opps have the boss suit, I have nothing, and partner has passed my opening bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|idc: One of my favourite conventions - the good/bad 2NT - would help there: 3@h would be a game try|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yo_yo: 6@C on a finesse which succeeds|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Missed in the other rom|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is a decent vulnerable game |pg||
nt|idc: 10 IMPs to England on hand 8 - agressive weak 2@h got N-S to 4-3 @s fit instead of 3NT|pg||
nt|jtr: It would be nteresting if West had one more @s and one less @d|pg||
nt|Walddk4: lol Victor did indeed lead a heart against 6@S in the othrer room. That's Gerrard's 12th trick and a huge swing to Scotland|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow|pg||
nt|jtr: They take the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Gerrard did not show his hearts in the OR|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's different here, Paterson won't lead one|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: So, the first double figure swing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or Short for that matter|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|idc: and 2NT followed by 3@h is just competitive|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but 4-0 breaks are unpleasdant at slam level|pg||
nt|yo_yo: always galling when you arent in it and the other side are|pg||
pc|c4|nt|golfsquash: 6@c may be better than the finesse, as the spade may go on the diamond and other suits might break kindly.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Strange, in Denmark West was on lead, now it's East. Well, that's what you get when you move I suppose :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rednaxela: Yes, a little bit worse than a finesse - worth being in.|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S in the other room was "wet" to say the least|pg||
nt|copeyj: vulnerable you owe partner a good raise |pg||
nt|copeyj: even nv you owe a good raise|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: especiallyh offside|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|idc: the Lucas 2 from Lewis/Collins I meant|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|copeyj: just have to show what you have|pg||
nt|galadriel: Definitely|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Yes, looks like an easy cue bid in the other room.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: East is marked with the points, but also with Spade shortage, so the finesse is no certainty.|pg||
nt|copeyj: the finesse on this auction is basically a certainty - 90+% I would say|pg||
nt|copeyj: I suppose E could have void @S to justify the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They also drive on the wrong side of the road here|pg||
nt|babs59: It's not wrong or right - it's left or right Roland :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, remember to look right Roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: OK left then, and that''s not right|pg||
nt|babs59: But they queue really well|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Mike and Barbara|pg||
nt|jtr: No right is right especially with those big red things around|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: two mays and a might rory dont sound good|pg||
nt|idc: Same bidding in both rooms this hand; same result or possibly an overtrick IMP here seems likely|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: hello Roland Barbara and David|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|copeyj: declarer is not home yet|pg||
nt|idc: If I couldn't make a try, I think I'd just blast 4@h - vul at teams would be too tempting|pg||
nt|jtr: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|babs59: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|babs59: It's now Monday here - so I'll say bye instead|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: lead out of turn|pg||
nt|jtr: Hi Barbara|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: N played a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: E accepted it and played the 8@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: but N took his back|pg||
nt|jtr: Quite right|pg||
nt|lestergold: I see u are in disguise Roland|pg||
nt|jtr: Would have been better defence if he didnt have it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: director called and checking the rules|pg||
nt|jtr: You see, if West had the 2@ss the contract can make|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems in the other room declarer ran into problems in the trump suit after all|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah, maybe he doesnt have the entries|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jtr: ah declarer squandered the @s9 next door|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|rednaxela: Still some work to do.  Declarer can't simply draw trumps and ruff his losers.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: This isn't the sort of hand England 2 need.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|idc: no overtrick after that trump play|pg||
pc|s9|nt|idc: For England 2, I think a decent win here is essential if they are to catch England|pg||
pc|s6|nt|copeyj: he can take a @H finesse (@HT) for his 10th trick|pg||
nt|copeyj: i wonder what line he is going to take|pg||
nt|copeyj: there are choices|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think East is marked with a @H suit|pg||
nt|jtr: Got overruffed in @hs|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|golfsquash: ok, 6@c is better than 50%.|pg||
nt|idc: Northern Ireland still have an outside chance, but they would need to defeat England big when they play their head-to-head match|pg||
nt|rednaxela: on the other hand, if England 1 put on a good finish they could be almost uncatchable.|pg||
nt|jtr: He is trying to ruff the @c i guess|pg||

mb|p|nt|galadriel: Holland presumably showing a minimum|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Again, the teams are avoiding swings by playing similar methods.|pg||

nt|lestergold: i think o a push|pg||
nt|jtr: East has little option|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjc: and 3 keycards|pg||
nt|idc: In OR last hand, Hallberg/Holland seemed to have some systemic way for SOuth to invite opposite a @h overcall|pg||
pc|s2|nt|idc: though it did aid them that East didn't interfere with 2@s as happened here|pg||

nt|yo_yo: win and take the @H finess, then what?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: East is allowed ( and should ) think at trick 1|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Hard to know if you want the major suit finesses to win or lose|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but the more he thinks the more Michael will think he has K@D|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|idc: England 1 were 7 VPs ahead of England 2 going into this match, so any win at all for them will stretch them away|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: To my mind that is not worth 4@d but the two learned players in the East seats disagree with me.|pg||

pc|d4|nt|idc: I say too high, but 2 of the 3 finesses working might be enough for 6@s, so not unreasonable slam|pg||

nt|golfsquash: This is a good game, down on the bad trump break.|pg||
nt|idc: You could argue that any hand with 6 cards hearts would either have bid earlier or wouldn't bid 3@h now|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Waterlow knows his partner.|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|rednaxela: The problem is that 4@d commits you to game.  If you have hit partner's strength in a minimum hand then he knows he doesn't want to be in game but has no option.|pg||

nt|lark20: No harm done|pg||
nt|idc: Yup, North's QT of @h meant 3@h played quite well, and more IMPs to ENgland 1|pg||
nt|rednaxela: 2 boards to go and a bit of action.|pg||
nt|idc: We may get our wish for some interesting boards as this match reaches the last two hands|pg||
nt|jtr: Now a good slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: normal auction to a normal spot|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|idc: There's a minor flaw somewhere in the OR auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for u this slam Roland|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rednaxela: I sense that the spectators are about 70-30 against me on this!|pg||
mb|2C|nt|copeyj: it's not like game didnt have play here - it was poor but had play|pg||
nt|rednaxela: It was a counting to 5 problem.|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: For info: the 6 teams (5 countries + England 2, the sponsor's team) play a double round-robin of 14 board matches|pg||
nt|idc: so 10 matches over the weekend, this is match 7 so 3 left today|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: Hi, everyone.|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome Alex|pg||
nt|cuttysark: jolly quick play in the Open Room|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rednaxela: Holland was quite right to show his Diamonds, but may now be worried that they may have missed a spade fit.|pg||
nt|idc: Similar sequences, with both South players bravely pushing the boat out with 4@s|pg||
nt|rednaxela: This is one of these hands where no-one is quite sure who is making and who is saving.|pg||
nt|rednaxela: silverstone going very quietly.  I must admit I would have fancied something more constructive than 4@h on the previous round.|pg||
nt|idc: North is rehearsing arguements for 3 bids: pass, 5@c & 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: Blackwood as much easier in the old days when you only had to count up to 4.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|idc: Note that Lewis in OR splintered with 4@d - quite a fruity effort with that West hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: W 'you talked me out of it'|pg||
nt|jtr: 3NT now and North must find a move|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rednaxela: Yes, no messing about.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|idc: I've had to do the setup lines & punchlines for my 'jokes' ALex, so be kind to the specs, they have suffered|pg||
mb|p|nt|rednaxela: Now for the diamond ruff.|pg||
nt|idc: Declarer onloy has 3 losers, but trump position too fragile to expect to make this|pg||
nt|lestergold: and he did|pg||
nt|jtr: Well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Also the upside is that they can get you to a great slam with limited values, if partner has no values there|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: 5@C in the other room|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rednaxela: Well 456 of them have stuck it out.  Well done everyone!|pg||
nt|rednaxela: It's hard being a one man double act.|pg||
nt|idc: The second half of this match has been all one-way traffic so far|pg||
pc|c6|nt|idc: The bidding doesn't scream South is 4-7 in his 2 suits, not easy for East to give @d ruff|pg||
nt|rednaxela: would also work if South was 6-4.|pg||
nt|idc: This play to last trick is a clue though - if SOuth had 5 spades why not ruff the @h|pg||
nt|idc: But with the fragile 4-3 fit, forcing declarer will result in defeat anyway|pg||
nt|idc: the @d ruff isn't necessary|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: he is deep in thought|pg||
nt|idc: not a trump mind you but I'd be amazed if that is what Tony is thinking of|pg||
nt|idc: joankenny makes a good point - Victor could have played a high @h last trick to ask for a @d ruff|pg||
nt|idc: the h!Q for preference|pg||
nt|rednaxela: True.  Would South throw any Club other than a singleton?  i think that the distribution must be becoming clear.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjc: half pulled out a club|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|copeyj: better in my view to play 1@H-3@S as any singleton splinter, then partner can ask if interested in better things, and if its a game only hand youy dont give the opening leader any ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: inforrmation about where the single is|pg||
nt|idc: nice: if declarer ruffs this he may be going lots down|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: well essentially this slam is about 75%|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice auction here notwithstanding what 2@h meant|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe a semi +ve|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|rednaxela: This is turning into a chunky swing.|pg||
nt|idc: If South had 2 @s honours in hand & 1 in dummy it would be much better for him|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems to show some values - the key was to appreciate the value of the clubs|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|idc: as it is, if he ruffs low in dummy later the trump suit is blocked & he can't draw trumps|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|idc: and he can't afford to ruff high in dummy|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|lestergold: well bid Price says i hav values but no aces so it has to be a good shot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Rae did all he could at the other table I think, but it was not enough for Gerrard|pg||

nt|idc: 28 IMPs to England 1 - but just a glimmer of hope offered here if they can reach 6@h|pg||
nt|rednaxela: A chance for the Sponsor's team to limit the damage.|pg||
nt|idc: 28 IMPs would be 22-8 in VPs|pg||
nt|idc: well, I can understand East doing that but West perhaps might have done better|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Completely.  Always glad to see a way to beat a contract.|pg||

mb|1H|nt|copeyj: 3 boards left|pg||

mb|1S|nt|rednaxela: This is the last board of the match, Seniors being deemed not to have the stamina ofr 16 board sets.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|idc: Declarer just needed to set up a long @d in the OR, but look at what happens after a @h lead instead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|galadriel: NS got a bit high in the other room|pg||
nt|idc: it can still be made, but declarer must play for red suit squeeze|pg||
nt|cuttysark: After several hours of analysis, I can tell you that it makes on the squeeze..|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk4: http://www.sbuwest.co.uk/SeniorCamroseResults.html  for results and standings|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rednaxela: K@s looks like a pretty normal lead, though not necessarily the winning one!|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome to Liz - and now I can boast that after 20 secs of analysis, I agree :)|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose England2 now have a theoretical chance of finishing 1st|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If the margin remains 26 imps the result will be 21-9, bringing England 2 to 155. But England have 181|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah not enough then|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks better played in a major part score here|pg||
mb|4C|nt|cuttysark: 2NT = weak raise/ Or is it a psyche :)|pg||
nt|rednaxela: A pragmatic but unsuccessful bid by Priday.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5C|nt|cuttysark: (He's so clever)|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Thank you everybody, esepcially the commentators who stepped into the breach|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Next set at 13.05 BST|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|rednaxela: In the old days, opening opposite opening bid equalled game values. |pg||
nt|rednaxela: I expect this makes too.  the clock is ticking, Ian.|pg||
nt|idc: That @hJ in the North hand is key - threat in @h needs to be in North hand|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: problem with east bidding stayman is they would probably get too high|pg||
nt|jtr: East was very conservative but maybe 1NT was 14-16|pg||
nt|lestergold: a heaviliy duplicated hand|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|idc: since @d guard is over the @d threat in the South hand|pg||
nt|jtr: ah ty Stuart|pg||
pc|hK|nt|galadriel: True - although as opening bids get lighter, allowances have to be made|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Unless you can play them like the Italians.|pg||
nt|copeyj: I would imagine generally Holland-Hallberg play a solid opening style - Hallberg is well known in England for passing hands most of us mere mortals consider routine openers|pg||
