nt|yo_yo: yes good for them!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: like these claims as operator:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: easy to get carried away by that lovely south hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do they play strong NT?|pg||
nt|andyv:  precision|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if so  here it comes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's the range?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: e/w nt 14-15...n/s 15-17|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand looks NTish no matter what the range is|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y es ok 6 imps and west bengal B is now in lead|pg||
nt|wygbe1: south would have to suppress his major, which is reasonable given the secondary cards and spots in the other suits|pg||
nt|drkvas: a quite start last set started with a grand slam:)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yo_yo: ty mahesh|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: 6 @D might be more likely |pg||
nt|yo_yo: now  what do NS play as defence?|pg||
mb|d|nt|sfoxa:  hello, Shirley, hi to all|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps easier also |pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Sveta, welcome |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wouldnt pass|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|suketbombi: true but a 4-4-3-2 is always a good reason not to supress|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you leap to 4 or bid 3?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andreasw:  2@s look normal|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6 card major, too much chance of a game for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: if 2/1 ish, E has not reason to go leaping around yet |pg||
nt|sybarra: but this bidding may stop them in 4 @S |pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|andyv:  vul probably stopped S|pg||

nt|sybarra: sad opportunity missed here |pg||
pc|cA|nt|wygbe1: 6d is a terrible contract but can be made if you can see through the cards|pg||

nt|babs59: but when it's a minor, it's really tough - need 2 diamonds opposite|pg||

nt|vugraphzau: other semis  West bengal A  39 Up  against Wbengal B|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i dont think you would go minus 1100 on that south hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: multi?|pg||

nt|yo_yo: that's good then :)|pg||

nt|drkvas: this is a tricky hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|sfoxa:  hm, it looks like close to major game for NS, but @s or @h prevails?|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets play spades  looks easier |pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you, we only have YOUR word for that :)|pg||
nt|panja: 6@D for NS..not easy to get there though|pg||

nt|yo_yo: in the other room then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: cant see other room|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|sybarra: but alas 3 tricks for e/w more likely |pg||

nt|drkvas: now 200|pg||
nt|drkvas: cash board|pg||
pc|c8|nt|panja: this is the moment of truth...|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 4@D is likely to prevail due to friendly @SS inspite of bad @D break|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: yes it's not great, 10 high|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: could make all the tricks now |pg||

pc|d9|nt|offthebend: or 3-suit other than Spades :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|babs59: since this contract looks impregnable...  I remember directing when an opponent failed to alert his precision 1C|pg||
nt|babs59: the next opponent remembered he played (we call it) TOXIC, and bid 2S - clubs or reds|pg||
pc|h2|nt|babs59: his partner forgot - given the lack of alert of 1C - and so 2S became the final contract (vul)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|babs59: so they played 2S  -800 - each opponent had a 16+ hand with long spades and neither could double :)|pg||

nt|yo_yo: and North will hopefully have a 2 suited bid available|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 3N by EW unless N is active|pg||
nt|wygbe1: south had to guess to preserve entries to spade, as opposed to looking for 22 diamonds|pg||

nt|vugraphzhs: not south though|pg||
nt|panja: perhaps only 7 tricks in @H on good defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think if S  is going to open 1 nt,  then should bid 3 @D over 2 @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: will be glad no higher than 2 |pg||
mb|4S|nt|suketbombi: n-s will do to get a @C parial here|pg||

mb|d|nt|andyv:  hard to comment on the 6@s bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i sympathise with Gupta , he has an enormous hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  yes. good decision to stop as low as possible. seems reasonable, if partner is limited to 15|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  S look his partner in the eye's and saw @s AKQ and went to slam only problem was that N blink to many times|pg||

pc|s5|pc|d5|pg||
nt|panja: Ariz hasn't thought about that...|pg||
nt|sandip2006: venky should bid 3@d|pg||

mb|p|nt|andreasw:  another strong @c?|pg||

nt|yo_yo: has Vahalia shown 5@D and 4@C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe just clubs so far |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: should be good result for n/s this board...5@c or 5@d|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  may be, try @h and fast claim?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: obviously, 3n was going down, but south didnt like position of club k for defense|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  normal contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: difficult now, when East bids again Ariz might take him for a stronger hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: but bidding 1@D has worked OK|pg||
nt|drkvas: sry 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  it helps in partnerships to have a firm guideline as to how good or bad your michaels bid can be|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c by EW will have some difficulty with the bad @d break, but 3N should work|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: the Michaels weak or strong (but not inbetween) seems popular|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is a 14 count that is more oriented to defence than to @ss|pg||
