nt|brolucius: Some use 'cheapest bid' as the weak one.|pg||
nt|bobh1: anyway not much at stake on that first board|pg||
nt|bobh1: just a competition to see which side goes down in a partscore|pg||
nt|bobh1: this one is more interesting|pg||
nt|migry: North did well to pass the 1@d opening instead of doubling|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: North's hand is miles too good for a weak two, of course.|pg||

mb|2H|an|6 !h, no 4 card suit|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I am breathing a sigh of relief that Migry understands ALL about the relay system. |pg||

mb|2S!|an|relay|mb|p|nt|migry: 2NT= 6322|pg||
mb|2N!|an|6322 or 7222|mb|p|nt|bobh1: this is kind of an unusual twist on the relay approach|pg||
mb|3C!|an|relay|nt|migry: 3@c asks about the 3 card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: most relayers use 2@c as the starting point for the torture auctions|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks to our operator for finding the time to put in the bidding explanations. Much appreciated!|pg||
nt|migry: they play 1NT as GF relay over 1@d and 1@h openings, 1@s over 1@c and 2@c over 1S|pg||

nt|migry: with 4@d showing a minimum hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: An ultra-long relay sequence is always more impressive if it happens to end in the right contract.|pg||
nt|migry: and 4@s= i don't care, tell me how many key  cards u have anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4@S probably asking for the trump queen.|pg||
mb|5C!|mb|p|mb|5D!|nt|migry: i wonder if roy is going to bid the slam knowing they miss 1 key card and the Q@h |pg||

mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: roy figures chris can guess the Q|pg||
pc|d8|nt|brolucius: Playing the hearts for one loser: laying down the ace loses to low singleton with East (two cases), finessing twice loses to K-Q doubleton (1 case).|pg||

nt|bobh1: back to the mundane|pg||
mb|1N!|an|14-16|nt|migry: 1NT =14-16 |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Mundane is a rather generous word to choose for as 1NT contract. I am usually a little harsher.|pg||
mb|p|mb|d!|an|4 card major and longer minor OR long M|nt|brolucius: Hurray! West has rescued us.|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is actually a rather good hand for that range|pg||
nt|bobh1: double is obviously conventional|pg||
nt|brolucius: But East may pass it if he chooses.|pg||
nt|bobh1: only a few pairs can actually double 1n for penalties these days|pg||
nt|migry: i guess it shows a 5+ card minor and a 4 card major|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|an|bid your minor|nt|brolucius: Rescuing to 2@S would be awful for North.|pg||
nt|bobh1: this unavailability of a penalty double has brought the psychic 1n opening back into fashion|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: no reason to rescue - especially after an artificial double|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brolucius: It would be an awful effort whatever the double meant.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: East does not pass 2@D, a known 5-2 fit, because he will have at least a 4-3 fit in West's major.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: W seems to have escaped his exotic double without too much damage|pg||
nt|migry: a heart lead is on its way|pg||
nt|bobh1: actually i think it is clear to balance|pg||
nt|bobh1: if you don't you can feel a @s lead coming|pg||
nt|bobh1: kind of surprised Billy Cohen didn't balance in the other room|pg||
nt|migry: 5431 is a good shape to balance with - as you know that defending 1NT on the probable spade lead is not going to be great anyway|pg||
pc|h7|nt|brolucius: The risk of balancing with a double is that partner may pass it. However, East did not pass, despite holding 11 points, so maybe they have an agreement to pass only with a really ...|pg||

nt|bobh1: Milt hasn't been around much the last ten years or so but he was a well-known player in the last century|pg||

nt|migry: a "roy" special|pg||
nt|bobh1: a game at least|pg||
nt|migry: 1@c is either natural or balanced|pg||
nt|brolucius: South is treating his hand as a weak 1NT, so opens 1@C.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess it depends on what youre interested in David|pg||
nt|brolucius: My interest in 1NT contracts has to be measured with a very accurate instrument.|pg||
nt|bobh1: roy eschews opening his 5-card major|pg||
nt|bobh1: he is really a law unto himself at the bridge table|pg||
mb|2N!|an|13-15 balanced|mb|p|nt|migry: never a dull moment:)|pg||
nt|bobh1: away from it as well but that is beyond our scope here|pg||
nt|bobh1: clearly they play this as forcing|pg||
nt|brolucius: Nothing wrong with 1@C. If you had another four points, you would open 1NT instead of 1@H. |pg||
nt|migry: North could have bid 1@s= GF relay or 2NT showing either GF balanced or very weak with clubs|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3S!|an|spades|mb|p|nt|migry: the GF bal with 4@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the face of it, you would discover more information by responding 1@S.|pg||
nt|bobh1: well since 1@s is artificial it wasn't available|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: do they still play transfer responses to 1@c migry?|pg||
nt|migry: yes|pg||
nt|bobh1: so he could have bid 1@h|pg||
nt|bobh1: instead he chose this approach|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|migry: they would never bid 1@H with a GF hand unless it's extremely unbalanced|pg||
nt|bobh1: conveys more about the basic hand-type|pg||
nt|brolucius: And allows him to play 3NT.|pg||
nt|migry: so north's options were either to relay with 1@s or 2NT, giving less info and maybe rightsiding the contract|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes it right-sides notrump a lot and also probably conceals his suits in some cases where they blast to 3n|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is the moment where South enjoys displaying a dummy with five hearts in it.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bobh1: sorry migry didn't see your comment until after i'd typed mine|pg||
nt|migry: right, if you had any misgivings about not showing that heart suit, the lead makes it look great|pg||
nt|bobh1: some people would not call it a "suit" which is i guess where Roy is coming from|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you were playing a weak 1NT, you would open 1NT on the South cards rather than 1@H. So, if 1@C is your normal bid on a weak 1NT type, that is the opening you make.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Of course. Opponents often go wrong when the space is removed, even if they could in theory have penalised you for a big number.|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobh1: personally when they open flannery against me i utter a silent cheer|pg||

nt|bobh1: a kib mentions that levin-weinstein play it|pg||

nt|migry: i am so happy whenever my partner makes a lead directing double |pg||
