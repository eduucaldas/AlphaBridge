mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|sunsamvar: If i have to pick 2 teams for the finals it is TamilNadu and West Bengal|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|petergill: Many strong clubbers play 1@S response as balanced, so the strong hand plays the NT's |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: yes Indian Railways and Rana Roy has almost monopoloised the Indian Nationals for a long long time|pg||

nt|petergill: The first "swingy hand" of the match|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|petergill: @D to queen and 4 rounds of spades to see what NS discard = likely play I think|pg||
