nt|lml: and there is a chance for another club|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not judging by the result in the other room :)|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: 2D must be some sort of spade raise...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 2d is alerted...waiting for explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 2d is probably a suit, but may be lead directing|pg||
nt|poohbear: upgrading to 18-19 by East|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lml: this should go down but it is harder to defend than play some times|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: yes -- it looks as though EW really lost their way on defence at the oterh table|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 2D says I have the beer card (diamond 7) ... just kidding|pg||
nt|bigtrain: definitely too good for a 15-17 NT|pg||
mb|2D|an|alert|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: they started diamonds, then eventually managed to set up two spade tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: quiet pass...|pg||

nt|vugraphzjp: klimo reminded campbell and he said 'i have hearts'|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: another 2 imps probably for Gartaganis|pg||
nt|poohbear: wonder what 2@d shows?|pg||
nt|poohbear: perhaps 5@s 4@h inv|pg||
nt|poohbear: after 2@s bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: if so East should pass|pg||
nt|poohbear: no sense running from 2@s|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: looks like it|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 2D showed hearts??|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I play that but not to show KJ10...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: spade switch may work...get rid of dummies trumps...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Stewart sees things differently|pg||
nt|jlrice: with the favorable spade layout  2NT can be made though|pg||
nt|poohbear: true|pg||
nt|poohbear: but 10 of @ds is the reason 2NT makes. Otherwise 2@s would be better|pg||
nt|jlrice: 2S is better regardless   |pg||
nt|poohbear: I would lead a @c from South|pg||
nt|poohbear: After a @c lead North will have a good idea of the count since partner didnt lead a 5 card @d suit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: 1NT can be hard to defend|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the @S2 gives West the impression that declarer has Kx -- hence th cash of the ace|pg||
nt|lml: I like the idea of switching to a spade but the 2 isnt the right card|pg||
nt|lml: if she leads the @SQ for instance and then shift back to a heart that works pretty well|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so declarer has 7 tricks for sure now just by knocking out the @CA|pg||
nt|lml: even the @S6 might work|pg||
nt|poohbear: I dont like that lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzjp: not now|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|afulton: like I said, toasting the Robinson team...|pg||
nt|poohbear: thats a ridiculous statement given the fact that they are leading and Robinson hasnt exactly shined|pg||
nt|afulton: that is true... but one can always wish the opponents a good game|pg||
nt|afulton: personally, i would like to see a team made up mostly of women make it to USA1|pg||
pc|d2|nt|buffytvs: I think Ross is trying to induce a diamond switch from the defence|pg||

nt|lml: Taylor doesnt have 6 hearts|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lml: and so Judy has at least one more|pg||
nt|lml: @H9|pg||
nt|lml: sorry|pg||
nt|buffytvs: upside down dyslexia -- the rarest form :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: Please turn your screen right side up, Linda|pg||
nt|lml: well he got his diamond shift but can he afford to win the @D9 anyway|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lml: I guess he can win the 9 and play heart heart|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he can just win thw king and play a club -- easy route to 7 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: whe can always overtake the diamond|pg||
nt|lml: its playing for the overtricks that is slowing this down|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- maybe they're all starting to think that every IMP wil be vital in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: and every imp is vital|pg||
nt|lml: sounds like Monty Python|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: wrong forum for that|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- and every IMP is good (thx specs)|pg||

nt|buffytvs: everyone getting tired|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Gartaganis is 4-handed, and Korbel virtually so|pg||

pc|h2|nt|niclecuyer: ok |pg||
pc|h6|nt|poohbear: one round of trumps and start @ds|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gavin:  north needs to give an encouraging signal so partner knows to set up his spades before he enters with the king of diamonds|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: braaavo Ross...|pg||
nt|gavin:  north can see his K@D will be an entry|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|gavin:  when  declarer has a guess for a queen like this|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: Piotr will guess this I think|pg||
nt|gavin:  they typically will try to see if they can figure out who has more @C|pg||
nt|gavin:  because the person who has 4, is more likely to have the queen, 4-3|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I would go down because it is the club Q and I cannot guess that Q|pg||
nt|gavin:  rather than just flipping a coin which is 50-50|pg||
nt|gavin:  so east is going to try to place shapes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gavin:  as declarer it looks like south has 4@S,4@H (south played 3@H, 2@H, doesnt seem like J32)|pg||
