nt|panja: on the contrary, I expect West Bengal team to be a little more conservative in their approach..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Dave Thompson|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That should make for an interesting match, Prakash|pg||
nt|panja: y...|pg||
nt|mrdct: interesting hand to start with|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: some discussion about  Options  to sit|pg||
nt|mrdct: will be hard for NS to stay out of 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: the choice to field lineups|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let them sit on chairs and play bridge|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Choosing opponents can be very difficult - you always know when you have made the wrong choice, but only afterwards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All those technicalities|pg||
nt|panja: and for W Bengal?|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: a minute or 2 more please|pg||
nt|panja: ok|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am sure I would open tha North hand - no way to avoid game after that.|pg||
nt|panja: Kripa is the President of Bridge Federation of India.....elected last year...|pg||
nt|mrdct: tempting to open the north hand - despite only 9hcp a good 6-4 with all his values in his suit and potentially useful void|pg||
nt|panja: and a very good player..|pg||
nt|panja: Prabhakar...honey is his nickname..I would have liked to see that on the board here...rather than the truncated name|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Chennai, formerly known as Madras, is the capital city of Tamil Nadu. India consists of 28 states and 7 Union Territories if I am not mistaken|pg||
nt|panja: y.......Chennai is the city name, Tamilnadu is the state name now...but it was a very large area..Madras Presidency I believe...in the days of Raj|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt might have a lillte shot with no @d out|pg||
nt|mrdct: hard to construct an auction that ends in 3NT though|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: Rulebooks refered,  NRK  had won the toss in the morning  to  select lineups in 3 & 4th set    but  rulebook says something else|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: and we start now|pg||
nt|mrdct: the 1st piece of the puzzle is whether or not north opens|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: I think a club lead beats 3NT, admittedly it would not be easy to find - but then neither will 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so 4@h is the contract:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Perfectly reasonable auction - nae luck|pg||
nt|mrdct: practical bid by south in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|panja: a shift will lose a trick for EW here...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed it will|pg||
nt|panja: W is rightly worried about setting up @SQJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If he finesses the club, risking even more down...|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|panja: Aloke will play @HA and small...no doubt about that|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  still inly chance to win|pg||
nt|panja: and he will likely finesse @C too...|pg||
nt|andreasw:  only*|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|panja: I rather this as a make|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ritong: there is one Kx , but two Jx and 10x, though|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|panja: rate this...|pg||
nt|mrdct: @SK still looks right as it guarantees 3 defensive trick and the 4th will either be the @DA or a long trump with p|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|s7|pc|cK|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|h2|pc|s2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, on reflection I am sure he will realise that it was right to cash both spades|pg||
mc|9|nt|andreasw:  ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: u|pg||
nt|andreasw:  why -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: sorry pd  - sadhu|pg||
nt|ritong: playing with the odds is A and Q of @hs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes it is and that's why he went down|pg||
nt|mrdct: yep got trumps wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: as he played QH from hand|pg||
nt|ritong: good play, bad result|pg||

mb|2C|nt|vugraphzhs: e/w std|pg||
nt|drkvas: hi all|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andyv:  E hand looked like it might be better served to bid 2@h michaels if they play that|pg||
nt|andyv:  not that W would get very excited|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Welcome All from Chenai India |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Welcme Raju|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Welcome |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: precision may make it easier for n/s to find their spot |pg||
nt|sybarra: which looks like about 3 @D max |pg||
nt|wygbe1: are ns playing weak nt?|pg||
nt|shevek: aren't we happy when opps bid OUR suit?  :)|pg||
nt|sga1: Now what N plans to do?|pg||
nt|sga1: 3NT?|pg||
nt|xenya: we are -- until partner bids our void at the 3-level|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: hi Raju/Sudhir/Nicoleta|pg||
nt|shevek: looks good from where WE seat :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: and Vladimir|pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi|pg||
nt|shevek: I never support pd with a void....|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: N/S NT 15-17|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome dr. K |pg||
nt|xenya: somehow i fail to understand N's second pass|pg||
mb|4H|nt|wygbe1: many would open n hand 1nt if 15-17|pg||
nt|andyv:  good evening everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  this should just be flat board|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good afternoon from Manchester UK|pg||
nt|andreasw:  hello|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Kath|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Welcome Kath|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, a bit strange...|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  certainly not too much to the play|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|shevek: I would just bid 2@c|pg||
pc|s6|nt|wygbe1: must have downgraded for no aces - it worked out since 4s down|pg||
nt|drkvas: @h now will prevent@c ruff |pg||
pc|s8|nt|shevek: I know it's a bit strong for that, but void in pd's hand....|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: morning Andy and welcome|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 4@H needs JT soubleton @H aFter 2 @Ss are cashed but no will have to settle for 1 dn with doubleton @HK comming down|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|yo_yo: just a question of not getting too high|pg||
nt|drkvas: 140|pg||
nt|sybarra: not everyone would open 1 nt with S hand (with stiff K of @D) |pg||
nt|sybarra: but it worked |pg||
nt|drkvas: they r the strongest pair of their team  iguess will try things to over come the deficit|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  dblton @s slowed down both N and S|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: this will go 1 or 2 off, but the hand was always fraught with danger|pg||
nt|shevek: looks like no play|pg||
nt|suketbombi: has to settle after he sees no T or J on @HA|pg||
nt|shevek: had north bid 2@c instead of passing, they could've stopped in a part score|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|suketbombi: an agressive 4@S game just about vul pay off but a decent stop by NS here|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wygbe1: however, as a spec pointed out 3nt looks pretty cold|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzhs: revoke |pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzhs: 10 tricks after revoke|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|c3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|shevek: south opened 4@h in the OR|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|shevek: flat board|pg||
mc|9|nt|xenya: they could have, but i strongly doubt they would have |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: he would've been better off without the @H9|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: and @h8 as well|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Going with the odds will pay in the long run - but sometimes the run seems very long indeed|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: looks like 4 unavoidable losers in 4@S here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Saving wear on the bidding cards|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: In the other room 4@H had no chance on board 29 as West cashed both spade honours|pg||
nt|andreasw:  an unluck 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so a flat board|pg||
nt|panja: @C lead, then @SA and then @HQ or @HQ at trick two?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mrdct: you get a fair bit of poetic licence in 3rd seat|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|panja: and now, E must cash @D, he will I gues|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The old books would tell him to lead an ae at trick 1|pg||
nt|cuttysark: ace, I mean|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And, if the first one doesn't work too well, another ace :)|pg||

nt|yo_yo: yes good for them!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: like these claims as operator:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: easy to get carried away by that lovely south hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do they play strong NT?|pg||
nt|andyv:  precision|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if so  here it comes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's the range?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: e/w nt 14-15...n/s 15-17|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand looks NTish no matter what the range is|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y es ok 6 imps and west bengal B is now in lead|pg||
nt|wygbe1: south would have to suppress his major, which is reasonable given the secondary cards and spots in the other suits|pg||
nt|drkvas: a quite start last set started with a grand slam:)|pg||
nt|granguru: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to John Plaut|pg||
nt|granguru: namaste prakash|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and to our operator, Mahesh|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Welcome John and Roland|pg||
nt|sga1: S got a chance to make in OR.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: u mean @S were not cashed?|pg||
nt|sga1: Freaky boards looks like this Set.|pg||
nt|sga1: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: yes they cashed @sAK|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: ty mahesh|pg||
nt|sga1: No they didn't in OR shifted after @s A|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 6 @D might be more likely |pg||
nt|yo_yo: now  what do NS play as defence?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hello, Shirley, hi to all|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps easier also |pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Sveta, welcome |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wouldnt pass|pg||
nt|sga1: He played @h wrong A and Q|pg||
nt|suketbombi: other room did not Alok should have made this one tho after @HA|pg||
mb|1S|nt|suketbombi: true but a 4-4-3-2 is always a good reason not to supress|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you leap to 4 or bid 3?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  2@s look normal|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6 card major, too much chance of a game for NS|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: if 2/1 ish, E has not reason to go leaping around yet |pg||
nt|sybarra: but this bidding may stop them in 4 @S |pg||
nt|granguru: will NS be able to win 3NT|pg||
nt|suketbombi: if @HA does not fetch T or J have to finesse @Cs and hope for the best in @HS|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  vul probably stopped S|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: unlikely to go beyong 3nt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzhs: thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: sad opportunity missed here |pg||
nt|shevek: @sA lead, switch to @d2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wygbe1: 6d is a terrible contract but can be made if you can see through the cards|pg||
nt|suketbombi: show up squeeze after the minors are through|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sudhir Aggarwal|pg||
nt|shevek: the 2nd @s loser got away|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S shut the auction off |pg||
nt|sga1: Hi all|pg||
nt|granguru: contract is asked at least|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Welcome Sudhir|pg||
nt|granguru: now to the TASK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|granguru: I think easy 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sga1: The bidding on Both boards is contrast in both rooms. S opened 4@h in 1 and N opened 4@s in 2 in OR.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  spot cards aren't exactly encouraging to bidding with S hand|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|sga1: may be 10|pg||
nt|granguru: @H being 3-3 and well placed probably defense could never have beated this contract|pg||
nt|sga1: Here they opened 1@h and 1@s only.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|granguru: best for west is @HQ|pg||
nt|granguru: then after N ducks SMALL @h|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzhs: decl thinking|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|sga1: However contracts were same.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but 2 suits|pg||

nt|mrdct: EW could get to a tricky 3NT contract here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A games swing for Tamilnadu on that board makes their lead healthier|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|panja: possibly, they might get to 4@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ritong: basically, he knows he is one tempo behind in NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|cuttysark: But partner could have a more helpful diamond holding|pg||
nt|ritong: but he bets on a @d honor with his pard|pg||
nt|ritong: or a friendly lie of the suit|pg||
nt|mrdct: he needs the @dJ coming down|pg||

nt|sybarra: and worried about  whether 3 @C was forcing |pg||
nt|sybarra: (my guesses) |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think you would go minus 1100 on that south hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: multi?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think so either... my declarer play has improved|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's good then :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Hello Panja|pg||
nt|drkvas: this is a tricky hand|pg||
nt|sga1: well defended|pg||
nt|granguru: EW time to try 3NT|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@H is a makeable contract as well|pg||
nt|shevek: nice unbalanced hands |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: the result was different however -- on the second deal |pg||
mb|1H|nt|sfoxa:  hm, it looks like close to major game for NS, but @s or @h prevails?|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets play spades  looks easier |pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you, we only have YOUR word for that :)|pg||
nt|panja: 6@D for NS..not easy to get there though|pg||
nt|granguru: and even 5@H I believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: gosh, no weak 2, no multi from south|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes very for both sides|pg||
nt|sga1: We all would like to thank our Sponsors TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) for sponsoring this wonderful event.|pg||

nt|sybarra: sorry I meant ...|pg||
nt|drkvas: thinking?|pg||

nt|drkvas: a doomed contract ew high already|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: He needs to bid more|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, S's hand is a piece of junk|pg||
nt|andreasw:  he dosent like |pg||
mb|2H|nt|andreasw:  @s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i never do well when i pass all the time|pg||
nt|andyv:  bridge is sitll a bidder's game|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|panja: S shd bid 4@D here...|pg||
nt|suketbombi: cud have just about doubled 3@C too late to get in now|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  everyone agree with 2@h by W?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mahesh, any women playing?|pg||
nt|drkvas: red card pls:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: S probably didnt want to to run |pg||
nt|drkvas: 300|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Summer_Nationals/2010/External_Page.el  only website I have |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but it's too high|pg||
nt|sybarra: on a @D lead may have a shot at this |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: not in this room:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in the other room then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: cant see other room|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@S 4th suit FG|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 3@d: no @H support|pg||
nt|sga1: Board 1 contract 4@h, one hand void in @h, Board 2 contract 4@s one hand void in @s, this hand let us see.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: but alas 3 tricks for e/w more likely |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i might double with the West hand  andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  quality of @h suit makes me prefer dbl|pg||
nt|granguru: no 4@S|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|sybarra: or does he need to? |pg||
nt|panja: hi Sandip|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 3@d bid by S almost looks as if someone misbid... maybe S thought N's 2@s showed @s and @ds?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  or missunderstood 2@d?|pg||
nt|andyv:  or @s and another (not clubs) and 3@d was pass or correct|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont play precision but the 2@D bid worked like a charm for EW|pg||

nt|suketbombi: kiruba fining a nice 1nt insteas of 1@S here|pg||

mb|p|nt|andreasw:  i knew it!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: not south though|pg||

nt|sybarra: I think if S  is going to open 1 nt,  then should bid 3 @D over 2 @S |pg||
nt|suketbombi: dbl will not be penalty tho|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: will be glad no higher than 2 |pg||
nt|granguru: even with 2 unsefull queens|pg||
nt|sga1: EW in 4@h in OR -3 likely.|pg||
nt|babs59: this will go at least -1, more if diamond ruff allowed|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: n-s will do to get a @C parial here|pg||
nt|wygbe1: optimistic bid by w, very beatable|pg||

nt|sga1: Same bidding in other room as well. Why not, we are watching some of the best players.|pg||
nt|granguru: they have only 17 useful points|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  hard to comment on the 6@s bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i sympathise with Gupta , he has an enormous hand|pg||
nt|sga1: Only difference 4@h was doubled by W.|pg||
nt|granguru: reasonably|pg||
nt|xenya: can't escape it|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  yes. good decision to stop as low as possible. seems reasonable, if partner is limited to 15|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @DQ|pg||
nt|sga1: So 9 imps to TN would be leader once again after this.|pg||

nt|vugraphzhs: so the 1st dbl by Sunit|pg||
nt|granguru: but the bidding suggests not to double|pg||
nt|sga1: Kiruba didn't believe his partner will produce a trick. So he decided to pass.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andyv:  rkc might have taken care of that problem|pg||

nt|panja: what will S play after @H?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|panja: Ariz hasn't thought about that...|pg||
nt|sandip2006: venky should bid 3@d|pg||
nt|panja: E hand will be squeezed in the meantime..that will help South choose a benign shift|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mrdct: double fits are always good value - if you have one you can usually bid an extra level or two|pg||
pc|s6|nt|offthebend: actually attacking S was better but can't blame N trying to find a Tap suit |pg||
nt|cuttysark: North may have taken @C10 as suit preference - common signal with a singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Anyway, a spade switch is a Good Idea|pg||
nt|mrdct: needs to play the Q here as could easily lose 2@h on a 4-1 break|pg||

nt|andreasw:  he will make with 3@d on N hand|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cuttysark: Different outcome onan initial spade lead, I think, but hard to blame North for trying the unbid suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzhs: lucky u Sveta|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow!!  that is fast |pg||
nt|sybarra: and fun,  I like the speed balls, |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: hope they played speed ball in nationals:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think ours are typically 10 min for 2 |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  fortunately, there were only 18 boards to play - even thereafter I got the feeling of the end of working week.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  E-W shoudl reach 4@s or 3nt here and go down:(|pg||
nt|yo_yo: any comments Mahesh?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: silence all around|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very good|pg||
nt|panja: good play by Venky..if @CQ did not drop, he would have reverted to @S finesses|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant bring myself to say WD :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: cant lead @c with KX west...|pg||
nt|sybarra: my other comment would be "not great defense" |pg||
nt|yo_yo: no one would lead a @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont think W can find the club lead either |pg||
nt|sybarra: needs some swing bds |pg||
nt|drkvas: the dbl shd have come in the previous bd|pg||
nt|sga1: NS would not believe that they lost imps after this wonderful bid here.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sure make it as interesting as possible|pg||
nt|xenya: nice slam here|pg||
nt|sga1: Rather cold shud be easy to bid and make.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will bump into it by sheer hcps|pg||
nt|suketbombi: all the while prabha was playing for 5@HS with kachchu still ud have made here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: again I will say, if one opens off shape 1 nt  as S did, maybe should bid 3 @D over 2 @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: surely a precision club now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: n/s playing precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: e/w std|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: does N say X or just bid spades? |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's not the hit! a kib from Norway informed, that they play speed ball as 9 minutes for 3 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: sorry |pg||
nt|andyv:  E passed?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this can't be right?|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Welcome Raju|pg||
nt|drkvas: i agree|pg||
nt|andyv:  gm, Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello andy welcome |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: welcome Andy|pg||
nt|drkvas: hello andy welcome |pg||
nt|granguru: there is a chance to climb to 6 in a minor here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4 @H may be more of a challenge |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: they dont have TV here or could have watched football :(|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: taking bull by the horns, as we say,  he just bid it |pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: you missed Roland slam last board Raju :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will find an ace missing  kachchu would not believe this:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  another strong @c?|pg||
nt|panja: interesting play |pg||
nt|panja: @HQ will get ducked I guess..but W has @DK entry for @H's|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has Vahalia shown 5@D and 4@C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe just clubs so far |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: should be good result for n/s this board...5@c or 5@d|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope they dont bid another slam |pg||
nt|granguru: no chance, ofcourse|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: we will have to tell you soccer scores then |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: watching on net :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: 0-1 55 mins|pg||
nt|sybarra: (the window behind vugraph ) |pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but this one doesn't look that strong|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes should be 5/4 either way|pg||
nt|drkvas: trump lead|pg||
nt|granguru: 3NT is a solid contract as the cards lie|pg||
nt|sga1: No way.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhs: yes..with this slow play can see score atleast|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at least, this board is "nothing special"|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: but still |pg||
mb|3H|nt|yo_yo: 5/4 either way, thanks to specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Vahalia thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: being red may slow him down |pg||
nt|yo_yo: bid up Vahalia!|pg||
nt|sga1: 3NT right contract. 3NT shows no 4-card major if 3@c was Puppet Stayman.|pg||
nt|granguru: looks like puppet|pg||
nt|granguru: Baron I was excplained..but then N should have said 3@D|pg||
nt|sga1: If 2NT is 20-21, kacchu wont beleive A is missing.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: with those poor pips i ma not sure 2nt opening is justified|pg||
nt|sga1: believe|pg||
nt|sga1: I agree Raju|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  may be, try @h and fast claim?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: obviously, 3n was going down, but south didnt like position of club k for defense|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: 6-4 bid one more |pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult to Ariz to bid after a slow double|pg||
nt|granguru: explained*|pg||
nt|sga1: Difficult to believe, no one plays Baron on 2Nt opening (IMO)|pg||
nt|granguru: as Baron asks to start bidding 4-cards suits up-the -line|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  normal contract|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the lead is with North (poor thing)|pg||
nt|andyv:  @h|pg||
nt|andreasw:  with gupta two bids they could have ende't up in 3@s|pg||
nt|drkvas: ho god|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ai |pg||
nt|drkvas: :)|pg||
nt|sga1: with points in short suits also|pg||
nt|babs59: but Chotan is trying to play all the hands.  haven't you noticed?|pg||
nt|babs59: 4 of the first 5 to North...|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  which will give W a chance to dump 2 @ds after pulling 2 rounds of trump|pg||
nt|yo_yo: never with that strong west hand surely|pg||
nt|suketbombi: was a good board for gujrat but -5 now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4NT  would have brought home the bacon for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes it's good not to know a convention|pg||
nt|xenya: reaonable auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: will have a smoke break after this board|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he should be ok with a @C and max 2@HS to loose|pg||
nt|shevek: of course Mahesh :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: :)|pg||
nt|shevek: same contract is being played in OR|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @CQ looks attractive next to @H9|pg||
nt|shevek: bad trump break, but @s finesse on|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oh prabha on lead |pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  wow... nice lead|pg||
nt|sga1: Most of the players today bid NT with 5-card major, that is why Puppet Stayman is so popular.|pg||
nt|granguru: specially 2NT openings|pg||
nt|granguru: as it is in those hands where is it more important to have the strong hand deing declarer|pg||
nt|granguru: being*|pg||
nt|granguru: E knows west cant have more than 1 point|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Prabhakar thinking|pg||
nt|granguru: more than 3 in fact..as N might have 19 instead of 21|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: still waiting for east to play|pg||
nt|granguru: but if W has the S!J then no more than a Q outside..so there is no chance to find a fast entry in his hand|pg||
nt|granguru: @SJ|pg||
nt|xenya: now they've bypassed blackwood|pg||
nt|shevek: really??|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: good lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzhs: was waititng for tray|pg||
nt|xenya: ah|pg||
nt|suketbombi: tray with some goddies in it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: east must be looking at the bids after chotan passed|pg||

nt|vugraphzhs: waiting for east to lead|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|panja: S will not get his @CK now..|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes 4nt to show longer @Ds and 5@C longer @cs or equal|pg||
nt|suketbombi: bacon is not what Vahalia wud look for as he is strict Vegetarian|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok bringing home potatoes then |pg||
nt|sga1: good defense|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah what's the equivalent for vegetarians?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  nice play|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer should be careful here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: difficult to underlead ace of spade now |pg||
nt|sybarra: that would be helpful to clear the @H in dummy |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|suketbombi: looking at @C A kacchu must have said I told you:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Kachchu telling Venky ...Thank God didnt bid grand after the lead of Ace|pg||
nt|shevek: truth is I would still be thinking what to lead :)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yo_yo: nice defence|pg||
nt|xenya: simple line was to ruff a club in dummy|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|shevek: I think declarer feared the lead was kingleton|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h3|nt|granguru: E deduced all of this and decided to render the @SQ to declarer just in case he needed a rounded Q finesse|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|shevek: seems like the lead was worth 10 imps|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|andyv:  I think 1@s was positive and GF, Andreas|pg||
nt|suketbombi: declerer will assume double @S now go down :(|pg||
pc|c8|nt|shevek: in OR north led CA|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|suketbombi: now that is clear 800 here wonder why with 2 @CS N had no bid on 4@D nither did south had his 4@D|pg||
nt|xenya: so the imaginative lead worked out beautifully? |pg||
nt|suketbombi: shock when he sees @S 6|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe 11 imps|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will take it 1 dn try for clubs first then @S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andreasw:  u sure?:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  no|pg||
nt|andyv:  but why would E raise?|pg||
nt|panja: S will be strip squeezed to lead away from @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: n/s arguing|pg||
nt|suketbombi: cash @CA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  W was hoping for 3-3 @hs|pg||
nt|drkvas: 200|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|sybarra: had the @h's figured out |pg||
nt|suketbombi: @CQ by kiruba|pg||
nt|suketbombi: kiruba knows w does not have 4@Ss shd throw @CQ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzhs: brb... smoke break 5mins|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  great! next please :-))|pg||
nt|sybarra: that means I can pour coffee |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|shevek: @s6 would be consistent with the lead wouldn't it|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
mc|9|nt|shevek: wd Prabhakar|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no just in case declerer has 2 @Ss he has to check on @C K with pd|pg||
nt|xenya: but i don't see why declarer should be worried about the stiff @SK |pg||
nt|suketbombi: look at from declereer point of view he is assured if @SK is doubleton anyway he did not have much choices there|pg||

nt|shevek: 5@dx by north in OR|pg||
mb|1D|mb|3H|nt|yo_yo: Vahlia might bid 3@H now|pg||
nt|andyv:  we should have a general disclaimer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: multi or balanced?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: keep them updated on scores maybe they play faster?|pg||
nt|panja: to bid or not to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhs: yes sure|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that normal,  it pass 1@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and now they are in game|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok 4 now? |pg||
nt|shevek: yes, 4@h no play|pg||
mb|3N|nt|panja: Kista is pretty enterprising...so Venky must be thinking about covering a daring bid with that pass...|pg||
nt|babs59: you know, Chotan's 2NT last hand almost looks better than Kista's this hand|pg||
nt|shevek: as the @ss lie, great contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: as the @H are @HJ109 in one hand therecant be a trump promotion here|pg||
nt|sga1: Looks like first game swing for WB as EW playing in 4@s in other room.|pg||
nt|granguru: f.i. @SAK ruff @HQ and @Sruffed by E with a high trump...|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 4@H is dn one due to entryles dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 4@S is an excellent defense |pg||
nt|suketbombi: depends it is matter of when you get in love with your hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  maybe normal but doesn't look right|pg||
nt|sga1: 2@s showed 20-21 with 5@s?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|andyv:  I'm sure N did not expect to participate in the auction, let alone be the declarer.|pg||
nt|granguru: funny SJ|pg||
nt|xenya: this won't be a success|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andreasw:  the 1@d pass look's okay to me what should he bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: well you would have to bid playing any other system|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1NT i suppose|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Vahalia can bid 3@H  because his hand is limited by failure to open strong @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|andreasw:  i like the pass but then again i would have bid 1@c on S hand|pg||
nt|panja: hi all, this would not be an easy make because of the trump promotion...|pg||
nt|granguru: @SQ was the right play|pg||
nt|sga1: I prefer to play transfer here i.e. 3@h is @s raise and 3@s ask Partner to bid 3NT.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  S is silent once again. with this hand, overcall seems a must|pg||
nt|sybarra: and likely 2 @S makes sense here |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: was thinking of football game :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes. but now beating 3nt looks like a miracle|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like to try to "jam" the auction, E/W got a free pass here |pg||
nt|sga1: so that strong hand plays.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhs: Hi Panja|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Panja|pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi panja|pg||
nt|panja: Declarer can make by pinning @CT....but that is easier said|pg||
nt|panja: hi Raju, Shirley all|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes but venky here has a reason if u ask him he will tell u he was protecting @CK:)|pg||
nt|sga1: :) :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: right or wrong this wud be his answer:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: too late|pg||
nt|yo_yo: always making i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: E chickened out of continuing @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: sorry was away...smoke break ...bidding had started|pg||
nt|shevek: a longer auction to the same contract....|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: yes I am sure it is a surprise |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|panja: he wasn't sure who held 4, I guess|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, sorry, 3nt is cold here, my wrong view|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: can N find j of spade and her did  but 1 @S, 5 @C and 4 @D...... |pg||
nt|sga1: on a @d lead this could have defeated.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzhs: east thinking|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|sybarra: before n/s get in again |pg||
nt|drkvas: re|pg||
nt|andyv:  re Dr.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: they seem to duplicate most of the final contracts though|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: now not so good|pg||
nt|panja: oh leaving trump in the field|pg||
nt|suketbombi: strange|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kista may not be sure who has the 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: @sk will be 1 down now|pg||
nt|panja: that dbl of 1@H..surely @CQ is more likely to be with E...but N has ignored that clue..|pg||
nt|panja: Kista still not sure about @S situation? or is it about a trump with Venky?|pg||
nt|panja: W hasn't trump echoed....played @H3 and @h8...|pg||
nt|panja: 48 rather|pg||
nt|suketbombi: kista wud take his time but return @S safe an sure he has nothing to kiise here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if his partner has 4 then it's a ruff and sluff|pg||
nt|panja: y, @S seems the best option...but what if Declare had 6@H, 3@D..2@S 2@C>|pg||
nt|panja: then...a @D if W holds @DQ..|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: would like to thank TCS for sponsoring this tourney|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sfoxa:  indeed, Shirley, you are right|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d3|nt|suketbombi: this is the longest i have seen kissta thinking|pg||
nt|andyv:  somehow, pulling trump by declarer doesn't seem right on this hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to send the Dr. seat belt or super glue |pg||
nt|drkvas: lol|pg||
nt|babs59: 4 off in the other room seems excessive|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|suketbombi: great double from chotan took them out of making 3nt:)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yo_yo: they play precision andreas|pg||
nt|xenya: but possible on a @H lead by S|pg||
nt|babs59: the defence got both spades AND hearts going|pg||
nt|babs59: SK then H switch|pg||
nt|sga1: Defense got 4@h, 3@s and one @d|pg||
nt|babs59: when declarer tried the @SA before @Ds - 8 defensive tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes but AJX was the dummy here|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would have bid 1@h with N hand and allow pd to further describe his hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sandip2006: both hand sq |pg||
pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: that's youth speaking :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: act now and face consequences later :)|pg||

nt|panja: in the morning....he meant..|pg||
nt|sybarra: is soccer on yet Mahesh? |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: not yet|pg||
nt|suketbombi: i was not there :)20 mins to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: 20 mins more|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is this a 2@C opener for Venky?|pg||
nt|andyv:  although the dbl by S was questionable, the price NS paid seemed high.|pg||
nt|sga1: @d lead and continuation, with @Sq as entry for ruff.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: venky gone for smoke ..brb|pg||
nt|sga1: TN has a chance for swing here as OR missed Game|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes 3nt on the @D hook|pg||
nt|suketbombi: because they play support double W cud not display his streanght may be cud have bid agressive 3@C having denied 3 @S on pd's dbl in the open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: all back now|pg||
nt|sga1: or 3@h after partner's double.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: east will ofcourse pass and so wll S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhs: easy for me when decl claims :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: they do not play precision as I recall |pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3nt is an overbid but with the match situation e-w seem have taken their chances|pg||
mb|1C|nt|andreasw:  in my book slam time is all the time:)|pg||
nt|drkvas: 1@s dbl aganist passed p n unpassed lho is not rt with that hand n result speaks for itself|pg||
nt|suketbombi: what is the hold up mahesh?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|panja: that was a great play then...if N had @SQ, there would be that double sq...if not @SK was fine on second round of @S anyway|pg||
nt|panja: is this Dadhi Venky?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: yes|pg||
nt|panja: ok|pg||
nt|sga1: Most of the Boards this set have been Push except two boards where TN took 10 imps each.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|andreasw:  1nt?|pg||
nt|panja: 3@S vs. 3@C here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I agree... but S was lured in by the 14hcp and did have support for all the unbit suits....again, not a great dbl but I think we've all made worse ones.|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, one north made 4@s and the other he made a good lead|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|yo_yo: 3 slams make i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree andy we all have |pg||
nt|sybarra: (made worse X) |pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  interesting quandry for N here|pg||
nt|drkvas: agreed  i was only high lightng the situation of passed p n unpassed lho|pg||
nt|sybarra: N not finding some of this that much fun |pg||
nt|shevek: I will nominate Prabhakar for the "man of the match"|pg||
mb|3H|nt|suketbombi: yes true was in inspired lead there |pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|sybarra: wonder why east bid 1 @D? |pg||
nt|xenya: W is consistently downgrading his hand?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: venky has not done justice to his hand here|pg||
nt|sga1: He is not able to see his @s King|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: waiting for tray...|pg||
nt|suketbombi: they play 2 way check back 2@C was puppet to 2@D for invitaional hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  no!|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes... good thing this is not a BAM event|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: 3nt all pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, 3N should make too|pg||
nt|andyv:  your comment hits the nail on the head, Dr.|pg||
nt|drkvas: 3nt makes if bid:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this hand does not sit well for this bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy to bid 3 nt but they did in the other room |pg||
nt|andyv:  it was in the OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: with no interference |pg||
nt|andyv:  W never bid @ds in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: there was no overcall of 2@d on 1@c|pg||
nt|drkvas: ho they did bid it in the other room now the nail is on gujarats coffin andy:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: 4@h was cold.|pg||
nt|sga1: Oh|pg||
nt|suketbombi: one more set after this|pg||
nt|xenya: well stopped|pg||
nt|suketbombi: bengal supportors are edgy but another 20 bds to g from here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|suketbombi: infact they wud loose an 2 imps here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 20 runs 32 balls decent target for them|pg||
nt|shevek: if east makes this (likely) EW will get some imps here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andreasw:  2nt show's what i dont really know this precision system|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not one spade |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes 1@S seems normal|pg||
nt|sybarra: no interference and 1 @C-1 @H, 2 nt, -3 nt|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2/4th leads|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oh 20 balls 32 runs sorry|pg||
nt|sga1: max 1 imp|pg||
nt|xenya: hard to see how this can fail|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no reason why he shd not|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is Harbhajan a national hero now after his match-winning 6 against Pakistan yesterday?|pg||
nt|shevek: sry, just noticed, in OR north played in 3@c one off|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|panja: they bid 1@D on many different hands..|pg||
nt|shevek: so, yes Sudhir, 1 imp to EW|pg||
nt|suketbombi: has nine trick in majors will get 1 imp anyway|pg||
nt|suketbombi: national hero yes he always was SING IS KING:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: everything splits  so slam is on|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  agree, even 3nt with AQ @h makes more sense|pg||
pc|d9|nt|drkvas: yes tough to bid after the intervention iwd say foolish to bid|pg||
nt|sga1: will loose 1 imp|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|suketbombi: better game contract than 3nt this one|pg||
pc|d6|nt|panja: it does not promise @D I guess, just a relay..|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: this can be made but really needs some good guessing |pg||
nt|yo_yo: Venky is short of entries to take his finesses|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||

nt|yo_yo: actually I dont bid enough slams|pg||

nt|vugraphzhs: yes...all back now|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: me and venky had taken a smoke break|pg||
nt|drkvas: a little unfortunate too |pg||
nt|drkvas: i mean the 4@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  it should have been a push board... no reason for W not to bid|pg||
nt|drkvas: rt|pg||
nt|sga1: OR playing in 3N.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: @d was discarded on 3rd @s so was left with 3 @h east...|pg||
nt|granguru: a trap hand|pg||
nt|granguru: a NHNH|pg||
nt|granguru: or noone has nothing hand|pg||
nt|granguru: bath room again?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: yes all back now|pg||
nt|sga1: As no one smokes there it has to be a bathroom break only.|pg||
nt|granguru: they needed to comb themselves...press is here|pg||
nt|sga1: :) :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: n/s were discussing if 3@d x would have been passed for penalty|pg||
mb|1H|nt|drkvas: 59 in 5 for all practical purposes the match is over|pg||
mb|2C|nt|panja: 5@D good sac on B37....|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Anal Shah will take over ...brb 5 mins|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they get in bidding ? |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: michaels cue bid  showing @S and a minor|pg||
nt|panja: hi Anal..|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: hi panja|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andyv:  those playing weak/strong michaels might just bid 1@s with this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: red sacs are not easy however |pg||
nt|panja: no easy at this Vul|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i prefer to show a 2 suited hand as South|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you Kath |pg||
nt|panja: N shd bid 4@D and leave it to S to judge the rest|pg||
nt|sybarra: want to get this hand off my chest quickly |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: difficult now, when East bids again Ariz might take him for a stronger hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: but bidding 1@D has worked OK|pg||
nt|drkvas: sry 6|pg||
nt|granguru: 10s will play roles here|pg||
nt|shevek: hmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: will take a 5 min brak after this board|pg||
nt|xenya: aggressive|pg||
nt|shevek: 2NT not my choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  it helps in partnerships to have a firm guideline as to how good or bad your michaels bid can be|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c by EW will have some difficulty with the bad @d break, but 3N should work|pg||
nt|sga1: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: the Michaels weak or strong (but not inbetween) seems popular|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is a 14 count that is more oriented to defence than to @ss|pg||
nt|panja: I guess they won't venture now...|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt it is N taking the sac if anyone does it will be S |pg||
nt|andyv:  @s shift after this|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: @s lead|pg||
nt|sga1: @h switch|pg||
nt|xenya: not mine either, with just Ax as a stopper and only 8 hcp|pg||
nt|sga1: trying to create swing now.|pg||
nt|xenya: i think the natural @HK lead should defeat it |pg||
nt|shevek: good to bid , good to lead, @hK|pg||
nt|shevek: the vulnerability was right for west to be aggressive|pg||
nt|shevek: only 50s as they say....|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|andreasw:  if they are lucky they will end up in 5@d 11 tricks but this dosen tlook good|pg||
nt|andyv:  E truly falling in love with his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: need to check east hands,,,might be dealt differnt cards :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  but then again 5@d would problebly fail with @s 4-2|pg||
nt|panja: could make on Xruff..|pg||
nt|drkvas: i see only 8 if def correctly|pg||
nt|sga1: E chose to overcall 1@s in other room. Is that right? or that is the style today.|pg||
nt|shevek: again great lead, definitely Prabhakar man of the match|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  9 imps to Gujarat on board 28 and they take the lead by one|pg||
nt|panja: note the 2@S bid...it shows Blacks...|pg||
nt|drkvas: good|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Neither North nor South did enough here imo|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|panja: but the trouble is W has only 3 Clubs... |pg||
nt|sga1: The strongest hand W has not taken a bid so far.|pg||
nt|granguru: some minimum chance to win|pg||
nt|granguru: almost nil|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  that was interesting|pg||
nt|drkvas: a small little 6imp swing gujarats  way a bit toolittle too  late|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||
nt|panja: after @DA or K, W is going to remove trumps...|pg||
nt|shevek: shd continue|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h3|nt|xenya: what happened here?|pg||
nt|babs59: Has Chotan's 5@D bid silenced everyone?|pg||
nt|xenya: not E, who doubled happily|pg||
nt|sga1: Not E who took out his sword.|pg||
nt|babs59: except for Kista, of course|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: should Vahalia bid again if his partner can only bid 2@S?|pg||
nt|drkvas: dec not having@s 10 is almost certain|pg||
nt|suketbombi: donno strange :(|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|andyv:  almost looks like W passed a cue bid but, as Andreas pointed out, @ds are the best contract|pg||
nt|sga1: OR in 4@S likely to make as @S was led.|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|andreasw:  W did good by passing 4@d|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|panja: With E showing @C as well, it is a double fit for EW....so...4@D by N first time is not excessively risky...|pg||

nt|sga1: -1|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|hJ|nt|suketbombi: well contaray to beleif it is more paying to bid a vul game than a NV game a Vul game is good if the probability is more than 38% to make it while NV needs to be 44% for the pay ...|pg||

mb|1C|nt|ritong: i think yes|pg||
nt|ritong: and the 2@s answer will solve the problem|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|cuttysark: Which suggests East may not be strong enough to overcall 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: assuming east does o/c 1NT, of course|pg||

nt|xenya: well played -- S was unlikely to lead from a doubleton holding QJx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and best if he brings his rabbi |pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||

nt|yo_yo: that's the end of the @H suit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andreasw:  a @d round now|pg||
nt|xenya: kibitzers point out that S could beat it by returning a @H at tricks 4 -- very true |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: and taaadaaaa as they say |pg||
nt|granguru: @C5 lead because they lead low from xx|pg||
nt|suketbombi: now is the moment|pg||
nt|xenya: previous hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  E needed at least the 7@h to be able to lead the 10.. should have just lead 4th best @h|pg||

nt|shevek: true, only 1 imp this time|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  very impatient defense... 1N is the most difficult contract to play as declarer and also to defend|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a claim coming up I would think |pg||
nt|babs59: and Chotan's @d9 asked for a heart too, I expect (last hand)|pg||

nt|andyv:  I don't think I'd do anything that was remotely dangerous if I were NS today... like crossing a street...|pg||
nt|sybarra: hardly matters at the end of the day |pg||

nt|suketbombi: will shift to @D 7 still hard to get 7 tricks for def|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: thy may go +1 here |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I can certainly understand playing 3 as white v white (not vul) |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Venky is very steady, conservative and does not give anything away and should compliment Kista's brilliance very well|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: 4@d 1 down board yet to be played in open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: board 33|pg||
nt|granguru: I want to say that 3@H or even 4@H would have been a rather normal contract|pg||
nt|suketbombi: one looser in every suit here should make 3 for 1 imp pick up|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: right andy,  just need the "experience"  (some days nothing right) |pg||
nt|drkvas: yes andy more days like this than the otherway round for me atleast:(|pg||
nt|sga1: Here simple and quiet bidding.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|andyv:  plus for W are the 10s... minus is the fact that hand is full of quacks and no distribution.... you might invite only because of the vul.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Ariz cant get to hand for @S finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: what I love about the jrs  (as a rule)  the are just living thru and laugh a lot |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  we remember these days more vividly:)|pg||
nt|sga1: absolutely.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|granguru: as the distribution of the suit is terrible, no way to win such a contract here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: he might try another Rabbi's finesse|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: ?|pg||
nt|xenya: impossible i think -- they are just setting up 7th trick for declarer|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yo_yo: for those who dont know the rabbi's finesse is dropping the singleton King offside|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: not that he was unable to do it himself|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y cannot beat this nt tho 3@CS 2@DS & a@H is best defence can get|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ....|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|shevek: declarer refused the @c finesse|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: Sunil we have also seen the "personalities" of N/S  |pg||
nt|sybarra: club pls,  did the 7 of @H ask for that?|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems many jrs.  just think this is part of learning   |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|drkvas: the score sheet does not reflect the capabilities of ns both are very fine players this is one of those days|pg||
pc|cT|pg||

nt|andyv:  2/1 odds on that play |pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: needs the hook I think |pg||
nt|shevek: going 2 off now|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
nt|andreasw:  a small would have been right|pg||
nt|suketbombi: does not have the claim button there|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile, 2@H in the other room went down -- 5 imps to the trailing team|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2H!|nt|ritong: so, 5@c looks more likely than 3 NT|pg||
nt|mrdct: very thin but good enough|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: hard to bid 3NT now that East has shown spades (assuming this is a transfer)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|offthebend: 3NT / 4H/ 5C -- all make - let's see where they get to  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: rambo style by south|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cuttysark: All right, quite easy to bid 3NT - do you think South has shown or denied a stopper?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mrdct: totally denied if they play lebensohl|pg||
nt|offthebend: UNdiscussed Lebensohl over TRF :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am told he has denied one - North must be worried at this moment|pg||
nt|ritong: somewhat, yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: but north has nowhere to go and just needs to hope p has half a stopper|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: My personal preference is for 3NT to show a stopper: then when we do not have one there is room to look for somewhere else to play|pg||
nt|ritong: ain t that cute|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|d9|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|mc|11|nt|mrdct: claiming|pg||
nt|offthebend: With AK6543 -- suit is very likely to get blocked anyway unless partner has 3 cards including 2 and they are 6-3-2-2 |pg||
