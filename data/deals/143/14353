nt|yo_yo: yes good for them!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: like these claims as operator:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: easy to get carried away by that lovely south hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do they play strong NT?|pg||
nt|andyv:  precision|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if so  here it comes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's the range?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: e/w nt 14-15...n/s 15-17|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand looks NTish no matter what the range is|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y es ok 6 imps and west bengal B is now in lead|pg||
nt|wygbe1: south would have to suppress his major, which is reasonable given the secondary cards and spots in the other suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: ty mahesh|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sybarra: 6 @D might be more likely |pg||
nt|yo_yo: now  what do NS play as defence?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hello, Shirley, hi to all|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps easier also |pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Sveta, welcome |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wouldnt pass|pg||
mb|1H|nt|suketbombi: true but a 4-4-3-2 is always a good reason not to supress|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  2@s look normal|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6 card major, too much chance of a game for NS|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: if 2/1 ish, E has not reason to go leaping around yet |pg||
nt|sybarra: but this bidding may stop them in 4 @S |pg||

mb|p|nt|wygbe1: 6d is a terrible contract but can be made if you can see through the cards|pg||
nt|suketbombi: show up squeeze after the minors are through|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4 @S shut the auction off |pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|sfoxa:  hm, it looks like close to major game for NS, but @s or @h prevails?|pg||

nt|panja: 6@D for NS..not easy to get there though|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: gosh, no weak 2, no multi from south|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|nt|sybarra: but alas 3 tricks for e/w more likely |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i might double with the West hand  andy|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  easier now|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|panja: this is the moment of truth...|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 4@D is likely to prevail due to friendly @SS inspite of bad @D break|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: yes it's not great, 10 high|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sybarra: could make all the tricks now |pg||

pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: easy for us at this "altitude"  playing for @S's  2/2|pg||

nt|yo_yo: and North will hopefully have a 2 suited bid available|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 3N by EW unless N is active|pg||
nt|wygbe1: south had to guess to preserve entries to spade, as opposed to looking for 22 diamonds|pg||
nt|suketbombi: cud easily have made this one knowing the heart threat|pg||

mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: i prefer to bid @H but Gupta obviously knows what he is doing  (i hope)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  interesting deal - EW can manage +130 or 140, but NS can preempt with @c |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|andreasw:  thsi dos not look good for N-S|pg||
nt|andyv:  the price is not right for N on this one|pg||
nt|yo_yo: why did Gupta have to bid at all|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes could make by just playing to set up spades and planning on losing 2d and 1c - by managing entries better 42 spades good enuf|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  no, S was silent|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andyv:  because of you, Kath|pg||
nt|suketbombi: true|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 3@d bid by S almost looks as if someone misbid... maybe S thought N's 2@s showed @s and @ds?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  or missunderstood 2@d?|pg||
nt|andyv:  or @s and another (not clubs) and 3@d was pass or correct|pg||

nt|panja: EW can make 3@D or 1N here..and NS will make 2@H...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  but this margin is tiny indeed - next one board and...|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andreasw:  yes should be 11-13 and 7 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: we are on the same wave length :)|pg||

nt|panja: perhaps only 7 tricks in @H on good defence|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: will be glad no higher than 2 |pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: n-s will do to get a @C parial here|pg||

nt|suketbombi: oops 4@S is interesting here|pg||
mb|4H!|an|cue|nt|andyv:  hard to comment on the 6@s bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i sympathise with Gupta , he has an enormous hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  yes. good decision to stop as low as possible. seems reasonable, if partner is limited to 15|pg||
mb|4S!|an|cue|nt|andreasw:  S look his partner in the eye's and saw @s AKQ and went to slam only problem was that N blink to many times|pg||

mb|4N|nt|andyv:  rkc might have taken care of that problem|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|suketbombi: with @D over ruff positio will end up lossing 3 @Ss and a@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and then S has the bad break to contend with |pg||
nt|andyv:  always a bad policy to chase bad results|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i cant bring myself to say WD :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: cant lead @c with KX west...|pg||
nt|sybarra: my other comment would be "not great defense" |pg||

mb|1H|nt|sybarra: does N say X or just bid spades? |pg||

nt|vugraphzhs: you missed Roland slam last board Raju :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andreasw:  another strong @c?|pg||
nt|panja: interesting play |pg||
nt|panja: @HQ will get ducked I guess..but W has @DK entry for @H's|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has Vahalia shown 5@D and 4@C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe just clubs so far |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: should be good result for n/s this board...5@c or 5@d|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope they dont bid another slam |pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: we will have to tell you soccer scores then |pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: watching on net :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: 0-1 55 mins|pg||
nt|sybarra: (the window behind vugraph ) |pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but this one doesn't look that strong|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes should be 5/4 either way|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhs: yes..with this slow play can see score atleast|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at least, this board is "nothing special"|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: but still |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 5/4 either way, thanks to specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: Vahalia thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: being red may slow him down |pg||
nt|yo_yo: bid up Vahalia!|pg||
mb|d|nt|sfoxa:  may be, try @h and fast claim?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: obviously, 3n was going down, but south didnt like position of club k for defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 6-4 bid one more |pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult to Ariz to bid after a slow double|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  normal contract|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the lead is with North (poor thing)|pg||
nt|andyv:  @h|pg||
nt|andreasw:  with gupta two bids they could have ende't up in 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ai |pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  which will give W a chance to dump 2 @ds after pulling 2 rounds of trump|pg||

nt|suketbombi: was a good board for gujrat but -5 now|pg||

pc|cT|nt|sunsamvar: I have great hopes for the Kista Venky pair..|pg||
nt|andreasw:  only 2 imp's diffrent|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sybarra: thy may go +1 here |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I can certainly understand playing 3 as white v white (not vul) |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Venky is very steady, conservative and does not give anything away and should compliment Kista's brilliance very well|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|vugraphzhs: 4@d 1 down board yet to be played in open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzhs: board 33|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  plus for W are the 10s... minus is the fact that hand is full of quacks and no distribution.... you might invite only because of the vul.|pg||
