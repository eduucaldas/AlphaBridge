mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: what is the difference between 1@s and X in this sequence? for me X is on a 4-card @s suit|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|jcmax: It is really a matter of style. x= 4+ is becoming increasingly popular. the idea is to make opener declarer whenever possible.|pg||
nt|warrens:  and to avoid bidding 1nt from the wrong side|pg||

nt|jcmax: Another deal with swing potential. it is easy to see how NS can make game in @S. But it is equally easy to see how they can go down in it...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even negative doubles, perhaps the best convention ever introduced (my opinion), has some downsides|pg||
nt|warrens:  a 20-point game here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If I was allowed only one convention on my card, I would choose negative doubles|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Roland! no penalties in modern bidding|pg||
nt|warrens:  since they play 14-16 nt's, N is less likely to invite.  but he still might|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  the advantage of South's hand is only 1 point in @H's|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And that he has four of them. Partner rates to have a singleton on this auction|pg||

nt|jcmax: Not only that, the hand is also control-rich!|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s3|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he's down on repeated heart plays, unless declarer guesses every card, including the spade 9|pg||
nt|jcmax: Many partnerships play suit preference when there is a singleton in dummy, but apparently EW here don't|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They do, but Cohen had a plan because he has four trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Welland will work that out|pg||
nt|jcmax: If E held the @D AQ instead of the @CAQ, a @D switch might not be the worst idea ever.|pg||
nt|jcmax: But you are very right ofc roland. W was looking at his 4-card trump holding, and he had a plan|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the stiff @s 10 as well as the 5-card @h suit, can create problems for a count on E|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if he guesses hearts, he is likely to guess diamonds too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or is the @h position quite clear?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: guesses spades I mean|pg||
nt|jcmax: But the thing I don't understand, roland, is, if they indeed play suit preference signals, why would E play thr @H7 at trick 1?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy for us to take 10 tricks. Perhaps it's nothing but double dummy|pg||

nt|Walddk4: To be fair, East allowed 4@S to make when Welland made a tiny error|pg||
