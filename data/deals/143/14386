nt|lml: it looks like 6@C will make if they get there|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lml: 6NT might too but that will require locating the @HJ|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to bid a slam in minor after a balanced 20-21 opening|pg||
nt|lml: North has a nice hand though|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|lml: he could transfer to clubs after a 2NT rebid|pg||
mb|2N|an|21-22|nt|peachy: S hand control rich so he upgraded to 2C reasonably|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: but if Bates show tha hand as 22-23, then N will go for slam|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: but he will start with Stayman|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lml: he can afford to be in 4NT|pg||
nt|lml: I assume 4@C is natural here|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lml: you have 10 and texture and some shape... |pg||
nt|lml: you got to try|pg||
nt|peachy: the system summary does not go into details so lets assume nat for now:)|pg||
mb|4D!|an|KCB|nt|lml: 4@D is a cuebid|pg||
nt|lml: and cooperation|pg||
nt|pelu: can u exp the bidding in CR - over 4@C (naturel) S bid 4@s - I see that as a cue with no @h-stop???|pg||
nt|lml: or RKC|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lml: as here|pg||
nt|lml: her has a keycard so 4@S would ask for the @CQ presumably|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Maybe 4@c was Keycard in the other room?|pg||
nt|peachy: many good players avoid using 4NT as RKC when minor is agreed or implied|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: and use something lower on the 4-level for that|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: what sh be trumph ?, Jan|pg||
nt|lml: once South started with 2@C the slam was not too hard to reach|pg||
nt|lml: a lot of people use 4@D as keycard over clubs even if notrump is not bid|pg||
nt|peachy: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: 2@c followed by 2N showed 21-22 I think (at least he wrote 21-22 on the notepad)|pg||
nt|peachy: or what one might call "the unfocused major" if one major has been bid by either partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: If 4@c was RKC, it must have been for clubs - I don't really know what they do though - possible that 4@s was RKC|pg||
nt|lml: both tables got to the good club slam |pg||
nt|lml: as one might hope for at this level|pg||
nt|lml: lets guess what Harris will lead|pg||
nt|lml: I think a trump|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  Hi Folks :)|pg||
nt|pelu: only a @s-lead will give decl probelms|pg||
nt|peachy: oftentimes when they are missing a keycard, it pays to try to develop a side trick, so I wouldn't be surprised at spade lead|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  It is played from short side|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: East & North thought that North was the declarer and so East led a spade out of turn on his side of the screen and at the same time West led a club from his side - the director has ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: said that the club lead stands and the spade is a penalty card|pg||

pc|c7|nt|pelu: sorry - then @S-lead just nice for decl :(:|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|pelu: 1@D - 1S - 1Nt and now a @H bid (invitation acording to their system)|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: good bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: I guess it's not too bad, puts them to a tough guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if -500 only small loss, but upside is huge|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: and for 2 imps, seems good to me I suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  so what is 2@c then:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: I exp that they play 2@C = relay to 2@C and 2@H = invitation with 5-4 in major|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHPL3: double checkback maybe|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHPL3: then 2@d automat and 2@h 5@s, 4@h inv|pg||
nt|marlowepi: anyway most likely outcome after 4H bid is -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: inthe X-Y-NT convention: 2@D = GF |pg||
nt|andreasw:  so it is x-y?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C = relay to 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 12-11 very normal to stop in partscore|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i mean from N point of view, -500 would be very pessimistic|pg||
