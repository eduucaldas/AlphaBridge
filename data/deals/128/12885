mb|5H|an|2 with Q|nt|lestergold: if 4@c a void why blackwood?|pg||
nt|finch: unless 4@C showed a void they might think they are off keycard|pg||
nt|finch: I assume 4@C was shortage, not a void|pg||
nt|lestergold: im told its a void|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Some play it as specifically a void, but others play 4m = nat 5-5|pg||
mb|6H|an|!HK|mb|p|mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well i think a bit of guessing involved but the right guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: better for south to have bid 4@d over 4@c so north could then bid blackwood|pg||
nt|finch: No easy way to find out about the queen of hearts. South just hoping North isn't KJ10xxx Kxx Axxx -|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: however cold grabnsa are not always reached so this cant be bad for Dunn|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: the point is that control should b passd to North because North is looking at the fillin catds in hearts and can fin d ouit what he needs to knwo  from south|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|viren169: What do others make of the 4@S bid?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jallerton: but even if 4@S had gone off, it would still have been a good advance save vs 3NT|pg||
mc|9|nt|viren169: Dunn pushing ahead...|pg||
nt|dburn: reasonable enough - 2@s then 3@s not especially constructive, so can't do that|pg||
pg||

mb|1D|mb|3C|nt|othered1: Maybe the south hand would be better handled by a different approach, though south will usually not find herself at the 4-level |pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: Then she can ask for 3rd round control later|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|nt|lestergold: what a punt! and i thinl its a lucky maKE|pg||
nt|finch: the alternative over 3@C is to pass, I think 4@S is preferable although it is obviously a guess|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|chick: how about 4@C instead of 4@S?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: south does have to get to dummy for @S play and must go right in which suit to play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|finch: The WJO helps locate the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: ARD RIGHT HERE|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: everfy card right|pg||
nt|othered1: but if h e leads @H, they get @H ruff|pg||
nt|finch: 4@C over 3@C would usually show a game forcing raise in diamonds|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: about 5% contract needing spades for one loser hearts for one lose and dim finesse|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|rmb1: I think a heart switch at trick 2 would take four tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybne a little more but not high|pg||
nt|finch: yes, it's a poor game because partner opened on a 10-count with a singleton spade|pg||
