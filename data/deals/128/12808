nt|mdgraham: defence has lost the spade ruff|pg||
mc|9|nt|henryb:  a comedy: declarer was cold. the defense could have cashed for 2 down, and declarer makes it in the end|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps N should play the @h9 on the first trump to signal for a spade return|pg||
nt|april7: what do you think about a X istead of bidding 1@H, because of 4 card @S suit?|pg||
nt|henryb:  yuch|pg||
nt|april7: is it yuch or much?|pg||
nt|henryb:  do you really intend to pass partner's diamond response? or show a monster by bidding your hearts after doubling?|pg||
nt|henryb:  YYYYYuch|pg||
nt|april7: in this case it shows at least 5 @H and 4@S without additional strength in my system|pg||
nt|april7: the reason is you might lose a @S fit,think about it|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would not mind a delayed double: over 3@c. that would bring spades back into the picture|pg||
nt|april7: you might not have the time|pg||
nt|henryb:  meanwhile Nab-Drijver missed a game |pg||
nt|april7: y, and 5@S is good defence|pg||
nt|henryb:  You play an unusual system: many play that double followed by a correction of clubs to diamonds does not show extras|pg||
nt|henryb:  but few (at least here) play that a correction to hearts does not show extras|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|april7: now the contract is in danger|pg||
pc|cT|nt|henryb:  Negative doubles occur only after an opening bid and an overcall. e.g. 1@d - 1@s - X is negative|pg||
nt|vugraphzfm: Bareket........|pg||
nt|april7: I agree, so reopening X|pg||
nt|henryb:  how can he lose more than two trumps from here?|pg||
nt|april7: he can't|pg||
nt|henryb:  reopening doubles occur only after the opponents reach a contract and there are two passes, e.g. 2@s - P - P - X is a reopening double|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|april7: but it was 1@C 1@S 4@S ppX|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  On the 41sX hand, West made a takeout double of 1@s, showing the red suits, then another takeout double of 4@s showing extra strength|pg||
nt|april7: and what if he wants to X for penalties?|pg||
nt|henryb:  No, it was 1@c-P-1@s-X-4@s-P-P-X|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d4|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: if the first double is for take-out, then it is logical for the second double to be take-out also; however East has the option of passing for penalties  |pg||

pc|sA|mc|10|nt|henryb:  well, with A,A,AK wouldn't you like to offer partner the choice of defending? I would|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although if the double shows hearts and spades, there is the question of what 3@D really is - QJ9 seventh?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner can't have hearts and diamonds. Then he would just bid 3@D over 3@C|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|s2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: where North really really wants to play in 3@D|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
