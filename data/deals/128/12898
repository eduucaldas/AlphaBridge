pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: well if its 15-17 then west should have opened it a nt altho upgrading to a 2n rebid not as absurd as east's action after the 2N bid|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|fifee: its important to value your hand properly, usually just HCPs is not enough but with NT openers, very risky to give extra points for 5 cd suits etc|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: With some partners I have to pass the south hand because the suit isn't good enough to bid 2 and the hand not good enough to bid 1.  But that's very old-fashioned.|pg||

nt|bucheister: anyone for 3C by E|pg||

mb|4C|an|!|nt|bucheister: neither is the suit|pg||
nt|chick: no, not even NV, .... a fine player once told me, "if you don't got nothing, don't bid nothing" :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct:  different pairs play different meanings of doubles of splinters|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C lead at 6 went away.|pg||
nt|peachy: I am not so sure X is even good here, spade lead might be normal and better, who knows|pg||
nt|mrdct:  north is wondering why the opponents haven't mentioned their massive @C fit|pg||
nt|bucheister: so am I|pg||
nt|mrdct:  stiff A opposite a splinter is not a good holding|pg||
nt|othered1: 3 Aces are good.  @C duplication bad. relatively weak trumps?|pg||
nt|chick: I'd be more inclined to say 4@S with W's hand|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i think 4@H is pretty clearcut by north here|pg||
mb|4D|an|!|mb|p|nt|bucheister: agreed you cannot be passive with that type of hand and expect to win|pg||
nt|peachy: mm, he went with the "aces"|pg||
nt|chick: I like 4@D, N still doesn't know how strong S is |pg||
nt|chick: should cooperate in slam try|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't @Stold for E tolead now? Corlenia:)|pg||
nt|peachy: this is an interesting topic, what does splinter show|pg||
nt|othered1: south has an interesting hand, but no aces.|pg||
nt|peachy: there are couple different schools of thought|pg||
nt|mrdct:  and no @H key cards|pg||
nt|othered1: some require specific numbers of side controls, others trump quality.  Most are generic.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chick: S should now bid the simple 4@H|pg||
nt|bucheister: too many theories to talk about; every pair has a different idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct:  now 4@S by west?|pg||
nt|chick: nothing else to say|pg||
nt|peachy: some think it is limited, some play split range|pg||
nt|othered1: Now does west act?|pg||
nt|bucheister: what is W waiting for|pg||
nt|chick: waiting in ambush :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: the check raise!|pg||

nt|othered1: north is thinking that 4 isn't cold|pg||
nt|bucheister: had a chance to pick up a few imps by just bidding his hand|pg||
nt|chick: has to find the @DQ or the @HK |pg||
nt|mrdct:  on brd 24 - the poles have stopped in 4NT in the closed room which might be enough to win the match if they make it|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|othered1: That clear @S bid can be taken apart if north has the @CA and some length here, as the defense has an effective roadmap in that case.|pg||
nt|chick: I'm not so sure it was that clear ... suit was broken, 16 HCP, opps forcing game .. partner must have nothing|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|an|!|nt|mrdct:  should reach it easily with the double fit in @S and @D|pg||
nt|rodal f: So here we have AA against ZZ as a spec pointed:)|pg||
nt|mrdct:  south will make some sort of @H raise here|pg||
nt|peachy: i wonder why Dbl alrted|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|an|!|nt|mrdct:  dbl probably shows 4+ @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Y does|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: right, which was my "prob". Is neg Dbl alerted in Australia?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mrdct:  with no screens, no doubles are alerted in Aust , but with screens you alert everything|pg||
nt|chick: the prob with that X is that it is pretty strong for a conventional neg X|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps in system 1S would not be "spades", I am just guessing|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: That's what it looks like|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|mrdct:  solid start for Consus - if this match comes down to the wire this wont a potential pick-up for goren|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h8|nt|mrdct:  they might use 1@S as 8-10 balanced or similar|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mrdct:  beer card position emerging|pg||
mc|11|nt|rodal f: As I saw this board it was min 10 tricks and always 11 by @SQ on so a push|pg||
nt|othered1: That's an increasingly common method|pg||
nt|peachy: I have too reasons to root for Horen: they are undersdogs now (I always root for underdogs) and  they are juniors (always root  for juniors)|pg||
nt|mrdct:  nah - he can't safely rectify the count for the beer card now|pg||

nt|mrdct:  this one looks like a slam for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: brb|pg||
nt|mrdct:  until you look at the EW cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any to go in the bare by the NS tables here?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  actually slam is pretty marginal|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|peachy: even with even some breaks, handling problems|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  north would be bit more excited if he had some values in @D once the @C fit is found|pg||
nt|othered1: AS they say, A Roland Slam.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|peachy: nah, Roland slams slip home:)|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if 2N shows extras in their style?|pg||
nt|rodal f: :) A hand for him, but stil to bad even there|pg||
mb|3H|an|!|mb|p|nt|chick: I think it will be hard for them to stay out of slam|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess 3@H may imply @C fit.|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the aussie juniors are seeking funds to play in the White House Tournament later this month - info on ways you can help are at http://www.ozjuniorbridge.com/|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am not shure as long as N have 5@S ED. Else it does|pg||
nt|othered1: If north has shown opening NT values, this may peter out.  If he hasn't promised extras yet . .. |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|chick: well, they ARE juniors, after all ... they fpm peter out :)|pg||
nt|mrdct:  now is where adam's lack of a @D card should ring alarm bells|pg||
nt|chick: fpm|pg||
nt|chick: don't*|pg||
mb|4H|nt|othered1: Frankly, I think north is done, unless he has more extras.|pg||
nt|mrdct:  they are juniors but are well and truly amongst australia's top open players now|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct:  that double will help put the brakes on|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: One of told. Are EW helping NS not to bid 6@C?|pg||
nt|othered1: some play that south's pass over the double is meaningful.  Others just nothing more to say|pg||
nt|mrdct:  south hasn't cued a 2nd round @H control so there is one loser and @D are by no means sewn-up|pg||
nt|chick: N still thinking about it :)|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Can be bough still. Or not ED?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: south is also done, as north hasn't guaranteed @SA,  has he?|pg||
nt|mrdct:  so far so good - but 5@C may not be safe either|pg||
nt|rodal f: I waited 4@S and 5@C from S as a small invit for 6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: not at all as the cards lie.|pg||
nt|peachy: close, I think me night make|pg||
nt|peachy: *he|pg||
nt|mrdct:  he doesn't really have a lot of clues about the bad break|pg||
nt|mrdct:  could easily lose @HK and 2 trumps|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|chick: there is a way to hold to 1 trump loser now, but will take great imagination to do it|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|othered1: I assume west routinely leads low from a doubleton|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|mrdct:  if he plays @C for 1 loser he cant ruff teh @D good|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: Only one thing to say. A fare 6@C normaly. 3-2 and u are over 50%. But E gave a warn.. Again NS at this?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|othered1: He's making this if he reads the hand, I think|pg||
nt|mrdct:  this will be the last board of the match in the other room|pg||
nt|chick: if they are quick here, we might get to watch it twice :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|othered1: west can be trump endplayed|pg||
nt|mrdct:  declarer has entry problems|pg||
nt|rodal f: Cornelia? I only quick at one place. And that is to go at bed.        For sleep.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: and to the specs.....you are the BEST   thx for comments and humor |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: kind regards shirley|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 5@c in open seems a strange place to play with 3N so straightforward|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: seems like they wandered into in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@c of course is not abad contract in theory|pg||
nt|sybarra: and where are |pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" going |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: fortunately no furtgher|pg||
nt|sybarra: good enough |pg||
nt|sybarra: N probably unhappy at moment,  wait till he sees all 4 hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: I amtrying to figure out how 5@c was made|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: that lead wont hurt declarer |pg||
nt|lestergold: im told that declarer endplayed west in trumps|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: no probs in this contract|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: N planning play|pg||
nt|lestergold: after club position shows up dims play for 4 tricks bringing total to a comfrotable ten|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to take the @D hook first imo|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: well ok second |pg||
pc|s3|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Consus have beaten Klinger|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|sybarra: wow quite a result |pg||
nt|lestergold: seveal ways to play dims here|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he goes for double finesse 75% a priori he is doomed|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: the next matches will start in one hour from now.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.qldbridge.com/gcc/index.php |pg||
nt|sybarra: for those asking for website,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: take a look at venue!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: cashing AK works for ll three three breraks and all 4/2 breaks where either ten or q is doubleton im not sure of percentages but also fairly high|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: having gone for the finesse of 9 he has to logically follow it up with the second finesse|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: The Gold Coast Convention centre is amazing.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Those of you on the other side of theworld should definately venture out for the GCC 50th|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am not sure who will be in next matches on vugraph |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Will notify of matches ASAP|pg||
