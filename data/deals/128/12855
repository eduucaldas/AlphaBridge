mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bibanu: hi|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: if my calculations are correct Midt-Trøndelag is in front by 2 vps before the last 16. Møre&Romsdal in turn 2 vps in front of Hordaland, who are 1 vp  ahead of Nord-Trøndelag. That ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: is with the first 16 counted and given a match result|pg||
nt|mr murray: way too heavy. 2n/t is much more descriptive|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mr murray: he is thinking that chun has shown extras. He might be sorry.|pg||
nt|peachy: but alls well when end is well|pg||
nt|mr murray: partner saved him|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: this makes easily, could maybe even take 10 tricks |pg||
pc|c3|nt|hantveit: except on blw. The broders using a, for me, strange system where you answer before you have been asked.|pg||
nt|jbgood: Based on the NBF Data results after 8 rounds and the live update scores registered|pg||
nt|panja: they bid a game 11 opp 11...with 13+11, they are bidding a little more carefully|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|panja: 14+11 rather|pg||

pc|c2|nt|jbgood: kan du sjekke om de trenger noen i lukket? her er vi tre |pg||
nt|panja: only 9 top tricks...|pg||
nt|panja: and now with @S 44...there will be a problem|pg||
nt|peachy: West should continue hearts, ten probably, but not sure so easy to see|pg||
nt|peachy: or if I am right|pg||
nt|panja: GIB shows @HT will kill the contract..it will because...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|othered1: This could be a 2-way swing, since 4@D is makable NS if you get @H into play early enough|pg||
nt|imp_jan: easy heart switch|pg||
nt|imp_jan: decl plays low|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and then it's made|pg||
nt|peachy: Gib says yes|pg||
nt|panja: after winning Decl will have to remove trumps..|pg||
nt|panja: but then there will be only 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|panja: say he tries to get his ruff before..by playing a small Club..|pg||
nt|panja: E will win and back a @S...|pg||
nt|bucheister: Hi everyone; I am John Buchheister and will commenting in the Closed Room.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|panja: now, S can win @SA, cash @CA, ruff a @C with @SQ pull trumps...but now...he cannot enjoy @H6|pg||
pc|c8|nt|panja: because @H9 blocks it|pg||
nt|peachy: i think it will be difficult to defend at both tables, regardless of lead|pg||
nt|panja: one kib suggests S drop @H9 under @HK if W played @HT..|pg||
nt|panja: that will not work either because E, after winning @CQ, will back a @D..|pg||
nt|panja: now...S cannot play a @H to finesse against West's @H85 combination before removing trumps..|pg||
nt|panja: and after removing trumps, he has not entry back to hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: Sidney is still thinking|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzce: this 2D is so-called "Ji Kwuang" convention|pg||
pc|dA|nt|peachy: diamonds sitting a little foul for them|pg||

nt|peachy: disciplined|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mr murray: even if he guess diamonds right he is still a trick short.|pg||
nt|mr murray: If he doesn't the roof will collapse.|pg||

nt|vugraphzce: There are some problems for the leading|pg||

pc|d8|nt|rodal f: My we Inwite Walter from US?:))))|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm straining my eyes to see if it could make, prbably not|pg||
nt|mr murray: 1 club was plenty. guess partner didnt believe he opened light lead directional when opponents just wizzed to a game :)|pg||
nt|peachy: I like it that if third seat light 1m, it is always lead directional, 1M different|pg||
nt|mr murray: u bet|pg||

nt|bucheister: standard precision auction; 1C 16+; 1nt 8-12; game|pg||
nt|bucheister: the change in position of nt probably will gain a trick|pg||

nt|peachy: I assume E treats this as singlesuiter again|pg||
nt|peachy: aah, it was not a singlesuiter, three options|pg||
nt|panja: but the dbl isn't business here..it is conventional..both Majors or one minor, or a strong hand..|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mr murray: these guys are bidders. They wont miss any games.|pg||
nt|panja: so...it almost gives up on penalising 1Nt|pg||

nt|vugraphzce: another interesting bidding sequence|pg||

nt|lmeili: Lin & Liu are not regular partner, so they might have no agreement on this|pg||

nt|mr murray: no getting away from it now. 5 diamonds so comphy|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzce: Liu wrote "3C" on the paper to west|pg||

pc|d6|nt|rodal f: YYY|pg||
nt|panja: 2Nt might make..it is not all that bad a contract...had S held @DT, it would be cold|pg||
nt|panja: 3@S also has decent chances of making|pg||
nt|peachy: 3S could slip home|pg||
nt|panja: simply concede a small @H..|pg||

nt|othered1: Will east apply "the law" and raise?|pg||
nt|sybarra: a spec suggested 3 nt .....but not sure you can handle even with @D lead |pg||
nt|jbgood: too soft values for a weak jump|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: good game in the open room|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|peachy: this auction might cause declarer to misguess hearts|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Two last board for this segment. By from me but stil luck to Lin and the specs:)|pg||
mb|5N|nt|jbgood: nt game look the more attractive one, yes|pg||
nt|othered1: I might guess you can handle 3N on @D lead|pg||
nt|lmeili: ty|pg||
nt|peachy: another small pickup for Zen Ho|pg||
mb|p|nt|bibanu: interesting action in OR|pg||
nt|lmeili: they play 2 way check back|pg||
nt|lmeili: 2@d gf|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|jbgood: interting to see|pg||
nt|lmeili: this slam quite reasonable but bad luck|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: last two boards here !|pg||
nt|bucheister: as a passed hand S might have tried 3H|pg||
nt|bucheister: would be a great slam to reach|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|sybarra: I think a trick short but lots of spades will make hand uncomfortable fot S |pg||
nt|sybarra: *for|pg||
nt|rodal f: A good 6er. Onlu 28.3% for 4-1|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|othered1: South has to duck @H then will be more than just uncomfortable on @S run|pg||
nt|jbgood: this is the penultimate hand of a long weekend, and some credits are due. The first thanks go to BBO and the NBF for broadcasting this prestigious event. |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lmeili: with no fit of @h N's 2@h bids is reasonable, N can't see the best final contract|pg||
nt|peachy: game is on, with heart guess but as we can see, was misguessed in OP, reasonably|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|jbgood: And of course a big thank you to our excellent operator, Liv Marit Grude, well done!|pg||
nt|othered1: or maybe not|pg||

pc|d7|nt|sybarra: now has to duck the @H all around |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jbgood: hm - another heart from S?|pg||
