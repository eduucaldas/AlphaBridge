nt|peachy: or if I am right|pg||
nt|panja: GIB shows @HT will kill the contract..it will because...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: This could be a 2-way swing, since 4@D is makable NS if you get @H into play early enough|pg||

nt|panja: but then there will be only 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|panja: say he tries to get his ruff before..by playing a small Club..|pg||
nt|panja: E will win and back a @S...|pg||
nt|bucheister: Hi everyone; I am John Buchheister and will commenting in the Closed Room.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|panja: now, S can win @SA, cash @CA, ruff a @C with @SQ pull trumps...but now...he cannot enjoy @H6|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|panja: because @H9 blocks it|pg||
nt|peachy: i think it will be difficult to defend at both tables, regardless of lead|pg||
nt|panja: one kib suggests S drop @H9 under @HK if W played @HT..|pg||
nt|panja: that will not work either because E, after winning @CQ, will back a @D..|pg||
nt|panja: now...S cannot play a @H to finesse against West's @H85 combination before removing trumps..|pg||
nt|panja: and after removing trumps, he has not entry back to hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: Sidney is still thinking|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|panja: the hand is not over yet..|pg||

nt|vugraphzce: another interesting bidding sequence|pg||

nt|lmeili: Lin & Liu are not regular partner, so they might have no agreement on this|pg||
nt|peachy: I think Pass works fine, get the plus that is likely coming|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzce: Liu wrote "3C" on the paper to west|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jbgood: difficult contract, if it can ever be made|pg||
nt|rodal f: By 10HP at S. 1NT or 2@S from u Walter by 2/1?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S|pg||

nt|bucheister: Interesting; no question that 2S is right in MP; what about IMPs; opener if limited to 15hcp; what do you all think|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: YYY|pg||
nt|panja: 2Nt might make..it is not all that bad a contract...had S held @DT, it would be cold|pg||
nt|panja: 3@S also has decent chances of making|pg||
nt|peachy: 3S could slip home|pg||
nt|panja: simply concede a small @H..|pg||

mb|1H|nt|bucheister: 3 more boards to go and the lead is stillover a hundred imps|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: Ure a bit hard but might right. If N had AJ@C and EW had 2-2|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lmeili: EW can make 3@s, 4@h -1 |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzce: Wei De has carryover 13.5 at beginning (added)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lmeili: i had 2 times against Jonky & Herstin play 2@c/X/XX|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are N good enough for that X?. NOPE|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|lmeili: they like to play 2@c/X/xx but this time there is no redouble|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would have loved XX from E there|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: EW can make 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Can't be SOS|pg||
nt|lmeili: usually he deos, but not this time :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|nt|othered1: This start, with west presumably showing good long @D, s hould make slam easy to bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 @d is better than 6@h, but 6 NT even better|pg||
nt|othered1: Can they firmly determine whether west has first or second round @C control?|pg||
nt|jbgood: only by asking verbally, I think:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: it would be something like "har du esset eller kongen, makker?"|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't know their methods, but with many once you're past the usual ace-asking bid, you must find a way indirectly, if at all.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: Maybe in a natural method, east could try 5@S hoping for a 6@C re-cuebid|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|othered1: 5N may have accomplished the same thing|pg||
nt|jbgood: Frank Ove Sandvik, Per Halvorsen, Anders Dale, Geir Husebø, Helge Toft, Harald Bastiansen also won their heat and will be the 3rd Bergen (Hordaland) team in the premier league. ...|pg||

mb|1H|nt|sybarra: not everyones 2 @S...|pg||
nt|othered1: Will east apply "the law" and raise?|pg||
nt|sybarra: a spec suggested 3 nt .....but not sure you can handle even with @D lead |pg||
nt|jbgood: too soft values for a weak jump|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: good game in the open room|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Two last board for this segment. By from me but stil luck to Lin and the specs:)|pg||

nt|lmeili: ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|bibanu: interesting action in OR|pg||

nt|lmeili: 2@d gf|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jbgood: interting to see|pg||
nt|lmeili: this slam quite reasonable but bad luck|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: last two boards here !|pg||
nt|bucheister: as a passed hand S might have tried 3H|pg||
nt|bucheister: would be a great slam to reach|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|sybarra: I think a trick short but lots of spades will make hand uncomfortable fot S |pg||
nt|sybarra: *for|pg||
nt|rodal f: A good 6er. Onlu 28.3% for 4-1|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|othered1: South has to duck @H then will be more than just uncomfortable on @S run|pg||
nt|jbgood: this is the penultimate hand of a long weekend, and some credits are due. The first thanks go to BBO and the NBF for broadcasting this prestigious event. |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lmeili: with no fit of @h N's 2@h bids is reasonable, N can't see the best final contract|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|jbgood: And of course a big thank you to our excellent operator, Liv Marit Grude, well done!|pg||
nt|othered1: or maybe not|pg||

mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|ctcbabbo: again 4s makes on double dummy, thanks to the fav trump position plus the club ficesse|pg||
nt|frankaus: staying out of a red game is unlikely to help the cause|pg||
nt|ctcbabbo: to make 4S, need to win DA and lead a low trump|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||

mb|1S|nt|lmeili: hard to see NS ended at 2@h the worse contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|rodal f: So a self murder squize made by EW? Bought persons|pg||
nt|lmeili: 2@s by S supposed|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|othered1: 6@C or 6N by west are very good|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can 6@H be a good score?|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: 2@D seems not multi|pg||
nt|lmeili: i guessed so, will be M's|pg||
nt|rodal f: 6@C is on but find it|pg||
nt|lmeili: S has no reason to bid 4@c if p has @h pre|pg||
nt|rodal f: As 6@D|pg||
nt|lmeili: 2@d= 6@h or @s + m|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: kibs ask me who are winning.. I really want an answer to that question myself:)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|othered1: I guess 7@C can work, but not a good spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @C setting trump suit now?|pg||
nt|lmeili: let's see if Lin passes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzce: an easy 2@S :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mr murray: strange no method to get other hand to play it. most of time it would be beneficial.|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: this is so-called "Ji Kuang" convention in Taiwan|pg||

pc|d7|nt|lmeili: this is funny for S to bid 2@h, i can agree if he bids 3@c|pg||
