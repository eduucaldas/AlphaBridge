nt|ralfwil: what opening bid from E? 4@h or is he too strong?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes this should be an exciting end to the event|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|sybarra: the question I have is it really poiish club,  I think it has been modified substantially by them|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then, they are both agressive and of course play the hands well....|pg||
nt|hlortz: typical modern bridge all 3 players have bid in front of west who has a decent opening hand:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: probably play in a NT partscore somewhere|pg||

nt|peachy: from NEC Bridge Festival in Yokohama, Japan|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Yokohama in Japan for the 15th NEC Cup. 12 rounds of qualifying (Swiss), 14 boards per match. This is a match from round 7 |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello V|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Apteker-Gower are the "South" part of Team South Sweden -- they're from South Africa|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the heavy promotion of the N hand will likely allow 3N to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have a CC that says NS play Precision with variable NT [sometimes 10-12, other 14-16]|pg||
nt|sybarra: Ish is quite interesting |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||

pc|d6|nt|peachy: i would certainly raise clubs as S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N by N would make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=Puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|sybarra: they found the @S lead in the other room |pg||
nt|marlowepi: case for Slead but H normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's a WBF card from 2008 - so maybe they played for Bulgaria in Beijing|pg||
nt|sybarra: Ish =Del Monte|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even playing walsh style, a passed hand can afford to bid 1D, surely|pg||
pc|dA|nt|peachy: oh well, cant spell|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Raija Davis, Hans Werge and Jim Gordon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the ecats site has a CC for the Italians from the 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I believe Bach's nickname is "ash"|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|chick: 3N doesn't look very makeable to me, but I'm sure you're right :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The 3rd @D might bring some problemes|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings -- not updated for Round 7 yet |pg||
nt|hawe45:  No losing option in slam, I think|pg||

nt|flash: welcome (back), all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings after 6 rounds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @H should make because of the @c discard on the @S Queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and with this lead...|pg||
nt|shevek: here we are, hello everyone, the last round of the swiss|pg||
nt|sybarra2: well it works|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I personally prefer3@H , I hate to treat stiff A as a stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tittade ni på curling i natt, grabbar? Vilken rysare|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Conservative view by Sally Brock here opposite 15-17, but it often pays off at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: natural diamond lead from E, two rounds of clubs, over fast|pg||
nt|peachy: 5C happens to make also, right?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
nt|peachy: W got worried and pulled|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Difficult to find the best lead: @C Ace|pg||
nt|po-s: anyone knows the standings?|pg||
nt|shevek: you're picking Hans :)|pg||
nt|larrymori: yeah i met him in Yokohama|pg||
nt|sybarra: shortly for Ashley   thx Nick |pg||
nt|larrymori: first|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The other semifinal is over I am told. Bulgaria has conceded against Zimmermann|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but after the non-rasie by South, partner figures tohave at least a half stop|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so I'd be sympathetic to 3NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you can't say the cards are well placed though|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: in trick 2: @C and S has to take 3 tricks in minor|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the@D suit is a nightmare|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|flash: a bit harsh to attribute a result to a normal lead?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W helped a bit - now declarer should guess @s correctly|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the redouble indicating that he is playable in @D too ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: XX, means @S longer than @H a spec tells me|pg||
nt|peacokk: Jag somnade i 8:e omgången :(|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: very good auction|pg||
nt|shevek: current results will be updated soon at: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec_bul.html|pg||
nt|shevek: another spec suggests west is too weak to o/call 1NT|pg||
nt|shevek: the formula is (nr of cards in 2 suits) - (number of losers)>=2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: N appreciates his primey hand|pg||
nt|peachy: found the best place|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West endplayed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - otherwise his partner was|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S back is best|pg||
nt|xenya: a somewhat light and risky double by N on just 2 aces|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - anf opener third in hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: -50 could win a few vs. 140|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N getting what he maybe deserved. even so, maybe S should pass 2D...he has probably already shown spade tolerance by passing 1S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - 920 in sight|pg||
nt|shevek: 9-7=2 in this case|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: par contract i suppose at teh end of it all|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chick: pretty amazing lead :)|pg||
nt|peachy: tricky lead...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: logical lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N marked with heart shortness|pg||
nt|peachy: heart indicated by auction, so what can he do, ignore logic, but it is still ricky...|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S 10 was an option|pg||
nt|flash: the trump split will slow declarer down a bit|pg||
nt|xenya: creates a small problem for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  udca|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But no big risk to double 180 instead of 90|pg||
nt|po-s: 3NT?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: ruffing with the 9 seems to be correct|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s not the way everybody would play. Ruff with the Jack og King and play against the Queen. But no argument against success|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you could cash @H A, lead a @D to the K and play a @C to the 7 = South won't enjoy being n lead, but it's all a bit DD|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: tricky :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  gutsy move |pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Polish Club, EW 5card major and 15-17NT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ralfwil: If S wins with @sA and continues with @c I think Fantoni will play @dK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi everyone|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|flash: declarer will probably start on one of the pointed suits|pg||
nt|hawe45:  His problem is, that @S King might be by the 1 @D-bidder |pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is weighing his options|pg||
nt|flash: mentally going through each possible line - trying to find the safest/ most reasonable|pg||
nt|flash: all not lost if the @SK off-side|pg||
nt|peachy: against this opposition, it pays to be careful|pg||
nt|flash: that looks like the most probable choice from here|pg||
nt|flash: declarer has a rather strong clue to the location of the @DA...|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Awful @H-shift, partner wanted @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in a sense "W helped", but if he hadnt bid N would be playing a level lower|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ser väl ut att kunna ordna sig med rätt stölder|pg||
nt|peacokk: Bra inledning att spela låg @S från bordet|pg||
pc|c2|nt|po-s: soon is not soon enough...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: And there is no game in spades, what about notrumps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no more trumps |pg||
nt|chick: certainly solves the problem of the diamond loser, so it was a no-risk finesse|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she just has to decide which red suit to finesse. heart hook also logiocal--if E had D card but no heart card, probably a D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html       tourney site|pg||
nt|peachy: i think best the diamonds before getting to board with S ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well if there are 2 trump losers and D queen is on but heart king off, it is not no risk--it goes down in a makeable contract|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: Low-High from N sh be even No|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some interesting decisions at several stages of the auction here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: udca=Upside Down  Count  Attitude|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Marshall|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Raija.|pg||

nt|jcwla: Hey Marshall.|pg||
nt|peachy: Al:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i think this is match  10|pg||
nt|jcwla: Either N or E might have made a double at their turn.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i can see 3C with the N hand, but double looks dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C in context of Precision probably shows longer @C|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|xenya: onthis defence, it's cold|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what about 6nt? if @c are Jxxx - x, @hq can be on side|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes sure|pg||
nt|po-s: hej Ralf, hi all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2 stölder på korta handen  och 2 @d-stölder på bordet.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: and actually -- a number of big clubbers use  1@D-2@H as Reverse Flannery - to show the 5@S 4@H weak responding hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I normally guess one board right per day - here it was|pg||
nt|xenya: the other room was quicker -- a push|pg||
nt|po-s: 6nt?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is good play|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|hawe45:  @S-return kept West in 420 |pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H to the Ace is working very well now|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will likely put dummy back in|pg||
nt|hlortz: even if e transfers and bids 2n, w likely to pass with 15 and no @S fit|pg||
nt|flash: declarer's problem, if the @SK is, indeed, offside is the lack of an entry to hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Both of these teams are prime candidates for winning the whole event|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  not sure why W covered the ten of clubs as trick one|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, it's a very good 15 count with a strong 5-card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some may accept the invite|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Should we say it this way - @S-shift was not killing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'm with W in a sense of his bidding, actually, but this time his activity wasted |pg||
nt|po-s: just in case North holds Jxxx in clubs - and the HQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzeu: Sorry. För snabbt för att jag skulle kunna hänga med.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: np|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ett tidigt @h skift från Jonte medan @d kommunikation fanns för -1|pg||
mc|8|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Yokohama. hi to all|pg||
nt|flash: Sementa had few options, but that certainly clarified/simplified things for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: argument for @S is that partner has all the points -- even if @H strikes strength -- may not be entry to East's length|pg||

nt|flash: ask questions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  |pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  Hello PEO|pg||
nt|po-s: is there a link to standings?|pg||
nt|xenya: hello PO|pg||
nt|larrymori: slam happens to be cold but...|pg||
nt|shevek: 1st board of this set, 23 hcp 3NT and 10 imps for Lavazza|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C for the majors. She has her bid :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think, we should recommand a part score here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems here, that 4 @H depends on the @C-suit|pg||
nt|flash: Polish Club - several possible hands|pg||
nt|flash: in this case, the strong(est) option|pg||
nt|marlowepi: predict 3S final contract|pg||
nt|po-s: rules are different in Australia - but yes 6H is par|pg||
nt|roswolf: no free ride for e/w in the other room|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: but this might not be flat -- particularly after the double by W|pg||
nt|hawe45:  EastÂ´s double is OK - for the minors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ecats should still have convention cards for both pairs online from Beijing 2008 |pg||
nt|marlowepi: friendly hand, endplayed into making 6N|pg||
nt|othered1: well odds-off|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@s = Xfer to @cs|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w unlikely to risk the slam imo|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tack|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3-loser hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another possible slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: correct play makes it|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may go all pass|pg||
nt|pelu: overcals in minor vuln sh normal be on 6 card suits - so S passed where mane clubplayers would bid 2@C|pg||
nt|othered1: I like west's pass.  But I've seen lots of strange 1N overcalls on hands like that, too.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: nothing to write home about in this hand |pg||
nt|tejjyid: me too, on both counts|pg||
mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: even on best lead of D ace|pg||
nt|hlortz: for sure vul too dangerous to overcall at IMPs|pg||
nt|sybarra: does N take any action now? |pg||
nt|sybarra: i.e., is it worth is?|pg||
nt|peachy: strongest is 19+ any shape|pg||
nt|flash: our operator threw up a small false card|pg||
nt|flash: didn't slow us down, however   :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @H RD is a make|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may be forced to play correctly no entry to dummy |pg||
nt|marlowepi: D king|pg||
nt|pelu: will Balicki bid 2@H? - he know that the @s's are bad for him max doubleton in West|pg||
nt|xenya: Oz Players are currently 4th, 16 VPS ahead of Sara who are 6/7th |pg||
nt|po-s: or rather 6 diamonds doubled|pg||
nt|roswolf: without a diamond bid from n/s very hard to imagine the perfect fit|pg||
nt|peacokk: Märkligt att Sörling inte klev in med 1@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hawe45:  SouthÂ´s 2 @S must be a minimum-hand...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = ART Game Force [2-way Checkback]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know why Sementa didn't bid 2@H :(|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here a pass from West would be a big win!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice West-hand - E/W can make 1 @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless EW play 4-card majors, E would probably have bid 2S over 1S if his pd had opened in first seat|pg||
nt|po-s: how much is that?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Very risky, but more than 620|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and without a @h lead 9 tricks in 2@hRD|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oays even better then|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Pays|pg||
nt|po-s: really?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But East was right, without @H-lead 11 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  po-s even 2 @H D is more than 620 (670)|pg||
nt|shevek: if east is thinking, he would have done better to bid 5@d (exclusion) 1st time|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in clubs dummy has about 6 entries|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only a @S-lead is good for the defense|pg||
nt|po-s: wkNT with lots of shapes..|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I was talking about 2 @S |pg||
nt|shevek: they probably will :)|pg||
nt|po-s: I heard you the first time - or rather saw you|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well this will be a nice result |pg||
nt|hawe45:  In the good old days, South would have doubled|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jbgood: i'd rather double 2@c than 4 @h|pg||
nt|pelu: and prob @Ss bad for declayer - act 2@H down 1 - EW tahe the first 6 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i freely open 1N with a 5-card major, but here i would open 1S. i doubt we have a game if pd responds 1N, and if pd is 35 in majors we will play wrong suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: either 2C was Puyppet or E is already steaming trying to get the swing back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: current standings available at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1100 against 2 @H D - and against any other contract I suppose|pg||
nt|xenya: the teams' primary target is to get to the quarter-finals|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: NS do quite well in diamonds, but the club break is awkward|pg||
nt|hlortz: dubion must be worth another try here...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Henry.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he may not try. he may just bid it|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe 2NT has dual meaning|pg||
nt|hlortz: duboin ..my typing is lacking|pg||
nt|jcwla: 10 IMPs to Bulgaria on 1 - Lavazza got to 5@D and that was doubled and set 3.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1 = 17|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not that much point in trying when YOU have eight controls. partner is likely to drop you even when you want to be there|pg||
nt|peachy: even a player with no pulse would get that dbld, I think,|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@d looks like an overbid... whatever it means|pg||
nt|marlowepi: either EW play 4-card majors or E was allowing for possible 4-card suit by doubling. still, with short spades a 43 fit could be the best spot, with the ruff coming in the short ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump hand|pg||
nt|shevek: 5@c will go down|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I hate bidding NT on that hand - sometimes your fixed; if this is the hand, no need to lose sleep over it.|pg||
nt|roswolf: might bid the slam now|pg||
nt|po-s: stepping stone to show CA|pg||
mb|3C|nt|po-s: he must win and return a trump|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best defense @C Ace and a trump|pg||
nt|po-s: 2D obviously showed hearts - transfer advance|pg||
nt|ritong: hello everybody|pg||
nt|ppiglett: ta|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Lucky with @c109 on N|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Double-dummy 10 "easy" tricks|pg||
nt|peacokk: Bra bjudet av ÖV|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Vet ni vem Öst är, Erik eller Ralf?|pg||
nt|peacokk: Ingen aning|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  And defense can have some fun against 4 @S, when they play the 13th @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not updated after round 3 yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow, what do they open?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and NO 8+ fit|pg||
nt|po-s: no?|pg||
nt|roswolf: last train?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kanske han heter Öst :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: never said it was easy to get to slam:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: think e will make exactly 2@D|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 losers  and no problem with ruffing @Ss|pg||
nt|xenya: hard to see where E found the 5@C bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East trusted South - a mistake|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why 5@c now?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tough decision atr trick one, probably wrong|pg||
nt|othered1: so ifyou changed @H and @D in west's hand, you would open 1N, Marshall?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree|pg||
nt|jcwla: Whoa, this is hard to believe.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After 3 @D, North must be short in @C, so only one winning solution - @C  Jack!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: the 4-0 trump break will beat this i think|pg||
nt|hlortz: notice ns lead low from xx unlike most [non polish] pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was max of 14  presumably  2N or 3N said not great hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump lead would probably hold this to 2, but hard to fault the club lead:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|peacokk: :)|pg||
nt|peacokk: Tursamt för NS|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to David Greenwood|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@S on J-fourth and @H Kx might not be everyone's choice -- 3@H looking like a mixed raise -- and not everyone would move w/E's hand either.|pg||
nt|peachy: knowledgeable spec pointed out how good a bid 4D was|pg||
nt|peachy: in the meantime, declarer is on track to make|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jtr: Hello people|pg||
nt|peachy: despite bad trump breakm, declarer still makes|pg||
nt|jcwla: "I'll always believe you should have made it, partner."|pg||
nt|shevek: flat board|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hi enri|pg||
nt|po-s: I guess that would consistent with CK and DA?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|peachy: 1H was 4+ 7+HCP, a diamond canape possibility|pg||
nt|roswolf: true p-o - perhaps west should xx 5@C?|pg||
nt|po-s: no last train - RD would have been my choice|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jbgood: an unlucky downer (2?)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, with @hs 4-0 and North with a doubleton @s This wont be nice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can consider yourself very unlucky to go two down opposite four trumps|pg||
nt|hlortz: s taps the dummy to shut out the long spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: From Brock's point of view I mean|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session1.htm  for standings after session 1|pg||
nt|jtr: Pointed out that 4@h is unlikely to be doubled at many tables|pg||
nt|jtr: Unusual opening by North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Session 2 results and standings: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session2.htm scoretables|pg||
nt|jtr: Did 2@s really make 9 on board 23?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East should continue trump!|pg||
nt|pelu: also almost standard in denmark|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer another X|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dburn: instead, Beauty picked up 5 IMPs for missing game when the Latin played in a weird 4-2 spade fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once hearts break there is a perfect elimination for 6, winning even if KTx or KJx of Ds are offside|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Henri!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hlortz: ah i see not common in USA|pg||
nt|flash: headed for 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @s inklivet  verkar rimligt på N|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You have almost an opening bid - and your partner doubles 1 @S - should they have 790, then OK|pg||
nt|ritong: other room plays higher|pg||
nt|ritong: in @ds|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hello all|pg||
nt|peacokk: Ser inte att spelföraren ska kunna med sig mindre än de 11 uppenbara sticken, så jag går och hämtar frukost|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: Well in the OR Fantoni matched the 3@S but Sementa did not move and 3@S/N the spot.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: hello|pg||
nt|ralfwil: gör du rätt i! 11 stick|pg||
pc|h5|nt|po-s: South should have cashed the HA if he had had it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  AActually South should have played the @D King maybe|pg||
nt|po-s: but club is no good since declarer can ruff high and throw a dia|pg||
nt|hawe45:  10 I think|pg||
nt|peachy: let me ask our BFF (best friend forever) GIB...|pg||
nt|flash: @D honor now keeps 11 in play|pg||
nt|peachy: he says 11 or 12|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: S needed to switch, but W needed to win first trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my fault - was chatting -- 2@C WAS 5-Card Stayman  and the pair defines using it with 53 majors -- transfer then 2/3 NT = 52|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even opposite this dog 6N has fair play: Qx   KTx   Kxx  QJTxx|pg||
nt|xenya: and 2 last qualifying rounds will be played today, including this one|pg||
nt|xenya: so this match is quite important for Sara|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good morning all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Well both pairs missed the par slam :)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - I made a new count|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a worthwhile investment|pg||
nt|roswolf: a push|pg||
nt|po-s: anyway, regarding slam - it may well be below 50% but that has nothing to do with par|pg||
pc|h8|nt|po-s: finess spades and not get the D ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: considering the score, that is surprising|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hawe45:  But declarer should then guess, whether SouthÂ´s doubleton is Q or 10 |pg||
nt|peachy: Bulgaria has a rare chance to get considerable headstart|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: i would just pass as E and collect all the 100's i can|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|dburn: there ought to be a Law against doing that...|pg||
nt|loganrun: 7 of spades seems fiarly straighforward|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, fantunes play forcing one opening bids|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm glad someone has keptthe spirit of Roman Club alive|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hello Henri  @H|pg||
nt|ritong: a major revolution in the bidding theory|pg||
nt|othered1: How terrible is +80?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not terrible at all|pg||
nt|peacokk: Tycker det, 3@C går nog ett par straff|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|jtr: How does 5@d do?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I just wee, that Englands opponents are the junior team, a pair from Czech Republic at the other table|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, W didn't double, so E was never tempted|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sfoxa:  it doesn't seem like big result for EW - they could win 5@c|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The unblock of @S 10 was no good idea|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: N may hop q here |pg||
nt|sybarra: as I said earlier,  we will not be playing at speed of light (like the brazilians) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: poor Giorgio -- @DQ onside AND  both pointed suits 33|pg||
nt|jcwla: They're in 6NT/E in the OR.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: poor nothing. the result was earned|pg||
nt|hlortz: i dont know their sys maybe 3n/3d denied as much as qx of @S still ...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcwla: So this will boost the lead to 48.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jtr: Looks like 11|pg||
nt|po-s: "cashing" the dia king would be disaster if you switch red aces in West|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Better an unblock of @H 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: its just one of those magic slams,  @H's 2/2,  @S 3/3,  diamond K on side,  just the one you want to be in |pg||
nt|peachy: bit more|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: @C continuation might have allowed declarer to get out for -1 -- a @H is asfe for 2 off|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=2320   för ranking (så småningom)|pg||

pc|h4|pc|c6|nt|peachy: here David, here's the box, step on it and shout :)|pg||
nt|peachy: curiously enough, EW had 4H making, if I saw correctly in this hand|pg||
nt|dburn: well, repeated spade leads might do in 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: now declarer can't reach the dummy without losing a 4th trick, so a push|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: perhaps u are right|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Did we get back to 7 tricks?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: antingen @c eller @d|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  So 670 due to bad defense from East, who coukd also defeat the contract by rising sith the @C King|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Raju|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Right, @D Ace after @C King might look right|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: all you need is 22 trumps|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hawe45:   To play @C Ace is to tel South, that he could have defeated the contract|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: and as W has played the cards, he cannot go wrong now|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|andyv:  survived for down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzcs: yes, board 23 was 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jtr: hmmmm  Someone got busy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like 5@D makes NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Marta does not make errors, David!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcs: :-)|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, someone did:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: CAPITAL letters in player names are seeded pairs, 16 of them altogether. They do not play against each other|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: But perhaps aggressive is also what EW's team are into|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: What's the point of doubling 2@H (where you want them to be) if you don't double 2@S?|pg||
nt|diablo666: I would have symphathized more with wests overcall if it was the spade suit he held.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then you are better off by passing 2@H|pg||
nt|diablo666: Agree with Roland.|pg||
nt|patricck: you should be prepared to double the runout as well, but I guess North didn't think they would run from a supported suit|pg||

nt|ahollan1: their convention card from Sao Paolo just says "2-way checkback"|pg||
nt|sybarra: true po,  but how to get there?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was not as bad a slam as many we see, though odds-against|pg||
nt|larrymori: south would have to put up the 10 to cause a problem|pg||
nt|othered1: and 1N is?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has some chances in 4S|pg||
nt|peachy: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: now will n/s try for game here?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andyv:  vul 2N seems a bit rich with W hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello everyone, Sveta:)|pg||
nt|flash: supposedly because, as a country boy, wearing shoes hurt his feet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well then:  xx   KTx   KQx   QJTxx|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will Westrun in 5 @D DOUBLED...|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks conventional but not sure what |pg||
nt|peachy: Lavazza should hope for exciting hands instead of pushes, otherwise harder to catch up later|pg||
nt|peacokk: 1@D verkar vara en slasköppning utan högfärg|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: in Hans' case, not removing his shoes might indicate fewer tricks than available...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 4-9 HCP, 5+@H & 4+@C/@D|pg||
nt|peachy: I still have suspicion 2NT was not denying hearts, perhaps to show the 12-14 instead of more wideranging options included in 1C|pg||
nt|po-s: probably "Polish" |pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart king fatal|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  vul attempt - it always deserves trying|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N considering 4N|pg||
nt|roswolf: consensus seems against bidding|pg||
nt|shevek: 2 flat hands, no source of tricks... 1NT it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hi Raija, welcome|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not cold, I think. You have a losing option in @C|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you like X or 3@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@C är inte ett dåligt kontrakt|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2N vul against not has limited appeal|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not sure Scotland wasnt joined to europe when he was there:)|pg||
nt|dburn: East unwilling to overcall, perhaps on the basis that his hand is too good - immediate overcalls destructive in nature|pg||
nt|peachy: nt apparent;ly 16-18 or something|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You have 10 slo tricks in 4 @H, but before that, defense will have 4 or 5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  slow|pg||
nt|po-s: 4 of a major and a longer minor|pg||
pc|s5|nt|peachy: NS got another chance|pg||
nt|larrymori: just what east wanted to see pard bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: will W float this?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially since the suit is likely to be weak|pg||
nt|po-s: he should - 2NT should be this kind of hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe W not on same wavelength, as he had other options over the D|pg||
nt|larrymori: something about trying to improve part scores is not a good philosophy|pg||
nt|sybarra: esp. at this vul |pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump needed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and logical|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like these 2-openings|pg||
nt|peacokk: 2@H hade antagligen inte varit krav av Gunnarsson på 2@C, därför fick han inleda med ett klumpigt 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzeu: 1@d=obalans 10-14 ej 4+hö|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  S to the rescue|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice 5 @D - if they bid the slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not now - why is West passing?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: declarer wind and leads jack of hearts, covered. N must unblock, and duck 2nd heart to S's 8|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  nice plan for expert's book )))|pg||
nt|xenya: this should go down a few|pg||
nt|po-s: The opponents do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and you PO?|pg||
nt|xenya: wrong hand for the gadget|pg||
nt|po-s: The Laws say the game should be played in a friendly way|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sadly, I would probably bid with the South cards|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess 80 is a possible result here, too.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: can do better|pg||
nt|sybarra2: really esciting |pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: EW off the hook |pg||
nt|pelu: NS could also go for penalty against EW - 2@CX = 500|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say that the W hand looks more like what I usually hold|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes e came in expecting the weak hand in south|pg||
nt|dburn: if classical strong club, yes - 17-19 or even 17-20 more common ranges nowadays|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, I'm old school|pg||
nt|flash: this is the kind of deal which decides matches - much less short matches like this|pg||
nt|flash: to some extent, the @D call helps North - whatever values South has might well include some in @Cs|pg||
nt|peachy: good decision, 5D would only tumble one or so|pg||
nt|xenya: very unlikely at these colours and with W being silent throughout|pg||
nt|sybarra: same auction in OR '|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@H denies a top honor  - but that doesn't surprise Klinger|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|peachy: dblfits all around, and now that was brought to daylight|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean - the lead must be a @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Service-double - earns nothing, helps N/S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: X|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice contract - on a @S-lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Do we all bid 1 @S - I do not|pg||
nt|vugraphzeu: 1@h=inv+ art RK|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: seems a small spade allows to make it -- a club lead would have been more challenging|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont care for 2S but because of 2/1 South is not limited -anyway should still stop in 3NT|pg||
nt|shevek: 3NT is the winner here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H-ruff needed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: är inte 3@c ett underbud från N? Tycker nog det|pg||
nt|vugraphzeu: TL kallas.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@C är faktiskt ett mycket bra kontrakt|pg||
nt|vugraphzeu: Väst frågade om 2@d. "Kan det vara noll hp?"|pg||
nt|vugraphzeu: Syd undrar om man får fråga så.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: På en bra dag gör du slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzeu: Borde man fråga "hur mycket poäng visar det?".|pg||
nt|peacokk: Östs dubbling av 2@D är inget som jag rekomenderar|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N fick chansen igen!|pg||
nt|vugraphzeu: TL: "Får fråga vad du vill. Vissa frågor kan ge OI."|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Man får aldrig ställa ledande frågor|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Vad betyder 2@D är frågan|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: strictly speaking, yes, but you can get a fairly good count on the E hand i think|pg||
nt|flash: East suggests defense vs 5@Ss and strongly suggests that West not bid more (especially vulnerable)|pg||
nt|peachy: I agree with Jim's explanation, for what its worth|pg||
nt|flash: Hans actually sneaked in a good point - suggesting/directing the @D lead was important here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah   1N already said 12-14|pg||
nt|othered1: Pointed out that in OR, north will open 1N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: håller inte med om 3@d från S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session2.htm scoretables|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even w/o dbl - could be gain for NS|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NorthÂ´s opening bid pushed E/W to game, equalling the match|pg||
nt|othered1: with no trump lead and very friendly breaks, this can play well on cross ruff.|pg||
nt|sybarra: as you see they made 5 in the other room,   @h and ht continuation |pg||
nt|hlortz: oh im NOT defending their bidding LOL you have 19 pard opens and you dont move past 3n.|pg||
nt|peachy: X more flexible|pg||
nt|po-s: I guess the Canadians are well behind - although Raptor sounds old|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, can make 5 by going up ace, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S2 lead is ATTITUDE  [seems an exaggeration of the suit]|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe helps - http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2008/zagranica/friendly/cc_hol/van%20Prooijen-Verhees.pdf |pg||
pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  Nice @D-suit - brings 4 tricks to East-West|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - cancel|pg||
nt|po-s: Hans, asusual you are right - North will cover the Dten and yes, four tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D could lead to 3D cold for 3N or 4S|pg||
nt|ritong: 140 later, next|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a differnt way to go minus|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  3@s just can't be right... why is S in such a rush to show a bad suit?|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see why South volunteered a bid in front of partner|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it stil is joined to Europe, it's just that part of the way is under water|pg||
nt|peachy: this has chances to chke, and I think it will|pg||
nt|peachy: S sensibly signs off|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer D from W on the first round of bidding. 15HP behind opener|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both sides play trump - only one can be right|pg||
nt|shevek: was|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well that will put the kibosh on that, not to use vague antecedents.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: club lead would give declarer a chance to go down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @s 9 - "partner, I have clubs" - seems so|pg||
nt|hawe45:  More fun here than in OR|pg||
nt|flash: XX shows 1st round control|pg||
nt|shevek: west is Johan Sylvan, a hugely successful poker player, but....pass was right|pg||
nt|sybarra: its 2 yrs old so at out own risk |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  life is more simple|pg||
nt|peachy: oh well, identifying number of aces hard even at this level of game|pg||
nt|jcwla: Huge opportunity missed.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|sybarra: K or Q from S |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think best was to fly @CA, ruff @H  top @D pitching @C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  There is much to be said AGAINST this 4 @S 1) Suit is too short - but good 2 ) Hand can play also in @H - and @C|pg||
nt|po-s: Johan is also a very good bridgeplayer|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will be ok in 4H but far from ideal spot|pg||
nt|shevek: looks like cuebids for @cs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For newcomers. The other semi-final between Zimmermann and Bulgaria is over after 16 boards. Bulgaria has conceded, 54 IMPs adrift|pg||
nt|odysseus69: without 2/1 North would simply bid 3NT over 2 hearts - instead we have a lot of head scratching|pg||
nt|shevek: 5@c at risk on a @s lead...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will he find it ?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|flash: notice that the @D lead would hold this to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: I am surprise the diamond lead didnt come, after West's valiant effort|pg||
nt|flash: to quote David Berkowitz:  if  i'd bid @Cs, would you have led a @D????|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jtr: Yes true|pg||
nt|peachy: make*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually -- I'd try 2N|pg||
nt|larrymori: 2@c p/c was not so attractive so he figured maybe a 62 or 61 might be better|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6c on a diamond lead is ok|pg||
nt|peachy: if HA led and no club switch, declarer has chance|pg||
nt|jcwla: If @HA led, director called.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Nice for once to see instant scoring outside Scandinavia and Poland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can we hope for America to follow suit?|pg||
nt|hlortz: in 10 or 20 years|pg||
nt|peachy: she could even play low and make|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West should have bid 5 @C - to get a @D-leas...!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: X for me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Have we made the "Who needs Aces" jokes yet?|pg||
nt|peachy: i was just going to say something like that, thanks though!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N tycker nog att ÖV hamnat i ett dåligt kontrakt som ger samma utdelning|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|andyv:  sure... 40 or 50 years from now|pg||
nt|peachy: I was only defending E bidding which may have been systemic:)|pg||

nt|peachy: Hello kibitzers:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - welcome|pg||
nt|peachy: I see we have a strong match going here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Defense have misplayed the @C-suit|pg||
nt|loganrun: South has done well here to limit the losses|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Andrew.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|po-s: Could South possibly have 8401|pg||
nt|shevek: on a @s lead though, needs the @c guess|pg||
nt|peachy: we've been more subtle about it Andrew:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Hi |pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: too well perhaps|pg||

nt|peacokk: Ser ut som sex bet|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hawe45:  Some play this DONT -. or others, where D = 1-suiter|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now a @S to endplay east|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: it wasnt just 19, it was about the crispest 19 imagineable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: shd be easy now|pg||
nt|shevek: tell him Sunil :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i just did :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: top D before H ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right -- unblock Ace first|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the soup now,  with q of @S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult to comment onopening lead but it didnt sound like declarer had KQJ lof diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Perhaps 54 IMPs not exactly concession-territory, but their decision of course|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Funnily enogh Zimmermann was 54 IMPs ahead before the last segment in the French Premier League last Saturday  ... and lost on a tie-break!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe the Bulgarians did not hear about that|pg||
nt|shevek: or they hate tie-breaks :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: brb|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  But now the @C-guess will decide - and East will fix it|pg||
nt|xenya: faultless defence|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: 3N is my second choice|pg||
nt|othered1: nicely defended|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: not on a club opening lead she couldnt|pg||
nt|peachy: not opening lead|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Sory, I've been working on tactful,  but I haven't got to subtle yet|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: how best to continue?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|jtr: What do we think of West's 2NT though?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  N/S should have played trumps from the very beginning|pg||
nt|po-s: probably 1D response showed four+hearts, 2C was puppet to 2D and 2S inviting with four|pg||
nt|dburn: should be OK - not much the defenders can do to hurt him since he has one spade trick and two of each|pg||
nt|tejjyid: will he misguess?|pg||
nt|peachy: now making, HUGE|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: 3@D is my LAST choice :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N could fail cold for 4S though, and on many hands where E would not trake you out|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

nt|flash: our skepticism of the board 2 result is the 1 IMP on the scoreboard so far|pg||

nt|odysseus69: not the ideal trump break|pg||
nt|shevek: abt one in a hundred|pg||

nt|peachy: lets see who gets the better of this board|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Shift was easy -- seeing all 4 hands!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good for the match!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 11 boards ... 10 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: likely 3S by S|pg||
nt|dburn: but I don't have much idea why he did that, with K9x in his hand|pg||
nt|peachy: then it was a case of "monkey fell from tree"|pg||
nt|ritong: delicate hand|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S is likely here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Chance to get most of 'em right back.|pg||
nt|peachy: only needs diam finesse so not bad|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, hard to see a pressing need to bid this to slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 38 imps is a handy lead but not in surmountable in 29 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzeu: 1NT=14-16|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|sybarra: this alert?  is it "could be 2" |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe playing for West to have @h10x and no entry, but that seems a bit of a view|pg||
nt|xenya: i tend to agree with W's pass -- the fact that you are behind the opener doesn't matter much with his holding -- no tenaces, just controls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=3+@C, not 4@C & 4@D [1@D]|pg||
nt|odysseus69: h + minor probably|pg||
nt|shevek: same method in the other room|pg||

nt|peacokk: 2@C är ett alternativ också, så är även pass|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45:  Still no game|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not everybodyÂ´ s taste that 2 NT - facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes you need to make that call with an undistinguished balanced 16. here you are close to 8 trix in yr own hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but DBL expects to hear more @H from LHO|pg||
nt|loganrun: but that means that he has ace of hearts and king of clubs outside of his trump suit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With the bare @C King, South would have taken the kead in his hand to play @C King|pg||
nt|othered1: Why was that making?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D attractive spot single dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: Wasn't the last -1?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lead directing pass|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@s, P, P, X?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you don't normally bid slams on a finesse though, unless you like action|pg||
nt|peachy: apparently 3S is forcing, many use conventions here|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, Lavazza may feel need to push - and Zimmermann may act on assumption Lavazza will push.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 50% ismore ofan alibi than a reason|pg||
mb|2D!|an|5+!h, 0+hp|nt|peachy: this will be a very tight match, both teams have some of the world's best pairs playing,  and Fantunes, perhaps theeee best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW rate to go minus in game here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you are going to hear more hearts, it matters little what you do|pg||

nt|hawe45:  lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets let operator sort it out |pg||
nt|sybarra: I think it was|pg||
nt|ritong: well, it would be nice to stop that low|pg||
nt|tejjyid: mind you, once the 5-5 appears with North, things change a little|pg||
nt|peachy: Zimmerman might think now the diamond finess if needed, is likely working|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I play 5@S here as pretty much a slam try - so I would have to X to avoid trouble - not an ideal method on this hand at all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Might be an implication of fewer values for 3@S than for say a 3@H cuebid.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although 5@C is not pretty|pg||
nt|peachy: I think many/most agree that X is putting on the brakes|pg||
nt|peachy: hard to see that happening though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: oh yes, I'm sure, but you really "want" to play 5 without inviting 6 |pg||

mb|d|nt|peachy: if S doesnt bid them now, the S willl be lost forever|pg||
nt|flash: X reasonable, but now without risk - my partners always bid 2@D...|pg||
nt|flash: note the 1NT call without a stopper|pg||
nt|flash: values first, shape 2nd??|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sounds right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and you will be outbidden in a lot of hands:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: pretty good 6@H here with west opening|pg||
nt|peachy: now this 1NT will drive bulgarians to six|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@D=@Hs i'm sure|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Al|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this seems to have become the popular defence v 1NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hard to aviod|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 5 tricks with the @H ruff - 800 is OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: anyone X 1@H with south?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no thin double by South|pg||
nt|jtr: 4 cards suits?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oh yes|pg||
nt|shevek: no guts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: så blev det också|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andyv:  strange 1N... even if playing 4 card majors|pg||
nt|flash: Duboin has obviously heard "6-4, come alive"|pg||
nt|flash: and maybe even 6-5|pg||
nt|peachy: well, I erred, Fantoni-Nunes not playing now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W can take the first 11 tricks against 1 NT|pg||
nt|xenya: sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even Kokish might think North too good for 1@H overcall :)|pg||
nt|po-s: did Ish never cash his ace?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wonder |pg||
nt|larrymori: cant imagine not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe they just miscounted|pg||
nt|othered1: As usual, our running score isn't remotely official -- the players will get it right in comparisons.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fixed noww|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South isunlikely to get too excited|pg||
nt|othered1: North doesn't have values to go solo beyond game|pg||
nt|tejjyid: is North well known as aslam enthusiast?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: another flat bd i presume|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: JC doesn´t quite believe the explanation|pg||
nt|loganrun: that as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" are either explaining, deep in thought or crashing |pg||
nt|po-s: I thought they played some miniclub  thing, pretty natural, like he played) with Jansma|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, good pass by East. A bit soft all in all, to consider continuing.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Maybe I overstated the risk of the 5@S bid|pg||
nt|peachy: so 13 right back to Zimmerman|pg||
nt|peacokk: 3NT av Winqvist?|pg||
nt|peacokk: 3@S snarare|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: prob same as open rm|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think N takes the push to 3...faster than I could type|pg||
nt|peachy: not a bad choice, d finesse near 100%|pg||
nt|marlowepi: its over|pg||
nt|po-s: 1S was puppet to 1NT|pg||
nt|sybarra2: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Double presumably showed 4+@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  why not a simple raise?|pg||
nt|jtr: wow aggressive double|pg||
nt|jtr: Just right at MPs|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in their lucky day EW win @s game|pg||
nt|peachy: good start, W raised|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  main problem - to bid it|pg||
nt|peachy: lose 2h and 3s|pg||
nt|flash: the stopperless 1NT does have its potential drawbacks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and against 2 NT also|pg||
nt|peachy: LOL|pg||
nt|peachy: how about 3NT Hans|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm starting to think that the long run winner for South is to PASS the DBL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this could be ugly for EW very soon|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4C was a lot to bid with 11 adjusted losers and all 5 HCP in opps' suits|pg||
nt|po-s: oops|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will be better if he loses to the D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bra utspel. Hade nog testat @d själv|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bjeagle.se/bridge/dmlag/0910/running_scores.html  for running scores |pg||
nt|peacokk: Jag också|pg||
nt|Walddk4: running scores ser ut att funka som det ska|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hittar Johan @d shiftet nu?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dburn: good decision by West here - that raise wasn't automatic|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm unfamiliar with ew system, for me raise would not have occurred to me|pg||
nt|peachy: they did well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=transfer|pg||
nt|loganrun: this hand will play well as well|pg||
nt|po-s: 1C was clubs or wk or 18-19 NT, 1H showed spades|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D 9 - dangerous shift|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @DQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this solved everything for E!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: for the match ie|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: sry 13 boards including this one|pg||
nt|peacokk: Bra försvar|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hade nog testat 3@d som S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: even if Gower doesn't lead a minor -- still only 9 tricks  [i think]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once S bids 3S, as he should, they arein slam|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: sounds like penalties, with good hearts|pg||
nt|jtr: Aiming for the KOD Roland?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S probably wanted to dbl the first time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Going for the KOD is tempting at MP|pg||
nt|Walddk2: KOD = Kiss of Death|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes!|pg||
nt|pelu: normal lead - only a @S could give S some problems|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Let me count|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Edgar Kaplan is rolling over in his sepulchre Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|po-s: not so ugly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow !! ugly all right, but for NS|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2NT will preumableslow North a little|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here they only get 10, I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No comments from now...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi Vlad -- i'm not really here, just adding some explanations of alerts if i can|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Welcome!|pg||
nt|po-s: 1S was consistent with a wk NT with 2-3 spades...|pg||
nt|po-s: how is 6|pg||
nt|po-s: looks like def can make 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: excellent switch |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but still -1|pg||
nt|po-s: Bochi was afraid the clubs might become established|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ja, men det hjälper väl inte|pg||
nt|peacokk: Nej, men Winqvist kommer få svettas lite|pg||
nt|ralfwil: säg inte det? vågar Tobias ta @d9? då kommer @s.skift|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hlortz: aka 200|pg||
nt|Walddk2: -200 at matchpoints|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump lead was better, and logical on the auction and the W hand|pg||
nt|chick: kind of a waste of the 10|pg||
nt|peachy: its cold, dont think any lead woulda caused a prob|pg||
nt|flash: but an important lesson:  the defenders can't see your hand...|pg||
nt|peachy: silence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  20 tricks in difference or so|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks simple enough|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to guess the spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but if N leads heart queen...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  second try is still available|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how will he get to dummy?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ruffing clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not before hearts are led by S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N leads a club, jack is the correct card. then ten of hearts|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  your are right, Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W does best to rise and lead a club, but NS can still prevail, though there is scope for error|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe 1 or 2 imps to Z|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: pause -- in case Klinger has ducked @DA??|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but is N still thinking...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: wrong J by pd - and he has 3 of them :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bulgaria matched the 4@S contract on 19 - and two overtricks for 2 IMPs to 23-zip.|pg||
nt|hlortz: bulgarians are going full speed ahead|pg||
nt|peachy: N gambled, W could have had Ax spades and KQxx xlubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N could easily turn out to be an underbid, e.g. if N held:   KJxx   Axx   AKQxx  x   they would play 3N with 6D near cold|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice auction from Vladi Isporski|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks an entry short to use all threats, but i may be wrong|pg||
nt|larrymori: the game bonus makes it compelling to raise with the south hand|pg||
nt|po-s: ruff diamond, 2xtrumps A of D to throw a spade,  ruff and SK|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: and on board 18 West kept NS out of 4@s by opening 1@s on five low and a pile of dingo's kidneys|pg||
nt|othered1: South may feel has two free bids were enough and 4@D is likely defined as NF|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but now lost the chance to defeat|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You make it by taking @D 10 with the King|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nu blir det lätt|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  and should get it|pg||
nt|andyv:  if not 500|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on 25 3@S-1 was above average for NS |pg||
nt|marlowepi: total waste|pg||
nt|chick: although I guess a pitch on the J doesn't do much|pg||
nt|po-s: so less than imp per board|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: http://www.brenning.se/results/2010/london/tgrs1stauctionpairs/tgrsbridgeclub1stauctionpairs-session2.htm scoretables|pg||
nt|po-s: trump I think,  knowing that South has a good number of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 11-13, 3/4@H   2@D=ART Game Force [effectively 4th suit]|pg||
nt|po-s: but won+t|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, something about that auction makes me think slam was never a risk|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: not about pitch, about how many clubs nead to be ruffed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as it was proved next door |pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: penalties ranged from 1400 (4Nx-5 EW) to 800 (4Hx-3 NS)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now you can make an overtrickm playing on @C|pg||
nt|po-s: and now a club finesse?|pg||
nt|ritong: duboin might cumulate chances|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H would have been weaker hand than 2N  --- not sure what 3@C asks :(|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|pelu: how do u play on a @s-lead?? - can u make 3NT? |pg||
nt|peachy: well, perhaps I am wrong, fforgot the 3S bid after hearts were set by 3H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for Duboin to have opening bid, he MUST hold @DK|pg||
nt|peachy: wd|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: push on 3 -- same contract, same result in the OR|pg||
nt|jcwla: Highly impressive.|pg||
nt|ritong: first try for the @s drop, and if it fails try @d hook|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @d till @d9 hade satt spelföraren på problem|pg||
nt|peacokk: Så är det|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hawe45:  Oh - no entry any longer|pg||
nt|pelu: prob on an endplay of West?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: it could be beaten double dummy -- @H lead, A, @H ruff, underlead @Cs, another @H ruff -- and there is another trick for the defence -- but now it makes|pg||
nt|po-s: fortunately no|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|peachy: you could from the beginning but why bother too much, IMPs|pg||
nt|dburn: so that was 11 IMPs to The Latin, who usually make a good showing in this tournament|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks reasonable to me.  |pg||
nt|ritong: there is also a throw in possibility|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and the spade drop will work  but will he hook it|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This might pÃ¥ 1.200 - 2 x 600|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like he won with @dA|pg||
nt|xenya: well perhaps that's how it was made in the other room -- i was wondering|pg||
nt|po-s: but will beat this or should|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I´m not awake. He won with @cK|pg||
nt|othered1: Throw in isn't that easy, since south doesn't have entry after long @C played|pg||
nt|ralfwil: claim 9|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: pitch a loser now|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hawe45:  be 1200|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hlortz: i dont see how to make it offhand ...|pg||
nt|tez: hi all|pg||
nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|peachy: lucky that E had the D 0 also|pg||
nt|hlortz: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Tezcan |pg||
nt|xenya: EW's sophisticated methods got them to 3N on a hand where most would be in 4@H|pg||
nt|tejjyid: looks like it will be a long day|pg||
pc|s5|nt|peachy: 10|pg||
nt|peachy: I would think the LATIN team is a favorite here, they have some good players.  I don't know anything about he Japanese Beauty|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Automatic 500 it seems. Better to double on your first turn with the South cards. Then you won't get in trouble later|pg||
pc|sA|mc|11|nt|hawe45:  Hoping for a terrible @H-break with lenght by South|pg||
nt|shevek: if he goes 1 down , 5 impd to Lavazza|pg||

nt|mdgraham: NS have an awful lot of tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 16 top tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: about 16|pg||
nt|jtr: A few tricks here|pg||
nt|hlortz: 7 @D @H or NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so you would expect a flat 7N across the field |pg||
nt|jbgood: no|pg||
nt|jtr: Even my grandmother would manage 9 i think|pg||
nt|jbgood: there are always a mix-up somewhere|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TGR's Bridge Club is located in Central London, near Marble Arch. TGR is short for The Great Rose, named after the late and great Great Britain player, Irving Rose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so far the standard fo card play has not matched the quaity of the bidding|pg||
nt|tez: nicely played|pg||
nt|po-s: misplaying diamonds like that...|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry, you didn´t even need that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N might have bid 5D there, as the 4C bid helped him...it looks like S is not loaded in clubs so is likely to have D ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: was 4 @D the right bid?  may 5?|pg||
nt|larrymori: he did bid it 3 times, south can raise|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that looks like gain for NS - they have no game for easy play |pg||
nt|xenya: that was very strange|pg||
nt|po-s: oops I thought he had three clubs...|pg||
nt|shevek: I guess would be penalty|pg||
nt|shevek: but they might run to 2NT|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I didnt mean to suggest he do that!|pg||
nt|jcwla: There was a 3@H cuebid in the OR and at that point 6 a more reasonable shot, I think this was a better auction and justly rewarded.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 12 boards 12 imps|pg||
nt|shevek: this accident in the OR will cost only 5 imps|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|hawe45:  @S-guess is worth 1 IMP here|pg||
nt|flash: 3@S made E-W on that one, so a potentially very big 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here N/S can take the first ?? tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they won't mind that 1 imp loss at all|pg||
nt|sybarra: he had of the things! |pg||
mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: but somehow I doubt every pair will bid 7N|pg||
nt|po-s: the spot cards in D and H were crucial - should have made|pg||
nt|hawe45:  -Ready for another partscore|pg||
nt|po-s: Carruthers never get to bid his hearts...unless 2D was multi|pg||
nt|pelu: now on slam-level|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely n/s draws a dble here |pg||
nt|peachy: 12-15 bal, 19+ any, and two more options|pg||
nt|flash: again, the multi-meaning 1@C opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like Bulgarian EW also playing big club   their auction begins  1@D-DBL-P-2@C|pg||
nt|hlortz: need to get to NT not @H here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=(21)22-23|pg||
nt|sybarra: that didnt get in my comment|pg||
nt|othered1: I put the last board into the "stuff happens" category, along with many other 8-card suit hands.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt ÖV eller?|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|sfoxa:  NS got lot of points again.  @h game? NT?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And the Multi might help declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings after 2 rounds|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how high does e/w bid?|pg||
nt|hlortz: 5@H now??|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c opening means..nat or 16+any hand..polish club|pg||
nt|sybarra: I agree with 5 @H |pg||
nt|dburn: I neither - they were 19th in the standings after four rounds, but not sure what they did in their last match|pg||
nt|sybarra: 8 |pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: They won't|pg||
nt|sybarra: puts n/s in a spot quickly |pg||
nt|tez: bid or not to bid..pass is not forcing i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: for all N knows,  S may have no clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: 16+ nat or 12-18 4441|pg||
nt|xenya: weak 1N?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Â´Looks like a flat 3 NT here|pg||
nt|sybarra: Ed, you are so gracious @H|pg||
nt|peachy: 3H might have been showing spades, hi-for-hi cuebid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Maybe, partner won;t bid differently with AKxx, AKxxxx though & wont often have much less|pg||
nt|peachy: but I dont know|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: 5NT? = I can play slam in 2 suits?|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if they are up against The Latin their results can't have been bad|pg||
nt|peachy: if the have puppet, easy|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh yeah it clearly was.  But again -- so many IMPs turn on such hands and where a particular card is.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess there is a risk partner still has 2@C, iftheopp|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if the opponents are reckelss types|pg||
nt|peachy: if he had AKxxxx in diam and same hand, he would Pass|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this shd also be flat when Lavazza is looking for swingy hands|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Some will not even be in a grand slam. Just wait and see|pg||
nt|po-s: which it probably ewas|pg||
nt|xenya: on 18, EW in the other room didn't find the 4@S save -- 8 imps to World Youth|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the X shows @S or just cards?|pg||
nt|tez: strong opening |pg||
nt|sybarra: will S bid 7?|pg||
nt|tez: i thk|pg||
nt|pelu: cards I exp - but spect can correct me :)|pg||
nt|tez: 6 enuf:)|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like that|pg||
nt|sybarra: slightly different auction in other room  since 1 @H=sp |pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least that's what the old convention card says :(|pg||
nt|hlortz: oh never mind 10 tricks in @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easier without it|pg||
nt|peachy: but S decided not to even look, reasonable decision with 4333|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think 4 @D is "testing pard"  doesnt pard have to have at least a couple of @D's (with honor) to bid 3 nt?|pg||
nt|othered1: is north allowed to raise?|pg||
nt|peachy: less informative auction here than OR|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, anyway, u can never argue with success|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a spec tells me "13 imps- 12 is still Z win" |pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: he will bid pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree  but S has to like his hand |pg||
nt|loganrun: strightforward 3NT after West shows 18-19 bal|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kommer inte så högt tror jag|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@d by S seems to make things easier|pg||
nt|sybarra: the @d suit most likely the one in question |pg||
nt|flash: 2@D natural and VERY positive|pg||
nt|flash: grand slam easy from here - far more difficult to reach at the table?|pg||
nt|peachy: 2D 5+ C or D, usually gf|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A 2 C-overcall by East, might have brought some trouble for N/S |pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @C|pg||
nt|flash: SPECS!!!   287 people in here and there's virtual silence!!!   c'mon - talk to us|pg||
nt|sybarra: skip that |pg||
nt|marlowepi: N did not want to lead a trump because he was worried about hearts affording discards. he preferred clubs to diamonds for an unusual reason--they were weaker, i.e. he hoped the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club ten would best serve the defense if the suit was not attacked from his side|pg||
nt|othered1: Not really|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow. well, he has 3 hearts and the 3 of hearts. must be why he bid 3H|pg||
nt|shevek: identical auction in the OR|pg||
nt|shevek: looking at the movie, seems unlikely -3 in the previous bd|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5D is 500- no big deal|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: at least 3@c gets some strength across i imagine|pg||
nt|sybarra: to Zmud|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand will be at sprint speed of play |pg||
nt|pelu: 6@Hs will only cost 800 - but rish that opp bid 7 - and then he also has to bid 7@H|pg||
nt|tez: and also 7@s..then:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: (when he decides play) |pg||
nt|dburn: looks like strong club for both pairs, given that 1@d opening|pg||
nt|flash: private msgs only to any commentator who has +++ in their profile|pg||
nt|hawe45:  5 @C Voidwould - and South is taken by surprise|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Voidwood|pg||
nt|peachy: 2D was 5+ DIAM and usually GF, I made a mistake, thanks friendly spec!!!|pg||
nt|flash: i've seen this b4...|pg||
nt|flash: 5@C (obviously???) intended as exclusion - but....|pg||
nt|peachy: 2H showed H stopper!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|peachy: he surely has it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  7 NT is the spot - nu risc for @D-ruff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  no|pg||
nt|po-s: will Ish double finess clubs?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well,  I will let it drop |pg||
nt|larrymori: but the north hand had no aces too with strength behind|pg||
nt|peachy: oh yes you can, Andrew!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: there was a flat grand (13 tables) at the YC once - about 30 years ago |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is lesson for all......think at first trick |pg||
nt|shevek: and a vulnerable sac !|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after the last auction, this one is making me nervous|pg||
nt|ritong: sementa certainly had 3@s available to ask for help|pg||
nt|othered1: this became an extremely bulky auction.|pg||
nt|ritong: in that suit|pg||
nt|sybarra2: do "we" know where we are going?|pg||
nt|othered1: A lot depends on details of NS's methods, but this doesn't seem to be an easy hand to bid in theirs.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North probably thinks he is cue-ing in support of @H; but unless NS play Reese-Shapiro, that maynotbe so clear to South|pg||
nt|ralfwil: finns bara 8 stick, men kanske svåra att ta|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Inte skulle jag vilja stiga upp mitt i natten för att spela 1@S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jtr: Now 7NT is easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  one of the few hands 2/1 players would have an easy time with|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning, afternoon, evening, as you please|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Roland!|pg||
nt|po-s: it looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 NT is the limit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N would have asked if opener held 3 or 4@S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I just leaned, that 4 @H is not making even with the double dunny-play af @D King - South kills it by playing @D Queen when he takes @H King. In Denmark we have morning - and snow is fallingb|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Madala will probably try for @D ak onside before trying the @C fin|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, Zimmerman has half an imp ahead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 7NT är en annan sak|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbgood: Blackwood is a fine convention|pg||
nt|flash: standings at   http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Very heavy 1 NT - or?|pg||
nt|po-s: or just establish spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N was worried in particular aboutheart strength behind him, which E rated to have for his strong bidding|pg||
nt|tejjyid: apparently they don't|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, first push?|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm sure that is correct|pg||
nt|ritong: i seriously doubt about the reese shapiro part|pg||
nt|ralfwil: viktift att Tomas visar sin entre i @d, så att inte Jonte spelar @c|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jtr: KC is even better|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one pair in 4@H|pg||
nt|peachy: make, prob with overtrick|pg||
nt|flash: check the Daily Bulletins - they're among the best in the world...   a Rigal-Colker production paid advertisement...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: lets see|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: 4@H?! That will make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the second double was quite an overbid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once N cannot even make a responsive double over 3H, really S shd subside|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: two in six|pg||
nt|peachy: nice switch|pg||
nt|xenya: trappy hand -- they are bound to end up in 3N -- and they did|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=long suit game try -- not sure why that is an alert|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt S brought his rabbi  (play ace with K is singleton off side) |pg||
nt|xenya: i womder what system NS are playing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both players strong NT with their regular partners|pg||
nt|shevek: 2 imps only though|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|peachy: he has a cost free chance to try find the Q|pg||
nt|dburn: and of course, whenever you open some minimum in 4th chair partner always punishes you by jumping to 2NT|pg||
nt|flash: 1 key card for @Hs, excluding @Cs...    but a big swing in a short match|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East will attack @C before @D - finessing @D into the hand without @SS-trick|pg||
nt|po-s: as he has very few entries to the spades...|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd think an immediate 3@C with the north hand would be Reesean.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bjeagle.se/bridge/dmlag/0910/running_scores.html  for running scores |pg||
pc|d2|nt|jtr: Didnt bother about the @dQ expecting South to have 3 @ds|pg||
nt|hlortz: bidding will take longer than the play|pg||
nt|jtr: There are a few less experienced pairs in the field remember|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 IMP - the first for NL|pg||
nt|peachy: well, NS are pretty much done, E will make|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hawe45:  Maybe South didÂ´nt like his hand with 2 suits without stopper|pg||
nt|po-s: I think the 4spades doubled got misscored - - it was 2 down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: plus N was already a passed hand so had some leeway to stretch to bid over 3H|pg||
nt|tejjyid: in aconstructive sense, absolutely|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: well played|pg||
nt|peachy: and he did do that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  Fu expected either weaker hand with @D & @S or  stronger would take another call|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 3 trumps, a spade and 4 tricks in the minors -- EW can't do anything about that|pg||
nt|po-s: particularly now|pg||
nt|tejjyid: mind you, opening the hand 1NT is quite Reese-ian as well|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Trodde jag hade det på BBO härom dagen 32 Hp(!) har aldrig haft det förut! någon av er?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nej, 29|pg||
nt|vugraphzeu: För snabbt igen. Ledsen för det.|pg||
nt|peacokk: Ingen fara, jag vet hur det brukar se ut|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Jonte hade nog hellre spelat 2@c eller 1nt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nu fick Jonte dubbla chanser|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: too right -- pure values in @S & @D = old fashioned 1@D instead of 1N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: note - would NOT do that if @D & @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think well judged actions from both players|pg||
nt|po-s: ah, shouldn´t have covered|pg||
nt|larrymori: covering was probably not right|pg||
nt|larrymori: gives an entry to the north hand|pg||
nt|larrymori: the high spades rate to be separate so better than 33 @cs|pg||
nt|po-s: in the other room declarer won the forst heart, finessed - covered diamonds and played a club (queen), unblocked ten and then finessed clubs|pg||
nt|shevek: trump is best|pg||
nt|othered1: But that wasn't an option here|pg||
nt|ritong: no matter what, duboin and sementa are in a bad moment|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|peachy: now S must find the right lead to set, will she? small d but of course we see all cards|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No danger, @H Ace will not be missed|pg||
nt|jcwla: Lavazza got to 3NT so 12 more coming to Bulgaria.  Up 35-0 now.|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Al|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dburn: Patrick Huang tells me that Lin has played for Taiwan in the Venice Cup, and that Nie is from China where she is a celebrated Go player|pg||
nt|peachy: I mean *he|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kantar article in most recent ACBL Bulletin would have said 3N was the ONLY decision|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this cud be down too|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: thanks for the info|pg||
nt|marlowepi: contradiction in terms. if it is the only call, there is no decision|pg||
nt|shevek: club even better|pg||
nt|roswolf: b|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: if you want to spy on the other room while still watching this one   http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|peacokk: Går bra med @SA+@SQ också|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sfoxa:  next door, @s misguessed|pg||
pc|d4|nt|po-s: well....|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sry will make|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  But wait a minute - only 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm -- was declarer supposed to play @CQ before @S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't matter on this hand, but if Klinger held 3@C instead of 4 -- he would be truly endplayed now|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|xenya: a swing is possible here -- but more likely EW in the OR will also reach 3N declared by E |pg||
nt|xenya: but we will see|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice @c10|pg||
nt|ritong: losing a makeable 3NT with 4@s cold, and the very next board being in five voluntarily  ugh|pg||
nt|peacokk: En bet nu oavsett vad Winqvist vänder med|pg||
nt|ralfwil: rätt det räcker inte till|pg||
pc|h9|nt|shevek: I thk he lost 1@s, 1@h and 2@c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the first double was questionable also, since S is not prepared for a response even of 2D. a 2C overcall has flaws too of course|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: what should we say of this 2H overcall, at unfavorable colors facing a passed partner with a poor and short suit, no real hand, and the worst possible holding in the opps' suit? ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the diplomat in me votes for "fearless"|pg||
nt|po-s: West is unlikely to have both spade honours,|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not so here|pg||
nt|roswolf: lavazza need to strike back quickly|pg||
mc|9|nt|hawe45:  Actually South should - after the first @S-finesse - have taken 5 x @C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East shoulkd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ron took him off the @H guess anyway :(|pg||
nt|peacokk: Gyllene Prag har börjat andra halvlek bra, 8-0|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|diablo666: Seven of diamonds works fine aswell :) .|pg||
nt|patricck: surely there should be some variety 7@D for a beer, 8@C for a whiskey :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|diablo666: For E/W in the closed room it´s ok with any red cards :) .|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|diablo666: Not the most scientifical bidding in the closed room, they seem to go a sounder way here...|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|diablo666: or maybe not... :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|diablo666: Both wests started out consulting their partner, and then decided not to listen to them.|pg||
nt|patricck: wouldn't have predicted both pairs getting to slam on this collection|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@C was a good bid....4NT definitely was not|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kaapo: West's 4@C was a splinter, I suppose, and East's 4@H told that his hand is not good in the context|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|patricck: wow....declarer has a chance|pg||
nt|kaapo: If we estimate that East has 3 wasted HCP in clubs, do the remaining 8 or so produce slam? Does not look very good|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|patricck: was the obvious thing to play for, but not what was needed on this occasion|pg||
nt|vugraphzet: west has put his cards face up on the table, asking N for advice|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|patricck: the best advice would be 'dont bid so much'|pg||

nt|Walddk2: One spec tells me that he is quite capable of going down in 4@H|pg||
nt|hlortz: 4 @H not a 0, one in 5@D!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: amazing the pair that stopped in 4@H - Gustawsson/Andersson of Sweden |pg||
nt|andyv:  another slam for NS|pg||
nt|hawe45:  One should learn counting|pg||
nt|hawe45:  600 without any @H-trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a triumph in the play for -500 against nothing:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W will now be bidding 3H a lot:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  :) |pg||
nt|peacokk: Winqvist kommer nog ha rätt ok trumfstöd nu|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: and i left out "low offense-to-defense ratio" :)|pg||
nt|peachy: almost:)|pg||
nt|peachy: 11|pg||
nt|dburn: OK, got it - Nie is he and Lin is she|pg||
nt|bucheister: he made 11|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I presume this is West thinking|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: they shd have a coffee perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: he hoped that D were 33|pg||
nt|sybarra: shall we take book on push for that bd?  |pg||
nt|pelu: pnly 2 results from OR? - strange|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Me or your lying eyes?"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not operator|pg||
nt|ahollan1: P-1@H|pg||
nt|loganrun: Another 3NT|pg||
nt|po-s: You must realize I was here until 4 this morning, now it is 10.24|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: or something stronger :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks nasty for e/w|pg||
nt|shevek: can't blame EW in the OR for bidding 3NT with 27 count...|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|mdgraham: 7N scores 36 out of 58.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  could habe been in  20|pg||
nt|sybarra: they have lost connection 2 times |pg||
nt|flash: i think we'll see that hand in tomorrow's (today"s???) Daily Bulletin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ish & Bach both strong backgrounds in Acol -- would be surprised if they also play 3NN|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s a hand, where you might bid 4 @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then the spades block & N can duck a club|pg||
nt|po-s: I guess he will have to go for clubs then|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but if W doesnt shake a spade...|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: nice coment shirley..i agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: the question will be if they "reconnect" the tables |pg||
nt|larrymori: with the @cs 33 and the |pg||
nt|marlowepi: of course, if N had known toi pass the second double, it would have been NS who collected 500 against nothing|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|marlowepi: I would open the E hand at any colors. many would disagree of course, but it is an opening bid by many well-respected yardsticks|pg||
nt|peachy: 4H was again a transfer to 4S :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  almost :-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they lost connection again..... |pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that there are no connection to OR after 2 x crash|pg||
nt|sybarra: it can be done ...|pg||
nt|pelu: italian waiter ? :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has 3 stoppers in the @S-suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right then must try clubs|pg||
nt|larrymori: it all started with the @d cover|pg||
nt|marlowepi: y|pg||
nt|sybarra: cold  6 @D can they get there?|pg||
nt|othered1: no|pg||
nt|sybarra: may even draw an X  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont see who would double|pg||
nt|po-s: Ish is going Polish?|pg||
nt|po-s: so they shouldn´t get to game now|pg||
nt|ritong: here, finding the sacrifice would be good|pg||
nt|ritong: since 4@h is cold|pg||
nt|shevek: if they can rightside it|pg||
nt|shevek: they did :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Impossible to bid this slam even with other opening bid from S|pg||
nt|sybarra: we had same problem with OR room yesterday |pg||
nt|tez: 1@d=@h's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=art game force|pg||
nt|shevek: Apteker also opened 4@s in bd 19|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even after splinter, N's hand is worth trying|pg||
nt|marlowepi: absolutrely|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like they open 2C on balanced 19/20 in Open Room -  I know that 2D for this is quite popular but using 2C seems a bad idea- maybe I need to know the full system|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 3nt can be made with some inspiration i think - the rabbi would anyway|pg||
nt|peacokk: 2NT Stenberg och 3@C minimum|pg||
mb|6H|nt|pelu: 1@D sh be alerted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=1-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember  NS playing Precision so 1@S limited by failure to open 1@C [16+ HCP]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H u mean|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's what i told the computer to display -- wonder where @S came from|pg||
nt|xenya: i would bid 4@S if my 6 4 were 10 9|pg||
nt|po-s: 1S as usual puppet to 1NT|pg||
nt|othered1: on the @D guess, of course.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Bra bjudet av Tommy!|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: hard to bid it in the "suit" the opps opened|pg||
nt|ralfwil: lätt att bjuda 3@s |pg||
nt|peacokk: Bra utspel|pg||
nt|vugraphzeu: Syd: "Går du på att jag sorterat fel?"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: men som Tore Sandgren uttryckte det trising ordnar sig alltid:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Claim|pg||
nt|peachy: so much to find out, even after 1H opening|pg||
nt|hlortz: cosmic ray no doubt :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Remember it's north's unexpected @H shortness that makes this possible and south won't be able to work things out.|pg||
nt|po-s: but only three spades |pg||
nt|sybarra: and 2 @H? is shortness?|pg||
nt|larrymori: might end here|pg||
nt|larrymori: accepting the xfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure how to bid these perfecto hands...|pg||
nt|po-s: nono, 1NT I´m sure was banatural|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont think 2 @H was accepting transfer |pg||
nt|po-s: "acceptin" yes|pg||
nt|larrymori: why else would he bid it after a natural 1nt|pg||
nt|po-s: bot liking|pg||
nt|po-s: not|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is bot like!|pg||
nt|larrymori: reluctant bid after his move with the 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: is Bach in the tank?  dont like that |pg||
nt|po-s: are you Dutch?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no |pg||
nt|po-s: I know|pg||
nt|larrymori: well if he bids @ds, it will get them out of the hole|pg||
nt|sybarra: but seems strange to me |pg||
nt|sybarra: and possible director call (imo) |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: operator may have missed the subtle pointing to bidding card |pg||
nt|ralfwil: alternativet är väl 4@c men dom spelar kanske inte så|pg||
nt|peacokk: 6@H ger inte mycket för|pg||
nt|peacokk: ger jag inte mycket för|pg||
nt|ralfwil: vad kallar vi detta - stendött?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  in mp, rather be in 3N or 5@d?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A lucky 3 NT here |pg||
nt|po-s: Did he really make nine tricks on the previous hand?|pg||
nt|tez: dbl is take/out to @s..strong hand|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C = 12-14 ball, or 18-19 ball or natural @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: N to double? |pg||
nt|tez: no|pg||
nt|peachy: W has max and six cards, well done to Pass|pg||
nt|po-s: if 3D is only inviting....|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could end here?|pg||
nt|po-s: you kidding?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: isnt it forcing??|pg||
nt|larrymori: gotta be right to raise to game|pg||
nt|po-s: at least invitational IMO - would be forcing for me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: GF by UZPH, but at lease forcing here|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt N can pass,  with huge hand but now what |pg||
nt|marlowepi: well he caNT SPLINTER:):)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: If he "splinters" it will go all pass |pg||
nt|po-s: of course there is the possibility of a misunderstanding (1D opening)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another swedish international predicts  D from N|pg||
nt|po-s: In 3NT he must duck clubs twice to have a chnce|pg||
nt|sybarra: and if 3 @S what does S do? |pg||
nt|tejjyid: Opening leads 101|pg||
nt|shevek: double stopper in @s now, np|pg||
nt|peacokk: Over for it started|pg||
nt|peacokk: Som de säger i andra länder|pg||
nt|peacokk: men finns en hemgångschans med @DK singel hos Syd|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: how would you like to pass as E then put THIS dummy down in a mere 4 spades then watch pd go down?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome to Patrick Huang |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Agree - will West make his 620? Double-finesse in @C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam good facing as little as:  KQxx   Jxx    x   AKxxx|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- when W didn't play his last spade to tap S|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|tez: 5@s or pass i thk|pg||
nt|tez: :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ashley Bach also led a small @C  [the 6]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 3S, planning to bid 4C over3N|pg||
nt|po-s: I didn´t say it would make but that would be his only chance - 3 x clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the dutch guys wont even mind that much if they get to slam, the auction will have taken a year off NS lives|pg||
nt|shevek: this makes easily (1241)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: and that is a slightly aggressive responsive double by South, but part score swings are generated by pushing your opponents around|pg||
nt|flash: note the 2@C call - the 6-card suit outweighs the 4-card length in @Hs, despite the fact that partner is far more likely to hold @Hs than @Cs|pg||
nt|flash: but, we seem to have run into the question of whether the 'free bid' shows values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1 spec telling me that NS are NOT playing Precision at this tournament|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has good cards facing a splinter, but unable to cue 4D he must bid 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and S should have more than that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Jag trodde det var Gunnar Hallberg som sade det|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  declarer will have to decide whether to finesse in spades... if it's on, the 5@d bidders will all be making 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If the spade finesse is on I make 630 vs 620|pg||
nt|peachy: but|pg||
nt|gracelin: Thanks, Shrley and Hi all.|pg||
nt|peachy: oh, spoke too soon|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Patrick|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West was always going to bid 3@s, but no harm in seeing whether his opponents accidentally pass him out in 2@s doubled first|pg||
nt|po-s: what was the phrase? Youthful?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  and if it's off, you are down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently the pair that played 27 in 5@D did it against the leaders, which will do them no harm |pg||
nt|peachy: i see no chance for OT|pg||
nt|tez: they are leading 2/4|pg||
nt|sybarra: again we see the lead middle from 3 |pg||
nt|pelu: EW can defeat 4@S on a @S lead (DD decl can 2xfiness in @D and make)|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, he took the class|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be the decisive board|pg||
nt|ralfwil: men bara nära:)|pg||
nt|peacokk: då ska man "bara" slipper @C ut och @SK på klipp|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: all leads 2/4......better way to describe it   (thx spec) |pg||
nt|hawe45:  But with the @S-vois, South has a few values|pg||
nt|hawe45:  void|pg||
nt|peachy: if 3D was GF he cant pass now...or can he|pg||
nt|flash: SJ Simon counseled :  how much worse could your hand be...    not much!!!???|pg||
nt|peachy: Also "How to bid misfits?"  A: "Don't"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He must take his chance - 4 @c was the first bid from North, which was - maybe - NOT forcing|pg||
nt|peachy: a spec says 3D asked for D stopper|pg||
nt|flash: most would play a cue bid forcing to game in major or NT, but only to 4-level in minor???|pg||
nt|peachy: I think that is a sensible way to play it|pg||
nt|flash: again, need to remove shoes to count losers in S hand???|pg||
nt|peachy: hearts behaving, Bulgaria can hardly lose on this deal, or Lavazza gain|pg||
nt|ritong: everybody made their duty|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|dburn: I suppose on this lie of cards North-South actually had some play for 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzeu: Jag han inte se vad NS lade.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tez: 3 down is bad news for ew|pg||
nt|pelu: so all leads = I have a higher card in this suit!!|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes horrible suit breaks for decalarer good pass by south|pg||
nt|tez: if you have singleton?|pg||
nt|tez: lol:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: again OR just back,  I think the Italian waiters should be removed from that room!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Matt Mullamphy seems to be operating a bit here -- maybe HOPING to get to 8@S with his 2 sure trump tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: this is very close|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: i would feel like the unluckiest person born|pg||
nt|peachy: I love all our Polish specs who help with NS system interpretation, for the benefit of all our gallery|pg||
nt|flash: 250 will be 6 IMPs back - tightening the match significantly|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will South find out, that this lead is a singleton?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: without def help, that is|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N were sure both on same page, would probably follow through with 4C. but wants as little confusion as possible hence 4D|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S9 is discouraging|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump lead may make N work|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: nice start for decl|pg||
nt|hlortz: still looks like -800 though|pg||
nt|tez: 1 way ticket for 800:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yep|pg||
nt|sybarra: E is smart enough to know that N would not X with clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and with the 2 @S bid, the long clubs should be with S |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think N could have tried 5C over 4H, but he weas undoubtedly afraid S might think all this was cuebidding for hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think S bid 4 @H because he thought that was perhaps where they were suppose to play |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 7 rounds of bidding & 7 kilos of sweat later, a push|pg||
pc|h4|nt|peachy: and they arent helping so far|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and so declarer. but what about defence?|pg||
nt|peachy: but not for 3C|pg||
nt|po-s: true - but declarer is supposed to bid 1NT normally with the balanced hand|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Yes I think so too Goeffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup 14 imps to the leaders|pg||
pc|c8|nt|shevek: 2@s over 2@c was a Xfer to 2NT|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|xenya: EW seem to bid every game in sight -- and a little bit more|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Difficult to know, but didÂ´nt E/W have easy 500 here?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|flash: i've had a question about the 'free bid' issue|pg||
nt|po-s: but there defenders began with a club|pg||
nt|ralfwil: easy -1 after  a @s ruff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S!!!|pg||
nt|xenya: vital, yes, but can wait|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hawe45:  Put @D 3-1 and this would cost|pg||
nt|sybarra: think that bidding might be discussed later?|pg||
nt|sybarra: (I do) |pg||
nt|po-s: not for that long|pg||
nt|larrymori: Bach rescued his side by bidding 3@d|pg||
pc|d9|nt|peachy: brb get coffee|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N was probably always doomed to succeed, but trump lead makes him sweat more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if nobody has mentioned  halftime scores now posted at  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even after this start, N has a lot of work|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: why not q of @H?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low spade lead from getgo needed to hold it to 4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tez: @h again pls|pg||
nt|flash: there was a marvelous historical (not hysterical) explanation of the roots of this concept in a recent Bridge World|pg||
nt|flash: my roth-stone training suggests that is you aren't forced to make a call, any call you choose to make is for a reason|pg||
nt|flash: usually values, although extra shape might compensate|pg||
nt|flash: the 'modern' game is, of course, on a totally different tack|pg||
nt|jcwla: Lavazza on the board with an overtrick IMP in 3NT on 21.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also a logical lead since E has clubs, W surely has Ds, and hearts dont rate to be a major source of tricks for NS|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ritong: just for fun|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|dburn: that would have been trickier - not sure why South did not see it through by bidding 3@d to show both red suits|pg||
mc|10|nt|peachy: well, not to crash your party, but I think the latter applied here|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|3C!|an|min|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|kaapo: I'm not a great fan of the Swedish style of bidding Stenberg 2NT with just 3-card support. Then again they succeed much better than we do so I may not have the right to critisize :)...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|patricck: makes no difference on this hand but J@H wouldn't be my choice of lead, lots of combinations where you can destroy partner's trump tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||

nt|Walddk2: ARF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is always right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: also when he isn't|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess I would ask if you sit for the X on the N hand |pg||
nt|peachy: this could still we a tiny plus for BEAUTY against 3H|pg||
nt|peachy: hah, you belong to the school of "Always bid to win the post mortem" :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: show of hands -- who thought that hand would NEVER end|pg||
nt|peachy: Lavazza not used to scores like this|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if east does not shift to @C, then declarer can get a @H ruff and a spade trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  West is lucky here - a Multi would nok be a success|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean - South opening|pg||
nt|tez: other room 4@s doubled..specs said:)|pg||
nt|flash: specs now up to 387 and still very little harassment...   i mean few comments   :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and Henri thought it was his eyes|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: in the unlikely event that i passed originally as E, i doubt i could bring myself to pass 4S when pd bids it facing a passed hand at unfavorable vul with an unlinmited hand behind ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: him. if i did summon such conservatism, and then watched 4S go down, i'd head for the bar|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not used to countries that drink tea instead of coffee either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that confirms it -- definitely NOT Precision|pg||
nt|shevek: back to part scores....|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Italy keeps on trying 3 NT with 24 balanced HCP|pg||
nt|xenya: well it seems there were for the defence that might have let it through and declarer was never more than 1 down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 11 tricks in nt or @d on EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: not much of fit anywhere|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And in 3 NT, you must hunt the 9th trick|pg||
nt|Walddk4: God morgon PO|pg||
mb|2C|nt|xenya: this might be interesting|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yeah - @H not 3-3|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  May be doubled|pg||
nt|po-s: Sara needs to take 10 more victory points han SouthSweden|pg||
nt|shevek: 1NT, any idea?|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can all get whatever we are imbibing in here,  this is mundane |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5D a good save. 4S cold single dummy on elimination thanks to 9 of hearts|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what now from South?|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@h?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: because of mirror distribution, 6@D is down|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s need something good to happen here|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S passes another opening bid by many standards|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, if the suits were majors I'd open.|pg||
nt|loganrun: Forcing|pg||
nt|shevek: hmmm|pg||
nt|po-s: probably 1NT forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: naw, it would have been a scoop to watch a double sunstroke by balzmud|pg||
nt|peachy: I dont know their methods, but X could be Stayman/ish or it could be "values"|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chick: I'd open S at any vul|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would be better to have the minors reversed, but you cant have everything all the time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S has an interesting problem over 1H. i dont think 2H gets the job done. prefer 3H|pg||
nt|peachy: splinter would be my choice|pg||
nt|xenya: or cruel rather|pg||
nt|sybarra: does making only 4 seem 1 too few?|pg||
nt|loganrun: this part score may well be doubled|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will N pass or D?|pg||
nt|xenya: *were options |pg||
nt|shevek: south found a way to show some stuff|pg||
nt|ritong: can happen, of course, but only once a century|pg||
nt|sybarra2: :) |pg||
nt|tejjyid: nasty hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: I must confess I would not be thinking suit play w/the S hand.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is the hand which is the reason they tell you NOT to overbid your 6-5 shapes |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Maybe someone in the audience can tell us what 2@D is|pg||
nt|peachy: club position fortunate|pg||
nt|po-s: hearts never break friendly in Japan|pg||
nt|peachy: aonly a few ricks for declarer here, we'll see how few|pg||
nt|peachy: tricks*|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This time - in 3 NT - the @D-suit must be handled well|pg||
nt|po-s: now 2S|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well maybe not|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S10 ias important / without a @S in Sount, North could be endplayed for the 12th yrisk in 6 @D|pg||
nt|po-s: The 3C in closed - East was thrown in after one diamond ducked (no heart lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Han håller väl på att äta frukost|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: might even keep West out  |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Brave man, East|pg||
nt|shevek: what was wrong with pass?|pg||
nt|po-s: I think they play 14-16 NT so the 10point responder always assumes 16|pg||
nt|sybarra2: is N coming in ?  ah yess|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: on this day in history, a modern, aggressive player passed a rotten 11-count in 2nd chair...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Otherwise no entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will this break the streak of all hands declared by either North or West?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: like a @DA lead on 6@S perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: which would in your book be weaker, Pass or 4D by N over 3H?|pg||
nt|tez: makeable 7@h..i belive they will stop 4@h|pg||
nt|pelu: the slam in board 5 was missed in OR (4@S + 3)|pg||
nt|tez: they are not playing with open cards:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting the OR is connected to us  but we are not reconnected to them |pg||
nt|sybarra: or should I say they were|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  temptation  to compete on 5th level?|pg||
nt|peachy: I think 2D here was very reasonable though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: X and lead trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Anyone for a double of 4@H at MP?|pg||
nt|jtr: Might be necessary|pg||
nt|jtr: If we make 3@s|pg||
nt|xenya: but not that UNfriendly, surely|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H = 10-13, 2NT asking - 3@C = minimum, 3@D asking for singleton, 3Nt = singleton @S|pg||
nt|tez: 4@c pls|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S X making, so 5@CX only cost 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|hawe45:  At this level no problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: (not being picky sorry)|pg||
nt|hlortz: that IMP on 21 is suspect even it looked like 660 to me tho maybe not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like 2@C may be  18-19 bal   [same as EW 2@D opener]|pg||
nt|po-s: is double penalty?|pg||
nt|loganrun: weak raise in spades|pg||
nt|peacokk: 2@h, en stöld, @SK och @DA blir 5 stick för försvaret|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: You'll get 200 here, though|pg||
nt|sybarra: although on k of @S lead,  anything over 4 is unattrative |pg||
nt|po-s: is this a hand that wants ruffs or to tap declarer?|pg||
nt|po-s: tap apparently|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South does his best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has a lot of losers....maybe better to pass if you like your offensive chances, inviting pd to bid 5S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still, at least 11 spades and not much defense. when in doubt bid one more|pg||
nt|shevek: he wasn't keen to be declarer|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2D forcing to suit agreement|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone translate this?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, nowthere are 14@C between WEst & North|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he has to bid 2@D|pg||
nt|po-s: it actually looks like Madala opened 1NT on the previous hand |pg||
nt|shevek: 4@s good contract as the cards lie|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@S can be made by south|pg||
nt|peacokk: Inspirerat utspel|pg||
pc|cA|nt|peachy: ok, maybe S should have opened, this is madness|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W would probably have liked to show spade values, but hard to do that without concealinbg the heart support, and there is likely to be no convenient time later to show support|pg||
nt|marlowepi: making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clubs ruff up for 3 discards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now W will REALLYYYYYYYY wish he had shown spade values:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: she, sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds, 2 clubs    at least|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he would be happy with four - that would mean his opponents could make 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: as indeed they can - may have stolen the pot here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  looks like 300|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - behind the suit|pg||
nt|loganrun: after partner doubled for takeout - sure|pg||
nt|po-s: not on this particular one...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: only by guesswork|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that isn;t an overbid - but some like to have a 2-way pre-empt-y 3@D bid here|pg||
nt|peachy: could still make, despite best lead and all that|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  3 diamonds possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And probably only 1 club|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Discarding the @D 8 more or less denies the position of the King|pg||
nt|peachy: probably best to go after clubs, need some of them any way|pg||
nt|peachy: I mean first|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I vote for a small @D now!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables are not linked I'm afraid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 630 is the score on 7 in the open room|pg||
nt|xenya: this can be beaten |pg||
nt|xenya: with careful defence|pg||
nt|peachy: three unescapable losers, will be a ppush|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not so easy to defend - @D-ruffs etc.|pg||
nt|po-s: but West will overruff hearts or clubs very soon|pg||
nt|loganrun: and south has trouble getting back to hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Anyway, this gave noting away, the @H-finesse South can handle himself|pg||
nt|po-s: he will probably try the CQ which holds, then what?|pg||
nt|po-s: all this one needs is two finesses|pg||
nt|shevek: losing a@s, a @d and a @c|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jtr: Not 500?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not if they don't double|pg||
nt|jtr: oh right  i see|pg||
nt|hlortz: i'd rather bid 3@H the 1st round. - no not a splinter :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think this N-S pair plays weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H seems a bit of a punt with a queen-high hand|pg||
nt|tez: wrang i m here ..trust me pls:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like 11 tricks to me too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6 trumps, 2 ruffs, 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the hand, N will tell S he should have had the 7 of clubs in place of the 6|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess so, in fact|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if you tap him off, he gets 8 tricks by position|pg||
nt|peacokk: Inte helt självklart hur man ska spela det här|pg||
pc|h8|nt|flash: and, lo and behold, the auction proceeded smoothly (in both rooms)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another NT-bid without a sure stopper...|pg||
nt|po-s: good sacrifice against 120|pg||
pc|h9|nt|shevek: play a @d maybe?|pg||
nt|peachy: i think you are right|pg||
nt|shevek: east can't get in|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: almost same auction other room,  but instead of 2 nt, E bid 2 sp |pg||
nt|loganrun: Jack of diamonds works best|pg||
nt|po-s: maybe a diamond directly, but sometimes West has the CA|pg||
nt|loganrun: great card|pg||
nt|shevek: for different reasons neither west nor east can play trumps :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has by far the best reason|pg||
nt|ritong: strong three suiters often generate weird auctions|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you said it first!|pg||
nt|peacokk: Om de hittar @Hstölden|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @d break will be big disaster for declarer|pg||
nt|po-s: apprximately 2 down?|pg||
nt|xenya: well W dropped a trick when he failed to put up the Q, but that was far from obvious?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes you told him 7@H he could have just bid 6 LOL|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now no @D-finesse|pg||
nt|flash: low @S a bit surprising?   North would like the 9 to lead the Q, but...|pg||
nt|flash: ah - there was a 1@S call...|pg||
nt|peachy: i was thinking it, maybe I said it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/CC/BalickiZmudzinski.pdf   this may help those of you wanting cc|pg||
nt|ritong: i think it even can be said that it is a nightmare for natural systems|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hawe45:  Any lead 660|pg||
nt|xenya: @SA, 3 clubs and 2 diamonds, including a ruff |pg||
nt|po-s: So East wins and plays a heart, D ruff, Club to ace? and a heart?|pg||
nt|shevek: ouch|pg||
nt|po-s: since undoubled|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told:1@C is their opening bid, 1@D = negative or some stronger, 1@H = either 12-14 bal with better hearts than spades, or one of the stronger versions of 1@C with 4+ hearts, ...|pg||
nt|othered1: not enough ... |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: The wrong singleton for a start one could say|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mistiming let's @HT score?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The non-competitive auctions continue.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm not taking the credit - there is an army of spectators who are better declarers than I|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bjeagle.se/bridge/dmlag/0910/running_scores.html   running scores |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hlortz: well weak jump shifts would realte to 2@H  3@H either weak or a splinter|pg||
nt|xenya: S was naturally hoping for a club honour when he bid 3N -- that was not to be|pg||
nt|shevek: hmmmm|pg||
nt|hawe45:  670 os their way|pg||
nt|othered1: to force to game|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Tråkigt att lämna, men ha en intressant dag, så ses vi kanske i eftermiddag|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hawe45:  West is forced to play @C - and South will make his living by establishing the 5th @D|pg||
nt|po-s: and in the other room West bid 1H making one finesse ok|pg||
nt|xenya: could be same 2 off on this lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @c10 instead of @c9....|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: one spade and two clubs would be different|pg||
nt|hlortz: /relate/|pg||
nt|gracelin: Nie had conquered the world of  "Go" some 20 years ago and turned his interest to bridge in recent years.|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, u r right, four|pg||
nt|shevek: why so keen? to play @h?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  For no reason|pg||
nt|po-s: aces should mostly be ducked - a lesson which has not yet reached my country|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hawe45:  But here only 600|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cancel, too early here|pg||
nt|peachy: he can still take 9|pg||
nt|peachy: or more if def allows :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So in fact it was a good lead, leading the @S King, and West takes 11 tricks - here only 9|pg||
nt|peachy: same lead in OR, that ALONE tells me it was a good lead, plus, I would have led Q or 10 = further evidence...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N plays a third spoade and throws a D, so can W, and E plays a fourth spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not 100% inescapable. but the defense is easy enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: chance for 1 imp for lavazza|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|othered1: x probably T/O then zmudzinski showed his additional stregth and spade fit|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|sfoxa:  next door 4@s made when defence offered @c trick to declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: slightly surprised that South, who had a maximum for his initial pass, did not take some action when a weak no trump came back|pg||
nt|flash: we might gain by noticing that the players at this level aren't afraid to pause and consider their play(s)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: unlikely Goef|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|peachy: or that in Strong Club context, he didnt open|pg||
nt|flash: we might gain even more by noticing when they pause|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: so you will be in Reno next month?|pg||
nt|xenya: a club honour in the N hand that is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or K & Q to fall singleton |pg||
nt|jcwla: So a boring 1-IMP hand. :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|chick: probably private, too :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Well,that's what they have, so it's plausible that's what the auction means|pg||
nt|tejjyid: unlikeNS EW have been playing together long enough toknow their system |pg||
nt|ritong: zmud s problem is " can i cater with @sKJxx with north"  if the answer is yes, he will play the 10|pg||
nt|ritong: if the answer is no, well..|pg||
nt|sybarra2: but is N coming in with kjxx of spade  |pg||
nt|ritong: good point shirley|pg||
nt|tejjyid: West may not play North for 8 @C|pg||
nt|sybarra2: have operated for e/w several times. they take a long time then play very fast at end |pg||
nt|sybarra2: or call a card and explain play, show hands and every one puts cards back in box |pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: well, justice served, in a sense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry provate|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps an endplay in diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does @CK transfer threat for a squeeze?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems to me that either way W gets an overruff. maybe i am missing something|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, not much chance to catch up if the cards dont cooperate by giving some options|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so now the handdemonstrates why lowlevel penalty X's vanished from the game|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|gracelin: Thanks for the trainingin "Go", he is a very good card plaer in bridge, but his biddng is a bit old fashioned.|pg||
nt|peacokk: Väst har kommit illa till |pg||
pc|dA|nt|flash: @C2 is UDA - encouraging|pg||
nt|peachy: where could he get rid of them?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've seen some New Zealand and Australian pairs using this 2@C opener -- but don't recall ever seeing it from an ACBL representative|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tez: no|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  End-plys possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  play|pg||
nt|peachy: The open room had some conn probs in earlier matches|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H Ace, @C KIng, @H back and the @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South knowa WeatÂ´s distribution|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And doesÂ´nt matter, whether West has single og double @H from the beginning|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But badly enough, the @C Jack comes down, which means 10 tricks without this endplay|pg||
nt|sybarra: so he overkilled |pg||
nt|tez: no=undo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for Total Trick fans -- this hand is off by 2!  [22 trump but each side can only make 10 tricks]|pg||
nt|tejjyid: every bridge hand demosntrates something :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|xenya: note that NS are lucky in that S has the @S8|pg||
nt|peacokk: Han kommer givetvis gå hem|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hawe45:  Strange @H-shift anyway|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcwla: Lavazza has now bid to slam on 22 -- off two top tricks -- so the rout continues.|pg||
nt|shevek: claim 11|pg||
pc|d6|nt|peachy: i dont understand this|pg||
nt|peachy: it may be a failing on my part!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry, East didÂ´nt tahe the @C Ace, sleeping !!!|pg||
nt|peachy: the pause here probably is some external prob, surely declarer is not thinking like this'|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now safe to play last trump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: playing hearts|pg||
nt|hlortz: surely only 620//|pg||
nt|peachy: I think you giving too little credit to EW then :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: 200 - 10/58 for NS|pg||

nt|loganrun: Jack of diamonds was a great card but not as good as what happened|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe it was an element of surprise for west |pg||
nt|hawe45:  West was too fast, East could hardly have a double with only small @D|pg||
nt|loganrun: for surprise - he took awhile to play the ace|pg||
nt|po-s: kids is nice - Johan just turned 50|pg||
nt|marlowepi: suppose W wins lead in hand and leads club|pg||

nt|roswolf: if a trump lead|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sfoxa:  lot of spades by NS, but 9 tricks only|pg||
nt|bbramley: hello everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: is this a funky multi?  |pg||
nt|xenya: looks like N bid 2@D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He must have made the end/play / South should have led the small @S...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i think North was squeezed out of his @S winners and thrown in for the 12th trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: multi|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This could be trouble for N-S|pg||
nt|peachy: a lucky 12 tricks here, but we'll see|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - 1NT was 14-16, which explains why it bought the hand on the previous deal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you know the players in OR P-O?|pg||
nt|po-s: Pass???|pg||
nt|po-s: in slam you might |pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl - a 11-15 bal hand or very strong|pg||
nt|ralfwil: intressant att se vad Jonte väljer för bud|pg||
nt|peacokk: Intressant budläge för Hörnfeldt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Är inte Gyllene Prag en restaurang i Göteborg?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: hi Bart|pg||
nt|tez: hi Bart:)|pg||
nt|pelu: NS in OR also missed 3NT in board 4 - so the standing is 3-33!|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 very exciting pais here Kit,  however  because of crashes rooms not connected,  Peter has running score |pg||
nt|bbramley: can zmud bid 1NT here to show 4@S and minor?|pg||
nt|flash: halfway through the match - close and entertaining|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 4+  unless exactly 4=4=3=2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would pass over 1 @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not find on cc |pg||
nt|marlowepi: sounds like a dance shirley|pg||
nt|xenya: or 3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT looks not much different from 6 clubs|pg||
nt|shevek: I'm sure the @d finesse would have helped anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: duboin can only bid 3NT i guess|pg||
nt|tejjyid: likely to be flat, anyway, OR going down in 5@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: excellent 3@H preempt|pg||
nt|tejjyid: spiteful|pg||
nt|ritong: but he visibly wonders about that|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and if South bids 3 nt...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what will west lead ?|pg||

mb|2D!|an|spader och en färg till|nt|tez: negative free bid working here|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: this 4S is too strong for my standards, cannot have two side suits controlled|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i don't know what they did in match 9|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: lol|pg||

nt|peachy: is 1H everyone's choice?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|sybarra: is that raptor? |pg||
nt|sybarra: or is there a name for it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: top 8 teams qualify for tomorrow's quarter final|pg||
nt|peachy: seems the organizers dont post match results until the following match is completed, been that way so far|pg||
nt|tejjyid: doubt it, but pretty much Euro-expert standard|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh oh   |pg||
nt|peachy: oh well, guess it works to mix it up...!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S took a line of play that could never succeed there|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm rooting for the Netherlands to get on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|bbramley: i don't know the name, i just know how they play|pg||
nt|peachy: best bridge on the planet in front of us, what a treat|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no mucking around with the N cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: has a good hand.....|pg||
nt|tejjyid: How cn SOuth resist kicking now?|pg||
nt|othered1: Plenty of room in a passed hand for what you need for slam.|pg||
nt|ritong: oh, he can|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming @h ace is out, and it surely is, the five level is not safe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nu hittar man säkert 4@H. Have fun :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  They might be there after board 7 - but we need OR-result|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No, they lost 1 IMP|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure you have played agst them |pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D? -- major + minor?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well lookee here|pg||
nt|po-s: weird if multi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H would have been Double Negative|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Saved |pg||
nt|peachy: I guess they will get to this slam now, E showing shape I assume|pg||
nt|flash: how light does one open in 3rd chair?   the more lead-directional the call, the lighter it might be???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=one-round force|pg||
nt|chick: a clear violation of Burn's Law|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone else prefer to pass 1@S?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: really?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and lots of others too I suspect|pg||
nt|vugraphzcj: Sorry,last 3 trick is C. N lead.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good pass by Madala downgrading his soft values|pg||
nt|roswolf: certainly i would do so if the multi could be based on a 5 card major as often happens|pg||
nt|shevek: some value dbl by south, followed by 3@c, better hand than bidding 3@c over 2@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: north shouls respect pards decision|pg||
nt|ralfwil: tror nog på pass från Johan|pg||
nt|ralfwil: har spelat ett antal givar med honom|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  lots of rescuing done today|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S absolutely needed trumps 22 because one club had to be ruffed to set up the suit, and later a spade had to be ruffed. if Ds are 3-1 the hand cant make|pg||
nt|peachy: but don't know|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass would be eminently sensible|pg||
nt|chick: no, but I prefer to bid 2@D over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would prefer 1N if semi-force or non-force|pg||
nt|jcwla: E did not switch to @S when in with @HA -- all went bye bye on the @D's -- 11 to Lavazza on 22|pg||
nt|hlortz: odd looking to me west dbls stiff in unbid suit  east with k 5th doesnt bid them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe it shows a near-opening in one major|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hlortz: little did wwest know a spade preference was coming on his left|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 8:  N  3NT-1 in the OR|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, Roland said earlier was made with +1 bd7|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes pard bids 2 @D,  if not I will |pg||
nt|sybarra: (over 2 @C)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly -- you just don't know what hand partner holds for 2@C when 1N is absolute force|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, should have been -300 -- unless W didn't play 2 rounds of hearts at the end|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hans -- is your plan to PASS reopening DBL?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No the 1 NT, which should mean, that I was too week for 1 NT directly |pg||
nt|shevek: guesses for the lead?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if 3Nt shows spade stop then maybe on way to 6C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult for North to find killing lead if they do get there|pg||
nt|shevek: it's not south who is thinking|pg||
nt|shevek: the operator has to enter both bids in the same time|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the fact that East did not bid 3NT over 3C but stopped off to show heart ace is the key|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, really|pg||
nt|othered1: 4N natural or asking?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: partner has the filthiest 4@S bid u can imagine and slam is still playable|pg||
nt|ritong: partner can have any blank 6/5|pg||
nt|ritong: or so|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, the 5 level would stlll be safe|pg||
nt|ritong: more or less:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but not for me - need the @H 10 as well|pg||
nt|peachy: with a slightly different layout they dont have game and we go for 500|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I assume 2@H shows @S|pg||
nt|jcwla: As long as you can be sure they'll transfer so you're on lead anyway...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and 3@H is soem  kind of Choice of Games - now South wondering if he has done enough|pg||
nt|peachy: dubious pleasure thin hand at least|pg||
nt|peachy: in this hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth can't be much worse though & they are 50 imps down|pg||
nt|tejjyid: plus, jsut made a slam missing 2 Aces; you don;twant to waste a lucky set!|pg||
nt|peachy: all this head spinning strategy|pg||
nt|tejjyid: SJ SImon said when you had evidence you werelucky you should push harder|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think 5@C now isOK, but can North cooperate?|pg||
nt|peachy: rubber, but perhaps still valid in duplicate|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Maybe the @D are solid enough for himto show the K? It's very hard; the 6th @S makes so much difference, but the guy who has itcan't see the AK or J|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: doubling 2@H is an option|pg||
nt|chick: yes, raija, and it kept them out of a very good (but unfortunately unmakeable) slam|pg||
nt|xenya: on 22, EW in the OR did bid and make 3N on basically the same defence: @H lead ducked by N|pg||
nt|po-s: how about "Polish"?|pg||
nt|bbramley: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E apparently assumed N had announced 4 spades so the double would be more for clubs and hearts. not condoning that line of thought just attempting to explain|pg||
nt|hlortz: unless 2@H was xfer to @S|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|peachy: no chance, without def erring|pg||
nt|tez: i m chicken..i have no idea for convention names|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello po, you are always welcome :)|pg||
nt|tez: hi PO|pg||
nt|othered1: which brings us back to playing the other 6+card fit a level lower :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that would make it hard to play 2H, the single most likely correct contract when W doubles|pg||
nt|othered1: IN OR, Nunes bid a calm 3N over 3@H.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: All too hard, thinks South|pg||
nt|shevek: he did|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm north punts|pg||
nt|peacokk: Otur för Hörnfeldt har att partnern har 9 av sina 10 hp i andra färger än hans|pg||
nt|peacokk: Om Väst inte öppnar med 1NT är 4@H ett väldigt bra kontrakt. Efter 1NT blev det genast klart sämre|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  any reason for West to bid immediately?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He feared a pass by North who could well have had a heart fit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  then|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 2M being the bad weak 2|pg||
nt|larrymori: maybe more like 10(good 9) to 13|pg||
nt|po-s: so the actually play Ekeblad|pg||
nt|larrymori: seems logical|pg||
nt|marlowepi: more like Inkblot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you see what you want to see:)|pg||
nt|larrymori: 5M and 4+ m|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of a "reverse" muiderberg|pg||
nt|po-s: some of us might even jump to game with East hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: bidding the minor |pg||
nt|larrymori: except he had @ss so he probably went low|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very soft shape for a game bid. since you have already started with a preempt & gotten by N, you can make the accurate valuation bid of 3H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: another wrong side|pg||
nt|po-s: he always does|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jbgood: still - with no club fit..|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's wait - errare humanum est|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html  tourney site |pg||
nt|flash: still a long way to go for N-S to reach game after this start?   (the balancing X certainly helped)|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting lead here|pg||
nt|loganrun: This has no chance even on a non club lead as long as West is still not thinking about the last hand|pg||
nt|po-s: if a spade, three rounds of diamonds, ruffed overruffed, and a heart|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hlortz: this will make with a good view in @H suit i guess|pg||
nt|po-s: thanks - it is bedtime but I must see my expartner overbid - alittle|pg||
nt|peachy: i am betting on diam lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think the Italian pairs often use DBL in mid auction to just say  extra points|pg||
nt|loganrun: the 6 and 7 of hearts come into play|pg||
nt|shevek: ok kids, against suit contracts we lead shortage |pg||
nt|shevek: oops|pg||
nt|shevek: 5@c might make an overtrick for a loss of 1 imp|pg||
nt|odysseus69: much better thn 3NT|pg||
nt|shevek: agree, no justice|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: holding four bad hearts i would incline to pass. game is unlikely and i have some defense. if pd bids after i pass, i will be very well placed to act, but if i bid 1N, i will have ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to stop bidding before i have much usefuyl info|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting situation for Klinger if Apteker does Pass 1@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all that from a guy who has to blow the dust off the green card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SA then ruffing finesse might hold this to down 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh my |pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe 4N wasn't asking, else how could north go?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: gee, he wanted more than one Ace? How was his partner to know when to go on?|pg||
nt|ritong: situation is not improving for NS|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess 6@S is no worse than 3NT, with more upside|pg||
nt|roswolf: std play to neutraluse the spade suit|pg||
nt|shevek: has to switch to @d|pg||
nt|shevek: Madala did , I'm told|pg||
nt|roswolf: nothing else seems attractive|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: and which one is ex?|pg||
nt|sybarra: (sorry I do not know) |pg||
nt|hlortz: needs a deep finesse here :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: i don't think he can make it even with a perfect guess - more clubs will sink it|pg||
nt|tez: many thanks all..here 4.09 am..bye all..see you..enjoyed|pg||
nt|hlortz: really?n follow to 3 @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Tez @H  pleasant dreams |pg||
nt|bbramley: i see, henry, so he'll threaten to dump both spades - yes, that would be PERFECT guessing|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL at the end of the day this could be a pick up |pg||
nt|ritong: they might go slowly to the score comparison|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sfoxa:  we have comfortable sitting at home, with coffee and double-dummy deals, not so they|pg||
nt|peachy: indeed, pressure of a big event|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South must be declarer at this board, we might see an NL-score  now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North got a diamond lead in the other room|pg||
nt|hlortz: lol yes the deep 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|pelu: also in 4@H in OR - but here the lead: a small @S from S?????????????????|pg||
nt|hlortz: oops|pg||
nt|peachy: N did well to show his max, assumedly Dbl meant it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but don't quote me on that|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting bidding - most pairs promise another bid after a cue (unpassed hand)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: 10 imps|pg||
nt|pelu: to K|pg||
nt|sybarra: I said "ugh"  and would you believe there is spec with that bbo name? |pg||
nt|flash: if South, holding KJx, wouldn't bid NT, that was no longer a possible/plausible strain|pg||
nt|peachy: OR overcalled 1NT with S hand, no wonder they got to game|pg||
nt|hlortz: well unless 2@D xfer not making the case for it im just confused :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wel sure, but the question is why E ddnt bid spades. of course it shows extras|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West surely counted on a @C-.suit in East|pg||
nt|po-s: If you guys don´t stop I´ll leave and go back to bed - but I guess that would please yoy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D 2 told me something|pg||
nt|larrymori: without them got to jack it up but might get the transfer 4@s bid|pg||
nt|po-s: moment of truth|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You canÂ´nt go wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: how about 3N EW (suggested by a spectator)?|pg||
nt|tez: hi all|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and world-wide watching |pg||
nt|ahollan1: now lead any minor for down 2  -- even @DJ works -- ruff, @HA  @D ruff @C uppercut to re-establish @C10|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they bid 2D a;ready|pg||
nt|sybarra: I bet 3 @H was pass or correct|pg||
nt|shevek: now might make|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|s8|nt|peachy: so it could be a dblwhammy for them, dbld game and a plus unmaking slam.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ah -- yes i can live with that tactic|pg||
nt|larrymori: i will bet lol|pg||
nt|shevek: @ss were dead....|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hlortz: oops my bad lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is a cnfusing auction:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: see i *said* i was confused.. meanwhile 3@C not a thing of beauty|pg||
nt|jcwla: As Raija predicted 23 a push so 35-12 at the halfway mark.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no but he has an awfully good hand and i dont see a better call for him if he is going to bid again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe it helps to know that both of the round kings are offside :)|pg||
nt|xenya: this inelegant contract might make...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: ,yes, via Rome perhaps|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  But even on a @D-lead from East, you should have 10 tricks|pg||
nt|po-s: must be a commentator|pg||
nt|peachy: lost that one|pg||
nt|shevek: he was thinking abt @ds chris :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess that works too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The @h shift is rather clear|pg||
nt|ritong: hey tez:) welcome|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c9|nt|Walddk4: Won @DK at trick 2, advanced @CQ and got clubs wrong later, playing for the double finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: Merijn home here, fortuitous rightsiding|pg||
nt|po-s: hmm, overruff and a heart would make it more difficult for West|pg||
pc|h6|nt|peachy: in a dition to different club play then|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10 IMPs to NL|pg||
nt|bbramley: that will simplify the defense - if he hadn't cashed @SA it gets complicated|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with 4-4 in majors on S odds are good for a @d Hx on S|pg||
nt|hlortz: lavazza lucky on bd 22 or it would be lots to not much|pg||
nt|po-s: I think the SJ could never be right|pg||
nt|roswolf: building his 9 th trick|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Not sure how much -150 is worth|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mike?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: about 5/58 at the moment|pg||
nt|shevek: 10 imps, wd Madala|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a lifeline is thrown to lavazza|pg||
pc|c6|nt|peachy: But looking at past hands in this match, I dont expect them to be in slam other room, no matter how biddable|pg||
nt|peachy: I am glad that the big name teams are not yet on vugraph, giving others the chance to experience that thrill as players|pg||
nt|flash: of course, Mandala, youngster that he (still) is, decided that the South hand was a 1NT overcall   :)|pg||
nt|shevek: fair enough, south knows the opening lead lesson , he thought west was short!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting possibility for end-playing W for @c lead|pg||
mc|9|nt|ahollan1: or East thought 2N was different from what West thought|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C-lead would have been better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or just small club toward Jack|pg||
nt|po-s: if they play 3NT I lead club from North|pg||

nt|patricck: Both North and South could have bid one less, but both actions they actually took are reasonable, if slightly aggressive|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|patricck: Gyllene Praag need some imps in a hurry, that can only happen here if EW get overboard to slam, but then this is much better than the one they bid a few hands ago|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: In the closed the opening was 1@H. A true canape-system in use there it seems|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Must be a strong field|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It ain't bad|pg||
nt|marlowepi: correct declarer technique on Boards 1, 4, and 7 in this room would have the MY team up by about 30 instead of struggling|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Also here a couple of IMPÂ´s for Italy - just taking their tricks|pg||
nt|flash: seems unlikely that Lavazza will lose IMPs on this one?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first slam! |pg||
nt|jcwla: They're in 3NT in the OR on a @C lead from N.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Winning contracts are few this morning / evening|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Tez :) |pg||
nt|roswolf: 8 bds left and 22 imps required|pg||
nt|roswolf: zimmermann wins the tie break|pg||
nt|shevek: good point fluffy, low from dubleton lead didn't work here, at the other table @s8 lead gave the count|pg||
nt|vugraphzcj: players go out of the room for rest(maybe). wait pls:)|pg||
nt|shevek: rest??? you're kidding :)|pg||
nt|po-s: gone from 1 imp per board to 3 needed|pg||
nt|roswolf: or a smoke(even if the regs dont allow it)|pg||
nt|shevek: Zmud wouldn't have gone for a smoke if he switched to a @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzcj: 4 players left and it may start now|pg||
nt|po-s: could trumps be 5-0|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: another good slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ken Rae is from the Shetlands|pg||
nt|peachy: a likely 3NT here now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But East has a difficult lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i think that did NOT make overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  cashing @SJ means can't play any other squeeze|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ja, så skall man nog spela upp mot @sJ två gånger|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: that could very well be a Strong Two |pg||
nt|Walddk2: sure it is|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a rare beast|pg||
nt|peachy: 11-18 5+ H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D 4+ [unless 4=4=3=2]|pg||
nt|xenya: not unexpectedly, 6 was a push -- 4@SX down 1|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @D - can they bid it?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i will bet on 3N by E:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wouldnt want to anyway since the minor cards are marked in the W hand already|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=5-11 HCP  5/6@D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the bidding in OR will be copied here?|pg||
nt|ritong: and an other tricky hand|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a black suit game for e/w here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Nunes still in the box after @SK|pg||
nt|bbramley: looked like he was down 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A silent 4 @H - coffe-board|pg||
nt|tejjyid: MArty would have opened 3@D|pg||
nt|peachy: thats better|pg||
nt|po-s: True - as Nicoleta points out Balickis lead against 3NT could have been from a 3card suit. perhaps change leads in partner´s bid suit?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|marlowepi: even a spade lead does not defeat 4H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9:  S  4@SX-3  500 to EW|pg||
nt|peachy: partscore deal here, most likely|pg||
nt|po-s: you´re such a blood thirsty person|pg||
nt|xenya: i think there is a scope for variations|pg||
nt|po-s: overruff in diamonds and a heart would have made I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes quessing the @H-positionm |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2@D has no strong options  I am told|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: chance for North-South to retaliate by reaching a lucky slam of their own - 6@c and 6NT both make if played by North (who has bid clubs)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After 2 @D -- West will have some work to get to 6 in a black suit |pg||
nt|peachy: they better play well, it is not easy to take 9 there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: making if they bid it, i mean, not them getting there|pg||
nt|po-s: no they opened a canape 1S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! failed directly|pg||
nt|po-s: do they lead 3rd?|pg||
nt|roswolf: north again aggressive|pg||
nt|shevek: suit below sg ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like it|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@h anyone?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hawe45:  Normally E/W would make 620 in 4 @H, but here...|pg||
nt|xenya: not normally, PO, no|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @S = what guys?  1 nt|pg||
nt|bgn: no thanks, not today. Just watching NEC :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do EW play 2/1 GF even in comp? or neg free bids?|pg||
nt|shevek: dbl not my choice..|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@c some countertakeout|pg||
nt|shevek: obviously west is thinking|pg||
nt|po-s: 15 pretty poor points - 2H is enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S was one-round force, but wow -- that's quite a 3@S bid|pg||
nt|po-s: I think 1354 1345|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: crucial moment, go or not to go|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm betting no|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not now|pg||
nt|shevek: must be|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: time for Blackwood |pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 NT on the N hand is excellent|pg||
nt|peachy: even if one does raise on three sometimes, doing so with S hand would be sick|pg||
nt|peachy: 2c is 10+,  GF if fit and then 2+ cl|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In 4 @H you get 12 tricks - in 6 6 @H only 10|pg||
nt|flash: these stopperless NT calls are frightening!!!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and N/S making it tough for them to get there|pg||
nt|shevek: 5-4 minors and 3@h thx specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i dont|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Defeating this 4 @H will bring NL in front|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think the real score is 10-17|pg||
nt|hlortz: some sort of science in action here|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 controls I am told|pg||
nt|hawe45:  When 2 @D is majors, I would lead @S King|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No success this time though|pg||
nt|po-s: Was South really contemplating anything but Pass or  was Sylvan really thinking?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You  are welcome - in 3 @S|pg||
nt|shevek: thx PO :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt bbättre än 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Geoff Breskal won the Gold Cup many years ago|pg||
nt|Walddk2: many many years ago|pg||
nt|hlortz: indelicate but effective|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe David Edwin in the audience remembers when|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this event is well-known for collecting "names" in Yokohama, the organizers do their best to attract "stars" giving national players fine possibility to compete  |pg||
nt|hawe45:  But no good lead for South|pg||
nt|peachy: Have to stay away from spade lead to have any chance|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best he could do|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry - 6@c, as a spectator points out, will not make if East leads her diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 3S is fine. you have an AK and you are nonvul. most of the time S has 6 spades. even if 5 no great harm shd come to you|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not the best spot:)|pg||
nt|tez: dbl=good @h's|pg||
nt|tez: zmud and balicky are globally reknowned particularly by their defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: a case for cashing the ace - not done|pg||
nt|bbramley: looks that way, and 2@D looks like an artif GF, or maybe this range balanced|pg||
nt|po-s: perfect bridge|pg||
nt|sybarra: jxx didnt feel like stopper|pg||
pc|s7|nt|peachy: this is more a lucky one than the 6NT was, there he only needed spade finess|pg||
nt|gracelin: I was in Yokohama for the NEC cup last year.  This Latin team did very well but they are missing Diego this time.|pg||
nt|dburn: all academic - they aren't going to bid a slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after 3 Ds need heart shift|pg||
nt|peachy: this at least one down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South could double for the lead|pg||
nt|shevek: I guess was the screen |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well done Fantoni|pg||
nt|po-s: but as usual Sementa overbids|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Bra av Tomas|pg||
nt|peacokk: Valet av öppningsbud var något udda|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Unfortunately our operators do not speak English, so I can't explain how to reconnect after a crash|pg||
nt|peachy: Maybe there is a bilingual specctator to help Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's all in our manual, but that's also in English|pg||
nt|gracelin: they soudn't.  This is amuch worse slam than last board which only needs a finesse.|pg||
nt|peachy: is Diego B in another team or not there this year?|pg||
nt|po-s: and isn´t|pg||
nt|sybarra: nope! |pg||
nt|odysseus69: the lucky 3NT was not a realistic spot|pg||
nt|shevek: will make 11 tricks for a flat board|pg||
nt|roswolf: east not doubling should ensure this is defeated|pg||
nt|shevek: a lot of bidding to a non making part score|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: this might be tricky both for declarer and  defenders|pg||
nt|po-s: that HQ is a good card, otherwise declarer might have  difficulties|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This one should depend om finding the @S Queen|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we think 2 @D= 18+ |pg||
nt|pelu: they play tranfer-ans on 1@C - so 1@S sh be a normal 1NT|pg||
nt|hlortz: hmm little conservative with 25 hcp total|pg||
nt|hlortz: but i guess they are high enough|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a danger that S will take a phantom though|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best spot for N/S then|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy hand to play is it?|pg||
nt|gracelin: tk he is not cming thisyear.|pg||
nt|flash: semi-sensible lead for a push...|pg||
nt|shevek: the operator has to wait for both bids|pg||
nt|shevek: keyboards can be quite noisy :)|pg||
nt|po-s: stiff king might have been though|pg||
nt|shevek: agree with that|pg||
nt|tez: agree?|pg||
nt|ritong: oh yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree |pg||
nt|jcwla: Interesting sequence here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcj: sorry i may have missed the bidding but the final contract is 3NT:)|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you operator|pg||
nt|tejjyid: can you squeeze South if you douck a @D sometime? & set the @H up?|pg||
nt|po-s: worse done unes|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: oops|pg||
pc|h3|nt|loganrun: 2H seems straightforward but 4H has some obstacles in the play|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The board Lavazza has waited for|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: 2H is just begging for EW to bid the vul game and make it by finessing partner for H queen which they would not otherwise do|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps he was thinking of sac in those colors?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not every lead kills this 4 @H - but IÂ´m sure, the @C Ace did|pg||
nt|peachy: seems this is now going set, straining my eyes for way to make, but no|pg||
nt|peachy: Teramoto is a great player but not the miracleman|pg||
nt|bbramley: plenty high - even with a moderately friendly lie i don't think he'll make it|pg||
nt|pelu: in 4@H Nunes played @H to 8 and A in trick 2!|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it wasn't easy i guess |pg||
nt|ritong: poor giorgio|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the premptive bidding by Bochi worked|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: not sure when   late 70's    early 80's I believe|pg||
nt|xenya: imaginative shift that turns out to be good|pg||
nt|xenya: well at least it was safe|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe two if def really alert|pg||
nt|larrymori: east had to bid 3nt to give a chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: low from doubleton,  ... |pg||
nt|ritong: after all their problems, now in a zero % spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: or singleton  (just joking)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @D might be 4-2 with the H, and @S manageable|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think it's about .5%|pg||
nt|ritong: probably a push, though  but no sun ray|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @C swich now awkward|pg||
nt|tez: @h q easy and right|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: vine X si acu tu cu 5-5 zici 4@s si eu o sa ma duc ...|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: sorry|pg||
nt|tez: he has @d entry..bal|pg||
nt|tez: bal means balicki..not balance:)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|shevek: swap the red kings :)|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm gonna ask GIB|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not ifthey lead@C, anywa|pg||
nt|tejjyid: can you programGIB to misdefend a little?|pg||
nt|peachy: our BF GIB says not making, but that is ofcourse dbldummy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: another of quite a few slams missing 2 Aces|pg||
nt|peacokk: Jag själv hade föredragit att öppna med 1@S|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hawe45:  East might think, that South is in position to get a @C-ruff - not North. He must play @H Ace and another @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no -- this could have been dead minimum 2@H  [5+@H, 10+ HCP]|pg||
nt|po-s: not making??|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @c ut ser ut att kunna straffa med @h shift och @c tillbaka|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Hi David|pg||
nt|flash: i'm getting some coaching in the 'modern' game - distribution first; stoppers later...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, minimum, but not dead minimum. the suit is good, and there is a residual fit for E, and the hand has 2 aces|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW probably have H stop in practice if W is dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A @D is OK|pg||
nt|peacokk: Tveksam till att just @S ut ska vara enda betande, hade inte pd haft en straffdubbling av 3NT då?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: still could be achieved i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- i would expect Honor doubleton or better for 3@S|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 3 1/2 defensive tricks??|pg||
nt|sybarra: might have been with E playing, |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: Stay with us, you are on soon anyway|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6N+1 52/58|pg||
nt|gracelin: Seems EW use a similar scheme like CAPP against opponent strong club opening.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The stopperless NT is called practical bidding. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but giving up over 2@C is a mystery -- that appears to be the winning approach|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: one pair made 7N by South|pg||
nt|ady: bet possible for n/s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1977 it was. Thanks to Jeffrey Allerton|pg||
nt|hawe45:  13 tricks, I suppose|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps S has a count now -- from the bidding and N's discards, so he may well return a @D -- no...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what is best now? @c, trumph or @d against the triple void?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D would have been best - but very soon we shall see declarer check, if @S are 3-3|pg||
nt|po-s: he knows partner has five spades and from his discards nothing in hearts|pg||
nt|peachy: I cant even program a VCR....|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: but no denying their in great spot|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|flash: something about old dogs and new water dishes...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually @SK is still interesting -- would Klinger duck to preserve entry to dummy?|pg||
nt|tez: @c is right now|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the@C switch is too good|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|peachy: might as well have used the HK, what else to do with it?|pg||
nt|peachy: toss it under the ace?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He will do next time|pg||
nt|pelu: but still down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they're|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: but it could be our hand and it might be strategically crucial to let him now over 3H that this is an above-average dummy for spades as weak D openers go|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would be possible to use double by the weak 2 bidder for a hand like this, so that 3S can show better spades and/or a somewhat higher offense-to-defense ratio|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Apteker will get this right -- 3@H bid needs shortness somewhere because of limited HCP|pg||
nt|marlowepi: realistically it is not likely that N willl want to use double of 3H for penalty purposes after opening a weak 2|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: why a club shift? and if that is what E asked for, why did he?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think my copy of CC says 1st discard is upside-down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart would seem marked from both sides of table|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: i agree, with everyone bidding so much W is likely to be short in spades|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: after all if he were short elsewhere he might have led that suit at trick 3|pg||
nt|po-s: looks like 2 diamond losers and aheart - rest is crossruffs|pg||
nt|shevek: ok, I'll take it all back|pg||
mc|11|nt|bbramley: i like his line of play: he needed 1 of 2 club finesses through south, plus the spade finesse|pg||
nt|po-s: really? spade to king?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  From the bidding East has been warned|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- also likely 4 hearts, so E has a singleton club|pg||
nt|xenya: and has nothing to pitch|pg||
nt|po-s: he could try a club from dummy in case opps don´t notice he is in his hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and S will discard @cJ on next @h|pg||
nt|ritong: impressive|pg||
nt|tez: it is not a shame to think while defending|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @C is clear I think; Parnehas @D length|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Slam N&S here / only 2 Aces missing|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a boring hand and a push|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: meanwhile, I think E should have tried for game by bidding 2NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's a Precision 1D opening.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will probably go to the 5 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: something seems to have happened to the website - board scores disconnected|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably sitting down however|pg||

nt|marlowepi: no, but it makes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 33 spades let it thru though|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  20-20 points and @c vs @h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N by N a favorite to make:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are EW playing Precision?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can handle 5-1 spade break - north needed a 4th club or the diamond king -|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but it doesn;t seem to affect his game|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i predict 5@S 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nord> 4 NT_ |pg||
nt|po-s: 1 OR 2?|pg||
nt|shevek: no big hands, they never come when you need them|pg||

nt|peachy: identical auction so far as in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this DBL gets more votes :)     |pg||
nt|ritong: oy oy oy|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: very likely that 3N makes but 4H does not (or that both do)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure notes talk about Matt's DBL - but i won't be able to find it in time :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm|pg||
nt|tez: weak notrump opening..very hard for openents|pg||
nt|po-s: for future excitement let us hope  5H making or 6S doubled|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: X by E should show extras, convertible vcalyues|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This slam is better |pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think Klinger would duck the @SK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H-P-3@S???|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bjeagle.se/bridge/dmlag/0910/running_scores.html  for running scores |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I dunno about that, E had only one club stopper|pg||
nt|bbramley: polish club, usually a weak nt, but sometimes...  18+ HCP|pg||
nt|hlortz: singleton kings here one on one off|pg||
nt|sybarra: with his rabbi,  N  or S can make game in either red suit |pg||
nt|peachy: nice safe contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs a heart lead to beat 3nt if e/w gets ther|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  could be too high (if NS find @h ruff) |pg||
nt|kakasi: Iy[ [ÌûÖBBO©çÌ¨mç¹Å·G@@]Tª êÎAêxEBhEðÂ¶ÄAà¤êxJ«A»ÌÌ¿âÉYESÆ¦Ä­¾³¢ÆÌ±ÆÅ·B|pg||

nt|tez: i dont agree with pass S hand|pg||
nt|ritong: he s inhibited|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Jag undrar vad 2NT betyder|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: nice fillers and suit in dummy|pg||
nt|flash: only 21 HCP - and the opps are bidding...   |pg||
nt|peachy: but not any more|pg||
nt|hawe45:  For a 21Â´er, North has a weak hand|pg||
nt|flash: now, i have a preference...   5-card suits are shown?  4-card suits aren't???|pg||
nt|peachy: not when the opp bid it?|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I misunderstood|pg||
nt|flash: now you're teasing?   3@C puts things up a level, but we're not escaping this any more cheaply??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will South rebid 3@S over 3@C or ....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S helps with shape, but without an honor  yuk|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 4D autosplinter (if ti is)|pg||
nt|peachy: I think S will show his shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe 4@D is minorwood  [RKCB in @C]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still - the key is that south needs to hear about @H filler to really get excited|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer could save a trick by playing another @H, pitching another club -- not clear why he changed the plan|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4H looks more awkward|pg||
nt|po-s: VERY good decision|pg||
nt|po-s: but???|pg||
nt|po-s: that+s what I´m afraid of|pg||
nt|po-s: all he needs is Axxx and an ace (clubs)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not enogh po... with so much bidding suits will break badly|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Oh, that 5-level again|pg||
nt|pelu: coprrection : Nunes maded 41Hs - correction by operator (misclicks)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yep thought if he played @H to the 7 he'd make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: will e/w get in?|pg||
nt|sybarra: spec points out 4 @S makes |pg||
nt|bbramley: 1@D=artif weak, 1@H=nat but could still be a weak nt (F1?), 2@D nat NF|pg||
nt|bbramley: 3@S makes, lose 1 of each|pg||
nt|sybarra: no doesnt make,  think it loses a trick in each suit,,  |pg||
nt|flash: might North have called 2@H over 1@S, instead of Xing again?   (thnx, Deb)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  When I was young(er), this pass was for playing 2 @D RD|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm having a conversation with two specs, forgive my inattention please|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Otherwise they can make bluff-RD|pg||
nt|flash: only 2?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: even harder if you pass it on the South hand|pg||
nt|tez: you?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hade nog inte hittat 2nt på Johans hand|pg||
nt|peacokk: Standard budgivning till ett bra kontrakt|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: Again, West has the wrong singleton for it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I agree...!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks, kakasi explaining what to do for the operator in Japanese|pg||
nt|kakasi: I[v[ÌÊð\¦·é½ßÅ·B|pg||
nt|hlortz: now 4@H from n?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it seems unlikely that spades will play better than clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, I would, but I am not them :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant say I like Wests double of 1C|pg||
nt|shevek: it's ok if they play ELC|pg||
nt|shevek: that is Equal Level Conversion|pg||
nt|ritong: no, not moi:)|pg||
nt|ritong: heh|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S is the std contract - but a spec was mussing on how a swing might be generated|pg||
nt|vugraphzeu: 2NT=14-16, 6@h, spridda honnörer|pg||
pc|h9|nt|peachy: I am strongly against bidding 3S with E hand, it just means that 3rd seat will become too cautious knowing that partner will jack up the bidding to the three level with a balanced ...|pg||
nt|peachy: 9 count and support|pg||
nt|po-s: will East be satisfied with 3NT|pg||
nt|po-s: 4C|pg||
nt|sybarra: right bart, I shouid double check  what spec say :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: balicki finally reveals his true nature|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hate to splinter with singleton Ace|pg||
nt|po-s: in 5S with a heart lead - but if N doubles they probably stop|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|po-s: or 6? no..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @C looks fine|pg||
nt|po-s: he won´t get much cooperation I think - well maybe 4D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easte must have been very close to a D|pg||
nt|flash: certainly i expected partner to make this call - if i didn't bid 3@C earlier, i pass and try not to look too ready for the axe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the hard bid to explain is not Matt's double but rather 5H|pg||
nt|chick: wonder why he ran from 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bingo!|pg||
nt|peachy: now P|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont hold up your bingo card yet, they have not IDed a spade control yet|pg||
nt|xenya: i never do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: saved by the bell!!!|pg||
nt|shevek: they are keen...|pg||
nt|po-s: and now he might not lead a heart|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: there ought to be a law about that|pg||
nt|peachy: the 9 including a dubious Qx on the side|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, after the lead and the favorable DA position.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Apteker may have given the show away with his DBL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be tickled pink to play 5DX after W volunteered the suit over my X|pg||
nt|chick: but he can't let it go undoubled|pg||
nt|peachy: nowadays, just about everything is a transfer|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I belive S shows a non-minimum 5422|pg||
nt|jcwla: Big opportunity here.|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm getting high|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: of course -- failure to hear a 4@D call probably means some @S values -- but who knows|pg||
nt|loganrun: This is your coffee board Hans|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reliable source says they were playing Precision yesterday -- so probably today too :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  decent logic!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have CC for their teammates who usually play Precision, but decided NOT to do that this tournament|pg||
nt|marlowepi: except that the 4H call doesnt make much sense if EW are playing Precision|pg||
nt|po-s: for me this sequence shows extras|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would be happy to pass 1 NT as Northe|pg||
nt|shevek: oops, 3NT was not part of the equation|pg||
nt|ritong: well, this is common to every bridge players, even the greatest like duboin is|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jtr: 3@d jump fit might have helped|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree PO, but is @cQ extra?|pg||
nt|othered1: Do y ou have a bid for south over 1N?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: You think he has food poisoning?|pg||
nt|sybarra: can I show majors? |pg||
nt|tez: 1 nt was 15 18..specs say|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|hlortz: defense wants to make sure declarer has an entry for the @D finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: a little relief here for Zimmermann, match is not yet out of hand by any means|pg||
nt|flash: a sexy 3 IMPs?|pg||
nt|othered1: can anyone translate this auction?|pg||
nt|po-s: the drawback being that we might miss a 44fit in spades (since I would support to 2H directly|pg||
nt|ritong: game is awful, you have a borderline decision to make and coin flips on the wrong side|pg||
nt|po-s: my wish came true |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: another big swing for Lavazza ?|pg||
nt|po-s: now....|pg||
nt|peacokk: Fiffigt|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: South pushed well      might have considered doubling with 2 aces |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fit bids are quite good because they help your partner to judge later|pg||
nt|po-s: very difficult to get to 6C|pg||
nt|po-s: unless he uses it toplay trumps...|pg||
nt|po-s: then a small which is wrong if KJ bare|pg||
nt|peachy: dia shift there could have held but partner's suit is normal |pg||
nt|peachy: I think 4H was an offer to play, |pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile Duboin's silence against 1@S-2@S has paid off with 6 more on 25 as Bulgaria's E/W got to 2NT/W-2.  Lavazza to within 11.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and this is why 3@S probably wrong|pg||
nt|po-s: yes Marshall - just a bit trickier|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont show this auction to your novices class:)|pg||
nt|shevek: 12 imps penalty|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: bidding 2N does not rule out getting to 3H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 @S D is "only" 1400, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jan Martel says they were hyperaggressive yesterday too|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's those @S pips I suppose, otherwise it looks pretty minimum to me|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: 4H|pg||
nt|xenya: no matter what W does now, declarer will only lose 2 more trumps |pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is why i like 4D better than 3S--the slam interest is underscored, as opposed to 3S|pg||
nt|sybarra: where are we going? |pg||
nt|peachy: if a kibitzer knows their system, feel free to chirp in here|pg||
nt|roswolf: heart lead looks very possible|pg||
nt|po-s: couldn´t East have the DK?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think so|pg||
nt|roswolf: with me definitely|pg||
nt|po-s: we hope so - trump leads are overrated|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S was not a strong effort, i think, N should put S in the picture with some sort of fit-showing club bid|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes then 4@H clearly control bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after 4D-4H, now S can bid 4N=  "i am still interested, but i dont have a spade control"|pg||
nt|peachy: In this auction, I dont think 4H was control, he has to show it at some point|pg||
nt|peachy: but again, I dont have their notes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and another keypoint for partnerships   would 3@C-4@C be forcing?  [key is to be on same page]|pg||
nt|po-s: where is Barry? a lot of relays|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true p-o, thought needed about timing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he is lurking in the wings|pg||
nt|tez: same for me|pg||
nt|roswolf: wd|pg||
nt|po-s: yep!|pg||
nt|shevek: 4@c was a splinter in east's best suit, serves him right|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: she can pitch a @H forcexample|pg||
nt|jcwla: There is grace in ending in 4NT here.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sfoxa:  now it's 5 more imps for NANIWADA|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets see,  auction in normal life ...we can figure out..landing in same spot  with 3 or 4 bids?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but pass after 1nt is rather close when S has something i @c|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes depends on whether west ruffs the 4th @D qith @sq OR NOT ?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hlortz: 200 52/58 so far|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|chick: it was a 16IMP swing on the 6@D fiasco|pg||
nt|po-s: trump ace I guess|pg||
nt|pelu: even then he has an re-entry on @H10 - to take the @D-finess :(|pg||
nt|peachy: wow, OR stayd in partscore|pg||
nt|peachy: a ping-pong match|pg||
nt|jcwla: Already 10 coming to Bulgaria, slam would have been an extra 5.|pg||
nt|tez: i play dbl as minor + 4 major|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, a helpful kib said: their sys is to bid every suit 3 times and then guess the correct contract. I'm not telling who it was:)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|xenya: this could be tricky?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low club was best chance|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bbramley: keeping control against spade tap|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - one more cup|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6@D isn't unreasonable - it has an alibi at least|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|sybarra: to specs: sorry rooms not connected,  we are trying our best to keep running score |pg||
nt|pelu: ny calculation are 42-6 for Zimmermann - but.......(:(:|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 14 boards to go|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any views on 2@S there/|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, this event seems to revolve around how well you kill the less experienced pairs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon it's a bit quacky |pg||
nt|hlortz: i dislike the ambiguity of 2@S limit *or better*|pg||

nt|jtr: That too|pg||
nt|chick: the other table bid 6@D but made it|pg||
nt|bbramley: balicki will wonder why wrang didn't lead his (necessarily) singleton diamond - might drop it for that reason|pg||
nt|othered1: so you plan to give up on one of your majors?|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Now what happened last time I didn't cash my ace?"|pg||
nt|tejjyid: draw trumps, ruffing finesse, go down, tell partners it was 50%|pg||
pc|dT|nt|flash: i've had a suggestion that X of 2@H might not have been penalties...   the 'modern' game strikes again?  all Xs below 2NT are t/o???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you could try to dummy revrse, set up @C and find a 12th trick in the end game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lack of an aggressive lead against 6 may suggest to N that E has heart ace and long spades to the king|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that is too hard for me though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry private|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, I give up. checking our BF again|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but a fine dedcution, worthy of yr namesake|pg||
nt|peachy: GIB claims makeable|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sure, easy, jsut take @S finesse|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but theruffing finesse looks a LOT simpler|pg||
nt|marlowepi: win in dummy and start on clubs, later take spade finesse for heart dscard.  if inferences are drawn from trump lead|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, that's plausible on the lead|pg||
nt|peachy: at the other table, S was declarer, with a heart to K and ace, trump back|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|peachy: then it was lucky they DID bid it, the loss would have been significant|pg||
nt|hlortz: better a natural entry to dummy , it looks suspicious if you LET declarer get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: Al Holland in other room had same |pg||
pc|d6|nt|poohbear: arry who?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tejjyid: experts lead trumps against slams rarely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in all likelihood you are going to have to ruff one club anyway|pg||
pc|sK|nt|po-s: why the SQ?|pg||
nt|flash: the Open Room auction certainly looks ripe for a penalty X|pg||
nt|flash: (move your cursor over the Open Room result on this screen to see the auction_|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Balicki play it for all its worth|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|hlortz: passing 4@C in OR was quite a position....|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looking over these boards, it must be acknowledged that there were a few interesting decisions to be made. but most of these IMPs have slithered one way or the other due to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: essentially unforced errors|pg||
nt|tez: yes give up the one pd does not choose:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|po-s: shouldn´t he have played another club to indicate he doesn´t know anything abt diamonds|pg||
nt|peachy: I have to agree|pg||
nt|po-s: it seems as if you really could squeeze everything out of East with relays you would bid 3NT|pg||
pc|s8|nt|peachy: too bad about the error in decl play, pressure pressure of big event|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peacokk: Bra spelat|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bbramley: i say he drops it|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet we see a @D finesse next |pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: so far E is following the line suggested by Barry Rigal from the sidelines|pg||

mb|2C|nt|jbgood: why is that, Henry?|pg||
nt|peachy: S is strong enough to open naturally, with longest suit, follow up with diamonds twice|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  hello, Jeff|pg||
nt|fann4: Hi Marshall|pg||
nt|tejjyid: can't find their system card so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzeu: 2@d = relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Great bid:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  is N a chicken?|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, I would just bid 3D, 3S sounds too weak|pg||
nt|peachy: but perhaps 3S is their sys|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best game on EW 3nt on W|pg||
nt|xenya: S's hand is a near Yarborough -- the @D10 spoils the picture |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=ART GF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Art Garfunkel?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=5+@H & 5+@C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I think East and West have minimum, both oif them|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 @S - OUF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N hand close to a 2S bid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: THIS HAS MADE THE MATCH COME ALIVE NOW|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sry for caps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: plus the club duplication|pg||
nt|jtr: Forrester makes no other|pg||
nt|po-s: will East comply - Lebensohl probably|pg||
nt|fann4: And Sveta|pg||
nt|fann4: Very aggressive 2@D overcall here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has just had great success pushing EW around, and undoubtedly wants to go to the well again right away|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agressive and may mislead partner to 5@d sacrifice|pg||
nt|shevek: multi 2@d worked well here|pg||
nt|peacokk: 2@D var inte krav och 3@s spärr|pg||
nt|peacokk: Varför bara göra det möjligt att konkurera i en färg istället för tre?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hlortz: well when the opps bounce to 4@S opener has too big a problem i prefer something like 2n as the strong gf raise|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @S is a good bid - for E/W, now East waill avoi the @D-lead|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N by E|pg||
nt|po-s: 3NT I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=6-13 HCP, 4+@S|pg||
nt|po-s: to put necomers in the picture - SARA needs ten more vPs than SouthSweden to qualify|pg||
nt|shevek: in the KO phase, the team with the higher position from the Swiss gets a ½IMP carryover|pg||
nt|tez: actually neither is correct for the given hand|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not fure ASTRO would work, unless  you're referring to their recommendation you bid your short suit at the 3-level on a 3-suiter|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  if you expect partner to re-open with E hand - 3 @s seems ok|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is E planning to pass?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @SA och klövervända i andra rummet. Då var det lätt för spelföraren|pg||
pc|h8|nt|peachy: N should have raised diamonds, with partner reversing, it is unlikely that would drive opps to a making 4S|pg||
nt|gracelin: they also play CAPP over 1NT opening, so 2D shows both maors.|pg||
nt|flash: practical call?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not Garfunkel   this GF gets more respect|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=@D   go figure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has now bid only only the suit in which he has about 6% of his HCP :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and in the OR they are in 6 nt by W|pg||
nt|sybarra: with a sp lead |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the unbid portion of his hand his per capita HCP average is 2.5 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Klinger had option to bid 4@H to show solid/1-loser suit|pg||
nt|shevek: try to be impartial PO :) (commentator's ethics, etc...)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: EW cannot miss game now|pg||
nt|po-s: now game?|pg||
nt|peachy: unusual decision|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|pelu: I almost didnt belive that he took the @D-finess -|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To me, South has NO 3 @C-bid|pg||
nt|shevek: I didn't cheer when ish played in 7@h missing 1 ace (and made it)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially with a sizeable lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4 går inte hm även med denna favör|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: no double from South, slightly surprising|pg||
nt|jbgood: point taken|pg||
nt|po-s: doubledummy on a spade lead ducked and another spade...|pg||
nt|po-s: give up a club and a diamond, then throw South in at the end for a heart favor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has to bid 3S here i think, and then W will bid 4D|pg||
nt|peachy: this game, if they stretch, could also make if def finds a wrong lead|pg||
nt|peachy: so match not over yet|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 2@S is Puppet to 2N   making 3@C INV   [where immediate 3@C would be game force]|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another monster result for Bulgaria here.|pg||
nt|po-s: is 12 a max?|pg||
nt|fann4: There is not much to the play here, so worth having a look at the play of the @H suit on the previous hand.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45:  Strange decision - West has the hand for bidding 4 @S|pg||
nt|peachy: I suppose the operator will catch up with comparisons when has a chance|pg||
nt|kakasi: åÏÅµå¤©çAÌpÌ©çÅà¢¢Æv¢Ü·B|pg||
nt|peachy: unfortunately Nied did not understand that Lin was already bidding W hand|pg||
nt|po-s: shouldn´t be worse than a finesse|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  Good lead|pg||
nt|shevek: that was the problem, the lead :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: from the WOrld Championships, X was 4+ 4+ majors|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 5 @C wont be easy|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - thatÂ´s better|pg||
nt|po-s: but he might simply go for hearts in a simpler fashin|pg||
nt|po-s: fashion|pg||
nt|po-s: DJ isn´t very good either, is it|pg||
nt|xenya: it is not|pg||
nt|bbramley: 3@H looks down 1, -50 a good save vs. 3@D making 110 or 130|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E decided there was no way to show, so he i susing KC hoping to hide his hand as declarer:)|pg||
nt|po-s: no|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: EW are adopting the NS strategy of self-destruction :(|pg||
nt|peachy: bit score relief for Naniwada now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and 6 more imps for NANIWADA |pg||
nt|fann4: @HQ109 opposite A85432   what is the best play (in isolation) for 5 tricks.|pg||
nt|shevek: the right hand is dummy|pg||
pc|d5|nt|peachy: so, Lavazza team MUST stretch to have a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duboin has perfect picture to find 4@H jumpm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Bocchi is the best at stretching:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  11 or 12 tricks = same result - 6 IMPÂ´s|pg||
nt|po-s: I think he shows acceptance for hearts|pg||
nt|po-s: and decent diamonds|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 or 7 here on @C guess and this match is tightening up.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: oh, thats why he is so tall?|pg||
nt|po-s: have I supported anyone? ANYONE?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South will easily make 7 tricks...|pg||
nt|xenya: and perhaps concern about clubs|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|po-s: so it leaves a club or a heart|pg||
nt|xenya: complex hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: they are in 3 @H in the other room |pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s it - you sit up here in the cold North, trying to find out, how to bid 4 @S - and North just did it|pg||
nt|loganrun: 3-2 spades plus 3-3 hearts or QJ doubleton|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there was a case for a low D lead after the NT bid|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: @H10    really??|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Bocchi will need a ladder to get into dummy|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hawe45:  Very bad lead this time|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure about result on 10, but before it was 22-17|pg||
nt|peachy: as well as her own|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odds heavily in favor of W shortness being in Ds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now 2 top hearts and Ds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Absolutely NOT, po!|pg||
nt|xenya: nice auction|pg||
nt|po-s: and that is not only by looking at his hand....|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Now Herman just needs to find Forrester's entry to get a heart ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Keep looking|pg||
nt|mdgraham: little does he know it's in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because he must have one after 3@H without A and Q, right?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But North had no good lead|pg||
nt|peachy: nice for everyone (well, except maybe Zimmerman team) to have a tight race to watch|pg||
nt|shevek: we're all impartial here, but hey, people like stories of success when all seemed lost :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although he might suspect it |pg||
nt|po-s: this way is no good though|pg||
nt|sybarra: down 3!! |pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: maybe the @CA and another would have been better?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - East just wanted to se the @H-signals from N/S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Unblock...|pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps nothing is lost yet|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he has 1 step now :)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|xenya: this is a good example of aggressive bidding -- EW got just a bit too high, but that induced NS to go overboard too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i am tired -- was thinking West declaring @S  :(|pg||
nt|tez: easy to make 3|pg||
nt|po-s: let us see - cross ruffs?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Voila they say in France|pg||
nt|sybarra: on a low club lead fro N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: responses to RKC are 1430 ONLY when trump=@H|pg||
nt|peacokk: Winqvist försöker ta sina stick på korsstöld|pg||
pc|d9|nt|po-s: but now North can break communications should declarer duck the diamond|pg||
nt|tez: now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|peachy: Bas really didn't want a ruff, I think he was trying for a lead not to give a trick or something|pg||
nt|peacokk: "Enda chansen" nu verkar vara att spela på att Nord har Qxx i @C|pg||
nt|peacokk: Då han kan saka en @D på den fjärde @C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Kan gå hem om N har minst 3@c med @cQ|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: 11 tricks made in the other room|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: or play to set uop @Hs|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ady: this likely to be around average     double for north might have gain quite a bit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Norht can happily keep the @HK8 over dummy's @HQ7|pg||
nt|hlortz: -2 looks normal|pg||
pc|c2|nt|flash: again, http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html  for standings...   pls check out the Daily Bulletins|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: preserving more options this way perhaps|pg||
nt|po-s: no, as a commentator you must do the opposite|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low D would have double benefit....get 2 D tricks, and conceal S hand better|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: 5@S showed @HQ  said nothing about @S|pg||
nt|shevek: that's what he's doing I thk|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|chick: I would think a higher club from W would make it clearer for partner to return @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Endplay for overtrick instead|pg||
nt|sybarra2: but playing the sox off this hand!|pg||
nt|roswolf: the layout is very friendly for the x-ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Måste väl ha exakt Qxx tror jag|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|peachy: Bob Drijver, sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4 pickups in a row will put Oz in the lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: seems it's a good thing (for EW) that W's hand is closed|pg||
nt|shevek: the bill for that 670 arrived (sorry PO)|pg||

nt|po-s: yep, they went one down |pg||
pc|h9|pg||

nt|marlowepi: of course, N would have to put up D queen:)|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: but if that 3rd D was ruffed, a spade could come back and heart queen could be promoted via another D|pg||

nt|peachy: what was that?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S could have discarded losing spade on heart Q|pg||
nt|peachy: exactly|pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt "we" want to pitch one spade?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door, S got helful @c A lead |pg||
nt|gracelin: So Lin's balamce turned a plus score into a minus one.|pg||
nt|peachy: the match 9 scores are now up http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest10/nec.html|pg||
nt|ahollan1: chalk that up to the EW system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the wide range 2N put South under a lot of pressure|pg||
nt|po-s: nice  auction because the HK is onside|pg||
nt|tejjyid: bring it on, Lavzza in full flight is awesome|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sofarthey have a slam off 2 Aces, anotehr slam on card reading + double squeeze|pg||
nt|shevek: 5 bds to go, 1 imp difference, what a final|pg||
nt|roswolf: now for the finale|pg||
nt|po-s: so now 1,5 imp needed|pg||
nt|roswolf: great stuff|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 boards, 2 imps... anyone's match now|pg||
nt|roswolf: momentum with lavazza|pg||
nt|peacokk: http://www.bjeagle.se/bridge/dmlag/0910/running_scores.html|pg||
mb|1D|nt|xenya: maybe|pg||
nt|po-s: correct - he could have from the beginning though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is Lavazza still leading??|pg||
nt|shevek: how's 6@d?|pg||
nt|po-s: how many VPs is 21 imps?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S plenty high already|pg||
nt|vugraphzeu: Johan Wedeen vill vinka till internetpubliken.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Wrang sitting East gets full charge for 6N-1  [after partner asked key cards then bid 6@H - he pulled to 6N]|pg||
nt|hawe45:  More coffee|pg||
nt|po-s: hard to find diamond slam after 1NT|pg||
nt|shevek: well, 5 boards|pg||
nt|peacokk: För running scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: "we" did...|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW will probably end up in 3NT here.|pg||
nt|peachy: No, Nie's jump did it, IMO.  |pg||
nt|xenya: another game missed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: reverse black suits in W hand & very likely Ron would open at 4 level at these colors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S alerted because system on over DBL -- so MAX = 12 HCP|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, by 8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D best here i think|pg||
nt|loganrun: Not bad PO better played by South|pg||
nt|shevek: 23-26|pg||
nt|shevek: sry 20-10VPs|pg||
nt|po-s: the other table: Klinger opened the east hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: X from South?|pg||
nt|peachy: same auction in other room, so far|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm a doubler, but people say I bid too much|pg||
nt|roswolf: remember zimmerann wins if scores tied|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|peachy: Open room was allowed to play in 4C, good for them|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Anyway the match seems to give a big score for the ladies|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting "save" in the OR |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: playing 2/1 is the south hand worth a 2/1 ?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: I think I know some folks who would open 4 @S on W hand|pg||
nt|flash: obviously, the defense has the first 4 tricks available here|pg||
nt|po-s: so EW had no problem finding 4S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lay-down slam even with ! 4-0|pg||
nt|tez: normal for me|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sry 5... why do i keep thinking 62 boards?|pg||
nt|peacokk: Söring-Andersson hittade 3NT på bricka 9 för en lika bricka|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  E/W 130 in OR is a good result for NL|pg||
nt|po-s: funny hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree, Lin might double the weak NT opening with a stronger hand.|pg||
nt|flash: Multi - weak 2 in a major; 2@H pass or correct|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Big result for Italy in OR|pg||
nt|flash: knowing quite well that a 2@S call won't be forthcoming|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, a few good hands in a row for them|pg||
nt|xenya: potentially|pg||
nt|po-s: ah, you think that´s why he opened 1NT to make South declarer in diamonds (with a transfer bid)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H|pg||
nt|ritong: will not cost a lot|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely a push |pg||
nt|tez: i belive same score here|pg||
nt|roswolf: they have0.5 imp as a carryover|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: n/s can make 9 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|peachy: right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I vote for South Sweden - itÂ´s only 50 kilometers from here...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 9 trix each way|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: anybody see a result other than down 3?|pg||
nt|chick: not unless E drops a card on the table accidently|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, making. but that would be 5D :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: only a @C lead will give 6@H a problem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doesnt look good for playing in Ds|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry - the West hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That's what you get for overcalling 2@S vul against not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is dead as a rat|pg||
nt|ady: should be over the top   minor suit queens badly placed|pg||
nt|hlortz: 2@S was a sort of prebalance but south didnt know that|pg||
nt|jtr: He had a  tough decision|pg||
nt|peachy: I think best now to bang down the spades|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lead the @D Ace - and lose 620|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S making on same auction in the other room |pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe down 4 if Klinger ducks 1st @D|pg||
nt|fann4: A flattish board again.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as opposed to a warped board?:)|pg||
nt|fann4: :)|pg||
nt|tez: hmm|pg||
nt|tejjyid: now, some more cardplay|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Då får ni ordna en webcam|pg||
mb|p|nt|kakasi: 10Ô [hÌÊð³¦Ä­¾³¢ÆÌÅ·B|pg||
nt|flash: for those with a strong stomach, click on Movie; highlight this board; click on Open Room and use the Next button to see how the defense went astray in the other room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the auction i mean|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange choice|pg||
nt|po-s: no Hans not to South (Africa)|pg||
nt|loganrun: good plan - although not fashionable I would open 1D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wonder on what page of his classix text on Losing Trick Count he recommends opening that hand? :):)|pg||
nt|po-s: East showed hearts - I´m surprised West didn´t bid 3H|pg||
nt|xenya: well W could have AK of hearts -- if not, 5@D is on a finesse -- good odds|pg||
nt|shevek: same auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: that's what you get for predicting|pg||
nt|shevek: what a good way to avoid ties|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Black humor|pg||
nt|po-s: odds come down a bit when North had intervened|pg||
nt|shevek: same lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: which rat's that, Roland? |pg||
nt|gracelin: they might wrongsided the 3NT cntract, but luckily, DJ is in north hand.|pg||
nt|peachy: must find H in either slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Puppet Stayman auction   3@D=at least 1 4-card major   3@S=4@H, not 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can do it a lot later in 6D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once W shows 4 diamonds, winning heart play stands out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 8.5 losers, with over 1/3 of his points a KJ doubleton|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no ideas about 6@h in OR|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT is sort of forced but no problem once you get there|pg||
nt|peachy: this is makeable, but lots of work. Of course "makeable" seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of work|pg||
nt|po-s: I think 3NT denies splinter - good raise to 4H|pg||
nt|peacokk: 3NT hade krävt lågfärgsutspel av Hörnfeldt|pg||
pc|c4|nt|po-s: tricky to defend|pg||
nt|xenya: @H switch beats it as we all can see -- but N can't|pg||
nt|tez: vulnarable is important..we knew|pg||
nt|ritong: the @c is known to be a singleton|pg||
nt|tez: vulnerability|pg||
nt|po-s: oops|pg||
nt|shevek: they bid it fast!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and Lavazza go into the lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes winning the qualifying has its advantages|pg||
nt|roswolf: well declarer isnt off yet|pg||
nt|po-s: no lead seems to let this through|pg||
pc|c8|nt|peachy: no spade lead and we are talking numbers...|pg||
nt|peachy: but thsat is of course seeing all four hands|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H-lead is the TOP|pg||
nt|peachy: I think diamond could possible be even better|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S Jack would have worked well...!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mullamphy upgrade to 15-17 NT borderline    K&R says hand worth 14.70  http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=5-card Stayman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=not 5@H/@S and MINIMUM|pg||
nt|loganrun: Now 3NT could go off on a spade lead but not on this hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  660 here and 650 at the other table, I presume|pg||
nt|shevek: @h finesse then @d finesse?|pg||
nt|ritong: since balicki has the @s A, the non @s lead is explainable only with a shortness|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: can South be endplayed ?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One of my cats brought back a dead rat last night. Thanks very much|pg||
nt|xenya: yes he can|pg||
nt|peachy: no lead attractive from N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could go down smaller if ace of clubs club now:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but the wonders of this part of the imp scale   300/400  still 14 IMPs -- thanks Nick|pg||
nt|peacokk: 4@S kommer gå en snabb bet|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jtr: How was breakfast?:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to our operator, and not least kaksi. We have an accurate score on the board now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well done guys!|pg||
nt|peachy: Bravo, kaksi, Roland and operator!|pg||
nt|peachy: kakasi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: kakasi whose real name is Satoshi Imai|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best defence is @C Ace and a @H - double-dummy|pg||
nt|peachy: Groenenboom can play whichever club, he doesnt know yet it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If West has the @H Queen, he will get it anyway|pg||
nt|po-s: good sacrifice in 5C|pg||
nt|hlortz: well the 10@H dropping is a clue also..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C is 4-card Stayman|pg||
nt|po-s: The diamonds are so good, and the aces are not NTfriendly|pg||
nt|rodal f: For specs BBO-TV: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|po-s: but this one he passed as West|pg||
nt|othered1: Potential for a 2-way swing here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this one is a better hand, but still a comfy pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Det är inte så löjligt som det låter. Det gör de i Norge under sommerfestivalen|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hawe45:  Will @D 10 followed by the 9 wake up South?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: are EW playing 4-card majors?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade lead seems odd if 5-card majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Precision -- 5-baggers|pg||
nt|po-s: they just transferred and bid game over 1NT|pg||
nt|tez: i m getting help from someone|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: in french we call this @c move a "lob", dunno the english expression|pg||
nt|tejjyid: which @C move?|pg||
nt|ritong: playing through the known single|pg||
nt|tejjyid: has no name that I know, unless you count avoidance|pg||
nt|tez: what do you bid with S hand?|pg||
nt|ritong: i don t, since avoidance consists in avoiding to give the lead to a specific opponent|pg||
nt|sybarra: isnt 1 @S ok?|pg||
nt|tez: y|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@S the 1st time|pg||
nt|roswolf: even dd this is off|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not if North uses the @H10|pg||
nt|roswolf: but while there is hope there is life|pg||
nt|po-s: if Gib says it makes with hear lead I guess we shouldn´t be too sure we can beat it|pg||
nt|shevek: certainly declarer has hopes...|pg||
nt|shevek: he doesn't know he has 2 trump losers|pg||
nt|roswolf: even if declarer suspects the distribution i cannot see where 10 tricks come from|pg||
nt|po-s: I guess you can win the heart, cash another a spade to ace, club finesse and spades??|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  And @H 10|pg||
nt|peachy: probably will lead diamond, leastr self-destructive without seeing all hands|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has stronger spot cards in club but he might go after spade since he has no entry for the long club suit.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing now    4@S=RKCB  5@C=3 keycards, 5@D asks @HQ  5@S=yes and @SK|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|peachy: likely not making|pg||
nt|peachy: well, as long as they dont go for 7, all good for bulgaria|pg||
nt|hlortz: will E find a @C lead? i bet no|pg||
nt|shevek: he hopes the @h finesse is on|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: chance to make six now|pg||
nt|peachy: and either works, even without entry to clubs, friendly hand for ew|pg||
nt|peachy: well, I goofed, clubs dont work LOL|pg||
nt|po-s: yes East has made a slam try|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hlortz: up k@D ruff a @H 2 trumps exit a @D think he could make dbl dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Also OK|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes, with 1-1 @Cs and double @H finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I found Convention Card Stefanov used in Beijing with Aronov -- will see how much applies [if my network stabilizes]|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reverse count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N said   a) no 4 card major  b) not 4333   [so 4@C & 4@D or 5@C/@D]|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Should be flat - 620|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sfoxa:  anyway, 5-6 imps back to Kitty's |pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- that's greedy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is Ron's favorite application of Losing Trick Count:)|pg||
nt|chick: gutsy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we can probably generate a couple hands where that was declarer's 9th trick|pg||
nt|shevek: baaaad news|pg||
nt|peacokk: Dock måste han vända med @DK nu, annars blir han skvisad|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: is the discarding odd/even?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if they have way to find @DQ they were going to find the grand|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 2 @S is right given the 1 @C (big hand on my left) |pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk4: I think this will fall apart for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 500 not unlikely|pg||
nt|tez: over 4@h|pg||
nt|peachy: I havent placed my bet about this hand|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: a spec replies "not really with the misfit, one of the reasons 2/1 is difficult to play (without the "Old Black Magic" it was meant to obviate)."|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jbgood: and a club to the king|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: what if N now cashed 5 clubs or so  |pg||
nt|chick: there are a lot of hands that N could hold where he could now cash 7 more tircks|pg||
nt|chick: tricks*|pg||
pc|s6|nt|po-s: well done|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D 9 was enough...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  Well done|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and i agree|pg||
nt|po-s: we have established that|pg||
nt|shevek: new leader|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would seem normal for N to hope S had something like JT f hearts and a card, and attack hearts from the getgo|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hawe45:  But I doÂ´nt like this @H Ace still in dummy|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6@D over 5@S?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's going well so far though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the 4-1 trumps is a problem|pg||
nt|tejjyid: E will be prety much double dummy from here, so no errors expected|pg||
nt|peachy: and the fact that E still has H to get out of her hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: Verhees did very well to land 4@C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South must face thew facts partner MUST have values in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- Mullamphy's odd @S7 was encouraging|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doesnt matter|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry priv|pg||
nt|tejjyid: pass, I bid my hand already|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: indeed -- does 2@S NS make?|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ruff heart, club queen throwing D|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and he did|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Still in time!|pg||
nt|peachy: it doesnt matter if he does or doesnt, entry to diam must be killed|pg||
nt|po-s: - it would be nastier to play back a club before taking the ruff...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you can ruff that|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hlortz: easy from up here|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gracelin: all went well, as we already know.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The 130 for Verhees will not be mentioned after the match|pg||
nt|peachy: so looks like Lavazza prevails in this match and keeps their  1 position in the running scores|pg||
nt|flash: Zimmermann won the Transnational Teams in Sao Paulo and has retained the same team for the Rosenblum in Philadelphia|pg||
nt|tejjyid: there sin't much upside - they won'tbe tempted by 5@H|pg||
nt|peachy: TAKE IT|pg||
nt|peacokk: Andersson spelade nog bort det när han inte sakade @HK|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jtr: wow|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: i wonder whats going on, connection? or they thinking? or me?|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess south is thining, in case his partner has CA|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am not sure now. It's been too long.|pg||
nt|peachy: no way to contact the operator, they dont speak english or read|pg||
nt|peacokk: på @HA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|peachy: This was a good play, whats the name of this Deschapelles? even if declarer had Qxxx hearts, it was right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Merrimac Coup|pg||
nt|po-s: I think one must bid 2H. It is imossible to clarify later that you have a sixloser hand|pg||
nt|peacokk: Sörling-Andersson har haft en väldigt fin halvlek i det öppna rummet|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks Roland, I dont remember the names much :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or just Axxx of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but this I'm told this is a different Stefanov :(|pg||
nt|po-s: impossible is what I intended|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and a 6-card-suit|pg||
mc|9|nt|jbgood: excellent|pg||
nt|po-s: Ish is contemplating his trump play - if one defender ha Hx|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Step 1 är att se till att det blir ramasänding och det har man lyckats med. Grattis Göteborg!|pg||
nt|peacokk: Bra jobb Tobias, vi ses till nästa halvlek|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Linköping var först, nu Göteborg, så kanske Stockholm nästa år|pg||
nt|vugraphzeu: Vi återkommer om ca 20 minuter.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Vi ses snart igen!|pg||
nt|peacokk: Det var sista given vid det här bordet. Bra jobbat Tobias!|pg||
nt|vugraphzeu: Tack för nu. Lite osäker på när nästa match börjar.|pg||
pg||
