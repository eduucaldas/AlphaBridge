nt|Walddk2: An interesting one; North is in 2@DX|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: looks like a battle between 2@C e/w and 1 or 2@S n/s|pg||

pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: I like 1NT; partner often has four spades on this auction|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jbgood: agreed, Roland|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East could pass, as West is a passed hand, but that's rather giving up |pg||

nt|itinerant: likely 4 or 5 imps 800 vs -620/650|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: The scottish author Robert Gray once published an article in The Bridge World called "ace, king, queen, jack"|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: proving that this isn't really a "Forcing Pass"|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: welcome back to the quater finals of the 2010 NOT|pg||
nt|itinerant: SOLD!|pg||
nt|itinerant: unsold!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: is this a replay?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: about prizes for the best hand submitted in a competition featuring a key trick containing those four honors in the same suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: now a balance in clubs|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: it wasnt sold...just misclicked the pass |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nibal really wanted to start with DBL :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 20/20|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry 21/19|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: is 3@H forcing?|pg||
nt|itinerant: and the auction comes to life!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he should have passed|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes best the first tim |pg||
nt|marlowepi: can happen here in diamonds|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bucheister: May not make but E cannot guess what will make|pg||
nt|sybarra: but Nibal has the major,  tough to pass it out |pg||
nt|itinerant: Ware is unlikely to double 4H for penalties now that he knows his clubs are worth nothing on defence|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: welcome all. since players are anonymous we can expect some wild bridge:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: unlucky choice of opening lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: N not overly exited about the Dbl may bid 2@S|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: slowly they turn, inch by inch, step by step|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Alex - "Tell all the under age Kibbs to leave the room and i will tell Nabil to leave too"  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes deserved a boot|pg||
nt|mamos:  I dont like passing with North over 1@S  you end up in this Russian roulette kind of situation|pg||
nt|sharkey: E bid 1 NT with no @S stopper or conventional?|pg||
mb|d|nt|tez: in my system yes|pg||
nt|tez: yours?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.ibf-festival.org/index.php?lang=en  for the festival website|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Later today we will be showing the finals of the Invitational Pairs, 24 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: i wouldnt know, but i would bid 4@H with north hand even if 3@H is forcing|pg||
nt|bucheister: kind of a wild lead; K clubs seems very natural|pg||
nt|sharkey: N thinks he has shown 3 @S thus giving S the choice of strains|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not where I though this wud end...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|itinerant: lol|pg||
nt|itinerant: that was v. quiet|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: knew Ware would bid 3@C!|pg||
nt|poohbear: Right!  Don't try this at home folks . These are trained professionals|pg||
nt|sybarra: Barry,  the next game is on!|pg||
nt|poohbear: auction prob went the same way at the other table|pg||
nt|sybarra: (football that is)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: knowing S has the strong hand, easier for Nabil to pass out|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Ware " You knew you were getting the world" - McManus "Either that or they missed a grand"|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may be playing clubs from  S at the other table |pg||
nt|april7: its a weak third hand openingand N takes the X out, might be better to bid 2@S instead of 2@D|pg||
nt|april7: best lead|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|tomi2: this hand lokks like a "game" hand and not like a partscore and not like a slam hand|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|poohbear: In the meantime Pascale achieved a better EW score when she tried to pass it out|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: i was trying my best for the Kiddies|pg||
nt|sharkey: S knows he's playing in 4-3 anyway Avram?|pg||
nt|sharkey: N probably showing 3541 - perhaps 2@S better contract to ruff @C with short trumps|pg||
nt|mamos:  1NT bid may cause declarer to misguess / misplace @SQ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|tomi2: dont like to overtake and then think what to return|pg||
nt|april7: due to the NT bid, N will not find the Q of @S but could get home giving up a@H 1@C 1@S and 2 @D|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nice double, partner conveniently shows up with 2 defensive tricks :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: want to predict auction in other room?     i think Whibley-Milne will open either 2@C or 2N with South -- not sure about exact ranges|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cindy:  hi all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Eddie Manfield right again -- 5 level belongs to the opponents|pg||
nt|mamos:  or more Clubs|pg||
nt|april7: should N find the Q of @S then overtricks|pg||
pc|c7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi cindy welcome|pg||
nt|april7: cash A of @H and finesse @S and give up a @H, looks easy but....|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: really? 5D was cold, no?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but this going for 500, isn't it?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N may have thought pass byS was forcing|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|tomi2: on some layouts, when west has @SK, a spade switch by w might make opps to refuse finesse. on other deals partner might judge if you should contunue clubs, if you give him your ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: count, so he should first make a plan how to defend this hand and then duck or overtake|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mamos:  what do we know?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: diamond shift comes too late, needed it at trick one|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: i think 2@C=18-19 bal, but don't quote me|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 1 club, 3 clubs?|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Bilal, has left the table momentarilly|pg||
nt|bucheister: Bilal is making a small comeback but has a long way to go|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yuk -- in my book when north jumps to 4@S instead of starting with 4@D -- no forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well 4D might be played as a slam try by many|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i know some who think we'd all save tons if we just abandoned forcing pass concept completely|pg||
nt|april7: W miscounted the hand, he should know N has a singleton @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not impressive by W...|pg||
nt|mamos:  i guess we'll soon be in 4@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: W DID know N had singleton - may be lazy...?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not me, i simply abandoned the pass concept completely|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tejjyid: possible South could have considred a splinter on the way to game|pg||
nt|tez: brave @h|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt|pg||
nt|bucheister: standard auction|pg||
nt|bucheister: a lead problem for E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=(19)20-22    way too wide a range for me|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tomi2: difficult to find a lead now. @D would have worked nicely. @C solves some problems for opps now|pg||
nt|tez: big brother says 2 down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 56 IMPs is too wide a range, you cant be a purist when you arestuck a packet|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not to mention -- East too good|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c8|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: big 14 to give Mile the lead, at least for now :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tejjyid: but 6 is a tad fortuitous|pg||
nt|tez: ace of @c and q of @d|pg||
nt|tomi2: interesting hand for both, defense and declarer. west might play a hart now to kick off dummies entry|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tez: @h is best now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tomi2: well donw|pg||
nt|tomi2: done|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2N openers routinely kill slam bidding, that is the biggest problem|pg||
pc|s6|nt|april7: W has enough trumps to ruff a @S and a @D|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: W hand a pretty thin opener, nevertheless advisable in view of the colors, playability in 3 suits including both majors, and the fact that you get to name the suit you want led|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|marlowepi: really E should bid a game there, even though nonvul and you cant claim honors. the hand has 7 Losing Trick Count, and your best side cards are in partner's suit|pg||

nt|ahollan1: saving overtrick was easier than @D lead for the beat|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|bucheister: this is a modern 3C preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@C.... & 6@H & 6 NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kiwibridge: nice Jordan great job by you|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if 2@C is natural, then a balanceis reasonable|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: nicely cut Matt out of the auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am suprised that N is not in this bidding|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure i understand 1@C=2+ but natural responses rather than transfers|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: how lucky for N that S does not have a normal hand for the 4H bid|pg||
nt|cindy:  now 5C looks like a @h sl;am try|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not if you have agreed that it isnt|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  of course no idea their agreements|pg||
nt|bucheister: the one level opening followed by 1NT kept them low|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 6@C is possible, but not easy to reach|pg||
nt|vugraphzfn: not the usuall pupit stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzfn: i didnt hear all that alon said|pg||
nt|vugraphzfn: somthing about 3-2 or 2-2 in majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzfn: If someone know - please do tell|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharkey: In Slava Cup last weekend we had a board where Grand was makeable in all suits and NT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: hang on Shirl -- i'm getting my thesaurus   "surprised" doesn't quite cover it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: natural was best on this layout, made it hard for Matt to hop in, but surprised he didn't|pg||
nt|sybarra: it may not |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kiwibridge: and soon they will face the question: do we come out guns blazing 50 behind, or do we just concede|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|bucheister: E will keep searching for W opening bid; for not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club length with spade length means down i think|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jcwla: Lots of "I'll choose the weakish noise this time and accept any tries" in this segment -- followed by no try -- followed by +200 etc|pg||
nt|itinerant: one disadvantage of using transfer responses to 1C is the extra space it gives your opponents. On this hand, for example, a 1H transfer by Alex would have allowed Matt to X showing ...|pg||
nt|itinerant: hearts, if that was their method|pg||
nt|sybarra: no clue what else to say |pg||
nt|mamos:  this may make in NT or @C but .......... this looks the sensible spot|pg||
nt|mamos:  sorry may make slam|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: the 4H bid was curious|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@H showing @H works here too|pg||

nt|sybarra: slightly more "normal" auction in the other room |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|vugrapha2: False claim is why it went down|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: "senior" moments in other words :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: i'm told 1@C=2 ONLY IF  4=4=3=2, so not all balanced hands|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: will it be 3 or 6 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do we get to vote?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can Matt still have Q@S for his pass?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he can't have what he's already shown, so who knows|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tejjyid: nicely done by West|pg||

nt|jcwla: Well, it doesn't get any closer than this.|pg||
nt|cindy:  ewwww|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you would end up in 4-3 Ds instead of 62 clubs on a lot of hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe "d"  unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=11-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: for the oficial scores at the end of the match look on the abf website|pg||
nt|bucheister: Two more boards this set; thanks to our viewgrapher for a great job|pg||
nt|marlowepi: (e) lack of methods|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C forcing to 2N or 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: 3D is probably a limit raise or better in Hearts|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: immediate 2N over the double = both minors, equal length or one more club|pg||
nt|marlowepi: delayed 2N = this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H splinter forces to game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least i'm going to guess they can't stop in 4@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2: 11 imps for NS on that hand with 11 red cards, other table drowe to slam. here now a playable slam but you will most often fail on trump break.  there were now several possible ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: slams on finesses or good breaks of suits, this causes lots of imps, most of them are (un)lucky and not just because of your better play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not really an issue with North's holding|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamond queen is best shot double dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not unreasonable either|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: easy queen of clubs lead:)|pg||
nt|cindy:  im feeling a @c lead coming|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ophir upgrading his good 14 |pg||

nt|ahollan1: really?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kiwibridge: greetings everyone a nail biter|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: was there a 1 imp adjustment J?|pg||
nt|jcwla: dk|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Max so 0-0 with 16 to go :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  this is good|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@S is the right bid by East here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's good bidding|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: didn't 3@H show entire hand?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: american star Jack Oest says "even thinking over 3N was an overbid"|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent lead, and not because of result|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: McManus did NOT have a mechanism to show weak hand with both minors|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: wow and it goes further|pg||
nt|marlowepi: did S give this one enough gas, would we say?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: guessing S thinks it is his side that is stuck 55|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|bucheister: what does the panel think about souths immediate 5H bid; is pass forcing?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trying to make final set more interesting?|pg||
nt|april7: I think when the rebid is 1NT then opening 1NT is possible with 14 in third and fourth posititon|pg||
nt|april7: and best|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugrapha2: yep|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcwla: Cue up Boy George...I know all there is to know about the crying game...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: against high suit contracts, usually better to lead from short strength than longer weakness|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|janm: Whether P is forcing depends on their agreements - I think it's very hard not to bid 5@h if P isn't forcing, and not sure whether N would work out to DBL if S made a forcing pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: Problable makes 8 as S will get an overruff|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: does he need to play @H now -- or can he pull one more trump?|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps @H,   leading up to K ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure Al what is best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's what i thought instinctively -- but i never trust my instinct|pg||
nt|sybarra: if it wins,  @D  back to ace,  ht again?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugrapha2: and thats the 6th flat board this segment|pg||
nt|bucheister: I agree totally; a human being bids 5H|pg||
nt|poohbear: Dbl is clearcut with the North hand. An ace and only 3 trumps|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kiwibridge: assumin this is down may need a final set|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree S should pass 3N, but we can surely see hy he liked his hand so much, and he undoubtedly felt there was safety above 3N. to me the even more surprising call is 6C, because ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S can SEE that the 4S call was not a high-card control|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N was bothering to show Qx of spades, it is very likely because he has only 4 clubs and would be willing to play in 4S|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: no way to make now, except for false claim of course:)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|cindy:  lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: I've seen some 16 worse that North's hand Avram|pg||
nt|april7: true|pg||
nt|mamos:  the match is very tight - it may all come down to the odd trick here and there|pg||
nt|april7: but 14 should be in the system if the rebidis 1NT, but best in pairs |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: i think cashing @DA works only because !AH not with long @D|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|april7: but only in 3d and 4th position, not to make it easy for opps after a 1@C opening|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 2@S seems a strange response ro @C and another|pg||
nt|cindy:  whats 1N   a grabit ?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|april7: S might cash ace of @H, if not E ruffs a @C and plays the @S from the top|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|bucheister: what does the panel think about the 2H rebid by W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: it might be the only situation where I rebid 2S with 6-4|pg||
nt|bucheister: this auction should show a very good 6-4?|pg||
nt|poohbear: then over 2NT i can rebid 3H and partner knows I got this|pg||
nt|april7: E is looking for 7|pg||
nt|sharkey: May get there now... - probably guessing|pg||
nt|april7: has to find the Q, but if @S are not led then S has the Q!!!!|pg||
mb|6S|nt|marlowepi: probably like a forcing NT. has the advantage of going slow & letting pd rebid naturally at 2 level. 2H might bix N and the suit is not that good anyway|pg||
nt|cindy:  im told 1N is supposed to be 9+ game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: well said|pg||
nt|poohbear: not in a 2/1 auction|pg||
nt|janm: The 2@h rebid convinced East to play 3NT - 4@s is a better contract, I think|pg||
nt|poohbear: Agree Jan|pg||
nt|poohbear: if He bids 2S then 3H he gets to 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: more curious is the 2N bid, but N cannot force to game (3D presumably) and 2D might not be forcing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was Thomas on vugrapg sorry and a great job|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think you're rite Mike - an IMP here and ther - so far payout on 3 boards 3,2 and 1 IMPs|pg||

nt|peachy: excitement from the start|pg||
nt|poohbear: Well is it clear that its a forcing auction? I suspect the hand with 2 aces will dbl but bidding 4@cs is asking them to bid 4@s|pg||
