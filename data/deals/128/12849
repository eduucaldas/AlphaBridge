nt|jbgood: is with the first 16 counted and given a match result|pg||
nt|mr murray: way too heavy. 2n/t is much more descriptive|pg||

pc|s4|nt|hantveit: except on blw. The broders using a, for me, strange system where you answer before you have been asked.|pg||
nt|jbgood: Based on the NBF Data results after 8 rounds and the live update scores registered|pg||

nt|panja: only 9 top tricks...|pg||
nt|panja: and now with @S 44...there will be a problem|pg||
nt|peachy: West should continue hearts, ten probably, but not sure so easy to see|pg||
nt|peachy: or if I am right|pg||
nt|panja: GIB shows @HT will kill the contract..it will because...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: This could be a 2-way swing, since 4@D is makable NS if you get @H into play early enough|pg||
nt|imp_jan: easy heart switch|pg||

nt|imp_jan: and then it's made|pg||
nt|peachy: Gib says yes|pg||
nt|panja: after winning Decl will have to remove trumps..|pg||
nt|panja: but then there will be only 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|panja: say he tries to get his ruff before..by playing a small Club..|pg||
nt|panja: E will win and back a @S...|pg||
nt|bucheister: Hi everyone; I am John Buchheister and will commenting in the Closed Room.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|panja: now, S can win @SA, cash @CA, ruff a @C with @SQ pull trumps...but now...he cannot enjoy @H6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|panja: because @H9 blocks it|pg||
nt|peachy: i think it will be difficult to defend at both tables, regardless of lead|pg||
nt|panja: one kib suggests S drop @H9 under @HK if W played @HT..|pg||
nt|panja: that will not work either because E, after winning @CQ, will back a @D..|pg||
nt|panja: now...S cannot play a @H to finesse against West's @H85 combination before removing trumps..|pg||
nt|panja: and after removing trumps, he has not entry back to hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: Sidney is still thinking|pg||

nt|jbgood: rehi Shirl|pg||
nt|othered1: good morning, Shirley!|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H  happy valentines day to all |pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Ed :)  |pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: i'm a michaels-er w/E|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: S counts his diamonds once more|pg||
nt|panja: doubling is not a great option with E hand..|pg||
nt|peachy: I assume E treats this as singlesuiter again|pg||
nt|peachy: aah, it was not a singlesuiter, three options|pg||
nt|panja: but the dbl isn't business here..it is conventional..both Majors or one minor, or a strong hand..|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mr murray: these guys are bidders. They wont miss any games.|pg||
nt|panja: so...it almost gives up on penalising 1Nt|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: not a big loss against strong NT, IMO|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra: and checking backs of cards  (same deck?)|pg||
nt|peachy: against weak NT, different|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|panja: S has stuck his neck out..|pg||
nt|panja: could get chopped..|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps lebensohl|pg||
nt|lmeili: S has shape, he likes to play rather than def|pg||
nt|peachy: brave 3C|pg||
nt|mr murray: thats what happens when u dbl with 5 spades and 2 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzce: Lin is thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: very aggressive evaluation by S|pg||
nt|peachy: S really didnt have abid first rd|pg||
nt|panja: if N had started with, say KQxx in @S...this would have been a disaster..|pg||
nt|peachy: hello Phoebe|pg||
nt|lmeili: if his X means T/O that wii be more clear|pg||
nt|lmeili: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: another interesting bidding sequence|pg||
nt|panja: E should dbl this to show strength...|pg||
nt|panja: and W should remove to 3@S|pg||
nt|lmeili: Lin & Liu are not regular partner, so they might have no agreement on this|pg||
nt|peachy: I think Pass works fine, get the plus that is likely coming|pg||
nt|mr murray: no getting away from it now. 5 diamonds so comphy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzce: Liu wrote "3C" on the paper to west|pg||
nt|peachy: they might scramble ten tricks here, most likely|pg||
nt|mr murray: only my students do that these days. :)|pg||
nt|peachy: that is why they are still your students Murray :)|pg||
nt|mr murray: possible make|pg||
nt|mr murray: true I need the money :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: difficult contract, if it can ever be made|pg||
nt|rodal f: By 10HP at S. 1NT or 2@S from u Walter by 2/1?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S|pg||
nt|bibanu: 8 tricks |pg||
nt|bucheister: Interesting; no question that 2S is right in MP; what about IMPs; opener if limited to 15hcp; what do you all think|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: YYY|pg||
nt|panja: 2Nt might make..it is not all that bad a contract...had S held @DT, it would be cold|pg||
nt|panja: 3@S also has decent chances of making|pg||
nt|peachy: 3S could slip home|pg||
nt|panja: simply concede a small @H..|pg||
nt|panja: and then @HA ruff a @H and @S hook|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: now Lin takes another long thinking|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bigtrain: i really like being a bit heavy with little shape|pg||
nt|bibanu: i vote for 2s also John|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  3@C looks better to me|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bibanu: in 2/1 2c can have 2 cards|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bibanu: 3 cards now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: And there the 1NT can come inside|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: can you take a view on @H's?  do you need it?|pg||
nt|jbgood: he needs to shift to a heart now - and give him the view:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he might try a club|pg||
nt|jbgood: i would think that a club would be his last choice:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but not easy to lead from qxx of hts either |pg||
nt|jbgood: no - a heart return is not easy|pg||
nt|jbgood: but SO is capable of finding it|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess @H is only real chance for defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: if he leads ht,  might he even lead Q|pg||
nt|othered1: Q looks like loser|pg||
nt|sybarra: true,  no future ,  maybe pard has J or 10 |pg||
nt|rodal f: brb|pg||
nt|bucheister: not with a spade opener|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbgood: the royal family would detest more queens being beheaded|pg||
nt|peachy: better get clubs going now|pg||
nt|peachy: too late|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: as you predicted Jon |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mr murray: good start for e-w. when cards are bid badly it improves ones declarer play|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tejjyid:  not my fault they play a bad system :) - but Ok, then 2@S mandatory|pg||
nt|bucheister: nice guess|pg||
nt|bibanu: 5323 or 5233 and he wil bid 2clubs after 1nt forcing one round|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ctcbabbo: NS pair use Gazzilli here. North will bid 2D with 8+ and either 2H/2S with less|pg||
nt|panja: might stop in partial?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ctcbabbo: south's 2C is either natural to a forcing 1NT or any 17+|pg||
nt|ctcbabbo: south knows north has less than 8 HCP, but he has good spade fit, and north is likely short in H.  He may find a raise to 3D which north will carry to 4S|pg||
mb|3S|an|17+|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ctcbabbo: a raise to 3S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: so...North's rebid was a little tentative....he didn't know 17+ at that time. After the 3@S raise, easy..|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ctcbabbo: south will open this hand 1NT if Vul. but at not Vul. they open 11-14 1NT.|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H!|nt|sybarra: does E push on?|pg||
mb|d|nt|bucheister: 13-15 hcp no trump opening|pg||
nt|bibanu: he played as in MP for 33 in spades|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: he knows pard has few spades |pg||
nt|bucheister: what do you all lead; might find the heart lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: (if any)|pg||
nt|lmeili: good decision N!|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: seems a misunderstanding here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: the @H10 should be suit preference|pg||
nt|rodal f: b|pg||
nt|bigtrain: shen opening leader makes a short suit lead, the most valuable information for partner is what suit to shift to|pg||
nt|peachy: about 200 coming for NS|pg||
nt|lmeili: not best lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: Shen is in deep thought now|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|bigtrain: shen = when|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: ;Nice effort by NS to push EW up one too high|pg||
nt|sybarra: just one short |pg||
nt|sybarra: pesky of the @Hs to be 3/1 |pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@s a good save..|pg||
nt|sybarra: double dummy  cant 5 @H make? |pg||
nt|othered1: I don't see it|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 black losers|pg||
nt|sybarra: finesse club now,  then win returrn,  cash all hearts and finesse clubs again?|pg||
nt|jbgood: unless defense does anything stupid in clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep right,  think the club spots are not good enough  (no 10 |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|othered1: West h as a number of choices here, none effective as cards lie and will take some time to work things out.  |pg||
nt|peachy: maybe 300 if all goes well|pg||
nt|bibanu: he found it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bucheister: many good players are leading passively against 1nt all pass; rather than the old aggressive|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|jbgood: he may try to drop a singleton H in N|pg||

nt|othered1: I don't know their methods, but with many once you're past the usual ace-asking bid, you must find a way indirectly, if at all.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|othered1: Maybe in a natural method, east could try 5@S hoping for a 6@C re-cuebid|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|othered1: 5N may have accomplished the same thing|pg||
nt|jbgood: Frank Ove Sandvik, Per Halvorsen, Anders Dale, Geir Husebø, Helge Toft, Harald Bastiansen also won their heat and will be the 3rd Bergen (Hordaland) team in the premier league. ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: Congrats to them!!|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|nt|lmeili: 2@d =gf|pg||
nt|lmeili: 4@h/@s are good except 3N|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: not everyones 2 @S...|pg||
nt|othered1: Will east apply "the law" and raise?|pg||
nt|sybarra: a spec suggested 3 nt .....but not sure you can handle even with @D lead |pg||
nt|jbgood: too soft values for a weak jump|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bucheister: good game in the open room|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|peachy: this auction might cause declarer to misguess hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Two last board for this segment. By from me but stil luck to Lin and the specs:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jbgood: nt game look the more attractive one, yes|pg||
nt|othered1: I might guess you can handle 3N on @D lead|pg||
nt|lmeili: ty|pg||
nt|peachy: another small pickup for Zen Ho|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bibanu: interesting action in OR|pg||

pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jbgood: interting to see|pg||
nt|lmeili: this slam quite reasonable but bad luck|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: last two boards here !|pg||
nt|bucheister: as a passed hand S might have tried 3H|pg||
nt|bucheister: would be a great slam to reach|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: I think a trick short but lots of spades will make hand uncomfortable fot S |pg||
nt|sybarra: *for|pg||
nt|rodal f: A good 6er. Onlu 28.3% for 4-1|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|othered1: South has to duck @H then will be more than just uncomfortable on @S run|pg||
nt|jbgood: this is the penultimate hand of a long weekend, and some credits are due. The first thanks go to BBO and the NBF for broadcasting this prestigious event. |pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|lmeili: with no fit of @h N's 2@h bids is reasonable, N can't see the best final contract|pg||
nt|peachy: game is on, with heart guess but as we can see, was misguessed in OP, reasonably|pg||
pc|h5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jbgood: And of course a big thank you to our excellent operator, Liv Marit Grude, well done!|pg||

nt|peachy: Thank you operator for flawless work!!!|pg||

nt|peachy: Thanks to Roland Wald, vugraph coordinator, BBO, and the Chinese Taipei Contract Bridge for bringing this evvent for all to see|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mr murray: strange no method to get other hand to play it. most of time it would be beneficial.|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: this is so-called "Ji Kuang" convention in Taiwan|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lmeili: this is funny for S to bid 2@h, i can agree if he bids 3@c|pg||
