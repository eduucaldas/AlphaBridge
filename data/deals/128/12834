nt|hedyg: S can always overtake the Q@d|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: was thinking..lead the @D3...ten, ace then maybe six towards dummy - if S plays low, N wins Q and has to concede a ruff-sluff, if the hand had been eliminated. Not possible now of ...|pg||

pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: when S plays the ten od Ds on first round of suit, clear for N to unblock the queen|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then no crocodile necessary|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it will be most annoying for North in the other room if his team-mates come back with -100  |pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the heart length is surely with N, so if he has Qxxx (no nine) the heart ten on 1st round of suit works by brute force. even if he has Q9xx, he may not cover, and if perchance he ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: has Qx after all  it is almost sure he will not cover|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but.........|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think Hedy's reference to "@H 9x @@ S" was an endorsement of this play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if hearts are 33 it makes no difference which heart is led from dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe i should not have said it |pg||
nt|roswolf: i think if declarer had ducked a diamond earlier he might have pulled it off|pg||
nt|roswolf: i just dont see how the defenders can go wrong|pg||

nt|hedyg: such as opps playing 3 M and you have AKQJ10 in the suit was the example i was given|pg||

nt|roswolf: perhaps a little extreme but sound enough principle|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h4|nt|hedyg: just a little extreme :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4-0 trumps is not enough to beatthe slam, also spades must be 5-1|pg||
nt|csabi: and if they go down in 6@C they still win 11 IMPs|pg||
