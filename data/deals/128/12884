mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: lead problem.... |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|paulg:  i think it is always hard to bid 4@s unless East opens 1@d|pg||
nt|paulg:  even a 3@d overcall would probably prevent it|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  may get to 3NT  and can make with J@S laying well|pg||
nt|garnetts: This may make but the auction bad --what is wrong with a 1@S rebid?|pg||
nt|paulg:  if I were going to open the East hand, as I would, I think I'd mention the spades|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|paulg:  not that it has affected the final contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always difficult, whether to lead your own suit (as here) or partner's|pg||
nt|othered1: May depend on your minimum suit quality standard for the weak 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: junior players are not renowned for having 100-honour suits for their weak twos, in general |pg||
nt|othered1: If it's like mine -- 3 of top 5, not KJ10 or QJ10 -- you lead partner's suit.|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|dinos1: 1@d overcall wdnt prevent|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  do you think you can find a junior who would bid 1@d?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I understand that the modern game involves bidding to poor contrcats like this though |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|ady: fortunate contract   clubs splitting well and spade position good|pg||
nt|paulg:  but South can switch to hearts now|pg||
nt|garnetts: can't be bothered to work out the odds of it making on a @D lead  but I think it is tiny |pg||
pc|s6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|dinos1: )))|pg||
nt|othered1: now has to g uess the @C position|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now, play to drop the ace or to pin the jack of clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer should have an almost exact count on the hand.  But that doesn't necessarily tell everything.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  the carding certainly looks like the diamonds are 4-4, and he cannot afford a heart switch, so I think Gyles Ellison should have won the second diamond|pg||
pc|c6|nt|garnetts: which is why there is a premium on good card play--that is win the first @D and get on with it |pg||
pc|d4|pc|c2|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|s7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems a fair but unsuccessful defence from North ... seems more likely that partner had a singleton spade than the @cA?|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 5@d opener at any other vulnerability|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with an unpassed partner a difficult decision for S|pg||

mb|p|nt|ewj:  as north?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the bid is about right  at these colours|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|garnetts: If EW lead spades at every chance they might just beat this--for example east can ruff the foruth round with the 10@C and I expect South will throw a @D |pg||
nt|paulg:  EW can cross ruff to six tricks|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||

nt|paulg:  Ireland gained a deserved 10 IMPs on board 1, when Scotland failed to find the 3NT game and went down in 4@s|pg||
nt|garnetts: this is always true --people think about what they should be doing at the wrong time |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: sorry, error on data entry.|pg||
nt|paulg:  +1? I guess Ellison must have cleared trumps|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|garnetts: should have been planning somehting at trick two--and once the second high spade had been played only two more rounds offered a chance |pg||
pc|c7|nt|paulg:  yes, a simple counting of declarer's tricks would have shown that they could not beat it with this defence|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|garnetts: Worthwhile point made earlier if 21S is more of a prebalance than a full blooded bid then 4@S is right here--definetely somehting serious partnerships should discuss|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|dinos1: that's why I asked)|pg||

nt|dinos1: 18.5 :)|pg||
nt|ady: surely this a throw in|pg||
nt|paulg:  i know that East-West are a new partnership, albeit of experienced players, and I believe North-South are also fairly new|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Walddk4: I am sorry, but we do not have an open room at the moment. Connectivity problems at the venue in Wales|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  all four played with different partners in last year's event|pg||
nt|ady: west might fancy a 4th in hand opening|pg||
nt|garnetts: time to throw one in |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  so there will be much that they have yet to discuss|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Walddk4: This is a fine grand slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  Ellison seems to have aged suddenly ... that looks like a normal 3@c opener|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 7NT is obviously laydown|pg||
nt|paulg:  I think East should really pass with a weak notrump|pg||
nt|dinos1: think 3@c promises at least 5-4|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|helene_t:  yes, 3@c shows a good hand since the double only promised hearts, not necessarily clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: can see no point in opening in fourth seat with that junk--I always get too high |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  won't get there that way|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine 1@d shows @hs|pg||
nt|dinos1: now it's hard for W to believe they have 3 @s stoppers :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  must be from the Barry Crane school of grand slam bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6NT is for people who have a plane to catch|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@H leaves me speechless |pg||
nt|paulg:  well, almost |pg||
nt|paulg:  looks like 9 tricks with the favourable club position|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: Extremely lazy|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would rather chew my own arm off than bid that |pg||
nt|ady: east was surely going down in 1NT   north has come to the rescue and should go down|pg||
nt|garnetts: We used to call such bids penalty tries |pg||

pc|dJ|nt|ewj:  well I would have bid 3NT on East's hand|pg||
nt|helene_t:  3@d is usually played as forcing|pg||
nt|ewj:  partner as shown a very good hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N makes fairly easily|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion is 2nt an underbid on S|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT here is about 19-21 so South close to forcing to game|pg||
nt|jallerton: I would have bid 2@s on her hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  she has 21, and her best suit is likely to play for only 3 tricks after the opening bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  so her 21 is not as good as it looks|pg||

pc|c4|nt|ewj:  But less pleased when he finds out that the opponents havent missed game|pg||

nt|paulg:  they play 15-17 1NT opener according to the CC|pg||
nt|jtr: I though both sides were playing strong|pg||
nt|jtr: thought|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dinos1: 5+? or 5@s4m?|pg||
mb|2H|an|weak|nt|Walddk4: Maybe the rebid was 2NT?|pg||
nt|jtr: So, the only system where the 1NT shows 18 is some variety transfers|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   should reach 4@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg:  5+@s apparently|pg||
nt|paulg:  i expect that they can wriggle to 2@d here, although South will bid 2@h first|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|paulg:  3@s shows good suit and good points according the CC|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ady: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@d possibly says diamonds and a major (spades here)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: unless taking a very good guess in spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: may well get the spade right after the overcall|pg||
nt|ady: does 2@H show hearts and a minor?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jtr: More likely Roland|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess it depends on what you open normally |pg||
nt|paulg:  will Ellison let Morgan escape in 3@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|helene_t:  hmmm ... wouldnt it be useful to distinguish between a 5-card suit and a 6-card suit?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm not sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  @cA now|pg||
nt|paulg:  and Boyd may lead the @sJ to tempt a cover|pg||
nt|ady: scotland did get the game swing on hand 4 in 4 spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless North has five clubs, it is hard to see when playing clubs is wrong|pg||
nt|garnetts: it is obviously right |pg||
nt|othered1: why is north not making quantitative @H bid? |pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|paulg:  2@d is game forcing checkback|pg||
nt|dinos1: suit is really good (but short), hand is max :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jtr: Another easy slam:)|pg||
nt|helene_t:  true|pg||
nt|dinos1: S will be surplised when see @sK9 in pd's hand)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: Perhaps not as good as the last one|pg||
nt|paulg:  my style is to respond 2@c on these hands, rather than 1@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Plenty good for me of course|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ah, an open room!|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: off to the open room.  See 'ya.|pg||
nt|jtr: Bye people Enjoy|pg||
pc|sK|nt|garnetts: it would right with AQx too |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|paulg:  declarer could win this in hand and play on hearts, perhaps playing for some sort of club-spade squeeze|pg||
pc|cK|nt|othered1: not sure h ow you can pull trumps without killing squeeze entries|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dinos1: 3@s4@c1@h1@d = 9|pg||
pc|c8|nt|paulg:  Morgan's play is a lot more considered ... in other words, a lot slower than his partner|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  lacking entries here to take the spade finesse more than twice|pg||
nt|paulg:  but can still make three spades, two hearts, diamond and three clubs in total|pg||
nt|jtr: Did have them but got distracted by @cs|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: well guessed    potential game swing for Ireland|pg||
nt|paulg:  in reality I think he is still trying to find a layout where he can make it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  well done|pg||
nt|paulg:  the auction will be different in the other room, where they play a strong 1NT ... West might show 5-5|pg||
nt|garnetts: The finesse was with the odds based on the overcall and vacant spaces |pg||
nt|garnetts: cannot see west passing next door either |pg||
pc|hT|nt|paulg:  declarer unable to imagine what else the double could be on|pg||
nt|dinos1: he played Q?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: sadly her outside values are worthless on a spade lead|pg||

nt|jallerton: though I am not sure of the merit of such methods in 3rd seat|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|paulg:  Morgan intending to play a forcing defence|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ewj:  the "dynamic duo"'s bidding looks a bit rubbish|pg||
nt|ewj:  did East not fancy showing his AKQx?|pg||
nt|paulg:  well, South did show both majors|pg||
nt|ewj:  and why did West not double 2@C to show a good hand|pg||
nt|ewj:  yeh but his partner did t/o double 2H and bid 3h|pg||
nt|ewj:  he surely had spades for bidding like that|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, but you and I both know that there will be some deep reason for this sequence|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||

nt|paulg:  part of the reason is that the old guard is migrating to the seniors ... leaving space for the new|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  the british teams are doing okay in the curling at the moment|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we k now EW's 1N opening range?|pg||

mb|1D|nt|paulg:  but they'll be the scottish teams if they do not medal|pg||

mb|2C|nt|paulg:  good slam here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|paulg:  East gives the double the respect it deserves|pg||
nt|dinos1: wasnt 2N showed supp?|pg||
nt|paulg:  although I thought 2NT was probably a good raise to 3@H|pg||
nt|dinos1: unusual to play it as nat after X|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, 2N shows support, mistake by W|pg||
nt|helene_t:  yes, W must be tirred|pg||
nt|dinos1: didnt notice X card?|pg||
nt|paulg:  East might just bid 6@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 5@C is wrong young man. 4NT is the bid if you want to compete|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@C shows preference for clubs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: just bidding his stronger minor roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are stronger, admittedly|pg||
nt|ady: need to play in 6@H |pg||
mb|3H|nt|dinos1: now guess @d - and make|pg||
nt|paulg:  i was going to ask for the imposter in the North seat to be replaced if Gyles had passed that hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jtr: But his clubs are better:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: to the point |pg||
nt|garnetts: no faffing about--good auction to the best spot |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  he does prefer @cs....the 5|pg||
nt|jtr: Sandie Millership is kindly getting scores from the other table|pg||
nt|jtr: The first 3 are flat|pg||
nt|garnetts: next |pg||
nt|paulg:  unlike the rest of the team, Gyles is one for the pragmatic approach|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dinos1: but think he'll misguess|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: This needs a squeeze to make|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|othered1: or a throw-in on east|pg||
nt|paulg:  easier to take the club finesse|pg||
nt|jtr: And no reason to look further than the @c finesse i guess|pg||
nt|jtr: Let's at least credit East for pushing them|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes he should have an idea of the hand since East cannot have 4@ds|pg||
nt|paulg:  if you happened to ruff the diamond and see that East has @dQxx, then you might start thinking|pg||
nt|othered1: they were headed for -800 and that's without things lying horribly|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5 over 5 is seldom right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Manfield/Klinger|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The 5-level belongs to the opponents|pg||
nt|jtr: 4 is flat also|pg||
nt|jtr: The record number of consecuitive flat boards in a junior event is 6|pg||
nt|paulg:  this board will not be flat ... even if they get to 5@h it will be doubled|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That was in 1974|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes April 23rd|pg||
pc|sA|nt|helene_t:  2NT shows a 3-card limit raise, also without the double|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think it will matter|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|othered1: I think east has to find a way to convince declarer that he doesn't have his actual hand.  Not sure how he can.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|othered1: and, just in case, that @S 10 should make it clear.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: last guess saves aren't generally productive - there are three possible results and two of them are bad|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|dinos1: now he's down 1|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|jtr: 5 is flat too|pg||

nt|paulg:  defence is still there|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|paulg:  as usual, it would have been better for both declarer and defence to have thought before this point|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|helene_t:  defense will have to give him a diamond trick, so it should make|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c6|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c4|pc|s5|nt|dinos1: after @c10 pitch 2N was makeable but d/dummy|pg||

mb|4N|nt|ewj:  2@H perhaps a bit much |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: cue surely|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe not preference to a likely 4/2 fit doesnt make sense|pg||

pc|sA|nt|paulg:  it was actually two free bids by East|pg||

nt|ewj:  indeed|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|d3|pg||

nt|ralfwil: best|pg||
nt|ralfwil: of course @hQ|pg||

nt|paulg:  the commentators in the other room will say, "nine tricks is an awful lot"|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  excellent slam here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jtr: Silly but good:)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk4: Then this game is too deep for you and me, David|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: I once bid 4@h over partner's Michaels with a singleton|pg||
nt|othered1: It's better if you're sure you're going to be on  lead.  Otherwise, partners sometimes don't have a sense of humor about it.|pg||
nt|garnetts: NS likely to compete to 3@C |pg||
nt|paulg:  double will get them to the club partscore|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  a perfect fit that may be difficult to diagnose|pg||
mb|d|nt|jtr: Then removed to 4@s with my 5 card suit|pg||
nt|jtr: They doubled that too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and partner pulled to 5@H I presume|pg||
nt|helene_t:  EW have a 2@h overcall that shows both majors, but apparently E found his hand too weak vulnerable|pg||
nt|paulg:  disciplined pass from East|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s denies three hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: is North awake?|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for South to bid now|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jtr: If he did he would be ex-partner:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: bad @s, 5422|pg||
mb|4S|nt|garnetts: perhaps ho didn't notice his partner double |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: 3h alerted as 15+|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Right.|pg||
nt|paulg:  opposite a passed partner too|pg||
nt|dinos1: @dA and @cA @c will endplay W|pg||
nt|paulg:  playing 5-card majors you would probably raise hearts rather than show spades, which would help|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: wrong|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: 5@D that is|pg||
nt|andyv:  @h lead and @s back|pg||
nt|jtr: East obviously tried to bid 3NT over 4@d|pg||
nt|ady: now 3@C from north    should be down1|pg||
pc|d2|nt|garnetts: looks like my prediction will happen but not in the way I figured |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|garnetts: North should have certainly raised over 2@C anyway--his partner could have been--actaully should have been much better|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  this will get it done too|pg||
nt|ady: there may be difficulties defeating 3@C|pg||
nt|garnetts: especially if South winds and leads a spade |pg||
nt|ady: east needs to win first heart trick and switch to a diamond|pg||
nt|garnetts: If that happens west has to play a low heart and get a @D switch immediately |pg||
nt|ady: easy to beat the contract from here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not that easy to find is it?|pg||
nt|ady: no|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|dinos1: dcl has to know E has 5@h's after this lead|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  was 4N to play?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|garnetts: very well done by dec--now we will see how good the defence is|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: good point|pg||
nt|paulg:  but not easy|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d7|pc|s4|pg||

nt|jallerton: or to make 6@c on @d lead|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ewj:  assuming they play standard count, west gave correct count|pg||
nt|vugraphzdj: 3H 8-9count with 4@S|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  and 6@s goes down on a @c ruff|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ewj:  West played low high in trumps if that meant anything|pg||

pc|h7|nt|vugraphzdj: If that had gone off, that would have surely been the end for Scotland|pg||

mc|12|nt|lestergold: ace ruffed out|pg||

nt|paulg:  this is a crucial round in the event .. Scotland need a large win as Ireland take on England|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: X?|pg||
nt|paulg:  double 1@s or bid 2@h?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  both Scotland and Ireland will then have one match left against supposedly weaker opposition|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: a part score in spades looks all |pg||
nt|paulg:  Ireland currently 8 VPs ahead|pg||
mb|2D|nt|paulg:  i think double is a lot better than 1@h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|garnetts: not sure I would pass East's hand |pg||
nt|garnetts: intiially I mean |pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: yes - perfect shape for X, and h is as 4-cd|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s is probably non-forcing|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|garnetts: For the record I prefer 2@H as I have such good pips--but it is rare to overcall with five |pg||
nt|ady: east prefered to keep silent  red against green   must be pleased once south has hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|helene_t:  yes but not perfect strength for x followed by 2@h|pg||
mb|p|pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|dinos1: wonder he pulled 1N|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@s is the game here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you open a hand like East's (I would too I must confess), you will get to no play games quite often|pg||
nt|jtr: But the @hs may get blocked|pg||
nt|paulg:  good hand to be playing 3/5 leads|pg||
nt|jtr: Still one down though|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: NS can still untangle it|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jtr: North seems to realise|pg||

nt|Walddk4: ?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  @c10 now, but i doubt that Ellison will underlead the @dA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|helene_t:  in standard methods E showed some 16+ points with his 2@h bid|pg||
pc|s2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|dinos1: yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  in their defence, the Irish Open team has made its reputation by bidding a great deal and the juniors are probably used to playing in poor games ... although you'd hope they'd be a lot better than this|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Scotland bidding the grand slam in the closed room now. For a start, they need to stay out of it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ewj:  West maybe worth a raise after partner opens a strong NT, and then bids 2@S freely?|pg||

nt|paulg:  they are playing 5-card majors, i wonder what a 2N response is by a passed hand?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: can raise to 4@H    costs nothing|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|paulg:  John Matheson points out that this defence makes sense if declarer has @hKx and good diamonds|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulg:  i guess if North is bidding over double then he would have bid on anyhow, but the double looks wrong|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: Board wrong way round so players names will be wrong|pg||
mb|1D|nt|paulg:  a little surprising that East did not balance in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: This round will conclude the cycle of the first round-robin|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  less reason here with nothing in spades|pg||

nt|dburn: odd, that|pg||
mb|1N|nt|garnetts: gets murky now maybe|pg||
nt|paulg:  so they had this auction in their last practise match, and Gyles Ellison was admonished for not bidding 1@s with the East hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: spades are the fourth suit |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  they play walsh, so bid 1@s with a weak hand even with longer diamonds|pg||

nt|dinos1: too strong for 1N - 17pc with good 5-cd suit and good honors|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 45 minutes: N Ireland v England|pg||
nt|paulg:  This is the last hand of the set|pg||
mb|1D|nt|paulg:  3 IMPs is a 15-15 draw, 4-10 IMPs for 16-14 VPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: Roland is 30?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: part score in spades for n/s looks best|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: will t hey be able to find the missing @CK?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dburn: no idea what this bidding means|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  2@s is transfer to clubs and I expect 3@c denies support|pg||
nt|the saint: Slam was bid in the Open|pg||
nt|Walddk4: OK David, whats the current score then?|pg||
nt|othered1: is Kx support?|pg||
nt|the saint: Same start, then, 3D-3H-3S-5C-5S-6C|pg||
nt|paulg:  Wales will play Ireland next. Hopefully being away from vugraph will give them a little more confidence and they can put up a good performance (a Scottish hope) |pg||
nt|paulg:  East a little fixed now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Partner can't have much on this auction|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: south has a choise of pass or 2@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: "@S looks right because it should be constructive |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Meant as exclusion RKCB I presume. What would 4@S be?|pg||
nt|othered1: would you try 5@S without detailed discussion?|pg||
nt|paulg:  undiscussed is my guess|pg||
nt|jtr: 5 clearer than 4|pg||
nt|the saint: NI in 2H NS on 10|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If 2@S denies a major, 4@S is clear|pg||
nt|paulg:  i agree|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S I mean |pg||
nt|Walddk4: And where is the heart suit Evans must be thinking|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: By the way, they are not playing with screens|pg||
nt|paulg:  good hands here but no good fit .. still tempting for East to make a try|pg||
nt|helene_t:  3@d? the normal rebid witrh the west hand would be 3@c|pg||
nt|helene_t:  2@c sorry|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: Which seems strange in 2010|pg||
nt|po-s: and no alert consquently|pg||
nt|dinos1: good 6@s contract - down on @c ruff|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|po-s: I  wonder what 2 keycards would help|pg||
nt|dinos1: agree - rebid shd be 2@c|pg||
nt|ady: overboard     would only have bid 2S with south hand|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: Last match today, in about 30 minutes, is Republic of Ireland (leaders) vs N Ireland|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont think exclusion was right here anyway|pg||
nt|ewj:  would 2@S definitely have been constructive?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  i think many club players would jump rebid on the West hand, but a 2@c rebid gives you more space and time to find the best spot|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

nt|ady: still looks a trick short|pg||
nt|ewj:  yep, doesnt really have any chance with @H not breaking|pg||
nt|paulg:  Ellison knows that the hearts are not coming in|pg||
nt|garnetts: In my view yes because with a weak hand and a lot of spades you should pass 2@H or maybe bid 2@S in the first place if that is available |pg||
nt|ewj:  Well he sort of does but he still will be hoping|pg||
nt|ewj:  well what if it's not available?|pg||

mb|p|nt|jallerton: Hope Sally does not think this is an autosplinter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  As far as I can tell, in the Junior Camrose Scotland are the only team that can overtake the Republic of Ireland and they need to win by 13 IMPs to do that|pg||
nt|lestergold: some play it as that|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|d9|nt|ewj:  10-12 and it would be a tie, so would that mean sharing of trophy or would it go on head to head|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: not the best lead of the match|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|paulg:  In the Peggy Bayer, Scotland are leading and a similar 13 IMPs will win the trophy whatever England do in their final match|pg||
