nt|by: how did they make that overtrick?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bucheister: finesse a diamond I think|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|othered1: 3@S = western cue, asking for @S stopper and nothing else.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bucheister: How many would preempt this hand?  Come on join in|pg||
nt|othered1: I wouldn't preempt north's or east's hands|pg||
mb|4N|nt|by: Oh boy, this is ripe for a potential disasterous misunderstanding by the unfamiliar EW partnership|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes.  Unless specifically discussed, I wouln't take west's hand as looking for a save.|pg||
nt|othered1: west's bid, rather.|pg||
nt|bucheister: I am surprised that W did not just bid 5C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: but 4@S was available, so there may be some inferences to the contrary.|pg||
nt|by: Most would understand 5@c as P/C|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|by: and I think 4N SHOULD be natural|pg||
nt|othered1: Right.  And 4N would be showing stoppers.|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|by: I mean partner says: I'd like to play 3N if you have stopper, you say ok, I have stopper and would like to play 4N, no one would ever think otherwise|pg||

nt|othered1: might north be thinking of correcting to @S?|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||

mb|2C|mb|3H|nt|othered1: some of us might try 11H with the east hand.|pg||

mb|p|nt|by: I haven't followed tournament bridge much for 10 years, but I thought standard US practice is that X and bid is 18+ nowadays|pg||
nt|bucheister: Varies from player to player|pg||
nt|by: surely the E hand qualifies and the W hand should raise, as for this table, E is old-fashioned and 2@H would only show 16+|pg||
nt|othered1: Pretty much, except for a few of us, influenced by Kaplan and Kokish, who don't put many limits on overcall.|pg||
nt|bucheister: If you make very light overcalls you could not make just an overcall with this hand|pg||
nt|by: so W decides that he would boost a little bit .. should be great for this hand|pg||
nt|othered1: don't get me wrong, I'd raise on west's hand without second thought|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|othered1: You don't see much traditional Precision in high level play in the USA anymore.  But it is a sound system, just not as popular as it once was.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bucheister: But this is not the USA|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|by: I am sorry to say that Precision is not popular in taiwan as it once was|pg||
nt|by: It used to be that the precisioneers played colorful preempts on the two level|pg||
nt|by: with the increasing legislation of the WBF against variety in systems, people went back to more traditional systems|pg||
nt|othered1: True.  My point was that the system continues to be good enough to be competitive at high levels, like this.|pg||
nt|bucheister: How many would preempt with the W hand in first seat?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|by: I don't know, I am afraid many of taiwan's juniors (the junior trials are held alongside, same length, same boards) would preempt|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Preempt with the west hand?  I'd use it as an example of not to preempt for a number of classical reasons.|pg||

nt|by: It appears that there was a sort of confusion|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|by: W intending to blackwood, E (correctly) thinks that it is quantitative|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|bucheister: Alls well that ends well; E must have interpreted as quantitative|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree. In most approaches, especially of a 4-level transfer was available, 4N would b equantitative.|pg||
nt|by: no harm done but they will lose 1 IMP to 6@h+1|pg||

mb|2D!|an|one major|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|othered1: 6@C or 6N by west are very good|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|jbgood: kibs ask me who are winning.. I really want an answer to that question myself:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I guess 7@C can work, but not a good spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @C setting trump suit now?|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|mr murray: strange no method to get other hand to play it. most of time it would be beneficial.|pg||
