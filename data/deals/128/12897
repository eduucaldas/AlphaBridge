nt|rodal f: For me the 3@S was a bit concervative. If pard have the cards u still are..... If opps have them u give them line|pg||
nt|mrdct:  5@D only has 2 losers on the face of it - but 11 tricks will be hard tocome by|pg||
nt|chick: 5@D shows hearts also, so that E could correct if not like diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S would not have stopped West. He would bid 4NT, two places to play, and pull 5@C to 5@D to show the red suits. So same thing|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: in the tank|pg||
nt|mrdct:  west wishes he had slightly better @d pips in dummy|pg||

nt|athene: QJ109 is much better even though they are both two tricks - because when you have the second holding, opps might be hoping for no trump losers |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|athene: but tony forrester in a newspaper column the other day made a good point about lead decisions like that - if you are going to beat a freely bid game you need the cards to lie ...|pg||

mb|4S|nt|peachy: 4S too expensive, dbldummy, but in practice prob just 1 down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi Dave:)|pg||
nt|mrdct:  4@S can go -2 if east gets a D ruff|pg||
pc|hK|nt|peachy: i guess thats where EW bravery stopped, no Dbl. Perhapsthey thought they were sacrificing|pg||
nt|mrdct:  looks like he'll lose 2@d, 1@c and 1@S now - which is a good result for NS|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still itseems as 4@H are one|pg||
nt|peachy: indeed, the dbldummy defense near impossible to fing|pg||
nt|peachy: *find|pg||
nt|mrdct:  3 members of the goren team are from teh current australian under 26 team|pg||
nt|mrdct:  and those three people (Adam Edgtton, Nabil Edgtton and Andy Hung) are coming off a very strong performance in the recent National Open Teams|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Probably around 28C there now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 am|pg||
nt|mrdct:  is there a chnace that south will run out of trumps and go -2 here?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway. This board can't become a minus for EW. I belive.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: in the tank|pg||
nt|peachy: fir those (like myself) who dont know exactly where Gold Coast is http://www.lonelyplanet.com/maps/pacific/australia/|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|chick: hehe I just looked up a map too, seems like a real nice area :)|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i think south needs to go for @D before @C to avoid being tapped|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: yes, miles of gotgeous beaches|pg||

pc|c7|nt|kit: I hate this use of 3@D as limit raise -- now North has heard his partner double (or, in this case not double) 3@D and this helps him on lead|pg||

nt|hlortz: yes since 3@D limit, if 3@C is used as a weaker raise then X is usually takeout of the major rather than lead director|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hQ|mc|10|nt|kit: I like the double to always be lead-directing|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Back in about 10 -15 minutes|pg||
nt|athene: a good LTT hand - EW make ten in their 55 fit, and NS would have made 9 in their 6-3 fit|pg||
nt|athene: move the @DK, and 4@H is going down but 4@S is then making|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: next session still around 10 mins as play stil going on other table|pg||
