nt|jbgood: is with the first 16 counted and given a match result|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mr murray: he is thinking that chun has shown extras. He might be sorry.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hantveit: except on blw. The broders using a, for me, strange system where you answer before you have been asked.|pg||
nt|jbgood: Based on the NBF Data results after 8 rounds and the live update scores registered|pg||
nt|panja: they bid a game 11 opp 11...with 13+11, they are bidding a little more carefully|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|panja: 14+11 rather|pg||

nt|jbgood: kan du sjekke om de trenger noen i lukket? her er vi tre |pg||
nt|panja: only 9 top tricks...|pg||
nt|panja: and now with @S 44...there will be a problem|pg||
nt|peachy: West should continue hearts, ten probably, but not sure so easy to see|pg||
nt|peachy: or if I am right|pg||
nt|panja: GIB shows @HT will kill the contract..it will because...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|othered1: This could be a 2-way swing, since 4@D is makable NS if you get @H into play early enough|pg||
nt|imp_jan: easy heart switch|pg||
nt|imp_jan: decl plays low|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and then it's made|pg||
nt|peachy: Gib says yes|pg||
nt|panja: after winning Decl will have to remove trumps..|pg||
nt|panja: but then there will be only 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|panja: say he tries to get his ruff before..by playing a small Club..|pg||
nt|panja: E will win and back a @S...|pg||
nt|bucheister: Hi everyone; I am John Buchheister and will commenting in the Closed Room.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h7|nt|panja: now, S can win @SA, cash @CA, ruff a @C with @SQ pull trumps...but now...he cannot enjoy @H6|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|panja: because @H9 blocks it|pg||
nt|peachy: i think it will be difficult to defend at both tables, regardless of lead|pg||
nt|panja: one kib suggests S drop @H9 under @HK if W played @HT..|pg||
nt|panja: that will not work either because E, after winning @CQ, will back a @D..|pg||
nt|panja: now...S cannot play a @H to finesse against West's @H85 combination before removing trumps..|pg||
nt|panja: and after removing trumps, he has not entry back to hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: Sidney is still thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: precious little defensive and play gem,  started out as an "easy 4S"|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h9|nt|panja: the hand is not over yet..|pg||

nt|bucheister: standard precision auction; 1C 16+; 1nt 8-12; game|pg||

mb|1S|nt|bigtrain: i'm a michaels-er w/E|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: S counts his diamonds once more|pg||
nt|panja: doubling is not a great option with E hand..|pg||
nt|peachy: I assume E treats this as singlesuiter again|pg||
nt|peachy: aah, it was not a singlesuiter, three options|pg||
nt|panja: but the dbl isn't business here..it is conventional..both Majors or one minor, or a strong hand..|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|mr murray: these guys are bidders. They wont miss any games.|pg||
nt|panja: so...it almost gives up on penalising 1Nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: not a big loss against strong NT, IMO|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: and checking backs of cards  (same deck?)|pg||
nt|peachy: against weak NT, different|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|panja: S has stuck his neck out..|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzce: Lin is thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: very aggressive evaluation by S|pg||

nt|lmeili: if his X means T/O that wii be more clear|pg||
nt|lmeili: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: another interesting bidding sequence|pg||
nt|panja: E should dbl this to show strength...|pg||
nt|panja: and W should remove to 3@S|pg||
nt|lmeili: Lin & Liu are not regular partner, so they might have no agreement on this|pg||
nt|peachy: I think Pass works fine, get the plus that is likely coming|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzce: Liu wrote "3C" on the paper to west|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbgood: difficult contract, if it can ever be made|pg||
nt|rodal f: By 10HP at S. 1NT or 2@S from u Walter by 2/1?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S|pg||
nt|bibanu: 8 tricks |pg||
nt|bucheister: Interesting; no question that 2S is right in MP; what about IMPs; opener if limited to 15hcp; what do you all think|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: YYY|pg||
nt|panja: 2Nt might make..it is not all that bad a contract...had S held @DT, it would be cold|pg||
nt|panja: 3@S also has decent chances of making|pg||
nt|peachy: 3S could slip home|pg||
nt|panja: simply concede a small @H..|pg||

nt|sybarra: can you take a view on @H's?  do you need it?|pg||

nt|sybarra: I think he might try a club|pg||
nt|jbgood: i would think that a club would be his last choice:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but not easy to lead from qxx of hts either |pg||
nt|jbgood: no - a heart return is not easy|pg||
nt|jbgood: but SO is capable of finding it|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess @H is only real chance for defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: if he leads ht,  might he even lead Q|pg||
nt|othered1: Q looks like loser|pg||
