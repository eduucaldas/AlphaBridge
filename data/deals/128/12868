mb|p|nt|peachy: I would tend to agree, in competition weak|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: EW headed for 3NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|nilsland:  thx |pg||

nt|bucheister: Would be a great time to win the J with the A|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe this would be time to win the spade with ace.... since diamond finesse needed into W|pg||
nt|lestergold: we can predict play win cash top dim enter dummy with club take @d fionesse and then west has no chopice but to switch to a heart|pg||
nt|peachy: heh, you gues are faster typists|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|nilsland:  More exciting if East had ventured 3 NT|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|daman: maybe after laying down the @H Ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very strong team. Morath-Flodqvist (Tjolpe), Nilsland-Dahlberg and Bjerregaard-Gullberg. They would have done very well in the Open event I am sure|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now heart ace is not so good|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|daman: anything but a @H|pg||

nt|nilsland:  a chance for the underdogs - 6 @S wasnt bid at the other table|pg||

nt|othered1: Blue Team Club handles 13-17 fairly well.|pg||
nt|mcphee: not easy to reach this slam|pg||
mb|4S|nt|nilsland:  The should be some slam when North cant open :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: A little heavy 4@S imo. 3 controls and 5-card support|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcphee: right, i would not expect so strong a 4@S bid|pg||
nt|othered1: In pure standard bidding, 4@S shows a hand worth an opening bid if @S are known trumps.  Today many play it just showing trump length|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mcphee: W has perfect cards, Q@C rather than q@H things not so sweet|pg||

nt|peachy: indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@h meaning?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|nilsland:  Pity it will not make due to the spade lay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unfortunately the 4-0 trump break dooms it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very unlucky, it's a 95% slam, roughly|pg||
nt|othered1: aThe stiff @D devalues south's hand slightly, but it still has enough extras to push on.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: maybe they will avoid the trap by peeking :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as you can cope with all 4 with West|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The correct play in spades is the queen first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many get that wrong and they never notice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: because it usually does not matter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: ah too quick with his enormolus hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: spade  support, better than 2sp|pg||
pc|c6|nt|nilsland:  You have to learn it "the hard way"|pg||
nt|lestergold: if west has shown a good raise in spades then east should beexploring because his hand becomes enormous|pg||
nt|peachy: if he went to game, might as well have splintered or done something|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|othered1: south will have to push this the rest of the way|pg||
nt|lestergold: lazy sign off basically|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nilsland:  Now  south know the heart ace is missing|pg||
nt|nilsland:  since N didnt cuebid 4 H|pg||
nt|nilsland:  And East will surely lead hearts...|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|nilsland:  man or mouse? Man - it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if north's 4@C control bid was forced or whether it implies slam interest (good trumps are a plus).|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|lestergold: club splinter cant cost|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The fact that the 9 is with AK makes the slam 5% better, from 90 to 95% (half of the 4-0 breaks)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Let's see what Eklund does|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barrling rather|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: I prefer 2nt from W as a very strong invite  and E can jump to 4@c|pg||

mb|p|nt|nilsland:  6 S down one was a flat board but HÃ¥kan StrÃ¤Ã¤f played the spade Queen in the first spade trick :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bucheister: they should get  a bonus|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|othered1: 3@S asks for aces (old-fashioned ACOL and American Standard).  West denies then east cue-bids 4@C and west is obligated to show @H control and you're there.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6@S on 4 was flat, but it's worth noting that in the other room Strääf did cash @SQ first. He has seen it before|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: and i think pushed n/s overboard|pg||

pc|d5|nt|lestergold: north has not got a vestige of a 3@h bid |pg||
nt|peachy: not impossible to make though, if guessing the lead is singl|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|othered1: Previous hand emphasizes the need to h ave "metaagreements" on handling 2-suited overcalls, so you  have some basis for action if one pops up against you.  A much better use of ...|pg||
nt|othered1: your time than concocting schemes to find third round controls on high minor suit auctions, etc.|pg||

nt|mcphee: so our first hand begins with a slam to n/s which will easily be reached I expcet|pg||
nt|nilsland:  a grand slam even|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What's wrong with a grand slam, Bob?|pg||
mb|1S!|an|4+!S may hold longer !C|nt|mcphee: no Q?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But they have 10 between them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then you don't need the queen|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|mcphee: i think not either, but is this a grand they will bid off Q@S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 10 trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|Walddk2: Don't they usually split 2-1?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It depends on if you "know" in the bidding that you have ten trumps|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: South knows|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because 2NT promises 4+|pg||
nt|nilsland:  well let's see if south can make use of that information then|pg||

mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: South knows, and if the auction times out in a way that N bids rkc, south will show the Q for the same reason, as Jeff Roman points out|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: E/W plays strong club, and 1D is 4k M unbal or 11-13NT.|pg||
nt|lestergold: the grand is enormous|pg||
mb|1S|nt|peachy: yes, probably tools available to dind out SQ is missing, but went on with length|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: is there an engldih translation for Torbjorn?|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, Mats!|pg||
nt|nilsland:  hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: and they had better bid it or they will be drowned in then deficit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: looks like Stenberg|pg||
nt|peachy: it is pretty deep already|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: it was a long auction to 7 in the open|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: Mats will tell you all about wriggling if they get doubled in 1NT :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: not bidding the grand would be resignimng time i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: He is the man behind Nilsland's Slinkningar, an escape system when 1NT gets doubled|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|daman: that was a heavy 1@H overcall|pg||
mb|4N|nt|daman: and South found a reason not to raise|pg||
nt|othered1: off shape for a double and wrong for 1N, 1@H looks normal, if you choose to act at all|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|daman: why do you feel it is offshape?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: combined 28 count have to bid well to reach the grand|pg||

mb|6S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: perfecto no wasted hands fit like hand and glove|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: After GF spade raise, S has all suits sontrolled first or second round. Even if N hadn't South still would|pg||
nt|lestergold: well another 13 imps into the bottomless pit|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but they still have tio be confident of 13 tricks controls are only part of the story|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: the first part, yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: first three bids same in open room then the auctions took different directions|pg||
nt|lestergold: and sadly  a differfent destination|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|othered1: OK, perhaps sub-optimal shape for a double|pg||

nt|lestergold: thios is where you pray that west is the one to show out on the spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: We do not live in an ideal world. You've got to bid the cards you are dealt|pg||
