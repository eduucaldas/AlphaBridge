nt|Walddk2: East must return a trump and then West will get squeezed. And if he doesn't play a spade, declarer has 10 on cross-ruff|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|hantveit: except on blw. The broders using a, for me, strange system where you answer before you have been asked.|pg||
nt|jbgood: Based on the NBF Data results after 8 rounds and the live update scores registered|pg||

nt|panja: only 9 top tricks...|pg||

nt|peachy: West should continue hearts, ten probably, but not sure so easy to see|pg||
nt|peachy: or if I am right|pg||
nt|panja: GIB shows @HT will kill the contract..it will because...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: This could be a 2-way swing, since 4@D is makable NS if you get @H into play early enough|pg||
nt|imp_jan: easy heart switch|pg||
nt|imp_jan: decl plays low|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and then it's made|pg||
nt|peachy: Gib says yes|pg||
nt|panja: after winning Decl will have to remove trumps..|pg||
nt|panja: but then there will be only 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|panja: say he tries to get his ruff before..by playing a small Club..|pg||
nt|panja: E will win and back a @S...|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|panja: now, S can win @SA, cash @CA, ruff a @C with @SQ pull trumps...but now...he cannot enjoy @H6|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|panja: because @H9 blocks it|pg||
nt|peachy: i think it will be difficult to defend at both tables, regardless of lead|pg||
nt|panja: one kib suggests S drop @H9 under @HK if W played @HT..|pg||
nt|panja: that will not work either because E, after winning @CQ, will back a @D..|pg||
nt|panja: now...S cannot play a @H to finesse against West's @H85 combination before removing trumps..|pg||
nt|panja: and after removing trumps, he has not entry back to hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: Sidney is still thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: precious little defensive and play gem,  started out as an "easy 4S"|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|panja: the hand is not over yet..|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: what does one do with the North hand ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: i say Pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: I pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  pass for me but the modern style appears to be double|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but will bid 1 nt with @Sa10x|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: Wei De picked up 12 IMPs on Bd 7 as 4@S made - NS failed to lead trumps|pg||
nt|pitiful:  would anybody do anything with the east hand|pg||
nt|pitiful:  either directly or when 2@c cones back to them|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sharkey: Only bid I wud consider wud be 1 NT - but vs Vul Pass and defend is an option|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: pass immediately and dbl at balancing position|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: N's Dbl implies @H suit so why bid...|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: becos the danger of the @H shift maybe best to take the 1st @S|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: shd end up in 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning|pg||
mb|2N|an|!S|nt|sunsamvar: only a low @C lead or shift will give problems to that contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Zen Ho has to pick up 49 IMPs - this may be reflected on the bridge we are about to see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Patrick Huang, the living legend of Asian bridge|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: Good morning Roland|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|nt|sunsamvar: i still think North shd have bid 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My guess is that 2NT was feature ask, and that 3@D shows a little something in diamonds, and not a min hand. But only a guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: 3@D means max and honor in @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exactly|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Three schools of thought regarding 2NT over 2M: 1. Feature? - 2. Singleton? - 3. Strength and suit quality? I don't have strong feelings. Do you?|pg||

nt|sharkey: I like feature & max - like NS use|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|sunsamvar: i play 2nt to ask for lenght and 3@C to ask for singleton... so covering 2|pg||
