nt|petergill: Welcome back|pg||
nt|petergill: the hands are from the previous 16 boards|pg||
nt|sporteye: Hi Peter, Hi Henry|pg||
nt|petergill: so the table will have to be shut down and re-started, I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: This hand was in the first 16 boards|pg||
nt|petergill: West played in 1NT on a spade lead about 2 hours ago|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Ed, welcome everyone to a set of Crunch|pg||

nt|mamos:  hi yonaton  Good luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: now unless the CR overtakes us again we should have comparisons|pg||

nt|henryb:  like a bad penny I too show up again.Hi Peter|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Gary :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=9-18 HCP, 4+@S, unbal, maybe longer @C/@D, maybe 4@H|pg||
nt|itinerant: 1S in third seat = 9-18pts, 4+ spades|pg||

nt|pamela: hi Gary |pg||
nt|itinerant: ah, has everyone got that?|pg||
nt|pamela: and SHirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: The pace in the CR is glacial.  They are now starting 18.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: describe the other holdings on the next round:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Pamela welcome|pg||
nt|pamela: are we in for a bumpy ride  :-) |pg||
nt|itinerant: 2H = 3-6pts, 3+ spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you adjust in canape to play penalty X's?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hold on should be fun, great youth players vs experienced pros|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pamela: when did Michael Ware move to Aussie|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Ed and Al hoping for big things from EW this set|pg||
nt|mdgraham: second that|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: hi tez, his specs|pg||
nt|peachy: hi*|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Raija and Tez|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|tez: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|pamela: oh lol ok|pg||
nt|itinerant: 3 kiwis by birth at this table|pg||
nt|itinerant: Brightling has been in Oz an awfully long time|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: probably before EW born :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: howdy all|pg||
mb|2S|nt|itinerant: Hard to find a club lead from west against a spade contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|itinerant: he's still living in NZ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not, need to attack|pg||
nt|itinerant: If declarer can see through the backs of the cards, he can make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pard has bid them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: red suits too slow|pg||
nt|itinerant: Hi Marshall|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: plus you would have to guess which red suit to lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: go Liam :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kiwibridge: fingers crossed J|pg||
nt|tez: dbl shows 3 card @h|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW may end up in a @S partial - looks like 9 tricks with the friendly layout|pg||
nt|mamos:  and card lie fairly well|pg||
pc|s9|nt|itinerant: well, hello @cK|pg||
nt|mamos:  EW hands fit well together|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S showed both majors or both minors. there are some advantages to such bids but several downsides too|pg||
nt|itinerant: hard to control the trump situation in this contract|pg||
nt|itinerant: it would seem the defence needs to attack diamonds sooner rather than later|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he lived in Hong Kong for a few years, his wife Mary-Ellen qualified to play for HK ladies|pg||
nt|sybarra: the taps in the @D may kill this (if they can find it fast enough)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|peachy: I am not sure what sys EW have, yesterday I thought it was Polish club, anyone?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|peachy: this should make in comfort|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they moved back to NZ where he resumed his status as our leading player|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugrapha2: sorry aout that, had to leave the table momentarily|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have WBF Convention Cards for both pairs -- NS from 2009 Bermuda Bowl, EW from 2009 U26 PABF|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|pamela: matt will play 9 S |pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: one of the latter is that when you have this gizmo in your toybox you want to use it whenever possible so you brandish it when 65 in the minors and run substantial risk of playing ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the wrong suit, sometimes doubled. the lower of the two suits should be at least as long as the higher suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even without the double it would (or should) be a strong candidate for opening lead|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|kiwibridge: we have a 31 deficit with 32 to play|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: "we"?   both teams have current or expat Kiwis|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c8|nt|kiwibridge: we the viewers|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is, when you are 65 instead of 56|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even beyond that, a weak 2S is a much commoner hand type and a more effective preempt. you can combine this here toy with multi of course, but then you have to batch in all ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strengths of weak 2s, so the partner of the multi bidder has to guess a lot|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: everyone is just taking a 5 min break|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: oh -- you mean  us|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yep|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: excellent pin|pg||
nt|sybarra: been suggested this can make with  7trumps 2@C +1@S|pg||
nt|mwigor: hi all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to be a question of which down 1 Nabil takes|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|c6|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: sorry -- i haven't had dinner -- or a coke in over 3 hours|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: poor you what do you do between sessions Al :)|pg||
nt|itinerant: though we feel your pain, al, we respectfully note that these are 1st world concerns :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hunger should be the world's first concern|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it is for me|pg||
nt|itinerant: not sure that the UN should do a drop at al's place though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i just realized -- last set was blurry not because of fatigue -- wearing wrong glasses|pg||
nt|marlowepi: somebody bid to game quick or specs will throw tomatoes at us|pg||
nt|itinerant: He's definitely suffering malnutrition and decaffeination... 911|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that made me smile|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|itinerant: The Milne team has an average age of 21yrs, and that includes alex Smirnov who is 27!|pg||
nt|poohbear: If he had tried drawing trumps He would succeed if @ds were blocked or trumps 3-3. Might have been a better line|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|c5|pc|sJ|pg||

mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: This is a good hand for transfer advances. 2@D = hearts, then support spades later. I think this is just a sound spade raise, though|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Transfer advances also known as USP, Useful Space Principle|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: But this NS pair does not play them|pg||
nt|patricck: 3@S seems a very conservative action for a vulnerable game by South...only the 4-0 break gives it a problem|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 2 @h (must be a F1) would be ok?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||

pc|c6|pc|d7|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|xenya: he may well make this|pg||
nt|patricck: difficult to take both finesses after cashing K@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 2@H is NF, it's an even better reason to play transfer advances. By doing so you can control the auction later|pg||
nt|po-s: unless he decides to ruff a diamond without drawing a trump|pg||

nt|sharkey: may have a battle here|pg||

mb|1D|nt|jcwla: Light opening here.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We don't think your name is Laura|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Pls edit your profile|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E hand an opener by some standards|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: and usually by youth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: one wonders how many results of that sort -- 500 away against no game, not a rare outcome -- it takes to quell the players' ardor for those methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to be fair, they can bring in the odd bushel too|pg||
nt|itinerant: apparently Meckwell vow to open all balanced 11 counts - Nabil is keen too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you're having trouble counting Milne @C length --- try  counting the other suits, then subtract from 13|pg||
nt|itinerant: this is a conservative bunch, by youth standards|pg||
nt|itinerant: ahem|pg||
nt|itinerant: thanks, liam|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mdgraham: spades will win|pg||
nt|sharkey: a sac over 4@S may turn out expensive|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: Ah, James, welcome|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S hand looks a strong NT to me, i wonder what their range ios|pg||
nt|tez: hi J ames:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he must make up for his much older partner who must be slowing down now that he's all of 27|pg||
nt|pamela: yes  seen better 11's |pg||
nt|marlowepi: LTC is right, versatile in playability, you can open a suit you want led, some preemptive value, some defence....what is not to like?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  looks like strong to me too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S was presumably NF but E has a good hand|pg||
nt|tez: i do not agree with this lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can pin J@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: plus you have the beer card and a reasonable expectation of it taking the last trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant: shows 2344|pg||
nt|itinerant: not sure that it shows 11pts though|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tomi2: hi all from happy Dortmund!|pg||
nt|peachy: hi Thomas|pg||
nt|tez: but he  can recover if plays small next one|pg||
nt|pamela: he's bid those 11 3 times all ready lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite u were Mike|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugrapha2: west is asking for an explanation of the auction so far|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cindy:  very good|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: beer card 7@D|pg||
pc|cK|nt|poohbear: problem with this method is that you cant stop in 2@s anymore|pg||
nt|sybarra: pleasant that spades are 3/3 |pg||
nt|poohbear: when you bid 2nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some use 2@D/2N to say  not 4 other major, not 3 your major, min vs max|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcwla: Good contract.|pg||
nt|poohbear: would be a better method if 2@c was GF|pg||
nt|itinerant: Mercifully for their methods, Alex had no plans to stop at the 2-level this time|pg||
nt|poohbear: though I dont know , Maybe it is|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tez: now in deep trouble..has to figure out his pds shape..|pg||
nt|tomi2: usefull to have agreements what card you play from jtx and jt bare|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|cindy:  hmm|pg||
pc|cA|nt|peachy: he git it right|pg||
nt|tez: not enuf jt9|pg||
nt|peachy: got|pg||
nt|pamela: they arrived in same spot regardless who opened - nice lead |pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  2@D as min fits in with Barry's opportunity to stop in 2@S|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: NS  4th best leads, reverse count & attitude, odd/even 1st discard|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a good case for bidding only 4C. partner will usually save at these colors when it is right to do so, and can let them play 4M when that is right (if they bid it)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is true that he wont know you have the ace of clubs, but you rate to statistiucally and anyway he would not necessarily be counting on that card defensively even if he did know ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: u have it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Thomson 1N=15-18  that might suggest taking it in a notch too -- who knows|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5C will ususally endplay them into just doubling you|pg||
nt|mamos:  declarer probably has more to do than he would like|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: [if only]  soon to be released   The Art of Bidding 8 & 9 Card Suits"|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|poohbear: We will see if declarer ducks and takes a safety play in @s by playing Q and low to the 9 to cater to 5-1 spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: E was done with 3@C and W cudnt offer any contribution|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may be awkward with the spade break - has to ruff a diamond, and on the bidding may place @HK offside|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be forced to take @H finesse|pg||
nt|mamos:  East's best exit is clubbest|pg||
nt|mamos:  ?  Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzfn: thnking|pg||
nt|mdgraham: think East's best shot here is to exit with a club and put declarer on table|pg||
nt|mamos:  i think he'll go off|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree - wont be able to take both @S & @H finesses I think|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mamos:  on a club anyway|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cT|nt|petergill: West is Adam Edgtton|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|s4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has to play @S9 and let it run...|pg||
nt|sharkey: If he does W shud hold the cards closer to his chest...|pg||
nt|mamos:  East's bidding might have given a big clue|pg||
nt|vugraphzfn: you can also watch this table! (i mean actually view,,,,) we have Bridgerama (i think thats how its called...:P) |pg||
nt|sharkey: S knows E has 10 minor suits cards|pg||

nt|vugraphzfn: :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: He has shown 12 cards - 13th a @S or..?|pg||
nt|mamos:  the only thing declarer can be thinking about is the actual layout|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if he gets this right, it will be seriously impressive|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: or just bangs it out|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tomi2: n will need to find some discards now|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: many would disapprove of 2N, preferring 2-suited overcalls to be very strong or else weakish with a high Offense to defense ratio. but 2N protects the spade queen if you defend|pg||
mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: 2D multi, 2N forcing|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 3N works OK here, but 4H could easily be the better spot. N does not have to come up with 55% of his stuff in the black suits|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: McManus just pulled out all the Jacks from his hand and put them down as dummy :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Hi, Gary. :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 6@H 100% isn't it?|pg||
nt|mamos:  West fishing for NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good time to avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|sharkey: W dos not want to hear 4@H, but he may...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or 4@c|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wudnt W bid the same way with 54?|pg||
nt|mamos:  it's a Roland 20-20|pg||
mb|4C|nt|tez: Hxx is important balancing time..bad shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: if West knowsE has 5@H, then this X is misbegotten|pg||
nt|peachy: i'm more concerned about E's pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but no pinochle -- wrong Queen|pg||
nt|pamela: oh lol I thought it was just me that got bumped  was feeling very paranoid.. need to think of some intelligent comments  to stay in the seat I thought .. |pg||
nt|itinerant: There seem to be 2 losing spades to go with 2 aces for -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt it was us Pamela  (given operators comment) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: good save against 3N :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  4@H looks a real possibility|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: this is probably a mild slam try by N, assuming they also play 4 level transfers|pg||
nt|marlowepi: friendly diamond lie makes slam cold|pg||
nt|sharkey: Makes with @C lead?|pg||
nt|mamos:  are EW on the same page of the manual ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any opinions as to whether 3@D should be forcing or not?|pg||
nt|mamos:  I think if you mid 2@S you have to bid again|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|pamela: they  are fearless bidders. .. it is a very competitive in your face style|pg||
nt|sharkey: dont think so - E is headed fo a @H contract I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: he never wants to defend 2@S |pg||
nt|sharkey: Is 2@S forcing or "constructive"?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfn: ronpa had no hassitation,,,|pg||
mb|5H|nt|tejjyid: not much imagination from West there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC doesn't mention either Texas variant|pg||
nt|mdgraham: because if 3@d is nf, West passing it was a distinct possibility|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: "Imagination, that is your creation..."|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but I assume from developments that West doesn't know & doesn't care|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: "don't care was made to care" was what my mother used to say|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: we actually went one entire set last night without a table crash -- it was very bizarre|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and I reckon that just about now West is wishing he had  |pg||
nt|sharkey: Was 2@S alerted as being NF Yonatan?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfn: nope|pg||
nt|mamos:  quite a few "imaginative" bids in this auction|pg||
nt|mamos:  EW just not on same wavelength |pg||
nt|sharkey: no - think I wud have passed 3@D as West...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c5|nt|sharkey: But the play here is more interesting...:)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: slam must be good after 5@C, how man @S can East have?|pg||
nt|itinerant: Another of the defected Kiwis has a well-followed rule: 7-4, bid game|pg||
nt|pamela: which one was that|pg||
nt|itinerant: Stephen Burgess is that rule-maker|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: but a club lead would too, and there are also chances on a H lead, even if Ds dont ruff out|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 2@H was weak must bid 4 now :(|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: did|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will MW mix it up with 3@C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or a bunch of @C's?|pg||
nt|itinerant: as it happens, it takes a trump lead to shoot 5C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|itinerant: a hard thing to lead, looking at KJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure a trump lead holding kj tight is "normal" |pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was good defense, but i think W erred also|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bucheister: I will try to answer kib questions if you have any|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ed - what would 2N mean from south?    I know 3@C nat/nf|pg||
nt|sybarra: or let me say easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: weak stayman followed by 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 card support but look at the rest of Milne's drek -- and worst distribution|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spades are likely to block and if they do you dont have to guess where club ace is|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cindy:  big surprise|pg||
nt|bucheister: I believe that both pairs are playing pretty much standard 2/1|pg||

mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: close|pg||
nt|bucheister: Interesting that W did not respond in hearts with only one bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: opps have already found their fit, so why tell them how good a fit it is? and you may go for Avogadro's number against 420|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: If 3@Hs at N a pass to serve for a possible X? Or?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: the auction is correct|pg||
nt|cindy:  N really stepped out with that 2@s bid|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: sorry we are having technical issues, we should have it sorted out promptly|pg||
nt|pamela: they stay low at the other table in board 6 only in 3Sp|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or you may go for a smaller number as a phantom, as there|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=F1, 10-20 HCP, 4+@H, unbal, maybe longer @C/@D, maybe 5@S4@H(40)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Well - I wud have made 0 - my @S traetment wudnt have been as imaginable...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: *9|pg||
nt|mamos:  I t's a fair question :)   especially as I dont know their system is it 2/1  if not 2@C  and then 2@S shows the values   this is often verrrry weak|pg||
mb|2D!|an|4+|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: here's a biggie|pg||
nt|itinerant: with an overcall here, double showed 4+ spades in 2008, i wonder if it still does?|pg||
nt|itinerant: 1H was simply 10+ relay|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tez: 6@d is ok..but hard to find|pg||
nt|peachy: Tez, Thomas, kibs, thank you everyone, been a pleasure. I need to go but back in few hours  |pg||
nt|tomi2: thx :)|pg||
nt|pamela: shows 3 H though?|pg||
nt|itinerant: any hand, 10+ for the relay bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: ty raija:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = @H & @S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|itinerant: very tempting for ware to pass this, lookign at the vulnerability|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: any danger of getting too high?|pg||
nt|itinerant: voila|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - if 2/1 wud bid (semi) forcing 1 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: But unfriendly layout.|pg||
nt|itinerant: ... for rescue|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S does enough -- it strongly suggests a save & pd will do so when right. same theme we saw before|pg||
mb|4C|nt|tez: and 6 nt|pg||
nt|bucheister: South could have helped on this hand by ducking the diamond Q; North would know the story better and might play the heart 8|pg||
nt|itinerant: "help me!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S crowds them enough |pg||
nt|ahollan1: even Larry Cohen might have allowed for a reduction in Total Trick count|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Milne got 6 back on the 4@SX|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont think 2/1|pg||
mb|4H|nt|tez: 1@d 1@s 2@h 3@d...my line|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: A coffee hand; pretty standard|pg||
nt|marlowepi: quite generally, when the opps have already located their fit the strategic value of preemption diminishes|pg||
mb|4N|nt|pamela: yes they were just in 3sp|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: perhaps he shouldn't X, nice fit now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  4@C much better|pg||
nt|sharkey: Comes down to @D guess in slam|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|itinerant: Oddly, they're still in relay here|pg||
nt|itinerant: oops|pg||
mb|6S|nt|ahollan1: ummmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: indeed hmm|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pamela: this cannot be right surely|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: it is they are in 2@D |pg||
nt|itinerant: ware intended his pass as another relay and Mcmanus did not|pg||
nt|itinerant: I'll trawl the notes and find out who to blame!|pg||
nt|pamela: ahh  . thanks |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Pascale, right on the ball as usual :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: one of our best operators :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib advises they do play 2/1 - must have different traetment then|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice 4@h splinter jump next door|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: sure is|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: that hand should follow the Law of Total Dreck|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharkey: N wud trade his @HAK and dummy's @DJ for @DQ...|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|tomi2: youre still off an ace and @Dq|pg||
nt|ahollan1: quote of the day:   they shouldnt play forcing pass in the passout seat :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|tez: yes..we will play 3 nt usualy:)|pg||
nt|bucheister: Notice the Walsh influence in the rebid of 1NT rather than 1S over the diamond response|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: nice Al|pg||
nt|pamela: lol|pg||
nt|pamela: I will borrow that one day|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: up there with Kaplans "take out doubles are to be taken out"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: came from a spec|pg||
nt|sybarra: its a great line!  |pg||
nt|sybarra: we owe the spec|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1 over on 7 imp to De Livera|pg||
pc|h8|nt|itinerant: leaving 2 heart losers in the end game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Milne already has unfair advantage -- youth AND they've played 32 boards less than DeLivera|pg||
nt|itinerant: Delivera going -100 on board 8 in the open room - looks like 11 imps for Delivera|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Sorry they did double the contract - i just compleatly missed the X|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but don't forget they played a extra week before this started|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|itinerant: so, "we don't play relay if we're up two steps". mcmanus's usual response to 1H, to show spades, would be 2C, ware relays with 2D. so they are up 0 steps at the point where nabil ...|pg||
nt|itinerant: bid 2D and ware passed|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this one could be a double swing to Milne|pg||
pc|cA|nt|itinerant: spade shift required here?|pg||

pc|h9|pg||

nt|Walddk2: This would be made at 15 out of 16 tables in the MBC on BBO. West would rise, fearing that he/she would never score if if he/she didn't|pg||

mb|p|nt|tomi2: S might likely overbid this now to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and 10 imp pickup on 5 @Cx making|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C NOT game forcing|pg||
nt|sharkey: So Team Birman has taken the lead|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: Hi Avram|pg||
pc|s2|nt|itinerant: 3 trumps, 2 hearts and a spade to lose on top, but there will be more...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a bit surprised McManus didn't RDBL initially to show 2-suite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if i read notes correctly that is part of "Wine" after 1N-(DBL)|pg||
nt|pamela: yes even with the poor break in hearts would feel a little more comfortable  to find the H fit|pg||
nt|itinerant: he would have to pass, forcing a XX, to show 2 suits. XX initially would have been values|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: 2N NF|pg||

nt|bucheister: Sort of a mixed raise by W|pg||
