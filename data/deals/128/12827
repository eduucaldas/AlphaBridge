mb|p|mb|p|nt|hantveit: except on blw. The broders using a, for me, strange system where you answer before you have been asked.|pg||
nt|jbgood: Based on the NBF Data results after 8 rounds and the live update scores registered|pg||

nt|panja: only 9 top tricks...|pg||
nt|panja: and now with @S 44...there will be a problem|pg||
nt|peachy: West should continue hearts, ten probably, but not sure so easy to see|pg||
nt|peachy: or if I am right|pg||
nt|panja: GIB shows @HT will kill the contract..it will because...|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|othered1: This could be a 2-way swing, since 4@D is makable NS if you get @H into play early enough|pg||
nt|imp_jan: easy heart switch|pg||
nt|imp_jan: decl plays low|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and then it's made|pg||
nt|peachy: Gib says yes|pg||
nt|panja: after winning Decl will have to remove trumps..|pg||
nt|panja: but then there will be only 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|panja: say he tries to get his ruff before..by playing a small Club..|pg||
nt|panja: E will win and back a @S...|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|panja: now, S can win @SA, cash @CA, ruff a @C with @SQ pull trumps...but now...he cannot enjoy @H6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|panja: because @H9 blocks it|pg||
nt|peachy: i think it will be difficult to defend at both tables, regardless of lead|pg||
nt|panja: one kib suggests S drop @H9 under @HK if W played @HT..|pg||
nt|panja: that will not work either because E, after winning @CQ, will back a @D..|pg||
nt|panja: now...S cannot play a @H to finesse against West's @H85 combination before removing trumps..|pg||
nt|panja: and after removing trumps, he has not entry back to hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: Sidney is still thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: precious little defensive and play gem,  started out as an "easy 4S"|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
