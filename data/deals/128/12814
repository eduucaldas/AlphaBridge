nt|othered1: Will east apply "the law" and raise?|pg||
nt|sybarra: a spec suggested 3 nt .....but not sure you can handle even with @D lead |pg||
nt|jbgood: too soft values for a weak jump|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ctcbabbo: hi all|pg||
mb|d|nt|qing: if w is 4-4-2-3, declarer could ruff 2@H and cash all winners, the last losing @D loses to master trump|pg||
nt|ctcbabbo: hello all:this is the final game of Chinese Taipei|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|by: This is the finals of CHinese Taipei Contract Bridge Association trials to select Taiwan's Open team for the year|pg||
mb|5H|nt|by: [CTCBA is the country's official bridge association], Mr. Chen Yeh is one of bridge's most famous sponsors|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|by: known for Yeh Bros Cup, playing with his usual partner of recent.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|by: Patrick Huang is a great name from since 1969|pg||
nt|qing: here S faces some tactical decisions, he doesn't know that EW's limit is 6@C|pg||
mb|6H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|by: Jed Wang is a previous Junior international who now alternates with Prof. Sidney Yang as Patrick's partner, playing a rather old-fashioned version of precision|pg||
nt|ctcbabbo: a good contract for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|qing: from his point of view, save over 6@C is pretty straight forward, the question is will EW have a cold 7@S?|pg||
nt|by: Yeh and Shih uses a simple natural system.  Mr. Yeh likes to bid and here they are in par contract|pg||
nt|ctcbabbo: but the super scorce is 6S -1|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ctcbabbo: so this board is good for NS or EW is not sure|pg||

nt|lmeili: 2@s by S supposed|pg||
mb|4C|an|P/C|mb|d|mb|4H|nt|othered1: 6@C or 6N by west are very good|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can 6@H be a good score?|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: 2@D seems not multi|pg||
nt|lmeili: i guessed so, will be M's|pg||
nt|rodal f: 6@C is on but find it|pg||
nt|lmeili: S has no reason to bid 4@c if p has @h pre|pg||
nt|rodal f: As 6@D|pg||
nt|lmeili: 2@d= 6@h or @s + m|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jbgood: kibs ask me who are winning.. I really want an answer to that question myself:)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|othered1: I guess 7@C can work, but not a good spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @C setting trump suit now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|mr murray: strange no method to get other hand to play it. most of time it would be beneficial.|pg||
