nt|ahollan1: Chris Willenken's 2@C was artificial Game Force -- the club length is just coincidental|pg||
nt|mariner1: so they use it like a tell me more type call it seems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: relays and responses follow - so we won't try to guess|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: suspect eventually stay in 5@S because 1 key card and trump queen missing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think both pairs in the other room use very standard bidding so system swings will come from this table|pg||
nt|mariner1: well will they bid the close slam?|pg||
nt|mariner1: find the Q@C off side is a key|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: no @H lead also helps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: as said -- off a key card AND trump q = 5@S final contract |pg||

nt|mariner1: same, add points and spades to get to 15 to open|pg||
nt|mariner1: so  a support REDBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Rob phrase better -- note to make, since Support DBL/RDBL originally invented for use in context of Strong Club system - some 2/1 players play support DBL but NOT support ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 83 Moss gained 10 back as the @S game was not found|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|mariner1: I was thinking they might find the A@C lead to beat 4....... no chance though on 83|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: the idea is that in context of big club - opener never holds strong hand, but in 2/1 maybe big hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: S in a fix here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cohen not opening has really made things difficult for Pollack|pg||
