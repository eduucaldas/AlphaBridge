nt|inquiry: ================== Board 47 ====================|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: We'll be starting momentarily - will enter scores from 46 & 47 in the movie and then have live coverage from then on|pg||
nt|inquiry: I know Bramley and wold play precision, I am not sure what system Shi and Yang use, but we will soon discover.... |pg||
nt|bridge_one: if A in @D in South probably A in @C in North, so the line is the best|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Pretty fair bench players|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: down 1 on Bd 31|pg||
nt|xenya: ok. a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: maybe deserve the full -10|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl at 4@H means any value in N|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: very heavy 1NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sater1957:  4@S might be bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: do NS have a gadget showing minors?|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 61-67 now|pg||
nt|xenya: this might be interesting...|pg||
mb|p|nt|dcbutler: the winner of this match will advance to the round of 8; the loser joins the USA2 field (in the round of 32, i believe|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: the late cansino had a method for dealing with hands like west's|pg||
nt|barnets: ew do better in hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: spades is not a happy contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: sounds like that gilbert an sullivan song|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: However, the auction is not over|pg||
nt|barnets: it is now|pg||
nt|sssvablue: I type too sloooow|pg||
nt|barnets: north has 10 hcp|pg||
nt|xenya: N opens 1@S, and E is forced to pass? |pg||
nt|dcbutler: 6D is cold EW, but how do they get there?|pg||
nt|xenya: N will have to find a brilliant @H lead to set 3N|pg||
mb|3S|nt|frankaus: 41s only seems to have 9 tricks without some help from the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the lead wont hurt|pg||
nt|barnets: it looks like a very weak nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: seems like 4 losers|pg||
nt|sssvablue: 2@c 1@d 1@s|pg||
nt|jbgood: 10 imps for cpatain Melih|pg||
nt|jbgood: captain even|pg||
nt|dcbutler: he might find that if they stop there; i doubt it|pg||
mb|4D|nt|xenya: but E will try for a @D contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 4@D presumably shows 6-5 -- if 2N is minors|pg||
nt|xenya: which it must be|pg||
nt|dcbutler: in the open room, W opened 3D, and E drove to slam|pg||
nt|xenya: now perhpas E can just blast slam?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|barnets: two hold it to 2 spade losers he must lead low to the  8|pg||
nt|dcbutler: just bidding 6 makes sense to me |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Judy Bramley and JoAnn Sprung|pg||
nt|onebid: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|onebid: And nice playing JoAnn:)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Yes, congrats JoAnn!|pg||
nt|barnets: or play the 10|pg||
nt|barnets: from dummy|pg||
nt|barnets: if he palys low to the Q he has 3 spade losers|pg||
mb|4N|nt|barnets: if he plays the @s10 it goes J QK|pg||
nt|hlortz: should come to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jbgood: sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|nt|Walddk7: Good evening to Jeff Sapire|pg||
nt|milton_se: should make now -- 5th diamond as 8th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: Hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: with north on  a blind lead i think that dims was abetter shot on the grounds that its more likely to hit an honour in pard'shand against a low level contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: without costing unlike the disastrous heart lead|pg||
mb|6D|nt|Vugraphu7: result is entered for Bd 31...still having problems|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Hi Jeff :)|pg||
nt|fann4: Hi Giorgio:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: checking for @D honours? -- looks sensible|pg||
nt|dcbutler: yes, a lot of work for a push|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sssvablue: In the other room, inexplicably North played low when west played a club towards dummy|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|fann4: Be back in 5mts.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|truffle: thanks:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: now west in the very happy position of being able to affiord to lose 2 trump tricks if necessary|pg||
nt|lestergold: (he wont get hearts wrong|pg||
nt|barnets: not best|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence here has been very friendly|pg||
nt|barnets: if the defense play two spades all they will make is two spade tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|milton_se: -- or South has to give a H or C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: localization of honors in South give sure way to make the contract, and also gain one trick more|pg||
mc|12|nt|sssvablue: That will be that|pg||
nt|milton_se: Boyd sees it coming|pg||
nt|milton_se: but does Strul?|pg||

nt|mrs q: this is an intersting deal|pg||

nt|sssvablue: cards were marked|pg||
nt|sssvablue: low heart lead from north|pg||

nt|vbman: hi glen|pg||

nt|dcbutler: hi jon and jim|pg||
nt|xenya: and Jon|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bridge_one: yes, playing @D the contract was safe|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lead and play to the first trick virtually placed the heart cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: wronk|pg||
nt|frankaus: wrong even|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sssvablue: west looking for a reason not to lead @H|pg||

nt|glen: hi Kursat :)|pg||
nt|inquiry: 7@H, 1@C, 1@D, 3@S ruffs. ... more fun to bid than play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: elegant bid by East|pg||
nt|lestergold: only layout to play for at the end|pg||
nt|barnets: in fact had he played the HQ north still had a spade and a diamond left|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: many respind 1@S with South - but I much prefer 2@C|pg||
nt|glen: Q from spec: why 3@D, and not 3@S - i expect S assumed they would not buy hand, so wanted to get lead director in|pg||
nt|lestergold: he knew that playing a club was misere|pg||
nt|sssvablue: I would think this double shows clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: which were two tricks and I believe the defense had 4|pg||
nt|barnets: already|pg||

nt|bridge_one: open room 3@S+1     in this hand isn't difficult to make 4, it is difficult to call game !|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|onebid: North knows pard 6-5, but 4@H seems a bit much|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm 3d looks cold but 3s makes as well|pg||

nt|jbgood: did he think he was to bad for a leaping Michael's - or were NS in lavk of that toy?|pg||
nt|hlortz: strike even|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: because he may want a diamond lead|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I'm not keen on those off shape NT openers, but if it fits the range |pg||
mb|3N|nt|onebid: what does Oz think now?|pg||
nt|onebid: it may have been better to bid spades the first time|pg||
nt|inquiry: Looks like Melih and Mark can make 4@S and 4@H but this auction has made it|pg||
nt|inquiry: very difficult to get into the bidding...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: studying Lewis cc|pg||
nt|glen: some form of puppet stayman here|pg||
nt|vbman: need good brakes here|pg||
nt|chick: kinda depends on what the X showed|pg||
nt|jbgood: keyboard still cold - too and lack ...|pg||
nt|hlortz: 2n to muddy the waters|pg||
nt|jbgood: you gain nothing when the opps have a good fit - better jump to the level you feel is aprropriate|pg||
nt|sater1957:  North too strong now for 4@s|pg||
nt|sater1957:  give PD 2 Aces and Q of S and 6S is ciold|pg||
nt|jbgood: not sure - prd has a passed hand... |pg||
nt|jbgood: my prd NEVER has a perfect hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fann4: No action by S in the OR, a bit surprising.|pg||
nt|fann4: N must be tempted to bid 2@D, but it is vul|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S by south is a risk - np plauing MP, but in IMP can be dangerous|pg||
nt|barnets: x was standard takeout|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3s forcing i assume|pg||
nt|sater1957:  but 5@s still safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: 5@D a good sac|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: Mark thinks 3@d=Majors|pg||
nt|vbman: a dbl may help here|pg||
nt|fann4: Either way they will be in a 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|milton_se: this is the par contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s probably going off|pg||
nt|barnets: see if south leads a@D|pg||
nt|jbgood: problem is that S has his bid - and 5 may be in jeopardy.. a big risk going on|pg||
nt|hlortz: well they will survive the 5 level with @S 2-2|pg||
nt|jlrice: after W opened the auction at the other table they were able to pinpoint the heart problem they had |pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: now has to switch to that pesky dim|pg||
nt|sssvablue: will now shift to one most likely|pg||
nt|lestergold: and then its off without the option|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n probably rolls in of course|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This is not the type of board Jacobs wants|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|onebid: a pass by Linda was the winner?|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sssvablue: No better way to start the day, cold pizza and beer, the breakfast of champions|pg||
nt|onebid: slow action|pg||
nt|inquiry: If Oz bid game, 5@D is a better save over a major game than 5@C, because a|pg||
nt|inquiry: diamond ruff is available in clubs..|pg||
nt|onebid: true, but not relevant|pg||
nt|inquiry: well, linda knows paul has to be very weak to pass 3@C I think, so she might|pg||
nt|inquiry: well save if they find the game|pg||
nt|onebid: while we wait - Federer cruising in French Open|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: 1 keycard|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: no -- 33 imps to win back with 12 boards left|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk4: How do you like the psyche in the other room|pg||
nt|jbgood: the contract in the OR is really something:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: I love it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mark Lair (West) heard 2 weak hearts from his partner and psyched 4@S next. Wonderful!|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|milton_se: certainly, but South will anyhow be forced to give a H to dummy|pg||
nt|barnets: missed it|pg||

nt|sater1957:  passed all around for -400 or so?|pg||

nt|Vugraphu7: sry, made 4 -- they play 2/1 with lots of special treatments -- the 4@D in the last auction showed no interest in club slam|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|Vugraphu7: 3@D in last showed <5 hearts and <4 spds|pg||
nt|fann4: Interesting bidding in the OR. East bid 4@H and South went on to 4@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 9 tricks in @S , never 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry: Wold will bid something...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: right, thanks|pg||
nt|fann4: Dbl seems far more flexible, though will miss a 5-3 @H fit|pg||
nt|sater1957:  this is 6@d on a non @S lead, but will not be bid|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sssvablue: This was how it went in other room|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree, 3Nt could be the best foe E/W with stop iin @S in South|pg||
nt|milton_se: can W pass?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sssvablue: until the 2@c bid|pg||
nt|frankaus: saved by the |pg||
nt|onebid: vulnerable, Paul decided not to get involved|pg||
mb|2C|nt|onebid: 3@H may have shown longer minor|pg||
nt|glen: it was <5@s and <4@Hs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think West can't pass - or Dbl or 4Nt|pg||
nt|barnets: so in the other room stansby found the @D switch for down1|pg||
nt|barnets: so strul are coming back a bit|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Board 19 is a good result|pg||
nt|jbgood: "Right-handed" |pg||
mb|2H|nt|sater1957:  No miracle lead|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sssvablue: ding dong?|pg||
nt|glen: nice lead|pg||
nt|inquiry: Seems like best lead, prevening spade ruffs is best|pg||
nt|barnets: north is stewart south is woolsey|pg||
nt|sater1957:  gains an IMP, other table presumably low @H lead for 12 trciks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: a very aggressive 2@H by N|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|2hplus4: Maybe he should have started with 1@S if he was going to bid twice|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vbman: good lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade lead will pose problems |pg||
nt|sssvablue: They cashed the Ace of hearts and shifte to a diamond|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|inquiry: the usbf convention card provides no helpon this auction, so one has to believe|pg||
nt|inquiry: ones eyes. if they bid six hearts it will take a club lead to beat it, but paul has|pg||
nt|inquiry: natural spade lead.|pg||
nt|milton_se: NS picking some imps|pg||
nt|jlrice: i dont like the 2H   I would not want to play a 7 card fit with his hand|pg||
nt|jlrice: if i was planning on bidding twice i would definitely start with 1S  so partner could pick between the majors|pg||
pc|d7|nt|onebid: good lead|pg||
nt|fann4: This has not turned out well for EW, but from West's viewpoint it could be a double game swing, or a small loss v a game, or vice versa.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bridge_one: not vuln in IMP 4Nt is normal|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|inquiry: The play should be quick.. 11 tricks now...|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|jlrice: but  i dont think i would bid twice freely at this vul|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fann4: Absolutely|pg||
nt|lestergold: the safe lead lets the contract thru|pg||
nt|dcbutler: i'd do that with another queen - probably just bid one heart would be enough for me|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|fann4: They escaped the axe, but it's still about 6 imps out|pg||
nt|milton_se: would say impossible to pass|pg||

nt|lestergold: on the auction it looked sensible|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

pc|c3|nt|glen: did W call "low @C" or "@C 7" from dummy|pg||

nt|hlortz: a 'routine' 11 tricks...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4H! instead Dbl is technically more precise having one suit hand - But Dbl take the chance to play 3NT also..|pg||
nt|sater1957:  match tied now|pg||
nt|jlrice: they could force to trump again   eventually will set up a second trump trick or spade trick at end|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: Ugly 12 count in South|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: It is the middle of summer in this part of the world.. so we are not particular about the brand :)|pg||
nt|sssvablue: 12 Imps to Struhl on 19|pg||
nt|barnets: the score is 14 only|pg||
nt|lestergold: a close call for south|pg||
mb|1H|nt|frankaus: james boag from tasmania was voted best beer in the world about 3 years ago|pg||
nt|barnets: because of the crash the score is not updated|pg||
nt|jbgood: and now a cold game for NS|pg||
mb|d|nt|glen: good hand for support doubles - double by S says I support your NT ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a bad 9 hell probably invite and it will be declined|pg||
nt|hlortz: well 'cold' on the @S & @D position|pg||
nt|sater1957:  2@d presumably some sort of @H raise|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vbman: support for nt|pg||
nt|glen: N is marked with some @Cs (since didn't bid a major), and thus both players know the takeout double is passable|pg||
nt|vbman: heart j is a good card|pg||
nt|glen: the question is how rich in @C should N be to pass it|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: puppet sequence|pg||
nt|jbgood: transfer?|pg||
nt|xenya: more imps to Ozdil: in OR, NS were even more aggressive than here -- they got to 3@H|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: altho 3n looks as if it has play the dims are very friendly|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: Here also, but we are having a dismal day 60 F (15 C) and rain|pg||
nt|sssvablue: low club will not work well|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sunsamvar: ugly Stan, but it will get them to the makeable game|pg||
nt|frankaus: two aces - but still  only 25 zars so the zar deciples would pass|pg||
nt|sssvablue: unsupported queens and flat distribution|pg||
nt|glen: now will E try a surprise @H play|pg||
nt|chick: wouldn't 2@D show a 4 card major in puppet?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well committed to game now|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: best lead for NS|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: 3N would have worked better|pg||
nt|glen: Q from spec: should N pass the double - imo, with the @C 9, yes, without no|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: 2D showed hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 3 NT by N perhaps the best contract - but 4 @h will also make in comfort|pg||
nt|sater1957:  overtrick, west has no entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: i don't if they use 2 way checkback|pg||
nt|xenya: which quietly went 3 off undoubled|pg||
pc|hK|nt|inquiry: 4@H needed normal hearts split and both finesses working, or a club lead away|pg||
nt|inquiry: from the king. It is not a good game and will fail here. South knows about teh|pg||
nt|inquiry: @DK so expect the @DA lead here|pg||
nt|fann4: I think 2@C here is xyz - a transfer to 2@D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: me too|pg||

pc|hA|nt|inquiry: At this stage with a nice lead, I would have thought pass was right. It is not even|pg||
nt|inquiry: game if it makes, and the undertricks are very profitable|pg||
nt|lestergold: west will never get in to lead a spade thru|pg||
nt|jbgood: I cannot see how he gets rid of his 4th spade - so guess he goes for just making|pg||
nt|sater1957:  you're right|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|barnets: dec set to make 3 @D 3@c 2 @H and a spade|pg||
nt|dcbutler: another board that Jacobs doesn't need|pg||
pc|d4|nt|onebid: not the play we expected|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
nt|chick: Sally Woolsey tells me that 2@D means just no 5 card major-- they have hundreds of puppet sequences for exact distribution (really!)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jbgood: but E should only throw one spade - and the uptrick is there|pg||
nt|sater1957:  now you're wrong again...|pg||

pc|s8|nt|barnets: now a heart back |pg||

nt|barnets: before he has 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is not an easy hand to declare|pg||
nt|chick: nor to defend|pg||
nt|barnets: I think the heart at trick 2 gives def a chance|pg||
nt|lestergold: stewart needs tricks from three suits which order to play them in- i think heart wrong because defenders also have a future in the heart suit|pg||

nt|barnets: had he led diamonds could not break it|pg||

nt|Vugraphu7: Flannery|pg||

nt|2hplus4: EW have escaped the misfit|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|glen: btw, in the top MP lifetime (not including soloway), wold is  3, while Meckstroth needs just more than a year to overtake Soloway|pg||
nt|inquiry: East opening diamond bid is limited to about 15 hcp as they play precision club.|pg||
nt|jbgood: di ace lead in the OR was not a winner - 2 hearts deisappeared from E|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: I don't understand the 2@D rebid.|pg||
nt|lestergold: I am aware that we are watching top champions at play my sons says that the top players are merely bad at the game the rest are terrible|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: shows good hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: the pass|pg||
nt|sater1957:  maximum opening presumably :-)|pg||
mb|d|nt|glen: most of those MPs did not arrive via a big @C|pg||
nt|jbgood: only a @h lead will give E the contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: may happen if N's double showed a @h card|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: couldn't see the explanation of dble|pg||

nt|xenya: E going for the throat now|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This is the type of board they want!|pg||
nt|jlrice: that is a very aggressive X by weinstein  but figures they dont have source of tricks and knows it will be a tight game in point count|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed Jim |pg||
pc|c6|nt|inquiry: tough choice with south. weak hand, misfit. do you take "preference to|pg||

nt|inquiry: well|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: 3/5 leads|pg||
nt|onebid: hearts for me as well|pg||
nt|onebid: Federer serving for match|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I like the double|pg||
nt|dcbutler: and he's behind, looking for a swing|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Not the best lead though|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bridge_one: 2@D is money bridge style - difficult lose 2@D with 7+cards in minors in South - but finding 3 3 1 6 became worst that pass at 1Nt|pg||
nt|xenya: it builds up a @C trick for declarer -- will that be enogh to make?|pg||
nt|jlrice: behind by 35  the double is needed    if they were to make 3N on these cards might be a big minus   and could be a big pickup if they get it 2|pg||
nt|xenya: but the double was very good in my view|pg||
nt|jlrice: Gib says it makes   |pg||
pc|c4|nt|2hplus4: He can strip West's minor cards and perhaps can eventually endplay him|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sater1957:  wash|pg||
nt|jbgood: might have been Either bad Or good, but not good only (imo)|pg||
nt|dcbutler: yes, i agree with the double, especially with the score (he knows they were down 21, and nothing good has happened)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: sorry ... didn't mean that|pg||
nt|xenya: it hardly matters what GIB says: its analysis is on the double-dummy basis |pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: Shi deep in thought|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but Flannery makes the hand double dummy for declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: that's true|pg||
nt|dcbutler: this hand is going to take a while|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|inquiry: Unusual to double opponents who try for game and stop. Wold has reason to|pg||
nt|inquiry: think he can set it, and he can, barely|pg||
nt|glen: other partnerships would play 2@S here as a weak raise, to be able to distinguish between bad and constructive raises|pg||
nt|glen: dummy will be relieved to find the @D K is actually worth something|pg||
nt|glen: if E had @D AQJ for his @D bids, N would have raised to 2@S on a 3-3-3-4 3 count in effect|pg||
nt|jbgood: Gu's double was expensive|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|fann4: Larry Cohen, playing in the other room, would be in full agreement with the Law abiding 3@D bid by N.|pg||
nt|barnets: in the other room martel played a club at trick two and should get home thatway|pg||
nt|jlrice: will try to endplay E in diamonds for 9th trick    but that might not be for 10 min|pg||
nt|2hplus4: if E has @DK what does W have for opener?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|bridge_one: 2@D is usefull also if opps DBL 1Nt finding the fit in @H - bidding 2@D give 5 cards, instead passing 1Nt DBL pass 2@H became impossible to do 5 cards|pg||
nt|milton_se: far too high and Robinson to the lead|pg||
nt|fann4: But EW have now done too much. This hand wasn't about going vul to the 3 level.|pg||

mb|3N|nt|sunsamvar: tough to find a rebid if u dbl the north hand|pg||

nt|2hplus4: This could have been another disaster if he had led a @H|pg||
nt|dcbutler: a heart lead would have let it make; but partner didn't double 3H, which he probably would with an honor|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|barnets: 2n asks partner either to bid a minor or 3C depending on their methods|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|frankaus: this lead will not displease declarer|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and in 4@S there is danger of @C ruff|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Everything about east hand screamed 3nt, flat distribution, points and fillers in minors, secondary heart fit|pg||

nt|Vugraphu7: Levin has called a director|pg||
nt|sater1957:  my guess is that this has to do with whether N promised or denied a @C stopper|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: issue is meaning of 2D after the dble, with respect to clubs|pg||
nt|sater1957:  but why that makes a difference to Levin at this stage is unclear to me|pg||
nt|sater1957:  unless he was seriously thinking of bidding @c again...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: Levin and director have gone out into the hallway|pg||

nt|glen: this S hand looks NT to me, but every hand does that|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sssvablue: in the old days this would be passed out|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n for n/s spades establishable but no entry|pg||
nt|barnets: i need it|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Another flat one surely|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|an|shows 5+|nt|glen: now S would like to show extras and 6@Hs, but not get too high opposite a poor N hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Jack Oest|pg||
nt|joest: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland in 6 of a minor|pg||
mb|2S|nt|glen: settles for the value showing 3@H|pg||
nt|inquiry: slam is easy after this jump, wonder if they could have found hearts if opened|pg||
nt|inquiry: NT (of course they could have found 6NT then)|pg||
nt|glen: after considering possible S hands, N might just RKCB and blast the slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: north reaches for a bid, pulls his hand back and sighs|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: The west hand has little (nothing) to recommend it|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I like these 3 card raises when hand is suitable|pg||
nt|xenya: especially if 1@S promises 5 :)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: The French seem to perform all sorts of distortions to avoid them|pg||
nt|jlrice: in this situation weinstein promises 5   so of course would raise   but if it didnt i would not raise on xxx|pg||
nt|2hplus4: That helps :) But even only promising 4 I raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: playing Flannery|pg||
mb|3D|nt|onebid: Hi Jack|pg||
nt|inquiry: welcome jack|pg||
nt|joest: hi Judy and Ben|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i suppose they play xfert over 1@C, so 1@D=@H and 1@S no majors|pg||
nt|fann4: 3@C in the OR|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 2@D isn't rever - with rever south could use a major (knowing North without 4 cards)|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: only 25 zars so the zar followers pass|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3rd hand .. any small excuse to open|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Oh tzar of the Zar, how many Zar points?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 of a minor looks viable here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|glen: not even RKCB, just blast|pg||
nt|fann4: E was giving serious thought to balancing. |pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: nice bid by Paul|pg||
nt|lestergold: in 6 no one will pick up the qc|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Kit will probably play AK in both minors to keep larry off lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep the safe option|pg||
nt|lestergold: safest|pg||
mb|3S|nt|joest: indeed.  Ozdil goes into the Opening Lead Hall of Fame with a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|frankaus: need 26 zars to open|pg||
nt|glen: and we can get everybody working on the 56 banner|pg||
nt|jlrice: i would rather open W 1N   if the other option was to raise with that spade suit when partner could have 4|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: and then duck a club by S and a small di to flatten the board|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: link - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
nt|joest: I withdraw my prior comment :)|pg||
nt|dcbutler: careful, Roland may hear you - that's the second time you've mentioned that word|pg||

nt|glen: hi :)|pg||
nt|cicus: oh this match seems to have been decide already|pg||
nt|inquiry: now you get your 1@C glenn|pg||
nt|barnets: wel he had the 3 and the 2 was in dummy|pg||
mb|1C|nt|glen: yes, but not much science expected from E|pg||
nt|fann4: So will West overcall, like the OR?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes 4 of spades that how he knopw it was a 7/1 split|pg||
nt|barnets: so unless east had he had 7|pg||
nt|sssvablue: It was nice of them to win 2 imps in the other room on 24 to make the margin 7 and Barnet correct|pg||
nt|lestergold: he had 2 and 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: now that we are connected to other room, you will see that the other players seem to be using different hands:)|pg||
nt|milton_se: and Becker in for another surprise :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes they are certainly the favored pair on paper but that doesnt count on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2/3 of the boards gone - 5 to go|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sssvablue: so 33 for east |pg||
nt|cicus: 1@D 2-suiter? :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: 1@D alerted as Majors or minors|pg||
nt|cicus: NS s cold for 2@S, maybe even 3|pg||
nt|glen: and EW are cold for N's bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@H for E/W |pg||
nt|fann4: 4@H is very close. Needs a @S lead to beat it.|pg||
nt|sater1957:  looks a push, 4@H not easy to avoid|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: normal procedure over such 2-suited bids is to choose from the worse case|pg||
nt|sater1957:  @s presumably is @D|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sunsamvar: 2 distibutional hands and 2 flat ones... unusual|pg||
nt|frankaus: what do u call an 8 card suit???|pg||
nt|sssvablue: an octopus?|pg||
nt|frankaus: trumps :)|pg||
nt|joest: This is limit or better with four trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: of course it would have been a clever play to lead the 4om a doublel ton|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: and I predict he'll bid on|pg||
nt|joest: b/c of the heart queen|pg||
nt|vbman: if the pard of a strong cl opener shows no sign of life u sd be taking precautions to bid|pg||
nt|barnets: then south would have been acutelly unhappy|pg||
nt|jbgood: if common transfer to 1 NT it may be just that or @ds (I think)|pg||
nt|jlrice: chance for jacobs to pick up here if they can find 3N|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cicus: in this case, 2@S meaning he is willing to play 3m if N has minors|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: 1S showed D|pg||
nt|xenya: now a chance for Jacobs -- 3N is cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: Of course an 8 is a snowman in golf|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 3 imps for EW?|pg||
nt|sater1957:  S should overtake for a push|pg||
nt|jbgood: N started with 2 rounds of clubs in the OR|pg||
nt|sater1957:  and @DK not overtaken, and claimed for -2. Not exactly what happened presumably|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: On a @D lead, even if S finds the @S switch, declarer can duck to get home.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|inquiry: pver take out doubles, direct raises are usually played as weak, so here they|pg||
nt|inquiry: use 2NT as a limit raise or better|pg||
nt|sssvablue: club to Q and heart through?|pg||
nt|barnets: he would have ducked the spade had zia led it|pg||
nt|xenya: but that was a remote chance|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: it's conceivable Ozdil won't get the trumps right|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes south very trusting i would have ducked a round because im used to tricky stuff from money players who do these things because their pards never watch the pips in any case|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: this is a interesting lead problem - knowing your line have many cards in a suit must think is use that suit to communicate, and search a lead more usefull|pg||
nt|bridge_one: of course playing suit contract|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|onebid: hardly seems better than limit, but with careful play will make|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Oh, you have played with me before?|pg||
nt|lestergold: our thoughts converge barnet|pg||
nt|lestergold: Zia  just that sort of tricky money player|pg||
nt|lestergold: ive played with all of u before|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|inquiry: wehn the club hook wins (it has to be taken), Ozdil will have to decide how to|pg||
nt|inquiry: play.. for Tx with the takeout doubler or Kx with Paul Lewis.|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec has suggested that Kit should have cashed AK clubs before third dim|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|dcbutler: currently in the other matches on BBO, Fleisher leads Cohler by 21 and Rogoff leads Diamond by 7|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: i should add distinguished spec|pg||
mc|9|nt|sssvablue: the play will be mundane|pg||
nt|barnets: i dont think so|pg||
nt|barnets: then he would have no entry for the diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: wll it shows i am not visulaising the hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes of course|pg||
nt|barnets: he could cash CKCA but then have to rely on a finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: not clear whether that was a better play or not|pg||
nt|gosia: meanwhile nice defense going on here - David can't see all the hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanwhile back at the ranch what is going to happen here?|pg||
nt|barnets: cashing CK CA and taking a diamond finnese would not have worked had easts diamonds been interchanged with his clubs look at it|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure so a priori which was the better shot?|pg||
nt|barnets: but its not clear what is best cshing 1 club is safe|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe the Q would drop|pg||
nt|barnets: I f you cash a second club you need to take a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|gosia: David should probably figure from the sequence of club plays that Kit has few entries|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: David is still thinking hard on this trick.|pg||

nt|inquiry: Itend to kibitz these things well after they are played... having board numbers in|pg||
nt|inquiry: the commetns is very useful... :)  the vugraph archieves are wonderful|pg||
nt|jbgood: as long as 3 @h presumably also would show hearts, a further explanation would be nice:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cicus: seems like S can take 4 trumps and the @DA|pg||
nt|glen: yes, i love the banners in the comments, since often reviewed post-play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it is a limit of 2/1|pg||
nt|fann4: Always a problem, when Opener is around 17 facing 7 or 8 and no fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: with the power of 4-4 fits, 4@S is a superior contract|pg||
nt|vbman: thats a great idea|pg||
nt|glen: less liked: when commentary from other matches get intertwined|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: an unhappy set of options for west|pg||
mb|p|nt|sater1957:  often the direct raise is preemptive, and then 2@S would be invitational.|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: I want to thank the kibs who have kept me posted on other room. Lot's of glitches as usual|pg||
nt|inquiry: ----------- on to board 42 ---------------------|pg||
nt|sater1957:  big swing for Ozdil|pg||
nt|hlortz: looks like about 800|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sssvablue: the 5th heart provides a pitch for a @c in spades|pg||
nt|vbman: 3cl now|pg||
nt|milton_se: needs an artifical 2C rebid to be solved|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes, Gazilli would have sorted things out.|pg||
nt|lestergold: so what do u call a 3/3 fit playing in 3/3 club fits seems to guive me a sense of deja vu today for some reason|pg||
pc|h2|nt|frankaus: hard to find 4@S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes tough|pg||
nt|inquiry: that happens way too much.. about the commentary being mixed|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joest: if he makes this one, they need a new wing for the hall of fame :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 1100 would be a nice gain|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bridge_one: or also a 2NT with 17 and 2 stop in all suit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hlortz: yes 1100 would be 8 imps|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|joest: start building it now :)|pg||
nt|onebid: needs a wing and a prayer:)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: woolsey says here have the rope hang urselves with it!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jbgood: should start on his reserve trumå suit - duly done|pg||
pc|s5|nt|barnets: south has been there before not making a noise with his 9 count|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Now declarer can draw trump and set up @H|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jbgood: å is next to p on my keyboard (if you wonder)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fann4: 2NT is a possiblity, but I don't like it.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|frankaus: some LOL's play extended stayman here  - 2/3@D shows 4-4 with min/max|pg||
nt|cicus: @HK now|pg||
nt|barnets: when his partner open third in hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|milton_se: getting too high on many hands|pg||
nt|jbgood: keeping trump control this way|pg||
nt|hlortz: def needs to be carreful even to get 800 wellplayed so far|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|glen: yes, @H K would have been nice play|pg||
nt|fann4: I'm with Strul - a 2@C rebidder, and hoping pard can bid again.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: spec asks why not 1n answer is that west is not good enough by their agreements i would have thought 1n is normally quite a constructive reponse|pg||
nt|sssvablue: most play it 8 to 10 or there abouts|pg||
pc|d4|mc|11|nt|glen: can S count out W for @S K now?|pg||
nt|cicus: does not matter after all, as S has already been forced can't take @DA|pg||
nt|lestergold: unofrtunately east could not move after the 2c bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - i am impressed with the standar of play at this table, NS have really showed class (as we all know there is plenty of EW)|pg||

nt|inquiry: very difficult hand...|pg||
nt|inquiry: ------------------- on to 43 ---------------|pg||
nt|inquiry: ================== Board 58 ==================|pg||
nt|cicus: EW in the slam zone|pg||
nt|glen: now the dreaded short @D opening?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not the result we were expecting|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So he played it well to a certain point, then fell from grace|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cicus: don't they play 3-suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: 2@D = >2@D|pg||
nt|milton_se: once E gives a positive, they're there|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cicus: oh, they do, I was too slow|pg||
nt|glen: <2@D|pg||
nt|fann4: You KNOW as EW here you are losing about 7 imps, with your counterparts playing a Big Club system in the other room.|pg||
nt|lestergold: last three three fit was four off|pg||
nt|2hplus4: A few cards right and EW can make5@C|pg||
nt|dcbutler: i'm betting they don't get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: Tx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Info Indonesian National Championships 2009|pg||
nt|cicus: clasicc precision 2@D showing short @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: no game here - so a competitive bid|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Here we have an auction that might be repeated|pg||
nt|lestergold: normal id say and looks like one off|pg||
nt|2hplus4: So am I!|pg||
nt|jlrice: only takes 3 finesses and a good break|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: tu for ur company, sunil, stan, kibs - fine operating rihadi|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Was a pleasure commentating and sharing all those beers with you, Stan & Frank|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: www.kejurnas-bridge-2009.comxa.com|pg||
nt|glen: hey, ben got mentioned|pg||
nt|cicus: :)|pg||
nt|vbman: will bid the slam?|pg||
nt|cicus: slam is not particularly good|pg||
nt|glen: I like the slam|pg||
nt|cicus: at least not on a heart lead|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w can make 3N with  good guess|pg||
nt|sater1957:  pass?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: yes|pg||
nt|sater1957:  no, I mean now by N|pg||
nt|hlortz: well to fewS for dbl too weak for 2@D|pg||
nt|jbgood: Grue solved the problem by taking charge with 1 NT on the N hand in the OR|pg||
nt|jlrice: i take that back  it is worse then that|pg||
pc|h7|nt|2hplus4: Yes there is the @C9 as well|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sssvablue: Thanks to our commentators Frank Budal(Australia) and Sunil Varghese(india), our VUGraph operator Riaydi from Indonesia|pg||
nt|jbgood: Gu just lacks an r and a e|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fann4: 2@D was meant to show the majors.|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s can only cash 2 spades and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a very biddable 3n tho|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|onebid: how many would bid 4@H with Linda's hand?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|joest: Linda did well to resist the temptation to bid 4@h.  She has way more than she might for a 3@h call|pg||
nt|onebid: yes|pg||
nt|inquiry: West is trying for slam... East will cooperate if he really is.....|pg||
nt|glen: this must be one of those auctions that they don't have a lot of|pg||
nt|dcbutler: must be at least 5 or 6 per cent|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sunsamvar: Tx also to the organisers and Roland and BBO for bringing us all these telecasts|pg||
nt|sssvablue: OUr sponsors, the good folks at BBO, and of course our spectators ... I am Stan Schenker and stay with us for VU graphs from all over the world this weekend|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would choise 3@S in W, however 1down or more|pg||
nt|fann4: This is one for partnerships to discuss. I would have taken 2@D as natural, even given that opener has 5@D|pg||
nt|hlortz: so another 5 imps if e makes it|pg||
nt|jlrice: i think we all agree that looking at the 2 hands you would not want to be playing game on those cards|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|frankaus: seems like another 4 imps for EW here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he better cash out|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: or he might get away for 1 down|pg||
nt|cicus: so 4@S was nonforcing but E liked his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: 4@C  then 4@S was a slam try|pg||
nt|jbgood: withdraw the last one - not funny at all:(|pg||
pc|dT|nt|barnets: your a rubber bridge player just bid it|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|glen: oh, double of 5@H by the person on lead against @S|pg||
nt|cicus: X is for the lead, lest he forget|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|2hplus4: They have done in the other room|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sunsamvar: he loses nothing by playing @Sj|pg||
nt|frankaus: and  gains nothing as well :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and may gain as in this case|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the ruff comes from the 3 carder trump|pg||
pc|cK|nt|glen: S throws cards into the air|pg||
nt|glen: and then says "no questions"|pg||
nt|barnets: and then make it|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jlrice: and played it by east to avoid the heart lead|pg||
nt|dcbutler: so congratulations to the Ozdil team, which will advance to the round of 8 starting at 3:45 New York time. I think they will play the winner of Fleisher v Cohler|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Not much room left on that coffin for any more nails|pg||
nt|dcbutler: the Jacobs team will join the USA2 bracket|pg||
nt|jlrice: do they have any rules regarding playbacks when making the USA2 bracket?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They have about 84 rules|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=27&Itemid=224  for the tournament website and the complicated format|pg||
nt|dcbutler: i think so, at least in the early stages|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sunsamvar: loser on loser|pg||
nt|inquiry: She allowed as teh double might be in case Ozdil was stealing and she was|pg||
nt|inquiry: stacked in diamonds. Vul, I would have bid 4@H, but here I can't fault 3@H too|pg||
nt|inquiry: much|pg||
nt|joest: now exit a diamond and let opps break a black suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|frankaus: cant get back|pg||
nt|inquiry: This lead makes this very easy to play, I guess that is glen's point|pg||
nt|lestergold: with west's hand and 15 points with a feeble spade guard - i dont like inviting 800s|pg||
nt|barnets: the problem is if you cash the hearts your in the wrong hand to finnese thwe @c 10|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hlortz: or a push at -2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: rubber players double a lot believe me|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Regarding format. As a spectator said yesterday: "They play, play, play and play, and at some point a team claims to have won it. Then all the legal arguments begin, and the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: lawyers will have a ball"|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|h5|nt|barnets: 3@c in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: making?|pg||

nt|lestergold: i assume|pg||
nt|barnets: North has a good hand|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good for 3s really|pg||

nt|Vugraphu7: I think i misclicked|pg||

nt|glen: EW open all 11 counts, and some with less but more shapely|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: np|pg||
nt|cicus: will they reach the magic 300 IMP boundary|pg||
nt|glen: hence W has "extras"|pg||
nt|barnets: score is 12 to robinson|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: Swing potential here.|pg||
nt|milton_se: 2S fit jump?|pg||
nt|sssvablue: penultimate board, it has been a big set for strul so far|pg||
nt|dcbutler: looks like the lawyers had a good time establishing the rules to start with|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fann4: I'm sure it won't be a fit jump. If used it will be weak.|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 boards to the end of the half|pg||
nt|jbgood: this board is   14 of the 15 of this set, and some credits are due. |pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk5: Hundreds of e-mails back and forth I am told|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fann4: 4@S can be beaten on a @D lead, @C switch, and then a @D to N for a @c ruff.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however for a pair is usefull to can bid 6 cards immediatly, otherwise need to guess after|pg||
nt|hlortz: gu is not happy here|pg||
nt|jbgood: Many thanks to the USBF (Jan Martel in particular) and BBO (including of course Roland Wald, commentator organiser)  for giving us such exciting entertainment free of charge! And  |pg||
nt|sater1957:  well... just *look* happy and bid 2@S|pg||
mb|5C|an|alerted|nt|joest: the spade game on Board 41 made in the otherroom|pg||
nt|inquiry: Misclicking at end of hands when they play the cards quickly is very common|pg||
nt|inquiry: and nearly unavoidable at times|pg||
nt|joest: even though declarer misguessed spades|pg||
nt|inquiry: --------------------- on to board 44 --------------------|pg||
nt|glen: N has already pulled out 4@S card|pg||
nt|barnets: score is 6 now |pg||
mb|d|nt|jbgood: also thank you operator Trevor Lumb, well done!|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Pass or correct poresumably|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: that's because east gave declarer a ruff sluff at trick three and there was never a club guess|pg||
nt|onebid: puppet vs 2NT common|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry: Some one asked why I am adding the board numbers, it is for people checking|pg||
nt|inquiry: vugraph records in days, weeks, and longer in the future....|pg||
nt|jbgood: Also thank you fellow commentators Hans van Staveren and Henry Lortz for guiding us through this set!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hoping opps defende at 6@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: well well n/s cant get to their ten ccard fit and e/w cant getto their cold 4h|pg||
pc|dA|nt|glen: declarer determines EW have made 3 bids with a combined 15 count|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fann4: What a sequence!|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1n undoubled an excellent save therfore|pg||
nt|hlortz: a gain for ozdil's team escaping the dbl|pg||
pc|d5|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|sssvablue: welcome to Indonesian Interclub championships|pg||
nt|sssvablue: G'day Frank|pg||
nt|milton_se: he got'em there|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it is a old history playing IMP :)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Breaks are too bad to make but should get a few IMPs here|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|inquiry: The diamond lead breaks up whatever slim chance there was for 12 tricks on a|pg||
nt|inquiry: diamond-heart squeeze on Wold|pg||
nt|Walddk5: A little too late|pg||
nt|jlrice: will probably be off 1|pg||
nt|dcbutler: off 1 seems the best he can do|pg||
pc|c3|nt|onebid: slam on a hook|pg||
nt|joest: showing five spades and four hearts is frequently a problem with Puppet, absent clever methods|pg||
nt|joest: don't know what 3@s showed|pg||
nt|joest: aha|pg||
nt|onebid: our operator tells us@H|pg||
nt|inquiry: This hand will give Lewis team a chance for a despirate pick up, if they find the|pg||
nt|inquiry: 50% slam missed here.|pg||
nt|inquiry: since it makes|pg||
nt|joest: of course there is the small matter of the heart jack as well|pg||
nt|jbgood: and of course - the audience!! Your inputs are much appreciated, but i hope you understand that commentators do not always have time to answe each and one of you personally. Still, ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: you are the best!|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|2hplus4: He'' do well to get out for 1 off|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jbgood: both the double and the Ozdil trump switch in the OR was very rewarding|pg||
nt|hlortz: come back in about 20 minutes for the exciting conclusion.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|milton_se: Robinson acting with self-confidence now|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sater1957:  looks like making now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bridge_one: @C return with A in @S could be played|pg||
nt|fann4: The defence have missed their @c ruff now, only 2 down.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sssvablue: We will play the last 3 boards in this room, and then restart at board 1|pg||
nt|onebid: ruff the 4th heart?|pg||
nt|sater1957:  no, I down if E overruffs and plays @S|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|2hplus4: It's dummy they should be forcing|pg||
nt|dcbutler: yes, that made declarer's problem easier|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|joest: or dummy reversal|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|joest: spades 4-0 could make hand interesting even if spade king on|pg||
nt|milton_se: better for E/W than 5H :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|2hplus4: He can take the @C finesse and set up @S|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bridge_one: now declarer have all informations about the way to play @C suit - impossible sgl in North|pg||
nt|fann4: Strul's decision has turned out wrong - but who can blame him? With 10 cards in the black suits and partner bidding both @C and @S his decision seems very reasonable to me.|pg||

nt|xenya: guide us through this set and, of course, to all the spectators. Hope you enjoyed the show.|pg||
mb|p!|nt|joest: so I think this is the last hand of the set|pg||
nt|inquiry: Congradulations to Ozdil|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 3NT|pg||
nt|sssvablue: 3nt form North should be cold|pg||

nt|inquiry: ============= board 45 ===============|pg||
nt|milton_se: 1C . 4H will put some pressure on North|pg||
nt|lestergold: well room for some action  here|pg||
nt|barnets: board 19 is not in the score and is 12 imps to strul|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: seems hard to stay out of 4@s|pg||
nt|onebid: Thanks to fellow commentators, kibs and our great vg operator|pg||
nt|lestergold: west bids 4s but north will surely be there with something|pg||
nt|sater1957:  sure, and one board to play. I thought that the USA was the law is law country, and the Netherlands the lax....|pg||
nt|jbgood: and in KO matches time penalty will most often only be given to teams that have been warned during play|pg||
mb|2N|nt|inquiry: upgrading the 15 hcp hand to 16, only the most pendatic precision players|pg||
nt|inquiry: would open east 1@S|pg||
nt|cicus: nice misfitting hands on which E will probably go down a lot in 4@S|pg||
nt|glen: one expects N to figure out which two suits S has|pg||
nt|fann4: Who can only dbl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: last board - Ty all for watching :)|pg||
nt|sssvablue: 4@s must have less defense than 3nt on this auction|pg||
nt|barnets: and robinson in 41h here|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: east 5s now??|pg||
nt|barnets: in th last board|pg||
nt|barnets: south has a good hand|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Why would east bid 5@s when he doesnt know which suits north has|pg||
nt|barnets: could bid 5N|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry: norht his hoping Wold bids|pg||
nt|glen: now does redouble=own place to play|pg||
nt|glen: assuming everything else is pass or correct|pg||
nt|inquiry: he was hoping that would not be the bid... :)|pg||
nt|vbman: some1 is in trouble|pg||
nt|barnets: I would|pg||
nt|lestergold: east knows west has little defensive strength and he hasnt a mountain either in defence|pg||
mb|3C|nt|frankaus: 9 top trick + 1 on @S lead|pg||
nt|sssvablue: If East doesn't lead a spade, can make 11|pg||
nt|barnets: this may stop him|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu7: ty|pg||
nt|fann4: Thanks all|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Ty at our operator, very great job, never a error !|pg||
nt|lestergold: double ?/ what is this meant to mean?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cicus: I wonder if 2@S is forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|dcbutler: thanks all. round of 8 begins at 3:45 New York time (90 board matches that round)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fann4: An early trump switch for 2 down.|pg||
nt|sssvablue: stir the pot !|pg||
nt|barnets: I can defend something|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Ty at Jeff,Bertil and overall at Roland for the great job to organize the comments in Vugraph|pg||
nt|gosia: they are very strict actually - but all matches look like running late |pg||
nt|sater1957:  looks like IMP's for Ozdil on the last board too..|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: you could pass the X with a better hand, I mean|pg||
nt|glen: will N X 4@S?|pg||
nt|jbgood: sure does|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now surely souths lack of action means that he is flat and wants north to choose|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Another flat board. The problem for Jacobs was that they did not do well on the non-flat boards|pg||
nt|xenya: to be fair, there haven't been too many|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|inquiry: will he get a chance to double it?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: Bramley rubbing his chin|pg||
nt|cicus: E should pass|pg||
nt|inquiry: I think east has to pass here|pg||
nt|cicus: he knows spades are stacked behind him :)|pg||
nt|glen: E is thinking S+D by S = not good 4 me, H+C by S = not good 4 me|pg||
nt|fann4: On bd 14 E opened 1@S, S passed and W jumped to 3@s!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|onebid: and to Roland Wald, who works so hard to make BBO the greatest!|pg||
nt|xenya: in this segment anyway|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: why not hearts he not only has more of them but the suit is much better and south has not expressd any pref|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|cicus: even this one is too high|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jbgood: Lair in the OR was happy with 3 @h - and they sold out to 4@d|pg||
pc|d8|nt|inquiry: I think NS bidding helped EW stay "low" (relatively speaking)|pg||
nt|sater1957:  about 35 straight IMP's. Should make them confiddent for the last set|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|onebid: final set coming up|pg||
nt|cicus: lack of entries means E can't play spades to advantage, probably losing 2 trumps|pg||
nt|gosia: rhis can get ugly|pg||
pc|c5|nt|barnets: loks like this is home now|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Better get hearts right|pg||
nt|lestergold: can south not redouble to show general strength |pg||
nt|barnets: HK|pg||
nt|barnets: will show heart suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: what else could redouble mean but i have cards pard!|pg||
nt|lestergold: bid ur best suit!|pg||
nt|barnets: and declarer will lose 1 trump and a club|pg||
nt|gosia: or not :)|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room 5@d undoubled|pg||
nt|barnets: same lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: and should have not given them a chance to find as better spot the fact they didnt is luck|pg||
nt|barnets: so last hand thanks to all  USBF BBO for putting on the show|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Well the opponents managed 3 double figure swings|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|joest: thx all|pg||
nt|inquiry: some interesting hands this session. Board 36 might deserve a relook... some|pg||
nt|inquiry: interesting chances to make that one after all|pg||
nt|onebid: got busy typing - didn't follow|pg||
nt|inquiry: made an overtrick in the open room on 36|pg||
nt|onebid: bye all:)|pg||
nt|barnets: the vugraph operators and all the specs for watching|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fann4: What a fascinating game bridge is. On bd 14, EW are playing in 3@S, with NS never entering the bidding. The 1@D opening put paid to South's entering the bidding.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K in @D lose a trick|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sssvablue: A big thanks to Jan Martel and her tireless work|pg||
pc|cT|nt|barnets: and my fellow commentators|pg||
nt|jbgood: this is   45 of a total of 60 boards|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|2hplus4: They did not play badly - they were unlucky, as well |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Bye for now Thanks for watching|pg||
nt|dcbutler: the Ozdil team played very well, and had some luck also - a difficult combination to beat|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d7|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|inquiry: the heart return is a surprise... did he think Bramley had 5Hs?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|frankaus: maybe the @C finess can be taken if N cashes @HA for the 9th first|pg||
nt|fann4: The defence here have lost a trick in the @D suit.|pg||
nt|milton_se: very good game by Boyd and Robinson once they got started|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|lestergold: but amazingly enuf it has only become ugly for e/w|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Lets not forget Roland Wald who organized VUgraphs for 7 different countries this weekend|pg||
nt|lestergold: II think this time Mr. Cohen did a little bit too much bidding all on his own|pg||
nt|sssvablue: So robinson has recovered most or not all of the early imps they lost in this set|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland overdoes it what we do without him|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland deserves an international award for his work|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|gosia: oops|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|frankaus: no its a follish risk to take the finess|pg||
pc|h9|mc|10|pg||
