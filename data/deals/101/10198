nt|jstokes: Hey Willie -- thanks for being here |pg||
nt|robbg: In addition to being down 85 IMPs at halftime, no doubt the Fleisher team is demoralized by having one of its members, Russ Ekelbad, fined $250 by a USBF disciplinary committee for ...|pg||

nt|mariner1: hi Chris|pg||
nt|clarsen: thx roland|pg||
nt|clarsen: hi everyone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why south [Billy Cohen] gets an initial, but not east [Larry Cohen]|pg||
nt|roswolf: this contract isnt favorite i think|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: -2 or-3|pg||
nt|xenya: it appears 1N was a normal 15-17, so is the final contract -- after the opening, i mean |pg||
pc|hA|nt|thegarve:  and the Italian structure|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kjadams: logic says Matt does not have spade Q  (would continue spades).  so peter can clear clubs and hold east to 2 more tricks.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h9|pg||
nt|clarsen: can get this over fast with a heart ruff|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: hey Chris|pg||

nt|clarsen: can make now i believe|pg||

nt|ahollan1: is it now double dummy to try @D finesse?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is a 12 imp swing, 6 for Strul if they make and -6 if they don't|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: and 10 tricks when LHO has @DK with only 3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: another option @CQ pitch @H10 then ruffing finesse in @H|pg||
nt|clarsen: seems he has to get di right ruffing finesse wot do any good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that still needs @D finesse but not shortness|pg||
nt|clarsen: ruffing finesse i hearts wont help|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Chuck will get player names up as soon as he gets a minute|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Chuck will enter names when he gets a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west is Sylvie Moss, North Sasha Cohen, East Migry Campanile, South Rozanne Pollack|pg||

mb|2N|nt|mariner1: 7@H 7@S or 7@D all can make (all on Q@D hunt)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: real key from Sasha's point of view is the @D suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: Key Card now|pg||
nt|daman: Moss team in 6@S on Board 81 in CR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C from Pollack as Exclusion would be great treatment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sasha can't ask -- needs to know way too much that KC won't tell her|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: we have Closed Room up now|pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|daman: redouble or 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: superfluous dbl -- gives NS more room to sort things out|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moss in Closed Room bid the 6@S on board 81|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: 5@C already said -- no @C loser -- Pollack worried about a) trump  b) missing grand|pg||
pc|d8|nt|daman: I would have bid 5@D    S must have first round @C control|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|mariner1: now S has to sort of guess about N's @S quality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like 5@D too george -- but more because Pollack KNOWS Cohen can't cue in red suit|pg||
nt|daman: missed a big chance to put the opps away|pg||
nt|daman: if they bid the grand in the CR     watch out|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: 13 tricks not certain -- need good things to happen in a red suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and decent trump split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and guess which good thing happened :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: so for the puritans, just a question of whether 6@S arrived at convincingly or not -- which gets an extra 5 points :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al no style points?|pg||
nt|daman: my guess is if you were in 7 and had to play it wide open?  you would end up making on a high crossruff after pitching @Ds on the @Hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a sure line for 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well most lines work|pg||
nt|daman: and ruffing @Cs along the way    East cannot get out of her own way on the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure george -- that seems to rely upon @H 33  surely better to try @D first|pg||

mb|2H|nt|clarsen: tough game hard to earn imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: W DBL might be a STOM|pg||
nt|mariner1: STOM - state of match|pg||
mb|2N|nt|clarsen: dbl not unreasonable he is hoping partner has a defensive trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HQ shows King|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  cards lie well for game but thin on values - should be flat|pg||
nt|thegarve:  maube a 3@d game try would get you there|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mariner1: when behind by 45 and 15 boards to play you can't sit on your hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: E has been relaying i presume?|pg||

mb|p|nt|kjadams: anyone translate the e/w auction?|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: Long relay precision system.|pg||
nt|xenya: then 4@S looks like some kind of keycard ask?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: no point in guessing though|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: whatever it was, they have arrived at a good contract|pg||

pc|dT|nt|jstokes: as predicted, 3@H at the other table as well.  A lost opportunity for Fleisher|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mariner1: if you do sit on them you will usually lose the match, and have flat hands|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|clarsen: 5 more imps to welland,4 spades has no real play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it would be very out of character for NS to even have that agreement - let alone use it |pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: i didn't realize he'd lived in Memphis -- must have been when his dad, Ralph was big shot for ACBL |pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: in OR, NS broke Burns' Law on the previous hand, by playing in a 6-0 fit; there was no infringement on this hand, but the result was bad enough |pg||
nt|kjadams: last quarter, we saw a part score loss for multi 2D.|pg||
nt|othered1: No, they've also made fewer mistakes/bad judgments, too.|pg||
nt|roswolf: good play by robinson has earned its reward|pg||

nt|mariner1: STOM = STate Of Match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Chris -- that's why i think @C attack -- more chances for 3@C & 2@D because of spot cards|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D obvious cue --- just curious what 2@H would be|pg||

nt|thegarve:  11 @s and @h cintracts from 12|pg||
nt|kjadams: Only 3 top losers here, but the club leads will shorten declarer enough to make getting 10 trick tough.  9 seems likely.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Say you get a club lead (best for the defence). If you finesse @S10 at trick 2, you can make it|pg||

mb|1C|an|alert|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N in Closed Room on 59 with small @H lead from N|pg||
mb|1D|an|alert|mb|1H|nt|kjadams: could be ugly here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jstokes: as most of you know, the loser here plays 90 boards against the winner of Nickell-Welland to determine USA2|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@S alert probably "wide range"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes|pg||
mb|d|nt|robbg: Which makes it more likely that Fleisher will resign early when things look out of reach. The rest would be helpful.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  that would be smart - so need a big set next to get momentum going|pg||
nt|kjadams: I was wondering if they might.   They get half a day off in any case.|pg||
nt|roswolf: double sets up the bloodletting|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Boyd will likely run to 2@C but Rubin knows what to do if he does|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: i.e. in Precision  the 4@S can be preemptive or an opening hand with no slam ambition|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@C must be better|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|othered1: sure feels better|pg||
nt|roswolf: at last a good board for fleischer|pg||
nt|othered1: And east hasn't passed yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nothing feels good if you ask *me*|pg||
nt|kjadams: indeed, but at least they will not end up in 4H.|pg||
nt|othered1: good, not, but better than moribund|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mariner1: looks like Strul is a winner now|pg||
nt|thegarve:  get down the gym and pump some iron |pg||
nt|thegarve:  or eat more steak across the road|pg||
nt|jstokes: Do they?  I thought this was scheduled for 60 boards today, if they play them all|pg||
nt|robbg: no that is the leaders' hangout|pg||
nt|robbg: 60 scheduled yes|pg||
nt|othered1: and now excellent|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmmmmm the fox escapes again|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kjadams: diamond slam now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kjadams: I think the other match has 30 more tomorrow.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  bust up there lucky venue and invade the territory then|pg||
nt|jstokes: ah, that sounds right|pg||
nt|kjadams: lol, guess not|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In case anyone is interested, Walddk2 will open a teaching table after this hand to show how 6@S can be made on a club lead on board 87. The lead it got in the open room|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: hard to find the specific defense of  @C lead win Ace - @D shift|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: which table to run too now???|pg||
nt|thegarve:  gang culture|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|robbg: We should resume here after a short break.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We may not have a match when we come back in 1 hour. We shall see. At least we have the playoff match between Nickell and Freeman|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk4: My guess is that Fleisher will concede and get some rest before the USA2 finals tomorrow|pg||
pc|s5|nt|thegarve:  thx all - interesting swing here with $C-5|pg||
nt|robbg: Thanks to USBF, BBO and others who make these presentations possible.|pg||
