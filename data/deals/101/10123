nt|vugraphu4: players discussing various defenses to certain bids|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: will resume shortly|pg||
nt|ady: looks like a part score hand up first|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi and welcome all|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: hello everyone, players discussing systems|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: will begin momentarily|pg||
nt|andyv:  that could prove to be helpful:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Matt|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: NS play alot of unusual systems, strong club, with canope bids, alot of relays|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: as well as unique 2 level openers etc.|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: EW play transfer responses to a short 1@c opener, |pg||
nt|andyv:  and a change of players too|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: system summaries can be found by clicking on players names http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&task=list&event=14|pg||

nt|Vugraphu4: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is segment 3 of QF|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC Matt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello everyone from Manchester UK|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: last 15 boards of the round of 16|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk7: Hello everyone and welcome back to White Plains, New York, for the 2009 United States Bridge Championship. Quarter-finals, four segments of 15 boards; this is the first|pg||
nt|ady: north likely to open with 6-5 distribution      whoever plays  should not go above 2 level    |pg||
nt|finch: The 'intermediate' two (often in combination with a multi) is very fashionable at the moment|pg||
nt|gosia: hello|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good evening from sweden|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And from Ireland|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Your commentators are Frances Hinden, David Edwin, Paul Van de Maele and Danny Sprung|pg||
nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
nt|ady: good even all|pg||
nt|3for3: That 2@S is a 'good' weak 2|pg||
nt|ady: yes   many would open 1 spade|pg||
nt|3for3: this is systemic for them|pg||
nt|finch: west has a tricky call, a choice between 4@D, 4@H and pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Margie|pg||
nt|mcarroll: evening all|pg||
nt|gosia: Ozdil a bit outclassed here - but could surprise , as they have all week|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Martin|pg||
nt|gosia: hi Andy|pg||
nt|gosia: Martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: ok so they have started play already|pg||
nt|ady: looks to me  whoever plats will be too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: starts today with 3 Singletons and a void|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tylere: Hi folks|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT-2@c-2@H-3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: +4?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i really dont see how|pg||
nt|hedyg: did NS manage to disc all their black cards?|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Tyler Eaves :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Tyler|pg||
nt|tylere: appears to be a trick one claim, I don't see any play on the hand|pg||
nt|hlortz: making 6 on a @H lead is believable|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is a typo in South's name operator|pg||
nt|Walddk4: r missing in Milgrim|pg||
nt|hedyg: no the operator seems to have a problem|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Good Afternoon everyone :)|pg||
nt|barnets: hi there |pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: what does dbl show     a good wseak 2?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Margie, Andy|pg||
nt|gosia: :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Vugraphu4: a great deal of fireworks from this identical table last night, hopefully today lives up to expectations :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: If H Q is finessed- making 7|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|barnets: 35 imps with 45 boards to go|pg||
pc|s6|nt|finch: North's double often described as "action" saying I want to act but I'm doubling in case you want to defend|pg||
nt|ady: this could be expensive|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  2@d minimum... and 2@h relay (with help from specs)|pg||
nt|gosia: I comm - Robinson/Rogoff - wonder if they had late penalties ?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  don't have it at fingertips... will get it in one minute but it's under USBF|pg||
nt|gosia: lots of bidding here - better come to a screeching halt soon :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: Weichsel head in hands, in the tank, he is well known for being a "deliberate" player|pg||
nt|andyv:  unchartered waters here.  Maybe 4@D is cue with @h support?|pg||
nt|gosia: I first fell asleep kibbitzing Peter in 1970 :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|finch: about 500 I think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Barnet|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|finch: ...until it was pulled to 5@H|pg||
pc|h6|nt|finch: that's not something you want to do very often.  You know that converting 4@Hx to 5@Hx never looks very good|pg||
nt|ady: think 5@D  likely down 4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A benefit of being at the slow table is that we get to see the Open results|pg||
nt|mcarroll: oops|pg||
nt|gosia: wheels came off here a bit|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: ekeblad says he shows a 5-3-3-2 that didn't want to play nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  like in races, when the baton gets dropped, usually bad things happen.|pg||
nt|gosia: Peter new to this - comes from Precision|pg||
nt|andyv:  system notes on line not much help here...3@d may have been the culprit.|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: weichsel : "we had a mixup p, sorry" |pg||
nt|gosia: Russ plays some Blue tem Club variant|pg||
nt|gosia: Team|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Barnet|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|cindy:  still 6 with the spades as they are|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi Barnet, Martin and Ralf|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|Walddk7: and hello Matt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Roland|pg||
pc|h5|nt|don paulus: ruff some clubs promotes 8 H in south|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|raghavan: Wc Kath|pg||
mc|8|nt|finch: three rounds of spades would also have promoted the @H8.  The diamond lead was a pretty good shot however|pg||

nt|andyv:  strong c! by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3@S?|pg||

nt|tylere: 2@H= bal invite|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Tyler|pg||
nt|barnets: how many tricks were made on board 1 please/|pg||
nt|tylere: the 1@D bid promises 5+ @D in an unbalnced hand in 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|barnets: in 3N recorded as7|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Barnet!|pg||
nt|barnets: im next door just checking|pg||
nt|hedyg: we asked, no reply|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: russ and peter are still discussing previous hand through the screen|pg||
nt|gosia: to dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: apparently they have not moved on yet|pg||
nt|gosia: lol- can picture this|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like an easy 4@s on EW. no sacrifie in vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 4@S is more obviously a void. 3@S sounds as if it's looking fr 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: one more    likely shows minors   |pg||
nt|3for3: good action hands to start|pg||
nt|finch: not exactly what south wanted to hear loooking at soft spade values|pg||
nt|3for3: but his minors look great|pg||
nt|finch: 4NT here might be natural. Or it might be saying I don't know what to bid. I bet they've never discused this acution!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and EW putting pressure on|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yo_yo: that expression is new to me  i must remember it to impress my friends :)|pg||
nt|barnets: the last hand in 3n in open|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but with @cQJx in front 12 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: west bid 3n after 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ralfwil: needs a lot to be made in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: 3 NT contract goes away|pg||
nt|barnets: here 61S makes on any lead|pg||
mb|4D|nt|hedyg: 2@s= minimum?|pg||
nt|don paulus: hard to get into slam after ops open|pg||
nt|gosia: oops|pg||
nt|gosia: think Russ worth 4 @d ?|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S|pg||
nt|barnets: a lucky one|pg||
mb|p|nt|tylere: Not sure. The CC doesn't detail openers rebids|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: e is asking a question|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=390&pid=709|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: and http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=414&pid=814 for G-H|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: n is writing aa lengthly explanation|pg||
nt|andyv:  South bid 1N in OR and got rewarded|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: yes with @cQJx in front|pg||
mb|p|nt|gosia: Melih a bit agressive :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  hard to say if worth a 4@d bid....maybe 3@h followed by 4@d if pd can't bid 3N...S hand already limited|pg||
nt|gosia: I think Russ worth a boost even though Peter showed 5 or less|pg||
mb|p|nt|tylere: this is probably -1|pg||
nt|hedyg: @H lead?|pg||
nt|tylere: A@D maybe?|pg||
nt|tylere: @H would be my second choiuce|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: often trump is best when you and pd hold the majority of hcps|pg||
nt|hlortz: so this should be a couple of IMPs to EW|pg||
nt|tylere: I notice that 3N has been changed to = in both rooms now|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok, more like it|pg||
nt|barnets: just less than 25 percent slam|pg||
pc|cA|nt|barnets: as with a iamond lead declarer has to cash 3 hearts before the @S ace|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|hedyg: best he can do now is take in hand and play @s hoping for split honours|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: that would be for -1|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|tylere: somewhat surprised E moved over 3@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: had pd figured for short @ds|pg||
nt|barnets: now hes wishing they had bid slam|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: well they are in slam next door    depends on the lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Ozdil needs to recoup some imps|pg||
nt|mcarroll: On 46 3NT made in Open so 8 imps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also to decide which @c distribution QJx Qxxx to J and vice versa|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|raghavan: Kath slam in D1?|pg||

mb|1C|nt|tylere: 1@C = @C or balanced|pg||
nt|gosia: cover your eyes novices /newcomers :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h bid pretty aggressive with this vul|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think we both are happy not to be in slam|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gosia: Peter must be steaming to make that call at these colors :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and Russ introducing a pressure cooker?|pg||
nt|gosia: will be rewarded no less :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tylere: if balanced, not in strong NT range|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: so this is unbalanced for them|pg||
nt|finch: double will get South excited, but the heart lie means this is a dangerous spot|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   a good contract for n/s    but 5-0 split of trumps does not help|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  extra reward?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: 1400   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: East trusting his partner to have some values for a vul against not overcall|pg||
nt|andyv:  cards all wrong for E/W|pg||
nt|mcarroll: an 18 HCP vul game|pg||
nt|gosia: Peter will take a long time to play this unless they lead trumps for him|pg||
nt|andyv:  a spec says trump lead holds it to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: with most right here its only a question of how many overtricks he will make|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: seems to be able to make quite a few @cs in NS|pg||
nt|tylere: yes..but if it's bid it probably has to be by south, and south is happy in 2@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: shot in the arm for Ozdil|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: and EW might find the better @d contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: unusual lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: if this goes down 1 another IMP to ew|pg||
nt|tylere: the top+bottom two suiter problem again...in a couple of partnerships I've played various ways of showing that combo, just to avoid this problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: N should be short in @s, thus unbalanced with @cs|pg||
nt|barnets: i predict 2|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
pc|c3|nt|raghavan: Here Ozdil goes down |pg||
nt|barnets: or 1|pg||
nt|barnets: if he ducks a club|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: so why not lead pd's suit?|pg||
nt|andyv:  with trump lead, declarer should be able to make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will he run for home or @H Blockage here?|pg||
nt|raghavan: No block|pg||
nt|cindy:  wonder if W considered 4@s   he has suit oriented cards (not notrump)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he can hope|pg||

nt|gosia: he really didn't have much choice|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR in 3N on this hand, down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: another big hand - NS can make 11 tricks in hearts and EW 10 in diamonds|pg||
nt|vbman: now a michaels may lead to a right lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w   trying to barrage  opps out of contract|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   tht east had bid 4@D|pg||
nt|finch: North has a nice hand for the majors, but should probably stick to 4@H only as South may have stretched a little to get to the right spot|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1@S i mean|pg||
nt|ralfwil: on hands i like astro with a 5-card anchor major|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vbman: melih may pull some back|pg||
nt|ady: hope south wont overvalue the void diamond|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 2S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i prefer to bid that on the first round|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N and W will be glad to keep alow profile on this one|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s can make a couple of spades|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tylere: I'm being told that X = single minor or majors|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to the world's youngest vugraph commentator: Adam Kaplan|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hi All :)|pg||
nt|tylere: Welcome Adam|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Adam :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult to go down if declarer attacked @hs|pg||
nt|cindy:  Weichsel overcalled with a 1@s opening with 2@h holding J10xxx so im amazed no 1@s bid here|pg||
nt|cindy:  last night|pg||
nt|barnets: so you would be right here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hlortz: welcome|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe he bids differently with a good lead|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hi Tyler, Hedy and Henry :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mtvesuvius: Meckwell here it looks like|pg||
nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
nt|hlortz: so ew are chipping away at the lead looks like 4 imps for making 2@D|pg||
nt|tylere: looks like they'll do rather better here than in the other room, where they ended up in 2@H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hi Danny :)|pg||
nt|3for3: looks like 4 or 5 for diamond for bidding the better part score|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Danny!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This was an interesting problem for Rogoff in the OR|pg||
nt|finch: now a matter of how much South think he's already shown - and clearly he thinks he's minimum|pg||
nt|ady: e/w save in 6@D   -500|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mcarroll: 4@H also possible|pg||
nt|cindy:  got them to 4@h and at the other table his side never got in the bidding|pg||
nt|cindy:  4@h making|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|3for3: DF makes 3@D, but I think that requires a spade to the ten when in with the only dummy entry|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c5|pc|dK|nt|hedyg: or later :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He had to decide whether to pass 2@d which was 1M or to bid 2@h allowing for if his partner had @s|pg||
nt|hlortz: make 2 make 3 same 4 imps...|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like 4@h, 2@c and 3@d are there for the taking|pg||
nt|pelu: a 2@S = 5+ and a minor would work well here|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|raghavan: Kath & Cindy |pg||
nt|raghavan: does playing Ha show HK?|pg||
nt|cindy:  here :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|raghavan: Pl call me Rag|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Shi fingered for the king, put it back, then played the @h A :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: I am usually called Rag|pg||
nt|cindy:  ok rag|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well Rag I might play Ace when i have a singleton and want my partner to give me a ruff|pg||
nt|yo_yo: However that message was lost on Yang|pg||
nt|raghavan: But here E played HA though having HK|pg||
nt|raghavan: He wanted a D ruff|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes but didnt get it|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, W covered J@h and N was unable to get to his hand after that|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: ok the kibs know he knows :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i see now ty|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|hedyg: @s finesse for free now, might as well try it|pg||
nt|finch: Declarer will probably play two trumps before spades, in case West is 1174|pg||
nt|finch: (although many 1174s would have opened 4@D)|pg||
nt|finch: sorry, that doesn't work, dummy runs out of trumps|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, it cannot hurt|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|andyv:  but Q@C lead was the killer|pg||
nt|gosia: just saw that - wow!|pg||
nt|gosia: Mike Kamil nicest guy and great player|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|raghavan: anyhow 3S down 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Weichsel stops to count the hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: HQ?|pg||
nt|raghavan: loser on loser|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Weichsel : "This is a mighty fine pickle here"|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|finch: declarer's now wondering if 1-1 in the majors is more likely than 1-2 (which it isn't)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: some kind of squeeze if N plays @cJ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|barnets: declarer was worried north held the @H ace and n/s could then take 7 tricks|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Yes that @CQ was inspired|pg||
nt|andyv:  good action hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|3for3: diamond picking up some loose change...which could change the match :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: looks like 4S EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|tylere: 1@C = balanced or clubs, not strong NT|pg||
nt|barnets: west will raise to 4|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gosia: depends on how you feel at theses colors|pg||
nt|barnets: and north 4@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tylere: 1@D = @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N maybe 4NT - |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 4@S look good - if u only see NS-card - but @S 4-1 will make great probelms on a @H-lead from East|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 1@h shows 2 or 3@H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2 places toplay?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  little slower auction here than OR|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|finch: North somewhat disappointed that South didn't reopen|pg||
pc|h3|nt|finch: After that lead, South knows that partner has a spade void|pg||
nt|raghavan: Kath - do EW play forcing NT|pg||
nt|barnets: well 5@D is down 1 but 4@S maybe more|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mtvesuvius: This is a pretty easy 3N or 4@H|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d is more @hs?|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: a lot of wxplaining going on|pg||
nt|3for3: this kind of bidding, even though it is not complicated, will forever keep bridge from becoming a spectator sport (bbo afficionados notwithstanding)|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: on both sides of table|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont know their system but it looks like it |pg||
pc|hT|nt|hedyg: also slows the play down a lot with the questions and answers|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: ty Al|pg||
nt|gosia: I like Lairs (north) Take out dbl - get in and out fast|pg||
pc|hA|nt|3for3: south has bid his 3 card suit and twice bid his xx|pg||
nt|ady: may not be easy to beat 2@H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh yes alerted now|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes now alerted|pg||
nt|raghavan: as forcing|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This is rightsided in this case\|pg||
nt|hedyg: so all that is known of the S hand is that he has no 3+ @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: more explanations before opening lead|pg||
nt|cindy:  rare 4th best lead|pg||
pc|h8|nt|3for3: west needs to shift to a diamond to hold the extra overtrick|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@s or 10|pg||
pc|sT|pc|hK|nt|andyv:  6 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|yo_yo: why rare Cindy?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hlortz: ew are having a great board-a-match game but few imps being won|pg||
nt|3for3: the black suits look fairly hopeless|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Close match here, every IMP counts|pg||
nt|hedyg: now N has the 9@s for finessing @s and is not blocked|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Correct, everything works nicely for Declarer here|pg||
nt|hedyg: @c lead by W in OR|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Greco may find a @d switch here|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: n is further explaining|pg||
nt|hedyg: he knows his pd has 4@hs|pg||
nt|andyv:  need club switch|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|hedyg: there goes the @D trick|pg||
nt|yo_yo: usually 3/5 in USA?|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2/3 leads popular in UK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2/4|pg||
nt|cindy:  i like 2/4 but cant find a partner that does :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and so a push|pg||
nt|gosia: specs ask if would overcall 1nt - absolutely not !|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: no, it doesnt seem to meet with approval playing online |pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: why play @c when you see KJx?|pg||
nt|gosia: double much better|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best play probably a small @d to table|pg||
nt|pelu: small @D now|pg||
nt|barnets: the only chance to make is the @D ace hoping East has singleton king|pg||
nt|barnets: unlikely though|pg||
nt|barnets: if east had the sing king dec could revert to spades|pg||
nt|pelu: to keep control Ekeblad sh start @Ss with @SQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Ekeblad in the tank, asking about the weak 2 bid |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t think thats enough with @dK singleton, but for -1|pg||
nt|pelu: @SQ in trick 3 - and small @D i trick 4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Peter. That´s better|pg||
nt|barnets: if west has single King he cant make the hand now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|barnets: so hes wondering if he should still try and make it|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|andyv:  lone honors usually make NT difficult to play|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: ask if E has K@s and claim|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|raghavan: He has setup D for 2 H discard |pg||
nt|barnets: no luck|pg||
pc|dK|nt|finch: playing 3rd & 5th leads the king would have looked silly if declarer had AQxx|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c8|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: That sounds like a good plan to me|pg||

nt|hedyg: i am learning :)|pg||

nt|gosia: typo Matt ? :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: It only takes 51 boards to learn a system, Hedy :)|pg||
nt|3for3: might make 3 on some variations|pg||
nt|hedyg: faster if they repeat the bids on each bd :)|pg||
nt|3for3: i bet DF will|pg||
nt|andyv:  game try?|pg||
nt|cindy:  @cA lead i guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: ekeblad explained 3spd as "if rememberd, 4-4-4-1 max"|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Although I think Hampson will want to reopen|pg||
nt|hedyg: S is a passed hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He may try 1NT now|pg||
nt|hlortz: oh hes passed duh|pg||
nt|3for3: dangerous spot for hampson here|pg||
nt|3for3: doesnt want to lose a double part score swing|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: more questions|pg||
nt|hlortz: he wansts to bid but is vulnerable|pg||
nt|3for3: but the opps are in his longest suit|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, 1NT is tempting|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: pass is more tempting|pg||

nt|pelu: if decl duck - then -2 on a @C-ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: as he looks at dummy he thinks 4@S is reasonable|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: asking about the q@h lead, and 7@h now, |pg||
nt|pelu: in board 49 NS found the way to 2@S - but Gu didn't find the winning line - so only +1 imp|pg||

pc|s3|nt|hedyg: about the 1@s bid?|pg||

nt|andyv:  and only thing i was wondering was whether to bid 2@S or 2@D over 1N with the S hand|pg||
nt|gosia: for those who watched Women's trials I learned the hard way|pg||

nt|vbman: fine only double dummy|pg||
nt|ady: need to play 5 of a minor  here|pg||
nt|andyv:  just cashed @cs I guess|pg||
nt|cindy:  so what is the verdict on his correct bid ?|pg||
mb|1N|an|Forcing|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Milgrim is going to be tortured here|pg||
nt|3for3: yummy hand for milgrim here|pg||
nt|3for3: his @H's are better|pg||
nt|finch: another bidding challenge, this time for NS - to get to exactly 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|barnets: 43 imps with 38 boards to go just 1 per board|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 3@D both majors FG an exceptionally useful piece of system when you have this hand.|pg||
nt|ady: south will avoid no-trumps one partner has shown both minors|pg||
nt|gosia: must play Aces Scientific 3@c forcing raise|pg||
nt|gosia: I like it as it frees up a natural forcing 2NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 2 way jacoby|pg||
nt|gosia: that's seems silly - never heard of it ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  5! exclusion?|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: Shi in the tank :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2n=4 trump and 16+hcp|pg||
nt|gosia: 2nt natural and forcing over 1 of a suit is so comfortable :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mtvesuvius: I bet he will be forced to make at least 2 bids, if not more|pg||
nt|finch: South could have temporised with 3@S which would also get the job done, but this is probably simpler|pg||
nt|ady: east is going to be on lead   so 5 will bed the limit    there will not be a wrong lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@C=4 trumps and 12-15 hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: but he surely doesn't want to be raised|pg||
nt|cindy:  W has a difficult hand to bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: I believe they agreed that 2@s should be opened systematically for them.|pg||
nt|cindy:  ok|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: IN 4th chair specifically***|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: 2@c to not encourage pard|pg||
nt|hedyg: should have bid his major|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: now he has to pass and accept whatever happens|pg||
nt|andyv:  some flip it around|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|tylere: looks to be -2, no?|pg||
nt|3for3: nothing too terrible|pg||
nt|hedyg: wishing he had bid @hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: or that E had bid!!|pg||
nt|3for3: not clear, 2@H made have raised all the way to game|pg||
pc|c9|nt|3for3: this has the merit of being undoubled|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2 down it looks like, so 3 IMPs to Diamond|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  seems like E/W are making this more complicated than it needs to be|pg||
nt|gosia: lack of @d q will encourage East|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d shift and chances to defeat|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tylere: somewhat surprised east didn't X, actually. 2NT with the points split 20-0 rarely plays well|pg||
nt|3for3: they need a win 5 for the wheel|pg||
nt|gosia: kickback with a void ?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cindy:  dont think they can make this|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|hlortz: no big swings but all to ew|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|hedyg: he must have been happy with the contract|pg||
nt|ady: this hand should not take long|pg||
nt|gosia: right W denied @d control|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|barnets: declarer will start spades with low towards the J in case north has 4 to the Q|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cindy:  probably will play S for the long clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4!@C, 1@D, 3@H  and 1@S|pg||
pc|dT|nt|raghavan: W can get 3H, 1D, 1S and 3Club |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  interesting auction to get to right spot and maybe our first push board of the set|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: luckily @D break|pg||

pc|s9|nt|3for3: aker will need to cash out|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|3for3: he will get squeezed if he plys for more|pg||
pc|hK|nt|raghavan: must get his S sooner |pg||

nt|ralfwil: but well played to try @h before a possible @c finess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: good play for 4@S - but down on @S-lead from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: They missed their game here, let's see if Greco-Hampson can find it|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS vulnerable..|pg||
nt|hlortz: chance for another pickup if they bid 4@s|pg||
nt|tylere: 2NT by W?|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is what Parker bid|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Even a pass by Greco would be a pickup|pg||
nt|hedyg: i want to double for penalties!!|pg||
nt|tylere: Greco wishiing he played Fishbein right about now |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: lol, Fishbein :)|pg||
nt|3for3: not clear how many tricks they would gather on defense though|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Fishbein against any pre-empt from a Junior can be a very valuable agreement|pg||
nt|tylere: (Playing Fishbein, X would be penatly, and 2@S takeout, for those unfamiliar)|pg||
nt|3for3: I'd bet North would emerge with 6|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: west is thinking hard|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: i bet he is!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Well, this will be interesting|pg||
nt|andyv:  N/S seem to want to flirt with trouble in this set.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Down 3 probably|pg||
nt|raghavan: They made 3NT in OR|pg||
nt|raghavan: HK was the lead|pg||
mb|2N|nt|finch: South close betwen 1@S and 2@S, but with both opponents bidding he knows he'll get another go if necessary|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4@S now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or 4@C?|pg||
nt|pelu: interestig - if S open 1@C - would u overcall 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H   makes e/w     but should not be bid   needs good trump position plus diamond finesse|pg||
nt|finch: East may well drive game... he's got a pretty tempting hand opposite a 1@D opening|pg||
nt|gosia: I play that's a fit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: believe south play a strong 1@c as part of their canope type system|pg||
nt|pelu: I would not - never Jxxxx - but..|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hedyg: he will play his tops|pg||
nt|andyv:  still down 2... good thing no one could dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: but East not at all interested|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mtvesuvius: Cash 2@d and underlead the @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably. I like an early action before balancing|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|cindy:  friendly hand though|pg||
nt|raghavan: thinkg of slam Kath?|pg||
nt|barnets: i dont think a singleton spade lead is likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: as West?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not after I bid like that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: It looks as if double followed by 2@H was either intended as forcing, and/or West thinks East has a 1534 type hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: up to partner now|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure not - but then 4@S can make|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tylere: A@C out a @C works too, at this point|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: n says they play sound 2s|pg||
nt|hedyg: he sure has a sound 2!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: argument has just breaken out about the system|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: broken out*|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: disagreements about 3@d etc. before the lead|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|finch: for the double.  This is all very murky, I'm not embarrassed to say I've never discussed exactly this auction|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|mtvesuvius: Imagine if he has a "Weak" 2 :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3 down for 4 more imps|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is what Greco was hoping for|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This is going to be an exciting finish|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW fighting hard for every imp|pg||
nt|3for3: normally these would be 'dull' hands, but when you know every imp counts...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, this is not a matter of claim = :)|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mtvesuvius: Greco will get his 9@h also, and -3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: less than 50% because @D have to behave|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  lucky to lose only 2 imps|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
pc|dA|nt|finch: 4@H is better than it might otherwise be as the diamond finesse is likely to be right|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|mtvesuvius: 3 IMP difference now|pg||
nt|hedyg: scraping, scraping..|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: 9@H  makes 4@H  better   can play for hearts 3-3   or doubleton honor in either hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|tylere: not one I'd really want to be in|pg||

nt|vbman: ozdil must be predicting the state of the match not so bright fr |pg||

pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: always a dilemma now whether to show the 5 card major |pg||
nt|yo_yo: you were right Rag |pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx rare |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|finch: 2NT often played as a relay, particularly if you like raising with 3-card support frequently|pg||
nt|finch: 4@S likely to show a maximum weak NT with 4 trumps|pg||
nt|andyv:  wrong sided the contract|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: will east play the king?|pg||
nt|finch: that's a storming lead.  I was expecting a diamond which makes life fairly easy for declarer|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk4: You need a few things to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c=?|pg||
nt|cindy:  dont see 8 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so 1@S is 5 or 4 with another 5 card suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Shi pulled out the 4@h put it back and elected for the diamond, good choice :)|pg||

nt|finch: yes, and another club on the jack of hearts|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gosia: E should lead a trump anyway if the other way|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: Ekeblad has left the table for a smoke break, dummy is vacant|pg||
nt|ralfwil: one loss in every suit =9 tricks|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: Why the alert then?|pg||

nt|vugraphu4: s says balk|pg||

mb|d|nt|mtvesuvius: 2@c could be set 1 I think on perect defense|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: perfect*|pg||
nt|hedyg: Hampson praying for a rebid by S|pg||
mb|1S!|an|3+ spades|nt|mtvesuvius: Nice decision by Milgrim|pg||
nt|gosia: dejavu once again|pg||
nt|andyv:  balance with E hand?|pg||
nt|cindy:  ok|pg||
nt|cindy:  still  ....|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: I have to admit, I'd be tempted to bid 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: the good ole' tortured pass accompanied with a deep sigh :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  not this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: This will probably be -1 also... which means that Rogoff gets 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|finch: 4@H asking South to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: n/s     3@S   |pg||
nt|mcarroll: @Ss a bit anaemic to balance?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and price was steep|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i guess Shi is showing 4@S?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|raghavan: what a Spade suit |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  + value of K@h dropped considerably|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: fairly normal to bid game opposite a strong NT and find out if it makes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H lead now|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|ady: should be 1 too high   though east must switch to a heart|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|finch: no hurry to switch to a heart yet, can still do so later|pg||
nt|vbman: not this1|pg||
nt|ady: yes  with only 2 clubs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mtvesuvius: Best to keep on playing trumps here|pg||
nt|hlortz: they - rogoff may finally score imps this set!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Since the less they have the ability to ruff your winners the better|pg||
nt|cindy:  good dbl|pg||
nt|cindy:  they are doomed now|pg||
nt|cindy:  but which @h to lead ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a good double till they rex for blood...|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|cindy:  hmm|pg||
nt|raghavan: what happened no H lead|pg||
nt|cindy:  i would be afraid my partner would kill me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: me too|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: ekeblad asked about 4 questions about the bidding, then plopped out the 2 of @c|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did he not see partner's double?|pg||
nt|cindy:  can he see his partner's face ?  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: 99% sure he saw the double, no, screens prevent that :)|pg||
nt|barnets: east will have to make 2 discards on the hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if I bid 1nt in this sequence I show 18-20 - do you agree?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: undo!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: many problems   here    3rd diamond to look after as well|pg||
nt|vbman: d1?|pg||
nt|ady: cant see much better than hope spade king onside  and breaking   draw trumps|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|cindy:  i used to have a partner that i could hear sighing on the other side of the screen|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hlortz: needs to give pard a@c ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  at other table, E was fearless, bid @ss twice even though S was able to show both suits naturally|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|barnets: I think so easy when we see partners hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I was about to say that the strong club would save E from the 2NT opening when N bid1@H, so it actually triggered the 2NT evaluation of the hand, much to W's disgust|pg||
pc|d6|nt|3for3: must cash ace, exit trump now, i think|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He has to cash the @d now otherwise he'll be endplayed|pg||
nt|hlortz: that 9 may look suit pref for fatal @h shift|pg||
nt|hedyg: if S had a singleton @d he would not have played it with that @s holding|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|raghavan: so here also 1 down|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|3for3: the 9 of clubs showed hearts, but partner needs really good ones to break them with |pg||
nt|3for3: his holding|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: lost the play, all the sudden he decided to go machine gun speed on me :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: debbie Rosenberg was saying yesterday that her husband often doesnt see bids in the tray|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|mtvesuvius: Now the @s exit and they will just get the A@D now|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d9|pg||

pc|hA|pc|s3|nt|barnets: not pretty|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|mtvesuvius: Tough defense to find|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: So only 1 IMP for Rogoff|pg||
nt|hedyg: esp after the 9@c|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes eaasier from up here :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||

nt|Vugraphu4: well, sorry about my %|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Matt is there a discussion about the lead?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|hedyg: so 4 imps and 5 bds to go|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: part  score hand   likely 1NT   n/s      or maybe 2@C   |pg||
nt|finch: Ozdil might have made a (light) take-out double over 1@C, which would have got the heart fit into the game|pg||
nt|finch: Now Lair is confused by having a singleton diamond and long clubs|pg||
nt|vbman: now must be praying for protection|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: could be dangerous  to bid|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: lucky drop of J10@c|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and that will give declarer 7 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N shows @ss?|pg||
nt|barnets: best leat and a trump back|pg||
nt|barnets: declarer booked to down 2 or 3 again|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|3for3: surround play of the 9@D there|pg||
nt|hlortz: but will declarer go for @D without unblocking @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: that will work now|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah def has attacked those|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: he may, and the T@D gives him that option|pg||
nt|hlortz: rite|pg||
nt|finch: with a short club on his left and opponents clearly light on high cards, he deduces that partner must have club length|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vbman: a partnertship need study a lot for this|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mtvesuvius: Now he can unblock the clubs and play a @d to dummy for =|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s can get close to 3N here |pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: trying for a @s as 7th trick|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, and Hampson can no longer knock out his @d entry, since then he will establish declarer's @d suit|pg||
nt|don paulus: saved by the bell|pg||
nt|finch: either that or he meant 2@C as the majors|pg||
nt|ady: south might have made a discretionary pass of 2@C    |pg||
nt|finch: South now entering the confusion zone|pg||
nt|andyv:  overtrick time|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 1N did show spades... ty Matt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with best defence -3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gosia: which way to play the @s Peter's thinking|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hedyg: J@H now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: W can overtake |pg||
nt|ady: turned a good plus into a minus|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|finch: 2@C might also have been intended as clubs and another|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: lair asked if any agreement on 2@c, said they don't have a specific agreement|pg||
nt|barnets: The 1SJ would have been bettter|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|finch: nothing like the quarterfinals of the trials for inventing new system (!)|pg||
nt|ady: whatever it meant  south should have realised 2@C undoubled would be a decent score  and left well alone|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a nice comfortable contract|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  peter looking for 9th trick in case E has @cK|pg||
nt|gosia: why wd he duck ?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|finch: Depends a bit on the NS methods, if North could be e.g. 3442 then EW have nowhere to go|pg||
nt|vbman: after cl q the hand will become an open  book|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s suit dead now|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||

nt|don paulus: H blocked|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Mike Passell|pg||
nt|3for3: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|ady: as east passed    clearly there was no agreement       anyway   n/s as it happens have not been damaged|pg||
nt|finch: if they haven't discussed this auction, then I can't see what the TD is expected to do about it|pg||
nt|passell: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi Mike|pg||
nt|finch: playing with screens (I assume) so no question of reading anything from alerts/lack thereof|pg||
nt|passell: king of spades shift would have given declarer a losing option|pg||
nt|3for3: I am always somewhat bothered when one makes a conventional call, and then they say 'no agreement'....|pg||
nt|3for3: not clear what 2@C was though, even looking at it!|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Correct, 5 IMPs, but the crucial board is coming up... We'll see :)|pg||
nt|gosia: main reason I won't play club system|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h and/or 3@c will have some followers|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|finch: those heart pips come in very useful for EW|pg||
nt|yo_yo: bergen  ?|pg||
nt|cindy:  needs the @cK lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: alerted 4@s 10-13|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Bergen not too popular in UK|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 5 IMPs difference that is|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4 black losers|pg||
mb|3H|an|!|nt|don paulus: makes even with H lead ?|pg||
nt|ady: this presents no problems|pg||
nt|vbman: y|pg||
nt|andyv:  E @h spots are so poor, should have treated it as a 4 card suit.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|barnets: now  west has shown strong heart suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: 2@S was asking|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  did the J deny higher ?|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: A natural lead|pg||
nt|barnets: had west a very strong balanced hand he would have bid 2N after the 2@S call|pg||
nt|barnets: a system devised by eric  Kokish|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: weichsel has gone to the restroom|pg||
nt|barnets: interesting heart suit|pg||
nt|barnets: the way to guarantee 1 loser would be to pass the @H8 or H 10 |pg||
nt|ralfwil: no slam yet, but another 2 boards to go|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: k, he's back here we go|pg||
nt|barnets: but it will cost an imp far more often than it will gain a game |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|3for3: The match may well hinge on 59, a potential slam for EW|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Vugraphu4: J@h lead announced as natural should have none higher|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bergan - has variations - usual 3c = 7-10 with 4cd support - 3D is 11-12 with 4cd - so they might have modified|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gosia: Welland finished anyone know the score ?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: could do if a big heart  honor was transfered to north and a@C to south|pg||
nt|3for3: cash it or lose it|pg||
nt|barnets: a spec has told me normal play goes down 2 percnet of the time|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|passell: take the ace|pg||
nt|3for3: i think he has a fair idea too|pg||
nt|barnets: so passing the @H 10 would gain 20 imps and lose 50 in a hundred hands|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h6|nt|3for3: well done|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gosia: 66-30 to Welland|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|hedyg: had to play @c, not @H|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|gosia: we've had lots of excitement here - but leveled out |pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 1 imp to Ozdil|pg||
nt|gosia: he's down 1 at least |pg||
nt|andyv:  agree...@h spots even worse the 2nd time I looked at them:)|pg||
nt|gosia: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 5-0 in N = 2%?|pg||

nt|3for3: 1 nebulous @D|pg||
nt|3for3: the age old question, should west choose 4@H or 3nt here....when partner gives choice of games|pg||
nt|gosia: I hate to say 2 routine boards coming up ...|pg||
mb|2H|nt|3for3: I am a NT guy|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  as a spec points out, E/W may well be getting desperate.|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: if he shows his shortness...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i am told last bd will be flat|pg||
nt|3for3: then they will be off to the races|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@h is 11-13 Bal|pg||
pc|h3|nt|3for3: right, and he is max and prime|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gosia: After Board 30 play will resume tomorrow at 10 Am EST|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we like 1NT with a 6 card minor?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hlortz: 2@S some sort of relay...|pg||
nt|finch: if partner offers me a choice of games, I usually pick 4@H with support|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|cindy:  i like it ok here|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Q@c Rusinow|pg||
nt|cindy:  not good enough to jump in @ds|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|raghavan: good tempo for declarer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nice lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|3for3: this could be it|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@s is probably shortness|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes skipped the relay|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fleisher defeated Cohler and Ozdil won against Jacobs. The losers into the repechage for the USA2 berth|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Same happens to the loser in this match|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No info regarding the other matches, sorry|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c surely would be cuebid now|pg||
nt|3for3: meltzer had a big lead|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: w is back in his chair pondering|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=27&Itemid=224  for the tournament website and the complicated format|pg||
nt|finch: even looking at both hands it's not totally obvious which is the better game|pg||
nt|3for3: I prefer for partners to bid out there patterns with other than 5332...which may influence that choice too|pg||
nt|passell: I usually do also  but not this one|pg||
nt|finch: although looking at all 4 hands both contracts will make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and still no slam|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: It takes about 15 lawyers to interpret just half of it|pg||
nt|3for3: going into 4th quarter|pg||
nt|ady: west with 4-3-3-3   and high cards in all suits has opted for 3NT rather than 4@H|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Results after 3 Quarters: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2009/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
nt|hedyg: does this deny a @c cue?|pg||
nt|tylere: well, we're not stopping in 3N...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@d is probably RKC, but I'm not sure|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: or show 1|pg||
nt|finch: South has a nasty single dummy problem.  Playing the 9 is right on this layout|pg||
nt|passell: The 3 jacks look like nt cards|pg||
pc|h8|nt|finch: but less successful if partner has AK752|pg||

nt|tylere: I'm not certain the last board will be flat|pg||
nt|hedyg: obviously for E it denied a @c cue|pg||
nt|3for3: 2 more to rogoff....|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe one should not take the excitement away from specs by revealing anything|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: e is explaining that 4c would have been a q by w|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: he would have happily cuebid @H otherwise|pg||
