mb|4C|an|alert|mb|p|mb|4D|an|alert|nt|ahollan1: real key from Sasha's point of view is the @D suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: Key Card now|pg||
nt|daman: Moss team in 6@S on Board 81 in CR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C from Pollack as Exclusion would be great treatment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sasha can't ask -- needs to know way too much that KC won't tell her|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: we have Closed Room up now|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: redouble or 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: superfluous dbl -- gives NS more room to sort things out|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moss in Closed Room bid the 6@S on board 81|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: 5@C already said -- no @C loser -- Pollack worried about a) trump  b) missing grand|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|mariner1: now S has to sort of guess about N's @S quality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like 5@D too george -- but more because Pollack KNOWS Cohen can't cue in red suit|pg||
nt|daman: missed a big chance to put the opps away|pg||
nt|daman: if they bid the grand in the CR     watch out|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 13 tricks not certain -- need good things to happen in a red suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and decent trump split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and guess which good thing happened :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: so for the puritans, just a question of whether 6@S arrived at convincingly or not -- which gets an extra 5 points :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al no style points?|pg||
nt|daman: my guess is if you were in 7 and had to play it wide open?  you would end up making on a high crossruff after pitching @Ds on the @Hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a sure line for 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well most lines work|pg||
nt|daman: and ruffing @Cs along the way    East cannot get out of her own way on the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure george -- that seems to rely upon @H 33  surely better to try @D first|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|daman: they are in 7 in the other room|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|cherdano:  as the cards lie this is an easy make but the best line is not clear to me here|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he is only missing 4 @S however AQJ9 are a worry on N holds too many|pg||
nt|cherdano:  may @CA, ruff club, spade up|pg||
nt|mariner1: if N holds|pg||
nt|mariner1: he has to think N has K@C also.........|pg||
nt|cindy:  could be thinking he could be getting bad trump split on the bidding|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes a lot to worry about in this hand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  @CA, @C ruff, spade up?|pg||
nt|mariner1: and of course N might hold short @D,,,,, we can see all of that is not an issue|pg||
nt|cherdano:  I assume you mean S?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well knowing K@H likely in N too he can try the @D to dummy and a @S back|pg||
nt|mariner1: he might reason N has no convenient exit card|pg||
nt|cherdano:  that risks a diamond ruff though|pg||
nt|mariner1: no I mean IF N had 3@S then he could have short @D........|pg||
nt|cherdano:  a takeout double with 3=4=1=5?|pg||
nt|cindy:  well...if ruffing @d, then ruffing in long trump hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: and S having short @D is also a possibility|pg||

nt|mariner1: same, add points and spades to get to 15 to open|pg||
nt|mariner1: so  a support REDBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Rob phrase better -- note to make, since Support DBL/RDBL originally invented for use in context of Strong Club system - some 2/1 players play support DBL but NOT support ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 83 Moss gained 10 back as the @S game was not found|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: I was thinking they might find the A@C lead to beat 4....... no chance though on 83|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: the idea is that in context of big club - opener never holds strong hand, but in 2/1 maybe big hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: S in a fix here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cohen not opening has really made things difficult for Pollack|pg||
