nt|ady: 11 easy tricks in hearts for e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|ady: just a case of not getting overboard|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: started with big club by E|pg||
nt|sybarra: looking for a cue of @C or real @S cue by W |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: essentially duplicated distribution.  Another @H in west and one fewer @C and this would be laydown.  Now question is if methods can determine this|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|sybarra: we are assuming an alert missed re the @H bid, meaning spades |pg||
nt|othered1: guess not.  This is essentially a no-play slam unless defense does sonething like try to cash 2@S.|pg||
nt|sybarra: E will be dummy so no change of that |pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: every bid was alerted except 6H - I do not have the explanations|pg||
nt|sybarra: no Steve |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: I meant NP steve|pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1: With singleton in dummy, pretty tough to go wrong in @S.  Nice of EW to clarify that|pg||

nt|dcbutler: hello everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Hand David and all Mike here from rainy Reading|pg||
nt|lestergold: west with an excellent hand will be looking for something better than a part score but i dont think there is anythingt|pg||
nt|daman: here we go|pg||
nt|daman: segment 7 of 8|pg||
nt|daman: semi-finals   USBC |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Also welcome to Arend Bayer|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Arend|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Wiilie here again. Hi to all and enjoy the match.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 3nt on EW|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and all cards are on side |pg||

nt|haans: hi doctor|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hi All :)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: West is Billy Cohen, and South is Larry Cohen|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back to white plains ny |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Willie here again; hi to all and enjoy the match.|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi willie :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  hello everyone|pg||
nt|haans: hi goeffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Wc all kibits|pg||
nt|daman: leading to selsct USA 1|pg||
nt|jstokes: Hi Doc, Hans|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: not want Welland wants to hear|pg||
nt|haans: natural bidding by both pairs|pg||
nt|lestergold: a non vul wjs|pg||
nt|lestergold: at least it will warn him off game|pg||
nt|cherdano:  quite a powerful hand for a weak 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hello all  |pg||
nt|lestergold: exciting hnad but this will be a push|pg||
nt|joest: hi all|pg||
nt|daman: hey Jack|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|daman: hi Panja|pg||
nt|daman: wonder if South will bid 3@C|pg||
nt|joest: i think that is a good lead directing effort|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: start with an easy 4@S|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: welcome back to Whilte Plains NY |pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: If opp miss taking C it will disappear making 5 |pg||
nt|cindy:  hi all|pg||
nt|raghavan: making 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: will make 5 |pg||
nt|daman: hoping partner has a decent @S suit|pg||
nt|daman: McCabe Adjunct|pg||
nt|joest: would you boost to game as east?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: should make the 8 spades is an enormous card|pg||
nt|daman: they tend to have the goods when they open a weak 2 in first seat|pg||
nt|cherdano:  well apparently Weinstein also thinks he has extras|pg||
nt|haans: 9 hcp good body 3nt close?|pg||
nt|roswolf: a straightforward game which might make 12|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: hi shirley. should i be moe or larry? wait, wrong trio, sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Willie here again. Hi to all and enjoy.|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Willie :) |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi willie & shirley & specs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fortunately, Michael is a far better player than speller (see his profile card)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Willie will fix |pg||
nt|daman: the hesitation is not with North I suspect|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: same lead in the other room,  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx willie|pg||
nt|sybarra: both N's provided a good lead director  (just kidding)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: sorry about that..was in a hurry and started a bit late; needed to catch up.|pg||
nt|onebid: ask you know who - Bart said all|pg||
nt|daman: volunteering a minus|pg||
nt|daman: Robinson will figure East has a 2 suiter for his bidding and will give his partner a couple of ruffs|pg||
nt|cherdano:  so this should be -2|pg||
nt|daman: I suspect so|pg||
nt|jstokes: now should be easy to reach the making 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hi judy|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: EW play a 2/1 with Strong NT and NS play a Strong @c and 14-16/15-17 NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: slam not all that bad but not sure one should be in it |pg||
nt|haans: no @H lead ca play 7|pg||
nt|roswolf: a 4@D cue MIGHT BE INTERESTING|pg||
nt|haans: 4@D may be mantatory|pg||
nt|haans: mandatory|pg||
nt|roswolf: but missing an ace and q of trumps probably discretion will be the better part of valour|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think N has to cue |pg||
nt|haans: belive they stop at 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: are we still alive and kicking operator?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Willie here again; hi to all and enjoy the match.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|joest: close call nv knowing a club lead is coming|pg||
nt|daman: difficult not to boost once partner bids|pg||
nt|raghavan: Texas transfer  4D to 4H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I do´nt like this transfer. why not check 3nt?|pg||
nt|jstokes: 4@H is ok as well|pg||
nt|haans: looks like a make|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1 with a @c lead|pg||
nt|haans: soon on nt basis|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: NS's CC: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=407&pid=111|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: EW's CC: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=567&pid=109|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: np, just kidding|pg||
nt|joest: after two high clubs and a low one, garner has a problem|pg||
nt|haans: singel|pg||
nt|raghavan: difficulty-2S +1D+1club losers|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This doesn't have much play, 1@s 2@h and at least 1@c loser|pg||
nt|sybarra: think N in the tank |pg||
pc|s7|nt|panja: ruff high, finesse @D, back with a trump, another finesse..if the third club is high|pg||
nt|panja: @h at trick two might give decl more trouble|pg||
nt|joest: right you need to know if diamond king onside|pg||
nt|panja: well, you hope..|pg||
nt|joest: a trump on the go might have been better but who would not lead partner's lead director?|pg||
nt|joest: true|pg||
nt|daman: bad for partnership morale if you do that|pg||
nt|panja: well...N has @S and @D, partner bid Clubs, why not a trump lead?|pg||
nt|joest: just pointed out ot me that if AKQ of clubs on the right and rho is a passed hand, then diamond king must be on|pg||
nt|joest: Woolsey on his way to one down in 4@h in the open room if I read the position right|pg||
nt|roswolf: obviously yes|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: three spades and a bullet for n/s thats all|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Cohen's 8@d is Suit Preference for @h|pg||
pc|d2|nt|raghavan: Judy, cindy|pg||
nt|haans: do you agree with that bidding?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: sign off in 5@S !?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: not a happy contract|pg||
nt|xenya: W responded on minimum values and E overbid a little|pg||
nt|roswolf: north still there!?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Strul is thinking hard now.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|raghavan: If he plays D, he will get ruff|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: and hating to pass......|pg||
nt|roswolf: he really had to accept pard's view|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree |pg||
nt|sybarra: can not go overruling,  (even though right this time)|pg||
nt|sybarra: +2 seems like a lot,  so maybe an imp at stake here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: no lead as yet - this is going to be a long stanza|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jstokes: yes, the ruff now will beat it --and there you go|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and the 6-1@d split will really doom this|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cindy:  hi all|pg||
nt|joest: i guess panja b/c these things are easier to see looking at all four hands than in real life: plus the chance  a third round of clubs might bring your @h10 into play|pg||
nt|panja: @S and @D he is looking at, @C bid he heard...nothing based on all four hands|pg||
nt|panja: this is not one of those things that is a double dummy idea|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: some specs may question the TO double, but NS probably play the style of "equal level conversion", which means that S can double and then bid diamonds without showing a great hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes along predicted line|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Since this is USA2, the losers of this match are out, and the Winners will advance to play the winners of the Nickell-Jacobs match|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi all|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|xenya: on almost any split , he must lose a trump, 2 @Hs and a club|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: as it is, BC will do well to get out for down 2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|panja: still, it is just an idea, I am not suggesting that @C lead is wrong, just that trump thought is possible|pg||
nt|joest: diamond hook and club ruff|pg||
nt|daman: meckwell are in 4@S doubled with the NS cards|pg||
nt|joest: 10 possible imps for Welland|pg||
nt|joest: cannot affor to cash anothe trump because after ruffing a diamond and ruffing a club you would have to fatally tap dummy to return|pg||
nt|joest: hook the diamond, ruff a club|pg||
nt|daman: he has a count on North's hand pretty well|pg||
nt|joest: then ace of spades ruff a spade|pg||
nt|daman: unless he falscarded in trumps|pg||
nt|joest: then a low diamond|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mtvesuvius: The loser of the Fleisher-Robinson match will get another chance also... They would play the winner of the winner of this match vs the winner of the other USA2 match... It's a ...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: whole complicated mess really :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cherdano:  so due to the @DQ play, East escaped for -1|pg||
nt|daman: yep|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|joest: i think that works|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: tough hand|pg||
nt|joest: but at some point he will need to duck a diamond|pg||
nt|panja: so, essentially, secure low ruffs and then duck a Diamond...|pg||
nt|joest: at this point he could ruff a spade|pg||
nt|joest: ruff a club|pg||
nt|panja: but then, could @HT be a falsecard?|pg||
nt|daman: unlikely|pg||
nt|joest: then duck the diamond|pg||
nt|joest: that is pretty could stroking |pg||
nt|joest: good|pg||
nt|joest: I think garner is playing the ten as a true card or he wouldn't be taking this long|pg||
pc|h5|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|panja: but then, even if @HT is a falsecard, @D would be 33 in that case, @C ruff, @SA and ruff and then small @D is good|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Cindy|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Peg Kaplan|pg||
nt|roswolf: really|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi roland|pg||

nt|pbundy: some of you may know - i was able to kibitz "live" for a few days in the earlier stages|pg||
nt|pbundy: very exciting|pg||
nt|pbundy: and two of these players are among the first people i ever met in bridge:  howie weinstein and steve garner|pg||
nt|pbundy: both MN boys a while back|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: thats better|pg||
nt|pbundy: garner/weinstein surely have had a most successful partnership|pg||

nt|raghavan: Intesting hans are up Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: basically a 50% non vul slam|pg||
nt|pbundy: Hi Roland - specs|pg||
nt|pbundy: I just came from a photographic journey to white plains - MUCH excitement there, as you can imagine|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hans I do not agree with bidding|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: All the Cohens get confusing here|pg||
nt|xenya: a small consolation is that 3@S also fails -- and it's not easy to stop lower|pg||
mb|1C|nt|onebid: Hi everyone - I'll stay until another commentator shows up|pg||
nt|lestergold: welcome Judy|pg||
nt|onebid: Hi Cindy, Dr. R|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ok Judy |pg||
nt|daman: West passed in the OR|pg||
nt|haans: nope dont understand it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s is a good contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a swing possibility then|pg||
nt|cindy:  im sure they have a way to show both majors   4@d perhaps|pg||
nt|dcbutler: hi peg|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Peg|pg||
nt|pbundy: Hi Dave - Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland slam here|pg||
nt|jstokes: not hard to envision a hand with weaker spades where 4@H is right -- not this hand, however|pg||
nt|raghavan: He could have bid transfer to H and bid 3NT which W will leave and make|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or check so partner can show his @s|pg||
nt|haans: direct 4@S now|pg||
nt|haans: maybe a little to strong|pg||
nt|jstokes: way too strong for me|pg||
nt|pbundy: i'm not certain what stansby/martel NT range is ... i know that it is variable|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: 3dims does the job|pg||
nt|cindy:  many use 3@d to ask for a @d stopper|pg||
nt|onebid: maybe 4@D a bit of a push at equal non-vul?|pg||
nt|cindy:  with a long club suit|pg||
nt|daman: I think they play Flannery|pg||
nt|joest: I can attest that east-west LOVE 2@d openers|pg||
nt|joest: this is a transfer to 3@c|pg||
nt|joest: either a lead director or about to play it in clubs|pg||
nt|raghavan: no his hand is power house after P openshe will go slow |pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Hans - with 2 kings and a singleton @c|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and that is where they are playing in the OR|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be tasty|pg||
nt|cindy:  i would count that as 15|pg||
nt|pbundy: in fact - once i was the victim of one forgetting and driving to a game on few HCP that happened to have the virtue of making|pg||
mb|4H|nt|raghavan: transfer to spades - I|pg||
mb|d|nt|cindy:  pretty good hand|pg||
nt|onebid: I do Cindy|pg||
nt|joest: Wildavsky can bid a 'direct' or 'delayed' 3@h|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2NT is 21-22|pg||
nt|roswolf: south - a quiet axe|pg||
nt|pbundy: i think that we are missing a pass here?|pg||
nt|cindy:  dont think this is right|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: this is how i generally handle my nine card suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: only needs club finesse and dim q dropping too good for roland but too bad for these nasty cards|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes, i would upgrade the hand myself, cindy|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: every reason to make a try |pg||
nt|lestergold: even game is off|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes he will take his 100's|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I prefer a 4@c - cue|pg||
nt|cindy:  4@s ?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|raghavan: good forward going|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Cindy|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: now ahe know a finesse at worst |pg||
nt|pbundy: garner may be tempted to go on to 5@H|pg||
nt|pbundy: his two aces might be his side's only tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  on their way|pg||
nt|haans: 4@D mantatory|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and I would assume Berkowitz upgraded :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: but will still lose imps|pg||
nt|pbundy: and - he knows that 5@H would be cheap......|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: seems reasonable|pg||
nt|jstokes: Willenken cooperating but he has a really awful hand for spades|pg||
nt|xenya: and rightly so|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: without any ace, the double is a bit too light|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: yep hes got lucky!|pg||
nt|onebid: or could have had K@S and no aces|pg||
nt|cindy:  im a big believer in leading aces vs small slams|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 4d bid was pointless by west|pg||
nt|onebid: agree Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: only helped them on their way|pg||
nt|cindy:  spec points out they heard that yesterday :-)|pg||
nt|onebid: I meant K trump|pg||
nt|cindy:  would think W wouldnt bid 4@d unless he wanted the lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: Only way is to finesse S - It succeeds here|pg||
nt|joest: but let me ask you this: if it went 3@d pass pass back to you would you be happy you'd passed?|pg||
nt|joest: if Weinstein goes up ace, Wildavsky may drop the queen|pg||
nt|cindy:  i dont understand much of this auction :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: perhaps martel has shown much longer diamonds, as he bid them first rather than spades|pg||
nt|pbundy: i don't think people do support doubles at the 4 level :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|raghavan: E wants a Spade lead ? Mike|pg||
nt|xenya: by contrast, this plays pretty well|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cindy:  how does he know to bid at all ?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|cindy:  at least they have the fear factor in their favor|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame west for bnidding it and will probabbly be a push |pg||
pc|dK|nt|onebid: preempts exist to make it harder for opponents. Most of the time the damage is done - why get involved. Might push them to slam|pg||
nt|joest: or not|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: W might have ruffed with a higher heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d wa never gonna take up much spade only encourages them |pg||
nt|ralfwil: But I hadn´t opened on E....|pg||
pc|d3|nt|panja: not happy, but 200- has to be weighed against a possible game...and the chance of missing it|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: i handle em as follows i count themand find that there were only eight!|pg||
nt|pbundy: the double isn't for penalty|pg||
nt|cindy:  he is void in @h and his partner doubled|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cindy:  are you sure ?|pg||
nt|pbundy: many play that with a penalty double, you are forced to pass|pg||
nt|pbundy: no; i am not sure!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|raghavan: He cashes seeing D length in dummy|pg||
nt|raghavan: cashes HA|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and it's worth noting that they don't use puppet here, since I assume that all hands with 5 card majors and that strength are opened with a Strong @c|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cindy:  they dont even know whose hand it is|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: space|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: frankly 5d is of course enormous in the 70% plus reion|pg||
nt|joest: g-w on track for +200 here|pg||
nt|joest: garner must have the spade ace|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: not spade|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: The @c suit comes in, and Q@H could drop potentially|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pbundy: yes; not a bad buy in dummy|pg||
nt|joest: if Wildavsky had both aces + hearts he would have bid at once|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse my fingers|pg||
nt|pbundy: and - even with the diamonds not breaking, still on a club hook|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pbundy: i certainly didn't think this happened!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: well if he didnt buy something in dummy then north south would have almost certainly had a game|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: welcome debbie|pg||
nt|cindy:  i know that feeling :-)|pg||
nt|raghavan: may be in 4S -push|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: hello welcome debbie |pg||
nt|debrose: Thank you.  |pg||
nt|lestergold: im already very fat|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very comfortable 3n for n/s here|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  hey debbie :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: so i know it well|pg||
nt|panja: B93, 3Nt does not seem to be all that easy...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like majors |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am the token male in this event|pg||
nt|daman: I think so too|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: yes - tho i would be slightly tempted to open this hand 1@D rather than 1NT|pg||
nt|pbundy: i believe that 1@D promises at least 2 diamonds and generally a somewhat unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|pbundy: this pair opens 1@C on many balanced hands without a five card major|pg||
nt|cindy:  2@c 4sf now i guess ?|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course, e/w is hoping that the Great Shuffler has given them a pile of fairly flat hands :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: not sure; i know in my partnerships, we play that 3@H would be forcing|pg||
nt|pbundy: we'll have to see what weinstein comes up with|pg||
mb|3H|an|forcing|nt|lestergold: 4h i agree at this vul|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 1 = In open room, EW stopped in 3H making so 5 IMP|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: some chance of missing a major suit game if partner has 7 or 8 and passes 1NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: even double dummy clubs lead cant dent it|pg||
nt|dcbutler: problem is that gets you to 2N opposite pard's 6 count with no major|pg||
nt|lestergold: however probably will only make it on the nose|pg||
nt|pbundy: that is true|pg||
nt|cindy:  ok  they play that forcing also|pg||
nt|pbundy: ah ha; a treatment after my own heart!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|debrose: Presumably 2@C shows majors.  I  recommend using a defenses to 1N which include 2@C for majors, rather than 2@D or 2@H as so many do|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: what's the advantage of using 2C for the majors?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5h only costs 500|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west has some defence|pg||
nt|onebid: and a flat hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5s now  cold|pg||
nt|raghavan: CQ falls|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Literally!|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: This allows advancer to bid 2@D with equal length in the majors to allow overcaller to bid the longer suit (or stronger with equal length)|pg||
nt|panja: @s9 might be the best lead|pg||
nt|cherdano:  East has strong desire to suggest NT with this hand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and West is obviously fine with that, having supported with 3@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@C might make here but it's too much to ask for|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: EW usually open soundly, and so if you see agressive bidding later in the auction, that is the reason|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean getting there|pg||
nt|pbundy: truely :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: truly|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi|pg||
nt|pbundy: hi martin :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: nice spade spots for Doub|pg||
nt|joest: eventually it's hearts, his apparently weakest suit, that will ride to his rescue|pg||
nt|daman: this is the best spot|pg||
nt|cherdano:  meanwhile the lead is down to 23 IMPs|pg||
nt|daman: EW are chipping away|pg||
nt|cherdano:  looks like it comes down to the spade guess |pg||
nt|haans: so they did also find hearts :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Getting to 5@s would take some serious overbidding|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 5@c*|pg||
nt|pbundy: i'm not surprised to see garner bid 3NT.  everything about his hand screams "NT"|pg||
nt|cindy:  3N works|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: or heart sets up for club discard in any case|pg||
nt|onebid: hard to see any other result|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes Hans|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Peg, Cindy|pg||
nt|pbundy: indeed it does|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: and another way of avoidin g a club loser!!|pg||
nt|panja: the best @C play should AK and back..but that will lose badly here..but what else is available?|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: -2 probably|pg||
nt|roswolf: assuming a diamond switch now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|daman: exactly|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|onebid: kibs can check movie to see how OR made 4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: of course, if opponents get wise to all that they may just stop opening 1NT :)|pg||
nt|debrose: I'll live with that:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: when Michael gets in, play a spade.|pg||
nt|debrose: Perhaps a question I get asked more than any other from my bridge students is whether to open 1 of a major or 1N with a balanced hand of the right strength|pg||
pc|h9|nt|joest: plenty of time to play clubs later|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: 15-17 no trump south cannto upgrade the hand is maxi but nothying to upgrade and yes occasionally u miss a good major game but not often|pg||
nt|joest: seems to me that Garner has little choice but to play back a heart|pg||
nt|daman: cannot go wrong|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes|pg||
nt|cherdano:  he didnt duck because he was afraid of a @H switch|pg||
nt|roswolf: was the 5 big enough|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|roswolf: no|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|debrose: There are many factors to consider, but I usually open 1N, and I think you'll observe most top level players tend to do so|pg||
nt|debrose: Rosenberg's hand is perhaps the clearest type to open 1N with - the rebid problem over 1@H/1@S is just impossible|pg||
nt|debrose: With 17 pts. one might overbid 2N, and with 15 might underbid 1N.  So with hearts and 16 HCP there is the most reason to open 1N|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: they must agreed on that before bidding :)|pg||
nt|haans: bud in my mind 4@S is a little odd|pg||
nt|raghavan: playing SJ will avoid OT|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes  fit for invitation|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|daman: this is going to roll home    Weinstein just doesn't know it|pg||
nt|cindy:  brb|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pbundy: i once had a partner who rarely opened 1NT with both (decent) majors.  particularly at matchpoints, he had the belief that missing major suit fits cost tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: u open a diamond and ebid 2n and u often over reach urself|pg||
pc|h5|nt|panja: @s8 will surely be covered with the T..and that would endplay Garner|pg||
nt|panja: 8 tricks on top now, Declarer needs only one|pg||
nt|cherdano:  @S8? really?|pg||
nt|daman: @S 8 was strange|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cherdano:  not really - |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: it has its points Peg|pg||
nt|pbundy: well; in theory, if you open 1@D, some fair amount of the time partner will respond in a major|pg||
nt|lestergold: ur view|pg||
nt|pbundy: oh - not even "my" view ... "a" view|pg||
pc|s4|nt|debrose: Of course we'd rather have an stronger doubleton, but such is life.  These days I see a lot of experts opening 1N with a five card major AND two doubletons.   |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my methods i don;t get dealt that hand. or else i just open 1NT whenever it looks like 1NT. somehow it seems to work out|pg||
nt|pbundy: the ten of diamonds and 9 of spades might sway me on this one|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: if i get dealt the rpoblem hand, i say i only have 12 cards. chance of a redeal giving me similar hand is infinitesimal|pg||
nt|raghavan: curtains - made 5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|debrose: I like methods which allow one to choose which hands to be dealt.  Can you send me your system notes please Marshall?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a virwe im sure shared yes|pg||
nt|jstokes: prob with inviting here is that it all depends on the fit; if partner has little in clubs, you want to be in game; vul, I think just bid it|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|xenya: needs trumps 2-2 and @H finesse, basically|pg||
nt|roswolf: a few more imps to welland|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|cindy:  good def|pg||
nt|lestergold: plenty of room for controversy on these hands|pg||

mb|1H|nt|debrose: While generally I tend to be more interested in the cardplay than the bidding, I find I often can't think straight when Michael's in a close match|pg||
nt|joest: we'll see if Wildavsky opens light |pg||
nt|joest: and keeps his opponents out of spades|pg||
nt|panja: EW might pick up a partial swing here|pg||
mb|d|nt|debrose: So I'll just see Cindy say good def and take her word for it :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  it was :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  this is a good 2@s bid too debbie :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 5d an excellent save even at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes it is, mike|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me 2nt on E is showing a hand with 4-card support and defensive values|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H in no time and then what?|pg||
nt|raghavan: in theory,EW has game in H let us see|pg||
mb|2H|an|alert|nt|lestergold: is 1n an upgrade?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: 14-16|pg||
nt|onebid: 14-16|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h very nice contract for another push|pg||
nt|lestergold: i c|pg||
nt|raghavan: Mike will S now enter pre empt|pg||
nt|onebid: these are exactly the kind of boards Robinson wants|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this vul he might well|pg||
nt|lestergold: not much risk|pg||
nt|pbundy: many play that 2@H here is some crummy raise|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: but also it wont stop e/w either|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can make 5 of course as spade and club finesses both right|pg||
nt|dcbutler: in the two USA2 round of 16 matches, Jacobs leads Cohler by 18 and Strull leads Oxdil by 2 after one of four segments |pg||
nt|pbundy: except for fleischer/nickell match, all pretty exciting|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i dont thin k south will get too excited with his q  two jacks and no singleton|pg||
nt|pbundy: and, needless to say, i would never count out the nickell team|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wouldnt count out any team who reached this semi final|pg||
nt|pbundy: all of us have seen that team overcome enormous deficits|pg||
nt|cherdano:  light opening|pg||
nt|daman: if you look at the play in the other room...the @S* cost an IMP|pg||
nt|daman: @S8|pg||
nt|henryb: they are opening the bidding lighter and lighter|pg||
nt|roswolf: double looks obvious|pg||
nt|pbundy: minor(s) show a stronger raise - or 2NT - with 3@H being preemptive|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: has made it awkward tho|pg||
nt|onebid: 4@H needs some play|pg||
nt|joest: so the auction from the open will be duplicated|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Val Westheimer|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: i think boyd will plead 5th ammendment and remain silent|pg||
nt|dcbutler: EW play a lot of transfers, here 2D shows hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: no im wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: 8 was to the best i cud see|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi all:-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Yes Mike may prevent EW reaching Hgame|pg||
nt|haans: 2 round of hearts?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hi Val :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: no chance for cross ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Val|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  a breather hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: the hearts unlucky but the club finesse onm so will only lose 2h an a spade in practice|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh still E bids|pg||
nt|lestergold: so an easy read for welland after all|pg||
nt|lestergold: ride|pg||
nt|lestergold: i meant to type|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes it seems like the right play|pg||
nt|ralfwil: He was afraid of a better @c contract on EW|pg||
nt|raghavan: Why has not W X this thinking they may go club which he cannot X|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be delicate|pg||
nt|pbundy: where i expected the hand to rest|pg||
nt|pbundy: chip's values are just too soft to search for game opposite a weak raise|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: thanks Steve|pg||
nt|cherdano:  so an undeserved IMP to Robinson :)|pg||
nt|daman: not really undeserved|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pbundy: yes - and one of those hands where you cannot go wrong in the play|pg||
nt|panja: all agree with the 2@H choice? anyone for pass?|pg||
nt|daman: deserved|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: i dont think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: east too good cant isk missing vul game because opps are playing favourable vulnerability tactcis|pg||
nt|mcarroll: well stopped by both pairs|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|onebid: unlikely S will lead spade - so easier for declarer|pg||
nt|pbundy: as some of my partners would say:  "bundy-proof"|pg||
nt|lestergold: no losing options of course |pg||
nt|dcbutler: hard to sac on this vulnerability|pg||
nt|lestergold: Peg u are too modest for a bridge player |pg||
nt|haans: or @H void |pg||
nt|pbundy: yes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: I see 8 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb: the question on this hand is whether Robinson can eventually endplay Weinstein into giving him his ninth trick|pg||
nt|daman: right Henry|pg||
nt|cherdano:  they play standard carding so East will probably switch|pg||
nt|henryb: since he has eight winners snd threats in both majors, I am sure he can|pg||
nt|daman: he will play @Cs first|pg||
nt|cherdano:  he won't have problems guessing East's shape|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: B. Cohen upgraded his hand for his short @cs, unfortunately that meant that his partners entire hand was wasted|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk5: Good afternoon to Mike Gold|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi all|pg||
nt|jstokes: Stanby avoiding the tap and hoping for a decent spade break; he will be disappointed|pg||

nt|ralfwil: hello Mike!|pg||
nt|haans: hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi joe|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: spade dont hurt i think declarer can always maintain control on this han|pg||
nt|onebid: yes, if careful|pg||
nt|onebid: check the amusing auction in Open|pg||
nt|lestergold: kh ah and club finesse and play clubs cant go off|pg||
nt|lestergold: in open south spyched i cee a heart they ignored it|pg||
nt|onebid: no, more likely conventional|pg||
nt|daman: East might play them for him|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|pbundy: well; thank you but i see myself ALL the time!|pg||
nt|pbundy: tho i will say i saw an absolute world class player go down in 3nt yesterday with 9 tricks on top|pg||
nt|pbundy: even after the set, he didn't realize he had done it|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pbundy: fatigue and concentration are no small parts of the game|pg||
nt|daman: I like 2@H|pg||
nt|joest: i would bid 2@h|pg||
nt|joest: i always do|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pbundy: of course, everything else the same - if steve had the 10 of diamonds game could be made :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: oh then it wasnt amusing after all|pg||
nt|onebid: I'm easily amused |pg||
nt|onebid: Now you have 3 commentators - off to kibitz:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Mike N made bid of 2S in OP that means bid of 1H by south is conventional probably transfer to higher suit |pg||

nt|raghavan: a part score deal|pg||
nt|lestergold: a my sons says all players are terrible except for the very top players who are merely bad|pg||
nt|pbundy: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: the computer dealer is having a field day|pg||
nt|pbundy: indeed|pg||
nt|daman: sorry  lose 3   backwards|pg||
nt|daman: 2|pg||
nt|daman: eating a banana|pg||
nt|panja: difficult hand to bid, 3@C might be the best spot for NW|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a cheap save.......|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and once again not even 3@s makes, so... :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|clarsen: think down one not 2|pg||
nt|clarsen: maybe im wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: no looked -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: goulash deals abounding|pg||
nt|pbundy: does everyone open 1@S with the west hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5s east west cold n/s have save in hearts even 6h x shows a profit|pg||
nt|haans: but vul dont think so|pg||
nt|raghavan: again 4 H contract EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: some weak 2!|pg||
nt|sybarra: click back once |pg||
nt|clarsen: prob 2 he lost 3 c 3h and one spade|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: looks like multi overcall this time, singe long suit or dont (my guess is multi) |pg||
nt|pbundy: i must admit that i prefer 1@C most of the time when 5/5 - but - |pg||
mb|d|nt|pbundy: this pair may have a special meaning for 1@C|pg||
nt|dcbutler: i"m a spade opener with 5-5|pg||
nt|pbundy: i wonder if 3@D is a cue bid INTO hearts for spades!?|pg||
nt|pbundy: i do like 3@H with the south hand.......  particularly at these colors|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Peter Friedland|pg||
nt|pef: hi all|pg||
nt|pbundy: hi peter :)|pg||
nt|pef: hey peggy|pg||
nt|henryb: another 3N, perhaps more difficult to reach |pg||
nt|lestergold: not cheap 500|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Partscore battle here, NS can only make 2@s, and EW can make 3 (or 4)@c|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- and perhaps this time it was more difficult to avoid bidding the game|pg||
nt|pbundy: on the hand where 5@D was played, they doubled in the other room....  trying to whittle down the lead.|pg||
nt|cindy:  how many @s ?|pg||
nt|cindy:  4 ?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4|pg||
mb|4S|nt|joest: realistically north south pairs get to game on these hands|pg||
nt|jstokes: this will get them quickly to 4@H|pg||
nt|pbundy: if 3@S is preemptive - that would be my choice|pg||
nt|cindy:  3 ?|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course; i'm watching and THEY are playing!|pg||
mb|4N|nt|dcbutler: i like to play transfers over major suit michaels - for me 3D would show a forcing spade raise|pg||
nt|joest: 3NT for lack of anything else|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 2s limit for n/s|pg||
nt|raghavan: Mike - the first 4 were games & slam|pg||
nt|xenya: playing with Larry Cohen, you are expected to bid 3@S here|pg||
nt|xenya: or an equivalent|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@h is a Mixed @s raise|pg||
mb|5C|nt|cindy:  this is why i DONT like DONT :)|pg||
nt|daman: nickel is playing 107   down 44 IMPs|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: (I think :))|pg||
nt|sybarra: Strul probably hopeful of beating this one |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I dont think it is DONT |pg||
nt|marlowepi: one of the most fertile areas of bidding innovations over the last couple of decades has been in assigning a variety of artificial meanings to 2NT bids in various sequences. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but--------|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think it is multi |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes big hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Peter !!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: onbly 400 Mike... against 620|pg||
nt|clarsen: looks like some imps back to strul  dont think 4h can make|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup probably -1|pg||
mb|5D|nt|cindy:  well whatever it is i DONT like it :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  unless it shows spades|pg||
nt|pbundy: i wonder if robinson has any fears of pushing them into a slam that would make....|pg||
nt|henryb: I guess they do not play that the cue bid promises a fit|pg||
nt|daman: at first blush they might   but 2NT changes the landscape|pg||
nt|pbundy: i believe that e/w can make slam here....  tho i am doubtful they will bid it|pg||
nt|cindy:  4N 2 places to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|dcbutler: welcome Peter|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 4 trumps  + middling values|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: hi all, pretty surprising that only this match is close--people keep waiting for the nickell team to make a run, but it hasn't happened yet--up to 80 imps now over there|pg||
nt|joest: so much for that prediction.|pg||
nt|joest: this will tighten the match considerably|pg||
nt|henryb: Robinson is giving Boyd lots of leeway|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: And Larry was happy to trun down the invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: mulit=single major |pg||
nt|cindy:  even then i DONT like it :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: which my guess that was |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: will find out and let you know ASAP.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the late great Grant Baze had a great website, on which he shared this bit of wisdom:|pg||
nt|pbundy: weinstein is a passed hand after all|pg||
nt|pbundy: and - unlikely that clubs will be played for no losers|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: identical auction to the open room|pg||
nt|pef: bad news for ew is that clubs split 5-1, good news is that north doesn't have a spade to ruff with, very tempting for robinson to bid one more here|pg||
nt|cindy:  4@sx was their best spot|pg||
nt|pbundy: will weinstein read this as a singleton?  probably - given that clubs were shown by the offense|pg||
nt|cindy:  i would think so|pg||
nt|pbundy: he's probably considering where he should win this - and how he should play the diamonds|pg||
nt|cindy:  dont know why Stansby would lead a club unless a singleton|pg||
pc|c2|nt|raghavan: Heart K is favourable so makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: and i  due course the same 4 losers and another pusk|pg||
nt|lestergold: well northcan ruff a club that is if he had a trump --- pity!!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@c is pushing the limit, but the favorable @H situation will help somewhat|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: 3H = mixed raise.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cherdano:  assuming 2NT was non-forcing, that is|pg||
nt|daman: and here we are|pg||
nt|daman: I see 9 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb: maybe more since Weinstein is marked with virtually all the highcards|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: another no-brainer contract|pg||
nt|pbundy: i myself would be fearful that slam is makeable|pg||
nt|clarsen: becker was timid,they opened 3 di at other table|pg||
nt|pbundy: he surely doesn't want to lose to the diamond king offside and suffer a ruff!|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: makes on many layouts when HK is wronmg too|pg||
nt|lestergold: dm 3/3 or ruffing spade in dummy|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: so are they thats why they didnt push to 6h!|pg||
nt|pef: well, he does have an ace, but I agree it's close.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|daman: not a bad advance|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|daman: in the meckweel match  both tables were in 3NT  -300|pg||
nt|roswolf: some pre-empt by welland|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cindy:  makes 4 now|pg||
nt|lestergold: now likely make 4|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: the acs divided and the heart ace doesnt always stand in these situations|pg||
nt|xenya: this needs some delicate handling|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, very|pg||
nt|xenya: but i think declarer will prevail -- he might as well tale a @H finesse now|pg||
nt|xenya: *take|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: he recalled a panel at a Nationals with many experts fielding many questions, and he said he always remembered and came to cherish the answer given by the late great Bobby Goldman ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in answer to this question:|pg||
nt|lestergold: point is north does  not expect to beat 5s but he let them play it|pg||
nt|lestergold: to little uside in bidding on|pg||
nt|lestergold: massive downside|pg||
nt|pef: Not sure if I agree with that.  I think the upside potential is at least close to the downside potential.  give partner a doubleton diamond for example and that's 7 probably imps|pg||
nt|pbundy: to me, part of the problem is what DO you do if they now bid 6?  do you decide that they made an error, and simply defend?  or - have you now pushed them to a slam that will ...|pg||
nt|pbundy: succeed?|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a trump promotion|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "what is your least favorite convetnion"|pg||
nt|debrose: drumroll....|pg||
nt|pbundy: he's only in five; he doesn't mind making only five|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: for an imp drop in the ocean|pg||
nt|cindy:  not that easy to hold to 3|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now should cash S or else|pg||
pc|s8|nt|panja: playing to drop @CJ or K stiff?|pg||
nt|cindy:  spade goes away|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: and bobby said: "any meaning of a constructive 2NT bid that isn;t natural"|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|raghavan: he gives S|pg||
nt|pbundy: what he wants to do is take his best line to MAKE five!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cindy:  right|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|cindy:  3 still|pg||
nt|lestergold: last hand wires crossed|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|raghavan: claim time|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|debrose: That's interesting Marshall.  I believe I play a lot more natural 2N bids than most experts do these days, but do play Lebensohl here|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mtvesuvius: At this point the @h has to be on for him to make|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: He might have been afraid that, if the heart finesse were off, extra undertricks.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|debrose: As with so many areas of bidding, the key is being on the same wavelength as partner|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Correct, and it would result in -2 if off I believe|pg||
nt|xenya: well S got into the auction and N is likely to have @C AK as the play went|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|nt|joest: so now down to 25|pg||
nt|henryb: there went one overtrick|pg||
nt|daman: same contract from the other side in the OR   @HJ lead   @D switch|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5 back to strul|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cindy:   i feel strongly about a lot of things (dont for example :)) but not 2N|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: absolutely.......and then hope that the computer deals the right hands for your methods :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|debrose: You'll always get hands where you wish you'd agreed to a different meaning, but might survive those.  Having partner pass your artificial bid thinking it was natural is rarely ...|pg||
nt|debrose: pretty|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s9|pc|cK|nt|xenya: so @HK seems to be marked with S|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Now the @d gets ruffed and he guarantees his contract|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Good job, careful.|pg||

nt|raghavan: Push|pg||
nt|pef: while it's not impossible you might push them to 6s, I think it's likely that if that pair was going to bid 6 they would have done so already|pg||
nt|joest: appears to be a pretty routine spade game|pg||
nt|daman: Billy Cohen made 3NT in the OR|pg||
nt|xenya: nicely done, yes|pg||
nt|pbundy: well done by weinstein|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cindy:  skinny 3N at other table|pg||
nt|lestergold: might be a swing here|pg||
nt|lestergold: playersd do not like doing this because if they get it wrong its so expensive that is why robinson preferred to let sleeping dogs lie|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S for NS..should be easy..a likely push|pg||
nt|pbundy: a wild hand; just what n/s want and e/w do not.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: plenty of action potential here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: yes; though i am guessing garner did not bid - and that e/w will be silent throughout|pg||
nt|pbundy: vugraph?  could you correct please?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would imagine so|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pef: well, we'll have to ask him--I bet at least as much of his reasoning was he thought there was a real chance they'd beat 5s, not that he thought 6s was making|pg||
nt|lestergold: not always the case in thesde haviliy competitiv auctions|pg||
nt|pbundy: i have a strong suspicion that east started with @S :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but north is dealer\??|pg||
nt|pef: you don't think north has a mandatory 1s psych in first seat?|pg||
nt|pbundy: call me crazy - but - |pg||
nt|joest: weinstein will definitely respond 1NT|pg||
nt|joest: ok i give|pg||
nt|daman: uncle|pg||
nt|jstokes: transfer response to 1@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bi part score|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north's weak nt hand and south's hand are not always bid to a game|pg||
nt|pef: another 11 card spade fit for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: this isnt the british juniors|pg||
nt|dcbutler: might have worked pretty well on this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: oops|pg||
mb|3H|nt|joest: would you volunteer 2@s here?|pg||
nt|raghavan: heart by W  shows spade suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: It is pretty Standard to play this particular negative double as exactly 4-4 in the majors.  |pg||
nt|pbundy: that is quite true, david :)|pg||
nt|pef: so a grand slam on a (failing) club finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d?? if im coming in give it at least the 3d|pg||
nt|pbundy: i wonder why robinson didn't begin with some   of diamonds?|pg||
nt|pbundy: i guess he preferred the spade psych :) :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: cute|pg||
nt|pef: would have led to an interesting auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 6s is against the wall and roland is in 7|pg||
nt|pef: many years ago, when psyching was much more prevalent in high level bridge, people had to develop methods to deal with frequent psychs|pg||
nt|pbundy: a spec informs me that 2@D was precluded by the dreaded flannery|pg||
nt|pef: in fact, we're probably all old enough to remember when the convention card had a place to check "frequent psychs"|pg||
nt|pbundy: that is why 3@D was invented|pg||
nt|pbundy: tho at these colors, that's a little much|pg||
nt|haans: very popular bidding |pg||
nt|xenya: 1N -- 14-16?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, 14-16 here|pg||
mb|4C|nt|debrose: Occasionally it might be 4-5 with a weak hand.  So bidding a major in this auction most definitely does not promise 5|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n probably coming now|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho south is a passed hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: If bid makes with good D and SAQ and K of other suit|pg||
nt|cindy:  N knows S must have very good @ds to come in red|pg||
nt|pef: a little?|pg||
nt|pbundy: part of why i spurn flannery.  |pg||
nt|daman: routine 2@S bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Grand in @C or NT|pg||
nt|pbundy: will they get to the cold 7NT? or - 7@C, if that seems too scary|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: auction far from over|pg||
nt|pef: you mean so you can open 2d with 4 counts in first seat?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: not a good contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: Rosenberg is violating the "Law of total tricks" here, because of his honors in partner's first "suit"|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the other room as W opened 1 @D |pg||
nt|debrose: and his three little diamonds tell him partner has at most a doubleton and he has nothing wasted there|pg||
nt|lestergold: 10 imps on the way back toWelland|pg||
nt|cindy:  and a hand not suitable for a preempt   |pg||
nt|lestergold: very different auction in the open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: after this the gap not an unsurmountable 32 or so|pg||
nt|raghavan: Cindy is it unsuitable because of a Major in hand? |pg||
nt|cindy:  it would be for me but I'm told they play 2@d is a 3 suited hand|pg||
nt|cindy:  so 2@d was not an option|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh|pg||
nt|raghavan: Cindy it is only opening 2D it is 3 suiter -|pg||
nt|raghavan: not any overcall|pg||
nt|cindy:  opening 2@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes Opening 2D = 4414, etc almost like precision except the short suit can be anyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume opening 2d would deny a 4 card major|pg||
nt|raghavan: need not be singleton D|pg||
nt|lestergold: south cant open that in classical weak 2 stule in front of partner|pg||
nt|raghavan: No their CC says 11-15, 4441, 5440 etc|pg||
nt|raghavan: any shotness|pg||
nt|lestergold: so a different reason but of course he didnt open 2d becasue it would have had a different meaning in their style|pg||
nt|raghavan: It becomes overcall|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@d = 4+ hearts; 1@s denies three @h|pg||
nt|cherdano:  1@S probably shows an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|daman: 3@C = invitational|pg||
nt|henryb: and promises real clubs|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|henryb: Boyd will be okay against all games if he can avoid a @d lead|pg||
nt|cherdano:  they may get to 5@C|pg||
nt|pbundy: 4@S i am guessing is an advance cue bid|pg||
nt|cindy:  he should be able to find out about the @cK and bid 7N|pg||
nt|pbundy: tho - some pairs play some different sorts of key card asks|pg||
nt|pbundy: never 100% easy when you are void in partner's suit to sort out all the meaningful keycard, though|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lestergold: what is delay? technical/|pg||
nt|panja: considering dbl could be just 9...I would pass one round, as N|pg||
nt|daman: most of us would bid|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: B. Cohen wasn't too happy to have to make a bid here, let alone declare this|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: in the other room Woolsey did not rebid 2@h.  Cohen double raised Smith's 1@s to 3 and Smith passed|pg||
nt|henryb: I do not think Robinson is trancing|pg||
nt|raghavan: e 5D may be a save of 3 IMP|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: That lead gives him some options though|pg||
nt|pbundy: on the last hand, welland added a small plus to their lead when berkowitz/cohen overreached for game|pg||
mb|6C|nt|Vugraphu8: adam|pg||
nt|raghavan: stopped in 3S|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S 1 down|pg||
nt|jstokes: and will do well to make 3|pg||
nt|haans: @H9 may help|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks more like -2 with lack of entries to the table|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Will be happier now, w/non-spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|dcbutler: EW in the other room sold to 5DX on the previos hand, so Welland is within 9 imps|pg||
nt|pef: so much for the "master suit"|pg||
mb|7C|nt|panja: not unreasonable..|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: David had no reason to lead anything else here.|pg||
nt|clarsen: di nxt im sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: im not sure i likem the old black here slam would be cold if west's 8 points outside spades were kq of hearts and K of clubs|pg||
nt|cherdano:  now this has a chance|pg||
nt|lestergold: but there are  communication problems|pg||
nt|raghavan: At some time S may be on lead helping declarer|pg||
nt|pbundy: well; martel didn't seem to have too much difficulty here!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: now trying for a grand slam, asking aobut the k of clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: what east should have done is make a bid that tells partner he is looking for a cue in hearts or is missing something that he needs from him|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland is egging him on!!|pg||
nt|pbundy: i would not expect stansby to correct to NT - and - he did not|pg||
nt|pbundy: they save that for the reisinger :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  dont have to worry about a lurking ruff in 7N|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Play will be swift|pg||
nt|pbundy: oddly enough, i think a spade is the best lead|pg||
pc|s5|nt|debrose: He would not expect his decision to work well when partner had xxx clubs, but that is very much against the odds|pg||
nt|debrose:  perhaps Gary can get out for down one when 3@D was making anyway|pg||
nt|joest: i know I would kick the extra point|pg||
nt|henryb: I think it is cold now|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: on a @H lead he would have to play it wide open|pg||
nt|henryb: @sAK, @s ruff, @dA, @s ruff with @cK, @d and ruff the fourth @d with the trump 9|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps E's sequence showed just what he had -- strong takeout double|pg||
nt|pbundy: takes out the entry to the hearts|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: and west now will decline holding xx club|pg||
nt|lestergold: south club switch surel;y dclarer must lose spade 2 clubs 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another @d and it´s up to declarer|pg||
nt|cindy:  he can claim|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes now this makes things difficult|pg||
pc|s7|nt|joest: a fifth trump and an ace|pg||
nt|panja: I would think S should bid 2@H first..3@S deemed slightly weaker?|pg||
nt|joest: partner has what he's supposed to have and I'm cold|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course if he doesnt thn a ht will take care of a club loser|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pef: excellent prediction :)|pg||
nt|dcbutler: probably 5C showed 1 keycard, 5D asked for the Q of trumps, 5H showed it plus the K of hearts|pg||
nt|pef: robinson margin likey now to increase by the whims of fate|pg||
nt|pbundy: note that boyd wisely didn't X clubs to let them know any potential hooks were losing|pg||
nt|pbundy: i would highly doubt they'd be in the grand then|pg||
nt|lestergold: well commentator's curse|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he will regret that he didn listen to my comments!!!!|pg||
nt|pef: something must have come off the wheels there--hard to understand welland 7s call|pg||
nt|raghavan: He needs 2 ruffs of D to improve|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Now Berkowitz has to return a @d to beat this, since Larry would score his T@H then|pg||
nt|xenya: hence the disciplined pass|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vdoubleu: Good play|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Now Larry sees the possibility, and will return the @d... Nice play|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|pbundy: he could have tried 5@H if he still wanted to look|pg||
nt|pbundy: oops; i mean 6@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: bidding one more and not making at this level is er not good bridge|pg||
nt|henryb: just a permutation|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pbundy: but - i'm guessing that declarer will now play 2 rounds of clubs ending in dummy - and hope that the 2nd heart lives|pg||
nt|cindy:  soon|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pbundy: only needs 2 pitches on hearts with the good spade|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|d2|nt|pbundy: 7NT 30 seconds faster claim :)|pg||

nt|dcbutler: boyd was going to be on lead, so doubling 6C would have likely only helped the opponents|pg||

nt|cindy:  maybe 2@h|pg||
nt|pbundy: wouldn't seem like quite enough to me for a limit raise here.......BUT - i don't play the cards as well as weinstein does :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: @h on 5-2 or @s on 4-3|pg||
nt|cindy:  think they will still end in 2@h |pg||
mb|2D|an|alert|nt|lestergold: join the party|pg||
nt|pbundy: we are fortunate to catch migry actually available for vugraph instead of competing herself|pg||
nt|daman: off 4 tricks on a @C lead|pg||

nt|ralfwil: I prefer 5-2|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n may well be bid and made|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: That shld end things|pg||
nt|xenya: E might wake up|pg||
nt|cindy:  2@d and then 2@h p p p|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: Of course there is no passive lead with this hand.  A diamond from Txx could easily blow something in that suit|pg||
nt|joest: this should play o.k.|pg||
nt|panja: with just 18 HCP...NS could even make 8 trick in NT...|pg||
nt|joest: Weinstein may lead the queen of clubs.  That's his style :)|pg||
nt|panja: @CT lead?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 8 top tricks and one in the wash but they ve stopped short|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now the auction comes to life |pg||
mb|2H|nt|joest: fourth best|pg||
nt|daman: 9   coded :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Bart Bramley|pg||
nt|migry: :) great to be here|pg||
nt|daman: or any lead for that matter|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am guessing you are right, though, cindy|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bbramley: hello everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: another push likely|pg||
nt|migry: and in San Remo tomorrow:)|pg||
nt|pef: no 11 card spade fit here, so a quiet board|pg||
nt|panja: @CJ, @SK and another Club, that is 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hmm, shows what I know:)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Wow, Berkowitz doing a little upgrading there :)|pg||
nt|clarsen: im sure smith would like to be able to dbl,not convenient with stiff club|pg||
nt|cindy:  oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hello Bart welcome |pg||
nt|raghavan: Declarer has 8 tricks so a push|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Overtake & trump shift|pg||
nt|pbundy: whoops; i thought that garner had shown a minimum limit raise.....|pg||
mb|4H|nt|debrose: Hi Bart.  Just in time.  What would you lead against 1N with the North hand?  No peeking at the other hands:)|pg||
nt|debrose: How about you Sylvia?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  this might be a swing to Robinson eg if Doub opens 3@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: too high now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: it is a reasonable contract played by west especially|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Cash club first?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: i would have led like he did - good old 4th best - 2nd choice is a high club - last choice is any other suit|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: No, then the @c can be pitched on a @d|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Right, he has to cash his @c first :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hard to see that from Ron's perspective|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, he cannot envision the exact play yet I don't think|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Neither can Larry:)))|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: But I thk he will fall into this.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Welland picked up 6 IMPs when they stole it for 2@s on  20|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am guessing a spade lead from stansby|pg||
nt|pbundy: ace and a diamond might give weinstein a chance |pg||
pc|h7|nt|debrose: Sorry, Shirley.  I told you I can't think when Michael's in a close match:(|pg||
nt|lestergold: pianissimo|pg||
nt|pbundy: heh heh heh|pg||
nt|pbundy: weinstein's a fabulous declarer - but - he will need more than that to make 4@H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would have guessed a @S or @C lead - but not a trump|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcarroll: Oddly if you swith the NS @Cs and @Ds it is a very different outcome 4 makes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: switch|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: thats ok :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Now anything but a @c return and this makes|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|joest: why didn't he work the spades first in case they were 4-2?|pg||
nt|panja: good idea for def now is @D to @DK and small back|pg||
nt|joest: Doub would go up queen|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes - but - surely not a great game. you need a lot of things working to make game on this one|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: that would tie his knickers in a knot|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Although it's still a bit double dummy, becuase he lacks entries to his hand :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|daman: cash the @C Queen to get count from partner|pg||
nt|cherdano:  East is dummy|pg||
nt|daman: :)   really|pg||
nt|daman: then play another @S|pg||
nt|daman: -2 in the OR|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Does not need more than 1, because after West ruffs the diamond he will not be able to get partner in.|pg||
nt|roswolf: -1 seems to be declarer's fate|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It is not a game you would want to be in|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bbramley: also a good @S shift - clarifies another suit for his partner|pg||
nt|joest: garner would play the jack if he had it|pg||
nt|panja: he must play @DQ...|pg||
nt|daman: beware of ....bearing gifts|pg||
nt|panja: with J with W, he would have played the J|pg||
nt|joest: a three trick swing here|pg||
nt|daman: up Simba (with apologies to Tarzan)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|debrose: Yes good point.  Often when defending 1N in particular, knowing you will get in again, it is better to lead something through declarer while you have the chance rather than cashing ...|pg||
nt|debrose: out|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Neil should have continued spades before clearing the clubs.|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: now!!|pg||
nt|raghavan: Spade play now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @c10 is a nice card on W for 3nt on W! on east a @d lead is killing|pg||
nt|xenya: that's an exciting hand :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Back to -1 once Larry decided to play for 2-2 trump|pg||
nt|clarsen: if becker hadnt opened i presume hand would be passed out|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|debrose: On some hands that has to be weighed against the potential benefit of forcing declarer to make another pitch|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes 1 IMP|pg||
nt|daman: bravo|pg||

mb|1C|an|alert|nt|pbundy: at least - ultimately getting there, one way or another|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: well, lucky or not, this match just got a lot closer|pg||
mb|1H|an|spades|nt|pbundy: lol, M|pg||
nt|migry: still a long way to go|pg||
nt|pef: I guess to be fair we should point out this is a real marathon event|pg||
nt|joest: both|pg||
nt|daman: West would not have raised to 2@S only|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt not an easy play|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 14-16 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now a chan for more honey for welland if they find this excellent save|pg||
mb|2S|an|shows 4 spades|nt|sybarra: 4th from longest and strongest  or this will work also |pg||
nt|sybarra: I like this lead better|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes, many, many more boards in this match|pg||
nt|daman: ahhh|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c = art one round force|pg||
nt|roswolf: south bids at last|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 5h costing 3000 against the infrangible 5c|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Easy game here:)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Notrump ranges often affect swings alot... this one may be an unfortunate loss for NS|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pef: in fact, the robinson team has been playing nonstop since saturday--they came out of the round robin|pg||
nt|pbundy: and, needless to say, irrespective of which team fails in this match - still possible that the "loser" will be USA  2|pg||
nt|pef: as did the fleisher team in the other match|pg||
nt|pef: this may be unique that two of the semi-finalists (and the two in the lead) came from the rr|pg||
nt|dcbutler: i think the round robin actually started last Friday|pg||
nt|joest: is this the auction?|pg||
nt|daman: maybe 2@D is a constructive @H raise|pg||
nt|daman: you were right Jack|pg||
nt|joest: 2@d = 8+ HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: and another swing coming - N/S have the first 8 tricks here for 200 and 7 more imps for meltzer|pg||
nt|debrose: We've seen a lot of the Schermer-Chambers NT defense system here.  It probably does not include a way to show clubs at the 2 level|pg||
nt|debrose: I think many would bid 3@C at favorable|pg||
nt|sybarra: we know his 2 @C shows majors |pg||
nt|raghavan: S will support clubs now - is it not cindy|pg||
nt|lestergold: gonna be hard for west to come in now|pg||
nt|jstokes: no one likes playing 2NT; he hopes for a good club fit and maybe his hand will take some tricks|pg||
nt|pbundy: even with the bad break in trump, it appears that 4@S should have no difficulties|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: I think it is 1@h-1@s, 2@c-2@d|pg||
nt|joest: 2@s = 16+ HCP and three card spade support|pg||
nt|daman: Nickell now only down by 21|pg||
nt|henryb: so both matches heading towards a closer finish than we might have looked for earlier today|pg||
nt|henryb: Jacobs is still up by 26 with six boards to compare|pg||
nt|cherdano:  West must be thinking here obviously|pg||
nt|cherdano:  he would survie a slam try|pg||
nt|daman: he might just barge into it on his own|pg||
nt|daman: but when he sees only 2 key catds he might bail out|pg||
nt|raghavan: If H comes clubs can be developped|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks rather easy after a @h lead|pg||
nt|jstokes: good decision by martel, it seems|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Win with @hQ and play @cQ|pg||
nt|raghavan: S will play twice towards D QJ for entry after driving out C AK|pg||
nt|jstokes: of course, if Willenken had a second heart it wouldn't be so good|pg||
nt|haans: hearts 5-1 is great|pg||
nt|haans: 6-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but its favourable vulnerability abd he has nice 2 suiter|pg||
nt|joest: are you sure Howard did not start with 1@s?|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|pbundy: even with a ruff, the heart is onside....|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes 4@S should be a make|pg||
nt|pbundy: only 24 separating the teams now however|pg||
nt|pbundy: martel may be contemplating whether to go for ruffs or a pump|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: pity one of them bid by south!|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead double but then theyll go to 5c|pg||
nt|pbundy: i think that 6@S is makeable here without a club lead........  am i correct?|pg||
nt|daman: cards*|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bbramley: the modern style is to get in there, like pepsi did at the other table, but that jockeyed E/W into 3@D, which they made|pg||
nt|lestergold: not surely goona stand this|pg||
nt|pbundy: the hand that is short in spades is the hand that is shorter in diamonds|pg||
nt|pef: yes, you are right, started on friday, so seventh consecutive day of play|pg||
nt|panja: only an asking bid in Spades can tell W about @SAK|pg||
nt|henryb: I don't think so with only an eight card trump fit|pg||
nt|daman: he was hesitating for a reason|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a make|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|raghavan: Mike - are a prophecy teller|pg||
nt|lestergold: not difficult looking at north's hand|pg||
nt|daman: they are well on their way to slam with this auction|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT asks shape|pg||
pc|s3|nt|debrose: Perhaps he was hoping to defend NT successfully with the opponents vulnerable - something good to consider when overcalling over 1N in general|pg||
nt|migry: 6 can be made|pg||
nt|jstokes: 4@S alsoin the open room on Bd 8, where 6@C was makeable|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ralf declarer plays as u say - HQ why not H J|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Just to hide the @hJ|pg||
nt|raghavan: W thinks E may have another Heart But his counting is wrong |pg||
nt|ralfwil: But I think @cQ is better, just to win the trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: both hands will duck and another @c mahes the defence helpless|pg||
nt|raghavan: Suppose E after CA, attacks Spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Chris is thinking a long time on this play.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with a long @h on W he probably is short in @c. That´s why|pg||
nt|xenya: 5 imps to Welland on 5 when NS in OR stopped in 2@S -- could have been 7 the other way if had S made 4@S here|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pbundy: and - a spec kindly informs me that zia made 6 on a heart lead - after bidding it|pg||
nt|henryb: partner could have cued with a very suitable hand. In fact he might have cued with the hand he has|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panja: tough to bid the slam if A could be @DA|pg||
nt|joest: 3@h = 3-6|pg||
nt|xenya: on 22 sorry|pg||
nt|cindy:  played the 10 to find out about the Q|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|raghavan: I mean the X|pg||
nt|lestergold: weak pard with weak suit he believes west's double|pg||
nt|joest: as Jackie Gleason used to say....|pg||
nt|daman: this will not take long|pg||
nt|cindy:  E is sorta stuck in dummy|pg||
nt|cindy:  but S doesnt have another trump to lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bbramley: right|pg||
nt|sybarra: echo in @D coming for the lead most likely |pg||
nt|debrose: But with that hand I think most would act, thinking the opponents are likely to get to spades or diamonds anyway, or partner may bid|pg||
nt|bbramley: agree - that's one reason so many players strain to get in - it could easily be partscores making in both directions|pg||
nt|joest: "Awaaaaay we go"|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pef: what happens if he ducks the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb: 6 controls (A = 2, K = 1) and the @sJ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|daman: I'm gonna send you to the moon Alice?|pg||
nt|joest: this is a 'double roman' key card auction|pg||
nt|joest: six key cards|pg||
nt|joest: since both hearts and spades have been bid|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|pbundy: north does.........|pg||
nt|cindy:  more @ds now|pg||
nt|pbundy: no; west won the trick|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: good defence here|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes|pg||
nt|cindy:  yep|pg||
nt|pbundy: what looked like a simple hand when dummy came down is not quite as simple now|pg||
nt|cindy:  still stuck in dummy|pg||
nt|cindy:  the two ducks were deadly|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am guessing that weinstein "knows" stansby has the heart ace.  if martel had it, he might have won and lead more spades|pg||
nt|cindy:  leading that first trump caused all of this|pg||
nt|mcarroll: That would be his analysis all right - so can he therefore continue a small @H in safety|pg||
nt|cindy:  he can|pg||
nt|pbundy: he might be considering the queen of hearts here - then cross ruffing and hoping for 2@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Weinstein is getting his worth on the next card play...thinking for a long time.|pg||
nt|pbundy: a big hand here.|pg||
nt|pbundy: he wants to be certain he maximizes his chances|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|debrose: or you may not have any defense to even 3N, e.g., partner has a stiff club|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: in any case im due a right prediction just now after all the commentator curses striking!!|pg||
nt|daman: wow|pg||
nt|raghavan: W plays SJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I thinh you now can see my point|pg||
nt|ralfwil: think....|pg||
pc|h9|nt|daman: great auction|pg||
nt|joest: he couldhave bought @D A and @Sk|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sybarra: high @h now?  |pg||
nt|joest: 13 more to Welland really makes this match interesting|pg||
nt|daman: then it would be a @S guess   same as now|pg||
nt|pbundy: good news for the welland team, however; the strul team failed in the open room|pg||
pc|c6|nt|raghavan: curtains|pg||
nt|pbundy: no diamond loser?|pg||
nt|dcbutler: don't think you can make it then|pg||
nt|migry: you can|pg||
nt|pbundy: ruff out the diamonds and give up a club?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jstokes: needs to duck this and will be OK|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pbundy: thus - at worst, they will have a push|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok low @S,  whatever |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|debrose: This time the pass really paid off.  I know some players may wonder about opening 1N with such good majors and two suits unstopped|pg||
nt|pef: but don't you run short of trumps, then?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @h ruff high, @D ruff, @H ruff high setting up Q, and trump to table would have worked better |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c5|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|panja: no harm in ruffing high..|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pef: he's only making 5 now|pg||
nt|joest: there's always a method in his madness.  I'm just trying to work this one out|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: and once again why play 2nt when 3nt is so close|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: pairs is very different|pg||
nt|pbundy: if weinstein ruffs a diamond and ruffs a heart - the hand is made; no?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|raghavan: C, throw in W with H |pg||
pc|sT|pc|c4|pg||

nt|raghavan: another push|pg||
nt|pef: lucky that you can draw one more round of trump and then pitch three clubs|pg||
nt|pbundy: no, i don't think so|pg||
nt|pbundy: hmmmmmmmmmmm|pg||
mb|1C|nt|raghavan: will this be 3NT by NS|pg||
nt|haans: 6NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: five-card majors, six-card minors, I've even seen some six-card majors:) |pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand looks like it should make 2 @H |pg||
nt|ralfwil: the first slam 6nt..|pg||
nt|clarsen: wow 1 spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice lead directing suit :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D seems a make|pg||
mb|1H|nt|joest: a quick Stayman auction to 4@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: b|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: 2 unstopped minors is a mild defect compared to some of the NT openers that we've seen|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H makes here -- on a magic layout|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes if you can guess the clubs, which, after opening bid...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, but it's certainly not a game I'd want to be in|pg||
nt|xenya: now what do you bid as N?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I'd bid 2@d, but 4@H may be a better tactical bid|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Obviously, adam, cuz it makes:)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: LOTT:)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: The Law|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Vugraphu8: quick?|pg||
nt|daman: few bids|pg||
nt|joest: Well garner had to count his hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: east hoping for a double?|pg||
nt|pbundy: 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: on the @S guess I think |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: They are there.|pg||
nt|clarsen: best if strul bids clubs now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bbramley: if neil makes this the match will be tied!|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be bid but making is another matter thye cards are spitting here|pg||
nt|raghavan: 33 points + 10 controls  with NS slam in NT|pg||
nt|haans: close to 7 now|pg||
nt|haans: but an easy blackwood|pg||
nt|jstokes: i'd expect everyone will bid 6N on this one (but I've been wrong before)|pg||
nt|clarsen: 3nt makes as well it appears|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: which is the right @h to lead?|pg||
nt|pef: yeah, I guess you are right|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and may well be bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: on this auction, i might try the queen|pg||
nt|pef: none of them on this lie of the cards :)|pg||
nt|migry: :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: declarer more likely to have the king and hope partner can get in with another heart|pg||
nt|pbundy: 9 of clubs works super :)|pg||
nt|pef: yeah, and such an obvious lead on that auction :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: dims clubs makes even as long as they are in 6|pg||
nt|haans: we all have been wrong (and very) :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: good guess on lead|pg||
nt|debrose: With a K-J guess and nothing else to go on it is often right to play the opening leader for the Ace|pg||
nt|bbramley: even with @S guess there's still a club problem|pg||
nt|debrose: Because he might have led the suit with the Queen, but would "never" from the Ace|pg||
nt|debrose: This is especially true when he is known to have an unattractive holding in the suit he actually did lead|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Fit jump with only 4, that's kind of interesting :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or not |pg||
nt|clarsen: i think 3di is sensible,he needs lots of help in di to make 3nt a viable contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: east still thinking about it|pg||
nt|cindy:  good news @d 3/3|pg||
nt|pbundy: now it just needs to be made :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E has dbled 3NT in Open|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: commenttaor's curse im a chronic suffere|pg||
nt|raghavan: Chip has to show his strength|pg||
nt|haans: were is the ace ask now?|pg||
nt|jstokes: I think, though, these boards are not being played in any other match. Is that right?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt?? |pg||
nt|jstokes: 3N seems fine to me -- he hasn't anything extra for his jump shift, and N could be quite weak|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1D and 3C has not fully shown south hand and N too has not|pg||
nt|jstokes: to me shouth has shown his values; without the great diamonds he wouldn't have a jump shift|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If N has shown a @h suit or stopper, so OK, but otherwise?|pg||
nt|haans: ace ask would get every thing right|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but it got them there, that's what counts|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice|pg||
nt|pbundy: wow|pg||
nt|cindy:  that  should do it|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes it should|pg||
nt|pbundy: garner might have considered a spade from xxx with the club bid on his rigth|pg||
nt|cindy:  3@d 3@s 2@c 1@h|pg||
nt|pbundy: yet - sometimes partner does have the queen or ace...|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes and then you look really silly when you dont lead it|pg||
nt|pbundy: low club even gives south an extra dummy entry - if he tries for it|pg||
pc|c8|nt|debrose: I've been asked what happened to Zia, etc.|pg||
nt|pef: hard to see how this can make|pg||
nt|pbundy: it is|pg||
nt|pef: in fact all roads seem to lead to down 2 even with the relatively favorable heart lead|pg||
nt|xenya: now let us see if gets @Cs right -- not easy by any means|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|joest: i'm guessing garner starts spades, before or after hooking a heaert|pg||
nt|joest: heart|pg||
nt|pbundy: this could be a big swing|pg||
nt|pbundy: we know for certain we'll have some swing, with the double in the other room|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jstokes: who needs Blackwood :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Oh great|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me 3@h in 4-suit forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: i need a few of these in my money games|pg||
nt|haans: well done Martel   BUT why? :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: we don't need no stinking Blackwood, sayd Chip.|pg||
nt|lestergold: but its the opps who always get them |pg||
nt|jstokes: everything is forcing after the jump shift, so no need to invent a bid.  But martel might have an awkward hand and not want to go past 3N|pg||
nt|haans: we do not bid 4th to force but to ask do you have a stopper here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with @hKJ10x on N there could have beeb a guess, but now @hKQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: been....|pg||
nt|sybarra: and more imps to Welland,  assuming the make |pg||
nt|clarsen: dont think there is any reasonable way to go down|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: strul will need to get something back in these last few boards to make a fight of it|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|debrose: I guess because those matches are two day matches, so they are playing the 4th of eight sets, the organizers decided it would be more excited to put the USA 2 bracket on tonight|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n on min values normal auction but one finesse the dim is working but another 4 finesses are all wrong|pg||
nt|migry: looks like declerer sd try his luck in the @c suit|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cindy:  W has his doubling shoes on    good dbl|pg||
nt|lestergold: a tiger double! i lioke it as a money player i approve|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course lead directional|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pbundy: yes, it seems like the straightforward way|pg||
nt|pef: the only alternative would be to play for both spades onside and then some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|joest: norths lead of a diamond from xxx suggests he has stuff outside he wants to protect|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he heard the limited auction so he knows there isno redouble on the way and he knows they are most unlikely to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm what about the unreasonable ones!?:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: a heart up now for an overtyrick attemot|pg||
nt|haans: why not support @C then ask|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pef: now east needs to return a low spade or the diamond to beat it 2|pg||
nt|pbundy: i'm afraid i must leave every one - the dentist calls :(|pg||
nt|pbundy: have fun - and see everyone later!|pg||
nt|pef: bye, peggy|pg||
nt|pbundy: thanks peter & migry and david :) :)|pg||
nt|dcbutler: thanks, Peg|pg||
nt|pef: would say have fun, also, but hard to believe that can be true at the dentist|pg||
nt|migry: bye :) we'll miss you|pg||
nt|pbundy: bye|pg||
nt|pef: willenken thinking "a heart, a heart, my kingdom for a heart"|pg||
nt|dcbutler: Nickell has the margin down to "only" 78|pg||
nt|migry: i think welland is thinking that more than willenken|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pef: at the other table, south opened only 1d (he does only have 19) and played in 3d down 1|pg||
nt|migry: good play - giving nothing away|pg||
nt|pef: so at this point welland probably going to gain 3 imps|pg||
nt|clarsen: he wont go down|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|debrose: These players are playing the last set of an elimination match.  The loser is out of the event.  This is true of the other two vugraph matches as well|pg||
nt|bbramley: and we do have some very close matches here|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=27&Itemid=224|pg||
nt|roswolf: i hope not|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am guessing weinstein will pitch a heart - but - he may be deliberating over which spot|pg||
nt|pbundy: i know they play standard carding - except for pitches are upside down...|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|debrose: The fact that the USA I bracket semi final matches are not especially close now could also be a factor, but given that they have another whole day of play anything could happen ...|pg||

nt|lestergold: no tricks unless then defencwe feeling generous|pg||
nt|cindy:  well 8 :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|lestergold: but these boys have a deficit to catch up so they wont be very generous today|pg||
nt|pef: if he had ducked the club to west at that point, he would have gone down only 1--it takes a bit of time to see why, but try it and wyou will|pg||
nt|raghavan: claim time|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bbramley: a third @D would have been fatal - this will reduce declarer to the same @S guess, which he'll probably get wrong for the reasons debbie cited|pg||
nt|sybarra: does the @H lead from E indicate give away the @S position |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|debrose: Will he think Cohler might have balanced with the same hand with the spade Ace instead of Queen I wonder?|pg||
nt|xenya: will he play E for 18 hcp?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcarroll: at least 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bbramley: i don't think so - with @SQ10 the trump shift would be equally attractive|pg||
nt|cindy:  getting crunch time|pg||
nt|lestergold: east will know to give nothing away|pg||
nt|lestergold: keep off them clubs all he needs to do|pg||
nt|joest: spade ruff, finis|pg||
pc|s8|nt|cindy:  well how about another heart   W must have club A for the dbl|pg||
nt|pbundy: if he cashes the spades and ducks a club into garner, he can make 10|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bbramley: yes, there are bidding inferences to consider as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: musnt play dim because he needs to leve pard with an exit card|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|pbundy: hmmmm|pg||
pc|sK|nt|raghavan: Double dummy running C 10 helps|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|debrose: Since he knows Cohler has only three spades, a spade lead wouldn't have been an option with this hand.  Either of the other suits more attractive|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh hes setting up hts in any case so doesnt matter|pg||
nt|raghavan: not now- first|pg||

nt|lestergold: 6c icy for n/s|pg||
nt|raghavan: 6 IMP to Welland|pg||
nt|lestergold: on the heart ace position of course|pg||
nt|joest: Garner's 3@c = five hearts and five clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: favourable cards for 4h by e/w|pg||
nt|pbundy: less than a vulnerable game swing away now|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: leading the wrong black suit could let N-S make 4@h|pg||
nt|mcarroll: minus 1 in Open, now only a 9 imp game!!|pg||

mb|1N|nt|joest: pass pass|pg||
nt|joest: first|pg||
nt|lestergold: everything behaving like a dream|pg||
nt|pbundy: all you have to do is bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: operator, didn't he make it?  if he guessed @Ss right he had 8 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: I thought so also |pg||
nt|pef: now there a legitimate 2nt opener|pg||
nt|daman: 5 more to go|pg||
nt|henryb: but now S will probably declare @h -- maybe|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: 6n by north same |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: tks|pg||
nt|joest: im guessing Doub will Q 3@h as a limit raise|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C showing lead|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It would ahve helped him if he cashed his last @h in hand|pg||
nt|pbundy: tho this one looks like an easy 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Willie?|pg||
nt|debrose: my general point was with nothing else to go on play opener leader for Ace - here he ended up with quite a bit else to go on|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I asked and Neil claimed for down 1.|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh,  tired puppies|pg||
nt|debrose: thx for clarifying that Willie.  I wonder what happened|pg||
mb|2H|nt|raghavan: In open bid 3NT only|pg||
nt|lestergold: or by south for that matter|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|joest: i'm not sure who has a double here|pg||
nt|joest: Doub if anybody|pg||
nt|panja: dbl 3@C and then go to @S if they bid @H...but now, penalty is difficult to figure out|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hands look like Tailor made - this for 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: although they may land in 3nt with about the same result as the prior board|pg||
nt|henryb: and West does not have a lead problem|pg||
nt|pbundy: the weak NT will get them there quickly|pg||
mb|4H|nt|raghavan: so may be swing if they reach 6C|pg||
nt|lestergold: well as we have seen before 505 slam its red or black on the roulette table with no 0 or double zero|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now easy to reach 6C what do u Cindy & Mike say|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they have a massive combination of cards apart form the lonely heart K!|pg||
nt|cherdano:  he does have a lead problem!|pg||
nt|henryb: well not in my opinion, and certainly not against four|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Brd 25, 5@d, undoubled in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: If the play is as we saw this will get corrected eventually.  A misclaim can be costly, but can't force you to lose tricks you can't really lose|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: I believe he lost 1 spade, 1 heart, 2diamonds and 1 club.|pg||
nt|debrose: With some partners I use this 2N response to show a "semi-positive" in clubs.  Perhaps that's how they play it here|pg||
nt|daman: oh no|pg||
nt|joest: well east-west had their necks out there on the chopping block, that's for sure|pg||
nt|daman: what is he hoping for with a 3@S bid from partner?   as it is, he will buy a trmenous dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  well i agree |pg||
nt|xenya: so a new leader|pg||
nt|clarsen: this will play well|pg||
pc|d5|nt|debrose: But I wouldn't bid 3@C over that with the South hand, and it's a pretty obscure treatment, so I'm guessing they were showing controls?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I don't believe I am allowed to say anything about it to the players.|pg||
nt|debrose: I don't know the rule, but I think you shouldn't say anything Willie.  It will get sorted out|pg||
nt|debrose: Lots of guesses about the system from specs:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: thxs for the information.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 clubs for all we know was stayman|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It will still be a big pickup for Welland though|pg||
pc|dA|nt|raghavan: overtake pl|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bbramley: my guess is 2NT=3 controls, 3@C=stayman|pg||
nt|raghavan: Adam pushing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s cant be support or spades here must be a cue cos clubs already agreeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: well theyv eha da fe poor results and know they cannot sit on thei laurels with the lead slippin away|pg||
nt|panja: too much activism perhaps, they escaped the penlaty, but not a losing lead|pg||
nt|joest: now that there's no diamond ruff anymore...|pg||
nt|joest: it's a losing lead if Wildavsky guesses what to do|pg||
nt|panja: well..@HA, @S to K, @H ruff and then @S finesse..I would think|pg||
nt|daman: that would be OK|pg||
nt|panja: but he must be thinking of 41 trumps|pg||
nt|daman: because of the non @D lead|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|panja: and then the @H ruff might lead to a later force..|pg||
nt|panja: so..he has to weight that|pg||
nt|daman: nah   he'll just play @Ds|pg||
nt|joest: he might try to protect against 4-1 spades by heart to the ace, spade hook, heart ruff, spade hook|pg||
nt|joest: that seems very reasonable to me|pg||
nt|daman: he is ruffing the @H with short trumps in dummy|pg||
nt|panja: well..if @S are 41...he will get forced|pg||
nt|joest: fromhis perspective no diamond lead might mean no diamond stiff, hence a trump stiff|pg||
nt|pbundy: best lead for the defense.  but - not enough to beat the hand|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: So it wld seem, another 5 IMPs to Welland|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: 4n sign off/|pg||
nt|pef: sorry, I guess with hearts 33 and a non club lead 3nt fetches, doesn't it|pg||
nt|dcbutler: yes - doesn't someone have a theory that it's better to lead from your 4 card suit than your 5 carder?|pg||
nt|pef: although it is possible that after aj of hearts holding, he may use the two diamond entries to lead toward the kq of clubs, taking 2h, 2c, 4d, and 1 spade|pg||
nt|migry: no:) there is a theory that it's better to lead from a 3 card suit than from a 4 vard suit|pg||
nt|pef: he'll have to judge on the play of the hearts whether they are splitting|pg||
pc|h5|nt|debrose: I just noticed Chambers doesn't have a standard 2@C opening.  Sorry, if I'd realized that I wouldn't have even tried to guess. |pg||
nt|daman: here he goes|pg||
nt|jstokes: as expected, 6N in other room on the last hand|pg||
nt|haans: @CK = do not play @D|pg||
nt|raghavan: To avoid ambiguity, S could have played C 10|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|debrose: the responses|pg||
nt|debrose: Willie, just curious.  Are they writing explanations to things or doing the whisper thing?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: They are writing and I cannot see it.|pg||
nt|sybarra: they write in little light pencil scratchings |pg||
nt|Walddk6: They should provide operators with binoculars I think|pg||
nt|debrose: Thanks. |pg||
nt|sybarra: some players hand opertor the sheets of paper,  many do not |pg||
nt|sybarra: *operator|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Even if I receive the paper, i cannot read the writing in many cases.|pg||
nt|sybarra: been there done that |pg||
nt|debrose: So here we see yet another fourth best from longest and strongest opening lead.  And again it's the best lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: as I said,  little scratchings |pg||
nt|debrose: Got it willie, don't even bother trying with Michael's|pg||
nt|migry: they r in 2@h in the other room so if he makes it that will be a much needed pick up|pg||
nt|pef: just on the percentages the ace of clubs onside is more likely, but he may get some clues.  robinson/boyd will try to avoid giving them|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: no blackwood|pg||
nt|pef: so at this level, this is quite an interesting contract to play|pg||
nt|migry: 2@h went down |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: south has CJ pen card from last trick|pg||
nt|pef: ah, even more to think about|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|lestergold: it was i think 4n to play still no harm done but no swing either|pg||
nt|joest: depends on where the diamodn honors are|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|daman: Robinson will pick up at least 6 on this one|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: well 1 or 2 imps only rathe rthan a signioficant swing|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh|pg||
nt|raghavan: good understanding by Hans|pg||
nt|haans: martel giving up|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Welland pondering awhile.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|raghavan: Hi wille - not heard you till now|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: needed a @C thru but maybe all the same |pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: 70 points less for playing in clubs so 2 imps|pg||
nt|migry: now he knows |pg||
nt|migry: he needs the hearts|pg||
nt|migry: so he'll make it|pg||
nt|pef: good play by roy welland.  much harder to duck the j of hearts, now he can try both if he wanted to|pg||
nt|pef: of course opps just tried the clubs for him so he needs hearts to split|pg||
nt|pef: and since they do, an 11 imp gain for welland and the match back to 24 imps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: old question finesse trumps now|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||

pc|c3|nt|daman: great board for Robinson|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|daman: did they make 10 tricks operator?|pg||

mb|3D|nt|lestergold: if n/s stay out of it they may gain some imps|pg||
nt|dcbutler: same auction in the other room|pg||
nt|pef: I'm quite surprised boyd passed 3 vul. at imps|pg||
nt|panja: I dont think NS would like to try this....3N it would be|pg||
nt|lestergold: downside of opening hands on a pile of festering garbage|pg||
nt|lestergold: and west is lucky that partner's ten of clubs measn his qj clubs is working!|pg||
nt|haans: decl may be squeezed|pg||
nt|raghavan: "Welland CC says - open with 11, aggressive bids and may not have what is promised by bids"|pg||
nt|lestergold: admkittedly favourable vulnerability but ive seen a lot of bad results in this competition with people being over aggressive at these colours|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt may go down best lead|pg||
nt|jstokes: yes, one needs to give partner room -- this East hand was just too good for Willenken to avoid the X|pg||
nt|lestergold: i measn something qwrong when east has every inch of his business double and would have without the ten of clubs walking inot 1n+1 doubled!|pg||
nt|xenya: on 26, a natutal lead by Berkowitz let 3@H make|pg||
nt|pbundy: maybe if he finds out partner doesn't have 4 in either major he will sign off|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: W passed in Open|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and so far they are not even in the auction|pg||

nt|raghavan: not now 5 clubs + 2 Aes|pg||
nt|pbundy: i would pass myself|pg||
nt|cindy:  W is trying to appear very small in his chair :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: you might hear 4@D here..............  |pg||
mb|4D|nt|pef: would you guys pass on the south hand in these conditions?|pg||
nt|migry: south did the right thing to pass - he is "expected" to hold 7-8 points and this is what he has including the useless K@d |pg||
nt|pef: yes the k of diamonds may be worthless, but |pg||
nt|daman: missed opportunity|pg||
nt|jstokes: heart shift now will beat it (but not really a possibility)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Pretty easy hand :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Around the ranch, Robinson 83-33 over Fleisher|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Nickell 38-25 over Jacobs|pg||
nt|pbundy: and - we do|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: good|pg||
nt|cindy:  i would open the N hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: but here comes the n/scaval;ry charge|pg||
nt|henryb: bidding is risky: Weinstein's minors might be reversed. Perhaps Weinstein should only bid 3@s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: operator tired also |pg||
nt|migry: i wd always pass with the south hand - probably double with North|pg||
nt|lestergold: how can it go off clubs established for 5 clubs and two acs|pg||
nt|pbundy: that's the problem with overcalling 1NT on a hand like this - when you have an aggressive partner|pg||
nt|pbundy: thought 4@S is not the worst game in the world|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: missing a pass ? |pg||
nt|lestergold: north hand has merits as an opener but not mandatory Cindy!|pg||
nt|cherdano:  or a self-splinter with 4@D?|pg||
nt|daman: 3 more after this and 18 IMPs to tie|pg||
nt|henryb: I think that could show a weird 2-suiter, say 6-6|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@s would set trumps and let partner cue with a suitable hand|pg||
nt|clarsen: hard to  understand 3 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: 2@S here should just mean nothing else to bid.  Either no spade stopper, or in this case not eager to play NT from your side|pg||
nt|bbramley: the @S lead will scare declarer, but he doesn't have much choice about how to play|pg||
nt|cindy:  no :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a few imps back |pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w 's spirited auction has kept them out of a no play game|pg||
nt|cindy:  thats what happened at other table...N opened|pg||
nt|dcbutler: i agree - move the king to another suit, and bidding game seems auto red at imps|pg||
nt|daman: he got them to do what he wanted    his partner just didn't lead his singleton|pg||
nt|panja: nuisance call, hoping to escape and land a punch in the process...he almost succeeded|pg||
nt|joest: in fairness the range is so wide that when Doub only raised to 3 Weinstein wasn't sure whose hand it was|pg||
nt|joest: but 4@d on the way can't be crimed|pg||
nt|haans: and spade stopper|pg||
nt|jstokes: could have taken 1D, 3H, 2S and a club double dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: what if north doesnt hold up gets on and establishes his 7 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If dummy had only @s10, 1nt had been unbeatable|pg||
nt|lestergold: is he still squeezed out of a trick/|pg||
nt|jstokes: kibs pointing out that declarer will have some pitching problems on the diamonds|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes probable|pg||
nt|cindy:  well the problem is they were both aggressive|pg||
nt|pbundy: i just don't think declarer can handle it this time|pg||
nt|pbundy: weinstein doesn't know that garner doesn't have 15 to 18.........|pg||
nt|cindy:  its worth 15|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S in 5@D dbl in Open This could be the decicing board|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes it could|pg||
nt|mcarroll: deciding|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: Although North seems to think South showed something in spades.  What would he do with xxx, T9x, Kx, AKQxx?|pg||
nt|debrose: Maybe he figures they have noplace better to play opposite a hand like that, though 4@H seems possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes he does havwe problem didn see it at fist|pg||
nt|pbundy: a spy tells me that in the open room, n/s is declaring 5@DX|pg||
nt|pbundy: with trump leads, 5@D has no chance|pg||
nt|pbundy: apparently the queen of spades was lead against 5@DX - but again, i think that even with great guessing, declarer is a goner|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cindy:  i dont think this has any chance either|pg||
nt|cindy:  bad luck|pg||
pc|d5|nt|panja: correct @C play here would be @CA and then small to J?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Vugraphu8: pitch 1 h and 1 spade.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but this @s10....|pg||
nt|jstokes: then loses 3 spades, 3 diamonds, and a club|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there is the reason why its not a mandatory opener|pg||
nt|joest: anyway this hand shouldn't take very long|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|bbramley: i like to bid suits where i have something rather than suits where i don't - i might bid 3@C or 3@D|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bbramley: anyway, north also has nothing better to bid|pg||
nt|debrose: North had no good bid, and I guess didn't want to distort his hand in some other way.  I don't think it's really playable to agree 2@S shows anything more than xxx in spades|pg||
nt|debrose: like Bart said:)|pg||
nt|pbundy: well; when the opponents bid to the 3 level, they don't always have flat hands|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bbramley: when you're already in a game force it's normal to assume that responder has some natural descriptive bid available|pg||
nt|raghavan: South with 14 could have said 2NT|pg||
nt|haans: spadde first then hearts|pg||
nt|cindy:  decent splits in the black suits and a different story|pg||
nt|mcarroll: if both contracts go down 1, the gap is 2, if more we have a new leader|pg||
pc|c2|nt|debrose: Maybe.  I specifically have the agreement with regular partners that 4th suit in 2/1 auctions is assumed not to be anything much in that suit |pg||
nt|debrose: Taking two finesses into the six-card spade suit is not a pleasant prospect for declarer, but as Bart said not much choice.|pg||
nt|debrose: There's a little something in the fact that Rosenberg didn't overcall - but could easily have one king|pg||
nt|debrose: I'm asked about the 2@H rebid, and it's noted that the rebid was 2@D in the other room.  There are lots of ways to treat opener's rebid in this auction - too complicated to get ...|pg||
nt|debrose: into now I think|pg||
nt|debrose: Though if Cohler, who certainly has no attractive discard, takes long enough perhaps we could write a book on the subject |pg||
nt|bbramley: more significant is that the tank strongly suggests that cohler has both red kings|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Cohler is thinking for a long time now. Schermer might draw some logical conclusions from this long wait.|pg||
nt|roswolf: seemed a mite optimistic for a slam try|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: sometimes partner does not have a fit with one of ur black suits and he adds up his points and insists onm game|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bbramley: same start in other room|pg||
nt|haans: they get the cent now|pg||
nt|lestergold: will west be sure now that a psade is correct|pg||
nt|lestergold: Martel concealed his 6clubs|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|joest: not with hearts wide open|pg||
nt|pbundy: garner probably realizes the club ace is an ominous sign. stansby might well have ducked with more than 1 club|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|clarsen: partner doesnt wish to be in game facing a limit raise|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|daman: finesse a @C and claim|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: well done|pg||
nt|cindy:  club up now|pg||
nt|pbundy: i see more people joining our table...... are any of the other matches now over?|pg||
nt|pbundy: thanks everyone; apparently this match is closest|pg||
nt|pbundy: as one spec said - this is the only match that is not "over"|pg||
nt|pbundy: and of course, in USA  ! - they have a bunch more hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Garner is working out some variations I believe.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chorush: this mtach will be tied if Garner goes set 1, Struhl will lead by 2 if he goes set 2|pg||
nt|cindy:  nail biter|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: E under pressure now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|debrose: Lots of comments/complaints from specs.  Cohler is generally a fast player and people should realize how different it is for the players from us looking at all the hands|pg||
nt|raghavan: got it|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|bbramley: now, after the @HK pops up on the 2nd round, declarer can cash @DA before leading up|pg||
pc|sK|nt|daman: no further finesses needed|pg||
nt|jstokes: almost|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|cindy:  up to 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|raghavan: made|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bbramley: lev also didn't cash @DA - seems like a completely safe play, and east is known to have only 4 minor-suit cards by now|pg||
nt|debrose: Cohler wouldn't want to pitch a heart from a holding such as xxxx, so while his huddle obviously means some problem, it's not a full read on his hand.  Anyway, declarer has no real ...|pg||
nt|debrose: choices|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: oh premature congrats|pg||
nt|haans: bridge is funny sometimes :)|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|jstokes: maybe Welland should have led small spade?|pg||

nt|roswolf: a trappy hand for n/s|pg||
mb|1C|an|alert|nt|debrose: Ok, good question Barnet.  I believe Bart said he could have done it after the @HK came up on the second round, while he had a heart entry to hand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  good result by Welland|pg||
nt|cherdano:  in the other room|pg||
nt|pbundy: definitely a nail biter now!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: this time we jump in with 3 @C |pg||

nt|cindy:  bam now|pg||
nt|cindy:  almost|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course, the players have no idea....  for all garner/weinstein realize, the grand and some others may have been pushes|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I'm not sure, cards were played too quickly. Probably exited with a diamond after cashing spade Ace.|pg||
nt|cindy:  sounds right|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pef: not a real slam here unless you hugely overbid and can bar a diamond lead :)|pg||
nt|joest: this will be Exhibit A for Edgar Kaplan's maxim: "take out your partner's take out doubles"|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@d = transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Open room 2C +1|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s e/w limit|pg||
mb|3N|nt|panja: needs a trump lead to restrict to 11|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@h = real support|pg||
nt|clarsen: doubt billy bid 4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: !1d tends to show a distributional hand|pg||
nt|joest: so a good chance Garner has a spade stiff|pg||
nt|joest: might induce Weinstein to trot out a 'two places to play' 4NT|pg||
nt|panja: it must be right to pull?|pg||
nt|joest: or just to bid 5@c|pg||
nt|joest: since the MOST his partner could have is four hearts while he might have five club s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3c for n/s|pg||
nt|roswolf: missed out a pass operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no fireworks here|pg||
nt|pbundy: this hand looks flat to me|pg||
nt|mcarroll: That would make sense @S  not an option when he knows the remaining distribution|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I asked him and he confirmed down 1.|pg||
nt|cindy:  so the score is wrong ?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Really?|pg||
nt|chorush: if he was really down 1 the match is tied|pg||
nt|pbundy: i once saw soloway revoke on vugraph in a doubled part score.  so - anything is possible|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bbramley: we have very bad weather imminent - could lose power|pg||
nt|joest: well he can win imps by leading a trump|pg||
nt|lestergold: even thlo e/w have the point majority|pg||
nt|lestergold: the club position is the key factor|pg||
nt|sybarra: willy?|pg||
nt|pbundy: i also saw a world class player not take his 9 top tricks in 3nt in this event a few days ago!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: kj cl;ubs waste paper in offence and defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: players and operator  tired is my bet |pg||
nt|roswolf: very possibly|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: mind you if a spade is returnedwest can make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|pef: k of diamonds lead will gain an imp for his side|pg||
nt|roswolf: this contract looks down|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|pef: probably|pg||
nt|pbundy: but - the score remains at lose 12 for welland|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dcbutler: what's your preference over 1D with the east hand?|pg||
nt|panja: against he holds @H and @C, partner bid @D, trump lead has a lot going for it...single dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: so here e/w get away with it|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|pef: good question|pg||

nt|pef: migry?|pg||
nt|joest: both east wests will be thrilled to learn that is a push|pg||
nt|daman: they had Doub for 500 in the OR but misdefended|pg||

nt|pbundy: i don't know if martel/stansby play transfers here or not|pg||
mb|2H|nt|panja: 4@H should make for NS|pg||
nt|joest: Cohen and Smith decided to make it a bit more challenging by climbing to 5@h next door|pg||
nt|lestergold: not 3n or 4h byu elimination 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|ralfwil: correct Hans!|pg||

nt|haans: stansby have not finished|pg||
nt|lestergold: you can get into trouble for saying the f word|pg||

mb|d|an|alert|nt|daman: on 103   meckwell are in 6 @S XX  on a @D lead|pg||
nt|joest: pass denies three spdes|pg||
nt|daman: Williken bid 1@S in the OR which I assume was a transfer to 1NT|pg||
nt|pbundy: i would expect martel to show his hearts tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: they bid both of S's suits|pg||
nt|daman: would 2@S have been a better bid wioth the South hand?|pg||
nt|panja: with reds, surely|pg||
nt|pbundy: and - i'm guessing that the double is takeout......|pg||
nt|chorush: this will make it difficult for garner-weinstein to get to 3NT|pg||
mb|3D|nt|raghavan: by elimination only D|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: or would it be natural?|pg||
nt|joest: NF|pg||

nt|ralfwil: You can whisper it to me Mike!|pg||
nt|onebid: I know!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This f-word Judy?|pg||
nt|haans: martel: what have i done|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Well Welland has picked up some IMPs, mainly on Larry's tough declarer plays, which certainly copuld have swung them around.|pg||
nt|clarsen: can make 4h without spade lead i believe|pg||
nt|cindy:  3@h now ?|pg||
nt|pbundy: weinstein might bid 3@H to show a partial stopper|pg||
nt|chorush: I think he has to just grab it|pg||
nt|pbundy: we have predictions of grabbing and 3@S.......|pg||
mb|3H|nt|debrose: Good result coming for Meltzer from the other table on the last board.  I guess I've gotta get up and pace now|pg||
nt|lestergold: heard or Martel to ghet excited with his sole asset in one of east's f suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard i mean|pg||
nt|pbundy: and - my prediction of 3@H, partial stopper :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: i know my howard weinstein! |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can they make 6 @S here|pg||
nt|joest: 4@c by west??|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jstokes: I'm sure excitement is far from Martel's mind -- more like how can I get out of this cheaply|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm not a very large pot of honey for n/s here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: yes|pg||
nt|joest: south passed 2@d?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: thx :)|pg||
nt|joest: so Smith and Cohen have a disaster in the other room bidding to 5@h voluntarily|pg||
nt|daman: could be another big gain here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This will be another Quickie|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No interference bidding in Open and E in 3NT|pg||
nt|pbundy: well done on a tough hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|debrose: And I was just reminded, by my own brother of all people, that Cohler may actually be up only 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: getting lots of yeses and some with no's on a club lead |pg||
nt|panja: three Aces cashed first..and then Club ruff..and x ruff..the point is is it a good idea to cash @HA early?|pg||
nt|clarsen: good lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: think with ace of @H,  a @S lead looks auto |pg||
nt|pbundy: of course, a push will not help the welland team|pg||
nt|cindy:  unless the score is wrong on 57|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|debrose: On board 55 it appeared to us that Chambers made 2@H when he claimed down 1.  That may get corrected|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pef: wow, that's a really aggressive 2nt call by welland|pg||

nt|daman: Wildavsky is in 3@C doubled on Board 120 and will make it     this match could be over|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pbundy: i think all roads lead to 430|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|pef: turns out now he's most likely down|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|mcarroll: and a push|pg||
pc|h6|nt|debrose: Pacing no longer feels good enough after looking further at Board 60.  Meditation has been suggested, but that's never worked for me.  Hmm, what to do|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: go to bar and wait for results?|pg||
nt|joest: it appears as though if smith had adopted this line in the other room this would have been a push|pg||
nt|lestergold: somewhere along the way that ten of spades may be the thorn for declarer|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|ralfwil: @s8 can have costed!|pg||

nt|lestergold: yep the pesky spade ten is promoted|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chorush: must be very tired if he hasnt claimed|pg||

nt|xenya:  W gave it some thought|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@d is a 4=4=1=4 or (43)=1=5 with 10-15 I believe|pg||
nt|cindy:  4@s|pg||
nt|pbundy: my guess is that at most, 1 imp changes hands on this board|pg||
nt|cindy:  they can beat 4@s|pg||
nt|chorush: 4 spades by Strul is a superb resut for them with 5 diamonds potentially makeable|pg||

pc|d2|nt|sybarra: this is last bd.  |pg||
nt|raghavan: Ma land in3NT|pg||

nt|dcbutler: refusing to allow the opponents to play in their eight card fit at the two level|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: probably|pg||
nt|joest: i think the final session gets underway in about 20 minutes but don't quote me on that|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks..|pg||
pc|s2|nt|debrose: I don't think scoring mistake, if there was one, on 55 was made by operator.  he told us he heard neil say down one.  but fact remains if he made the tricks, that will be changed.|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Willie, our wonderful operator in White Plains |pg||
nt|debrose: sorry, folks, can't answer all the comments/questions.  appeciate the good wishes and advice thx|pg||
nt|raghavan: N cannot play S, D so may try Ca|pg||
nt|lestergold: ten tricks another close result maye ll|pg||
nt|lestergold: on spade switch|pg||
nt|migry: east denied 3 cards in spades |pg||
nt|migry: so 2@s now shows a doubleton|pg||
nt|pef: well that's an ugly contract|pg||
nt|migry: no idea why west had to bid at all with 6 points and no fit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|joest: in a just world one of the spade honors might be in the opening bidder's hand :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pef: 8 points, but who's counting|pg||
nt|daman: Thanks to Arend Bayer and Henry Bethe for their insights|pg||
nt|xenya: tricky hand -- even on this fortunate lie|pg||
nt|clarsen: looks like this will make on the nose|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Debbie and Bart for joining the commentary and sharing your thoughts on these hands |pg||

nt|cindy:  exciting finish|pg||

nt|pbundy: who knew at the beginning that it would tighten up this much!?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|panja: and where would you place the @S9? and what break?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: they don get any closer than this|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mittmouse: a routine win by 1|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pef: I predict down 2|pg||
mc|10|nt|vdoubleu: Larry is busy trying to figure out red-suit honors|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, and he knows Larry is ruffing this|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Does Larry know that?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: He might be placing declarer w/KQxxx of hearts + Diamond A|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: That's possible... it's much easier from up here :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: If that is what he has, then no need to ruff this.|pg||
nt|mittmouse: sorry 2|pg||
nt|pbundy: scores will need to be checked, folks|pg||
nt|pbundy: thanks for watching everyone - and, thanks to everyone at BBO and the USBF for providing us with this incredible opportunity to watch the best of bridge|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It looks like a definite win for Welland, because the board we are ubcertain about would if changed increase the margin to 5 - but of course we have to wait for official ...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: confirmation|pg||
