nt|kareno: The ghoulies have been flying at this tournament.  I remember a hand with three eight-card suits and it was a slam swing!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: I think so, Barnet.  I think you get in shape and up for playing.|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: I don't mince words with hands like west's.  I bid them out quickly to give the opponents one shot to figure out what to do.|pg||

mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|kareno: Very unlucky with a nine-card suit.  Declarer likely to go down an extra taking a heart finesse trying to make his contract.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|chorush: Granovetter has 10 tricks but will probably try the cub finesse and go set 2|pg||

nt|barnets: its his only chance|pg||
nt|chorush: I think he is certain to finesse club. Getting more than 3-1 imp odds|pg||
nt|kareno: Undoubled the extra undertrick is not very expensive relative to making his vulnerable contract.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|barnets: zia gave x a slight though before passing 5@D|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|kareno: Declarer will first try to see if there's any possible (but highly unlikely) squeeze before he plays on clubs.|pg||
nt|chorush: granovetter will finesse club if Hmman overtakes and returns. If not, he will run all his diamonds which would force hamman to stiff his club, so wont finesse|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Hamman leaning back in his chair with his arms crossed, thinking about whether to overtake|pg||
nt|kareno: Does Hamman have to overtake and play a club to break up a possible double squeeze with hearts as the anchor suit?  |pg||
nt|barnets: i think its the same|pg||
nt|kareno: I trust Hamman to work this one out.  Spec (and I) think he may have to do that.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|chorush: Hamman has to worry that granovetter started 9-4 with AQxx hearts; then overtake and club sould be fata|pg||

nt|barnets: after having opened 1@H canape|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Zia says something about thought he could get another by playing a spade but "my courage"  wasn't there|pg||
nt|barnets: with east bidding 3@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|an|STR, ART, F|nt|Walddk2: This event will determine which two teams will be representing USA in the Bermuda Bowl to be held in São Paulo, Brazil, in late August and early September |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The losers in the semi-finals will get another chance tomorrow in the repechage for the USA2 berth|pg||
mb|1N|an|minors|nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Jan Martel|pg||
nt|jbgood: we are surely in good hands then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like we missed the first three boards|pg||
nt|athene: south could double here perhaps|pg||
nt|chorush: could have a lot of action on this hand. NS have 10 tricks in diamonds EW 11 in hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: 1nt over forcing @c showing minors.  South should come to life here.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|barnets: e/w found the vul save in5@D in other room|pg||
nt|kareno: I predict Zia will not pass.|pg||
nt|kareno: You mean n/s?|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s that should be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@DX next door. Ekeblad bid 2NT over 1@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter asked about 1NT and Zia wrote something and now G is writing and sort of shrugging - so I assume he's saying 2@h was basically natural, but all of our pens have ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: disappeared, so it's in pencil and I can't read|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bigtrain: 9.5 hours|pg||
nt|athene: i would want to get the spades into it i think|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I'm sorry about the first 3 boards, the players started before we could|pg||
nt|athene: but he decides to make the pressure bid|pg||
nt|kareno: Zia has nine minor suit cards and a partner who bid vulnerable.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter apparently told Zia that 2@h was NF, but now Zia asks Rubin, who says "2@h was game forcing"|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: So probably 6 more IMPs to the Fleisher total|pg||
nt|kareno: Had he bid 4@d originally, they may have found the save.  |pg||
pc|c2|nt|barnets: but cant x as partner thinks you have a real hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: should be "easy" to win 4@h on a @d lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Kamil: "teach you to reopen :)"|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|chorush: assuming that declarer takes 10 tricks in the other room, this will be another 6 imps to fleischer|pg||

mc|11|nt|chorush: We have seen Nickell come back from a margin of this size in 16 boards. However fleischer is playing in excellent form and good luck|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rubin & Granovetter now discussing and agree that 2@h was NF, because they play Unusual vs Unusual here|pg||
nt|kareno: So the question will be:  will Nickell try for another patented recovery or rest up for the next round.  I suspect they will play one more set before they take that decision.  ...|pg||

mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Good to have Walter with us although I bet he wish he had been playing still|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 2@H is a better singlw raise than 2@S|pg||
nt|chorush: I would guess it is fit showing|pg||
nt|barnets: not sure they need the rest -- this is their first match|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: it's common to use transfers after overcalls|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bigtrain: yes -- enjoy being here but miss the table already|pg||
nt|athene: so instead of 2@C being the good raise, and 2red natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: 4c looks like a fit jump|pg||
nt|barnets: showing clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Hamman just wrote that 4@c showed @cs and @hs|pg||
mb|4N|nt|kareno: I doubt Hamman will sell|pg||
nt|chorush: Hamman-Zia need to take a -300 save here to obtain par. Im quite sure Hamman will bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Hamman thinking|pg||
mb|6H|nt|athene: you play 2@C is diamonds, 2@D is hearts, 2@H is the raise|pg||
nt|barnets: of course e/w can make 51S|pg||
mb|6S|nt|athene: this solves the problem of "new suit after overcall is forcing or not?"|pg||
nt|chorush: yes I misspoke, par is -500 which Hamman has now achieved|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe better than that|pg||
nt|kareno: And beyond par!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you can have your cake and eat it|pg||

nt|barnets: hamman was never in|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't he still make it?|pg||
nt|chorush: yes diamond finesse|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Diamond finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or a squeeze. anything works|pg||
nt|kareno: Now north will get caught in a positional squeeze between heart ace and diamond queen.|pg||
nt|barnets: north realises the only chance is to run the !J so he will probably cover it lest Zia has the 10xx|pg||

nt|barnets: the combination is very hard to beat|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Please understand that the commentators may not have time to respond to private chat messages. No offence intended. Useful info much appreciated though|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are we sure they did not switched seats? That was a very aggressive raise which would have been typical of Meckwell|pg||
nt|bigtrain: rusinow from length (4+) -- standard otherwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: We're sure|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to decide whether this is @SQx or @SQJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Fleisher asks again - Rodwell - "can lead the Q from AQJ, normally Q has K but can be from QJ with no more than 3 cards in the suit"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Makes it tough on declarer. An ambiguous queen|pg||
nt|barnets: the lucky spade lie means dec can make the hand|pg||
nt|barnets: on any leas|pg||
nt|athene: he can build a heart trick|pg||
nt|barnets: lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he has to guess now, Barnet|pg||
nt|athene: so get 3 spades, 4 diamonds, @CA, @H|pg||
nt|barnets: yes right he can but may not|pg||
nt|athene: you wouldn't play for 3-3 clubs|pg||
nt|athene: as the defence could surely take two clubs and three hearts anyway if you tried that |pg||
nt|athene: if the @HJ is wrong|pg||

nt|athene: +600 now|pg||
nt|athene: of course, if you attack hearts, the defence might attack clubs :)|pg||
nt|athene: north may go in with the @HK|pg||
nt|jbgood: so i have to withdraw my original comment about the result of the overbid - and apologize:)|pg||
nt|athene: trying to persuade declarer he has @HAK|pg||
nt|athene: but normally you should just ignore these traps and go for the 'a priori' odds|pg||
nt|athene: this is something more commonly seen when you have K10x or Q10x under AJ9|pg||
nt|jbgood: thanks kibs for trying to comfort me:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Eric isn't trying to fool declarer, he's trying to decide what the right play is|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's normal play is to hook the 9, so you put the honour in|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c4|pc|h4|nt|barnets: maybe  north will work out his only chance is if partner has QJ10x|pg||
nt|barnets: in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: the diamond play was quite revealing|pg||
nt|barnets: but would be very hard|pg||
nt|athene: that telegraphed declarer's diamond strength to the defence|pg||
nt|barnets: even for rod well|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell studying, now picked up his hand, put it back down, leaning on table in "thinker" pose|pg||
nt|barnets: so will he play the @Ck|pg||
nt|athene: yes, and the @C9 starts earning its keep|pg||
nt|barnets: if he knows east has 4 diamond tricks he can count 9 with a slow heart|pg||
nt|dburn: if South had @cQJ10x, he would not have led a spade|pg||
nt|athene: also the opening lead really suggestst Meckstroth's best suit is clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: thats not clear at all|pg||
nt|dburn: so Rodwell can dismiss that from his mind, and start thinking about other possibilities|pg||
nt|barnets: with 5 clubs on left|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Still thinking|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure you lead @CQJ10x - that could just give the whole suit|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|chorush: One of the prices that a big club system pays is getting to the wrong part score on a hand like this but |pg||
nt|kareno: Tame board after the last two.|pg||
nt|chorush: yes, tame, but will be worth 5 or soimps to Nickell. Desperately needed imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: For the next segment, which starts at 3:45 here, we plan to show the two semi-final matches and Ozdil-Strul, which was 15-17 at the quarter|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|barnets: with k9xxx on left|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, Im not sure you would lead a club, no|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: short break|pg||
nt|dburn: but you probably would not lead a spade from a weak QJ holding either - you would do something rather more passive|pg||
nt|barnets: that is a big result e/w|pg||
nt|athene: Meckstroth returned @H there presumably|pg||

nt|Walddk2: But you can't live on part-scores alone when you are this much down|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes these auctions tell the defence enough that you get the underlead in hearts at trick 1|pg||

nt|barnets: hamman maybe can smith|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|kareno: An interesting question which club to win as west.  I think it would be the queen.|pg||
nt|kareno: If they use it he can.|pg||
nt|chorush: Crane believed strongly in leading his 4 card suit v NT instead of his 5 card suit|pg||
nt|kareno: He has echoed in hearts.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|barnets: now will zia realise north did not play the @h10  |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|barnets: so work out to play clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: That lead is known as the Australian lead (with a nod to Crane) as there is some theory in Australia about leading the short suit here.|pg||
nt|barnets: now he will take his time|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: and try and work it out|pg||
nt|kareno: Do we know if n/s play Smith?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: yes, they do|pg||
nt|barnets: zia spends hours discussing these situations|pg||
nt|chorush: Even if they don't play Smith, the combination of the low club lead and Hammans plays in hearts should work|pg||
nt|kareno: If Zia plays back the club it will be down two as he wins his nine for the spade through.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: G still thinking, frowning a little, looking at the heart K|pg||
nt|barnets: perha[s west thinking may also help south|pg||
pc|dA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|barnets: he knows west has not an easy club discard|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Zia had his hand on a club (I think not the smallest) but now has folded up his cards and is staring at the dummy and thinking|pg||
pc|c2|nt|barnets: well done ns|pg||
nt|kareno: If a spade lead was going to beat this, Hamman would have led one at trick one.|pg||
nt|kareno: Deuce is current count.  They won't go wrong.|pg||
nt|barnets: I am sure the way hamman played his hearts helped him|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Now Granovetter is thinking again, cards folded up, leaning on his hand, elbow on the table.|pg||
nt|kareno: He can think all he wants, Matt Granovetter cannot make this one.|pg||
nt|kareno: This may be the famous Sominex Coup.|pg||
nt|barnets: and a great opening lead from hamman|pg||
nt|kareno: Think long enough to put the defense to sleep so they misdefend :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Now he's looking at the ceiling|pg||
nt|barnets: he is thinking about an extra undertrick|pg||
nt|chorush: yes could be 11 imps back to Nickell if they beat this 2 and make in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Guess it didn't help, has put his hand back on his cheek and staring at the table|pg||
nt|barnets: if somehow he could stop zia getting in to lead a spade|pg||
nt|barnets: but he cant|pg||
nt|kareno: Ira Rubin is the master of the Sominex Coup :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Could be a big swing.|pg||

nt|athene: perhaps they will chalk it up as a small gain, with their teammates in 6nt :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Kamil: "I led the right suit, just the wrong card - should have led the Q from QJ :)"|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: He's back|pg||
nt|chorush: In the other room, declarer went set 2 in 3NT despite getting a spade lead, so there was no swing|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Now Hamman has gone to th bathroom|pg||
nt|barnets: yes he tried to make 3n without trying the @Hsuit|pg||
nt|barnets: and led clubs himself|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Is that the closed room?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 7 more IMPs coming to Fleisher on board 69. N-S allowed to play in 5@C|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: *deny 6@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Vugraphu1: Really that all the other bids are specific, so 2NT can't bid anything else :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: He doesn't want them led but he wants to compete to at least the two-level.|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|kareno: Again, specs, see how hard these experts fight for every part score.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter: "good luck"|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Thanks to you too, Jon|pg||
nt|athene: east is worried that 3@S says "no club stop"?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: but in that case he knows they are off @CAKQ anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so 5minor can't be there|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Kamil: "well, I wish I had something for you - I'll try to spread them out so it looks like I have something"|pg||
nt|jbgood: Last, but not least, the inputs from you specs is really appreciated! Hope you all enjoyed this marvelous show, which will continue after a short break.|pg||
nt|barnets: so with n/s only able to take 2 club tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|barnets: tis is e/w lucky day|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|barnets: 3n better from west hand|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|Vugraphu1: Fleisher shows Rod his hand and they all claim|pg||
nt|athene: they are off the @SA too, so sometimes 3n will go down with 5@C making i suppose|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D making sry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next set scheduled to start 25 minutes past the hour. They may have an early restart, but in that case we can't showing anything until play has finished in the other match too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's how it is; sorry for the inconvenience if it happens|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all and bye for now|pg||

nt|jbgood: thanks and bye all|pg||
nt|barnets: missed slam in closed finally pts to nickell|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: The limit in this vugraph room is 2500 specs, so if I were you, I would not give up my seat|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kareno: They will defeat this as long as they don't lead diamonds (and they won't).|pg||
nt|chorush: this is a likely push; had Hamman not bid 2H would have lost 5|pg||
nt|kareno: Absoutely, specs, don't give up your seats!!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rubin studying|pg||
nt|barnets: the lead is 77 (sunset strip) for the older specs|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kareno: Imagine, the best bridge on the planet and you have a FREE ringside seat.  What other sport do the players pay and the specs come and watch free?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Thanks all for watching; we hope you enjoyed the show. Much more later after the lunch/dinner break depending where in the world you are|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, specs point out poker and I agree.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|chorush: No team in bridge other than Nickell has a history of coming back from deficits this large. But Fleischer is playing in good form and good luck. Tonight there may be fireworks. Be ...|pg||
nt|chorush: sure not to miss them|pg||
