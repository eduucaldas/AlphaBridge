pc|d7|pc|h3|nt|plateos: Yes they were systematically in a bad place. Unfortunately from the Finnish point of view beating this needs concentration (decl cannot get out of dummy)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharynr: perhaps 2 rounds of @S to see it 10 drops...before playing a @C|pg||
nt|plateos: @h now gives declarer (atleast DD) chance by unblocking the 1H and then @d|pg||
