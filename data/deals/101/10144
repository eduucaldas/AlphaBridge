nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry, I was a board behind and still thinking they were in 4, so claimed making|pg||
nt|athene: NS might perhaps be able to diagnose they have a decent balanced hand facing a trick source|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: there was a hand on the BridgeBase forums the other day involving a 2nd seat unfavourable 3-opener|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: someone suggested that a simulation which was run didn't account for the possibility of a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|athene: "NO expert" said the poster|pg||
nt|athene: "would open on 6"|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: First three boards were flat|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: but in the real world, things are a little bit different|pg||

nt|bigtrain: precision makes it important to get diamonds in however you can|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h4|pc|c5|pc|cK|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that's the main reason you will see very aggressive @D preempts|pg||
nt|athene: i think there's more of a case for opening a weak-2 or a pre-empt in a minor with four HEARTS, than with four SPADES |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: if you have a 4-4 heart fit, often they are outbidding you in spades anyway|pg||
nt|athene: but you are less happy about missing 4-4 spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Please understand that the commentators may not have time to respond to private chat messages. No offence intended. Useful info much appreciated though|pg||
nt|athene: but Meckstroth has shown he is happy to bid 3@D with 6@D - 4 of either major, as we just saw a moment ago|pg||

nt|athene: tricky lead problem for Meckstroth|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Fleisher asks about lead - Rusinow|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Are we sure they did not switched seats? That was a very aggressive raise which would have been typical of Meckwell|pg||
nt|bigtrain: rusinow from length (4+) -- standard otherwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: We're sure|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to decide whether this is @SQx or @SQJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Fleisher asks again - Rodwell - "can lead the Q from AQJ, normally Q has K but can be from QJ with no more than 3 cards in the suit"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Makes it tough on declarer. An ambiguous queen|pg||
nt|barnets: the lucky spade lie means dec can make the hand|pg||
nt|barnets: on any leas|pg||
nt|athene: he can build a heart trick|pg||
nt|barnets: lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he has to guess now, Barnet|pg||
nt|athene: so get 3 spades, 4 diamonds, @CA, @H|pg||
nt|barnets: yes right he can but may not|pg||
nt|athene: you wouldn't play for 3-3 clubs|pg||
nt|athene: as the defence could surely take two clubs and three hearts anyway if you tried that |pg||
nt|athene: if the @HJ is wrong|pg||
nt|athene: and if it isn't, you are better off playing for a heart trick|pg||
pc|s5|nt|barnets: bold bidding e/w with 13 opp 10|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: ok he gets the spades right|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: unblocking to preserve @D10 as dummy entry|pg||
nt|athene: +600 now|pg||
nt|athene: of course, if you attack hearts, the defence might attack clubs :)|pg||
nt|athene: north may go in with the @HK|pg||
nt|jbgood: so i have to withdraw my original comment about the result of the overbid - and apologize:)|pg||
nt|athene: trying to persuade declarer he has @HAK|pg||
nt|athene: but normally you should just ignore these traps and go for the 'a priori' odds|pg||
nt|athene: this is something more commonly seen when you have K10x or Q10x under AJ9|pg||
nt|jbgood: thanks kibs for trying to comfort me:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Eric isn't trying to fool declarer, he's trying to decide what the right play is|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's normal play is to hook the 9, so you put the honour in|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe  north will work out his only chance is if partner has QJ10x|pg||
nt|barnets: in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: the diamond play was quite revealing|pg||
nt|barnets: but would be very hard|pg||
nt|athene: that telegraphed declarer's diamond strength to the defence|pg||
nt|barnets: even for rod well|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell studying, now picked up his hand, put it back down, leaning on table in "thinker" pose|pg||
nt|barnets: so will he play the @Ck|pg||
nt|athene: yes, and the @C9 starts earning its keep|pg||
nt|barnets: if he knows east has 4 diamond tricks he can count 9 with a slow heart|pg||
nt|dburn: if South had @cQJ10x, he would not have led a spade|pg||
nt|athene: also the opening lead really suggestst Meckstroth's best suit is clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: thats not clear at all|pg||
nt|dburn: so Rodwell can dismiss that from his mind, and start thinking about other possibilities|pg||
nt|barnets: with 5 clubs on left|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Still thinking|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure you lead @CQJ10x - that could just give the whole suit|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|barnets: with k9xxx on left|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, Im not sure you would lead a club, no|pg||
mc|10|nt|Vugraphu1: short break|pg||
nt|dburn: but you probably would not lead a spade from a weak QJ holding either - you would do something rather more passive|pg||
nt|barnets: that is a big result e/w|pg||
nt|athene: Meckstroth returned @H there presumably|pg||
nt|athene: so the @H8 was the overtrick|pg||
