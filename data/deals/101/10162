nt|sybarra: true is tough, but we have seen great come backs before even in this tourney |pg||
nt|sybarra: we certain have 2 great pairs to watch |pg||
nt|gambit: Levin (if I recall correctly) was "King of bridge" at a horrible young age (like 16) and wow...carried it forward, Weinstein is famous too, great players will make for a great ...|pg||

mb|d|nt|gambit: 4c?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some have asked whether there is an advantage to being USA1 instead of USA2 at Sao Paulo.  It's purely bragging rights, no advantage in the competition itself.|pg||
mb|r|nt|gambit: Pepsi is starting off aggresively |pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: bd 47 is thrown out|pg||

mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: hello Tarek|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|tsadek: 1NT either 15-17 or any , N Dbl with any good hand|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Gerben42: okay - you cannot just always pass vs NT with a good hand, but here you just get caught...|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Gerben42: although it doesnt feel good to start a match with -800, I guess the other room might overcall 2@S for @S+m with a similar result|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|jcwla: Jacobs' intervention seems totally normal.  It's taken the parlay of Hamman holding a real NT, a bad catch, and Zia's having the hand to double to put him in this position.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i hear the other room is playing 2NT from W|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yes, North stayed out there.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Nickell took 9 tricks in 2@H to win 1 IMP on Board 1, this will cost Jacobs more than that.|pg||

nt|gambit: back to back slams? |pg||
nt|gosia: Valiant effort - but Jacobs was very tough today|pg||
nt|gambit: Jacobs is tough every day |pg||
nt|gosia: true|pg||
nt|sybarra: they actually have this bd and another we will see,  then 2 we will not see |pg||
nt|gosia: especialy I commented last quarter and George and Ralph played great|pg||
nt|tylere: cohler got 6 back on 57|pg||
nt|sybarra: substitured bds will not be shown but reported |pg||
nt|tylere: maybe on 58 they can slow roll it and get doubled in 6@S?|pg||
nt|gosia: maybe|pg||
nt|pelu: not the best play|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|tsadek: to bid 2@C with KQJ10xxx means your 3@C is ART|pg||
nt|tsadek: could be @C+@H 5-5|pg||

nt|jcwla: 3@C seems normal if avail|pg||
mb|p|nt|gosia: pretty soft North hand , but he has a pinochle :)|pg||
