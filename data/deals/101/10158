nt|ralfwil: an optimistic 4@h in OR|pg||
nt|asig: Lots of action in the closed room on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if i had to use the 3@D jump i think i would try 3nt also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: saving 3@D for at most 1 loser suits|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this could be fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward hand|pg||
nt|haans: you can find full text somewere at internet (i found it long ago)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ralfwil: 4@d I mean|pg||
nt|asig: Open, sorry|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kastan88: why? I have played here in Estonia long time in 80's early 90's Estonian strong pass system called "Otstavel" by co-author (or Tartu Stick). Was amazing time|pg||
nt|haans: trash bid|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@s= unbal 8-11|pg||
nt|m_niemi: can they find @h fit?|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has a valuation problem now|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@d = natural|pg||
nt|m_niemi: their 1@c-def: X = Ms, 1NT = ms|pg||
nt|roswolf: south might not be able to show his shape|pg||
nt|pelu: suit - but no HCP?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|cenglund:  The play Weak NT, I suppose|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@d= 0-7 or any GF|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: always bid over a strong club at this vul if you have any kind of long suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|talion: 1NT is 12-14 in first & second position and 15-17 in third & fourth position|pg||
nt|mcphee: anyone else not want to forgive him :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: its unforgettable|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry i confused unforgiveible with unforgettable|pg||
nt|mcphee: not so terrible a @D slam this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: but im english argggghhh|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes at this vul east chose 2s in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i fancy north didnt like to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|jakow: @D FG or weak|pg||
nt|jakow: 15-17nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: which may have supercharged the auction|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 11-rule:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the weak part of these systems is inspired/semi-lunatic intervention|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cenglund:  Ducking is safe|pg||
nt|m_niemi: nice surprise in @c|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: here is a good test for any system lots of tricks but 2 fast losers - lets see what happens|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt 15-17 now bidding start|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is extremely light for a penalty double|pg||
nt|cenglund:  A diamond preference would help partner|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: most english can neither speak or write their native language|pg||
nt|asig: This should make|pg||
nt|haans: @DK second so very easy make|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: terrible...as in it doesnt make |pg||
nt|mcphee: not in favor of this 2N rebid at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: there speaks a retired headmaster|pg||
nt|kastan88: nice cold (or gold) humour, as usual, Mike :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well facing 8-11 he probably thought that this was a fair shot|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @s4= @d-signal|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what discards are they using, lavinthal?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Roman|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: most headmaster can either by the way|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cenglund:  Now it's only about fighting for overtricks|pg||
nt|talion: now ahonen has double stopper in hearts. if danielsdot had lead high heart, then ahonen could have taken only one heart trick|pg||
nt|talion: but with no side entry, low heart lead seems reasonable|pg||
nt|asig: One loser in each suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence may put pressure when aqce and another club is played if north ducks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Perhaps E has a guess in @c|pg||
nt|m_niemi: odd= pos, even= lavinthal|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: roland very dissapoined about no slam here|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably right play by defence|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2NT-1 or -2 is cheap against 4@h|pg||
nt|haans: the text 'now bidding start' is standard for the system |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: its not mps!|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer wont make many tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: no real exploration of the hands possibilites - just a close your eyes jump to 3nt|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jakow: Ask EBL!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: this will go off but it will be a few 50's only|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in the other room N opens 17+ 1@d|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: but teammates wont be|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcphee: well if no @S lead it will make|pg||
nt|cenglund:  good defence so far|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|m_niemi: squeeeeez...|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps south should have cashed his club tricks first|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Declarer should pitch clubs|pg||
nt|m_niemi: -3 i guess|pg||
nt|m_niemi: diamonds + @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes likelu|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cenglund:  8 tricks I guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is one reason why roland would want to be in it|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h9|nt|mcphee: 2-2 @D or 3-1 split onside it is also a make|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|sT|mc|9|nt|ralfwil: a small without hesitation...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well requires cool courage|pg||
nt|asig: maybe Christiansen should have tested spades first|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Not muck to loose compared with the win|pg||
nt|asig: then he would know that N had the @cK for his opening bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: much....|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is that east must ensure that there are enough spades to take care of the clubs should any mishaps aoccur |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Or @sK!|pg||
nt|asig: He would know, had he played spades first|pg||
nt|m_niemi: easy to defend now|pg||
nt|cenglund:  They might play 2NT D in the open room if N opens weak two |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i doubt it would be doubled|pg||

nt|kastan88: byt that's onlu mine opinion :)|pg||
nt|jakow: Anyway, I think Magic diamond better than Carotti...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the mistake from S on board no 36 was expensive|pg||
nt|haans: bjarnason has an openin or ???|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if opponents preempt after 1@c-1@d NS may be in trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: absolutely|pg||
mb|1N|nt|haans: 1nt 15-17 start with stayman transfers etc etc|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|cenglund:  Flannery, I presume|pg||
nt|m_niemi: par is 4NT by N|pg||
mb|4H|nt|talion: 2@d is both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a part score here not too high for either side|pg||
nt|mcphee: and this is the reason why I prefer to open 1@D as E|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s already probably too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h by n/s isnt guaranteed either|pg||
nt|asig: No|pg||
nt|asig: 5 apparent losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: accurate defence  a spade a heart  2 clubs and a dim to lose|pg||
nt|haans: invite spade support|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 35 the danish west didnt find the spade lead and therefore declarer had no problem|pg||
nt|haans: 1D 17+++++++++|pg||
nt|haans: 1H neg|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: what does 1@H show?|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S bid|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3@dX made in deal 1, 11 to Sweden|pg||
nt|haans: 1H show 0-7|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2nt must be a lebensohl bid |pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be a trappy hand for n/s|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: I am a 1 @D openeron the E hand|pg||
nt|haans: for weak to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 30 imps in 3 boards so far|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S may be 3 cards|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcphee: the wonderful news for declarer is partner actually holds 4 trumps!|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would not sell out to 2c at this vulnerability as north i would bid 2h i have a couple of trciks and i can tolrate 2s if partner wants im not getting doubled|pg||
nt|asig: Maybe E led a diamond|pg||
pc|sT|nt|haans: three spades|pg||
nt|haans: lucky he has more|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|talion: about 5-13 points if i remember correctly|pg||
nt|kastan88: mostly all systems are good, if player just thinks sometimes (not bids as robot) and has agreements with partner|pg||
nt|xenya: this might go down|pg||
mc|9|nt|xenya: 3N can be beaten on LOW @C lead -- impossible to find|pg||
nt|kastan88: on CC I think this is called Ekren, but 3rd hand and vuln must be little bit stronger, than usual 3...10 points|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is another example of inadequate fighting ofr the part score|pg||
nt|mcphee: sensible idea to me also Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i can see how this made|pg||
nt|asig: Win the ace, to rounds of trumps an another diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: west ruffs with his mony and then fourth dim takes care of club an d a club is ruffed in dummy! what an extraordinary position|pg||
nt|asig: *two|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this is a perfectly normal defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets it thru|pg||
nt|asig: Einarsson should work this out on the bidding|pg||

nt|mcphee: defenders lost a trick I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: bridge is believe me anaggressive game- i relearned it after thirty years from a ounger relative who retaught me the basics|pg||
nt|mcphee: E gets all the gooddies|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 300 is not that bad score for NS|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed |pg||
nt|roswolf: a hand of possibility|pg||
nt|haans: four @H may have longer minor transfer resonses|pg||
nt|haans: respones|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: responses|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jakow: In original Magic D we opened 2S on this hand  55 S+C or D+H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cant 1@H show 45?|pg||
nt|roswolf: another big @H fit for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: will e/w allow n/s play in 4@S?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in big club system S is so limited, that preempts should be quite sound = > W pass|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@h= 8-11|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C?????????????????????????|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|lestergold: in bridge you musttighten the screw up to the maximum but not brwak the bolt by overdoing it|pg||
nt|lestergold: a close 3n with nothing to spare made in the open|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N pass!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: nothing to stop them now|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mcphee: good @C slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: so iceland really needs to flatten this board|pg||
nt|roswolf: bergen strikes|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: creeping about cautiously will win nothing|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no trumps, no @h-ruff|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jakow: About 12-14hcp and 3+H|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: in 3. seat vuln: 1Nt = 15-17, so N had to open 1@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: with spades and dims both breaking 3/3 this should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: easy 7 tricks - and a flat board|pg||
nt|xenya: we've got our first comparison -- let's hope it will continue|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie but imagine you were in club slam and recieved a heart lead - you would not be a very happer sapper|pg||
nt|mcphee: too bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: your only entry to dummy under attack immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets face it i think even roland would baulk at this slam|pg||
nt|mcphee: life can be mean, i have this E hand and partner opens slam is going to be hard to avoid:)|pg||
nt|asig: Yes, even if W finds an unlikely heart lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the lead helps|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: easy to duck and then only one club  trick for the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: what a horrible choice for east now|pg||
nt|haans: had been much harder to bid if sylvan first passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: i was once told by an international team captain in the southern hemisphere that he picked 1 pair playing an HUM system in all matches against what he thought were the weakest ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: teams and sat them out otherwise - the strategy worked the team won a medal|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|xenya: nicely done by NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: now spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: ionically a heart lead may have been threatening|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4N simply does not do the hand any justice|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: 29 combined points without a grat trump fit why have you got to be in slam?|pg||
nt|sybarra: because it makes? |pg||
nt|sybarra: (just a joke)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|pelu: that from board 22 - board 17-18-19 = 8-0 for Sweden|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mcphee: I have 8 tricks in my hand an partner opens I certainly do more than a tiny invite|pg||
nt|sybarra: 8 tricks if clubs are behaving |pg||
nt|mcphee: missing slam at imps is cowardly here|pg||
nt|lestergold: on a passive lead you have 6c tricks heart finesse for 2 tricks 3 sapdes and then a dim guess fo the contract when spades dont break that is if you havent mangled up your ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications|pg||
nt|lestergold: i strongly disagree|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ht switch now surely|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|m_niemi: nice def|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kastan88: neede to jump in with @HK and lead @D thru|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cenglund:  Declarer should try to score dummy's spades by ruffing|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok would anyone pass throughout with the north hand - losing tactics to me|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|lestergold: did Einarsson have time to mess around with that club|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The defence drew the longest straw|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mcphee: all true what you say, W has a complete minimum as well|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: it is a hand full of holes and hazards|pg||
nt|haans: nothing to it :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcphee: and it still has good play|pg||
nt|sybarra: so if you are so interested in slam, perhaps 4 @c is better bid over 3 nt|pg||
pc|h4|nt|m_niemi: !!|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@C is clear|pg||
nt|lestergold: now i think declarer is in tyrouble|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|asig: He takes the rest on a double squeeze|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mcphee: emphasize your @C, they are worth it|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: 4n after wheeling out the fourth suit does full justice to the hand that is a very strong slam try|pg||
pc|d3|pg||

nt|haans: yes may not be HUM just natural but unusual|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: not easy for defence , as we saw|pg||
nt|xenya: a @D lead would have set 4@H, but how could W find it?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the "conservative" e/w pair here are winning imps nevertheless |pg||
nt|lestergold: i probabbly wouldnt wheelout the fourth suit just make a straight quantitative invite|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The Danes were in 5@S here after N-S competed to 5@C|pg||

nt|m_niemi: no 3@c by N?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: 5@S had the obvious two losers|pg||
nt|roswolf: south may be tempted to bid|pg||
nt|haans: i think :)))|pg||
nt|m_niemi: aggressive bid by Nyberg|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@H OR EVEN 4|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C better bid i think|pg||

nt|m_niemi: I pass|pg||

nt|mcphee: 6-12 NT|pg||
nt|haans: usually no spades|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Koistinen is very passive today|pg||
nt|roswolf: green cards are the norm in northern finland it seems|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be a thin 4@S getting through|pg||
nt|roswolf: going for the max|pg||

nt|roswolf: now n/s need some judgment|pg||

nt|haans: 2 spades 2 diamonds = 4|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: we all know about the amount of luck there is in this game|pg||
nt|lestergold: in chess the best players always win in bridge chaque chien a son jour|pg||

nt|haans: not @D lead |pg||
mb|1N|nt|xenya: yes, Jaak, that's even more difficult|pg||

nt|lestergold: at the time |pg||
nt|m_niemi: N hopes that S has 5-5 or better|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: this is a funny deal for denmark :))))|pg||
nt|haans: a natural penalty double!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  On good day you make slam, but this not that day|pg||
nt|mcphee: this response range places a lot of pressure, 2N as N kinda forced in case S has more and works poorly when S has a 6 count|pg||
nt|m_niemi: E has good shape, and no wasting values|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: complain when he misses something, not before|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1NT = non forcing|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: at the time declarer was more worried about his ninth trick than his tenth!|pg||
nt|asig: Sure|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Dead after a @s lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: yes sadly bcause Iceland needed a swing hwere|pg||

nt|haans: bloddy bidding|pg||

nt|roswolf: wise words martin|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N's bids been strange to me, played well|pg||
nt|roswolf: the results achieved are the proof of the pudding|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Nice lead, but not good enough to beat the contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the finns have what they deserve|pg||
nt|m_niemi: even then that is too much|pg||
nt|haans: criminal?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N should have at least 4 cards in on minor|pg||

nt|cenglund:  Yes, declarer may try to drop the stiff queen after the ruff|pg||
nt|haans: gustawsson have done nothing wrong yes|pg||

nt|lestergold: i cannot believe that north can invite game with a balanced 14 count no 5 card suit opposite a no trump response that could be as few as 6 so that it accepts with 9 or ten- not in ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: my book|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E cashing the A of clubs, so no mistake |pg||
nt|lestergold: he sweat a little himself|pg||

nt|haans: I lost a trick sorry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jakow: 3Sp? Anyone?|pg||
nt|kastan88: How destructive is 3@S here by agreements?|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam zone hand|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club|pg||
mb|1S|nt|m_niemi: not a very good slam :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C now would have excited north|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cenglund:  Worth 1 IMP|pg||
nt|kastan88: how many tricks have N 5, 6, 7? what to do with S hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: medal for that for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: as we see ace setting tricks not always cashed today|pg||
nt|mcphee: 6-12 what option do they have but to raise?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: the teoretically correct way to play that suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: or biddable, but makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: they have an option to play a sensible bidding system|pg||
nt|mcphee: S more likely the player that erred going to game NV with flat 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe but the system and the way it was handled contradict basic principles of the game im not going to mince words here|pg||
nt|mcphee: W is about to be delighted to find the opps want to play in his 5 bagger:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: from the frying pan into the fire now|pg||
nt|kastan88: yes, was amazing, puts always pressure to partner with 14..15 points,  does she have 6..8points then pass, if 11.12 points then game,  And all times you making decission ... and ...|pg||
nt|kastan88: wrong result :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: likely same contract here as in CR|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like 2nt on S. I want a better @s stopper and I have a 4-card suit in @h|pg||
nt|lestergold: a nice misfit here i wonder how n/s made nine tricks in the open room|pg||
nt|m_niemi: NS:n 1@c def : X = Ms, 1NT=ms|pg||
nt|roswolf: will west get agressive?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: well this is a strange gesheft|pg||
nt|lestergold: are they playing the hands open|pg||
nt|mcphee: this will not be fun|pg||
nt|lestergold: not in a million years would i chance a pass with south especilly oo[posite the minimum non vulnerable garbage they play|pg||
nt|lestergold: i can see three easy tricks for declarer a club and two aces|pg||
nt|lestergold: its the other 4 im searching for|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: scarey|pg||
nt|roswolf: this wont survive|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S is bold|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 18% says kib|pg||
nt|haans: sundelin nt = invite with spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jakow: Rather strickt by Conv card!|pg||
nt|asig: Both South players enter the auction with 2NT dispite holding the singleton @dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: difficult bid for south no one likes a takeout double with a singleton iin one of the suits|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mcphee: well has more than 3|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3-3 36 % + 50% @h finess|pg||
nt|roswolf: just my type of odds!:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: sensible contract|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: yep|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: north so likely to respond in that singleton too|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u qxx in spades not a very robust stopper|pg||
nt|lestergold: all possible bids bu asouth have huge downsides|pg||
nt|roswolf: very scarey this|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 10 tricks I guess|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: well not quite...|pg||
nt|pelu: almost .)|pg||
nt|kastan88: I don't open this N hand 3@S, on 1st 2nd pos never|pg||
nt|kastan88: I like here more classical, to have my 6 playing tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: this can be made if he plays for 3-3 @Ds rather than a finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well more than 3 anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: anything else has to be wrong|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|mcphee: @H now from W is best as we see, but not so clear cut|pg||
nt|m_niemi: has to top @c|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|roswolf: agree martin|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: well declarer will emerge with another trick in the wash somehow or other but this will be a fair bloodbath aginst as shirley would put it.... ZIP!|pg||

nt|sybarra: ok guys leaving on your own with the ladies match,   have to leave |pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: well another fat swing to the Danes|pg||
nt|haans: one advantage of seeing nordic team is that often you also have their system cards |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|xenya: should be 2 down -- R won't play the K now|pg||
nt|xenya: E rather|pg||
nt|talion: i wonder how other table reached 4@h with 5-1 fit?|pg||
nt|mcphee: cya Shirl|pg||

nt|roswolf: very good result|pg||
nt|pelu: hi - sorry - I am back now - I see the danes need my help :)|pg||

mb|1N|nt|cenglund:  So the board was turned 90 degrees?|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Excellent result|pg||
nt|cenglund:  But the play was sloppy|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 12 more to fin, from 1ntX-4 board|pg||
mb|2C|nt|haans: 2@S or 3@H????????|pg||
mb|2D|nt|cenglund:  They must strike it out|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: from "wrong" hand - 6NT making|pg||
mb|2H|nt|xenya: he did, at some point|pg||
nt|jakow: Avery tricky 3NT to bid!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in 37 Finns made 4@h in open room, +11|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: well perhaps she was right to go up: it was the setting trick |pg||
nt|m_niemi: in 5 level many play that A denies K|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so declarer missguessed the @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H seems damp too surely a clear pass assuming double was penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  This board is no good for a strong club opening|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably would fail in practice buut not a bad contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: here lebensohl is often used|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n the safe and obvious spot|pg||
nt|mcphee: hard now for the N hand|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2NT = good @s-raise?|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: another straightforward and therefore relatively boring hand|pg||
nt|haans: i do not know what 3@S show|pg||
nt|roswolf: will they get to slam?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: running scores:http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/res/results/o/bm10.html|pg||
nt|m_niemi: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/res/results/o/bm10.html|pg||
nt|haans: i have done the same|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: can EW find 6NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: I just bid 3N as N rather than dble|pg||
nt|lestergold: understandably north has made tyhesafest sensible bid|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, very awkward bidding problem for N |pg||
nt|haans: suprise passing???????|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@d = 0-7, 1@h = @h or bal?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|cenglund:  Slam depends on the club finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: hand is too good to bid only 2n partner would pass with two many hads where 3n was laydown|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happesn this isnt one of them |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mcphee: best is to now cash @D A and see what takes place|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: they know about controls - have they the tricks?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in other room sequence will be 1@s-3@s-?|pg||
nt|haans: N have 1 spade and @CA|pg||
mb|5D|nt|asig: No problems here making 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: when east sees dummy hell be regretting the lead but sighing with relief when he find sthat declarer has a stiff club|pg||
nt|lestergold: this should make on the dim position|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kastan88: but what else here to open, if 1@C means  all hands 15+? you can't open other way|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  Slam is slightly over 50%, since Q singelton off-side makes as well|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@h = 20+, 2NT = raise with single, 3@c = ask, 3@d = single @c|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2NT = 4441, with black single|pg||
nt|haans: fair|pg||
pc|hK|nt|m_niemi: this is easy|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pelu: from the West-hand 6NT sh be as good as 6@Cs (also in CR)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have thought east hand worth an upgrade to 1@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: well done Rimstedt and Sjöberg. Deserved swing|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, brilliantly bid|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: this not of coutrse a bad line if the trumps were breaking normally that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: would virtually guarantee the contract but declarer in for a nasty shock|pg||

pc|d6|nt|haans: that tghe advantage with transfer|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@s better I think|pg||

pc|d2|nt|lestergold: what do you suggest Bob?|pg||
nt|mcphee: i pass personally|pg||
nt|kastan88: and i am not lover to say 2NT on 2nd round, I would bid just 2@S, I am rabbit here|pg||
nt|lestergold: Sorry Bob you and I are not on the same planet|pg||
nt|mcphee: stiff K does nothing for me|pg||
nt|mcphee: I will be able to bid later|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont like ity but the day i pass 12 points with 5 spades is when hell freezes over|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cenglund:  The gadget lets the contract to be played from the right side|pg||
nt|fabsayc: out of control auction|pg||
nt|jakow: Somethin strange with th double of 1H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs partner to cover 3 losers, surely then north would bid more than 5@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: instead its the greaqt danes in a little trouble 3n easier|pg||
nt|lestergold: however weight of cards is a factor here |pg||
nt|asig: I think this should make, though|pg||
nt|asig: Not many losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: dims favourable so u lose 2 or 3 tump tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: still makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: just not the most elegant looking contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: !!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: there should be 2 tricks more in @h to than NT, that's not likely => 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: chicken|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: fortunately for NS, it's just another -50 against a makeable 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: and here another 5 card suit too|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kastan88: yes, from S hand down with @S lead|pg||

pc|c8|nt|kastan88: if double showed 5...7 points, i can't see reason to bid 6@C over partner sign off, or what was double?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kastan88: then I am some Antarctic person too, I open this hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: by the way i forgot to comment that north should have given simple pref to 2s|pg||

nt|kastan88: but as I said i would personally bidding 2@S after partners 2@D and waiting, may be she can do someting with her 15-pointer|pg||

nt|m_niemi: no M|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so like 2@d opening|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is the kind of hand where the 1@C can potentially cause problems|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w ge the straightforward hand now|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 1NT= 13-15(16)|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|haans: do you know that you can se all hands you have seen in BBO? go to c:\Bridge Base Online\hands\yr bbo name|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: S had a hard choice|pg||
nt|mcphee: normally 1NT response indicates a better hand than this poor 6 count|pg||
nt|lestergold: well im in favour of aggressive take out doubles but with north's minimum bad spade suit an stiff diamond, i would not make this bid here very dangerous vul aginsty not|pg||
nt|mcphee: I would not dble as N either|pg||
nt|kastan88: in this part of Earth (East europa) we play that mostly 6..10, so I can't see reason to raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: let pard balance if east passes also much too much in heasrts|pg||
nt|lestergold: zip outside hearts|pg||
nt|mcphee: 8-11, 7-10 range is more in tune here in NA|pg||

nt|lestergold: so do i please ignore my comments i took my eye off te ball dues to  PLATE OF SAUSAGES EGGS AND CHIPS APPEARING|pg||
nt|mcphee: no kippers?|pg||

nt|mcphee: delivery, back when done|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S asked singel?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: this must be a kind of asking bid - west thought so !|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no need to use Blackwood|pg||
nt|haans: some change there|pg||

nt|ralfwil: @d A and @dK and crossruff|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: profitable save if he can get out for -3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|roswolf: this is a silly contract and clearly the system has a serious flaw|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: with the clubs both offside and the spade losers needing to be ruffed not laydown|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably get diamond right|pg||
nt|roswolf: trick 1 was interesting though|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N was too aggressive in this board|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I think it's just bad judgement|pg||
nt|m_niemi: against 8-11 that is not so great hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: S can get a @H ruff, but it's still 11 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: the lead gives a @H-ruff - but cost a @C-trick|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: j of spades on tabel rather than another dim|pg||
pc|s7|nt|m_niemi: claim|pg||

nt|fabsayc: no promotion|pg||
nt|fabsayc: clashes with natural diamond trick|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  the @CK cost an extra undertrick|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I think Fins will not win the previous board|pg||
nt|fabsayc: mind you, 3nt was not cold|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be more competitive|pg||
nt|m_niemi: nice bidding by EW|pg||
mb|2D|nt|haans: 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I agree, but they may reach 3NT in the other table, probably -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: oh well another tortured sequence likely|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@c denies M|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so 6@c or 5@c+4@d|pg||
nt|haans: five clubs no majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: but promises in hcp? 8-11?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: but only if N hold-up with @DK x!|pg||

nt|haans: Results: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/results.php  for this match soon|pg||
nt|m_niemi: not -3 still|pg||
nt|roswolf: lebensohl 2nt now?|pg||
nt|pelu: the @D-fit makes 4@H - on small values - a good contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S now might prevent that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|m_niemi: so tie is the best Fin can score|pg||
nt|pelu: but again - I dont like 1NT with a solid major 5 card suit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: East has good hand, double 3@s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass seems automatic|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have matti|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if w has 6 c m, there should be good spot for EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am not sure south has any legitmate other choice here - 4@S WONT MAKE OPPOSITE A PASSED PARD|pg||
nt|m_niemi: on @d lead 4@s makes|pg||
nt|pelu: but is the pause by S who or West |pg||
nt|pelu: for sure W will lead his singleton @C|pg||
nt|m_niemi: move @dK to @sK, how many tricks in @s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i assume screens are in use - in which case west may be considering bidding over 3@S|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@h=ms|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|xenya: S plays a @H, if W discards a@D, S cashes @DK and plays another @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: wel 6d looks v good|pg||
nt|pelu: both!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah both thinking!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: minors|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: 3@C must have been transfer 4@C natural|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@s = ASK|pg||
nt|m_niemi: tx Sue|pg||
nt|haans: were they on the winning team last nordics?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: wow aggressive!! both of them|pg||
nt|lestergold: and lucky no double|pg||
nt|mcphee: not a hopeless spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: a horrible contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: may even make it|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course every finesse in sight works|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: will require a defence worthy of that aginst the israelie raid on entebbe|pg||
nt|lestergold: and yes it may happen|pg||
nt|pelu: ok -100 against 140 :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D is just too undisciplined for me pard did bid 1nt and so has defence|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: 2@S is a super accept but W is not interested|pg||
nt|lestergold: but plenty of play even on a less favouravle layout|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As the cards lie  - yes, but 2 of 3 finesses is needed|pg||
nt|lestergold: its better than that Raif|pg||
nt|lestergold: because played bu south with the spade protected the fourth heart will take care of possibloe spade loser so whenever club finesse is right its a very good contract and has chances ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: when clubs finess is wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a roland mandatory and porbably in the region of upwards of 50% in any case|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@c = 16+, 1@d = 0-7|pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: clubs ruff beat it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|m_niemi: 3@h= 3cards|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|xenya: her 2N was just a further transfer|pg||
nt|pelu: S need to take the @C-trick in on @HA|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: plus all the possible helpful leads too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But @d in on N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4 is makeable, though maybe double dummy|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: the standing it 30-0 + board 20 where Denmark can loose many IMPs|pg||
nt|roswolf: always seems to me that their last bid is a punt|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cenglund:  3NT would have been cold, but this is more difficult, but should make on good play|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like a very resonable spot to this bozo|pg||
nt|haans: suprise|pg||
nt|kaapo: Score updates from the women's at http://www.bridgefinland.com/NM2009/res/bmsc.php|pg||

nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @h7 = suit pref to @s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: could well be|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will do the right thing i am sure|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N should have led a high @s|pg||
nt|m_niemi: from that bad suit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S has a real problem|pg||
nt|roswolf: he certainly hasnt been helped by his pard|pg||
nt|pelu: N coudn't help here - only tell that he has 3-card @H|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I don't think that S needs N's count in @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be a suit preference situation|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in 43 Finns in 3Nt in the other room as I predicted|pg||
nt|pelu: so another 6 IMPs for Finland|pg||
nt|m_niemi: not made yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: the more he thinks the more likely he is to get it wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: "all" way lead to 9 trivcks :(|pg||
nt|pelu: @CK - come on Gregers :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 9 tricks => :) not :(|pg||

nt|pelu: I try again : @CK - @CK - :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d7|nt|ralfwil: on a @c lead the slam is cold|pg||

nt|cenglund:  Draw trumps and continue diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: now Bob stop compimenting urself|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|m_niemi: wish to hear how he decided to play @c|pg||
nt|m_niemi: claim|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: the count in @H = declayers ditribution - West is favorit to 7 card @D = 2-3-7-1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: cards are lying very badly for decalrer -- likely -2|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do against weak defender|pg||
nt|mcphee: vul I think it is imperative you reach game|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: but its absoutely a dreadful contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: well 4-1 trumps makes it hard|pg||
nt|lestergold: favourable spade position dims 3/3 fav lead etc|pg||
nt|lestergold: and still work to do|pg||
nt|mcphee: even with a @C lead this is not so horrid, 3-3 @D comes in as well|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Oops!|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a poor 4/4 trump fit misfitting side suit combs and a shotage f high card points- its a part score hand|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|cenglund:  It's still one down|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcphee: there are mutiple opportunities to make|pg||

pc|c5|nt|pelu: tjat disc could cost a trick now a loser might go on the 4.@S - but NS can recover|pg||

nt|m_niemi: the point is where is decl's top honour|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: board 8: +3 to Swe, they played 4@d -4!, this table 5@cX-2|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|mcphee: I think this has a lot to do with the neg dble showing 4@H for them|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Looks like the Icelanders are getting a hiding|pg||

nt|roswolf: which is what he has!|pg||

nt|roswolf: REALLY NON -FORCING - MAMA MIA|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pelu: ok last board :) - I hope that the connections will be better in next round|pg||
nt|cenglund:  They missed a cold game in hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@D is max for EW|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Finns scored 6 imp from 3NT mentioned earlier|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3NT by S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|mcphee: although 3@H is aggressive, if the S hands values are outside of @S it is not so bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but sometimes opps preempt you or if south expectsb pard to show 4 hts however minimum she is then she did not have here 4h raise you cant have it both ways|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcphee: and to reach a close game vul at imps is good|pg||
nt|lestergold: desperation pushin i suppose|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might consider axing this|pg||
nt|pelu: no not in IMP - prob down 1 = 100/530|pg||
nt|m_niemi: will EW score their 3 @s tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mcphee: S should not pass 2@S out in any case, and will dble again and now N should be considering 4@H anyway|pg||

pc|dA|nt|roswolf: amazing that south isnt contemplating a grand with all those controls|pg||
pc|d5|nt|m_niemi: 2@s would have been very minimum raise|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@h showed some values|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Another good board for the Finns|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: S has to play a @D back now -- breaking communications -- difficult|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|m_niemi: Kx,Axxxxx,Kx,Axx vs. nf bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: if you cant bid 6@D here then you really should change your methods|pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: decl will have to fight for it|pg||
nt|m_niemi: E should have bid once more with 4th trump|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: even with the wasted Ks as a value this 4h is a much better contract thatn the last one for n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: has his sisth tricvk only needs to find a 7th may even find an eight|pg||
nt|pelu: I was too slow - as always :)|pg||

pc|c3|nt|m_niemi: 10 tricks possible|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: but why save if you think it might be going off|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kastan88: this 1@C= 16+ unbal or 15+= bal, thats why stopped in 2NT only|pg||
nt|xenya: 1N would be more comfortable here|pg||
nt|kastan88: their 1NT=12...14|pg||
nt|kastan88: and of course good afternoon Martin :)|pg||
nt|xenya: seems he needs to take the right view in @Cs to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well he will have to find the club jack just to make|pg||

mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back. Let's keep our fingers crossed. The operators have a very poor connection|pg||
nt|lestergold: you rarely find that people fins saves of 1100 against 143o vul slams|pg||
nt|mcphee: no brainer to save at these colors|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I had tried a X as S|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Iceland scored +3 board 26, 1NTX-1, this table 2@h=|pg||

nt|fabsayc: koistinen timid?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N aqqressive at the last moment|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|pelu: Long way up to Finland :)|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 2@H - I cant :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandra Rimstedt and Emma Sjöberg are still juniors I believe. Early 20's? Someone in the audience may be able to message me|pg||
nt|haans: I its time for me to thank Matti Niemi and Goeffrey Wolfarth Ybarra my  co-commentator and you all for watching. Welcome back an other day. Hope you have enjoyed the show.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Sandra 22, Emma 24|pg||
nt|ralfwil: last board and rather few IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: again - can u defeat 2@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Anni and she is having a hard time. Please bear with her|pg||
nt|xenya: i think you can -- cash 4 @Hs, @SA and exit with a small @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's very frustrating when the connection is poor. You can press all the keys you like and things won't happen until after 30-60 seconds|pg||
nt|pelu: best chance is a small @D - that will block the entry to dymmy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are stuck again I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|pelu: Vladimir - I take @D 10 discard 2@Cs ruff a @S and N is squeezed|pg||
nt|xenya: yes that's true -- you need to play a small @D early|pg||
nt|pelu: are we still waiting for the lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty hans|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: makes a lot more sense over artificial 1@C than natural 1@S to preempt|pg||
nt|cenglund:  After all that fruitful chickening Koistinen had to break the line|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2+2+3+2=9, any problems?|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Not really, but declarer doesn't know the location of the K|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Furthermore, diamonds may be 4-1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 36 imps = 23-7|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The Finns have played very well in both tables|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if 16 boards...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 15 boards/match now|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 10 more to Fin, Salomaa run 4 rounds of @h to make 4@s with 6-1 fit|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The only snag on Finnish scoreboard is 3NT -1 on this board|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in the other room was @s lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: has declarer gone to sleep here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed 3nt was makeable even after spade lead|pg||
nt|m_niemi: declarer ducked 2nd @d, so spades were cleared, -1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: dec played S to have @dQJxx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same potential problem here|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I wonder how they managed to go down in the open room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still he cant make till he plays to trick 1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade, spade, diamond, diamond to jack, and spade|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: in mps there is a lot more to gain at imps you may save a few but what a disaster if you make a big sac and they cant make|pg||
nt|lestergold: a phantom at this level |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: NS will bid game here -- 3N or 4@H?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cenglund:  Not a very good decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: 17 imps is 19-11 to Finland|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: another battle of communications and not helping declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: well 4@H looks hopeless, but this has a practical chance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually i cant see a defense|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be a push|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm will north find the killing lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: restart scheduled in 58 mins time|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: so no second club trick and no way to make|pg||
nt|m_niemi: board 46 probably 6 imps to Den.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: but there it seems overtaking for spade lead is best for defense|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3@d the contract in open room|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: unlucky 3n|pg||
nt|lestergold: but flat|pg||
nt|kastan88: this is last brd, ty all and cu evening again|pg||
nt|mcphee: needed to play 4@S|pg||
nt|m_niemi: at least 10 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: but will it be enough for sweden|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed 12 or 13 to Sweden|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|m_niemi: @c had given a chance|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|lestergold: yes not easy bidding competition hand|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|m_niemi: even +1 with endplay|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 11 imps 17-13|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
mc|8|nt|fabsayc: now can actually make an overtrick|pg||
