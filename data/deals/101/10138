mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The great Meckwell in action|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For the first time in this event|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: The Nickell team had a bye to the semi-finals|pg||
nt|sga1: Possibly, but still he has no help in @cs.|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Bidding is wrong by 90 degrees, it seems|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome back to White Plains, New York, for the 2009 United States Bridge Championship. Semi-finals, 8 segments of 15 boards; this is the second|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|Walddk2: pass pass 1@S   Eric|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hit the UNDO button a few times|pg||
nt|sga1: Looks like many undos r reqd|pg||
nt|athene: Meckwell use transfers after 1@D (X), like many people nowadays|pg||
nt|finch: 1@S often used here to show a hand without a major (the 1@D opening may not have diamonds)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Competitive double (by Weichsel) shows the other two suits ( diamonds and club here ), plus tolerance for partner's suit - usually a doubleton.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to our Meckwell expert, Walter Johnson|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@D is the limit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi everyone|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S = balanced hand|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|athene: when you open nebulous minors (1@D in a strong club system or 1@C which might be 2+ cards) you need some general "no major" response|pg||
nt|barnets: hi|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Your commentators are Adam Kaplan, USA, Bill Frisby, England, and Sudhir Aggarwal, India. I am Roland Wald from Denmark|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: Bidding should stop at 3@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wish Weichsel good luck in 4@S...|pg||
nt|jbgood: but4 spades makes |pg||
nt|sga1: No :( they bid 4@s|pg||
nt|sga1: Wasn't 3@c help suit try?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C was an overbid, it seems. North has enough to accept such an invitation after his mere 2@S on the first round.|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: this is not a good spot|pg||
nt|barnets: has north shown any diamond suport?|pg||
nt|athene: it's a good idea to put the t/o doubler on lead, i think|pg||
nt|finch: No, but it's just Meckwell style to bid any sort of game|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mtvesuvius: Hi All :)|pg||
nt|sga1: Hi, back again|pg||
nt|sga1: Names are not correct here for EW|pg||
mc|8|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|sga1: Now OK|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: EW play a Canape type precision|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Freeman, as he put down dummy: "why should they go down when we can?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Jan Martel|pg||
nt|finch: I don't think the t/o doubler will have much difficulty deciding what to lead|pg||

nt|sga1: good luck|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S stopped in 3@S next door so 7 IMPs to Nickell|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator from now on is one of the very best in the game. Good morning to Jan Martel|pg||
nt|brolucius: East figured to have a singleton spade (possibly a doubleton) after his competitive double. It was great luck that this happened to be the @S10.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Scores from the USA2 matches are posted on the bracket sheet on the USBF website - go to www.usbf.org, click on USBCUSA2 under Event Results and then on Roundof32|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Meck: "sorry, partner ... you had the K of hearts? ... at least we had 3 losers in diamonds"|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sga1: Now EW are cold for 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have seen 2NT as both minors before, but not as both majors|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D is a bit risky but I expect he will bid it.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Could cost a huge amount.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Good morning - it's nice to take a day off to be behind the computer and I hope that I wasn't overly optimistic letting myself do it :)|pg||
nt|sga1: 2NT as both majors, surprising. Generally it is Ekrens 2@d or 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Rubin's 1@s can be Canape type|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Vugraphu1: 2@s is hearts and either minot|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: or minor :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: 500 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: This pair and Rubin-Granovetter will be playing this method.|pg||
nt|brolucius: No way that East will bid again, having pre-empted.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yeah, thanks Jan :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|sga1: -500 for NS here.|pg||
nt|jbgood: or just 200?|pg||
nt|sga1: if doubled ofcourse|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: NS can make 5 or 6@H|pg||
nt|athene: south will double again then Meckstroth has the common problem - bid your longer suit or your major?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@H was quite happy to hear 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem comes when next hand bids 4@S and partner bids on ahead of you :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: I don't know why we have late board scores, although I think I may, but we'll wipe them out with passouts and hope that the two tables play at about the same pace.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play a big club system, but no real details available|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|sga1: He took the loosing push. Who says 5 level belongs to opponents.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Ekeblad asked Meck whether the pass of 5@h was forcing and Meck says "no, we don't play very many forcing passes"|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|brolucius: A quick double-strike by Meckstroth and Rodwell in this set. The decision to go to 5@H will not be rewarded by the lie of the cards.|pg||
nt|jbgood: another big swing to Nickell playing 4@h at the other table|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Ekeblad asks about K: "either KQ or AK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sga1: Overbidding so far by Meckwell has been giving good results.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW hot off yet-another-cavendish-pair-win play 2/1|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mtvesuvius: 4@h is a nice spot though, and may make with an overtrick|pg||
nt|finch: 4@H isn't the greatest of contracts, but there is a surprisingly favourable heart layout (surprising given the auction)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Meck clarifies that 2@c showed either 6+ clubs or 5+ spades and 4 clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Clarifying leads and signals some more - before was NT, now suits|pg||
nt|finch: once Jan (the vu-graph operator) knows what the bid means, she'll put it in on the auction....|pg||
nt|athene: Meckstroth will hope the @HA is onside, given the opening bid|pg||
nt|finch: ...if you put your mouse over the alerted bid you can see the explanation|pg||
nt|athene: but it's not a sure thing|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: With the caveat that I can't do that after the opening lead has been made, unfortunately|pg||
nt|athene: Rubin has been having quite a bit of fun in third seat with his openings |pg||
nt|barnets: in the other room dec got a club lead from west and perhaps had an easier time|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: It goes agaisnt the general rules of pre-emptive auctions to pose the opponents a problem and then to bid one more yourselves after they have made their guess.|pg||
nt|gavin: seems like thats changing the score|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|athene: declarer is a bit worried about a bad heart break|pg||

pc|s9|nt|athene: all fine now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jbgood: strange that people who have seen the aggressiveness of Mecwell for so long still tends to rescue them and take a punishment themselves instead|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@H surprised me, I agree.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|finch: declarer is pretty confident that diamonds are 4-1, so he can't simply play a second trump at once|pg||

nt|athene: 1nt and a 3@D overcall? Nickell might want more, at these colours|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: he wont get 2 tricks with them this time|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jbgood: my informer tells me about 5 @d x four down next door|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing in 2@H does not figure to make a big dent in the 19-IMP deficit. Not that reaching 4@S was easy.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: rogoff decides to go low since their pair opens light|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: I asked Weichsel if he had an extra convention card for me, so I would know what the bids meant - he searched and searched and gave me a blank one - I said "with your bids on it" ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: or something like that and everyone at the table started laughing. But he did give me one so hopefully I'll do better with explanations from now on.|pg||
nt|brolucius: We are lucky indeed to have Jan as our operator. (Particularly as the current commentators have no clue as to the E-W methods...)|pg||
nt|athene: better play @SA on the lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Nickell: "15-17?" Granovetter: "yeah, 14+ sometimes"|pg||
nt|athene: if he plays low he'll be very worried, but south only gets one ruff, so no problem|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rubin asks about the lead - shortness - specifically asks about honor - ten - nine - no, that's in the middle of the hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: i do have a spy in the audience who also has their card..|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: if west gets to 3nt just relaying, without revealing anything about his hand, the defence are likely to attack hearts a lot|pg||
nt|gavin: wow im suprised he didnt bid more over 3D though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wonder what 1@H-2@S means|pg||
nt|gavin: he has an exceptional hand facing 55 in the red suits|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: The initial score in this match was 106 for Rogoff and 107 for Jacobs. I need to get him to change the scores in all those boards though|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: Nor do we wish to adopt them, on the current evidence... But of course they are both world-class players and everyone has bad boards now and again.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|gavin: likely to take 10 tricks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: both pairs in the other room are playing Big club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so that's 3 of 4 for this match|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: north hoping his partner has another trump, unlikely as that is after @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: if 3@S showed his exact shape, then he's already known not to like hearts much :)|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like declarer can set up a long club winner to pitch a losing spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter: "bee-u-tiful; you don't like @hs?" Rubin: "no"|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: G asks about spot card leads - 3rd and low|pg||

nt|ahollan1: after 1@H-1@S;3@D|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|finch: the heart lie makes 4@H doomed. He can set clubs up to get one spade loser away, but not both|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter started to say "hmmm" and is now humming |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|finch: but he's going more than one off, as he think the lead was from length to spade honours|pg||
nt|finch: the actual line to make required playing for a miracle - clubs 3-3 with the king onside and a singleton spade led|pg||
nt|athene: yes, @DK was the entry to the club winner|pg||
nt|athene: to make, you need @CKxx onside, singleton spade lead, @DA right, and 4-3 hearts?|pg||
pc|hJ|mc|10|nt|athene: as the cards lie he could have led @CJ and ducked the @CK?|pg||

nt|sga1: 3 Boards and -30 IMPs.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rubin: "you were 1-1" Freeman: "that was very disappointing"|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Nickell: "hopeful, right partner?" Freeman, "yes, if he had 3 diamonds and 2 clubs"|pg||
nt|athene: not only is it no use for partner to hold the trump ace, you also can't get TWO ruffs|pg||

mb|1D|nt|barnets: part score battle|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: True, but with a small change to the hand, it's the correct lead|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S suggests he is going to bid both suits?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This is not a hand where you want to declare|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Freeman wrote something about 2@s - I think NAT, INV, NF - Rubin asks about 2@d - weak 2|pg||
nt|athene: you might consider responding 2@H - just hoping partner can bid 2@S off a fragment|pg||
nt|athene: then you sort of have a chance of getting into either major, but you stay below 3@D|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w can make 3@d|pg||

mb|1H|nt|sga1: Yes But 3/5@d bid in the closed room were highly aggressive.|pg||

mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: This will only be 50s luckily|pg||
nt|athene: the Pen-Eating Monster gets everywhere|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: This score will now be all right until we start getting "comparisons" on the pass outs|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|brolucius: The first time I ever saw Weichsel was when he and Sontag faced Reese and Dixon at the Sunday Times Pairs, decades ago. It was during the flower power era and the US Pair was ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: dressed accordingly in red and purple velvet jackets.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: no pen is safe from him|pg||
nt|sga1: Real misfit hand. Best to stay as low as possible.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell asks Granovetter what DBL by him would have been - "also takeout"|pg||
nt|finch: Granovetter knew that 2@S would be almost certainly a 4-3 fit, while 3@D might have been the same a level higher|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: does anyone recognize that 3@S bid?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N E is a good spot here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: this isn't so bad with @CK and @HK well-positioned|pg||
nt|barnets: suit pref for clubs maybe|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no|pg||
nt|finch: declarer needs to play the right number of rounds of trumps before starting to run diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my best guess   choice of game with 5@H|pg||
nt|gavin: they play a very unique system from the rest of the world, guessing what exactly they show is very hard to do|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bigtrain: u/d suit preference|pg||
nt|ahollan1: win @C, @H to dummy, @H finesse?|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Some discussion about bidding 3@d over 2@s - Nickell says he had tricks in diamonds, but as against that, 2@s wasn't doubled|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: They put board 21 on the table instead of 20, so I couldn't put the bids in, but they noticed and have decided to play the boards in order, so now we have board 20 on the table|pg||
nt|gavin: and thats going to be the next topic in my blog, transfers over 2NT rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: ok, thanks Jan... Another interesting hand here|pg||
nt|athene: another 2@S contract on a misfit :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: EW may have trouble reaching 2@s if they use crawling stayman, as they did in the CR|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: That delay was caused because Granovetter had forgotten that the set started with 16 so had boards scored wrong on his convention card and had to fix it|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: don't panic -- not really pass out in other room, results will be entered eventually|pg||
nt|mariner1: Closed Room is in 4@H on 49|pg||

nt|gavin: a very practical 1NT overcall from levin, facing a passed hand this gives him his best chance of reaching game|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Nickell asks about 2@s and Granovetter says more or less what I wrote in the bidding diagram|pg||
nt|gavin: weinstein took it as a super accept and now is making some sort of game try|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: NS would like to draw trumps and cash diamonds but they can't really do that|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: E-W will be hoping that 30 down after 4 boards is just a bad dream and they will wake up in some hotel room in a few moments.|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell is writing, I'll try to get after the auction|pg||
nt|athene: in fact GIB boasts he can make 3@S|pg||

nt|barnets: the contract would no longer be secure|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in 4@S ?|pg||
nt|gavin: rogoffs hand isnt suitable for any preempt in my book|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|brolucius: 630 at the other table, so a 1-IMP nibble out of the big early lead. |pg||
nt|sga1: 3NT contract for EW now.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Some discussion about the spades on the last hand|pg||
nt|athene: it seems unfair that the 4-2 fit scores better than the 5-2 fit|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: hmm, -1, I guess he played for Nickell to have 3@H instead|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room, Zia's 2@H was weak with both majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter: "I recognize this hand; we played it" Nickell: "we failed to play it; we got this far"|pg||
nt|athene: he expected his partner to convert to 2@S holding 3-2 in majors|pg||
nt|athene: so the worst that could happen was playing 2@H on 4-3 instead of 2@S on 5-3|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@h is being played here in the CR|pg||
nt|athene: he forgot that people hold 2-2 in majors for 1NT sometimes tho :)|pg||
nt|finch: agree he might well have missed it - if he claimed 'running the diamonds' he would have been in the wrong hand if he hadn't cashed the heart first, so only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: michaels|pg||
nt|finch: sorry, that was private|pg||
nt|bigtrain: NF|pg||
nt|finch: While EW have 6@D available, NS have a 500 save in hearts|pg||
nt|gavin: lots would disagree|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 800 on perfect defence (finding the spade ruff)|pg||
nt|barnets: not a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|finch: 1100 rather if they find the spade ruff|pg||
nt|athene: 6@H is 1100 isn't it?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Meck wrote "Michaels" for 2@h - Rod wrote a lot more, but I suspect said the same thing|pg||
nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|barnets: and thats where they are in the closed exactly|pg||
nt|athene: the nebulous 1@D opener makes things harder for east|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: the major suit kings are irrelevant to the tricks in diamonds, but swap them round and NS are only 1 off in 6@H|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@Hx|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: ns can almost make a slam in spades|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H with 4@S and a void sort of undisciplined however more and more seem to be|pg||
nt|mariner1: doing this type pre-empts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough way to lose a 9 card @S fit|pg||
nt|gavin: there are arguments for it and against it|pg||
nt|gavin: they are playing a strong club|pg||
nt|mariner1: could see a big swing here too|pg||
nt|gavin: and in my opinion first chair white vs red|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sga1: Atleast EW opened their account with 1 IMP|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps better simply to transfer to spades with that east hand, if you play 1N - 2@C; 2@D - 2@S as constructive|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 6@h is a nice spot, but can go off on a @s tap|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: 1NT more or less forced when you have a 16-count, since 1@H - 1NT would leave you with a tricky rebid decision.|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S interesting - did Rodwell choose spades over hearts so that the revealed hand isn't declarer?|pg||
nt|gavin: this is a perfect 1H opening playing a strong club|pg||
nt|mariner1: agreed, much prefer 1@H than 2@H,,,,,|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes - in context of big club -- 1@H very nice choice|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Levin: "sorry if I called the card from dummy too fast"|pg||
nt|mariner1: light openers are common today also|pg||
pc|s4|nt|finch: 4@S takes away West's 4@S cue|pg||
nt|athene: if Meckstroth plays the hand, the defenders can look at dummy and say "we have spade ruffs!"|pg||
nt|athene: but if Rodwell plays it, it's not so obvious he has a heart fit|pg||
nt|finch: and he must suspect that West is about to raise clubs, so wants to make it harder for EW|pg||
nt|barnets: down 3 in6H|pg||
nt|barnets: so will be a gain for nickell-- well done by them to reach their slam|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sga1: Nickell has a difficult hand for bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: And it would be embarrassing to be in 6@h down 1 when your teammates were defending 2@h|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Nickell took a conservative view here, and will be disappointed to find that 6@c or 5@h can make|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sga1: Here after N opened they r playing Part score, in closed N passed so they r in 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: these 2-suiters are very tricky playing 2-over-1|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Freeman: I was starting to be embarrassed to have opened this hand - puts down the @h KQ and Nickell sort of laughs|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c2|pg||

nt|ahollan1: camera on Josh??|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|brolucius: West has shown five hearts, which will probably be enough to persuade Rodwell to look elsewhere for his opening lead.|pg||
nt|sga1: Otherwise open 1 of the major.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Ekeblad tells Meck that if their "methods" were still on by passed hand, then 3@d would have shown clubs because 3@c would be a heart raise. If not, 3@d shows diamonds. Weichsel ...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: june 10 2009  16:05 PDT|pg||
nt|mariner1: good Cansino/Pearson count|pg||
nt|mariner1: or bad so no bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: After Bruce passed, Levin said "good decision"|pg||
nt|gavin: yeh levin looking at great spades|pg||
nt|gavin: he knows its a 3 imp loss in equity|pg||
nt|gavin: (his side probably making 110ish)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D 1st seat or not?   great suit, but 7222|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N EW is the spot here, 4@H can be beat|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: ten tricks in clubs for E-W; nine in hearts for N-S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 1@d is the same Canape: 12-14 Balanced (may have 2@d, may have 4cM)/10-15, 6+@d one-suited/10-15, both minors (5+/4+)/10-15, 5+@s-4+@d/10-15, 1=4=4=4 or 4=1=4=4 or 4=4=4=1|pg||
nt|finch: but there seemed little point in holding on to all those low diamond pips|pg||
nt|gavin: need to find a 3nt bid|pg||
nt|gavin: though north will have to lead a black suit to beat 4H|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|sga1: Fleischer finally in the leader position|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1@s is Invitational or worse I believe|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter signaled that it wasn't a very serious alert and wrote stuff that I (of course) can't read|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: mind you in a long match there's much to be said for taking game off when you can and worrying later about the odd extra undertrick|pg||
nt|gavin: 9 aces in 3nt with no risk of the opponents taking 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: Freemand asks about 3@c - 4 @ds and 6 @cs at least |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: Ekeblad asks if 2@c shows 4, Meck says 3+|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it promises a top heart honour as well as "values"?|pg||
nt|gavin: in 4H the defense can negotiate 2 clubs a club ruff and a spade trick|pg||
nt|gavin: parker will lead a minor|pg||
nt|gavin: most likely diamond Q|pg||
nt|gavin: or whatever they lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: Since 3@D was invitational on the first round, I wonder what it means now. Cannot be a sign-off because he had 2@D available.|pg||
nt|sga1: SO forcing now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Looks like 3@D is a make, anyway.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I believe that 2@d would have been artificial, so this was the lowest level at which he could bid a non-invitational 3@d|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Thanks Jan :)|pg||
nt|finch: EW are playing an unusual system 1@D includes weak NT hands and 4414|pg||
nt|gavin: claim|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Levin asks about the lead "Rusinow" |pg||
pc|d6|nt|bigtrain: XX shows exactly 2@H with values|pg||
nt|finch: to see a summary go to http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&task=list&event=14 and click on 'Weichsel'|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Meckstroth was very clear that it showed 2 hearts - Rod wrote and I couldn't read, but now that I know, it's clearer :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: nothing about trump honors|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Vugraphu1: Some questions about 3@c - "considering he didn't open 1@c, he has a good hand"|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell was the one thinking, not Ekeblad - sorry, I was typing|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might be able to set up spades perhaps?|pg||
nt|finch: this double probably shows an honour, however|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to bang down @H then claim|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sga1: was 2@d transfer to @hs?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell: "well... sorry if this is wrong"|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jbgood: 4 @s is making next door - a club lead|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@h is being played by Weichsel in the CR|pg||
nt|athene: he has 3 trump entries to dummy|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it has nothing to do with honors in the @H suit|pg||
nt|finch: the first double didn't, but the second double probably did|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes definitely wants a @H lead -- to busy answering questions to actually look up at the bidding  :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: so might make 150 if the defence don't take some hearts |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@h and 4@c can both be made, so probably a 1 IMP gain for Fleisher|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's sequence might have worked luckily, but I don't think it is well chosen. Does he not hold game-try values? Perhaps an immediate 3@D was possible.|pg||
nt|finch: North knows now to lead a low heart, which keeps this to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|finch: three rounds of hearts generates a trump promotion|pg||
nt|athene: they could have done the same @HA, @HK, @DA, heart maybe? but this is neater|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell asks G: "so what might you have here?" G: "If I have 4 spades, either 4441 or 4 spades and 5 diamonds"|pg||

nt|athene: and north might wade in |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Nice slam here, let's see if they can find it|pg||
nt|gavin: 1S P 2S all out |pg||
nt|mariner1: @S partial here?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Vugraphu1: Ekeblad mumbling something about switching to a club ... thought you had 4 spades, Peter ....|pg||
nt|athene: you can't keep a good @SJ down :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 14-16|pg||
nt|gavin: i think north south can defeat 2S|pg||
nt|gavin: by leading trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: boo|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes, good 6 in minor|pg||
nt|gavin: will take very carefull defense|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: 2@S might make it a little harder for them|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Not sure what 1@H is here|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Both sides are explaining 1@h - Rubin, who's writing in big letters, has hidden the note from me behind his bidding box. Granovetter is unreadable :)|pg||
nt|gavin: maybe not with the 8S onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: uncontested after opening 1@c Strong, it is easy to bid these slams.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: size ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: 1@d by Meckstroth :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell and Weichsel discussing the 1@h bid - Rod wrote and then they talked|pg||
nt|sga1: 1@s should deny 4-card major and trf to NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I meant 1@s of course|pg||
nt|mariner1: we are 2 boards and a bid faster than Closed Room|pg||
nt|gavin: rather doubleton|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D lead?|pg||
nt|gavin: very likely to lead diamonds|pg||
nt|gavin: but i think it takes a trump to have a chance to beat it, |pg||
nt|mariner1: too bad S has no promoteable trump|pg||
nt|gavin: very complicated hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rogoff studying his hand, thinking about balancing I guess|pg||
nt|gavin: his side has a magical make of 3C|pg||
nt|gavin: 3-3 hearts and both clubs onside|pg||
nt|gavin: just lose 2 hearts 1 spade and 1 diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I see. Will look later.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S is a transfer to 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Now Meck writing |pg||
pc|d6|nt|Vugraphu1: It looks to me as if Meck wrote "Art, 8+"|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@c = MAX|pg||
nt|gavin: so now in order to make this hand|pg||
nt|gavin: weinstein will have to carefully keep the 6s in his had|pg||
nt|gavin: lead QS then JS overtaking with the king|pg||
nt|gavin: forcing a spade entry with the 7 to enjoy his diamonds|pg||
nt|gavin: if north had the 8S instead of the 5, this would be unmakeable|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 52, our passout, the Closed Room is in 3@H|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mtvesuvius: Probably a nice relay I would think :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: '8+' may help declarer to read the @SQ if E-W end in game somewhere.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am still being asked how a club switch would beat 3NT on board 6. @CQ from Meck, declarer must duck, then another club. Declarer must duck again. Rodwell wins and switches to ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @SJ. Down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1:  Now Weichsel asking questions - Rod writing - can't see of course :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: yes, west is just asking his partner what he has got|pg||
pc|d9|nt|barnets: same contract same lead|pg||
nt|barnets: at both tables|pg||
nt|athene: you have to go for clubs first, to knock out the entry to the long diamonds?|pg||
nt|finch: seeing al four hands, yes|pg||
nt|athene: actually if you lead a small spade from dummy, east can't jump in with @SA, because then you have three spade tricks|pg||
nt|finch: you have to get trick 1 right as well|pg||
nt|barnets: in the other room dec won the ace crossed to a heart and led a spade|pg||
nt|finch: all things being equal, a lead from Q10 or K10 is more likely than one from KQ|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|barnets: now east could have won this and played a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: you only go up with @DJ if you need 2 fast diamonds or a fast dummy entry?|pg||
nt|barnets: bur he ducked and declarer played the K|pg||
nt|barnets: now west should have unblocked the J of spade bur he didnt|pg||
nt|barnets: and declarer eventually got home|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell has put his cards down on the table and is fiddling with his mustache, which hopefully will provide inspiration :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: It would have the same effect after Rodwell overtook @H10. A low club would defeat it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mariner1: E opened 1@D there|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: it's surprising how often that idea comes up - unblocking Jx in case partner has A10x(x)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|brolucius: Weichsel must think that he has already show his spades with the previous double.|pg||
nt|brolucius: E-W managed the bidding well after the banana-skin laid before them.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Now Eke asks about the bidding and Meck says "he's balanced, 8+, maybe 7"  Eke asks re Majors, "no, it's like a 1N bid|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Vugraphu1: one of them is relaying, but since they're being so efficient, I'm not sure which :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: now he's dead|pg||
nt|gavin: wow |pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: i am sure west will be asking|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Now it's clear it's West|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Correct, and the 3NT bid would confirm that :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Now if we only had the definition of Rubin's bids... :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I suspect they'll tell us when the auction is over|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gavin: im suprised parker won the trick|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|barnets: garozzo did it many times to his gain and I read an article on it|pg||
nt|finch: I can't see a strong reason to play one way or the other: this line needs West to have Ax of spades, or East to have both aces|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rubin has now covered up his notes, which I probably wouldn't have been able to decipher anyway, so those don't help.|pg||
nt|finch: or if West has the ace of spades, to pick the clubs|pg||
nt|gavin: he can see that entries to dummy are going to be a problem|pg||
nt|gavin: that was an unthoughtfull play |pg||
pc|cA|nt|sga1: It is all Greek and Latin to us. :)|pg||
nt|athene: is their system based on Ultimate Club?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: if so, 1@H was the strongest response (4+ controls)|pg||
nt|athene: just showing controls, not shape - like the old-style Italian Blue Club|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Yes, their system is Ultimate Club - exactly same as Ekeblad-Weichsel|pg||
nt|athene: ah right ok|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I'm told that Granovetter is just asking, and has now asked about @d, and Rubin saying his hand is "Medium" for @d|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter has a bid out but has put it upside down on the table and is mentally reviewing the bidding|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hamman and Zia are playing 6@c in a much shorter auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Nickell just wrote a note asking something, but Granovetter sort of brushed it off|pg||
nt|athene: was it a note asking for the loan of some pass cards?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: :) No, he actually has one more in his bidding box|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Not yet, I have seen several auctions where their opponents passed 11 or 12 times|pg||
nt|athene: i am guessing that east showed extras + shape by 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: in relay systems you try to get that in by 3NT as often as possible - unless you have some real freak shape|pg||
nt|finch: the alternative gained when East has Axx of spades, as he couldn't afford to rise on a spade to the king|pg||
nt|gavin: now the play is routine|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mtvesuvius: I'm told that Rubin has shown an Opening hand that's 2326|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: whoever told you that isn't lying!|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm ok|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room if East had flown @SA dec would have 3 spade winners|pg||
nt|gavin: ew is as solid as they come|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gavin: every card is good in both hands|pg||
nt|gavin: north lead low high in clubs|pg||
nt|gavin: and i imagine from watching his carding all day|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: if 4@S was asking about diamonds and 5@C showed "medium" - 5@H has to be some sort of grand slam try for diamonds|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 5@h is apparently RKC for @d|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and they have reached a good spot, which will be a nice gain for them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C seems slightly better than 6@D because of the texture of the trump suit. However, that is virtually impossible to locate|pg||
nt|athene: how did 6@C go down?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: With only 8 rounds of bidding too! Speedy :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter says: "I've shown nothing - he's shown a balanced hand 12-14 HCP, 6 @cs - then he showed 1 Keycard + trump and either the heart K or the black Ks|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 6@c went down when Zia tried to pitch his @d loser on the @s|pg||
nt|athene: yes that was unfortunate for Zia|pg||
nt|athene: he ruffed his heart in dummy and then just tried to avoid th @D finesse |pg||
nt|athene: unlucky that the @DK is onside all along but spades 6-2|pg||
nt|athene: @SAxx or @SAxxx is more likely than @SAx, isn't it?|pg||
nt|barnets: so it was west who had to unblock his SJ|pg||
nt|athene: since any given high card is more likely to be with length than shortage|pg||
nt|finch: but even if West can't afford to rise with the @SA, declarer would still have needed two tricks from clubs|pg||
nt|finch: east, sorry|pg||
nt|finch: at this table, he was hopeing West couldn't afford to rise with the spade ace, but has the gain of having it short|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Meck was getting coffee (honest, he's given up smoking) and came back to ask "what was the fate" - Rod "2 down ... wanted to be in game ... if I play double dummy I can make it ... ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: took the normal line I think"|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphu1: Actually, Granovetter got which Ks wrong, but Rubin corrected him. Then Freeman asked if Rubin was the declarer, laughing|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: The only problem with the relay, is that Rubin winds up playing this... and he has disclosed his entire shape|pg||
nt|athene: ye|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rubin leaning on his elbows on the table, studying the dummy|pg||
nt|athene: if the relayer is declarer, the defence has a really horrible task|pg||
nt|athene: but you can't always ensure that|pg||
nt|athene: this is all about playing the diamond suit for one loser|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: When this hand started, Nickell happened to ask about the time, so I looked at the clock and there were 63 minutes for the next 8 boards - now there are 50 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not really, because you can adopt Zia's line. That would not be silly|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes there are other considerations - for example, you fear a ruff so just want to get trumps drawn fast|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think Rubin expects spades to be 7-1|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and they are not|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: :)|pg||
nt|gavin: that weinstein has noted that he isnt the type of player to randomly lead low from a doubleton|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: so he will just be flipping through his Bridge Encyclopaedia, looking for "suit combinations"|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gavin: but he elected to ruff high since spades couldnt be 5-0 in the auction|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Diamond 124 v Ozdiil 90     Cohler 119 v Meltzer 94|pg||
nt|gavin: well ew have the values for game but need to reach 3NT which may be difficult if north bids hearts since the strong hand doesnt have a heart stopper|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@H lead director|pg||
nt|mariner1: E knows W has virtually nothing|pg||
nt|mariner1: except W has something|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I think the real score here is 116-115. If this match ends in a tie, there's a 6 board playoff|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphu1: Weichsel had 2@s out, now put it back to think some more|pg||
nt|brolucius: West has a very useful hand for his 8 points.|pg||
nt|finch: interesting that neither table thought to try 4@H which had less stopper problems|pg||
mb|p|an|could xx to shoe 3 !hs|nt|ahollan1: most big clubbers using 1@D-2@H/@S as artificial bids these days, so no weak jump shift available|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rogoff Pass probably denies 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: else  Support RDBL|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I keep saying that these 3 USA2 matches are close - the fourth one is over, Nussbaum having withdrawn at the 3/4 vs Strul|pg||
nt|mariner1: the PASSOUTS we see here and in MOVIE for CLOSED ROOM were entered|pg||
nt|mariner1: because scores from a previous session were still in place|pg||
mb|3S|an|Not a strong bid|nt|brolucius: If West's bid shows 8+, in traditional style, then I guess East will close his eyes and get to the slam.|pg||
nt|athene: off we go again!|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if we get enough of these auctions, we will be able to reverse-engineer their system and actually know what the bids mean :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Nickell: "Not this auction again"|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brolucius: West has declined to cue-bid the @DA (if the bidding is what it seems), which was a strange decision. Usually you show an ace when it does not raise the level.|pg||
nt|jbgood: I think he will even do it with his eyes open:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would have done over 4@D.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Weichsel counting tricks (I think) on his fingers and studying his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: After 1NT - "oh good"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: LOL|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell did comment that 4@h might make then reconsidered and said it couldn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: friendly layout for declarer here - just @CK, @SA to lose|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so the passouts will disappear as Closed Room plays the boards, unless they are|pg||
nt|mariner1: actually passed out|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 170 v 66 after 45 boards was just too much for Nussbaum|pg||
nt|gavin: this one looks like it will make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs hyperactive big clubbers -- actual passout for them not in the cards  [so to speak]|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Parker just went to the bathroom and now he came back and said "down 2?" Levin: "I hope so :)"|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brolucius: Does he have 12 fingers?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Eke: "I forgot to tell you 3@h was stronger than 4@h" Weichsel: "this time it was; hopefully you have a play"|pg||
nt|athene: if rodwell returns a club, declarer might not want to take the heart finesse perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: for fear that south has the @HQ rather than @DQ|pg||
nt|athene: then the finesse loses, spade back to ace, club ruff|pg||
nt|athene: but of course the @HQ appears so all is well|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter to Rubin: "you have nothing to read?" Rubin: "it's okay" Now Granovetter is reading his Hebrew book|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Is 2@h another relay?|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: ok, thanks :)|pg||
nt|athene: well, at least the play will be speedy :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: a kibitzer makes the point that north might have led a diamond from @DKQ|pg||
nt|athene: so south is likely to have diamond honour and hence not @HQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mtvesuvius: I think 4@d is RKC for @d|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@s is 1/4 KCs I would think|pg||
nt|athene: in that case 4nt wld be asking for @DQ, though|pg||
nt|athene: why wld west want to do that?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rubin has just written that 4@d set SPADES as trump and he said he didn't like his hand for spades.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: 4NT was Keycard (I guess for spades) and 5@c = 1 or 4|pg||

nt|athene: these manoeuvres are OK as long as partner doesn't woodenly correct your 6-level bid|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: That would never happen :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter says that he thinks Rubin has 2353, and that he asked about spades and Rubin didn't like his hand for spades and has 1 or 4 Keycards for spades and 6@d was to play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Impressive|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Nicely done once again|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: These must be dream hands for Granovetter and Rubin|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Nickell asks if Rubin could have bid 6@s and Granovetter says no, I was completely the captain|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder what the difference is between 2@S and 3@S for Levin-Weinstein|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gavin: 2S is like an 8 count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4 vs 5 card suit?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gavin: 3S is a distributional hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh|pg||
nt|gavin: he felt his two doubletons plus 5 card suit was good enough for a 3 bid|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mtvesuvius: I think Granovetter may have been trying to find out about the Q@S here|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|gavin: 2S would be 4 card suit 7-9 or so|pg||
nt|gavin: he can also bid 2H or 2D depending on their agreement to show a vry good 2S bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S was quite a leap to me......|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Well, no dull hands this set, that's for sure|pg||
nt|athene: the third 5@H-6@C hand for NS this set!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hamman is in 4@s doubled in the CR|pg||
nt|finch: I recognise the West hand.  It's the one I get at rubber bridge.|pg||
nt|gavin: need to avoid 3NT on this hand|pg||
nt|gavin: though with hearts 6-3 with the 6 card suit having no entries|pg||
nt|gavin: they will survive|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Levin: "did I have about what I showed?" Weinstein: "I thought maybe a 6th spade"|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 14-16|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Zia went down in the spade game that required the @SQ guess, which has closed the margin a bit.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1@d once again is Canape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like 1 down|pg||
nt|bigtrain: puppet stayman|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah i would think what steve though|pg||
nt|gavin: thought|pg||
nt|gavin: typically that bid would show 6S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C makes here I think|pg||
nt|gavin: i think levin thinks so too but thought the 5-4-2-2 was worth a 6 card spade suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rogoff: "you didn't think 1@d was going to play very well, Josh?" Parker "I bid my 7 card suit; I'm a simple soul"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cohler Meltzer - with one table on final board   119-114|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|Vugraphu1: Weichsel just tossed a piece of paper (as usual, he likes to crumple up the notes and toss them so I can never see them) into the wastebasket and is taking bows for making the ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: "basket"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1@s is Invitational or Worse, and natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: interesting that he passed the 11-count last hand but opens the 10-count this time|pg||
nt|athene: two aces and 7-card suit makes a difference|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Support double then I assume|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed 1 down|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@h is a nice spot for NS, and 4@s will of course be a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rubin seemed to think it was a support DBL but Granovetter is acting as if he doesn't know what it is - sort of shrugging|pg||
nt|athene: Hamman-Zia don't play support doubles? or just not in that auction?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: almost amazing we have ANY kibitzers in our room|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bigtrain: no 5-card major|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|an|splinter|nt|athene: 4@S looks like the bid of a man who expected/hoped for 4 trumps opposite :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: This will probably be a small pickup for Nickell.... 6 IMPs probably|pg||
nt|gavin: well they are out of 3nt now|pg||
nt|gavin: and they will not try to play a 4-3 spade fit because the hand with shortness is the hand with 4s and can not afford to ruff |pg||
nt|mariner1: Diamond - Ozdil (Moss table) has 8 1/2 boards left to play|pg||
nt|gavin: hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: Diamond 124   Ozdil 108|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is slooooooooooow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strange system seemingly ignoring the potential 44 @S fit -- 2@C Stayman seemed like normal approach|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: This sounds like the auction I would have - 3@h showed a splinter and partner can bid 3@s with 4 of them to play the 4-4 spade fit|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|brolucius: Meckstroth perhaps considering 4@H for the lead. No, he has taken away bidding space with 5@C.|pg||
nt|finch: I was waiting to see more of the NS system, as if North has a perfect hand slam could be there|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Which is a correct save. E-W did well not to bid 5@S|pg||
nt|gavin: woah|pg||
nt|gavin: 5C?!?!?!?!|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: overtake this, return club...now will Nickell finesse hearts?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 9 IMPs, sorry, I had the wrong Vul. :)|pg||
nt|finch: But in the long term it's not right to pursue perfect fit slams as partner gets a bit over-excited when he merely has|pg||
nt|gavin: he has the stone perfect hand for slam|pg||
nt|gavin: opposite so many hands|pg||
nt|mariner1: so found the spot :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C game try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ba da bump|pg||
nt|gavin: he cannot have a better hand for slam|pg||
nt|gavin: making a shut out bid|pg||
nt|gavin: is shocking|pg||
nt|gavin: he may have been worried that 4C was non forcing|pg||
nt|gavin: but there are other bids, like 4H|pg||
nt|mariner1: not a Roland slam...... A. too high %    B. does not make|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Parker says: "I have 3 ways to tell him I like clubs and this was the strongest one" He has 5 clubs and a singleton heart, 3145, so he either has 4 spades or a 6th club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but we can agree -- everybody opens 1N |pg||
nt|gavin: 5C was the strongest action ?|pg||
nt|gavin: jan ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: That's what he said|pg||
nt|gavin: ok well then :)|pg||
nt|gavin: good bid!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anti-fast arrival|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N here too Al|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rogoff says he should have 10 or 11 points outside of the heart suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: he being Parker|pg||
pc|h8|nt|finch: 80% of a perfect hand|pg||
nt|gavin: meaning the worst non 3nt bid ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Weinstein asks about range - 14+-17|pg||
pc|h5|nt|brolucius: West can afford to play the wrong red suit, since he holds a trump trick. |pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Weichsel: "I'm just thinking for a second"|pg||
nt|tlc: god scissors coup hand..win club lead DK,pitch spade|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: With the trumps this way, 4@h can always make|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|jbgood: but I am sure E asked for a @d return with his smallest spade..|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to see that declarer must refuse the finesse|pg||
nt|gavin: very specific agreements|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|athene: but you would look silly if you played @HA and another|pg||
nt|athene: and east won @HKx, put his partner in and got a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: @HKxx sorry|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|brolucius: If trumps were 1-1, it seems that this heart switch would lead to a squeeze without the count on East in the red suits.|pg||
nt|athene: there is scissors coup possibility|pg||
nt|athene: but also|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps east was being cute|pg||
nt|mariner1: N is a very good 16, worth close to 18|pg||
nt|mariner1: K & R says 16.5 so not as good I as I guessed|pg||
pc|c6|nt|barnets: in the other room south showed his club suit and a diamond singleton before stopping in 3N|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: and actually it's west who has the short clubs|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: As Leon Jacobs points out, 5@S has a chance. It may be possible to squeeze Rodwell in the red suits|pg||
nt|gavin: when parker sees that clubs are two two|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Right, sciscors coup would be good here|pg||
nt|tlc: then you can afford Ace and a heart|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: @c ruff now for -1|pg||
nt|athene: i guess that's unlikely as he wld lead a stiff @C for sure|pg||
nt|gavin: he has a complete claim on the hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: rodwell could have showed GF with clubs but probably would have had to give up on the 5-3 major fit investigation|pg||
nt|gavin: ruffing all his losers and running the jack of diamonds into weinstein|pg||
pc|h2|pc|cQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: you can't afford @HA and another if west has stiff @C and east has @HKx :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Nickell: "sorry"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: eliminate pointed suits @D spots make it a lock to hook into Weinstein|pg||
pc|s6|nt|finch: certainly finding out about the diamond wastage will stop any further investigation|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|finch: declarer can't really afford the spade finesse early as if it loses a diamond trhough would be embarrasing|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry eliminate majors|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h6|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: North must lead a diamond at every opportunity to break up the squeeze|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no @H ruff??|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|gavin: he just had to time it out so his last ruff was in dummy|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h3|pg||
nt|gavin: so he could lead the Jack of diamonds|pg||

nt|gavin: it mattered|pg||
nt|gavin: had to be in the order he did it|pg||

nt|mariner1: NS have a 3N here|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Discussion that "the vile 3N would make"|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: but only because Weinstein was short in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: when the defence are going to use a suit to get back and forth|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Jan, no result is shown for that board|pg||
nt|athene: (spades here)|pg||
nt|athene: you want to cut their communications|pg||
nt|athene: so|pg||
nt|athene: for example|pg||
nt|athene: if east was going to put west on lead with a spade, to get a ruff|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think you'll just have to enter the score manually I think|pg||
nt|athene: you lead @DK and throw spade from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: east, with the @DA, has to win|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry was flat my mistake|pg||
nt|athene: a bit good for 1nt overcall perhaps|pg||
nt|barnets: saw something different|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- parker line 100%  my claim sloppy|pg||
nt|gavin: jacobs actually only leads by 5 right now|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Levin asked what they would have done with a 4-4 spade fit and Rogoff explains that N would have bid 3@s over 3@h with 4 - |pg||
mb|2D|nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell made sure that Weichsel had seen the alert to 1@d and Weichsel says "you don't have to alert the diamond or the club"|pg||
nt|athene: and west is kept off lead|pg||
nt|athene: he might take a point off for 4333|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: XX = 4+@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meltzer v Cohler still 5 imp diff   one table finished -- the other 4 to play|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Vugraphu1: So I should ask him?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now a gentle 1@D from East?  free 1@S shows his hand quite nicely |pg||
nt|athene: sorry gentle 1@S|pg||
nt|finch: Does this count as a 'free' 1@S?  Or should pass show a penalty pass of diamonds?|pg||
nt|athene: most people play that (1x) X (xx) pass isn't penalties|pg||
nt|athene: at higher levels, it might be|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: This RDBL was a transfer to hearts, not a normal XX|pg||
nt|athene: admittedly, the exact level and auction can cause some ambiguities :) which lead to interesting scores|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: like 2@DXX up two i remember Forrester/Bahkshi got in a recent match|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not 2@S?|pg||
nt|gavin: in the other room north will rebid 2S not 2H|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: no-one seems interested in the 4-4 heart fit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry, they have this board on the table backwards|pg||
nt|finch: West couldn't resist a reoudble here... the alternative of 1NT would be too normal|pg||
nt|athene: Rodwell must be loving this auction - he invented support doubles (redoubles) and we have two here :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's official -- i know nothing of the NS auctions except the opening bid|pg||
mb|3N|an|semi-serious slam try per N|nt|athene: negative double looks more normal |pg||
nt|finch: It takes a club lead to beat 3NT, the one suit that no-one has bid yet|pg||
nt|finch: opposite 3-crd heart support, Meckstroth would do well not to lead a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: If East had not wasted his @H6 on the previous hand, he could have exited with a top heart, pinning declarer's @H8 and made another trick with the @H6.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell: "good luck"|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Vugraphu1: Weichsel: "I"m just thinking a second"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Robinson having a fantastic set against Welland.  100-44  to Robinson now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Same spot in the CR|pg||
nt|athene: interesting auction|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ok, thanks Jan... now it's rightsided and can make|pg||
nt|athene: only 2nt, rather than 3nt, from west suggests he isn't expecting much (if anything) for the 'free' 1@S |pg||
nt|finch: 3@D another murky call, but this one is definitely natural: if East wants to cue bid, he could have bid 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: the 3@D bid gives Meckstroth a little more chance to find the club lead, if West bids 3NT now|pg||
nt|finch: which would be unambigous I think.  West's only problem is whether it's the hand East has, or a much weaker one|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, east isn't getting in to put a spade through|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: If played in the North, it would be -1|pg||
nt|athene: with spades probably 5-3, declarer just has to decide who has @CA|pg||
nt|athene: if east has it, you hold up in spades|pg||
nt|athene: if west has it, you win at once, as @SJx is a stopper|pg||
nt|finch: I wonder how many people have discussed exactly this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: that alert only came on parker's side of the screen ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: so N prefers the Moysian @S game|pg||
nt|gavin: clearly rogoff intended it to play|pg||
nt|gavin: parker took it as semi-serious slam try|pg||
nt|gavin: ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm soooooo confused|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S has little play|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Correct - Parker thought 3NT was a "semi-serious" slam try but Rogoff didn't alert, presumably intended it as natural|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gavin: jacobs is +5 with boards 56' comparison to go|pg||
nt|gavin: 121-116|pg||
nt|gavin: a sort of marked club lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rogoff asks "you're playing standard count, upside down attitude and leads are standard?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Levin: "yes"|pg||
nt|gavin: since rogoff didnt bid 2NT over 2H|pg||
nt|gavin: and levin heart rogoff try to bid 3NT natural|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gavin: heard|pg||
nt|gavin: he knows rogoff's clubs are weak|pg||
nt|gavin: now this contract has no chance|pg||
nt|gavin: good lead|pg||
nt|gavin: it never really had any chance :P|pg||
pc|c6|nt|barnets: if north leads a heart its home|pg||
nt|athene: well about 2,000 people have heard us discuss it :) that's a start|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Granovetter sort of threw the 3NT bid on the table, as if to say "who knows"|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|finch: don't forget they are playing with screens, by the way, so the long pause before South's pass was probably West thinking|pg||
nt|mariner1: right at least one off|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mtvesuvius: Nickell decided that West had it for the overcall, and will make|pg||
nt|athene: yes, was normal and sensible view, i think|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Actually, Freeman is playing the hand, because the board is backwards - I'm not going to bother changing names, because it doesn't "stick" in the movie anyway :)|pg||
nt|athene: Granovetter will be working out what is the least his partner needs to beat this|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: So, unusually, it is Rubin and not Granovetter who is thinking here|pg||
nt|athene: of course, as the cards lie, it's cold, so he will discount this layout|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rubin just asked "am I wasting my time?"|pg||
nt|gavin: now the score is correct|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|brolucius: We are lucky to have all these table-side 'extras' from Jan. Many thanks!|pg||
nt|athene: west plays his partner for a diamond stopper|pg||
nt|athene: these nebulous minor openers are real two-edged swords|pg||
nt|athene: if you declare (or you are on lead) you often have a surprise weapon - your real suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Yes, it was, sorry - I was slow to put the pass in|pg||
nt|athene: but if partner is on lead...|pg||
nt|barnets: i think a spade lead could have beaten it as well as a club|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: As I said last quarter, whenever there's a break in tempo, you can assume it's Granovetter and be right more often than not|pg||
nt|barnets: dec only has 8 tricks by ducking the diamond|pg||
nt|gavin: 122-121 rogoff|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: However, I'm afraid you don't always get the right Meck cards - he plays them very quickly and blocks my view with his hand - he actually won the first trick with the K|pg||
nt|finch: agree a spade lead would beat it, but that seems a slightly odd choice as dummy has bid them|pg||
nt|barnets: yes agreed|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Or last 8th I mean - I see that I mis-typed when I entered the segment number - this is 3 of 8, not 3 of 6|pg||
nt|gavin: both tables have 4 boards to play|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jbgood: Yes, they are great, it is almost as if we are at the table:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is almost like being there yourself, is it not?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: Diamond 124  Ozdil 114  -- so all 3 coming down to the wire|pg||
pc|cT|nt|finch: a heart back now still gives declarer problems|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell has been thinking, now fanned his cards so about ready to play I think - has a club out|pg||
nt|finch: what does declarer know about South's shape? exactly 3 hearts, 2 or 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|mariner1: Closed Room is in 3N here|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Now, Hamman is in 5@S on 11|pg||

nt|gavin: are they playing same boards ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: No, different boards in each match|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|s7|nt|mtvesuvius: Freeman going for overtricks :)|pg||
nt|athene: heart finesse was safe at that point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that should end gripes from fans who wanted to see the USA1 Semi-Finals :)|pg||
nt|gavin: he will do best here by overruffing|pg||
nt|gavin: leading a low heart and ruffing it|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart return, declarer's best might have been to lead @CQ? if he puts south with @CAK|pg||
nt|gavin: and starting to lead high diamonds|pg||
nt|gavin: though he discarded|pg||
nt|gavin: so he will lose 1 more trick|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Levin and Parker are both confused by that play |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|finch: Rodwell went for the simple approach of partner having the @CQ|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|finch: a diamond back forcing declarer to run them would have been interesting|pg||
nt|athene: the @CJ might have been enough|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: A heart was led, and as we pointed out here, North will be squeezed in the red suits|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is a piece of cake for a player like Hamman|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sA|mc|7|nt|brolucius: It's a relief to know that Meckstroth does not always make bricks without straw. |pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Short break|pg||
nt|brolucius: Does Meckstroth still smoke? I remember that he was allowed to smoke at the Macallan Pairs, in London, even when the spectators were not.|pg||
nt|jbgood: and Hamman has the position for a squeeze against N - he will not miss it..|pg||
nt|brolucius: Reese wrote that "Meckstroth has the appearance of an American all-in wrestler."|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@S duly made; 8 IMPs to Nickell|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fact, Hamman claimed on a squeeze in the mid-game!  (if there is one, he said)|pg||
nt|brolucius: With good play by both of the Nickell pairs, to earn that 8 IMPs.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After the heart lead, South could have switched to a diamond and break up the squeeze. But he did not and apologised afterwards|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the matching session yesterday, in the QF, there were no fewer than four 1NT contracts. The great Shuffler has shown us more sympathy today.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Which teams are playing in the other semi-final?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Other semi-final: Welland up by 3 against Robinson after 8 comparisons|pg||
nt|sga1: Rather Long break here.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks. Is there any financial benefit in being USA1 rather than USA2?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only Jan can answer that question; my guess is 'no'|pg||
nt|brolucius: I remember once that the top team had their travel paid. But that must have been decades ago. Everything paid nowadays.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: We're back and in answer to your question - I've forgotten - I think the answer is still no, but there may be a very small difference in the subsidy amount|pg||
nt|gavin: so 3nt has play on that hand|pg||
nt|gavin: if levins hand leads JC|pg||
nt|gavin: then you have to guess at trick one|pg||
nt|gavin: which is what he may lead on the auction 1H - 2D - 2S|pg||
nt|gavin: maybe still make |pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Each player gets a certain amount per day that the team remains in the event plus 2 days to acclimate and one to leave - there was some discussion about making that amount ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: different for USA1 and USA2, but I just can't recall the resulution|pg||
nt|athene: if west had cleared spades, it wouldn't have been, but that wld still have given overtrick of course|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Rodwell asks Granovetter what his clubs were|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 4@s being played by Weichsel in the CR here|pg||
nt|athene: no 2@S opener for north!|pg||
nt|finch: in general when you aren't sure what the best defence, there is a lot to be said for playing for the simple layout|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brolucius: Trivial, I expect, compared to the amounts that they usually earn.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The pros on USA1 may be able to charge more than the pros on USA2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But that has nothing to do with the USBF|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C = ART, major GF|pg||
nt|finch: it's not obviously worse than the more complicated 'see what happens on the run of the diamonds'|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @H raise that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Roland pointed out, a week or so ago, that some countries would find it difficult to afford to send their teams to Brazil.|pg||
nt|brolucius: No such problems for England, since neither of our teams qualified (so difficult in Europe).|pg||
nt|sga1: 4@s - may be quatitative?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S a quantitative raise to 4NT, yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Ekeblad wrote about 4@s but my view is blocked by some coffee cups on the table - Weichsel thinking|pg||
nt|athene: two aces, empty suit....|pg||
nt|athene: that wouldn't stop some people though :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Nice 1@d from Rubin, and it may complicate things a bit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|finch: and it lets you save yourself up for a hand where it definitely matters|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D shows BAL|pg||
nt|athene: there might have been a very cute opportunity on a diamond return|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could run @SJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: this has been an extremely flat set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anybody rebid 2@C rather than 2@D|pg||
nt|gavin: parker/rogoff had two bad game results, one where they played the wrong game|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in a @S partial here I think|pg||
nt|gavin: and one where they defended a part score on their own game hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mariner1: well they have to bid to play|pg||
nt|gavin: other than that nothing has really happened|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Levin wrote a note to Rogoff - I think that 2@d promised 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4NT: 'Forget it'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ekeblad also passed the North cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Because the other Semi-Final match has broken, the director just came to say that no one can leave this room until they have finished|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Right, both matches are playing the same hands|pg||
nt|athene: "this match is broken! no-one leaves the room till we find who did it!"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i particularly like when 2@D=4+|pg||
nt|gavin: if 2D promised 4|pg||
mb|2S!|an|good hand|nt|Vugraphu1: 4@s was a good raise to 4NT|pg||
nt|jbgood: a soft defense put Zia's steat one down for a small loss|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 4@s is doomed, as is 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: one loser in each suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So specs, you are kindly requested to stay in this room until play finishes :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Not much he can do but hope for either major to behave|pg||
nt|athene: if either defender plays their honour, there's a re-entry to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: if they both duck he just runs diamonds for 9|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Meck: "3@d just said you didn't want to show shortness, right?" Rod: "right"|pg||
nt|gavin: weinstein will bid 2S|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|jbgood: steal ..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As it is, you can even make a grand slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Weichsel had A out but then put it back and now has his cards on the table and his head in his hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Weichsel asks about lead - no different against 4NT - 4th but could lead high without interest|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another red suit squeeze|pg||
nt|athene: he knows the spades aren't!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: darn -- i typed that before Jan -- but connection not behaving|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: unless that was a VERY cute lead|pg||
nt|gavin: they play this is a relay to 2NT to show a number of hands|pg||
nt|gavin: i thk|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: then 3D specified diamond raise possibly balanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 2@D opener = Flannery so as you see 1N can contain 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I'm pretty sure Levin wrote some good hand|pg||
nt|gavin: levin has a bad hand facing a passed hand, unless he caught 3 perfect cards like AQC and an A|pg||
nt|gavin: KQC A |pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: w/ JD|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Interesting hands indeed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wd|pg||
nt|gavin: practical pass as 3NT has no hope from levin's perspective|pg||
nt|gavin: no reason to push to a 22 point 11 trick game|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Parker asks about the auction and Weinstein says he showed a strong raise of diamonds and Levin has 4 diamonds. |pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: especially with such a big lead :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gavin: parker knows its time for action since they showed a good raise|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|gavin: he will need to make a trick out of nowhere|pg||
nt|mariner1: and some @S make NS so this might score well anyway|pg||
nt|gavin: now they can take two clubs a club ruff|pg||
nt|gavin: and then play a heart, get in with the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|gavin: and give a heart ruff|pg||
nt|gavin: for down 1|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Can go 2 down now on a club switch, but he obviously tried to make it|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: @c now will establish a @c trick in time|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: But Nickell played to make, as he should|pg||
nt|gavin: a heart lead would have worked as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does it matter when @H is led?  |pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N made on 57 and a big 11 imps|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Not sure why Weichsel rejected with 16 and a nice 5-card suit|pg||
nt|athene: he could have played the diamond before the trump finesse couldn't he?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 2009 USBC will determine which two teams will be representing USA in the Bermuda Bowl to be held in São Paulo, Brazil, in late August and early September |pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow Josh eliminates all chance for defensive error|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Levin: "can I see these? Funny cahds you guys are playing here"|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: i guess that might run into two spade ruffs with @HK right all along?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right, his line was correct if he was going to try to make it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Granovetter wondering which holding the 5 can be from|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know if they lead 3rd from any three cards|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: The losers in the semi-finals will get another chance in the repechage for the USA2 berth|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|gavin: north south looks like they might make a lot of spades|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|d4|nt|brolucius: It seems strange to duck the first trick. Did he not still have chances of 12 tricks if the @SK was offside? |pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Weichsel: "what a stupid game this is" "I'm counting tricks" Meck: "made 6"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe I miscounted. Was only 15, sorry|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: identical auction in the CR|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like 16 to me too, Roland:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Weichsel: "it's a great slam ... about 20%" Meck: "a little better than that" Weichsel: "maybe 25%"|pg||
nt|gavin: they dont have enough trumps for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|gavin: but they certainly have a partial|pg||
nt|gavin: it looks like they have no losers|pg||
nt|gavin: as they dont, from above they only lose 1 heart 1 diamond and 1 spade|pg||
nt|gavin: but you need to rid yourself of all your losers|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gavin: and at some point the defense can lead a couple rounds of trumps|pg||

mc|8|nt|ahollan1: too right Bobby|pg||

pc|h6|nt|brolucius: East was a passed hand, so West can hardly have thought that a game was available. He thinks that 2NT will be the cheapest spot, or perhaps a lucky make.|pg||

nt|mariner1: Wolpert (USA), and Roland Wald (Denmark).....I am Rob Brown (USA)........|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@H OK in third seat, even if you play a range such as 6-10.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welland v Robinson all square through 12 boards|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D majors|pg||
nt|finch: Thanks also to my co-commentators, Barnet Shenkin, Bill Frisby and Walter Johnson.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mtvesuvius: Our appreciation to the USBF for bringing this prestigious event to BBO vugraph. As always, Jan Martel has been instrumental in setting up a great show for the whole world to ...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: watch, in addition to taking time to operate vugraph for us!|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: London, 5:45 am Wednesday Sydney! See you then. :)|pg||
nt|finch: Thanks also to the USBF for allowing us to watch their trials, and...|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: not the best-ever 4@H if you look just at the NS cards - danger of losing club, heart, two spades|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Third segment of the semifinal, Sorry :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Operating is my vacation :). Fun to be here|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 12 boards in two hours? Where is the fierce TD? Should he not be looking through the door?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So a slight delay likely. They are playing the same boards in both matches and we can't have a restart until all teams are ready|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: There are still 6 minutes on the clock :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welland is in 6NT on board 13. That will likely roll in|pg||
nt|jbgood: so a likely double score for Fleisher to round off this set|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: That's correct - if this match wants to start, we'll let them but the  Vugraph audience will be cheated of the first few boards I'm afraid|pg||
nt|sga1: Fleisher should gain 4 imps on this board 3@h should be -1|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and also thanks for bringing the show to life with the comments and conversations at the table :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Meck asks about the K lead "usually from KQ, or asks me to drop the Q if I have it"|pg||
nt|finch: ..finally thanks to BBO and Roland Wald for making this broadcast possible.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: aggression from Ekeblad in the other room! he basically forced to game opposite nothing but tepid heart preference :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: Freeman: "don't have too much"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very strong set for two teams. Robinson in the match against Welland, and here Fleisher against Nickell|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Robinson  100   Welland   44|pg||
nt|finch: The next set starts in about 25 minutes time at 2215 GMT.|pg||
nt|mariner1: also, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates, Sharon|pg||
nt|mariner1: Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no broadcasts.|pg||

nt|mariner1: worldwide!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mtvesuvius: 4@h isn't a great spot, but would survive since the KQ@S are doubleton|pg||
