mb|3N|nt|sybarra: trust me |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|allanr44: When the scores come across, we'll see how they went in the last ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we may see a few hands with final bid and lead and claim |pg||
pc|h4|nt|santyclz: That's why they make the big bucks.|pg||
nt|allanr44: not as much as us though Joe|pg||
nt|sybarra: right,  just like the commentators :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sry all the net is playing up|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: we will try for the next board|pg||
mc|9|nt|allanr44: It is a really trying time for the operators when this happens|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: and we are back|pg||
mb|1C|an|  |mb|p|nt|sybarra: we will try to resurrect scores asap |pg||
mb|2C|an|any 4441|mb|p|mb|2N|an| |nt|santyclz: That's an invitational hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|an|1 heart|mb|p|nt|nigel: Strange considering his previous actions|pg||
nt|nigel: North would call 2@d on all mins|pg||
nt|sybarra: beauty is in the eye of beholder?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nigel: So 2NT=GF natural|pg||
nt|allanr44: 4@S will be in danger with a @D lead if played by north, and maybe by a @H lead if played by south|pg||
nt|allanr44: It's a goner ...|pg||
nt|nigel: So extra system stuff perhaps 2@c is either invitational or three suited|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps 3-suited only in response to 1@c?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|allanr44: 3NT by north seems to be the best contract|pg||
nt|allanr44: hmmm|pg||

nt|santyclz: NEXT!|pg||
nt|allanr44: It seems I cursed the defence here ...|pg||
nt|nigel: Now a heart ruff diamond back 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: hes thinking about something|pg||
nt|allanr44: that's a worry|pg||
nt|nigel: Though could play safe draw trumps for 10|pg||
mc|10|nt|nigel: Taking the safe route|pg||
nt|santyclz: He can guarentee the contract by pulling trump, but only loses a potential o/t if e started with a @d void.|pg||
nt|allanr44: fair enough.  A lucky break|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|santyclz: And he got a favorable lead, so why temp fate?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|allanr44: exactly|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|allanr44: many tricks here|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: and even more tricks |pg||
nt|allanr44: like 12|pg||
pc|sK|nt|santyclz: Looks like one of my leads.|pg||
nt|nigel: Especially now|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: the other table played in 6nt -1|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: I have done that kind of lead trying to beat it |pg||
nt|sybarra: all for naught|pg||
nt|allanr44: the @S8 is a good card, if withheld|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|nigel: he has 12|pg||
mc|12|nt|allanr44: so he does|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sry about the stuff ups we will be back soon|pg||
nt|santyclz: But in a long match, playing the @hq (before claiming) isn't that bad an idea to see how s reacts.|pg||
nt|allanr44: yep|pg||
nt|allanr44: they closed guantanamo didn't they?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: we will be back at 1|pg||
nt|nigel: If this is the last board then it appears the match should be won by Ebery|pg||
nt|nigel: Bye and thanks all:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh, was that the last?|pg||
nt|allanr44: bye all|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, bye.|pg||

nt|sybarra: like in 1 hour or so?|pg||
nt|allanr44: 90 minutes I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if I make it for 90 min,  but hopefully so |pg||
nt|allanr44: you will  :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: Hopefully the net problems will be resolved by then.  Please join and see|pg||
