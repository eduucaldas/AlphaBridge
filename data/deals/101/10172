nt|Gerben42: keeping the match alive|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: no point having fancy stuff when someone forgets|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Gerben42: 15 more boards after this|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably 2@D means no zero|pg||
nt|bridge_one: otherwise 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: going to reach 3N here|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|Gerben42: check bridgebase.com for time schedule|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 3@S transfer to 3N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i don't agrre with this 2NT with xx in @C ...|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: PASS missing!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt by East|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Steve ?|pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|nt|Vugraphu6: Better?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes :) TY very much :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H + 4@D + 2@S + @CA = ... 9|pg||
nt|Gerben42: then only 21 IMPs in it for the last 15 bds|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so dont go away people :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @C lead would beat |pg||
nt|Gerben42: @CK was led in closed, only 8 tricks then|pg||
nt|irwinbo: another 10 for jacobs|pg||
nt|Gerben42: lead depends on auction, here @H is normal - in other room S bid @H and N did not show fit, so you lead @C|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|bridge_one: i think that versus a 2@C hand is more safe the lead with K from KQ10x that @H from KJ |pg||
nt|Gerben42: now Rod in with a chance to beat it|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing over @D for the finesse in @s was winning - difficult opps can duck Q in @s ...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: not sure what he is playing for with this line, seems kinda dangerous|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now need Kx in @D in North if North will return @C|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Gerben42: I think he thinks that Rod finding the switch is worse % than the @S finesse|pg||

nt|bridge_one: this is bridge - never is easy at this game :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|bridge_one: the lead @C would be usefull also to give at p more usefull informations|pg||
mc|9|nt|Gerben42: anyway , 21 IMPs|pg||
nt|Gerben42: for 15 boards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: still 3 boards Gerben ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: finish ? 15 boards ?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|roswolf: yup a similar result is likely to occur|pg||
nt|bobh1: but perhaps the great ozdil-lair partnership will stage yet another comeback|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: leaping michaels strikes|pg||
nt|roswolf: @H +@C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: SLAM TRY NOT FAVORITE HERE|pg||
nt|othered1: There's a really wide range for leaping Michaels andnorth is trying for more.  South will bail out, I'd expect|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: any operatic singers to serve as the "fat lady"?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: my voice is broke these days|pg||
nt|othered1: especially since the 1@S cue almost has to be real and duplication.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: this is the ultimate zig when you should be zagging maneuver|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|bobh1: guess they can survive 5@h|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't see south's decision here any different from the last round's |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
