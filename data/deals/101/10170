nt|roswolf: nice start|pg||
nt|m_niemi: tx kibs|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 9-12|pg||
nt|xenya: 10-12 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|pelu: 1.2.3 seat nv|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9½ - 11½|pg||
nt|xenya: a bit annoying for S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still was in principle right to lead trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: and E's @D8 could have suddenly become a big card, had he exited witha small @D at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi peter|pg||
nt|haans: lsome|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Bekkouche must hope that the double is negative; it usually is|pg||
nt|haans: easy really|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@HX will not be pretty|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems in use?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so strong 1@c, 5 card majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: south makes a responsive double?|pg||
nt|pelu: a responsiv D sh show 4-3 in major|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not this time Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe she can escape for 500|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ralf Willquist and Anders Sigsgaard|pg||
nt|asig: hi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello all|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D would work|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: fairly normal part score competitive auction|pg||
nt|asig: Ready for the football match tonight, Ralf?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@h not a lead directive:)|pg||
nt|haans: 1C full opening bid direct 1M 2m weak opening bid 1@D BIG CLIUB|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S perhaps?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pelu: 3@D or 3@S by N?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: canape auctions often end in 4-3 fits|pg||
nt|xenya: tough decision for W |pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed but a difficult hand|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C show only i have11-16 hcp|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: 2@S-ruffs - 2 'top-tricks" and the need 3 tricks on @H A Q J - not impossible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/  for the tournament website, nicely designed by Kari Patana|pg||
nt|xenya: EW can stop the 2 @S ruffs |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Click on Results, then Round 2, and hopefully you will get running scores|pg||
nt|pelu: ok lets say: @DA and @D to king, @Sruff and a smal @C - again close to 7 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Faroe Islands did very well when they drew 15-15 with Sweden in round 1 (open series)|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Good evening everybody|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no probs in 3d perhaps non vul east could have given one morem pushin clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: with her 5 card suit it would be unlikely to attract a double and may have pushed vul opps overboard|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kastan88: 1@H= 10...14, 4+ @H, unbal; 2NT = fit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: EW plays precision, 1@d can be void, 1NT = 13-15|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Another plus score for the Icelanders|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|cenglund:  Seems overoptimistic after partner's sign-off|pg||
nt|kastan88: GE Christer, you are far South from us :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: tough boards to analyze, not sure the best defense here|pg||
nt|kastan88: is that 2@H some 11..13 and 3-card fit in @S?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps heart leads |pg||
nt|xenya: generally you don't want to lead a singleton if you will have to ruff with your natural trump trick, but here EW can engineer 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|m_niemi: results so far: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/results.php|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is too optimistic by n/s imo|pg||
nt|m_niemi: -1 or -2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: Sweden defeated Estonia 25-5 in the women's, whereas Denmark lost 12-18 to Iceland|pg||
nt|xenya: close, yes -- but not quite maybe -- i think EW can get 2 trumps, 2@Ds, 2@Cs and a @S|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 3NT ?|pg||
nt|xenya: they should do that quickly however|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|pelu: diff to bid - and stop - after 3@C by East|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tjolpe:  can u bid it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 4c has play in any case|pg||
nt|asig: This hand should be over in a second - 10 easy tricks|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@d= 5+M+5+m, weak|pg||
nt|roswolf: a combined 22hcp and no long suit - i think it is clear that someone overbid|pg||
nt|pelu: @C to K and @HQ will give S an chance|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N thought S has Ms|pg||
nt|pelu: and a responsiv X sh show major|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but really this sort of bidding is not suitable for a high level tournament|pg||
nt|pelu: the 3@H bid from S is - as I see it - the problem - that is FG on 10 HCP|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4@d goes down too, 3@s is not fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but south paased originally - therefore north knows the values for game are not present|pg||
nt|m_niemi: with strong hand N can bid 4@c|pg||
nt|pelu: so N sh pass to 3@H - no|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so 3@d isn't that strong|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed peter but he should play bridge rather than slaveishly follow system|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: but pard (W) said she had zilch with the rais |pg||
nt|haans: gustavsson won swedish championships three years running. claimed he was lucky|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cenglund:  Heart lead would have been different story|pg||
nt|m_niemi: -1 if def makes an error in trumps|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cenglund:  Not really, I am staying in Finland for the moment|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: declarer is obliging -- back to 2 ruffs now|pg||
nt|xenya: i think he could have made it by playing a high @D|pg||
nt|pelu: just what I told him .)|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w should really find it easy to take at least 5 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
mc|12|nt|pelu: easy for us|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: Susie has all the secrets|pg||
mb|1S|nt|capercliff: could 5N really be a grand slam bid after 1N?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: don't ask me|pg||
mb|3N|mb|4C|nt|fabsayc: but i think if wolpert had heart ace, would have cued at some point, similarly with void|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hard to envisage 5NT as GSF|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|sharynr: should East return to 4@S now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: good plan if they let you do it|pg||

nt|sharynr: i type too slow|pg||
mb|6C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: and we end with a flat board - probably|pg||
nt|capercliff: there are many other ways he could have persued a grand slam on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this broadcast will continue all day, see bbo schedule for time|pg||
nt|capercliff: bye all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i might have tried 5@S with hannas hand, he can be sure 6@C is down|pg||

mb|1C|nt|lestergold: your biew Shirley is a sensible view but not quite aggressive enough if you'll forgive me|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Denmark lost to Iceland in round 1 - Sweden won 24-6 agasit Estonia (not Nordic but the 6. team!)|pg||
nt|kastan88: and after sign off 3@H from partner|pg||
nt|haans: only 2@H|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kastan88: time for game on EW-line, must be routine 3NT|pg||

nt|haans: not many other can invite and stop at 2|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@s= 11-16|pg||
nt|fabsayc: two weak spots, the 1@C can create problem, also the 1@D compared to precision|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: has east had a peak at south's cards no screens? long necks!!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: E selecting "let pard play" option |pg||
nt|lestergold: if west promises a weak 2 in amajor why doesnt east want to play in the guaranteed 8 or even 9 card fit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure |pg||
nt|lestergold: vulnerable for all she knows 4h is frigid|pg||
nt|asig: Christiansen on lead against 2@h in a moment|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: (11)12-14|pg||

mb|p|nt|asig: Better stay off his partner's suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the originator of big diamond systems of this general type was an american by the name of nail|pg||
nt|fabsayc: who played the "big diamond" in the 1960's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which of course we all played :)|pg||

pc|h8|nt|xenya: well it's 5-4-3-1 and 2 1/2 honour tricks|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Suggesting a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1NT = 13-15?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tjolpe:  so, what happened?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: i guess on a @s lead from E|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Mike Gold here hi Raif|pg||

nt|fabsayc: these days i would need a hall pass to open a strong 1 diamond in north america|pg||

nt|pelu: 1Nt = (11)12-14|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|haans: bjarnarson kicked sweden down|pg||
nt|haans: OR may bid at least 3@H|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I would play low from dummy:)|pg||

pc|h9|nt|talion: hi all|pg||

nt|cenglund:  Hi|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kastan88: but IMO East had to say 4@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: WELL THE SYSTEM WORKED TO PREVENT E/W FINDING THEIR DIAMOND FIT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: I mean am i MAD OR DREAMING ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: some IMPs to Denmark|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as the cards lie is @hQ a nice return|pg||
nt|roswolf: small  is the technical play - blocks the suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i dont understand the advantages of this method - it simply randomises who plays the contract and therefore will produce random swings on what should be flat boards|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: we can se, that @S4 would have won the game - best for sure @SK best chance|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Bob McPhee|pg||
nt|lestergold: with so many points what did she expect south to balance with- on a multi auction the [passout seat is not a balancing seat|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hi Bob@H@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: good day everyone|pg||
nt|kastan88: still i don't like such advantages, too much pressure to partner, and i am with you Mike, i would bid 2@H not passing, partner could have  6S3-1D3|pg||
nt|lestergold: the theory becomes different- in the pass out seat you are  in the trap in effect weven though east hasnt spoken|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H or 2@H|pg||
nt|haans: or pass|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4@h and 5@d were easy, or 3NT by N|pg||
nt|roswolf: yp|pg||

nt|haans: any opening is to advantage|pg||
nt|m_niemi: it's a swedish system:)|pg||

mb|1N|nt|kastan88: hmm I thought that was Lebensohl too|pg||
nt|talion: 1@c = 15+ any|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: yes my vote 2 (just)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: South has the option to sit for it or to escape by showing both majors|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Precision or some other strong club opening, I presume|pg||
nt|talion: skuladotti is tempted to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Bob|pg||
nt|haans: must be transfer|pg||
nt|m_niemi: but do they play it in Sweden?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2@H by N might even make?|pg||
nt|xenya: or W might run?|pg||
nt|pelu: if S wont to run - the West can just sit and wait|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 boards compared now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the tables are not linked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: flat  3 and 5  to Sweden|pg||
nt|pelu: so 1-1 now|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in the other room Finns have 12-14 1NT|pg||
nt|haans: not really popular|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Auken perhaps hoping pard is strong enuf to double again|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might end up in a thin slam but very anti - odds|pg||
nt|m_niemi: like Greek gift?|pg||
nt|haans: very few play magic|pg||
mb|d|nt|m_niemi: so still 0-1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @s-lead was nice|pg||
mb|4D|nt|cenglund:  3NT is piece of cake|pg||
nt|lestergold: but doesnt want to push south out of spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm ok but the system has to deliver in constructive auctions - most international pairs know how to defend against such systems especially in major championships|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: the no science route|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so ½-1|pg||
nt|roswolf: on a good day n/s would bid 6@S and it would roll home but today best keep low|pg||
nt|haans: yes that why Magic|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kastan88: Hi Bob, |pg||
nt|mcphee: just getting an idea whats being played|pg||
nt|haans: no double = good bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D = negavtiv, 1@H = nat or 20+|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: should make plenty |pg||
nt|mcphee: these sort of hands really offer little play choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: cant agree with the 3nt call - why cant 6@D be frigid |pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: magic is allowed passing with strong hand forbidden|pg||
pc|dK|nt|talion: yes it is, but it could have been very poor contract if nurmi has minimum 15 points for her opening|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: declarer may get home if she plays on the black suits however playing on dims looks doomed|pg||
nt|mcphee: why|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @D Q is ok|pg||
nt|haans: may make|pg||
nt|haans: @HK a joker|pg||

nt|haans: all bids in magic is allowed|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|asig: It looks as if 9 tricks is the limit in hearts|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Provided that diamonds don't break 3-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: if you play strong club then use your system tools to investigate|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he would have to rebid 1@H forcing, if available|pg||

nt|m_niemi: @s4= @d-signal|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what discards are they using, lavinthal?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Roman|pg||

nt|lestergold: cant|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Now it's only about fighting for overtricks|pg||
nt|talion: now ahonen has double stopper in hearts. if danielsdot had lead high heart, then ahonen could have taken only one heart trick|pg||
nt|talion: but with no side entry, low heart lead seems reasonable|pg||
nt|asig: One loser in each suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence may put pressure when aqce and another club is played if north ducks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Perhaps E has a guess in @c|pg||
nt|m_niemi: odd= pos, even= lavinthal|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: roland very dissapoined about no slam here|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably right play by defence|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2NT-1 or -2 is cheap against 4@h|pg||

pc|c9|nt|lestergold: its not mps!|pg||

pc|hA|pc|d3|pg||
mc|5|nt|ralfwil: a small without hesitation...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well requires cool courage|pg||
nt|asig: maybe Christiansen should have tested spades first|pg||

nt|asig: then he would know that N had the @cK for his opening bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: much....|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is that east must ensure that there are enough spades to take care of the clubs should any mishaps aoccur |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Or @sK!|pg||
nt|asig: He would know, had he played spades first|pg||
nt|m_niemi: easy to defend now|pg||

nt|m_niemi: 30 imps in 3 boards so far|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S may be 3 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: the wonderful news for declarer is partner actually holds 4 trumps!|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would not sell out to 2c at this vulnerability as north i would bid 2h i have a couple of trciks and i can tolrate 2s if partner wants im not getting doubled|pg||
nt|asig: Maybe E led a diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: three spades|pg||
nt|haans: lucky he has more|pg||
mb|p|nt|talion: about 5-13 points if i remember correctly|pg||
nt|kastan88: mostly all systems are good, if player just thinks sometimes (not bids as robot) and has agreements with partner|pg||
nt|xenya: this might go down|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: 3N can be beaten on LOW @C lead -- impossible to find|pg||
nt|kastan88: on CC I think this is called Ekren, but 3rd hand and vuln must be little bit stronger, than usual 3...10 points|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is another example of inadequate fighting ofr the part score|pg||
nt|mcphee: sensible idea to me also Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i can see how this made|pg||
nt|asig: Win the ace, to rounds of trumps an another diamond|pg||

mb|p|nt|capercliff: interesting choice to bid 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may regret not playing 4@S|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4333 often plays at least a trick better in 4 of a major|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes 4@S an easier contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: neither is very good|pg||

nt|roswolf: another big @H fit for e/w|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|lestergold: in bridge you musttighten the screw up to the maximum but not brwak the bolt by overdoing it|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: creeping about cautiously will win nothing|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no trumps, no @h-ruff|pg||
mb|2S|mb|2N|nt|jakow: About 12-14hcp and 3+H|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: in 3. seat vuln: 1Nt = 15-17, so N had to open 1@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: with spades and dims both breaking 3/3 this should make|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pelu: easy 7 tricks - and a flat board|pg||
nt|xenya: we've got our first comparison -- let's hope it will continue|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie but imagine you were in club slam and recieved a heart lead - you would not be a very happer sapper|pg||
nt|mcphee: too bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: your only entry to dummy under attack immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets face it i think even roland would baulk at this slam|pg||
nt|mcphee: life can be mean, i have this E hand and partner opens slam is going to be hard to avoid:)|pg||
nt|asig: Yes, even if W finds an unlikely heart lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the lead helps|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: easy to duck and then only one club  trick for the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: what a horrible choice for east now|pg||
nt|haans: had been much harder to bid if sylvan first passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: i was once told by an international team captain in the southern hemisphere that he picked 1 pair playing an HUM system in all matches against what he thought were the weakest ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: teams and sat them out otherwise - the strategy worked the team won a medal|pg||

nt|lestergold: ionically a heart lead may have been threatening|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcphee: 4N simply does not do the hand any justice|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: 29 combined points without a grat trump fit why have you got to be in slam?|pg||
nt|sybarra: because it makes? |pg||
nt|sybarra: (just a joke)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||

nt|sybarra: 8 tricks if clubs are behaving |pg||
nt|mcphee: missing slam at imps is cowardly here|pg||

pc|d2|nt|cenglund:  Declarer should try to score dummy's spades by ruffing|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok would anyone pass throughout with the north hand - losing tactics to me|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: did Einarsson have time to mess around with that club|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The defence drew the longest straw|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mcphee: all true what you say, W has a complete minimum as well|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: it is a hand full of holes and hazards|pg||
nt|haans: nothing to it :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mcphee: and it still has good play|pg||
nt|sybarra: so if you are so interested in slam, perhaps 4 @c is better bid over 3 nt|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|capercliff: what to bid...|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|capercliff: 2@h is never enough these days|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: but they always bid 3nt|pg||
nt|capercliff: how does everyone feel about 3N?|pg||
nt|sharynr: Silver made 5@d on the second hand, for 8 imps|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: so i like to have a semblance of a side entry for 3 preempts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt is "normal"|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: on the bidding declarer probably should finess through N for @SJ to cater for a 4-1 break - which does not cost in this instance|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3@h does jam the auction nicely, you know if you double partner is bound to bid 4m|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|sharynr: but both bd 20 and 22 will swing the match the other way, i predict|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||

nt|haans: yes may not be HUM just natural but unusual|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kastan88: not easy for defence , as we saw|pg||
nt|xenya: a @D lead would have set 4@H, but how could W find it?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the "conservative" e/w pair here are winning imps nevertheless |pg||
nt|lestergold: i probabbly wouldnt wheelout the fourth suit just make a straight quantitative invite|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The Danes were in 5@S here after N-S competed to 5@C|pg||

nt|m_niemi: no 3@c by N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 5@S had the obvious two losers|pg||

nt|haans: a natural penalty double!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cenglund:  On good day you make slam, but this not that day|pg||
nt|mcphee: this response range places a lot of pressure, 2N as N kinda forced in case S has more and works poorly when S has a 6 count|pg||
nt|m_niemi: E has good shape, and no wasting values|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: 2@S or 3@H????????|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  They must strike it out|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: from "wrong" hand - 6NT making|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: he did, at some point|pg||
nt|jakow: Avery tricky 3NT to bid!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in 37 Finns made 4@h in open room, +11|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: well perhaps she was right to go up: it was the setting trick |pg||
nt|m_niemi: in 5 level many play that A denies K|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so declarer missguessed the @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H seems damp too surely a clear pass assuming double was penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  This board is no good for a strong club opening|pg||

nt|mcphee: here lebensohl is often used|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n the safe and obvious spot|pg||

nt|m_niemi: 2NT = good @s-raise?|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: another straightforward and therefore relatively boring hand|pg||
nt|haans: i do not know what 3@S show|pg||

mb|2S|nt|pelu: can EW find 6NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: I just bid 3N as N rather than dble|pg||
nt|lestergold: understandably north has made tyhesafest sensible bid|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, very awkward bidding problem for N |pg||
nt|haans: suprise passing???????|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@d = 0-7, 1@h = @h or bal?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cenglund:  Slam depends on the club finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: hand is too good to bid only 2n partner would pass with two many hads where 3n was laydown|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happesn this isnt one of them |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mcphee: best is to now cash @D A and see what takes place|pg||
nt|haans: spade lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: they know about controls - have they the tricks?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in other room sequence will be 1@s-3@s-?|pg||
nt|haans: N have 1 spade and @CA|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig: No problems here making 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: when east sees dummy hell be regretting the lead but sighing with relief when he find sthat declarer has a stiff club|pg||
nt|lestergold: this should make on the dim position|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|kastan88: but what else here to open, if 1@C means  all hands 15+? you can't open other way|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cenglund:  Slam is slightly over 50%, since Q singelton off-side makes as well|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@h = 20+, 2NT = raise with single, 3@c = ask, 3@d = single @c|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2NT = 4441, with black single|pg||
nt|haans: fair|pg||
pc|dT|nt|m_niemi: this is easy|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|pelu: from the West-hand 6NT sh be as good as 6@Cs (also in CR)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have thought east hand worth an upgrade to 1@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: well done Rimstedt and Sjöberg. Deserved swing|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, brilliantly bid|pg||

pc|cA|nt|lestergold: this not of coutrse a bad line if the trumps were breaking normally that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: would virtually guarantee the contract but declarer in for a nasty shock|pg||

nt|lestergold: iceland dont appear to be getting the breaks they need|pg||

nt|kastan88: bon appetite|pg||
nt|lestergold: she doesnt like the smelll of kippers but i love em|pg||
nt|mcphee: delivery, back when done|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S asked singel?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: this must be a kind of asking bid - west thought so !|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no need to use Blackwood|pg||
nt|haans: some change there|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: a different auction but the same landing spot|pg||
nt|m_niemi: kibs know better|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: old carrots is 40 years|pg||

nt|asig: have to go now, see you later|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @d A and @dK and crossruff|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|xenya: profitable save if he can get out for -3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|roswolf: this is a silly contract and clearly the system has a serious flaw|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: with the clubs both offside and the spade losers needing to be ruffed not laydown|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably get diamond right|pg||
nt|roswolf: trick 1 was interesting though|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N was too aggressive in this board|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I think it's just bad judgement|pg||
nt|m_niemi: against 8-11 that is not so great hand|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: S can get a @H ruff, but it's still 11 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: the lead gives a @H-ruff - but cost a @C-trick|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: at least i think that's Wolpert just said :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: on this type of auction clubs often the weakest suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if responder has club fit would tend to rebid 2@S not 2nt|pg||
nt|capercliff: Wolpert taking his time with this one|pg||
nt|capercliff: he will overtake and finesse I would think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some minor communication issues|pg||
nt|mcarroll: On a @C lead will succeed if the !Q is played, which is I think the correct technical play|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: now what?|pg||
nt|capercliff: bit of a surprise this, a @c from the east hand cant hurt him|pg||

nt|fabsayc: no promotion|pg||
nt|fabsayc: clashes with natural diamond trick|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  the @CK cost an extra undertrick|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I think Fins will not win the previous board|pg||
nt|fabsayc: mind you, 3nt was not cold|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be more competitive|pg||
nt|m_niemi: nice bidding by EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I agree, but they may reach 3NT in the other table, probably -1|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: oh well another tortured sequence likely|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@c denies M|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so 6@c or 5@c+4@d|pg||
nt|haans: five clubs no majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: but promises in hcp? 8-11?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: but only if N hold-up with @DK x!|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt a make whout @C lead :)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not a hand for getting too high on here|pg||
nt|haans: Results: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/results.php  for this match soon|pg||
nt|m_niemi: not -3 still|pg||
nt|roswolf: lebensohl 2nt now?|pg||
nt|pelu: the @D-fit makes 4@H - on small values - a good contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S now might prevent that|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|m_niemi: so tie is the best Fin can score|pg||
nt|pelu: but again - I dont like 1NT with a solid major 5 card suit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: East has good hand, double 3@s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass seems automatic|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have matti|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if w has 6 c m, there should be good spot for EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am not sure south has any legitmate other choice here - 4@S WONT MAKE OPPOSITE A PASSED PARD|pg||
nt|m_niemi: on @d lead 4@s makes|pg||
nt|pelu: but is the pause by S who or West |pg||
nt|pelu: for sure W will lead his singleton @C|pg||
nt|m_niemi: move @dK to @sK, how many tricks in @s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i assume screens are in use - in which case west may be considering bidding over 3@S|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@h=ms|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: S plays a @H, if W discards a@D, S cashes @DK and plays another @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: wel 6d looks v good|pg||
nt|pelu: both!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah both thinking!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: minors|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: 3@C must have been transfer 4@C natural|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@s = ASK|pg||
nt|m_niemi: tx Sue|pg||
nt|haans: were they on the winning team last nordics?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: wow aggressive!! both of them|pg||
nt|lestergold: and lucky no double|pg||
nt|mcphee: not a hopeless spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: a horrible contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: may even make it|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course every finesse in sight works|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: will require a defence worthy of that aginst the israelie raid on entebbe|pg||
nt|lestergold: and yes it may happen|pg||
nt|pelu: ok -100 against 140 :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D is just too undisciplined for me pard did bid 1nt and so has defence|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S is a super accept but W is not interested|pg||
nt|lestergold: but plenty of play even on a less favouravle layout|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As the cards lie  - yes, but 2 of 3 finesses is needed|pg||
nt|lestergold: its better than that Raif|pg||
nt|lestergold: because played bu south with the spade protected the fourth heart will take care of possibloe spade loser so whenever club finesse is right its a very good contract and has chances ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: when clubs finess is wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a roland mandatory and porbably in the region of upwards of 50% in any case|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@c = 16+, 1@d = 0-7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: clubs ruff beat it|pg||
pc|s5|nt|m_niemi: 3@h= 3cards|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: her 2N was just a further transfer|pg||
nt|pelu: S need to take the @C-trick in on @HA|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|lestergold: plus all the possible helpful leads too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But @d in on N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4 is makeable, though maybe double dummy|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: the standing it 30-0 + board 20 where Denmark can loose many IMPs|pg||
nt|roswolf: always seems to me that their last bid is a punt|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cenglund:  3NT would have been cold, but this is more difficult, but should make on good play|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like a very resonable spot to this bozo|pg||
nt|haans: suprise|pg||
nt|kaapo: Score updates from the women's at http://www.bridgefinland.com/NM2009/res/bmsc.php|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cenglund:  Heart suit is blocked now|pg||
nt|pelu: @C now!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @h7 = suit pref to @s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: could well be|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will do the right thing i am sure|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N should have led a high @s|pg||
nt|m_niemi: from that bad suit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S has a real problem|pg||
nt|roswolf: he certainly hasnt been helped by his pard|pg||
nt|pelu: N coudn't help here - only tell that he has 3-card @H|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I don't think that S needs N's count in @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be a suit preference situation|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in 43 Finns in 3Nt in the other room as I predicted|pg||
nt|pelu: so another 6 IMPs for Finland|pg||
nt|m_niemi: not made yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: the more he thinks the more likely he is to get it wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: "all" way lead to 9 trivcks :(|pg||
nt|pelu: @CK - come on Gregers :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 9 tricks => :) not :(|pg||

pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: on a @c lead the slam is cold|pg||

nt|lestergold: now Bob stop compimenting urself|pg||

pc|d9|nt|m_niemi: wish to hear how he decided to play @c|pg||
nt|m_niemi: claim|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|pelu: the count in @H = declayers ditribution - West is favorit to 7 card @D = 2-3-7-1|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: cards are lying very badly for decalrer -- likely -2|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do against weak defender|pg||
nt|mcphee: vul I think it is imperative you reach game|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: but its absoutely a dreadful contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: well 4-1 trumps makes it hard|pg||
nt|lestergold: favourable spade position dims 3/3 fav lead etc|pg||
nt|lestergold: and still work to do|pg||
nt|mcphee: even with a @C lead this is not so horrid, 3-3 @D comes in as well|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cenglund:  Oops!|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a poor 4/4 trump fit misfitting side suit combs and a shotage f high card points- its a part score hand|pg||
pc|dT|pg||

nt|roswolf: which is what he has!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@d= non forcing|pg||
nt|roswolf: REALLY NON -FORCING - MAMA MIA|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|pelu: ok last board :) - I hope that the connections will be better in next round|pg||
nt|cenglund:  They missed a cold game in hearts|pg||

nt|m_niemi: 3NT by S|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|mcphee: although 3@H is aggressive, if the S hands values are outside of @S it is not so bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but sometimes opps preempt you or if south expectsb pard to show 4 hts however minimum she is then she did not have here 4h raise you cant have it both ways|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mcphee: and to reach a close game vul at imps is good|pg||
nt|lestergold: desperation pushin i suppose|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might consider axing this|pg||
nt|pelu: no not in IMP - prob down 1 = 100/530|pg||
nt|m_niemi: will EW score their 3 @s tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcphee: S should not pass 2@S out in any case, and will dble again and now N should be considering 4@H anyway|pg||

pc|hA|nt|roswolf: amazing that south isnt contemplating a grand with all those controls|pg||
pc|h2|nt|m_niemi: 2@s would have been very minimum raise|pg||

nt|cenglund:  Another good board for the Finns|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||

nt|roswolf: if you cant bid 6@D here then you really should change your methods|pg||
pc|hT|nt|haans: decl will have to fight for it|pg||
nt|m_niemi: E should have bid once more with 4th trump|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: even with the wasted Ks as a value this 4h is a much better contract thatn the last one for n/s|pg||

pc|c3|nt|m_niemi: 10 tricks possible|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: but why save if you think it might be going off|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kastan88: this 1@C= 16+ unbal or 15+= bal, thats why stopped in 2NT only|pg||
nt|xenya: 1N would be more comfortable here|pg||
nt|kastan88: their 1NT=12...14|pg||
nt|kastan88: and of course good afternoon Martin :)|pg||
nt|xenya: seems he needs to take the right view in @Cs to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well he will have to find the club jack just to make|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Martin|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: Now its time for me to thank you all for watching. welcome back  tomorrow (Sunday) we broadcasts:  (Paris/Stockholm time)   09:00, 12:15, 15:00|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a push|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: wrong...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4@s-2 = 200 in the open room in "5@d" deal, 7 to Denmark|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mcphee: it is a hard spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w get the mps again|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: 5d is only a spade pip short of making!|pg||
nt|lestergold: swop 7 and 9 of spades an 5 is frigid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this was not the best return|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: of course imps not so many |pg||
nt|lestergold: oh more now a spade trick has been binned|pg||
nt|haans: Results: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/results.php |pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: at mps it is abetter proposiotn to save|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mcphee: however if 4@D is weak, the E hand has ZERO defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: match points off the scale to get away with one down|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S knew N has max 2@h so easy duck|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
pc|sT|nt|haans: we have a delay now|pg||
nt|m_niemi: looks like +1 to Fin|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: the low diamond exit by koistinen has destroyed communication and squeezes|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|capercliff: he stole his rebid|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|mcarroll: Inverted minor raise presumably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: one of the surer applictions of the rabbi rule here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 6@D is still on a guess if no spade lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: wonder if 2@d was GF or not|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|capercliff: 61d is cold|pg||
nt|capercliff: @d|pg||
nt|capercliff: and bid in the open room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not the lead direct double just helped opponents on this board|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: note|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: cunning play but should not work|pg||
pc|h6|nt|capercliff: huh?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: signing off, but this could be less safe than slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can be missing two aces|pg||
nt|capercliff: 5@s was a relay to play in 5N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so blackwood was not the right tool|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure what is however|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fabsayc: one does not get 12 card fits that often|pg||
nt|capercliff: slam is 50/50 at best anyway|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|capercliff: happens to be the right side of 50 this time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better than 50-50|pg||
nt|capercliff: you dont have time to try both finesses Martin:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: usually the defense will yield many clues to the best line|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: they have to guard clubs also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: plus no spade lead, i would expect a lot of clues|pg||

nt|mcphee: and the K@H is not worth a hill of beans|pg||
nt|lestergold: and east eosnt knwo what west has|pg||
nt|mcphee: not a W hand problem in my view|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back. Let's keep our fingers crossed. The operators have a very poor connection|pg||
nt|lestergold: you rarely find that people fins saves of 1100 against 143o vul slams|pg||
nt|mcphee: no brainer to save at these colors|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I had tried a X as S|pg||

nt|fabsayc: koistinen timid?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N aqqressive at the last moment|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|pelu: Long way up to Finland :)|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 2@H - I cant :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandra Rimstedt and Emma Sjöberg are still juniors I believe. Early 20's? Someone in the audience may be able to message me|pg||
nt|haans: I its time for me to thank Matti Niemi and Goeffrey Wolfarth Ybarra my  co-commentator and you all for watching. Welcome back an other day. Hope you have enjoyed the show.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Sandra 22, Emma 24|pg||
nt|ralfwil: last board and rather few IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: again - can u defeat 2@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Anni and she is having a hard time. Please bear with her|pg||
nt|xenya: i think you can -- cash 4 @Hs, @SA and exit with a small @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's very frustrating when the connection is poor. You can press all the keys you like and things won't happen until after 30-60 seconds|pg||
nt|pelu: best chance is a small @D - that will block the entry to dymmy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are stuck again I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|pelu: Vladimir - I take @D 10 discard 2@Cs ruff a @S and N is squeezed|pg||
nt|xenya: yes that's true -- you need to play a small @D early|pg||
nt|pelu: are we still waiting for the lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty hans|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: makes a lot more sense over artificial 1@C than natural 1@S to preempt|pg||
nt|cenglund:  After all that fruitful chickening Koistinen had to break the line|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2+2+3+2=9, any problems?|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Not really, but declarer doesn't know the location of the K|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Furthermore, diamonds may be 4-1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 36 imps = 23-7|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The Finns have played very well in both tables|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if 16 boards...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 15 boards/match now|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 10 more to Fin, Salomaa run 4 rounds of @h to make 4@s with 6-1 fit|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The only snag on Finnish scoreboard is 3NT -1 on this board|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in the other room was @s lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: has declarer gone to sleep here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed 3nt was makeable even after spade lead|pg||
nt|m_niemi: declarer ducked 2nd @d, so spades were cleared, -1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: dec played S to have @dQJxx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same potential problem here|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I wonder how they managed to go down in the open room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still he cant make till he plays to trick 1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade, spade, diamond, diamond to jack, and spade|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: in mps there is a lot more to gain at imps you may save a few but what a disaster if you make a big sac and they cant make|pg||
nt|lestergold: a phantom at this level |pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: NS will bid game here -- 3N or 4@H?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Not a very good decision|pg||
pc|sK|nt|m_niemi: 17 imps is 19-11 to Finland|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: another battle of communications and not helping declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: well 4@H looks hopeless, but this has a practical chance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually i cant see a defense|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be a push|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm will north find the killing lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: restart scheduled in 58 mins time|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so no second club trick and no way to make|pg||
nt|m_niemi: board 46 probably 6 imps to Den.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: but there it seems overtaking for spade lead is best for defense|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3@d the contract in open room|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: unlucky 3n|pg||
nt|lestergold: but flat|pg||
nt|kastan88: this is last brd, ty all and cu evening again|pg||
nt|mcphee: needed to play 4@S|pg||
nt|m_niemi: at least 10 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: but will it be enough for sweden|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed 12 or 13 to Sweden|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c7|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @c had given a chance|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h3|nt|lestergold: yes not easy bidding competition hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|m_niemi: even +1 with endplay|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 11 imps 17-13|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now can actually make an overtrick|pg||
pc|s2|mc|10|pg||
qx|c32|st||md|2SQ6HA7643DJ9CKJ95,ST43HJ85DKT64CT82,S75HQT9D87532CA76,SAKJ982HK2DAQCQ43|sv|e|nt|fabsayc: yes we play step responses, 1h advance can be 0 points|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: Hi Susie: )|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|susieq: hi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently he guessed wrong, down 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|capercliff: strong @c systems always work well with those hands, can always play in 1N|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is not a strong club system|pg||
nt|capercliff: in the other room both players stretched and ended up in a bad game|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the exotic 2nt strikes again|pg||
mc|10|nt|caitlin: a reminder that Canadian Bridge Federation, CNTC trials : http://www.cbf.ca/BWeek/index.html|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually 2nt is pretty normal these days with east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Thanks all, we will resume in a few hours.  Check the schedule for the time in your area|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: closing now|pg||
nt|caitlin: the Carruthers team has represented Canada in past but lost finals in trials last year|pg||
