nt|Vugraphu5: ok, N/S playing a canape-oriented strong club system|pg||
nt|joest: They used to play an incredibly complicated (and effective) relay club system of their own|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: E/W playing 2/1 with transfers over their natural club opening|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: For the EW CC: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=421&pid=552|pg||
nt|joest: Back in the 70's Granovetter and Rubin would routinely score in the 90s on the Bridge World Challenge the Champs feature|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT rolls in here on any lead|pg||
nt|joest: they won about nine or tenmonths in a row|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: For NS's CC: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=575&pid=261|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3NT is pretty much cold here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@c 1@s 2@h 2@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: I thought that was Rubin-Becker|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You give up a club while preserving the entry to dummy and come out with 4 clubs, 2 diamonds, 2 hearts and 1 spade (at least)|pg||
nt|joest: you know you might be right!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Granovetter/Rubin/Ginsberg/Becker were the Ultimate Club players|pg||
nt|joest: i think you are as a matter of fact :)|pg||
mb|1C!|an|strong|nt|mtvesuvius: I wasn't around then, Jack, so I wouldn't know :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: yes Ultimate Club was the system|pg||
nt|joest: not your fault|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: neither was i for that matter|pg||
nt|joest: obviously Boyd-Robinson don't have exalted standards to come in over a strong club at favorable|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: but the back of the book says, "playing your favorite system, what would you bid with these cards? etc."|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C!|an|stayman|nt|joest: i don't have the book|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Pays to get in fast in these auctions, especially at this Vul.|pg||
nt|joest: i knew I couldn't learn all that stuff|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|an|none|nt|joest: a straightforward reopening of 2NT rather than fooling around with double|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: He knows his partner didn't have a penalty pass, so he can bid 2NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: 2N is probably the 3rd range NT (double or 1N with the min/2nd)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|joest: Boyd trying to hit partner|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|mtvesuvius: and he has, but if won't really matter|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but it* :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: And it would obviously be impossible to get to 4@H if you opened 1@H|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: So that gadget does wonders|pg||
nt|joest: on a trump lead you might even need to double hook spades|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Somehow the other table miraculously reached 4@h by beginning with 1@h... Although this convention certainly made it much easier|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: but at the other table you'd dump the @sQ on the table now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: You might even be able to reach slam if you open 1@H and show your singleton diamond over a 2NT response|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here they had no chance because opener showed two suits when he opened|pg||
nt|joest: the advantage of Flannery isn't when you open it|pg||
nt|joest: it's when you dont|pg||
pc|d5|nt|joest: your partner doesn't need to respond 1@s on four|pg||
nt|joest: unless they are four good ones|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: That's true, but I can get by bidding 1@s on 4 small|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Hi Les :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The man behind the Bart convention among other useful gadgets|pg||
mb|1D!|an|could be canape|mb|p|nt|themick: Hello there Adam :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Granovetter's 1@d includes Canape type hands also|pg||
mb|1H|an|natural, non-GF|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Bart.html|pg||
nt|joest: Boyd passed?|pg||
mb|d|nt|mtvesuvius: 4@s is being played here in the CR|pg||
nt|joest: needs favorable spades is all|pg||
nt|themick: good way to find the 3-3|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Rubin's 1@h showed Invitational or worse values with 3+@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pam Granovetter thinks Rubin has to respond 1@H with that hand; no other bid available in their methods|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mtvesuvius: This is the reason why support doubles were invented|pg||
nt|joest: Robinson upgrading a bit.  That will land them in game|pg||
nt|themick: think robinson usually plays this is 4 card raise, but perhaps they are not treating 2D (3 cd raise) as a cue bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Stan Schenker|pg||
nt|joest: hi Stan|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: hi Stan :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|themick: hi Stan|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sssvablue: Hi Adam, Joe, Les |pg||
nt|joest: 2@h might just have been a 'sound raise' in some structures but I would have expected an alert if so|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This is one of the problems that making 1@h as 3+ gives your opponents|pg||
nt|sssvablue: How now Ron?|pg||
nt|joest: players who play transfer advances use that method and raise to two on real dreck|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: I'm assuming 3@c in the other room was weak with both minors|pg||
nt|themick: 2NT minors might be useful here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mtvesuvius: Such as last set, where Wildavsky passed Doug's "cuebid" thinking it was natural|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Vugraphu5: there was actually talk about an appeal on that board|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: well judged by e-w, at least on this layout :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Nice treatment to have for 2NT = Minors|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and Robinson will gain another 4 IMPs probably here|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Peter is probably wondering whether he should have bid 4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|themick: or five imps|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, like I said earlier, my keyboard hates me :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|joest: Rubin has shown three suits so Boyd may be working out how to protect against QJxx with north|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: spade to the ten is safest here, but impossible, because that would give Rubin 4-4 in the majors. So likely a spade to the king|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mtvesuvius: Spade to the King also works when a stiff honor in South|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: However best to return to his hand and run the T@S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|joest: yes except that you have to give up your club ruff|pg||
nt|joest: well if he wasn't running it before, he's running it now :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: In reality he doesn't want a stiff honor though... Since it would mean they were underbid|pg||
nt|themick: seems like spade to king first would be fine on all layouts, no ?|pg||
nt|sssvablue: I think Peter is trying to find the safest play for 3, he is rooting for 31 or 40 spades|pg||
nt|joest: seems that way to me too Les|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Is that true, this line looks like he is setting up for trump coup when spades 40 by eloping small trumps|pg||

nt|Vugraphu5: double was indeed support|pg||
nt|joest: interesting auction in the other room|pg||
nt|joest: when east rebid 2@s over 2@h, west just bid game.   |pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: with many pairs 2@s is a default bid and wouldn't even show five good ones|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: True, but I think 2@s showed a @s 1 suiter... I'm not sure...|pg||
nt|joest: but getting to 4@s is an excellent result don't get me wrong :)|pg||
nt|themick: too bad Robinson s minor s aren t interchanged as they could then have a Bart auction :)|pg||

nt|joest: yeah but you don't want to be in 6@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|sssvablue: Problem with bidding 6@d on this layout is you win 10 this time and loses another 50 trying to duplicate it|pg||

nt|reisig: Isn't that the goal?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think so... It basically shows 3=1=4=5 or 3=1=5=4 I think...|pg||
nt|joest: of course if you're thinking over the signoff then I guess I'm missing the point of 4@c|pg||
nt|sssvablue: And now that he has asked partner to decide, he thinks if partner was right?|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Or is it simply his turn to hesitate :)|pg||
nt|joest: this is a reasonable game that depends on the spade king (although maybe a bit more honestly)|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: A good rule is that if there is someone at the table thinking, it's usually Granovetter :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Ouch, someone was caught speeding|pg||
nt|joest: this could easily be a push though|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If 3NT makes, how much do you have against 3@HX I wonder|pg||
nt|joest: what if your partner has some random 12 count with a doubleton heart?  You cna't be SURE, he is reopening for you at the four level|pg||

nt|joest: huge risk |pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: How can it go all pass?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If that is an option, you'd better dump negative doubles|pg||
nt|joest: if partner has xx in hearts it could |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No way|pg||
nt|vugraphu5: especially playing a strong club, so the BIG hand is out|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Are you reopening with Jxx xx AQJx Axxx, Roland?|pg||
nt|joest: and if partner has opened 1@d on a weak NT hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jack, you are saying that trap passes don't exist because you risk that partner passes|pg||
nt|joest: i think partner RATES to be short and will PROBABLY reopen but there is no guarantee|pg||
nt|joest: i'm saying at the three level partner doesn't reopen 100% of the time |pg||
nt|Walddk2: How many hearts do you think partner has when you have 4 and RHO pre-empted at the 3-level?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1 or 2|pg||
nt|joest: 0, 1 or 2|pg||
nt|joest: possibly 3 against a maniac :)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
