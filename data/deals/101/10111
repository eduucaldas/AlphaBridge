mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: seems to be able to make quite a few @cs in NS|pg||
nt|tylere: yes..but if it's bid it probably has to be by south, and south is happy in 2@S|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: and EW might find the better @d contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: unusual lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: if this goes down 1 another IMP to ew|pg||
nt|tylere: the top+bottom two suiter problem again...in a couple of partnerships I've played various ways of showing that combo, just to avoid this problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: N should be short in @s, thus unbalanced with @cs|pg||

nt|vugraphu4: a lot of wxplaining going on|pg||
