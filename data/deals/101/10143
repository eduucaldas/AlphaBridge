pc|dJ|nt|Vugraphu6: A spade lead might have caused some problems|pg||

mb|3S|nt|daman: I wouldn't|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: will we see a double?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  North might bid 3N?|pg||
nt|migry: no:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: chris thought about doubling the cold 4@h before with QJ9x of trumps. it was close|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N can make any lead|pg||
nt|daman: partner is still a passed hand  3NT would be a huge reach|pg||
nt|migry: he may try 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: they are vul, although you might get enough cash from double|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|migry: and pd may pull with an unsuitable hand - as N didn't bid 3NT at his 1st turn|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is one of those "tricks" and not points hands|pg||
nt|mariner1: does S really want to defend here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: looks like 300|pg||
nt|cherdano:  partner passed over 1@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: maybe only 100|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but then, I suppose South knows North knows he can be that weak for 1@S...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: maybe more if they lose control|pg||
nt|migry: i wonder why N didn't double 1@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: yeah, easily 500|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: on a diamond lead and trumps through|pg||
nt|cherdano:  diamond lead, spade back and three rounds of spades|pg||
nt|cherdano:  then another diamond when North gets in with one of his side kings|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: then he gets in with a club and plays a spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: if he plays a another diamond they can separate trumps|pg||
nt|cherdano:  oh another spade, that's better yes|pg||

nt|migry: that is always a good reason |pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: it might MAKE when 3@s makes|pg||
nt|daman: looks like EW play 3/5 always|pg||

nt|migry: 3@d|pg||
nt|cherdano:  curious - why didnt Welland bid 3@C?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  the typical hand for 2@D is a game-forcing one-suited hand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and he has four card support|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: it may be unclear whether 3@c directly would show values as in a normal reverse situation|pg||
