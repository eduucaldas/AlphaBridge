pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|plateos: Yes they were systematically in a bad place. Unfortunately from the Finnish point of view beating this needs concentration (decl cannot get out of dummy)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharynr: perhaps 2 rounds of @S to see it 10 drops...before playing a @C|pg||
nt|plateos: @h now gives declarer (atleast DD) chance by unblocking the 1H and then @d|pg||
nt|sharynr: Of course, easy to see that 2@C cashed followed by a @S exit will lock declarer in dummy|pg||
