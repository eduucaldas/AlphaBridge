nt|debrose: The opponents may just give it to him|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: teammates usually don't complain|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: but they were curious about that board and Walter apologized for down in 3NT|pg||
nt|debrose: there are some teammates who will never ask what happened when there is a bad result, so it could go undiscovered for a while without vugraph|pg||
nt|debrose: and there are some people who never look at hand records|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Debbie and I have been in a similar position,  do you remember the ruling?|pg||
nt|debrose: Once in a European Mixed Team championship, my teammates were minus 990, with the opponents bidding and making a routine 6N|pg||
nt|debrose: We were plus 140 in a routine partscore at my table|pg||
nt|debrose: Nobody said a word.  Eventually someone looked at the hand record and discovered we hadn't played the same board|pg||
nt|debrose: The result was of course canceled and a subsitute board played|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Simson went to check with opps to see if okay to reverse 3N|pg||
nt|debrose: Yes, JoAnna I remember.  In the women's trials there was a claim accepted by the defense because declarer made a similar faulty assumption to Walter's|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I will stay here and hopefully report on what they say|pg||
nt|debrose: By the time she looked at the hand record, it was deemed to be past the score correction period|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: If I remember, Debbie,  the correction period expired?  or was it the table "result" stood?|pg||
