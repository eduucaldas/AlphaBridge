mb|2D|an|alerted|mb|3C|nt|gavin: this may not be beatable , 5D|pg||
nt|daman: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|barnets: morning all|pg||
nt|daman: the finals of the USBC    can it get any better?|pg||
nt|barnets: this is the final to find US 1 in the world championships in brasil|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gavin: north was afraid to make a takeout double of 4S, and felt he was too good to pass decided to bid 4NT takeout for the minors|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ok, Welcome back here, I think 5@d was the final contract?|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi everyone|pg||
nt|barnets: with no @D ruff n/s can make 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: hi cindy|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Ben Thompson and Martin Garvey|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: it looks down 1, but i dont think so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Barnet, George and William|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: yesterday nickell came back from more than 100 imps down to lose by 6 imps|pg||
nt|barnets: hi |pg||
nt|thegarve:  Evening all|pg||
nt|benjent: Hi everyone|pg||
pc|sA|nt|thegarve:  Been a loong time since I last saw you Ben|pg||
nt|benjent: Yes, Melbourne 15-20 years ago I think|pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt was a nice spot|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps north should just bid 2nt over 2@D|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Barnet   Hi William|pg||
nt|athene: but double certainly didn't look wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Arline Fulton. Good luck!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cindy:  does 4@s surprise you ?|pg||
nt|barnets: north chose not to open 2S but caught up later|pg||
nt|cindy:  no    i didnt see the double :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|joest: meckwell out for blood clearly|pg||
nt|gavin: maybe on king of hearts low heart ruff|pg||
nt|daman: they bypassed their best game|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: well, this will make|pg||
nt|athene: @DA right and spade takes care of the heart|pg||
pc|s6|nt|barnets: so a little lucky|pg||
nt|barnets: trumps 2-2 and no ruff|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|gavin: and out a club it might be down|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mtvesuvius: That will do it for 5@d now|pg||
nt|imp_jan: this will do the job as well|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Now declarer has to lose 1@h and 1@s still|pg||
nt|gavin: i guess there arent enough trumps in dummy to fly ace of spades and ruff clubs in dummy and endplay east with the king of spades|pg||
nt|gavin: if it was kqx of clubs with west it would be possible|pg||
nt|mildredb: Rodwell finds the shift - good start for them|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Right, 5@d isn't a bad spot|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hamman is playing 3NT in the OR|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 47 imps over 15 brds|pg||
nt|mildredb: by north?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, with a @c lead I think|pg||
nt|barnets: hi there all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Barnet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: also welcome to Ira Chorush|pg||
nt|barnets: hi roland|pg||

nt|thegarve:  been to Oz twice i must have been about 10 years ago|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Both pairs here play precision, NS play a canape type precision with some Relays I believe, and EW play their appropriately named "R-M" precision|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: It is 5Dx|pg||
nt|mildredb: i think he will just get out @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: It is 5DX|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|athene: that will speed things up|pg||
nt|benjent: Convenient access to systems at the tournament web site http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&task=list&event=14|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chorush: West has found a great lead but decarer has too many weapons|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: There is a minor typo in North's name|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: it's Ekeblad|pg||
nt|mildredb: Am told that Ekelblad & Weichsel play more relays than natural bids|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: thats for sure :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: give me correct spelling please.\|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps 3@C from East|pg||
nt|barnets: in the other room north opened 2@S and all passed|pg||
nt|benjent: Odd - the system sheet online says 2@d is a very weak 2 in a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: I did :) Ekeblad|pg||
nt|Walddk4: one  L  too many|pg||
nt|athene: not ideal - too good a dummy for hearts, for one thing|pg||
nt|daman: as much as Kit likes Flannery..not happening with that collection|pg||
nt|barnets: with cards lying well n/s should make 5@S here|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S is very good but might be missed|pg||
nt|athene: unlikely though|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D 1@H 1@S 2@S pass is possible|pg||
nt|athene: or 1@D (2@C overcall) X now north just bids 2@S and south passes - but again unlikely|pg||
nt|barnets: i would bid 3@S with south|pg||
nt|barnets: robnson up by 28|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: i would bid 3@H|pg||
mb|1N|an|15-17|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: We have new players|pg||
nt|Walddk4: East is  Weichsel|pg||
nt|thegarve:  anda new system I guess|pg||
mb|2C|an|PUPPET|nt|mtvesuvius: Weichsel saw no reason to reopen with his @c length... Although they missed a good @d fit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: having problem with computer.|pg||
nt|barnets: pass is the winner|pg||
nt|cindy:  think he can find that ?   i doubt it|pg||
nt|barnets: i would at match points for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: slam here on light values|pg||
nt|chorush: with everything friendly 6 H can be made but it is very doubtful it will be bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: in the other room they will likely raise to 2D with north hand and east will maek a responsive double (assuming they overcall 2C)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|daman: South should raise a 2@S bid|pg||
nt|athene: north will bid 3@S now surely|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes at MP it would be ok|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi Ed|pg||
nt|barnets: hi|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|cindy:  high enough guys|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@C only down1|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S down 2x|pg||
nt|cindy:  yeh and it will be doubled |pg||
nt|othered1: This particular responsive double is popular, but does it get good results?|pg||
nt|barnets: east spade suit alot to be desired|pg||
nt|barnets: some would not have overcalled|pg||
nt|cindy:  well W should know E can be this bad and they are white|pg||
nt|barnets: wests doubletin heart is a big - in any contract looks like 2 losers|pg||
nt|barnets: minus|pg||
nt|cindy:  i would be happy that i have five clubs and just pass|pg||
nt|barnets: you would be right|pg||
nt|barnets: if west bids he may bid 4@H choice of games|pg||
nt|benjent: Ah - and for Weichsel-Ekeblad, 2@d is 5@h, 4@d and 10-15|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|daman: one would think|pg||
nt|athene: he can't have a much better hand, can he?|pg||
nt|daman: overly cautious|pg||
nt|barnets: ona trump lead declarer can set up the fifth diamond for his 12th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: jan - the movie seems "backwards"|pg||
nt|barnets: dbl fro west of 3D shows a sing|pg||
nt|chorush: Looks like Fleisher's dbl must have shown diamond shortness; this would be the reason Kamil is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: my bad|pg||
nt|benjent: that's 5+@h and 4+@d|pg||
nt|thegarve:  ifso 2NT is now inv both Majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|daman: partner has known @C shortness|pg||
nt|athene: time for 4@S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  no double   thats good|pg||
nt|chorush: Note Wildavsky's insertion of 3 diamonds at fav vul to make sure no slams are accidentally bid that could be beaten with a dimaond lead|pg||
nt|barnets: this is very tough to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin: though thye might make a negative double with north |pg||
pc|d5|nt|barnets: and that is down 2 off the top|pg||
pc|d6|nt|barnets: well this is down to north|pg||
nt|athene: of course he might now be worried his partner doesn't have 4 spades? but surely, with 5+ hearts and NOT 4 spades, south would bid 2@H rather than double the first time|pg||
nt|daman: sad|pg||
nt|athene: i think the club bidding should have made it easier for NS, not harder|pg||
nt|chorush: If I saw the EW hands I would not want to be there after the bidding|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: playing strong club system 1@D is nebulous but the intervention helped define it and south could upgrade his singleton club|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Rodwell had to guess the @h to make I think|pg||
nt|gavin: so north south can make 3D, ew can make about 3S|pg||
nt|gavin: west guessed hearts incorrectly because of the opening bid |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: NS's System Summary: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=418&pid=301|pg||
nt|gavin: he needed to try to get to dummy by setting up a heart entry|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: EW's System Summary: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=424&pid=210|pg||
nt|gavin: now he is entryless|pg||
nt|thegarve:  has a pass of 2NT really|pg||
nt|benjent: Especially when partner has a singleton @c|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|barnets: because you dont think the long diamond will set up|pg||
nt|thegarve:  a few cards lie nicely, but not the @s suit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|benjent: He can play this for a while - @h 3-3 with the K onside, @cJ onside|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|benjent: maybe he can generate an endplay for the 9th|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|daman: south did upgrade his singleton @C   commited the partnership to at least the 3 level but didn't want to hang partner|pg||
nt|benjent: I think he'll need to get a @c truick in now|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Correct, although the Q@S could become an entry|pg||
nt|gavin: will likely play spade to the T now|pg||
nt|gavin: trying to create an entry in spades|pg||
nt|gavin: south is marked with both the ace of spades and the KC|pg||
nt|mildredb: @S to T is only way to build an entry|pg||
nt|gavin: and would have opened 1NT with the Jack of spades|pg||
nt|gavin: so the hand sort of double dummy|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, NS's NT range is a good 14 - 17|pg||
nt|barnets: declarer has 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|daman: but, Fred was a 4th seat opener so South should take a shot|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chorush: yes, nor would I think that I could safely take 3 rufffs in the dummy, or get back to my hand safely since I would think North has two or one diamond|pg||
nt|benjent: very awkward communciation-wise. He has to get the 2nd club trick now, but he doesn't want them to keep on playing clubs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gavin: duck is best here i guess|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Either way... It doesn't make too much difference|pg||
nt|gavin: if he wins he will do best to give declarer a ruff and a sluff|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: True, since Declarer cannot take it in hand|pg||
nt|gavin: ducking is simplest , he can see its going down|pg||
nt|mildredb: duck, or if wins give sluff/ruff - only 2 ways to beat it, I think|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|gavin: i guess all the same|pg||
nt|benjent: It's still a good day - East has the 9, so West is unlikely to continue clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to David Greenwood|pg||
nt|thegarve:  @h back to cut communications|pg||
nt|thegarve:  hi Dave where have you been?|pg||
nt|benjent: Yes, looks safest, and has an upside, so I think you're right on the money there Martin|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mtvesuvius: yes, since the ruff sluff is the fatal tap for declarer|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|thegarve:  often best defences come form killing the commuication suit|pg||
nt|benjent: Well well - going for @sK10 in partner's hand. Nice try, no luck|pg||
pc|d2|nt|benjent: Weichsel wasting no time killing communication with the long heart trick in dummy|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|gavin: sloppy|pg||
nt|mildredb: now makes|pg||
nt|gavin: he could easy have worked out that defense|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It's a but double dummy, although he should know most of the layout|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: The winner of this match after 120 boards will be USA1 in the Bermuda Bowl to be held in São Paulo, Brazil, in late August and early September. The loser will get another chance in ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: the USA2 bracket  |pg||
nt|barnets: so south maybe did well to put e/w off bidding slam|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|gavin: easily|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|h6|pc|c6|pg||

nt|athene: kills EW and their 5@D contract|pg||
nt|benjent: Stewart's shooting for the endplay, but wound up donating an extra trick to the cause. C'est la vie|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|chorush: The slam is probably slightly better than 50% against silent opponents so you may well be right Barnet|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: That should be a medium pickup for Nickell probably|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = nat or BAL, GF|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: i suppose east might double intending sort of "equal level conversion" maybe|pg||
nt|athene: but the 4-level is a bit high to go doing things like that|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  an easy 4@h and I suspect a flat board|pg||
nt|benjent: I guess Stewart read the opening lead as 3 small, rather than 4 small, and hence got the rest of the layout slightly wrong|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: trump switch right about now :)|pg||
nt|athene: although west might not actually mind declarer ruffing a diamond as it promotes his @SQ|pg||
nt|othered1: Note that south did not open a weak NT with a balanced 13.  Very Kaplan-Sheinwold oriented, as with the choice of 1@C>|pg||
nt|thegarve:  sry 7@d easy lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: it's likely that 1@D opening and 2@C rebid is not natural.|pg||

nt|cindy:  @dQ doesnt look good|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chorush: looks like a fast down 1 here, Game depended on picking up spades|pg||
nt|benjent: Ah - thanks Arline. In that case, I'm going to puzzle some more over why Stewart got the ending wrong|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mildredb: Nickell team needs to average 3 imps a board to win - |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|cindy:  telling himself what to lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: Now South is thinking, "he asked my minimum for keycards and I have 3"|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@C must show second round @H control|pg||
nt|cindy:  doubt they would have bid 4 without Adam's bid|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w has 3 @H losers and a trump|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mtvesuvius: It's a tough task, although it's certainly possible|pg||
nt|imp_jan: we have been there before|pg||
nt|gavin: from here rodwell will finesse the 8 of spades rather than diamonds for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|mildredb: yes, as said before, if any team can - it is this one|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess west doesn't use double here to contraindicate the lead|pg||
nt|barnets: for south to be thinking|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Quite bizarre only 15 % of audience watching the final, Meckwell and Zia get the specks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|barnets: so south thought 4@D could be rkc|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: Doub contends now that he could have cue-bid 2@h, then bid 3@c, then bid 4@d to keycards|pg||
nt|barnets: south showed 3 key cards|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: they bid 4@S in the OR on the same auction except North bid 3@S over 3@C|pg||
nt|othered1: and west also did not try a 2-suited bid immediately.|pg||
nt|chorush: Probably right Cindy|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|daman: on Bd 2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, the spade 8 is a nice card to have in dummy|pg||
nt|benjent: Ah - I think I see from the card (still on the last hand guys, sorry) - Ekeblad-Weichsel play MDU from 3 small, and that's what it lookied like to Stewart|pg||
pc|cA|nt|barnets: dec will attempt some kind of cross ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: probably a slow one|pg||
nt|othered1: Interesting contention by north -- I thought NS were major proponents of the "Keller" approach to partnership discussions at the table.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: Wildavsky can claim to not be the slowest player at the table|pg||
nt|othered1: In fact, didn't south write about Keller?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: although his side of the screen may be one of the slowest combos ever|pg||
nt|barnets: probably close|pg||
nt|barnets: dec thinks if he can ruff 3D in dummy he will make 5 or 6|pg||
nt|barnets: just slight complication that east has al the trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: but he @DK drops so all is well|pg||
nt|othered1: Ture, but by then, the @DK might have come down|pg||
nt|barnets: and should speed us up|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: hmm... That could set up all of Rodwell's @h now|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Costly signal|pg||
nt|gavin: same 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|gavin: though rodwell might look to avoid the spade finesse|pg||
nt|chorush: Fleisher will eventually start spades by leading the K from his hand, hoping for a singleton honor in south if they are not 2-2|pg||
nt|thegarve:  all about personalities and fun systems|pg||

mb|2H|nt|athene: well, west will have to bid the suit|pg||

nt|barnets: its not good but may make in practice|pg||
nt|athene: ten imps from board 2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: Undisciplined weak 2-bidders might open west's hand and east will get things high quickly|pg||
nt|othered1: Because of weak NT, north 2@H bid may be stronger than standard|pg||
nt|barnets: north has to lead or switch a trump aginst4@S but declarer can still make by no playing the@Ck on the first round|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Fleisher Team did superbly against Nickell 6/8 sessions and barely made it here, Robinson has played very well but had quite a few very lucky breaks so far so we will see....|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Kit might have tried a skewed 1NT opposite a passed hand|pg||

pc|hA|nt|othered1: north has a good hand, by definition and it wouldn't be beyond belief that game makes two ways|pg||
nt|chorush: Doub will do best to find a duck here; hard play|pg||

nt|gavin: look for rodwell to respond 1NT|pg||

mb|2H|nt|mtvesuvius: 1@s I would imagine :)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  or semi-natural?|pg||
nt|benjent: both pair playing a strong 1@c, but they diverge pretty quickly after that|pg||
mb|3H|an|alert|nt|othered1: Posted summary says 2@C is 6+@C or 5@S and 4@C|pg||
nt|chorush: Many pairs who play 2/1 would bid 3 diamonds with Kamil's hand. Had he done so, Doub would have found the duck of the club.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 4 spades to be expected|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: some danger in n/s getting too high here in hearts|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: ok, welcome back once again|pg||
nt|othered1: or 5+@S and 4+@C|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|barnets: played by west has chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: but not east|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I have to admit I might not open the North hand first seat red   but if you play a strong club system you are obligated to do so|pg||
nt|barnets: even 2 is too high|pg||
nt|daman: and this contract is doomed|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: 3@h shows short @h - 3 suiter|pg||
nt|mmmakela: short hearts FG my guess|pg||
nt|thegarve:  prefer transfers over 2M so that 3@D is more flexible|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: it's never very happy to open a weak hand and never mention the main reason you opened|pg||
nt|athene: which is AKQxx|pg||
nt|daman: :)   I agree|pg||
nt|barnets: south would have to switch the HJ to beat it after a spade lead|pg||

nt|benjent: Weichsel want to play low from dummy, but he's worried about a ruff on the way back...|pg||

nt|daman: this hand has potential|pg||
nt|barnets: well bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: I think he declined to ask for shortness and set spades with 3@s|pg||
nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: with AK AK there's no need to know|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Rodwell will probably open 1@s, let's see if they can stop before they get way too high|pg||
nt|barnets: with the DK in north dec could have gone for 3 discards on d lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Really no need?  |pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: less need. here East bid 3N which was some sort of moderate hand|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|gavin: lets see if meck makes an invitational 3H bid with this hand|pg||
nt|barnets: now this is a better slam than last almost 50 percent|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  I guess that many pairs haven't discussed enough about defending 3NT openers|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: now rodwell has to decide if his hands worth 4, very likely he will bid 4|pg||
nt|gavin: 4S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and 4 of anything is doomed|pg||
nt|benjent: Seems like EW have passed the Forquet test (say nothing when you drop a grand slam)|pg||
nt|benjent: What's your recommended auction, Martin?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: nice 6nt as the cards lie :)|pg||
nt|chorush: this would seem to be a partscore in diamonds |pg||
nt|thegarve:  X and over 4C, 5NT pick-a-slam|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|gavin: after a club lead this has no chance|pg||
nt|gavin: standout lead|pg||
nt|barnets: the play in the heart suit is to run the 9 on the first round|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D = GF with good @Hs I assume|pg||
nt|othered1: shapeless, mostly bodyless 16 (rebid is 15-17)  Go or not nonvul?|pg||
nt|barnets: robinson just put on 17 more imps|pg||
nt|barnets: 12 for the 5@Cx  and 5 when they stopped in 4@C when they were down in 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: so the margin is now 50|pg||
nt|othered1: They earned those imps|pg||
nt|barnets: the first time fleisher has been down that many in this championship|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and then @s switch could make this -2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gavin: he will rise up and play a heart|pg||
nt|gavin: but very likely to get hearts wrong |pg||
nt|athene: it looks like 2-way checkback|pg||
nt|daman: oh  ok|pg||
nt|athene: so 2@C over 1nt would be any invitational hand|pg||
nt|barnets: which picks up Qxxx onside|pg||
nt|athene: and 2@D is GF|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or 5@C|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: 2NT natural, denying 4 spades, 3 hearts or a 5-card minor|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mtvesuvius: right|pg||
nt|gavin: it benefits him too much to win the king of hearts, its his last hope of making the contract|pg||
nt|gavin: he would win the king of hearts, ruff a heart, finesse the 8 of spades for an extra dummy entry, ruff another heart|pg||
nt|gavin: hope for 3-3 hearts with a ducked A, and 2-2 spades w/ TS onside|pg||
nt|gavin: hey a guys gotta try|pg||
nt|mildredb: :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and if the T@S was on, along with 3-3 @h he would succeed|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Unfortunately that plan won't work for him|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Robinson is only up by 11 now in the other Semifinal match|pg||
nt|gavin: its unbelievable how these 120 board matches somehow manage to come down to the wire |pg||
nt|gavin: every time|pg||
nt|gavin: it seems like|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, there were only 2 or 3 that were complete slaughters|pg||
nt|daman: same minor forcing  smf|pg||
nt|daman: :)|pg||
nt|daman: 1@D is nebulous|pg||
nt|athene: yes 1@D is a non-suit|pg||
nt|chorush: If Doub grabs the NT, it is difficult to see where they will get more than 8 tricks from|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mildredb: anyone know about Jacobs/Cohler match?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: so perhaps NMF :) non-minor forcing|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mtvesuvius: Most of them were pretty close in the last segment|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: 3@H = "i have a good hand pd, even facing a doubleton heart"|pg||
nt|barnets: key card?|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT = "whatever you need, i ain't got it" - but he has!|pg||
nt|daman: Woolsey is pushing the brakes pretty hard    can smell the rubber from here|pg||
nt|barnets: When east wins the @HA he should shift to the @SJ|pg||
nt|thegarve:  5NT more balanced , 5@C a control|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|othered1: Plenty of time to right the ship.  But Robinson has been playing rather well.|pg||
nt|barnets: west has to find the ! switch|pg||
nt|barnets: @D switch|pg||
nt|barnets: when he wins the @C ace|pg||
nt|barnets: must play the Q|pg||
nt|othered1: which may be right now|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: diamond to the king would be hilarious|pg||
nt|othered1: East should have a way to signal in @D|pg||
nt|chorush: Yes, that would be a good shift Barnet|pg||
nt|barnets: this will give declarer a guess in spades|pg||
nt|barnets: he may well find it|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: yes 4@S kickback i assume|pg||
nt|othered1: @D to K likely would block suit|pg||
nt|barnets: here we go|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: "what do you mean you didn't play the @dQ? Isn't it obvious?"|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|gavin: ok|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|daman: he just has to barge to the slam now|pg||
nt|barnets: doesnt like hearts|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gavin: or he just gets hearts right|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|athene: no 5@D asking for @HQ?|pg||
nt|barnets: well its a reasonable contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|barnets: just unlucky|pg||
nt|athene: not that good|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|barnets: oh well|pg||
nt|benjent: Weichsel surely must have thought he was getting a chance to hear partner's suit and get some bidding going|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: @HQ onside AND no ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: with the ruff|pg||
nt|athene: under 50%|pg||
nt|othered1: if south now thinks @D could be fatal, could try for 4 @S tricks but that would need stiff !Q or 3-3 with Q in west|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|daman: cursed   but a super lead|pg||
nt|benjent: Meanwhile, I've been paying no attention at all to this hand, but I'm sure Stewart has played it beautifully|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gavin: now a trump to force a diamond finesse|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: same here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|barnets: im sure you have bid a lot worse william|pg||
nt|athene: that is for sure|pg||
nt|athene: i play a relay system so most of my slams are in 2-1 fits after subtle misunderstandings|pg||
nt|barnets: now all should be clear to e/w|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|barnets: now dec can merrily xruff|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mtvesuvius: Which is onside though :)|pg||

nt|mildredb: 6 boards to go|pg||
nt|barnets: had south played 6N on a club lead he would win a second club pitching a spade from dummy and finesse hearts|pg||
nt|daman: My slams are a bit different...I usually have to endplay the opponents for -2|pg||
nt|athene: yes, because he can't guarantee to reach his hand again after trick 1|pg||
nt|athene: east is excited now|pg||
nt|athene: and will get more excited when his partner opens|pg||
nt|athene: they might have a sufficiently revealing auction to 6@H that south can find the underlead of @DAxxx|pg||
nt|athene: unfortunately, he hasn't got that :)|pg||
nt|barnets: best contract 6N by west|pg||
nt|barnets: see if they can do that|pg||
nt|athene: but there is still the upside that declarer might suspect you of doing it|pg||
nt|daman: they will bid slam and South will lead the @D 10 and East will have to guess|pg||
nt|athene: so we see here the two main reasons for playing in 6NT, not a suit|pg||
nt|athene: board 7 - it was a ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: i think they might reach 6N always the optimist|pg||
nt|athene: this time - to protect a tenace|pg||
nt|barnets: they practice bidding a lot|pg||
nt|daman: that would be wise|pg||
nt|athene: the other time you want to is when you have two main trick sources |pg||
nt|athene: and you can survive a bad break in either one - as long as it's not trumps|pg||
nt|daman: East might think he is protecting a tenace as well|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s bid the bad balanced slam in the other room and lost a swing|pg||
nt|athene: what's happening here? are they off for a smoke break or something?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: east already played the jack so his partner would hop queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: 11 imps|pg||
nt|athene: ah okie|pg||
nt|barnets: tks missed it|pg||
mb|1C|an|maybe 2|mb|p|nt|othered1: NS have good enough play for 41H but are unlikely to score it.|pg||
nt|cindy:  if E bids 2@s  they can hold @s to 2|pg||
mb|1D|an|alert|nt|cindy:  hold @hs to 2|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@H on @H guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now west will rebid either 2@S, 2NT or 3@C|pg||
nt|barnets: a heart lead  will defeat 3N and 5@D seems a trick short|pg||
nt|chorush: Fleisher has a problem; if Kamil had the diamond ace instead of the spade ace 3NT would make|pg||
nt|thegarve:  might be a game swing out as North may opena  15-17 1NT|pg||
mb|1N|an|17-20|nt|mtvesuvius: 2@c is an Artifical GF I believe|pg||
nt|daman: looks like 6NT now|pg||
nt|cindy:  no 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: depending which flavour of 2/1 he plays|pg||
nt|chorush: many players play that an immediate 3D by Fleisher is weaker than pass, so he may be grateful for the double|pg||
nt|benjent: Granovetetr-Rubin also played in @c doubled on the granny ... but 3 levels higher, and 13 back to Robinson|pg||
mb|2H|an|transfer|nt|mtvesuvius: It's the beginning of a long relay auction to 3NT or 4@s probably :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, east could just ask for aces over 2NT and bid either 6nt or 7nt|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cindy:  E on lead   duh|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: hope that was alerted|pg||
nt|cindy:  well   when partner bids 2@s   im leading one|pg||
nt|barnets: south can put 6 clubs in west hand and 6spades in east hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chorush: seems to be down 1 off the top; could be more if they can get an effective tap going|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: could you ever want to play 7@H rather than 7NT? doesn't look likely|pg||
nt|daman: It's amazing    the combined specs for this final is roughly 550   at Zia's table in the repechage there are  1855 specs|pg||
nt|athene: the only reason i could see for preferring hearts to NT is if you wanted to ruff the spades good|pg||
nt|athene: but if west has enough entries to do that, you have enough tricks in 7nt anyway surely|pg||
nt|daman: 4@S is kickback|pg||
nt|benjent: Yes, Stewart-Woolsey may have ranged themselves out of a swing. The vagaries of system. Funny, my friend David Morgan was blogging on that very subject just yesterday.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Shorter than I thought :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  he can pitch club on spade though|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  its dangerous not to play 15-17|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: well done|pg||
nt|daman: good bidding guys|pg||
nt|barnets: well bid --- |pg||
nt|athene: better take that @DA|pg||
nt|thegarve:  creates swings|pg||
nt|benjent: Particularly when you're in the lead. You want to play as many of the same (sane) contracts as you can.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  If you are much the weaker side a different range is ideal|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|barnets: i had faith|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps north should try the @DA underlead|pg||
nt|daman: snooze/lose|pg||

mb|3N|an|alert|nt|chorush: Club lead will defeat 4H so 3NT "must" be better :)|pg||

nt|mmmakela: relay systems not very entertaining unless a besserwisser among commentators|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: he needs to be carefull and cash the ace of spades|pg||

nt|gavin: meck made a takeout double and rodwell already had the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Right, it will be the only way he will avoid the endplay now|pg||
nt|gavin: hes playing rodwell to not have bid with Axxx of hearts and AD|pg||
nt|barnets: he has an undisclosed 6 card heart suit --|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|an|alerted|nt|benjent: In terms of this auction, the summary form stops at 1@c :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: wow a bid was alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: i think all bids alerted, sorry if i missed some!|pg||
nt|thegarve:  i suspect that 3NT was a serious slam try|pg||
mb|4N|nt|gavin: meck knows ekeblad never would have played the king from kj of diamonds|pg||
nt|gavin: since he is marked with points for his vulnerable takeout double|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Now Rodwell must play a black suit to remove Meckstroth from an endplay|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|benjent: I'm going to wildly speculate that E has shown a 3 suiter with short clubs, and West has set spades as trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: so 6 spades it will be|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|barnets: 3n was cold on all occasions the defence could no take 4 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|benjent: then a couple of cue-bids, and keycard blackwood getting 1-or-4|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  4NT RKB and 5C 1 Ace|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and what u all lead as N?|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: peter showed 4-4-3-2 dist with 12-14 hcp and spades as trump|pg||
nt|benjent: 4@d must be something else ... maybe (thanks kib) it's an end-signal, and then when he continues, it makes 4NT keycard|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphu7: he put his small diamond down with @c|pg||
nt|benjent: So it sounds like their methods can't handle the 4441 better-than-normal positive|pg||
nt|mmmakela: easy 12 looking at all cards but the best line?|pg||
nt|benjent: guess the diamonds right :)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  normally best to treat stiff kings as balanced hands|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: ekeblad is considering right now... |pg||
nt|mmmakela: can pitch 1 on hearts so some kind of crossruff?|pg||
nt|benjent: Short an entry I think, after the spade lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: with limited rounds|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|thegarve:  its the straight @D finnesse|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so chalk up 1430|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|benjent: he could ruff a couple of clubs, drawing a couple of trumps, and then cash hearts (working because hearts are 4-2 and spades are 3-2 the right way) - but a seriously inferior line|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||

nt|Vugraphu7: Wildavsky: I'm glad the heart cashed|pg||

nt|vugraphu7: long time to spend in dentist chair!|pg||

mb|3S|nt|chorush: "Standard" bidding would have South open 1NT and play 4 hearts after Smolen|pg||
nt|chorush: but NS play a weaker NT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: was expecting even 4 S from south|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: he will likely only raise 2H to 3H here|pg||
nt|mildredb: anyone pass 1DX?|pg||
nt|athene: not a bad shot actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: for some reason woolsey discarded his fourth heart instead of his useless club|pg||
nt|barnets: allowing dec to make 4 heart tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: other than that the play was the same|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@C looks like EW's max,b ut north won't sell out|pg||
mb|4S|an|alert|nt|gavin: against them thats a great bid|pg||

nt|mmmakela: 2 places to play|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|barnets: dec gets forced and cant draw all the trump|pg||
nt|chorush: yes, if played by 15-17 notrumpers, would be played by Suth and not get a diamond lead|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 4@H has no play on the @s lead|pg||
nt|gavin: 1 imp pickup on board 114 bringing the total down to 24|pg||
nt|othered1: This hand doesn't display EW's system very well|pg||
nt|barnets: so he has to develop is winners without drwing trumps|pg||
nt|chorush: Fleisher is going to have a chance to make a great play: ducking the spade king when spades are led|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps west can duck a spade and then give his partner a ruff|pg||
nt|chorush: great minds think alike Barnet:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|gavin: lots of people suggesting that 4H from the other side had a chance|pg||

nt|chorush: We may see 3H doubled as a final contract here|pg||
nt|mmmakela: really didn't have the cards|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|mtvesuvius: Potential swing if they rightside 6@H :)|pg||
mb|d|an|1suit OR other hands|nt|chorush: Hi Andrei|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1-suiter?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Nickell is up on Jacobs 25-14 with 3 to play   and Strul is up on Welland 14-8 with 3 to play|pg||
mb|2C|an|forced|nt|barnets: down 3|pg||
nt|thegarve:  or both|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: 2NT super-accept |pg||
mb|2S|nt|Vugraphu7: modern symmetry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@H re-transfer|pg||
nt|barnets: bonjour|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu7: at these colors, N/S are unlikely to try the 5@c save. The question is whether E/W bid 5@d and whether they guess the spades. If they're there, they'll likely guess right|pg||
nt|chorush: down 4 looks possible to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: seems like u cant make 6H with hearts 3-0|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gavin: and spades 6-2|pg||
nt|gavin: even on wrong lead|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like 5@D and 3N both make|pg||
pc|c4|nt|barnets: yes 2 spade losers i didnt notice|pg||
nt|aupillon: i bet too on 4 down|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if down I'll eat my neighbour's underwear|pg||
nt|thegarve:  if sharon stone would not be so bad|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: shouldn't be too many problems here|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|athene: you have to decide whether to draw all three trumps and then rely on the fourth heart (or @CQ) to take care of the fourth diamond|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|daman: no need now|pg||
nt|athene: or try for two diamond ruffs in north|pg||
nt|athene: should be 11 now|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s do ok in spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mtvesuvius: Yeah, I missed that part.... that would be a real letdown if they had found it and got the wrong lead|pg||
nt|athene: draw trumps, @HAK ruff, claim|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w will stop in 5@D|pg||
nt|barnets: north has to lead a low spade|pg||
nt|barnets: which he wont now|pg||
nt|barnets: after the x|pg||
nt|barnets: and e/w have hearts in the picture in the grandslam hand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|barnets: had east held wests !J there would have been a problem for dec|pg||
nt|daman: he needed Jxx for it to be a problem|pg||
nt|barnets: bidding 2@S over 1@S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|barnets: without this lead of course|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphu7: in 6Hx. weichsel is thinking about blue|pg||
nt|cindy:  10 imp pick up for Fleisher on 40 where they went down in 4@h|pg||
nt|cindy:  3N making 4 in other room|pg||
nt|aupillon: Remark my presence here due to the fact that begginers look more Nickel's team. Here, we are the best :)|pg||
nt|aupillon: :)|pg||
nt|barnets: yes i think it was better contract|pg||
nt|cindy:  too bad about the misunderstanding on last hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|chorush: I suspect another 10 imps are coming on the board that NS stopped in 3 hearts making 4, but 4 might be beaten|pg||
nt|mmmakela: inspired duck by S|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3/5 lead so know its a singleton Ace|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sry S played hearts|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: but must also be thinking, "Opps have a good save in spades"|pg||
nt|barnets: xx|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@Hxx|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: 1210 is better than 800|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|aupillon: it would be many tricks down...|pg||
nt|barnets: 16 each on the set|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|barnets: now west bid 6@S|pg||
nt|barnets: and south has bid 7@H|pg||
nt|thegarve:  a trick from out of the blue|pg||
mc|8|nt|thegarve:  the double of 2@c suggested a 5332 shape|pg||

nt|Vugraphu7: great lead by Doub there, although everyone is probably more concerned with the other table|pg||

nt|aupillon: If in my life I could believe that GOD ( Barnet)was commenting at the same table that i do, my life would have been better from more years before...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: music quiz: Out of the Blue; who's album?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mildredb: it doesn't get any better than this!|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S NS i guess|pg||
nt|athene: another 11 tricks|pg||
nt|thegarve:  need the net|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: i believe is 10-12|pg||
nt|mmmakela: disallowed|pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: i though he could not find it after his patrners x of 4@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east might go 5@D i suppose|pg||
nt|barnets: 500|pg||
nt|athene: spade to @SA, small club back and you have to rise @CK to avoid 800 in 5@DX|pg||
nt|barnets: i dont think theres any answer to that |pg||
mb|2S|nt|barnets: so 14 imps to fleisher for the grand slam|pg||
nt|aupillon: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: yes a spec points out could be800 on @s lead and low club back|pg||
nt|daman: at least 500 no matter what|pg||
nt|barnets: profffesor|pg||
nt|barnets: i se your a gentle teacher|pg||
mb|2N|nt|barnets: lead is 40|pg||
nt|aupillon: look. A splinter..|pg||
nt|mmmakela: why did N pass?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  its often fun when you are going to game and oppo double you for penalties on the way|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: could be trap waiting to see what happens... auction not likely over|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: if south decides the five-level is for HIM then he will squeak hime|pg||
nt|athene: home|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gavin: 3h is a lot here|pg||
nt|aupillon: undo|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3@s doubled is cheap|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well to me 2 @S was to play|pg||
mb|d|nt|gavin: the bidding was normal|pg||
nt|gavin: but they are too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Yeah, down 2 I think... maybe even -3|pg||
nt|gosia: better than 4 @h many would venture :)|pg||
nt|gavin: seems like a reasonably easy 3 down|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: he did double 4@s, too|pg||
nt|chorush: Changing the subject from Barnet's godliness:), this is the first time in my memory that 2 teams from the round robin have contested the championship. Anybody else know of an ...|pg||
nt|chorush: instance?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: this is a slam try, right?|pg||
nt|barnets: the usual traetment is that is a slam try|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't matter if you play inverted doubles or not - this is always slammy|pg||
nt|aupillon: my bottle is not empty|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|mtvesuvius: Slam missed on  117|pg||
nt|daman: you think 5@S was a form of "Last train"?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: granovetter: my lead?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  weird sequence|pg||
nt|mmmakela: really|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: slight misunderstanding by e-w|pg||
nt|thegarve:  what was the pass of 3@c doubled all about?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: to be fair, they could easily have had a slam on if north had had just a bit more|pg||
nt|barnets: sout did well to pass first time but had to pass second time alsoto win more points|pg||
nt|barnets: seems more natural just to bid an immediate 5@S|pg||
nt|athene: even with partner having NO diamond card wasted, it was still wrong to bid 5 over 5|pg||
nt|barnets: so 5@S is on a trump finesse|pg||
nt|aupillon: You are right Ira. None|pg||
nt|barnets: no I dont remember such a happening|pg||
nt|mmmakela: "slight"|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gosia: partner did respond- Aces rate to be well placed....|pg||
nt|gavin: after cashing 3D, north will play a club|pg||
nt|barnets: before today it seemed a help for the teams to be played in|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|gavin: get in wiht the king of hearts and see that its time to put declarer back in their hand |pg||
nt|vugraphu7: ekeblad let to have a smoke (i think)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|barnets: with extra bridge|pg||
pc|s4|nt|barnets: best to play 5@DX|pg||
nt|thegarve:  aha 2@s waas a transfer to @c|pg||
pc|s6|nt|barnets: so north passed abid south intended as forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: however today some tiredness has crept in|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mmmakela: understandbl|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: yes, and if the @SK is wrong, 5@D is still the same score but 5@S is down|pg||
nt|athene: (well in practice declarer might get a club pitch from dummy on @SKx and guess clubs for just two down i suppose)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: 3d's was supposed to be gf|pg||
pc|s3|nt|barnets: with uncharechteristic lapses|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|barnets: 51Cis easy|pg||
nt|aupillon: after 2 weeks, one can understand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gavin: this works out all the same, king of hearts ace of diamonds and a club|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gosia: surprised Ekeblad did not dbl|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah ekeblad could have taken a piece, hamman might in the same bidding|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 8 IMP match in the other semifinal|pg||
nt|mildredb: the 2 minor kings might have been opposite of the way they were|pg||
nt|gosia: 3 tricks and pard mad vul TO|pg||
nt|gavin: nickell would have the lead right now if they bid that slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: no|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|chorush: Fleisher picked up 6 imps by making 4 hearts on 41, but they have poor results from there|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes|pg||
nt|thegarve:  on baord 58 they made 4S where this room was held to 110|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: sorry play is now going fast as NS draw trumps |pg||
nt|vugraphu7: fraid i will have to show the final tricks|pg||

nt|athene: i think even a cautious player would mark that one up as "solid"|pg||
nt|chorush: yes, it could for sure, but it is a negative position|pg||

nt|daman: thanks to Barnet Shenkin and William Frisby for their keen insights with the hands|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H then pass 3NT looks normal although of course you might be off the spade suit with 5@D cold|pg||

mb|4S|nt|mtvesuvius: yes, and he might|pg||

mb|p|nt|aupillon: bet ?|pg||
nt|cindy:  i wouldnt|pg||
nt|chorush: I think Fleisher may bid 2 spades|pg||
nt|cindy:  have recently seen -300 and -800   that would keep me quiet|pg||
nt|aupillon: bet ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: woolsey could perhaps try 4NT to show the stopper and some useful cards|pg||
nt|athene: he must have thought pass was forcing|pg||

pc|c9|nt|Vugraphu7: this time it IS Granovetter's lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gavin: easy 7 tricks here|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: unclear how Wilavsky could have a suit he wants to play opposite this without having overcalled 1@s|pg||
nt|chorush: in my opinion the spade 8 is the decider. As close as that|pg||
nt|aupillon: x ?|pg||
nt|cindy:  good card for sure|pg||
nt|aupillon: I double that|pg||
nt|barnets: only down1|pg||
nt|barnets: I think south will pass|pg||
nt|chorush: not down at all if they dont attack clubs fast|pg||
nt|aupillon: If N don't open 1NT i don't know when he'll do|pg||
nt|chorush: they play 13-15 NT andrei|pg||
nt|barnets: right ira|pg||
nt|aupillon: why not 1NT by N ?|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: weichsel: well it's a little better ... ekeblad: thats just terrific|pg||

pc|h9|nt|aupillon: or 7|pg||

pc|c4|nt|gavin: now we wait on hamman and the red card to see if he can tie the match|pg||
nt|barnets: north south maybe showing some tiredness|pg||
nt|barnets: he underled his ace last set|pg||
pc|c7|nt|barnets: only lead|pg||
nt|chorush: Wildavsky better not get any ideas about a diamond here|pg||

nt|daman: see you in 20 minutes|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphu7: am sure i am getting cards incorrect but suits are correct|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mtvesuvius: Robsinon won the other semifinal|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chorush: yes, they have done well to defeat this but they should never have doubled it. At least IMO|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Vugraphu7: 2@s was a nice bid by south. 3@h is too expensive and he has interest in 3N|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|thegarve:  only half way so 79 IMPs is possible though not so lilkely|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h8|nt|mtvesuvius: So they will meet the winners of this match in the final|pg||
