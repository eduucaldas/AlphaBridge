nt|Vugraphu7: We'll be starting momentarily - will enter scores from 46 & 47 in the movie and then have live coverage from then on|pg||
nt|inquiry: I know Bramley and wold play precision, I am not sure what system Shi and Yang use, but we will soon discover.... |pg||
nt|bridge_one: if A in @D in South probably A in @C in North, so the line is the best|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Pretty fair bench players|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: down 1 on Bd 31|pg||
mb|1S|nt|frankaus: maybe deserve the full -10|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl at 4@H means any value in N|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: very heavy 1NT|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|sater1957:  4@S might be bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: do NS have a gadget showing minors?|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 61-67 now|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: the late cansino had a method for dealing with hands like west's|pg||
nt|barnets: ew do better in hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: spades is not a happy contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: sounds like that gilbert an sullivan song|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: However, the auction is not over|pg||
nt|barnets: it is now|pg||
nt|sssvablue: I type too sloooow|pg||
nt|barnets: north has 10 hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 41s only seems to have 9 tricks without some help from the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the lead wont hurt|pg||
nt|barnets: it looks like a very weak nt|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sssvablue: seems like 4 losers|pg||

nt|onebid: Hi everyone|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Yes, congrats JoAnn!|pg||
nt|barnets: or play the 10|pg||
nt|barnets: from dummy|pg||
nt|barnets: if he palys low to the Q he has 3 spade losers|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|barnets: if he plays the @s10 it goes J QK|pg||
nt|hlortz: should come to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jbgood: sure|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|Walddk7: Good evening to Jeff Sapire|pg||
nt|milton_se: should make now -- 5th diamond as 8th trick|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fann4: Hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: with north on  a blind lead i think that dims was abetter shot on the grounds that its more likely to hit an honour in pard'shand against a low level contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: without costing unlike the disastrous heart lead|pg||

nt|inquiry: =============== Board 48 =====================|pg||
nt|mrs q: this is an intersting deal|pg||
nt|chick: but that meant he had to guess the @HJ was singleton|pg||
nt|sssvablue: cards were marked|pg||
nt|sssvablue: low heart lead from north|pg||
nt|chick: that would help :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: wellnot a world class performance by these world class palyers!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: results are correct|pg||
nt|jbgood: good|pg||
mb|1D|nt|milton_se: Strul didn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: looks like a part score battle here|pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|mrs q: EW can make 6H but NS can really block the bidding from here|pg||
nt|jbgood: another spade game|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|onebid: should be routine 4@S|pg||
nt|vbman: l am sure considering the state of the match they will  bid it|pg||
nt|mrs q: IF S bids spades, NS will have to settle for a small plus|pg||
nt|mrs q: I would have preferred a 4S bid by S|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Glen Ashton|pg||
nt|glen: hi 007|pg||
nt|inquiry: hi Glen|pg||
nt|vbman: hi glen|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not easy to read exactly the South hand, however J in @C was a great play|pg||
nt|sater1957:  hard to conceive of a swing here...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sssvablue: loser gets to play the hand|pg||
nt|glen: good afternoon ben :)|pg||
nt|mrs q: ye all|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: back the boss suit to win|pg||
nt|mrs q: bye|pg||
nt|glen: wow, a fun hand to join - oh wait, backtrack time|pg||
nt|milton_se: true, bud W should have played a D instead of 9H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bridge_one: yes, playing @D the contract was safe|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lead and play to the first trick virtually placed the heart cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: wronk|pg||
nt|frankaus: wrong even|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: west looking for a reason not to lead @H|pg||
nt|sssvablue: couldnt'|pg||
nt|glen: hi Kursat :)|pg||
nt|inquiry: 7@H, 1@C, 1@D, 3@S ruffs. ... more fun to bid than play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: elegant bid by East|pg||
nt|lestergold: only layout to play for at the end|pg||
nt|barnets: in fact had he played the HQ north still had a spade and a diamond left|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: many respind 1@S with South - but I much prefer 2@C|pg||
nt|glen: Q from spec: why 3@D, and not 3@S - i expect S assumed they would not buy hand, so wanted to get lead director in|pg||
nt|lestergold: he knew that playing a club was misere|pg||
nt|sssvablue: I would think this double shows clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: which were two tricks and I believe the defense had 4|pg||
nt|barnets: already|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|onebid: respond:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: poor Cohen|pg||
pc|h5|nt|barnets: so he did not err check it on on the movie rerun|pg||

nt|sssvablue: Berk will bid 3@d|pg||

nt|fann4: t|pg||
nt|milton_se: but W really msu do everything right|pg||
nt|bridge_one: open room 3@S+1     in this hand isn't difficult to make 4, it is difficult to call game !|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|onebid: North knows pard 6-5, but 4@H seems a bit much|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm 3d looks cold but 3s makes as well|pg||
nt|sssvablue: and he will even get 2 entries to dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s vulnerable being cautious i suppose|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s4|nt|frankaus: this has chances|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||

mb|p|nt|inquiry: ============== board 49 =====================|pg||
nt|sssvablue: with 4 tricks in he always had spade and diamond to lose|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: entered incorrect play; keyboard problems.|pg||
nt|sater1957:  5@S for NS, but EW will have something to say|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jbgood: and if they say too much - they may pay a heavy price|pg||
nt|sater1957:  5@H by E is reasonable|pg||
nt|jbgood: having 6 losers EW|pg||
nt|hlortz: will gu bid 4@D  @S+ @D..|pg||
nt|jbgood: leaping Michaels now?|pg||
nt|sater1957:  they have an 11 card fit. Bad luck about @D being 3-3|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: Gu immobile|pg||
mb|2S|mb|2N!|nt|frankaus: this looks like a beer hand - can i offer u one?|pg||
nt|barnets: I wonder if the pass shows diamonds|pg||
nt|sssvablue: 3nt will require careful play on @d lead|pg||
nt|sater1957:  Convention or psyche?|pg||
nt|hlortz: hmm 2@S  not everyone's choice but will atrike gold|pg||
nt|jbgood: did he think he was to bad for a leaping Michael's - or were NS in lavk of that toy?|pg||
nt|hlortz: strike even|pg||
mb|4H|nt|barnets: because he may want a diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: what does Oz think now?|pg||
nt|onebid: it may have been better to bid spades the first time|pg||
nt|inquiry: Looks like Melih and Mark can make 4@S and 4@H but this auction has made it|pg||
nt|inquiry: very difficult to get into the bidding...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: studying Lewis cc|pg||
nt|glen: some form of puppet stayman here|pg||
nt|vbman: need good brakes here|pg||
nt|chick: kinda depends on what the X showed|pg||
nt|jbgood: keyboard still cold - too and lack ...|pg||
nt|hlortz: 2n to muddy the waters|pg||
nt|jbgood: you gain nothing when the opps have a good fit - better jump to the level you feel is aprropriate|pg||
nt|sater1957:  North too strong now for 4@s|pg||
nt|sater1957:  give PD 2 Aces and Q of S and 6S is ciold|pg||
nt|jbgood: not sure - prd has a passed hand... |pg||
nt|jbgood: my prd NEVER has a perfect hand|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|fann4: No action by S in the OR, a bit surprising.|pg||
nt|fann4: N must be tempted to bid 2@D, but it is vul|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S by south is a risk - np plauing MP, but in IMP can be dangerous|pg||
nt|barnets: x was standard takeout|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3s forcing i assume|pg||
nt|sater1957:  but 5@s still safe|pg||
mb|5C|nt|onebid: 5@D a good sac|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: Mark thinks 3@d=Majors|pg||
nt|vbman: a dbl may help here|pg||
nt|fann4: Either way they will be in a 4-3 fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: this is the par contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s probably going off|pg||
nt|barnets: see if south leads a@D|pg||
nt|jbgood: problem is that S has his bid - and 5 may be in jeopardy.. a big risk going on|pg||
nt|hlortz: well they will survive the 5 level with @S 2-2|pg||
mb|5S|nt|lestergold: now has to switch to that pesky dim|pg||
nt|sssvablue: will now shift to one most likely|pg||
nt|lestergold: and then its off without the option|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n probably rolls in of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: a pass by Linda was the winner?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @C lead was better|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sssvablue: No better way to start the day, cold pizza and beer, the breakfast of champions|pg||
nt|onebid: slow action|pg||
nt|inquiry: If Oz bid game, 5@D is a better save over a major game than 5@C, because a|pg||
nt|inquiry: diamond ruff is available in clubs..|pg||
nt|onebid: true, but not relevant|pg||
nt|inquiry: well, linda knows paul has to be very weak to pass 3@C I think, so she might|pg||
nt|inquiry: well save if they find the game|pg||
nt|onebid: while we wait - Federer cruising in French Open|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: 1 keycard|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: How do you like the psyche in the other room|pg||
nt|jbgood: the contract in the OR is really something:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: I love it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mark Lair (West) heard 2 weak hearts from his partner and psyched 4@S next. Wonderful!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|milton_se: certainly, but South will anyhow be forced to give a H to dummy|pg||
nt|barnets: missed it|pg||

nt|bridge_one: and @S blocked so 2@C make the same|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well hm...|pg||
nt|barnets: N orth had a fit in both majors - i would have bid something that suggested a @D lead|pg||

nt|inquiry: ================== Board 51 =================|pg||
nt|hlortz: a 'routine' 11 tricks...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4H! instead Dbl is technically more precise having one suit hand - But Dbl take the chance to play 3NT also..|pg||
nt|sater1957:  match tied now|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sssvablue: Ugly 12 count in South|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: It is the middle of summer in this part of the world.. so we are not particular about the brand :)|pg||
nt|sssvablue: 12 Imps to Struhl on 19|pg||
nt|barnets: the score is 14 only|pg||
nt|lestergold: a close call for south|pg||
mb|d|nt|frankaus: james boag from tasmania was voted best beer in the world about 3 years ago|pg||
nt|barnets: because of the crash the score is not updated|pg||
nt|jbgood: and now a cold game for NS|pg||
mb|2D|an|alerted by Gu|nt|glen: good hand for support doubles - double by S says I support your NT ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a bad 9 hell probably invite and it will be declined|pg||
nt|hlortz: well 'cold' on the @S & @D position|pg||
nt|sater1957:  2@d presumably some sort of @H raise|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vbman: support for nt|pg||
nt|glen: N is marked with some @Cs (since didn't bid a major), and thus both players know the takeout double is passable|pg||
nt|vbman: heart j is a good card|pg||
nt|glen: the question is how rich in @C should N be to pass it|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: puppet sequence|pg||
nt|jbgood: transfer?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: altho 3n looks as if it has play the dims are very friendly|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: Here also, but we are having a dismal day 60 F (15 C) and rain|pg||
nt|sssvablue: low club will not work well|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: ugly Stan, but it will get them to the makeable game|pg||
nt|frankaus: two aces - but still  only 25 zars so the zar deciples would pass|pg||
nt|sssvablue: unsupported queens and flat distribution|pg||
nt|glen: now will E try a surprise @H play|pg||
nt|chick: wouldn't 2@D show a 4 card major in puppet?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well committed to game now|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: best lead for NS|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: 3N would have worked better|pg||
nt|glen: Q from spec: should N pass the double - imo, with the @C 9, yes, without no|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: 2D showed hearts|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jbgood: 3 NT by N perhaps the best contract - but 4 @h will also make in comfort|pg||
nt|sater1957:  overtrick, west has no entry|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: i don't if they use 2 way checkback|pg||
pc|h4|nt|inquiry: 4@H needed normal hearts split and both finesses working, or a club lead away|pg||
nt|inquiry: from the king. It is not a good game and will fail here. South knows about teh|pg||
nt|inquiry: @DK so expect the @DA lead here|pg||
nt|fann4: I think 2@C here is xyz - a transfer to 2@D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: me too|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|inquiry: At this stage with a nice lead, I would have thought pass was right. It is not even|pg||
nt|inquiry: game if it makes, and the undertricks are very profitable|pg||
nt|lestergold: west will never get in to lead a spade thru|pg||
nt|jbgood: I cannot see how he gets rid of his 4th spade - so guess he goes for just making|pg||
nt|sater1957:  you're right|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|barnets: dec set to make 3 @D 3@c 2 @H and a spade|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|onebid: not the play we expected|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
nt|chick: Sally Woolsey tells me that 2@D means just no 5 card major-- they have hundreds of puppet sequences for exact distribution (really!)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jbgood: but E should only throw one spade - and the uptrick is there|pg||
nt|sater1957:  now you're wrong again...|pg||

nt|barnets: best|pg||
nt|barnets: try to set up long heart|pg||
nt|barnets: before he has 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is not an easy hand to declare|pg||
nt|chick: nor to defend|pg||
nt|barnets: I think the heart at trick 2 gives def a chance|pg||
nt|lestergold: stewart needs tricks from three suits which order to play them in- i think heart wrong because defenders also have a future in the heart suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: JoAnna Stansby says hi in the room.|pg||
nt|barnets: had he led diamonds could not break it|pg||
nt|barnets: now can cohen find another heart play ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: Cohen had better take his chance and return the heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: Larry is thinking hard about it.|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is endplayed in all the other suits in any case!|pg||
nt|lestergold: Maybe Cohen is thinking of tabling the Jc|pg||
nt|barnets: lew stansby did well to make 4@H when he did not get the @HJ led|pg||

pc|hT|nt|hlortz: he wont risk the @S finesse...|pg||

nt|sater1957:  maximum opening presumably :-)|pg||

nt|inquiry: The 3@C bid was heart raise, and Linda Lewis has so many girls best friends she|pg||
nt|inquiry: will find plenty of reasons to bid..|pg||
nt|onebid: and she would be disappointed to find she has 3 losers in that suit|pg||
nt|inquiry: ===========  Board 53 =====================|pg||
nt|inquiry: 54|pg||
nt|inquiry: sorry|pg||
nt|glen: can we rebanner?|pg||
nt|jbgood: A kib says: "when 1 NT could be 3 points then 2 spades is only possible rebid" - I couldnt agree more:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sssvablue: this is a nice hand for weak nt|pg||
nt|inquiry: ================== Board 54 =======================|pg||
nt|jbgood: if that is how they play...|pg||
nt|sater1957:  if the NT could be 3 points it presumably contains a 3crd @S suit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sssvablue: describe in 1 bid|pg||
nt|onebid: Paul will be thrilled to hear Linda's diamond bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: We're going to close and reopen this room to get the two rooms connected. Will be just a moment. Sorry|pg||
nt|inquiry: sure :)|pg||
nt|glen: personally i don't like bergen on 4-3-3-3s, but many do|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not everyone's idea of a good overcall|pg||
nt|sssvablue: This is not a good start for Kit and Fred|pg||
nt|barnets: now east is hoping for a penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: 4@H in the OR here|pg||
nt|sater1957:  in that case the opps can make about 4H, so who cares about bidding 3@S|pg||
mb|2C|an|alerted by Gu|nt|sunsamvar: have another beer Stan.. dont be sorry :)|pg||
nt|barnets: shows spades|pg||
mb|d|nt|milton_se: don't they play 2C non-forcing?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sssvablue: smolen coming|pg||
nt|fann4: Hopefully not|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: seem they play 2@C F and dbl medium - inverted|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jbgood: i agree with you too, Hans|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: this board should speed along to 620|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: puppet|pg||
nt|sater1957:  so 3@D showing 4-4 majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: waiting for Gu|pg||
nt|hlortz: over dbl? 2@D presumably natural & 3@D a raise....|pg||
mb|3H|nt|onebid: we clearly missed the real auction|pg||
nt|barnets: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think id pass with this moderate colelction misfitting with pard|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry: Ok, maybe she jumped to 4@D or bid and rebid D, she got to makable contract.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well escaped undoubled|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Which moderate collection, there are 4 of them|pg||
nt|lestergold: south|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt or 4@S?|pg||
nt|sssvablue: either works|pg||
nt|sssvablue: my kind of choice|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed a horrible lot of hands passed out in many games|pg||
nt|lestergold: can see south maybe scrambling up to 7 tricks hard to see the eighth|pg||
nt|barnets: in the last hand we saw e/w west get to 3D down 2 vul in the other room they are playing 3@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: well as  isaid easy to get into trouble without the kit they were using|pg||
nt|barnets: this wont be asucces|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean deeper trouble than they did|pg||
nt|barnets: as a defender has aj10xx|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: i prefer 3 nt because of the @C holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: as opposed to being 420 friendly|pg||
nt|jbgood: may win 3 imps here|pg||
nt|sater1957:  well, 4@H on the layout better than 3NT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|frankaus: this lead will not displease declarer|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and in 4@S there is danger of @C ruff|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Everything about east hand screamed 3nt, flat distribution, points and fillers in minors, secondary heart fit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: or @H ruff|pg||
nt|frankaus: @CQT83 worthless in @S contract|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: might even have 4 losers|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so all votes for 3 nt... well bid|pg||
nt|hlortz: tho south seems to have a different impression|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Vugraphu7: Levin asking whether anything was promised about clubls|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: Levin has called a director|pg||
nt|sater1957:  my guess is that this has to do with whether N promised or denied a @C stopper|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: issue is meaning of 2D after the dble, with respect to clubs|pg||
nt|sater1957:  but why that makes a difference to Levin at this stage is unclear to me|pg||
nt|sater1957:  unless he was seriously thinking of bidding @c again...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: Levin and director have gone out into the hallway|pg||
nt|hlortz: he still thinks gu has a @H suit i suppose...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: Levin is back; now Gu and director are outside|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: no one wanted to declare hanything herfe|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be more easy playing 9@C that J@D|pg||
nt|sater1957:  if South explained the 2@D as promising a major, and his 3@d as 4-4 majors, I still don't underatnd Levin's problem now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Vugraphu7: director is watching|pg||
nt|jbgood: may have been contrary explanations?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes wonder what gu explained his bids as|pg||

nt|sssvablue: he is up to 5 tricks now if he cashes out|pg||
nt|lestergold: hit the iceberg in the auction|pg||
nt|barnets: so 3c was down 4 in other room|pg||
nt|barnets: was 5 imps to strul|pg||
nt|barnets: now down by 7|pg||

nt|lestergold: well there you go 2000 the kiss of death at mps and here it gained 5 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: 200 i mean|pg||
nt|sssvablue: I believe the difference is 9|pg||

nt|glen: this S hand looks NT to me, but every hand does that|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sssvablue: in the old days this would be passed out|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n for n/s spades establishable but no entry|pg||
nt|barnets: i need it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|glen: now S would like to show extras and 6@Hs, but not get too high opposite a poor N hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Jack Oest|pg||
nt|joest: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland in 6 of a minor|pg||
pc|s2|nt|glen: settles for the value showing 3@H|pg||
nt|inquiry: slam is easy after this jump, wonder if they could have found hearts if opened|pg||
nt|inquiry: NT (of course they could have found 6NT then)|pg||
nt|glen: after considering possible S hands, N might just RKCB and blast the slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: north reaches for a bid, pulls his hand back and sighs|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sssvablue: The west hand has little (nothing) to recommend it|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|onebid: Hi Jack|pg||
nt|inquiry: welcome jack|pg||
nt|joest: hi Judy and Ben|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i suppose they play xfert over 1@C, so 1@D=@H and 1@S no majors|pg||
nt|fann4: 3@C in the OR|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 2@D isn't rever - with rever south could use a major (knowing North without 4 cards)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|frankaus: only 25 zars so the zar followers pass|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3rd hand .. any small excuse to open|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Oh tzar of the Zar, how many Zar points?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 of a minor looks viable here|pg||
pc|h7|nt|glen: not even RKCB, just blast|pg||
nt|fann4: E was giving serious thought to balancing. |pg||
pc|h5|nt|onebid: nice bid by Paul|pg||
nt|lestergold: in 6 no one will pick up the qc|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Kit will probably play AK in both minors to keep larry off lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep the safe option|pg||
nt|lestergold: safest|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|joest: indeed.  Ozdil goes into the Opening Lead Hall of Fame with a heart lead|pg||

nt|cicus: oh this match seems to have been decide already|pg||
nt|inquiry: now you get your 1@C glenn|pg||
nt|barnets: wel he had the 3 and the 2 was in dummy|pg||
mb|1C|nt|glen: yes, but not much science expected from E|pg||
nt|fann4: So will West overcall, like the OR?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes 4 of spades that how he knopw it was a 7/1 split|pg||
nt|barnets: so unless east had he had 7|pg||
nt|sssvablue: It was nice of them to win 2 imps in the other room on 24 to make the margin 7 and Barnet correct|pg||
nt|lestergold: he had 2 and 3|pg||
mb|d|nt|onebid: now that we are connected to other room, you will see that the other players seem to be using different hands:)|pg||
nt|milton_se: and Becker in for another surprise :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes they are certainly the favored pair on paper but that doesnt count on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2/3 of the boards gone - 5 to go|pg||
mb|1S|an|alerted|nt|sssvablue: so 33 for east |pg||
nt|cicus: 1@D 2-suiter? :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: 1@D alerted as Majors or minors|pg||
nt|cicus: NS s cold for 2@S, maybe even 3|pg||
nt|glen: and EW are cold for N's bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@H for E/W |pg||
nt|fann4: 4@H is very close. Needs a @S lead to beat it.|pg||
nt|sater1957:  looks a push, 4@H not easy to avoid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cicus: normal procedure over such 2-suited bids is to choose from the worse case|pg||
nt|sater1957:  @s presumably is @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 2 distibutional hands and 2 flat ones... unusual|pg||
nt|frankaus: what do u call an 8 card suit???|pg||
nt|sssvablue: an octopus?|pg||
nt|frankaus: trumps :)|pg||
nt|joest: This is limit or better with four trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: of course it would have been a clever play to lead the 4om a doublel ton|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: and I predict he'll bid on|pg||
nt|joest: b/c of the heart queen|pg||
nt|vbman: if the pard of a strong cl opener shows no sign of life u sd be taking precautions to bid|pg||
nt|barnets: then south would have been acutelly unhappy|pg||
nt|jbgood: if common transfer to 1 NT it may be just that or @ds (I think)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: in this case, 2@S meaning he is willing to play 3m if N has minors|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: 1S showed D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sssvablue: Of course an 8 is a snowman in golf|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jbgood: 3 imps for EW?|pg||
nt|sater1957:  S should overtake for a push|pg||
nt|jbgood: N started with 2 rounds of clubs in the OR|pg||
nt|sater1957:  and @DK not overtaken, and claimed for -2. Not exactly what happened presumably|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fann4: On a @D lead, even if S finds the @S switch, declarer can duck to get home.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|inquiry: pver take out doubles, direct raises are usually played as weak, so here they|pg||
nt|inquiry: use 2NT as a limit raise or better|pg||
nt|sssvablue: club to Q and heart through?|pg||
nt|barnets: he would have ducked the spade had zia led it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|joest: it's conceivable Ozdil won't get the trumps right|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes south very trusting i would have ducked a round because im used to tricky stuff from money players who do these things because their pards never watch the pips in any case|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bridge_one: this is a interesting lead problem - knowing your line have many cards in a suit must think is use that suit to communicate, and search a lead more usefull|pg||
nt|bridge_one: of course playing suit contract|pg||
pc|c3|nt|onebid: hardly seems better than limit, but with careful play will make|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Oh, you have played with me before?|pg||
nt|lestergold: our thoughts converge barnet|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|h4|nt|inquiry: wehn the club hook wins (it has to be taken), Ozdil will have to decide how to|pg||

nt|lestergold: spec has suggested that Kit should have cashed AK clubs before third dim|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|lestergold: i should add distinguished spec|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sssvablue: the play will be mundane|pg||
nt|barnets: i dont think so|pg||
nt|barnets: then he would have no entry for the diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: wll it shows i am not visulaising the hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes of course|pg||
nt|barnets: he could cash CKCA but then have to rely on a finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: not clear whether that was a better play or not|pg||
nt|gosia: meanwhile nice defense going on here - David can't see all the hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanwhile back at the ranch what is going to happen here?|pg||
nt|barnets: cashing CK CA and taking a diamond finnese would not have worked had easts diamonds been interchanged with his clubs look at it|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure so a priori which was the better shot?|pg||
nt|barnets: but its not clear what is best cshing 1 club is safe|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe the Q would drop|pg||
nt|barnets: I f you cash a second club you need to take a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|gosia: David should probably figure from the sequence of club plays that Kit has few entries|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: David is still thinking hard on this trick.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|milton_se: reasonable choice with those spades in dummy|pg||

nt|sssvablue: Robinson finally stopped the bleeding with a 3 imp pickup on 25|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: 2S shows hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and east doubles of course|pg||
mb|3S|nt|glen: the actual hotel (crowne plaza) is rated 3 stars, but the extra bridge stars make up for it|pg||
nt|inquiry: Modern trend to interfer over strong club.. shown on this hand the hand|pg||
nt|inquiry: before...|pg||
nt|fann4: This is the kind of 3NT that can be missed, after a 2@C rebid by West.|pg||
nt|barnets: undo i think|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: 2H was spades and a minor|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sssvablue: That would be quite the psyche in 4th seat|pg||
nt|barnets: north opens 1 spade|pg||
mb|d|nt|sssvablue: need to find 4@s, not 4@h|pg||
nt|inquiry: I would have gotten it wrong on the second round of clubs if I played it, but I|pg||
nt|inquiry: would have tried the club hook|pg||
nt|cicus: I meant Ben's service by showing board number|pg||
nt|glen: modern bridge: get to your 5-1 fit as fast as possible|pg||
nt|vbman: nice sp with spots and non v.|pg||
nt|inquiry: Itend to kibitz these things well after they are played... having board numbers in|pg||
nt|inquiry: the commetns is very useful... :)  the vugraph archieves are wonderful|pg||
nt|jbgood: as long as 3 @h presumably also would show hearts, a further explanation would be nice:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: seems like S can take 4 trumps and the @DA|pg||
nt|glen: yes, i love the banners in the comments, since often reviewed post-play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it is a limit of 2/1|pg||
nt|fann4: Always a problem, when Opener is around 17 facing 7 or 8 and no fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: with the power of 4-4 fits, 4@S is a superior contract|pg||
nt|vbman: thats a great idea|pg||
nt|glen: less liked: when commentary from other matches get intertwined|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: an unhappy set of options for west|pg||
mb|p|nt|sater1957:  often the direct raise is preemptive, and then 2@S would be invitational.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|onebid: I want to thank the kibs who have kept me posted on other room. Lot's of glitches as usual|pg||
nt|inquiry: ----------- on to board 42 ---------------------|pg||
nt|sater1957:  big swing for Ozdil|pg||
nt|hlortz: looks like about 800|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sssvablue: the 5th heart provides a pitch for a @c in spades|pg||
nt|vbman: 3cl now|pg||
nt|milton_se: needs an artifical 2C rebid to be solved|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes, Gazilli would have sorted things out.|pg||
nt|lestergold: so what do u call a 3/3 fit playing in 3/3 club fits seems to guive me a sense of deja vu today for some reason|pg||
pc|h7|nt|frankaus: hard to find 4@S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes tough|pg||
nt|inquiry: that happens way too much.. about the commentary being mixed|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|joest: if he makes this one, they need a new wing for the hall of fame :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 1100 would be a nice gain|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|bridge_one: or also a 2NT with 17 and 2 stop in all suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hlortz: yes 1100 would be 8 imps|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: start building it now :)|pg||
nt|onebid: needs a wing and a prayer:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: woolsey says here have the rope hang urselves with it!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jbgood: should start on his reserve trumå suit - duly done|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|barnets: south has been there before not making a noise with his 9 count|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jbgood: å is next to p on my keyboard (if you wonder)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fann4: 2NT is a possiblity, but I don't like it.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|frankaus: some LOL's play extended stayman here  - 2/3@D shows 4-4 with min/max|pg||
nt|cicus: @HK now|pg||
nt|barnets: when his partner open third in hand|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|milton_se: getting too high on many hands|pg||
nt|jbgood: keeping trump control this way|pg||
nt|hlortz: def needs to be carreful even to get 800 wellplayed so far|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s5|nt|glen: yes, @H K would have been nice play|pg||
nt|fann4: I'm with Strul - a 2@C rebidder, and hoping pard can bid again.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: spec asks why not 1n answer is that west is not good enough by their agreements i would have thought 1n is normally quite a constructive reponse|pg||
nt|sssvablue: most play it 8 to 10 or there abouts|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|glen: can S count out W for @S K now?|pg||
nt|cicus: does not matter after all, as S has already been forced can't take @DA|pg||
nt|lestergold: unofrtunately east could not move after the 2c bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - i am impressed with the standar of play at this table, NS have really showed class (as we all know there is plenty of EW)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fann4: Let's see if the OR (Open Room) can get to game.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sunsamvar: how did he go down in closed room ?|pg||
nt|sssvablue: maybe modernist LOL's?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes indeed stan|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jbgood: standarD|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cicus: W should have returned a @D Ithink|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cicus: declarer does it for him|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, Glen, I am sure west was marked with @SK|pg||
nt|cicus: E has shown all his points|pg||
nt|cicus: @SA was the indicate d play|pg||
nt|fann4: Hang on, they are playing a big club system there, so should be easy.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|onebid: now 3 rounds of spades...|pg||
nt|joest: Paul still threatning to take four trump tricks but can be endplayed|pg||
nt|joest: still not clear that Mark will make this|pg||
nt|onebid: and will be|pg||
nt|sater1957:  trump ans then the Q for -500?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He must continue with clubs, otherwise he will lose control completely|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d5|nt|cicus: now E gets another ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: bur most would bid 1n with south or xx|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That @S9 can prove very costly|pg||
nt|sater1957:  1100 now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He was about to escape for 800, but ....|pg||
nt|hlortz: or 1400|pg||
pc|dK|nt|onebid: oh well|pg||
nt|jbgood: well - I should not have given S so much credit - this will reduce the gain to 1 single imp|pg||
nt|pelu: he sh have played @SQ |pg||
mc|5|nt|bridge_one: playing strong club this hands are easy|pg||

nt|inquiry: very difficult hand...|pg||
nt|inquiry: ------------------- on to 43 ---------------|pg||
nt|inquiry: ================== Board 58 ==================|pg||
nt|cicus: EW in the slam zone|pg||
nt|glen: now the dreaded short @D opening?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not the result we were expecting|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So he played it well to a certain point, then fell from grace|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: don't they play 3-suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: 2@D = >2@D|pg||
nt|milton_se: once E gives a positive, they're there|pg||
mb|1C|nt|cicus: oh, they do, I was too slow|pg||
nt|glen: <2@D|pg||
nt|fann4: You KNOW as EW here you are losing about 7 imps, with your counterparts playing a Big Club system in the other room.|pg||
nt|lestergold: last three three fit was four off|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sunsamvar: Tx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Info Indonesian National Championships 2009|pg||
nt|cicus: clasicc precision 2@D showing short @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: no game here - so a competitive bid|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Here we have an auction that might be repeated|pg||
nt|lestergold: normal id say and looks like one off|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: tu for ur company, sunil, stan, kibs - fine operating rihadi|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Was a pleasure commentating and sharing all those beers with you, Stan & Frank|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: www.kejurnas-bridge-2009.comxa.com|pg||
nt|glen: hey, ben got mentioned|pg||
nt|cicus: :)|pg||
nt|vbman: will bid the slam?|pg||
nt|cicus: slam is not particularly good|pg||
nt|glen: I like the slam|pg||
nt|cicus: at least not on a heart lead|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w can make 3N with  good guess|pg||
nt|sater1957:  pass?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: yes|pg||
nt|sater1957:  no, I mean now by N|pg||
nt|hlortz: well to fewS for dbl too weak for 2@D|pg||
nt|jbgood: Grue solved the problem by taking charge with 1 NT on the N hand in the OR|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|sssvablue: Thanks to our commentators Frank Budal(Australia) and Sunil Varghese(india), our VUGraph operator Riaydi from Indonesia|pg||
nt|jbgood: Gu just lacks an r and a e|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fann4: 2@D was meant to show the majors.|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s can only cash 2 spades and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a very biddable 3n tho|pg||
pc|c7|nt|onebid: how many would bid 4@H with Linda's hand?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|joest: Linda did well to resist the temptation to bid 4@h.  She has way more than she might for a 3@h call|pg||
nt|onebid: yes|pg||
nt|inquiry: West is trying for slam... East will cooperate if he really is.....|pg||
nt|glen: this must be one of those auctions that they don't have a lot of|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sunsamvar: Tx also to the organisers and Roland and BBO for bringing us all these telecasts|pg||
nt|sssvablue: OUr sponsors, the good folks at BBO, and of course our spectators ... I am Stan Schenker and stay with us for VU graphs from all over the world this weekend|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|bridge_one: i would choise 3@S in W, however 1down or more|pg||
nt|fann4: This is one for partnerships to discuss. I would have taken 2@D as natural, even given that opener has 5@D|pg||
nt|hlortz: so another 5 imps if e makes it|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c8|nt|frankaus: seems like another 4 imps for EW here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he better cash out|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: or he might get away for 1 down|pg||
nt|cicus: so 4@S was nonforcing but E liked his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: 4@C  then 4@S was a slam try|pg||
nt|jbgood: withdraw the last one - not funny at all:(|pg||
pc|c3|nt|barnets: your a rubber bridge player just bid it|pg||
pc|h3|nt|glen: oh, double of 5@H by the person on lead against @S|pg||
nt|cicus: X is for the lead, lest he forget|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sunsamvar: he loses nothing by playing @Sj|pg||
nt|frankaus: and  gains nothing as well :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and may gain as in this case|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the ruff comes from the 3 carder trump|pg||
pc|s2|nt|glen: S throws cards into the air|pg||
nt|glen: and then says "no questions"|pg||
nt|barnets: and then make it|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: loser on loser|pg||
nt|inquiry: She allowed as teh double might be in case Ozdil was stealing and she was|pg||
nt|inquiry: stacked in diamonds. Vul, I would have bid 4@H, but here I can't fault 3@H too|pg||
nt|inquiry: much|pg||
nt|joest: now exit a diamond and let opps break a black suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|frankaus: cant get back|pg||
nt|inquiry: This lead makes this very easy to play, I guess that is glen's point|pg||
nt|lestergold: with west's hand and 15 points with a feeble spade guard - i dont like inviting 800s|pg||
nt|barnets: the problem is if you cash the hearts your in the wrong hand to finnese thwe @c 10|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|hlortz: or a push at -2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: rubber players double a lot believe me|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h7|nt|barnets: 3@c in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: making?|pg||
nt|barnets: north opened 1@S|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: i assume|pg||
nt|barnets: North has a good hand|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|h8|nt|lestergold: too good for 3s really|pg||

mb|1H|nt|onebid: np|pg||
nt|cicus: will they reach the magic 300 IMP boundary|pg||
nt|glen: hence W has "extras"|pg||
nt|barnets: score is 12 to robinson|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: Swing potential here.|pg||
nt|milton_se: 2S fit jump?|pg||
nt|sssvablue: penultimate board, it has been a big set for strul so far|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fann4: I'm sure it won't be a fit jump. If used it will be weak.|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 boards to the end of the half|pg||
nt|jbgood: this board is   14 of the 15 of this set, and some credits are due. |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|fann4: 4@S can be beaten on a @D lead, @C switch, and then a @D to N for a @c ruff.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however for a pair is usefull to can bid 6 cards immediatly, otherwise need to guess after|pg||
nt|hlortz: gu is not happy here|pg||
nt|jbgood: Many thanks to the USBF (Jan Martel in particular) and BBO (including of course Roland Wald, commentator organiser)  for giving us such exciting entertainment free of charge! And  |pg||
nt|sater1957:  well... just *look* happy and bid 2@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|joest: the spade game on Board 41 made in the otherroom|pg||

nt|fann4: We will keep you posted on the action on bd 14 from the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: so I think this is the last hand of the set|pg||
nt|inquiry: Congradulations to Ozdil|pg||
mb|1C|nt|frankaus: 3NT|pg||
nt|sssvablue: 3nt form North should be cold|pg||
nt|onebid: I doubt they spend a lot of time worrying about bad splits when bidding. 4@D would have gotten them there|pg||
nt|inquiry: ============= board 45 ===============|pg||
nt|milton_se: 1C . 4H will put some pressure on North|pg||
nt|lestergold: well room for some action  here|pg||
nt|barnets: board 19 is not in the score and is 12 imps to strul|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: seems hard to stay out of 4@s|pg||
nt|onebid: Thanks to fellow commentators, kibs and our great vg operator|pg||
nt|lestergold: west bids 4s but north will surely be there with something|pg||
nt|sater1957:  sure, and one board to play. I thought that the USA was the law is law country, and the Netherlands the lax....|pg||
nt|jbgood: and in KO matches time penalty will most often only be given to teams that have been warned during play|pg||
mb|1S|nt|inquiry: upgrading the 15 hcp hand to 16, only the most pendatic precision players|pg||
nt|inquiry: would open east 1@S|pg||
nt|cicus: nice misfitting hands on which E will probably go down a lot in 4@S|pg||
nt|glen: one expects N to figure out which two suits S has|pg||
nt|fann4: Who can only dbl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: last board - Ty all for watching :)|pg||
nt|sssvablue: 4@s must have less defense than 3nt on this auction|pg||
nt|barnets: and robinson in 41h here|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: east 5s now??|pg||
nt|barnets: in th last board|pg||
nt|barnets: south has a good hand|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Why would east bid 5@s when he doesnt know which suits north has|pg||
nt|barnets: could bid 5N|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry: norht his hoping Wold bids|pg||
nt|glen: now does redouble=own place to play|pg||
nt|glen: assuming everything else is pass or correct|pg||
nt|inquiry: he was hoping that would not be the bid... :)|pg||
nt|vbman: some1 is in trouble|pg||
nt|barnets: I would|pg||
nt|lestergold: east knows west has little defensive strength and he hasnt a mountain either in defence|pg||
mb|2S|nt|frankaus: 9 top trick + 1 on @S lead|pg||
nt|sssvablue: If East doesn't lead a spade, can make 11|pg||
nt|barnets: this may stop him|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu7: ty|pg||
nt|fann4: Thanks all|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Ty at our operator, very great job, never a error !|pg||
nt|lestergold: double ?/ what is this meant to mean?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cicus: I wonder if 2@S is forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fann4: An early trump switch for 2 down.|pg||
nt|sssvablue: stir the pot !|pg||
nt|barnets: I can defend something|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Ty at Jeff,Bertil and overall at Roland for the great job to organize the comments in Vugraph|pg||
nt|gosia: they are very strict actually - but all matches look like running late |pg||
nt|sater1957:  looks like IMP's for Ozdil on the last board too..|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cicus: you could pass the X with a better hand, I mean|pg||
nt|glen: will N X 4@S?|pg||
nt|jbgood: sure does|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: now surely souths lack of action means that he is flat and wants north to choose|pg||
pc|d3|nt|inquiry: will he get a chance to double it?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu7: Bramley rubbing his chin|pg||
nt|cicus: E should pass|pg||
nt|inquiry: I think east has to pass here|pg||
nt|cicus: he knows spades are stacked behind him :)|pg||
nt|glen: E is thinking S+D by S = not good 4 me, H+C by S = not good 4 me|pg||
nt|fann4: On bd 14 E opened 1@S, S passed and W jumped to 3@s!|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|onebid: and to Roland Wald, who works so hard to make BBO the greatest!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: why not hearts he not only has more of them but the suit is much better and south has not expressd any pref|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cicus: even this one is too high|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jbgood: Lair in the OR was happy with 3 @h - and they sold out to 4@d|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|inquiry: I think NS bidding helped EW stay "low" (relatively speaking)|pg||
nt|sater1957:  about 35 straight IMP's. Should make them confiddent for the last set|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|onebid: final set coming up|pg||
nt|cicus: lack of entries means E can't play spades to advantage, probably losing 2 trumps|pg||
nt|gosia: rhis can get ugly|pg||
pc|s3|nt|barnets: loks like this is home now|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Better get hearts right|pg||
nt|lestergold: can south not redouble to show general strength |pg||
nt|barnets: HK|pg||
nt|barnets: will show heart suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: what else could redouble mean but i have cards pard!|pg||
nt|lestergold: bid ur best suit!|pg||
nt|barnets: and declarer will lose 1 trump and a club|pg||
nt|gosia: or not :)|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room 5@d undoubled|pg||
nt|barnets: same lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: and should have not given them a chance to find as better spot the fact they didnt is luck|pg||
nt|barnets: so last hand thanks to all  USBF BBO for putting on the show|pg||
pc|s6|nt|joest: thx all|pg||
nt|inquiry: some interesting hands this session. Board 36 might deserve a relook... some|pg||
nt|inquiry: interesting chances to make that one after all|pg||
nt|onebid: got busy typing - didn't follow|pg||
nt|inquiry: made an overtrick in the open room on 36|pg||
nt|onebid: bye all:)|pg||
nt|barnets: the vugraph operators and all the specs for watching|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fann4: What a fascinating game bridge is. On bd 14, EW are playing in 3@S, with NS never entering the bidding. The 1@D opening put paid to South's entering the bidding.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K in @D lose a trick|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sssvablue: A big thanks to Jan Martel and her tireless work|pg||
pc|sA|nt|barnets: and my fellow commentators|pg||
nt|jbgood: this is   45 of a total of 60 boards|pg||
pc|d2|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|inquiry: the heart return is a surprise... did he think Bramley had 5Hs?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|frankaus: maybe the @C finess can be taken if N cashes @HA for the 9th first|pg||
nt|fann4: The defence here have lost a trick in the @D suit.|pg||
nt|milton_se: very good game by Boyd and Robinson once they got started|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: but amazingly enuf it has only become ugly for e/w|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sssvablue: Lets not forget Roland Wald who organized VUgraphs for 7 different countries this weekend|pg||
nt|lestergold: II think this time Mr. Cohen did a little bit too much bidding all on his own|pg||
nt|sssvablue: So robinson has recovered most or not all of the early imps they lost in this set|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland overdoes it what we do without him|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland deserves an international award for his work|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|gosia: oops|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|frankaus: no its a follish risk to take the finess|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: BYE :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: bye|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|gosia: almost :)|pg||
