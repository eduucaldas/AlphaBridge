mb|1S|nt|capercliff: the 10 was unlucky|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|gavin: west has to stop low|pg||
mb|d|nt|capercliff: here is a slam im sure they will get to|pg||
nt|gavin: lets see if ew have some sort of lebensohl agreement here|pg||
nt|gavin: some people play 2nt here says i have a bad hand, some play it scrambling|pg||
nt|caitlin: not uncommon over this double to have such an agreement|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: 6NT by north the top spot, but 6@D also excellent|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back, drinks for all on me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict 4h|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: assuming they have some kind of two way new minor available|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: what is 2@H, maybe a relay|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: shows the need for the 2NT bid|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: if it is, doubling is likely to help opponents|pg||
nt|gavin: was wrong about the line up|pg||
nt|gavin: they did runt he same 4 again|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even with lebensohl likely to try 4|pg||
nt|gavin: agree, west hand is so huge, hard to judge|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gavin: north can see at trick one that the only chance to beat this hand is his partner having the Jack of hearts since clubs are frozen if the Q and K are reversed|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: wolperts main worry is xx in diamonds opposite|pg||
nt|sharynr: hi folks!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome sharyn|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Hi Martin and Sharyn|pg||
nt|Walddk12: and hello to our wonderful operator, Karen, aka macaw on BBO @H|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gavin: he will overtake the spade to play another spade|pg||
nt|gavin: hoping declarer leads a high heart from dummy|pg||
nt|gavin: giving him 1 extra chance to beat the hand |pg||
nt|gavin: if his partner has 9x of hearts|pg||
pc|c5|nt|capercliff: pick a slam|pg||
nt|capercliff: I would think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5NT i guess is pick a slam|pg||
nt|capercliff: he will bid 6@d I would guess, holding 4 small @c's|pg||
nt|gavin: leading a 4th round and having his partner ruff high in hearts|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||

pc|h9|nt|capercliff: especially after the X|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 9½ - 11½|pg||
nt|xenya: a bit annoying for S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still was in principle right to lead trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: and E's @D8 could have suddenly become a big card, had he exited witha small @D at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi peter|pg||
nt|haans: lsome|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Bekkouche must hope that the double is negative; it usually is|pg||
nt|haans: easy really|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@HX will not be pretty|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems in use?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so strong 1@c, 5 card majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: south makes a responsive double?|pg||
nt|pelu: a responsiv D sh show 4-3 in major|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: not this time Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe she can escape for 500|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ralf Willquist and Anders Sigsgaard|pg||
nt|asig: hi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello all|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D would work|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: fairly normal part score competitive auction|pg||
nt|asig: Ready for the football match tonight, Ralf?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@h not a lead directive:)|pg||
nt|haans: 1C full opening bid direct 1M 2m weak opening bid 1@D BIG CLIUB|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S perhaps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@D or 3@S by N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: canape auctions often end in 4-3 fits|pg||
nt|xenya: tough decision for W |pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed but a difficult hand|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C show only i have11-16 hcp|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: 2@S-ruffs - 2 'top-tricks" and the need 3 tricks on @H A Q J - not impossible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/  for the tournament website, nicely designed by Kari Patana|pg||
nt|xenya: EW can stop the 2 @S ruffs |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Click on Results, then Round 2, and hopefully you will get running scores|pg||
nt|pelu: ok lets say: @DA and @D to king, @Sruff and a smal @C - again close to 7 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Faroe Islands did very well when they drew 15-15 with Sweden in round 1 (open series)|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Good evening everybody|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no probs in 3d perhaps non vul east could have given one morem pushin clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: with her 5 card suit it would be unlikely to attract a double and may have pushed vul opps overboard|pg||
mc|11|nt|kastan88: 1@H= 10...14, 4+ @H, unbal; 2NT = fit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: EW plays precision, 1@d can be void, 1NT = 13-15|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Another plus score for the Icelanders|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok |pg||
pg||
qx|c18|st||md|4SQ4HQJT93D93CAQT6,SJT8H54DKQJ752C83,SAK53H2DAT86CKJ54,S9762HAK876D4C972|sv|n|nt|sharynr: Well same result anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: Susie has all the secrets|pg||
mb|3D|nt|capercliff: could 5N really be a grand slam bid after 1N?|pg||
nt|shals: Good evening this game is being played in beautiful Penticton B>C> I am joining Caitlin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: easy but "slow" 3nt|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: don't ask me|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: welcome Shirley Laidaw|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but i think if wolpert had heart ace, would have cued at some point, similarly with void|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hard to envisage 5NT as GSF|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gavin: with the heart entries in easts hand , north can probably scramble together 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|gavin: welcome shirley|pg||
nt|shals: ty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome Shirley|pg||
nt|shals: ty|pg||
nt|caitlin: Shirley you have come to a Canadian zoo:)|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: good plan if they let you do it|pg||

nt|fabsayc: this broadcast will continue all day, see bbo schedule for time|pg||
nt|capercliff: bye all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i might have tried 5@S with hannas hand, he can be sure 6@C is down|pg||
nt|sharynr: agree|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is your itenary, gavin?|pg||
nt|gavin: 8 1/2 hour flight to nyc, go into the city for a few hours (5 hour layover) to hang out with friends, then back to the airport for a 6 hour flight to calgary, another hour to banff ...|pg||
nt|gavin: before i quit for the night |pg||

pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|shals: ok Gavin, I will bring my camera, then?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|gavin: so when he knocks out the heart, he will be able to squeeze hughes in hearts and spades for his 11th trick|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gavin: he is being a little carefull here not wanting to discard a diamond until its late enough in the hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not if hughes ducks|pg||
nt|gavin: u got it :)|pg||
nt|gavin: so if he ducks he can still negotiate it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gavin: cashes a couple clubs and its the same squeeze in a different way|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|gavin: jurek can claim|pg||
nt|gavin: but fast ....|pg||
nt|gavin: this actually works as a double squeeze now|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|gavin: he has a complete claim because if turner has the 4th spade|pg||
mc|11|nt|gavin: then he will be squeezed in spades and diamond|pg||
nt|caitlin: wd|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: has east had a peak at south's cards no screens? long necks!!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: E selecting "let pard play" option |pg||
nt|lestergold: if west promises a weak 2 in amajor why doesnt east want to play in the guaranteed 8 or even 9 card fit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure |pg||
nt|lestergold: vulnerable for all she knows 4h is frigid|pg||

nt|ralfwil: some IMPs to Denmark|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as the cards lie is @hQ a nice return|pg||
nt|roswolf: small  is the technical play - blocks the suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i dont understand the advantages of this method - it simply randomises who plays the contract and therefore will produce random swings on what should be flat boards|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: we can se, that @S4 would have won the game - best for sure @SK best chance|pg||

nt|fabsayc: both majors|pg||
nt|gavin: at this vul probably could be 4-4|pg||

nt|fabsayc: some partnerships use 2@S over 2@H as a relay, would have been handy here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will come close to duplicating the undertricks here|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps only 2, declarer drawing 2 trumps and playing diamonds for safety|pg||
nt|sharynr: i would think most play 8-10|pg||
nt|caitlin: what do I really care.....the Maple Leafs going nowhere ever so let's have THREE teams here..Hamilton, downtown and Downsview park..let them ALL in|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jurek needed to put in the queen, forcing declarer to win|pg||

nt|cenglund:  I thought it was Lebensohl, but I was wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Bob McPhee|pg||
nt|lestergold: with so many points what did she expect south to balance with- on a multi auction the [passout seat is not a balancing seat|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hi Bob@H@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: good day everyone|pg||
nt|kastan88: still i don't like such advantages, too much pressure to partner, and i am with you Mike, i would bid 2@H not passing, partner could have  6S3-1D3|pg||
nt|lestergold: the theory becomes different- in the pass out seat you are  in the trap in effect weven though east hasnt spoken|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H or 2@H|pg||
nt|haans: or pass|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4@h and 5@d were easy, or 3NT by N|pg||
nt|roswolf: yp|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|haans: any opening is to advantage|pg||
nt|m_niemi: it's a swedish system:)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: tjolpe & co|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: hmm I thought that was Lebensohl too|pg||
nt|talion: 1@c = 15+ any|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: yes my vote 2 (just)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: South has the option to sit for it or to escape by showing both majors|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Precision or some other strong club opening, I presume|pg||
nt|talion: skuladotti is tempted to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Bob|pg||
nt|haans: must be transfer|pg||
nt|m_niemi: but do they play it in Sweden?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: 2@H by N might even make?|pg||
nt|xenya: or W might run?|pg||
nt|pelu: if S wont to run - the West can just sit and wait|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 boards compared now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the tables are not linked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: flat  3 and 5  to Sweden|pg||
nt|pelu: so 1-1 now|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in the other room Finns have 12-14 1NT|pg||
nt|haans: not really popular|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Auken perhaps hoping pard is strong enuf to double again|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might end up in a thin slam but very anti - odds|pg||
nt|m_niemi: like Greek gift?|pg||
nt|haans: very few play magic|pg||
mb|2C|nt|m_niemi: so still 0-1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @s-lead was nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|cenglund:  3NT is piece of cake|pg||
nt|lestergold: but doesnt want to push south out of spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm ok but the system has to deliver in constructive auctions - most international pairs know how to defend against such systems especially in major championships|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: the no science route|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so ½-1|pg||
nt|roswolf: on a good day n/s would bid 6@S and it would roll home but today best keep low|pg||
nt|haans: yes that why Magic|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kastan88: Hi Bob, |pg||
nt|mcphee: just getting an idea whats being played|pg||
nt|haans: no double = good bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D = negavtiv, 1@H = nat or 20+|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: should make plenty |pg||
nt|mcphee: these sort of hands really offer little play choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: cant agree with the 3nt call - why cant 6@D be frigid |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|haans: magic is allowed passing with strong hand forbidden|pg||
pc|c3|nt|talion: yes it is, but it could have been very poor contract if nurmi has minimum 15 points for her opening|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: declarer may get home if she plays on the black suits however playing on dims looks doomed|pg||
nt|mcphee: why|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @D Q is ok|pg||
nt|haans: may make|pg||
nt|haans: @HK a joker|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this would be in jeopardy if spade queen not falling|pg||
nt|haans: all bids in magic is allowed|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|asig: It looks as if 9 tricks is the limit in hearts|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Provided that diamonds don't break 3-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: if you play strong club then use your system tools to investigate|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he would have to rebid 1@H forcing, if available|pg||
nt|kaapo: You can find NS's CC (2 pages) here (in two parts) http://www.bridgefinland.com/NM2009/bm/showteam.php?team=1|pg||

pc|s7|nt|xenya: this is likely to make, decalrer losing 2@Cs, a @S and 2 trumps |pg||

nt|fabsayc: bidding may be riskier|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this should go down|pg||
nt|caitlin: that is a skinny 2N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: several chances to lead spades|pg||

pc|sK|nt|lestergold: its not mps!|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer wont make many tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: no real exploration of the hands possibilites - just a close your eyes jump to 3nt|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jakow: Ask EBL!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: this will go off but it will be a few 50's only|pg||

pc|h9|nt|lestergold: but teammates wont be|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcphee: well if no @S lead it will make|pg||
nt|cenglund:  good defence so far|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|m_niemi: squeeeeez...|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps south should have cashed his club tricks first|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Declarer should pitch clubs|pg||
nt|m_niemi: -3 i guess|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes likelu|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cenglund:  8 tricks I guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is one reason why roland would want to be in it|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|mcphee: 2-2 @D or 3-1 split onside it is also a make|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|ralfwil: a small without hesitation...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well requires cool courage|pg||
nt|asig: maybe Christiansen should have tested spades first|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Not muck to loose compared with the win|pg||
nt|asig: then he would know that N had the @cK for his opening bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: much....|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is that east must ensure that there are enough spades to take care of the clubs should any mishaps aoccur |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Or @sK!|pg||
nt|asig: He would know, had he played spades first|pg||
nt|m_niemi: easy to defend now|pg||
nt|cenglund:  They might play 2NT D in the open room if N opens weak two |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i doubt it would be doubled|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: is this a tank or a tech hitch?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: however in 6 maybe west would double for the spade lead- admittedly risky pso probably would roll in|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|xenya: now decalraer has time to set up a @H for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: excatly the reason why roland would want to be in it well above his 12.85 recurring pwerent requitrement|pg||
mc|8|nt|mcphee: not so clear to dble for @S lead, I know I would not|pg||
nt|lestergold: i garee i wouldnt either|pg||

nt|gavin: our young superstar wins|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mcarroll: these transfer responses ar gaining popularity everywhere|pg||

pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: not bergen?|pg||
nt|caitlin: by passed hand?|pg||
nt|caitlin: unlikely|pg||

nt|caitlin: :))|pg||
nt|shals: yes it is|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|sharynr: looks like N-S make 21H so even down 1 is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: sorry, they are playing too fast and lost thread |pg||
nt|sharynr: but that was a reasonable shift|pg||
nt|mittmouse: technically hanna should now try a club if that is wrong he has to take a s finesse|pg||
nt|sharynr: good point G|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||

pc|d8|pg||

nt|shals: true..|pg||

nt|ralfwil: the mistake from S on board no 36 was expensive|pg||

nt|m_niemi: if opponents preempt after 1@c-1@d NS may be in trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: absolutely|pg||
mb|1S|nt|haans: 1nt 15-17 start with stayman transfers etc etc|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|cenglund:  Flannery, I presume|pg||
nt|m_niemi: par is 4NT by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|talion: 2@d is both majors|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: a part score here not too high for either side|pg||
nt|mcphee: and this is the reason why I prefer to open 1@D as E|pg||

nt|lestergold: 3h by n/s isnt guaranteed either|pg||
nt|asig: No|pg||
nt|asig: 5 apparent losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: accurate defence  a spade a heart  2 clubs and a dim to lose|pg||
nt|haans: invite spade support|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 35 the danish west didnt find the spade lead and therefore declarer had no problem|pg||
nt|haans: 1D 17+++++++++|pg||
nt|haans: 1H neg|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: what does 1@H show?|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S bid|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3@dX made in deal 1, 11 to Sweden|pg||
nt|haans: 1H show 0-7|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
mb|3N|nt|haans: 2nt must be a lebensohl bid |pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: I am a 1 @D openeron the E hand|pg||
nt|haans: for weak to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 30 imps in 3 boards so far|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S may be 3 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: the wonderful news for declarer is partner actually holds 4 trumps!|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would not sell out to 2c at this vulnerability as north i would bid 2h i have a couple of trciks and i can tolrate 2s if partner wants im not getting doubled|pg||
nt|asig: Maybe E led a diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: three spades|pg||
nt|haans: lucky he has more|pg||
pc|d5|nt|talion: about 5-13 points if i remember correctly|pg||
nt|kastan88: mostly all systems are good, if player just thinks sometimes (not bids as robot) and has agreements with partner|pg||
nt|xenya: this might go down|pg||
mc|8|nt|xenya: 3N can be beaten on LOW @C lead -- impossible to find|pg||
nt|kastan88: on CC I think this is called Ekren, but 3rd hand and vuln must be little bit stronger, than usual 3...10 points|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is another example of inadequate fighting ofr the part score|pg||
nt|mcphee: sensible idea to me also Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i can see how this made|pg||
nt|asig: Win the ace, to rounds of trumps an another diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: west ruffs with his mony and then fourth dim takes care of club an d a club is ruffed in dummy! what an extraordinary position|pg||
nt|asig: *two|pg||

nt|sharynr: and Hanna must have taken that line|pg||
nt|gavin: hughest hand is way too strong for 2nt in my opinion|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharynr: Would anyone open east hand and if so, what|pg||
nt|gavin: too strong for 2C then 2nt too|pg||
nt|shals: and hockey city|pg||
nt|gavin: so many slams where partner doesnt show interest|pg||
nt|gavin: 1D is a reasonable choice |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|susieq: I would open 3@D but I'm a little crazy|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: both k's are working|pg||
nt|susieq: that's fit showing|pg||
nt|caitlin: Turner will pass I assume|pg||
nt|gambit: Will C balance? I thk y|pg||
nt|gavin: this auction would almost always be 4-6 or 5-6|pg||
nt|gavin: hard to picture partner with a hand good enough for this action that doesnt have 6 diamonds |pg||
nt|gavin: turner has a monster|pg||
nt|gavin: (given the state of the auction)|pg||
nt|gavin: with  aspade stopper and 3 diamonds and the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|gavin: i think he owes hughes 2 or 3NT|pg||
mb|2N|nt|capercliff: interesting choice to bid 3N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may regret not playing 4@S|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4333 often plays at least a trick better in 4 of a major|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes 4@S an easier contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: neither is very good|pg||
nt|gambit: yes, 3D, and the QH, extras given his pass, but monster, No.....a couiple modest redeeming features, |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: nice hand for fit showing|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: even with both K's working hard to see 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: he cant have a better hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharynr: 4@S might have been reached (and made)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i think green should have tried 3@D in that case|pg||
nt|mittmouse: this is a steal im surprised green didnt bid 3d then hanna would bid 4s |pg||
nt|sharynr: but as is the case when both sides make a major suit game, the bidding might not have stopped at the 4 level|pg||
nt|gavin: funny to balance your opponents from 1D into 3NT|pg||
nt|caitlin: how true|pg||
pc|s3|nt|capercliff: good things H's are 3-3 or this would be really ugly|pg||
nt|capercliff: cancel that|pg||

nt|fabsayc: only in no trump|pg||
nt|mcarroll: lol|pg||

nt|gavin: very interesting hand|pg||
nt|gavin: czyz will have an easy time finding hte club shift|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: seems down if defense passive|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|gavin: the king of spades asks his partner to unblock an honor or give him upside down count|pg||

nt|gambit: as a plus |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict slowly|pg||
nt|gambit: you know David? Methodical |pg||
nt|gavin: when south gets in with the first diamond|pg||
nt|gavin: he will undoubtedly lead a spade|pg||
nt|gavin: since his partner lead the king, thats their power lead he knows that he has a GREAT spade suit|pg||
nt|gavin: hard to know if he has 5 or 6|pg||

nt|roswolf: another big @H fit for e/w|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: in bridge you musttighten the screw up to the maximum but not brwak the bolt by overdoing it|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: in 3. seat vuln: 1Nt = 15-17, so N had to open 1@C|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: easy 7 tricks - and a flat board|pg||
nt|xenya: we've got our first comparison -- let's hope it will continue|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie but imagine you were in club slam and recieved a heart lead - you would not be a very happer sapper|pg||
nt|mcphee: too bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: your only entry to dummy under attack immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets face it i think even roland would baulk at this slam|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: easy to duck and then only one club  trick for the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: what a horrible choice for east now|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|pelu: that from board 22 - board 17-18-19 = 8-0 for Sweden|pg||

pc|c8|nt|mcarroll: on the bidding declarer probably should finess through N for @SJ to cater for a 4-1 break - which does not cost in this instance|pg||
nt|capercliff: 3@h does jam the auction nicely, you know if you double partner is bound to bid 4m|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is better than 22|pg||
nt|gavin: so darren could see it wasnt going to be great even opposite a super accept|pg||
nt|gavin: i agree|pg||
nt|shals: wouldn't you bid 2c then 2n?|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah, opposite a passed hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: 6@D is a reasonable spot with the bonus of making|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|sharynr: but both bd 20 and 22 will swing the match the other way, i predict|pg||
nt|caitlin: 6D makes 7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but assuming a direct raise of diamonds was forcing, this is not a strong sequence |pg||
nt|caitlin: run clubs get rid of 2 hearts ruff a heart|pg||
nt|caitlin: all up to North to shoot for it or not|pg||
nt|caitlin: don't love my J9 of @D but hey...life isn't perfect|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|shals: wow spades|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcarroll: I would agree with 3NT|pg||
nt|capercliff: he also knows now it was based on 6 card suit so rates to have a singelton somewhere|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@H was a FSF even tho a forcing auction|pg||
nt|caitlin: letting pd know game is there |pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: maybe, but that is not the only way to play 2@H|pg||
nt|gavin: im not a fan of trump lead w/ xxx in clubs|pg||
mc|12|nt|gavin: thk u need to be more aggressive|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart king seems very normal lead|pg||
nt|gavin: when you dont have controls in reversers opening suit|pg||
nt|shals: 6 do you think could be made?|pg||
nt|shals: I guess|pg||
nt|caitlin: sure|pg||
nt|caitlin: that may NOT be a push|pg||
nt|shals: probably not|pg||
nt|shals: 2c might have helped|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i like plan A, that was an ugly hand|pg||
nt|gavin: np|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is Gavin Wolpert|pg||
nt|caitlin: welcome:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: forcing but weak caitlin, then 3@C would be limited reverse and not forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do you think Mr Kokish will visit the open room|pg||
nt|shals: should we expcet him/|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: potentially 0 cover cards|pg||
nt|sharynr: A unusual weak 2 by Hanna|pg||
nt|susieq: that's a pretty heavy 2@S bid nv|pg||
nt|gavin: ty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which is why Jurek did not try for slam over 4@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he might have been facing xxxx in diamonds for example|pg||
nt|shals: expect ie|pg||
nt|caitlin: just ask Eric to go to Peter Chung King and he will come to ANY table:)|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|caitlin: btw Mohmad Ali is at the NHL game wearing a Red Wing Jersey:) *IMPORTANT information:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharynr: i guess Jim has seen his partner's weak 2's before|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry won't go for what Ali's goes for:)|pg||
nt|gavin: go pittsburgh!|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|gavin: im in sweden for about 7 more hours, no hockey on normal TV here :( |pg||
nt|caitlin: we will keep you up to date Gavin|pg||
nt|caitlin: I have Tom in the lobby letting me know all:)|pg||
nt|gavin: looks like down a couple in 3 diamonds, ew can make 3C|pg||
nt|shals: what does that indicate?|pg||
nt|caitlin: raise in diamonds|pg||
nt|shals: ty|pg||
nt|caitlin: limit|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gavin: i think its a mixed raise , we will see based on norths response|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: is fine if you don't do it also on garbage hands|pg||
nt|gavin: perfect!|pg||
nt|shals: yep|pg||
pc|d2|nt|caitlin: I wonder whom you are rooting for Gavin?:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: interesting hand|pg||
nt|gavin: pittsburgh !!! oh my brother|pg||
nt|shals: good stop I think|pg||
nt|caitlin: we shall see......not so easy|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|caitlin: and which is more important?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good choice |pg||
nt|capercliff: normal with a stiff honor|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good Contract|pg||
nt|sharynr: anyone know what 2Nt asked for|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|capercliff: @s lead will hold it to 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: may have been singleton?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Pittsburgh on a power play|pg||
nt|shals: no stoppers in clubs for nt|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: i don't think this auction calls for trump lead either|pg||
nt|capercliff: i wouldnt think so|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|gavin: wheres the contract that consents if detroit wins my bro wins ? ill sign |pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: but is hard to see why a spade is best|pg||
nt|caitlin: nada tricks for NT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|caitlin: :) so blood is thicker than hockey|pg||
nt|fabsayc: duck again looks best|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sharynr: well my predictions stink....bd 20 open room in 4@D DBL|pg||
nt|gavin: its amazing how often ducking to keep control in trumps is right when they break bad and you have length w/ the ace|pg||
nt|gavin: both as defender or declarer|pg||
nt|gavin: unless you clearly need to clear trumps ASAP , its better not to win your ace until the last chance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or 3@D|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: but this defense may cost a trick|pg||
nt|shals: would one think of 1n first?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: claim time|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is not going to make|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|gavin: unless he guessed the singleton king of hearts in the first place he couldnt make after turner ducked two rounds of spades|pg||
nt|gavin: which could not happen|pg||
nt|caitlin: true enough|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|caitlin: not with 5Ds|pg||
nt|caitlin: that would certainly help E-W find clubs I think|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sharynr: well this cant help but fail|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sharynr: was there really a claim to make 4?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: y|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what|pg||
nt|sharynr: where did the @H oser go?|pg||
nt|sharynr: loser|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: korbel: "sorry i lost a trick"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is barely possible if defense did not take their clubs|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Open Room replicated the 1NT-3NT auction on board 6|pg||
nt|capercliff: interesting, both not wanting to miss an early Vul game|pg||
nt|sharynr: but they did|pg||
nt|gavin: his low heart play would work any time hearts were 3-2|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@H both majors?|pg||
nt|capercliff: E thinks his hand is too good for an old fashioned 3@d bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: yes shows both majors|pg||
nt|gavin: he needed to keep his ace of hearts in his hand for an entry to draw trumps after he leads up towards his jack|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: in that case 2@S by east can be natural or artificial, you need to discuss a defense|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Is S worth an immediate 4@S?|pg||
nt|gavin: very tough hand will be interesting to see the line in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Obviously he thinks so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe too strong|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@S AND 4@H are both feasible|pg||
nt|gavin: unlikely he will leave them there|pg||
nt|gavin: 7-4 white vs red|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 5@D in big trouble|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes 5@c is better, best defence can get 800|pg||
nt|capercliff: must be a @h lead for 800|pg||
nt|capercliff: anything else is 500|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hard to lead a @H fromS, @S the obvious lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club ruff and heart heart switch works also|pg||
nt|sharynr: i dont believe you can gain a trick by claiming if it is impossible to  make it....and in that defense they could not make a mistake?|pg||
nt|caitlin: best to lead trump|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharynr: will any director out there agree?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: not clear, but more likely daniel ducked heart|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hoping declarer would play the 9|pg||
nt|caitlin: or S and switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: yes that works as well Martin|pg||
nt|capercliff: no doub!!!!|pg||
nt|sharynr: I guess that is what happened martin, since daniel apologized|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: must be joking|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|capercliff: guess he didnt think he was taking even 1 @s trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that was the problem with 4@S, did not invite partner to participate|pg||
nt|capercliff: well he did open|pg||
nt|caitlin: brb...barbecue going:)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gambit: trump switch?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe heart to king now|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: NV vs vul, shows 8 major cards and a lot of hope :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: from N's perspective his partner is weak for 4@s|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well not sure what turner signal meant|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: hughes knows the entries wrong for trump leads|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah i think a trump lead on the go was best from his hand|pg||
nt|gavin: when partner bids vul against not , its very likely he was bidding to make|pg||
nt|gambit: Diamond to the queen/ King...then trump from my good friend, David Turner |pg||
nt|caitlin: Welcome gambit (Cam French)|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is the Canadian Society of Commentators CSofC:)|pg||
nt|gambit: TY Caitlin great to see my compatriots competing|pg||
nt|caitlin: indeed|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gavin: in fact his only chance on this hand is to actually draw trumps then eventually guess clubs|pg||
nt|caitlin: end of first period 0-0 btw|pg||
nt|gavin: thx|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|gavin: he was hoping to see singleton jack of hearts so he could go over to dummy to lead clubs up twice (once with heart and once with diamond)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gambit: what does he pitch? all cards have a value....|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: so 1100 turned into 400|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gavin: this play would have him make the contract if kjx of diamonds were onside|pg||
nt|gambit: club|pg||
nt|gambit: and spade exit|pg||
nt|gavin: the play doenst matter much at this point he will just lose 2 clubs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gavin: one goes on diamond ace and one ruffed|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d2|pg||
mc|10|nt|caitlin: spade now |pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|capercliff: 3@d here on the way?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@S makeable|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe is not forcing |pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe 4@D if fit showing|pg||
nt|gavin: interesting choice in the other room to bid garbage stayman with this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D or 6NT cold|pg||
mb|2D|nt|gavin: ive never rlly thought of doing it on a 3352|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: yes even better|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seems just plain weird|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not really garbage stayman, intent is to pass any rebid|pg||
nt|caitlin: lucky entry to diamonds with a heart|pg||
nt|gavin: isnt that what garbage stayman is ? sry if i missspoke|pg||
nt|caitlin: well Gavin I call it that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: KCB will identify a possible loser, so no 7|pg||
nt|gavin: this is a baby slam|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|gavin: and easy to avoid 7 as martin said|pg||
nt|gavin: but its definitely good practise to play 6NT|pg||
nt|gavin: 3 imps better and safer|pg||
nt|gavin: 2 imps|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mcarroll: 5@H too expensive a sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: but I know many WC Cohen Gitelman Bergen etc who call it takeout of 2C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: complications now|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sharynr: drury auction,, should be a making contract|pg||
nt|gavin: spec points out east hand so strong for 4M that maybe its too strong to open 1NT, tough decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: if the @c honors were split it wouldnt|pg||
nt|capercliff: but not realistic I think|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gavin: in the effort to getting to 6NT it would have been better for him to bid 3S|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: to hear from partner that they have a heart stopper|pg||
nt|gavin: he did what he did to find out about the king of spades i guess|pg||
mb|4N|nt|fabsayc: garbage stayman to me is when you rebid 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: cool i just figured ur bidding stayman with garbage either way|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|gavin: so why not include all options in garbage stayman|pg||
nt|fabsayc: SCORE|pg||

nt|fabsayc: am i alone in hating these irrelevant waits|pg||
nt|sharynr: no|pg||
nt|sharynr: are we stuck|pg||
nt|fabsayc: like gavin said, i dont agree with 6@D|pg||
nt|gavin: the problem that happened here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless 4@H can be a singleton, but that does not make sense|pg||
nt|gavin: was his partner didnt bid 2NT over 2D|pg||
nt|gavin: so he really has no idea how good his hearts are|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: pittsburg|pg||
nt|gavin: i have complete sympathy in the auction he created for himself why he chose to end in 6D over 6NT|pg||
nt|gavin: i just think he should have constructed the auction better to help himself get to 6NT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gavin: i guess some ppl dont play 2H is weak over 2D so if youre discussing garbage stayman , thats what you are talking about|pg||

nt|kastan88: 3NT= majors|pg||

nt|m_niemi: 1@c= 16+, 1@d= 0-7|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: that tghe advantage with transfer|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@s better I think|pg||

pc|s2|nt|lestergold: what do you suggest Bob?|pg||
nt|mcphee: i pass personally|pg||

nt|mcphee: stiff K does nothing for me|pg||

nt|fabsayc: out of control auction|pg||
nt|jakow: Somethin strange with th double of 1H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs partner to cover 3 losers, surely then north would bid more than 5@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: instead its the greaqt danes in a little trouble 3n easier|pg||
nt|lestergold: however weight of cards is a factor here |pg||
nt|asig: I think this should make, though|pg||
nt|asig: Not many losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: dims favourable so u lose 2 or 3 tump tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: still makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: just not the most elegant looking contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: !!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: there should be 2 tricks more in @h to than NT, that's not likely => 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: chicken|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: fortunately for NS, it's just another -50 against a makeable 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: and here another 5 card suit too|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kastan88: yes, from S hand down with @S lead|pg||
nt|talion: i gues the 5@h asked about quality of openers hearts|pg||

pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: Safe contract; investigating slam without getting overboard. Excellent technique|pg||

pc|d9|nt|mcphee: you count it  as 12 points all you like, to me it's a pail of poor values|pg||
nt|mcphee: K@H and Qx@C not exactly features I am anxious to rave about|pg||
nt|lestergold: Bob you are right to view the hand with circumspection but i promise you that not an expert this side of the antarctic would agree with a pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fast 4 hearts for the make|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||

nt|gavin: very rare that u will need to take heart ruff and u dont get clubs back as a trade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which looks impossible unless a club opening lead|pg||
nt|gavin: a club lead is impossible|pg||
nt|gavin: but playing 6nt over 6s seems bizarre|pg||
nt|gavin: and a club lead vs 6s is impossible as well|pg||
nt|gavin: ok so the lecuyer team actually leads by 26|pg||
nt|fabsayc: impossible no. just strange|pg||
pc|sA|nt|capercliff: looks like it was E that was thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this has worked nicely|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Low @H lead beats it|pg||
nt|gavin: 7 card suit for me is game opposite a limit raise|pg||
nt|gavin: no matter how bad my hand is|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe 3@C game forcing|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: robinson 83 fleisher 33 in USA1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: has 9 runners|pg||
nt|capercliff: or small @h next?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|gavin: impossible because i know how they play|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcarroll: Not after @H9 played|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah could be GF 3C bid|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes always stiff|pg||
nt|capercliff: 10 if small @h|pg||
nt|gavin: i grew up with david and dan playing junior bridge|pg||
nt|starkist: they got to slam obviously, down with the club finesse off|pg||
nt|gavin: david my oldest regular partner|pg||
nt|mittmouse: hi guys|pg||

nt|gavin: to get out of the way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, else down 2|pg||
nt|gavin: or else they will be unable to seperate them later|pg||
nt|gavin: standout play|pg||
nt|gavin: jurek knows that darren doesnt have the ace of clubs|pg||

nt|lestergold: and all the clubs went into the skip in 3n they would have had a better future|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H a make|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I think that in the open room NS plays 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: good slam |pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|pelu: easy 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next matches in 1 hour and 20 minutes are Norway v Finland and Denmark v Iceland, both from the open series|pg||
mb|3H|nt|m_niemi: 1@c = 12-16 unbal or 15-17 bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|m_niemi: 2@d = 8-11 5+ @d unbal|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no M|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so like 2@d opening|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is the kind of hand where the 1@C can potentially cause problems|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w ge the straightforward hand now|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: 1NT= 13-15(16)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: perhaps N sould consider raising 1N|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no problems any more|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mcphee: this is a rather solid 14 she holds|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1NT = 8+, 5+@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: rdbl!?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|haans: do you know that you can se all hands you have seen in BBO? go to c:\Bridge Base Online\hands\yr bbo name|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: S had a hard choice|pg||
nt|mcphee: normally 1NT response indicates a better hand than this poor 6 count|pg||
nt|lestergold: well im in favour of aggressive take out doubles but with north's minimum bad spade suit an stiff diamond, i would not make this bid here very dangerous vul aginsty not|pg||
nt|mcphee: I would not dble as N either|pg||
nt|kastan88: in this part of Earth (East europa) we play that mostly 6..10, so I can't see reason to raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: let pard balance if east passes also much too much in heasrts|pg||
nt|lestergold: zip outside hearts|pg||
nt|mcphee: 8-11, 7-10 range is more in tune here in NA|pg||
nt|mcphee: i like 8-11 a lot|pg||
nt|mcphee: however I make ligth t/o dble with the right shapes|pg||
nt|haans: you can see what happened at other table|pg||
nt|m_niemi: some alerts missing?|pg||
nt|haans: sylvan-gustawsson bid as per old carrots clubs|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S 3@C natural|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt did show 5 spades|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3nt looks the contract|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3@d= nat, 3@h = stopper|pg||
nt|m_niemi: sry, 2NT = 5+ @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: sorry i didnt see the first triick was distracted bgy breakfast appearing|pg||
nt|mcphee: 9@D lead the K winning onm table|pg||
nt|mcphee: and poor S wants to leave the room now!|pg||
nt|mcphee: 1N she asks, why did I bid so much|pg||
nt|lestergold: so do i please ignore my comments i took my eye off te ball dues to  PLATE OF SAUSAGES EGGS AND CHIPS APPEARING|pg||
nt|mcphee: no kippers?|pg||
nt|lestergold: provided by my der bridge widow|pg||
nt|kastan88: bon appetite|pg||
nt|lestergold: she doesnt like the smelll of kippers but i love em|pg||
nt|mcphee: delivery, back when done|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S asked singel?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: this must be a kind of asking bid - west thought so !|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no need to use Blackwood|pg||
nt|haans: some change there|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: a different auction but the same landing spot|pg||
nt|m_niemi: kibs know better|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like 3@H is support actually|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|haans: old carrots is 40 years|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: not all chopped herring here|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|asig: have to go now, see you later|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @d A and @dK and crossruff|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: profitable save if he can get out for -3|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: this is a silly contract and clearly the system has a serious flaw|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: with the clubs both offside and the spade losers needing to be ruffed not laydown|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably get diamond right|pg||
nt|roswolf: trick 1 was interesting though|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N was too aggressive in this board|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I think it's just bad judgement|pg||
nt|m_niemi: against 8-11 that is not so great hand|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: S can get a @H ruff, but it's still 11 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: the lead gives a @H-ruff - but cost a @C-trick|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: j of spades on tabel rather than another dim|pg||
pc|sA|nt|m_niemi: claim|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: initial trump lead would have meant down 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: cannt afford any more club finesses|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: but, of course, S switches to a trump, which means -4 |pg||
nt|lestergold: qc best now|pg||
nt|lestergold: but all hopeless|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h8|nt|m_niemi: @sQ to tease declarer|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|h5|pc|c6|pg||

nt|sharynr: it looks like my Bd 22 prediction was right at least.|pg||
nt|caitlin: but with long spades not much else probably happier to bid 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: looks like the defense can hold this to 4 with a spade lead|pg||
nt|gavin: 4H looks like a pretty good spot, as does 5D but it looks like nothing can make|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|gavin: though the diamonds look like a standout from south, leavin north up to cashing the ace of spades when he gets in with the ace of hearts or it goes away|pg||
mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: north must have underlead spade when in with heart ace|pg||
mb|1H|nt|caitlin: no|pg||
nt|gavin: in fact ew in the open room freely bid themselves to 5, lucky to survive|pg||
nt|caitlin: @DQ led and then declarer claimed it seems???|pg||
nt|gavin: though unlucky to catch AD opposite void|pg||
nt|gavin: specs suggesting 3nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt will make|pg||
mb|1S|nt|caitlin: or operator missed auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: good spot|pg||
nt|gavin: seems hard to unravvel your tricks but i guess they end up just coming to you|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: going out on a limb and predicting this will make in under 5 minutes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do you believe that story?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: they claimed very fast|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: N/S playing 2/1?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h8|nt|sharynr: i think you are right!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a bit harder from south seat|pg||
nt|gavin: yeh seems fine to win in either hand and knock out the king of diamonds, eventually u just cash your tricks and exit with a heart and the defense will be forced to give you your ...|pg||
nt|gavin: club and spade trick in dummy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: 2@C can be singleton, 2@D rebid promises 4|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: yes, 2c can be 2 or more|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4531 i think would rebid 2@C also|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: at least i think that's Wolpert just said :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: why? North wins HA can play SA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gavin: after the 1D opening bid, south definitely should not lead a diamond|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or underlead it for the set|pg||
nt|gavin: needs to pick from his doubletons|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|caitlin: he did not cash SA|pg||
nt|gavin: wrong one , now cyz has to cash ace of spades to hold to 5 |pg||
nt|gavin: fly ace|pg||
nt|gavin: in fact north should fly ace of hearts and play a club|pg||
nt|caitlin: on this lead clubs going nowhere nor hearts for defense..more likely to cash out|pg||
nt|caitlin: why Gavin?|pg||
nt|caitlin: this could be singleton?|pg||
nt|gavin: cause of the lead ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: :))|pg||
nt|gavin: maybe in 4 that isnt such a winning defence since the club ruff would be 3rd trick, he needs a spade honor from partner to beat|pg||
nt|gavin: so might as well hope its kx and thats why partner was afraid to lead it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: on this type of auction clubs often the weakest suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if responder has club fit would tend to rebid 2@S not 2nt|pg||
nt|capercliff: Wolpert taking his time with this one|pg||
nt|capercliff: he will overtake and finesse I would think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some minor communication issues|pg||
nt|mcarroll: On a @C lead will succeed if the !Q is played, which is I think the correct technical play|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: now what?|pg||
nt|capercliff: bit of a surprise this, a @c from the east hand cant hurt him|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|capercliff: assuming he overtakes and finesses the @d again|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: a spade back would be embarassing if jack wrong|pg||
nt|mcarroll: small @H from N at trick 2 would have worked|pg||
nt|capercliff: yah and when @h are 4-1|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4-2 sry|pg||
nt|capercliff: if the K@c was wrong he could go off now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Would have 4@H,3@D 1@C and 1@S|pg||
nt|capercliff: overtaking with the J at trick one was 100%|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gavin: very thoughtfull play|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s6|nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
pc|c2|nt|caitlin: there are SIX hungry university guys in my backyard doing the barbecue|pg||
nt|gavin: hughes sees that the one layout that will defeat him is 2 club ruffs|pg||
nt|gavin: so he ditches a club on the ace of diamonds and leads a heart up towards his hand (north is marked with ace of hearts from auction)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|gavin: well played|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|capercliff: hmm the J is interesting, he must know declarer has the 10?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||

nt|fabsayc: no promotion|pg||
nt|fabsayc: clashes with natural diamond trick|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  the @CK cost an extra undertrick|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I think Fins will not win the previous board|pg||
nt|fabsayc: mind you, 3nt was not cold|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be more competitive|pg||
nt|m_niemi: nice bidding by EW|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I agree, but they may reach 3NT in the other table, probably -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: oh well another tortured sequence likely|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@c denies M|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so 6@c or 5@c+4@d|pg||
nt|haans: five clubs no majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: but promises in hcp? 8-11?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: but only if N hold-up with @DK x!|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt a make whout @C lead :)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not a hand for getting too high on here|pg||
nt|haans: Results: http://www.bridgefinland.fi/NM2009/results.php  for this match soon|pg||
nt|m_niemi: not -3 still|pg||
nt|roswolf: lebensohl 2nt now?|pg||
nt|pelu: the @D-fit makes 4@H - on small values - a good contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S now might prevent that|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|m_niemi: so tie is the best Fin can score|pg||
nt|pelu: but again - I dont like 1NT with a solid major 5 card suit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: East has good hand, double 3@s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass seems automatic|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have matti|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if w has 6 c m, there should be good spot for EW|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am not sure south has any legitmate other choice here - 4@S WONT MAKE OPPOSITE A PASSED PARD|pg||
nt|m_niemi: on @d lead 4@s makes|pg||
nt|pelu: but is the pause by S who or West |pg||
nt|pelu: for sure W will lead his singleton @C|pg||
nt|m_niemi: move @dK to @sK, how many tricks in @s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i assume screens are in use - in which case west may be considering bidding over 3@S|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@h=ms|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|xenya: S plays a @H, if W discards a@D, S cashes @DK and plays another @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: wel 6d looks v good|pg||
nt|pelu: both!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah both thinking!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: minors|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: 3@C must have been transfer 4@C natural|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@s = ASK|pg||
nt|m_niemi: tx Sue|pg||
nt|haans: were they on the winning team last nordics?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: wow aggressive!! both of them|pg||
nt|lestergold: and lucky no double|pg||
nt|mcphee: not a hopeless spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: a horrible contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: may even make it|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course every finesse in sight works|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: will require a defence worthy of that aginst the israelie raid on entebbe|pg||
nt|lestergold: and yes it may happen|pg||
nt|pelu: ok -100 against 140 :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D is just too undisciplined for me pard did bid 1nt and so has defence|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S is a super accept but W is not interested|pg||
nt|lestergold: but plenty of play even on a less favouravle layout|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As the cards lie  - yes, but 2 of 3 finesses is needed|pg||
nt|lestergold: its better than that Raif|pg||
nt|lestergold: because played bu south with the spade protected the fourth heart will take care of possibloe spade loser so whenever club finesse is right its a very good contract and has chances ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: when clubs finess is wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a roland mandatory and porbably in the region of upwards of 50% in any case|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 1@c = 16+, 1@d = 0-7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|haans: clubs ruff beat it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|m_niemi: 3@h= 3cards|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: her 2N was just a further transfer|pg||
nt|pelu: S need to take the @C-trick in on @HA|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: plus all the possible helpful leads too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But @d in on N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4 is makeable, though maybe double dummy|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pelu: the standing it 30-0 + board 20 where Denmark can loose many IMPs|pg||
nt|roswolf: always seems to me that their last bid is a punt|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cenglund:  3NT would have been cold, but this is more difficult, but should make on good play|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like a very resonable spot to this bozo|pg||
nt|haans: suprise|pg||
nt|kaapo: Score updates from the women's at http://www.bridgefinland.com/NM2009/res/bmsc.php|pg||

nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @h7 = suit pref to @s?|pg||
nt|roswolf: could well be|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will do the right thing i am sure|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N should have led a high @s|pg||
nt|m_niemi: from that bad suit|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S has a real problem|pg||
nt|roswolf: he certainly hasnt been helped by his pard|pg||
nt|pelu: N coudn't help here - only tell that he has 3-card @H|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I don't think that S needs N's count in @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be a suit preference situation|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in 43 Finns in 3Nt in the other room as I predicted|pg||
nt|pelu: so another 6 IMPs for Finland|pg||
nt|m_niemi: not made yet|pg||
nt|roswolf: the more he thinks the more likely he is to get it wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: "all" way lead to 9 trivcks :(|pg||
nt|pelu: @CK - come on Gregers :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 9 tricks => :) not :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||

nt|lestergold: now Bob stop compimenting urself|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|caitlin: everyone agree with 2S?|pg||
nt|caitlin: by North?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is ok|pg||
nt|gavin: with 4 boards to go in the set|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin: wolpert bid 1NT here because he didnt think he was good enough for 2H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 3@H also ok|pg||
nt|gavin: aggressive 4S bid|pg||
nt|gavin: rlly hate that bid|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gavin: and instead of risking his partner raising 1S to 2S and playing the wrong fit, he bid 1NT|pg||
nt|gavin: on that lead declarer will likely go 2 down, take a spade finesse|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcarroll: Seemingly W cannot pass 2@C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 800 possible|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i doubt i would want to ever pass 3nt|pg||
nt|gavin: though the defense will need to cash their tricks int he right order|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C blocking bid but sometimes taken seriously|pg||
nt|gavin: easy to allow them to escape for 1 down by trying to cash 2 hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: would be a better contract if north had 2 hearts and 1 diamond|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: he can pass, and will when happy to see opponents bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe more|pg||
nt|starkist: omg|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hearts so much better here|pg||
nt|starkist: 13 imps|pg||
nt|gavin: better but still grim|pg||
nt|gavin: here it is no play|pg||
nt|gavin: like most of the time|pg||
nt|gavin: he is not playing with someone who is afraid to bid|pg||
nt|mittmouse: club back is best then 3 down|pg||
nt|gavin: needs a pure 3S bid to have hope|pg||
pc|c9|nt|capercliff: wow|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well this does have a play of sorts, but will fail|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Very lucky with the @C position|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: needs miracles including clubs 2-2 onside i believe|pg||
nt|capercliff: so long as N goes low with a @c|pg||
nt|capercliff: if N doesnt play small it will come in|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|caitlin: hey there fish...you finished in Open?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: still losers in diamond to deal with|pg||

nt|starkist: they ran out of hands|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gavin: hard hand|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mittmouse: 4 down|pg||
nt|gavin: 3 down for 10 imps|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gavin: south had a tough problem, conflicting rules|pg||
nt|gavin: most often when you have a 4-4 fit and a 5-3 fit you want to play the 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|gavin: though from the bidding there was a good chance his partner was 6-4, and with such bad spades it hink he made the wrong decision|pg||
nt|mittmouse: no 3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gavin: 135-107|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|caitlin: and use 5-3 to dump losers if possible|pg||
nt|gavin: here north didnt even introduce spades|pg||
pc|cT|pg||

pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: ultralight 1nt stole board 12, carruthers missed game|pg||

nt|m_niemi: 13 to fin, this is the 5@h-2|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a delicate hand for a change|pg||
nt|m_niemi: the point is where is decl's top honour|pg||
mb|1N|nt|m_niemi: board 8: +3 to Swe, they played 4@d -4!, this table 5@cX-2|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a real slam lets see how they bid this|pg||
mb|d!|nt|m_niemi: other table 41h+1|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kastan88: Welcome, Tjolpe (Sven-Olov Flodqvist)!|pg||
nt|mcphee: N was marginal for 3@H true|pg||
nt|haans: Big Clubs|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 4@h+1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: propably N has both and decl KJxxxxx in @d|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mcphee: I think this has a lot to do with the neg dble showing 4@H for them|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Looks like the Icelanders are getting a hiding|pg||
nt|pelu: X = a takeout of @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: which is what he has!|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@d= non forcing|pg||
nt|roswolf: REALLY NON -FORCING - MAMA MIA|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: ok last board :) - I hope that the connections will be better in next round|pg||
nt|cenglund:  They missed a cold game in hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@D is max for EW|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Finns scored 6 imp from 3NT mentioned earlier|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3NT by S|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|mcphee: although 3@H is aggressive, if the S hands values are outside of @S it is not so bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but sometimes opps preempt you or if south expectsb pard to show 4 hts however minimum she is then she did not have here 4h raise you cant have it both ways|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: and to reach a close game vul at imps is good|pg||
nt|lestergold: desperation pushin i suppose|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might consider axing this|pg||
nt|pelu: no not in IMP - prob down 1 = 100/530|pg||
nt|m_niemi: will EW score their 3 @s tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: S should not pass 2@S out in any case, and will dble again and now N should be considering 4@H anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that is the question|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no|pg||
nt|roswolf: no|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: no punt so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: on th elead this will not pose an unsurmountable problem|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: well i know east is a passed hand but west is surely too good to only bid 2h|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: amazing that south isnt contemplating a grand with all those controls|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|m_niemi: 2@s would have been very minimum raise|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2@h showed some values|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Another good board for the Finns|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: S has to play a @D back now -- breaking communications -- difficult|pg||
nt|xenya: she has to read the situation perfectly well to do so|pg||
nt|haans: not nice for finland|pg||
pc|s4|nt|m_niemi: Kx,Axxxxx,Kx,Axx vs. nf bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: if you cant bid 6@D here then you really should change your methods|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: decl will have to fight for it|pg||
nt|m_niemi: E should have bid once more with 4th trump|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|lestergold: even with the wasted Ks as a value this 4h is a much better contract thatn the last one for n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: has his sisth tricvk only needs to find a 7th may even find an eight|pg||
nt|pelu: I was too slow - as always :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|cenglund:  In my book opening 1NT with this hand is out of question |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes their conservative approach has scored a few goals in this match|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mcphee: indeed it is, I think personally W should have made a t/o dbl;e|pg||
nt|lestergold: admittedly e/w do not need to bid out of desperation but cant afford to miss good games- leads get reversed this way|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: now ill make 8|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||

nt|fabsayc: yes passport controls as of June 1|pg||

nt|gavin: if north south can find hearts they make a LOT|pg||
nt|starkist: disaster other table|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D very strange contract|pg||

nt|starkist: just what the doctor ordered|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: the transfer advance |pg||

pc|h3|nt|caitlin: hard to go wrong here|pg||
nt|starkist: can't say, I'm afraid to rile the pitt fans|pg||
nt|caitlin: no more Detroit ones here|pg||
nt|starkist: proximity|pg||
nt|caitlin: let's have specs clap if for Pittsburgh.....|pg||
nt|caitlin: and now for Detroit|pg||
nt|caitlin: OMG the clapping for Detroit was overwhelming|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably cross ruff for 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcarroll: Contravenes Burn's Law|pg||
nt|capercliff: I dont mind passing, dont want to encourage partner to bids lots|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|gavin: jurek is a sick sick animal :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|harmon: GO BREWERS|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: 1c-1h-2d (West coast Polish convention showing balanced 18-19)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|gavin: west can see without any entries to dummy that he might aswell lead clubs out of his hand|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s6|nt|capercliff: you cant always have 4-4 fits in the majors|pg||
nt|gavin: normally you would like to lead up towards the kq a couple times|pg||
nt|caitlin: which proves fruitful|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: 2h rebid (my hand sucks) - ok then 2s not forcing- thanks partner|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gavin: with the 9 showing in north|pg||
nt|gavin: west carefully protected his 3rd club trick by leading low from his hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now a safety play|pg||
nt|gavin: 2nd rather|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: but will cost an imp or two|pg||
nt|starkist: pitt scores|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gavin: 9 tricks secured with 1 spade 3 hearts 3 diamonds and 2 clubs|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mittmouse: well i think 3h is the right bid if it just shows a lot of hearts and no cards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as it should, with power you go thru 2NT|pg||
nt|starkist: i agree if it shows that|pg||
nt|starkist: because thats what he has|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah... though it would still typically have a card outside i thk|pg||
nt|gavin: 5 card support and a stiff and out seems like a bit much|pg||
nt|gavin: 145-107 if he makes this|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||

nt|fabsayc: koistinen timid?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N aqqressive at the last moment|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|pelu: Long way up to Finland :)|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 2@H - I cant :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandra Rimstedt and Emma Sjöberg are still juniors I believe. Early 20's? Someone in the audience may be able to message me|pg||
nt|haans: I its time for me to thank Matti Niemi and Goeffrey Wolfarth Ybarra my  co-commentator and you all for watching. Welcome back an other day. Hope you have enjoyed the show.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Sandra 22, Emma 24|pg||
nt|ralfwil: last board and rather few IMPs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu: again - can u defeat 2@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Anni and she is having a hard time. Please bear with her|pg||
nt|xenya: i think you can -- cash 4 @Hs, @SA and exit with a small @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's very frustrating when the connection is poor. You can press all the keys you like and things won't happen until after 30-60 seconds|pg||
nt|pelu: best chance is a small @D - that will block the entry to dymmy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are stuck again I am sorry to say|pg||
nt|pelu: Vladimir - I take @D 10 discard 2@Cs ruff a @S and N is squeezed|pg||
nt|xenya: yes that's true -- you need to play a small @D early|pg||
nt|pelu: are we still waiting for the lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty hans|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: makes a lot more sense over artificial 1@C than natural 1@S to preempt|pg||
nt|cenglund:  After all that fruitful chickening Koistinen had to break the line|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 2+2+3+2=9, any problems?|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Not really, but declarer doesn't know the location of the K|pg||
nt|cenglund:  Furthermore, diamonds may be 4-1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 36 imps = 23-7|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The Finns have played very well in both tables|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if 16 boards...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 15 boards/match now|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 10 more to Fin, Salomaa run 4 rounds of @h to make 4@s with 6-1 fit|pg||
nt|cenglund:  The only snag on Finnish scoreboard is 3NT -1 on this board|pg||
nt|m_niemi: in the other room was @s lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: has declarer gone to sleep here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed 3nt was makeable even after spade lead|pg||
nt|m_niemi: declarer ducked 2nd @d, so spades were cleared, -1|pg||
nt|m_niemi: dec played S to have @dQJxx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same potential problem here|pg||
nt|cenglund:  I wonder how they managed to go down in the open room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still he cant make till he plays to trick 1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade, spade, diamond, diamond to jack, and spade|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: in mps there is a lot more to gain at imps you may save a few but what a disaster if you make a big sac and they cant make|pg||
nt|lestergold: a phantom at this level |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: NS will bid game here -- 3N or 4@H?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cenglund:  Not a very good decision|pg||
pc|d3|nt|m_niemi: 17 imps is 19-11 to Finland|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: another battle of communications and not helping declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: well 4@H looks hopeless, but this has a practical chance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually i cant see a defense|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be a push|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm will north find the killing lead|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: restart scheduled in 58 mins time|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: so no second club trick and no way to make|pg||
nt|m_niemi: board 46 probably 6 imps to Den.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: but there it seems overtaking for spade lead is best for defense|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3@d the contract in open room|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: unlucky 3n|pg||
nt|lestergold: but flat|pg||
nt|kastan88: this is last brd, ty all and cu evening again|pg||
nt|mcphee: needed to play 4@S|pg||
nt|m_niemi: at least 10 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: but will it be enough for sweden|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed 12 or 13 to Sweden|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|m_niemi: @c had given a chance|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|lestergold: yes not easy bidding competition hand|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|m_niemi: even +1 with endplay|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 11 imps 17-13|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: now can actually make an overtrick|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h7|pc|c7|mc|11|nt|mcphee: i suppose the NT rebid was required to show 15-17|pg||
nt|haans: to not think a bronze  is possible|pg||

nt|gavin: i did that for the CNTCs when they were in toronto abt 7 years ago|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and thanks to Bruce Mcintyre and all involved behind the scenes|pg||
nt|gavin: and our machine broke so we had to do the entire tournament by hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|caitlin: Hi Susie: )|pg||
nt|starkist: with braille cards|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|susieq: hi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently he guessed wrong, down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|starkist: and hockey gloves|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|capercliff: strong @c systems always work well with those hands, can always play in 1N|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: looks like a spade lead beats this|pg||
nt|caitlin: as Soloway always said/did when vul never invite to 3N with good 8-9 just bid it|pg||
nt|caitlin: other table also led spade|pg||
nt|starkist: miss him|pg||
nt|gavin: what happened in other room ?|pg||
nt|mcbruce: BTW, the commentators updates on the hockey game earlier were ahead of the CBC's "live" video feed by about ten seconds.  Had I known this earlier I could have made some money...  ...|pg||
nt|mcbruce: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: is not a strong club system|pg||
nt|capercliff: in the other room both players stretched and ended up in a bad game|pg||
nt|gavin: thx for duplicating the boards without that we wouldnt have vugraph|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i was taking them off my tv, bruce|pg||
pc|d7|nt|caitlin: same lead 3N making|pg||
nt|gavin: seems odd|pg||
nt|gavin: theres no hope at 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|gavin: ok good night thx|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: safe travel gavin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and get some sleep|pg||
nt|gavin: gotta leave in 2 hours, prob just finish packing :)|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i was just telling gavin i never thought i would see the day where a table with roy hughes and juryk would finish way ahead of other table|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: the exotic 2nt strikes again|pg||
nt|fabsayc: play record is incomplete|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|caitlin: a reminder that Canadian Bridge Federation, CNTC trials : http://www.cbf.ca/BWeek/index.html|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually 2nt is pretty normal these days with east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Thanks all, we will resume in a few hours.  Check the schedule for the time in your area|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: closing now|pg||
nt|caitlin: the Carruthers team has represented Canada in past but lost finals in trials last year|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|starkist: what about when i said scored by mistake|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well 4@H was somewhat easier contract than 3@D|pg||
pc|d8|nt|caitlin: sure is|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d5|nt|capercliff: o more last @d|pg||
nt|capercliff: no|pg||
nt|caitlin: Tony do you remember?|pg||
nt|starkist: I was away|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
mc|12|nt|starkist: didn't understand bidding then missed the play|pg||
nt|susieq: a claim was input after trick 1|pg||
nt|caitlin: I know brain cells start dying after AGE 29--TRUE-- but give it a shot Tony|pg||
nt|susieq: we didn't get to see any of the play after the lead|pg||
nt|gavin: the bidding was 2S range ask (basically a 2nt bid)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: simply better bidding at this table|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gn folks|pg||
nt|harmon: gn|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: good night all, see you tomorrow :)|pg||
nt|mcbruce: thanks again to the commentators and operators|pg||
