nt|brolucius: You recall that we were looking for rhymes to Ozdil yesterday. Suggests were such as 'landfill' and 'Brazil'. |pg||
nt|brolucius: It occurred to me in the shower this morning that 'God's will' would be a better rhyme.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3C!|an|nf|nt|Walddk2: Howard Weinstein features in Andrew Robson's The Times article today - http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/games_and_puzzles/bridge/article6457625.ece ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|brolucius: Presumably N-S are playing a strong 1@C system, which gives North the freedom to jump-rebid on his middle-range hand.|pg||
mb|p!|nt|brolucius: Had he rebid 2@C, South would have to choose between 2NT on 10 points and simple preference of 2@H.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu2: n explains that 2c would be forcing here, and 3c isn't.  they don't play strong club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, N-S play a natural system|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: 3@C shows a shapely hand with no extras|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks for the info, Eric!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jack Oest|pg||
nt|joest: morning all|pg||
nt|joest: 3@c is natural and invitational btw|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, the 3@C rebid made life very easy for South.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|barnets: interesting play problem|pg||
nt|brolucius: Still some work to do. |pg||
nt|barnets: club best now|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|brolucius: If declarer gives up two clubs, East will want to play back spades when he gains the lead.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I mentioned the 'wrong' Weinstein before. It's Steve (not Howard) who is featured in The Times (London) today. Apologies|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: No relation|pg||
nt|barnets: well Mezer made a deceptive spade switch|pg||
nt|brolucius: The @S9 from Meltzer deterred declarer from running ti to his hand. He is now in trouble.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: s is asking w some questions|pg||
nt|barnets: now east can win and play a spade back|pg||
nt|barnets: she played the 9 looked like xx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Eric Mayefsky. Inside information from the table is much appreciated. Keep it up please|pg||
nt|brolucius: The super-VG-operator in these parts is the great Jan Martel. All the others aim for that gold standard.|pg||
nt|barnets: so if east wins and plays a spade dec must rise K cash two diamonds and play 3 more clubs|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|barnets: throwing east in to lead a heart|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|brolucius: East may think a diamond appropriate.|pg||

nt|brolucius: 4@H is heading for one down on this board in the Closed Room, I am told.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, 3 down.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Down 3 actually|pg||
nt|barnets: he had to cash the sK first|pg||
nt|barnets: to take ot easts exit card|pg||
nt|joest: and the diamond jack|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer still thinks that the @SQ is onside, I dare say.|pg||
nt|barnets: because of the tricky switch|pg||
nt|joest: at this point he has to hope so|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sontag's bid of 4@H, in the other room, is a bit mysterious. 3NT seemed clear here at the time.|pg||
nt|joest: i agree David.  With KJ in both side suits I'm surprised he committed to hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why only three matches in the quarter-finals I am asked. Excellent question. The reason is that the Nickell team (with Zia among others) have a bye to the semi-finals, so the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: organisers only need three other semi-finalists|pg||
nt|barnets: dec thoughts are if east has the @S Q he can finnesse cash the SJ and throw east in after cashing the last diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nickell-Freeman, Rodwell-Meckstroth and Hamman-Zia will be in action tomorrow|pg||
nt|brolucius: Throw East in with which suit?|pg||
nt|joest: throw him in with a (presumed) fourth spade?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Garner says "I hope they're not all like this"|pg||
nt|barnets: east would then have to lead a heart in thend position|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has a club winner.|pg||
nt|barnets: no he would have to discard it|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|joest: only hope i see is hook the spade and play west for KJ of hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: to retain the heart or dec has two heart tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The good thing about the slow play is that we will most likely get all comparisons in this room|pg||
nt|barnets: by pinning the J|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I see.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, Meltzer's @S9 has worked well and side-stepped a large swing away.|pg||

nt|brolucius: I don't like 1NT on those cards.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|an|4+ unbal|nt|Walddk2: (1NT is David's (least) favourite contract)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@D and then 3@D gets the job done.|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|joest: tough call for Meltzer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: kudos to n-s if they run the diamond suit without episode|pg||
nt|brolucius: No reason for East to rebid 2@H because he knows that West will not have three-card spade support and there might not be a fit in either major.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: 1@d apparently "normally unbalanced", could have longer clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room Bates opened a 15-17 NT. According to the K&R Hand Evaluator that hand is too strong for 1NT. It's worth 17.65|pg||

nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|barnets: melzer had a tough bid|pg||

pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi  great tool. Bookmark it!|pg||

pc|s5|nt|barnets: but e/w look as if they can make 4@h|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|joest: east's suits were a little anemic to make a 'majors' call red over the 1NT opener in the closed room|pg||
nt|joest: that would have solved it in that room|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, and Meltzer was not strong enough to bid 2@H instead of 1NT (opposite the 1@S overcall).|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c8|nt|barnets: i think it ws close|pg||
nt|joest: I'm not sure 2@h is strong|pg||
nt|joest: but K10xxx is debateable|pg||

pc|h9|pc|d9|pg||
nt|barnets: and the captain left me out the next set|pg||
nt|brolucius: I suppose she was a passed hand and therefore unlikely to have six hearts or to be particularly strong.|pg||

nt|brolucius: We now have 1000 kibitzers at this table. BBO have pointedly ignored my suggestion to  add a special sound effect whenever this milestone is reached.|pg||

nt|joest: in the miniors|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brolucius: A bugle call, for example.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: The fact that Larsen has bid 2@D now, rather than 2@H, implies that he thinks his double showed hearts. Meltzer agrees.|pg||
nt|joest: Meltzer did well to double b/c lacking that I have a hard time seeing how east-west get to hearts|pg||
