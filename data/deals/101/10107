nt|raghavan: another partial|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphu4: These players are very focused, could hear a pin drop, no chatter whatsoever, a big change from operating for George Jacobs :)|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: well only a defensive slip would allow 3N EW|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: welcome Jim|pg||
nt|fabsayc: killing lead is a low heart|pg||
nt|mariner1: eliminate @S and @D and then put S in with a @H?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: club split and heart ace right enough|pg||
nt|wygbe1: as rob points out even a low h doesnt look good enough|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wygbe1: as long as you rise at trick one|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|raghavan: I would prefer Trumps since W prefered S - |pg||

nt|wygbe1: might misguess the club ten with the 2s opening|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wygbe1: he needs to find ace of h right, then needs to bring in the clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not convenient to test hearts first|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: the play is correct to this point, then yang led a heart from hand out of turn, followed by jacobs with nothing said, he crossed back to hand with K of @d, and is now in the tank ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: on the club guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: although he can be pretty sure ace right|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if he does lead h early, n does best to duck|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so maybe is correct play|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: i am not sure how to best play that out, so will claim and explain|pg||

mb|2C|an|!|nt|fabsayc: yes that was my point|pg||
nt|afulton: looks like a 4@s contract|pg||
nt|raghavan: making 5?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 5@D a phantom over 4@S|pg||
nt|wygbe1: as martin said, a form of restricted choice|pg||
nt|afulton: yes, as long as right @c and @S plays pretty normal ones, will make 5|pg||
mb|2D|an|!|mb|p|mb|2H|an|!|nt|mariner1: EW in Closed Room bid it so confidently no DBL|pg||
nt|afulton: since the @dJ will fall |pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some players prefer to require greater integrity for their 2/1 suit but here it's obviously just establishing an (almost) game force.|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphu4: Players are pointing to the bids and shrugging as if somewhat of an alert, writting explinations that are illegible from my viewing angle|pg||
mb|3D|nt|raghavan: So a Heart lead looks certain|pg||
nt|afulton: yes, but when you play 2N=Forcing @s raise, options are limited|pg||
nt|jcwla: A few players would bid 1NT Forcing even with a game-going hand, but that is a minority view.|pg||
