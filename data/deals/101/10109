nt|Vugraphu6: Wilie here!|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Willie:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi there Willie|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yo_yo: nice to be able to watch Michael Rosenberg, he hails from these shores|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: spades are the normal suit to attack here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: the @D7 grows up quite fast|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer can come to 11 tricks thanks to the nice trump position|pg||
nt|andyv:  6 tricks easy but the 7th might be tough|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the rest I dont know  so Andy will have to fill us in|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if you like to picture the players  here are some photos: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=545&Itemid=224|pg||
nt|andyv:  Michael Kamil and Martin Fleisher are a well established partnership|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and some more: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=550&Itemid=224|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|yo_yo: well Rosenberg is a superstar |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can play @CA, trump finesse, then draw trumps and ruff the diamonds good|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not want to do that|pg||
nt|athene: using up the @CA means if the trump finesse loses, he might be in a bit of trouble on a club return, forcing dummy|pg||
nt|athene: and end up unable to bring in the diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: that's playing wide open|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h9|pc|s5|pc|c5|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Chuck will get player names up as soon as he gets a minute|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think the Moss squad will be sitting on their hands waiting for breaks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chuck will enter names when he gets a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west is Sylvie Moss, North Sasha Cohen, East Migry Campanile, South Rozanne Pollack|pg||
nt|mariner1: slam chance here NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: can make 7 finding Q@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: splinter to 4@C?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jump shift to 3@D??|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mariner1: 7@H 7@S or 7@D all can make (all on Q@D hunt)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: real key from Sasha's point of view is the @D suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: Key Card now|pg||
nt|daman: Moss team in 6@S on Board 81 in CR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C from Pollack as Exclusion would be great treatment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sasha can't ask -- needs to know way too much that KC won't tell her|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: we have Closed Room up now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: redouble or 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: superfluous dbl -- gives NS more room to sort things out|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moss in Closed Room bid the 6@S on board 81|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: 5@C already said -- no @C loser -- Pollack worried about a) trump  b) missing grand|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|daman: I would have bid 5@D    S must have first round @C control|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mariner1: now S has to sort of guess about N's @S quality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like 5@D too george -- but more because Pollack KNOWS Cohen can't cue in red suit|pg||
nt|daman: missed a big chance to put the opps away|pg||
nt|daman: if they bid the grand in the CR     watch out|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: 13 tricks not certain -- need good things to happen in a red suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and decent trump split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and guess which good thing happened :)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so for the puritans, just a question of whether 6@S arrived at convincingly or not -- which gets an extra 5 points :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al no style points?|pg||
nt|daman: my guess is if you were in 7 and had to play it wide open?  you would end up making on a high crossruff after pitching @Ds on the @Hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a sure line for 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well most lines work|pg||
nt|daman: and ruffing @Cs along the way    East cannot get out of her own way on the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure george -- that seems to rely upon @H 33  surely better to try @D first|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|daman: they are in 7 in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and maybe right to play 2nd @D here|pg||
nt|daman: get your popcorn out|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: quick gear shift|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|h3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|daman: 7 will make on a dummy reversal with 2 @C ruffs I believe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: send out a call for Michael Rosenberg and Bart Bramley -- what is BEST line for 12???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note: they analyze without peeking at the opponent's hands|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphu6: Cohler drew first blood.|pg||
mb|2C|an|alerted|nt|santyclz: 1m 1s 1nt?|pg||
nt|athene: Martel-Stansby usually play weak NT don't they?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't have an up-to-the-minute card for them|pg||
nt|athene: must hunt one out|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  in a tight match as this one is, every imp carries extra weight.|pg||
mb|2D|an|alerted|nt|yo_yo: not nice to lose 200 on the first board|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|andyv:  puppet?|pg||
mb|3C|an|alerted|nt|santyclz: Interesting (as far as 1nt undbl'd can be interesting).  |pg||
nt|athene: some might open that south hand a 12-14 NT in first seat, but in third, there's a lot more reason to open your best suit, for lead-directing purposes|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: looks like puppet yes|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  lead helps a lot|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Puppet from discussion.|pg||
nt|andyv:  but E has nothing attractive to lead from|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: well 1NT doubled in the other room  B31|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|andyv:  might be a push... depends if declarer tries to make or not.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|santyclz: This was exactly what I had in mind by "interesting", but am surprised to see it single dmy.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|andyv:  8 tricks easy here... probably have to work on spade suit for the 9th although @C finesse is a last resort|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello ED|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  Hi Ed... welcome|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes try set up 4th @S|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: there was a small peter in @H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure what that means|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like my signals to be strong|pg||
nt|andyv:  CR, S went down 3 dbld in 1N...12 imps for Fleisher|pg||
nt|yo_yo: goodness |pg||
nt|andyv:  S tried both the @D finesse and the @S finesse without too much success|pg||
nt|andyv:  Michael can already see the writing on the wall|pg||
nt|othered1: The double on east's hand wouldn't have occurred to me, but sure hit paydirt.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: i dont know that expression but think I know what you mean Ed :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d6|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if north should have extracted the last @D before the @S play?|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl was probably take out of spades which got converted (in CR)|pg||
nt|andyv:  now Ace of spades and spade|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will suffice too and protects against a 5-1 break in spades|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is this a regular partnership  Rosenberg and Cohler?|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes... restarted after Zia and Michael parted ways|pg||

nt|athene: well he doesn't expect to defence 1nt and kill it|pg||
nt|athene: he expects opps to run to spades|pg||
nt|athene: *to defend 1nt|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: i think the problem with using double as two-way (4major 5minor OR any big hand)|pg||
nt|athene: is that on this auction |pg||
nt|athene: if you bid 3@D now over 2@D, does that show the strong hand|pg||
nt|athene: or might you just have, for example, extra shape (4@H 6@D)?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: sorry if you bid 3@D over 2@S i mean :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@d would be indeterminate so w may bid 3@s.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu6: 2@s shows some values I believe|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 2nt clarified it for them if there were a problem.|pg||
nt|othered1: brb|pg||
nt|andyv:  as one kibitzer pointed out, Rosenberg made a good unblock of 10@c on last hand to prevent being end played |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Probably worth a x, but e shouldn't sit.|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: 2@S would promise a 6 card suit with me|pg||
nt|andyv:  need club shift from N to set this|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  or @D continuation and club shift to set it 2|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lol.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: each side has singleton trump queen in opps' fit|pg||
nt|athene: Culbertson would be nodding wisely|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Director call by Lew|pg||
nt|athene: not realising that his Theory Of Symmetry is complete candyfloss|pg||
nt|santyclz: It may have had some validity when decks were hand shuffled, but computer dealing has ended that chance.|pg||
nt|athene: director call interesting - hard to see where there could be any break in tempo and UI here?|pg||
nt|athene: the normal meaning would be that east paused over 3@S and influenced his partner to double|pg||
nt|athene: but east hasn't got anything :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: dbl of 1n misexplaines, was simply penalty|pg||
nt|athene: ah right|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|athene: can you make this by setting up the @C8 for a heart pitch?|pg||

nt|santyclz: Beware of Stansby's bearing gifts.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||

pc|d2|nt|santyclz: Short an entry isn't it?  2 to take finesses (in @ds) but none to return to the 8.|pg||
nt|athene: he just plays for clubs 3-3 or @CQx|pg||
nt|athene: you only need to lead clubs once from dummy|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|athene: diamond to dummy, lead @CJ, covered|pg||

nt|andyv:  as one spec points out, K@C before the @D ruff would have made it easier.  Question is whether W can possibly have the A@C (and not the J@C)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|santyclz: Expert game try...|pg||
nt|athene: now west might take him seriously|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in encyclopedia this is also called Rule of 15  [which has 2nd definition that covers a lead convention]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rob -- we've found an 11 that I would NOT open :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: try Cansino Count Al,,,,,, easier to say :)|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: I knew Cansino as convention over opp 1N -- didn't know there was another meaning|pg||

nt|mariner1: same, add points and spades to get to 15 to open|pg||
nt|mariner1: so  a support REDBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Rob phrase better -- note to make, since Support DBL/RDBL originally invented for use in context of Strong Club system - some 2/1 players play support DBL but NOT support ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the idea is that in context of big club - opener never holds strong hand, but in 2/1 maybe big hand|pg||

nt|debrose: N-S do play support doubles, but not support redoubles.  Though most who play one play both, it is not necessary to do so|pg||
mb|2S|nt|santyclz: Depends on who my partner is.  I prefer 2@h, but some people don't take 3-card raises into their thinking.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, i am sure all roads lead to 4@H on these hands|pg||

nt|athene: 4@C is quite aggressive with bad trumps and @CKQx facing a singleton|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|athene: he likes his diamond fit, but that heart suit isn't what you want to play a 5-3 fit slam|pg||
nt|santyclz: A nice polite word for it.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|santyclz: I would have gone for "strange".|pg||
nt|athene: plus on this bidding you are very likely to get a spade lead |pg||
nt|athene: so you aren't throwing a spade loser on diamonds or anything like that|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|dQ|nt|debrose: Fleisher had already shown at least this strong a hand  - I'd say balanced 18-19 would be most typical for redouble - so was probably not tempted to bid over 2@S|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't get W in for Michael to Ruff with small trump|pg||
nt|andyv:  but N did that for him... exchange of tricks|pg||
nt|debrose: I was asked about Rosenberg's double - a bit agressive, but with 4-4 in the other two suits okay.  After the opps have bid two suits, double should guarantee at least 4-4 or a very ...|pg||
nt|debrose: strong (16+) hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: no reason to get trumps right|pg||
nt|athene: especially since leading small from dummy then ducking means you can't ruff a club|pg||
nt|santyclz: With the same shape a points I'd bid it, with something like kx kqxxx q10x axx.|pg||
nt|athene: 11 tricks in 4@H in the closed room|pg||
nt|athene: that's a whole lot of tricks|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if it was a trump lead|pg||
nt|athene: yeah|pg||
nt|athene: @HJ ends the defensive prospects right there|pg||
nt|santyclz: Must have been.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: people might lead small from @HAxx but not from @HAJx|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: so that just tells declarer everything|pg||
nt|athene: i think a club back put declarer under more pressure, didn't it?|pg||

nt|andyv:  on board 34, N/S stayed one level lower in 2@h and picked up another 5 imps|pg||
mb|1H|nt|debrose: Rosenberg has interesting choices in responding here - splinter, forcing raise, or 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  price isn't right for OC|pg||
nt|debrose: With that quality diamond suit, I would rule out 2@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: a bit strong for splinter?|pg||
nt|debrose: a bit wrong is more like it|pg||
nt|hedyg: how strong do they play splinters?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a splinter looks ideal to me|pg||
nt|debrose: not to strong, but singleton king is not ideal|pg||
nt|andyv:  as with stiff Aces, I don't like splintering with stiff Kings|pg||
nt|hedyg: agree|pg||
nt|hedyg: do they play jacoby raises?|pg||
nt|debrose: I believe they can show different ranges of splinters, so that is not the issue.  |pg||
nt|othered1: you mean with @Sx you'd splinter, but this is too strong?  I don't see it.|pg||
mb|3N|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|debrose: He is choosing to show a "stronger" spade splinter|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: North is likely to open a strong NT in the other room and east will keep quiet|pg||
nt|debrose: 3@S would have shown an unspecified "mini-splinter" - about 10-12 support points|pg||
nt|hedyg: this shows precisely @s splinter? or any?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|andyv:  should end auction|pg||
nt|debrose: This shows precisely a spade splinter with about 13-15 support points|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so this might help Martel in the play|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: nice to be able to show either|pg||
nt|andyv:  cue bid of 4@d invites a 5@c cue bid?|pg||
nt|hedyg: they will be happy @hs dont split|pg||
nt|debrose: This is not ideal with a stiff King as we said.   Even if you are bidding the same way you would with a small singelton, partner may misevaluate|pg||
nt|othered1: good, normal stop.  On a very bad day even 4 is in danger|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|santyclz: And the bidding for that matter, without interference, s might just invite after finding no @h fit.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||

pc|h2|pc|s7|nt|andyv:  quick claim|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|debrose: With 11 HCP and 5-4 I tend to open if all the high cards are in the two suits|pg||

nt|chorush: no, I want the opponents to know as little as possible about partner's hand here|pg||

nt|hedyg: Debbie what is your attitude when you know opps at the other table open all 11+ hands? would you then open the N hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: Flannery :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|santyclz: Yellow card to Bill...|pg||
nt|athene: someone find Roland and bring him in here and tie him down for the whole of this auction|pg||
nt|athene: he will wriggle, but we must be firm|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chorush: probably same auction on heart opening|pg||
nt|debrose: That might matter on a close call, in a match I thought I was a clear favorite in, since I wouldn't want to generate a random swing|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c|pg||
nt|othered1: How far do you go beyond what  you think is best in order to cater to opponents' styles?  My own thoughts are not very far against natural systems.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: 2nt scramble now|pg||
nt|debrose: But if the hand is clearly not an opening bid in my style, I can't just change it because of the other table, since my partners expectations won't change|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
nt|andyv:  unless you and your pd play 2 different cards depending on how match is going:)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: S hand looks like 1 suiter to me|pg||
nt|andyv:  fortunate hand for S as either minor suit finesse works and W can't lead clubs more than once|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: also known as "partner, i haven't any suit i can bid, YOU play the silly 3-level contract!"|pg||
nt|chorush: I really have trouble imagining doubling here without 4 cards in each minor|pg||
nt|debrose: Fleisher has a nice hand facing a fit, but not so great otherwise.  Tough call now|pg||
nt|andyv:  with that luck, they should bid 6:)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|chorush: I can see 3 diamonds in these modernisitic times, since you could have a game|pg||
nt|athene: actually there is a subtle difference between the two auctions|pg||
nt|athene: after 1@H - 2@H, NS showed slightly more values|pg||
nt|athene: so you might claim you don't need lebensohl|pg||
nt|athene: hence 2NT scramble in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: but here|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H might be zero|pg||
nt|athene: so perhaps you DO need Lebensohl|pg||
nt|athene: and hence you can't find the right fit|pg||
nt|chorush: that's true, so Roland will be doubly agitated if Flannery gets a good result|pg||
nt|athene: indeed he will :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: maybe you need a natural 2N?|pg||
nt|athene: yuck|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT shld never be natural :)|pg||
nt|athene: it's either leb or 2 places to play :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Natural 2nt has gone the way of the penalty x.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: opps dont have to have fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, he loves his hand|pg||
nt|debrose: 5@C seems like a lot to me - I would have just bid 4@C, which North would raise anyway this time|pg||
nt|andyv:  3 loser hand... had to be in game|pg||
nt|hedyg: i wonder would 4@c over 3@s be forcing?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|othered1: I'd count that as a 4-loser hand.  Adjusting at this level is iffy|pg||
nt|debrose: Looks like a four-loser hand to me, and could have been a complete misfit.  I think missing game bidding only 4@C is very unlikely|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@c is only for sissies:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  still need some luck to make 5 here|pg||
nt|debrose: I don't think 4@C would be forcing.  On this hand north would certainly raise - he has an Ace, Jx in clubs and a doubleton diamond when he could have had nothing useful |pg||
nt|hedyg: i think once you have reversed 4@c is fine, if pd can't raise to 5 we are in the right place|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chorush: I don't blame Wildavsky for this. Why should he think he has 2 places to play with his hand?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that Martel should have doubled 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: given the state of the match|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|chorush: dbling 3 clubs would be silly. State of the match is meaningless; 37 boards to go|pg||
nt|hedyg: duck?|pg||
nt|debrose: Note how game is  not cold even with North having all those useful cards|pg||
nt|debrose: I didn't mean game wouldn't make here - just that it's not cold on the N-S cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: if W ducks he needs to play K@d, not easy|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|chorush: Im guessing down 4 and 5 imps to Strul|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, at least we know where the A@D is|pg||

nt|yo_yo: Mahaffee decided to bid 3NT in the OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Andy :)|pg||
nt|debrose: Nice play by Cohler.|pg||
nt|andyv:  np, Hedy...I love confirmations anyway:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT can make if he plays J@c|pg||
nt|debrose: Will you'd always prefer to duck smoothly when you are going to duck, it is often okay to think rather than win quickly|pg||
nt|andyv:  one spec mused that N/S were doing a good job not letting Michael Rosenberg play any hands:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|andyv:  prevent defense in bridge:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Cohler did not duck smoothly and Martin thinking about options.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok he played top @cs in OR, so 3NT will not make|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|andyv:  reasonable line of play|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3 down in the OR|pg||
nt|debrose: Fleisher knows that Rosenberg is not a big count giver, so can't read anything into his diamond spot.  But gets it right anyway.  Well done!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: terrific play|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice play of K@D... now club lead not safe (as well as possibly trapping Qx of @D in E hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some don't. ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|debrose: He can however rely on Rosenberg to give count in spades - dummy's long suit|pg||
nt|debrose: So he has quite a bit to go on - the hearts are likely to be as they appear (W might have bid 3@H with six)|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to go wrong from here|pg||
nt|debrose: If clubs are 2-2 he knows he can't go down, so he has to assume someone has three|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Gary looks unhappy as to what he should play now.|pg||

nt|andyv:  I like 1N... can't ever get it right if I open 1@D|pg||

nt|othered1: It's not stylish, but you are allowed to have extras sometimes|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c is always stayman:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, his extra is void in partners suit|pg||
nt|debrose: absolutely - rebidding a minor at the 2 level, while showing a "minimum" is certainly wider range than a 1N rebid and responder should frequently invite game with close hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: small break in the action.|pg||
nt|debrose: I think his extra is AKQTxx, maximum high cards, and a second four card suit.  The void is iffy - alas, sometime we respond 1@S with xxxx |pg||

nt|andyv:  easy to see how to make this hand... much more difficult to play and the taps are going to be annoying.|pg||
nt|othered1: He does need only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|debrose: On this auction some play that a 2@H rebid by responder is non-forcing, and use 2@D as only force.  This is a reasonable way to play, but I know Rosenberg doesn't like it|pg||
nt|debrose: and I doubt has that agreement with Cohler|pg||
nt|hedyg: and can disc some @hs eventually|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|andyv:  in mp, probably right to lead @h to 10.... here, probably need to lead @h to K...if it wins, you can attack @ds..if it loses, defense will have to lead trump and declarer will gain a tempo|pg||

pc|hK|nt|debrose: The 1@H overcall in the other room, combined with Mahaffey's decision not to show spades, led to a probably inferior contract|pg||

mb|1N|nt|debrose: So on a higher level declarer might not draw trump as a sort of bluff, because he prefers for the defense to play them |pg||

mb|2H|nt|hedyg: always 5+ @ds?|pg||
nt|debrose: 2@C would show majors, double would be "penalty" and majors natural|pg||
mb|d|an|alerted|nt|athene: 1nt surely preferable with east?|pg||
nt|debrose: I doubt they have the agreement it is always 5+ diamonds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl should ask pd to continue |pg||
nt|hedyg: so could be 4 4|pg||
nt|debrose: They are not a regular partnership, but if they have discussed it I'd imagine nine cards either way is possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it describes the hand overall much better|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chorush: I agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: is this 14-16 NT?|pg||
nt|debrose: 4-4 is usually not expected, but with (1-4)4-4 and a good hand would certainly be possible.  Bidding with a balanced hand over 1N would be very unusual|pg||

pc|h3|nt|athene: you might make 3nt :) but would have to be on form!|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: he just might make this|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice 8@d, great unblock|pg||
nt|debrose: this certainly seems to have play.  South can't get North in, but declarer has his own problems getting off dummy I suppose |pg||
nt|debrose: Note the unblock - just good technique of the @D8|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, again a thoughtful play|pg||
nt|debrose: excuse me - be back in a few minutes|pg||
nt|othered1: with south opening 1N, hard to see how 8 could ever be wrong, but careful play nontheless|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he plays a @d to hand now S will surely play @c|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @d seems likely yes|pg||
nt|othered1: if he clears @C from dummy, south can drive @S entry. and as cards figure to lie, south can't unblock @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he unblocks AK@C S knows that the only card his pd can have is Q@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Ed|pg||
pc|d2|nt|debrose: Will South know when the @HJ is?  Another note for newer players - It is usually best as declarer to win with the higher of equals|pg||
nt|othered1: but then south will give west the last trick with @D.  So this might have been cold, had east cleared @C.  |pg||
pc|h7|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|debrose: sorry, *where* the @HJ is|pg||
nt|othered1: now the timing is wrong for declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: if south reads the hand correctly with @C play|pg||
nt|debrose: The fact that North discarding a heart should help South.  Perhaps he should have discarded the Ten even.  Is there any heart layout where that could cost?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|othered1: Onthe other hand, will south play east to have made a non-double dummy play?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|hedyg: so you clear AK@C, play a @H to ace @cs and @d|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|andyv:  quandry for S|pg||
nt|othered1: We see that play and its very likely east, a thourough analyst considered it.|pg||
nt|debrose: Rosenberg is playing opener for the Ace Queen of spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why 10@h would have been most helpful|pg||
nt|hedyg: no doesnt work...S takes and plays a @d to dummy..|pg||
nt|othered1: And that gives north exactly nothing for his free @H bid|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

nt|hedyg: very tuff hand!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  2 more boards for this session which has been very kind to Fleisher team|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: but he will sleep it over and find a way :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: much harder at the table!|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: west might have been planning just to pass any rebid|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D, @H or @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: might get to game with the competition|pg||
nt|athene: but will now wake up and bid 4@H - especially if south raises clubs|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Kind, yes, but Fleisher hasn't just sat there with a basket open.  They've earned quite a bit of it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: 3N shows 15+-17|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: MR is trying again.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chorush: I doubt that. Even opposite 12-14 his hand is worth 3H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they dont promise reverse strenght for that 2@S bid I see|pg||
nt|andyv:  no question about that...Fleisher team has played very well|pg||
nt|debrose: This should be fairly standard playing 2/1 GF, but I find most club players don't have that agreement, and bid 3N "to play"|pg||
nt|andyv:  in 2/1 auction, probably not|pg||
nt|debrose: 2N should be minimum or 18-19 (planning to bid 4N next time usually)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this one shouldnt take long when the clubs behave|pg||
nt|debrose: Look for the safety play for four club tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: how will he play the @cs?|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: well he needs 4 @C tricks|pg||
nt|debrose: It is possible to cater to either opponent having QTxx.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|othered1: with lead driving an entry to east there may be entry problems with @C safety play on other lies fo the cards|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: the strong club 1@D opener buried the NS club fit - but that also kept E-W out of the auction effectively|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: that's an interesting play|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  now a quick claim|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|othered1: east will feel more comfortable about @C now|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|chorush: this looks like a large gain for robinson|pg||
nt|andyv:  Gary must dream of 5-0 breaks all the time:)|pg||
nt|debrose: As some specs have pointed out, the normal safety play would involve cahsing the Ace first, but there are some potential entry problems here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|chorush: will make up for a lot of that chipping|pg||
nt|debrose: This play loses only to stiff Queen in the North hand|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c8|pc|hQ|pc|s5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|hJ|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|debrose: Still much better for four tricks than playing to the King and back to hand, losing to three possible small singletons in the north hand |pg||

nt|mariner1: penultimate board here...........|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one pair included in System Summary Form   2@D reverse after 1@C opening on min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know what the means, but south hand made me think of it|pg||
nt|mariner1: our next 6 session MATCH for USA Team  2 will start in 136 minutes|pg||
nt|onebid: hardly minimum|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: just the shame made me think of it|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|onebid: just not quite 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: undo -- pollack decides NOT to play the singleton 10  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: sorry, she's still thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: very reasonalbe choice of 2N, don't you think?|pg||
nt|onebid: good choice by Rosie|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: just giving you grief Chuck -- for comic relief|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: saving the t for an entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rob will say it officially soon, but WELL DONE CHUCK|pg||
nt|onebid: and she had 4 of them|pg||
mb|p|nt|onebid: 10s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if it doesn't count in pinochle -- 4 of a kind is meaningless|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|daman: thast's an undo|pg||

nt|mariner1: so we can Congratulate Glasson Team, Moss team came back and made this|pg||

nt|onebid: well done chuck - is that what's for dinner?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Glasson of course wins the chance to play in another tough contest..........|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: and shockingly -- we don't yet know who opponent will be|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al owes us several dinners now...........|pg||
nt|onebid: :)|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|mariner1: btw, a big thanks to all the superb Operators and Jan Martel,,,,,,, the equipment|pg||
nt|mariner1: did not arrive so they pressed on with borrowed computers and gear, fought off|pg||
nt|mariner1: the demons and presented some excellent bridge..........|pg||
nt|onebid: no squeeze unfortunately|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|onebid: A shame that it's always the case!|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mariner1: also a big thanks to all the teams for a truly fine show!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sue Picus took amazing view with the North hand after Perlman opened 1@C|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S from west and 4NT from north?|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c by W appears to be good sac against 4@s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: then south has a great hand|pg||
nt|chorush: this hand could be very swingy|pg||
nt|santyclz: We still don't have a result from the closed room on 19 so things are tentative.|pg||
nt|athene: he might try 5NT over 4NT :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andyv:  question is how to get there|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: reasonably enough, south gives his partner a lot of leeway|pg||
nt|athene: knowing he is short in spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  aggressive over call didn't do it|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|chorush: this may be in some difficulty on spade tap|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm told in the closed room on bd 19 they also got to 4@s instead of 3nt but made 5.|pg||
nt|othered1: and directed the winning lead . . . |pg||
pc|s7|nt|othered1: (winning relative to the overtrick)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|santyclz: A low @h (intending a dmy reversal) would be revealing.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|andyv:  choice of leads is interesting... I wonder what E's thought process was on that one.|pg||
nt|debrose: I too am surprised by no 5@C bid from Rosenberg.  I'll report back tomorrow on his reasoning:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol ty!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: looks like 5 here|pg||
nt|debrose: My guess is he didn't see the 3@C bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  another imp for Fleisher who close out this set in an impressive fashion.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sT|pc|c2|nt|santyclz: Well, things got even more confusing.  They've entered the score for bd 19, but in the wrong direction.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d6|nt|chorush: there was a greedy double of 5D in the other room. After a double declarer might find his way home|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|chorush: I think we have the play incorrect here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: perhaps east ruffed @HK and forced with spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: he played @Hk then claimed when doug showed out|pg||
nt|chorush: we don't know for sure but they have board 8 scored as 8 imps to Robinson when we think it is 13 imps to struhl. So Robinson's lead might be 21|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: not going to be corrected but obviously wrong score|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|debrose: That does sometimes happen with screens - to some players more than others to be sure - and to many players it probably never happens|pg||
nt|hedyg: interesting @c lead with no @c bid in OR|pg||
nt|debrose: however I know from experience it could happen to Rosenberg|pg||
mc|11|nt|hedyg: ty all|pg||
