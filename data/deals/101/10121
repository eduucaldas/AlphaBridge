mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|gavin: these guys are bidders :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mariner1: EW can make an adventorous 3N here|pg||
nt|gavin: 1H is not my choice|pg||
nt|gavin: i like to have a reason for overcalling|pg||
nt|gavin: i.e. winning the partscore or getting to game or getting the lead|pg||
nt|gavin: theres no upside to overcalling garbage like that|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he does have the NV position vs VUL|pg||
mb|3D|an|alerted|nt|gavin: i am a very aggressive overcaller|pg||
nt|mariner1: so am I|pg||
nt|gavin: but a little restraint goes a long way|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mariner1: doubling 3@H when it comes up works|pg||
nt|gavin: also|pg||
nt|gavin: when my opponents have opened the bidding and 2/1'd (even in comp)|pg||
nt|gavin: i tend not to tell everyone that i have a good hand in johnson's seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin: best thing to do is just jump to 3H, with your whole range|pg||
nt|gavin: since u know partner has a bad hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: well now they can shoved EW out of the comfort zone, and game zone|pg||
nt|gavin: this way|pg||
nt|gavin: if he bids 3H|pg||
nt|gavin: then when boyd/robinson end up declarer (very likely after they open the bidding and 2/1)|pg||
nt|mariner1: agreed, both opponents in this auction VUL tell you N has a limited hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin: they wont know if the points are all in simsons hand or all in johnsons hand|pg||

nt|gavin: i think johnson has to double tho|pg||
nt|gavin: the guy with short hearts has to take the aggressive action|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: the contract was make in Closed Room though|pg||
nt|gavin: yeah this is difficult because there are two key signals needed for west to know its right to lead another club|pg||

pc|c4|nt|mariner1: W might not believe E has Qx @S|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|gavin: if partner has either the ace of hearts or the king of diamonds then its wrong to play another club|pg||
nt|gavin: and its very hard to put the 3S bidder on both those two cards|pg||
nt|gavin: and NOT the QS|pg||
nt|chessmaste: What should East discard? Maybe the @H Q?|pg||
nt|gavin: i predict its a make here too|pg||

nt|gavin: are they playing the same hands at every table ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: no|pg||
nt|mariner1: playing different in each match|pg||
nt|chessmaste: This is tough, but not impossible|pg||
nt|chessmaste: What will West make of the @H J?|pg||
nt|gavin: the JH makes it look like south has AQ of hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: well its not encouraging either suit so can he work it out to lead another @c?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: If East had an ace he would ruff the third club would he not?|pg||

nt|mariner1: Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge lovers|pg||
nt|mariner1: worldwide!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|othered1: Agree with east's handling of that hand?  alternatives to rebidding 1N with stiff are 1@H opening or 2@C rebid.  Only 1@H feels attractive to  me and you need an understanding ...|pg||
nt|othered1: partner for that.|pg||
nt|othered1: Or they may have methods to unwind east's shape.|pg||
nt|mariner1: special thanks to all the specs, those comments and tips really do help us!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: 2h asks if min/max.  2nt = min.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu5: also showd a singleton spade by agreement.|pg||
nt|chick: Ed, I'd rebid 2C in preference to 1N|pg||
nt|othered1: Well as Willie notes, they did have a way to get east's shape clarified.  Nice to have if you agree to rebid 1N with stiff spot in partner's suit -- at least you'll get your game ...|pg||
nt|othered1: bidding right.|pg||
nt|mariner1: very close session 30 - 28 and 1 to score|pg||
nt|chick: all true, sophisticated agreements can change what would seem like normal bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Peter is explaining that 2C is artificial with 5-4 or longer distribution.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|mariner1: has to win in W because he does not know he has 2 entries to dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: J turns out to be another entry|pg||
nt|mariner1: J@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: and he might lead a @H toward J@H anyway|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
nt|mariner1: so his best option was to play J@S to cover his 10|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chick: the @HJ is an entry only if he cashes AK and seems unlikely|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mariner1: echo :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N was off in Closed Room so another pickup likely here for Robinson|pg||
