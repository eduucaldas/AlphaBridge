mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|othered1: essentially duplicated distribution.  Another @H in west and one fewer @C and this would be laydown.  Now question is if methods can determine this|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: we are assuming an alert missed re the @H bid, meaning spades |pg||

pc|d2|pc|cJ|nt|othered1: But do they play puppet?  If so, north hasn't implied that he has a minor suit yet, so maybe he should get it into the auction.|pg||

nt|Vugraphu3: 3c and 3@d were alerted, 3@d something about denying @h or a major or something, couldn't read the writting|pg||
mb|1H|nt|othered1: very tough to accurately criticize auction, other than by result, without detailed system notes that just aren't available for most pair.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobh1: apparently thay play a variation of puppet so that 3d did not deny 4 spades only 4+ hearts|pg||
