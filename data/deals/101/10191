nt|Walddk2: the USA2 bracket  |pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s have to play for swings|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: E/W play fairly natural precision-style, with multi, 2@h=precision 2@d and 2@s=good diamond preempt (2N=minors, weak)|pg||

pc|h8|nt|henryb: Actually, if you go all out 12 tricks are available|pg||

nt|brolucius: Wow!|pg||
nt|henryb: As a general comment, I would not expect N-S to be doing anything drastic at this point|pg||

nt|jbgood: and poor me thought the most expensive cigarettes were to be found in Norway...|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are many cheaper ways to kill yourself...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb: they will play "normal bridge" although they may look for swings, either by being conservative in close cases or by being aggressive in others|pg||
nt|brolucius: I agree entirely that normal bridge should be played. So annoying if one pair has a great card and their team mates have wasted it by swinging wildly.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: probably thinking about discarding a diamond if trumps are bad|pg||
nt|henryb: I doubt it, since that runs the risk of losing two hearts, a club and a spade|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, good point by Dan. The diamond is very likely to be a loser (although not, in fact), so it could be OK to ditch it now.|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|Vugraphu2: but if the king is in the south, he can hold off on this position another round because he has enough trumps|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers point out that the spade and club finesses can be taken into the South hand, who would not be able to force in hearts if indeed he held the heart king, as expected.|pg||
nt|henryb: perhaps stay in dummy to take the club finesse|pg||

nt|Walddk2: double is Woolsey (sic!). 4 in a major and a longer minor|pg||

nt|brolucius: "Do you play the Danish Suicide Redouble, partner?"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: South doubtless intended his 3@D as forcing, but North did not like his hand and had already overbid.|pg||

nt|roswolf: well the hard part of bidding the game is done|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb: Dear David, only about 10% of the expert pairs play Multi, and the opportunities to play against it are very limited|pg||

nt|henryb: We have enough to remember that carrying a complex defense in our heads is not really necessary|pg||

nt|jbgood:  you dont need any fancy defense against multi |pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: you don't really need to "cope" with flannery. it copes for itself|pg||
nt|henryb: but to complain that Americans can not cope unaided against Multi is Eurocentric|pg||

nt|brolucius: A double (on a moderate hand) is safest when it is immediate - against 2@D - and they are unlikely to be in a playable contract.|pg||
mb|d|an|takeout of hearts|nt|henryb: now, with the North hand is double penalty? or is it responsive?|pg||
nt|jbgood: or just take out of opps major suit:)|pg||

nt|henryb: but which major?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: that will materialize|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: you don't need a double for takeout of spades, because you'll get another chance|pg||
