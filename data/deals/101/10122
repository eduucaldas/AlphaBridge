mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, it can probably still make, although it's much tougher for declarer|pg||
nt|joest: hello Karen and Adam|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Jack :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Hi Jack :)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=27&Itemid=224  for the tournament website and the complicated format|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 2009 USBC will determine which two teams will be representing USA in the Bermuda Bowl to be held in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, in late August and early September |pg||
nt|joest: hmm|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The losers will get another chance in a repechage for the USA2 berth|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt more promising than 4@s and it will have its problems too.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Scores from the other matches: Robinson 110 - Rogoff 77 and Fleisher 125 - Ozdil 90|pg||
nt|joest: many would play 'serious 3NT' here.  Fortunately Chamber and Schermer don't seem to|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Vugraphu2: 3n may have been alerted, not clear to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, or even Baby Blackwood, since for some pairs @s are set as trump now|pg||
nt|joest: 3NT was a nice safe spot.  Where they headed now is the danger zone I fear|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|mtvesuvius: yes, 4@s is pretty doomed|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|an|1 kc|nt|kareno: I didn't think east's spade delayed raise committed them to spades.  If so, east probably needed to bid 3@d.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and they are getting way too high now|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: Chambers is expecting something from the 3@c rebid that Schermer didn't hvae|pg||
nt|kareno: They are going to the moon and will be lucky not to get doubled.|pg||
mb|5D|an|q ask|nt|joest: Chambers is responding Blackwood and I think it within the realm that Schermer was trying to get out in 4NT|pg||
nt|kareno: I play 3@c as showing substantial extra values.  Schermer's extras are not what I would call substantial.|pg||
nt|joest: wrong.  If Schermer is self-alerting 5@d as a queen ask, he was blackwooding|pg||
nt|kareno: This is  clearly an accident.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: schermer alerted 5c.  if he thought 4n was nat, he's revised his thoughts since|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C!|mb|p|mb|6S|nt|mtvesuvius: Wow, I think they both thought each other had extras|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: I don't think Billy Cohen will double since spades is the only thing he can beat for sure.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and Cohen won't double, since if declarer has AQ98x(x) over him, he gives away the hand|pg||
nt|kareno: He is, of course tickled to death with the outcome.|pg||
nt|joest: hard to know exactly where the train left the track|pg||
nt|kareno: He wouldn't double even knowing about the spade queen since he hasn't got good defense to 6nt.|pg||
nt|joest: I will say that I prefer a 2NT rebid as West to see if partner can introduce clubs and to protect everything else|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@c is my guess.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think 3@c, then 3@s was where it went off the track, but it's tough to tell|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: chambers is cleaning the table with the spade queen...clean with the card you're known to hold, i guess|pg||
nt|joest: Chambers might have saved things if he temporized with 3@d too|pg||
nt|joest: I'm sure it did not occur to Schermer that he would be facing a doubleton|pg||
nt|joest: else why would he get slammish with Axxxx?|pg||
nt|kareno: A much better idea than 3@sd|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: smith asking some more about 3n, couldn't hear the reply|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|joest: I'm sure Smith not feeling so good about his lead now|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think 3@S is where it was derailed, since Schermer does have a little extra|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kareno: Schermer needs @s Kxx onside to begin with.  |pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: w: "maybe four wouldn't have made. "  now he starts the post mortem|pg||
nt|kareno: Now it's all about extra down tricks.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: That's his only hope :)|pg||
nt|joest: yes 3NT would have been interesting despite the extras b/c of the poor lie|pg||

nt|Walddk2: excellent analyst, and a polite young man|pg||
nt|joest: they are in 3NT in the closed|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Thanks Roland :)|pg||
nt|kareno: It's been a pleasure to work with him this tournament :)|pg||
nt|joest: I second that|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|kareno: And he has a great vocabulary!|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mtvesuvius: Yeah, although my spelling is sometimes a bit off :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mtvesuvius: My spelling bee record isn't the best :)|pg||
nt|kareno: :)  |pg||
mb|3C|nt|joest: 6@c is excellent|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and it can even survive the 4-1 split here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Chambers can put the pressure on with a 4@h bid here I think|pg||
nt|kareno: So it is, with even 4-1 clubs manageable.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me add that Adam became the youngest ACBL Lifemaster ever when he was 10 years and 1 month old!|pg||
nt|joest: Chambers pulled in his horns a bit by not jumping to 3@h or some such|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@h seems soft but he is vulnerable against not.|pg||
nt|joest: even at these colors|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd have bid 3@h over 1@d actually.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Me too|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|joest: I'm not sure Cohen would have bid 4@c.  Experts tend to like to make a negative double with the south hand and then the clubs are gone forever|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: nice auction|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, this was a nice auction to the top spot|pg||
nt|kareno: I think Billy Cohen would have bid 4@c over 3@h - he has a good five-card suit and not 4 spades.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, but 3NT would often be the right game|pg||
nt|joest: yes but that blows you past 3NT, which might be the right spot if partner bids it over a negative double|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kareno: True, true.  That's why they preempt!!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and often the 4-3@s fit is also lost then|pg||
nt|kareno: One round of clubs and a claim is my prediction.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I had a similar hand recently where we got to 4@s on the 4-3 fit, where any other contract was down, I think double has more ways to win|pg||

nt|kareno: All this came about because of that opening lead.|pg||
nt|joest: 1NT is always tough to play and even tougher to defend|pg||
nt|kareno: Big gains can come from accumulated small ones.  Most long matches are more about the partscores than the big swings.|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: the written defenses are out|pg||
nt|kareno: For sure.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Correct, as we saw in the Rogoff vs Diamond match. All the partscores matter|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|joest: this is dangerous to defend against|pg||
nt|kareno: Pass and double will be for takeout.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d|nt|joest: if I were east I would know my opponents had a big fit and big values and would pass 2@d out|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Multi is a nice convention, since it frees up several other bids for other uses|pg||
nt|joest: I doubt Cohen would balance|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: west checks his hand before bidding two spades.  west and south have a chuckle about this|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kareno: For the specs (asking) 2@d shows typically a weak two in a major.  East bids 2@h here to say pass or correct to 2@s if that's your suit.|pg||
nt|kareno: South most likely will bid 4@h IMO.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think so, North's pass, then delayed double was Takeout of spades|pg||
nt|joest: definitely so|pg||

nt|kareno: Schermer and Chambers are too easy to play against - that's giving them problems this set.|pg||
nt|joest: but he knows partner passed over 1@c and has already shown with the diamond ace so his spades can't be all that great|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It was 6 down at some point, but for obvious reasons E-W did not know that they were able to draw trumps|pg||
nt|kareno: 3d in that sequence is forcing 100%|pg||
nt|swanson: Bidding two suit which contain 3 HCP while hlding 12 in the other two is a risky situation.  Looked like a notump hand to me (East).|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Robinson +29    Fleisher +36  so those matches are very much alive. This one is not I think it's fair to say|pg||

mb|1C|nt|swanson: It seems to be tough to find deals where that is not the case - values or not.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mtvesuvius: 4@h is -1 by NS, and 4@s is -1 or -2 by EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And a good day you make 4@H|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: I would respond 4@d fit-showing here as East.   Admittedly a bit on the aggressive side John|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Today is not a good day though :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perhaps normal day even|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, Fit Jumps are quite effective, but I don't like the @H values|pg||
nt|swanson: I would bid 4@C splinter.|pg||

mb|p|nt|swanson: Unlucky singleton @HA opposite KQ3 doomed that contract.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This is the last board of the fourth segment of the Quarterfinal. Many thanks to our fantastic operator in White Plains, Eric Mayefsky. Great job! Also thanks to my excellent ...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: fellow commentators: Karen Allison, Roland Wald, John Swanson and Jack Oest, I am Adam Kaplan.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mtvesuvius: Our appreciation to the USBF for bringing this prestigious event to BBO vugraph. As always, Jan Martel has been instrumental in setting up a great show for the whole world to watch|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: And thanks to all the spectators for your helpful comments, we will be back with the fifth segment of the Quarterfinals at 12:45 pm Los Angeles, 3:45 pm New York, 21.45 Paris, 8:45 ...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: pm London, 5:45 am Wednesday Sydney! See you then, goodbye for now. :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kareno: Great job Adam as well :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This will be a fun hand to finish with :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Thanks all :) We have the longest break of the day coming up :)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|joest: opposite Ron Smith I would expect to make 3@s as south|pg||
mb|4S|nt|joest: and Ron obviously thinks he will make it|pg||
nt|kareno: And we will see if the match continues.|pg||
nt|swanson: Schermer can't double because it would be responsive - luckily.|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: (3@S)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He can certainly hit this though|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu2: n: "was that a spite double or you really got me?"|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|kareno: Absolutely!!  Beats it in his own hand.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|swanson: That question is answered when dummy's spades hit the table.|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, knowing what's going on and said in the room is always a great addition |pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: Hesitation absolutely marks Schermer with five spades as if the auction didn't.|pg||
nt|swanson: Too late for the 'smooth' 6 isn't it.|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: These are the types of things you think about at Trick 1|pg||
nt|joest: but if you saw it would you put in the seven?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I would|pg||
nt|joest: it's a grosvenor|pg||
nt|kareno: It actually doesn't matter though.  He can rise, play ace and a diamond and later split, getting all his tricks I think.|pg||
nt|joest: i'm not sure why he's thinking|pg||
nt|kareno: It's not a grosvener any more after the tank :)|pg||
nt|joest: particularly with lunch just around the corner  :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think so, it really shouldn't matter too much|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, OUR lunch!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My dinner|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I was cooking something while commentating :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Now the six would be suicidal.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, the hestitation gives away everything|pg||
nt|swanson: He's thinking he needs to average +3 IMPs a deal for the next two sessions.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: this will be nine to Schermer|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How can they beat it more than 1?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|joest: my bad I thought this was going down two|pg||
nt|joest: it's two you're right|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d5|pc|cT|nt|swanson: Diamond back - don't shorten declarer is the principle.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My guess is that Meltzer will come back for one more segment. We shall see|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|d6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|swanson: The heart continuation at trick two cost a trick - but very tough to avoid.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next set in 1 hour and 20 minutes|pg||
nt|joest: it depends on whether east-west play 'automatic count' when the queen appears in dummy|pg||
nt|joest: some pairs do|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: We'll see, they will have to really start swinging to win this|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't.  But 'no' is 'no.'|pg||
pc|c5|nt|joest: oops|pg||
pc|d9|nt|3for3: They need to play 360 more boards to win USA2, if they dont come back here...|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So you were right after all, Jack|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|joest: no it's only 8 not 9|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|joest: i was still wrong|pg||
nt|kareno: Not necessarily swinging yet - just play and count the swings.  Later swinging perhaps.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|c8|pc|s4|pg||
