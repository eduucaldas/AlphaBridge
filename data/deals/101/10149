mb|1N!|nt|lestergold: 3dims does the job|pg||
nt|cindy:  many use 3@d to ask for a @d stopper|pg||
nt|onebid: maybe 4@D a bit of a push at equal non-vul?|pg||
nt|cindy:  with a long club suit|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|cindy:  pretty good hand|pg||
nt|onebid: I do Cindy|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: this is how i generally handle my nine card suits|pg||

nt|onebid: or could have had K@S and no aces|pg||
nt|cindy:  im a big believer in leading aces vs small slams|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 4d bid was pointless by west|pg||
nt|onebid: agree Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: only helped them on their way|pg||
nt|cindy:  spec points out they heard that yesterday :-)|pg||
nt|onebid: I meant K trump|pg||
nt|cindy:  would think W wouldnt bid 4@d unless he wanted the lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: Only way is to finesse S - It succeeds here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|raghavan: E wants a Spade lead ? Mike|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cindy:  at least they have the fear factor in their favor|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame west for bnidding it and will probabbly be a push |pg||
pc|s5|nt|onebid: preempts exist to make it harder for opponents. Most of the time the damage is done - why get involved. Might push them to slam|pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: W might have ruffed with a higher heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d wa never gonna take up much spade only encourages them |pg||

pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|lestergold: well if he didnt buy something in dummy then north south would have almost certainly had a game|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cindy:  well if N was going to jump to 4@h, 4@d prevents that|pg||

mb|3N|nt|cindy:  hey debbie :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: so i know it well|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like majors |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am the token male in this event|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: yes - tho i would be slightly tempted to open this hand 1@D rather than 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4h i agree at this vul|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pbundy: some chance of missing a major suit game if partner has 7 or 8 and passes 1NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: even double dummy clubs lead cant dent it|pg||
nt|dcbutler: problem is that gets you to 2N opposite pard's 6 count with no major|pg||
nt|lestergold: however probably will only make it on the nose|pg||
nt|pbundy: that is true|pg||
pc|h4|nt|debrose: Presumably 2@C shows majors.  I  recommend using a defenses to 1N which include 2@C for majors, rather than 2@D or 2@H as so many do|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: what's the advantage of using 2C for the majors?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5h only costs 500|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west has some defence|pg||
nt|onebid: and a flat hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5s now  cold|pg||
nt|raghavan: CQ falls|pg||
pc|h9|nt|debrose: This allows advancer to bid 2@D with equal length in the majors to allow overcaller to bid the longer suit (or stronger with equal length)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: or heart sets up for club discard in any case|pg||
nt|onebid: hard to see any other result|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: and another way of avoidin g a club loser!!|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|onebid: kibs can check movie to see how OR made 4|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: of course, if opponents get wise to all that they may just stop opening 1NT :)|pg||
nt|debrose: I'll live with that:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: when Michael gets in, play a spade.|pg||
nt|debrose: Perhaps a question I get asked more than any other from my bridge students is whether to open 1 of a major or 1N with a balanced hand of the right strength|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: 15-17 no trump south cannto upgrade the hand is maxi but nothying to upgrade and yes occasionally u miss a good major game but not often|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|debrose: There are many factors to consider, but I usually open 1N, and I think you'll observe most top level players tend to do so|pg||
nt|debrose: Rosenberg's hand is perhaps the clearest type to open 1N with - the rebid problem over 1@H/1@S is just impossible|pg||
nt|debrose: With 17 pts. one might overbid 2N, and with 15 might underbid 1N.  So with hearts and 16 HCP there is the most reason to open 1N|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|pbundy: i once had a partner who rarely opened 1NT with both (decent) majors.  particularly at matchpoints, he had the belief that missing major suit fits cost tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: u open a diamond and ebid 2n and u often over reach urself|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: it has its points Peg|pg||
nt|pbundy: well; in theory, if you open 1@D, some fair amount of the time partner will respond in a major|pg||
nt|lestergold: ur view|pg||
nt|pbundy: oh - not even "my" view ... "a" view|pg||
pc|s7|nt|debrose: Of course we'd rather have an stronger doubleton, but such is life.  These days I see a lot of experts opening 1N with a five card major AND two doubletons.   |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my methods i don;t get dealt that hand. or else i just open 1NT whenever it looks like 1NT. somehow it seems to work out|pg||
nt|pbundy: the ten of diamonds and 9 of spades might sway me on this one|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: if i get dealt the rpoblem hand, i say i only have 12 cards. chance of a redeal giving me similar hand is infinitesimal|pg||
nt|raghavan: curtains - made 5|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|debrose: I like methods which allow one to choose which hands to be dealt.  Can you send me your system notes please Marshall?|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: 14-16|pg||

nt|raghavan: Mike will S now enter pre empt|pg||
nt|onebid: these are exactly the kind of boards Robinson wants|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this vul he might well|pg||
nt|lestergold: not much risk|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|lestergold: but also it wont stop e/w either|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can make 5 of course as spade and club finesses both right|pg||
nt|dcbutler: in the two USA2 round of 16 matches, Jacobs leads Cohler by 18 and Strull leads Oxdil by 2 after one of four segments |pg||
nt|pbundy: except for fleischer/nickell match, all pretty exciting|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i dont thin k south will get too excited with his q  two jacks and no singleton|pg||
nt|pbundy: and, needless to say, i would never count out the nickell team|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wouldnt count out any team who reached this semi final|pg||

nt|onebid: 4@H needs some play|pg||

mb|p|nt|raghavan: Yes Mike may prevent EW reaching Hgame|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cindy:  a breather hand|pg||

mb|5H|nt|dcbutler: welcome Peter|pg||
mb|5S|nt|pef: hi all, pretty surprising that only this match is close--people keep waiting for the nickell team to make a run, but it hasn't happened yet--up to 80 imps now over there|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: mulit=single major |pg||
nt|cindy:  even then i DONT like it :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: which my guess that was |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: will find out and let you know ASAP.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the late great Grant Baze had a great website, on which he shared this bit of wisdom:|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: identical auction to the open room|pg||
nt|pef: bad news for ew is that clubs split 5-1, good news is that north doesn't have a spade to ruff with, very tempting for robinson to bid one more here|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Heart K is favourable so makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: and i  due course the same 4 losers and another pusk|pg||
nt|lestergold: well northcan ruff a club that is if he had a trump --- pity!!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: another no-brainer contract|pg||

pc|h8|nt|lestergold: makes on many layouts when HK is wronmg too|pg||
nt|lestergold: dm 3/3 or ruffing spade in dummy|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|cindy:  makes 4 now|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: the acs divided and the heart ace doesnt always stand in these situations|pg||
mc|11|nt|marlowepi: he recalled a panel at a Nationals with many experts fielding many questions, and he said he always remembered and came to cherish the answer given by the late great Bobby Goldman ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in answer to this question:|pg||
nt|lestergold: point is north does  not expect to beat 5s but he let them play it|pg||
nt|lestergold: to little uside in bidding on|pg||
nt|lestergold: massive downside|pg||
nt|pef: Not sure if I agree with that.  I think the upside potential is at least close to the downside potential.  give partner a doubleton diamond for example and that's 7 probably imps|pg||
nt|pbundy: to me, part of the problem is what DO you do if they now bid 6?  do you decide that they made an error, and simply defend?  or - have you now pushed them to a slam that will ...|pg||

nt|raghavan: 0 1 1 2 2 4|pg||
nt|raghavan: 0 1 1 2 2 3|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S!|an|asks in diamonds|nt|mariner1: btw, when 6 makes it only takes a 41% or so chance to shoot for 7|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D!|an|2nd round control|nt|othered1: Nice methods and explanations.  Interesting to see the actions they take as information develops.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well we are assuming everything is understood by both as we think|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H!|an|reasked|mb|p|mb|4S!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: which NS here should have done also, i think|pg||
nt|othered1: either NS in closed room could have gotten in, and it's unusual in today's styles to let opponents have a free run at a big @C auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: 4@s showed a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Stewart thought he was asking in clubs with 4@h|pg||
nt|othered1: And here's the real reason not to bid 7 -- you're giving long odds (11-3?) if they're only in game in the other room|pg||
pc|dJ|mc|12|pg||

nt|raghavan: Push|pg||
nt|pef: while it's not impossible you might push them to 6s, I think it's likely that if that pair was going to bid 6 they would have done so already|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  skinny 3N at other table|pg||
nt|lestergold: might be a swing here|pg||
nt|lestergold: playersd do not like doing this because if they get it wrong its so expensive that is why robinson preferred to let sleeping dogs lie|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|pef: well, we'll have to ask him--I bet at least as much of his reasoning was he thought there was a real chance they'd beat 5s, not that he thought 6s was making|pg||
nt|lestergold: not always the case in thesde haviliy competitiv auctions|pg||
nt|pbundy: i have a strong suspicion that east started with @S :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but north is dealer\??|pg||
nt|pef: you don't think north has a mandatory 1s psych in first seat?|pg||
nt|pbundy: call me crazy - but - |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lestergold: north's weak nt hand and south's hand are not always bid to a game|pg||
nt|pef: another 11 card spade fit for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: this isnt the british juniors|pg||
nt|dcbutler: might have worked pretty well on this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: oops|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p!|nt|debrose: It is pretty Standard to play this particular negative double as exactly 4-4 in the majors.  |pg||
nt|pbundy: that is quite true, david :)|pg||
nt|pef: so a grand slam on a (failing) club finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d?? if im coming in give it at least the 3d|pg||
nt|pbundy: i wonder why robinson didn't begin with some   of diamonds?|pg||
nt|pbundy: i guess he preferred the spade psych :) :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: cute|pg||
nt|pef: would have led to an interesting auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 6s is against the wall and roland is in 7|pg||
nt|pef: many years ago, when psyching was much more prevalent in high level bridge, people had to develop methods to deal with frequent psychs|pg||
nt|pbundy: a spec informs me that 2@D was precluded by the dreaded flannery|pg||
nt|pef: in fact, we're probably all old enough to remember when the convention card had a place to check "frequent psychs"|pg||
nt|pbundy: that is why 3@D was invented|pg||
nt|pbundy: tho at these colors, that's a little much|pg||
mb|4D|nt|debrose: Occasionally it might be 4-5 with a weak hand.  So bidding a major in this auction most definitely does not promise 5|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n probably coming now|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho south is a passed hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: If bid makes with good D and SAQ and K of other suit|pg||
nt|cindy:  N knows S must have very good @ds to come in red|pg||
nt|pef: a little?|pg||
nt|pbundy: part of why i spurn flannery.  |pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: auction far from over|pg||
nt|pef: you mean so you can open 2d with 4 counts in first seat?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not a good contract|pg||
mb|4N|nt|debrose: Rosenberg is violating the "Law of total tricks" here, because of his honors in partner's first "suit"|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the other room as W opened 1 @D |pg||
nt|debrose: and his three little diamonds tell him partner has at most a doubleton and he has nothing wasted there|pg||
nt|lestergold: 10 imps on the way back toWelland|pg||
nt|cindy:  and a hand not suitable for a preempt   |pg||
nt|lestergold: very different auction in the open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: after this the gap not an unsurmountable 32 or so|pg||
nt|raghavan: Cindy is it unsuitable because of a Major in hand? |pg||
nt|cindy:  it would be for me but I'm told they play 2@d is a 3 suited hand|pg||
nt|cindy:  so 2@d was not an option|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh|pg||
nt|raghavan: Cindy it is only opening 2D it is 3 suiter -|pg||
nt|raghavan: not any overcall|pg||
nt|cindy:  opening 2@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes Opening 2D = 4414, etc almost like precision except the short suit can be anyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume opening 2d would deny a 4 card major|pg||
nt|raghavan: need not be singleton D|pg||
nt|lestergold: south cant open that in classical weak 2 stule in front of partner|pg||
nt|raghavan: No their CC says 11-15, 4441, 5440 etc|pg||
nt|raghavan: any shotness|pg||
nt|lestergold: so a different reason but of course he didnt open 2d becasue it would have had a different meaning in their style|pg||
nt|raghavan: It becomes overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: what is delay? technical/|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: adam|pg||
mb|5D|nt|dcbutler: EW in the other room sold to 5DX on the previos hand, so Welland is within 9 imps|pg||
nt|pef: so much for the "master suit"|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|lestergold: im not sure i likem the old black here slam would be cold if west's 8 points outside spades were kq of hearts and K of clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|pef: now trying for a grand slam, asking aobut the k of clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: what east should have done is make a bid that tells partner he is looking for a cue in hearts or is missing something that he needs from him|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland is egging him on!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: He would not expect his decision to work well when partner had xxx clubs, but that is very much against the odds|pg||
nt|debrose:  perhaps Gary can get out for down one when 3@D was making anyway|pg||
mb|7S|nt|lestergold: and west now will decline holding xx club|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: excellent prediction :)|pg||
nt|dcbutler: probably 5C showed 1 keycard, 5D asked for the Q of trumps, 5H showed it plus the K of hearts|pg||
nt|pef: robinson margin likey now to increase by the whims of fate|pg||
nt|pbundy: note that boyd wisely didn't X clubs to let them know any potential hooks were losing|pg||
nt|pbundy: i would highly doubt they'd be in the grand then|pg||
nt|lestergold: well commentator's curse|pg||

nt|debrose: How about you Sylvia?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|bbramley: i would have led like he did - good old 4th best - 2nd choice is a high club - last choice is any other suit|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|debrose: Yes good point.  Often when defending 1N in particular, knowing you will get in again, it is better to lead something through declarer while you have the chance rather than cashing ...|pg||

nt|Vugraphu8: Neil should have continued spades before clearing the clubs.|pg||

nt|bbramley: very unlucky result for N/S in the Closed Room - 6@D is excellent|pg||
nt|lestergold: with west's strength south could hardly hope to play to beat 1!|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s makeable on finding the dim|pg||
nt|pbundy: painful board on the grand; opponents were only in GAME|pg||
nt|pbundy: so - bidding for 13 instead of 12 was particularly costly.|pg||
nt|dcbutler: amazing how often that happens|pg||
nt|migry: it is often the case that a small slam is enough to win the board|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course - had the finesse worked, we all would have applauded their boldness and good fortune|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and 4s not a bad contract here frankly|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @S=hts and a minor |pg||
nt|bbramley: although with the Michaels bid they could be certain that one (or both) of their suits would split poorly|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes and got the michaels bid in the other room also |pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: note that (in a vacuum) 6@D is superior to 6@S because with 3-2 @Ds it's cold without needing a @H trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: notautomatic to bid it but east has a very powerful hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bbramley: declarer can ruff a club in the north hand, draw trumps and run spades for 12 tricks|pg||

nt|lestergold: 2c by south vulnerable ?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: i dont think so!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|debrose: This sort of double of an artificial two-suited bid normally just shows "values", typically without a fit for partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: not a bad spot, and N will be delighted to see ak of @C |pg||
nt|pef: yeah, pretty shocking the kit and fred stopped in 4s--they must consider that a sure loss|pg||
nt|pef: plus, it denied us a chance to declare a new leader|pg||
nt|pbundy: i sometimes wonder how different the game would be if the players always knew current scores|pg||
nt|pef: this board looks like a pretty dull 4h|pg||
nt|pbundy: i agree; kit and fred probably do think they suffered a loss on that one|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|raghavan: see the effect of X of S -|pg||
nt|pbundy: nice to come back and find out you've actually picked up 11|pg||
nt|pef: 3s a splinter raise in support of hearts|pg||
nt|pbundy: an agreement that is important to remember!|pg||
nt|pef: and that came right after they settled for 5dx on the previous board, so they'll be very surprised a net gain on the two|pg||
nt|migry: they have many ways to support spades after the opening - so there is no danger here|pg||
nt|pef: he's a passed hand and presumably would have used drury with a spade limit raise or the like|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|pef: hmm|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|pef: not quite so dull, but luckily for them 5h will succeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: some specs are thinking 4s was blackwood for hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well still off|pg||
nt|pef: and 5h was an erroneous response|pg||
nt|pef: welland may have thought 4s was a mistake and he was correcting|pg||
nt|pef: well at any rate, I fully take back my "dull 4 hearts" comment|pg||
nt|pbundy: and i reiterate; always good to be on very firm ground when you play exotic treatments|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cindy:  i dont see the need to bid at all with S hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh no!!!|pg||
nt|pef: willenken probably got it right and 4s was blackwood for hearts with welland showing 2 key cards|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes, that would be my guess, peter|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|cindy:  especially when pd is passed hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now finding DQ is important|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree with u Sindy its diabolical vulnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry  Cindy |pg||
nt|raghavan: They might not have gone to game|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|debrose: chambers was probably planning to support spades, but when partner bid NT that looked good to him|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pbundy: now it is critical for e/w to hunker down and not let emotion get the better of them|pg||
mc|11|nt|lestergold: the double will find the dim Q and im sure this will be another 10 imp to welland|pg||
nt|pbundy: very easy to do so with 2 boards like the grand and this one|pg||
nt|pef: yeah, roy welland needs to take a deep breath--that's two very costly misbids in a row|pg||
nt|migry: i'm sure they'll handle it well |pg||
nt|dcbutler: probably a good time for a time out|pg||
nt|pef: looks like they may be taking one|pg||
nt|migry: they should|pg||
nt|pbundy: chris had a fine hand; controls critical|pg||
nt|pbundy: i agree, migry|pg||
nt|pef: that's actually a good tip.  nothing prevents you from taking a short break (well except time pressure) when a couple bad things happen in a row|pg||
nt|pef: personally I think splintering on the west hand is an overbid with his side holding qj and qj--partner needs a huge hand--even more than he had--for slam to be good|pg||
nt|migry: not sure what the bids meant in the last one - but i don't think welland should have splintered anyway with the soft values in @c and @d|pg||
nt|pef: we seem to think simultanously alike, migry|pg||
nt|migry: :)|pg||
nt|migry: u type faster tho|pg||
nt|pbundy: migry; i agree.  |pg||
nt|pbundy: stuff on the outside very soft...|pg||
nt|pef: you mean that I type faster, peggy?|pg||
nt|pbundy: you may type faster than migry|pg||
nt|pbundy: but not faster than i do, i would guess|pg||
nt|migry: basically the hand is worth 3 points |pg||
nt|migry: i admit to using 2 fingers only :(|pg||
nt|pef: is even bidding 4h on that hand automatic--at mps you might bid only 3 with such soft values|pg||

mb|2S|nt|lestergold: 5h costing 3000 against the infrangible 5c|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: in fact, the robinson team has been playing nonstop since saturday--they came out of the round robin|pg||
nt|pbundy: and, needless to say, irrespective of which team fails in this match - still possible that the "loser" will be USA  2|pg||
nt|pef: as did the fleisher team in the other match|pg||
nt|pef: this may be unique that two of the semi-finalists (and the two in the lead) came from the rr|pg||
nt|dcbutler: i think the round robin actually started last Friday|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bbramley: and another swing coming - N/S have the first 8 tricks here for 200 and 7 more imps for meltzer|pg||
nt|debrose: We've seen a lot of the Schermer-Chambers NT defense system here.  It probably does not include a way to show clubs at the 2 level|pg||
nt|debrose: I think many would bid 3@C at favorable|pg||
nt|sybarra: we know his 2 @C shows majors |pg||
nt|raghavan: S will support clubs now - is it not cindy|pg||
nt|lestergold: gonna be hard for west to come in now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: but its favourable vulnerability abd he has nice 2 suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: pity one of them bid by south!|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead double but then theyll go to 5c|pg||
nt|pbundy: i think that 6@S is makeable here without a club lead........  am i correct?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bbramley: the modern style is to get in there, like pepsi did at the other table, but that jockeyed E/W into 3@D, which they made|pg||
nt|lestergold: not surely goona stand this|pg||
nt|pbundy: the hand that is short in spades is the hand that is shorter in diamonds|pg||
nt|pef: yes, you are right, started on friday, so seventh consecutive day of play|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|raghavan: Mike - are a prophecy teller|pg||
nt|lestergold: not difficult looking at north's hand|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|debrose: Perhaps he was hoping to defend NT successfully with the opponents vulnerable - something good to consider when overcalling over 1N in general|pg||
nt|migry: 6 can be made|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pbundy: and - a spec kindly informs me that zia made 6 on a heart lead - after bidding it|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|raghavan: I mean the X|pg||
nt|lestergold: weak pard with weak suit he believes west's double|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|bbramley: right|pg||
nt|sybarra: echo in @D coming for the lead most likely |pg||
nt|debrose: But with that hand I think most would act, thinking the opponents are likely to get to spades or diamonds anyway, or partner may bid|pg||
nt|bbramley: agree - that's one reason so many players strain to get in - it could easily be partscores making in both directions|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pef: what happens if he ducks the ace of diamonds|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|debrose: or you may not have any defense to even 3N, e.g., partner has a stiff club|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: in any case im due a right prediction just now after all the commentator curses striking!!|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|sybarra: high @h now?  |pg||

pc|d4|nt|debrose: This time the pass really paid off.  I know some players may wonder about opening 1N with such good majors and two suits unstopped|pg||

mb|p|nt|debrose: five-card majors, six-card minors, I've even seen some six-card majors:) |pg||

mb|p|nt|migry: which is the right @h to lead?|pg||
nt|pef: yeah, I guess you are right|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pbundy: on this auction, i might try the queen|pg||
nt|pef: none of them on this lie of the cards :)|pg||
nt|migry: :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: declarer more likely to have the king and hope partner can get in with another heart|pg||
nt|pbundy: 9 of clubs works super :)|pg||
nt|pef: yeah, and such an obvious lead on that auction :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bbramley: good guess on lead|pg||
nt|debrose: With a K-J guess and nothing else to go on it is often right to play the opening leader for the Ace|pg||
nt|bbramley: even with @S guess there's still a club problem|pg||
nt|debrose: Because he might have led the suit with the Queen, but would "never" from the Ace|pg||
nt|debrose: This is especially true when he is known to have an unattractive holding in the suit he actually did lead|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|debrose: I've been asked what happened to Zia, etc.|pg||
nt|pef: hard to see how this can make|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|debrose: I guess because those matches are two day matches, so they are playing the 4th of eight sets, the organizers decided it would be more excited to put the USA 2 bracket on tonight|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n on min values normal auction but one finesse the dim is working but another 4 finesses are all wrong|pg||
nt|migry: looks like declerer sd try his luck in the @c suit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cindy:  W has his doubling shoes on    good dbl|pg||
nt|lestergold: a tiger double! i lioke it as a money player i approve|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course lead directional|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes, it seems like the straightforward way|pg||
nt|pef: the only alternative would be to play for both spades onside and then some sort of endplay|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|lestergold: but he heard the limited auction so he knows there isno redouble on the way and he knows they are most unlikely to make|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: 6n by north same |pg||
mb|3D!|nt|sybarra: Willie?|pg||
nt|debrose: my general point was with nothing else to go on play opener leader for Ace - here he ended up with quite a bit else to go on|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I asked and Neil claimed for down 1.|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh,  tired puppies|pg||
nt|debrose: thx for clarifying that Willie.  I wonder what happened|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: In open bid 3NT only|pg||
nt|lestergold: or by south for that matter|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pef: although they may land in 3nt with about the same result as the prior board|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: so may be swing if they reach 6C|pg||
nt|lestergold: well as we have seen before 505 slam its red or black on the roulette table with no 0 or double zero|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now easy to reach 6C what do u Cindy & Mike say|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they have a massive combination of cards apart form the lonely heart K!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|debrose: If the play is as we saw this will get corrected eventually.  A misclaim can be costly, but can't force you to lose tricks you can't really lose|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu8: I believe he lost 1 spade, 1 heart, 2diamonds and 1 club.|pg||
nt|debrose: With some partners I use this 2N response to show a "semi-positive" in clubs.  Perhaps that's how they play it here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|debrose: But I wouldn't bid 3@C over that with the South hand, and it's a pretty obscure treatment, so I'm guessing they were showing controls?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I don't believe I am allowed to say anything about it to the players.|pg||
nt|debrose: I don't know the rule, but I think you shouldn't say anything Willie.  It will get sorted out|pg||
nt|debrose: Lots of guesses about the system from specs:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: thxs for the information.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 clubs for all we know was stayman|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|bbramley: my guess is 2NT=3 controls, 3@C=stayman|pg||
nt|raghavan: Adam pushing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s cant be support or spades here must be a cue cos clubs already agreeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: well theyv eha da fe poor results and know they cannot sit on thei laurels with the lead slippin away|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4n sign off/|pg||
nt|pef: sorry, I guess with hearts 33 and a non club lead 3nt fetches, doesn't it|pg||
nt|dcbutler: yes - doesn't someone have a theory that it's better to lead from your 4 card suit than your 5 carder?|pg||
nt|pef: although it is possible that after aj of hearts holding, he may use the two diamond entries to lead toward the kq of clubs, taking 2h, 2c, 4d, and 1 spade|pg||
nt|migry: no:) there is a theory that it's better to lead from a 3 card suit than from a 4 vard suit|pg||
nt|pef: he'll have to judge on the play of the hearts whether they are splitting|pg||
pc|dA|nt|debrose: I just noticed Chambers doesn't have a standard 2@C opening.  Sorry, if I'd realized that I wouldn't have even tried to guess. |pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|debrose: the responses|pg||
nt|debrose: Willie, just curious.  Are they writing explanations to things or doing the whisper thing?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: They are writing and I cannot see it.|pg||
nt|sybarra: they write in little light pencil scratchings |pg||
nt|Walddk6: They should provide operators with binoculars I think|pg||
nt|debrose: Thanks. |pg||
nt|sybarra: some players hand opertor the sheets of paper,  many do not |pg||
nt|sybarra: *operator|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Even if I receive the paper, i cannot read the writing in many cases.|pg||
nt|sybarra: been there done that |pg||
nt|debrose: So here we see yet another fourth best from longest and strongest opening lead.  And again it's the best lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: as I said,  little scratchings |pg||
nt|debrose: Got it willie, don't even bother trying with Michael's|pg||
nt|migry: they r in 2@h in the other room so if he makes it that will be a much needed pick up|pg||
nt|pef: just on the percentages the ace of clubs onside is more likely, but he may get some clues.  robinson/boyd will try to avoid giving them|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: no blackwood|pg||
nt|pef: so at this level, this is quite an interesting contract to play|pg||
nt|migry: 2@h went down |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: south has CJ pen card from last trick|pg||
nt|pef: ah, even more to think about|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: it was i think 4n to play still no harm done but no swing either|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 1 or 2 imps only rathe rthan a signioficant swing|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: 70 points less for playing in clubs so 2 imps|pg||
nt|migry: now he knows |pg||
nt|migry: he needs the hearts|pg||
nt|migry: so he'll make it|pg||
nt|pef: good play by roy welland.  much harder to duck the j of hearts, now he can try both if he wanted to|pg||
nt|pef: of course opps just tried the clubs for him so he needs hearts to split|pg||
nt|pef: and since they do, an 11 imp gain for welland and the match back to 24 imps|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
nt|pef: would you guys pass on the south hand in these conditions?|pg||
nt|migry: south did the right thing to pass - he is "expected" to hold 7-8 points and this is what he has including the useless K@d |pg||
nt|pef: yes the k of diamonds may be worthless, but |pg||
pc|h3|nt|raghavan: good|pg||
nt|cindy:  i would open the N hand|pg||

pc|hK|nt|sybarra: missing a pass ? |pg||
nt|lestergold: north hand has merits as an opener but not mandatory Cindy!|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|debrose: 2@S here should just mean nothing else to bid.  Either no spade stopper, or in this case not eager to play NT from your side|pg||
nt|bbramley: the @S lead will scare declarer, but he doesn't have much choice about how to play|pg||
nt|cindy:  no :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a few imps back |pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w 's spirited auction has kept them out of a no play game|pg||
nt|cindy:  thats what happened at other table...N opened|pg||
nt|dcbutler: i agree - move the king to another suit, and bidding game seems auto red at imps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|debrose: Although North seems to think South showed something in spades.  What would he do with xxx, T9x, Kx, AKQxx?|pg||
nt|debrose: Maybe he figures they have noplace better to play opposite a hand like that, though 4@H seems possible|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: well there is the reason why its not a mandatory opener|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|bbramley: i like to bid suits where i have something rather than suits where i don't - i might bid 3@C or 3@D|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|bbramley: anyway, north also has nothing better to bid|pg||
nt|debrose: North had no good bid, and I guess didn't want to distort his hand in some other way.  I don't think it's really playable to agree 2@S shows anything more than xxx in spades|pg||
nt|debrose: like Bart said:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bbramley: when you're already in a game force it's normal to assume that responder has some natural descriptive bid available|pg||
nt|raghavan: South with 14 could have said 2NT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|debrose: Maybe.  I specifically have the agreement with regular partners that 4th suit in 2/1 auctions is assumed not to be anything much in that suit |pg||
nt|debrose: Taking two finesses into the six-card spade suit is not a pleasant prospect for declarer, but as Bart said not much choice.|pg||
nt|debrose: There's a little something in the fact that Rosenberg didn't overcall - but could easily have one king|pg||
nt|debrose: I'm asked about the 2@H rebid, and it's noted that the rebid was 2@D in the other room.  There are lots of ways to treat opener's rebid in this auction - too complicated to get ...|pg||
nt|debrose: into now I think|pg||
nt|debrose: Though if Cohler, who certainly has no attractive discard, takes long enough perhaps we could write a book on the subject |pg||
nt|bbramley: more significant is that the tank strongly suggests that cohler has both red kings|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Cohler is thinking for a long time now. Schermer might draw some logical conclusions from this long wait.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: sometimes partner does not have a fit with one of ur black suits and he adds up his points and insists onm game|pg||

nt|xenya: actually the lead sets up a @H trick for declarer -- if he reads it correctly -- but it's not over yet|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|raghavan: You want declarer to play H10 pinning 9|pg||
nt|xenya: right|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2 more sessions to play here so there is plenty of time|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||

nt|sybarra: and this looks like a push |pg||
nt|lestergold: well no excitement likley here n/s will bid the infrangible 3N|pg||
nt|dcbutler: right. i like willenken's choice|pg||
nt|pef: assuming 1d isn't one of those any hand with zero or more diamond type bids, I think I might bid 1nt, but 1h is a very close second choice for me|pg||
nt|pef: migry?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|debrose: Good result coming for Meltzer from the other table on the last board.  I guess I've gotta get up and pace now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can they make 6 @S here|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|debrose: And I was just reminded, by my own brother of all people, that Cohler may actually be up only 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: getting lots of yeses and some with no's on a club lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: On board 55 it appeared to us that Chambers made 2@H when he claimed down 1.  That may get corrected|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: wow, that's a really aggressive 2nt call by welland|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|Vugraphu8: I hope so.|pg||
nt|pef: he may get rewarded for it, though|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|pef: this can be made, but he's going to have to do some good guessing|pg||

nt|migry: on a @h lead|pg||
nt|pef: he had to win the first club|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|debrose: Pacing no longer feels good enough after looking further at Board 60.  Meditation has been suggested, but that's never worked for me.  Hmm, what to do|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|debrose: I don't think scoring mistake, if there was one, on 55 was made by operator.  he told us he heard neil say down one.  but fact remains if he made the tricks, that will be changed.|pg||
