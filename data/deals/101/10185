mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: if so, that makes redouble more appealing with west's hand, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: playing 5-card majors, it would be preferable to show a good 3-card raise right away over the double|pg||
nt|athene: of course, if you don't have any gadget to do that, the normal thing is redouble then 2@S|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i wonder if XX was just 9-11 because west was a passed hand|pg||

nt|vugraphztf: this deal of course|pg||

nt|jbgood: enetering into the second half it is still 0-0 between Norway and Germany:)|pg||
nt|athene: so even on a heart lead, go down in 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: that's what happened in the other room basically|pg||
