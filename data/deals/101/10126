nt|ady: north likely to open with 6-5 distribution      whoever plays  should not go above 2 level    |pg||
nt|finch: The 'intermediate' two (often in combination with a multi) is very fashionable at the moment|pg||
nt|gosia: hello|pg||

nt|ady: yes   many would open 1 spade|pg||
nt|3for3: this is systemic for them|pg||
nt|finch: west has a tricky call, a choice between 4@D, 4@H and pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Margie|pg||

nt|hedyg: ty Tyler|pg||
nt|barnets: how many tricks were made on board 1 please/|pg||
nt|tylere: the 1@D bid promises 5+ @D in an unbalnced hand in 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|barnets: in 3N recorded as7|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Barnet!|pg||
nt|barnets: im next door just checking|pg||

nt|gosia: to dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: apparently they have not moved on yet|pg||
nt|gosia: lol- can picture this|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like an easy 4@s on EW. no sacrifie in vulnerable|pg||
mb|r!|an|4+ !h|nt|finch: 4@S is more obviously a void. 3@S sounds as if it's looking fr 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: one more    likely shows minors   |pg||
nt|3for3: good action hands to start|pg||
nt|finch: not exactly what south wanted to hear loooking at soft spade values|pg||
nt|3for3: but his minors look great|pg||
nt|finch: 4NT here might be natural. Or it might be saying I don't know what to bid. I bet they've never discused this acution!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and EW putting pressure on|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: that expression is new to me  i must remember it to impress my friends :)|pg||
nt|barnets: the last hand in 3n in open|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but with @cQJx in front 12 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: west bid 3n after 3@S|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cindy:  :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: needs a lot to be made in OR|pg||
mb|2D|nt|raghavan: 3 NT contract goes away|pg||
nt|barnets: here 61S makes on any lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@s= minimum?|pg||
nt|don paulus: hard to get into slam after ops open|pg||
nt|gosia: oops|pg||
nt|gosia: think Russ worth 4 @d ?|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S|pg||
nt|barnets: a lucky one|pg||
mb|p|nt|tylere: Not sure. The CC doesn't detail openers rebids|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: e is asking a question|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=390&pid=709|pg||

nt|vugraphu4: n is writing aa lengthly explanation|pg||
nt|andyv:  South bid 1N in OR and got rewarded|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may come back to life|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Geoffrey :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi giorgio|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: yes with @cQJx in front|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gosia: Melih a bit agressive :)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|roswolf: thinks better of it|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to say if worth a 4@d bid....maybe 3@h followed by 4@d if pd can't bid 3N...S hand already limited|pg||
nt|gosia: I think Russ worth a boost even though Peter showed 5 or less|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tylere: this is probably -1|pg||
nt|hedyg: @H lead?|pg||
nt|tylere: A@D maybe?|pg||
nt|tylere: @H would be my second choiuce|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: often trump is best when you and pd hold the majority of hcps|pg||
nt|hlortz: so this should be a couple of IMPs to EW|pg||
nt|tylere: I notice that 3N has been changed to = in both rooms now|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok, more like it|pg||
nt|barnets: just less than 25 percent slam|pg||
pc|cK|nt|barnets: as with a iamond lead declarer has to cash 3 hearts before the @S ace|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: best he can do now is take in hand and play @s hoping for split honours|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: that would be for -1|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tylere: somewhat surprised E moved over 3@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: had pd figured for short @ds|pg||
nt|barnets: now hes wishing they had bid slam|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yo_yo: well they are in slam next door    depends on the lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Ozdil needs to recoup some imps|pg||
nt|mcarroll: On 46 3NT made in Open so 8 imps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also to decide which @c distribution QJx Qxxx to J and vice versa|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c4|pg||

pc|s7|nt|raghavan: Did S open 1H there?|pg||

nt|raghavan: not known|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: my spies tell me Kamil saved in 7@d :)|pg||
nt|barnets: well in slam passing the !9 is clear gains against qjxx and QJx|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Looks like standard 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Oh |pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be a bit competitive|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tylere: 1@C = @C or balanced|pg||
nt|gosia: cover your eyes novices /newcomers :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h bid pretty aggressive with this vul|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think we both are happy not to be in slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|gosia: Peter must be steaming to make that call at these colors :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and Russ introducing a pressure cooker?|pg||
nt|gosia: will be rewarded no less :)|pg||
mb|2H|an|transfer|nt|tylere: if balanced, not in strong NT range|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|hedyg: so this is unbalanced for them|pg||
nt|finch: double will get South excited, but the heart lie means this is a dangerous spot|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   a good contract for n/s    but 5-0 split of trumps does not help|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  extra reward?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 1400   :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w went quietly|pg||
pc|hT|nt|finch: East trusting his partner to have some values for a vul against not overcall|pg||
nt|andyv:  cards all wrong for E/W|pg||
nt|mcarroll: an 18 HCP vul game|pg||
nt|gosia: Peter will take a long time to play this unless they lead trumps for him|pg||
nt|andyv:  a spec says trump lead holds it to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: with most right here its only a question of how many overtricks he will make|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: seems to be able to make quite a few @cs in NS|pg||
nt|tylere: yes..but if it's bid it probably has to be by south, and south is happy in 2@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: shot in the arm for Ozdil|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: and EW might find the better @d contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: unusual lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: if this goes down 1 another IMP to ew|pg||
nt|tylere: the top+bottom two suiter problem again...in a couple of partnerships I've played various ways of showing that combo, just to avoid this problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: N should be short in @s, thus unbalanced with @cs|pg||
nt|barnets: i predict 2|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|raghavan: Here Ozdil goes down |pg||
nt|barnets: or 1|pg||
nt|barnets: if he ducks a club|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|hedyg: so why not lead pd's suit?|pg||
nt|andyv:  with trump lead, declarer should be able to make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will he run for home or @H Blockage here?|pg||
nt|raghavan: No block|pg||
nt|cindy:  wonder if W considered 4@s   he has suit oriented cards (not notrump)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he can hope|pg||
nt|barnets: hi peter|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|don paulus: 1 or 2 ?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tylere: especially with the 1NT bid on the left|pg||
nt|tylere: E getting ready to get tapped|pg||
nt|tylere: maybe -2 now|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|finch: looks making to me if declarer picks it|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: and N might think S will ruff|pg||
nt|hlortz: yep tho n will think 2 @h will csh|pg||
nt|hlortz: cash|pg||
nt|ralfwil: On boards like this I often make an offer - here 10 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
nt|hlortz: after the oddj@H lead|pg||
nt|gosia: gotta play a heart to table Peter - |pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w will gain a few imps on this board|pg||
pc|h9|nt|finch: it only has 3 losers now (2 clubs and a heart) as long as it doesn't lose control - a club lead would have|pg||
nt|finch: ...forced the high trump hand and beaten it|pg||
nt|andyv:  duck?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no hope|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hlortz: still looks -2 though|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|finch: you can see two more tricks for declarer easily from here - just a matter of where the 10th comes from|pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|vbman: made?|pg||
nt|ady: yes   makes     well played|pg||
nt|don paulus: ruff - switch club = 1 down ?|pg||
nt|ady: why|pg||
pc|d4|nt|don paulus: S will have to come with trump at the end ?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: down many now|pg||
nt|tylere: only -1 on high diamonds|pg||

nt|andyv:  also A@c lead told declarer where all the missing cards were|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no fear from West|pg||
mb|3S|an|Weak Raise|nt|ady: n/s   have 11 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|gosia: he really didn't have much choice|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR in 3N on this hand, down 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: great looking hand at red but at the score you cant pass throughout|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here would work a 4@D used natural showing raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: only the club ruff stops 6@H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South is thinking bec 4@H could be dangerous, losing the possibility to search slam|pg||
mb|4S|an|Hearts + Clubs |nt|finch: another big hand - NS can make 11 tricks in hearts and EW 10 in diamonds|pg||
nt|vbman: now a michaels may lead to a right lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@H is unlucky to go down, if West leads the@CQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w   trying to barrage  opps out of contract|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   tht east had bid 4@D|pg||
nt|finch: North has a nice hand for the majors, but should probably stick to 4@H only as South may have stretched a little to get to the right spot|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1@S i mean|pg||
nt|ralfwil: on hands i like astro with a 5-card anchor major|pg||
mb|5N|nt|vbman: melih may pull some back|pg||
nt|ady: hope south wont overvalue the void diamond|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bid 2S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i prefer to bid that on the first round|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N and W will be glad to keep alow profile on this one|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s can make a couple of spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW can now retire from the bididng and let NS sort things out at the five-level|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but 6@H is down also with Qx in West - to make would guess to play K at first round|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6 level you mean|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and probably will go down anyway, come to that|pg||
mb|p|nt|tylere: I'm being told that X = single minor or majors|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to the world's youngest vugraph commentator: Adam Kaplan|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hi All :)|pg||
nt|tylere: Welcome Adam|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Adam :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult to go down if declarer attacked @hs|pg||
nt|cindy:  Weichsel overcalled with a 1@s opening with 2@h holding J10xxx so im amazed no 1@s bid here|pg||
nt|cindy:  last night|pg||
nt|barnets: so you would be right here|pg||
mb|6H|nt|hlortz: welcome|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe he bids differently with a good lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Hi Tyler, Hedy and Henry :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Meckwell here it looks like|pg||
nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
nt|hlortz: so ew are chipping away at the lead looks like 4 imps for making 2@D|pg||
nt|tylere: looks like they'll do rather better here than in the other room, where they ended up in 2@H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hi Danny :)|pg||
nt|3for3: looks like 4 or 5 for diamond for bidding the better part score|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Danny!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This was an interesting problem for Rogoff in the OR|pg||
nt|finch: now a matter of how much South think he's already shown - and clearly he thinks he's minimum|pg||
nt|ady: e/w save in 6@D   -500|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 4@H also possible|pg||
nt|cindy:  got them to 4@h and at the other table his side never got in the bidding|pg||
nt|cindy:  4@h making|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S was too much in the cold light of day|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Weichsel wrote down "Hearts + Clubs I think" will that disuade a club lead?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the bid for South is very difficult - need to guess - i would bid the same without see the cards|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: or the cold light of evening|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem is that is down the same - to play K in @C isn't easy, having J109|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: weichsel claimed after lead, saying he'll play for q of clubs in east :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if South gets the clubs right, he is a better man than I am, Gunga Din|pg||
mc|11|nt|3for3: DF makes 3@D, but I think that requires a spade to the ten when in with the only dummy entry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but K work with this figure and with Qx in all hands, or Axx Ax Axxx in East - so can be played|pg||
pg||
qx|c65|st||md|3ST962HKT9DJ2CT984,SK853HQ74DQT9CKQ3,SQHA3DK87654CAJ52,SAJ74HJ8652DA3C76|sv|o|nt|andyv:  certainly a lot of imps for first 4 boards|pg||
nt|andyv:  Peter might be settling down now:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes that @CQ was inspired|pg||
nt|andyv:  good action hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: he didnt|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: when dummy came down, ekeblad oppologized for not bidding 7 :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so his punishment is to pick up a flat 4-count next hand.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 imps to ozdil on 63|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|3for3: diamond picking up some loose change...which could change the match :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: looks like 4S EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|tylere: 1@C = balanced or clubs, not strong NT|pg||
nt|barnets: west will raise to 4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N(S play precision ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i think so|pg||
mb|1H|an|!|nt|gosia: depends on how you feel at theses colors|pg||
nt|barnets: and north 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|tylere: 1@D = @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N maybe 4NT - |pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: NS play a canope system with a strong 1@c opener, |pg||
mb|2C|nt|pelu: 4@S look good - if u only see NS-card - but @S 4-1 will make great probelms on a @H-lead from East|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@H = spades !?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 1@h shows 2 or 3@H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2 places toplay?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  little slower auction here than OR|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H 1@S or pass - 1@H giving the K for the lead may be the best :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H for @S better|pg||
nt|roswolf: well yang should call- double looks best|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: system summary for NS http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=585&pid=131|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: North somewhat disappointed that South didn't reopen|pg||
nt|bridge_one: kibitzs told me that N/S play strong club and canapé|pg||
pc|c7|nt|finch: After that lead, South knows that partner has a spade void|pg||
nt|raghavan: Kath - do EW play forcing NT|pg||
nt|barnets: well 5@D is down 1 but 4@S maybe more|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think west's pass was wet|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H = @S Matt ?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mtvesuvius: This is a pretty easy 3N or 4@H|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: 2@d is more @hs?|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: a lot of wxplaining going on|pg||
nt|3for3: this kind of bidding, even though it is not complicated, will forever keep bridge from becoming a spectator sport (bbo afficionados notwithstanding)|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: on both sides of table|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont know their system but it looks like it |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: also slows the play down a lot with the questions and answers|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: ty Al|pg||
nt|gosia: I like Lairs (north) Take out dbl - get in and out fast|pg||
pc|d3|nt|3for3: south has bid his 3 card suit and twice bid his xx|pg||
nt|ady: may not be easy to beat 2@H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh yes alerted now|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes now alerted|pg||
nt|raghavan: as forcing|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mtvesuvius: This is rightsided in this case\|pg||
nt|hedyg: so all that is known of the S hand is that he has no 3+ @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: more explanations before opening lead|pg||
nt|cindy:  rare 4th best lead|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|3for3: west needs to shift to a diamond to hold the extra overtrick|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@s or 10|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  6 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|yo_yo: why rare Cindy?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hlortz: ew are having a great board-a-match game but few imps being won|pg||
nt|3for3: the black suits look fairly hopeless|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Close match here, every IMP counts|pg||
nt|hedyg: now N has the 9@s for finessing @s and is not blocked|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Correct, everything works nicely for Declarer here|pg||
nt|hedyg: @c lead by W in OR|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Greco may find a @d switch here|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: n is further explaining|pg||
nt|hedyg: he knows his pd has 4@hs|pg||
nt|andyv:  need club switch|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: not sure, can't read his writting :( will check|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: there goes the @D trick|pg||
nt|yo_yo: usually 3/5 in USA?|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2/3 leads popular in UK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2/4|pg||
nt|cindy:  i like 2/4 but cant find a partner that does :)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|mtvesuvius: and so a push|pg||
nt|gosia: specs ask if would overcall 1nt - absolutely not !|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the system played by North South was created by Ekeblad and played by many strong pairs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: no, it doesnt seem to meet with approval playing online |pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: why play @c when you see KJx?|pg||
nt|gosia: double much better|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: best play probably a small @d to table|pg||
nt|pelu: small @D now|pg||
nt|barnets: the only chance to make is the @D ace hoping East has singleton king|pg||
nt|barnets: unlikely though|pg||
nt|barnets: if east had the sing king dec could revert to spades|pg||
nt|pelu: to keep control Ekeblad sh start @Ss with @SQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Ekeblad in the tank, asking about the weak 2 bid |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t think thats enough with @dK singleton, but for -1|pg||
nt|pelu: @SQ in trick 3 - and small @D i trick 4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Peter. That´s better|pg||
nt|barnets: if west has single King he cant make the hand now|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|barnets: so hes wondering if he should still try and make it|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bridge_one: this information also from kibitz :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  lone honors usually make NT difficult to play|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: ask if E has K@s and claim|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|raghavan: He has setup D for 2 H discard |pg||
nt|barnets: no luck|pg||
mc|9|nt|finch: playing 3rd & 5th leads the king would have looked silly if declarer had AQxx|pg||
pg||
qx|c66|st||md|4SK862HA83DQ742C73,SAQT3HKT6DKJ85CAT,S754HQ54D96CJ9852,SJ9HJ972DAT3CKQ64|sv|n|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|finch: still, only an undoubled overtrick - they'll have worse things to worry about I am sure|pg||
nt|don paulus: first score for EW|pg||
nt|vbman: slam bidding|pg||
nt|cindy:  4@h made in the open room on 34|pg||
nt|raghavan: First 4 Bds - score almost = 12 and 13|pg||
nt|barnets: if east had ducked the diamond till the third round and played a club it would have been much better for the def|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Ekeblad talking to himself trying to think of a better line, eventually remarks "no double no trouble :)"|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: another balanced 1@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ady: 14  opposite 7   produces a slam for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: personally I do not like the Double when my only 4 card suit is that bid by opener - 1NT is preferable|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no weak NT - many pair use 10/12 bal 1Nt not vuln|pg||
nt|roswolf: a straightforward 3nt|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@D=@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am learning :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or better still Pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  aces and spaces made the hand almost unbiddable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h is makeable|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tylere: ;)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@s is the limit here I think|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D   flannery?|pg||
nt|pelu: that max for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@H= no 4 cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry 1@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h?|pg||
nt|gosia: typo Matt ? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: negatory, weichsel did indeed bid 2@h|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: It only takes 51 boards to learn a system, Hedy :)|pg||
nt|3for3: might make 3 on some variations|pg||
nt|hedyg: faster if they repeat the bids on each bd :)|pg||
nt|3for3: i bet DF will|pg||
nt|andyv:  game try?|pg||
nt|cindy:  @cA lead i guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: ekeblad explained 3spd as "if rememberd, 4-4-4-1 max"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no - wwhen I look at the @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: well this should be safe|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: or they might stop in 1. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: a lot of explaining going on|pg||
nt|hlortz: 1@S must be limited....|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Although I think Hampson will want to reopen|pg||
nt|hedyg: S is a passed hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He may try 1NT now|pg||
nt|hlortz: oh hes passed duh|pg||
nt|3for3: dangerous spot for hampson here|pg||
nt|3for3: doesnt want to lose a double part score swing|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: more questions|pg||
nt|hlortz: he wansts to bid but is vulnerable|pg||
nt|3for3: but the opps are in his longest suit|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, 1NT is tempting|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: pass is more tempting|pg||
nt|gosia: got lucky double let Russ pass|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: Russ took out a pass card but put it back, now thinking|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphu4: there seems to be different explanations from each player|pg||
nt|hedyg: uhoh!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the slam lost 11 - NS had a free run to 4@H|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cindy:  oops|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: -1 sh be easy|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Ekeblad asked Weichsel if he's going to be a while, Peter confirmed so eke is on his smoke break|pg||
nt|pelu: if decl duck - then -2 on a @C-ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: as he looks at dummy he thinks 4@S is reasonable|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: asking about the q@h lead, and 7@h now, |pg||
nt|pelu: in board 49 NS found the way to 2@S - but Gu didn't find the winning line - so only +1 imp|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|andyv:  should have put the pass card out|pg||
nt|gosia: whoa |pg||
nt|bridge_one: push board|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: well 1@D can promise 4441|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  this will be expensive|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mtvesuvius: Well, they landed in a good spot |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: about the 1@s bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to tell who expected what from this auction|pg||
nt|gosia: maybe 2 @h mechanical error - once on the tray can't take it back|pg||
nt|andyv:  and only thing i was wondering was whether to bid 2@S or 2@D over 1N with the S hand|pg||
nt|gosia: for those who watched Women's trials I learned the hard way|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: i don't believe so, he deliberately bid 2@h from my perspective, but is possible :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: i am told the 1@h response shows 3+ Nat and Non Forcing|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: on the previous board|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 64 ozdil/lair stayed in 4@H and made +2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so the pass by East is justified|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: North south arguing about the pace of play. Ekeblad : "I am going to go to the restroom" Weichsel "Can I go with u?"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hmm|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: their system card is :  http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=418&pid=131|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i never thought to use 1@H with 3 cards over 1@D playing strog club and 5 majors - could be interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: weichsel previously asked to use the washroom, ekeblad told him no|pg||
nt|roswolf: the chinese will certainly take their time|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cindy:  half right   4-1|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yo_yo: true :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|gosia: did not see pard opened 1 @d so passed lefty had not bid yet and could not take my pass back|pg||
nt|andyv:  with taps in @h suit, I probably would have bid 2@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Ekeblad "can open 2@s 5+s and 4@d" or if too strong, open 1@c, players discussing at present*|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|andyv:  except with certain partners who never have more than one trump for me|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: They may treat it as a 1RF potentially, although change that by a Passed hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he can ruff 1@c and disc 1 and endplay E in @s|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|gosia: we played 1 @d making 3 when 4 @s goes down on a club ruff|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: super-safe line|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|barnets: defence have 2 more for down 1|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gosia: was called Rueful Rabbit by Commentators when we gained 4 IMP's|pg||
nt|andyv:  lots of tricks... too bad there's a spade suit to contend with|pg||
nt|gosia: lho was same side of screen as me - once bid in try - is over |pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|gosia: once bid in tray|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|pelu: in 50: West open 1@S (canape) - and 'stole' the @s-fit from NS|pg||

mc|9|nt|bridge_one: yes, super safe :)|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: It may be, but he probably just played on spades|pg||
nt|3for3: lose 2 spades, plus AKA|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok..|pg||
nt|finch: I doubt many people would bid that one - some hands are just too tough|pg||
nt|gosia: Specs sad for me - maybe got bad ruling :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder how he got rid of his @d loser...if E returned @D|pg||
nt|pelu: and EW didnt find the 8 card @H-fit - the batle stopped in 3@C :)|pg||
mb|1S!|an|4+, Could be canope|nt|ady: exact cards   with 10 card fit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H could be too much|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is difficult to predict|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: Df made 3 though, so the computer won an imp :)|pg||
nt|vbman: fine only double dummy|pg||
nt|ady: need to play 5 of a minor  here|pg||
nt|andyv:  just cashed @cs I guess|pg||
nt|cindy:  so what is the verdict on his correct bid ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably 1@S 4 cards|pg||
mb|1N!|an|Forcing except if opnr  5332|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Milgrim is going to be tortured here|pg||
nt|3for3: yummy hand for milgrim here|pg||
nt|3for3: his @H's are better|pg||
nt|finch: another bidding challenge, this time for NS - to get to exactly 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|barnets: 43 imps with 38 boards to go just 1 per board|pg||
nt|bridge_one: canapè style|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S rather shuts out the 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 3@D both majors FG an exceptionally useful piece of system when you have this hand.|pg||
nt|ady: south will avoid no-trumps one partner has shown both minors|pg||
nt|gosia: must play Aces Scientific 3@c forcing raise|pg||
nt|gosia: I like it as it frees up a natural forcing 2NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 2 way jacoby|pg||
nt|gosia: that's seems silly - never heard of it ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  5! exclusion?|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: Shi in the tank :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2n=4 trump and 16+hcp|pg||
nt|gosia: 2nt natural and forcing over 1 of a suit is so comfortable :)|pg||
mb|2D!|an|5!d|nt|mtvesuvius: I bet he will be forced to make at least 2 bids, if not more|pg||
nt|finch: South could have temporised with 3@S which would also get the job done, but this is probably simpler|pg||
nt|ady: east is going to be on lead   so 5 will bed the limit    there will not be a wrong lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@C=4 trumps and 12-15 hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: but he surely doesn't want to be raised|pg||
nt|cindy:  W has a difficult hand to bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: I believe they agreed that 2@s should be opened systematically for them.|pg||
nt|cindy:  ok|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: IN 4th chair specifically***|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hlortz: 2@c to not encourage pard|pg||
nt|hedyg: should have bid his major|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: now he has to pass and accept whatever happens|pg||
nt|andyv:  some flip it around|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@s is clever - afraid of 2@h protection if he passes |pg||
mb|p|nt|tylere: looks to be -2, no?|pg||
nt|3for3: nothing too terrible|pg||
nt|hedyg: wishing he had bid @hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: or that E had bid!!|pg||
nt|3for3: not clear, 2@H made have raised all the way to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: this has the merit of being undoubled|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2 down it looks like, so 3 IMPs to Diamond|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however 2@S will be no picnic|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: tortured pass by weichsel : "I hope this isn't something..."|pg||
nt|bridge_one: very competitive system - the use to open with 4 cards in Major give good advantage about the regular distribution|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes at these colours he doesnt mind playing in a moysian fit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  seems like E/W are making this more complicated than it needs to be|pg||
nt|gosia: lack of @d q will encourage East|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ralfwil: a @d shift and chances to defeat|pg||
pc|c8|nt|tylere: somewhat surprised east didn't X, actually. 2NT with the points split 20-0 rarely plays well|pg||
nt|3for3: they need a win 5 for the wheel|pg||
nt|gosia: kickback with a void ?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|cindy:  dont think they can make this|pg||
nt|roswolf: again i feel e/w have been a bit damp with a 10 card there should be some way into the auction|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|hlortz: no big swings but all to ew|pg||
nt|bridge_one: remember that they play canapé, so to bid 2@H take the risk to find 5@H in South ...|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: he must have been happy with the contract|pg||
nt|ady: this hand should not take long|pg||
nt|gosia: right W denied @d control|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H over 1NT is possible, but one advanyage of canape is that such an overcall can walk into your main suit  |pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but some risks have to be taken|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|barnets: declarer will start spades with low towards the J in case north has 4 to the Q|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cindy:  probably will play S for the long clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4!@C, 1@D, 3@H  and 1@S|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|raghavan: W can get 3H, 1D, 1S and 3Club |pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  interesting auction to get to right spot and maybe our first push board of the set|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: but again, with 2/2 in the minors, perhaps it is more likely that South has a long minor rather than hearts |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: luckily @D break|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: having QJ83 in @S East tought to can bid at seccond round his @h :) but north choise to bid 2@S ....|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: should be able to hold this to -2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, just cashing out will be right, in this case|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|3for3: aker will need to cash out|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|s3|nt|3for3: he will get squeezed if he plys for more|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|raghavan: must get his S sooner |pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: he must have been worried south had the long diamonds|pg||
pc|s2|nt|barnets: then he could lose an uppercut|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mtvesuvius: Declarer squeezes are always painful|pg||
nt|cindy:  parting with a spade is painful but no other choice|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|mc|7|nt|bridge_one: 3@h could be beated, so 50 for E/W against 110 could be max 2 IMP|pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont think the open room is connected to us on 66 3nt made 11 tricks so 2 imps to fleischer|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: there is a disconnect, open room operator decoupled the rooms, will work on it to fix|pg||

mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: They missed their game here, let's see if Greco-Hampson can find it|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS vulnerable..|pg||
nt|hlortz: chance for another pickup if they bid 4@s|pg||
nt|tylere: 2NT by W?|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is what Parker bid|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Even a pass by Greco would be a pickup|pg||
nt|hedyg: i want to double for penalties!!|pg||
nt|tylere: Greco wishiing he played Fishbein right about now |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: lol, Fishbein :)|pg||
nt|3for3: not clear how many tricks they would gather on defense though|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Fishbein against any pre-empt from a Junior can be a very valuable agreement|pg||
nt|tylere: (Playing Fishbein, X would be penatly, and 2@S takeout, for those unfamiliar)|pg||
nt|3for3: I'd bet North would emerge with 6|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: west is thinking hard|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 65 in the other room 4@S went -1 for another 2 imps|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: i bet he is!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Well, this will be interesting|pg||
nt|andyv:  N/S seem to want to flirt with trouble in this set.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Down 3 probably|pg||
nt|raghavan: They made 3NT in OR|pg||
nt|raghavan: HK was the lead|pg||
mb|3D|nt|finch: South close betwen 1@S and 2@S, but with both opponents bidding he knows he'll get another go if necessary|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4@S now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or 4@C?|pg||
nt|pelu: interestig - if S open 1@C - would u overcall 1@S?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: too good for a direct 4@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H   makes e/w     but should not be bid   needs good trump position plus diamond finesse|pg||
nt|finch: East may well drive game... he's got a pretty tempting hand opposite a 1@D opening|pg||
nt|gosia: I play that's a fit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: believe south play a strong 1@c as part of their canope type system|pg||
nt|pelu: I would not - never Jxxxx - but..|pg||
nt|roswolf: unofficial score 161-121|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: he will play his tops|pg||
nt|andyv:  still down 2... good thing no one could dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: but East not at all interested|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mtvesuvius: Cash 2@d and underlead the @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably. I like an early action before balancing|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu4: Weichsel lets out a deep sigh, almost as if to announce another tank|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is right also bec take the chance to play @S from North, proteging from lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he won't go on - he's gone off in one slam already|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  friendly hand though|pg||
nt|raghavan: thinkg of slam Kath?|pg||
nt|barnets: i dont think a singleton spade lead is likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: as West?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not after I bid like that|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Ekeblad : "you're giving me a heart attack with that" Weichsel "what/??? you mean you don't have extras???"|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|finch: It looks as if double followed by 2@H was either intended as forcing, and/or West thinks East has a 1534 type hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: up to partner now|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure not - but then 4@S can make|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tylere: A@C out a @C works too, at this point|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: n says they play sound 2s|pg||
nt|hedyg: he sure has a sound 2!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: argument has just breaken out about the system|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: broken out*|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: disagreements about 3@d etc. before the lead|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|finch: for the double.  This is all very murky, I'm not embarrassed to say I've never discussed exactly this auction|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: 3@D was an interesting call|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Imagine if he has a "Weak" 2 :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3 down for 4 more imps|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is what Greco was hoping for|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This is going to be an exciting finish|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW fighting hard for every imp|pg||
nt|3for3: normally these would be 'dull' hands, but when you know every imp counts...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, this is not a matter of claim = :)|pg||
nt|ady: landed in a decent spot     though a heart contract will score better|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|hedyg: not this time|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|mtvesuvius: Greco will get his 9@h also, and -3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: less than 50% because @D have to behave|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|andyv:  lucky to lose only 2 imps|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
pc|s7|nt|finch: 4@H is better than it might otherwise be as the diamond finesse is likely to be right|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3 IMP difference now|pg||
nt|hedyg: scraping, scraping..|pg||

mb|5H|nt|ralfwil: Encouraging for opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|tylere: not one I'd really want to be in|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@c is artificial GF I think|pg||
nt|finch: NS may well get to 4@S which is a rather delicate spot, although only has 3 obvious losers|pg||
nt|vbman: ozdil must be predicting the state of the match not so bright fr |pg||
nt|ady: n/s   have a tight 4@S   in view of trumps 4-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: when your behind in a match sometimes good to let the opponents know they could have done better|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@SX MAY BE THE FINAL CONTRACT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i presume 5@S by E/W - no way to risk 6@H by South with only one Ace|pg||
mb|5S|nt|Walddk4: It is|pg||
nt|hedyg: Gettysburg?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I am told Natural GF or Balanced|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: always a dilemma now whether to show the 5 card major |pg||
nt|yo_yo: you were right Rag |pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx rare |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: THIS IS WHERE JUDGMENT COMES TO THE FORE|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 2NT often played as a relay, particularly if you like raising with 3-card support frequently|pg||
nt|finch: 4@S likely to show a maximum weak NT with 4 trumps|pg||
nt|andyv:  wrong sided the contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: shh, Geoffrey - the children are asleep|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: will east play the king?|pg||
nt|finch: that's a storming lead.  I was expecting a diamond which makes life fairly easy for declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: keyboarditis|pg||
nt|roswolf: this can now make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: my, that @D8 is useful |pg||
nt|mdgraham: or is it....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't think East can quite do it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk4: You need a few things to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c=?|pg||
nt|cindy:  dont see 8 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so 1@S is 5 or 4 with another 5 card suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Shi pulled out the 4@h put it back and elected for the diamond, good choice :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe -1 in any event|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mtvesuvius: best to ruff 2@c in dummy, but will still only come to 12|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: having 2 losers in @H i think impossible to make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if North duck A in @S |pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||

pc|c5|nt|gosia: E should lead a trump anyway if the other way|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: Ekeblad has left the table for a smoke break, dummy is vacant|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: Why the alert then?|pg||
nt|3for3: because it might have been a control bid|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: s says balk|pg||

nt|barnets: yes had south not led a diamond dec would have had a chance to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: pitching the D on the club and guessing spades|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 20-20 in points.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not the best thing to say when you have just gone three down|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: the unbalanced type of 1@c now|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Although when Milgrim opens 1@c it gives them a chance to find the right spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam is solid so a bidding test for e/w|pg||
nt|mdgraham: opportunity here though |pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  2@d again|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: the semiforcing was alerted as can only pas 5332 min, for their style|pg||
nt|roswolf: north will join in|pg||

nt|andyv:  not this time|pg||
nt|roswolf: over 5@C  what does west do - punt 6@H?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mtvesuvius: This will probably be -1 also... which means that Rogoff gets 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|finch: 4@H asking South to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: n/s     3@S   |pg||
nt|mcarroll: @Ss a bit anaemic to balance?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and price was steep|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i guess Shi is showing 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: what a Spade suit |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: THE BARRAGE DOES ITS JOB|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7@C is quite a good save|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  + value of K@h dropped considerably|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but this is even better|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|finch: fairly normal to bid game opposite a strong NT and find out if it makes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H lead now|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Best to keep on playing trumps here|pg||

nt|cindy:  good dbl|pg||
nt|cindy:  they are doomed now|pg||

mc|12|nt|cindy:  hmm|pg||
nt|raghavan: what happened no H lead|pg||
nt|cindy:  i would be afraid my partner would kill me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: me too|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: ekeblad asked about 4 questions about the bidding, then plopped out the 2 of @c|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did he not see partner's double?|pg||
nt|cindy:  can he see his partner's face ?  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: 99% sure he saw the double, no, screens prevent that :)|pg||
nt|barnets: east will have to make 2 discards on the hearts|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Apparently if we are lucky enough to see a tie here, there is a 6 board playoff... The boards are ready to go! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: n-s discussing their defense|pg||
nt|mdgraham: One thing about bididng 6@H there is that at the vulnerability, NS will be reluctant to let you play it |pg||
nt|roswolf: good point mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as nobody is really sure who has what in those kangaroo auctions|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably just a simple raise to game or perhaps blackwood|pg||

mb|d|mb|4S!|an|1 Keycard with Queen|nt|andyv:  and gained 2 imps to boot|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has max. for 1@d response|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphu4: on last board|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: part  score hand   likely 1NT   n/s      or maybe 2@C   |pg||
nt|finch: Ozdil might have made a (light) take-out double over 1@C, which would have got the heart fit into the game|pg||
nt|finch: Now Lair is confused by having a singleton diamond and long clubs|pg||
nt|vbman: now must be praying for protection|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: could be dangerous  to bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however they seem to have a Gadget |pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: lucky drop of J10@c|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and that will give declarer 7 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N shows @ss?|pg||
nt|barnets: best leat and a trump back|pg||
nt|barnets: declarer booked to down 2 or 3 again|pg||
pc|d5|nt|3for3: surround play of the 9@D there|pg||
nt|hlortz: but will declarer go for @D without unblocking @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: that will work now|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah def has attacked those|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: he may, and the T@D gives him that option|pg||
nt|hlortz: rite|pg||
nt|finch: with a short club on his left and opponents clearly light on high cards, he deduces that partner must have club length|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vbman: a partnertship need study a lot for this|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|mtvesuvius: Now he can unblock the clubs and play a @d to dummy for =|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s can get close to 3N here |pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: trying for a @s as 7th trick|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, and Hampson can no longer knock out his @d entry, since then he will establish declarer's @d suit|pg||
nt|don paulus: saved by the bell|pg||
nt|finch: either that or he meant 2@C as the majors|pg||
nt|ady: south might have made a discretionary pass of 2@C    |pg||
nt|finch: South now entering the confusion zone|pg||
nt|andyv:  overtrick time|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 1N did show spades... ty Matt|pg||

nt|ady: turned a good plus into a minus|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|finch: 2@C might also have been intended as clubs and another|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: lair asked if any agreement on 2@c, said they don't have a specific agreement|pg||
nt|barnets: The 1SJ would have been bettter|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|s6|nt|finch: nothing like the quarterfinals of the trials for inventing new system (!)|pg||

nt|yo_yo: a nice comfortable contract|pg||

nt|andyv:  peter looking for 9th trick in case E has @cK|pg||
nt|gosia: why wd he duck ?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: agree with this line|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|finch: Depends a bit on the NS methods, if North could be e.g. 3442 then EW have nowhere to go|pg||

nt|barnets: he could get a xx|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: ekeblad asked a question about 3@h verbally, asked if 3@h was shortness|pg||
nt|pelu: but from Ss hand I would play @H - only nead the J as help - a @D lead need better cards by partner|pg||
nt|mdgraham: tsk tsk - 2@H, with four-card support for (what I presume is) a five-card suit?|pg||
mb|d|nt|cindy:  dont think it mattered much what he led here|pg||

pc|d6|nt|barnets: 2@S was asking|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|cindy:  did the J deny higher ?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|ralfwil: A natural lead|pg||
nt|barnets: had west a very strong balanced hand he would have bid 2N after the 2@S call|pg||
nt|barnets: a system devised by eric  Kokish|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: weichsel has gone to the restroom|pg||
nt|barnets: interesting heart suit|pg||
nt|barnets: the way to guarantee 1 loser would be to pass the @H8 or H 10 |pg||
nt|ralfwil: no slam yet, but another 2 boards to go|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: k, he's back here we go|pg||
nt|barnets: but it will cost an imp far more often than it will gain a game |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: declarer must pick the hearts which seems standard|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @CJ dropping saves the day|pg||
pc|s6|nt|3for3: The match may well hinge on 59, a potential slam for EW|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Vugraphu4: J@h lead announced as natural should have none higher|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bergan - has variations - usual 3c = 7-10 with 4cd support - 3D is 11-12 with 4cd - so they might have modified|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gosia: Welland finished anyone know the score ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: needs to get @H9 out of the way |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: could do if a big heart  honor was transfered to north and a@C to south|pg||
nt|3for3: cash it or lose it|pg||
nt|barnets: a spec has told me normal play goes down 2 percnet of the time|pg||
pc|c2|nt|passell: take the ace|pg||
nt|3for3: i think he has a fair idea too|pg||
nt|barnets: so passing the @H 10 would gain 20 imps and lose 50 in a hundred hands|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|3for3: well done|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|gosia: 66-30 to Welland|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: so should lead @H9 to the ace after drawing trumps |pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: had to play @c, not @H|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: there is a major suit squeeze as well|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gosia: we've had lots of excitement here - but leveled out |pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 1 imp to Ozdil|pg||
nt|gosia: he's down 1 at least |pg||
nt|andyv:  agree...@h spots even worse the 2nd time I looked at them:)|pg||
nt|gosia: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 5-0 in N = 2%?|pg||

pc|s9|pc|c6|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||

pc|h2|nt|raghavan: Yes Kath usual type only no modification|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bridge_one: taking all chance|pg||
mc|11|nt|bridge_one: win also with J10 in @H in North this line|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a somewhat fortunate contract. 4@H mucho btter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is true|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: director discussing protocol with players|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny - four of the last five boards have been played at the five-level |pg||
nt|bridge_one: but it is difficult to take all agreements for each pair - i would choise 4!@D bec i know my p can have only 2Majors, witout @C|pg||

nt|hedyg: last 2 boards|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and now the potential slam hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: another fun hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Weichsel now saying there is still a problem, director is going to continue the issue|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bridge_one: 2@H is 9/11 ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: can they find 6@D?|pg||
nt|3for3: 1 nebulous @D|pg||
nt|3for3: the age old question, should west choose 4@H or 3nt here....when partner gives choice of games|pg||
nt|gosia: I hate to say 2 routine boards coming up ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: I am a NT guy|pg||
mb|d|nt|bridge_one: using 2@D multi weaker|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: no alert on 2@h, believe is weak 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm. I thought screens were supposed to alleviate problems of this nature. |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  as a spec points out, E/W may well be getting desperate.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|3for3: if he shows his shortness...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: surprice for West :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: yes, you are correct, weichsel is not supposed to bring attention to a hesitation on his side that the other players did not see|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: i am told last bd will be flat|pg||
nt|3for3: then they will be off to the races|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@h is 11-13 Bal|pg||
nt|roswolf: no i think totally random seeing the strength of west's weak 2's in tis set|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: right, and he is max and prime|pg||
mb|p|nt|gosia: After Board 30 play will resume tomorrow at 10 Am EST|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we like 1NT with a 6 card minor?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: 2@S some sort of relay...|pg||
nt|finch: if partner offers me a choice of games, I usually pick 4@H with support|pg||
nt|roswolf: someone's blood is going to flow|pg||
nt|bridge_one: very unlucky find this distribution !|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I predict the score will end "00"|pg||
nt|roswolf: so would i|pg||
nt|roswolf: spade king looks normal|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: weichsel has now left for a bathroom break|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think K@S obliged - other are all a risk|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cindy:  i like it ok here|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Q@c Rusinow|pg||
nt|cindy:  not good enough to jump in @ds|pg||
pc|s2|nt|raghavan: good tempo for declarer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nice lead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|3for3: this could be it|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@s is probably shortness|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes skipped the relay|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fleisher defeated Cohler and Ozdil won against Jacobs. The losers into the repechage for the USA2 berth|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Same happens to the loser in this match|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No info regarding the other matches, sorry|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c surely would be cuebid now|pg||
nt|3for3: meltzer had a big lead|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: w is back in his chair pondering|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=27&Itemid=224  for the tournament website and the complicated format|pg||
nt|finch: even looking at both hands it's not totally obvious which is the better game|pg||
nt|3for3: I prefer for partners to bid out there patterns with other than 5332...which may influence that choice too|pg||
nt|passell: I usually do also  but not this one|pg||
nt|finch: although looking at all 4 hands both contracts will make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and still no slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @HQ would be a good discard|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It takes about 15 lawyers to interpret just half of it|pg||
nt|3for3: going into 4th quarter|pg||
nt|ady: west with 4-3-3-3   and high cards in all suits has opted for 3NT rather than 4@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so that West knows he should not lead @HA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mtvesuvius: Results after 3 Quarters: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2009/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
nt|hedyg: does this deny a @c cue?|pg||
nt|tylere: well, we're not stopping in 3N...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@d is probably RKC, but I'm not sure|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: or show 1|pg||
nt|finch: South has a nasty single dummy problem.  Playing the 9 is right on this layout|pg||
nt|passell: The 3 jacks look like nt cards|pg||
pc|d4|nt|finch: but less successful if partner has AK752|pg||
nt|raghavan: N has no entry |pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: spd lead sets it? :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If South ducks this, West may well sacrifice a trump trick and lead another spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as he knows South has @HK|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: my spies tell me the other table is in 2@s as well, except being declared by west, after 2@d multi p 2@s ppp|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S this side of the pond is usually played as pass/correct|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can return @D - know 3@D in North|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: my spies are somewhat mistaken, the 2@d opening was 5+@h 4+@d, my appologies|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and if p have Q np, if have A he know K in @H will be a good card to discard the @D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|3for3: wow...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Wow|pg||
nt|truffle: thats the match|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: That will do it|pg||
nt|kareno: So Rogoff survives a hurdle.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: well, we have not seen 60 yet|pg||
nt|tylere: I'm not certain the last board will be flat|pg||
nt|hedyg: obviously for E it denied a @c cue|pg||
nt|3for3: 2 more to rogoff....|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe one should not take the excitement away from specs by revealing anything|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: e is explaining that 4c would have been a q by w|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: he would have happily cuebid @H otherwise|pg||
nt|yo_yo: my partners forbid me to bid 1NT with a 6 card suit|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: never a good idea for the same team to declare 2@s at both tables |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but it's worked here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry, know 3@D in South|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that switch wasnt worth the wait|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funnily enough, last weekend in a match our opposition played a board in 3NTx at both tables |pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: ty Al|pg||
pc|d7|nt|passell: change them to a random king and 4 heaRTS WOULD LOOK LIKE A BETTER BID|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mtvesuvius: There is a few IMPs possible on  60, however it probably wouldn't be enough|pg||
