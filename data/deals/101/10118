nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: players discussing various defenses to certain bids|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: will resume shortly|pg||
nt|ady: looks like a part score hand up first|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi and welcome all|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: hello everyone, players discussing systems|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: will begin momentarily|pg||
nt|andyv:  that could prove to be helpful:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Matt|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: NS play alot of unusual systems, strong club, with canope bids, alot of relays|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: as well as unique 2 level openers etc.|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: EW play transfer responses to a short 1@c opener, |pg||
nt|andyv:  and a change of players too|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: system summaries can be found by clicking on players names http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&task=list&event=14|pg||
nt|andyv:  N/S will be playing a strong club system and E/W 2/1|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: last 15 boards of the round of 16|pg||
mb|1S!|an|4+ could be canope|nt|Walddk7: Hello everyone and welcome back to White Plains, New York, for the 2009 United States Bridge Championship. Quarter-finals, four segments of 15 boards; this is the first|pg||
nt|ady: north likely to open with 6-5 distribution      whoever plays  should not go above 2 level    |pg||
nt|finch: The 'intermediate' two (often in combination with a multi) is very fashionable at the moment|pg||
nt|gosia: hello|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Your commentators are Frances Hinden, David Edwin, Paul Van de Maele and Danny Sprung|pg||
nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
nt|ady: good even all|pg||
nt|3for3: That 2@S is a 'good' weak 2|pg||
nt|ady: yes   many would open 1 spade|pg||
nt|3for3: this is systemic for them|pg||
nt|finch: west has a tricky call, a choice between 4@D, 4@H and pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Margie|pg||
nt|mcarroll: evening all|pg||
nt|gosia: Ozdil a bit outclassed here - but could surprise , as they have all week|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Martin|pg||
nt|gosia: hi Andy|pg||
nt|gosia: Martin|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|hedyg: ok so they have started play already|pg||

nt|hedyg: 1NT-2@c-2@H-3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: +4?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i really dont see how|pg||
nt|hedyg: did NS manage to disc all their black cards?|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Tyler Eaves :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Tyler|pg||
nt|tylere: appears to be a trick one claim, I don't see any play on the hand|pg||
nt|hlortz: making 6 on a @H lead is believable|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is a typo in South's name operator|pg||
nt|Walddk4: r missing in Milgrim|pg||
nt|hedyg: no the operator seems to have a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: what does dbl show     a good wseak 2?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Margie, Andy|pg||
nt|gosia: :)|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|finch: North's double often described as "action" saying I want to act but I'm doubling in case you want to defend|pg||
nt|ady: this could be expensive|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|andyv:  2@d minimum... and 2@h relay (with help from specs)|pg||
nt|gosia: I comm - Robinson/Rogoff - wonder if they had late penalties ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|andyv:  don't have it at fingertips... will get it in one minute but it's under USBF|pg||
nt|gosia: lots of bidding here - better come to a screeching halt soon :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: Weichsel head in hands, in the tank, he is well known for being a "deliberate" player|pg||
nt|andyv:  unchartered waters here.  Maybe 4@D is cue with @h support?|pg||
nt|gosia: I first fell asleep kibbitzing Peter in 1970 :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|finch: about 500 I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: ...until it was pulled to 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: that's not something you want to do very often.  You know that converting 4@Hx to 5@Hx never looks very good|pg||
nt|ady: think 5@D  likely down 4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A benefit of being at the slow table is that we get to see the Open results|pg||
nt|mcarroll: oops|pg||
nt|gosia: wheels came off here a bit|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: ekeblad says he shows a 5-3-3-2 that didn't want to play nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  like in races, when the baton gets dropped, usually bad things happen.|pg||
nt|gosia: Peter new to this - comes from Precision|pg||
nt|andyv:  system notes on line not much help here...3@d may have been the culprit.|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: weichsel : "we had a mixup p, sorry" |pg||

pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|finch: three rounds of spades would also have promoted the @H8.  The diamond lead was a pretty good shot however|pg||

nt|vugraphu4: apparently they have not moved on yet|pg||
nt|gosia: lol- can picture this|pg||
mb|d|nt|finch: 4@S is more obviously a void. 3@S sounds as if it's looking fr 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: one more    likely shows minors   |pg||
nt|3for3: good action hands to start|pg||
nt|finch: not exactly what south wanted to hear loooking at soft spade values|pg||
nt|3for3: but his minors look great|pg||
nt|finch: 4NT here might be natural. Or it might be saying I don't know what to bid. I bet they've never discused this acution!|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|andyv:  hard to say if worth a 4@d bid....maybe 3@h followed by 4@d if pd can't bid 3N...S hand already limited|pg||
nt|gosia: I think Russ worth a boost even though Peter showed 5 or less|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tylere: this is probably -1|pg||
nt|hedyg: @H lead?|pg||
nt|tylere: A@D maybe?|pg||
nt|tylere: @H would be my second choiuce|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|hedyg: often trump is best when you and pd hold the majority of hcps|pg||
nt|hlortz: so this should be a couple of IMPs to EW|pg||
nt|tylere: I notice that 3N has been changed to = in both rooms now|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok, more like it|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: best he can do now is take in hand and play @s hoping for split honours|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|tylere: 1@C = @C or balanced|pg||
nt|gosia: cover your eyes novices /newcomers :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h bid pretty aggressive with this vul|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gosia: Peter must be steaming to make that call at these colors :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and Russ introducing a pressure cooker?|pg||
nt|gosia: will be rewarded no less :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tylere: if balanced, not in strong NT range|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|hedyg: so this is unbalanced for them|pg||
nt|finch: double will get South excited, but the heart lie means this is a dangerous spot|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   a good contract for n/s    but 5-0 split of trumps does not help|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  extra reward?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|finch: East trusting his partner to have some values for a vul against not overcall|pg||
nt|andyv:  cards all wrong for E/W|pg||
nt|mcarroll: an 18 HCP vul game|pg||
nt|gosia: Peter will take a long time to play this unless they lead trumps for him|pg||
nt|andyv:  a spec says trump lead holds it to 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: seems to be able to make quite a few @cs in NS|pg||
nt|tylere: yes..but if it's bid it probably has to be by south, and south is happy in 2@S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: and EW might find the better @d contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: unusual lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: if this goes down 1 another IMP to ew|pg||
nt|tylere: the top+bottom two suiter problem again...in a couple of partnerships I've played various ways of showing that combo, just to avoid this problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: N should be short in @s, thus unbalanced with @cs|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|hedyg: so why not lead pd's suit?|pg||
nt|andyv:  with trump lead, declarer should be able to make|pg||

nt|hlortz: so ew are chipping away at the lead looks like 4 imps for making 2@D|pg||
nt|tylere: looks like they'll do rather better here than in the other room, where they ended up in 2@H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hi Danny :)|pg||
nt|3for3: looks like 4 or 5 for diamond for bidding the better part score|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Danny!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This was an interesting problem for Rogoff in the OR|pg||
nt|finch: now a matter of how much South think he's already shown - and clearly he thinks he's minimum|pg||
nt|ady: e/w save in 6@D   -500|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mcarroll: 4@H also possible|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|3for3: DF makes 3@D, but I think that requires a spade to the ten when in with the only dummy entry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: or later :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He had to decide whether to pass 2@d which was 1M or to bid 2@h allowing for if his partner had @s|pg||
nt|hlortz: make 2 make 3 same 4 imps...|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like 4@h, 2@c and 3@d are there for the taking|pg||

nt|finch: Declarer will probably play two trumps before spades, in case West is 1174|pg||
nt|finch: (although many 1174s would have opened 4@D)|pg||

mb|p|nt|tylere: 1@C = balanced or clubs, not strong NT|pg||

mb|2D|nt|andyv:  little slower auction here than OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: North somewhat disappointed that South didn't reopen|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: After that lead, South knows that partner has a spade void|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: This is a pretty easy 3N or 4@H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: 2@d is more @hs?|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: a lot of wxplaining going on|pg||
nt|3for3: this kind of bidding, even though it is not complicated, will forever keep bridge from becoming a spectator sport (bbo afficionados notwithstanding)|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: pass is more tempting|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: about the 1@s bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to tell who expected what from this auction|pg||
nt|gosia: maybe 2 @h mechanical error - once on the tray can't take it back|pg||
nt|andyv:  and only thing i was wondering was whether to bid 2@S or 2@D over 1N with the S hand|pg||
nt|gosia: for those who watched Women's trials I learned the hard way|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: i don't believe so, he deliberately bid 2@h from my perspective, but is possible :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gosia: did not see pard opened 1 @d so passed lefty had not bid yet and could not take my pass back|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|andyv:  except with certain partners who never have more than one trump for me|pg||

nt|ady: south will avoid no-trumps one partner has shown both minors|pg||
nt|gosia: must play Aces Scientific 3@c forcing raise|pg||
nt|gosia: I like it as it frees up a natural forcing 2NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 2 way jacoby|pg||
nt|gosia: that's seems silly - never heard of it ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  5! exclusion?|pg||

mb|3D|an|Art. Asking|nt|mtvesuvius: I bet he will be forced to make at least 2 bids, if not more|pg||
nt|finch: South could have temporised with 3@S which would also get the job done, but this is probably simpler|pg||
nt|ady: east is going to be on lead   so 5 will bed the limit    there will not be a wrong lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@C=4 trumps and 12-15 hcp|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: I am told Natural GF or Balanced|pg||

nt|andyv:  weak makes more sense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|finch: 2NT often played as a relay, particularly if you like raising with 3-card support frequently|pg||
nt|finch: 4@S likely to show a maximum weak NT with 4 trumps|pg||
nt|andyv:  wrong sided the contract|pg||

nt|hlortz: ah def has attacked those|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: he may, and the T@D gives him that option|pg||
nt|hlortz: rite|pg||

pc|c6|nt|hedyg: trying for a @s as 7th trick|pg||

nt|don paulus: saved by the bell|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||

nt|andyv:  2@h and/or 3@c will have some followers|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: those heart pips come in very useful for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 5 IMPs difference that is|pg||
pc|cT|nt|don paulus: makes even with H lead ?|pg||
nt|ady: this presents no problems|pg||
nt|vbman: y|pg||
nt|andyv:  E @h spots are so poor, should have treated it as a 4 card suit.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|3for3: The match may well hinge on 59, a potential slam for EW|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|gosia: Welland finished anyone know the score ?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: could do if a big heart  honor was transfered to north and a@C to south|pg||
nt|3for3: cash it or lose it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|passell: take the ace|pg||
nt|3for3: i think he has a fair idea too|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|3for3: well done|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gosia: 66-30 to Welland|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|hedyg: had to play @c, not @H|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|gosia: we've had lots of excitement here - but leveled out |pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 1 imp to Ozdil|pg||
nt|gosia: he's down 1 at least |pg||
nt|andyv:  agree...@h spots even worse the 2nd time I looked at them:)|pg||

nt|hedyg: last 2 boards|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and now the potential slam hand|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: can they find 6@D?|pg||
nt|3for3: 1 nebulous @D|pg||
nt|3for3: the age old question, should west choose 4@H or 3nt here....when partner gives choice of games|pg||
nt|gosia: I hate to say 2 routine boards coming up ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: I am a NT guy|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  as a spec points out, E/W may well be getting desperate.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|3for3: if he shows his shortness...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: i am told last bd will be flat|pg||
nt|3for3: then they will be off to the races|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@h is 11-13 Bal|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|3for3: right, and he is max and prime|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gosia: After Board 30 play will resume tomorrow at 10 Am EST|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hlortz: 2@S some sort of relay...|pg||
nt|finch: if partner offers me a choice of games, I usually pick 4@H with support|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|3for3: this could be it|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@s is probably shortness|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes skipped the relay|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fleisher defeated Cohler and Ozdil won against Jacobs. The losers into the repechage for the USA2 berth|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Same happens to the loser in this match|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No info regarding the other matches, sorry|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c surely would be cuebid now|pg||
nt|3for3: meltzer had a big lead|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: w is back in his chair pondering|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=27&Itemid=224  for the tournament website and the complicated format|pg||
nt|finch: even looking at both hands it's not totally obvious which is the better game|pg||
nt|3for3: I prefer for partners to bid out there patterns with other than 5332...which may influence that choice too|pg||
nt|passell: I usually do also  but not this one|pg||
nt|finch: although looking at all 4 hands both contracts will make|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: It takes about 15 lawyers to interpret just half of it|pg||
nt|3for3: going into 4th quarter|pg||
nt|ady: west with 4-3-3-3   and high cards in all suits has opted for 3NT rather than 4@H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mtvesuvius: Results after 3 Quarters: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2009/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
nt|hedyg: does this deny a @c cue?|pg||
nt|tylere: well, we're not stopping in 3N...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@d is probably RKC, but I'm not sure|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: or show 1|pg||
nt|finch: South has a nasty single dummy problem.  Playing the 9 is right on this layout|pg||
nt|passell: The 3 jacks look like nt cards|pg||
pc|c6|nt|finch: but less successful if partner has AK752|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|3for3: wow...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Wow|pg||
nt|truffle: thats the match|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: That will do it|pg||
nt|kareno: So Rogoff survives a hurdle.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: well, we have not seen 60 yet|pg||
nt|tylere: I'm not certain the last board will be flat|pg||
nt|hedyg: obviously for E it denied a @c cue|pg||
nt|3for3: 2 more to rogoff....|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe one should not take the excitement away from specs by revealing anything|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: e is explaining that 4c would have been a q by w|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|hedyg: he would have happily cuebid @H otherwise|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|hedyg: ty Al|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|passell: change them to a random king and 4 heaRTS WOULD LOOK LIKE A BETTER BID|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mtvesuvius: There is a few IMPs possible on  60, however it probably wouldn't be enough|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d2|pc|c4|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty Matt for a great job|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: with 60 boards left, plenty of time for another ozdil comeback|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|3for3: which explains the odd 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  they will have their work cut out for them.|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|ady: the 4-4 fit in hearts fails if defence can find a spade ruff    might make 4@S   |pg||
mb|p|nt|gosia: these guys don't bid their suits ever :)|pg||
mb|2S|an|relay|mb|p|nt|passell: 4 spades is tougher to beat than 4 hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|3for3: 2@S is even tougher|pg||
nt|3for3: 12 facing 10 and only 8 card fit...so no surprise game not bid|pg||
