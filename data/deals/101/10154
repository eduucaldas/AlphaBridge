mb|d|nt|mariner1: 7@H 7@S or 7@D all can make (all on Q@D hunt)|pg||
mb|3H|an|alert|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: real key from Sasha's point of view is the @D suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: Key Card now|pg||
nt|daman: Moss team in 6@S on Board 81 in CR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C from Pollack as Exclusion would be great treatment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sasha can't ask -- needs to know way too much that KC won't tell her|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: we have Closed Room up now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|daman: redouble or 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: superfluous dbl -- gives NS more room to sort things out|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moss in Closed Room bid the 6@S on board 81|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5@C already said -- no @C loser -- Pollack worried about a) trump  b) missing grand|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: I would have bid 5@D    S must have first round @C control|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|mariner1: now S has to sort of guess about N's @S quality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like 5@D too george -- but more because Pollack KNOWS Cohen can't cue in red suit|pg||
nt|daman: missed a big chance to put the opps away|pg||
nt|daman: if they bid the grand in the CR     watch out|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: 13 tricks not certain -- need good things to happen in a red suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and decent trump split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and guess which good thing happened :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: so for the puritans, just a question of whether 6@S arrived at convincingly or not -- which gets an extra 5 points :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al no style points?|pg||
nt|daman: my guess is if you were in 7 and had to play it wide open?  you would end up making on a high crossruff after pitching @Ds on the @Hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a sure line for 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well most lines work|pg||
nt|daman: and ruffing @Cs along the way    East cannot get out of her own way on the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure george -- that seems to rely upon @H 33  surely better to try @D first|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|daman: they are in 7 in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and maybe right to play 2nd @D here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: send out a call for Michael Rosenberg and Bart Bramley -- what is BEST line for 12???|pg||

nt|gosia: with both majors locked up - tough decision- turns out George had @d's locked up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C is quite brave with that suit|pg||
nt|gosia: 10 minor suit cards - I'd do it to up the ante |pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, in today's modern world.... |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but you do want to make it difficult for the opposition to bid the majors |pg||
nt|irwinbo: in today's world you open one club or three clubs  few pass|pg||

nt|mdgraham: North won't dare pass at this vulnerability |pg||
nt|gosia: see 10 minor suit caeds ? :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: he can't take the risk of 3@C getting passed out|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|gosia: now what ? no fit - 21 HCP thoes pesky preempts |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|irwinbo: george will push to 6 hearts or 6 nt probably 6nt|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mdgraham: this is interesting - if North pictures West as holding @CKQ, South must have most of the red honours - but he doesn't know of the 6/5 shape yet|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|7D|nt|gosia: wow |pg||
nt|mdgraham: South must have taken 4@C as agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|gosia: well that Grand makes also|pg||
nt|irwinbo: ralph thinks 4 clubs was a cue bid in support of diamonds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if North puts his partner with one club (no ERKCB) he may well correct to 7NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just in case West has seven, which would leave East with a void|pg||
nt|gosia: George is in shock I guess - will possibly remove to 7NT ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny - even when you have 7NT on, the oppo are in the bidding|pg||
nt|irwinbo: george is almost certain that ralph has 6-5-1-1 but could he have 5 hearts and 6 dimonds?|pg||
mb|p|mb|7N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gosia: 3 imps is 3 imps :)|pg||

nt|daman: down in 7@S in the CR    fell back on the @D finesse|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: that doesn't seem like best combination of chances    for 13 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: never even tried the @Hs|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: top @D try for Q doubleton or @H 33 must be better than 50%|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: in encyclopedia this is also called Rule of 15  [which has 2nd definition that covers a lead convention]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rob -- we've found an 11 that I would NOT open :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: try Cansino Count Al,,,,,, easier to say :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i mean East -- not North|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: I knew Cansino as convention over opp 1N -- didn't know there was another meaning|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL = 3@H [support DBL]|pg||
nt|mariner1: same, add points and spades to get to 15 to open|pg||
nt|mariner1: so  a support REDBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Rob phrase better -- note to make, since Support DBL/RDBL originally invented for use in context of Strong Club system - some 2/1 players play support DBL but NOT support ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 83 Moss gained 10 back as the @S game was not found|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|mariner1: I was thinking they might find the A@C lead to beat 4....... no chance though on 83|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: the idea is that in context of big club - opener never holds strong hand, but in 2/1 maybe big hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: S in a fix here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cohen not opening has really made things difficult for Pollack|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: players closing eyes resting, while she thinks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: is DBL takeout??|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: is 2N nat or scramble?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: what is 2@H??  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: oy - who knows      open 1@D with north and none of these problems arise|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Stasha's eyes opened wide with the 4 spades call|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that said -- Sasha has been very consistent in NOT opening 11 count hands|pg||
