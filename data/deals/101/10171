nt|sybarra: 29 is "doable"  |pg||
nt|gambit: Hi Shirley, Roland|pg||
nt|gambit: 29 is tough, against anyone, and at this level, all players are great, gl to all, specs, enjoy |pg||
nt|sybarra: true is tough, but we have seen great come backs before even in this tourney |pg||
nt|sybarra: we certain have 2 great pairs to watch |pg||
nt|gambit: Levin (if I recall correctly) was "King of bridge" at a horrible young age (like 16) and wow...carried it forward, Weinstein is famous too, great players will make for a great ...|pg||
nt|gambit: match and when behind, mmaybe a little shooting will come into play |pg||
nt|sybarra: operator,  are the pairs seated correctly here? or correctly in the other room? |pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, for the quarterfinals of the USA2 series, this is certainly a marquee matchup.  Welcome to all.|pg||

nt|jcwla: USA2 semifinal.  The winner of that match will play the loser of Fleisher-Robinson in a 90-board USA2 final.|pg||
nt|avivs: I assume the auction was different but presented as such due to disconnects|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Hi Jordan|pg||
nt|raghavan: a part score contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: how did he make - @S9 (or J) from West sh defeat 4@H|pg||
mb|1C|nt|tsadek: 1NT could be anything in this postion|pg||
mb|d|nt|gambit: 4c?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some have asked whether there is an advantage to being USA1 instead of USA2 at Sao Paulo.  It's purely bragging rights, no advantage in the competition itself.|pg||
nt|avivs: I wouldn't be surprised if Meckwell will get to one of their signature 3NT here|pg||
nt|pelu: u are ALL correct - after the @S from West he could fall back on the @D-drop :(:(:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: Pepsi is starting off aggresively |pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: bd 47 is thrown out|pg||
nt|tylere: Hi folks|pg||
nt|sybarra: they soon wont have any bds to play |pg||
nt|tsadek: that what Zia-Hamman play |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|tsadek: N has to DBL with good hand|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Gerben Dirksen|pg||
nt|raghavan: may be a push|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Hamman/Zia's system summary says "Suspect 1NT openers in 3rd seat when NV."|pg||
nt|Gerben42: good afternoon|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Gerben.|pg||
nt|avivs: If Meckstroth tried 3H they would have been in 3NT|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|tsadek: hii Gerben|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c7|pc|sK|nt|Gerben42: okay - you cannot just always pass vs NT with a good hand, but here you just get caught...|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|Gerben42: although it doesnt feel good to start a match with -800, I guess the other room might overcall 2@S for @S+m with a similar result|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|raghavan: Play D?|pg||
mc|11|nt|jcwla: Jacobs' intervention seems totally normal.  It's taken the parlay of Hamman holding a real NT, a bad catch, and Zia's having the hand to double to put him in this position.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i hear the other room is playing 2NT from W|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yes, North stayed out there.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Nickell took 9 tricks in 2@H to win 1 IMP on Board 1, this will cost Jacobs more than that.|pg||
nt|tsadek: we can not blame Jacobs for DBL , when opp Suspect 1NT openers in 3rd seat when NV.|pg||

nt|tsadek: Jacobs will bid 5@C |pg||
nt|tsadek: normal bidding in this VUL|pg||
nt|tsadek: DBL  will be Penalty|pg||
nt|avivs: this hand produced action in the CR where N/S ended in 5@cX|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pelu: Nickell won the last 30 boards (90 to 120) with 86-16 - but they needed still 7 IMP|pg||

mb|3H|mb|d|nt|gambit: This much is clear, you do not recoup 29 imps by playing normally, Pepsi and Lev will be aggresive and sometimes take anti-percentage plays, trying to rectify the score|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: Zia anticipating a possible 1435 distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: They will play two substitute boards in this match, but we won't be able to show them. Perhaps our operator will tell us about them, a radio broadcast so to speak|pg||
nt|sybarra: making +1 maybe |pg||
nt|irwinbo: south showed hearts but it might have been better to bounce in diamonds|pg||

nt|avivs: this and the other R8 match of welland vs Strul have desplayed very high level of Bridge which is evident by the low scores|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|tsadek: not clear for Levin|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: director is being called, Weinstein not happy with explanation he was given on 2H call|pg||
nt|irwinbo: neither meck nor rod could really hi it but it goes down few|pg||
nt|avivs: a much calmer auction in the CR again ending in 3@h|pg||
nt|irwinbo: a few|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Gerben42: only with @C help|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: meckstroth told weinstein it showed both minors and he bid 3 clubs as cue bid|pg||
nt|pelu: when they see dummy - they know that they sh have X|pg||
nt|avivs: the score will surely be changed if the facts are correct about different explenations at both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: meckstroth insists that their agreement was minors|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|Gerben42: could be big swing to Jacobs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tsadek: big chance for Katz on leading @H or @D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: or some exciting play in @S, which have 0% chance of being 3-3|pg||
nt|tsadek: can zia play 10@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42: must guess Jx or 9x in N|pg||
nt|tsadek: that will be a great  and reasonable play|pg||
nt|tsadek: problem is that if he play 10@S to finess J@S , and covered he can again finess 9@S for 1 down|pg||
pc|s3|pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|raghavan: Peter > North is a passed hand - How could S go to game inspite of 2 suit fit?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|avivs: but in that case than Levin got a miss explenation at his side - either way the directors will adjust|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tsadek: dont think if he play 10@S katz will cover|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even on @CA lead, careful play is needed|pg||
nt|Gerben42: after @D 3-0, you must assume that N does not have 4@S and play on @S first|pg||
nt|tsadek: very difuclt to cover 10@S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: 3rd seat popular 1@s opening|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: but it will be just as friendly at the other table |pg||

nt|tsadek: if Jacobs bid 4@C , that will be bad for Katz , 4@D great|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|Gerben42: partnership question: what would 5@H from Katz have been|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gambit: when behind, a little shooting is in order|pg||
nt|tylere: a reasonable shot....probably not going to like the result though|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: 2s and rdbl both show support-redbl better|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tylere: unfortunatly the transfer wrongsided the contract!|pg||
nt|gosia: has no play from any direction ?|pg||
nt|gambit: does the double dissuade pard from the normal club lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think it says dont lead @H's |pg||
nt|jcwla: Meltzer made a similar 3@S bid (actually hers was 4@S) earlier in the tournament that found a very profitable 6@S sacrifice.  But she was white on red, I don't think a save is ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: likely here if they get to slam.|pg||
nt|tsadek: nice bid Jacobs|pg||
nt|jcwla: wd|pg||
nt|tsadek: Levin-Weinstein concentrate on who better to play |pg||
nt|avivs: if you want to watch multiple tables simmultaneously open as many tabs as you wish and go to: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tarek's reason looks more plausible|pg||
nt|tsadek: they have many convention to trf Declarer |pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: verbal explanation given at table was that redbl showed more interest in game|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: or lightener like |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|tylere: I think it's down either way...but played in the N there is more hope for a misdefense|pg||
nt|gambit: good news and bad for the def|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Vugraphu2: but Levin was vague and weinstein handed a written explanation on his thoughts of the redbl to rodwell|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: lull in play, rodwell thinking|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pelu: the 4@C bid in OR from Nickell made it easy for his partner|pg||

nt|gosia: lose a diamond|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 53 expensive as both sides went down |pg||
nt|tylere: yes, rather expensive...well, the X of 1@C was a bit, ahem, non-traditional|pg||
nt|gosia: that's polite :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: might have been a strong club auction with the dbl having a specific meaning  |pg||
nt|tylere: yes, that's what I'm being told|pg||
nt|sybarra: like CRASH? |pg||
nt|tylere: assuming X shows both majors...still not a call I'm straining to make. An X there actually has negative preemption|pg||
