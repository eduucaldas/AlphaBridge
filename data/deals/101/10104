mb|1N|nt|daman: Hi Jordan|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi George.  I'm guessing this is just the operator putting in the final contract.|pg||
nt|daman: surely that wasn't the real auction|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hi All :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: both pairs at this table play precision|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Hello George and Jordan|pg||
nt|daman: Hey R|pg||
nt|mariner1: well so much for defending 3@C|pg||
nt|kareno: I see Doug Simson and Walter Johnson practicing bidding all the time on BBO|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Simson thinking and asking questions, don't know why|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, Bigtrain and DougS|pg||
nt|kareno: They play their version of Meckwell Precision.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu2: 3nt = minors|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: in Open Room NS are in 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Minors or two places to play?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: EW also play a meckwell type precision with a (13+)14-16 1NT opening|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|Vugraphu2: explained as 5+ DIAMONDS and 3 clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: That is a pretty aggressive double of 4@c by Johnson.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|mtvesuvius: Today is Diamond and Platnick's first session here, they had a bye until this Round|pg||
nt|kareno: Did I hear this auction correctly??  Who bid notrump?  |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3NT is being played by west in the Open Room undoubled|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: sorry, auction wrong platnick bid 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|kareno: Now it makes sense.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: ok, now it's starting to make sense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: This could be a big swing hand.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, for sure... 4@c looks to be making|pg||
nt|kareno: And north doubled 4@c?|pg||
pc|d4|mc|9|nt|kareno: With careful play I think this makes 4@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: yes, simson doubled|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, ruffing @s finesse now|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: The 2009 USBC will determine which two teams will be representing USA in the Bermuda Bowl to be held in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, in late August and early September |pg||
nt|kareno: Pitch on a diamond and loses a club and a spade.  West must not use the club jack too soon.|pg||
nt|kareno: And a heart I meant.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I have seen that phrase before, Adam :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Copy and paste are great|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=27&Itemid=224 is the tournament website, the format of the event is basically a double elimination, with the losers ...|pg||

nt|mariner1: many open S or N these days|pg||
nt|chick: I would open S|pg||
nt|mariner1: E might Open as well|pg||
nt|chick: not N|pg||
nt|chick: and yes on E|pg||
nt|kareno: Now declarer can force a heart entry for the spade pitch on the diamond.  Making 4 and a nice swing to Diamond.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Hi All :)|pg||
nt|kareno: It's not clear if it would have beaten the contract but this defense did not help them for sure.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: NS can make 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: they need a @H for 9th, or 2@S|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: so a @H lead would give it|pg||
nt|kareno: Would you overcall with south's hand?  I would - need to get that lead-director in.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I would also|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Some more fitted hands here also|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East is Wolkowitz, and South is Pepsi|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hey Roland.|pg||
nt|mariner1: hard to bid it 11 opposite 11|pg||
nt|mariner1: and 3@C making 4 in Open Room as expected here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mtvesuvius: Wolkowitz also played in the trials for Turkey a few weeks back... He's a junior :)|pg||
nt|daman: 3@D must be a form of lebensohl|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: E competed in Open Room though|pg||
nt|chick: S may accept because of the Vul|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 6@c is being played here in the OR|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Chris Larsen|pg||
nt|kareno: You are offering big odds when you double a part score.  My late friend Paul Heitner said you should be able to misdefend and still get 500 if you do it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|clarsen: thank you rioland|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@c is pretty optimistic.  |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I don't double partscores for 50s or 100s at IMPs, but above that it's reasonable|pg||
nt|kareno: That's Benito Garozzo's passion again ... do not bid slam on a finesse, he says.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 6@c is reasonable, but unfortunately the Pointed suit guards are split, and the @s are 4-2 and the @d is off|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 6@C is a pretty good slam actually|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, you are right, it is definitely better than a finesse.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|clarsen: roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Hi Chris :)|pg||
nt|clarsen: hi|pg||
nt|daman: can't be a transfer|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mtvesuvius: wow, this has to be doubled|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think this is a forcing pass by East|pg||
nt|clarsen: i suspect somebody thought this was a forcing auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: S worried about those 2 doubletons|pg||
nt|kareno: Interesting not supporting clubs at once.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is a grey area of the bidding, when a pass is forcing or not|pg||
nt|mariner1: making 4 seems straight forward|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Mike Moss with his usual banter|pg||
mb|4N|an|!h cue bid|nt|jcwla: Not the top spot here.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: First play spades here I think, and there is a possiblity of a squeeze still in 6@c, sadly nothing will work for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|clarsen: it is indeed|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: platnick has show 4 card club raise with short hearts|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: The other option is to cash 2@d and try for the squeeze in either hand... Although I think playing for 3-3@s or @d finesse is better|pg||
mb|5S|nt|Walddk2: You need very specific agreements|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Debbie Rosenberg|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: wb Debbie :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: hi all|pg||
nt|clarsen: looks like e/w did well to reach 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: not the defense that hurts|pg||

nt|debrose: All partnerships get many high level bidding decisions - whether to bid, pass, or double - wrong.   |pg||

nt|kareno: He just told me the same :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mariner1: 4@S seems easy enough here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: So it's a lot closer than I thought, interesting choices though :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
mb|2N|nt|clarsen: 3 di is an interesting choice not sure what it means|pg||
nt|clarsen: maybe some modification of bergen raises|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: South asking west about the bid. West wrote something. Unclear|pg||
nt|chick: the trick will be staying out of 6|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: might go slamming|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room N bid 2@H and E used 4@C ,,,,, W 4@S and out|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|an|Transfer to diamonds|nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, this is a bit lighter than usual, and they have the agreement to include 5@c w/4cMs in 2@c when in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|kareno: Obviosly this is a bit of an action by Simson.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Diamond was kind of stuck here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Can you get player names up for East and South, Mila please?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East is Wolkowitz    South is Pepsi|pg||

nt|mariner1: nice 3N here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I've found that Jxxx Txxx and 9xxx are the holdings that most often set up for tricks late in the defense, and they should be held onto if possible|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|brgpro: can someone pronounce S's name? i still can't ...although he will be my teammate for the coming year|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Pepsi is the easiest :)|pg||
nt|clarsen: nobody can why he is called pepsi|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: So many overtricks are giving by pitching what may look like a harmless card like from 9xxx, but often costs at least 1 trick|pg||
mb|2N|nt|daman: hrrrmmm|pg||
nt|kareno: 14-16 nt.|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: type hand where you make slam by not bidding one|pg||
mb|3C|nt|brgpro: polish 1@c|pg||
nt|daman: is that result correct Steve?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 14-16 NT for NS I think, 15-17 in 3rd Seat Vul. and 4th Seat|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kareno: But vul 3rd & 4th it goes up to 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: I didn't think NS were playing a polish club here|pg||
nt|brgpro: think NS can make 4@s because of the @d10 from S, so declarer won't get forced|pg||
nt|chick: what would you lead from the W hand if S plays in 6N?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|d|nt|brgpro: sorry|pg||
nt|mariner1: not a @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: thought @dJ was in E|pg||
nt|clarsen: he will get tapped di 10 wont be of any help|pg||
nt|mariner1: in 3N you lead @D, in 6 with strong hand in S you don't|pg||
nt|kareno: High enough.  I guess they play some sort of phony stayman where 2@s after 2@d would not be invitational.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I would think crawling stayman perhaps|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Johnson was probably planning on bidding 2@h as Pass or Correct over 2@d|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that's what it's called.|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 1N worked well here|pg||
nt|kareno: Why not simply 2@s?|pg||
nt|viren169: South may have pushed too much had North open 1@S|pg||
nt|kareno: They have a very fancy system over 1nt |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Because opposite a 2=3=x=x hand, you will often want to play 2@H there :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: it looked to me in the endgame, if N pitches the @C Queen on the @D he could claim the rest|pg||
nt|daman: for -1|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|brgpro: for some reason i saw @dJ in E's hand:)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: So 2@H just shows 4-4+ majors and asks partner to pick his best major|pg||
mc|9|nt|daman: maybe he didn't cash the @S Queen and played a @C instead|pg||
nt|daman: that would work|pg||
nt|mariner1: so I guess a passive @H would be my choice|pg||

nt|Walddk5: I am so nice, that's why|pg||
nt|mariner1: its probably is driving the Vegas odds makers mad! :)|pg||
nt|joest: yes did you know that Roland runs a bridge booking operation on the side?|pg||
nt|joest: just kidding Roland! :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|joest: even opposite the most maniacal of preempts...|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm sure they have a method to get in here.|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure I like 1N with that hand...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: part score or big trouble here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Woolsey would work nicely here, but I think NS play Meckwell here|pg||
nt|kareno: That's one of the problems with forcing clubs.|pg||
mb|2C!|an|could be longer than !ds|nt|kareno: You can't open that hand 1@c and if your system doesn't like 2@c you're stuck.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, he's backed into 1NT here|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: seems a t/o double in order although it won't work well|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mtvesuvius: Yeah, and it looks like they are getting there|pg||
nt|brgpro: how do u call it? Morton's fork something like that? i dont know the exact English form|pg||
nt|daman: good balance|pg||
nt|viren169: Now N/S will find their @H fit|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: Roland can't do that, he has no free time :)|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@H a good club raise|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and we have the Main person behind this wonderful thing called BBO with us, in here :)|pg||

nt|viren169: looking for trouble...|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Platnick's double is takeout here, and they will probably get to 2@s|pg||
nt|kareno: Vulnerable that's too daring for me!!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: JD stuck bidding 3 card suit again,|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Diamond has nothing better to do than to bid 2@s|pg||
nt|kareno: South has shown tolerance for spades.|pg||

nt|3for3: I don't see Sheri at all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: but close|pg||
nt|joest: for a while I wondered how he did it|pg||
nt|joest: I have given up|pg||
nt|joest: Lamprey is close to a penalty double here.|pg||
nt|kareno: Considering that spades may well be bunched in south, I don't like this reopening by east.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: West appears to be trying to protect his K@D|pg||
nt|clarsen: this is reasonable not best on this layout|pg||
nt|joest: this lead will cause west to guess how to play it|pg||
nt|joest: lead a diamond up or a club up|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he has to guess which finesse to take|pg||
nt|joest: protecting the king of diamonds was a reasonable move|pg||
nt|joest: we can see the stiff diamond; he can't|pg||
nt|clarsen: yes i think so also|pg||
nt|joest: he looks to have four tricks inhand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: That's true, but "Co-main people" doesn't sound as good :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mtvesuvius: 2@c just shows both minors... 5-4 or better either way|pg||

nt|joest: there's something to be saide for playing a diamond the king early b/c it's not so clear they will play @Ds back even if it loses|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brgpro: run 7@s and N has to come down to 3@h and @c Kx, then he can play 4 rounds of @h to throw N in|pg||

nt|jcwla: Probably Rosner's choice not to compete on to 3@H with four trumps will earn a couple imps.|pg||
nt|daman: the others will be here around 4 or 5|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@S on 35 came home in the OR so that's 6 to Beatty.|pg||

mb|1H|nt|jcwla: Whew.|pg||
nt|viren169: lucky game here... tough to bid here...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|clarsen: 1h is a transfer i presume|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: whoops, that didn't come out well|pg||
nt|joest: double here brings both majors into play and avoids the danger of a direct 1NT overcall at unfavorable opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: W opened 1@D in Open Room so E plays the 3N|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Moss "I might have sold you short"|pg||

nt|mariner1: needs to duck this|pg||
nt|viren169: East wil be interested here... 2@D as good raise?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It should be, however I like a 1NT by east instead of 1@H|pg||
nt|3for3: unfavorable, with a broken suit an junk on the side, pass seems fine|pg||
nt|3for3: I might have tried 3@D by Moss, if that suggests a fit |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Fit jumps here should apply I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Simson looking from his hand to the tray with the auction and back|pg||

nt|daman: this is all too strange for me|pg||
nt|daman: be that as it may, he now has to declare|pg||
nt|viren169: dont like 1@H with such a bad suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: unfortunately double also brings diamonds into the picture  :)|pg||
nt|clarsen: now we see the downside to the double|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: wow!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Or the other option is just to blast game :)|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 1@h worked well|pg||
nt|viren169: was 1@S forcing?|pg||
nt|viren169: for 1-round?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Greco and Hampson got a bit overboard on  21... 5@c down 3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: well he is lucky, sort of, that S has the Ace|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joest: Thank you partner! |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, 2@h or 3@c seems best for EW, but theres not much hope of finding that|pg||
nt|joest: well west MIGHT reason to yank to 2NT in which case east pulls to 3@c but that's good guessing|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@s would have been a good save, since both pointed suit finesses work|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: However 4@h is the normal spot|pg||
nt|3for3: not likely to be tried.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Moss has been studying for all this time now looks about ready to play |pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: Aces|pg||
nt|joest: I personally think four point ranges are a little wide for 1NT|pg||
nt|joest: too wide|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kareno: I've no idea.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: By a passed hand? Probably NF Constructive|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: no one said it was forcing|pg||

pc|d7|nt|mtvesuvius: that's tough though...|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|joest: if they could guess that well they would have been in 6@s on the last hand :)|pg||
nt|daman: eliminating the shrapnel|pg||
nt|jcwla: The OR auction on 36 went 1@H-3@D overcall-3@H, and looks to be making, so as predicted likely 2 to McKellar.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kareno: No but it's pretty normal :)  |pg||
nt|kareno: Platnick has been taking aggressive views and this one pays off.|pg||
nt|viren169: Lots of discussion on new suits as NF in competition after pd overcalls|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: I agree Jack|pg||
pc|h2|nt|clarsen: im not sure this is best way to play this hand|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|mtvesuvius: I think it's best just to play trumps, but trying to ruff spades in hand is appealing also|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|viren169: certainly paid off here!|pg||
nt|kareno: I play new suit nf after one-level overcall.  Invitational after 2 level overcall and forcing after overcall of a preempt by opponents.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|joest: you don't hve lots of entries to ruff spades|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcwla: So the actual score through the first 6 comparisons (31-36) is Beatty 68, McKellar 56.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: so this not going well for W|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|viren169: good agreement to have with pd...|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I'm all about agreements :)|pg||
nt|viren169: I play F1 at 1-level and NF at 2 and 3-level|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, I play them pretty much the same, but I think by an Unpassed hand it should be forcing 1 round|pg||
nt|kareno: Well new suit at 2 level after one-level overcall should definitely be regressive IMO.|pg||
nt|viren169: Mike Lawerence has written a good book on this topic...|pg||
nt|kareno: He's written great books on many topics!|pg||
nt|viren169: I think it is called Overcalling... good book for serious partnerships|pg||
nt|viren169: yes - I agree...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, he has... I have most of them somewhere in my room... :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|3for3: One doesn't normally save red verus white without some chance of making.  too narrower a target|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: 3@c is Minors with Less than Invitational|pg||

mb|4D|nt|kareno: Platnick actively overcalling again - a good idea, I think, against forcing club.|pg||

mb|d|nt|joest: they're going to get a heart ruff early on or they're not|pg||

nt|kareno: Club preempt a little rich even for Platnick.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh, they played it|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes :)|pg||
mb|2N!|an|Puppet Stayman|nt|viren169: at red?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: One way or another, even if Pepsi invites|pg||
nt|3for3: from the unluckier side|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Played by North, then it was a lot easier to lead a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would also have led a heart on the auction|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|clarsen: may not make though|pg||
nt|daman: who will blink first?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: well.....yes, but difficult to end up in N|pg||
nt|joest: unless his system makes him bid 2@hhere|pg||
nt|brgpro: the S hand is not enough for a transfer then GF 3@H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: That's for sure, their gadget helped them there|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|daman: not Moss  |pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: what is the range of 1NT?|pg||
nt|kareno: Tough range.  I think south overreached by accepting the game try in the OR.|pg||
nt|kareno: 14-16|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 14-16|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Very unlucky for Moss that Fred had all his values in spades and nothing in hearts|pg||
nt|3for3: sure partner can have the AK of @H and the QJ of @S for example|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: calm 2@H here|pg||
nt|kareno: This I'm told is inviational to game with 5 hearts.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: so he has to start with 2@c then invite with 2@s|pg||
nt|joest: often a 3@h rebid is artificial after a transfer anyway|pg||
nt|clarsen: there are other ways to show invitational 5 -5|pg||
nt|joest: some people always have some sort of 'super accept' anytime they have foru trumps|pg||
nt|joest: here comes 3@h I'm guessing|pg||
nt|mariner1: well not so calm... W sticking neck out RED|pg||
nt|viren169: now they too will get to a poor game|pg||
nt|kareno: South likes his hand but really is at the low end of his range.  Makes a natural try in diamonds.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: that is a daring balance|pg||
nt|joest: I'm not sure why Moss hasn't already bid 3@c but...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Bathroom break|pg||
nt|joest: there's my answer! :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: E not thrilled with his options here|pg||
nt|chick: in the middle of an auction :)|pg||
nt|chick: maybe he's hoping that when he gets back, his hand will be better :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Mike very unhappy about last board, as you might imagine|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: back from bathroom, still not bid anything|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and Simson denies it, and 3@H is where they should play|pg||
nt|viren169: South has 3 hearts... with a min best is 3@H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: hmm... I guess they play bidding a major here shows a 4 by 1 with the shortness in bid major|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: I think that JOhnson said that 3@c showed at least 1 4-card Major and 3@h showed shortness, but not sure - could have been 3@h showed 4 spades|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|brgpro: 3@h? i doubt it is in their system|pg||
nt|joest: i have a hard time seeing how this one fetches|pg||
nt|brgpro: and W has some sort of "Nat" !10 lead|pg||
nt|clarsen: thats one way there are others|pg||
nt|brgpro: @d10|pg||
nt|chick: 3@C = nope, my hand didn't improve while I was gone|pg||
nt|mariner1: W might be on Tilt (poker term)|pg||
nt|joest: nor surprisingly Sanborn did not find the balance in the open room and n-s have been left to play 2@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: nothing wrong with his hand, Brian's however ...|pg||
nt|viren169: well done!|pg||
pc|c7|nt|daman: Moss stampeded them into this although 4@H looks like a make|pg||
nt|chick: no double, really?|pg||
nt|joest: who has a double?|pg||
nt|chick: N?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|joest: his partner has not shown any values|pg||
nt|mariner1: S might not have anything|pg||
nt|joest: as long as n-s beat this thing, then they will hold their loss to an imp|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ok, Thanks Jan|pg||
nt|3for3: looks like a dull 3nt|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yep|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|daman: uh oh again|pg||
nt|chick: S doesn't have anything |pg||
nt|kareno: If they can't play in 2 @h :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 18Â½ hours on the trot, that must be enough (1;30 am here). I bid you all good night, see you tomorrow|pg||
pc|dK|nt|clarsen: i doubt he will make this even as ewell as he plays|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Well, this lead will help Pepsi a little, but it's still down|pg||
nt|joest: east has very powerful spade spots over dummy.  |pg||
nt|joest: actually i only see eight tricks|pg||
nt|brgpro: even @c doesnt come in....|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, there are only 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|clarsen: he has 9 by drawing trumps i believe|pg||
nt|joest: a diamond back after the spade loses does a   on his communications|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D lead helps|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Good Night, Roland|pg||
mc|10|nt|clarsen: ah yes|pg||

nt|daman: McKellar should get a few back on that one|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@S is going one down in the OR, so 4 coming to McKellar.|pg||
nt|joest: this might well be quite competitive|pg||

mb|1D!|an|can be short|mb|p|nt|mariner1: N needs to remain calm here|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: Archie is always calm|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brgpro: well, he believed the lead was from Doubleton, so....this was the only way he could manage|pg||
nt|joest: I think you can pass and then Michaels, describing your hand quite well|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 6@c is good.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: From what I saw in the OR, it looks like Greco and Hampson had a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd like to have seen west NOT overruff, though.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and another Nebulous @d here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: I would open if I had tartan or something similar, but otherwise it's pretty safe to pass and see what develops|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu2: out of the box then back in with X card|pg||
nt|joest: east passed it out with 14 in the open room!|pg||
nt|joest: he did not like his stiff spade|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mtvesuvius: Pass missing, Steve|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: whatever this all means it's heading to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|clarsen: 2di presumably shows some min hand|pg||
nt|brgpro: they better play NT from W|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@c is 10+ no 4CM, possible 3C or longer dia |pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: looks like the bidding is a little random here...|pg||
nt|kareno: When opponents seem to be having an accident, don't double if you can't beat every other contract they might play.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Some ultra-agressive bidding by Platnick :) In fact it looks like him and Johnson swapped hand :)|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm talking about the OR auction, folks.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|joest: Isn't it Pearson's Rule where you add HCP +   of spades in fourth seat?  If 14 or higher you open|pg||
nt|mariner1: almost hard to believe passout in Open Room|pg||
nt|chick: it's Cansino count|pg||
nt|joest: it maybe both|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Correct, and I'm against many types of lead directing doubles|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3NT looks pretty doomed|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcwla: On 39 in the OR, South did not bid 2@S over 2@H, and West jumped to 4@H over 2@H and is playing there.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Pearson = Cansino :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Surely Simson didn't pass.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: a ha|pg||
nt|joest: a little piece of bridge history|pg||
nt|joest: or bridge theft|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|chick: yep|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|brgpro: well...from E, if S leads from his longest suit...|pg||
nt|clarsen: what will pepsi lead|pg||
nt|joest: diamond ten?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Tough lead for him, but I think the 3@c isn't too bad|pg||
nt|brgpro: 4th best from longest suit...|pg||
nt|joest: declarer -- given an eternity has nine tricks but I think they get five first|pg||
nt|clarsen: this hand is no picnic esp with club lead|pg||
nt|joest: yeah passing with 14 and a stiff is carrying a good thing to far.  The trailing team has thus let a second straight part score swing go against them|pg||
nt|kareno: So e/w talk n/s out of their club slam.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Is this the real auction? wow lol|pg||
pc|h4|nt|joest: i wonder if ns plays Rusinow|pg||
nt|joest: and it may depend on whether diamonds is |pg||
nt|joest: 'their suit'|pg||
nt|clarsen: i predict down one|pg||
nt|brgpro: still, NS has to find @c shift soon|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: 9d promise one higher|pg||
nt|joest: thx Mila|pg||
nt|brgpro: they lead 2nd 4th?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Attitude leads I think according to their SSF|pg||
nt|jcwla: They are panicking about time with 2 minutes remaining in the OR.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Board 44, the OR also stopped on a dime in 3@S so that should be a push.|pg||
nt|jcwla: A @D trick went away on a @C with a trump lead out in 44, so 1 to Beatty.|pg||
nt|jcwla: WOW!|pg||
nt|jcwla: West in the OR made a very weird responsive-ish double with the 7-heart hand on 45, then PASSED partner's 2@S rebid...|pg||
nt|jcwla: So despite the confusion about the meaning of 4@H in here, Beatty will retake the lead heading into the fourth and final segment.|pg||
nt|jcwla: I don't know if the time pressure got to Lamprey, but there may be plenty of time to regret that sequence after the match.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some thought that the double by W was a xfr to @H's, but in any case the wires got crossed.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Crazy close with 15 to go.  Thanks again to all and for now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mtvesuvius: 2/4th, sorry|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jcwla: An actual 2@D preempt...and it worked.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|viren169: Interesting auction...|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|mtvesuvius: nothing will work for Johnson|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphu2: NS plays standard count and attitude|pg||
nt|joest: a spade return can blow the entry out before the hearts are unblocked.  Not that he would make that play|pg||
nt|clarsen: may ways to beat this now|pg||
nt|joest: but partner probably has the spade ten based on declarer's play|pg||
nt|clarsen: many|pg||
nt|kareno: Spec tells me east passed and south bid 2@h showing a balanced opening bid.  Apparently e/w never entered this auction.|pg||

nt|kareno: Oh, timing the auction wrong for e/w and a pickup for Rogoff here.|pg||
nt|kareno: All credit to Doug Simson for his opening bid :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: not I, but I might venture 3@H with E|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: once he bangs down the heart king he just goes to the club king, hooks the heart jack and powers nine tricks|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, 3rd seat openers at times can be very effective :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 5@d is close as a good sac, but you cannot ruff enough @c in dummy in time|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcwla: 4@H is coming in on 39, so 13 to McKellar.|pg||
nt|joest: but 3@h doesn't invite|pg||
nt|chick: no, it doesn't|pg||
nt|chick: but it helps bar opps from balancing|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to reach game after North's opening...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: as it is, Simson will probably make either 5 or 6 depending on his spade guess|pg||
nt|phil: just a matter of 5 or 6 here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|joest: this will narrow the margin even further|pg||
nt|chick: unless I had a Disciplined weak 2 agreement, I wouldn't brave 4H|pg||

nt|mariner1: 5 imps, 3 to score|pg||
nt|viren169: cant shorten himself enough|pg||
nt|3for3: it could actually be quantative try for 7....depending on what 3nt would be|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Right|pg||
nt|phil: which will no doubt be hearts so some IMPs will be swung|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: One way or another, yes|pg||
nt|3for3: or non forcing|pg||
nt|phil: can 5N ever be non-forcing? :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Discussion of whether he'd make if they didn't cash the second club - Walter said "I guess you can duck out the A of @ss" Brad: "I was pretty confident that was what you had"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Well, they are playing 5NT in the OR|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mtvesuvius: np :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|an|clubs any strength or something else|nt|mariner1: part score only here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Here delayed bidding over a strong club shows values, so Diamond will probably start with a pass and come in later in the auction to show his values|pg||
nt|phil: minor suit stayman Jan? |pg||
nt|3for3: I bet greco gets it right, will see many pitches on the run of the hearts|pg||
mb|3H|nt|clarsen: dbl is an odd choice i think|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Definitely either clubs, in which case any strength, but he said or and something else that I didn't hear"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: CC says 2@S = @C or INV @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Director just came in to check the board number and said "I'm happy now" |pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Probably what it is then :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|joest: interesting call. Pepsi obviously hates his spades :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Many play double by west would show majors.  I play that.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: See: http://usbf.org/docs/2009usbc/acblcards/GitelmanMoss.jpg|pg||
mb|4H|nt|joest: and once again partner responds in a minor|pg||
nt|joest: this will take a while but declarer should stagger home|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer 1@S here|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I play exclusion over a strong club, but would double if Majors|pg||
nt|viren169: and bid 2@H if possible to show 6-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: I know of some pairs that play a method called "clubs on your own" after a double of 1@d :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Correction: North's pass is 0-5, NOT East's|pg||
nt|kareno: Pass by north is either fewer than 5 hcp or a trap.|pg||
nt|viren169: and dble with 5-5 or 6-5 in the majs|pg||
nt|kareno: South can figure it out.|pg||
nt|phil: www.usbf.org for scores, player bios, and 'what have you'|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: And if you make it really big, maybe you'll be able to read it - it was in pencil so didn't scan wonderfully :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: and South should probably reopen with 2@c here, but in this case it worked very well|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yeah :)|pg||
nt|phil: strange, I got an "access forbidden" message when I clicked your link Adam|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 5@c is a good sac, and 5@H is also makable though|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|Vugraphu2: Walter: "let's see the good news" Doug put down the 43 of hearts and Walter said "now there's a trusting partner"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2 overs on this lead, since the club goes on the fast spade and the diamond goes on the slow spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can bigtrain play trump for no losers after this horrendous split?   :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|clarsen: rdbl must have been a transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|joest: I'm guessing RDBL is hearts and the double of 2@c showed a three card raise|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes and double was support probably|pg||
nt|joest: maybe Pepsi is convincing himself his partner could be 4-5 or 46 in which case he has a good hand|pg||
nt|clarsen: might make 2 spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Pepsi is thinking|pg||
nt|mariner1: same spot and lead in Open Room|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@H is being played by Aker in the OR here|pg||
pc|c6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bigtrain = Walter Johnson's BBO handle|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcwla: The missing 12 for Beatty is Board 40, which I'm sure we'll get momentarily.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|joest: well that was the wrong guess|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Pepsi is picturing a 4315 or 4216 hand probably|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3NT is going down 2 so the 3@D+4 in here will be worth 6 to McKellar.|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT was -2 on 41|pg||
pc|h4|nt|clarsen: hard to believe no di lead |pg||
nt|joest: Could partner have held Axxx/xx/xx/KQxxx?|pg||
nt|joest: i agree Chris|pg||
nt|clarsen: i dont think so,he would bid more first time|pg||
nt|daman: still a very close match|pg||
nt|joest: oops|pg||
nt|kareno: Why should south reopen at all if his partner has a bust hand?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|jcwla: For anyone just joining us, the linkup with the OR is not perfect and the score through Board 41 is actually Beatty 82, McKellar 79.|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@h is not unreasonable...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|joest: Axxx/xx/xx/KJxxx with everything breaking well? :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|c8|nt|3for3: bullet dodged for diamond on the 5nt hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all points KNOWN to be in West hand -- this will be easy - and fast|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mariner1: could be tied now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|clarsen: i suppose|pg||
nt|jcwla: This one seems to boil down to getting the @H right.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|joest: turns out a heart lead was the killer|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yep, 2 overtricks and a potential 1 IMP for Rogoff|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mtvesuvius: I guess|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|joest: it tempted Lev|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|cK|nt|jcwla: On Board 42, North in the OR valued their hand as worth a natural and some-values 3@D and South of course bid 3NT.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|daman: on 42   NS are in 3NT in the OR   it will not be a success|pg||
nt|daman: geez|pg||
mc|12|nt|daman: ruffing the @D might have given the trump suit away|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Interesting hand|pg||
nt|viren169: How high with North go?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 5@s is the limit for EW|pg||
nt|kareno: I bid unusual notrump at the 2,4,5 level and would bid 2nt here with north's hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: That's high enough for a start :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: Drury?|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=570&Itemid=260  -|pg||
nt|mariner1: Brackets this is a complicated event|pg||
nt|joest: this is nearing the end of the round of 32 and the "sweet sixteen" will begin in an hour and a half.  eight new matches|pg||
nt|viren169: I paly 2@S here showing better hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: and 2D as better clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: I play 2@s natural in this auction by north.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and North should bid 2NT here, showing a distrubutional hand (I play 1NT as sandwich by an unpassed hand also)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: NS have the power on this hand   will make +140 in @Ss|pg||
nt|joest: great hand for 2@s as a fit showing jump shift by a passed hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, at the 1 and 3 level I play natural notrumps.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@s is certainly natural there, and 2@d can be played as a number of things|pg||
nt|viren169: and 2N as 5-5 (or 6-6!)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mtvesuvius: 4333 wasn't good enough I guess|pg||
nt|clarsen: i dont think that is a limit raise but sam may disagree|pg||
nt|joest: four trumps and two quick tricks.  It's within the realm of reason but pushy|pg||
nt|jcwla: Time to wheel out your favorite 4-card LR gadget.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Looks like maybe a fit jump.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N off in Open Room too, played same way|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@s is nat unless you agree otherwise!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Diamond will be backing into bidding "only" 4@s now|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: backed*|pg||
mb|2S|an|to play|nt|clarsen: 2nt now maybe|pg||
nt|joest: the standards for Drury seem to be dropping btw :)|pg||
nt|joest: a quiet 3@s seems indicatedhere|pg||
nt|mariner1: atually could be off 2 in Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: Yates conservative again; I agree this is a 2NT balance|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: They have been, but even I wouldn't bid drury with the north hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: was only 1 though so a push|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I wouldn't be suprised|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Only a few minutes left on the clock here, Diamond wants to get this claimed and on the way|pg||
nt|phil: I know Fred doesn't do it as much - I think this 14 is at least as good as Brad's on the last|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and this is an easy make with an overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4432 easier to upgrade last hand than 4333 here - esp with 4 minor|pg||
nt|phil: if Walter goes quietly that is|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Walter asked about 1NT and also whether Brad had ways to invite with spades and Brad said "I have tons of way to bid better hands"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: K&R Hand Evaluator says 14.3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then again --- 6 controls is huge|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: that's a thoughtful bid.  He thinks the kingof hearts is worth a bit more than it is but that's understandable|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S flower or fit showing|pg||
nt|joest: How can McKellar not own up to three card spade support??|pg||
nt|chick: well, he has 13 pts, half in quacks, and the opps are cuebidding his suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Chuck wrote D+S, maybe Archie thinks something different|pg||
nt|joest: although 5@d may be better than 4@s assuming one can guess the spade jack|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|phil: anyone overcall 1@h with Walter's? |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|joest: this may well work by picking up a swing nonetheless|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Lamprey was thinking, obviously|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in Open sitting in 4@D at the moment|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Pitch a @d and play @s ASAP here|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|joest: but their fates are in the hands of the open room|pg||
nt|mariner1: auction still open|pg||
nt|joest: same fit showing jump shift in open but north raised spades |pg||
nt|mariner1: same spot,,,,,,,,4 @D in Open Room|pg||
nt|joest: we'll never know what Brian would have led against 4@s|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has a couple of guesses to make|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H led in Open Room|pg||
pc|cT|nt|viren169: I thing 5@C would have tested E/W|pg||
nt|viren169: ...think...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Well, 5@c could get killed|pg||
nt|viren169: I've been killed before!|pg||
nt|viren169: usually the opps go overboard|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Simson: "you never put a dummy like that down for me" Johnson: "I've already upgraded that"|pg||

mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: As always, Jan Martel has been instrumental in setting up a great show for the whole world to watch, and thanks to all the spectators for your helpful comments, we will be back at ...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 7:00 am Los Angeles, 10:00 am New York, 16.00 Paris, 3:00 pm London, 12:00 am Monday Sydney with more! See you then, goodbye for now. :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: many thanks to the specs, those comments and tips really do help us!|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room same start but W rebid 2@S over the 2@H|pg||
nt|joest: I think Brian should own up to the ace of clubs after which they blackwood to slam and end this match|pg||
pc|h9|nt|daman: oh no|pg||
nt|kareno: How many clubs??  I think I would bid one more for luck :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Walter: "sorry if we missed something"|pg||
pc|h3|nt|viren169: Thks to all the specs too... (especially the ones who have been correcting me!)|pg||
nt|kareno: However, now Diamond and Platnick are playing their grand slam in game.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: wow, this is not the greatest spot|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: where was the green card?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Gerard is taking a very long time in 3NT on 42, players there are getting worried about possible lateness issues with time for this segment whittling down.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Sometimes pre-empts work|pg||
nt|viren169: missed opportunity|pg||
nt|kareno: Club lead costs NOTHING ;)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|joest: looks like that touch and go 3NT went down in the closed room for 12 much needed imps for Yates|pg||
nt|clarsen: 4h may require some play presuming they get there but i guess he will make|pg||
nt|mariner1:   http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&task=list&event=14  - Teams|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2009/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof32  -|pg||
nt|mariner1: scores when updated|pg||
nt|chick: they heard you, Jack :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: lol :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Very possible swing to Rogoff here.  |pg||
nt|viren169: I suspect they will lose a bucket full of imps here...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Claim time so we can go watch the other room bid this one|pg||
nt|viren169: thks again!|pg||
nt|kareno: Indeed they are playing in 6@d in the OR.  Lucky for Platnick they are not vulnerable.|pg||
nt|kareno: What?  Oh, 6@d on board 14 I hear.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: spot cards were important there|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Milgrim played it extremely well in the OR|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, very unlikely to be made though possible|pg||
nt|kareno: Made it?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: The diamond spots were just right for him|pg||
nt|kareno: Impressive.  Safety play in diamonds then.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Next set is scheduled to start in 10 minutes, tight schedule|pg||
nt|kareno: So it looks like Rogoff will take a lead into the next set.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the rare ruff-sluff at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there was hand yesterday in same hand where North, East and South all had 8 card suit to 100 or 150 honors|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I can imagine:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Doug asks about the 9 - "3rd & low"|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|clarsen: trump lead looks normal|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: this will take some careful play, but it should make I think|pg||
nt|clarsen: i think he may need spade finesse|pg||
nt|joest: i suspect we'll see him start by rising and working spades|pg||
nt|joest: i doubt we will see a spade finesse at single dummy|pg||
nt|clarsen: probably true|pg||
nt|clarsen: doubt he will make without it|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It's tough single dummy, but if he finds out about the trump split he may be backing into it|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: backed into*|pg||
nt|clarsen: may be difficult even then|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|joest: i think he needs the spade hook|pg||
nt|joest: once Brian owns up to the diamond king Moss might mull it over|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@H bid in Open Room , once they get the missed passes out of the way|pg||
nt|joest: he sees 12 tricks|pg||
nt|joest: all he has to do is sign off to win the match|pg||
nt|joest: but brian is unlmited.  He might even have the diamond queen|pg||
nt|chick: unfortunately he has to guess now, no more room for getting info|pg||
nt|joest: that is right|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: would Brian bid 7 with AKQ@D?|pg||
nt|joest: perhaps|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|joest: not that one :)|pg||
nt|joest: the trump lead makes it looks like spades are at his left too|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, but it's fairly normal from this holding|pg||
nt|joest: yes but he can't peer into west's hand to see why it is he led a heart|pg||
pc|c9|nt|joest: that it was really defensive in purpose|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|daman: up Simba|pg||
nt|daman: with apologies to Tarzan|pg||
nt|joest: at least in 7@h he could have attempted to ruff out the QJx of diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: here there is no hope|pg||
nt|mariner1: well a psuedo chance here|pg||
nt|joest: or seemingly nonoe|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|clarsen: not clear why he would choose di 9|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right, the only way to really know would be to play a second round of trumps, then he has a better idea|pg||
nt|joest: i guess he coudl play for both majors breaking and the club ace onside|pg||
nt|joest: five spades four hearts plus a club|pg||
nt|chick: nice safe passive lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to hope NS get mixed up in discards|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: 6@d was one king|pg||
nt|joest: it is a very interesting question whether brian would go with the diamond queen or with the spade king together with the diamond king|pg||
nt|chick: a kib makes a good suggestion .. 6@S for a grand slam try|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|joest: I'm afraid this is a pseudo squeeze or nothing at all|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|joest: once he doesn't claim the defenders know very well that the match will probably depend on their beating this|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
mc|10|nt|mtvesuvius: ok, thanks all :)|pg||
nt|phil: thanks all|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: see you tommorow!|pg||
nt|3for3: good night all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Adam, Phil -- thanks for letting me crash these last few hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this match ends tomorrow  2 more 15-board sets|pg||
