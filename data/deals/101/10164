nt|henryb: The Robinson team have been close many times, and only Fleisher and Granovetter have never represented the US before on the Fleisher team|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: N/S play a canape oriented strong club. their 2-level openings are often 2-suited (except 2@s and sometimes 2@c)|pg||

nt|brolucius: Only an expert pair can stop in 4NT. Other players will say 'Well, I'd better show my aces, just in case.'|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Here is an interesting point. What would 4NT be now? Quantitative with 4 hearts or keycard asking for spades? You need to have a clear agreement with your partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4NT is generally played as a limit bid (non-forcing) after either stayman or a transfer response.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For me it would be quantitative. I need to go through a cue bid first to set spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: With North's shape he should be looking for 34 points in order to make 6NT worthwhile.|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: Typical - to use 3 of opp Maj to show fit (slam)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 4@C would be keycard ask for N-S here I am told|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are only 10 top tricks if the diamond finesse is right. You still need an extra spade and an extra heart. Not a good slam at all. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I like Richie's approach better. 3 of the opposite major as a slam try for opener's suit|pg||
nt|reisig: besides ..easy  to remember :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it does not have much of a role to play otherwise, so why not use it for that?|pg||
nt|henryb: I actually play it the other way around: 4@c is a balanced slam try and 4@d as keycard, since I want to leave room for "Last train" over 4@c|pg||

nt|brolucius: The tables have kept pace with each other and will now play Board 15 simultaneously.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set now. Many thanks to Dan Wolkowitz, our splendid operator in White Plains. Great job!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|an|multi|nt|reisig: 1540 might create a swing too :)|pg||
nt|henryb: Kamil chose the unfortunate lead of a @s against 6@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to my excellent fellow commentators: David Bird, Henry Bethe and Richie Reisig|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: E/W play multi, 2@h=flannery, 2@s=10-13|pg||
nt|henryb: a club would not have been better|pg||
nt|brolucius: A spade lead was in response to partner's apparent Lightner Double.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finally, our appreciation to the USBF for bringing this prestigious event to BBO vugraph. As usual, Jan Martel has been instrumental in setting up a magnificent show for the whole ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: world to watch ... free of charge!|pg||
nt|henryb: yes, many have said that; still unfortunate|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|an|pass/correct|nt|Walddk2: Play will resume in 15-20 minutes, slight delay possible. Welcome back then|pg||
nt|henryb: Ekeblad thought he could take a chance on beating 2@d :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Double looks right on the South cards, to show some life.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb: or 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|brolucius: Yes, that's the alternative.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|reisig: 1640 swing|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: Well, there is a lot of luck involved in this swing (unlike the four other big swings that I mentioned a few minutes ago).|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: will robinson cover the @sJ?|pg||
nt|henryb: not many imps difference between being +630 and -100|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, if West does not cover the @SJ ('I wanted to give him a guess, partner!"), that will give away the slam.|pg||
nt|reisig: Only if Boyd wins it|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: it's completely unclear where the ace of spades is|pg||
nt|brolucius: West could hold up the @SA if there was no trump entry to the dummy at that stage.|pg||
nt|henryb: even if he does not; the @d10 is an entry|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Ekeblad asked about Suit Preference - Robinson replied that queens and tens are high, jacks and nines are low|pg||

nt|brolucius: If the club finesse had worked, declarer had the option of finessing the @D7 to gain an extra entry to dummy for setting up the clubs.|pg||
