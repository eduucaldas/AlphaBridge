nt|vugraphu4: players discussing various defenses to certain bids|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: will resume shortly|pg||
nt|ady: looks like a part score hand up first|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi and welcome all|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: hello everyone, players discussing systems|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: will begin momentarily|pg||
nt|andyv:  that could prove to be helpful:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Matt|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: NS play alot of unusual systems, strong club, with canope bids, alot of relays|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: as well as unique 2 level openers etc.|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: EW play transfer responses to a short 1@c opener, |pg||
nt|andyv:  and a change of players too|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: system summaries can be found by clicking on players names http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&task=list&event=14|pg||
nt|andyv:  N/S will be playing a strong club system and E/W 2/1|pg||
nt|raghavan: Wc all Kibits|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|raghavan: This is segment 3 of QF|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC Matt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello everyone from Manchester UK|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hedyg: last 15 boards of the round of 16|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Hello everyone and welcome back to White Plains, New York, for the 2009 United States Bridge Championship. Quarter-finals, four segments of 15 boards; this is the first|pg||
nt|ady: north likely to open with 6-5 distribution      whoever plays  should not go above 2 level    |pg||
nt|finch: The 'intermediate' two (often in combination with a multi) is very fashionable at the moment|pg||
nt|gosia: hello|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Your commentators are Frances Hinden, David Edwin, Paul Van de Maele and Danny Sprung|pg||
nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
nt|ady: good even all|pg||
nt|3for3: That 2@S is a 'good' weak 2|pg||
nt|ady: yes   many would open 1 spade|pg||
nt|3for3: this is systemic for them|pg||
nt|finch: west has a tricky call, a choice between 4@D, 4@H and pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Margie|pg||
nt|mcarroll: evening all|pg||
nt|gosia: Ozdil a bit outclassed here - but could surprise , as they have all week|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Martin|pg||
nt|gosia: hi Andy|pg||
nt|gosia: Martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: ok so they have started play already|pg||
nt|ady: looks to me  whoever plats will be too high|pg||
pc|d5|nt|raghavan: starts today with 3 Singletons and a void|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tylere: Hi folks|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT-2@c-2@H-3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: +4?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i really dont see how|pg||
nt|hedyg: did NS manage to disc all their black cards?|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Tyler Eaves :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Tyler|pg||
nt|tylere: appears to be a trick one claim, I don't see any play on the hand|pg||
nt|hlortz: making 6 on a @H lead is believable|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is a typo in South's name operator|pg||
nt|Walddk4: r missing in Milgrim|pg||
nt|hedyg: no the operator seems to have a problem|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: what does dbl show     a good wseak 2?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Margie, Andy|pg||
nt|gosia: :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: a great deal of fireworks from this identical table last night, hopefully today lives up to expectations :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: If H Q is finessed- making 7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|finch: North's double often described as "action" saying I want to act but I'm doubling in case you want to defend|pg||
nt|ady: this could be expensive|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d minimum... and 2@h relay (with help from specs)|pg||
nt|gosia: I comm - Robinson/Rogoff - wonder if they had late penalties ?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c2|nt|andyv:  don't have it at fingertips... will get it in one minute but it's under USBF|pg||
nt|gosia: lots of bidding here - better come to a screeching halt soon :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: Weichsel head in hands, in the tank, he is well known for being a "deliberate" player|pg||
nt|andyv:  unchartered waters here.  Maybe 4@D is cue with @h support?|pg||
nt|gosia: I first fell asleep kibbitzing Peter in 1970 :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|finch: about 500 I think|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|finch: ...until it was pulled to 5@H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|finch: that's not something you want to do very often.  You know that converting 4@Hx to 5@Hx never looks very good|pg||
nt|ady: think 5@D  likely down 4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A benefit of being at the slow table is that we get to see the Open results|pg||
nt|mcarroll: oops|pg||
nt|gosia: wheels came off here a bit|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: ekeblad says he shows a 5-3-3-2 that didn't want to play nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  like in races, when the baton gets dropped, usually bad things happen.|pg||
nt|gosia: Peter new to this - comes from Precision|pg||
nt|andyv:  system notes on line not much help here...3@d may have been the culprit.|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: weichsel : "we had a mixup p, sorry" |pg||
nt|gosia: Russ plays some Blue tem Club variant|pg||
nt|gosia: Team|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cindy:  still 6 with the spades as they are|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|don paulus: ruff some clubs promotes 8 H in south|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|raghavan: Wc Kath|pg||
pc|s2|nt|finch: three rounds of spades would also have promoted the @H8.  The diamond lead was a pretty good shot however|pg||
mc|12|nt|yo_yo: hi there|pg||

mb|p|nt|don paulus: 1 nt ?|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: some heated words between lair and ozdil, will not repeat, after only the first board :)|pg||

nt|yo_yo: as the animal?|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@H???|pg||
nt|hedyg: operator?|pg||
nt|tylere: 2@H= bal invite|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Tyler|pg||
nt|barnets: how many tricks were made on board 1 please/|pg||
nt|tylere: the 1@D bid promises 5+ @D in an unbalnced hand in 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|barnets: in 3N recorded as7|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Barnet!|pg||
nt|barnets: im next door just checking|pg||
nt|hedyg: we asked, no reply|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: russ and peter are still discussing previous hand through the screen|pg||
nt|gosia: to dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: apparently they have not moved on yet|pg||
nt|gosia: lol- can picture this|pg||
mb|2C|nt|finch: 4@S is more obviously a void. 3@S sounds as if it's looking fr 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: one more    likely shows minors   |pg||
nt|3for3: good action hands to start|pg||
nt|finch: not exactly what south wanted to hear loooking at soft spade values|pg||
nt|3for3: but his minors look great|pg||
nt|finch: 4NT here might be natural. Or it might be saying I don't know what to bid. I bet they've never discused this acution!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and EW putting pressure on|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: that expression is new to me  i must remember it to impress my friends :)|pg||

nt|don paulus: hard to get into slam after ops open|pg||
nt|gosia: oops|pg||
nt|gosia: think Russ worth 4 @d ?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tylere: Not sure. The CC doesn't detail openers rebids|pg||

nt|andyv:  South bid 1N in OR and got rewarded|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|gosia: Melih a bit agressive :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  hard to say if worth a 4@d bid....maybe 3@h followed by 4@d if pd can't bid 3N...S hand already limited|pg||
nt|gosia: I think Russ worth a boost even though Peter showed 5 or less|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tylere: this is probably -1|pg||
nt|hedyg: @H lead?|pg||
nt|tylere: A@D maybe?|pg||
nt|tylere: @H would be my second choiuce|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|hedyg: often trump is best when you and pd hold the majority of hcps|pg||
nt|hlortz: so this should be a couple of IMPs to EW|pg||
nt|tylere: I notice that 3N has been changed to = in both rooms now|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok, more like it|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|hedyg: best he can do now is take in hand and play @s hoping for split honours|pg||

nt|hedyg: that would be for -1|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|raghavan: Oh |pg||
mb|p|nt|tylere: 1@C = @C or balanced|pg||
nt|gosia: cover your eyes novices /newcomers :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h bid pretty aggressive with this vul|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gosia: Peter must be steaming to make that call at these colors :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and Russ introducing a pressure cooker?|pg||
nt|gosia: will be rewarded no less :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tylere: if balanced, not in strong NT range|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|hedyg: so this is unbalanced for them|pg||
nt|finch: double will get South excited, but the heart lie means this is a dangerous spot|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   a good contract for n/s    but 5-0 split of trumps does not help|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  extra reward?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: 1400   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: East trusting his partner to have some values for a vul against not overcall|pg||
nt|andyv:  cards all wrong for E/W|pg||
nt|mcarroll: an 18 HCP vul game|pg||
nt|gosia: Peter will take a long time to play this unless they lead trumps for him|pg||
nt|andyv:  a spec says trump lead holds it to 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: seems to be able to make quite a few @cs in NS|pg||
nt|tylere: yes..but if it's bid it probably has to be by south, and south is happy in 2@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: shot in the arm for Ozdil|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: and EW might find the better @d contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: unusual lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: if this goes down 1 another IMP to ew|pg||
nt|tylere: the top+bottom two suiter problem again...in a couple of partnerships I've played various ways of showing that combo, just to avoid this problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: N should be short in @s, thus unbalanced with @cs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|raghavan: Here Ozdil goes down |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: so why not lead pd's suit?|pg||
nt|andyv:  with trump lead, declarer should be able to make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will he run for home or @H Blockage here?|pg||
nt|raghavan: No block|pg||
nt|cindy:  wonder if W considered 4@s   he has suit oriented cards (not notrump)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he can hope|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  this certainly not hurting S|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: looks like down 1|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|don paulus: 1 or 2 ?|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|finch: looks making to me if declarer picks it|pg||

nt|hlortz: cash|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hlortz: after the oddj@H lead|pg||
nt|gosia: gotta play a heart to table Peter - |pg||
pc|h6|nt|finch: it only has 3 losers now (2 clubs and a heart) as long as it doesn't lose control - a club lead would have|pg||
nt|finch: ...forced the high trump hand and beaten it|pg||
nt|andyv:  duck?|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ady: n/s   have 11 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|gosia: he really didn't have much choice|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR in 3N on this hand, down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: another big hand - NS can make 11 tricks in hearts and EW 10 in diamonds|pg||
nt|vbman: now a michaels may lead to a right lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: e/w   trying to barrage  opps out of contract|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   tht east had bid 4@D|pg||
nt|finch: North has a nice hand for the majors, but should probably stick to 4@H only as South may have stretched a little to get to the right spot|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1@S i mean|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vbman: melih may pull some back|pg||
nt|ady: hope south wont overvalue the void diamond|pg||

mb|3S|nt|hlortz: welcome|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe he bids differently with a good lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Hi Tyler, Hedy and Henry :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Meckwell here it looks like|pg||
nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
nt|hlortz: so ew are chipping away at the lead looks like 4 imps for making 2@D|pg||
nt|tylere: looks like they'll do rather better here than in the other room, where they ended up in 2@H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hi Danny :)|pg||
nt|3for3: looks like 4 or 5 for diamond for bidding the better part score|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Danny!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This was an interesting problem for Rogoff in the OR|pg||
nt|finch: now a matter of how much South think he's already shown - and clearly he thinks he's minimum|pg||
nt|ady: e/w save in 6@D   -500|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 4@H also possible|pg||
nt|cindy:  got them to 4@h and at the other table his side never got in the bidding|pg||
nt|cindy:  4@h making|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|3for3: DF makes 3@D, but I think that requires a spade to the ten when in with the only dummy entry|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: or later :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He had to decide whether to pass 2@d which was 1M or to bid 2@h allowing for if his partner had @s|pg||
nt|hlortz: make 2 make 3 same 4 imps...|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like 4@h, 2@c and 3@d are there for the taking|pg||

nt|cindy:  here :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphu4: Shi fingered for the king, put it back, then played the @h A :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: I am usually called Rag|pg||
nt|cindy:  ok rag|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well Rag I might play Ace when i have a singleton and want my partner to give me a ruff|pg||
nt|yo_yo: However that message was lost on Yang|pg||
nt|raghavan: But here E played HA though having HK|pg||
nt|raghavan: He wanted a D ruff|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes but didnt get it|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  in OR, W covered J@h and N was unable to get to his hand after that|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i see now ty|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|hedyg: @s finesse for free now, might as well try it|pg||
nt|finch: Declarer will probably play two trumps before spades, in case West is 1174|pg||
nt|finch: (although many 1174s would have opened 4@D)|pg||
nt|finch: sorry, that doesn't work, dummy runs out of trumps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, it cannot hurt|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||

nt|gosia: Mike Kamil nicest guy and great player|pg||
pc|h5|nt|raghavan: anyhow 3S down 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Weichsel stops to count the hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: HQ?|pg||
nt|raghavan: loser on loser|pg||
nt|Vugraphu4: Weichsel : "This is a mighty fine pickle here"|pg||

mb|p|nt|3for3: diamond picking up some loose change...which could change the match :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: looks like 4S EW|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mtvesuvius: 1@h shows 2 or 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  little slower auction here than OR|pg||
mb|3S|nt|finch: North somewhat disappointed that South didn't reopen|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: After that lead, South knows that partner has a spade void|pg||
nt|raghavan: Kath - do EW play forcing NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mtvesuvius: This is a pretty easy 3N or 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@d is more @hs?|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: a lot of wxplaining going on|pg||
nt|3for3: this kind of bidding, even though it is not complicated, will forever keep bridge from becoming a spectator sport (bbo afficionados notwithstanding)|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: on both sides of table|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont know their system but it looks like it |pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: ty Al|pg||
nt|gosia: I like Lairs (north) Take out dbl - get in and out fast|pg||

pc|c2|nt|mtvesuvius: This is rightsided in this case\|pg||
nt|hedyg: so all that is known of the S hand is that he has no 3+ @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: more explanations before opening lead|pg||
nt|cindy:  rare 4th best lead|pg||
pc|cT|nt|3for3: west needs to shift to a diamond to hold the extra overtrick|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@s or 10|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  6 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|yo_yo: why rare Cindy?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hlortz: ew are having a great board-a-match game but few imps being won|pg||
nt|3for3: the black suits look fairly hopeless|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Close match here, every IMP counts|pg||
nt|hedyg: now N has the 9@s for finessing @s and is not blocked|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Correct, everything works nicely for Declarer here|pg||
nt|hedyg: @c lead by W in OR|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Greco may find a @d switch here|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: n is further explaining|pg||
nt|hedyg: he knows his pd has 4@hs|pg||
nt|andyv:  need club switch|pg||

nt|hedyg: there goes the @D trick|pg||
nt|yo_yo: usually 3/5 in USA?|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes|pg||

nt|yo_yo: 2/4|pg||
nt|cindy:  i like 2/4 but cant find a partner that does :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|mtvesuvius: and so a push|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no, it doesnt seem to meet with approval playing online |pg||

pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  lone honors usually make NT difficult to play|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: ask if E has K@s and claim|pg||
pc|d6|nt|raghavan: He has setup D for 2 H discard |pg||

pc|h2|nt|hedyg: about the 1@s bid?|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to tell who expected what from this auction|pg||
nt|gosia: maybe 2 @h mechanical error - once on the tray can't take it back|pg||
nt|andyv:  and only thing i was wondering was whether to bid 2@S or 2@D over 1N with the S hand|pg||
nt|gosia: for those who watched Women's trials I learned the hard way|pg||

nt|ady: south will avoid no-trumps one partner has shown both minors|pg||
nt|gosia: must play Aces Scientific 3@c forcing raise|pg||

nt|andyv:  or 2 way jacoby|pg||
nt|gosia: that's seems silly - never heard of it ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  5! exclusion?|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: Shi in the tank :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2n=4 trump and 16+hcp|pg||
nt|gosia: 2nt natural and forcing over 1 of a suit is so comfortable :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: I bet he will be forced to make at least 2 bids, if not more|pg||
nt|finch: South could have temporised with 3@S which would also get the job done, but this is probably simpler|pg||
nt|ady: east is going to be on lead   so 5 will bed the limit    there will not be a wrong lead|pg||

nt|raghavan: They made 3NT in OR|pg||
nt|raghavan: HK was the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: South close betwen 1@S and 2@S, but with both opponents bidding he knows he'll get another go if necessary|pg||

mb|4C!|nt|ady: 4@H   makes e/w     but should not be bid   needs good trump position plus diamond finesse|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: always a dilemma now whether to show the 5 card major |pg||
nt|yo_yo: you were right Rag |pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx rare |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|finch: 2NT often played as a relay, particularly if you like raising with 3-card support frequently|pg||
nt|finch: 4@S likely to show a maximum weak NT with 4 trumps|pg||
nt|andyv:  wrong sided the contract|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: will east play the king?|pg||
nt|finch: that's a storming lead.  I was expecting a diamond which makes life fairly easy for declarer|pg||

nt|Walddk4: You need a few things to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c=?|pg||

nt|Vugraphu4: Shi pulled out the 4@h put it back and elected for the diamond, good choice :)|pg||

nt|finch: Ozdil might have made a (light) take-out double over 1@C, which would have got the heart fit into the game|pg||

nt|ady: could be dangerous  to bid|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: lucky drop of J10@c|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and that will give declarer 7 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N shows @ss?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|3for3: surround play of the 9@D there|pg||

nt|hlortz: ah def has attacked those|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: he may, and the T@D gives him that option|pg||
nt|hlortz: rite|pg||
nt|finch: with a short club on his left and opponents clearly light on high cards, he deduces that partner must have club length|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vbman: a partnertship need study a lot for this|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

pc|c8|nt|hedyg: trying for a @s as 7th trick|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, and Hampson can no longer knock out his @d entry, since then he will establish declarer's @d suit|pg||
nt|don paulus: saved by the bell|pg||
nt|finch: either that or he meant 2@C as the majors|pg||
nt|ady: south might have made a discretionary pass of 2@C    |pg||

nt|ady: turned a good plus into a minus|pg||
pc|dK|nt|finch: 2@C might also have been intended as clubs and another|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: lair asked if any agreement on 2@c, said they don't have a specific agreement|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|finch: nothing like the quarterfinals of the trials for inventing new system (!)|pg||

mb|1N|nt|andyv:  they will have their work cut out for them.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: the 4-4 fit in hearts fails if defence can find a spade ruff    might make 4@S   |pg||

mb|2S|nt|gosia: these guys don't bid their suits ever :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx to co commentators and Matt Kibits, Roland and BBO |pg||

mb|p|nt|mcarroll: I think they tease us a bit|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least not too much to wrong side on this hand.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: they actually seem to bid each other's suits|pg||
pc|h5|nt|3for3: 2@S is even tougher|pg||
nt|3for3: 12 facing 10 and only 8 card fit...so no surprise game not bid|pg||

pc|cK|nt|finch: I'd rather swap the black suits round before doubling, or am I just being too picky?|pg||
nt|3for3: I love doubling 1 of a minor|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|3for3: plenty of landing spots.  much safer than 1 of a major|pg||
