mb|p|nt|caitlin: hey Bill|pg||

pc|cK|nt|raghavan: natural lead of club by N|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: but West won't be interested :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good afternoon Andy and everyone  - from Manchester|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Wilie here!|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Willie:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi there Willie|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yo_yo: nice to be able to watch Michael Rosenberg, he hails from these shores|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|athene: spades are the normal suit to attack here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: the @D7 grows up quite fast|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|athene: but declarer can come to 11 tricks thanks to the nice trump position|pg||
nt|andyv:  6 tricks easy but the 7th might be tough|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the rest I dont know  so Andy will have to fill us in|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: So a flat board for starters this session, there have not been many in previous session|pg||
nt|sater1957:  should be push, basically bidding and play identical at both tables|pg||
nt|raghavan: WC Martin|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|yo_yo: if you like to picture the players  here are some photos: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=545&Itemid=224|pg||
nt|andyv:  Michael Kamil and Martin Fleisher are a well established partnership|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and some more: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=550&Itemid=224|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well Rosenberg is a superstar |pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|athene: declarer can play @CA, trump finesse, then draw trumps and ruff the diamonds good|pg||
nt|athene: but he might not want to do that|pg||
nt|athene: using up the @CA means if the trump finesse loses, he might be in a bit of trouble on a club return, forcing dummy|pg||
nt|athene: and end up unable to bring in the diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: that's playing wide open|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|raghavan: wanted a D|pg||

mc|8|nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Chuck will get player names up as soon as he gets a minute|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think the Moss squad will be sitting on their hands waiting for breaks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chuck will enter names when he gets a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west is Sylvie Moss, North Sasha Cohen, East Migry Campanile, South Rozanne Pollack|pg||
nt|mariner1: slam chance here NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|mariner1: can make 7 finding Q@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: splinter to 4@C?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jump shift to 3@D??|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: 7@H 7@S or 7@D all can make (all on Q@D hunt)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: real key from Sasha's point of view is the @D suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: Key Card now|pg||
nt|daman: Moss team in 6@S on Board 81 in CR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C from Pollack as Exclusion would be great treatment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sasha can't ask -- needs to know way too much that KC won't tell her|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: we have Closed Room up now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|daman: redouble or 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: superfluous dbl -- gives NS more room to sort things out|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moss in Closed Room bid the 6@S on board 81|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: 5@C already said -- no @C loser -- Pollack worried about a) trump  b) missing grand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|daman: I would have bid 5@D    S must have first round @C control|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|mariner1: now S has to sort of guess about N's @S quality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like 5@D too george -- but more because Pollack KNOWS Cohen can't cue in red suit|pg||
nt|daman: missed a big chance to put the opps away|pg||
nt|daman: if they bid the grand in the CR     watch out|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 13 tricks not certain -- need good things to happen in a red suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and decent trump split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and guess which good thing happened :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: so for the puritans, just a question of whether 6@S arrived at convincingly or not -- which gets an extra 5 points :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al no style points?|pg||
nt|daman: my guess is if you were in 7 and had to play it wide open?  you would end up making on a high crossruff after pitching @Ds on the @Hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a sure line for 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well most lines work|pg||
nt|daman: and ruffing @Cs along the way    East cannot get out of her own way on the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure george -- that seems to rely upon @H 33  surely better to try @D first|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|s8|nt|daman: they are in 7 in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and maybe right to play 2nd @D here|pg||
nt|daman: get your popcorn out|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: quick gear shift|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|c5|nt|daman: 7 will make on a dummy reversal with 2 @C ruffs I believe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: send out a call for Michael Rosenberg and Bart Bramley -- what is BEST line for 12???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note: they analyze without peeking at the opponent's hands|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|daman: hrrrrmm|pg||

mb|p|nt|sater1957:  Cohler can win an IMP!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  S could have gone after @s for down one (not taking the @d finesse)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hearts v Spades - and Spades usually win|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Vugraphu6: Cohler drew first blood.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 1m 1s 1nt?|pg||
nt|athene: Martel-Stansby usually play weak NT don't they?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't have an up-to-the-minute card for them|pg||
nt|athene: must hunt one out|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  in a tight match as this one is, every imp carries extra weight.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: not nice to lose 200 on the first board|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|andyv:  puppet?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|santyclz: Interesting (as far as 1nt undbl'd can be interesting).  |pg||
nt|athene: some might open that south hand a 12-14 NT in first seat, but in third, there's a lot more reason to open your best suit, for lead-directing purposes|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hans can u tell us how N made 3 in OR|pg||
nt|sater1957:  looking at that now, don't get it yet|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: looks like puppet yes|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  lead helps a lot|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Puppet from discussion.|pg||
nt|andyv:  but E has nothing attractive to lead from|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well 1NT doubled in the other room  B31|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  might be a push... depends if declarer tries to make or not.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|santyclz: This was exactly what I had in mind by "interesting", but am surprised to see it single dmy.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|andyv:  8 tricks easy here... probably have to work on spade suit for the 9th although @C finesse is a last resort|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||

nt|jtr: Good afternoon people|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yo_yo: there was a small peter in @H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure what that means|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like my signals to be strong|pg||
nt|andyv:  CR, S went down 3 dbld in 1N...12 imps for Fleisher|pg||
nt|yo_yo: goodness |pg||
nt|andyv:  S tried both the @D finesse and the @S finesse without too much success|pg||
nt|andyv:  Michael can already see the writing on the wall|pg||
nt|othered1: The double on east's hand wouldn't have occurred to me, but sure hit paydirt.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcarroll: Hi david|pg||

mb|1H|nt|jtr: TY:)|pg||

nt|raghavan: we will get fireworks as deals come - Cohler has to make up|pg||
mb|3H|nt|santyclz: W thinks it's xmas.|pg||
nt|athene: well he doesn't expect to defence 1nt and kill it|pg||
nt|athene: he expects opps to run to spades|pg||
nt|athene: *to defend 1nt|pg||
nt|sater1957:  3NT not easy now, other table West opened 1@S|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: i think the problem with using double as two-way (4major 5minor OR any big hand)|pg||
nt|athene: is that on this auction |pg||
nt|athene: if you bid 3@D now over 2@D, does that show the strong hand|pg||
nt|athene: or might you just have, for example, extra shape (4@H 6@D)?|pg||
nt|jtr: 3NT and 5@c much the same here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sorry if you bid 3@D over 2@S i mean :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@d would be indeterminate so w may bid 3@s.|pg||
nt|sater1957:  and a @S lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu6: 2@s shows some values I believe|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 2nt clarified it for them if there were a problem.|pg||
nt|othered1: brb|pg||
nt|andyv:  as one kibitzer pointed out, Rosenberg made a good unblock of 10@c on last hand to prevent being end played |pg||
nt|jtr: Nice 3Nt bid|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|santyclz: Probably worth a x, but e shouldn't sit.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sater1957:  but no overtricks now, 2 more IMPS|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|raghavan: this will limit to 3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yo_yo: 2@S would promise a 6 card suit with me|pg||
nt|andyv:  need club shift from N to set this|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  or @D continuation and club shift to set it 2|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lol.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: each side has singleton trump queen in opps' fit|pg||
nt|athene: Culbertson would be nodding wisely|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Director call by Lew|pg||
nt|athene: not realising that his Theory Of Symmetry is complete candyfloss|pg||
nt|santyclz: It may have had some validity when decks were hand shuffled, but computer dealing has ended that chance.|pg||
nt|athene: director call interesting - hard to see where there could be any break in tempo and UI here?|pg||
nt|athene: the normal meaning would be that east paused over 3@S and influenced his partner to double|pg||
nt|athene: but east hasn't got anything :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: dbl of 1n misexplaines, was simply penalty|pg||
nt|athene: ah right|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d2|nt|athene: can you make this by setting up the @C8 for a heart pitch?|pg||
nt|athene: @DA, cross to @DJ, lead @CJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Beware of Stansby's bearing gifts.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcarroll: S has to rely on @D finesse |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: eventually pitch @H on the @C8 and then lead a heart to the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: might be findable, after the revealing auction|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hT|nt|raghavan: west to throw S|pg||
nt|sater1957:  but even then, 3 IMPS on two baords is less than the required run-rate. 2 IMPS per board to make up|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  now question of -1 or -2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not everyone seems to like my view there  but what's wrong with passing 1NT?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  3N also made in CR on board 2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|santyclz: Short an entry isn't it?  2 to take finesses (in @ds) but none to return to the 8.|pg||
nt|athene: he just plays for clubs 3-3 or @CQx|pg||
nt|athene: you only need to lead clubs once from dummy|pg||
pc|sT|nt|raghavan: Hans are u coming from a20/20 match|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|athene: diamond to dummy, lead @CJ, covered|pg||
nt|athene: then just bash out clubs|pg||
nt|sater1957:  no, I am not British :-)|pg||

nt|andyv:  as one spec points out, K@C before the @D ruff would have made it easier.  Question is whether W can possibly have the A@C (and not the J@C)|pg||
nt|jtr: Around Christmas time?|pg||
nt|sater1957:  East will probably balance|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Expert game try...|pg||
nt|athene: now west might take him seriously|pg||
nt|athene: except he knows @HKJx isn't so nice facing a singleton or void|pg||
nt|athene: but i would expect more than that for 4@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: But still, he has controls in both side suits.|pg||
nt|jtr: I think not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weichsel could bid 2@S as NAT, non-force -- but the 6214 dist too dangerous with such a weak hand|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|jtr: Ah thanks again Al  please stick around|pg||
nt|raghavan: David u proved right|pg||

nt|andyv:  nice pass by Rosenberg... so W got his wish as 3@h should be down 1|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|athene: surprising pitch there from east - surely you ruff with the @SJ and just hope?|pg||

nt|mariner1: same, add points and spades to get to 15 to open|pg||
nt|mariner1: so  a support REDBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Rob phrase better -- note to make, since Support DBL/RDBL originally invented for use in context of Strong Club system - some 2/1 players play support DBL but NOT support ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 83 Moss gained 10 back as the @S game was not found|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the idea is that in context of big club - opener never holds strong hand, but in 2/1 maybe big hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: S in a fix here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cohen not opening has really made things difficult for Pollack|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: players closing eyes resting, while she thinks|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: is DBL takeout??|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|an|weak nt w/ 4cd maj|nt|ahollan1: is 2N nat or scramble?|pg||

nt|Vugraphu6: Stasha's eyes opened wide with the 4 spades call|pg||

nt|yo_yo: hi Debbie, come to watch your man |pg||
nt|hedyg: here it is or :)|pg||
nt|debrose: N-S do play support doubles, but not support redoubles.  Though most who play one play both, it is not necessary to do so|pg||
nt|raghavan: David > I am on Rosen side - I have a website for which he helped in giving answers to questions from vistors - this was for more than 1yr|pg||
mb|3N|nt|santyclz: Depends on who my partner is.  I prefer 2@h, but some people don't take 3-card raises into their thinking.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, i am sure all roads lead to 4@H on these hands|pg||
nt|andyv:  the lack of a fit might keep N/S low|pg||
nt|jtr: Lovely guy And an ex-partner of mine in another life|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|debrose: Rosenberg also prefers support doubles, but not support redoubles |pg||

pc|sK|nt|hedyg: nice restraint by Fleisher|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: that's a new one on me, I thought they went together|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C is quite aggressive with bad trumps and @CKQx facing a singleton|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|athene: he likes his diamond fit, but that heart suit isn't what you want to play a 5-3 fit slam|pg||
nt|santyclz: A nice polite word for it.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|raghavan: easy now|pg||
nt|jtr: Surely it is the % play in the suit?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|santyclz: I would have gone for "strange".|pg||
nt|athene: plus on this bidding you are very likely to get a spade lead |pg||
nt|athene: so you aren't throwing a spade loser on diamonds or anything like that|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Open played @SA and then small|pg||
nt|jtr: North was maybe worried about Hx in dummy|pg||
pc|h6|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|debrose: Fleisher had already shown at least this strong a hand  - I'd say balanced 18-19 would be most typical for redouble - so was probably not tempted to bid over 2@S|pg||
nt|raghavan: For his opening bidn N must have CK- so no use finessing|pg||
nt|jtr: Ace and another gives an option to go down|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't get W in for Michael to Ruff with small trump|pg||
nt|andyv:  but N did that for him... exchange of tricks|pg||
nt|debrose: I was asked about Rosenberg's double - a bit agressive, but with 4-4 in the other two suits okay.  After the opps have bid two suits, double should guarantee at least 4-4 or a very ...|pg||
nt|debrose: strong (16+) hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: no reason to get trumps right|pg||
nt|athene: especially since leading small from dummy then ducking means you can't ruff a club|pg||
nt|santyclz: With the same shape a points I'd bid it, with something like kx kqxxx q10x axx.|pg||
nt|athene: 11 tricks in 4@H in the closed room|pg||
nt|athene: that's a whole lot of tricks|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if it was a trump lead|pg||
nt|athene: yeah|pg||
nt|athene: @HJ ends the defensive prospects right there|pg||
nt|santyclz: Must have been.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: people might lead small from @HAxx but not from @HAJx|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|jtr: Can decide to endplay North|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: so that just tells declarer everything|pg||
nt|athene: i think a club back put declarer under more pressure, didn't it?|pg||

nt|andyv:  on board 34, N/S stayed one level lower in 2@h and picked up another 5 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: Rosenberg has interesting choices in responding here - splinter, forcing raise, or 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  price isn't right for OC|pg||
nt|debrose: With that quality diamond suit, I would rule out 2@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: a bit strong for splinter?|pg||
nt|debrose: a bit wrong is more like it|pg||
nt|hedyg: how strong do they play splinters?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a splinter looks ideal to me|pg||
nt|debrose: not to strong, but singleton king is not ideal|pg||
nt|andyv:  as with stiff Aces, I don't like splintering with stiff Kings|pg||
nt|hedyg: agree|pg||
nt|hedyg: do they play jacoby raises?|pg||
nt|debrose: I believe they can show different ranges of splinters, so that is not the issue.  |pg||
nt|othered1: you mean with @Sx you'd splinter, but this is too strong?  I don't see it.|pg||
nt|jtr: Tough opening choice  Maybe pass?|pg||
nt|jtr: He did|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|debrose: He is choosing to show a "stronger" spade splinter|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|athene: North is likely to open a strong NT in the other room and east will keep quiet|pg||
nt|debrose: 3@S would have shown an unspecified "mini-splinter" - about 10-12 support points|pg||
nt|hedyg: this shows precisely @s splinter? or any?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|andyv:  should end auction|pg||
nt|debrose: This shows precisely a spade splinter with about 13-15 support points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if this table isn't enough for you   http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/    then one window for every table you want to follow|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: so this might help Martel in the play|pg||
nt|raghavan: should be in 4H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|hedyg: nice to be able to show either|pg||
nt|andyv:  cue bid of 4@d invites a 5@c cue bid?|pg||
nt|hedyg: they will be happy @hs dont split|pg||
nt|debrose: This is not ideal with a stiff King as we said.   Even if you are bidding the same way you would with a small singelton, partner may misevaluate|pg||
nt|othered1: good, normal stop.  On a very bad day even 4 is in danger|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: And the bidding for that matter, without interference, s might just invite after finding no @h fit.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|athene: very nice diamond layout for declarer but he won't want to rely on that|pg||

nt|jtr: Really????|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: doubtless would open with 5@ss instead of 5@hs|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah the opening could be weaker?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|santyclz: Would you risk a x of a stayman bid by s to avoid a @h lead?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: believe it or not|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sater1957:  yes, but did not follow play in total|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|jtr: I mean below 11?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well that's what notes said -- maybe Russ forgot what he authored :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: yes i wld double clubs for sure with west|pg||
nt|chorush: no, I want the opponents to know as little as possible about partner's hand here|pg||
nt|debrose: Fleisher and Kamil open 1@C rather than 1@D on all balanced minimums, so the 1@C can be a doubleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: there goes a @s loser|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: practically impossible to lead @s|pg||

pc|h4|nt|debrose: I'm sure Kamil would not have opened with five spades instead of five hearts, but perhaps that would matter to some|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: Martel just wants east on lead|pg||
nt|athene: because whatever he does will be helpful|pg||
nt|chorush: There has been no comparison for the board that Wildavsky and Doub went set in 4s. I wonder why not. 3NT can be beaten on that hand but takes very good defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: also would make extra trick if j10@D onside|pg||
nt|raghavan: Spade loser goes|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ultimate Canape based upon Big Club - so limited openings can be 10 with shape|pg||
nt|sater1957:  yep, the 3NT was 5 spade tricks, 4 to NS, and then The @CQ was run tio the @CK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: you can't beat 3nt can you?|pg||

nt|onebid: odd, but 4@S looks best|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead does 4@S in I think|pg||

nt|athene: someone find Roland and bring him in here and tie him down for the whole of this auction|pg||
nt|athene: he will wriggle, but we must be firm|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chorush: probably same auction on heart opening|pg||
nt|debrose: That might matter on a close call, in a match I thought I was a clear favorite in, since I wouldn't want to generate a random swing|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c|pg||
nt|othered1: How far do you go beyond what  you think is best in order to cater to opponents' styles?  My own thoughts are not very far against natural systems.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2nt scramble now|pg||
nt|debrose: But if the hand is clearly not an opening bid in my style, I can't just change it because of the other table, since my partners expectations won't change|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
nt|andyv:  unless you and your pd play 2 different cards depending on how match is going:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: S hand looks like 1 suiter to me|pg||
nt|andyv:  fortunate hand for S as either minor suit finesse works and W can't lead clubs more than once|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: also known as "partner, i haven't any suit i can bid, YOU play the silly 3-level contract!"|pg||
nt|chorush: I really have trouble imagining doubling here without 4 cards in each minor|pg||
nt|debrose: Fleisher has a nice hand facing a fit, but not so great otherwise.  Tough call now|pg||
nt|andyv:  with that luck, they should bid 6:)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chorush: I can see 3 diamonds in these modernisitic times, since you could have a game|pg||
nt|athene: actually there is a subtle difference between the two auctions|pg||
nt|athene: after 1@H - 2@H, NS showed slightly more values|pg||
nt|athene: so you might claim you don't need lebensohl|pg||
nt|athene: hence 2NT scramble in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: but here|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H might be zero|pg||
nt|athene: so perhaps you DO need Lebensohl|pg||
nt|athene: and hence you can't find the right fit|pg||
nt|chorush: that's true, so Roland will be doubly agitated if Flannery gets a good result|pg||
nt|athene: indeed he will :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: maybe you need a natural 2N?|pg||
nt|athene: yuck|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT shld never be natural :)|pg||
nt|athene: it's either leb or 2 places to play :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|santyclz: Natural 2nt has gone the way of the penalty x.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: opps dont have to have fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, he loves his hand|pg||
nt|debrose: 5@C seems like a lot to me - I would have just bid 4@C, which North would raise anyway this time|pg||
nt|andyv:  3 loser hand... had to be in game|pg||
nt|hedyg: i wonder would 4@c over 3@s be forcing?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|othered1: I'd count that as a 4-loser hand.  Adjusting at this level is iffy|pg||
nt|debrose: Looks like a four-loser hand to me, and could have been a complete misfit.  I think missing game bidding only 4@C is very unlikely|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@c is only for sissies:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  still need some luck to make 5 here|pg||
nt|debrose: I don't think 4@C would be forcing.  On this hand north would certainly raise - he has an Ace, Jx in clubs and a doubleton diamond when he could have had nothing useful |pg||
nt|hedyg: i think once you have reversed 4@c is fine, if pd can't raise to 5 we are in the right place|pg||
nt|raghavan: leads S?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chorush: I don't blame Wildavsky for this. Why should he think he has 2 places to play with his hand?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that Martel should have doubled 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: given the state of the match|pg||

nt|mcarroll: In that case it is almost 20-20 requirements|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chorush: dbling 3 clubs would be silly. State of the match is meaningless; 37 boards to go|pg||
nt|hedyg: duck?|pg||
nt|debrose: Note how game is  not cold even with North having all those useful cards|pg||
nt|debrose: I didn't mean game wouldn't make here - just that it's not cold on the N-S cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: if W ducks he needs to play K@d, not easy|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|chorush: Im guessing down 4 and 5 imps to Strul|pg||

nt|debrose: Nice play by Cohler.|pg||
nt|andyv:  np, Hedy...I love confirmations anyway:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT can make if he plays J@c|pg||
nt|debrose: Will you'd always prefer to duck smoothly when you are going to duck, it is often okay to think rather than win quickly|pg||
nt|andyv:  one spec mused that N/S were doing a good job not letting Michael Rosenberg play any hands:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|andyv:  prevent defense in bridge:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Cohler did not duck smoothly and Martin thinking about options.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok he played top @cs in OR, so 3NT will not make|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jtr: @hK then run J pitching something small|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|andyv:  reasonable line of play|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3 down in the OR|pg||
nt|debrose: Fleisher knows that Rosenberg is not a big count giver, so can't read anything into his diamond spot.  But gets it right anyway.  Well done!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: terrific play|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice play of K@D... now club lead not safe (as well as possibly trapping Qx of @D in E hand.|pg||

nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|debrose: He can however rely on Rosenberg to give count in spades - dummy's long suit|pg||
nt|debrose: So he has quite a bit to go on - the hearts are likely to be as they appear (W might have bid 3@H with six)|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to go wrong from here|pg||
nt|debrose: If clubs are 2-2 he knows he can't go down, so he has to assume someone has three|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Gary looks unhappy as to what he should play now.|pg||

pc|s7|pc|d5|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||

mb|2N|an|alerted|nt|yo_yo: so Fleisher bringing in 19 imps on the last 2 hands, well done|pg||

mb|3N|nt|chorush: the vulnerability is for children school would bid 3 spades but I agree with 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  looks like a safe contract|pg||
nt|debrose: Heavy 2@C bid by Cohler.  Could have been very bad if Rosenberg had similar weak hand with second suit being hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  good lead|pg||
nt|debrose: But alternative is to overbid with void in partner's suit also not attractive|pg||
nt|andyv:  awkward hand for W to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu6: Peter was really upset with his diamond lead.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same in Open so probably flat|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: It's not stylish, but you are allowed to have extras sometimes|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c is always stayman:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, his extra is void in partners suit|pg||
nt|debrose: absolutely - rebidding a minor at the 2 level, while showing a "minimum" is certainly wider range than a 1N rebid and responder should frequently invite game with close hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: small break in the action.|pg||
nt|debrose: I think his extra is AKQTxx, maximum high cards, and a second four card suit.  The void is iffy - alas, sometime we respond 1@S with xxxx |pg||
nt|hedyg: oh good! coffee anybody?|pg||
nt|andyv:  black for me, Hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok!|pg||
nt|andyv:  easy to see how to make this hand... much more difficult to play and the taps are going to be annoying.|pg||
nt|othered1: He does need only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|debrose: On this auction some play that a 2@H rebid by responder is non-forcing, and use 2@D as only force.  This is a reasonable way to play, but I know Rosenberg doesn't like it|pg||
nt|debrose: and I doubt has that agreement with Cohler|pg||
nt|hedyg: and can disc some @hs eventually|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|andyv:  in mp, probably right to lead @h to 10.... here, probably need to lead @h to K...if it wins, you can attack @ds..if it loses, defense will have to lead trump and declarer will gain a tempo|pg||

nt|Vugraphu6: decl back from men's room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=ART, FG, (a) 8+ HCP, BAL (b) opening+, 3 places to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Potential here - they stopped in 3NT in Open|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm i thought with 5521 response was something else :(|pg||
mb|2H|an|alerted|nt|andyv:  a more reasonable contract than 3N played in the CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: The 1@H overcall in the other room, combined with Mahaffey's decision not to show spades, led to a probably inferior contract|pg||
nt|othered1: In the open room south's decision to preempt in @C isn't ridiculous, just didnt work out well.|pg||
nt|jtr: maybe you missed the (c)?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=16-22, 6+@H & any shortness|pg||
mb|2S|an|alerted|nt|santyclz: He wasn't listening...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: not positive, but i believe 2@H RELAY, 2@S=short @C|pg||
nt|jtr: Will someone make a natural bid at some stage?|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: On some days 3N might make when 4@S goes down, and neither is great, but I think we'd rather be in 4@S|pg||
mb|2N|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|sater1957:  the final contrcat presumably|pg||
mb|3D|an|alerted|nt|athene: heart finesse, try to scramble a few tricks?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  @c to K and finesse in @S|pg||
nt|debrose: I agree Mahaffey's decision was reasonable - with such a weak hand he did not expect to have game|pg||
nt|andyv:  this might not work too well|pg||
nt|othered1: EW's failure to bid just because it was their turn isn't going to make the play of this any easier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: natural bids highly discouraged :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just like responses only IMPLY 13 cards|pg||
nt|jtr: Willie, it would be easier for you to alert natural bids for N/S:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: writing a lot to explain meanings here.|pg||
nt|sater1957:  with S in charge of the bidding I presume he will discover the spade fit and be able to ask for controls etc..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't have a handle on auctions after the singleton shown - involves a lot of "voting" re quality of hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Will he know North has 3@ss?|pg||
mb|3S|an|alerted|nt|andyv:  well, 9 tricks were available in 3N but a lot of good guessing needed to be done|pg||
nt|debrose: Well, actually once he sees the heart split, I think the fact that East didn't bid will be very helpful|pg||
nt|debrose: Certainly if he also sees the @DK he will be able to place all the other high cards|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, but since he's seen the @H split, it may be too late|pg||
nt|jtr: Presumably there is a shape ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: when he sees the @DK he may be down|pg||
nt|sater1957:  then they might shoot 7 assuming their opps will do it on the state of the match...|pg||
nt|gosia: which goes down on a trump lead - else guess diamond ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at time of 2@D - absolute 1-suiter and some shortness -- so already knows 2/3 @S 2/3@D|pg||
nt|jtr: I think that would be a contradcition for their methods|pg||
mb|4H|an|alerted|nt|andyv:  such an optimist, Ed:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sater1957:  7@S goes down on any lead I guess, but ik looks close|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hans ur prophecy of 3S came|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe  a delayed alert|pg||
nt|jtr: 7@s might come down to the @d finesse|pg||

mb|5S|nt|othered1: nice play discarding @D|pg||
nt|andyv:  trading tricks here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  still comes down to guessing the Q@C|pg||

mb|p|nt|sater1957:  team Cohler in dire straits now|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Peter and Russ are having a debate over the sequence and not happy.|pg||
nt|jtr: True  But the play here is interesting|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And naturally - unnaturally literally - the short@S hand gets to play it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even using screens -- this is type of auction that yields   lead-out-of-turn :(|pg||
nt|raghavan: Lead from E What?|pg||
nt|raghavan: probably S|pg||
nt|jtr: @s presumably|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: you are right. They were not sure who is on lead...now they do!|pg||
nt|sater1957:  there is a rule with screens and lead-out-of-turn when declaring side opens the screen(which it should not)|pg||
nt|gosia: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ah Ah|pg||
nt|sater1957:  in that case it has to be accepted|pg||
nt|sater1957:  At the EBL championships in Turkey I had a lead-out-of-turn, with screen open and decalring side openened it|pg||
nt|sater1957:  but in that case it turned out declarer first opened the screen, and then there was a klead out of turn|pg||

nt|chorush: Wildaavsky may make Stansby regret the 10 of hearts. It is possible he could get out for down 1|pg||
nt|santyclz: If s played the @h9 it would be automatic to duck the @h exit and finesse on the way back.|pg||

nt|sater1957:  run-rate now 7.5, panic time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great auction -- whatever it meant in then 2nd half|pg||
nt|gosia: we would have been watching Cayne here :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|andyv:  already ruffed with 10@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: on Q@S Michael played the J|pg||
nt|debrose: He's played a lot of boards against, and talked a lot of bridge with MR|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: you're going to hate explanation of 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10-15 HCP, 0+@D, (a) 12-14 BAL (b) any 4441 (c) any 5440 (d) 6+@D, 1-suit (e) 4+@D & 5+@S [@D&@S hand not 4th seat]|pg||
nt|jtr: Lev passed the North hand????|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: very nicely conceived by east|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, he played michael for 6 hearts, stiff spade and @d honor and not bidding?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he will be pleased to know he still won imps|pg||
nt|debrose: But what was the harm if playing the Spade Ace.  Perhaps we missed something in the play|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Fleisher was fooled on the spade Jack.|pg||
nt|andyv:  only if N wanted to be deceived.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Hardly typical|pg||
nt|jtr: He had just missed a slam|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jtr: Either stunned or cunning|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or operator error|pg||
nt|gosia: could be a typo :) even I open :)|pg||
nt|jtr: I back you Al|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|hedyg: support X this time|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|santyclz: Jerry Premo points out it's Lew and |pg||
nt|athene: not much fun for declarer, this one|pg||
nt|athene: he might duck a club and hope for 3-3 perhaps|pg||
nt|debrose: Thanks for confirmation Willie.  Does he realize it didn't matter - wasn't he down only one anyway if he cashed the spade and they didn't break?|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, gained 4 imps on board:)  Wish all my disasters were that unsuccessful!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|santyclz: Chipping.|pg||
nt|jtr: Good lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yo_yo: at last we see some action by MR|pg||
nt|hedyg: will be happy to find AK@C in N|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Michael finally getting to play a hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Winners of this match continue in bracket to become USA1 - tonite begins 90 board "round of 8"|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: losers get 2nd chance to become USA 2|pg||
nt|jtr: A long drawn-out affair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we won't see Nickell team until Semi-Final|pg||
nt|jtr: Are they hiding?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Welland plays for first time tonight in the Quarter-Final|pg||
nt|jtr: @h duck now probably|pg||
nt|gosia: or @d K ?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: QJ @c useful discards|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|debrose: Fleisher Kamil open all balanced hands not in the 1N range 1@C - their 1@D opening shows an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|debrose: For newer players - when you are watching, try to pay special attention to which hands experts draw trumps on and which they don't|pg||
nt|debrose: When you can see where your tricks are coming from, and have no reason not to draw trump, by all means do so|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: sometimes opps draw them for you :)|pg||
nt|debrose: Notice how often experts start with a side suit before drawing trump - there can be many reasons|pg||
nt|andyv:  they think that you forgot to draw them|pg||
nt|jtr: Both wrong:)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|athene: ducking the spade gave a tempo away|pg||
nt|athene: the defence don't get to cash their diamonds AND hearts now|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|debrose: Most basic are needing trumps for ruffs, needing trumps as entries, or just overall "timing"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: if you really want to understand the seeding and ko brackets -- i suggest not trying when sober|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|chorush: looks like d1 which will chip another imp away|pg||

nt|sater1957:  comes down to diamond guess at end|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yo_yo: well in England we talk about the man living on the Embankment because he forgot to draw trumps|pg||
nt|sater1957:  but given N opening...|pg||
nt|jtr: Down to the @d guess|pg||
pc|d7|nt|debrose: "Timing" would often mean setting up a trick(s) for a discard before letting the opponents get the lead to set up their trick(s)|pg||

nt|jtr: He will evnetually get this right|pg||
nt|jtr: eventually|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: I predict he will get it right.|pg||
nt|gosia: why ? Russ can have 11 |pg||
nt|sater1957:  if I understood the 1D opeing he must now have the A|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this stage of the competition, there are TEN (10) pairs playing some form of Big Club|pg||
nt|sater1957:  I understood that the balanced hands were 12-14|pg||
nt|jtr: He can of course, but the odds favour the K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably not 11 because known balanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Hans got there first|pg||
nt|sater1957:  I had to scroll back to the explanation :-) So will declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and if anyone can put all pieces together -- my money on Michael Rosenberg|pg||
nt|raghavan: probably counting N points|pg||
nt|jtr: 4-4 in the majors maybe he would open with 11|pg||
nt|jtr: They were counted 5 minutes ago:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|debrose: On defense, when declarer is not drawing trump it is often best to lead them yourself, as is being demonstrated|pg||

nt|gosia: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: 3 Bds to go - dif is 25|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: Russ may have given a subtle clue during some explanations.|pg||
nt|sater1957:  Cohler could gain 6 here by making 3@S|pg||
nt|jtr: Nothing to do here|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: So on a higher level declarer might not draw trump as a sort of bluff, because he prefers for the defense to play them |pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: But that is certainly not what I would can a common reason for not drawing them|pg||
nt|debrose: 2@D shows diamonds and a major, but is not part of "DONT"|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: always 5+ @ds?|pg||
nt|debrose: 2@C would show majors, double would be "penalty" and majors natural|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: 1nt surely preferable with east?|pg||
nt|debrose: I doubt they have the agreement it is always 5+ diamonds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl should ask pd to continue |pg||
nt|hedyg: so could be 4 4|pg||
nt|debrose: They are not a regular partnership, but if they have discussed it I'd imagine nine cards either way is possible|pg||
mb|2S|an|alerted|nt|athene: it describes the hand overall much better|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: I agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: is this 14-16 NT?|pg||
nt|debrose: 4-4 is usually not expected, but with (1-4)4-4 and a good hand would certainly be possible.  Bidding with a balanced hand over 1N would be very unusual|pg||
nt|debrose: 15-17 NT - good 14?|pg||
nt|hedyg: could be|pg||
nt|andyv:  4-4 hands better resereved for mp play|pg||
nt|hedyg: all primes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S weaker raise than 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: Yes, non vul at matchpoints I would consider it possible to bid with 4-4 and a balanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: this looks like 5@s 4@d to me|pg||
nt|raghavan: push|pg||
nt|gosia: Ozdil just beat Jacobs - + 30 ish with one board to go|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many pairs playing at least that transfer after 1Major-DBL|pg||
nt|jtr: Or gain 5 by beating this?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  looks like a poor bid to me|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Vugraphu6: lucky to miss 3N?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|debrose: I don't understand the 3@S bid|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|othered1: but east didn't seem to take him for four of them|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: two in a row for MR...and away we go!!|pg||
nt|andyv:  and looks like -3 imps|pg||
nt|jtr: must go passive in defence|pg||
nt|jtr: Second @s and @c exit|pg||
nt|sater1957:  other table West led @H 10 at some stage, so decl could play @H for one loser|pg||
nt|jtr: He knows there is no rush for that|pg||
nt|jtr: and the 98 in dummy should deter him|pg||
nt|raghavan: may have to give 2S+2H_1D =|pg||
nt|sater1957:  other table S was declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: key question -- after the weak raise, what would Rosenberg lead from @SJxx vs @SQxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  can Gary underlead @S at this point|pg||
nt|jtr: Does he need to?|pg||
nt|raghavan: W should continue S and S|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: you might make 3nt :) but would have to be on form!|pg||
nt|chorush: diamonds is a "frozen" suit. Neither side canlead it first without forfeiting a trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  not a great hand to lead from|pg||
nt|ahollan1: need?  probably not -- but sure easy to avoid endplays if partner can play @D at trick 3|pg||
nt|jtr: As long as he doesnt eliminate the @ss for declarer|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|hedyg: he just might make this|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if he can make it with that lead.  North doesn't get on lead very quickly|pg||
nt|andyv:  club lead might have been safer|pg||
nt|andyv:  now hard to stop 3N|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice 8@d, great unblock|pg||
nt|debrose: this certainly seems to have play.  South can't get North in, but declarer has his own problems getting off dummy I suppose |pg||
nt|debrose: Note the unblock - just good technique of the @D8|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, again a thoughtful play|pg||
nt|debrose: excuse me - be back in a few minutes|pg||
nt|othered1: with south opening 1N, hard to see how 8 could ever be wrong, but careful play nontheless|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he plays a @d to hand now S will surely play @c|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @d seems likely yes|pg||
nt|othered1: if he clears @C from dummy, south can drive @S entry. and as cards figure to lie, south can't unblock @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he unblocks AK@C S knows that the only card his pd can have is Q@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Ed|pg||
nt|jtr: Hoping for some info|pg||
nt|jtr: Or for declarer to clarify the @s position|pg||
pc|hA|nt|debrose: Will South know when the @HJ is?  Another note for newer players - It is usually best as declarer to win with the higher of equals|pg||
nt|othered1: but then south will give west the last trick with @D.  So this might have been cold, had east cleared @C.  |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|debrose: sorry, *where* the @HJ is|pg||
nt|othered1: now the timing is wrong for declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: if south reads the hand correctly with @C play|pg||
nt|debrose: The fact that North discarding a heart should help South.  Perhaps he should have discarded the Ten even.  Is there any heart layout where that could cost?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|othered1: Onthe other hand, will south play east to have made a non-double dummy play?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|hedyg: so you clear AK@C, play a @H to ace @cs and @d|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HA??|pg||
nt|sater1957:  well that is an easy down|pg||
pc|sA|nt|santyclz: Unfortunately for n, that seems to have been the case for all suits.  |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jtr: 2 game swings required|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hedyg: lose 2@ds, 1@h and 1@s|pg||
nt|sater1957:  fireworks on next hand, some chances for Cohler coming|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  quandry for S|pg||
nt|othered1: We see that play and its very likely east, a thourough analyst considered it.|pg||
nt|debrose: Rosenberg is playing opener for the Ace Queen of spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why 10@h would have been most helpful|pg||
nt|hedyg: no doesnt work...S takes and plays a @d to dummy..|pg||
nt|othered1: And that gives north exactly nothing for his free @H bid|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then opps make 2@ss no matter where they are|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult hand for all sides|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hedyg: very|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|c3|nt|othered1: well defended|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|debrose: As was said, we do know a thorough analyst considered it - And knowing him, in retrospect he will be very unhappy with himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: because then after ducking 1@d S could play A@s and @s and kill dummy?|pg||
mc|8|nt|andyv:  yes|pg||

mb|6H|nt|gosia: what is 5nt i wonder as will rosenberg :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Guess Rosenberg will double this|pg||
nt|jtr: Whatever he thinks it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm terrible with these tactical situations -- does slow approach encourage NS save or more often find good grand?|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks David -- that's what i thought|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, you earned it by being so helpful|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: If EW were allowed in 6S- 14 IMP narrowing - |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Kind, yes, but Fleisher hasn't just sat there with a basket open.  They've earned quite a bit of it.|pg||
mb|7S|nt|debrose: 3N shows 15+-17|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: MR is trying again.|pg||
nt|jtr: He is not thinking of passing:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: I doubt that. Even opposite 12-14 his hand is worth 3H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they dont promise reverse strenght for that 2@S bid I see|pg||
nt|andyv:  no question about that...Fleisher team has played very well|pg||
nt|debrose: This should be fairly standard playing 2/1 GF, but I find most club players don't have that agreement, and bid 3N "to play"|pg||
nt|andyv:  in 2/1 auction, probably not|pg||
nt|debrose: 2N should be minimum or 18-19 (planning to bid 4N next time usually)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this one shouldnt take long when the clubs behave|pg||
nt|debrose: Look for the safety play for four club tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: how will he play the @cs?|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|sater1957:  oh dear|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: well he needs 4 @C tricks|pg||
nt|debrose: It is possible to cater to either opponent having QTxx.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: hhmm|pg||
nt|sater1957:  Well, that's it for this match then|pg||
nt|jtr: I am sure Michael should have doubled|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: Gary [Cohler] not having much luck with his jumps to any form of slam|pg||
nt|jtr: Unless he thought it was a step thing|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|othered1: with lead driving an entry to east there may be entry problems with @C safety play on other lies fo the cards|pg||
nt|jtr: But then double is usually the weakest step|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: the strong club 1@D opener buried the NS club fit - but that also kept E-W out of the auction effectively|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in last 3 days, i've seen  5  8-card suits|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|othered1: that's an interesting play|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 of them were same hand!!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|othered1: east will feel more comfortable about @C now|pg||
nt|jtr: Al, they stopped counting honours in 1956|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just doesn't seem fair |pg||
pc|cK|nt|chorush: this looks like a large gain for robinson|pg||
nt|andyv:  Gary must dream of 5-0 breaks all the time:)|pg||
nt|debrose: As some specs have pointed out, the normal safety play would involve cahsing the Ace first, but there are some potential entry problems here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jtr: I know  Maybe they will change it back|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|chorush: will make up for a lot of that chipping|pg||
nt|debrose: This play loses only to stiff Queen in the North hand|pg||

nt|Vugraphu6: sorry, she's still thinking|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: very reasonalbe choice of 2N, don't you think?|pg||
nt|onebid: good choice by Rosie|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just giving you grief Chuck -- for comic relief|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: saving the t for an entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rob will say it officially soon, but WELL DONE CHUCK|pg||
nt|onebid: and she had 4 of them|pg||
pc|h6|nt|onebid: 10s|pg||

nt|jtr: Played it half my life|pg||
mb|1H|nt|raghavan: what a pity - I was counting 14 for my friend Rosen counting|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S from west and 4NT from north?|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c by W appears to be good sac against 4@s|pg||
mb|3N|an|alerted|nt|athene: then south has a great hand|pg||
nt|chorush: this hand could be very swingy|pg||
nt|santyclz: We still don't have a result from the closed room on 19 so things are tentative.|pg||
nt|athene: he might try 5NT over 4NT :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Roland won't like to hear this -- but there are a number of pairs in the event that would open the West hand ..... 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  question is how to get there|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: reasonably enough, south gives his partner a lot of leeway|pg||
nt|athene: knowing he is short in spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  aggressive over call didn't do it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcarroll: too little too late - Nplaying 2@D in open|pg||
nt|jtr: That's all folks Thanks for your company|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|chorush: this may be in some difficulty on spade tap|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm told in the closed room on bd 19 they also got to 4@s instead of 3nt but made 5.|pg||
nt|othered1: and directed the winning lead . . . |pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: (winning relative to the overtrick)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|santyclz: A low @h (intending a dmy reversal) would be revealing.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jtr: Thanks also to our valiant operator, Willie i believe, for all his hard work and input|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  choice of leads is interesting... I wonder what E's thought process was on that one.|pg||
nt|debrose: I too am surprised by no 5@C bid from Rosenberg.  I'll report back tomorrow on his reasoning:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol ty!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: looks like 5 here|pg||
nt|debrose: My guess is he didn't see the 3@C bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  another imp for Fleisher who close out this set in an impressive fashion.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|santyclz: Well, things got even more confusing.  They've entered the score for bd 19, but in the wrong direction.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N= good 12-14, 0/1 @S|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|chorush: there was a greedy double of 5D in the other room. After a double declarer might find his way home|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jtr: Our appreciaiton to the USBF for allowing us to presnt this event|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|chorush: I think we have the play incorrect here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S covers ALL 9-(bad)12 splinters|pg||
nt|jtr: and finally to my fellow commentators for donating their time and expertise|pg||
nt|raghavan: I endorse what all David said|pg||
nt|jtr: Tertiary-finals in one hour and a bit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thx also to specs for great input/laughs and keeping us honest|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: thanks for the compliments. Almost finished here. Bye to all. |pg||
nt|raghavan: Tx to willee, co commentators, Kibits,Roland and BBO and its staff|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: perhaps east ruffed @HK and forced with spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: he played @Hk then claimed when doug showed out|pg||
nt|chorush: we don't know for sure but they have board 8 scored as 8 imps to Robinson when we think it is 13 imps to struhl. So Robinson's lead might be 21|pg||
nt|Vugraphu6: not going to be corrected but obviously wrong score|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|s3|pc|c4|pg||
mc|10|nt|debrose: That does sometimes happen with screens - to some players more than others to be sure - and to many players it probably never happens|pg||
nt|hedyg: interesting @c lead with no @c bid in OR|pg||
nt|debrose: however I know from experience it could happen to Rosenberg|pg||
nt|jtr: Ironically, this hand would have won it for Cohler had he been left to play in 6@s|pg||
nt|sater1957:  the 6S would have tied the match|pg||
nt|raghavan: Previous bd- if stopped in 6S- now Cohler would be equal 127 Pity |pg||
nt|ahollan1: well   Russ Ekeblad still had chance to save with 7@H|pg||
nt|raghavan: Byeeee to one and all - Here at Chennai India it is 12.12 AM - going to sleep GN |pg||
