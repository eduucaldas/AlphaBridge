nt|bobh1: too bad for yang and shi--they are on their way to avoiding 3n|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but 5 of a minor looked too far away but perhaps not|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobh1: instead of gaining a game swing from this judgment it is just another push|pg||
nt|roswolf: can they make 5@D?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: believe he wrote that 4@s showed 4-4 in the minors, after 3@d, not 100% sure|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think 5@d ok|pg||
nt|othered1: but why should they pick @D over @C?  and might they try 4N, failing?|pg||

mc|11|nt|Vugraphu3: My sources clarify that Gu-Weinstein are indeed playing Strul-Becker, thanks for the info :)|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|1N|nt|roswolf: this should be competitive|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: 3c and 3@d were alerted, 3@d something about denying @h or a major or something, couldn't read the writting|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: very tough to accurately criticize auction, other than by result, without detailed system notes that just aren't available for most pair.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bobh1: apparently thay play a variation of puppet so that 3d did not deny 4 spades only 4+ hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|bobh1: so he could have been 4-by-3 with no 4-card minor|pg||
