pc|hK|pg||
nt|sharynr: perhaps 2 rounds of @S to see it 10 drops...before playing a @C|pg||
nt|plateos: @h now gives declarer (atleast DD) chance by unblocking the 1H and then @d|pg||
nt|sharynr: Of course, easy to see that 2@C cashed followed by a @S exit will lock declarer in dummy|pg||

nt|pale hose: East|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|plateos: X with shortness in undid M is always a risk but he has the extra strength a plan to rebid NT (simply too much for direct 1NT)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharynr: how about if he had AKxxxx of @S, would he not just bid 4@S?|pg||
