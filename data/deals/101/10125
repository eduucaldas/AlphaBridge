mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Your commentators are Bill Frisby, England, and Jon Sveindal, Norway. I am Roland Wald from Denmark|pg||
nt|athene: good evening everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: hi all|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: declarer only has six tricks on a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: he might sneak a spade through though|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Willie here again, hi all.|pg||
nt|athene: hi there |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but 2@S in the 5-3 fit wouldn't be a triumph|pg||
nt|athene: with the bad break, heart ruff and lead coming through the @CKx|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: of course declarer has a problem with entries to hand|pg||
nt|athene: so he really has to try to slip past north's @SA|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: unblock @DAJ, lead spade|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|athene: but that really telegraphs his whole hand|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||

pc|h8|nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi Danny|pg||
nt|athene: south can either try to cash clubs, or put his partner in for a lead through the presumed @CKx|pg||

nt|jbgood: so S was unsure about the first club from prd - perhaps the 8 could be from a doubleton also|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s5|pc|h3|nt|athene: yes, normally you would expect a count signal there|pg||
nt|athene: even if you normally play attitude, you give count when you can't beat dummy's small card|pg||

nt|jbgood: slam time|pg||
nt|athene: it's just very very hard to get right without lots of carding|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: grand even|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|3for3: or not|pg||
nt|3for3: if i can count the EW trumps...|pg||
nt|athene: some people open 1@S with minimum 5@S-6@H to avoid reversing, but they are evil and debased individuals :)|pg||
nt|3for3: this is no minimum, too|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: you call me evil Bill?|pg||
mb|2S|an|alerted|nt|3for3: maybe with Kxxxx, AQxxxx, x,x I might be tempted|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: only if you are opening 1@S on that south hand :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: ok - apology accepted:)|pg||
nt|athene: of course 1@H - 2minor; 2@S when the 2minor was GF opens up a new can of worms|pg||
nt|athene: some play it shows extras, some don't|pg||
nt|3for3: i am shape first guy|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: me too - even though my shape tends to detoriorate|pg||
nt|athene: i think that's the norm...you still have lots of room over 2@S so it pays to make the normal shape bid|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|3for3: 3nt balanced with extras probably|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT from north would have worked better but there might be inferences here we don't know about|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|3for3: many americans play 2n is 12-14 or 18+....|pg||
nt|jbgood: shouldnt it really be Without Extras?|pg||
nt|3for3: The jump is the middle range|pg||
nt|3for3: a matter of style, I guess|pg||
nt|jbgood: thanks for enlightning me!|pg||
nt|3for3: fast arrival jumps are less popular than they once were|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i thought 2-way 2NT was normal, but usually from opener|pg||
nt|3for3: I guess slam in hearts will fail.  |pg||
nt|athene: i think fast arrival is often overdone - it shld ONLY apply when there is no doubt as to what denomination you are playing|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise you end up jumping and using up all the room you need, just to show a minimum|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: Rogoff is thinking real hard on his bid.|pg||
nt|athene: he might bid 5nt now perhaps|pg||
nt|3for3: he has primes, but if partner is 65, his diamond king is garbage|pg||
nt|athene: he has the minors covered|pg||
nt|jbgood: as you see 6 spades is on by ruffing a heart, whereas 6 hearts is likely to go down|pg||
nt|3for3: right|pg||
nt|athene: he might be thinking they want to play slam in partner's stronger suit|pg||
mb|4N|nt|3for3: normal to choose the 62 over the 53|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: and it is stronger too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: and he might be thinking "partner would open 1@S with a dead minimum 5-6, so he has a decent hand!"|pg||
nt|3for3: only if he is 'debased'|pg||
nt|3for3: or whatever word you used|pg||
nt|athene: this looks a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure north didn't intend 4NT as natural|pg||
nt|3for3: Perhaps 6@H can be made on a trump coup|pg||
nt|athene: i am told it's 6@S in the other room|pg||
pc|dT|nt|3for3: spies say 6@S in other room|pg||
nt|athene: which will make on the simple @SAK, hearts line|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: it has been played for quite a while on this side of the pond too|pg||
nt|3for3: I much prefer 1nt-3nt|pg||
nt|3for3: No description of declarers hand|pg||
nt|3for3: no chance to double 2@C|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|3for3: Or stick in 2 of a suit...|pg||
nt|athene: north might avoid a spade lead for fear of course spades in dummy|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: *fear of FOUR spades in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will try the @S10 i guess and south won't have to pass the "finesse against dummy" test|pg||
nt|3for3: not at this level...not a test|pg||
nt|jbgood: I agree Danny, but exploring may get you to 4 @s if W's majors were switched|pg||
nt|3for3: true|pg||
nt|athene: well on rule of 11 you know declarer has one more spade higher than the @S5|pg||
nt|athene: if it's the @S9, don't you look silly putting the @S8 in?|pg||
nt|3for3: 8 could be wrong if partner has spade ace...|pg||
nt|jbgood: declarer is likely to try the ten . is he not?|pg||
nt|athene: or the @SJ|pg||
nt|jbgood: the only legitimate shot at 3 spade tricks|pg||

nt|athene: this is going very well for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: two triumphs in the first two tricks|pg||
nt|jbgood: so he really went for a misdefense rather than the odds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meltzer did not concede against Welland. However, we chose not to show that match because it is so one-sided that it seemed more interesting to show a USA2 match.|pg||
nt|athene: i think he did |pg||
pc|d3|pc|c2|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I hope Robinson will be dealt a 5008 hand. He always opens a 5-card major before a longer minor|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|3for3: we live for those moments|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps it depends how good the 8-card suit is? :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s3|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: I asked him several times|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|3for3: the upside for him is that when he doesn't open a major, he doesnt have 5, ever.  So the rebid of that major can be used as a convenient stall in complex auctions|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|h4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Jxxxx void void AKQJ10987  and he opens 1@C he said|pg||

nt|athene: declarer could safely play a heart there and duck it to north? more chance of safe overtrick|pg||
nt|3for3: we teach our students majors first (though) not to that extreme on our cruises, and wouldnt you know it, one of them had 56 in the blacks with solid clubs...opened 1@S, then ...|pg||

mb|1N|an|alerted|nt|athene: i assume that's what 1NT is?|pg||
nt|3for3: yes, the crash convention comes out|pg||
nt|athene: east can bid pass/correct 5@C now|pg||
nt|3for3: a perfect hand for this method|pg||
nt|athene: east opened 3@C in the other room and is now playing 7@C|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: which NS have doubled|pg||
nt|athene: reasonably enough|pg||
nt|3for3: that is presumably par on this board|pg||
mb|4C|an|alerted|nt|athene: well, double-dummy par must be a grand slam to NS?|pg||
nt|3for3: true...|pg||
nt|3for3: I meant 'normal' par|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C is a little bit wet i think - no way are you buying it at the 4-level|pg||
nt|jbgood: agreed|pg||
nt|3for3: he is hoping for 4 of a major, all pass.|pg||
nt|3for3: I bet|pg||
nt|athene: you know that south has to have length in whichever major your partner doesn't have|pg||
nt|3for3: He also knows they have a slam somewhere, in all likelihood|pg||
mb|4D|nt|3for3: and would love to concede 680|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i have to say, unless 3NT was showing a very specific hand, it's an admission of defeat to jump like that and take away all your own bidding space|pg||
nt|3for3: pass would have been forcing, so presumably the direct bid shows more shape|pg||
nt|3for3: I agree, hard to imagine 3nt is best there.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|3for3: this might get them to 7....|pg||
nt|athene: north was worried 4major wld not be taken as control-bid for diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: but it has to be|pg||
nt|athene: with a long major he was bidding it earlier|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: so i think 4@S was a better bid over 4@D if you want to cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: all that and we will have a 0 or 1 imp swing|pg||
nt|3for3: oh wait...|pg||
nt|3for3: there is the small matter of the 5-0 diamond break...|pg||
nt|athene: Hawaiian trump break to deal with :)|pg||
nt|athene: plus the lurking @SK|pg||
nt|3for3: that is whay i get for looking at  the NS cards only|pg||
