nt|Walddk3: Chuck will get player names up as soon as he gets a minute|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think the Moss squad will be sitting on their hands waiting for breaks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chuck will enter names when he gets a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west is Sylvie Moss, North Sasha Cohen, East Migry Campanile, South Rozanne Pollack|pg||
nt|mariner1: slam chance here NS|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: can make 7 finding Q@D|pg||

pc|c2|nt|mariner1: 7@H 7@S or 7@D all can make (all on Q@D hunt)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: real key from Sasha's point of view is the @D suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: Key Card now|pg||
nt|daman: Moss team in 6@S on Board 81 in CR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C from Pollack as Exclusion would be great treatment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sasha can't ask -- needs to know way too much that KC won't tell her|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mariner1: we have Closed Room up now|pg||

pc|hT|nt|daman: redouble or 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: superfluous dbl -- gives NS more room to sort things out|pg||

nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C already said -- no @C loser -- Pollack worried about a) trump  b) missing grand|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Both play 2/1 with a strong NT|pg||
nt|athene: he can take a ruffing finesse in clubs after winning this and returning the suit|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: That is if you want to call Brad's notrump openers strong :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||

nt|athene: his partner won't get excited no matter how much he jumps up and down, tho :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|an|forcing|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: win the heart lead and bash out @SAKJ?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: you might be slightly worried about losing four hearts and @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: he might think he needs to take nine tricks without losing the lead|pg||
nt|athene: so might cross to @DQ and run @CJ|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: but if you're doing that you should cash the @sAK first because that's a second chance|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Correct|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and everything will work nicely here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: heart lead to @H10 and @HK in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: then @SAK|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: except you might not take a club hook later once you have 10 tricks|pg||
