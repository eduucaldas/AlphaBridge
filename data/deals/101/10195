nt|bridge_one: Hi Christian ! good work :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Aggressive preempt by N|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT by East?|pg||
nt|ady: not l ikely to reach game|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@C here showing limit raise or better @c|pg||
nt|ady: hi giorgio|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 2Nt preempt. in a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: i think so|pg||
nt|ady: hardly a pre-mptive hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: quite a pre-empt too|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT by S will be the contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and in 3NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i go to search the CC|pg||

nt|chick: Hi Christian, Vlad :)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Cornelia|pg||
nt|chick: Looks like NS are playing some form of strong club, precision?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzqt: Team Rehder 1st Neuhauser 2nd|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Normally E/W would find their way to 4H, which is a more comfortable contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: S will play in a @H partscorelosing 4 tricks,but EW have 4@S if thea could reach this contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi all! Welcome to the German Teams Championship 2009, Kassel, Germany -|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge-verband.de/web/news/654   -  Tournament site|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree David looks like an opener to me|pg||
mb|3D|nt|april7: support X|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Christian Kaeppel|pg||
nt|april7: S could bid 3@H |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But the preempt put them under pressure and West understandably passed 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Constantin Stancesu from Switzerland|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North should duck the first club to retain communication with South|pg||
nt|Walddk7: and hello Nigel|pg||
nt|stc: hi|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi Roland and Constantin|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: wait these are wrong hands in line|pg||
nt|rnmalik: the only way to stop EW from 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hello Rashid and Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello everyone|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Roland busy as ever|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi Rashed|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: welcome back sorry for delay 1st cant be played in vugraph so contract is 4! bye East|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 4@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that looks more like it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Kath |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont have their ccs but presumably that's spades and another suit?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do you know rashed?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: i give u the result when played .....we had serverproblems|pg||
nt|yo_yo: christian what is their system ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The partnerships which play 3 way @C-would open this hand as 2@D both majors less than opening hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that unusual do you think Rashed to have 1h as the 2nd suit? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: actual E/W 4 tricks N/S 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i play (sometimes) @H and a minor|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or @S and a minor|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no but if they are playing 2@S-@S and another suit-possible-with 2NT by responder for a feature|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: north using support dbl to show 3 cards in hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: Our commentators for this session are Linda Lee (Canada), David Greenwood|pg||
nt|mariner1: (Ireland),  and Roland Wald (Denmark) ........... I am Rob Brown (USA)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Christian Kaeppel (Germany),  is our superb operator, Hi Christian !|pg||
nt|mariner1: dbl from E unusual, maybe NS play a 2 range 1@C|pg||
nt|stc: Hi|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Eamon Galligan|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hi Eamon|pg||
nt|eamongall: morning by minute ..(irish time) |pg||
nt|eamongall: hi Carl|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Avram|pg||
nt|xenya: an uphill task for Ludewig -- to win back 49 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|ady: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS gave up easy here I think|pg||
nt|ady: could not 3@D by north have been natural    as yet east's suit not disclosed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D and after 3@S to do a  2suit hand|pg||
nt|april7: I expectet N to bid 1 @S, but he decided  to bid 2NT|pg||
nt|stc: 9 tricks because unexpected 2 in @c|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@H/4@S good hand|pg||
nt|xenya: a straightforward 4@H for starters|pg||
nt|xenya: good defence will beat it, but will it be good enough?|pg||
nt|xenya: EW don't know much about N's distribution|pg||
nt|chick: the most helpful lead possible for declarer|pg||
mb|4D|nt|yo_yo: yes he cant go wrong in the @S suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: east might have contested with 3@S   after west has bid twice |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10+cards in the suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: so NS find their fit at the 4 level|pg||
nt|ady: one too high|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the alternative at 4@C was 3Nt by South|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: slow start in an exciting semifinal starting with 12 hands today|pg||
nt|chick: a spec says it's Polish club|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: well - by now you're on our schedule Eamon - afternoon :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks as if Live Updates is back - go to http://nmlag.com/LIVE-oppdatering and continue from there. Worked for me!|pg||
nt|april7: S has 3 Kings and N a 6card @H suit most probably.It doesn't need much to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi David :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: good play by W not taking the ace|pg||
nt|april7: @S lead and N must ruff a @S in handand then play ace of @H and @H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i am searching the CC- nothing for zimmermann ..|pg||
nt|ady: North  might feel game missed here    will be please when A@s turns up with east|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: they playing strong club system|pg||
nt|bridge_one: TY Christian|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Difficult hand to work out the best line|pg||
mb|4N|nt|eamongall: is it 2pm in Norway ? |pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|stc: overtrick now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he can finesse the 10 or lead low to Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|bridge_one: similar precision, like Entcho ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: nobody plays like entcho lol ....|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is sure !|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: its polish club |pg||
mb|5S|nt|Walddk6: 1|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 PM|pg||
nt|april7: 3@D was a good intermidiTE BID TO KEEP ew AWAY|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A second club and third spade makes nine|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Second diamond also possible|pg||
nt|april7: second @C is not for sure,where is the ace????|pg||
nt|ady: should get a 2nd trick in diamonds  on the lay|pg||
nt|stc: can't go wrong|pg||
nt|april7: lead is most helpful for 11th trick|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Appears hopeless on the actual lie|pg||
nt|xenya: on a closer look, there seems to be little scope for a defensive error however -- as a spectator has pointed out|pg||
mb|6N|nt|mariner1: interesting that S did not compete here|pg||
nt|xenya: EW's pips in the minors are too good  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Think we're always 1 hour ahead of you|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: N might go down,if W cashes his ace of @C and underleads @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: the good news is S only has one @H higher than the 10 and 9|pg||
nt|ady: 2nd club available  unless a false card from west|pg||
nt|yo_yo: which do you think is best ?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Now he will try to ruff a club - in case they are 4-2 and the short hand has no more trumps|pg||
pc|sA|nt|nigel_k:  Yes, JC marks 10 with East|pg||
mc|12|nt|bridge_one: do u know, C, if they play 5 cards Majors ?|pg||

nt|duschek: So it's advantage Chile before the last 16 boards, but no decisive lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Arguably two of the best pairs in South America at this table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agree John, Beto?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: this bord is different ...................you can not see |pg||
nt|rayhaa: a partscore fight|pg||

nt|vugraphb1: wlc all|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: wlc back all|pg||
mb|2H|nt|granguru: PAcareu Robles are the best junior one most probably|pg||
nt|Rafa: Official score is 78,5 Argentina 102 Chile|pg||
nt|levix: E-W can make 3nt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Silvia and Michael:)|pg||

nt|levix: hi rodal|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: welcome to FINAL|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|beto: agree roland|pg||
nt|duschek: 4@H seems to make here, but unclear whether it's biddable with 11 opposite 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Ventin is from Spain originally I believe|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: welcome all|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: If specs like to send some info pleeeece do it:) |pg||
mb|4D|nt|beto: so if ties Chile wins|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Can be a bad start. Minus 3?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk1: You are invisible. Is that intentional?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|nt|beto: Ventin is from spain|pg||
mb|p|nt|beto: but is playing for argentina|pg||
mb|7N|nt|granguru: I have no info regarding Ventin..as Lambardi used to play with Lucena for many many years|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|beto: i think he has a residence in there|pg||
nt|duschek: Apparently it was - Robles drove it all the way to game once he heard partner had an opening bid with 5-4 in the majors|pg||

nt|sybarra: "only" 50 |pg||
nt|rnmalik: key play was the @C to make 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: to the German National Team Bamberger Reiter|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has some play here......|pg||
nt|mariner1: so NS might lose 1 or more there|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have some play for 4@S here|pg||
nt|hlortz: a @S preempt may buy this|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the Dbl at 3@H by west was difficult to interpretate - E thought could play or 4@H or 5@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 3@H DBL in Open Room|pg||
nt|bridge_one: thinking ad double fit|pg||
nt|stc: easy part score in @s|pg||
nt|stc: Action now ? 4@h, 5@d ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: logical end:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: no live again|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: now|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: no extert in here ?? to discuss?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how many teams started out Christian?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 35 teams ......started|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how many women in those?|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not sure declarer's line was best -- seems natural to play on @CS early -- but of course nothing would have worked here|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: big trouble here ....elinescu was searching his handbag with money so game was 8 min delay|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: hurrray :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: EW plays strong clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: two key cards are the stiff J@H and the 8@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: the trick is getting the @c pitch before losing the @D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|april7: 6@D by EW|pg||
nt|ady: 6 of either minor for e/w|pg||
nt|santyclz: I liked 2@h by s.  Takeout x of @ss.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well NS has to bid to be able to play|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D is either multi or just a weak major|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes a lower @S contract is likely I think|pg||
nt|hlortz: zo ew play a WEAK nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: so EW play a very low NT at least NV|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D could be also short - they play similar precision (i suppose)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: Elinescu was shocked and asked me whether I put the names in BBO lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks:):)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: my Daughter 13 + 5-8 ladies ......I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: did he find it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: great episode in fist Hand lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: good|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sharkey: may duplicate CR here|pg||
nt|jbgood: not now|pg||
nt|eamongall: not any more .. but will it be 3 doubled undertricks or 2 |pg||
nt|jbgood: sh be 3|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hello Rob and Rashid|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H says play your suit if weak|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N by S?|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has a good chunky 14 without @S|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    e/w should buy this in hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well done to her!|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: EW may even overbid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: I would prefer a 3@S from north   |pg||
nt|sybarra: agree David,   |pg||
nt|april7: I would have bid 3@S, but would be of no awayl anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: better description,  doubt I am beaten tin the home suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Roland, Rashid and Christian|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good steady bidding so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: welc rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N is less miss leading to me than a DBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: do NS play transfers here?|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has to realize that S probably has weak @S because 2N and not DBL|pg||
nt|santyclz: With those @hs, I'd bid 3nt even if a transfer were available.|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes me too Joe or transfer and bid 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: if you open NT that weak I like the 2@H and 2@S natural|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes no use transferring into a weak hand.|pg||
nt|ady: no good spot for n/s     e/w   have nice heart fit   looks good for 9 tricks       think trump lead best if they play in hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this is a 20 vs 20|pg||
nt|mariner1: everything from here on will be HIT|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I guess this is the way they show a minimum raise to 2S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hard for N/S to come in at the vulnerability|pg||
nt|april7: 1@D1@S1!NTperhaps 2@C nonforcing and then 2@S by W|pg||
nt|yo_yo: fantastic|pg||
nt|yo_yo: any women left now?|pg||
nt|xenya: i remember a hand from a yesterday's match where Reps didn't lead partner's suit against 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jbgood: unless NS overbids |pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@D is interesting|pg||
nt|santyclz: N took it as minors.|pg||
nt|mariner1: that would explain 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: it was long hesitating .....on N|pg||
nt|mariner1: N might have thought S had less than a full opener too|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: now on S thinking|pg||
nt|santyclz: Multi is not difficult to defend.  Many defenses word.  The only problem is both partners have to be using the same defense.|pg||
nt|mariner1: S is very RED to be coming in very weak|pg||
nt|santyclz: (work)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so since S would not come in weak I think N is being timid......|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think N has just enough for 3@S here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W could make many @H |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Worked well here because after 1S-2S, South might have balanced|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This is not looking good for E/W|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: one in the semifinal ...(Maria WÃ¼rmseer /Team Kondoch)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i saw something similar last night on BBO  they ended up in 3-3 @S fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: but all teams still playing for position|pg||
nt|xenya: but it didn't look well for NS a few moments ago|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Surely neither South or West can bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: of course :)|pg||
nt|ady: not clear for n/s to enter the b idding  vul against not    5@D like might well only go down 1|pg||
nt|eggy: And even if they had, they couldn't guarantee -1 by any means|pg||
mb|4H|nt|eamongall: ah yes ..there is the @DAK|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Apologies, our operator is Christian Kaeppel. Hallo Christian, good luck!|pg||
nt|santyclz: I like the treatment of coming in early (the 2@h bid) with minimum values and passing then taking action with stronger hands.|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT  was certainly going to be bad for n/s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NT forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: suit worth bidding is worth leading:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: since EW is the German National Team I wonder if that makes NS less|pg||
nt|mariner1: confident?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The difficulty in that is the rare case where 2@ds is passed out.|pg||
nt|stc: very good contract|pg||
nt|april7: it looks like E will lose 1 @S,1@H,1@D and 2 @C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: horrible to declare that hand doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: hi Christian|pg||
nt|yo_yo: usually not by passed hand?|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT  opening kept e/w out of the auction   |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: will the @D bid stop a @D lead, as maybe the @H will?|pg||
nt|mariner1: might not try for 4 now as not in it|pg||
nt|eggy: even with the diamonds 2-1 onside|pg||
nt|april7: at least 2 down on @D lead|pg||
nt|chick: that also happened in two other cases yesterday where I was working, both times against 3N and both times it cost a lot.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: probably will finish at 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: they will find their diamond fit now      will east sit the penalty double of west?|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure he will|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 2@D Dbl probably 2@S by North - it is more difficult the dbl at 2@s |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  When you lead against NT, it's not good to see AQ9xxx of the suit you led in dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: i think N knew E had long @Ds|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: they might end in spades|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good morning folks.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mariner1: board 1 was 9 imps|pg||
nt|ady: spade position favourable Steve for 5@D to only go down 1|pg||
nt|rnmalik: if you pass with 11 or 12 first seat than ...........|pg||
nt|yo_yo: still, it's non vul |pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: if declarer plays it VERY well, he can get out for -1, taking 4 trumps, a @D, a @H and a @C|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: 6@D   the better slam   has chances with a 4-1 club split|pg||
nt|stc: he can make also 3@s if guessing @s|pg||
nt|stc: which is not the % play|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Now needs the heart finesse just to make 2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Aiming to ruff a diamond might have been safer|pg||
nt|stc: strange that he didn't go for a @d ruff first :(|pg||
nt|april7: @D ace and @D might cause E some difficulties, but E will succeed|pg||
nt|ady: if e/w get defence right this should ne down 1 |pg||
nt|yo_yo: can he make 4 trumps?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hlortz: no reason to risk the 3@S contract w @C finesse|pg||
nt|hlortz: rite no reason to risk 3@S contract|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 2@H was not my call|pg||
nt|ady: out of it now     east did not even wait for west   to take action after 2@D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H bec with void in @D East know to can pass the Dbl at 2@D by West|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes very lucky they can lead spades from North twice|pg||
nt|eggy: I know that, David, but the spades aren't always so nicely placed|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: might  well make on this lead|pg||
nt|ady: will neded to switch to clubs after hearts|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, but declarer is hoping to find @D 2/2 !|pg||
nt|ady: west should discourage sspades now|pg||
nt|ady: with out diamonds 2-2  this would be around down 3 on club switch|pg||
nt|xenya: sure -- just don't touch them|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose North gets endplayed|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: hunt the Q@D now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mariner1: hiJOe|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|xenya: an imaginative lead, in the hope of pinning a possible stiff @DQ with W|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, having chosen diamonds the King is the correct card|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: small @h gives another entry|pg||
nt|xenya: but it's just a guess|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: well snuck one by|pg||
nt|ady: agree     just saying as it is   only down1   |pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: in fact if clubs are 4-1 they can be ruffed good for the 12th trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good evening|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|april7: Kof @S and @C finsse|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: the @c lead here was reasonable however leading from KJ's is not for the timid|pg||
nt|mariner1: setting up to cross ruff|pg||
nt|santyclz: And/or trying to get the opps to lead trump.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The two suited opening will help declarer place the cards|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer is making all kinds of plans assuming North has the ten of diamonds :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Tom Jacob|pg||

nt|yo_yo: christian have you the link to the website please|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also @H lead make - impossible for defence to play a second round of @H|pg||
nt|ady: partner has shown strong no-trump values    usally best to lead a trump|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this agree David|pg||
nt|ady: assume 8@S   udca    discouraging|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer is playing for overtricks but defenders don't know that|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzqt: tries to make overtrick now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: W can hook either pointed suit but not both|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jbgood: he will guess clubs - or else|pg||
nt|eamongall: I presume the doubles allow us play @Cs correctly |pg||
nt|jbgood: 4 down|pg||
nt|april7: not the best idea|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mariner1: he knows the @S position so that is the safer one|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: that's a bit fortunate |pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: www.bridge-verband.de there must be a link running score|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Very well played so far|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  heart finesse now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rnmalik: the crunch point|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yo_yo: so he will x ruff the hand and cash clubs on the way  for +1|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mariner1: cross ruff now|pg||
nt|ady: no slip ups from defence   so can only be a small loss for e/w|pg||

nt|Walddk7: http://www.bridge-verband.de/web/news/654  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lost 3NT |pg||
nt|mariner1: so a plus however maybe a imp loser|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 trick ruffing with A in @H at end - deconcentration by declarer, happen|pg||
nt|ady: grand slam in diamonds|pg||
nt|stc: he must take the @h hook, he will still make with @s 2-2 and he needs it with @s 3-1|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, they lost their spade trick somehow|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the names of the teams  are they regions or names of the players?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: Bamberger Reiter = German Best + National Team .....Team Ludewig named by player|pg||

nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I take it all back, looks like a diamond is the best lead|pg||
nt|xenya: something weird has happened there -- i can't quite follow that|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: only part scores here|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: slow play already 14 min late|pg||
nt|ady: will west overcall here?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|eamongall: I understood ..jb|pg||
nt|jbgood: Eamon - you are great!|pg||
nt|april7: 1NT by S and 2@S by E|pg||
nt|sybarra: in fact on bd 1,  the "only 50" bought n/s 3 imps|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting hand 4@S or 3NT|pg||
nt|stc: Is 6@h makeable here ?|pg||
nt|ady: to much to do with hearts 4-0 to make 6@H a good proposition    |pg||
nt|motbocaj: both majors?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT NS|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 9 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S for E/W, 3@D 1 down for N/S|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: but no double no trouble ......we like some tension|pg||
nt|yo_yo: speak for yourself!|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: nice slam here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rnmalik: part score either way|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 4@h?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score may be 2@S but W would not settle for it|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS could get too high here,,,,,, or possibly make 3N|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Might not make with spades 2-2 if they can get a heart ruff and make trumps separately|pg||
nt|april7: a nice slam in @Dand @C and NT because of distribution|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed 12 tricks are there for NS|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thank you|pg||
nt|bridge_one: lose 3@S and 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this may well go down 3|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H shows the 4@H and 5@S less than game force|pg||
nt|mariner1: can they find the grand?|pg||
nt|stc: very destructive opening|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  could be in trouble here|pg||
mb|d|nt|eamongall: there was a guy watching the rugby outside  in smoking shelter of a bar and everytime there was a score he ran in to cheer with those inside the bar .. |pg||
nt|mariner1: though game makes here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think so|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 7@C not so good|pg||
nt|stc: sure, but  low probability|pg||
nt|ady: need to ruff a club  and at  least one diamond in the south hand  so unlikely to pick up QXXX hearts  |pg||
nt|eggy: kept EW out of trouble anyway|pg||
nt|motbocaj: slam is definitely in Norths mind|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Q@C will solve all problems|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so bamberger is what?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D xfert |pg||
nt|xenya: could you resist the temptation with the N hand, Kath?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult to resist|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It's not so bad when declarer has to get it exactly right to avoid 2 down or more|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@h probably discouraging|pg||
nt|ady: yes    sorry    only 8 tricks in spades|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sharkey: East has very little respect for the colors here...|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3N would require the miracle guess in @S I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has a chunky 13 so............|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I agree, heart finesse is better but playing on diamonds before ace of trumps is better still|pg||
nt|stc: anyway thev major error was the early trump play|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C?|pg||
nt|xenya: but to sum up, it ended in down 2 in a makeable contract|pg||
mb|5S|nt|sybarra: where to begin |pg||
nt|mariner1: oops no game I meant|pg||
nt|mariner1: contradicting my own commentary :)|pg||
nt|april7: RKCB|pg||
nt|xenya: hello David|pg||
nt|ady: east did well to bid 1@S    not 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 8 tricks are not 100% here so neither is 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: good pass from S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: bec depending only from keycards - also if need a doubleton in @C, or find @C 2/2 or !Q in @c sgl if South have 3@C|pg||
nt|stc: 6@h seems OK with 2@c, 2@d, 1@s and 7 easy trick in cross ruff|pg||
nt|yo_yo: best?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: location of 1st league team|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so with xfert will play the weak hand :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this happen playing new system|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes I think S made a good move|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C is excellent here, yes |pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: not easy to play and S will go at least 2 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to play everything our of his hand |pg||
nt|mariner1: tough hand here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: You are WLC:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Quite a disciplined pass by w.|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  minor suit transfer    obviously 3 diamonds now must be forcing|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: the weak hand is the unkown ....the strong is known no disadvantage|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here however np, same result with E or W lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: but have forced NS too hight looks like|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D lead helps|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hands of highly disparate strength often play better in the weak hand's suit.  Not this time, though.|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to set up @S for @c pitches|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is makeable|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to hold to 2@H and a @S loser|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe needs help from W too|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as the cards are placed I still think 3NT was a better playable contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: well I see 8 in NT, the 9th would be an issue|pg||
nt|mariner1: and only one entry to S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 8 top tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW will provide the 9th|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room N used stayman over 1N...... auction still open|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt means 2 stop in both majors - with slam interest North would be reopen. But no guess|pg||
nt|ady: poor effort by south  with prime support  and top maximum  inclusing good controls|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 7 also excellent|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jbgood: a vital point - if you pass opps play a peaceful 1 NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: E does not like what he sees in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 3 nt are gone now 5@D|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Problem for North here, he has four card diamond support but everything else about his hand suits 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: east quiet here    but may be just as well  as 3@D should be down 1|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't like to bid 7 on 9 trumps missing the trump Q|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rnmalik: -1 on small @S lead but now it is a different ball game|pg||
nt|ady: hi Vladimir|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sharkey: and Narvik need IMPs!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good sequence-4@D minor suit key card-4NT=3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont understand German unfortunately but I like the "was ist bridge" on the website :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nigel_k:  East may be getting excited here - slam is good if West has just JC extra|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all sorry I am late,  just in from Finland ladies teams :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|nigel_k:  As it happens 5D also makes because spades are 3-3 so no ruff possible|pg||
nt|stc: IS N considering slam without @s control and lost values in @h?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I have no idea who is thinking or why :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: assfrage|pg||
nt|xenya: you've arrived just in time for a grand Shirley|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|eamongall: No respect ...but he was buying a good dummy ... how many does 2@S go for ... maybe only 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they bid both his best suits,,,,,,,, and he is very RED|pg||
nt|ady: no entry to north hand   so will have to play clubs from south|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North may be getting excited too :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so I see |pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: may make - |pg||
nt|sybarra: that 8 of clubs is huge card for e/w |pg||
nt|stc: note that with inverted @h/@ss slam is cold !|pg||
nt|stc: now trembling :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hlortz: nice @D play!|pg||
nt|mariner1: would have been better off duck with J@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: great @D play yes........ how did he see that|pg||
nt|hlortz: dont think he did was just trying to set up maybe 2 @D tricks...got lucky|pg||
nt|yo_yo: excuse my lack of geographical knowledge but now i know about Bamberg being a city  ty helmi|pg||

pc|h5|nt|sybarra: we ended with a grand,that no one could bid in Finland |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jbgood: y - might make|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/Sanremo.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|granguru: GOOD STOP|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|rayhaa: it depends on agreement i guess|pg||
nt|rayhaa: u can bid 2@h as non forcing and X as neg or invitational or vice versa|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes to some extent--but in my case it would be qa choice--could start with either--except that a subsequent heart bid would not be forcing if I doubled first|pg||
nt|roswolf: but i suppose it might have kept e/w out of a spade partscore|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: this looks -1 or even 2|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|othered1: pinpoint bidding, with the @SK not in opening bidder's hand|pg||

nt|mariner1: interesting breaks here|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: welcome back.....|pg||
nt|ady: west gave an overtrick   but should not cost|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7@D bid in Open Room|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C   here|pg||
nt|stc: very well done if they find it|pg||
nt|april7: is S should have ducked first trick there could hve been also squeeze possibilities against 4-1 @D distribution|pg||
nt|cicus: another game for EW|pg||
nt|cicus: on even less HCPs...|pg||
nt|cicus: but of course they will have to save 5@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C made for favorable layout of cards|pg||
nt|yo_yo: unlucky but probably a flat board|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi David|pg||
nt|sybarra: essential for the grand for sure|pg||
nt|xenya: this one might be exciting too|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: your were right, think e/w can make 9 tricks in @D's |pg||
nt|mariner1: I do not know if there is a RESULTS link so if anyone has one please forward it|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S saves NS from being in 4|pg||
nt|hlortz: 2@S muiderberg?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S must be Muiderberg/Tartan type|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5 5 with minor and less than opening count likely|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This should be a routine 3NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part score |pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: both minors are good to play|pg||
nt|cicus: as soon as N shows the minorsthe S hand will grow considerably|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for N/S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: instead|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S   an easy contgract for e/w      n/s  can make 5@C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: on 14 North declared 2@S...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: -3|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mariner1: nice weak 2 in W, white vs red|pg||
nt|stc: NS must stop in 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: E could well leap into 3 or 4 sp |pg||
nt|mcphee: tempted he is|pg||
nt|sybarra: ooops|pg||
nt|sybarra: this makes it interesting |pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: I think best for EW was to play 3@Cs ..|pg||
nt|santyclz: 21+ inch screen is helpful.  On my 12" laptop 1 room is enough.|pg||
nt|mariner1: E likes it|pg||
nt|cicus: can't tell what X is, maybe E tries to slow thng down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W make 4@s with lead @H|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    likely 2@H  n/s|pg||
nt|ady: cant play 2@H now|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mariner1: so it pinpoints the @D suit unless there are 6@S|pg||
nt|ady: south   timid  passing 4@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably South evaluate opps could have also slam with 4cards in @C without any trick|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A victory for Bausback then, he did two tricks better :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: true|pg||
nt|ady: south double|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This may push them overboard|pg||
nt|xenya: E's opening might stop NS reaching a hopeless game|pg||
nt|ady: wonder if n/s play leb|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm sure they would have bid 4@H if left to their own devices|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: those 2@DX and 2@CX often have enough to escape |pg||
nt|sharkey: showing 4@H and longer minor?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I should not doubt you |pg||
nt|ady: duplicating sing diamond for e/w    3NT   best spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: can EW find the slam? they should|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H Ogust? showing good suit good hand?|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the bad old days, the auction would be 2@s 6@s.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E has a massive hand.3@H singleton?|pg||
nt|mariner1: confirmed it is Ogust|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: although its june :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: the only outside strength W could have is A@H or K@D so E has to be thinking 6 or|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 6-er or 5/5 with @D preemtive|pg||
nt|mariner1: E not loving either suit|pg||
nt|ady: another split deck    probably 1NT   n/s  |pg||
nt|eggy: and it has to be made|pg||
nt|ady: bad diamond split  means only 11 sure tricks   west will need to draw 2 trumps to stop north making 9@C when playing diamonds   but a lucky spade position can compensate|pg||
nt|stc: S will also fight for a while, N may preempt in @h|pg||
nt|april7: @C partscore from NS (4@C)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4 card major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose he might have run all his @D and tried to endplay someone|pg||
nt|cicus: but S has too great help in the minors, he won't stop short of 5m|pg||
nt|ady: they can still bid a slam if he passes     dont think it is right to pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: intersting 4 NT|pg||
nt|mcphee: now easy to reach 4@H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all.|pg||
nt|mariner1: and EW are very red|pg||
nt|april7: 3@C only, sorry|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with holding 4@S DBL |pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 1@C alert, so probably they play 1@D with 4cards, so 1@c can be only 2 cards|pg||
nt|ady: west bidding on anyway   so n/s should get a plus score|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in this situation many use Dbl to say at p don't play natural (@C here)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: don't lead..|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jbgood: you should have a very good reason to pass a take-out double, not sure E in the CR had that|pg||
nt|sharkey: More IMPs to Narvik...|pg||
nt|mariner1: Operator humour :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: no my fault wasnÂ´t alerted....(betterminor)|pg||
nt|eggy: not a given although the spade position may retrieve the position if declarer plays two rounds of trumps |pg||
nt|april7: wrong position of honourcards,S shouldn pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass-rdbl 0/1 key perhaps|pg||
nt|bridge_one: even/odd|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 3NT but also 5 @C|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Mike|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Mike|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good morning Mike.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: so E knows its 6 now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Just arrived from Turku, and just in time for a slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D now for Q@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: makes 7 if no @H lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: correct:)|pg||
nt|stc: S very conservative this time|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems strange to me, 4 card majors and a strong NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that K@H was bothering him|pg||
nt|cicus: now Piekarek's tactics have backfired|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can only make 11 tricks on a diamond or trump lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now North would Dbl, otherwise lead in @D !|pg||
nt|xenya: no problem now either|pg||
nt|ady: not so sure  4@H will go down   with J@S right   a club loser may be discarded on the 10@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: will not be a good advert for their methods...|pg||
nt|motbocaj: I was wondering if E would support @C's|pg||
nt|april7: N must bid now 3NT or 4@C and go down|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North will not be bullied|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even when he possibly should be|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, David, my verdict was too hasty perhaps |pg||
nt|ady: take A@D now  andc play K@S  have a chance   though J@S right is against the odds|pg||
nt|sybarra: hope that was not commentators curse,  wd N |pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: in Ireland its called anti ...in USA suction ... (although I don't know rest of system)|pg||
nt|jbgood: maybe @d and one higher Carl|pg||
nt|eamongall: yes .. like @DKQT9 maybe |pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@C is checkback or similar NMF|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Christian|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in UK we have 4 card majors and a weak NT or 5 card majors and a strong NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nigel_k:  I don't recommend reversing on that North hand, but nothing is very attractive|pg||
nt|stc: 10 tricks|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mariner1: 7@H is a save at 1400 :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: And since people who x for a lead seldom lead it themselves...|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is one reason I do not like these type calls are VUL vs NV|pg||
nt|stc: give S a 5-4 minors, slam is good|pg||
nt|stc: N must show extra values somehow|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S has overbid his hand|pg||
nt|ady: problem for defence is they cannot play clubs without helping declarer|pg||
nt|mcphee: making 6, next|pg||
nt|sybarra:  ????|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mariner1: though it could go for 1700|pg||
nt|mariner1: @SA being in S helps|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: they are already playing I cant folloe this one......only give result|pg||
nt|mariner1: np Christian|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: because of net problems ....sorry fellows|pg||
nt|rnmalik: J@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: 9 or 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|mariner1: we blame all of those on Santy :)|pg||
nt|cicus: not if he has decided in advance to go to 5...|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Bob|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mariner1: nah, 1400 seems its max|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good for us:)|pg||
nt|ady: maymay scrape home  |pg||
nt|ady: not clear to me to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|april7: what a lead!?!?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we play 5 card majors and NT slightly balanced hand|pg||
nt|cicus: not the best lead :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: now cold|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@H is justified bec if the kay in East is a Ace can play slam with 11@S in the line wihout the K|pg||
nt|chick: must cash @CA or lose it|pg||
pc|h7|nt|eamongall: and you are still wrong side of declarer|pg||
nt|eamongall: multi landy I am told .... thats a fine defence to NT |pg||
nt|sharkey: Kibs confirm 2@H shows 4@H and longer minor...|pg||
nt|jbgood: I passed 2@c doubled five 5 good trumps after my prd had neg doubled in a European Chship once - was an uptrick:(, |pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - I thought you referred to the bidding in the CR Carl|pg||
nt|eamongall: I know folk who reuse their multi stuff as defence to NT ...also folk who play 2@Cs for majors only ....but very few in Ireland are sophisticated enough for both at same time |pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - no|pg||
nt|jbgood: this 3@h is the modern way of playing multilandy - a 4 card major and a longer minor|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@h|pg||
nt|eamongall: JB ... I can beat that ... I held @HKQ8754 and them trumps and a bidding partner ..and a lady by the name of Irene Robinson cruises into 4@Hs ...well what should I do |pg||
nt|sharkey: Narvik have come out smoking this half and really put the pressure on Topbridge.  Although they're ahead at halftime they may sense the tide's turning here...|pg||
nt|jbgood: you should ask her out for dinner:)|pg||
nt|eamongall: the lady made it ... (no uptrick) and the Deep finesse indicates 10 tricks available |pg||
nt|eamongall: oh yeah I doubled |pg||
nt|sharkey: if she was good looking your defence may have suffered....|pg||
nt|sharkey: Reistand's in the tank....|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 down, and as a kib said, 1-0 in favour of Dont over Multilandy|pg||
nt|jbgood: not - one of the players left for the bathroom..|pg||
nt|mariner1: the 7@D in Open Room tied up the score|pg||
pc|h4|nt|stc: expected small swing on 14|pg||
nt|rnmalik: vow:)|pg||
nt|april7: N told EW that he has @D stopped|pg||
nt|mcphee: sure, 12 easy now|pg||
nt|sybarra: well true,  that was cash it or lose it |pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: @S suit is remarkably friendly here |pg||
nt|chick: if they were in 6, I'm sure he would have :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh|pg||
nt|sybarra: being vul Reps held bach |pg||
nt|sybarra: make that "back"|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and no 7 with @H lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: open in NV but beef it up RED vs WHITE would be my thinking|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder why fritsche thinks 2@D is superior to 1NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are very favourably placed for E|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: E can have any strong hand 2@cs was asking strenghts and distribution|pg||
nt|rnmalik: he does not have a positive entry and no help other than @Ds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so what was the 1NT rebid?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: a guess now -- best reurn perhaps|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bridge_one: yes, in open room both players choise don't play 3Nt :)|pg||
nt|april7: but still not help enough|pg||
nt|xenya: but declarer got it right -- 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - they're feeling the pressure (no pun intended...) |pg||
nt|rnmalik: with xx @S he had no choice |pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am making you  work hard Christian, what is 1NT rebid pls |pg||
nt|ady: this may be flat     as it is likely 5@C may be bid in OR  and east will go to 5@S anyway|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rnmalik: small @C to the 9 -W endplayed |pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: i ask wait|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: now no need to finesse J@S|pg||
nt|xenya: no @S finesse is needed now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|eamongall: well both Don't and multi landy win ... as 3@Cs is safe haven for EW |pg||
nt|xenya: sorry Andy|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|eggy: no - if partner dowesn't want club support with this hand, 3@C was probably the wrong bid|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: better to continue diamonds    but e/w  can always make    just lose 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: all said it is a gift from EW:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nigel_k:  No it's lucky they can take nine tricks before letting opponents in again|pg||
nt|stc: E doing too much....|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, but if the bid in other go in the same way the can stop at 4@s|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: west has discarded 1 heart too many     nice duck of J@C by east|pg||
nt|ady: if west had 1 more heart now  contract would be down|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Notice how the two suited opening helps declarer place the cards|pg||
nt|ady: np|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: still south has to play spade to tje jack|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hlortz: yep this is 1100 territory|pg||
nt|april7: now its enough help,but W could have been endplayed |pg||
pc|h9|nt|mariner1: @S back now|pg||

nt|ady: 6@D on board 2    not bid in OR|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 of either major works here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H better|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H does play easier|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: now in time :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: last one|pg||
nt|hlortz: 5@D looks good here|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 5@D nice spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@H here?|pg||
nt|stc: where E played @d at trick 2 and made 2@s|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand |pg||
nt|stc: ew may stretch to 4@h|pg||
nt|april7: I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sigh of relief from E:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: But u see even World Champions make silly mistakes ......gives us hope for the game :)|pg||
nt|april7: now an easy 3NT by NS for a change|pg||
nt|stc: perhaps E didn't discard the J@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I see a swing board. I hope I am wrong.:)|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm things changed so rapidly in this board I could hardly keep up |pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W np until 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: hands getting more and more interesting|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S can play 3 in any majors|pg||
nt|xenya: well it was basically a 50% slam -- a fraction less, and that fraction materialised|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You don't normally do well when your side plays the same contract at both tables, unless it is 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: game is 16 min delayed so might get trouble with time|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@S over the weak jump a far better raise I am sure:)|pg||
nt|xenya: he just claimed 11 i think|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, lazy claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: too fast claim from smirnov .....forgetting @d falls and make 12 ....so claimed for 11 accepted|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2S|nt|jbgood: if Topbridge lose by more that 16 imps (13-17) Studenetene may overtake them with a maximum win|pg||
nt|ady: this looks like 4@H   or possible 3NT for n/s|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW could be in a tough game here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7@H if no @D lead|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good 6NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as if the previous one was not easy after A@D lead.|pg||
nt|cicus: a tough thing now for EW to keep their nerves|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I could manage to lose 3 @s tricks in 4@ss.|pg||
nt|ady: yes    13 tricks without diamond cashed|pg||
nt|april7: but then W could have been endplayed by not cashing the ace of @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: yes she did !J discard|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: dont worry about that ,,,, they are top 10 of world|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can compet to 3@D       n/s   may or may not make 3 or a major|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think you always make with 2-2 trumps and half the 3-1s, that is about 65%|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: 4@H   looks fairly routine   making 10 or 11 tricks on spade view|pg||
nt|mariner1: can make 6@H in fact|pg||
nt|mariner1: that splinter might get them there|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S for EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: can make 6@D with no @H lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H warns E about distribution|pg||
nt|ady: and they m ight get a message if they do|pg||
nt|april7: sorry, I lost connection with BBO.Now I am back|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Is transfer and pass enough with West?|pg||
nt|april7: now it will be expensive for EW|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not vuln 3@D - i agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: and penalty points|pg||
mb|d|nt|stc: 14 tricks after loosing the A@H|pg||
nt|cicus: so in their anxiety they will probably bid game now|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, correct|pg||
nt|mcphee: hope to not lose by 1 in the end :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: unfortunately we do not have live board-by-board update - as this is becoming very exciting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 5@D|pg||
nt|stc: a pair not playing transfer, wow|pg||
nt|ady: north considering 3@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s  will pay high price for any save  vul against not|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C should get them to slam|pg||
nt|ady: wonder whether east will baalance|pg||
nt|chick: I have scars from that myself :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: drury of some sort |pg||
nt|april7: all leads by W are helpful except trump|pg||
nt|mariner1: K@S lead beats 6 though|pg||
nt|hlortz: the bold preempt worked|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe not, S has no quick entry so 6 not really a maker|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: nice 3 @H BID  so he cant bid @d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C probably 6+@H good suit and 4 @C (with 5/5 probably 3@C)|pg||
nt|stc: there is work to do even in 2@h|pg||
nt|cicus: I know the pair :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely worse than 50% Vlad, but maths is not my strong point|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@H comubg|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jbgood: I think the scores you see on Live Updates have been manually entered, so no live updates |pg||
nt|bridge_one: without points in @D and only 2 cards North can risk to raise|pg||
pc|hA|nt|april7: 2@C = Drury|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to lead a club now |pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S looks like it can be set|pg||
nt|hlortz: if it went for 800 we would call it something else LOL|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 top tricks with stiff K@C|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: found slam easy enough|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West really wants to bid a quantitative 4NT|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But it is probably Blackwood now|pg||
nt|stc: here you can also make 6@c@D! and even @Hs !!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H+2@D+2@C+1@S=9 (contract)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: needs @h switch|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need to switch @H before play AKx@S|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sharkey: Another double score for Narvik?|pg||
nt|ady: that wont exactly give south any problems|pg||
nt|rnmalik: BRAVO|pg||
nt|mariner1: any other lead and N can ruff out the @c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C could be also a cue if Dbl at 2@H means good raise in @H|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think they used 2D GF Stayman in the last set so that makes sense|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@H passing sequence-transfer|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: @D out also causes an issue though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no - discard two clubs and a spade on the diamonds and lead a spade up (still have to guess though)|pg||
nt|ady: got their only trick|pg||
nt|stc: with 89@H falling|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very good sequence then|pg||
nt|cicus: they should have bid it, it seems|pg||
nt|ady: have to be carefull here     just needs heart wswitch|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N made on 2 in OR -- 11 imps to Bamberger Reiter|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: he said he claimed 11 because not thinking of missing a slam ....(positive thinking)|pg||
nt|chick: hehehe|pg||
nt|badjunior: bei dem Stand muss man etwas forscher an die Sache rangehen|pg||
pc|c4|nt|april7: S has to ruff third @D with 9 of @H|pg||
nt|ady: ooops|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it happen playing bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: now Q and home|pg||
nt|bridge_one: overall playing without to see all cards :)|pg||
nt|xenya: better than 50 as Nigel has just pointed out|pg||
nt|mcphee: awesome to bid only 3@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: I bid 4 myself:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you Bob |pg||
pc|sT|nt|mariner1: looks like 2@H 1@C and 1@D unless defense helps|pg||
nt|mariner1: certainly worked this time|pg||
nt|stc: u r wright|pg||
nt|april7: 1 down ,because W has to lose 3 @H tricks,1@C,1@D and 1@S trick|pg||
nt|stc: Wondering if good to give up transfers|pg||
nt|stc: 2@d X -> -4, but N still not recovered....|pg||
nt|april7: take with K or duck once,then QJ of @H and Ace of @C!|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: as Avram said   leads otgher than a trump will help declarer|pg||
nt|mariner1: claim|pg||
nt|ady: should make    hearts well placed and will probably guess club queen|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|nigel_k:  More bad breaks on this hand too|pg||
nt|mcphee: that false card might cost him|pg||
pc|cA|nt|april7: not needed any more|pg||
nt|sybarra: not now |pg||
nt|santyclz: Only comfortable on a @c lead.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: small @C first|pg||
nt|april7: also ok|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with 6@S E would have bid 2@S|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rnmalik: I think W should have bid 2NT after transfer-3NT no play|pg||
nt|mariner1: wonder if going for 1100 has anything to do with this call|pg||
nt|april7: there is also no endplay possibility|pg||
nt|stc: probably not, according to the majority :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: although it should go down |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H 3 & 2 a help|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Bit short of entries to finesse hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: no need to guess|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eggy: Isn't there?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|nigel_k:  Claim at trick 1|pg||
nt|stc: Big swing on 15 where EW were allowed to play 4@h -4 NOT DOUBLED !!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North thought more probably K in @H in East, so he played for Q in @C in South|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: well 2@S after the DBL showed good @S|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: unlucky   if north had a 4th club   could make  ruffing 3 clubs in hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mariner1: has it now|pg||
nt|mcphee: down town billy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: you know the K@C position I dont. Would you play @CA|pg||
nt|april7: must play up to the Q anyway|pg||
nt|mcphee: push|pg||
pc|hT|nt|nigel_k:  It just really looks like there should be an endplay |pg||
nt|ady: also could make with diamond finesse  just ruffing 2 clubs |pg||
nt|eggy: He probably should have tried the elopment, but is short of entries now anyway|pg||
nt|motbocaj: and that would be a good (but unlucky) line.. would S take his D King on a low diamond now?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: 2 aces enough|pg||
pc|dK|nt|nigel_k:  This appears to be a hopeless, needs an endplay for one down|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: he will make 4 i think|pg||
pc|d2|nt|santyclz: In other words cold.  "Cold" in BBO-speak means "can be made double-dummy with a little help from the defense".|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 15 NS bid 3N in Open Room and it will be tough for that to make|pg||
nt|ady: could be a good result    others might get to higher contract|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Not sure what layout he is playing for|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mariner1: who said "cold"?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|stc: just making the transition to next board :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: safety play and good one|pg||
mc|9|nt|rnmalik: 2 is 2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Q @D an upper cut now guess for J@H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  will they find it|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we will see:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 9@H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: correct|pg||

nt|granguru: I didnt know how to play bridge yet and was working in the Bridge Rama |pg||
nt|vugraphb1: Karakolev discarded 10@C not small and -1 |pg||
nt|levix: 4s for E-W|pg||
nt|rodal f: As told before the pairs play pressision so there 2 openings are not easy to know.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2S|an| |nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Arifin Halim|pg||
mb|p|nt|beto: no save on this vul|pg||
mb|3H|an| |nt|rodal f: Polich club|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi all, esp Roland and Geoffrey|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: E-w might get higher if East splinters now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be a hard fight NS vs EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might vug can help:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|garnetts: West can get quite close to making 3NT I think but 4@S looks like losing a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: difficult to predict the final contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|rayhaa: another 4@s borderline|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: West is going to like his hand a lot|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  3NT is a lucky make here with a spade guess|pg||
nt|nickf: Support double from South, showing 3 spades|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They may also consider 4S game now after the diamond bid by East|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi arifin|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: At pess there came an auto 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: two cues and a signoff|pg||
nt|rodal f: NS have as I see it. 5@C on a finding at @D and EW 9 in @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: But a good spot for 4@S+1 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I'm not so sure about the signoff part|pg||
nt|Rafa: Other room play has stopped, Lucena called the director|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hard choice for North but 2H is pessimistic|pg||
nt|rayhaa: might have tried 3@h hoping for 3NT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: well a not much extra 4H|pg||
nt|duschek: 4 so-called losers in East - will he stop?|pg||
nt|kit: East has easy pass -- he already forced to game|pg||
nt|beto: he should|pg||
nt|beto: @D are not that good and he already splintered to game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he certainly could have more for splinter|pg||
nt|beto: like the @DK ; )|pg||
nt|levix: too aggressive|pg||
nt|rodal f: I feltthe whole time fore a re opening NS for fight. Did not need that.|pg||
nt|nickf: it was, I wonder what his options were?|pg||
nt|nickf: XX to show a maximum pass?|pg||
nt|nickf: 2NT perhaps to show 4S and just 2H ?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|levix: friendly lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Indeed. Better possibility for make it now|pg||
nt|levix: yes,makeable now even failed finesse of SQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: But the normal reading are K from a dobbleton|pg||
nt|rodal f: How many tricks Lerfald?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rayhaa: but this will prob be a push|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|granguru: can make 6 now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well done, not really 50-50 slam|pg||
nt|granguru: or go down|pg||
nt|beto: down no|pg||
nt|granguru: no 10 tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|granguru: sorry|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes friendly lie of the cards|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|beto: he can ruff the 3rd @D with the Ace|pg||
nt|kit: I'm not sure he can handle 12 tricks even without the spade being cashed|pg||
nt|beto: if he finesses on 1st trick|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|garnetts: It is very hard to get to 3NT here--and to make it the sequence of play must be very precise|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|granguru: looks like it is not possible to make 12|pg||
nt|levix: second trump play S10 better|pg||
nt|rodal f: As I see i there are7. Correct|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|beto: well chile stoped in 1N on board 4 so a few imps coming back|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|granguru: 3 rounds of @C now and @D10. |pg||
nt|beto: a lot actually|pg||
nt|duschek: 1NT should make so could easily be 9 imps|pg||
nt|beto: as declarer went for 300 gere|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: Do NS play preciccion or polich club?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphb1: Precision for both pairs|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d9|nt|beto: 120 for 9 imps i believe|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|rodal f: Reacted at the 1@D opening|pg||

nt|sybarra: back to bd 6 |pg||
nt|april7: 6@C by W|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C  a make on trump finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: its live ...other table too slow so boards are late|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very satisfactory from NS's point of view|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H here EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have 4@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 4@S NS|pg||
nt|mariner1: so EW can save in @H|pg||
nt|santyclz: The defense neglected to give the required assistance.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: he just had 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: part scores only here...........|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 1N or 2@H I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C NS?|pg||
nt|ady: another 20-20|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the only way to no make errors is ... the lead @H from South (versus a NT hand, the lead with 2honors generally work|pg||
nt|ady: yes   was not automatic  for north to find the right switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: and the former world champion found it for -2 :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  That's right, was it 1990 or 1994 they won?|pg||
nt|xenya: but that is likely to be a push -- or almost so|pg||
nt|xenya: after the double, the hand was an open book for him|pg||
nt|ady: unlikely to bid  it  but 6@C  a make for n/s|pg||
nt|xenya: what a hand|pg||
nt|xenya: do NS play a strong 1@C? -- i think they do|pg||
nt|ady: defence slipped   and still only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: now the great hand from before|pg||
nt|xenya: aha!|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: they had bad eyes changed 6 into nine|pg||
nt|sybarra: we apparently are at the speed table |pg||
nt|mcphee: that AQ@S with the 5th trump would have had me reaching 4@H faster|pg||
nt|sybarra: so would we most of us |pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: the younger ones do not discuss as much as entcho and michel do|pg||
mb|1C|nt|nigel_k:  East has a bad hand|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S  can make       I think  of the slams   6@C   best    |pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: so there will be lots of bidding|pg||
nt|rnmalik: np|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C EW ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: guess they have a play for 6@C too|pg||
nt|ady: part score    either clubs n/s   or hearts e/w|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, a genuine Yarborough|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you're going to play a partscore, 3@D looks safer than 2NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needs @h underleads against 4@ss.|pg||
nt|mariner1: hard to get there I think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but E did not open 1NT?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C should fail though|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A in @H and one @C must be lose|pg||
nt|ady: yes    5@C   makes|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h better if played by N, down if played by s on @c lead (lack of entries)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They'll do well to find hearts at all after the preeempt|pg||
nt|stc: yes, the may end in 4@s :)|pg||
nt|stc: they...|pg||
nt|stc: If NS compete, EW may overbid to 3@h|pg||
nt|stc: swing of the 6@c hand|pg||
nt|april7: another 3NT but this time not successful|pg||
nt|cicus: 5@D is the only game here for NS it seems|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D seam a multi|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: in 1990 with  Georg Nippgen|pg||
nt|ady: not bad playing no takes|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 2@c = min 6+ @c + 4 major possible or with diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: west has put a spoke in the works|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was just the bid,  E wanted to hear |pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: but its great atmosphere at the table ....laughing all the time with respect)|pg||
nt|sybarra: that makes nice table |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: other room played 3 more bds than we have |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes but that still allows 4@S to make|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW play weak NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C makes because @H are 4 3 and K@C in pocket,,, 3rd @D goes on @SA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West keep the 10 in @C ...|pg||
nt|mariner1: N wants to defend 2@H DBL|pg||
nt|ady: probably wont get there      |pg||
nt|rnmalik: what deals. I hope the computer is well rested:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Thanks|pg||
nt|mcphee: doomed minor suit game sadly|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: 2nt loses two aces and three spades - but you are lucky spades are 4-4|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D would be very unlucky to lose more than one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@D now?|pg||
nt|ady: I thin so|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I thought they were at lightening speed|pg||
nt|ady: this is not so easy to bid   and anyway on a finesse|pg||
nt|mariner1: would beat an aggressive 5@S though|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL here shows count|pg||
nt|mariner1: they might find 5@C now|pg||
nt|stc: 3NT has some play|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  3NT by North should be ok as the cards lie|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It's hard to beat 3C in practice I think|pg||
nt|cicus: 3NT is down on the obvious spade lead|pg||
nt|ady: wise decision by north|pg||
nt|yo_yo: was that pairs?|pg||
nt|ady: think|pg||
nt|xenya: we can only guess what 4@C is|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 4@c acequestion 4 @s 2 without|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead the worst      otherwise  pretty good|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C  I assumed just natural    precision?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: need to avoid 3NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: your analysis of the hand is correct. Let us see if they reach it?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I would have bid 3Nt with North I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: and lucky that diamonds split favourably|pg||
nt|mariner1: 15 was -200 and 8 imps|pg||
nt|stc: I think EW play 4 cards major|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Clearly N/S do as well :)|pg||
nt|motbocaj: Why not 2@H by east?|pg||
nt|cicus: is 1@C plish?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: no|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H or 4@H by W is a matter of taste here -- and some would prefer 1@H|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: the finesses is k stiff |pg||
nt|ady: west might bid 3@S now|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: boards dont come from open table ....but from another match|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh well|pg||
nt|mariner1: tough to think game looking at W|pg||
nt|ady: -500     not a bad score for n/s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2 down is sufficient for N/S, E/W are vuln|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   can make 8 tricks      n/s  might make 9 tricks in clubs  on a likely diamond lead    will need sspades attacked quickly to beat 3@C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: 6 @H would be a good save if EW should reach a slam|pg||
nt|ady: now 5@C   from east|pg||
nt|mariner1: now is the key ,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: and E can't tell W has the magic hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: S can't duck this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if south duck however 7 tricks the same for N/S|pg||
nt|stc: On @c lead ?|pg||
nt|april7: or @D, both are ok|pg||
nt|rnmalik: will have to play to make it-@S lead|pg||
nt|stc: it seems almost no play|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 5@C is nearly there|pg||
nt|cicus: I'm not sure S understands N's intentions|pg||
nt|ady: may just scramble home|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Rosenblum Cup - teams|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the trouble with that double is you know what partner will respond|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: team "rosenbloom"|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 4 NT forcing .....5 @h second round kontrolle in @h not in @d|pg||
nt|ady: on 2@H  opening 6@S   becomes  also good    might make 7  as a spec pointed out|pg||
nt|xenya: what's 5@H? |pg||
nt|xenya: and 4N, for that matter?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: I explained|pg||
nt|xenya: ah sorry|pg||
nt|ady: maybe assuming clubs the trump suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Isn't 6S always best if played by North?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: sorry, private|pg||
nt|stc: yes, he has to knock the A@h early|pg||
nt|stc: down if E continues @c|pg||
nt|april7: 8 tricks only,but you never know.....:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: right always keep defending mistakes in mind|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with @H lead E has 9 tricks at 3NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very good|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that as well |pg||
nt|rnmalik: S will bid 5@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: S shouldn't bid 5 unless N inverts his DBL's|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: S is thinking :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL to me here says I would rather defend|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it might mean no clear action|pg||
nt|santyclz: Rather timid by e.  The @hq upvalues (although not as much as it might) and he has controls in the other 3 suits.|pg||
nt|cicus: strange N did not repeat his double|pg||
nt|cicus: not that any game is  great|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: or sth like that|pg||
nt|mcphee: kinda  death wish shape to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|xenya: not opposite a passed partner though|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzqt: w thinking :)|pg||
nt|april7: since no @H honour with E, W might bid the slam now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E could bid 4@C-I would:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: good news here is @H are 3 2 and @SA lead helps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes they didnt overstretch on this one|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I think it should have been bid-3NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult for either to bid it though, neither has a @H stop|pg||
nt|cicus: but if they don't bid game, 3@C, although inferior, will do|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: maybe what would have helped would be a 4 @D (cue) bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry, meant 4 @S |pg||
nt|mcphee: those 7-2-2-2 hands not so nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: REPS THINKS OVER LAVINTHAL MARK|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed not, but you green vs red...|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: after 3 @s, 4 @S |pg||
nt|ady: yes  a fair point|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @c doesnt help pard,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: or 3N if they play it as showing K (ala Benito)|pg||
nt|ady: all said and doned 5@C  not an unreasonable spot    |pg||
nt|sybarra: something to show the @S holding |pg||
nt|mariner1: no clear action is pass to me....... S is a passed hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Kind of depends on whether you're in a forcing pass situation and I'm not sure.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless pass/dbl inverted, yes, a la Meckwell - pass would ask partner to double |pg||
nt|hlortz: this might go down/// IF NS get their @D tricks prompty|pg||
nt|ady: once the K@H placed then 6@S  looks good|pg||
nt|ady: can go up with ace  and make|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: Wladow gets angry .....because in system 5 @h means @h king :)|pg||
nt|ady: can make 7  going up with ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: and elinescu - said "shut up dear partner" and put ur cards on the table :) great|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|eamongall: maybe time for a tea|pg||
nt|ady: this should bed quick|pg||
nt|mariner1: N holding all the ourside Aces is not worried about a quick pitch so leads a trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: we are 10 min late so hurry up table :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: tomorrow we start at 10 MET :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  In 3C, once KH is gone declarer can play diamonds at his leisure|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|mariner1: did N really play low @S?|pg||
nt|stc: oops !|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, West doesn't overruff the jack and declarer gets locked in his hand|pg||
nt|stc: many IMPs on this (bad) switch|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 10@S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: pard reversed,  we are not stoppiing short of game after support of @H's  I am into slow approach,  even my q of @D should be working |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: the @D return is tempting, but it allows the contract to make|pg||
nt|mcphee: 800 is not a nice number to return with on score card|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: and smirnov is thinking if there is a squeeze anywhere to make if @D king is wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: especially when your teammates return with -100|pg||
nt|mcphee: well well, the hand can now make on the minor squeeze|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: :) Bob same idea :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: how interesting this has become|pg||
nt|badjunior: einen squeeze hÃ¤tte er nur mit @S D .|pg||
nt|mcphee: I highly doubt W would open 3@H also holding the K @D|pg||
nt|badjunior: dann allerdings hÃ¤tte rops den @H stechen mÃ¼ssen und @S nachspielen|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think there's a squeeze here|pg||
nt|chick: problem is, if the @DK is onside, then a simple finesse works and the squeeze costs the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: but he is thinking about it ....:) try to figuere out|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|xenya: E can discard a @D and a @S|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|sharkey: First 4 boards Narvik have outscored Top Bridge 19-0 this half|pg||
nt|eamongall: and i bet its sunny outside as the dog is in the garden for 1 hour and not a bid out of him |pg||
nt|mariner1: oh it was ruffed :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|ady: east's spade pips might take this down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i saw it work to bid not aggressive over a weak open also with strong hands - may be could be 4@H, but is rare !|pg||
nt|mcphee: I am a trcik ahead of myself|pg||
nt|mcphee: still 1 short|pg||
nt|mcphee: sorry|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jbgood: some kibs still think that the lacking updates are to be blamed on the organisers - that is not true. The software provided for them simply failed to do its job |pg||
nt|athene: now declarer can set up a club and make nine|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 16 W in Open Room also opened 2@S so will it be 1100 again?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: you can only DBL to show you want to defend or pass to show no clear action in|pg||
nt|mariner1: this auction,,,,,, there is no 100% forcing pass|pg||
nt|april7: @HJ@H@H and @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
pc|d6|nt|nigel_k:  What do people think of North's 1S compared to pass or double?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|motbocaj: I like 1@S -- lead directional value|pg||
nt|rnmalik: half check with E and 9 points worth a try and @C fit |pg||
nt|yo_yo: Fritsche is glad the see K@D wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: but if 5@H shows @HK, why didn't he bid 7?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mariner1: N bids 2N over the 2@S so it saves EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: that on 16 in Open Room|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: now 2 down|pg||
nt|mcphee: is he falling for this?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mariner1: if you did pass 5@H you would "usually" expect S to do something|pg||
nt|stc: OK in the context (4th hand, vulnerability...)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|sybarra: haveing problems with getting my @C symbol in order today,  after supporting @C I meant,  |pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: cant see @HQ being right?|pg||
nt|stc: let's say unlucky, not bad :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: but he had to rise @HA of course...both sides swapped a tempo loss there|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Right or wrong I would have bid 5@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@D making 4 did lose, however not to 3n making, it was 2@H X off 300|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hlortz: gentle defense here makes 2@H easy|pg||
nt|ady: this looks down 1|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|eamongall: its a tough life even running a vugraph show with say 6 tables ...|pg||
nt|mariner1: not I|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Running 9S now works I think|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: not certain here - North would be bididng 4@S to make at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But not finessing jack|pg||
pc|d5|nt|nigel_k:  It's easier seeing all four hands and North's shape was unexpected|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: DBL is the call to me......|pg||
nt|motbocaj: so was it best to cover the @S9 then...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|stc: vwd|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||

nt|nickf: neither had a great hand|pg||
mb|1N|an|weak|nt|nigel_k:  No and without 3-3 hearts they would be better off in a partscore|pg||
nt|ahalim: 3NT here|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks favorite|pg||
mb|2D|an|!h|nt|rodal f: 1@D at w?|pg||
mb|p|nt|beto: 2 balanced 12 count|pg||
mb|2S|nt|nickf: EW have to be careful if defending a spade game|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: they will stop below game|pg||
nt|granguru: 1@H shows 4+@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting |pg||
nt|nickf: But West will know what to do.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|beto: dont think they will stop...|pg||
nt|nickf: and Lavazza did bid and make the 4-3 spade game on 5|pg||
nt|nickf: either West or North could be thinking here, I think the operator puts in 2 bids at a time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: or exactly 4 I believe|pg||
nt|kit: and the 1@S call probably shows exactly 3|pg||
nt|garnetts: Heavy 2@S|pg||
nt|rayhaa: looks like problems with connection between tables, so score in film is wrong|pg||
mb|4S|nt|garnetts: Lite 3@H |pg||
nt|ahalim: and a lot of tricks w/o a @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: was that 5C by North or East ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|beto: well, they did|pg||
nt|duschek: Or could show a small balanced hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it also is usually dead minimum|pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|kit: Takes a lot of courage to stop at 2NT vulnerable -- a fine line to walk|pg||
nt|beto: agree kit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east could have a no trick 12 count|pg||
nt|duschek: Seems to make 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|kit: and this time it looks like they were wrong|pg||
nt|granguru: agree but e has minimum minimum and 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is up to opener with anything extra|pg||
nt|kit: those 10's have a way of adding up on hand's such as these|pg||
nt|beto: i cw seen to many agressive openings by paca and ben|pg||
nt|duschek: There are three very valuable tens which they forgot to include in their HCP count|pg||
nt|beto: so here is where they pay the price for opening 10 and 11 counts|pg||
nt|levix: 3s good stop,but still down|pg||
nt|nickf: well 5m would have been a phantom save against 4S.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was it right by W to press on?|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see an opening in E and 2@S fin|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: we had openning from N without comment on table|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: even so doubt this is much over 30%|pg||
nt|beto: really?|pg||
nt|beto: wow|pg||
nt|kit: my general philosophy is:  If I don't accept a game invitation, it is because I think we may be too high already|pg||
nt|beto: argetnina reached 6@H and the @SA was lead on board 6|pg||
nt|rodal f: But I can not se Batov bidding @S after pards minor bid|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|garnetts: I really dislike West's actions--if he consults partner they can defend 3@H which where they belong |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: And Panev are a gooooood player|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT by those atone 15 at W? I would have upgraded them or made it the line under. 1@D and later bid|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: well try it on a club lead|pg||
nt|granguru: this is board 6|pg||
nt|rodal f: atone was stone|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|rodal f: In white the line always are easyer at HP|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Board 5|pg||
nt|beto: sry board 5|pg||
nt|levix: no middle cards,or 3nt makeable for e-w,|pg||
nt|rodal f: Def to hard for N|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Rafa: other room board 5 6@h E @SA lead|pg||

pc|d9|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|rayhaa: thk x better than 3@h, than maybe S wld play something else than @h lead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|garnetts: it is better--then so is redouble initially--then you can bid 2@S and go to sleep |pg||
nt|garnetts: east will now lose five more tricks|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Rafa: We are broadcasting from the Sheraton Hotel in Santiago de Chile|pg||
nt|beto: In the ladies match brazil is trailing by 4 against argentina with 16 to go i was told|pg||

pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Not easy to see, but often it's right to drive at the road u have fond.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: Still. 3NT are to be 1 down|pg||

nt|ady: another grand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7@H ?  6 likely|pg||
nt|ady: well done    but  10@S  should have been played|pg||
nt|eggy: and promote the S , one way or another|pg||
nt|eggy: S6|pg||
nt|cicus: layout is perfect for 3NT for NS|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Unfortunate for the defence - they had no choice but to keep helping declarer|pg||
nt|mcphee: hmmmmm, S must have been searching for the newspaper hand fo the year :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe with the lead,  thought it may not matter?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mariner1: part scores is all here|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe a tough 3N EW or 4@H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the counterplay by south was the best, knowing good @H in North (otherwise impossible to bid for penalty at 2@H)|pg||
nt|mcphee: this may produce some activity|pg||
nt|xenya:  had E ducked 2nd @D he would have been eventually squeezed -- very nice play by declarer |pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: if E ducks once the @D he got squeezeed only chance smirnov tried|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: great thought|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: yes xenya :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: explaing why you ducked the setting trick in a vul contract is one of the most dfficult things to do:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: the presentation has been  improved immensely by software / bridgemate things for us spectators |pg||
nt|ady: looks like the best spot is 4@S for n/s    but might play ina minor|pg||
nt|sybarra: a funky multi bid it looks like |pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like part score battle here|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H are right and @c are right|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: Martin rehder seemed to be upset p did not follow @cs ......but next one|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  can make 3NT   or 5@C      |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H EW|pg||
nt|april7: right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so  they could gain on that if the OP is in game|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S might have led a @D|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Would North lead low from a doubleton honour?|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand      maybe  2@H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hlortz: they dont play the 10pt NT VUL |pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: best contract is 4@S and 5@H are only 2 down|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I agree, doubling 5@H looks best with that North hand...it is just that there are different ways to do it|pg||
nt|santyclz: I would pull with a 6th @s, but not with that hand.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N vs W:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|stc: Big swing on 4 after Q@S lead and questionable declarer play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4 @S or ??:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: seem 1@C strong ...|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: Using the Meckwell agreement, North can pass (requests double) and then pass  |pg||
nt|mariner1: NS need to find the @H fit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@D here?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ludewig avoided the doomed slam|pg||
nt|xenya: a neat defence (2 @S ruffs) would have set it by 2 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5 of  either minor makes|pg||
nt|mariner1: so EW steal one|pg||
nt|mariner1: QJ @c xx make this a winner EW|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C strong except 16/18 one suit hand 6 cards - they open 2@D that hands)|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  do have a good save against 7@H   |pg||
nt|eggy: highly questionable actually|pg||
nt|rnmalik: one positive entry with W might make 6:)|pg||
nt|april7: E has actually more than 10  tricks but no entry to them|pg||
nt|april7: K of @S instead of Q|pg||
nt|yo_yo: doubled?|pg||
nt|ady: west would do well to sell out|pg||
nt|ady: depends how ambitious south is|pg||
nt|xenya: NS will likely end up in 3N here -- a pretty hopeless contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: everyone has a suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: does not matter if 1 or 2 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: reasonable decision    bad hearts and good points outside to make 1NT     |pg||
nt|sybarra: anyone for 3 @C by s?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mcphee: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: with QJ@C no problem|pg||
nt|mariner1: my general feeling is you have to strain over a weak NT, even VUL|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cuts both ways|pg||
nt|mariner1: Welcome David Greenwood (Ireland)|pg||
nt|mariner1: or possibly when partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: or both|pg||
nt|hlortz: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 14-16 valnurable|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Christian|pg||
nt|ady: -1700  good save |pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  better    does not require heart finesse|pg||
nt|ady: east has a problem if north passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: but we still should remember 21 years ago we had folk who could score a 15-17  table mitchel with a pencil in 20 minutes |pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - but the software here dealing with the Bridgemate was not working properly..|pg||
nt|sybarra: E may just be waiting in the bushes here to trot out 5 @H,  guess not |pg||
nt|mariner1: right N's DBL says we are beating 5@H, so S should only pull if he thinks 5@S has|pg||
nt|stc: @c continuation is good even if W has double @C, don't know how the show count |pg||
nt|cicus: now the only problem is the play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: best defense 5@H  -800    spade ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 too many |pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: good play|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H not too bad a spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: likely to make 3|pg||
nt|stc: it does on a @d switch|pg||
nt|motbocaj: some might have bid 3@S over 1@S to ask for @S stop, and take a chance on the diamonds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C is natural or strong Christian ?|pg||
nt|xenya: admittedly 2 down is tough, but 1 is quite possible|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: south's double was presumably support showing three spades|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H shows a fit and a max|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Aggressive action by South has worked here|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  4S may make with good guesses and anyway has pushed opponents one level too high|pg||
nt|stc: Can make if guessing the A@h short|pg||
nt|stc: but not if he play on @d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: why 3 can be passed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: DBL|pg||
nt|yo_yo: come on Kirmse|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: now he thinks about dbl|pg||
nt|ady: dont understand 3@C   if  playing strong club    would have tht 2@S    by east|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: well the 7 was not likely to be bid|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes 3NT better, 5C can also fail if North has Jxx of clubs|pg||
nt|stc: not after the X, W showed some values|pg||
nt|april7: I don't think so, the X was GF|pg||
nt|stc: looking for trouble, already -800|pg||
nt|april7: now the X is tops, 4 down!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S has saved the situation and now we might see 4@S DBL|pg||
nt|bridge_one: kibitzs told me 1@C 3+cards - nat|pg||
nt|ady: spec tells me they play acol|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: kirmse play no strong club zimmermann do|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ty Christian !|pg||
nt|ady: ok thx       now understand 3 clubs|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: it's easy to have problems in these auctions when responder only has 4 in his suit, and goes to a new suit|pg||
nt|athene: how strong is 3@C in this auction?|pg||
nt|hlortz: 4@H easy with both @C @H finesses on|pg||
nt|mariner1: and no spots in @H missing either|pg||
nt|mariner1: 9@H not an issue since @H are 3 2 onside|pg||
nt|stc: ..plays...|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't see a clear-cut line|pg||
nt|cicus: there are many possible ways to the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: nice judgement for safe + score|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: it can help if you play lebensohl but easy to have misunderstandings over whether 3@C is weak, invitational or forcing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: seem E/W play 4 cards RED|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: bd 6 the other room tried the ill fated 3 nt |pg||
nt|eggy: will probably just cash his tricks now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: the slam on 17 was played in 4@S -1 in Open Room so 14 imps|pg||
nt|hlortz: note he will start x@H not J in case of singleton K onside|pg||
nt|ady: well 7 is not a good contract|pg||
nt|stc: sry, miscounted @c :(|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am surprised Kirmse didnt support @S though|pg||
nt|cicus: I think clubs offer greater chance than diamonds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: weak NT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jbgood: the double may induce declarer to go wrong in trumps|pg||
nt|mcphee: I would never have considered passing as S after partner o/c 2@D|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: makeable|pg||
nt|ady: this m ay well be 2 or 3 down|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|stc: The absolute top in pairs|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: he was hoping on ops 3 nt|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mariner1: 5@H DBL on 18 was set 2 in Open Room so 5 imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: 16 the 1100 was 12 imps as 400 in 3N in Open Room|pg||
nt|eggy: my apologies - her|pg||
pc|h5|nt|april7: absolute top in pairs would have been 3@S X|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  he hoped right|pg||
nt|cicus: if declarer can be sure about the 4-4 heart break|pg||
nt|cicus: 5 club tricks sees him home|pg||
nt|yo_yo: which teams are in the other semi final, christian?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: Bamberger Reiter - Kondoch|pg||
nt|xenya: i would like to be in 3N here -- 25 hcp and a good long suit|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|stc: on @d 3-3, he may also guess @d|pg||
nt|stc: :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 3@s was on wrong side ,,,,,my fault on bid ,,,,, was bid by West to ask|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: sorry fellows|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|ady: thought that a possibility   thats why 5@C a decent effort|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello David|pg||
nt|april7: thats ok|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: some would transfer on the basxis that game might be on if there was a good fit  and north could break the transfer|pg||
pc|dK|nt|santyclz: Now we're legal.  You can't have a legal vg without a "Dave/David" commentating.|pg||
nt|ady: and 6@S  as a save  very little|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   not likely to be in bidding anyway|pg||
nt|stc: then the TOP|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: ugh this will be awful for EW|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we saw Bamberger yesterday giving a very strong performance|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sharkey: Top Bridge back into the lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - Narvik IMPs|pg||
nt|jbgood: a double disaster..|pg||
nt|ady: nice duck by north prevented entry  which mith be useful to west|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, precise defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: Felix former junior german master (actual) Maria ladies junior master|pg||
nt|mcphee: must dble 2@S to show @C or bid them directly which ever your methods permit|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|vugraphzqt: michael is thinking|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think North is closer to upgrading to 18 HCP than South is to inviting opposite 15-17|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: seems David is on way to Norway|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|stc: well done|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nigel_k:  Actually he can almost play double dummy now because North needs all the aces and kings for his double when he has two clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: he lost an unnecessary trick|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cash your @D and run|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: not so nice this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: right|pg||
nt|ady: unlikely west has KQ clubs on that play|pg||
nt|ady: play hearts   is best|pg||
nt|ady: can  get trump control|pg||
nt|ady: same contract OR      down 3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: I think south tht that opposite most 1NT openings game would not be on and with bad hearts  left in a likedly make of 1NT|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s4|nt|sybarra: surprise E didnt lead his lat ht when in |pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: not home et|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: yet|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: a nice suit pref signal there |pg||
nt|cicus: 5 top tricks |pg||
nt|mcphee: it seems 2@S was a negative free bid, or one of them forgot methods|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rnmalik: on board 17 instead 1@S mad a good bid 4@C|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h9|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|mariner1: so making 4 here|pg||

nt|roswolf: in fact all the tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: another partscore|pg||
nt|ahalim: i told you so :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|nickf: looks like a normal 3NT down 1 on a club lead|pg||
nt|rayhaa: I thk Kopstads 3@s just was indiciplined  :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|granguru: Brazil women entered this round (2 remaining) with 2 IMps ahead of Argentina|pg||
nt|levix: other table opened 1h|pg||
nt|rodal f: Here we might are at dynamit|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: Very aggressive 1@C, or rather, excessive|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: Ended slowly|pg||
nt|rodal f: By loosers. Only by loosers EW have 10|pg||
nt|rodal f: End for EW at 2@S|pg||
nt|nickf: not anymore though.|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: Lavazza is in 3NT next door NS, so here's a chance for a pickup for Buaijh|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: light 3rd seat opening -- may propel E-W to 4S, which I don't think they can make|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess north is trying to make something happen with that 1@C semi-psych opening|pg||
nt|Rafa: 500 people from the audience saying hi from here |pg||
nt|beto: i think he did|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: in @H best|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: I agree with 3D, looks like the cards are poorly placed.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well if he thought 2@S was right then 3@S is clearly wrong in view of the third seat opening|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: We beat that number Rafa, 800 in this room :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But hi back to all of you in Santiago|pg||
nt|kit: This is even less likely to make|pg||
nt|Rafa: :) but you can't make "the wave" as we are doing here|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C are 9 or 10 but 5 are down|pg||
nt|rayhaa: what is Norths RD, just showing a honor?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: We can try|pg||
nt|levix: luck to click out HQJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be all from 8 til 10|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive 9+|pg||
nt|levix: better to erect D suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: A lot of cards NS, but there end are low|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might 3NT was better|pg||
nt|garnetts: Probably |pg||
nt|garnetts: This looks like one off after the lead |pg||
nt|garnetts: unless a pass from east suggested defending 1@S I absolutely loath 2@D |pg||
nt|garnetts: I am sure it should show six|pg||
pc|h9|nt|othered1: I guess 11C did stir something up|pg||
nt|beto: har dto get to 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|othered1: !@C|pg||
nt|duschek: Also quite aggressive by East - 13 HCP with no intermediates, and any finesses but in hearts through the weak hand|pg||
nt|beto: agee ed|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Rafa: many kibs sent me this:         |pg||
pc|dA|nt|granguru: Chile has the highest gap in the whole match now 34 IMPs|pg||
nt|Rafa: nice wave!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: /////\\\\\\\\/////////////\\\\\\\\//////////\\\\\\\\\\\   thanks to HedyG|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why? Need a @S ruff|pg||
nt|rayhaa: yes def, strange pass to see what happens|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: top spade lead ok here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: oops |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|beto: the gap will narrow sson as argentina is in 3N board 6, same lead as this room|pg||
nt|duschek: They missed a game at board 6 - they are certainly not going to miss two in a row, may be their philosophy|pg||
nt|kit: looks like declarer is getting the spades right, but I don't think that will get to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: No. 4@H will run home|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahalim: yes but the @S 8 will then be a stopper|pg||
pc|c3|nt|beto: dont even to 8 kit|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: But best def are to do. Play trumh|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: true|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|beto: defence is in the right track|pg||
nt|kit: defense doing very well -- now may get 2 club tricks set up before ace of spades dislodged|pg||
pc|sA|nt|nickf: as a spectator points out, the key to the hand is to endplay East by leading a H to the 9 in the endgame|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|d5|pc|h6|pg||

nt|frankaus: yes |pg||

nt|sharkey: 30-1 Narvik this half|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: Board 8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: played quite well|pg||
nt|mariner1: nicely played|pg||
nt|mariner1: so I expect a swing to EW there|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: and so it was |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, well done|pg||
nt|ady: 11 top tricks for e/w       spades will be the 12th|pg||
nt|stc: 6NT on @s or @d 3-3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: gross bad bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: yes for just|pg||
nt|cicus: and a spade game now|pg||
nt|ady: gained 3 imps|pg||
nt|bridge_one: wd - 2 down is a good result for E/W|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Very thin four spades for N/S|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: as always there is no team to be close to them they are great although there are some big "mistakes" they made|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think South should be angry at North for not bidding the grand :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: he was afraid of 5/0 distribution of @sÂ´s ......Micheal smiled and said entch is a "chicken" :-)|pg||
nt|mcphee: i am sure they must be having a short chat about that now|pg||
nt|badjunior: gute aktion. 3 @H gehen einen down und der gegner macht 3 @C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: i guess south expected his partner to have more defence for the double|pg||
nt|sybarra: boring bd 7 so we skipped?  (just kidding) |pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: yes only good hands|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N the spot NS here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: preferably by North|pg||
nt|mariner1: makes a lot with no @H lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: now its gettinÂ´faster :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another part score|pg||
nt|mariner1: again part scores here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S has play here and so does 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: could see action here..........|pg||
nt|stc: 5@s was a very good save|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@S or 6NT:)|pg||
nt|april7: unfortunate 6@S by N, down 1|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they overbid  yes but unlucky the @D didnt run|pg||
nt|rnmalik: the computer:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: same problem in open will come with this hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: something went awry I am sure|pg||
mb|3C|nt|april7: sorry, again bad connection|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4@S probably makes so not so terrible|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: @S game here or NT|pg||
nt|hlortz: echo LOL|pg||
nt|mariner1: or a fizzle|pg||
nt|ady: should locate 6NT   |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes agree christian |pg||
nt|rnmalik: let us see|pg||
nt|yo_yo:  a quick 2@d overcall could have prevented it maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: dealer did a nice job great hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: u should be here *** it makes great fun|pg||
nt|mcphee: as 4@H fails it adds a possible chance to win some imps!|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Yes plus squeeze possibilities|pg||
nt|ady: seems  3NT from west can make|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: and a rousing 1 nt here |pg||
nt|mariner1: actually a @S lead from W is nice if S plays 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems both have 4 losers or more off top|pg||
nt|april7: but 6 @D are there|pg||
nt|april7: and 6NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: for great players to compete|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he's a bit weak for that double, dont you think rashed? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i know it's take out but even so..|pg||
nt|cicus: disciplined pass by N|pg||
nt|cicus: now some gadget|pg||
nt|ady: again a part score     seems 2@H  a possibe contract for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps north would have done better to win the first trick with the @SA|pg||
nt|athene: that might persuade declarer to finesse trumps|pg||
nt|cicus: this is a fit jump in my partnerships|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: here aswell fit jump + @c values|pg||
nt|cicus: and the same for them as well|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Over an artificial 1C, North should bid 3D not 1D|pg||
nt|ady: dont like double    what is wrong with showing hearts at this stage?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jbgood: they are going for Bronze medals now! |pg||
nt|athene: but since dummy doesn't have any entry, it's going to be hard|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will always be suspicious if you give him a club finesse he can't take himself|pg||
nt|athene: *sorry a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice choice Christian |pg||
nt|rnmalik: checks in both majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D inverted showing a limit raise or better|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: has to be careful in 4@S to not allow a @H ruff or trump promotion|pg||
nt|april7: should give up a @S and then hope for 3-3 in @D or @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: best is 6NT with @D finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 2@S better contract for NS|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S make 5@D here|pg||
nt|stc: but if dec tries @d first he may take 2 finesses in @s and go down ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you risk it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: impossible to bid Nigel|pg||
nt|xenya: unless N decides to open|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and this one is not easy |pg||
nt|ady: this looks like down 1 |pg||
nt|stc: On 17 my 6@h joke was reality and dec didn't guess @h and went down !!|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe double is necessary when that strong and other bids are limited|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: now will E risk a @H lead?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yep could get careless if @H lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but all is well |pg||
nt|yo_yo: would you open it?  I wouldnt|pg||
nt|mcphee: the 10@C will build up for a @H discard|pg||
nt|sybarra: all the aj holdings by e/w |pg||
nt|xenya: i don't quite follow E's sequence, but i;m sure they knew what they were doing|pg||
nt|mcphee: so making 3 will not be difficult here|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N might also have a chance here?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mariner1: can make 12 now|pg||
nt|ady: reasonable save   -300     5@D   makes n/s|pg||
nt|ady: east  could not really take any sessible action|pg||
nt|ady: go into the wrong spot|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzqt: !10 marks @h|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The heart suit on 17 is an unusual application of restricted choice|pg||
nt|ady: also if defence fails to switch to a club   a possible double squeeze|pg||
nt|stc: nobody will play 6NT with this hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: might have been better to winn in dummy and lead @C|pg||
nt|cicus: fit jump= trump support + a good suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|stc: lead not helping|pg||
nt|ady: can bid 2@H   after 1@D|pg||
nt|mcphee: this Q@S lead however may help Reps solve the trumps|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|vugraphzqt: after @c ace|pg||
nt|mariner1: now a @H and @H|pg||
nt|cicus: claiming soon|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|stc: % plays seems to be 2 times @D, then cash AK@s|pg||
nt|april7: I think the best play is AK of @S for either doubleton honour or 3-3|pg||
nt|eggy: all sorts of chances though, if NS don't switch to clubs|pg||
nt|stc: Yes but only after testing @d|pg||
nt|april7: no must be before|pg||
nt|eggy: I think a diamond to the K and then a spade to teh 9 looks natural|pg||
nt|motbocaj: You would perhaps normally do that but the 3rd @S could lose two tricks immediately to QJxx with @D's 33 or squeeze chance|pg||
nt|stc: N will never switch to @cs|pg||
nt|stc: You have all the time to test @d first|pg||
nt|stc: in this case, not if @d are 4-2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No but I might be close to bidding four if South opened 1D then raised spades|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  There is some hope of making this|pg||
nt|xenya: well 4@S close... |pg||
nt|ady: dont think it will make|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: will go for diamonds   but should lose 7 tricks   1 diamond 4 hearts and 2 black aces|pg||
nt|april7: but only because S shows out on second round|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s -1 is a normal result|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: W's discards call for the @H|pg||
nt|chick: I suspect that 2@D was pretty weak systemically, so 3@D could just be a bar bid|pg||
pc|h5|nt|april7: now its possible to be made4 discards !!!|pg||
nt|xenya: not me, but i know some people who would|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: re inverted minors, is 2N the best way to show a minimum balanced hand?  Or next suit? (Here, 1@d-2@d-2@H) |pg||
nt|stc: next|pg||
nt|april7: no problems anymore|pg||
nt|eggy: well that solves that problem then :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry Kaith lost connection|pg||
nt|ady: best to force dummy|pg||
nt|mcphee: and so it does for +1|pg||
pc|s4|nt|santyclz: But to do that you have to take a finesse rather than playing for the squeeze.|pg||
nt|mariner1: and a good duck|pg||
nt|ady: now no problem|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jbgood: a kib indicated that doubling to get 100 rather than 50 and paying out 670 is more Tapsbridge than Topbridge|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mariner1: or cards played rather|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2 is 2|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is a meaning of the word "discards" with which I was previously unacquainted.|pg||
nt|stc: INDEED !, why not ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no now the A@H has not been cashed N can play on @D. A hand holding 4@S and 4@D 6 is 6|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|stc: yes, I think the % play is to finesse|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Very complex hand|pg||
nt|cicus: e MAY DUCK THIS|pg||
nt|xenya: but N did well to overtake and win another trick|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: lol - gd point|pg||
pc|s5|nt|nigel_k:  Probably 3-3 spades is the best hope now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cicus: no|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: east has found a good lead    |pg||
pc|hA|nt|april7: interesting now, N can take the chance and finesse in @D|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yo_yo: EW need some imps !|pg||
nt|xenya: best perhaps is pitch @D now, cash @CAK and play for 3-3 @Ss|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no problems for 2@S|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|jbgood: Tapbridge = losing bridge|pg||
nt|april7: after cashing the @H a @S switch will beat the contract.N should have ducked @H twice, then N would have had a chance to make it|pg||
nt|mariner1: and 12 in the bank|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jbgood: and surely ment 200 for 100|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mcphee: next|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: making 4 on last board was worth an imp|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: east must keep a spade|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The takeout double may have helped declarer guess hearts here|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: I think can make  ruffing 4 hearts in hand  3 low and one with K@S   and finessing J@S      7 trump tricks  2 clubs and ace of hearts|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: oouch?|pg||

nt|rodal f: Def a bit bad there|pg||
nt|garnetts: It was true that NS could make 4@S with a 3-3 spade break and a 3-2 club break but they will never be able to bid|pg||
nt|rayhaa: good sac in 4@s, can push ns to 5@h|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 96 teams entered the Mixed Teams. They are divided into 16 groups of 6|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3C|an| |mb|p|nt|kit: Some might overall the 4-card suit here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am sure that EW will bid 4@S ---I had though East would pre-empt--I like 3@S but 2@S is OK |pg||
nt|Walddk7: The results are now starting to appear at http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/MixedRR.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Will be a fight bat level 2 I belive.|pg||
nt|rodal f: At 3 problems come in|pg||
mb|3D|nt|granguru: a 20-20 hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|levix: will N lead doubleton?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Pass is forcing |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nickf: Well next door bocchi had a chance in the endgame to make 3NT but he didnt make the winning play|pg||
nt|garnetts: It also suggests that North should bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: The overcall works well, as 1NT is cold and 2@S has chances|pg||
nt|othered1: good lead|pg||
nt|beto: yes, very nice leaf|pg||
nt|beto: lead|pg||
nt|granguru: he he|pg||
nt|granguru: avoids a @c ruff|pg||
nt|kit: West is 4-3-3-3 so isn't gettng ruffs, so why should he let anybody else get ruffs?|pg||
nt|rodal f: We already see the result but 12 might was hard|pg||
nt|rayhaa: lucky @d J10, so 5@h makes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Graded up the cards from 19 til a 20-21NT|pg||
nt|levix: it is ok with 5d |pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|levix: keep CK in dummy|pg||
nt|rodal f: K109xx make one point|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as KJ10XX fore shure do|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@D = a major 2@H=p/c|pg||
nt|Walddk7: This is a match from Group H|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|granguru: wise comment Kit|pg||
nt|levix: no overtrick with this lead|pg||
nt|nickf: easier when we see all 4 hands|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: declarer might still make by setting up hearts, discarding a club on third heart rather than ruffing it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: Well Lerfald. I missed at my quick analyce|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rodal f: Clasic one|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|garnetts: If that was a strong club and north showed 5-7 then pass is surely forcing--if it wasn't a strong club then South must act|pg||
pc|c6|nt|olerfald: small C now |pg||
nt|rodal f: How many tricks at 1NT?|pg||
nt|rodal f: It would have been the best Y|pg||
pc|s4|nt|granguru: but the menace of the @H establishment arises|pg||
pc|c3|nt|frankaus: looks to be -1 |pg||
nt|rodal f: Looks like a plaine one|pg||
nt|kenyan1: an imp away|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: U are a bit more concervatice at K109XX?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: but it looks like the force in clubs will get him anyway|pg||
pc|d6|nt|beto: maybe more|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will lead a heart and pitch a club|pg||
nt|beto: he will only get 3 more tricks now|pg||
nt|frankaus: started and finished with 6 top tricks|pg||
nt|kit: then opponents play on clubs, he ruffs, crosses to dummy, and plays another heart pitching diamond|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: West ruffs, but must break diamonds, so down 1 I believe|pg||
nt|rodal f: Mir mad a small egg there but hard to see|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|granguru: down 2|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|mariner1: EW in a tough 3N here and probably set|pg||
nt|mariner1: and defense does its best|pg||
nt|mariner1: another part score hand... NS could get too high|pg||
nt|rnmalik: swing board |pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 of either major here NS|pg||
nt|mariner1: ew can make 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I would take a spade finesse through South just because North is less likely to play back a club|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very lucky some questions would be put to E by the team|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now an interesting hand for you rashed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: have you ever been dealt such a hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: short break.... 2min|pg||
nt|cicus: again, easy game NS|pg||
nt|cicus: the problem here is to stay at the 4 level|pg||
nt|cicus: although 5 can be made with the @SK in place|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: Kondoch went for little tigers back in 2 min|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have nice fitting cards|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Sorry too slow he already lost it|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A wild one!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and indeed bd 17 was a push  -1 |pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: I think it has the same origin as this club - not 100 % sure though|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes   i have  but usually not to gain the hand|pg||
nt|chick: On board 17, everyone here seemed to think that W should have blasted to 4@H.  I think he showed excellent discipline by bidding only 3.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: would you pass the North hand? |pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: now ace+ Q is great in @S|pg||
nt|ady: can make 9 tricks in either major|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but E/W can make 4 in both minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 11-13|pg||
nt|bridge_one: weak N/T for E/W|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: well there is also a possibility of EW making the phantom save|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, easy to get to 3@hs.|pg||
nt|hlortz: the best sort of save over 4 of a major - one that makes!|pg||
nt|mariner1: very true|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D Ekrens here?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Then if South turns up with four spades you have a squeeze|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H lead 6@C on otherwise 5@C max|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 2@C both majors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i am curious to see wich gadgets play E/W versus the landy|pg||
nt|ady: yes   both sides fit well this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: to make 3N on a small @S lead you have to refuse to win the 1st @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: N can DBL or bid 3@H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@C not a bad contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C is fine, 5@C too many|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H is ok,,,,,, 4@H too many|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: both major 5+/4+ preemtive|pg||
nt|mariner1: I sure would have to have to pass with W here over a 2@D showing both majors|pg||
nt|hlortz: cautious pass by W|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N plays better than 4@H|pg||
nt|april7: 6@S by EW but only 2 down for NS in 6@D|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Only if North has the four spades and plays back a diamond you have a problem|pg||
nt|april7: lucky but good play by N|pg||
nt|stc: Nonsense, he would have take the chance anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: ....its time to lose their first game in tournament ....against great ops|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is it not ;6 on any lead?|pg||
nt|ady: i dont think e/w  will copete to the 4 level|pg||
nt|ady: compete|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: @S lead would also help-the question is would we bid it-I might|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I thought that one might take longer :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: transfer auf 1 NT|pg||
nt|mcphee: 1@S likely shows 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: if I were N I would DBL 3@C if takeout|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s by E not by W|pg||
nt|april7: it doesn't matter after Q of @S play in hand  8|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 10 or 11 tricks  in spades   depending if a heart ruff is found      n/s  can save effictively in 5@D|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: declarer may duck a diamond to the @DQ|pg||
nt|eamongall: specs are telling me still active ... I know its probably still there ...was doing some advertising |pg||
nt|mariner1: and then need careful play|pg||
nt|santyclz: And 2@h is the limit for n-s.|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 5-10 points (opener)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H should make though|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@H guessing the Q@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: never know:) It is an interesting game:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: you look very silly when 3@D was off a 5-card suit, but you gain a tempo in many other lines|pg||
nt|athene: even though it gives a trick away|pg||
nt|sharkey: that didnt hurt....|pg||
nt|eamongall: Nobody ever understands by negative advertising (like negative psychology) |pg||
nt|eamongall: sorry my neg etc |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C= check back or new minor |pg||
nt|sybarra: or ??|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or take 500....|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the "limit" can be pushed because NS are WHITE and 3@C makes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: np for 3@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS still being very timid to me|pg||
nt|santyclz: Right, I meant the limit of making.|pg||
nt|stc: is 2@d forcing or not ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: now its forcing .....alerted as 2 ways|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Unless it is game forcing, this would be a good time for North to pass|pg||
nt|stc: then they may overbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: but no Gameforce ....|pg||
nt|stc: Does 6@s by E make on @d and @d ?|pg||
nt|eggy: er what about the two missing aces?|pg||
nt|motbocaj: Hard to make then with the A trumps still out :)|pg||
nt|stc: I mean 5@s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wouldnt have doubled with that  9 card suiter |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Anything above 4S by E/W will be too much|pg||
nt|xenya: i hope we have been denied the treat only temporarily|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: wrong hand loaded ....well see it later|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is getting a bit skinny now for the second dble|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: e/w  now too high   have problems even without the heart ruff|pg||
nt|cicus: a club lead may threaten even 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: re-double shows 3-3 in majors    sometimes landy is 5-4 in majors|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: will have to duck the first @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: can EW find their game?|pg||
nt|hlortz: rob did u mean *hate* to have to pass??|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes type ,, hate to have to|pg||
nt|mariner1: typo|pg||
nt|april7: yes sorry, but 6 @D still good sAVE|pg||
pc|h5|nt|santyclz: On a good day 3@h would make.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Chickened out :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: i thought so... I would HATE to have to pass also|pg||
nt|mariner1: I sure would hate to have to pass with W here over a 2@D showing both majors|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   looks the best game     but might go down if misguessing the Q@D |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 6@D does have play|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 30 min left for 4 hands ...they are back in time|pg||
nt|stc: well done to stop|pg||
nt|stc: Reps cached the A@H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: obvious play:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Another thin game|pg||
nt|ady: too thin|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: east needs to avoid a spade lead|pg||
nt|ady: if north plays 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: @d lead not picnic either is it |pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  has a play     the J@D  is well palced|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this might draw fire|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@D is like 4@H - need to find the Q in @d|pg||
nt|ady: doubt get near 6@D as they lay|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D is not automatic though|pg||
nt|eggy: not against 5S -1 surely|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S DBL is to play-4NT does not deny @Hs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a swing to Ludewig as predicted on board 6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North wont be happy .....yet|pg||
nt|cicus: if declarer pulls trumps he may lose 3 spades|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Looks like 3NT would make but 5D will be difficult|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Can east resist?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: but north goes with the standard modern expert practice of leading an unexpected suit and hoping to strike gold|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes DBL looked right here|pg||
nt|stc: Even 7@d good save as long as EW cam make something :)|pg||
nt|ady: K@H    bad value|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may play South to have both aces|pg||
nt|mariner1: ok now see how he does trick 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: the 2@S bid might led E to think A@D is in S since there is little else for him to hold|pg||
nt|rnmalik: in that case S would have bid 2@S on 1NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: play the 9 JIC|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes well judged with a misfit and dangerous heart situation|pg||
nt|eggy: can't even make 4S by West :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: you mentioned something about 6 pl don't forget it:)|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  have bought it cheaply|pg||
nt|ady: 3 in danger|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, KH and QC not worth much|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile Reiter have built up a useful lead on the first 4 deals|pg||
nt|xenya: well he does have a strong NT with both majors|pg||
nt|mcphee: being non vul helps|pg||
nt|xenya: that too|pg||
nt|chick: in standard, ns's auction would go 1@C X 1N P P ... so with 16 HCP, W may well X again, so same in this auction|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: he did strike gold, but it wasn't his side's gold|pg||
nt|ady: I think 4@H  more chance than 6 diamonds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, 4@H made with @H 3/2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only with @h 4/1 have the same %|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok|pg||
nt|cicus: not on this layout, though|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: diamond lead and spade return would damage 3NT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: on the basis of best defence north has chosen well|pg||
nt|mariner1: making 5@C is all in the @c play|pg||
nt|hlortz: W should get @C right on the auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would Chinese hook the @c, lead the Q@C|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: are you saying 6 goes down, where is my money?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no way:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: cold now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: didnt you bet me ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: you lost it :):)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sharkey: Top Bridge struggling now|pg||
nt|ady: they are in a very good contract    will be unlucky to fail|pg||
nt|ady: may get diamond wrong when south shows up with singleton heart|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the concentrations of honors in @C is unlucky, after @H 4/1 ... and also the possibility to play the finesse in @D in both directions|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it is a dangerous hand, bec declarer will know the short in @D in North, so probably he will play the finesse in bad direction|pg||
nt|motbocaj: tough enough to make 4S on AK@D I would think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: do not want to lose to J@C stiff in S|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: welcome back server problems .....i give the rusult ....cant play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: how say joaqin, he could choise also to play a squeeze against South @D/@S, making the contract - the communications are sufficient|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: woe|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but W's choice has proved to be more flexible here|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: wasnt it always cold, what am i missing?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: K@H pl|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: cold from begin|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now or never - no entry love:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think you owe me and Christian a few bob Rashed   |pg||
nt|yo_yo: he can ruff @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Needs to cash AC to avoid being endplayed with it later|pg||
nt|ady: if K@H were K@D    it would be a fair game   generally I think east optimistic trying for a game    though good shape needs too many right cards|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jbgood: I guess they feel that the title may be slipping away..|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If declarer gets the diamond by West he may not be any better off|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Possibly just playing on trumps and then diamonds would have been easier|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you hated to admit that :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: unfortunately is 10 of @D natural lead and not Lavinthal|pg||
nt|cicus: best return hoping for a trump trick by partner|pg||
pc|s6|nt|stc: Why, S doesn't need to ruff a @h|pg||
nt|motbocaj: 5@S I mean'|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well done|pg||
nt|xenya: so far|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ady: the 5 club can bed set up   but that is not enough with spade finesse wrong|pg||
nt|rnmalik: next pl badly played|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzqt: trumppromotion now if king and @c back|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer can discard a diamond and another on KH|pg||
nt|ady: yes    but diamond trick will disappear|pg||
nt|ady: you got there first Nigel|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  South remaining on lead is not necessarily better though|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: not feeling too good|pg||
nt|eamongall: Most things that attempt tp part a bridge player from his/her money struggle .. some bridge players moan if you rob their contract |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Cannot be made now|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  oops|pg||
nt|xenya: now it can|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Surelly a low spade or trump exit was correct there|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: yes low spade best option|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Not sure but I think it is still one down|pg||
nt|xenya: surely W was marked with 2 clubs -- he had passed 4@CX|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jbgood: and of course they are tired - playing foorhanded for four days|pg||
nt|sybarra: am told declarer quickly played @d from dummy in OR, on 3rd trick|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Hedy |pg||
nt|ady: need to finnese spade and ruff a spade   and play for jack of diamonds rt     not an easy hand|pg||
nt|stc: overtrick now|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Fortunately for declarer he has found a second entry to set up diamonds and cash them|pg||
nt|rnmalik: last board pl|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: my way :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c2|nt|sharkey: 224 boards in 4 days is a lot|pg||
nt|athene: a very heavy 2nt overcall in the other room|pg||
nt|jbgood: right now Narvik is in the 20-10 area'|pg||
nt|sybarra: may have lost the timing now to do everything |pg||
nt|mariner1: and there it is|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hlortz: w was listening to u Rob|pg||
nt|eggy: looks like -2 for sure now|pg||
nt|chick: true, Vlad.  just saying that W should push another time in either case :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: no flies getting that @C trick|pg||
nt|xenya: had he overcalled 1N N would have doubled and that might have ended the auction|pg||
nt|mcphee: no might about the dble :|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|ady: dont think this will make     Gotard may fall further behind|pg||
nt|ady: not a bad  line    just fails this time|pg||
nt|ady: needed the spade finesse rather than the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: E thinking|pg||
nt|eggy: maybe -3|pg||
nt|april7: ace of trumps must make a trick!!!:)|pg||
nt|eggy: club now|pg||
nt|stc: lucky to escape X|pg||
nt|motbocaj: or a @D|pg||
nt|ady: south could not bid after 2@D   just know of 3-3 in majors     needed good fitting cards|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|eggy: or a diamond I think|pg||
nt|motbocaj: claim is best line!|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  He does always have the rest|pg||
nt|eggy: that didn't look right did it?|pg||
nt|motbocaj: How on a @D return?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Ruff, pitch a club, heart to queen, club to king, two more hearts|pg||
nt|motbocaj: OK|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: TL was called on a undefined claim just a second|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: no result yet for this ,,,,TL is discussing|pg||

nt|roswolf: 10 board matches|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|beto: 3N by ns, down on a @S lead|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|beto: 1N - 3N|pg||
mb|r|nt|duschek: Tough hand - seems 5@D is on a finesse (and diamonds 3-2)|pg||
nt|nickf: this hand is a bit more complex. East makes a lot of clubs, but how many ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: East should double for take out|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|beto: 1N 2@C 2@D 3N|pg||
nt|nickf: 12 if Mme Lavazza guesses clubs.|pg||
nt|garnetts: double is much more flexible than 3@D |pg||
nt|rayhaa: good x, can they stop in 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|duccino: Board 1 was deleted and they played a brand new one. So results of board 11 are correct but the cards are not|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: but what NS are doing is anyone's guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: I dont think duboin will drive this to slam tho|pg||
mb|3D|nt|duschek: No alternative to the spade lead, so this hand is over quickly|pg||
nt|kit: Pretty hard to stay out of 3NT, even if N-S had methods where North could show his shape|pg||
nt|beto: agree kit|pg||
nt|kit: East will play 9 at trick 1, and b shocked when it holds|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: there's too much duplication in hearts for starters.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: on normal play this is either -1 or2 but the defence have to be careful|pg||
nt|ahalim: N will have a fir when he finds out that the K was single :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|nickf: the Irish have stopped in 5C next door|pg||
nt|nickf: the status of 3D is probably unclear ot Duboin|pg||
nt|nickf: if it was a stopper ask, he didnt have it.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|nickf: and why did East open 1C ahead of 1D, anyway ?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: every reason to be in 4@H after that start lol|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|nickf: huh - she raised herself to 6. Hope she makes it now.|pg||
nt|nickf: however had stayed in game, and made, that was worth 12 imps anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: they made the lead from the wrong side|pg||
pc|d6|nt|granguru: 4@H might have had a chance|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphztg: the lead was 4@h|pg||
nt|nickf: lead from the wrong side?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahalim: sry fit i meant|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|duschek: Argentina were 1 down in 4@S where Robles/Pacareu bid agressively to 3NT, so that was 3 imps to Argentina, still trailing by 22Â½|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|kit: diamond discards speed things up|pg||
pc|dA|nt|duschek: Here the Argentinians must hope for a push|pg||

nt|rnmalik: BRAVO|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so well done again Bamberger team|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   getting a good lead|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  No and to give East credit, he did well in the bidding|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You're right David, well spotted|pg||
nt|mcphee: 5@C going off 2 proves to lose just the 3 extra imps|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: 3N has good play EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: last  three for today|pg||
nt|xenya: oh i don't know -- if you believe E's bidding, you can count his hand -- 7 spades and 5 clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: he will run out of @S in hand on that line, David |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzqt: :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|mariner1: might see N bid 2@C and pass 2@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: W will call though|pg||
nt|mariner1: another slam chance NS|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh dear 13 out on the 3NTX|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: thats what I said ...Kirmse was praying for it *** :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: makeable contract and well done and safely played and I have won something:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: 6+ can have 4 card major|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: east played 2NT  OR   +1    seems n/s have 6 winners|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators Avrim (who had to leave) and David.   We appreciate your time and insights.  Always a fun discussion.|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|sybarra: Our appreciation to the German Bridge Federation  for bringing this event to BBO.  |pg||
nt|sybarra: And to our specs,-- greatest audience in the world.  We appreciate you comments and thoughts. @H@H |pg||
nt|santyclz: That may slow north down.|pg||
nt|mariner1: N was not in a hurry anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: would not be totally surprising for this to be passed out|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6 can be beat|pg||
nt|april7: oldfashioned X|pg||
nt|april7: or is it DONT?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: noooooo   you lost!|pg||
nt|cicus: EW 4@D is the limit of this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzqt: up till now disaster for Team "ludewig" they tried hard to avoid that|pg||
nt|mcphee: nd here comes N|pg||
nt|mcphee: must be some bid to show this hand N|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 nt?  dbl  |pg||
nt|xenya: ah now i'm beginning to understand EW's auction on 20 -- 1@D is nebulous, 2@D was constructive, 3@D support|pg||
nt|chick: or 2@H ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or just 2 @H  or 1 nt|pg||
nt|chick: 1N if they are playing Sandwich would be great|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: my partners have a habit of bidding 2@H over 2@C :)|pg||
nt|ady: is not double a 1 suited hand in dont?|pg||
nt|mcphee: or, if all those bids are not within the system notes, the hitch and hesitate should help|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jbgood: thy have not been able to put up the concentration needed to avoid some big swings in this round|pg||
nt|sharkey: Only 9 boards completed in CR - 13 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: his holding is pitifully short of winners|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dbl is aggressive|pg||
nt|mariner1: W is not passing 1@H DBL :)|pg||
nt|chick: lol|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: robust action from west|pg||
nt|sybarra: no no wasted values in e/w hand |pg||
nt|ady: has led to a good contract    on a finesse   and worthy of a game swing|pg||
nt|sybarra: N has  big hand |pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't understand why East has to double|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@D are ON with finese in @S and squeeze @S/@H in the end|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers suggesting @S @H squeeze vs W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this means that isn't a good slam to call :)|pg||
nt|stc: Blood ?|pg||
nt|april7: 1@S by W and 2@C Drury by E?or 1NT and 2 @C by Eor 2@D transfer? and then 3NT and 4@H by W|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now likely 4@S|pg||
nt|april7: so E  might pass , but better 4@H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: If winning is losing I accept:)|pg||
nt|cicus: I don't think S has enough for this 2nd double|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3@C puppet stayman, looking for a 5 card major from W|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s have mirror shaep    but should make 4@H   unless going wrong in the trump suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D is precision - 11/15 no 5 cards in major|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: now 3N by W|pg||
nt|mariner1: could W be thinking @c slam?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Getting the normal @s lead, since they bid @hs and @ds.|pg||
nt|stc: probably -1|pg||
nt|stc: Pass not good, E knows that they are both short in @c|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's all in black and white|pg||
nt|mcphee: and now, N is out of it|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: too big    means e/w  will make|pg||
nt|motbocaj: Is must have been strong if North bid 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: may make   dropping Q@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: he cannot pass this bid it will not make|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jbgood: no info about the other matches - just half time results|pg||
nt|sharkey: Narvik have played very well this half and exerted a lot of pressure on Top Bridge|pg||
nt|april7: I am back. 3 @S is probably for the minors and 5@C was a good decision because 3NT fails as we can see. If you bid well you are also lucky, K of @C is finessable|pg||
nt|sybarra: we shall see if E can make this |pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S confirms the 5@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now i think they should be in 3NT here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|nigel_k:  5C is a decent contract here but not 3NT|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mariner1: duck 1st @S best play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: minor suit Staymen and here we are playing 3@Cs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 5@C ok too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt is very dangerous|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Unfortunately clubs don't break|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@HX E on 19 -- 14 imps to the trailing team|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jbgood: so we will go to the closed room after we have finished here, and watch the exciting finish|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sorry, was thinking w was declarer.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well that is a very red @S :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: fourth highest of dummy's longest and strongest|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would it matter if W had 4?|pg||
nt|mariner1: so a violation of Burn's Law (Rules) here|pg||
nt|ady: bad contract    this should be more imps for e/w|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East lead, not easy withn this auction the lead @D|pg||
nt|ady: have to hope no diamond lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with Kxxx|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mariner1: swich to the 9 @D easy enough|pg||
nt|mariner1: swish|pg||
nt|santyclz: Which black suit should s lead?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: to me E was looking for 4/4 @H fit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E is slightly under pressure. It happens all round|pg||
nt|cicus: I think E will ruff a club before trying to guess trumps|pg||
nt|ady: let of the hook|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is going to fail|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: Shudn't make - but....|pg||
nt|mariner1: well so now its a psuedo|pg||
nt|ady: need  to play in a careful order    must knock out A@C   early   |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mariner1: now W can hook the @c too since he has the transportation|pg||
nt|stc: what are you talking about ?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|april7: ruf @S and @H|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ady: normal to double finesse hearts|pg||
nt|ady: and is doing so|pg||
nt|bridge_one: QJ9 is unlucky ! with QJ7 probably the lead would be @D|pg||
nt|ady: yes    the diamonds dont look great|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Declarer choose to move the @H in ortodox way|pg||
nt|ady: the expected 4@h OR    will only cost 1 imp|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good auction|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzqt: 2 imps back to bamberg|pg||
nt|cicus: then hope @SK is well placed|pg||
pc|c8|nt|stc: On 19 declarer went down in 5 @c...|pg||

nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|chick: not so sure yet|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|stc: two more to play|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like a make to me|pg||
nt|xenya: pitching 2 heart losers on @Ds|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nigel_k:  They knew spades were a problem and not enough tricks with only one stopper|pg||
nt|mcphee: the @H are going away on the @D|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mariner1: never play in a contract where the opponents have more trumps than your side|pg||
nt|ady: in fact   should make 4 now|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the trouble with Ax in the @C suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes but E does not know and W cannot push after Stayman|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|eggy: good effort so far|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think he should drop QC if he finds out about QH|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cicus: small spade now |pg||
pc|h3|nt|nigel_k:  Now ruff one diamond, draw trumps and cl.. |pg||
pc|h2|pg||

pc|hA|pc|c9|nt|eamongall: I am after missing something ..I see 6@S-4 |pg||

nt|ahalim: right but how high will they gp ?|pg||
nt|ahalim: sry go|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the 5 level is safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: it isn't like 3NT is the worst contract ever been in last hand -- sometimes spades are 4-4, sometimes they don't find the spade lead when 3-card holding is on lead|pg||
nt|granguru: 1@D=4+@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west will relay with 1s|pg||
nt|ahalim: just :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: amusing look to the auction|pg||
nt|ahalim: did Liz really bid 5@D ?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk7: as choose a major I presume, showing equal length|pg||
nt|roswolf: logical explanation|pg||
nt|ahalim: right|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 4@D showed both majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: west will have to decide whether to sac at some level|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: good morning Silvia|pg||

nt|duschek: The normal contract, but stone dead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or not guess this time he did not care|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: practicality won out|pg||
nt|ady: clubs 3-3  would be 12 tricks|pg||
nt|rayhaa: is that correct opening?|pg||
nt|roswolf: more or less the par spot|pg||
pc|s8|nt|garnetts: Not in my view :)|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: director was called|pg||
nt|rayhaa: strange defence too|pg||
nt|garnetts: Does anyone know?  |pg||
nt|garnetts: Nicked a trick with the 8@C --which is odd too--|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: director on the table|pg||
