nt|Walddk2: must live with 1-½-0 on the scoreboard. I am sure you can figure it out regardless|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: South was close to a bid, but he reckons that partner is still there.  |pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The inaugural event in 2006 in Ireland was won by USA, but Europe equalised two years later in Kentucky, USA|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you bid with S's hand David?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: It is close, but not really satisfactory to be shut out.|pg||
nt|hedyg: punish your pd for his t/o double?|pg||
nt|stigw: This needs a superdefence to best 3 nt, but very difficult to bid it.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Did he not want you to bid?!|pg||
nt|hedyg: if i had something, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzrd: S was not pausing|pg||
nt|brolucius: Nothing wrong with 2@H.|pg||

mb|2H|nt|jcwla: The competing teams, from Europe and the United States, consist of 12 players each and include one Womens pair and five Open pairs.|pg||

nt|jcwla: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||

nt|jcwla: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D is constructive|pg||
nt|jcwla: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
nt|jcwla: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared.  Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: note South's response on a 1-count |pg||
nt|jcwla: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, we will have the Individual. Each player has drawn a player from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared. Each player partners each of the other eleven ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: players on their team for a short set (6 boards) against various partnerships from the other team.  Each team has agreed on a standard convention card for this event.|pg||
nt|sybarra: need your guessing shoes on in either contract however |pg||
nt|mrdct: now the challenge is to hold this to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1@H and 3@C to lose here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jcwla: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|jcwla: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: but they do have to cash the first 4 :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: Just because East has denied four spades is no reason why West should not describe her hand. Here it leads to +460 and a win on the board.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: missing a pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: East 2@H|pg||
mb|3N|nt|stigw: Good European result from the closed room once more.|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: When there are only around 2 tricks to be lost it is risky playing in a 5-3 major-suit fit and perhaps picking up 650 instead of 660.|pg||

nt|andyv:  hi Venky|pg||
nt|rv: Hi all, warm welcome from Bangalore in South India|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: no not a board a match - over 11 boards each pair is competing gainst a specific pair from the other team|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont know who is playing weak NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Fantoni-Nunes, I think |pg||
mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: I knew :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks almost easier than 4 @S actually |pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrdct: helpful lead|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 660 next hand :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: 28-20 i heard|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Andy, Roland and all specs, 2 great pairs playing here, what more can I a bridge lover ask for:)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcwla: With all that said, hi Mike.  Looks like a very good result for Europe on Board 1.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you need the 1NT in "sandwich" position to be natural against this EW pair. They open and respond very light. |pg||
nt|daman: weak Smolen|pg||
nt|sybarra: at imps you might be in 4 @S |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Jordan|pg||
nt|mdgraham: On the last board, East may be weak with a long suit. Lebensohl comes in handy (2NT puppets 3@C, then you can bid your long suit). A diretc bid shows reasonable values.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psridhar: Brogeland seq asks for pd to pick a 2 level major nf|pg||
pc|s4|nt|daman: @C tap right away|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: So West wasn't flying solo when he bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|psridhar: that attacking lead will tap decl trumps, but decl may not mind scoring his little trumps in a dummy reversal manner|pg||
nt|daman: West has to get the @Ss moving|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bigtrain: always 11 tricks available in @S...  @C lead holds 3N to 10|pg||
pc|hA|nt|odysseus69: looks like 8 tricks i|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, S passed the 1@S opening and EW ended in 3@C.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: so the "secret" so far is lead clubs agst. nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt many would lead clubs from Jxxx|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bigtrain: better lead than from Axxx imo|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|bigtrain: tempo seems to dictate a @C lead is best|pg||
mc|11|nt|xenya: 2-2 @D and @CK in the S hand allow 11 tricks it seems|pg||

mb|2C|nt|brolucius: 1@C would show 14+ for North.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: 2@c= (9)10-13, unbalanced|pg||
nt|brolucius: All one-of-a-suit bids show 14+ for North-South. An amazing system, but it seems to work!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: difficult bid for Nunes, 3@s can be too high already|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|stigw: 4 cl N/S is the par contract I think, but will you land there, or can E-W sacrifce proftably ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni has some nice defensive values|pg||
nt|hedyg: check out a @d lead..|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s X -3?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S looks right on the West cards - but, of course, bidding is not a precise science.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|brolucius: The tempo of the auction was altered by it starting at the two-level. After 1@C - (1@S) - 2@S, you would not expect E/W to end in 4@S. |pg||
nt|brolucius: This line-up would grace a Bermuda Bowl final.|pg||

nt|sybarra: bd 15,  Hamman and Zia in 5 @D |pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: possible auction here -  3NT-6@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, same start to the auction, but Brogeland did not move over N's 1NT, so a win to USA there.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D = 2+ 10-15 or so... many shapes possible|pg||
mb|1N|nt|daman: goodish is a new word to me|pg||
nt|rv: for this match Zia, Hamman and Meckwell are for US, German Ladies, Fantunes for Europe|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|mrdct: NS can make 4@c i think|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Rodwell will like this 3@C bid :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|odysseus69: sure to make 6D - but can they get there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has a huge hand now after the 3@D jump |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and not bid grand|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rv: this seems to be par contract|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 4,5@C?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@S likely a fragment-style bid, as South did not bid 1@S over 1@H |pg||
nt|daman: Some pairs play DOPI for controls over opposition to their 2@C opening|pg||
nt|daman: he might get squeezed if he doesn't take his 2@Hs|pg||
nt|daman: but there is the issue of transportation|pg||
nt|daman: and N can hold the @Ss|pg||
nt|psridhar: decl has 10 top tricks and will need to play h to get his 11th|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: very well done by NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: I always have problems finding my .5 card |pg||
nt|mrdct: optimal spot for NS|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rmb1: 3@S is just showing a stop (of sorts) for 3NT,  Does not know North is making slam tries.|pg||
nt|daman: if East had AK10 of @S there would be a shot  |pg||
pc|s3|nt|psridhar: now decl is a tempo behind -likely only 430|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: inpite of big @c fit, @hQ is offside and 9 tricks are limit here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no 1@S overcall - mildly surprising|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5@C is not a bad contract (it is with the @CK ofside:))|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psridhar: cl are 5-0|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Interesting now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|odysseus69: few undos to correct|pg||
nt|lml: what is the max tricks possible?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: does now....|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Teams, Pairs and Individual events in Wareen Buffet Cup, every event is scored on BAM style, so OTs and UTs are very important|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|xenya: i think he can make 11 now|pg||
nt|lml: 5 i think after that good guess|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a @D and a @S|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|odysseus69: club lead still not good enough|pg||
nt|rmb1: In a less confident partnership, South would have let North play in hearts by now :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not content with 6@D at pairs. But a club lead may be interesting  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to make after the take out double|pg||
nt|odysseus69: west will be thrown in to concede 2 spade tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess there is a strip squeeze on a club lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: also could duck and squeeze as long as he reads distribution-not a problem either way |pg||
nt|xenya: now he has to get @H right as well|pg||
nt|rv: much needed board for Europeans |pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: the t/o double places virtually all the high cards - just room for East to hold @SJ perhaps|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Sabine Auken needs to play a @D now|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|brolucius: North bid 3@S at the other table and South passed (quite rightly).|pg||
nt|hedyg: you might expect pd to have more than he has and better @ss too|pg||
nt|brolucius: South cannot count anything for his doubleton heart because North is surely short in hearts as well, after the raise. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes indeed, but this is basically matchpoints, so it's normally wrong to chase thin games|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S does not promise much when one of the defenders comes in over 2@H - 3@H. Someone has to bid the combined values.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree with David|pg||
nt|stigw: Zias raise to 3 H had a provocative effect on the opps.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H was off 1|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe one does not always have to bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not saying that 4@S can't be right, but I also think one should show some restraint with this format, not least when you have as many slow values as Nunes as|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *has|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lack of aces and kings|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think both NS and S have difficult decisions here|pg||
nt|stigw: May be he can hold it to down 2 only, to safe ½ a point.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Suppose the bidding had gone 3@H - Pass - Pass - 3@S. You would not consider a raise to 4@S. And this is a similar auction.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meckwell are known as aggressive bidders, so when even Rod passed I think it's fair to say that 4@S was an overbid|pg||
nt|hedyg: give N the K@s instead of a small @c, would he not bid the same?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but the format matters|pg||
nt|brolucius: Over pre-emption you often bid on the assumption that your partner will hold around 8 points. So, North has to bid 4@S at some stage, rather than rely on partner to raise on 8 ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: points and no particular fit. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would understand 4@S red at IMPs|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure it does, i just mean the decision is not easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bridge is a difficult game; one should try to learn it some day :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I think it is very easy and completely clear-cut. North's 3@S is a form of protection. He would bid more with the @SK and a six-card suit, since he needs only a card or two ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: elsewhere to make game.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This defence will force declarer to bang down tha @sA and limit his trump losers to 2 only, says Murat Molva. He could be right|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, as Roland pointed out, you cannot bid 4@S because 15% of the time you can make it (when playing matchpoints). That will give you a bad board the other 85% of the time.|pg||
nt|hedyg: AKJ9xx xx Ax Kxx you would bid 4@s directly over 3@H?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Don't give partner the ideal hand, Hedy. He never has those cards as we all know|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is no point quoting hands in the 15% region. I can provide plenty of hands in the 85%  region, including the one that North actually holds.|pg||

nt|psridhar: 3nt wont play well on a h lead; 5c has chances|pg||
nt|diumraid: Current in running scores for the Buffett Cup USA 28 EUR 20. To win a continent needs to obtain 100 points. We are in Ruuning in Round 4 of 5 today.|pg||
nt|drewsky: simply a prepared bid in case the enemy calls 4@S, |pg||
nt|andyv:  at least S will find a couple of useful Jacks in N's hand|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 1@D = 0-7 any shape|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Too strong to overcall 1@S?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrdct: with NS playing precision there will be a delay in them finding their @d fit|pg||
mb|d|nt|psridhar: a prempt with an ace and a king on thee side and trump suit headed by jack may seem abnormal, but is often effective|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 1@H = 4+ forcing, might have a longer minor|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: this hand might take a while|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Duck the first trick and @H towards the @H9 looks best|pg||
nt|mrdct: east will be keen to score a trick with the @s2 and may try to duck a @c and then play !A and try to ruff one in her hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: the better plan may be to fire @ds back at the defence|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcwla: This is the type of board where "or it makes or it doesn't" -- E's actions really surprising.|pg||

pc|s7|nt|odysseus69: no problems here with 2 out of 3 finesses right and no bad breaks|pg||

pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: no, with AKQJ seventh and a raise, it's not a bad idea to just bid game |pg||

nt|brolucius: "And enjoy it when the commentators make a mistake," a kibitzer tells me. How cruel.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: When you play 2@C for majors and 2@d to ask for the longer one, you can play the delayed 2@S as being a bit more encouraging than an immediate 2@S. |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Zia regrets doubling 2@d, would rather be in 3@C undoubled|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: He might make it now|pg||
nt|stigw: He has shown 4 di and 5 Cl, I think - else he would have followed with 2 nt over 2 sp for the minors.|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|stigw: Dont believe it, even after this promissing start.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3 spades, two hearts, two heart ruffs and two top diamonds = nine tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: but might need to keep a spade entry for the last heart ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, he needed that extra trick in spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would also lead a spade I must confess|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When you have trump length it is often right to lead from your long side suit|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I think he mistimed it now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe I am wrong|pg||
nt|brolucius: When you have five, declarer cannot draw trumps and may be able to score his trumps separately.|pg||
nt|petergill: I would have led a heart, partner's five card suit on the bidding|pg||
nt|stigw: You might have a point, that he could have made 3 di at that point.|pg||
nt|petergill: Best to cash the clubs now|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer reasonably enough was playing the doubler for the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They don't have the hand records. So much easier for us|pg||
nt|stigw: Has Nunes showed a doubleton cl by now, I wonder ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Their card says 'low = even on declarer's leads'.|pg||
nt|petergill: @C4 was Reverse Smith, saying he doesn't like spades |pg||
nt|petergill: but it's hard for North to read that @C4 was a high club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni is known as a very careful (some call it 'slow') player, but he almost always comes out of the tank with the right answers|pg||
nt|petergill: they play Reverse Smith against both trump and no trump contracts, David|pg||
nt|brolucius: Certainly worth thinking on this contract - although some would say that all boards are equal at matchpoints.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter Gill and Fantoni would never be able to finish a session if they were partners :)|pg||
nt|petergill: North does not have the club count, and might well think that East has two clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry Peter, could not resist|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would seemingly reduce their effectiveness in defence if the first signal was always Smith. On this particular hand it would prove a hindrance, for example. North does not know ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: how many clubs South has.  |pg||
nt|petergill: A spade back would remove a vital entry, how about a @d back?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Smith is only mentioned as a sub-note, not in the main table of signals.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A heart will give Hamman the tempo again|pg||
nt|petergill: @C4 was Reverse Smith, i.e. it said "I do not like spades, the suit I led."|pg||
nt|brolucius: But South did play high from his clubs, so you may be right.|pg||
nt|petergill: As they play Slawinsky Leads, a corollary is to use Reverse Smith on all hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni is obviously not convinced regarding the club position|pg||
nt|petergill: NS Convention Card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|stigw: Fantoni might think, that Hamman has got 4-card-di.|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|stigw: Still some work to be done.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too much, don't you think?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's touch and go|pg||
