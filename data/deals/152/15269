nt|dburn: it looks like a fast auction - I am not sure about "smooth", because I don't know what 4@h meant|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: possibly "last train", which may or may not be part of the Standard Buffett System|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like KC to me|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 with the Q|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: that is certainly not part of Buffett Standard, amd I don't think Auken and Sementa play together often enough to have come up with the agreement themselves|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|pef: we're about to start the last individual match of the day, where members of each team pair up with a new partner each match|pg||
nt|bernix: welcome to session 6 of buffet cup|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Rashed|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Rashed :)|pg||
nt|haans: Sucken have no good bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yesterday, we saw Sabine lead the @ST from KTx of dummy's bid @S suit which held QJ-sixth.  Daniela won the A and returned a low one and declarer understandably pitched a side ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: loser, losing to Sabine's K and could only comment, "That was sexy."|pg||
nt|bernix: europe has amassed a large deficit of 18 BPs. so we have to make up ground NOW|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: just us talking to ourselves :)|pg||
nt|haans: Aucken|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Cornelia and Haans.|pg||
nt|pef: this is 6 boards, board-a-match, winner take all|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: Jill is checking convention card ....|pg||
nt|pef: test|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: so is Fred|pg||
nt|pef: gitelman and levin's partners in this match are Bob Hamman and Bobby Levin|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what a hand, 4@H EW as the cards are placed and good save in minors for NS.|pg||
nt|rado: N may blast to 3NT now|pg||
nt|bernix: 6 BPs at stage per session, a 6-0 would help our cause|pg||
nt|april7: slamish|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: they have landed right|pg||
nt|chick: nice choice by Auken ... with N showing 4 hearts, she chooses to show the diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: von Arnom knows only 40 hcp exist but ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Tricky hand and difficult for W to pass 2@D.|pg||
nt|haans: Arnim|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|bernix: welcome back to buffet cup, session 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: simple clubs raise?|pg||
nt|haans: pass a good option|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|chick: N has pretty much described his hand, except for about an A worth of value, but with his partner passing 2@D, I don't think he has much left to say|pg||
nt|sybarra: bjr yves |pg||

nt|haans: 3@H passable|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3 hearts is plenty here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 3Nt looks ok here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rado: Fantoni may lead small @H at trick 2|pg||
nt|bernix: usa need 11 more bps to win the trophy. europe need 29 bps|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Hi Victor|pg||
nt|haans: all cards wrong :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if defence is accurate then 3 down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: +3|pg||
nt|bernix: unlucky - but normal - lead|pg||
nt|april7: can't bid 7, because of missing K of trumps|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kiwi_joker: not a lot of specs .. i think I have enough biscuits to go around everyone, in fact|pg||
nt|spooky: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: Hi Hans|pg||
nt|bernix: fantoni needs to find the @h switch now. should be routine|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@d at this table and 2@h at the OR|pg||
mb|4D|nt|daman: just a @S p/s for NS?   East took one too many bids|pg||
nt|mamos: yep looks like -300|pg||
nt|daman: difficult to understand whay he would bid 4@C|pg||
nt|daman: siff @S and Qxx of @D is better|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: yep|pg||
mb|4N|nt|spooky: 3NT looks like making, only a @C lead from south would set it.|pg||
nt|daman: t*|pg||
nt|yvesj49: nice event|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: well you cant really find yourself in a room where 'dud' players are in action ... as this event features 24 of the world's very best|pg||
nt|mamos: are we linked to the correct table ?|pg||
nt|mamos: i thought the twins were always scoring agianst Levin and Weinstein|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: other room looks to have started with a precision 2@C, and someohow they couldnt put the brakes on before reaching a hopelessly optimistic 6C|pg||
nt|spooky: but Brogeland took his "safe"plus scoe in 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: but non vulnerable :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bridge a funny game - Jx of @H's part of the thinking to go back to 2@S but @HJ turns out to be highly useful card.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Indeed eliminates a @D loser, as it is.|pg||
mb|5H|nt|yvesj49: where we can see the best world's players|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|mamos: sorry  been eating too much lunchh  only eight tricks in NT  apologies|pg||
nt|drewsky: no Mike, 3NT is indeed cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: 5@D bid and made at the other table, so first board goes to USA|pg||

nt|mamos: hello|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: @S finesse has become important to make the hand.|pg||
nt|bernix: hi mike|pg||
nt|mamos: so 5@H was making six I think|pg||
nt|drewsky: Looks like -500 against +480 ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: welcome back |pg||
nt|mamos: so declarer needs ten tricks to win the board and that lok unlikely|pg||

nt|rv: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi all|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hard to stay in a part score on this board|pg||
nt|april7: ace and ace of @S safety play, to dangerous to go to J of @C for a discard of @Hx on @D ace|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: 3@C+1@H+2@S=6 -3 I think.|pg||
nt|mamos: Heart lead is best start for defence as South hoping to get trump promotion |pg||

nt|dburn: maybe it was just to persuade Zia not to lead a heart, but he has done that sort of thing himself so often that he wasn't fooled|pg||

nt|chick: hopefully we'll find out the end result of that board when the operator has time to put it in :)|pg||

nt|haans: new board now|pg||
nt|mamos: just too much from Justin there|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I think so |pg||
nt|jcwla: The N hand playable in three different strains, contains a void, and the @H suit represents a small fraction of its values with nothing on top.  |pg||
nt|yvesj49: ty rashed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes @@@C and @D.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|daman: bidding 4@C on that hand is like found money for the opps     getting something for nothing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|Walddk5: East is Justin Hackett|pg||
nt|bernix: looks like something went wrong :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: 3 off I believe|pg||
nt|bernix: yes|pg||
nt|drewsky: Why do you say that..down 3 looked norma|pg||
mb|d|nt|pef: this look like a likely 4H game|pg||
mb|2C|nt|haans: 6@C possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They are both   J  Hackett|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rv: transfer responses here, 1@h shows 4+@s|pg||
nt|Walddk5: But North is Hampson|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pef: ah, that makes a bit more sense|pg||
nt|rado: 4@H with @S guess|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: they could be trying a posible 3NT contract from West hand |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: X will come from W|pg||
nt|bernix: von arnim could bid it knowing partner must have 'some' values|pg||
nt|bernix: X has disadvantage that she still doesnt know what to do over 3@s|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true a problem of space |pg||
nt|bernix: on my screen it was -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H can be beateb on spade lead|pg||
nt|drewsky: ONLY if played by south|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good bid west|pg||
nt|yvesj49: NS are out of 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: Individual: Each player on Team Europe is drawn to compare with a particular player on Team USA. A player does not meet the player with whom he or she compar|pg||
nt|yvesj49: WITH 25 COUNT|pg||
nt|yvesj49: if i play i don't want to be compared with fantoni lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or 6@H|pg||
nt|mamos: although  Americans are in 4@C x at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Fred is playing in Match A|pg||
nt|rado: strange no Drury used?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: pass surprising |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: I think her 3 card @C makes her pass|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rv: Brogeland's 1@s denies 4@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Henry, welcome.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Got it right now|pg||
nt|pef: a rather speculative double from Duboin assuming that's not an anomaly|pg||
nt|bernix: they are using a standardized cc most propably w/o drury|pg||
mb|3S|nt|spooky: 1@S shows 3@S|pg||
nt|rv: with 4 he would have jumped to 2@s and with 2 would have rebid 1n or 2m|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: weird that Brogeland didn't open 1NT, they play 15-17...|pg||
nt|rv: Levin-Weinstein compared with Duboin-Sementa and Brogeland-Saelensmide with Sontag-Berk|pg||
nt|rv: play of @h suit critical for OT in this contract|pg||
nt|ady: Europe should win the board 5@C  at least down 2|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D Bourke = just GF bid|pg||
nt|daman: Berkowicz|pg||
nt|drewsky: There is no winning defense here.|pg||
nt|mamos: North South may regret this |pg||
nt|drewsky: NOT suprisingly, a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: it's about the overtrick in this lay out|pg||
nt|mamos: the scoring method has led to many NT contracts  as players hunt for the magic +10 points|pg||
nt|daman: easy to figure this 3rd and 5th|pg||
nt|rado: other table will open E hand probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: cc was consulted by Fulvio before bidding 3H|pg||
nt|drewsky: Perhaps you need lasek surgery ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: we were on "manual" here - sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: holy ... 2nt natural?|pg||
nt|chick: looks like just one diamond loser, and perhaps a heart loser|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sound 4@S with @H guess can make 6.|pg||
nt|haans: odds against doing right in hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true. 10 @H very vital card.|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: In every case the four individuals at one table have their corresponding opponent sitting in the same seat at the matching table. |pg||
nt|april7: S might misssguess the @H position|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: Berk made the same bad 4@C bid|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: some spects say Est could of bid 3@D|pg||
nt|bernix: saelesmind made 8 tricks in 1n on board 13 to win the fist point for europe|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rv: I presume Levin will duck @h to @hK smoothyl|pg||
nt|pef: well 5c would have been a good save|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: Good lead.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rv: smoothly|pg||
nt|mamos: getting too high ?|pg||
nt|mamos: and indeed identical auction  -- I suppose thats mor likely with standard systems|pg||
nt|april7: S could try first to develop adiscard of @Hx on @C K which doesn't work and then try @H and might go down|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yvesj49: nice organization|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcwla: Instead of wishing physical harm on your enemy, just wish that Sabine leads to all their contracts.|pg||
nt|bernix: careful unblocking enables auken to make 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|drewsky: Levin has had 2 painful defensive hands in 2 boards.|pg||
nt|april7: very helpful switch, now  S will make it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwi_joker: unless South is very much asleep when declarer plays a heart from dummy later on, this will go -1|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mamos: wheels have come off here|pg||
nt|april7: @d continuation wouldn't give anything away|pg||
pc|hA|nt|spooky: this helps declarer|pg||
nt|rv: after South's @H9, Brogeland may just get it right|pg||
nt|rv: ah, easy now for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Pairs, Teams and Individual events in Warren Buffet Cup, all scoring is BAM style|pg||
nt|rv: so OTs and UTs very crucial, this form of scoring is lot tougher than IMPs and a bit tougher than Pairs (MPs)|pg||
nt|rv: if you make 8 tricks in 2@s and your opps make same 8 tricks in NT, you get 0 BAM points|pg||
nt|haans: 54% for this slam|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event. Have a look|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer will have to sniff out Heart position for a good score|pg||
nt|daman: he will sniff it out by default|pg||
nt|daman: he will not risk his contract   and in so doing will drop the @H King|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That would be +2 and good score.|pg||

nt|mamos: Sontag and Berkowicz in 4@H so looks irrelevant how many tricks   he makes here|pg||
nt|pef: I'm not sure why the other table scoring isn't showing up here, but assuming the matching table is  Open room, the europeans won the first board by competing to 4c and going down 1|pg||

nt|sybarra: In the Individual each set is of just six deals|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rnmalik: imo the only lead which sets 4@H.|pg||
nt|drewsky: East assumed that clubs was trumps all along|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|odysseus69: is there any reason to get hearts wrong?|pg||
nt|pef: interesting point of the hand, it looks like hampson needs to take a diamond finesse now, giving up on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|bernix: to repeat a so-so 5-card suit on the 3-level is not my style|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets she what is the move on the other table in board 14 |pg||
pc|s8|pc|dT|nt|rnmalik: N 's hand is counted 5@S+4@D+2@C +2@H|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|pef: I guess not, although if east had ducked the heart it would ahve been more interesting|pg||
pc|s4|nt|daman: 4@H has the same guess as overtricks in 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  unlucky. This way he runs out of trumps|pg||
nt|henryb:  provided North continues spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  He is also unlucky that the player with the fourth spade has the late club entry|pg||
nt|mamos: all done |pg||
pc|s2|nt|westjava: 6-3 fit,drop I think|pg||

mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: I really think West needs to make a move & X there even with only 2card @S|pg||
nt|bernix: do they use 2@d 3rd suit forcing ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: its a 12 trick contract here on board 15 |pg||
nt|bernix: 6@c is one of two finesses|pg||

nt|spooky: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: and gernbrand |pg||
nt|rv: thinking aloud, would it helped Weinstein to play @Hj and @hx to indicate @d preference|pg||
nt|rv: not sure of their SP methods, many partnerships play smith-echo or rev smith-echo in nt contracts to indicate continuation of suit or shifts in obvious / non-obvious suits|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure Levin-Weinstein have detailed defensive agreements, this deal will test those agreements|pg||
nt|rv: he needs to win @SA though:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I see i have arrived at the kill point|pg||
nt|spooky: winning @SA is not the problem I think.. i think he is wondering what to switch|pg||
nt|rv: yes Mike, you can give your perspective on carding agreements|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: I much like play suggested by Hop, play second @s early|pg||
nt|spooky: wow, it's made now|pg||
nt|bernix: i prefer berko's 3@c overcall but maybe they are using different conventions over 1nt opener|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s9|nt|odysseus69: going for maximum|pg||
nt|westjava: now 2@C, 3@D, 1@H and 4@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: spaded best now from South|pg||
nt|odysseus69: better-cash heart|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no score for board 3 from open room - did I see 4Dx -2|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now North is in real trouble|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: ½ a point|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pef: well now that won't happen, so a win for europe on the board and they go up by a board with 2 to go|pg||
nt|bernix: i think the same sacrifice will be found in OR|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rv: even the best can get it wrong, some consolation for lesser mortals like us|pg||
nt|westjava: I think connection not so good from the hotel (Miskin Manor Hotel, near Cardiff)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: might settle for 11 |pg||
nt|bernix: 11 tricks with @s10 lead in OR|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: well i dont know what happened earlier in the hand but my dog says 2 men play same suit one man crazy|pg||
nt|jcwla: With AT7 of @H's and two cards below a 7, 2NT by von Arnim looks pretty good in the rearview mirror.|pg||

nt|westjava: they are having a few technical problems, sorry for this inconvinience...|pg||

nt|vugraphzrh: stress here is getting to the players - calling for water and pills!!!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rv: Brogeland could have won BAM point easily by passing 3@s and getting a plus, he has won it the hard way by bidding and making 3n|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: no   getting 12    Europe wins the board|pg||

nt|rv: at these colors, I will consider a pass|pg||
nt|ady: you lack quick tricks out side diamonds     even if there is sokid diamonds oppsoite   KQJ etc   it seems either a club or heart trick will leave you 1 short|pg||
nt|drewsky: The opponents are cold for 5@C....don't make it easy for them to get there|pg||

nt|rv: Fantunes rate to take this atleast 2 down at this stage of play, so Europe may not lose on this board|pg||
nt|ady: thats different if you are bidding to keep them out|pg||
nt|rv: in my experience of watching top level Vu graph, Fantunes are exceptionally good defenders even amongst the elite|pg||
nt|pef: very aggressive 3NT call by levin.  but looks like it will be justified with only 3 hearts available and the spade finesse working|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES **** BUFFETT CUP **** USA  93 EUR 75 ****   (First to 100 Wins)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rv: Drew has a point|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 4 in the OR, B. Levin made the 3@S rebid predicted in here, and Meyers passed, so already a win for Europe.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 4 is quite agressive|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh was corrected to down 1 in here, so actually a win for USA.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with modern light openings|pg||
nt|yvesj49: eric is about squeezing|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jcwla: It's 5 where USA lost the board in the bidding - Rodwell's understandable raise to 3@D over 2@D was not duplicated by Nunes, so Meyers' second double produced 2@S by Levin, then ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H over Nunes' delayed 3@D.  Meyers did not raise and 3@H the final contract so a win to Europe.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bernix: as in KY i hope for a turnaround on the golf course|pg||
nt|bernix: bye all|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

pc|s9|nt|rv: I expect Fantoni to end-play declarer for 3 down|pg||
nt|hedyg: declarer is squeezed now|pg||
nt|rv: declarer is squeezed and he may concede 2 @h tricks in the end in addition to 4@cs and a @s|pg||
