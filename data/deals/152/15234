nt|cuttysark: So it is all to play for|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So 6-0 is the maximum win per set|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: In general I have found it better to ignore the rather complicated scoring system, sit back and enjoy the bridge. At the end we will clap politely when they announce the winners.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|stigw: Matchpoints, imps or board a match ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times|pg||
nt|brolucius: Slight more loudly if our favourites have won.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. However, the scoreboard is americanized for obvious reasons|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: Just multiply by 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have a calculator if you need one|pg||
nt|brolucius: It used to be said that you should go straight to 4@S with five-card support. But now players reckon that you need a side singleton as well. East takes a different route with ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5-3-3-2 shape, where the five trumps may not be sorth so much.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It is a very hard form of scoring, one we are not accustomed to. Here, for example, Justin might have doubled in case his counterpart in the other room gaiins 100 and he loses the ...|pg||

pc|sA|pc|d9|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Both teams are playing 2/1|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: Meaning that a two-level response in a new suit is forcing to game.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h8|nt|stigw: N/S could make 4 of a minor I think, so only + 50 is doubtfull.|pg||

nt|ady: 4@H  well over the top|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: Of course Rodwell isn't overjoyed at bidding 3@S but he doesn't have much option.|pg||

nt|jcwla: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: note South's response on a 1-count |pg||
nt|jcwla: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||

nt|jcwla: players on their team for a short set (6 boards) against various partnerships from the other team.  Each team has agreed on a standard convention card for this event.|pg||
nt|sybarra: need your guessing shoes on in either contract however |pg||

nt|jcwla: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||

nt|athene: one down is easy (@DAK, @HA, east's trump trick, with a ruff or not)|pg||
nt|roswolf: has|pg||
nt|jbgood: NS can make quite a few tricks in @ds, but ... and 3 NT may go lots of downers if defense is found|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and remember it is BAM scoring|pg||
nt|jbgood: still, may be easier to get the odd extra trick in NT than in @s contract|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psridhar: this may go all the way to 6s, a faulty contract !|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N the likely destination here|pg||
nt|jbgood: for example if S plays the ten now...|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mrt2000: not a great start for Mexwell|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i think that was wrong the undoubled undertricks may not compensate for the n/s partscore|pg||

nt|vugraphzrg: much discussion on system|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry, a bit ahead of myself !|pg||
nt|athene: and two down will be pretty much impossible i would imagine|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C certainly wasn't a routine action so this might be a swing for europe|pg||

nt|yvesj49: but obvious for West to bid 2@s|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mrdct: good start for europe|pg||
nt|athene: East's discard on the @DK asked for a heart, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer only had the @HK it would be necessary to play a heart through to get the second undertrick|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Agreed that you would never nromally double, but at this form of scoring +50 may not be any better than -590|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@S - 2@C - 2@D - 3@C can be dropped.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|stigw: The double might be taken as a further take out.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|othered1: A very normal-looking weak 2-bid.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cuttysark: Do you consider 3@H to be equally normal?|pg||
nt|stigw: Good lead.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: The raise by west was just enough to freeze NS out.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT looks playable but E/W made life difficult. North was reluctant to double with only three spades.|pg||
nt|othered1: And 3@H, yes.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: This is quite funny. On the European CC we see negative doubles through 3@S, on the American through 7@H!|pg||
nt|othered1: The Roth influence lingers . . . |pg||
nt|brolucius: I look forward to seeing such a negative double. |pg||
nt|stigw: Should be 3 down at least, but still maybe good for East-West.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: "I had to bid 7@S, partner. I held four spades with you."|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|nt|cuttysark: Debatable whether North would bid 2NT in 4th seat even if West passes - I gues he should|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had North chosen to double, South would still be thinking what to respond.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrd: Zia is sure the contract in the other room will be different|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s8|nt|cuttysark: Well, Brogeland somehow brought home 3NT on Board 1, so the action here was irrelevant|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|brolucius: No doubt South would have passed, on the basis that West would hardly bid only 3@H if he had a chance of making game, so 3@H should go down.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|stigw: Miracoulous 3 nt at the other table in board 1, so Europe went + after all.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Wellcome to Venky|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome even|pg||
nt|athene: if East shows a limit raise in hearts, West won't like his hand that much|pg||

mb|3H|nt|jan_jansma: I knew :)|pg||

nt|rv: Hi Andy, Roland and all specs, 2 great pairs playing here, what more can I a bridge lover ask for:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: With all that said, hi Mike.  Looks like a very good result for Europe on Board 1.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you need the 1NT in "sandwich" position to be natural against this EW pair. They open and respond very light. |pg||
nt|daman: weak Smolen|pg||
nt|sybarra: at imps you might be in 4 @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Hi Jordan|pg||
nt|mdgraham: On the last board, East may be weak with a long suit. Lebensohl comes in handy (2NT puppets 3@C, then you can bid your long suit). A diretc bid shows reasonable values.|pg||
nt|ady: may be difficult to reach a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Brogeland seq asks for pd to pick a 2 level major nf|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@H can be beaten, so this not so good for Europe|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@H makes from the N hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a gadget strikes|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: the view in trumps will be crucial here|pg||
nt|athene: he might make even losing to both hearts - he certainly will want to finesse trumps to try to keep south from putting a spade through|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but the BAM scoring method makes a significant difference|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if you just need lots of entries to dummy you might play the @DA here, but he would quite like his second diamond trick|pg||
nt|athene: my guess he will go @DK, club to the ace, trump finesse, and then think about things|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: Boye always thinks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: claims would be easier in teams|pg||
nt|roswolf: he could win in hand and lay down the Ace of trumps - and I dont think that is an unreasonable line of play which would hit the jackpot here|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with winning the first trick in hand and playing a club for the trump finesse is you are using up your clubs before you really want to|pg||
nt|athene: for example @DK, club to ace, trump finesse loses, north plays a club straight back at you|pg||
nt|athene: and you have a nasty guess to make|pg||
nt|athene: if you play @DA here and a heart finesse you have a bit more breathing-space with the club suit|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't want to be cut off from the clubs before trumps are drawn|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence might be able to do that by attacking clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed bill but that is why laying down the ace is not reasonable|pg||
nt|roswolf: not unreasonable i meant!!|pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes but you really, really don't want to lose a trump to south|pg||
nt|athene: and have spade through and immediately lose @SAQ with a possible overruff on a third spade|pg||
nt|athene: i think you have to take lots of trump finesses through south|pg||
nt|roswolf: true that is why declarer's thinking|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm vive la difference!|pg||
nt|jbgood: best game and righthanded too|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes individuals are all about practical bidding|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: @C tap right away|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mrt2000: indeed so, but not from S!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unlikely to go down even from S...  J from Jx seems an unlikely choice|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: a fair shot by geir|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: So West wasn't flying solo when he bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|psridhar: that attacking lead will tap decl trumps, but decl may not mind scoring his little trumps in a dummy reversal manner|pg||
nt|daman: West has to get the @Ss moving|pg||
nt|jbgood: not giwing away 2 heart tricks may be good for Europe|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bigtrain: always 11 tricks available in @S...  @C lead holds 3N to 10|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good road to slam|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam never really in the picture|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 50%|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|odysseus69: looks like 8 tricks i|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, S passed the 1@S opening and EW ended in 3@C.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: it seems duboin quite pessimist|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: so the "secret" so far is lead clubs agst. nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt many would lead clubs from Jxxx|pg||
nt|roswolf: a little worse i think and at BAM scoring not a good propostion - unless it makes of course!:)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: better lead than from Axxx imo|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: poor quality trumps|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|bigtrain: tempo seems to dictate a @C lead is best|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: 2-2 @D and @CK in the S hand allow 11 tricks it seems|pg||
pc|c6|nt|daman: this way looks OK as well|pg||
nt|mrt2000: really, I think it's likely to be the best attack at trick 1|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but east didn't bid 4@d a good new with bare ace|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c5|nt|jbgood: zia stole back in the OR|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: Brogeland playing dummy reversal indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: Duboin is on the right track so far|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|rmb1: Do Justin+Jason still play weak NT?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no- 14-16 rising to 15-17 in 3rd and 4th|pg||
nt|psridhar: needs to use dia ace to play spd|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be down 1...NS just need to be careful and not get endplayed in the @h suit|pg||
nt|rv: Roland, is last night's score of US leading by 20 Buffet points confirmed?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||

mb|1S|nt|daman: at trick 2|pg||
nt|psridhar: but EW bid well with E bidding only 1nt on a goodish 18|pg||
nt|lml: hi :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 14-16|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 15,  Hamman and Zia in 5 @D |pg||
nt|ady: game in either major for n/s|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: possible auction here -  3NT-6@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, same start to the auction, but Brogeland did not move over N's 1NT, so a win to USA there.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D = 2+ 10-15 or so... many shapes possible|pg||
mb|2S|nt|daman: goodish is a new word to me|pg||
nt|rv: for this match Zia, Hamman and Meckwell are for US, German Ladies, Fantunes for Europe|pg||
nt|roswolf: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 1@s forcing|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mrdct: NS can make 4@c i think|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Rodwell will like this 3@C bid :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: it was a close call for Justin...|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt is a zia like effort|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: sure to make 6D - but can they get there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has a huge hand now after the 3@D jump |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and not bid grand|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i saw it yesterday lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm north would want to pass methinks|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: this seems to be par contract|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 4,5@C?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: no 1@s is forcing|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bigtrain: this one appears to be flat also|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 9 or 10 tricks, I excpect|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but i would still want to pass!|pg||
nt|roswolf: and a probable winning one|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jbgood: even though Zia is West... 2 NT may just roll home |pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: 3@S likely a fragment-style bid, as South did not bid 1@S over 1@H |pg||
nt|daman: Some pairs play DOPI for controls over opposition to their 2@C opening|pg||
nt|daman: he might get squeezed if he doesn't take his 2@Hs|pg||
nt|daman: but there is the issue of transportation|pg||
nt|daman: and N can hold the @Ss|pg||
nt|psridhar: decl has 10 top tricks and will need to play h to get his 11th|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: very well done by NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: I always have problems finding my .5 card |pg||
nt|mrdct: optimal spot for NS|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i leant the method this night lol|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@S is just showing a stop (of sorts) for 3NT,  Does not know North is making slam tries.|pg||
nt|daman: if East had AK10 of @S there would be a shot  |pg||
nt|roswolf: run the club jack and bobs your uncle|pg||
nt|jbgood: or take the di finesse - that is also a winning loser:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psridhar: now decl is a tempo behind -likely only 430|pg||
nt|yvesj49: agressive lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: learnt*|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   likely to fail     4@S has a better play|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2@d probably raise in spades|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rv: inpite of big @c fit, @hQ is offside and 9 tricks are limit here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is now about the play|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: no 1@S overcall - mildly surprising|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5@C is not a bad contract (it is with the @CK ofside:))|pg||
nt|ady: need to avoid the heart finesse     likely to go down |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|psridhar: cl are 5-0|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Interesting now|pg||
nt|jbgood: Helness' 3 spades in the OR more difficult to cope with than the more conservative 2 @s here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|odysseus69: few undos to correct|pg||
nt|lml: what is the max tricks possible?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: does now....|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Teams, Pairs and Individual events in Wareen Buffet Cup, every event is scored on BAM style, so OTs and UTs are very important|pg||
nt|rv: German ladies have competed to 3@s in OR which is only 1 down|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: i think he can make 11 now|pg||
nt|lml: 5 i think after that good guess|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a @D and a @S|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yvesj49: one off|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks -1 but likely to be in game at the other table|pg||
nt|yvesj49: heart switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: yes 2d alerted as raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty terry|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: club lead still not good enough|pg||
nt|rmb1: In a less confident partnership, South would have let North play in hearts by now :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not content with 6@D at pairs. But a club lead may be interesting  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to make after the take out double|pg||
nt|odysseus69: west will be thrown in to concede 2 spade tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess there is a strip squeeze on a club lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: also could duck and squeeze as long as he reads distribution-not a problem either way |pg||
nt|xenya: now he has to get @H right as well|pg||
nt|rv: much needed board for Europeans |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: the t/o double places virtually all the high cards - just room for East to hold @SJ perhaps|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Sabine Auken needs to play a @D now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: for 11|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rmb1: Doesn't duck and squeeze require West to have @SJ, which is only card he might not have|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no - spade jack not relevant|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although West may reduce to a singleton K in spades - but North will get it right  |pg||
nt|rmb1: The plan is for south to have SQx and winning diamond, and North to have SAx and C10.  |pg||
nt|dimi: Nunes has to hold @c K and @s K, so there is no chance to escape the squeeze|pg||
nt|odysseus69: N/S areboth Jill- North Jill Levin -now corrected-wife of Bobby Levin|pg||
nt|lml: yes it may be quite tempting to play hearts the wrong way|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** BUFFETT CUP IN RUNNING Currently USA 50  EUR 46  ****|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rmb1: When South cashes the diamond, either the C10 or SQ will become a winner|pg||
nt|jcwla: I'd say very surprising, meanwhile a great result for Europe here.|pg||
nt|lml: since it is safer that way|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h3|nt|psridhar: good lead by Rodwell, will hold to 10|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||

mb|p|nt|rmb1: 1@C is 14+ with clubs or 15+ BAL, F|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 9 tricks in hearts and a struggle for 9 in spades -|pg||
nt|xenya: was well defended by N -- that @C shift|pg||

mb|3S|nt|drewsky: Many partnerships play that 4 of a aminor here by west is NOT a slam try.....|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes the play is the thing|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|odysseus69: as is the modern style aggressive bidding all round|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@H is a transfer 0-11 4 @S|pg||

nt|psridhar: 3nt wont play well on a h lead; 5c has chances|pg||

nt|daman: they are in 4NT   NS in the Open Room|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jan_jansma: Meckstroth mortal like us too|pg||
pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: more often 1 spade as take-out and double to show hearts|pg||
nt|rv: looks like Rodwell will make 8 tricks here, 3@h is possibly 1 down and may not get doubled|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psridhar: mcwell bidding system is complex- i am unable to fig out how Mcstroth came to know the dia void opposite to bid 6c missing 2 aces|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|daman: I'm sure it is part of the meckwell system|pg||
nt|andyv:  with this vul, a dbl could easily cost the board|pg||

nt|andyv:  it looks as if EW will win this board as 2@s made 3 in OR|pg||
nt|rv: at the end of 5 rounds of Pairs on Day 1 (yesterday), US have won 10 matches and Europe won 5 matches out of 15 (3 per round)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jan_jansma: a "normal"  -200|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

nt|jbgood: and this will be the first flat one in this set - worth 0.5 for both pairs in the scoring|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Thoughts?|pg||
nt|stigw: In fact 4 H is makeable, but impossible to bid I guess.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: EW coped nicely with the interference.  And @DK lead ensures east will get @S right|pg||

mb|p|nt|bigtrain: XX shows 4+@H|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Where Helness did not finesse hearts in 6@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: this could get high very quickly|pg||
nt|mrdct: too much outside to preempt|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lml: 4@H looks normal here but maybe by way of stayman|pg||
nt|bigtrain: neb diamond shows 2+@D 10-15 many shapes possible|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: and went 1 down in the open room|pg||
nt|yvesj49: we didn't see this board roland|pg||
nt|athene: wow, that's some pass from east, assuming the double is normal penalties|pg||
nt|athene: this was really the auction? or you are just putting in the final contract?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think we're just catching up|pg||
nt|athene: yes, right, that seems more likely|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi everyone|pg||

mb|3D|nt|mrdct: and opening values anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ok|pg||
nt|stigw: 3 cl down 2 I imagine.|pg||
nt|stigw: Sorry, that was board 15 - a very unlucky start for Hellnes.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: NS very agressive.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 3n just on last sementa apol|pg||
nt|athene: then everyone would be sort of sane|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rv: arguably the weakest pair in the field, Hackett twins have lost all 5 of their matches yesterday|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure of problem on bd 15 |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: unless NS lose their diamond fit, which has indeed happened |pg||
nt|daman: they are going down more than 1 in 4NT|pg||
nt|drewsky: stayman, then smolen, the delayed jacoby.....thats the way I like to play it|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a soft lead and declarer should make a lot of tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: should get to 4@s now|pg||
nt|ady: clubs well placed|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: great win for USA|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3 emabrassing overtricks for E|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H is not quite clear to me |pg||
nt|othered1: East  has a lot of cards for the auction up to him.  Not unusual when two pairs use light initial action approaches|pg||
nt|yvesj49: justin will make|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w may well bid the game now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jan_jansma: well bid|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yvesj49: club now|pg||
nt|yvesj49: and with 10/9 alone|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psridhar: many pairs play 1c-2h/2s to show major 2 suitor in a limited range-not Saelensmin|pg||
nt|daman: they must play standard count in this situation|pg||
nt|rv: sorry they lost 4 out of 5 matches|pg||
nt|bigtrain: don't think they have any play at 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

nt|rv: sorry @c ruff should restrict declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: thanks to all kibitzers for helping me and other commentators when we make mistakes:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: R deep in thought|pg||
nt|rv: another surprising stat from Day 1, Fantunes have also lost 4 matches on Day 1|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if east thought of redoubling, if it would have shown power?  And would NS have sat it out?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well after 3@D - CANTY TYPE QUICK ENOUGH:(|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rv: they are too good a pair and I expect them to bounce back today|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 15 poss fouled board in OR?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: lets ask GIB :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrdct: can't ruff @c losers and control trumps|pg||
nt|stigw: I guess he might make it now, but no sure thing, even if the start was promising.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: only 6 tricks available for NS|pg||
nt|bigtrain: overtricks are possible for e/w|pg||
nt|stigw: Meck is best to duck here, but not obvious by any means.|pg||
nt|othered1: agree on overtrice|pg||
pc|d3|nt|odysseus69: what she should have bid last time- this sounded like a slam try - and maye it stopped Fantoni bidding 5D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not easy for EW, the way the auction went|pg||
nt|daman: Incredibly    Levin/Meyers are in 2NT in the OR|pg||
nt|chessmaste: whoops|pg||
nt|bigtrain: or should i say overtrick|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe it shows E's shape?|pg||
nt|drewsky: Apparently they play some sort of funny stayman (modified puppet perhaps), and they got their wires crossed|pg||
nt|lml: they have obviously had some confusion|pg||
nt|xenya: modified puppet, i'm to;d|pg||
nt|roswolf: getting the trumps right will be difficult|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzrg: E/W 6/4 majors but disagree on which way|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|psridhar: if 2s wasnt forcing, E needed to bid more-may be he could have balanced 2N ( unbal, 2 suitor) and corrected 3m to 3H showing spds as his 2nd suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2nt is odd with 6-5 in maj|pg||
nt|stigw: Must be a winning board for Europe here.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: and it looks like twelve tricks are there in diamonds - with a shot at thirteen, too|pg||
nt|psridhar: i even sympathise with a 4h punt over 1n-p-p in E seat|pg||

pc|s5|pc|d6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|othered1: 180 isn't an automatic win|pg||
nt|stigw: To beat it they must play in a way that probably on this layout means several ovcertricks (at board a match scoring).|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables are no longer linked|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mrdct: @s now for guaranteed beat looks best|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Must have misread the squeeze - much easier for us in our armchairs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @D9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He mistimed it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: NO! @D9 is the Curse. @D7 is some Scandinavian Beer Card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: east has to return a @d to break the squeeze|pg||
nt|stigw: I dont think he had the rest.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He had|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cashing @CA was wrong|pg||
nt|stigw: I know of course the Danish beer-card, but the curse might have been the same.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He needed to use clubs as the pivot suit, didn't he?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Board 4, where Berkowitz stopped conservatively in 3@S, was flat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He mistimed it there|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, needed to keep the @CA, as Roland says.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We do not consider beer to be a curse :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyway, no more boards in this set|pg||
nt|brolucius: West held the hearts, East held the diamonds, no-one could keep the clubs.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are shutting down shortly|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems Rodwell made 12 tricks in spades, presuambly the same squeeze|pg||
nt|vugraphzrd: just waiting for other room to finish.  restart 4pm UK time|pg||
nt|stigw: I think 460 is a very good result for N/S.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps the @CK switch, when East won the diamond, would break the squeeze.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are talking about a non-simutaneous double squeeze. All BBO commentators should be familiar with that one, a spectator says|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stig, concede|pg||
nt|stigw: But there should be no genuine squezze methinks.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The double squeeze was there|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another point for the USA, so this match hinges on the final board|pg||
nt|stigw: How exactly do you propose he should have played it ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As he did, just don't cash @CA|pg||
nt|brolucius: John Carruthers tells me that after the @CK return, you switch to a different squeeze, using hearts as the pivot suit. Sounds right!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then they will suffer a slow and painful death|pg||
nt|brolucius: West holds the clubs, East holds the diamonds, no-one can then hold the hearts!|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is the mantra of the double squeeze.|pg||
nt|stigw: If East returns Di 10 after winng the K, its impossible I think.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Jill Levin is trying to make 12 tricks in 4S after Sontag used a Texas transfer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She won't make more than 11|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board for Europe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and the match|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Cant you make 12 in spades also?|pg||
nt|stigw: You are right, as the play went he should have taken 12 tricks, but couls always be held in 11 I think (most simple with a cl-start).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: USA wins Match C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4-2 BP to USA|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct: with NS playing precision there will be a delay in them finding their @d fit|pg||
nt|stigw: No, thats another question - but "meckwell" sometimes do starnge things (and usually come out successfully).|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: a prempt with an ace and a king on thee side and trump suit headed by jack may seem abnormal, but is often effective|pg||
nt|daman: in my youth I would have bid 5@C with the N hand and lucked out|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H = 4+ forcing, might have a longer minor|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe strange for general consumption but they are very disciplined within the structure|pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead will solve one problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW make 4@s easily enough, so NS's task is to locate a paying save|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 4+|pg||
nt|mrdct: if they do ever find it|pg||
nt|athene: but then @C10 switch|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lml: the spades are actually fairlky useful as the cards lie|pg||
nt|drewsky: my que bidding he is over bidding but will enusre that he at least gets to the correct game.|pg||
nt|xenya: well W has been warned...|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the bidding was simple|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps more of a clue now|pg||
nt|jbgood: is there a 12th?|pg||
nt|roswolf: there may well be on that lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: 2D probably checkback|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d probably artificial GF|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: on the nother hand....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@D may buy it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would think 2 @D logical bid now but oh well.....|pg||
nt|mrdct: interesting that east didn't act over 1@c|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: this hand might take a while|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Duck the first trick and @H towards the @H9 looks best|pg||
nt|mrdct: east will be keen to score a trick with the @s2 and may try to duck a @c and then play !A and try to ruff one in her hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: the better plan may be to fire @ds back at the defence|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good lead !|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is the type of board where "or it makes or it doesn't" -- E's actions really surprising.|pg||
nt|mrdct: the defence need to be careful too not to get frisky with playing @h and giving south unwanted ruffs|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @ST return now? With the @S87 in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: I'm told we're awaiting a ruling on board 16|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: from OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Russell |pg||
nt|mrdct: @s10 is good as it sends the message to north that i have control of trumps - no ruffs needed|pg||
nt|athene: you have to rise the king to block them and play a diamond to the jack right away to set up a discard|pg||
nt|athene: maybe this is all findable|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't see why you should play for clubs 5-2|pg||
nt|jbgood: kibs disagree - from 11 to 13 tricks - tu:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mrdct: east will be analysing how 5@d will fare here|pg||
nt|mrt2000: W needs to go quietly here|pg||
nt|yvesj49: trump promotion|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: snap|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South shows 3 spades and thats enough info for North|pg||
nt|lml: by and large the hand lies well for duboin|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oh dear ....................|pg||
nt|mrt2000: can make 5 now|pg||
nt|athene: you might just rely on @CA and @CQ both onside|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psridhar: excellent shift|pg||
nt|athene: sorry you have to play trumps first otherwise north gets a club ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the bidding suggests distribution held by the defenders|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but the bidding would have been the same if south had @Sx @HA10xxx @DAxx @CAQ109|pg||
nt|athene: and if he does, the winning line is to put the jack on the @C10|pg||
nt|athene: we don't have a play record from the other room|pg||
nt|athene: so we don't know if zia was put to the test and passed it brilliantly :)|pg||
nt|athene: if he did it will surely be bulletin material|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no problems here with 2 out of 3 finesses right and no bad breaks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: useful here to have two raises over the double - a good raise and a weak raise. It looks like EW have no such agreement|pg||
nt|athene: boink|pg||
nt|athene: ok, now it's time for Brogeland to be a hero|pg||
nt|athene: i don't honestly see any reason to guess this right|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: e.g, 2@s=weak raise, 2@h=good raise |pg||
pc|s8|nt|daman: they are in 5@C doubled in the OR|pg||
nt|mrdct: -500 may still win the board|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: there are a number of choices but pretty well everything works|pg||
nt|rv: losing an extra @s trick, but avoided a @h ruff in bargain|pg||
nt|roswolf: i fancy 12|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no way do they reach 5@D|pg||
nt|stigw: Very good lead indeed.|pg||
nt|roswolf: down the middle!|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|jan_jansma: "psyching xxx in @D now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this is all about -1 vs -2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yvesj49: 2 off|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes there is a double squeeze but can declarer read it?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: yes -- there is room for either @HK or @DA in the S hand -- but taking a @H hook looks normal|pg||
nt|roswolf: the @D7 discard was a mistake|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|mrdct: auken wishing she had a better pip than the @S2|pg||
nt|mrdct: i prefer a @d rather than @h at this point|pg||
nt|mrdct: -1 inevitable now|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: in OR, someone apparently looked at wrong hand|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: cashing the diamond ace is good|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: 5 was -1|pg||
nt|mrdct: on this board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: on brd 16|pg||
pc|s6|pc|cT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Aggregate score after 2 rounds: Europe-USA 8-16|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|stigw: Makes 3 !!!  trumph-tricks for the defence I guess.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|suketbombi: 6@Cs 2@S and a3@H a possible make  5@Cs was|pg||
nt|yvesj49: jeff had to ruff with 7 @h|pg||
nt|yvesj49: not obvious|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hard start for the twins but they are now well in the play lol|pg||
nt|jbgood: this is the toughie of the toughies - Buffet points on a squeeze overtrick on the last hand of the set!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|daman: @S ruff|pg||
nt|rv: looks like only 8 tricks now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: oops|pg||
nt|mrdct: so 16 either gets thrown out or the bridge lawyers get involved|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but possibly East didn't expect so much from West (although everything is in the right places) - remember this EW pair open  ad respond very light|pg||
nt|stigw: This ought to be a sure + for Europe.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes high standard needed to win anything here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: now Duboin can make 5|pg||
nt|xenya: this might make up fot the disaster on the previous hand |pg||
nt|bigtrain: this looks like it risks -2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @D pitch and defensive surrogate trumps|pg||
nt|mrdct: on 16 there is quite a bit of precedent that if a good result is obtained at one table and then the board is fouled at the other |pg||
nt|mrdct: table - the director can rule against the side that fouled the board|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Sabine will be disppointed with herself if she goes down 2 here|pg||
mc|10|nt|drewsky: HArd for Levin to see that...|pg||
nt|lml: I dont know|pg||
nt|lml: West can't have much less|pg||
nt|rv: can East be strip squeezed?|pg||
nt|mrdct: it is usually the responsibility of north to orientate the board correctly at the table so it could go against europe|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: but down 1 it will be|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm oh well|pg||
nt|jbgood: not coming, so a win for Europe here|pg||
pg||
