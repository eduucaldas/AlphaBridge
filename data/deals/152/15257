pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|petergill: Probably all 6 tables will bid the same away, and all six tables will begin with spade, spade, spade. |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|petergill: That is my boldest ever prediction on BBO|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h5|pc|d2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jbgood: if they had played their own system, S would have responded 1 @s, since the 1 NT response over 1 @c is a 11-12 bal hand|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|jbgood: they usually play transfers over 1 @c|pg||

nt|petergill: I think the EW discarding has made the heart position clear to South, but declarer checked anyway. |pg||
nt|jbgood: only 7 in the other room, Silla will make 8?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good morning to Henry Bethe|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|petergill: If declarer can pick @CJ, a vital overtrick is possible = very hard and very risky|pg||

nt|haans: Hi Rashed|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Rashed :)|pg||
nt|haans: Sucken have no good bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yesterday, we saw Sabine lead the @ST from KTx of dummy's bid @S suit which held QJ-sixth.  Daniela won the A and returned a low one and declarer understandably pitched a side ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: loser, losing to Sabine's K and could only comment, "That was sexy."|pg||
nt|bernix: europe has amassed a large deficit of 18 BPs. so we have to make up ground NOW|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: just us talking to ourselves :)|pg||

nt|pef: gitelman and levin's partners in this match are Bob Hamman and Bobby Levin|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what a hand, 4@H EW as the cards are placed and good save in minors for NS.|pg||
nt|rado: N may blast to 3NT now|pg||
nt|bernix: 6 BPs at stage per session, a 6-0 would help our cause|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: they have landed right|pg||
nt|chick: nice choice by Auken ... with N showing 4 hearts, she chooses to show the diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: von Arnom knows only 40 hcp exist but ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Tricky hand and difficult for W to pass 2@D.|pg||
nt|haans: Arnim|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: simple clubs raise?|pg||
nt|haans: pass a good option|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|chick: N has pretty much described his hand, except for about an A worth of value, but with his partner passing 2@D, I don't think he has much left to say|pg||

nt|yvesj49: hi shirley|pg||
pc|s6|nt|odysseus69: Hi Hans|pg||
nt|bernix: fantoni needs to find the @h switch now. should be routine|pg||
pc|s8|nt|daman: just a @S p/s for NS?   East took one too many bids|pg||
nt|mamos: yep looks like -300|pg||
nt|daman: difficult to understand whay he would bid 4@C|pg||
nt|daman: siff @S and Qxx of @D is better|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mamos: yep|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|spooky: 3NT looks like making, only a @C lead from south would set it.|pg||
nt|daman: t*|pg||
nt|yvesj49: nice event|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kiwi_joker: well you cant really find yourself in a room where 'dud' players are in action ... as this event features 24 of the world's very best|pg||
nt|mamos: are we linked to the correct table ?|pg||
nt|mamos: i thought the twins were always scoring agianst Levin and Weinstein|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: other room looks to have started with a precision 2@C, and someohow they couldnt put the brakes on before reaching a hopelessly optimistic 6C|pg||
nt|spooky: but Brogeland took his "safe"plus scoe in 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: but non vulnerable :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bridge a funny game - Jx of @H's part of the thinking to go back to 2@S but @HJ turns out to be highly useful card.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Indeed eliminates a @D loser, as it is.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yvesj49: where we can see the best world's players|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|spooky: 5@D bid and made at the other table, so first board goes to USA|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|henryb:  Declarer can make this: Win the @h, cross to the @sK, finesse @d, cash the @sA win the fourth @d in dummy and play a heart ducked to North|pg||

nt|chick: hopefully we'll find out the end result of that board when the operator has time to put it in :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: technical problems - contract is 4S by NS |pg||
nt|haans: If Levin had bid 3@C von Arnim odds to bid 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: new board now|pg||
nt|mamos: just too much from Justin there|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I think so |pg||
nt|jcwla: The N hand playable in three different strains, contains a void, and the @H suit represents a small fraction of its values with nothing on top.  |pg||
nt|yvesj49: ty rashed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes @@@C and @D.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and|pg||

nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING SCORES **** BUFFETT CUP **** USA  92 EUR 76 ****   (First to 100 Wins)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: bidding 4@C on that hand is like found money for the opps     getting something for nothing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|Walddk5: East is Justin Hackett|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pef: this look like a likely 4H game|pg||
mb|3C|nt|haans: 6@C possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They are both   J  Hackett|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: transfer responses here, 1@h shows 4+@s|pg||
nt|Walddk5: But North is Hampson|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: ah, that makes a bit more sense|pg||
nt|rado: 4@H with @S guess|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: they could be trying a posible 3NT contract from West hand |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: X will come from W|pg||
nt|bernix: von arnim could bid it knowing partner must have 'some' values|pg||
nt|bernix: X has disadvantage that she still doesnt know what to do over 3@s|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true a problem of space |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H can be beateb on spade lead|pg||
nt|drewsky: ONLY if played by south|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good bid west|pg||
nt|yvesj49: NS are out of 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: Individual: Each player on Team Europe is drawn to compare with a particular player on Team USA. A player does not meet the player with whom he or she compar|pg||
nt|yvesj49: WITH 25 COUNT|pg||
nt|yvesj49: if i play i don't want to be compared with fantoni lol|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: or 6@H|pg||
nt|mamos: although  Americans are in 4@C x at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Fred is playing in Match A|pg||
nt|rado: strange no Drury used?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: pass surprising |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: I think her 3 card @C makes her pass|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rv: Brogeland's 1@s denies 4@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Henry, welcome.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Got it right now|pg||
nt|pef: a rather speculative double from Duboin assuming that's not an anomaly|pg||
nt|bernix: they are using a standardized cc most propably w/o drury|pg||
pc|dA|nt|spooky: 1@S shows 3@S|pg||
nt|rv: with 4 he would have jumped to 2@s and with 2 would have rebid 1n or 2m|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|spooky: weird that Brogeland didn't open 1NT, they play 15-17...|pg||
nt|rv: Levin-Weinstein compared with Duboin-Sementa and Brogeland-Saelensmide with Sontag-Berk|pg||
nt|rv: play of @h suit critical for OT in this contract|pg||
nt|ady: Europe should win the board 5@C  at least down 2|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D Bourke = just GF bid|pg||
nt|daman: Berkowicz|pg||
pc|d4|nt|spooky: it's about the overtrick in this lay out|pg||
nt|mamos: the scoring method has led to many NT contracts  as players hunt for the magic +10 points|pg||
nt|daman: easy to figure this 3rd and 5th|pg||
nt|rado: other table will open E hand probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: cc was consulted by Fulvio before bidding 3H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: holy ... 2nt natural?|pg||
nt|chick: looks like just one diamond loser, and perhaps a heart loser|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sound 4@S with @H guess can make 6.|pg||
nt|haans: odds against doing right in hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true. 10 @H very vital card.|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: In every case the four individuals at one table have their corresponding opponent sitting in the same seat at the matching table. |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|daman: Berk made the same bad 4@C bid|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: some spects say Est could of bid 3@D|pg||
nt|bernix: saelesmind made 8 tricks in 1n on board 13 to win the fist point for europe|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Levin will duck @h to @hK smoothyl|pg||
nt|pef: well 5c would have been a good save|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rnmalik: Good lead.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rv: smoothly|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yvesj49: nice organization|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Instead of wishing physical harm on your enemy, just wish that Sabine leads to all their contracts.|pg||
nt|bernix: careful unblocking enables auken to make 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kiwi_joker: unless South is very much asleep when declarer plays a heart from dummy later on, this will go -1|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|spooky: this helps declarer|pg||
nt|rv: after South's @H9, Brogeland may just get it right|pg||
nt|rv: ah, easy now for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Pairs, Teams and Individual events in Warren Buffet Cup, all scoring is BAM style|pg||
nt|rv: so OTs and UTs very crucial, this form of scoring is lot tougher than IMPs and a bit tougher than Pairs (MPs)|pg||
nt|rv: if you make 8 tricks in 2@s and your opps make same 8 tricks in NT, you get 0 BAM points|pg||
nt|haans: 54% for this slam|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event. Have a look|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer will have to sniff out Heart position for a good score|pg||
nt|daman: he will sniff it out by default|pg||
nt|daman: he will not risk his contract   and in so doing will drop the @H King|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That would be +2 and good score.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rv: in Pairs (MPs), the field does protect you a bit|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Haans and every one|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: would have been interesting if KH played on 10H|pg||
nt|mamos: Sontag and Berkowicz in 4@H so looks irrelevant how many tricks   he makes here|pg||
nt|pef: I'm not sure why the other table scoring isn't showing up here, but assuming the matching table is  Open room, the europeans won the first board by competing to 4c and going down 1|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s4|nt|bernix: but not necessary with meckstroth going down in 4@h in OR|pg||
pc|cT|nt|haans: Hi Lilek|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hi Lillek|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Victor,sry late:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: In the Individual each set is of just six deals|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo the only lead which sets 4@H.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|odysseus69: is there any reason to get hearts wrong?|pg||
nt|pef: interesting point of the hand, it looks like hampson needs to take a diamond finesse now, giving up on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|bernix: to repeat a so-so 5-card suit on the 3-level is not my style|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets she what is the move on the other table in board 14 |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: N 's hand is counted 5@S+4@D+2@C +2@H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pef: I guess not, although if east had ducked the heart it would ahve been more interesting|pg||
pc|s6|nt|daman: 4@H has the same guess as overtricks in 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  unlucky. This way he runs out of trumps|pg||
nt|henryb:  provided North continues spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  He is also unlucky that the player with the fourth spade has the late club entry|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|westjava: 6-3 fit,drop I think|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|henryb:  There is no defense: in 6N East can try both major suit finesses and the spade finesse wins|pg||
nt|petergill: At another table after the same bidding up to 2@H, Jill Levin bid 4NT (instead of 2NT as here), with her partner Jeff Meckstroth giving a long hard look at 4NT. |pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: Europe disappointed in CR   |pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 14, Bob Hamman was the only player at any of the six tables to find the good endplay. Dave Berkowitz also made 3NT on a @H lead, but on misdefence. |pg||

nt|haans: rehi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: The total of Buffett points over four days is 198. When a team reaches 100 points, it has won the Trophy. |pg||
nt|yvesj49: with BAM bareme ?|pg||
nt|jcwla: So this means Sementa with Meyers, Duboin with B. Levin, Hamman with von Arnim, and Rodwell with Nunes?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event. Have a look|pg||
nt|sybarra: If the scores are tied on 99 each, Europe, who won the trophy in Louisville, will retain it. |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: a wildish hand |pg||

nt|mamos: other tables crashed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: safe flight:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I have the pairings here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: x was rather optimistic, x by W of 2@H was instrumental.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: Whether you bid an immed 3H or 4H on these hands, depends on how much you like 7-4-1-1 shapes|pg||

mb|2C|nt|sybarra: interesting pairings |pg||
nt|yvesj49: not the best par score for NS|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W are three or four down in a major suit contract|pg||
nt|pef: levin bid 1nt there intending to make a three card limit raise in spades|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: leads are 1,3,5 but not easy for W he can see singleton card @D in the declarer |pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: I really think West needs to make a move & X there even with only 2card @S|pg||
nt|bernix: do they use 2@d 3rd suit forcing ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: its a 12 trick contract here on board 15 |pg||
nt|bernix: 6@c is one of two finesses|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: could be in 6NT direct from E|pg||
nt|bernix: if you do not use '3rd suit forcing', what do you bid with jason's hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: as bernard says could bid a 3rd new suit forcing but has in mind 6nt sure |pg||
mb|2D|nt|rv: current running score, 48-36 in favor of US, total of 198 Buffet points at stake over 4 days (till Thr)|pg||
nt|haans: tricky hand South have|pg||
nt|yvesj49: if the defence is perfect, 4 off|pg||
nt|sybarra: might have done better in spades |pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: well judge bernard 2@D came from E|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rv: only 84 decided so far|pg||

nt|Walddk5:  The overall score before this round is USA 85   65 Europe. 100 points wins the cup.|pg||
nt|pef: she faced the problem of penalty doubling 2d or continuing with the limit raise in spades plan.  the former would have been the dinner here, but the vulnerability made it difficult|pg||
nt|pef: 3S also being played at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: looks like a good decision not to sell out to 3@H   but this won't make|pg||

nt|bernix: can saelesminde escape for one down?|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 4 hearts was a good but unmakeable contract- 3D is doomed by 5-0|pg||

mb|4S|nt|mamos: a helpful start |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3nt looks the final resting place|pg||
nt|rado: 5@C only 500|pg||
nt|bernix: similar auction to OR led to same contract|pg||
nt|diumraid: Can Viewgraph Operator Check score on board 1. Bridgemate scoring is saying that 3Nt went -2 as opposed to -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: only think wrong with slam here is lack of aces :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: straight 6 tricks after @S lead. |pg||
nt|rado: OR Helgemo overcalled 2@C|pg||
nt|bernix: chance missed by USA|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Borgeland might have converted plus to minus here|pg||
nt|spooky: he probably did|pg||
nt|spooky: 3@H was a preemptive raise, so 3NT bid is strange, probably Levin is wondering what's going on|pg||
nt|rv: only  7 tricks on double dummy defense, in reality I expect Brogeland to make 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|rv: if Weinstein had doubled which he could have, I am sure Levin will lead a minor|pg||
nt|spooky: if Levin leads a @S, and Brogeland plays spade back directly, Levin needs to switch @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good score in OR.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: will be working for the 7th.|pg||
nt|henryb:  may well make seven as cashing spades will squeeze North|pg||
nt|bernix: with meckstroth constraining him to a weak 2 bid they wont reach slam|pg||
mb|d|nt|odysseus69: and lack of fit|pg||

nt|rv: yes sry even the board|pg||
nt|rv: @c lead would have fetched a point, on @s lead best case scenario for L-W to half the brd|pg||
nt|haans: assume 4@D first 4nt after = do not show @DA|pg||
nt|haans: yes that 2|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 1@d 2@s and 1@c |pg||
nt|sybarra: yeah sure.....|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: did Helness really bid canapé|pg||
nt|westjava: some thing like, after 2@C GF|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT not even certain - communication problems- but probable make|pg||
nt|jcwla: Just as Goldie Hawn in "Seems Like Old Times" was "not outside eating chicken, that's for sure," this contract ain't gonna produce 1430, that's for sure.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Seems like the wires got crossed.|pg||
nt|pef: europe is up 2 to 1 in match A and 3 to 2 in match C, so this round may signal a badly needed comeback for the Europeans|pg||
nt|pef: I believe the score here is 1.5  to 1.5 but we'll see|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a good 4@S from South defending 4@H|pg||

pc|h9|nt|westjava: 3@C, 3@D, 4@S|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|rv: if Brogeland runs the @h suit, Weinstein has enough opportunities to signal @ds|pg||
nt|ady: might now run 8@S  |pg||
nt|jcwla: So on 2, where Duboin went down 4 in 3@H, in the OR it went 2@H around to a double by von Arnim and 2@S by Nunes, making 3 on a 3-3 fit for not enough.  A win to USA there.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pef: hampson can make 5 here for the win, but he'll have to guess remarkably well in trumps to do so|pg||

nt|rv: can't be true|pg||
nt|rv: Weinstein has disc @s and played lo-hi in @hs, not sure if all this indicates @d preference to @cs|pg||
nt|rv: this is assuming Levin wins @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Mike Gold|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi venky and Roland|pg||
nt|spooky: he played spades 6-5 and @H 7-J, don't think there was suit preference somewhere, not sure tho|pg||
nt|spooky: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: and gernbrand |pg||
nt|rv: thinking aloud, would it helped Weinstein to play @Hj and @hx to indicate @d preference|pg||
nt|rv: not sure of their SP methods, many partnerships play smith-echo or rev smith-echo in nt contracts to indicate continuation of suit or shifts in obvious / non-obvious suits|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure Levin-Weinstein have detailed defensive agreements, this deal will test those agreements|pg||
nt|rv: he needs to win @SA though:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I see i have arrived at the kill point|pg||
nt|spooky: winning @SA is not the problem I think.. i think he is wondering what to switch|pg||

nt|odysseus69: no score for board 3 from open room - did I see 4Dx -2|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now North is in real trouble|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: ½ a point|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pef: well now that won't happen, so a win for europe on the board and they go up by a board with 2 to go|pg||
nt|bernix: i think the same sacrifice will be found in OR|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 4@H= can be made +1 could be a push to 5@H = making |pg||
mb|1N|nt|rnmalik: yes, think so.|pg||
nt|henryb:  he has corrected it. thank you|pg||
nt|bernix: europe still needs a halved board to clinch the match|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|kiwi_joker: EW should finish in 4@S here|pg||
nt|mamos: another board where there maybe competition for the part score|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think its quite there|pg||
nt|henryb:  operator, if the play went as shown, declarer lost 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: yes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: undo.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: they have to stop giving beer to the operator lol|pg||
nt|pef: 4S making 5 is a very good result for the europeans at the other table|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: bad news foe Europe then 6nt is cold |pg||
mb|4S|nt|odysseus69: what lead from West?|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Me, or your lying eyes?"|pg||
nt|bernix: very aggressive double by saelesminde|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 4 card M|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: lot tougher to make 10 tricks in @h tricks|pg||
nt|rv: @h strain|pg||
nt|westjava: 23 hcp and 1nt makes 10 after @D lead at other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@c "inverted; shows about 10+ points in support of clubs, no four+ card major|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes @H lead and 10 @D to Ace@D, making five.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: Jason didnt open the South hand  at another table    |pg||
nt|spooky: I wouldn't pass with a 7crd suit in this situation.. would you?|pg||
nt|lestergold: my dog says he would rebid 7 card suit|pg||
nt|rv: I expect another brd for Europe here to tie the match|pg||
nt|rv: I would bid 2@s as well with Levin's hand, his hand not worth much except in @s strain|pg||
nt|rv: really surprised by his pass|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H should make e/w with A@S right|pg||
nt|yvesj49: part score @s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H also I think |pg||
nt|yvesj49: yes|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: board 17 4@S= 420 making 10|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he might claim directly|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kiwi_joker: Duboin's pass of 3@S influencd by the type of scoring, I guess (BAM). Certainly a hand you'd want to be in game on, in IMPs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: suicide bomber just arrived|pg||
nt|haans: best you can say about that double: Ricking the boat|pg||
nt|jcwla: And by  part score we mean game.|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@s is splinter: singleton or void|pg||
nt|bernix: looks like usa have drury on their cc|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: odds for 120|pg||
nt|haans: Rocking|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@c is a decent contract: needs club finesse|pg||

nt|rv: Hi all|pg||
nt|rv: great comeback by Europe this morning|pg||
nt|ady: hi rv|pg||
nt|rv: Europe were down 20-40 last night at end of Pairs rounds, they have nearly levelled the match|pg||
nt|rv: Hi David, Diarmuid and all specs|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i don't think levin has gone to sleep  he desperately wants to find a way to beat the hand but alas, ther is no such way|pg||
nt|drewsky: Thats right, this is just like an NBA game.|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Irwin|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Drew |pg||
nt|hedyg: good afternoon :)|pg||
nt|drewsky: HIYA Hedy |pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon Hedy|pg||
nt|rv: irrespective of Pairs, Teams or Individual, you won't regular MPs or IMPs, all scoring is on BAM style 2-1-0 per board converted to Buffet Points|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: Levin could have left Weinstein in hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: its called "Brains" in these parts ...|pg||
nt|yvesj49: ??|pg||
nt|bernix: if he is hungry and is looing forward to the lunch break|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|haans: america closing in|pg||
nt|odysseus69: disrupting the oppo from 1NT is a popular pairs idea but there are limits and this is really stretching the concept|pg||
nt|haans: some say in MP you lose it you let them play 1nt|pg||
nt|haans: thats why DONT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I was interested to see what Helgemo would lead v 1NT - Helness spoiled it|pg||
nt|westjava: even DONT or CAPP, I didnt bid any thing with E hand|pg||
nt|haans: give the 1100|pg||
nt|westjava: a disaster|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Break for lunch after this set. Restart at 14.00 BST, in about 1 hour and 5 minutes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: defence had some chance of keeping this to nine  tricks on Club leads  but ten more likely|pg||
nt|rv: Geoff Boycott's|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need to guess the qx of spades I think to make this |pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: discard a dim|pg||
nt|chick: from N's point of view, E may not have an entry to the last club|pg||
nt|haans: but does not no if to play @D or not|pg||
pc|h8|nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|haans: @D = jump this suit|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder what the @D3 actually means in their signal system|pg||
nt|haans: you do not kill the diamond suit yourselve if good in diamond|pg||
nt|rnmalik: It has to be a shift and @S looks reasonable.|pg||
nt|chick: that's the question Rashed, does it just ask for a shift, or does it indicate which suit.   |pg||
nt|chick: and if you were sitting S, which suit would you want to signal for?  :)|pg||
nt|haans: Weistein can have max 2 hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo 3NT makes as the cards are.|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is a "6 or 4" hand|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|haans: Weinstein|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cant pitch any of the majors please.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: lol|pg||
nt|spooky: this board will be a win to europe to tie this match.|pg||
nt|rv: he needs to make all tricks to salvage this brd, even Houdini can't do that|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rv: this form of scoring is toughest to play, even more so than MPs where field evens you a bit|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chick: Keep in mind that this is BAM, which means an extra trick wins the hand.|pg||
nt|chick: This is the most tense form of bridge, because even a tiny mistake can make the difference in a full win or loss of the board point|pg||
nt|jcwla: It just got easier.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I am result oriented:)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|rv: of Weinstein doesn't know the result in OR and is trying his best to make the best of a inferior contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think he must have had the same thoughtas 3 commentators|pg||
nt|rv: most bridge events is not palyed in Barometric style of scoring, hence players don't know result till they play all deals in a session/round/segment|pg||
nt|rv: are not played|pg||
nt|spooky: I played board a match once, and it's really fun, but you have no idea what they do at the other table, because everybody is trying to score the point every board..|pg||
nt|rv: yes Hop, this form of scoring is most definitely bleeding-edge, a bit tougher than even MPs where field does protect you to some extent|pg||
nt|ady: should quicken now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A@H and another would restrict the declarer to the contract.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yvesj49: lol simon after work now only diet coke lol|pg||
nt|pef: not making 5 now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no|pg||
nt|pef: as long as east covers one of the diamonds|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chick: so would just about any other lead, I think.  She has played this beautifully to make the opps help|pg||
nt|henryb:  IMO 3N is easily down after a spade lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Take 3@S and a @C.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: K of @D with Rodwell  might get easier,  |pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: dropped QS ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 3, the auction of 1NT-swish duplicated in the OR but Nunes failed by 1, so another win for USA.|pg||

nt|rv: every match in Teams and Pairs is worth 4 Buffet points, this round has 3 matches and worth 12 Buffet points|pg||
nt|rv: if BAM score is tied at 6-6, each team gets 2 Buffet points each, else winning team in a match in a round gets 4 BPs|pg||

nt|bernix: last hand for this session|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3NT shows AKQ in the suit |pg||

mb|p|nt|bernix: lucky 6@s but not biddable|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Bufett and not buffet, it says I am hungry:)|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|westjava: now, an easy bid and play in 4@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can declarer find spade queen for the overtrick - thats what this board is|pg||
nt|westjava: yes|pg||
nt|haans: but he wont|pg||
nt|westjava: by dropping:)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: SIMON you can drink a beer in 5 minutes lol|pg||
nt|drewsky: Not strange. Sementa reasoned that if Rodwell, who has already showed up with the king @D, might have repsoned with the Queen of @S as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: these guys are playing really fast ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no way to find the @H lead that beats this|pg||
nt|drewsky: how can he make it on any lead, Hedy ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no he cant sry, Nunes wont cover the @d|pg||
nt|rv: @ds are 3-0 else this lead will sell|pg||
nt|haans: 1 down 200 p|pg||
nt|haans: good lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5Cx is a save and they may well try that|pg||
nt|bernix: vonarnim too|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: think West did also |pg||
nt|bernix: no double|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no trouble |pg||
pc|cK|nt|spooky: good results for Europe from the open room|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|lestergold: i assume 1n here ... both minors?|pg||
nt|spooky: I guess natural? |pg||
nt|yvesj49: Q@d strange acrd i meant drew|pg||
nt|sybarra: this table is sprint speed for sure |pg||
nt|yvesj49: card*|pg||
nt|henryb:  Last board at this table. Both other matches are still early and in doubt|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mamos: West's play of the Club combination was something improving players might like to consider --- making three tricks in the suit by leading towards his honours twice|pg||
nt|rv: now declarer rates to go 2 down?|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,a good save|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6-board sets of 25 minutes -- a little slice of heaven.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Seemingly a freeroll for Europe here.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|spooky: it can be both... |pg||
nt|rv: I think Weinstein bid it as natural|pg||
nt|lestergold: natural pasrtner makes takeout doubel i have two other suits bid neither?|pg||
nt|rv: showing 5-7 hcp with @s stopper|pg||
nt|bernix: 3n cold from south hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kiwi_joker: diamond pips are interesting|pg||
nt|spooky: he didn't know which 1 to bid?|pg||
nt|haans: rare 4@C with 2 defensive tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now declarer may get spades right- North sounds like a singleton somewhere|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would lose 2 Aces, am I right?|pg||
nt|stigw: 4 H might have beeen a good sacrif.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mamos: declarer has some work to do |pg||
nt|sybarra: and watch this one get claimed rather quickly also |pg||
nt|yvesj49: you have extra if you play fast ? lol|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thx Roland, Simon, Shirley, Yves, Rashed, Drew, all kibs.|pg||
nt|sybarra: extra time for the beer :)|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: push|pg||
nt|irwinbo: would all of you bd 3nt opposite a modern 3d bid?|pg||
nt|bernix: does he make his contract now?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|westjava: 1 point to europe:)|pg||
nt|bernix: no|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rv: 3-3 after 6 brds scored, good close match exciting for specs|pg||
nt|haans: yes 4@C may be a suicide|pg||
pc|h4|nt|drewsky: 100% to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rv: second seat pre-empts are generally sound, but at these colors could be shaded|pg||
nt|rv: if 3@d red in second seat, I would bid 3n|pg||
nt|drewsky: The biggest reason to bid 3NT is that the opponents mught compete in hearts|pg||
nt|rv: at these colors, I will consider a pass|pg||
nt|ady: you lack quick tricks out side diamonds     even if there is sokid diamonds oppsoite   KQJ etc   it seems either a club or heart trick will leave you 1 short|pg||
nt|drewsky: The opponents are cold for 5@C....don't make it easy for them to get there|pg||
nt|ady: club or heart lead |pg||
nt|rv: Fantunes rate to take this atleast 2 down at this stage of play, so Europe may not lose on this board|pg||
nt|ady: thats different if you are bidding to keep them out|pg||
nt|rv: in my experience of watching top level Vu graph, Fantunes are exceptionally good defenders even amongst the elite|pg||
nt|pef: very aggressive 3NT call by levin.  but looks like it will be justified with only 3 hearts available and the spade finesse working|pg||
nt|pef: so looks like this match will end up being a tie|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

pc|s6|nt|rv: Drew has a point|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 4 in the OR, B. Levin made the 3@S rebid predicted in here, and Meyers passed, so already a win for Europe.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 4 is quite agressive|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh was corrected to down 1 in here, so actually a win for USA.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with modern light openings|pg||
nt|yvesj49: eric is about squeezing|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's 5 where USA lost the board in the bidding - Rodwell's understandable raise to 3@D over 2@D was not duplicated by Nunes, so Meyers' second double produced 2@S by Levin, then ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H over Nunes' delayed 3@D.  Meyers did not raise and 3@H the final contract so a win to Europe.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|ady: auction was the same in OR except east doubled the 3NT    |pg||

nt|rv: declarer is squeezed and he may concede 2 @h tricks in the end in addition to 4@cs and a @s|pg||
