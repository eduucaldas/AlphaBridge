mb|1S|nt|roswolf: this could be very feisty|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|2C|nt|roswolf: mostly between north and south|pg||
nt|jtr: Likely to play 4@h i guess  Although maybe not now|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jtr: This would seem to be forcing|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
mb|4C|nt|roswolf: east will have a piece of 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: 4@s maybe has some chance through a trump reduction on a non-trump lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jtr: Well, i think it needs a @s lead to beat 4@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||

nt|haans: Hi Rashed|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Rashed :)|pg||
nt|haans: Sucken have no good bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yesterday, we saw Sabine lead the @ST from KTx of dummy's bid @S suit which held QJ-sixth.  Daniela won the A and returned a low one and declarer understandably pitched a side ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: loser, losing to Sabine's K and could only comment, "That was sexy."|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: just us talking to ourselves :)|pg||
nt|haans: Aucken|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Cornelia and Haans.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: they have landed right|pg||
nt|chick: nice choice by Auken ... with N showing 4 hearts, she chooses to show the diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: von Arnom knows only 40 hcp exist but ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Tricky hand and difficult for W to pass 2@D.|pg||
nt|haans: Arnim|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: simple clubs raise?|pg||
nt|haans: pass a good option|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|chick: N has pretty much described his hand, except for about an A worth of value, but with his partner passing 2@D, I don't think he has much left to say|pg||

nt|yvesj49: hi shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: Hi Hans|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: just a @S p/s for NS?   East took one too many bids|pg||
nt|mamos: yep looks like -300|pg||
nt|daman: difficult to understand whay he would bid 4@C|pg||
nt|daman: siff @S and Qxx of @D is better|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: yep|pg||
pc|d3|nt|spooky: 3NT looks like making, only a @C lead from south would set it.|pg||
nt|daman: t*|pg||
nt|yvesj49: nice event|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kiwi_joker: well you cant really find yourself in a room where 'dud' players are in action ... as this event features 24 of the world's very best|pg||
nt|mamos: are we linked to the correct table ?|pg||
nt|mamos: i thought the twins were always scoring agianst Levin and Weinstein|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: other room looks to have started with a precision 2@C, and someohow they couldnt put the brakes on before reaching a hopelessly optimistic 6C|pg||
nt|spooky: but Brogeland took his "safe"plus scoe in 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: but non vulnerable :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bridge a funny game - Jx of @H's part of the thinking to go back to 2@S but @HJ turns out to be highly useful card.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Indeed eliminates a @D loser, as it is.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yvesj49: where we can see the best world's players|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|spooky: 5@D bid and made at the other table, so first board goes to USA|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Operator, EW are from Norway, not Sweden|pg||

nt|rv: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi all|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hard to stay in a part score on this board|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: 3@C+1@H+2@S=6 -3 I think.|pg||

nt|sybarra: Buffett Cup. In the Pairs, USA won 10 matches and lost 5 to lead 40 - 20.  In the Teams, Europe won 9 matches, tied 2 and lost 7.  That translates to 40 - 32 in Buffett Points and ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: ...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|drewsky: 3NT is certainly the most intersting game contract.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: leaves the totals at 72 -60, with the USA in front|pg||
nt|yvesj49: and the first at 100 win ?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yvesj49: IS IT TRUE ?|pg||

nt|chick: hopefully we'll find out the end result of that board when the operator has time to put it in :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: technical problems - contract is 4S by NS |pg||
nt|haans: If Levin had bid 3@C von Arnim odds to bid 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: new board now|pg||
nt|mamos: just too much from Justin there|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I think so |pg||
nt|jcwla: The N hand playable in three different strains, contains a void, and the @H suit represents a small fraction of its values with nothing on top.  |pg||
nt|yvesj49: ty rashed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes @@@C and @D.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: shirley*|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sry|pg||
nt|henryb:  good day all|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: bidding 4@C on that hand is like found money for the opps     getting something for nothing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|Walddk5: East is Justin Hackett|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|haans: 6@C possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They are both   J  Hackett|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rv: transfer responses here, 1@h shows 4+@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ady: 4@H can be beateb on spade lead|pg||
nt|drewsky: ONLY if played by south|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good bid west|pg||
nt|yvesj49: NS are out of 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: Individual: Each player on Team Europe is drawn to compare with a particular player on Team USA. A player does not meet the player with whom he or she compar|pg||
nt|yvesj49: WITH 25 COUNT|pg||
nt|yvesj49: if i play i don't want to be compared with fantoni lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or 6@H|pg||
nt|mamos: although  Americans are in 4@C x at the other table|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rv: Brogeland's 1@s denies 4@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Henry, welcome.|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: 1@S shows 3@S|pg||
nt|rv: with 4 he would have jumped to 2@s and with 2 would have rebid 1n or 2m|pg||
mb|3C|nt|spooky: weird that Brogeland didn't open 1NT, they play 15-17...|pg||
nt|rv: Levin-Weinstein compared with Duboin-Sementa and Brogeland-Saelensmide with Sontag-Berk|pg||
nt|rv: play of @h suit critical for OT in this contract|pg||
nt|ady: Europe should win the board 5@C  at least down 2|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D Bourke = just GF bid|pg||
nt|daman: Berkowicz|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: it's about the overtrick in this lay out|pg||
nt|mamos: the scoring method has led to many NT contracts  as players hunt for the magic +10 points|pg||
nt|daman: easy to figure this 3rd and 5th|pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: holy ... 2nt natural?|pg||
nt|chick: looks like just one diamond loser, and perhaps a heart loser|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sound 4@S with @H guess can make 6.|pg||
nt|haans: odds against doing right in hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true. 10 @H very vital card.|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: In every case the four individuals at one table have their corresponding opponent sitting in the same seat at the matching table. |pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Berk made the same bad 4@C bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rv: I presume Levin will duck @h to @hK smoothyl|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Good lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: smoothly|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: nice organization|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: Instead of wishing physical harm on your enemy, just wish that Sabine leads to all their contracts.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwi_joker: unless South is very much asleep when declarer plays a heart from dummy later on, this will go -1|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|spooky: this helps declarer|pg||
nt|rv: after South's @H9, Brogeland may just get it right|pg||
nt|rv: ah, easy now for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Pairs, Teams and Individual events in Warren Buffet Cup, all scoring is BAM style|pg||
nt|rv: so OTs and UTs very crucial, this form of scoring is lot tougher than IMPs and a bit tougher than Pairs (MPs)|pg||
nt|rv: if you make 8 tricks in 2@s and your opps make same 8 tricks in NT, you get 0 BAM points|pg||
nt|haans: 54% for this slam|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event. Have a look|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer will have to sniff out Heart position for a good score|pg||
nt|daman: he will sniff it out by default|pg||
nt|daman: he will not risk his contract   and in so doing will drop the @H King|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That would be +2 and good score.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rv: in Pairs (MPs), the field does protect you a bit|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Haans and every one|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: would have been interesting if KH played on 10H|pg||
nt|mamos: Sontag and Berkowicz in 4@H so looks irrelevant how many tricks   he makes here|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Lilek|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hi Lillek|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Victor,sry late:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: In the Individual each set is of just six deals|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: imo the only lead which sets 4@H.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: is there any reason to get hearts wrong?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: N 's hand is counted 5@S+4@D+2@C +2@H|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|daman: 4@H has the same guess as overtricks in 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  unlucky. This way he runs out of trumps|pg||
nt|henryb:  provided North continues spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  He is also unlucky that the player with the fourth spade has the late club entry|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|westjava: 6-3 fit,drop I think|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|h9|pg||

nt|sybarra: The total of Buffett points over four days is 198. When a team reaches 100 points, it has won the Trophy. |pg||
nt|yvesj49: with BAM bareme ?|pg||
nt|jcwla: So this means Sementa with Meyers, Duboin with B. Levin, Hamman with von Arnim, and Rodwell with Nunes?|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: many double here to say somthing about other suit (normally lead lowest suit)|pg||
nt|jcwla: 12 "berry" suit here: A-10, K-9, Q-6, J-5, T-4, 9-2, 8-1.  In second seat red you might want 18.|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: aggresive 3@S bid|pg||

nt|Walddk5: cards for the Individual and other information|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: a helpful start |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3nt looks the final resting place|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: only think wrong with slam here is lack of aces :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: straight 6 tricks after @S lead. |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|rv: Borgeland might have converted plus to minus here|pg||
nt|spooky: he probably did|pg||
nt|spooky: 3@H was a preemptive raise, so 3NT bid is strange, probably Levin is wondering what's going on|pg||
nt|rv: only  7 tricks on double dummy defense, in reality I expect Brogeland to make 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|rv: if Weinstein had doubled which he could have, I am sure Levin will lead a minor|pg||
nt|spooky: if Levin leads a @S, and Brogeland plays spade back directly, Levin needs to switch @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good score in OR.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: will be working for the 7th.|pg||
nt|henryb:  may well make seven as cashing spades will squeeze North|pg||
pc|sA|nt|odysseus69: and lack of fit|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: declarer has no chance|pg||
nt|jcwla: The surprise lead, eh?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|rv: I expect Levin to get this right and win another point for US here|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|spooky: not a point, -1 is still a 0.5|pg||
nt|rv: yes sry even the board|pg||
nt|rv: @c lead would have fetched a point, on @s lead best case scenario for L-W to half the brd|pg||
nt|haans: assume 4@D first 4nt after = do not show @DA|pg||
nt|haans: yes that 2|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 1@d 2@s and 1@c |pg||
nt|sybarra: yeah sure.....|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: did Helness really bid canapé|pg||
nt|westjava: some thing like, after 2@C GF|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT not even certain - communication problems- but probable make|pg||
nt|jcwla: Just as Goldie Hawn in "Seems Like Old Times" was "not outside eating chicken, that's for sure," this contract ain't gonna produce 1430, that's for sure.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Seems like the wires got crossed.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: with spades 3-3   and hearts 3-2  this looks like 12 tricks|pg||
nt|westjava: 10 tricks after @D lead|pg||
nt|haans: playing clubs to KQ|pg||
nt|yvesj49: yes very surprizing lol|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|westjava: 3@C, 3@D, 4@S|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|rv: if Brogeland runs the @h suit, Weinstein has enough opportunities to signal @ds|pg||
nt|ady: might now run 8@S  |pg||
nt|jcwla: So on 2, where Duboin went down 4 in 3@H, in the OR it went 2@H around to a double by von Arnim and 2@S by Nunes, making 3 on a 3-3 fit for not enough.  A win to USA there.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|rv: srtange|pg||
nt|spooky: oh,,,|pg||
nt|spooky: didn't expect that|pg||
nt|rv: can't be true|pg||
nt|rv: Weinstein has disc @s and played lo-hi in @hs, not sure if all this indicates @d preference to @cs|pg||
nt|rv: this is assuming Levin wins @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Mike Gold|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi venky and Roland|pg||
nt|spooky: he played spades 6-5 and @H 7-J, don't think there was suit preference somewhere, not sure tho|pg||
nt|spooky: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: and gernbrand |pg||
nt|rv: thinking aloud, would it helped Weinstein to play @Hj and @hx to indicate @d preference|pg||
nt|rv: not sure of their SP methods, many partnerships play smith-echo or rev smith-echo in nt contracts to indicate continuation of suit or shifts in obvious / non-obvious suits|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure Levin-Weinstein have detailed defensive agreements, this deal will test those agreements|pg||
nt|rv: he needs to win @SA though:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I see i have arrived at the kill point|pg||
nt|spooky: winning @SA is not the problem I think.. i think he is wondering what to switch|pg||
nt|rv: yes Mike, you can give your perspective on carding agreements|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|rv: I much like play suggested by Hop, play second @s early|pg||
nt|spooky: wow, it's made now|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: going for maximum|pg||

nt|odysseus69: spaded best now from South|pg||
nt|odysseus69: better-cash heart|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no score for board 3 from open room - did I see 4Dx -2|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now North is in real trouble|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: ½ a point|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c7|nt|rv: even the best can get it wrong, some consolation for lesser mortals like us|pg||
nt|westjava: I think connection not so good from the hotel (Miskin Manor Hotel, near Cardiff)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: might settle for 11 |pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: well i dont know what happened earlier in the hand but my dog says 2 men play same suit one man crazy|pg||
nt|jcwla: With AT7 of @H's and two cards below a 7, 2NT by von Arnim looks pretty good in the rearview mirror.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: as was made in OR|pg||
nt|yvesj49: !!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|westjava: 3 points after 3 boards, very dominant europe on this table!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: declarer does not know where club ace is or that spades are breaking- he may be worried|pg||
nt|westjava: they are having a few technical problems, sorry for this inconvinience...|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now N-S are in charge|pg||

nt|westjava: cash @H and give @C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or play club- he cant go wrong as cards lie|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: stress here is getting to the players - calling for water and pills!!!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rv: Brogeland could have won BAM point easily by passing 3@s and getting a plus, he has won it the hard way by bidding and making 3n|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: no   getting 12    Europe wins the board|pg||

nt|odysseus69: I was interested to see what Helgemo would lead v 1NT - Helness spoiled it|pg||
nt|westjava: even DONT or CAPP, I didnt bid any thing with E hand|pg||
nt|haans: give the 1100|pg||
nt|westjava: a disaster|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: defence had some chance of keeping this to nine  tricks on Club leads  but ten more likely|pg||
nt|rv: Geoff Boycott's|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need to guess the qx of spades I think to make this |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: discard a dim|pg||
nt|chick: from N's point of view, E may not have an entry to the last club|pg||
nt|haans: but does not no if to play @D or not|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|haans: @D = jump this suit|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder what the @D3 actually means in their signal system|pg||
nt|haans: you do not kill the diamond suit yourselve if good in diamond|pg||
nt|rnmalik: It has to be a shift and @S looks reasonable.|pg||
nt|chick: that's the question Rashed, does it just ask for a shift, or does it indicate which suit.   |pg||
nt|chick: and if you were sitting S, which suit would you want to signal for?  :)|pg||
nt|haans: Weistein can have max 2 hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo 3NT makes as the cards are.|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is a "6 or 4" hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: Weinstein|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cant pitch any of the majors please.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: lol|pg||
nt|spooky: this board will be a win to europe to tie this match.|pg||
nt|rv: he needs to make all tricks to salvage this brd, even Houdini can't do that|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|rv: this form of scoring is toughest to play, even more so than MPs where field evens you a bit|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: Keep in mind that this is BAM, which means an extra trick wins the hand.|pg||
nt|chick: This is the most tense form of bridge, because even a tiny mistake can make the difference in a full win or loss of the board point|pg||
nt|jcwla: It just got easier.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I am result oriented:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rv: of Weinstein doesn't know the result in OR and is trying his best to make the best of a inferior contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think he must have had the same thoughtas 3 commentators|pg||
nt|rv: most bridge events is not palyed in Barometric style of scoring, hence players don't know result till they play all deals in a session/round/segment|pg||
nt|rv: are not played|pg||
nt|spooky: I played board a match once, and it's really fun, but you have no idea what they do at the other table, because everybody is trying to score the point every board..|pg||
nt|rv: yes Hop, this form of scoring is most definitely bleeding-edge, a bit tougher than even MPs where field does protect you to some extent|pg||
nt|ady: should quicken now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A@H and another would restrict the declarer to the contract.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yvesj49: lol simon after work now only diet coke lol|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|chick: so would just about any other lead, I think.  She has played this beautifully to make the opps help|pg||
nt|henryb:  IMO 3N is easily down after a spade lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Take 3@S and a @C.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: K of @D with Rodwell  might get easier,  |pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: dropped QS ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 3, the auction of 1NT-swish duplicated in the OR but Nunes failed by 1, so another win for USA.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
pc|c9|nt|yvesj49: stange 1st trick.....|pg||
nt|sybarra: wd to Sememta |pg||
nt|yvesj49: str*|pg||

nt|rv: every match in Teams and Pairs is worth 4 Buffet points, this round has 3 matches and worth 12 Buffet points|pg||
nt|rv: if BAM score is tied at 6-6, each team gets 2 Buffet points each, else winning team in a match in a round gets 4 BPs|pg||
nt|chick: dummy was irrelevant by then|pg||
nt|haans: agreeing to 800 good bridge :(|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and last bd of this first set in the indy |pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|rv: Bufett and not buffet, it says I am hungry:)|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|westjava: now, an easy bid and play in 4@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can declarer find spade queen for the overtrick - thats what this board is|pg||
nt|westjava: yes|pg||
nt|haans: but he wont|pg||
nt|westjava: by dropping:)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: SIMON you can drink a beer in 5 minutes lol|pg||
nt|drewsky: Not strange. Sementa reasoned that if Rodwell, who has already showed up with the king @D, might have repsoned with the Queen of @S as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: these guys are playing really fast ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no way to find the @H lead that beats this|pg||
nt|drewsky: how can he make it on any lead, Hedy ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no he cant sry, Nunes wont cover the @d|pg||
nt|rv: @ds are 3-0 else this lead will sell|pg||
nt|haans: 1 down 200 p|pg||
nt|haans: good lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5Cx is a save and they may well try that|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: good results for Europe from the open room|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: i assume 1n here ... both minors?|pg||
nt|spooky: I guess natural? |pg||
nt|yvesj49: Q@d strange acrd i meant drew|pg||
nt|sybarra: this table is sprint speed for sure |pg||
nt|yvesj49: card*|pg||
nt|henryb:  Last board at this table. Both other matches are still early and in doubt|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: West's play of the Club combination was something improving players might like to consider --- making three tricks in the suit by leading towards his honours twice|pg||
nt|rv: now declarer rates to go 2 down?|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,a good save|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6-board sets of 25 minutes -- a little slice of heaven.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Seemingly a freeroll for Europe here.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|spooky: it can be both... |pg||
nt|rv: I think Weinstein bid it as natural|pg||
nt|lestergold: natural pasrtner makes takeout doubel i have two other suits bid neither?|pg||
nt|rv: showing 5-7 hcp with @s stopper|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: diamond pips are interesting|pg||
nt|spooky: he didn't know which 1 to bid?|pg||
nt|haans: rare 4@C with 2 defensive tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now declarer may get spades right- North sounds like a singleton somewhere|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would lose 2 Aces, am I right?|pg||
nt|stigw: 4 H might have beeen a good sacrif.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mamos: declarer has some work to do |pg||
nt|sybarra: and watch this one get claimed rather quickly also |pg||
nt|yvesj49: you have extra if you play fast ? lol|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thx Roland, Simon, Shirley, Yves, Rashed, Drew, all kibs.|pg||
nt|sybarra: extra time for the beer :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcwla: Well, there may come a time when E has to take the @SA or lose it.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: well done|pg||
nt|lestergold: well landed in only sane spot|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: push|pg||
nt|irwinbo: would all of you bd 3nt opposite a modern 3d bid?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|westjava: 1 point to europe:)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rv: 3-3 after 6 brds scored, good close match exciting for specs|pg||
nt|haans: yes 4@C may be a suicide|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|drewsky: 100% to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rv: second seat pre-empts are generally sound, but at these colors could be shaded|pg||
nt|rv: if 3@d red in second seat, I would bid 3n|pg||
nt|drewsky: The biggest reason to bid 3NT is that the opponents mught compete in hearts|pg||
nt|rv: at these colors, I will consider a pass|pg||
nt|ady: you lack quick tricks out side diamonds     even if there is sokid diamonds oppsoite   KQJ etc   it seems either a club or heart trick will leave you 1 short|pg||
nt|drewsky: The opponents are cold for 5@C....don't make it easy for them to get there|pg||
nt|ady: club or heart lead |pg||
nt|rv: Fantunes rate to take this atleast 2 down at this stage of play, so Europe may not lose on this board|pg||
nt|ady: thats different if you are bidding to keep them out|pg||
nt|rv: in my experience of watching top level Vu graph, Fantunes are exceptionally good defenders even amongst the elite|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: Fantunes play reverse Smith |pg||
nt|yvesj49: ty jordan|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mamos: this was just always going off in the real world |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yes, no chance now. Needed to find a double-dummy line of playing trumps (leading high ones from hand to pin East's 9) to keep trump losers to one|pg||
nt|drewsky: Its a 2 way bid...I might make OR they might make.....but I am sick if I let them get to 3@H|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect we are back fairly quickly |pg||
pc|c9|nt|yvesj49: he could drink a big one lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Would lose a @C and a @H.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|rv: in last round, we had match between Zia-Hamman, Meckwell against Fantunes, Von Arnim-Auken decided on last board|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: Drew has a point|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 4 in the OR, B. Levin made the 3@S rebid predicted in here, and Meyers passed, so already a win for Europe.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 4 is quite agressive|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh was corrected to down 1 in here, so actually a win for USA.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with modern light openings|pg||
nt|yvesj49: eric is about squeezing|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcwla: It's 5 where USA lost the board in the bidding - Rodwell's understandable raise to 3@D over 2@D was not duplicated by Nunes, so Meyers' second double produced 2@S by Levin, then ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H over Nunes' delayed 3@D.  Meyers did not raise and 3@H the final contract so a win to Europe.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: auction was the same in OR except east doubled the 3NT    |pg||
nt|yvesj49: 3 rounds of @s|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rv: I expect Fantoni to end-play declarer for 3 down|pg||
nt|hedyg: declarer is squeezed now|pg||
nt|rv: declarer is squeezed and he may concede 2 @h tricks in the end in addition to 4@cs and a @s|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|yvesj49: east discards 2@h|pg||
nt|yvesj49: west 2@c|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: looks like -3|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|rv: yes, looks like 2 point lead for Europe at half-way stage of this match|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome back to Peter Lund|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: Fantoni should have count of declarer's hand|pg||
