mb|4D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 5@D is pretty cheap, 300|pg||
nt|dburn: and maybe 4@d gave North some licence to save if he wanted to|pg||
nt|mdgraham: club, heart, and two spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but either it didn't, or he didn't want to|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: You usually do not save at equal vulnerability. That North hand is very flat|pg||

nt|othered1: Vytas currently leads this event, 4 VP ahead of second place Zaleski|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: ah start with a slam.|pg||
nt|haans: Lauria-Verscae among the participants. They are on the Zaleski team. http://www.sportbridge.lt/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=744&Itemid=177 Hold your mouse over the ...|pg||
nt|haans: team names to see player names|pg||
nt|andersk: I like to open 15-17 NT with east hand here|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|haans: right now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 1 strongish NT is certainly possible here, if your system allows it.  Mine doesn't with M 2-2.|pg||
nt|andersk: In Lithuania many probably play polish club, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: Results can be seen here  http://www.pzbs.pl//wyniki/turnieje/2010/wilno/team/teamleaderb.html|pg||
nt|ybob: yes polish|pg||
nt|andersk: was 1 @H alerted?|pg||

nt|othered1: EW now will have plenty of room to find their @H game|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rnmalik: 6@S makes imo.|pg||
nt|haans: but not 6@H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No:)|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like a transfer to @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: I think it wasnt|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: would have expected North to do something, even if 1@d could be only three cards|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: life is not fair|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: EW doing their best to push them to 6.|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no alert, but W looks angry|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: Sorry it was alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: short 1 trick i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: And it was a transfer to spades|pg||
nt|andersk: strange 2 NT, imo|pg||
nt|othered1: Very aggressive, if natural (unless it shows 17-18 or so)|pg||
nt|ybob: upgrade |pg||
nt|dburn: but it probably would not matter all that much what he did|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andersk: upgrade when you got a double behind you, still strange|pg||
nt|othered1: 8 tricks and needs help for a chance at 9|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe 1@H shows values too 7+ and E shows 18 hcp bal|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andersk: I dont count as well as you, Ed!  I can only count 6 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: well not easy|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: 2 Aces and a K with N and pass. Otherwise difficult to visulise the hand with S.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: some say never lead singel with singel trumph|pg||
nt|othered1: north shows his "entry" in @D?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h looks like 10 tricks and a save in 5@c looks correct|pg||
nt|othered1: I think it's take it or lose it in @D right now.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry 5@d - misclich - a bad keyboard|pg||
nt|ralfwil: look at this  - MISCLICK:)|pg||
nt|othered1: doesn't it look like @D underlead is the only likely way to beat it?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|rnmalik: absolutely correct.|pg||
nt|ybob: i think 2NT probably denies 3@S|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andersk: :)|pg||

nt|dburn: may save the overtrick if East puts the queen on this|pg||
nt|vugraphzsb: they explain, that 3D mens short diamonds :)|pg||
nt|dburn: which is more or less standard operating procedure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good point|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It costs nothing to insert the queen|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If partner has it, it holds, and if declarer has it he is going to score the king anyway|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dburn: well, it sometimes confuses partner if he is the one who gets in first|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: The upside is that declarer can't afford to duck|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

mc|9|nt|dburn: mind you, if instead West had just led fourth highest from his longest and strongest, that might have saved more than an overtrick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, I am not really interested in what GIB says|pg||
nt|dburn: moreover, if East had played the ace and shifted to diamonds...|pg||

nt|april7: weak 2 opener|pg||
nt|haans: re all|pg||
nt|ybob: can declarer have J @C and play A at trick 1 ?|pg||
nt|andersk: yes, If he is afraid a switch, but this time, no!|pg||
nt|othered1: Unlikely, and at matchpoints something on which to act,perhaps.  But it's nice to ensure you beat games at imps|pg||
nt|ybob: with JXXXX and JXX its impossible|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Tez|pg||

nt|andersk: 1 NT is my kinda style:)|pg||
nt|ybob: i like X but ...|pg||
nt|othered1: it's 14+.  If within my range, certainly.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: For me an opening on S - yes|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Mike :)  welcome|pg||
nt|ybob: always with 4/4 MÂ´s|pg||
nt|tez: if 1nt is 15-17 i prefer to open 1nt|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd upgrade if my 1N was 12-14|pg||
nt|othered1: But 3N should be bid using most methods.  NOrth's hand isn't exactly a distributed 10-count, it's an opening by old Culberston standards.|pg||
nt|tez: polish players mostly lead 2-4|pg||
pc|s9|nt|april7: @D ace and J for @H shift|pg||
nt|h_karluk: owerwhelming defence|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: thats better |pg||
nt|sybarra: assuming Q |pg||
nt|othered1: He'll go after @H tricks|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|haans: for beginners 3NT did show spades or he should not have bid Stayman|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|haans: double finesse in @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: why not take the @C hook? |pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: well can you see a better bid for Kartanas? :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: what am I missing |pg||
nt|haans: OT just falling|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe I played too loing with Aunt MInnie |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: no hearts so ...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tez: take this trick and after it there is 2 way.First play @dT or A of @h|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|haans: bobholl: was it canape or just inspired ME: good question no answer|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: I think your Aunt Minnie had the right idea|pg||
nt|sybarra: of course she always played for 2/2,  (when the experts went down)  she cracked me up |pg||
nt|mdgraham: it is a safety play, of sorts, catering for @CK singleton offside|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree. |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|dburn: less dangerous when East is a passed hand, and West's opening is very likely to be a weak no trump|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|haans: good play|pg||
nt|othered1: Wow, did Versace really not cover?|pg||
mc|10|nt|tez: it was dangereous and really very interesting|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If Lauria misses that, I think we are in good company|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: well, you can expect declarer to have quite good diamonds on the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Correct|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it is becoming increasingly frequent these days for someone to show a shortage in response to 1NT, for partner to bid 3NT anyway, and for the opening lead not to be dummy's ...|pg||
nt|dburn: shortage|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A South player who wants to play 3NT opposite a singleton usually has the suit well stopped|pg||
nt|dburn: and in my recent experience (three hands in the English Premier League last weekend) it was invariably right to lead dummy's shortage|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it's a bit of a coup if you haven't, and get away with it because they think you have|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|dburn: this being a case in point - if the bidding had just been 1NT-3NT, West would have led a diamond|pg||

nt|haans: backway play|pg||
nt|sybarra: 8 bd matches are a challenge,  you need to score (or not lose)  fast |pg||
nt|dburn: well, given that he made game opposite a six count, maybe his hand wasn't so bad after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: He could have covered and claimed.  Here a brilliancy from east with Qxx would have put  him down|pg||
nt|tez: if west had AJXX @h it would down|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|haans: i have seen players using Stayman 1nter bid 2@H and bidding to 6nt missing spades :)|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, a 6-count that produced 3 tricks against defense to 1N, not 3N.|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|suketbombi: 2@H seems to be a openeing hand looks like is 1@H a denail?|pg||
nt|haans: yes short matches more like MP|pg||
nt|sybarra: East finding this bidding "fascinating" |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: maybe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h10 was a nice card|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: East will have a problem if West doubles |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: however, he hasn't. |pg||
nt|othered1: Of course, south is at the table and we're not. |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: the ended right FAST|pg||
nt|dburn: curious - would have expected West to raise clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: this time 4@S by transfer played by W|pg||
nt|othered1: which trump do you lead?|pg||
nt|tez: i bid 2@S over 2@d with north hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: original East bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: MIlner,  with smile says "thx pard" |pg||
nt|mdgraham: I confess I would double with that West hand|pg||

nt|othered1: so  do I|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: Does anyone know anything about there system?|pg||

pc|d2|nt|suketbombi: yes  on a @S lead declerer wud have been scared of East hand but he well placed now|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if south could have doubled negatively on second round?|pg||
nt|andersk: I would|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|april7: EW could try for slam, |pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|andersk: FIFO|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: Even with the ominous @S stiff, I'd double, t hen backpedal the rest of the way|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|andersk: why do you want a ruff with KTx in @D?|pg||

nt|ybob: other move was K @D|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|haans: down to NT play|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps what he wants to do is force declarer to draw trumps, so that his side can cash more than two club tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|andersk: 2 ruffs, when partner passed 2 @C, I doubt it|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: can E get the ruff?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: easy play|pg||
nt|suketbombi: may end up lossing 2/3 imps on this bd west by no strech of Imagination had an Vul vs NV over call with that hand|pg||
nt|haans: rite u r :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: i wonder why he did not to for 800+|pg||
nt|rnmalik: claim time.|pg||
nt|othered1: a low ruff and later trump trick, rather|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h3|nt|april7: if possible to show singleton @C, but W to strong in singleton suit, so invitation rejected|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told  pszczoÂ³a=bee in english:)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: or perhaps he hoped that West's third trump would be a little higher than the four, so that he could promote it with a fourth round of clubs|pg||

nt|andersk: 4@S makes on a @H lead|pg||
nt|dburn: interesting choice, that double, but it will get spades into the game|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: not a chance the bid dim|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with @dA on side, a nice game|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I agree Ed. not so easy:)|pg||
nt|othered1: North is worth a short suit try, if available.  Otherwise, tougher|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But as I play- 2@c as S and after that rather easy to valur Ns hand|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: 3@D in my book extra + GF|pg||
nt|haans: good @H bid :(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW may make 9 tricks at NT, difficult to bid.|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt to hard|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks standard auction for all of us |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: unfortunately it will also put North on lead, and he will not lead a heart|pg||
nt|othered1: and you need @S lead to beat 5@H.  But played from north, that's likely|pg||
nt|dburn: but South may bid - he doesn't know he can beat four spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: my keyboard again - value....|pg||

nt|h_karluk: *then|pg||
nt|april7: if E could have shown the singleton @C and the hands fit, then slam miight be possible|pg||
nt|haans: and now spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: classic 3x duck |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and the invite bid from me as N is any minor, not 3@s|pg||
nt|othered1: But they are leading the event, so these types of tactics must have a payoff somewhere|pg||
nt|othered1: I like 3@S if simply quantitative, looking for trumps and winners.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|suketbombi: 6@D is a good contract  needs 3-2 @Ds and a little bit more a good payoff but the problem is how do you get there?|pg||
nt|haans: had anyone done better?|pg||
nt|ybob: a clear @D move now|pg||

nt|dburn: normal to go right in clubs - but not so normal to be in a slam, which is pretty horrible on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|dburn: 1@d shows hearts, so 1@h is a kind of diamond raise|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|dburn: and I suppose South might just bid a slam anyway - he won't know that North has @sQ instead of @cQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: i think South's double showed hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: or North might have two clubs rather than three, though this is contra-indicated by that 4@d bid|pg||

nt|Walddk2: When he sees @CA under a top honour, he will let the 10 run next|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sees @CQ|pg||

mb|4D|nt|dburn: spirited stuff by East here, who seems to like bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|sybarra: this should end up a push |pg||
nt|othered1: This south will consider how he makes 7 with 4-0 split and won't go wrong.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: But 7 is tricky to bid.  That 5th @S in north hand is invaluable.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that is to make the correct ruff in @h and keep entries on hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: unlucky with the @s split compensated with 3-3 in @h|pg||
nt|othered1: anyone translate the auction?  Is it relatively natural?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks very natural for me|pg||
nt|tez: maybe 2nt shows @sfit|pg||
nt|tez: if not..bad bid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: club now,  might get ruff later by S |pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence can get @HA, trump and a club ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: but oh well  |pg||
nt|othered1: NS probably were making 3@H on the auction, maybe even 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: cash all high cards and then cross ruff|pg||
nt|tez: ohh noo|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|mdgraham: but not now|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: sad when your ruff with your trumph tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part of the game:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: Results can be seen here   http://www.pzbs.pl//wyniki/turnieje/2010/wilno/team/teamleaderb.html|pg||
nt|rnmalik: next please.|pg||
nt|haans: North may get atrick for @CT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: astonished if not 7@s now|pg||
mb|5N|nt|april7: @S was not the best idea but defence helps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but not now|pg||
nt|tez: 5ny 6@c =@c king and 7@s?|pg||
nt|tez: ny=NT|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i say nice opps:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Since north doesn't know -- does he -- that south has @D controlled, that's an interesting choice|pg||
mb|p|pc|c7|nt|Walddk4: http://www.pzbs.pl//wyniki/turnieje/2010/wilno/team/teamleaderb.html   Lauria-Verscae among the participants. They are on the Zaleski team. Hold your mouse over the team names and ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: you will see the player names|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps they were, since West would doubtless have led a spade - but even so, South might have lost a trick in the suit anyway|pg||
nt|ybob: wasted values QJ@S, J @H , J @C and J @D here|pg||
nt|othered1: east would have been on lead against @H|pg||
nt|dburn: so he would, sorry|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: the "aha" moment |pg||

pc|cT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: now @sQ is importaht|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|othered1: Is it meaningful that north bid @D, his long suit, first and got to 7@S, while in OR @S were bid first and they got to 6?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: WD!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tez: wd to versace|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: still, he would certainly have led a spade, and that would have done in the whole suit|pg||
nt|othered1: so this comes up a push|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: and @s8 on hand is also a nice card. If Q9876|pg||

mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: 1NT is 15-17 for E-W|pg||
mb|2H!|an|spades|nt|Walddk2: If North interferes, Lauria will transfer into his clubs|pg||
mb|2N|an| |mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2NT is a transfer to 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which West can break if he wishes|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|Walddk2: and he did|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the idea with this sort of overcall is that if partner completes the transfer and it is passed out, the strong NT bidder is on lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@D shows a maximum hand with good club support, 3@S asking for a stopper|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx Mike and Hans,  great fun as always |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: the cards shown is one of the many to stay low|pg||

nt|sybarra: looks like 10  |pg||
nt|haans: possibiltys for endplay |pg||
nt|sybarra: bit dicey isnt it?|pg||
nt|haans: 4th spades for clubs return|pg||
nt|dburn: but East might take a shot at 3NT at the vulnerability|pg||
nt|ybob: easy X from W with a limited hand values|pg||
nt|dburn: even though he would not be on lead against 3@c|pg||
nt|andersk: I noticed the 3 @CX should have been made at the other table, with that deefence that was played|pg||
nt|othered1: 5 imps to Vytas, when east with the 7-4 hand on board 12 overcalled in @D and wound up in 5@DX, with @S never bid.|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly it appeared to have a chance|pg||
nt|ybob: @H lead defeat easy|pg||
nt|andersk: trumph reduction and promotion of @C 9 |pg||
nt|dburn: but so does 3NT, unless South can lead the ten of hearts|pg||
nt|ybob: any @H |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe so|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: am withn Kartanas transfer after NT|pg||
nt|dburn: or on the other hand, maybe not|pg||

nt|dburn: I have every sympathy with a club lead, of course, but I don't quite see why South chose that particular club|pg||
mc|11|nt|haans: Next time Bruin I promise|pg||
nt|andersk: that was 3 @C X from other room:)  If any understood that:)|pg||
