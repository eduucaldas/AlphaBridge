nt|mamos: ah of course if the opp has the wrong declarer   -- we think its Rodwell the play won't work easily either :(|pg||
nt|haans: new for us all :)|pg||

pc|s2|nt|vugraphzrj: Justin asks about carding - didn't hear answer sorry!|pg||
nt|ady: even at this scoring I tht 3NT an unlikely spot    if South had the 4th club this would have been bad for the Hackets|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think "mostly upside down", but I could be wrong|pg||
nt|ady: or could have been|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: 1@S really? How quaint|pg||
nt|mamos: i think the twins are comparing with Levin and weinstein  who are playing Helgemo and Helness who have scored +130 in  3@D|pg||

nt|mcphee: NA style is to o/c with the S hand as opposed to a t/o dble|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: hmmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Mackwell cxomparing with Helgemo|pg||
nt|mamos: the twins play very aggressive 4 card majors  with 1NT 14-16 so open 1M on hands like this routinely|pg||
nt|udo: solid contract,,3@D|pg||
nt|stc: looks like a win for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hey Ant, gl there|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: 1-0 to Europe  as Fantoni Nunes stopped in 2@S in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: even 10 points counts as a win so Justin trying for the NT bonus|pg||

pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: this is a wild contest, reminds me "topgun" movie :) we will see best of bests|pg||

pc|cA|nt|haans: dont understand 2nt at all|pg||

nt|mamos: Fantoni Nunes in 3@C at the paired table   so Bob Hamman need to make to win the board|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: ..and in this form of scoring, losing the board by 10 is same as losing it by 1400 ... its  a minus|pg||

nt|h_karluk: good lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: today bobby levin and alan sontag starred about the opening leads|pg||
nt|oliverc: Difficult to get the hand wrong, though|pg||
nt|udo: if she places @C king with south,,she can win and finesse @H for @C discard,,has to risk diamond to hand and hope they are not 5-0|pg||
nt|stc: the Q is if you take the hook in @h or not|pg||
nt|oliverc: right|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes but @d lead would help declarer, pitches @c|pg||

pc|hK|nt|haans: 6nt not easy|pg||

nt|mamos: Meckstroth Rodwell 's +140 beat Helegemo Helness' 130 on Board 1  to win the first board for them  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: fantoni would obviously try to knock out @h AK|pg||

nt|h_karluk: @cQ lead|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mamos: EW will surely bid and make 4@S here|pg||
nt|udo: same biding so far|pg||

nt|udo: in the other room 2@H-4@H followed now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or @c lead and @h back|pg||

mb|d|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|haans: 4@S no make|pg||
nt|haans: will they land in 3nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrj: board being played with Sontag as N!!!|pg||
nt|oliverc: can they stop at 3@S?|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps they are playing transfer pre-empts|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: honestly surprised to 1@s overcall, 2@s fine in many books, glad Ron Klinger did not see that overcall|pg||
nt|haans: odds for going wrong in spades|pg||
nt|westjava: heheh|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: just three red tricks to lose|pg||

nt|haans: but tempting|pg||

nt|westjava: *for|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but in practice very hard to find @c lead|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: might be tempted to play this one in NT instead of spades, because of the allure of the higher score|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems angels whisper to try 5@d|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt easier to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: most players prefer to pick a M suit opening lead |pg||
nt|mcphee: how hard is it to find A@H lead against 3N?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: diet coke with gree lime time, brb|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *green lime|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kiwi_joker: hmm.. didnt think it would die at the 2 level|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 2@h cue not fit as obv seen, just stopper|pg||
nt|h_karluk: all pass expected here|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|ady: if he could pass 4@D  I am sure he would not on that hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: my guess is that would be the normal opening lead to gambling 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: short spades|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mcphee: then the @C swithc is obvious|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you lose when K onside and p has Q, just give up a trick|pg||
pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: falcons vs pigeons, let's see which wing would rise the trophy|pg||

pc|d7|pg||

pc|h2|nt|mamos: against three NT|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|oliverc: @D, @H, 2 @C and a @S|pg||

nt|mamos: or more if this @DK wins|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers considers @D10|pg||
nt|h_karluk: since 2 boards a tad aggressive approach to cards|pg||

nt|h_karluk: it's|pg||
nt|westjava: switch to @C now|pg||
nt|westjava: or never:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: she would enjoy to @c switch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just low towards hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think this may be a long think|pg||
nt|h_karluk: musing|pg||
nt|mcphee: @C switch would not be welcome at all|pg||

pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/DM1COpeningBid.html  Defense Methods Against 1 Club Opening Bids|pg||

nt|westjava: *Duboin|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: normally many people plays it xfer to spades|pg||
nt|stc: this is how you win 100 times the cavendish|pg||
mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: as Bob read it|pg||
nt|mamos: not necessarily Hamdi  may be cue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if Bob would open 1N then things would be easy, ie uncontested 1N>3@h mild slam invite for clubs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that'|pg||
nt|h_karluk: s also true Mike|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so there's not a novel layout problem, but the matter is to tell yr clubs to partner|pg||
nt|mamos: if you play $C@C for @H and @d for @S  makes sense to play the other way round too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure, you know it all depends partnership agreements|pg||

nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: well  you'd want to be playing with a partner with whom you had very secure agreements on this auction ........|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I don't think anyone has the luxury to take an adventure |pg||
nt|h_karluk: still 6NT, presumably very hard to lead a @d from KJx ternace|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in case 5@s misread|pg||
nt|oliverc: Do we know exactly what 4@H meant?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : tenace|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|haans: that 4@D looks costly|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 2@D shows 9 cards either way|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of bidding on a 20-20 hand|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: surprised they didnt double 4@D (at this form of scoring).|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pass saves the day|pg||
nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: not the fastest auction in the world|pg||

nt|oliverc: -1 now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: but Bob clearly did not|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which in practice as i said very very hard to lead from that KJ9 tenace to set it|pg||
nt|oliverc: indeed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe they were not reading the same book (Bob&Zia)|pg||
nt|oliverc: so ruffing high and exiting with the Q@S should have been a sensible line of defence|pg||
nt|haans: clubs finesse win or lose the board :)|pg||
nt|ady: lot of trumps coming now|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

pc|dT|nt|oliverc: LOL. Fantoni had to start with 3 @s's to beat this|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: medically referred to as "desynchronosis," is a physiological condition which is a consequence of alterations to circadian rhythms.|pg||
nt|westjava: did you open 1nt or 1 @H, Bob?|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  Jet lag results from rapid long-distance transmeridian (east-west or west-east) travel, as on a jet plane.|pg||
nt|mcphee: i open those hands 1N|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty|pg||
nt|westjava: 5332,right?|pg||
nt|mcphee: the bidding is easier when you open 1N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to me simple 1@h, melih ozdil of new york also likes to begin with 1N since long years|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: thanks all around mates, special thanks to Roland and Russell|pg||
nt|ady: still only 10 tricks  I think needed to play low heart early for a chance of an 11th|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT ?|pg||
nt|mamos: -1?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: This is the last board of the set - play continues throughout today and the next three days   fantastic chance to watch the best palyers from both sides of the pond|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: this gets them to 4@H|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: not easy to avoid game|pg||

nt|mcphee: this one can be made|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcphee: meyers will need to guess well|pg||

nt|h_karluk: and 2254 another story|pg||
pc|h9|nt|westjava: yup, give 2@S and double finesse in @D|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|oliverc: this looks like a gamble that will not pay off|pg||
nt|oliverc: -2 is too many|pg||
nt|oliverc: but -1 might have been a good result|pg||
nt|oliverc: if 2@S was making|pg||
nt|oliverc: not sure it was, though|pg||
nt|oliverc: EW look to have 6 tricks against 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Fantoni thinking|pg||
nt|reisig: He might have opened 2NT (or 2@c - intending 2NT next)|pg||
nt|mamos: 6 tables Hans   do you expect them all to bid game?|pg||
nt|ady: even on a non heart lead  should go down|pg||
nt|mamos: so not dead   ....yet|pg||
nt|ady: 26 hcp   not likely any would stop short of game|pg||
