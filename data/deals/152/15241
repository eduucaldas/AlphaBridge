nt|swanson: North considers discarding a heart, for he knows East will be ruffing - he doens't know that he only holds one trump, however.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dimi: true|pg||
nt|Walddk3:  The overall score before this round is USA 85   65 Europe. 100 points wins the cup.|pg||
nt|dimi: Great performance by the USA so long, will be really hard for Europe to come back|pg||

nt|irwinbo: surely a loss for the u.s. on 3|pg||
nt|haans: defensive mistake at other table?|pg||
nt|sybarra: landed on his feet as one would expect of Rodwell |pg||
nt|yvesj49: with big help......|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: wlc back:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: players are allowed to look at their system cards ....|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Now we are linked|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rv: this might buy contract here as well|pg||
nt|spooky: 2@H=8-11|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: with always 6@H|pg||
nt|irwinbo: minus 800 in the other room  you never know|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Operator, please enter scores on 15 and 16 manually when you get a minute|pg||
nt|sybarra: (just a joke) |pg||
mb|1S|nt|haans: many double here to say somthing about other suit (normally lead lowest suit)|pg||
nt|jcwla: 12 "berry" suit here: A-10, K-9, Q-6, J-5, T-4, 9-2, 8-1.  In second seat red you might want 18.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|spooky: aggresive 3@S bid|pg||
nt|rv: not sure if Levin has enough to bid 3@s in direct seat|pg||
nt|westjava: Europe leads now|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably 3@s by East|pg||
nt|henryb:  Will North balance?|pg||
nt|henryb:  No|pg||
nt|pef: we're back folks|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk5: http://www.buffettcup.com/Home/tabid/53/language/en-GB/Default.aspx  is the website for the competition. Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: cards for the Individual and other information|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Then we need Simon to enter scores manually in MOVIE|pg||
nt|pef: it looks like the last board was a push|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mamos: a helpful start |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3nt looks the final resting place|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: only think wrong with slam here is lack of aces :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: straight 6 tricks after @S lead. |pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Borgeland might have converted plus to minus here|pg||
nt|spooky: he probably did|pg||
nt|spooky: 3@H was a preemptive raise, so 3NT bid is strange, probably Levin is wondering what's going on|pg||
nt|rv: only  7 tricks on double dummy defense, in reality I expect Brogeland to make 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|rv: if Weinstein had doubled which he could have, I am sure Levin will lead a minor|pg||
nt|spooky: if Levin leads a @S, and Brogeland plays spade back directly, Levin needs to switch @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good score in OR.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: will be working for the 7th.|pg||
nt|henryb:  may well make seven as cashing spades will squeeze North|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: and lack of fit|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: declarer has no chance|pg||
nt|jcwla: The surprise lead, eh?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|rv: I expect Levin to get this right and win another point for US here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|spooky: not a point, -1 is still a 0.5|pg||
nt|rv: yes sry even the board|pg||
nt|rv: @c lead would have fetched a point, on @s lead best case scenario for L-W to half the brd|pg||
nt|haans: assume 4@D first 4nt after = do not show @DA|pg||
nt|haans: yes that 2|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 1@d 2@s and 1@c |pg||
nt|sybarra: yeah sure.....|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|haans: did Helness really bid canap√©|pg||
nt|westjava: some thing like, after 2@C GF|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT not even certain - communication problems- but probable make|pg||
nt|jcwla: Just as Goldie Hawn in "Seems Like Old Times" was "not outside eating chicken, that's for sure," this contract ain't gonna produce 1430, that's for sure.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Seems like the wires got crossed.|pg||
nt|pef: europe is up 2 to 1 in match A and 3 to 2 in match C, so this round may signal a badly needed comeback for the Europeans|pg||
nt|pef: I believe the score here is 1.5  to 1.5 but we'll see|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|ady: with spades 3-3   and hearts 3-2  this looks like 12 tricks|pg||
nt|westjava: 10 tricks after @D lead|pg||
nt|haans: playing clubs to KQ|pg||
nt|yvesj49: yes very surprizing lol|pg||
nt|pef: actually 1 to 1 the way it's being scored|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|westjava: 3@C, 3@D, 4@S|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|rv: if Brogeland runs the @h suit, Weinstein has enough opportunities to signal @ds|pg||
nt|ady: might now run 8@S  |pg||
nt|jcwla: So on 2, where Duboin went down 4 in 3@H, in the OR it went 2@H around to a double by von Arnim and 2@S by Nunes, making 3 on a 3-3 fit for not enough.  A win to USA there.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pef: hampson can make 5 here for the win, but he'll have to guess remarkably well in trumps to do so|pg||
nt|pef: sorry, I mean to make 4 for the tie|pg||
nt|rnmalik: you mean Jill|pg||
nt|pef: and it's jill levin playing the hand|pg||
nt|pef: yeah, time to get my glasses :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|rv: srtange|pg||
nt|spooky: oh,,,|pg||
nt|spooky: didn't expect that|pg||
nt|rv: can't be true|pg||
nt|rv: Weinstein has disc @s and played lo-hi in @hs, not sure if all this indicates @d preference to @cs|pg||
nt|rv: this is assuming Levin wins @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Mike Gold|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi venky and Roland|pg||
nt|spooky: he played spades 6-5 and @H 7-J, don't think there was suit preference somewhere, not sure tho|pg||
nt|spooky: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: and gernbrand |pg||
nt|rv: thinking aloud, would it helped Weinstein to play @Hj and @hx to indicate @d preference|pg||
nt|rv: not sure of their SP methods, many partnerships play smith-echo or rev smith-echo in nt contracts to indicate continuation of suit or shifts in obvious / non-obvious suits|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure Levin-Weinstein have detailed defensive agreements, this deal will test those agreements|pg||
nt|rv: he needs to win @SA though:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I see i have arrived at the kill point|pg||
nt|spooky: winning @SA is not the problem I think.. i think he is wondering what to switch|pg||
nt|rv: yes Mike, you can give your perspective on carding agreements|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rv: I much like play suggested by Hop, play second @s early|pg||
nt|spooky: wow, it's made now|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|odysseus69: going for maximum|pg||
nt|westjava: now 2@C, 3@D, 1@H and 4@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: spaded best now from South|pg||
nt|odysseus69: better-cash heart|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no score for board 3 from open room - did I see 4Dx -2|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now North is in real trouble|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|haans: ¬Ω a point|pg||
mc|9|nt|pef: well now that won't happen, so a win for europe on the board and they go up by a board with 2 to go|pg||

mb|1D|nt|rnmalik: yes, think so.|pg||
nt|henryb:  he has corrected it. thank you|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|kiwi_joker: EW should finish in 4@S here|pg||
nt|mamos: another board where there maybe competition for the part score|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think its quite there|pg||
nt|henryb:  operator, if the play went as shown, declarer lost 7 tricks|pg||

nt|jcwla: "Me, or your lying eyes?"|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 4 card M|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: lot tougher to make 10 tricks in @h tricks|pg||
nt|rv: @h strain|pg||
nt|westjava: 23 hcp and 1nt makes 10 after @D lead at other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@c "inverted; shows about 10+ points in support of clubs, no four+ card major|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes @H lead and 10 @D to Ace@D, making five.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: Jason didnt open the South hand  at another table    |pg||
nt|spooky: I wouldn't pass with a 7crd suit in this situation.. would you?|pg||
nt|lestergold: my dog says he would rebid 7 card suit|pg||
nt|rv: I expect another brd for Europe here to tie the match|pg||
nt|rv: I would bid 2@s as well with Levin's hand, his hand not worth much except in @s strain|pg||
nt|rv: really surprised by his pass|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H should make e/w with A@S right|pg||
nt|yvesj49: part score @s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H also I think |pg||
nt|yvesj49: yes|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or guessing the @s 4|pg||
nt|yvesj49: Queen|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwi_joker: Duboin's pass of 3@S influencd by the type of scoring, I guess (BAM). Certainly a hand you'd want to be in game on, in IMPs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: suicide bomber just arrived|pg||
nt|haans: best you can say about that double: Ricking the boat|pg||

nt|rv: Europe were down 20-40 last night at end of Pairs rounds, they have nearly levelled the match|pg||
nt|rv: Hi David, Diarmuid and all specs|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i don't think levin has gone to sleep  he desperately wants to find a way to beat the hand but alas, ther is no such way|pg||

nt|rv: Hi Drew |pg||
nt|hedyg: good afternoon :)|pg||
nt|drewsky: HIYA Hedy |pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon Hedy|pg||
nt|rv: irrespective of Pairs, Teams or Individual, you won't regular MPs or IMPs, all scoring is on BAM style 2-1-0 per board converted to Buffet Points|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: Levin could have left Weinstein in hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: its called "Brains" in these parts ...|pg||
nt|yvesj49: ??|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|haans: america closing in|pg||
nt|odysseus69: disrupting the oppo from 1NT is a popular pairs idea but there are limits and this is really stretching the concept|pg||
nt|haans: some say in MP you lose it you let them play 1nt|pg||
nt|haans: thats why DONT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I was interested to see what Helgemo would lead v 1NT - Helness spoiled it|pg||
nt|westjava: even DONT or CAPP, I didnt bid any thing with E hand|pg||
nt|haans: give the 1100|pg||
nt|westjava: a disaster|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mamos: defence had some chance of keeping this to nine  tricks on Club leads  but ten more likely|pg||
nt|rv: Geoff Boycott's|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need to guess the qx of spades I think to make this |pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: discard a dim|pg||
nt|chick: from N's point of view, E may not have an entry to the last club|pg||
nt|haans: but does not no if to play @D or not|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|haans: @D = jump this suit|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder what the @D3 actually means in their signal system|pg||
nt|haans: you do not kill the diamond suit yourselve if good in diamond|pg||
nt|rnmalik: It has to be a shift and @S looks reasonable.|pg||
nt|chick: that's the question Rashed, does it just ask for a shift, or does it indicate which suit.   |pg||
nt|chick: and if you were sitting S, which suit would you want to signal for?  :)|pg||
nt|haans: Weistein can have max 2 hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo 3NT makes as the cards are.|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is a "6 or 4" hand|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|haans: Weinstein|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cant pitch any of the majors please.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: lol|pg||
nt|spooky: this board will be a win to europe to tie this match.|pg||
nt|rv: he needs to make all tricks to salvage this brd, even Houdini can't do that|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rv: this form of scoring is toughest to play, even more so than MPs where field evens you a bit|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chick: Keep in mind that this is BAM, which means an extra trick wins the hand.|pg||
nt|chick: This is the most tense form of bridge, because even a tiny mistake can make the difference in a full win or loss of the board point|pg||
nt|jcwla: It just got easier.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I am result oriented:)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rv: of Weinstein doesn't know the result in OR and is trying his best to make the best of a inferior contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think he must have had the same thoughtas 3 commentators|pg||
nt|rv: most bridge events is not palyed in Barometric style of scoring, hence players don't know result till they play all deals in a session/round/segment|pg||
nt|rv: are not played|pg||
nt|spooky: I played board a match once, and it's really fun, but you have no idea what they do at the other table, because everybody is trying to score the point every board..|pg||
nt|rv: yes Hop, this form of scoring is most definitely bleeding-edge, a bit tougher than even MPs where field does protect you to some extent|pg||
nt|ady: should quicken now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A@H and another would restrict the declarer to the contract.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yvesj49: lol simon after work now only diet coke lol|pg||
nt|pef: not making 5 now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no|pg||
nt|pef: as long as east covers one of the diamonds|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chick: so would just about any other lead, I think.  She has played this beautifully to make the opps help|pg||
nt|henryb:  IMO 3N is easily down after a spade lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Take 3@S and a @C.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: K of @D with Rodwell  might get easier,  |pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: dropped QS ...|pg||

nt|swanson: Down the middle bidding by the Hacketts boys gets them to the normal contract - which will almost certainly produce an overtrick (with the @SK onside).|pg||

nt|rv: every match in Teams and Pairs is worth 4 Buffet points, this round has 3 matches and worth 12 Buffet points|pg||
nt|rv: if BAM score is tied at 6-6, each team gets 2 Buffet points each, else winning team in a match in a round gets 4 BPs|pg||
nt|chick: dummy was irrelevant by then|pg||
nt|haans: agreeing to 800 good bridge :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sybarra: and last bd of this first set in the indy |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|yvesj49: indy car ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty to simon,  our wonderful operator |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|rv: Bufett and not buffet, it says I am hungry:)|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|westjava: now, an easy bid and play in 4@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can declarer find spade queen for the overtrick - thats what this board is|pg||
nt|westjava: yes|pg||
nt|haans: but he wont|pg||
nt|westjava: by dropping:)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: SIMON you can drink a beer in 5 minutes lol|pg||
nt|drewsky: Not strange. Sementa reasoned that if Rodwell, who has already showed up with the king @D, might have repsoned with the Queen of @S as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: these guys are playing really fast ...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: no way to find the @H lead that beats this|pg||
nt|drewsky: how can he make it on any lead, Hedy ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no he cant sry, Nunes wont cover the @d|pg||
nt|rv: @ds are 3-0 else this lead will sell|pg||
nt|haans: 1 down 200 p|pg||
nt|haans: good lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5Cx is a save and they may well try that|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: good results for Europe from the open room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: i assume 1n here ... both minors?|pg||
nt|spooky: I guess natural? |pg||
nt|yvesj49: Q@d strange acrd i meant drew|pg||
nt|sybarra: this table is sprint speed for sure |pg||
nt|yvesj49: card*|pg||
nt|henryb:  Last board at this table. Both other matches are still early and in doubt|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mamos: West's play of the Club combination was something improving players might like to consider --- making three tricks in the suit by leading towards his honours twice|pg||
nt|rv: now declarer rates to go 2 down?|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,a good save|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6-board sets of 25 minutes -- a little slice of heaven.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Seemingly a freeroll for Europe here.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|spooky: it can be both... |pg||
nt|rv: I think Weinstein bid it as natural|pg||
nt|lestergold: natural pasrtner makes takeout doubel i have two other suits bid neither?|pg||
nt|rv: showing 5-7 hcp with @s stopper|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwi_joker: diamond pips are interesting|pg||
nt|spooky: he didn't know which 1 to bid?|pg||
nt|haans: rare 4@C with 2 defensive tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now declarer may get spades right- North sounds like a singleton somewhere|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would lose 2 Aces, am I right?|pg||
nt|stigw: 4 H might have beeen a good sacrif.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has some work to do |pg||
nt|sybarra: and watch this one get claimed rather quickly also |pg||
nt|yvesj49: you have extra if you play fast ? lol|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thx Roland, Simon, Shirley, Yves, Rashed, Drew, all kibs.|pg||
nt|sybarra: extra time for the beer :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcwla: Well, there may come a time when E has to take the @SA or lose it.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rv: well done|pg||
nt|lestergold: well landed in only sane spot|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: push|pg||
nt|irwinbo: would all of you bd 3nt opposite a modern 3d bid?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dT|nt|westjava: 1 point to europe:)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rv: 3-3 after 6 brds scored, good close match exciting for specs|pg||
nt|haans: yes 4@C may be a suicide|pg||
pc|h2|nt|drewsky: 100% to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|rv: second seat pre-empts are generally sound, but at these colors could be shaded|pg||
nt|rv: if 3@d red in second seat, I would bid 3n|pg||
nt|drewsky: The biggest reason to bid 3NT is that the opponents mught compete in hearts|pg||
nt|rv: at these colors, I will consider a pass|pg||
nt|ady: you lack quick tricks out side diamonds     even if there is sokid diamonds oppsoite   KQJ etc   it seems either a club or heart trick will leave you 1 short|pg||
nt|drewsky: The opponents are cold for 5@C....don't make it easy for them to get there|pg||
nt|ady: club or heart lead |pg||
nt|rv: Fantunes rate to take this atleast 2 down at this stage of play, so Europe may not lose on this board|pg||
nt|ady: thats different if you are bidding to keep them out|pg||
nt|rv: in my experience of watching top level Vu graph, Fantunes are exceptionally good defenders even amongst the elite|pg||
nt|pef: very aggressive 3NT call by levin.  but looks like it will be justified with only 3 hearts available and the spade finesse working|pg||
nt|pef: so looks like this match will end up being a tie|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: Fantunes play reverse Smith |pg||
nt|yvesj49: ty jordan|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: this was just always going off in the real world |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yes, no chance now. Needed to find a double-dummy line of playing trumps (leading high ones from hand to pin East's 9) to keep trump losers to one|pg||
nt|drewsky: Its a 2 way bid...I might make OR they might make.....but I am sick if I let them get to 3@H|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: I suspect we are back fairly quickly |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|yvesj49: he could drink a big one lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Would lose a @C and a @H.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|rv: in last round, we had match between Zia-Hamman, Meckwell against Fantunes, Von Arnim-Auken decided on last board|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|rv: Drew has a point|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 4 in the OR, B. Levin made the 3@S rebid predicted in here, and Meyers passed, so already a win for Europe.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 4 is quite agressive|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh was corrected to down 1 in here, so actually a win for USA.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with modern light openings|pg||
nt|yvesj49: eric is about squeezing|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcwla: It's 5 where USA lost the board in the bidding - Rodwell's understandable raise to 3@D over 2@D was not duplicated by Nunes, so Meyers' second double produced 2@S by Levin, then ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H over Nunes' delayed 3@D.  Meyers did not raise and 3@H the final contract so a win to Europe.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ady: auction was the same in OR except east doubled the 3NT    |pg||
nt|yvesj49: 3 rounds of @s|pg||
mc|9|nt|rv: I expect Fantoni to end-play declarer for 3 down|pg||
nt|hedyg: declarer is squeezed now|pg||
nt|rv: declarer is squeezed and he may concede 2 @h tricks in the end in addition to 4@cs and a @s|pg||
nt|pef: so the match does end up tied.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks all,|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: next match tomorrow|pg||
nt|pef: thanks all for watching and thanks to bbo and the Buffett cup for making this possible|pg||
