nt|jcwla: loser, losing to Sabine's K and could only comment, "That was sexy."|pg||

nt|rado: N may blast to 3NT now|pg||
nt|bernix: 6 BPs at stage per session, a 6-0 would help our cause|pg||

nt|mamos: are we linked to the correct table ?|pg||
nt|mamos: i thought the twins were always scoring agianst Levin and Weinstein|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: other room looks to have started with a precision 2@C, and someohow they couldnt put the brakes on before reaching a hopelessly optimistic 6C|pg||
nt|spooky: but Brogeland took his "safe"plus scoe in 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: but non vulnerable :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bridge a funny game - Jx of @H's part of the thinking to go back to 2@S but @HJ turns out to be highly useful card.|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|sunsamvar: time to show card play skills for Meck here|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: fred declaring|pg||
nt|petergill: It's normal on this @H layout to play South for @HQ, as then you can pick up Qxxx in South and bare queen in either hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: head in hands|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|petergill: After the spade ruff, he will play @HA then @H? ... this looks like -1 when @H's break 4-1|pg||
nt|petergill: Normal but unlucky line|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: double dummy he can try 2 @H fins (w/o the @S ruff) and take @C fin|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and keeps the @H6 as Peter points out|pg||
nt|petergill: At imps, you might (without playing @SK) play @HJ or 10 or 9 to ace, then run @H8, hoping to pitch a loser on the last club, but at Baord a Match, Fred's line of play is 100% best|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|h5|pg||

nt|chick: hopefully we'll find out the end result of that board when the operator has time to put it in :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: technical problems - contract is 4S by NS |pg||
nt|haans: If Levin had bid 3@C von Arnim odds to bid 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: new board now|pg||
nt|mamos: just too much from Justin there|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I think so |pg||
nt|jcwla: The N hand playable in three different strains, contains a void, and the @H suit represents a small fraction of its values with nothing on top.  |pg||
nt|yvesj49: ty rashed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes @@@C and @D.|pg||

nt|Walddk5: East is Justin Hackett|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pef: this look like a likely 4H game|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 6@C possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They are both   J  Hackett|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rv: transfer responses here, 1@h shows 4+@s|pg||
nt|Walddk5: But North is Hampson|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: ah, that makes a bit more sense|pg||
nt|rado: 4@H with @S guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H can be beateb on spade lead|pg||
nt|drewsky: ONLY if played by south|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good bid west|pg||
nt|yvesj49: NS are out of 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: Individual: Each player on Team Europe is drawn to compare with a particular player on Team USA. A player does not meet the player with whom he or she compar|pg||
nt|yvesj49: WITH 25 COUNT|pg||
nt|yvesj49: if i play i don't want to be compared with fantoni lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or 6@H|pg||
nt|mamos: although  Americans are in 4@C x at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Fred is playing in Match A|pg||
nt|rado: strange no Drury used?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rv: Brogeland's 1@s denies 4@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Henry, welcome.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Got it right now|pg||
nt|pef: a rather speculative double from Duboin assuming that's not an anomaly|pg||
nt|bernix: they are using a standardized cc most propably w/o drury|pg||
pc|cK|nt|spooky: 1@S shows 3@S|pg||
nt|rv: with 4 he would have jumped to 2@s and with 2 would have rebid 1n or 2m|pg||
pc|c4|nt|spooky: weird that Brogeland didn't open 1NT, they play 15-17...|pg||
nt|rv: Levin-Weinstein compared with Duboin-Sementa and Brogeland-Saelensmide with Sontag-Berk|pg||
nt|rv: play of @h suit critical for OT in this contract|pg||
nt|ady: Europe should win the board 5@C  at least down 2|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D Bourke = just GF bid|pg||
nt|daman: Berkowicz|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|spooky: it's about the overtrick in this lay out|pg||
nt|mamos: the scoring method has led to many NT contracts  as players hunt for the magic +10 points|pg||
nt|daman: easy to figure this 3rd and 5th|pg||
nt|rado: other table will open E hand probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: cc was consulted by Fulvio before bidding 3H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: holy ... 2nt natural?|pg||
nt|chick: looks like just one diamond loser, and perhaps a heart loser|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sound 4@S with @H guess can make 6.|pg||
nt|haans: odds against doing right in hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true. 10 @H very vital card.|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: In every case the four individuals at one table have their corresponding opponent sitting in the same seat at the matching table. |pg||
pc|s2|nt|daman: Berk made the same bad 4@C bid|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rv: I presume Levin will duck @h to @hK smoothyl|pg||
nt|pef: well 5c would have been a good save|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good lead.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rv: smoothly|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yvesj49: nice organization|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcwla: Instead of wishing physical harm on your enemy, just wish that Sabine leads to all their contracts.|pg||
nt|bernix: careful unblocking enables auken to make 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: unless South is very much asleep when declarer plays a heart from dummy later on, this will go -1|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|spooky: this helps declarer|pg||
nt|rv: after South's @H9, Brogeland may just get it right|pg||
nt|rv: ah, easy now for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Pairs, Teams and Individual events in Warren Buffet Cup, all scoring is BAM style|pg||
nt|rv: so OTs and UTs very crucial, this form of scoring is lot tougher than IMPs and a bit tougher than Pairs (MPs)|pg||
nt|rv: if you make 8 tricks in 2@s and your opps make same 8 tricks in NT, you get 0 BAM points|pg||
nt|haans: 54% for this slam|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event. Have a look|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer will have to sniff out Heart position for a good score|pg||
nt|daman: he will sniff it out by default|pg||
nt|daman: he will not risk his contract   and in so doing will drop the @H King|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That would be +2 and good score.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rv: in Pairs (MPs), the field does protect you a bit|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Haans and every one|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: would have been interesting if KH played on 10H|pg||
nt|mamos: Sontag and Berkowicz in 4@H so looks irrelevant how many tricks   he makes here|pg||
nt|pef: I'm not sure why the other table scoring isn't showing up here, but assuming the matching table is  Open room, the europeans won the first board by competing to 4c and going down 1|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bernix: but not necessary with meckstroth going down in 4@h in OR|pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: Hi Lilek|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hi Lillek|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Victor,sry late:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: In the Individual each set is of just six deals|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: imo the only lead which sets 4@H.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: is there any reason to get hearts wrong?|pg||
nt|pef: interesting point of the hand, it looks like hampson needs to take a diamond finesse now, giving up on the heart finesse|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N 's hand is counted 5@S+4@D+2@C +2@H|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pef: I guess not, although if east had ducked the heart it would ahve been more interesting|pg||
pc|h3|nt|daman: 4@H has the same guess as overtricks in 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  unlucky. This way he runs out of trumps|pg||
nt|henryb:  provided North continues spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  He is also unlucky that the player with the fourth spade has the late club entry|pg||

nt|lestergold: and gernbrand |pg||
nt|rv: thinking aloud, would it helped Weinstein to play @Hj and @hx to indicate @d preference|pg||
nt|rv: not sure of their SP methods, many partnerships play smith-echo or rev smith-echo in nt contracts to indicate continuation of suit or shifts in obvious / non-obvious suits|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure Levin-Weinstein have detailed defensive agreements, this deal will test those agreements|pg||

nt|rv: Hi all|pg||
nt|rv: great comeback by Europe this morning|pg||
nt|ady: hi rv|pg||
nt|rv: Europe were down 20-40 last night at end of Pairs rounds, they have nearly levelled the match|pg||
nt|rv: Hi David, Diarmuid and all specs|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i don't think levin has gone to sleep  he desperately wants to find a way to beat the hand but alas, ther is no such way|pg||
nt|drewsky: Thats right, this is just like an NBA game.|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Irwin|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Drew |pg||
nt|hedyg: good afternoon :)|pg||
nt|drewsky: HIYA Hedy |pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon Hedy|pg||
nt|rv: irrespective of Pairs, Teams or Individual, you won't regular MPs or IMPs, all scoring is on BAM style 2-1-0 per board converted to Buffet Points|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: Levin could have left Weinstein in hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: its called "Brains" in these parts ...|pg||
nt|yvesj49: ??|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: america closing in|pg||
nt|odysseus69: disrupting the oppo from 1NT is a popular pairs idea but there are limits and this is really stretching the concept|pg||
nt|haans: some say in MP you lose it you let them play 1nt|pg||
nt|haans: thats why DONT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I was interested to see what Helgemo would lead v 1NT - Helness spoiled it|pg||
nt|westjava: even DONT or CAPP, I didnt bid any thing with E hand|pg||
nt|haans: give the 1100|pg||
nt|westjava: a disaster|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mamos: defence had some chance of keeping this to nine  tricks on Club leads  but ten more likely|pg||
nt|rv: Geoff Boycott's|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need to guess the qx of spades I think to make this |pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: discard a dim|pg||
nt|chick: from N's point of view, E may not have an entry to the last club|pg||
nt|haans: but does not no if to play @D or not|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|haans: @D = jump this suit|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder what the @D3 actually means in their signal system|pg||
nt|haans: you do not kill the diamond suit yourselve if good in diamond|pg||
nt|rnmalik: It has to be a shift and @S looks reasonable.|pg||
nt|chick: that's the question Rashed, does it just ask for a shift, or does it indicate which suit.   |pg||
nt|chick: and if you were sitting S, which suit would you want to signal for?  :)|pg||
nt|haans: Weistein can have max 2 hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo 3NT makes as the cards are.|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is a "6 or 4" hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: Weinstein|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cant pitch any of the majors please.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|lestergold: lol|pg||
nt|spooky: this board will be a win to europe to tie this match.|pg||
nt|rv: he needs to make all tricks to salvage this brd, even Houdini can't do that|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rv: this form of scoring is toughest to play, even more so than MPs where field evens you a bit|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chick: Keep in mind that this is BAM, which means an extra trick wins the hand.|pg||
nt|chick: This is the most tense form of bridge, because even a tiny mistake can make the difference in a full win or loss of the board point|pg||
nt|jcwla: It just got easier.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I am result oriented:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: of Weinstein doesn't know the result in OR and is trying his best to make the best of a inferior contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think he must have had the same thoughtas 3 commentators|pg||
nt|rv: most bridge events is not palyed in Barometric style of scoring, hence players don't know result till they play all deals in a session/round/segment|pg||
nt|rv: are not played|pg||
nt|spooky: I played board a match once, and it's really fun, but you have no idea what they do at the other table, because everybody is trying to score the point every board..|pg||
nt|rv: yes Hop, this form of scoring is most definitely bleeding-edge, a bit tougher than even MPs where field does protect you to some extent|pg||
nt|ady: should quicken now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A@H and another would restrict the declarer to the contract.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|yvesj49: lol simon after work now only diet coke lol|pg||
nt|pef: not making 5 now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no|pg||
nt|pef: as long as east covers one of the diamonds|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: so would just about any other lead, I think.  She has played this beautifully to make the opps help|pg||
nt|henryb:  IMO 3N is easily down after a spade lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Take 3@S and a @C.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: K of @D with Rodwell  might get easier,  |pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: dropped QS ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 3, the auction of 1NT-swish duplicated in the OR but Nunes failed by 1, so another win for USA.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yvesj49: stange 1st trick.....|pg||
nt|sybarra: wd to Sememta |pg||

nt|sunsamvar: and in this form of scoring i guess she has a clear dbl|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sunsamvar: Tx Alan.. good work|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Helgemo got the clubs right - one consideration is that Meckstroth at this form of scoring cannot afford to underlead @CA|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|petergill: No balance - Larry Cohen of Total Tricks fame would be appalled. |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzre: jeff consulting geir that his opening bid was correct|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: von Arim in a hurry to cash any @S tricks that might be there|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D - 1 will win, with Auken and Fantoni in 3@S|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|petergill: Good technique with HAxxx opposite xxxx often is to duck the first round of trumps, to retain control of the situation|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzre: back in 28 mins. this room will stay open until the closed room has finished|pg||
nt|petergill: Fred Gitelman didn't really want @CA to be onside|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and a good score for USA on BD 6|pg||
nt|petergill: Europe has won this match|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Tx Peter ... has been a pleasure commentating with you.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and tx all specs for watching and for your comments and tips|pg||
nt|petergill: His bad trumps, and the possiblity of a penalty from a balancing Helgemo, made Fred pass 2@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks all, see you all soon for the next match, due to start in about 25 minutes I think|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: bye all|pg||
nt|petergill: 6 more rounds of 6 boards remain|pg||
nt|petergill: The standard of bridge at our table was very good indeed - at the other table, not quite as good - merely "world class" there. :)|pg||
nt|petergill: If USA wins, then the visiting team will have won all three Buffett Cups, in 2006, 2008 and 2010|pg||
nt|petergill: This year is Meckstroth and Rodwell's debut in the Buffett Cup - next time, in 2012 perhaps Europe needs to add Lauria - Versace as a counter |pg||

nt|rv: every match in Teams and Pairs is worth 4 Buffet points, this round has 3 matches and worth 12 Buffet points|pg||
nt|rv: if BAM score is tied at 6-6, each team gets 2 Buffet points each, else winning team in a match in a round gets 4 BPs|pg||
nt|chick: dummy was irrelevant by then|pg||
nt|haans: agreeing to 800 good bridge :(|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and last bd of this first set in the indy |pg||
nt|bernix: last hand for this session|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|yvesj49: indy car ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty to simon,  our wonderful operator |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|rv: Bufett and not buffet, it says I am hungry:)|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|westjava: now, an easy bid and play in 4@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can declarer find spade queen for the overtrick - thats what this board is|pg||
nt|westjava: yes|pg||
nt|haans: but he wont|pg||
nt|westjava: by dropping:)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: SIMON you can drink a beer in 5 minutes lol|pg||
nt|drewsky: Not strange. Sementa reasoned that if Rodwell, who has already showed up with the king @D, might have repsoned with the Queen of @S as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: these guys are playing really fast ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no way to find the @H lead that beats this|pg||
nt|drewsky: how can he make it on any lead, Hedy ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no he cant sry, Nunes wont cover the @d|pg||
nt|rv: @ds are 3-0 else this lead will sell|pg||
nt|haans: 1 down 200 p|pg||
nt|haans: good lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5Cx is a save and they may well try that|pg||
mb|4H|nt|spooky: good results for Europe from the open room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: i assume 1n here ... both minors?|pg||
nt|spooky: I guess natural? |pg||
nt|yvesj49: Q@d strange acrd i meant drew|pg||
nt|sybarra: this table is sprint speed for sure |pg||
nt|yvesj49: card*|pg||
nt|henryb:  Last board at this table. Both other matches are still early and in doubt|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: West's play of the Club combination was something improving players might like to consider --- making three tricks in the suit by leading towards his honours twice|pg||
nt|rv: now declarer rates to go 2 down?|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,a good save|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6-board sets of 25 minutes -- a little slice of heaven.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Seemingly a freeroll for Europe here.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|spooky: it can be both... |pg||
nt|rv: I think Weinstein bid it as natural|pg||
nt|lestergold: natural pasrtner makes takeout doubel i have two other suits bid neither?|pg||
nt|rv: showing 5-7 hcp with @s stopper|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kiwi_joker: diamond pips are interesting|pg||
nt|spooky: he didn't know which 1 to bid?|pg||
nt|haans: rare 4@C with 2 defensive tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now declarer may get spades right- North sounds like a singleton somewhere|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would lose 2 Aces, am I right?|pg||
nt|stigw: 4 H might have beeen a good sacrif.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: declarer has some work to do |pg||
nt|sybarra: and watch this one get claimed rather quickly also |pg||
nt|yvesj49: you have extra if you play fast ? lol|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thx Roland, Simon, Shirley, Yves, Rashed, Drew, all kibs.|pg||
nt|sybarra: extra time for the beer :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, there may come a time when E has to take the @SA or lose it.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rv: well done|pg||
nt|lestergold: well landed in only sane spot|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: push|pg||
nt|irwinbo: would all of you bd 3nt opposite a modern 3d bid?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
nt|westjava: 1 point to europe:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: 3-3 after 6 brds scored, good close match exciting for specs|pg||
nt|haans: yes 4@C may be a suicide|pg||
pc|hT|nt|drewsky: 100% to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rv: second seat pre-empts are generally sound, but at these colors could be shaded|pg||
nt|rv: if 3@d red in second seat, I would bid 3n|pg||
nt|drewsky: The biggest reason to bid 3NT is that the opponents mught compete in hearts|pg||
nt|rv: at these colors, I will consider a pass|pg||
nt|ady: you lack quick tricks out side diamonds     even if there is sokid diamonds oppsoite   KQJ etc   it seems either a club or heart trick will leave you 1 short|pg||
nt|drewsky: The opponents are cold for 5@C....don't make it easy for them to get there|pg||
nt|ady: club or heart lead |pg||
nt|rv: Fantunes rate to take this atleast 2 down at this stage of play, so Europe may not lose on this board|pg||
nt|ady: thats different if you are bidding to keep them out|pg||
nt|rv: in my experience of watching top level Vu graph, Fantunes are exceptionally good defenders even amongst the elite|pg||
nt|pef: very aggressive 3NT call by levin.  but looks like it will be justified with only 3 hearts available and the spade finesse working|pg||
nt|pef: so looks like this match will end up being a tie|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantunes play reverse Smith |pg||
nt|yvesj49: ty jordan|pg||
mc|10|nt|mamos: this was just always going off in the real world |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yes, no chance now. Needed to find a double-dummy line of playing trumps (leading high ones from hand to pin East's 9) to keep trump losers to one|pg||
nt|drewsky: Its a 2 way bid...I might make OR they might make.....but I am sick if I let them get to 3@H|pg||
nt|bernix: next session at 1230. bye for now|pg||
nt|rado: tx all|pg||
