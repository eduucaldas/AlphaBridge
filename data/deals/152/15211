nt|rv: play of @h suit critical for OT in this contract|pg||

nt|rv: though we have Pairs, Teams and Individual events in Warren Buffet Cup, all scoring is BAM style|pg||
nt|rv: so OTs and UTs very crucial, this form of scoring is lot tougher than IMPs and a bit tougher than Pairs (MPs)|pg||
nt|rv: if you make 8 tricks in 2@s and your opps make same 8 tricks in NT, you get 0 BAM points|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|rv: Borgeland might have converted plus to minus here|pg||
nt|spooky: he probably did|pg||
nt|spooky: 3@H was a preemptive raise, so 3NT bid is strange, probably Levin is wondering what's going on|pg||
nt|rv: only  7 tricks on double dummy defense, in reality I expect Brogeland to make 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|rv: if Weinstein had doubled which he could have, I am sure Levin will lead a minor|pg||
nt|spooky: if Levin leads a @S, and Brogeland plays spade back directly, Levin needs to switch @D|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: I expect Levin to get this right and win another point for US here|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: not a point, -1 is still a 0.5|pg||
nt|rv: yes sry even the board|pg||
nt|rv: @c lead would have fetched a point, on @s lead best case scenario for L-W to half the brd|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: with spades 3-3   and hearts 3-2  this looks like 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|rv: if Brogeland runs the @h suit, Weinstein has enough opportunities to signal @ds|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|rv: srtange|pg||
nt|spooky: oh,,,|pg||
nt|spooky: didn't expect that|pg||
nt|rv: can't be true|pg||
nt|rv: Weinstein has disc @s and played lo-hi in @hs, not sure if all this indicates @d preference to @cs|pg||
nt|rv: this is assuming Levin wins @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Mike Gold|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi venky and Roland|pg||
nt|spooky: he played spades 6-5 and @H 7-J, don't think there was suit preference somewhere, not sure tho|pg||
nt|spooky: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: and gernbrand |pg||
nt|rv: thinking aloud, would it helped Weinstein to play @Hj and @hx to indicate @d preference|pg||
nt|rv: not sure of their SP methods, many partnerships play smith-echo or rev smith-echo in nt contracts to indicate continuation of suit or shifts in obvious / non-obvious suits|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure Levin-Weinstein have detailed defensive agreements, this deal will test those agreements|pg||
nt|rv: he needs to win @SA though:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I see i have arrived at the kill point|pg||
nt|spooky: winning @SA is not the problem I think.. i think he is wondering what to switch|pg||

nt|ady: 3@H should make e/w with A@S right|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: Duboin's pass of 3@S influencd by the type of scoring, I guess (BAM). Certainly a hand you'd want to be in game on, in IMPs|pg||

nt|rv: irrespective of Pairs, Teams or Individual, you won't regular MPs or IMPs, all scoring is on BAM style 2-1-0 per board converted to Buffet Points|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Hedy|pg||

pc|s6|pg||

nt|lestergold: i think he must have had the same thoughtas 3 commentators|pg||
nt|rv: most bridge events is not palyed in Barometric style of scoring, hence players don't know result till they play all deals in a session/round/segment|pg||

nt|spooky: I played board a match once, and it's really fun, but you have no idea what they do at the other table, because everybody is trying to score the point every board..|pg||
nt|rv: yes Hop, this form of scoring is most definitely bleeding-edge, a bit tougher than even MPs where field does protect you to some extent|pg||

nt|rv: second seat pre-empts are generally sound, but at these colors could be shaded|pg||
nt|rv: if 3@d red in second seat, I would bid 3n|pg||
nt|drewsky: The biggest reason to bid 3NT is that the opponents mught compete in hearts|pg||
nt|rv: at these colors, I will consider a pass|pg||
nt|ady: you lack quick tricks out side diamonds     even if there is sokid diamonds oppsoite   KQJ etc   it seems either a club or heart trick will leave you 1 short|pg||
nt|drewsky: The opponents are cold for 5@C....don't make it easy for them to get there|pg||
nt|ady: club or heart lead |pg||
nt|rv: Fantunes rate to take this atleast 2 down at this stage of play, so Europe may not lose on this board|pg||
nt|ady: thats different if you are bidding to keep them out|pg||
nt|rv: in my experience of watching top level Vu graph, Fantunes are exceptionally good defenders even amongst the elite|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: For those who have just tuned in. Number of boards in the Teams has been cut down from 14 to 12 per session as the players have requested longer breaks. Start times unchanged |pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|spooky: A good result for USA here, on the closed room they bid this thin game|pg||
nt|rv: we are at half-way stage of this match, 6 more boards to be played|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: or Multilandy :)|pg||
nt|rv: a slightly dangerous action at these colors and Levin may balance with a double|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mamos: defence has  secured a trick in each suit now|pg||
nt|rv: much needed board for US in this match|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: the singleton J@C did it|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|lestergold: not much to play long dim takes care of spade|pg||
nt|spooky: still needs to find teh @HQ, but don't see a reason to missguess it|pg||
nt|rv: yes, I presume Brogeland will play with the odds and drop @HQ|pg||
nt|rv: only consolation for Fantoni is that he would have lost the board even if he had passed 1n since his counterparts reached 3n 1 down in OR|pg||
nt|rv: he was in lose-lose situation though he didn't know it|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
nt|rv: can defense take it 3 down for 800, I suspect 500 is the limit|pg||
nt|rv: don't think Fantoni can escape for 200?|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: nope|pg||

nt|rv: anyone for 4n by Levin or Weinstein?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|rv: this will get cracked|pg||

nt|rv: Brogeland competing at these colors must have decent values|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|lestergold: what??|pg||
nt|spooky: no double surprising|pg||
nt|rv: looks like N-S forgot to double E-W in 5@s in OR|pg||
nt|drewsky: The problem for N-S is that north cannot make a forcing pass, therefore his double shows 'cards' and south must use his judgement. The double is not penalty|pg||
nt|ady: might go down 2|pg||
nt|rv: yes I agree drew, could either of them more likely Weinstein bid 4n?|pg||

nt|spooky: is it never 300 if you have AK AK in majors? :)|pg||
nt|rv: passing is being too wimpy in my opinion|pg||
nt|drewsky: Well, if they were vulberable, I can see trying for 200 instead of 100, but there is not as much value in trying for 100 over 50.|pg||
nt|lestergold: you cannot pass when your partner has shown some values u have ak ak k and they are at 3 level and knope at these colours they rae bound to be taking the mickey|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|mamos: but Europe seem to have good scores for sure|pg||
nt|rv: this form of scoring (BAM) ensures most of boards are interesting|pg||
nt|rv: much better than IMPs|pg||
nt|spooky: BAM makes boards more exciting, every 10 points are important, so it takes more energy, so you are totally tired at the end of the day|pg||
nt|lestergold: really shows what the p[layers are made of gives them an opportunity to display their gifts for the game|pg||
nt|rv: 11 tricks for N-S hardly straight forward here|pg||
nt|spooky: is East thinking?|pg||
nt|rv: I expect Europe to hit back on this board, I can't see Bobby Levin making 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|lestergold: trying to guess how 11 tricks were made in open room|pg||
nt|rv: Eruope needs to win 1 or draw 2 out of 3 remaining brds to get 4 BPs in this match|pg||

nt|rv: Hedy, they are in forcing auction after redouble, I presume Fantoni could have more than what he has|pg||
nt|hedyg: well then why not double 3@C?|pg||
nt|rv: you have to ask that question to Nunes:)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|spooky: they reached the same ontract here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d= 4+ cards so already 2@d showed 4 cards imo|pg||
nt|drewsky: It is alot easier to double 3@C when you see all the hands....|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure it is but to bid those Jxx twice......|pg||
nt|ady: this is not clear cut   |pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: and this is the route|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|rv: it is breaking partnership trust for Nunes to pass if redouble sets up force till 3@d|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mamos: well done|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rv: re all|pg||
nt|rv: looks like Brogeland has avoided dreaded @d lead|pg||
nt|spooky: but it's not over yet.|pg||
nt|rv: best defense here is win @hk and back @H?|pg||
nt|rv: even if he ducks this, I can't see declarer coming to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: declarer may score 1 more trick on endplay on West, but he will still be a trick short for 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|rv: his only options were to double 3@c or bid 3@d, he couldn't pass|pg||
nt|drewsky: Agree he cannot pass, but perhaps his first call of 2@D got him into this predicament|pg||
nt|hedyg: quite so Drew|pg||
nt|rv: maybe he was regretting his original bid of 2@d as suggested by Drew|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|c7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|rv: if Brogeland win this, there will be no end-play but 3 @h tricks for decl, if he ducks only 2@h tricks but endplay will fetch an extra trick, in either case only 10 tricks in my ...|pg||
nt|rv: book|pg||
nt|ady: declarer knows north has length in the majors  but may forced to take a good view in hearts  as he needs the extra entry to play spades|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c3|nt|mamos: the hghly favourable Club position meant the defence had to secure a @club ruff|pg||
nt|drewsky: He also was very unlucky that both north AND south were BOTH speeding here in the bidding|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d9|pg||
