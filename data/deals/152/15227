mb|1S|nt|jan_jansma: Strong @C vs strong @C here?|pg||

mb|3S|nt|jcwla: The competing teams, from Europe and the United States, consist of 12 players each and include one Womens pair and five Open pairs.|pg||

nt|jcwla: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||

nt|jcwla: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this should be axed|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  well over the top|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: Of course Rodwell isn't overjoyed at bidding 3@S but he doesn't have much option.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcwla: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D is constructive|pg||
nt|jcwla: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
nt|jcwla: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared.  Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: note South's response on a 1-count |pg||
nt|jcwla: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, we will have the Individual. Each player has drawn a player from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared. Each player partners each of the other eleven ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: players on their team for a short set (6 boards) against various partnerships from the other team.  Each team has agreed on a standard convention card for this event.|pg||
nt|sybarra: need your guessing shoes on in either contract however |pg||
nt|mrdct: now the challenge is to hold this to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1@H and 3@C to lose here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: usually partner will X in response to P|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay very well for n/s    can make 4@S as well |pg||

nt|roswolf: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||

nt|jcwla: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|psridhar: this may go all the way to 6s, a faulty contract !|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N the likely destination here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrt2000: not a great start for Mexwell|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i think that was wrong the undoubled undertricks may not compensate for the n/s partscore|pg||
nt|roswolf: even -3 might lose the board to -170|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mrdct: meck has a good look at dummy's stiff @CK|pg||

nt|drewsky: Good Morning, Bridge World :)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: oops|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|andyv:  just a matter of how many overtricks here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: much discussion on system|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry, a bit ahead of myself !|pg||
nt|athene: and two down will be pretty much impossible i would imagine|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C certainly wasn't a routine action so this might be a swing for europe|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|daman: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably 2 off|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psridhar: 5s shd make if trumps are played properly|pg||
nt|daman: it cannot cost him to play a trump to the 9|pg||
nt|psridhar: helgemo/helness managed to beat it though !|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|othered1: And 1N was making, likely with overtricks|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but obvious for West to bid 2@s|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mrdct: good start for europe|pg||
nt|athene: East's discard on the @DK asked for a heart, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer only had the @HK it would be necessary to play a heart through to get the second undertrick|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't want to ruff, of course, as soon as he sees dummy |pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING - BUFFETT CUP - USA  70  EUR  62  ****|pg||
nt|roswolf: these matches are played in 12 bd sets|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrt2000: I wonder how they managed 12 tricks in the other room?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Ah, now corrected|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sJ|nt|yvesj49: strange card|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he knows the entire distribution so severing dummy before end-playing declarer|pg||
nt|yvesj49: they are sleeping ???|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We are stuck I'm afraid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tables crashing in numbers at the moment|pg||
nt|yvesj49: better table crashing than plane lol|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|daman: West will not go down|pg||
nt|ady: yes could be important not to go down 4 which could have been the case on a spade lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: remember The competition includes Pairs, Teams and an Individual. All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: available: a win, a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
nt|ady: Meckstroth can gain entry 3 times including a diamond ruff to play a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: -4 might still be possible|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|drewsky: Do we know who is sitting N-S ?|pg||
mc|9|nt|xenya: we knew a minute ago|pg||

mb|2D!|an|clubs|nt|psridhar: thats difficult to comprehend dia duck|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, one imp as 3N was played by W in OR and @d lead went into the AQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wellcome to Venky|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome even|pg||
nt|athene: if East shows a limit raise in hearts, West won't like his hand that much|pg||
nt|athene: the spades are bad because there are over-ruffs threatened|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Board-a-match throughout|pg||

nt|andyv:  hi Venky|pg||
nt|rv: Hi all, warm welcome from Bangalore in South India|pg||
mb|3C|nt|odysseus69: no not a board a match - over 11 boards each pair is competing gainst a specific pair from the other team|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont know who is playing weak NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Fantoni-Nunes, I think |pg||
mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: I knew :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks almost easier than 4 @S actually |pg||
nt|ady: think a slip up in the play playing clubs as it turns out|pg||
nt|yvesj49: slam in @h ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: zia went -3 in the same contract in the other room|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2@s west 3@h east ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: possible yves|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mrdct: helpful lead|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 660 next hand :)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: IN FRANCE LIKE THIS LOL|pg||
nt|yvesj49: oops sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 28-20 i heard|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Andy, Roland and all specs, 2 great pairs playing here, what more can I a bridge lover ask for:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: With all that said, hi Mike.  Looks like a very good result for Europe on Board 1.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you need the 1NT in "sandwich" position to be natural against this EW pair. They open and respond very light. |pg||
nt|daman: weak Smolen|pg||
nt|sybarra: at imps you might be in 4 @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Hi Jordan|pg||
nt|mdgraham: On the last board, East may be weak with a long suit. Lebensohl comes in handy (2NT puppets 3@C, then you can bid your long suit). A diretc bid shows reasonable values.|pg||
nt|ady: may be difficult to reach a slam|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psridhar: Brogeland seq asks for pd to pick a 2 level major nf|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@H can be beaten, so this not so good for Europe|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@H makes from the N hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a gadget strikes|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: the view in trumps will be crucial here|pg||
nt|athene: he might make even losing to both hearts - he certainly will want to finesse trumps to try to keep south from putting a spade through|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but the BAM scoring method makes a significant difference|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if you just need lots of entries to dummy you might play the @DA here, but he would quite like his second diamond trick|pg||
nt|athene: my guess he will go @DK, club to the ace, trump finesse, and then think about things|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: Boye always thinks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: claims would be easier in teams|pg||
nt|roswolf: he could win in hand and lay down the Ace of trumps - and I dont think that is an unreasonable line of play which would hit the jackpot here|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with winning the first trick in hand and playing a club for the trump finesse is you are using up your clubs before you really want to|pg||
nt|athene: for example @DK, club to ace, trump finesse loses, north plays a club straight back at you|pg||
nt|athene: and you have a nasty guess to make|pg||
nt|athene: if you play @DA here and a heart finesse you have a bit more breathing-space with the club suit|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't want to be cut off from the clubs before trumps are drawn|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence might be able to do that by attacking clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed bill but that is why laying down the ace is not reasonable|pg||
nt|roswolf: not unreasonable i meant!!|pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes but you really, really don't want to lose a trump to south|pg||
nt|athene: and have spade through and immediately lose @SAQ with a possible overruff on a third spade|pg||
nt|athene: i think you have to take lots of trump finesses through south|pg||
nt|roswolf: true that is why declarer's thinking|pg||
pc|d3|nt|daman: @C tap right away|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mrt2000: indeed so, but not from S!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unlikely to go down even from S...  J from Jx seems an unlikely choice|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: So West wasn't flying solo when he bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|psridhar: that attacking lead will tap decl trumps, but decl may not mind scoring his little trumps in a dummy reversal manner|pg||
nt|daman: West has to get the @Ss moving|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bigtrain: always 11 tricks available in @S...  @C lead holds 3N to 10|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good road to slam|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam never really in the picture|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 50%|pg||
pc|h5|nt|odysseus69: looks like 8 tricks i|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, S passed the 1@S opening and EW ended in 3@C.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: it seems duboin quite pessimist|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: so the "secret" so far is lead clubs agst. nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt many would lead clubs from Jxxx|pg||
nt|roswolf: a little worse i think and at BAM scoring not a good propostion - unless it makes of course!:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bigtrain: better lead than from Axxx imo|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: poor quality trumps|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: tempo seems to dictate a @C lead is best|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: 2-2 @D and @CK in the S hand allow 11 tricks it seems|pg||
pc|h4|nt|daman: this way looks OK as well|pg||
nt|mrt2000: really, I think it's likely to be the best attack at trick 1|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but east didn't bid 4@d a good new with bare ace|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
mc|11|nt|psridhar: Brogeland playing dummy reversal indeed|pg||

nt|yvesj49: we didn't see this board roland|pg||

nt|athene: this was really the auction? or you are just putting in the final contract?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think we're just catching up|pg||
nt|athene: yes, right, that seems more likely|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to our expert on the Meckwell system, Walter Johnson|pg||
nt|rv: this match is very much alive with 2.5 each after 5 brds|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any shape|pg||
nt|athene: you might well go down in 4@S here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcwla: On Board 3, Saelensminde led the @SK against 3NT and held it to five, so a win to Europe there.|pg||

nt|chessmaste: tough call for West|pg||

mb|3D|nt|chessmaste: how good is his hand for hearts\?|pg||
nt|drewsky: West has many choices....|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a lot of views to get right/wrong|pg||
mb|3H|nt|daman: 2NT was bizarre|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d showing one 6+M (rarely 5) is part of popular Woolsey convention|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they get the @D's in play |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D = 0-7 any shape|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Too strong to overcall 1@S?|pg||
nt|athene: lots of guessing to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: with NS playing precision there will be a delay in them finding their @d fit|pg||
nt|stigw: No, thats another question - but "meckwell" sometimes do starnge things (and usually come out successfully).|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: a prempt with an ace and a king on thee side and trump suit headed by jack may seem abnormal, but is often effective|pg||
nt|daman: in my youth I would have bid 5@C with the N hand and lucked out|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H = 4+ forcing, might have a longer minor|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe strange for general consumption but they are very disciplined within the structure|pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead will solve one problem|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: EW make 4@s easily enough, so NS's task is to locate a paying save|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 4+|pg||
nt|mrdct: if they do ever find it|pg||
nt|athene: but then @C10 switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the spades are actually fairlky useful as the cards lie|pg||
nt|drewsky: my que bidding he is over bidding but will enusre that he at least gets to the correct game.|pg||
nt|xenya: well W has been warned...|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the bidding was simple|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps more of a clue now|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 2D probably checkback|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d probably artificial GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: on the nother hand....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@D may buy it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would think 2 @D logical bid now but oh well.....|pg||
nt|mrdct: interesting that east didn't act over 1@c|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: this hand might take a while|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Duck the first trick and @H towards the @H9 looks best|pg||
nt|mrdct: east will be keen to score a trick with the @s2 and may try to duck a @c and then play !A and try to ruff one in her hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: the better plan may be to fire @ds back at the defence|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good lead !|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcwla: This is the type of board where "or it makes or it doesn't" -- E's actions really surprising.|pg||
nt|mrdct: the defence need to be careful too not to get frisky with playing @h and giving south unwanted ruffs|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @ST return now? With the @S87 in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: I'm told we're awaiting a ruling on board 16|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: from OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Russell |pg||
nt|mrdct: @s10 is good as it sends the message to north that i have control of trumps - no ruffs needed|pg||
nt|athene: you have to rise the king to block them and play a diamond to the jack right away to set up a discard|pg||
nt|athene: maybe this is all findable|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't see why you should play for clubs 5-2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: east will be analysing how 5@d will fare here|pg||
nt|mrt2000: W needs to go quietly here|pg||
nt|yvesj49: trump promotion|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: snap|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South shows 3 spades and thats enough info for North|pg||
nt|lml: by and large the hand lies well for duboin|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oh dear ....................|pg||
nt|mrt2000: can make 5 now|pg||
nt|athene: you might just rely on @CA and @CQ both onside|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|psridhar: excellent shift|pg||
nt|athene: sorry you have to play trumps first otherwise north gets a club ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the bidding suggests distribution held by the defenders|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but the bidding would have been the same if south had @Sx @HA10xxx @DAxx @CAQ109|pg||
nt|athene: and if he does, the winning line is to put the jack on the @C10|pg||
nt|athene: we don't have a play record from the other room|pg||
nt|athene: so we don't know if zia was put to the test and passed it brilliantly :)|pg||
nt|athene: if he did it will surely be bulletin material|pg||
pc|cT|nt|odysseus69: no problems here with 2 out of 3 finesses right and no bad breaks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: useful here to have two raises over the double - a good raise and a weak raise. It looks like EW have no such agreement|pg||
nt|athene: boink|pg||
nt|athene: ok, now it's time for Brogeland to be a hero|pg||
nt|athene: i don't honestly see any reason to guess this right|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: e.g, 2@s=weak raise, 2@h=good raise |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|daman: they are in 5@C doubled in the OR|pg||
nt|mrdct: -500 may still win the board|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: there are a number of choices but pretty well everything works|pg||
nt|rv: losing an extra @s trick, but avoided a @h ruff in bargain|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bigtrain: no way do they reach 5@D|pg||
nt|stigw: Very good lead indeed.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|jan_jansma: "psyching xxx in @D now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this is all about -1 vs -2|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2 off|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|xenya: yes -- there is room for either @HK or @DA in the S hand -- but taking a @H hook looks normal|pg||

mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: 2@D = a good @H raise here|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: promising 4@H|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 1@D negative|pg||
nt|roswolf: with e/w both bidding amd north finding a neg double - south will have a tough judgment call in this auction|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 15-17|pg||
nt|athene: 1NT tends to bury both sides' fits|pg||
nt|roswolf: The competition includes Pairs, Teams and an Individual. All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 1@D showed 0-7 any shape|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: no, with AKQJ seventh and a raise, it's not a bad idea to just bid game |pg||
nt|rv: Rodwell's must have devalued @CK and felt he had too little to bid 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: Meck 3 level O/C possibly showed what we had and felt competing to 4 level is too risky esp in this form of scoring|pg||
nt|rv: very well judged by both of them and they are in line to get +100 for their troubles|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: double could be penalty, but more likely it shows three-card heart support |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D is to play|pg||
nt|roswolf: whoops|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yvesj49: agresive lead|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S just shows 4_@S|pg||

nt|athene: i certainly wouldn't want to pass 1nt out with the east hand - but it might be hard to show a 1-suiter in diamonds, depending on their methods|pg||
nt|athene: he is a passed hand which gives him a lot more options as double can't be for penalties any more even if it is usually |pg||
nt|athene: the board is already won for USA here anyway|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: doesnt matter though|pg||
nt|bigtrain: as long as he doesn't break @S it doesn't matter|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: When North goes up with the @CA he is sorta marked with the @CQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: if he doesnt cash the club he doesnt get it |pg||
nt|jan_jansma: but then declarer will discard the @S6 later|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but then he gets a @S in lieu|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: I typed quicker :):)|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok so all the same at the end of the day |pg||
nt|jan_jansma: unless Rodwell plays a @S now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: typing wasn't the problem...  i misspelled lieu the first time  :)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: LOLLLLL|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4 a push at 1@S/W making 2.|pg||
nt|athene: as the diamonds and clubs were wide open|pg||

pc|h8|pc|d8|nt|odysseus69: trump lead was best- |pg||

nt|vugraphzrg: Helness deep in thought|pg||
nt|athene: we might see a crocodile coup|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: e.g. cash @H2, exit club, west plays queen, east overtakes to put a diamond through|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to cash the @SJ too of course sorry|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psridhar: oh not imps, but BAM, i stand corrected |pg||
nt|mrt2000: good card|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I suspect this is going off now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|odysseus69: 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if eventually West ducks declarer will revert to cross ruff|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|xenya: now she can set up a @H trick, which means an easy 11|pg||
nt|athene: now he has set up dummy's long club|pg||
nt|athene: he can exit a spade but declarer just wins and plays the @H2 throwing the @D2, then a club|pg||

nt|psridhar: one point to note is -if your rho waited for u to  sign off in 3d before balancing -instead of directly acting over 3c- u can infer he needed the comfort of your 3d sign off-|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 20 5 @D bid in the other room |pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct: EW likely to get to 3NT here|pg||
nt|roswolf: those of you watching should not attempt the same!!!:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: +450 n/s is a good score for europe in the other room|pg||

nt|athene: meckstroth knows his side has a lot of hcp|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mrt2000: cannot see this being beaten|pg||

nt|roswolf: fairly standard over a possible phoney club|pg||

pc|d2|nt|psridhar: thats 4 h tricks for rodwell when only 3 existed, but u gotta lead sommething...|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt unlikely imo |pg||
nt|yvesj49: easy 2 off|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like simple -2 and not a bad position for NS|pg||
nt|ady: might need to drop Q@C to make this|pg||
nt|athene: and with that many it's common to choose 3nt over a major as you expect to make the same 10 or 11 tricks in either denomination|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|odysseus69: undo to correct|pg||
nt|rv: as a rule of thumb, bids in balancing seat could be 2-3 hcp less than bids in direct seat|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|bigtrain: there wasn't a 3@C preempt thus hamman didn't suspect the short @C in N|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but there is a lot of play in this contract|pg||
nt|ady: if Declarer find out the diamond distribution  may go wrong with the clubs    possible for west to open with 11   5-5 in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: W thinking|pg||
nt|roswolf: however he may well rate west with the @CQ because of the opening bid|pg||
nt|ady: this is not clear cut  |pg||
nt|ady: we can all make looking at all cards    but not so easy in the hot seat|pg||
nt|roswolf: one of the true differences between expert declarers is how successful their card-reading is|pg||
nt|roswolf: the winners are those who get these hands right more often than not|pg||
nt|roswolf: sadly i dont:(|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcwla: The W hand becomes pretty huge opposite a raise; even with the max NT overcall in N, make a lot of tricks in @C without double-dummy defense.  Meanwhile, Levin may have taken ...|pg||

nt|sybarra: lot of work to do |pg||
nt|sybarra: for trick  8  if its there at all |pg||
nt|jan_jansma: If Rodwell takes the @DK with the A, Auken will make 3@D tricks|pg||
nt|yvesj49: if you guesse the @s and @d you can win 4@s lol|pg||

nt|rv: not conventional pre-empts as most of us play|pg||
pc|h4|nt|suketbombi: not using stayman helped here PS with  Rodwell has 16 HCP at these colours they dont play weak NT?|pg||
nt|xenya: normal 4@H that should go one down|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 8-13 i beleive|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S that is|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: you have to tread carefully in these positions. It's always annoying to have the option of letting the opposition play a making part-score when you might have made one your way, ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but you can't because pard takes your bid as stronger and bids game  |pg||

nt|jan_jansma: @DK now|pg||
nt|roswolf: since mechstroth needs 11 tricks to win the board this will be tight|pg||

nt|athene: did west give count in spades?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: and will east be able to read it?|pg||

nt|rv: Also please access the excellent new web-site hosted by Gavin Wolpert www.bridgewinners.com for USA captain Donna Compton's blog and other interviews|pg||

pc|d5|nt|psridhar: heading towards 490|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a very tricky hand ( I mean full of tricks):)|pg||
nt|lml: Europe won the board where Levin did not cash the @DA.  They led it|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: @DK would have made life more diff for Rodwell|pg||
nt|yvesj49: yes|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he just ducks twice and can never score the long diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: east may be squeezed in the endgame|pg||

pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: not that young :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although doubling 3@c was also possible.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jan_jansma: Now he will duck  the @DA for sure|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but 2@s an easy spot|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good defence from NS|pg||

nt|daman: claim|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a win for the USA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|odysseus69: there are contless variations after 2NT - here I am told that 3 hearts is no 4 or 5 card major and 3S is transfer to 3NT - new one for me|pg||
nt|athene: very sneaky small spade there at trick 2 from meckstroth -  a good example of the huge advantage declarer holds at trick 1|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|sybarra: ht pitch was a killer maybe? |pg||
nt|jan_jansma: oops, Sabine discarded her @H6|pg||

nt|brolucius: I once watched two world-champion Icelanders playing at the one-level with 26 points between. All down to the subtracted-king theory, not properly discussed.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East shows 5+ spades and 4 hearts, so that West can play the contract when there is a 5-3 (6-3) spade fit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To tie before the Indivual, yes|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Starting in 1 hour and 40 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4 rounds today, 7 tomorrow|pg||
nt|brolucius: With 5-4, or 4-5, you start with Stayman and then bid the four-card major - that's the idea of the convention.|pg||
nt|pelu: a very solid game - just need @Ss 3-2 or 4 in N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The inaugural event in 2006 in Ireland was won by USA, but Europe equalised two years later in Kentucky, USA|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was thinking that they had judged well not to look for a slam. It happens that West has a bundle of points in clubs, opposite Easts's void, so slam is a long way off.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So the conclusion must be that you need to be jet-lagged in order to win the Buffett Cup|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: The opening bid of 2NT is often described as the "slam-killer" |pg||

nt|othered1: Nice g ame try by east|pg||

nt|athene: not impossible with lots of points perhaps - same idea as previous hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: when you have a combined 29 count, you have enough stuff that you don't need the ruffs|pg||
mb|6S|nt|jcwla: Not opposite this S hand.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, if you had one bid for your life you'd just bid 6@C|pg||
nt|jcwla: With the N hand, any slam try becomes a question of small or grand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: even a Non @H lead may be the same result on the last hand as West would be squeezed in rounded sutit|pg||
nt|yvesj49: he will play Q@d from dummy|pg||
nt|yvesj49: after 5 rounds of @h|pg||
nt|yvesj49: at least 10 tricks|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or @c hoping QK in south|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: this contract also doomed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we can see that the grand is a dubious proposition|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: in 4@H he needs to finesse in @C for down 2 or making|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: diff in BAM|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Unfortunate lead has cost a trick|pg||
nt|lml: leading from a five card suit to the king is risky and yes it cost here|pg||
nt|othered1: since a @D bid is ambiguous as to length, the play on a standard auction, low towards dummy's @D isn't quite as applicable.|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow|pg||
nt|athene: can he make this on a small club lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|suketbombi: suits|pg||

nt|ady: 4@H can make for n/s    but 5@C  e/w  so anybodys guess how this turns out|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|xenya: a spade lead would have obviously defeated 4@H -- but hard to find|pg||
nt|athene: stick the jack in, ruff the clubs good, play two rounds of trumps and run clubs getting all the hearts away as south ruffs in with his trump trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: imo an outrageous punt|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bigtrain: 3NT is tough to get to but rates to make|pg||
nt|othered1: south knows he's defending for overtricks|pg||
nt|yvesj49: he plays against 4@h in other room|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|athene: a bit of a punt but not that outrageous|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the tempo of the auction will be important|pg||
nt|ady: yes    diamond lead beats 4 hearts  as pointed out|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcwla: 6NT normally calls for a "don't kick a trick lead" -- a twist here b/c S not a balanced hand, but still would be a contender for lead of the year had E found a @D there.|pg||

nt|athene: he thought that 4@C showed his hand|pg||

nt|bigtrain: waiting|pg||
nt|bigtrain: denies 5+M|pg||
nt|athene: redouble now to show equal length |pg||
mb|2H|nt|psridhar: spd lead spells doom for  this contract|pg||
nt|rv: this match is on knife-edge and great for spectators|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X says i want another lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: high-quality close match between 2 truly world class pairs|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yuk|pg||
mb|d|nt|yvesj49: 4@d|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@S = @D interest but doesn't want to go past 3N|pg||
nt|stigw: Maybe another 6 diamonds comming up here ?|pg||
nt|othered1: Can south find north's singleton?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: north's hand is enormous at @d trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w seem to be bidding a lot here -too much i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe meckwell have aldo been caught|pg||
nt|athene: East won't be all that happy about sitting this|pg||
nt|athene: he has fewer hearts than his partner will be expecting|pg||
nt|athene: if he bids, they may end up in 3nt|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rv: 2n seems to some form of sohl here|pg||
nt|mrdct: 8 quick tricks in 3NT but the 9th will be hard to find|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 0 = 0/2 in partner's suit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 9|pg||
nt|sybarra: a scramble here for 9 |pg||
nt|jan_jansma: she will try for the @Cq doubleton and quickly concedes down 1|pg||
nt|bigtrain: looks like all roads lead to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mrt2000: very likely|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it will be interesting to see his choice of lines|pg||
nt|bigtrain: easy to hold to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  E can play @D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it's always held to 9 with best defense|pg||
nt|roswolf: but at the vul he may be tempted to bid 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: possibly rumpelsohl where Nunes is showing weak competition in @ds|pg||
nt|rv: since Nunes is passed hand, I am not sure what direct 3@d would mean, it can;t possibly be Inv in @hs|pg||
nt|rv: maybe they play same system for ease on memory|pg||
nt|rv: it is very important aspect when you play complicated system |pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: maybe 2N was both minors, and correcting 3c to 3d he intends as a good 3D bid|pg||
nt|yvesj49: bingooooo|pg||
nt|bigtrain: N is in control...  although he can give it up|pg||
nt|stigw: I knew it !!!|pg||
nt|yvesj49: big shot|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: spade switch needed|pg||
nt|athene: tricky decision for west|pg||
nt|athene: if he knew it was 300 at the other table of course he would bid 3nt - he has nothing to lose|pg||
nt|roswolf: well now the play is irrelevant|pg||
pc|sT|nt|diumraid: ******  LIVE IN RUNNING ****** BUFFETT CUP ******   USA  38 -  EUR 22  ******  Last Round of the Day.  Teams tomorrow with another 72 points at stake. ******|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this is the best chance|pg||
nt|mrt2000: small @D now|pg||
nt|othered1: Very well done|pg||
nt|yvesj49: nicely bidded|pg||
nt|ady: no way out of -2 |pg||
pc|s2|nt|rv: that makes more sense as a few very knowlegable kibitzers suggest|pg||
nt|rv: looks like auction has gone off rails|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure Fantoni is not in same wavelength as Nunes here|pg||
nt|rv: consolation for rest of us is that it happens to the best in the world:)|pg||
nt|rv: Fantoni's bid is a bit strange, practically he could have worked out to pass 3@d since partner passed 1NT and can't be inviting now|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rv: I dare to say common-sense:)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'll be disappointed if he doesn't find the shift...  he should know declarer's shape|pg||
nt|yvesj49: by one of the greatest world's pair|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
nt|yvesj49: they play together since at least 20 years i think|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzrg: much long thought by Fantoni|pg||
nt|bigtrain: looks like it didn't matter what happened here|pg||
nt|rv: Fantoni trying his best to salvage this board, he doesn't know what happened in OR, German ladies have given 1100|pg||
nt|rv: only saving grace is 2 bad boards for Europe on same deal, hence loss is halfed|pg||
nt|yvesj49: maybe more|pg||
nt|bigtrain: since 1978|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yvesj49: wow 32!|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i wasn't born.......apologizes|pg||
nt|stigw: It might have neede sp K right, but now I think it's lay-down without (even for ROD !!! - ha ha).|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: quick down 1 indeed|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcwla: 7 a push at 4@S/W making 5.|pg||
nt|othered1: Would have been even better to get this played by north, but you can't h ave everything|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|roswolf: no double no trouble as they say - this is a fair score in comparison with a heart partcore|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So  4-4  with this match to be scored|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|yvesj49: AK @h in West|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psridhar: pitched too many dia|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: Claims on ruffing finesse|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably ok lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 8-4  4-8  6-6  all possible|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|rv: only legitimate chance for Fantoni was to play Meck for stiff @DA, strange line adopted by him|pg||
nt|rv: maybe he was playing for less UTs|pg||
nt|ady: n/s might make 3@H   so may not lose the board|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|psridhar: hoping for cl finesse no doubt|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is a win for USA so the best Europe can hope for is to tie this match|pg||

mb|d!|an|cards|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: Thanks Geoff, great job given the hopeless circumstances|pg||

mb|3S|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: USA has won 4 consecutive boards now|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: no BAM scoring n/s will likely lose the board|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk4: Europe can hardly win this board |pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  good result in OR|pg||

mb|3H|nt|jan_jansma: canape|pg||
nt|mrdct: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6-4 bid more for east|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 3@S now?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 4@S?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3NT by NS here|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks another winning board for the usa|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rv: yes great result by Zia-Hamman in OR, tough for Fantunes to replicate|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is instructive that South at both tables went all the way to 3@H (following the Law of Total Trumps: 5+4 = 9, so contract for 9 tricks) even though they were vulnerable against ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: not. Something to remember.|pg||
nt|mrdct: perhaps a splinter if available|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a yucky vul weak2 imo - no suit quality|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@H shows 6+@H GF|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: will Meck sit for that?|pg||
nt|mrdct: or just bang out 4@s|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: against the agressive ladies....|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i suspect a second X|pg||
nt|sybarra: or does he bid 5 @C?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: I predict pass or 5@C, no double... Lets see|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he'll pass before bidding 5@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: or pass is option also |pg||
nt|mrdct: lots of options for north|pg||
nt|bigtrain: my order of guesses is X,P,P,5@C|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: OK lets vote|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D shows 8-10 BAL|pg||
nt|stigw: Beautifully bidding as I see it, but maybe the inteference helped this time.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: ahem|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S is forcing (4+)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1N = 0-5|pg||

nt|yvesj49: 3*|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: e/w may well get overboard|pg||

nt|rv: we could see the first tie of this edition of Warren Buffet Cup|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So Europe win this session 12-2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @H4 = @D|pg||
nt|athene: he might not be too happy with -100 if 4@H makes (@SQ, maybe @DJ onside)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bigtrain: N upgraded his 15-count to open 1@C|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hA|nt|stigw: Meck "knew" that K 3rd of sp was sitting behind !|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|diumraid: :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they play reverse suit preference|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Sabine needs to avoid "cashing" the @HK here|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: was the @C9 showing the @HQ?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: bye all i've to go nice match lol|pg||

nt|Walddk4: So USA wins this set 8-4|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: lets see if the @C9 did its work here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that should finish this set|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: I think the @C9 WAS a Smith signal, saying she liked the lead (so she has the @HJ)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Russell,  was that last bd? |pg||
nt|jan_jansma: And with the @S2 being Udca, Sabine knows North has a 2146|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: She does need Danielle to hold the @DQJ to make the @S return neces.|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Without the @C9 most experts might get this wrong|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Í predict she will get it right and plays a @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: For new spectators. Number of boards in the Teams has been cut down from 14 to 12 per session as the players have requested longer breaks. Start times unchanged    but this seems ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: odd last bd given that earlier announcement |pg||
