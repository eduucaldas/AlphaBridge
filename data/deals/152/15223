nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||

pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: as long as declarer has 2 trumps, yes|pg||

nt|h_karluk: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
nt|udo: 2@C ( for majors) passed out in the other room|pg||

nt|h_karluk: players. her most important person in her life is her husband Mr Sid Brownstein :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: NA style is to o/c with the S hand as opposed to a t/o dble|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. But Americanized, 1/2 added |pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1-0 Hampson here|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: hmmm|pg||
mb|3C|an|6!C|nt|haans: Mackwell cxomparing with Helgemo|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: 1-0 to Europe  as Fantoni Nunes stopped in 2@S in OR|pg||

mb|3D!|an|asks|nt|h_karluk: this is a wild contest, reminds me "topgun" movie :) we will see best of bests|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: the auction took some twists and turns - 3nt looked alikely contract   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hello welcome back|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jacksond: south can bid 2s on her second bid because they play2/1 forcing to game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts are not friendly|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||

nt|tejjyid: if the scores are tied, each side receives .5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so an overtrick is equal to a slam bonus|pg||

mb|1N!|an|forcing|nt|h_karluk: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||

nt|oliverc: NT's the only making game here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still safe|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am ok to 3@d as East|pg||
nt|haans: 4@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi Jon, good to see you again|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: berkowitz would definitely have hard times|pg||
nt|jacksond: hi jon|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1NT (F) to show a weak @S raise later|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kiwi_joker: ..and in this form of scoring, losing the board by 10 is same as losing it by 1400 ... its  a minus|pg||
nt|mcphee: because it only gets 1 trick at most and may pass timing to the offense|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score  hand    looks like 10 tricks in clubs for n/s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you can also put your partner to an early hook|pg||
nt|westjava: cant find a @S lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unlucky lead, helps to decl to pitch @d loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however transportation problem|pg||
nt|jacksond: in fact of course he has no diamond loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we see that, dK stiff|pg||
nt|jbgood: will not be easy to get the 11 needed to half the board|pg||
nt|jacksond: stiil hard to make 11 tricks as i other room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: who would not try @cQ hook then @sK wehen hold pitch a @d at hand|pg||
nt|rado: 4@S has a little better chanses than 4@H|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: experts NEVER pass an opening bid from partner (at Teams) nonvul vs vul) !!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: NEVER|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: (not to get to game themselves, but to prevent the oppo from reaching one)|pg||

pc|dT|nt|mamos: again 3NT looks an obvious place to play|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: @H4 out|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *when|pg||

nt|stc: best lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: today bobby levin and alan sontag starred about the opening leads|pg||
nt|oliverc: Difficult to get the hand wrong, though|pg||
nt|udo: if she places @C king with south,,she can win and finesse @H for @C discard,,has to risk diamond to hand and hope they are not 5-0|pg||
nt|stc: the Q is if you take the hook in @h or not|pg||
nt|oliverc: right|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes but @d lead would help declarer, pitches @c|pg||
nt|haans: double: in case you want to pass|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|oliverc: will just claim 11, I guess|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|haans: 6nt not easy|pg||
nt|haans: sqz possibilities|pg||
nt|mamos: Meckstroth Rodwell 's +140 beat Helegemo Helness' 130 on Board 1  to win the first board for them  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: fantoni would obviously try to knock out @h AK|pg||
nt|ady: sensible auction  though if Meyers could have doubled 3@S for penalties that would win the board|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @CJ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: @s lead and? :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the answer is Brogeland:)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: or Q|pg||
pc|c8|nt|oliverc: but only 10 available|pg||
nt|h_karluk: clubs|pg||
nt|ady: J@D lead can get 300|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|oliverc: Can't afford the @D to hand, though as it exposes the K@D once North takes the A@S|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: sing @H now looks normal|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: The norwegians have bid 6NT on this hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: I mean there is no net gain|pg||

pc|h7|nt|haans: ahalim: W will be strip-squeezed ME agree|pg||

nt|udo: not to forget the 2@C bid of course|pg||
nt|mcphee: the next @H applies pressure on S hand|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|haans: not clubs lead in 6nt|pg||
nt|mamos: 5NT looks like pick a slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3-3 @h break then makeable one|pg||
pc|hT|nt|stc: another chance|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i shut my eyes not to see @h hook|pg||
nt|udo: next door NS bid 1@H and 3 @H so @C and @D never mentionned|pg||
nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
nt|oliverc: The hand pretty much an open book now, though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@h? oh acolish|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,the brothers|pg||
nt|udo: acol|pg||

nt|westjava: Zia-Hamman also loose their match|pg||
nt|mcphee: that board is also a possible swing|pg||
nt|jacksond: no style points for norwegians there looking for slam missing three aces|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: major minor battle|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good luck to our operators, the guys at the table are REAL PROFESSIONALS, i believe 2nd day everything would become easier|pg||
mb|1N|an|(14)15-17|nt|westjava: I suspect it|pg||
nt|mcphee: mexican 2@D |pg||
nt|mcphee: a handy toy in fact|pg||
nt|westjava: can explain,Bob?|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N might well be a choice here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: antonio sementa is 19th rank in world grandmasters list|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@D open|pg||
nt|westjava: I am told 18-19 balance|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to have a worldgrandmaster title you must be world champ and lotsa placing points|pg||
nt|mcphee: mexican 2@D for strong 18-19 balanced hands, balanced, no 5 card suit I believe is how this pair use it|pg||
nt|mcphee: the 5 card suits alter a hand a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: do assume 2@S som form or reverse Flannery |pg||
nt|mamos: ahggressive bidding as usual from NS  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s ok, depends @h guess - two way @h J hook|pg||
nt|h_karluk: believe me they are good enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: this saves a lot of energy|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Bob|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Aggregate score after 2 rounds: Europe-USA 8-16|pg||
nt|h_karluk: slam for Ns|pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@H or 4@S here look the lightly spots|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S?|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@h looks odd|pg||
nt|haans: does 2@S show extra?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: ty Roland|pg||
nt|haans: rare 3rd hand opening in vul|pg||
nt|haans: good 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: EW leads are quite compex, and their explanation is rather hushed - sorry!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think low show even engouraging, or odd discouraging|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mamos: 5@D making so Italians certainly needed to bid 5@S|pg||
nt|rado: 1@H made harder for EW|pg||
nt|haans: 3rd hand wins again|pg||
nt|mamos: in OR|pg||
nt|jbgood: Duboin decided to enter the bidding in the OR - cost the board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they have many special gadgets but unfortunately yet not much hands occurred to show that skills|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: i thought walddk7 new at th town and not experienced like boss, but i m caught :) gr8|pg||
nt|rado: 8 or 9 tricks might produce this lead|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @D3,@D8 being considered|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos: and 6@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The inaugural event in 2006 in Ireland was won by USA, but Europe equalised two years later in Kentucky, USA.|pg||
nt|mamos: Helness  passed 2@S|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry 2@H|pg||
pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mamos: slightly odd position for West  p opens the bidding  oppo bid a slam and you need to save|pg||
nt|haans: maybe 2 clubs losers|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|haans: most use WJS so 2@S could not be a minimum hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: as you have a lot of stress rebidding over a 2NT rebid from partners|pg||
nt|westjava: and 2nt is forcing?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Italians try a new partnership : Augustin Madala  Antonio Sementa, i guess in five years that will give good results|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: i think 2@d over x would give much chances, ie responder would raise to 4@c --  i know it tells 6/4 @h+@s|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h not easy to find|pg||
pc|c8|nt|westjava: yeah,2nt opening is ghost for me!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|haans: @H right|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: i hope 1@c alerted|pg||

nt|oliverc: I would think everyone here was alerted :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @hA+9 would be interesting|pg||
pc|d7|nt|oliverc: everything|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's true mf|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: with 11 points|pg||
nt|mcphee: those 2N jump rebids also eat up room creating little issues|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: well played|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|haans: Jumping to 2M = to weak to bid natural :)|pg||
nt|mamos: I can imagine that at some tables EW will be bidding minors|pg||
nt|haans: 1@d-1@S-2@d- do you have cards for 2@H forcing?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they did it with a delay and different way, w passed, then after xx |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: say allowed by both then @c9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but @h 8 still firm even covered|pg||
nt|jbgood: Sælensminde is back to playing Broge's "old" system - more or less the same Broge played with Odin Svendsen i Pau this summer|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: found a good line to make 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems speedy gonzales at the field, gl Russell|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: nice short auction :)|pg||
nt|udo: 5th push board in a row|pg||
nt|udo: now way to go wrong, and no way for 11|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
pc|hT|nt|h_karluk: two hearts and a spade for defenders|pg||
nt|westjava: some one told me : nt=trf to 3@c, 3@d=trf to 3@h: to play or slam try, 4@h mild slam try @h|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|haans: @HQ chance play|pg||
nt|mamos: Rodwell attacking his side suit first|pg||
nt|Walddk7: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. However, the scoreboard is americanized for obvious reasons, so we ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: must live with 1-½-0 on the scoreboard. I am sure you can figure it out regardless|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer claims after touching trump|pg||
nt|jacksond: of course helgemo/helness didnt play in Pau so Norway didnt do well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.clairebridge.com/brogelandcollage.htm   many photos there|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @D6 exit?|pg||

nt|diumraid: **** BUFFETT CUP IN RUNNING Currently USA 50  EUR 46****|pg||

nt|mcphee: well well 3N must be a bad minor pre-empt|pg||
nt|mcphee: bad suit that is what I mean|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3N always cold|pg||
nt|westjava: I am with you Bob|pg||

nt|h_karluk: @cQ lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: EW will surely bid and make 4@S here|pg||
nt|udo: same biding so far|pg||
nt|stc: I don't see what can go wrong if dec plays trump before @d (keeping the 10@h in dummy)|pg||
nt|udo: in the other room 2@H-4@H followed now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or @c lead and @h back|pg||
nt|westjava: what's wrong with 3@D opening?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: they were good enough : 1 Boye BROGELAND - Espen LINDQVIST Norway 0.82 2. 2 Claudio NUNES - Fulvio FANTONI Italy 0.71|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|an|4!S or 23+|nt|haans: 4@S no make|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzrj: board being played with Sontag as N!!!|pg||
nt|oliverc: can they stop at 3@S?|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps they are playing transfer pre-empts|pg||
mb|2C|an|short !C and other options|nt|h_karluk: honestly surprised to 1@s overcall, 2@s fine in many books, glad Ron Klinger did not see that overcall|pg||
nt|haans: odds for going wrong in spades|pg||
nt|westjava: heheh|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: just three red tricks to lose|pg||

mb|4S|nt|ady: if so that wont work|pg||

nt|haans: but tempting|pg||
nt|ady: might stop out of game|pg||
nt|westjava: *for|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but in practice very hard to find @c lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: might be tempted to play this one in NT instead of spades, because of the allure of the higher score|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems angels whisper to try 5@d|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt easier to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: most players prefer to pick a M suit opening lead |pg||
nt|mcphee: how hard is it to find A@H lead against 3N?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and Boye Brogeland, still the world's top ranked Junior|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: diet coke with gree lime time, brb|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *green lime|pg||
nt|jacksond: its a long story hamdi but of course Boye is World champion and it was unfortunate that for whatever reason Norway didnt field their strongest team in the last ewuroean ...|pg||
nt|jacksond: Championships|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: a short suit game try at the 2 level. I never saw that before|pg||
nt|rado: will declarer find Q trumps:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kiwi_joker: hmm.. didnt think it would die at the 2 level|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 2@h cue not fit as obv seen, just stopper|pg||

nt|mamos: it's difficult to imagine this auction at imp scoring|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@d could be fatal|pg||
nt|haans: solid bidding|pg||
nt|mamos: North had a good hand  Im not sure shed quite expect this shape from South   but game reached :)|pg||
nt|ady: so far|pg||
nt|haans: question is could N pass 4@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: AJtx|pg||
nt|jbgood: club shift?|pg||
nt|jbgood: not that it is needed - 3@h will go down 1 on any defense (but one)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it wasn't Norway's decision, NPC Paul Hackett of England has selected twelve players from different countries of Europe|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed Oliver|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: if he could pass 4@D  I am sure he would not on that hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: my guess is that would be the normal opening lead to gambling 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: short spades|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|mcphee: then the @C swithc is obvious|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you lose when K onside and p has Q, just give up a trick|pg||
nt|jbgood: now 2 down|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: falcons vs pigeons, let's see which wing would rise the trophy|pg||

nt|mamos: she|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: This board will not be scored at this board :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: I will open 3N against you more often then:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant long minor|pg||
pc|dK|nt|westjava: for gambling 3nt, I lead a gambling honour at other (M) suit|pg||
nt|jacksond: 2NT in other romm was a grwat result for europe and was  likely to win board anyway.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: diet coke sweetened with splenda also good, however i prefer diet coke lime|pg||

nt|oliverc: there are defences to precision that would overcall 1NT here :)|pg||
nt|westjava: and NS will save by 5@D?:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: meyers wastes not time reaching 3N:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and there's a passed partner|pg||
nt|mcphee: i bet against save|pg||
mb|3N|nt|oliverc: no reason for Berkowitz to do anything other than bid it|pg||
nt|oliverc: 1NT probably round or sharp given the 3@C bid|pg||

nt|mcphee: or natural:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers considers @D10|pg||
nt|h_karluk: since 2 boards a tad aggressive approach to cards|pg||

nt|oliverc: high|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or slip in defense|pg||

mb|d|nt|h_karluk: as Bob read it|pg||
nt|mamos: not necessarily Hamdi  may be cue|pg||

nt|h_karluk: s also true Mike|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so there's not a novel layout problem, but the matter is to tell yr clubs to partner|pg||

pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: medically referred to as "desynchronosis," is a physiological condition which is a consequence of alterations to circadian rhythms.|pg||
nt|westjava: did you open 1nt or 1 @H, Bob?|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  Jet lag results from rapid long-distance transmeridian (east-west or west-east) travel, as on a jet plane.|pg||

nt|oliverc: who says crime doesn't pay :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: haha|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: none|pg||
nt|mamos: an everyday Zia auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: just the odd mutter|pg||
nt|h_karluk: here we go guys|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the penultimate board there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still total 12 boards there Ant?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: yes, 12 boards this match|pg||
mb|1D!|an|nat 14+ unbal, 5 unless 4441|mb|p|nt|ady: I think last hand of the session?|pg||

mb|p|nt|westjava: sure|pg||

nt|h_karluk: thanks then we have 3 more including this one|pg||
nt|jacksond: started on bd 15 so 3 more|pg||
mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: 3NT never quiet at BAM :)|pg||
mb|3N|an|fast arrival|nt|haans: Do they change pair to compare with?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: that's a good lead for the defence|pg||
nt|mamos: No Haans I thin they compare throughout with same opponent|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Boca Raton Florida players lucky, this year i was busy a lot, hope in 2011 will visit there to see some familiar faces, including Larry Mori, SC-FL not much distance|pg||
nt|westjava: aha:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: NS play upside-down count|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is a trick taking game and i am not volunteer to fool my partner at any phase of the game|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Ant|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: routine 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: no we started at 15   so although session length has been changed 14  we have two to play after thisboards to 12 |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 12 boards a session|pg||
nt|haans: 10 board should be 14|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: declarer's hand is a little lacking ................:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting 2@h and x as passed hands|pg||
nt|jbgood: Broge has a problem - will he go for the @d game (or slam)? or NT?|pg||
nt|jacksond: disadvange of the splinter is that it allowed north to indicate a lead|pg||
nt|rado: yes right :)|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING - BUFFET CUP - USA  64  EUR  56  ****|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: For many of us it has been a first seeing BAM in action|pg||
nt|reisig: I live in the same area|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i know|pg||
nt|jbgood: the former - it is only 420 against the overtrick for 430 in NT|pg||
nt|jacksond: 1nt  3nt MIGHT HAVE GOT A HEART LEAD|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in the good old days Texas Aces were using a similar bid, Goldman's 3@h/3@s after NT described a mild slam interest in @c/@d, but with different shape |pg||
nt|jbgood: not to mention the bigger score for the @d slam bid and made in the OR|pg||
pc|s9|nt|westjava: I hear that they play 12 boards only, Ant?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: yes, reduced from 14 after a request from both teams as I understand it|pg||
nt|mcphee: meyers might try a low @S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the worst is to see ak10 spilit when u lead fm Qj9 etc :)|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty Ant|pg||
nt|mcphee: she can see future exit issues|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers asks about Sementa's possible @D holdings - answer: 4+|pg||
nt|h_karluk: was a carbon copy auction except 5/6@d|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: more interesting 2@s decision|pg||
nt|haans: nice :)|pg||
nt|ady: ok thx|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jbgood: Hapson took a good shot in the OR - direct 6 @d even after an original pass by prd|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|westjava: tourney website http://www.buffettcup.com/Home/tabid/53/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|mcphee: Sementa still in the dark where these major suit Q's are|pg||
nt|h_karluk: major suit guesses there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: missing queens, one should decide abt lesser evil|pg||
nt|mcphee: he will gain a discard on the J@C but it is not so helpful|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Geoff shoot the moon|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mamos: Spades first?|pg||
nt|ady: ak@S   low heart to queen?|pg||
nt|haans: at least 10|pg||

nt|haans: :) We´ll meet again :) |pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzrj: J asking abt leading methods|pg||
nt|mamos: this could have been worse for declarer but defence seems in control|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: so headed for -1|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sabine started to dance around|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: no still sitting quietly LOL:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: luckily got Ktx @c at the table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: woohoo, lol|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|jacksond: Yes in the long run it is useful to be able to show a minor suited hand and a short major suit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|reisig: Balancing is dangerous (although tempting) when Vul w 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: smile always smile, even it's bitter or sad, never reveal the color, just poker face cool :)|pg||
nt|stc: -1 and board for Europe ?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: obviously|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mamos: this looked more like an imps auction than Bam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : previous deal @d J was the only card to set it more|pg||
nt|mamos: no game making|pg||
nt|mcphee: guess  1 worked great:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i bet he watched Meyers playing tempo|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: the low @H was smooth|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|haans: -2?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yes, you are right - if he finds a spade now|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|h_karluk: deception ended|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mamos: Rodwell's underlead of @H suggested he wanted Meckstroth to start Spades from North|pg||
nt|ady: aI would bet on 11|pg||
nt|mamos: using the Club entry first might be safer|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|mcphee: Meyers plays in tempo always|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: not rushed either|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mamos: this is going well for decalrer|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mamos: for an ordsinary player to commentate on the World greats is a privilege   sometimes  daunting  -- scared to make oneself look foolish  but its fantastic to see the care of players ...|pg||
nt|mamos: like Rodwell |pg||
nt|ady: sing club bad for west|pg||

nt|ady: if returns a spade  I am sure declarer will getg a complet picture|pg||
pc|c6|nt|stc: sry, -2, I was in 2@c :(|pg||
nt|h_karluk: by not bidding 4@h at once|pg||
nt|haans: and will tell that now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mcphee: J@S a sly discard|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: her Heart discard was a mistake i think|pg||

nt|oliverc: EW look to have 6 tricks against 2@S|pg||
