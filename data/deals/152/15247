nt|vugraphzrm: East uncertain what kind of game try was made.....|pg||
nt|athene: you can't count your heart honours and your ruffing value as two separate things really|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|athene: at least that does mean they can't draw east's third trump to stop a spade ruff|pg||

nt|vugraphzrm: Sarah in deep thought. Just touched the @C8|pg||

nt|peachy: well thought-out lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Hard for me to understand that this does not show 5 hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: thornton could have describe his hand by bidding 3spades over 2diamonds if that was a splinter|pg||
nt|mrt2000: makes a @S lead to beat this|pg||
nt|athene: south might regret not doubling 3@S|pg||
nt|mrt2000: which is why I think S should have X'd 3@S|pg||
pc|c5|nt|robinswr: if he doubled 3spades, they might not get to 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't they get one more chance?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: They do|pg||
nt|mrt2000: possibly so|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Björnlund will surely switch to a spade|pg||

nt|mrt2000: ruff it in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: when a defender has long trumps like this you can often grab 8 tricks or so with fast winners and ruffs and then you know the defender is down to all trumps and he has to ruff ...|pg||
nt|athene: something and lead into you at the end|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I told them to take 9 winners before the auction started|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the first half now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Guy Hart, our excellent operator in London|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and to our commentators, Bill, Steve and Paul|pg||
nt|robinswr: no 1heart opener?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: the vulnerability will probably keep Sarah quiet|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: A short break now|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: west keeps holding 1-4-4-4 shape|pg||
nt|athene: that sort of thing is enough to put anyone off bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I dson't think it's worth more than 2@H|pg||
nt|mrt2000: @CK lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: this and the last board being played upside-down|pg||
nt|athene: (or make them take up roman club, which handles such hands perfectly at the cost of messing up all the others)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: so the names are interchanged|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is that if you play a weak notrump, 1@D - 1@H; 2@H shows a good hand|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: on board 12 |pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi|pg||
nt|khaled_m: 5@D needs a spade guess|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi dennis |pg||
mb|3H|nt|peachy: yes. Well opening easy, it is the followups :) :) :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kerasidis: nice to see you all guys!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: Hello Dennis|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: seems 1 down 4@H normal contract in IMp,s style |pg||
nt|kerasidis: could make if finesse dia|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: defence has to open @C trick to make 4 & a  -1 |pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: Club lead was "never " coming, but this will do, any thing except cash 2 rounds of diamond|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jameslee 2: with lead work has to be done still from defence |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kerasidis: possible with this lead if finesse dia lets see intersting|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: time to play K@C |pg||
nt|khaled_m: or small|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: or makes |pg||
nt|kerasidis: i see trump|pg||
nt|khaled_m: i think @C shift obvious looking at dummy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: long think ! |pg||
nt|peachy: It is fortunate for defense that the choice here is clear|pg||
nt|peachy: no diam = declarer's suit, no spades ' into the tenace|pg||
nt|khaled_m: declarers early @D play suggest also helps|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|kerasidis: K@c ccan confuse declarer|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|kerasidis: where is the Q?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: obvious defence came up |pg||
nt|kerasidis: discarding a dia maybe|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jameslee 2: can go -2 |pg||
nt|kerasidis: here is the time for decisions|pg||
nt|khaled_m: yes |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|peachy: he should look the "gift horse" in the mouth and decide if the Q was with South, S woulld maybe not play it|pg||
