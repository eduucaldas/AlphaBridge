nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably 2@s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bigtrain: P is forcing followed by 4@S shows a flexible hand|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi Ed|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have 5@C  assuming getting club right|pg||
nt|ady: hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: a feisty auction as one would expec5t at this form of scoring|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: For the USA, NPC Donna Compton has chosen David Berkowitz & Alan Sontag, Bob Hamman & Zia Mahmood, Bobby Levin & Steve Weinstein, Jill Levin & Jill Meyers, Jeff Meckstroth & Eric ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||
nt|jcwla: The competition includes Pairs, Teams and an Individual. All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this should be axed|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  well over the top|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: Of course Rodwell isn't overjoyed at bidding 3@S but he doesn't have much option.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcwla: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D is constructive|pg||
nt|jcwla: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
nt|jcwla: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared.  Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: note South's response on a 1-count |pg||
nt|jcwla: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, we will have the Individual. Each player has drawn a player from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared. Each player partners each of the other eleven ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: players on their team for a short set (6 boards) against various partnerships from the other team.  Each team has agreed on a standard convention card for this event.|pg||
nt|sybarra: need your guessing shoes on in either contract however |pg||
nt|mrdct: now the challenge is to hold this to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1@H and 3@C to lose here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: usually partner will X in response to P|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay very well for n/s    can make 4@S as well |pg||
nt|roswolf: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcwla: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|jcwla: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: but they do have to cash the first 4 :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not that you can find it but a @C lead beats 3NT|pg||

nt|athene: one down is easy (@DAK, @HA, east's trump trick, with a ruff or not)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|psridhar: this may go all the way to 6s, a faulty contract !|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N the likely destination here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrt2000: not a great start for Mexwell|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i think that was wrong the undoubled undertricks may not compensate for the n/s partscore|pg||
nt|roswolf: even -3 might lose the board to -170|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mrdct: meck has a good look at dummy's stiff @CK|pg||
nt|ady: should get an e nd play for down 3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: Hello Drew and Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|drewsky: Good Morning, Bridge World :)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: oops|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|andyv:  just a matter of how many overtricks here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: much discussion on system|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry, a bit ahead of myself !|pg||
nt|athene: and two down will be pretty much impossible i would imagine|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C certainly wasn't a routine action so this might be a swing for europe|pg||

nt|psridhar: E finds out one key and trump queen missing-can now stop in 5s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello PS and George|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: Rodwell thinking|pg||
nt|mrt2000: abot the postion of the @HA I expect|pg||
nt|mrt2000: @DA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|daman: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably 2 off|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psridhar: 5s shd make if trumps are played properly|pg||
nt|daman: it cannot cost him to play a trump to the 9|pg||
nt|psridhar: helgemo/helness managed to beat it though !|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|othered1: And 1N was making, likely with overtricks|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but obvious for West to bid 2@s|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mrdct: good start for europe|pg||
nt|athene: East's discard on the @DK asked for a heart, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer only had the @HK it would be necessary to play a heart through to get the second undertrick|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't want to ruff, of course, as soon as he sees dummy |pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING - BUFFETT CUP - USA  70  EUR  62  ****|pg||
nt|roswolf: these matches are played in 12 bd sets|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrt2000: I wonder how they managed 12 tricks in the other room?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Ah, now corrected|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sJ|nt|yvesj49: strange card|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he knows the entire distribution so severing dummy before end-playing declarer|pg||
nt|yvesj49: they are sleeping ???|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We are stuck I'm afraid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tables crashing in numbers at the moment|pg||
nt|yvesj49: better table crashing than plane lol|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|daman: West will not go down|pg||
nt|ady: yes could be important not to go down 4 which could have been the case on a spade lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: remember The competition includes Pairs, Teams and an Individual. All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: available: a win, a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
nt|ady: Meckstroth can gain entry 3 times including a diamond ruff to play a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: -4 might still be possible|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|drewsky: Do we know who is sitting N-S ?|pg||
mc|9|nt|xenya: we knew a minute ago|pg||
