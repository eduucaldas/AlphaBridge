mb|4S|nt|jcwla: The competing teams, from Europe and the United States, consist of 12 players each and include one Womens pair and five Open pairs.|pg||

nt|roswolf: coincide, as closely as possible, with it. |pg||
nt|jbgood: difficult to avoid the hopeless game?|pg||
nt|flash: i'm not fond of the 1NT opener with 2 suits unstopped, but Helness made the same call|pg||
mb|5H|nt|jcwla: For Europe, NPC Paul Hackett of England has selected Sabine Auken & Daniela von Arnim, Germany, Boye Brogeland & Erik Saelensminde, Geir Helgemo & Tor Helness, Norway, Giorgio ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Duboin & Antonio Sementa, Fulvio Fantoni & Claudio Nunes, Italy, and Jason & Justin Hackett, England.|pg||
nt|mrt2000: expect 4@S now|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: P is forcing followed by 4@S shows a flexible hand|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi Ed|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have 5@C  assuming getting club right|pg||
nt|ady: hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: a feisty auction as one would expec5t at this form of scoring|pg||
nt|flash: the USA has already clinched the Cup, but we've got 3 rounds of 6-board matches still to be seen|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: For the USA, NPC Donna Compton has chosen David Berkowitz & Alan Sontag, Bob Hamman & Zia Mahmood, Bobby Levin & Steve Weinstein, Jill Levin & Jill Meyers, Jeff Meckstroth & Eric ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||
nt|jcwla: The competition includes Pairs, Teams and an Individual. All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
nt|flash: in the Individual, even during the round in which a player draws his/her regular partner, they must use the team convention card|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: for convention cards go to http://www.buffettcup.com/ConventionCards/tabid/151/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|flash: not quite strong enough for X, the @Hs (particularly when the bidding might proceed as it did)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: this should be axed|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  well over the top|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: Of course Rodwell isn't overjoyed at bidding 3@S but he doesn't have much option.|pg||
nt|flash: likely to hear Meckstroth's shrug when he bids 4@S?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Duboin has to find h shift on winning spd ace to beat this, not difficult for him|pg||
nt|flash: on the lie of the cards, this lead doesn't really cost anything|pg||
nt|kaapo: Nice initiative this Buffet Cup. Any idea if it has made into big newspapers to promote bridge?|pg||
nt|flash: 2 Buffett Points available per 6-board match in the Individual; 12 total points available between this round and the last one|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcwla: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D is constructive|pg||
nt|jcwla: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
nt|jcwla: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared.  Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: note South's response on a 1-count |pg||
nt|jcwla: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, we will have the Individual. Each player has drawn a player from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared. Each player partners each of the other eleven ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: players on their team for a short set (6 boards) against various partnerships from the other team.  Each team has agreed on a standard convention card for this event.|pg||
nt|sybarra: need your guessing shoes on in either contract however |pg||
nt|mrdct: now the challenge is to hold this to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1@H and 3@C to lose here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: usually partner will X in response to P|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay very well for n/s    can make 4@S as well |pg||
nt|roswolf: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|roswolf: difficult for north to lead a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: but fortunately south ha another ace|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jcwla: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|jcwla: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: but they do have to cash the first 4 :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not that you can find it but a @C lead beats 3NT|pg||

nt|roswolf: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|athene: one down is easy (@DAK, @HA, east's trump trick, with a ruff or not)|pg||
nt|roswolf: has|pg||
nt|jbgood: NS can make quite a few tricks in @ds, but ... and 3 NT may go lots of downers if defense is found|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and remember it is BAM scoring|pg||
nt|jbgood: still, may be easier to get the odd extra trick in NT than in @s contract|pg||
nt|flash: with the rather surprising location of the @SK, this will make|pg||
nt|flash: style difference leads to different contracts|pg||
nt|flash: here, Jason was willing to rebid 1NT with a singleton Spade|pg||
nt|flash: he'll have to pull the 2nd overtrick out of a hat to tie the board |pg||
nt|flash: (picking up the @D suit seems marked by North's X)|pg||
nt|flash: @SK to see what switch (if any) partner wants?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psridhar: this may go all the way to 6s, a faulty contract !|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N the likely destination here|pg||
nt|jbgood: for example if S plays the ten now...|pg||
nt|flash: (certainly reasonable to expect 4 @Hs in East's hand and no reason why partner need have any)|pg||
nt|flash: same auction as comparison table|pg||
nt|flash: interesting hand - play in NT to try to win the board?  try 7@C??|pg||
nt|flash: no, Bobby - Exclusion in partner's opened and rebid suit not readable...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mrt2000: not a great start for Mexwell|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i think that was wrong the undoubled undertricks may not compensate for the n/s partscore|pg||
nt|roswolf: even -3 might lose the board to -170|pg||
nt|flash: 15-17; xfer; denies 3-card @S spt; GF 2nd suit; conclusion|pg||
nt|psridhar: defense has to set up dia to hold this to 90|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mrdct: meck has a good look at dummy's stiff @CK|pg||
nt|ady: should get an e nd play for down 3|pg||

nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|drewsky: Good Morning, Bridge World :)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: oops|pg||
nt|flash: in the other room, rodwell overcalled 2@H and they sold to 3@D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  just a matter of how many overtricks here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: much discussion on system|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry, a bit ahead of myself !|pg||
nt|athene: and two down will be pretty much impossible i would imagine|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C certainly wasn't a routine action so this might be a swing for europe|pg||

pc|c4|nt|roswolf: ah well the fun begins|pg||
nt|flash: with dummy's @D holding exposed, the defense is a big favorite to take 6 tricks here|pg||
nt|flash: there was no parking place for the losing @D|pg||
pc|cA|nt|flash: Sontag couldn't be sure that @Cs were running, so made a fairly normal duck of the @S|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jbgood: I dont think Broge will try for overtick(s):)|pg||
mc|11|nt|othered1: And 1N was making, likely with overtricks|pg||

nt|psridhar: so first blood to Europe here|pg||
nt|daman: Levin ducked the @D lead|pg||
nt|mrt2000: flat board|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes well done a win for usa on this board|pg||

nt|flash: a good push to start us off|pg||
nt|psridhar: d2 may cost the board |pg||
nt|kaapo: Some catching up to do for Europe, I hear|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dimi: is it a board a match event?|pg||
nt|flash: it's most unusual to see the comparison table running ahead of the table where Sontag is playing...|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: players will be named soon|pg||
nt|jcwla: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|daman: and then lost 2@S tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 14-16|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 3NT now?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this will be interesting - 3NT or 4@s|pg||
nt|flash: as well as the boards were being contested earlier, playing out meaningless boards has led to sloppiness|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: thats difficult to comprehend dia duck|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, one imp as 3N was played by W in OR and @d lead went into the AQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wellcome to Venky|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome even|pg||
nt|athene: if East shows a limit raise in hearts, West won't like his hand that much|pg||
nt|athene: the spades are bad because there are over-ruffs threatened|pg||
nt|roswolf: a classic weak2!?|pg||
nt|flash: welcome (back), all - South this round is scheduled to be Zia...|pg||
mb|d|nt|rmb1: Board-a-match throughout|pg||
nt|drewsky: USA is up quite a bit now...does anyone know how much ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Venky|pg||
nt|rv: Hi all, warm welcome from Bangalore in South India|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: no not a board a match - over 11 boards each pair is competing gainst a specific pair from the other team|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont know who is playing weak NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Fantoni-Nunes, I think |pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is quite funny. On the European CC we see negative doubles through 3@S, on the American through 7@H!|pg||
nt|flash: jump Q is a mixed raise (limit; usually 4 trumps; some defense)|pg||
nt|flash: a dreadful suit to overcall, but certainly a big enough hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jan_jansma: I knew :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks almost easier than 4 @S actually |pg||
nt|ady: think a slip up in the play playing clubs as it turns out|pg||
nt|yvesj49: slam in @h ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: zia went -3 in the same contract in the other room|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2@s west 3@h east ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: possible yves|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: helpful lead|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 660 next hand :)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: IN FRANCE LIKE THIS LOL|pg||
nt|yvesj49: oops sry|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: 28-20 i heard|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Andy, Roland and all specs, 2 great pairs playing here, what more can I a bridge lover ask for:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW playing Fantunes? :)|pg||
nt|flash: the match-ups at our comparison table are Helness - Sementa; Meckstroth - Jill Levin|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: With all that said, hi Mike.  Looks like a very good result for Europe on Board 1.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you need the 1NT in "sandwich" position to be natural against this EW pair. They open and respond very light. |pg||
nt|daman: weak Smolen|pg||
nt|sybarra: at imps you might be in 4 @S |pg||
nt|kaapo: Mayers appears to be sitting at two tables|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Hi Jordan|pg||
nt|mdgraham: On the last board, East may be weak with a long suit. Lebensohl comes in handy (2NT puppets 3@C, then you can bid your long suit). A diretc bid shows reasonable values.|pg||
nt|ady: may be difficult to reach a slam|pg||
nt|flash: Helness chose 1NT - neither action at all likely to find a @D contract...|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Brogeland seq asks for pd to pick a 2 level major nf|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@H can be beaten, so this not so good for Europe|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@H makes from the N hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a gadget strikes|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: the view in trumps will be crucial here|pg||
nt|athene: he might make even losing to both hearts - he certainly will want to finesse trumps to try to keep south from putting a spade through|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but the BAM scoring method makes a significant difference|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if you just need lots of entries to dummy you might play the @DA here, but he would quite like his second diamond trick|pg||
nt|athene: my guess he will go @DK, club to the ace, trump finesse, and then think about things|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: Boye always thinks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: claims would be easier in teams|pg||
nt|roswolf: he could win in hand and lay down the Ace of trumps - and I dont think that is an unreasonable line of play which would hit the jackpot here|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with winning the first trick in hand and playing a club for the trump finesse is you are using up your clubs before you really want to|pg||
nt|athene: for example @DK, club to ace, trump finesse loses, north plays a club straight back at you|pg||
nt|athene: and you have a nasty guess to make|pg||
nt|athene: if you play @DA here and a heart finesse you have a bit more breathing-space with the club suit|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't want to be cut off from the clubs before trumps are drawn|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence might be able to do that by attacking clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed bill but that is why laying down the ace is not reasonable|pg||
nt|roswolf: not unreasonable i meant!!|pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes but you really, really don't want to lose a trump to south|pg||
nt|athene: and have spade through and immediately lose @SAQ with a possible overruff on a third spade|pg||
nt|athene: i think you have to take lots of trump finesses through south|pg||
nt|roswolf: true that is why declarer's thinking|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm vive la difference!|pg||
nt|jbgood: best game and righthanded too|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes individuals are all about practical bidding|pg||
nt|flash: notice the immediate raise - even without the 4th trump, starting with 1@S, intending to support @Hs later would give a distorted picture of the hand|pg||
nt|flash: the defense surrendered an overtrick next door, so first blood to Europe|pg||
nt|kaapo: Fantoni might open 1@C playing with his regular partner|pg||
nt|othered1: south too good for a reopening overcall.  Direct he likely would start with 11S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: @C tap right away|pg||
nt|psridhar: sharp competition fro NS even though they r vul|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrt2000: indeed so, but not from S!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unlikely to go down even from S...  J from Jx seems an unlikely choice|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@S isn't a bad spot on the auction|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: a fair shot by geir|pg||
nt|psridhar: slam appears one out 2 finesses , shd make here|pg||
nt|flash: Board 1 was an interesting bidding problem for E-W; slam was 50%, but quite hard to judge|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: So West wasn't flying solo when he bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|psridhar: that attacking lead will tap decl trumps, but decl may not mind scoring his little trumps in a dummy reversal manner|pg||
nt|daman: West has to get the @Ss moving|pg||
nt|jbgood: not giwing away 2 heart tricks may be good for Europe|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|flash: Hamman leaves Sontag room, but 10 tricks available on @C position (which is immediately exposed)|pg||
nt|flash: Fantoni's first call seems to have decided this board|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bigtrain: always 11 tricks available in @S...  @C lead holds 3N to 10|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good road to slam|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam never really in the picture|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 50%|pg||
pc|h4|nt|odysseus69: looks like 8 tricks i|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, S passed the 1@S opening and EW ended in 3@C.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: it seems duboin quite pessimist|pg||
nt|psridhar: if he guesses the layout he can make 10 tricks for 170|pg||
nt|flash: i fear we're in what's called 'garbage time' in basketball...   the outcome's been decided, so the play gets quite sloppy|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: so the "secret" so far is lead clubs agst. nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt many would lead clubs from Jxxx|pg||
nt|roswolf: a little worse i think and at BAM scoring not a good propostion - unless it makes of course!:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bigtrain: better lead than from Axxx imo|pg||
nt|flash: 6@S reached in the other room on Board 13; played safe for 12; point to Europe|pg||
nt|flash: not enough dummy entries to do everything - needs to lead a trump and a @D from dummy at the same time|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: poor quality trumps|pg||
pc|d3|nt|flash: down 2 likely|pg||
nt|psridhar: can Meyers find tht cl shift? :)|pg||
nt|flash: the @D suit got lost|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bigtrain: tempo seems to dictate a @C lead is best|pg||
nt|psridhar: Ed any comment on why Justin prefered 3h to 2s X ?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 6NT seemed quite ambitious. This seems much better|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|xenya: 2-2 @D and @CK in the S hand allow 11 tricks it seems|pg||
nt|flash: given our late start, our operator will fill in the correct names and the score for Board 1 as we go|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|daman: this way looks OK as well|pg||
nt|mrt2000: really, I think it's likely to be the best attack at trick 1|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but east didn't bid 4@d a good new with bare ace|pg||

pc|sK|nt|flash: the @H return seems a bit wooden; that's a 2-trick difference...|pg||
nt|flash: it turns out that this ruff is with a natural trump trick, but this is certainly a reasonable defense|pg||
nt|flash: in the comparison room, the auction went much slower, so West could conveniently show his @Ds|pg||
pc|s3|nt|flash: without that lead, the only road to 10 tricks would be to start with the @CJ - not at the top of everyone's list...|pg||
nt|flash: do we have a result for Board 1?|pg||
nt|flash: thnx  :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|flash: the defense seems to have gone astray|pg||

nt|flash: or all the @Ds pitched on the good Clubs|pg||
mb|1D|nt|daman: at trick 2|pg||
nt|psridhar: but EW bid well with E bidding only 1nt on a goodish 18|pg||
nt|lml: hi :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 14-16|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 15,  Hamman and Zia in 5 @D |pg||
nt|ady: game in either major for n/s|pg||
nt|flash: board 7 result in - an easy win for Europe|pg||
nt|flash: despite the outcome, that was a reasoned play; now, to make up for that, Levin takes the @S hook |pg||
nt|flash: and ends down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: possible auction here -  3NT-6@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, same start to the auction, but Brogeland did not move over N's 1NT, so a win to USA there.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D = 2+ 10-15 or so... many shapes possible|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i don't know, i've seen plenty of meck's actions that require explanation  :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|daman: goodish is a new word to me|pg||

nt|yvesj49: 1@s forcing|pg||
mb|2S|nt|flash: that's usually best left between him and his analyst?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mrdct: NS can make 4@c i think|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Rodwell will like this 3@C bid :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: it was a close call for Justin...|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt is a zia like effort|pg||
nt|flash: notice the 1@D opener with 4-4 in the minors and a singleton in a Major|pg||
mb|4S|nt|odysseus69: sure to make 6D - but can they get there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has a huge hand now after the 3@D jump |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and not bid grand|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i saw it yesterday lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm north would want to pass methinks|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: this seems to be par contract|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 4,5@C?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: no 1@s is forcing|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6c on one out of 2 finesses in majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: this one appears to be flat also|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 9 or 10 tricks, I excpect|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but i would still want to pass!|pg||
nt|roswolf: and a probable winning one|pg||
nt|flash: in the other room, the board was claimed after about 5 tricks...|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jbgood: even though Zia is West... 2 NT may just roll home |pg||
nt|flash: Rodwell judges his hand to be just shy of a 4@D call (Leaping Michaels), showing a strong 2-suiter in @Ss and @Ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@S likely a fragment-style bid, as South did not bid 1@S over 1@H |pg||
nt|daman: Some pairs play DOPI for controls over opposition to their 2@C opening|pg||
nt|daman: he might get squeezed if he doesn't take his 2@Hs|pg||
nt|daman: but there is the issue of transportation|pg||
nt|daman: and N can hold the @Ss|pg||
nt|psridhar: decl has 10 top tricks and will need to play h to get his 11th|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: very well done by NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: I always have problems finding my .5 card |pg||
nt|mrdct: optimal spot for NS|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i leant the method this night lol|pg||
nt|flash: a bit surprised at the 2@S call - a limit raise with 3 trumps certainly possible|pg||
nt|othered1: American style is to rebid 2@C on good hands with north's shape, 2@H, with lesser h ands.|pg||
nt|flash: if you open 1@D on these hands, you end up distorting your auction one way or another|pg||
mb|5D|nt|rmb1: 3@S is just showing a stop (of sorts) for 3NT,  Does not know North is making slam tries.|pg||
nt|daman: if East had AK10 of @S there would be a shot  |pg||
nt|roswolf: run the club jack and bobs your uncle|pg||
nt|jbgood: or take the di finesse - that is also a winning loser:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|flash: 4 trump tricks and the @HA?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: now decl is a tempo behind -likely only 430|pg||
nt|yvesj49: agressive lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: learnt*|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   likely to fail     4@S has a better play|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2@d probably raise in spades|pg||
nt|flash: 3@S shortness; 4@S cue bid|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES **** BUFFETT CUP **** USA  92 EUR 76 ****   (First to 100 Wins)|pg||
nt|flash: X shows 3-card @S support|pg||
nt|flash: Zia settles for the known 8-card fit, which turns out to be 9...|pg||
nt|flash: Sontag suggests a minor-suit contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: inpite of big @c fit, @hQ is offside and 9 tricks are limit here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is now about the play|pg||
nt|psridhar: cards are not lying well for NS -Sontag's game try over 2H, if he had tried, wd nott hv been a success|pg||
nt|flash: at the comparison table, Hamma bid 3@D where Saelesminde bid 2@D|pg||
nt|flash: Rodwell makes a forcing pass, with his void in Hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no 1@S overcall - mildly surprising|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5@C is not a bad contract (it is with the @CK ofside:))|pg||
nt|ady: need to avoid the heart finesse     likely to go down |pg||
nt|flash: with Sontag at the table, we'll tend to be ahead of the comparison table|pg||
nt|flash: in 3NT in other room|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psridhar: cl are 5-0|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Interesting now|pg||
nt|jbgood: Helness' 3 spades in the OR more difficult to cope with than the more conservative 2 @s here|pg||
nt|kaapo: East does not have a good bid over 2@C without an agreement|pg||
nt|flash: at the other table, E-W were briefly in 3NT, but Jill Levin (E) pulled that to 4@D; @S lead, so 150 still available|pg||
nt|flash: this forced Helness to guess and he chose 3@S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|odysseus69: few undos to correct|pg||
nt|lml: what is the max tricks possible?|pg||
nt|flash: the fate of 3@S isn't clear, given the 4-1 split|pg||
nt|othered1: This wouldn't be the worst game ever seen, but the lead makes north happy he's not overboard.|pg||
nt|psridhar: quite well judged by Sontag poised for 110 now|pg||
nt|othered1: And a conservative approach is typical in board-a-match scoring|pg||
nt|flash: so no push on this one|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: does now....|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Teams, Pairs and Individual events in Wareen Buffet Cup, every event is scored on BAM style, so OTs and UTs are very important|pg||
nt|rv: German ladies have competed to 3@s in OR which is only 1 down|pg||
nt|flash: Sontag judges well|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kaapo: Will he find @SQ? Perhaps he will, because West might bid 1NT holding it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: i think he can make 11 now|pg||
nt|lml: 5 i think after that good guess|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a @D and a @S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if Brogeland can duck clubs twice Meckstroth has to guess right|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yvesj49: one off|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks -1 but likely to be in game at the other table|pg||
nt|yvesj49: heart switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: yes 2d alerted as raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty terry|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|odysseus69: club lead still not good enough|pg||
nt|rmb1: In a less confident partnership, South would have let North play in hearts by now :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not content with 6@D at pairs. But a club lead may be interesting  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to make after the take out double|pg||
nt|odysseus69: west will be thrown in to concede 2 spade tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess there is a strip squeeze on a club lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
nt|flash: this would have made only 10 tricks - @S finesse works, but nowhere to park the 3rd round of @Ss|pg||
nt|flash: 2@D was a limit raise or better in @Ds (10+ HCP with 5-card spt; 11+ with 4-card spt)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|odysseus69: also could duck and squeeze as long as he reads distribution-not a problem either way |pg||
nt|xenya: now he has to get @H right as well|pg||
nt|rv: much needed board for Europeans |pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: the t/o double places virtually all the high cards - just room for East to hold @SJ perhaps|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Sabine Auken needs to play a @D now|pg||
nt|flash: but Fantoni has won the board with his 6@H call - this will only be down 3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: for 11|pg||
nt|flash: however, this shift has opened up the possibility of an overtrick|pg||
nt|flash: Helness went down in 4@H on Board 20; tie match|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rmb1: Doesn't duck and squeeze require West to have @SJ, which is only card he might not have|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no - spade jack not relevant|pg||
nt|kaapo: Berkowitz shows both majors via Michaels cue bid and with a huge playing strength of course bids game|pg||
nt|psridhar: Berko possibly evaluated his hand as Michaels cue in upper range, seeing that raise to game on 2h pref |pg||
nt|kaapo: EW might have competed in diamonds|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: although West may reduce to a singleton K in spades - but North will get it right  |pg||
nt|rmb1: The plan is for south to have SQx and winning diamond, and North to have SAx and C10.  |pg||
nt|dimi: Nunes has to hold @c K and @s K, so there is no chance to escape the squeeze|pg||
nt|odysseus69: N/S areboth Jill- North Jill Levin -now corrected-wife of Bobby Levin|pg||
nt|lml: yes it may be quite tempting to play hearts the wrong way|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** BUFFETT CUP IN RUNNING Currently USA 50  EUR 46  ****|pg||
nt|flash: 10 tricks most likely outcome here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rmb1: When South cashes the diamond, either the C10 or SQ will become a winner|pg||

nt|odysseus69: wel judged 6NT bid|pg||
nt|rv: each Pairs match in a round is worth 4 Buffet points, so at the end of this match if Europe has more BAM points they get 4 Buffet points and US viceversa|pg||
nt|mrdct: +150 should score well for USa|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: If EW play Attitude, West needed to discourage in @H there|pg||
nt|roswolf: please ignore the imp score scoring is BAM|pg||
nt|roswolf: REHI everyone|pg||
nt|ady: re|pg||
nt|ady: already the club lead to the ace has helped declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: have missed play here will give score at end|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: system crashed|pg||
nt|ady: seems we are back to the beginning|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok terry thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: i think SQ was switched |pg||
nt|ady: with spades 3-3  and declarers clubs set up  defence has to take care to make A@H|pg||
nt|ady: vital in this form of scoring|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment david|pg||
nt|flash: board 2 a push|pg||
nt|flash: same contract; same lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well done |pg||
nt|flash: natural lead of the @CT, so little chance of beating 3@S|pg||
nt|flash: board 14 a push|pg||
nt|flash: Brogeland can actually make the same 11 tricks in Spades as Sontag might have made in Clubs|pg||
nt|flash: but he only needs to take 9 to win the board|pg||
nt|flash: BAM at its finest - 4@C doesn't score as much as 3@S...   2 - 0 USA|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrg: 12-14|pg||
nt|flash: the situation in the other room is why Smith Echo was invented...|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: That likely will buy it|pg||
mb|1C|nt|psridhar: 2c=trf +ve ( dia)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i expect EW will buy this in 3@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: multi,  looks like a good one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.buffettcup.com/Home/tabid/53/language/en-GB/Default.aspx  is the website for the competition. Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: cards for the Individual and other information|pg||
nt|stigw: Hi all, I*ve been allowed as commentator at this table. Maybe I need some help regarding Meckwell's system, I'm afraid.|pg||
nt|flash: weak 2-bid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yvesj49: probably 3NT bye east|pg||
nt|flash: Berkowitz found the duck in the @S suit (albeit in a slightly different position)|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: looks like Fantoni-Nunes are playing their own system|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no response on a 2-count at this vulnerability!|pg||
nt|kaapo: NS should be careful not to get too high here, though I suppose they'll stop at 4@S or 3NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: this bd looks flat in 4h making 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 1@C is 14+ with clubs or 15+ BAL, F|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 9 tricks in hearts and a struggle for 9 in spades -|pg||
nt|xenya: was well defended by N -- that @C shift|pg||
nt|rv: Buffet points format is analogous to a set in tennis, 7-6 is worth same as 6-0|pg||
nt|mrt2000: anybody fancy 6@H?|pg||
nt|ady: e/w will get to 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: matches in the teams are of 14 bds|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this looks a push but this is certainly not a gimmee in an individual|pg||
nt|flash: and takes 10 tricks to win the board|pg||
nt|flash: was that 11 or 12 tricks, Trevor?  in the position we saw, Sontag had a sure 12|pg||
mb|2H|nt|drewsky: Many partnerships play that 4 of a aminor here by west is NOT a slam try.....|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@h a clever bid putting the presure on north|pg||
nt|mrdct: west happy to defend now|pg||
nt|flash: (that uses an echo in the suit declarer first attacks to indicate how much you like the suit led)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Sontag wanted to bid but I suspect that 2 natural clubs not on the menu|pg||
nt|flash: (so, if Levin were able to conventionally stand up on his chair and scream "my suit's ready to run", E-W would have gotten all their tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: don't be afraid alfred lol|pg||
nt|flash: Sontag has an immense hand opposite the X|pg||
nt|flash: trumps not strong enough (and no shortness), so Sontag pulls to 3@C|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bigtrain: don't worry about that... i can handle things there|pg||
nt|othered1: This won't be exciting in play|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably forcing lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: this shd be a flat bd losing just the 2 aces for 650|pg||
nt|psridhar: in 4S on h lead, decl will be put to a dilemma on dia shift ( on winning spd King) from W-whether to finesse or not at BAM|pg||
nt|psridhar: no such probleems in 3nt :)|pg||
nt|flash: 2@H fourth suit forcing - creates a game force; as we can see, doesn't say anything about East's holding in the suit|pg||
nt|kaapo: Saelesminde's bidding 1NT would've made the bidding simpler|pg||
nt|flash: 3@D is forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 6@H is not a bad contract but it won't make with the club offside|pg||
nt|mrdct: but will +100 be enough for europe to win the board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We have the big train here to tell us about the Meckwell system|pg||
nt|roswolf: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|jbgood: doesnt really matter whether he plays 2 or 3 - if he doesnt get 9, he loses the board, if he gets 10, he wins it|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the play is the thing|pg||
nt|psridhar: assuming NS wont venture 5c in other room |pg||
nt|flash: 3@S pre-emptive; other ways to raise to show stronger hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: as is the modern style aggressive bidding all round|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@H is a transfer 0-11 4 @S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 1@h shows spades. Good here for double  to be take-out of the shown suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3nt wont play well on a h lead; 5c has chances|pg||
nt|diumraid: Current in running scores for the Buffett Cup USA 28 EUR 20. To win a continent needs to obtain 100 points. We are in Ruuning in Round 4 of 5 today.|pg||
nt|drewsky: simply a prepared bid in case the enemy calls 4@S, |pg||
nt|andyv:  at least S will find a couple of useful Jacks in N's hand|pg||
nt|rv: each round in Teams and Pairs are worth 4 Buffet points, in Individual event 2 Buffet Points, total of 198 Buffet points at stake over 4 days|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @S to the 9 looks normal, but fatal here|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|ady: probable club lead  |pg||
nt|ady: onviously 2NT forcing|pg||
nt|yvesj49: easy on @c lead|pg||
nt|flash: all 13 available (but certainly not expected)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to John Carruthers|pg||
nt|jgc: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4s save was 300, but EW may press on to 5H-perhaps 5s for 500 is par|pg||
nt|flash: Helness - Auken have been pushed to 6@D on 21|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bigtrain: down 2 is a live possibility|pg||
nt|mrdct: true|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh, there he is, hello Walter|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes friendly beak in @S|pg||
nt|yvesj49: at least 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 2h showed extra|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|flash: Weinstein a bit worried about Sontag's length in @Cs, but would probably have seen a 2NT call (scrambling) if he didn't have 5|pg||
nt|flash: shows 5 @Ds and a 4-card Major|pg||
nt|flash: headed down 2 here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: this is how the event is being played      http://www.buffettcup.com/EventDetails/tabid/70/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|roswolf: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|flash: hi, John - action's fast and furious - not the usual pace for this form of scoring  :)|pg||
nt|flash: Hamman - Weinstein found a good defense against Helness' 3@S, but he's still on track for 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rv: whichever team gets 100 Buffet Points first wins this edition of Warren Buffet Cup|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: only @SA and !x will let him get out for down 1. Unlikely...|pg||
nt|flash: correct, Victor - Landy is the flavor of the day for USA (2@C shows Majors; rest natural)|pg||
nt|flash: @S shift to hold this to 4|pg||
nt|flash: 11 tricks is a lot...   apparently only 10 on this lead|pg||
nt|othered1: West had a nasty hand to rebid over the negative double.  Short suit or short stopper seems the choice he had|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West now has the option of playing North for @s109 doubleton|pg||
nt|stigw: It semmes - the system I mean - to function for them, but I wouldnt dare to try to copy them !|pg||
nt|roswolf: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: jeff is thinking about the play of the Q@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: the current score is USA 60 EUROPE 48|pg||
nt|yvesj49: in teams it's probably the only chance to beat|pg||
nt|ady: have to be carefull not to let 11 tricks through   not taking A@H|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: i bet he is thinking on how to minimise declarer's tricks - i think he will go passive|pg||
nt|roswolf: remember this is BAM scoring|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure by team it's different|pg||
nt|flash: Hampson also led a small @C, so the issue will be the pitches on the run of the @ds|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kaapo: Two first scores were duplicated in the open room. Board 9 has some room for variance|pg||
nt|flash: Sontag finds a safe lead - 11 tricks possible if Saelesminde leads a small Spade from dummy at trick 2|pg||
nt|flash: Rodwell working out whether anything can be gained/lost if he ducks this|pg||
nt|flash: now, he can be held to 9 tricks (with a @C continuation)|pg||
nt|flash: same contract at the comparison table|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe east, with flat hand and @S stops might have considered a NT track|pg||
nt|flash: Helness has mis-timed the play in 6@D, so USA will be up 3-0 (unless something very strange happens)|pg||
nt|othered1: Al Roth, who developed the negative double, used to warn against negative doubles on 4-3-3-3- hands.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|odysseus69: cant understand Fantoni double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: surprised East didn't rebid 2@s with four-card support|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. However, the scoreboard is americanized for obvious reasons, so we ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: must live with 1-½-0 on the scoreboard. I am sure you can figure it out reghardless|pg||
nt|daman: scores as the come in     http://www.buffettcup.com/RunningScores2010/tabid/155/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|psridhar: Brogeland has tthiss beat in his hand-though he doesnt know it yet|pg||
nt|daman: @D lead is best|pg||
nt|flash: USA +2 in Match B; Match C tied|pg||
nt|flash: well done|pg||
nt|flash: (else declarer would have had time to set up the @Ds for a @S pitch)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jan_jansma: But thast is for us, mortals|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|flash: but that looks anti-percentage, so we're more likely to see 10|pg||
nt|flash: same lead  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: only 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|flash: now Jason has to switch to a @H|pg||
nt|flash: the @C9 seems an 'interesting' choice of a spot to return|pg||
nt|flash: there's some concern being raised in the comparison room about how seriously the match is being taken, now that USA has clinched the Cup|pg||
nt|flash: they've finished this round at the comparison table|pg||
nt|flash: i'd guess there's some possibility of play being stopped after this round; if the approach of some of the players becomes speeding through the boards just to get it over|pg||
nt|flash: the competition loses all purpose|pg||
nt|flash: in case that does happen, let me throw in...|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to the organizing committee for inviting many of the world's greatest players to participate and for staging a great show|pg||
nt|flash: thnx - became irrelevant  :)|pg||
nt|flash: Sontag needs to go up Ace here to hold this to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|flash: so the USA clinches at least a tie in this match|pg||
mc|9|nt|daman: I take that back |pg||
nt|daman: must be my green tea|pg||
nt|psridhar: Rodwell will scramble 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|othered1: NS have a -200 save in @D, b ut it's not clear how to get in at these colors |pg||
nt|psridhar: Helness made a trick more but was in a cont 2 tricks higher on bd 3|pg||

nt|psridhar: after a strong 1c, Rodwell made 2 bids- 3c could noot hv showed dia void, was it 4nt?|pg||
nt|daman: 4NT is not chopped liver in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: although Levin lead a @S|pg||
nt|daman: if he led the @H J   that would have been useful|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1,2 or 3@H with south?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1|pg||
nt|athene: OK so he laid down the @HA - that worked out well|pg||
nt|flash: board 3 also in as a push|pg||
nt|flash: we'll see if Zia can collect at least one more trick...|pg||
nt|kaapo: USA on their way to slam on 15|pg||
nt|flash: the operator at the comparison table seems to be having a lot of problems|pg||
nt|flash: Europe +1 in B; USA +1 in C|pg||
nt|flash: next-to-last hand...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kaapo: This makes it easier. Sontag was quite maximum for his 2NT, so more difficult for defence to know what to do|pg||
nt|flash: let me get a head start on...   a well-deserved round of applause for the organizing committee|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 4 spades easy make and 5D a good save|pg||
nt|dimi: good def in 5@d for EW|pg||
nt|bigtrain: me to|pg||
nt|bigtrain: too|pg||
nt|flash: that (lack of an) overtrick may be costly|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bigtrain: XX shows 4+@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What was the score on 16 in this room, anyone know?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Where Helness did not finesse hearts in 6@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: However, 6@S here does not have many problems|pg||
nt|flash: we simply don't believe that the Board 4 auction could have been 1@C - 1@D - 1NT  passed out|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this could get high very quickly|pg||
nt|mrdct: too much outside to preempt|pg||
nt|flash: the Norwegians are in 3NT on 22, so, again, no push board|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: 4@H looks normal here but maybe by way of stayman|pg||
nt|bigtrain: neb diamond shows 2+@D 10-15 many shapes possible|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@C a sound @H raise|pg||
nt|psridhar: That take out X is aggressive facing a passed pd and only 3 spds and slender values|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: and went 1 down in the open room|pg||
nt|yvesj49: we didn't see this board roland|pg||
nt|athene: wow, that's some pass from east, assuming the double is normal penalties|pg||
nt|athene: this was really the auction? or you are just putting in the final contract?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think we're just catching up|pg||
nt|athene: yes, right, that seems more likely|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi everyone|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps it went something like 2@S - 2NT - 3@S - double - all pass|pg||
nt|flash: as usual, with Sontag at the table, we're well ahead of the comparison table|pg||
nt|psridhar: this will be a quick 4s making 420 for ns|pg||
nt|kaapo: Easy 4@S to play|pg||
nt|kaapo: Is it as easy to bid?|pg||
nt|flash: 2NT is Jacoby - typically a balanced GF raise with 4 trumps|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mrdct: and opening values anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ok|pg||
nt|stigw: 3 cl down 2 I imagine.|pg||
nt|stigw: Sorry, that was board 15 - a very unlucky start for Hellnes.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: NS very agressive.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 3n just on last sementa apol|pg||
nt|athene: then everyone would be sort of sane|pg||
nt|flash: you saw it here, folks!!!   Sontag opened 1@C and it wasn't strong, artificial and forcing!!!|pg||
nt|flash: Levin worth a try?  or will just bid it??|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: arguably the weakest pair in the field, Hackett twins have lost all 5 of their matches yesterday|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure of problem on bd 15 |pg||
nt|kaapo: I guess many Norths will open 1NT|pg||
nt|flash: Sementa has led a @H against 6NT, so the match will be all square|pg||
nt|flash: no, this isn't Rodwell opening 1@D nebulous...   if he opens 1@C, there are too many responses which would leave him rebidding 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: unless NS lose their diamond fit, which has indeed happened |pg||
nt|daman: they are going down more than 1 in 4NT|pg||
nt|drewsky: stayman, then smolen, the delayed jacoby.....thats the way I like to play it|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a soft lead and declarer should make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|flash: (and the result at this table irrelevant)|pg||
nt|psridhar: after that preempt impossible to find 3S (par for EW )-if justin had balanced 3s , Duboin wd hv raised it|pg||
nt|flash: their efforts to get many of the top players in the world to participate here are much appreciated|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: should get to 4@s now|pg||
nt|ady: clubs well placed|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 2nd diamond and a club from dummy|pg||
nt|flash: 2/1 by passed hand not forcing|pg||
nt|kaapo: Auken chooses to make the take out double once she's given a chance so low|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES BUFFETT CUP **** USA  94 EUR 80 ****   |pg||
nt|flash: XX to show 3-card @H spt|pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: great win for USA|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3 emabrassing overtricks for E|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H is not quite clear to me |pg||
nt|othered1: East  has a lot of cards for the auction up to him.  Not unusual when two pairs use light initial action approaches|pg||
nt|yvesj49: justin will make|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w may well bid the game now|pg||
nt|psridhar: in practise this shd go down 1|pg||
nt|othered1: GIB would make this, but GIB peeks.|pg||
nt|flash: neither North nor South can give full value to his @D holding...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jan_jansma: well bid|pg||
nt|flash: but that's an extreme position by Sementa|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yvesj49: club now|pg||
nt|yvesj49: and with 10/9 alone|pg||
nt|kaapo: An extra pass here?|pg||
nt|flash: now Sontag gets to show his @H control (and his 2nd round control in @Cs) - that may be enough|pg||
nt|kaapo: Suppose it was Zia bidding 5@C|pg||
nt|flash: yes - that looks far more likely|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|psridhar: many pairs play 1c-2h/2s to show major 2 suitor in a limited range-not Saelensmin|pg||
nt|daman: they must play standard count in this situation|pg||
nt|rv: sorry they lost 4 out of 5 matches|pg||
nt|bigtrain: don't think they have any play at 10 tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: valuing spade q and so no splinter|pg||
nt|flash: 2@C limit +; 2@D stopper; 2@H stopper; 2NT @S stopper...|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: no discussion|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to the many volunteers it takes to run a show like this|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rv: 10 tricks are possible here|pg||
nt|rv: sorry @c ruff should restrict declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: thanks to all kibitzers for helping me and other commentators when we make mistakes:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: R deep in thought|pg||
nt|rv: another surprising stat from Day 1, Fantunes have also lost 4 matches on Day 1|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if east thought of redoubling, if it would have shown power?  And would NS have sat it out?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well after 3@D - CANTY TYPE QUICK ENOUGH:(|pg||
nt|flash: wonder if Europe has a Drury call available|pg||
nt|flash: good point, Victor - splintering with a singleton K or Q can distort partner's evaluation|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to the sponsors - without their generous participation, we wouldn't have a show at all|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rv: they are too good a pair and I expect them to bounce back today|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 15 poss fouled board in OR?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: lets ask GIB :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event|pg||
nt|flash: 2NT usually an inquiry as to the nature of the raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: auction correct|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or perhaps West wanted to drive to 5@H but tried to direct the lead on the way|pg||
nt|flash: thnx, Trevor|pg||
nt|flash: the cards certainly lie badly for any N-S contract|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mrdct: can't ruff @c losers and control trumps|pg||
nt|stigw: I guess he might make it now, but no sure thing, even if the start was promising.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: only 6 tricks available for NS|pg||
nt|bigtrain: overtricks are possible for e/w|pg||
nt|stigw: Meck is best to duck here, but not obvious by any means.|pg||
nt|othered1: agree on overtrice|pg||
