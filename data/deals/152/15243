nt|daman: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: oops afternoon|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Rashed welcome |pg||
nt|sybarra: I think in the Indi's they all play same cc |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: I am afraid that I do not know who is matched but hopefully all will be revealed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks, Shirley.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3rd Buffet Bridge Cup, Miskin, Wales http://www.buffettcup.com/Home/tabid/53/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|haans: Wednesday starting with USD leading 60-48 Buffett Points 100 Buffett Points to win|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|pef: we're about to start the last individual match of the day, where members of each team pair up with a new partner each match|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Rashed|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Rashed :)|pg||
nt|haans: Sucken have no good bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yesterday, we saw Sabine lead the @ST from KTx of dummy's bid @S suit which held QJ-sixth.  Daniela won the A and returned a low one and declarer understandably pitched a side ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: loser, losing to Sabine's K and could only comment, "That was sexy."|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mamos: just us talking to ourselves :)|pg||
nt|haans: Aucken|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Cornelia and Haans.|pg||
nt|pef: this is 6 boards, board-a-match, winner take all|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: Jill is checking convention card ....|pg||
nt|pef: test|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: so is Fred|pg||
nt|pef: gitelman and levin's partners in this match are Bob Hamman and Bobby Levin|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what a hand, 4@H EW as the cards are placed and good save in minors for NS.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: they have landed right|pg||
nt|chick: nice choice by Auken ... with N showing 4 hearts, she chooses to show the diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: von Arnom knows only 40 hcp exist but ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Tricky hand and difficult for W to pass 2@D.|pg||
nt|haans: Arnim|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: simple clubs raise?|pg||
nt|haans: pass a good option|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|chick: N has pretty much described his hand, except for about an A worth of value, but with his partner passing 2@D, I don't think he has much left to say|pg||
nt|sybarra: bjr yves |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: This is Board-A-Match (BAM or Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, may  decides the ...|pg||
nt|haans: board. |pg||
nt|haans: 3@H passable|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3 hearts is plenty here|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|haans: Hi Victor|pg||
nt|haans: all cards wrong :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if defence is accurate then 3 down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: +3|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: not a lot of specs .. i think I have enough biscuits to go around everyone, in fact|pg||
nt|spooky: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi shirley|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|odysseus69: Hi Hans|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: just a @S p/s for NS?   East took one too many bids|pg||
nt|mamos: yep looks like -300|pg||
nt|daman: difficult to understand whay he would bid 4@C|pg||
nt|daman: siff @S and Qxx of @D is better|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: yep|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|spooky: 3NT looks like making, only a @C lead from south would set it.|pg||
nt|daman: t*|pg||
nt|yvesj49: nice event|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwi_joker: well you cant really find yourself in a room where 'dud' players are in action ... as this event features 24 of the world's very best|pg||
nt|mamos: are we linked to the correct table ?|pg||
nt|mamos: i thought the twins were always scoring agianst Levin and Weinstein|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: other room looks to have started with a precision 2@C, and someohow they couldnt put the brakes on before reaching a hopelessly optimistic 6C|pg||
nt|spooky: but Brogeland took his "safe"plus scoe in 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: but non vulnerable :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bridge a funny game - Jx of @H's part of the thinking to go back to 2@S but @HJ turns out to be highly useful card.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Indeed eliminates a @D loser, as it is.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yvesj49: where we can see the best world's players|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|spooky: 5@D bid and made at the other table, so first board goes to USA|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING RESULTS **** BUFFETT CUP ****  USA 48   EUR  36  ***** (First to 100 wins) *****|pg||
nt|rv: Hi specs, warm welcome from sunny Bangalore in South India|pg||

nt|chick: hopefully we'll find out the end result of that board when the operator has time to put it in :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: technical problems - contract is 4S by NS |pg||
nt|haans: If Levin had bid 3@C von Arnim odds to bid 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: new board now|pg||
nt|mamos: just too much from Justin there|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I think so |pg||
nt|jcwla: The N hand playable in three different strains, contains a void, and the @H suit represents a small fraction of its values with nothing on top.  |pg||
nt|yvesj49: ty rashed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes @@@C and @D.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: shirley*|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sry|pg||
nt|henryb:  good day all|pg||
mb|1H|nt|daman: bidding 4@C on that hand is like found money for the opps     getting something for nothing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|Walddk5: East is Justin Hackett|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: this look like a likely 4H game|pg||
mb|2H|nt|haans: 6@C possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They are both   J  Hackett|pg||
mb|d|nt|rv: transfer responses here, 1@h shows 4+@s|pg||
nt|Walddk5: But North is Hampson|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pef: ah, that makes a bit more sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H can be beateb on spade lead|pg||
nt|drewsky: ONLY if played by south|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good bid west|pg||
nt|yvesj49: NS are out of 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: Individual: Each player on Team Europe is drawn to compare with a particular player on Team USA. A player does not meet the player with whom he or she compar|pg||
nt|yvesj49: WITH 25 COUNT|pg||
nt|yvesj49: if i play i don't want to be compared with fantoni lol|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: or 6@H|pg||
nt|mamos: although  Americans are in 4@C x at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Fred is playing in Match A|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Brogeland's 1@s denies 4@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Henry, welcome.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Got it right now|pg||
nt|pef: a rather speculative double from Duboin assuming that's not an anomaly|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: 1@S shows 3@S|pg||
nt|rv: with 4 he would have jumped to 2@s and with 2 would have rebid 1n or 2m|pg||
mb|d|nt|spooky: weird that Brogeland didn't open 1NT, they play 15-17...|pg||
nt|rv: Levin-Weinstein compared with Duboin-Sementa and Brogeland-Saelensmide with Sontag-Berk|pg||
nt|rv: play of @h suit critical for OT in this contract|pg||
nt|ady: Europe should win the board 5@C  at least down 2|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D Bourke = just GF bid|pg||
nt|daman: Berkowicz|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: it's about the overtrick in this lay out|pg||
nt|mamos: the scoring method has led to many NT contracts  as players hunt for the magic +10 points|pg||
nt|daman: easy to figure this 3rd and 5th|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: holy ... 2nt natural?|pg||
nt|chick: looks like just one diamond loser, and perhaps a heart loser|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sound 4@S with @H guess can make 6.|pg||
nt|haans: odds against doing right in hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true. 10 @H very vital card.|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: In every case the four individuals at one table have their corresponding opponent sitting in the same seat at the matching table. |pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Berk made the same bad 4@C bid|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rv: I presume Levin will duck @h to @hK smoothyl|pg||
nt|pef: well 5c would have been a good save|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: Good lead.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rv: smoothly|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|yvesj49: nice organization|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jcwla: Instead of wishing physical harm on your enemy, just wish that Sabine leads to all their contracts.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwi_joker: unless South is very much asleep when declarer plays a heart from dummy later on, this will go -1|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|spooky: this helps declarer|pg||
nt|rv: after South's @H9, Brogeland may just get it right|pg||
nt|rv: ah, easy now for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Pairs, Teams and Individual events in Warren Buffet Cup, all scoring is BAM style|pg||
nt|rv: so OTs and UTs very crucial, this form of scoring is lot tougher than IMPs and a bit tougher than Pairs (MPs)|pg||
nt|rv: if you make 8 tricks in 2@s and your opps make same 8 tricks in NT, you get 0 BAM points|pg||
nt|haans: 54% for this slam|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event. Have a look|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer will have to sniff out Heart position for a good score|pg||
nt|daman: he will sniff it out by default|pg||
nt|daman: he will not risk his contract   and in so doing will drop the @H King|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That would be +2 and good score.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rv: in Pairs (MPs), the field does protect you a bit|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Haans and every one|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: would have been interesting if KH played on 10H|pg||
nt|mamos: Sontag and Berkowicz in 4@H so looks irrelevant how many tricks   he makes here|pg||
nt|pef: I'm not sure why the other table scoring isn't showing up here, but assuming the matching table is  Open room, the europeans won the first board by competing to 4c and going down 1|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Lilek|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hi Lillek|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Victor,sry late:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: In the Individual each set is of just six deals|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: imo the only lead which sets 4@H.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|odysseus69: is there any reason to get hearts wrong?|pg||
nt|pef: interesting point of the hand, it looks like hampson needs to take a diamond finesse now, giving up on the heart finesse|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|rnmalik: N 's hand is counted 5@S+4@D+2@C +2@H|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pef: I guess not, although if east had ducked the heart it would ahve been more interesting|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|daman: 4@H has the same guess as overtricks in 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  unlucky. This way he runs out of trumps|pg||
nt|henryb:  provided North continues spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  He is also unlucky that the player with the fourth spade has the late club entry|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|westjava: 6-3 fit,drop I think|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|daman: he will not fall for this|pg||
nt|jcwla: Richly deserved win for Europe there.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h9|pg||
mc|10|nt|mamos: North has to exit wirth Diamond|pg||
nt|pef: 4H undoubled was made at the other table, so the match should now be tied 1-1|pg||
pg||
qx|c21|st||md|3S652HA874DAQT8C42,SAT73HKQ96DJ7CAK6,SKQJ84HJT5DKCQJ75,S9H32D965432CT983|sv|n|nt|spooky: Brogeland wasn't tested on this board, so a push|pg||
nt|haans: rehi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: The total of Buffett points over four days is 198. When a team reaches 100 points, it has won the Trophy. |pg||
nt|yvesj49: with BAM bareme ?|pg||
nt|jcwla: So this means Sementa with Meyers, Duboin with B. Levin, Hamman with von Arnim, and Rodwell with Nunes?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event. Have a look|pg||
nt|sybarra: If the scores are tied on 99 each, Europe, who won the trophy in Louisville, will retain it. |pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: a wildish hand |pg||
nt|haans: USA in the lead but score is?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: last hand 4S+1|pg||
nt|daman: NS can make a grand slam in 2 suits|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wow, what cards.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Rubber Bridge:)|pg||
nt|daman: West will find a way to gum things up|pg||
nt|daman: my Mom would open the North hand 2@C|pg||
nt|mamos: as well|pg||
nt|mamos: are we stuck?|pg||
nt|daman: the connection is messed up   we will be booted any time now|pg||
nt|daman: my prediction|pg||
nt|mamos: other tables crashed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: safe flight:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I have the pairings here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: x was rather optimistic, x by W of 2@H was instrumental.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kiwi_joker: Whether you bid an immed 3H or 4H on these hands, depends on how much you like 7-4-1-1 shapes|pg||
nt|mamos: with nine tricks the max all round I guess|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I do, so I'm a 4-hearter|pg||
nt|haans: 8 always 9 never|pg||
mb|d|nt|yvesj49: ok it's a sort of revange of the ryder cup lol|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Helness - Sontag; Justin H - Jill L; Helgemo - Berkowitz ; Brogeland - Zia; von Arnim - Hamman; Nunes - Rodwell; Duboin - Bobby L; Sementa - Meyers; Sælensminde - Weinstein; ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Fantoni - Meckstroth; Jason H - Hampson; Auken - Gitelman|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S cam make 5@d on a club guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 24 Buffet Points at stake in this round as well, in first round of Teams, Europe won 16-8|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: interesting pairings |pg||
nt|yvesj49: not the best par score for NS|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W are three or four down in a major suit contract|pg||
nt|pef: levin bid 1nt there intending to make a three card limit raise in spades|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|rv: current running score, 48-36 in favor of US, total of 198 Buffet points at stake over 4 days (till Thr)|pg||
nt|haans: tricky hand South have|pg||
nt|yvesj49: if the defence is perfect, 4 off|pg||
nt|sybarra: might have done better in spades |pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: only 84 decided so far|pg||
nt|spooky: well done by NS, 4@C is making|pg||
nt|Walddk5:  The overall score before this round is USA 85   65 Europe. 100 points wins the cup.|pg||
nt|pef: she faced the problem of penalty doubling 2d or continuing with the limit raise in spades plan.  the former would have been the dinner here, but the vulnerability made it difficult|pg||
nt|pef: 3S also being played at the other table|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: looks like a good decision not to sell out to 3@H   but this won't make|pg||
nt|rv: You can access URL http://www.buffettcup.com/RunningScores2010/tabid/155/language/en-US/Default.aspx for detailed scores|pg||
nt|rv: also access to excellent web-site www.bridgewinners.com for US npc's blog as well as interviews|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I thought 3NT would have been a better contract.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: should be 10 tricks|pg||
nt|yvesj49: oops|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: 4@S make with @DK singel|pg||
nt|yvesj49: J @c better in East at the 1st round|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: NS have a most unfortunate fit, that plays like a dog|pg||
nt|westjava: tourney website http://www.buffettcup.com/Home/tabid/53/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|pef: declarer is sufferening from a severe lack of entries to dummy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: Scoring: American style of  1 points for a win, ½  point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|rv: Teams event will be played today and tomorrow with Individuals on Day 4/last day (Thr)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@H and a @S. Can pitch a @D on A@C.|pg||
nt|jcwla: A "you're not going to  push me around" pass there by Brogeland might have kept them out of the game but Sabine goes on.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|odysseus69: 4 hearts was a good but unmakeable contract- 3D is doomed by 5-0|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: problem for southg|pg||
nt|yvesj49: now 7 tricks|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|mamos: how does your dog play Steve?    mine bids ok  but is hopeless with the dummy|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: you're barking up the wrong tree there, Mike  :-)|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry  I shouldnt have started|pg||
nt|rv: 60 Buffet points for Pairs, 72 Buffet Points for Teams and remaining 56 Buffet Points for Individual event|pg||
nt|odysseus69: best to rise - cash clubs letting N orth pitch spades|pg||
nt|westjava: score after 4 round : USA 60 - Europe 48|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: 1@H-2@H was interesting, may be showing both minors.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yvesj49: 6 sry|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwi_joker: If the players are really playing at this pace on this deal, I have to say I am quite surrpised|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S return now by play of @DA.|pg||
nt|westjava: http://www.buffettcup.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=HO7wOhY96Bw%3d&tabid=155&mid=493&language=en-GB|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or less if fineese @h.......|pg||
nt|sybarra: unfortuately will end in wrong hand in the end |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|rv: sry 66 BPs for Individual for total of 198|pg||
nt|spooky: declarer will even make an overtrick now, by finessing @HQ |pg||
nt|rv: yes well bid by L-W|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Tables are not linked. Operatoir, please shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mamos: just a simple two off at the start and at the finish I guess|pg||
nt|ady: now can make 11|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Then enter scores manually in MOVIE when you are back|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  shows limit or better in @d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok|pg||
nt|henryb:  all pairs are playing a form of 2/1 gf; both Europe and US|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry it was in response to 1@D by S.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Better now than later|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It takes 5 seconds|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ady: south in difficulties   needed to discard another spade    not easy|pg||
nt|Walddk5: This is quite funny. On the European CC we see negative doubles through 3@S, on the American through 7@H!|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|henryb:  He has a strong clue that East has three clubs, West two: West overcalled 1H which suggests not 5-5 in the majors, and East raised hearts, which suggests 3 card support.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|yvesj49: lolllll roland|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|odysseus69: looks like only 1 down now|pg||
nt|westjava: so,good result I think|pg||
nt|haans: Bumpy |pg||
nt|westjava: this is 12 boards each math, reduced from 14 as players request|pg||
nt|westjava: *match|pg||
nt|haans: Teams for next session 2 Then individual|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North beginning to worry- partner needs the heart ace and he does not have to have it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry all -  thought this was start of individual|pg||
nt|haans: think America will get their 1 point|pg||
nt|westjava: not yet Victor:)|pg||
nt|pef: 3s went down only 1 in the open room on significantly different defense|pg||
pc|c5|nt|henryb:  He also did not bid 2@s which he might have with six spades|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ah I thought he would play 9@C.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|rv: In my opinion, the fact that Levin passed here enabled them to compete to 4 level, in OR Sementa opened bidding with 11 hcp and they couldn't compete to 4 level for fear of over ...|pg||
nt|rv: stating values|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: wd.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pef: wow, is that really what he played?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Now made.|pg||
mc|8|nt|yvesj49: oops just made|pg||
nt|pef: hard to believe he didn't just play a high heart now|pg||
