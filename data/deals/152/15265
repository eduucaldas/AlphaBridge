mb|p|nt|jcwla: The competing teams, from Europe and the United States, consist of 12 players each and include one Womens pair and five Open pairs.|pg||

nt|roswolf: coincide, as closely as possible, with it. |pg||
nt|jbgood: difficult to avoid the hopeless game?|pg||
nt|flash: i'm not fond of the 1NT opener with 2 suits unstopped, but Helness made the same call|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: For Europe, NPC Paul Hackett of England has selected Sabine Auken & Daniela von Arnim, Germany, Boye Brogeland & Erik Saelensminde, Geir Helgemo & Tor Helness, Norway, Giorgio ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Duboin & Antonio Sementa, Fulvio Fantoni & Claudio Nunes, Italy, and Jason & Justin Hackett, England.|pg||
nt|mrt2000: expect 4@S now|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably 2@s|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bigtrain: P is forcing followed by 4@S shows a flexible hand|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi Ed|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have 5@C  assuming getting club right|pg||
nt|ady: hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: a feisty auction as one would expec5t at this form of scoring|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcwla: For the USA, NPC Donna Compton has chosen David Berkowitz & Alan Sontag, Bob Hamman & Zia Mahmood, Bobby Levin & Steve Weinstein, Jill Levin & Jill Meyers, Jeff Meckstroth & Eric ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||
nt|jcwla: The competition includes Pairs, Teams and an Individual. All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
nt|flash: in the Individual, even during the round in which a player draws his/her regular partner, they must use the team convention card|pg||
mb|4C|nt|roswolf: for convention cards go to http://www.buffettcup.com/ConventionCards/tabid/151/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
mb|4D|nt|roswolf: this should be axed|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  well over the top|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: Of course Rodwell isn't overjoyed at bidding 3@S but he doesn't have much option.|pg||
nt|flash: likely to hear Meckstroth's shrug when he bids 4@S?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Duboin has to find h shift on winning spd ace to beat this, not difficult for him|pg||
nt|flash: on the lie of the cards, this lead doesn't really cost anything|pg||
nt|kaapo: Nice initiative this Buffet Cup. Any idea if it has made into big newspapers to promote bridge?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D is constructive|pg||
nt|jcwla: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
nt|jcwla: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared.  Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: note South's response on a 1-count |pg||
nt|jcwla: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, we will have the Individual. Each player has drawn a player from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared. Each player partners each of the other eleven ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: players on their team for a short set (6 boards) against various partnerships from the other team.  Each team has agreed on a standard convention card for this event.|pg||
nt|sybarra: need your guessing shoes on in either contract however |pg||
nt|mrdct: now the challenge is to hold this to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1@H and 3@C to lose here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: usually partner will X in response to P|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay very well for n/s    can make 4@S as well |pg||
nt|roswolf: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|roswolf: difficult for north to lead a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: but fortunately south ha another ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|jcwla: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: but they do have to cash the first 4 :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not that you can find it but a @C lead beats 3NT|pg||

nt|roswolf: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|athene: one down is easy (@DAK, @HA, east's trump trick, with a ruff or not)|pg||
nt|roswolf: has|pg||
nt|jbgood: NS can make quite a few tricks in @ds, but ... and 3 NT may go lots of downers if defense is found|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and remember it is BAM scoring|pg||
nt|jbgood: still, may be easier to get the odd extra trick in NT than in @s contract|pg||
nt|flash: with the rather surprising location of the @SK, this will make|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: this may go all the way to 6s, a faulty contract !|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N the likely destination here|pg||
nt|jbgood: for example if S plays the ten now...|pg||
nt|flash: (certainly reasonable to expect 4 @Hs in East's hand and no reason why partner need have any)|pg||
nt|flash: same auction as comparison table|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mrt2000: not a great start for Mexwell|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i think that was wrong the undoubled undertricks may not compensate for the n/s partscore|pg||
nt|roswolf: even -3 might lose the board to -170|pg||
nt|flash: 15-17; xfer; denies 3-card @S spt; GF 2nd suit; conclusion|pg||
nt|psridhar: defense has to set up dia to hold this to 90|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mrdct: meck has a good look at dummy's stiff @CK|pg||
nt|ady: should get an e nd play for down 3|pg||

nt|drewsky: Good Morning, Bridge World :)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: oops|pg||
nt|flash: in the other room, rodwell overcalled 2@H and they sold to 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  just a matter of how many overtricks here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: much discussion on system|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry, a bit ahead of myself !|pg||
nt|athene: and two down will be pretty much impossible i would imagine|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C certainly wasn't a routine action so this might be a swing for europe|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|jbgood: I dont think Broge will try for overtick(s):)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: And 1N was making, likely with overtricks|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but obvious for West to bid 2@s|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mrdct: good start for europe|pg||
nt|athene: East's discard on the @DK asked for a heart, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer only had the @HK it would be necessary to play a heart through to get the second undertrick|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't want to ruff, of course, as soon as he sees dummy |pg||

pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|daman: West will not go down|pg||
nt|ady: yes could be important not to go down 4 which could have been the case on a spade lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: remember The competition includes Pairs, Teams and an Individual. All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: available: a win, a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
nt|ady: Meckstroth can gain entry 3 times including a diamond ruff to play a club|pg||

nt|flash: as long as we're still open, any questions about the event, what's happened, etc?|pg||
nt|flash: the NPCs select the teams; i'm sure availability of the players becomes a factor|pg||
nt|flash: The competing teams, from Europe and the United States, consist of 12 players each and include one Womens' pair and five Open pairs.  |pg||
nt|flash: this year, the USA had only 1 pair playing 'out of partnership'|pg||
nt|flash: and few would argue about the representatives for USA|pg||
nt|flash: some would suggest that the NPC for Europe has to cast his net a bit farther and/or choose other pairs from the countries already represented|pg||

nt|odysseus69: dont know who is playing weak NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Fantoni-Nunes, I think |pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is quite funny. On the European CC we see negative doubles through 3@S, on the American through 7@H!|pg||
nt|flash: jump Q is a mixed raise (limit; usually 4 trumps; some defense)|pg||
nt|flash: a dreadful suit to overcall, but certainly a big enough hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: I knew :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks almost easier than 4 @S actually |pg||
nt|ady: think a slip up in the play playing clubs as it turns out|pg||

nt|mdgraham: On the last board, East may be weak with a long suit. Lebensohl comes in handy (2NT puppets 3@C, then you can bid your long suit). A diretc bid shows reasonable values.|pg||
nt|ady: may be difficult to reach a slam|pg||
nt|flash: Helness chose 1NT - neither action at all likely to find a @D contract...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psridhar: Brogeland seq asks for pd to pick a 2 level major nf|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@H can be beaten, so this not so good for Europe|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@H makes from the N hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a gadget strikes|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: the view in trumps will be crucial here|pg||
nt|athene: he might make even losing to both hearts - he certainly will want to finesse trumps to try to keep south from putting a spade through|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but the BAM scoring method makes a significant difference|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if you just need lots of entries to dummy you might play the @DA here, but he would quite like his second diamond trick|pg||
nt|athene: my guess he will go @DK, club to the ace, trump finesse, and then think about things|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: Boye always thinks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: claims would be easier in teams|pg||
nt|roswolf: he could win in hand and lay down the Ace of trumps - and I dont think that is an unreasonable line of play which would hit the jackpot here|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with winning the first trick in hand and playing a club for the trump finesse is you are using up your clubs before you really want to|pg||
nt|athene: for example @DK, club to ace, trump finesse loses, north plays a club straight back at you|pg||
nt|athene: and you have a nasty guess to make|pg||
nt|athene: if you play @DA here and a heart finesse you have a bit more breathing-space with the club suit|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't want to be cut off from the clubs before trumps are drawn|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence might be able to do that by attacking clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed bill but that is why laying down the ace is not reasonable|pg||
nt|roswolf: not unreasonable i meant!!|pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes but you really, really don't want to lose a trump to south|pg||
nt|athene: and have spade through and immediately lose @SAQ with a possible overruff on a third spade|pg||
nt|athene: i think you have to take lots of trump finesses through south|pg||
nt|roswolf: true that is why declarer's thinking|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm vive la difference!|pg||
nt|jbgood: best game and righthanded too|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes individuals are all about practical bidding|pg||
nt|flash: notice the immediate raise - even without the 4th trump, starting with 1@S, intending to support @Hs later would give a distorted picture of the hand|pg||
nt|flash: the defense surrendered an overtrick next door, so first blood to Europe|pg||
nt|kaapo: Fantoni might open 1@C playing with his regular partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: @C tap right away|pg||
nt|psridhar: sharp competition fro NS even though they r vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: indeed so, but not from S!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unlikely to go down even from S...  J from Jx seems an unlikely choice|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@S isn't a bad spot on the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a fair shot by geir|pg||
nt|psridhar: slam appears one out 2 finesses , shd make here|pg||
nt|flash: Board 1 was an interesting bidding problem for E-W; slam was 50%, but quite hard to judge|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: So West wasn't flying solo when he bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|psridhar: that attacking lead will tap decl trumps, but decl may not mind scoring his little trumps in a dummy reversal manner|pg||
nt|daman: West has to get the @Ss moving|pg||
nt|jbgood: not giwing away 2 heart tricks may be good for Europe|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|flash: Hamman leaves Sontag room, but 10 tricks available on @C position (which is immediately exposed)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bigtrain: always 11 tricks available in @S...  @C lead holds 3N to 10|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good road to slam|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam never really in the picture|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 50%|pg||
pc|h6|nt|odysseus69: looks like 8 tricks i|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, S passed the 1@S opening and EW ended in 3@C.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: it seems duboin quite pessimist|pg||
nt|psridhar: if he guesses the layout he can make 10 tricks for 170|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|sybarra: so the "secret" so far is lead clubs agst. nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt many would lead clubs from Jxxx|pg||
nt|roswolf: a little worse i think and at BAM scoring not a good propostion - unless it makes of course!:)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bigtrain: better lead than from Axxx imo|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: poor quality trumps|pg||
pc|d3|nt|flash: down 2 likely|pg||
nt|psridhar: can Meyers find tht cl shift? :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: tempo seems to dictate a @C lead is best|pg||
nt|psridhar: Ed any comment on why Justin prefered 3h to 2s X ?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 6NT seemed quite ambitious. This seems much better|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: 2-2 @D and @CK in the S hand allow 11 tricks it seems|pg||
nt|flash: given our late start, our operator will fill in the correct names and the score for Board 1 as we go|pg||
pc|d9|nt|daman: this way looks OK as well|pg||
nt|mrt2000: really, I think it's likely to be the best attack at trick 1|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but east didn't bid 4@d a good new with bare ace|pg||

nt|mrt2000: 9 or 10 tricks, I excpect|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but i would still want to pass!|pg||
nt|roswolf: and a probable winning one|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jbgood: even though Zia is West... 2 NT may just roll home |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@S likely a fragment-style bid, as South did not bid 1@S over 1@H |pg||
nt|daman: Some pairs play DOPI for controls over opposition to their 2@C opening|pg||
nt|daman: he might get squeezed if he doesn't take his 2@Hs|pg||
nt|daman: but there is the issue of transportation|pg||
nt|daman: and N can hold the @Ss|pg||
nt|psridhar: decl has 10 top tricks and will need to play h to get his 11th|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: very well done by NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: I always have problems finding my .5 card |pg||
nt|mrdct: optimal spot for NS|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i leant the method this night lol|pg||
nt|flash: a bit surprised at the 2@S call - a limit raise with 3 trumps certainly possible|pg||
nt|othered1: American style is to rebid 2@C on good hands with north's shape, 2@H, with lesser h ands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 3@S is just showing a stop (of sorts) for 3NT,  Does not know North is making slam tries.|pg||
nt|daman: if East had AK10 of @S there would be a shot  |pg||
nt|roswolf: run the club jack and bobs your uncle|pg||
nt|jbgood: or take the di finesse - that is also a winning loser:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||

pc|h3|nt|rv: inpite of big @c fit, @hQ is offside and 9 tricks are limit here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is now about the play|pg||
nt|psridhar: cards are not lying well for NS -Sontag's game try over 2H, if he had tried, wd nott hv been a success|pg||
nt|flash: at the comparison table, Hamma bid 3@D where Saelesminde bid 2@D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: no 1@S overcall - mildly surprising|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5@C is not a bad contract (it is with the @CK ofside:))|pg||
nt|ady: need to avoid the heart finesse     likely to go down |pg||

nt|flash: in 3NT in other room|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psridhar: cl are 5-0|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Interesting now|pg||
nt|jbgood: Helness' 3 spades in the OR more difficult to cope with than the more conservative 2 @s here|pg||
nt|kaapo: East does not have a good bid over 2@C without an agreement|pg||
nt|flash: at the other table, E-W were briefly in 3NT, but Jill Levin (E) pulled that to 4@D; @S lead, so 150 still available|pg||
nt|flash: this forced Helness to guess and he chose 3@S|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|odysseus69: few undos to correct|pg||
nt|lml: what is the max tricks possible?|pg||
nt|flash: the fate of 3@S isn't clear, given the 4-1 split|pg||
nt|othered1: This wouldn't be the worst game ever seen, but the lead makes north happy he's not overboard.|pg||
nt|psridhar: quite well judged by Sontag poised for 110 now|pg||
nt|othered1: And a conservative approach is typical in board-a-match scoring|pg||
nt|flash: so no push on this one|pg||

pc|c7|nt|kaapo: Will he find @SQ? Perhaps he will, because West might bid 1NT holding it|pg||

nt|roswolf: ty terry|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|odysseus69: club lead still not good enough|pg||
nt|rmb1: In a less confident partnership, South would have let North play in hearts by now :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not content with 6@D at pairs. But a club lead may be interesting  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to make after the take out double|pg||
nt|odysseus69: west will be thrown in to concede 2 spade tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess there is a strip squeeze on a club lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
nt|flash: this would have made only 10 tricks - @S finesse works, but nowhere to park the 3rd round of @Ss|pg||
pc|cA|nt|odysseus69: also could duck and squeeze as long as he reads distribution-not a problem either way |pg||
nt|xenya: now he has to get @H right as well|pg||
nt|rv: much needed board for Europeans |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the t/o double places virtually all the high cards - just room for East to hold @SJ perhaps|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Sabine Auken needs to play a @D now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: for 11|pg||
nt|flash: however, this shift has opened up the possibility of an overtrick|pg||
nt|flash: Helness went down in 4@H on Board 20; tie match|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rmb1: Doesn't duck and squeeze require West to have @SJ, which is only card he might not have|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no - spade jack not relevant|pg||
nt|kaapo: Berkowitz shows both majors via Michaels cue bid and with a huge playing strength of course bids game|pg||
nt|psridhar: Berko possibly evaluated his hand as Michaels cue in upper range, seeing that raise to game on 2h pref |pg||
nt|kaapo: EW might have competed in diamonds|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: although West may reduce to a singleton K in spades - but North will get it right  |pg||
nt|rmb1: The plan is for south to have SQx and winning diamond, and North to have SAx and C10.  |pg||
nt|dimi: Nunes has to hold @c K and @s K, so there is no chance to escape the squeeze|pg||
nt|odysseus69: N/S areboth Jill- North Jill Levin -now corrected-wife of Bobby Levin|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: If EW play Attitude, West needed to discourage in @H there|pg||
nt|roswolf: please ignore the imp score scoring is BAM|pg||
nt|roswolf: REHI everyone|pg||
nt|ady: re|pg||
nt|ady: already the club lead to the ace has helped declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: have missed play here will give score at end|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: system crashed|pg||
nt|ady: seems we are back to the beginning|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok terry thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: i think SQ was switched |pg||
nt|ady: with spades 3-3  and declarers clubs set up  defence has to take care to make A@H|pg||
nt|ady: vital in this form of scoring|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment david|pg||
nt|flash: board 2 a push|pg||
nt|flash: same contract; same lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well done |pg||
nt|flash: natural lead of the @CT, so little chance of beating 3@S|pg||
nt|flash: board 14 a push|pg||
nt|flash: Brogeland can actually make the same 11 tricks in Spades as Sontag might have made in Clubs|pg||
nt|flash: but he only needs to take 9 to win the board|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzrg: 12-14|pg||
nt|flash: the situation in the other room is why Smith Echo was invented...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|psridhar: 2c=trf +ve ( dia)|pg||
nt|mrdct: i expect EW will buy this in 3@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: multi,  looks like a good one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.buffettcup.com/Home/tabid/53/language/en-GB/Default.aspx  is the website for the competition. Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: cards for the Individual and other information|pg||
nt|stigw: Hi all, I*ve been allowed as commentator at this table. Maybe I need some help regarding Meckwell's system, I'm afraid.|pg||
nt|flash: weak 2-bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: probably 3NT bye east|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: looks like Fantoni-Nunes are playing their own system|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no response on a 2-count at this vulnerability!|pg||
nt|kaapo: NS should be careful not to get too high here, though I suppose they'll stop at 4@S or 3NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: this bd looks flat in 4h making 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 1@C is 14+ with clubs or 15+ BAL, F|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 9 tricks in hearts and a struggle for 9 in spades -|pg||
nt|xenya: was well defended by N -- that @C shift|pg||
nt|rv: Buffet points format is analogous to a set in tennis, 7-6 is worth same as 6-0|pg||
nt|mrt2000: anybody fancy 6@H?|pg||
nt|ady: e/w will get to 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: matches in the teams are of 14 bds|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this looks a push but this is certainly not a gimmee in an individual|pg||
mb|2H|nt|drewsky: Many partnerships play that 4 of a aminor here by west is NOT a slam try.....|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@h a clever bid putting the presure on north|pg||
nt|mrdct: west happy to defend now|pg||
nt|flash: (that uses an echo in the suit declarer first attacks to indicate how much you like the suit led)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Sontag wanted to bid but I suspect that 2 natural clubs not on the menu|pg||
nt|flash: (so, if Levin were able to conventionally stand up on his chair and scream "my suit's ready to run", E-W would have gotten all their tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: don't be afraid alfred lol|pg||
nt|flash: Sontag has an immense hand opposite the X|pg||
nt|flash: trumps not strong enough (and no shortness), so Sontag pulls to 3@C|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bigtrain: don't worry about that... i can handle things there|pg||
nt|othered1: This won't be exciting in play|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably forcing lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: this shd be a flat bd losing just the 2 aces for 650|pg||
nt|psridhar: in 4S on h lead, decl will be put to a dilemma on dia shift ( on winning spd King) from W-whether to finesse or not at BAM|pg||
nt|psridhar: no such probleems in 3nt :)|pg||
nt|flash: 2@H fourth suit forcing - creates a game force; as we can see, doesn't say anything about East's holding in the suit|pg||
nt|kaapo: Saelesminde's bidding 1NT would've made the bidding simpler|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: 6@H is not a bad contract but it won't make with the club offside|pg||
nt|mrdct: but will +100 be enough for europe to win the board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We have the big train here to tell us about the Meckwell system|pg||
nt|roswolf: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|jbgood: doesnt really matter whether he plays 2 or 3 - if he doesnt get 9, he loses the board, if he gets 10, he wins it|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the play is the thing|pg||
nt|psridhar: assuming NS wont venture 5c in other room |pg||
nt|flash: 3@S pre-emptive; other ways to raise to show stronger hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: as is the modern style aggressive bidding all round|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@H is a transfer 0-11 4 @S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 1@h shows spades. Good here for double  to be take-out of the shown suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3nt wont play well on a h lead; 5c has chances|pg||
nt|diumraid: Current in running scores for the Buffett Cup USA 28 EUR 20. To win a continent needs to obtain 100 points. We are in Ruuning in Round 4 of 5 today.|pg||
nt|drewsky: simply a prepared bid in case the enemy calls 4@S, |pg||
nt|andyv:  at least S will find a couple of useful Jacks in N's hand|pg||
nt|rv: each round in Teams and Pairs are worth 4 Buffet points, in Individual event 2 Buffet Points, total of 198 Buffet points at stake over 4 days|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @S to the 9 looks normal, but fatal here|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|ady: probable club lead  |pg||
nt|ady: onviously 2NT forcing|pg||
nt|yvesj49: easy on @c lead|pg||
nt|flash: all 13 available (but certainly not expected)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to John Carruthers|pg||
nt|jgc: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4s save was 300, but EW may press on to 5H-perhaps 5s for 500 is par|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bigtrain: down 2 is a live possibility|pg||
nt|mrdct: true|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh, there he is, hello Walter|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes friendly beak in @S|pg||
nt|yvesj49: at least 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 2h showed extra|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|flash: Weinstein a bit worried about Sontag's length in @Cs, but would probably have seen a 2NT call (scrambling) if he didn't have 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: this is how the event is being played      http://www.buffettcup.com/EventDetails/tabid/70/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|roswolf: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|flash: hi, John - action's fast and furious - not the usual pace for this form of scoring  :)|pg||
nt|flash: Hamman - Weinstein found a good defense against Helness' 3@S, but he's still on track for 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: whichever team gets 100 Buffet Points first wins this edition of Warren Buffet Cup|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: only @SA and !x will let him get out for down 1. Unlikely...|pg||
nt|flash: correct, Victor - Landy is the flavor of the day for USA (2@C shows Majors; rest natural)|pg||
nt|flash: @S shift to hold this to 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: West now has the option of playing North for @s109 doubleton|pg||
nt|stigw: It semmes - the system I mean - to function for them, but I wouldnt dare to try to copy them !|pg||
nt|roswolf: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: jeff is thinking about the play of the Q@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: the current score is USA 60 EUROPE 48|pg||
nt|yvesj49: in teams it's probably the only chance to beat|pg||
nt|ady: have to be carefull not to let 11 tricks through   not taking A@H|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: i bet he is thinking on how to minimise declarer's tricks - i think he will go passive|pg||
nt|roswolf: remember this is BAM scoring|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure by team it's different|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kaapo: Two first scores were duplicated in the open room. Board 9 has some room for variance|pg||
nt|flash: Sontag finds a safe lead - 11 tricks possible if Saelesminde leads a small Spade from dummy at trick 2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|odysseus69: cant understand Fantoni double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: surprised East didn't rebid 2@s with four-card support|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. However, the scoreboard is americanized for obvious reasons, so we ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: must live with 1-½-0 on the scoreboard. I am sure you can figure it out reghardless|pg||
nt|daman: scores as the come in     http://www.buffettcup.com/RunningScores2010/tabid/155/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|psridhar: Brogeland has tthiss beat in his hand-though he doesnt know it yet|pg||
nt|daman: @D lead is best|pg||
nt|flash: USA +2 in Match B; Match C tied|pg||
nt|flash: well done|pg||
nt|flash: (else declarer would have had time to set up the @Ds for a @S pitch)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jan_jansma: But thast is for us, mortals|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|flash: but that looks anti-percentage, so we're more likely to see 10|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|daman: I take that back |pg||
nt|daman: must be my green tea|pg||
nt|psridhar: Rodwell will scramble 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|othered1: NS have a -200 save in @D, b ut it's not clear how to get in at these colors |pg||
nt|psridhar: Helness made a trick more but was in a cont 2 tricks higher on bd 3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|daman: @D was the best continuation|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
nt|lml: the club shift will end nthe hand quickly|pg||
nt|rv: could Fantoni competed to 3@h? not sure|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so he mnay well lead the king of spades when he next gets in - let's see|pg||
nt|jcwla: Back in a flash.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|psridhar: they r off 2 aces but it is that well positioned Jack of trumps thats going to beat the slam|pg||
nt|daman: Daily Bulletins    http://www.buffettcup.com/DailyBulletins/tabid/86/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|daman: they are in 4NT   NS in the Open Room|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jan_jansma: Meckstroth mortal like us too|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: more often 1 spade as take-out and double to show hearts|pg||
nt|rv: looks like Rodwell will make 8 tricks here, 3@h is possibly 1 down and may not get doubled|pg||
nt|odysseus69: after passing I am more and more liking natural over 1NT - have tried everything|pg||

nt|othered1: works with east holding *all* high cards, incl @DJ.  |pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, Auken needs to hold @CKQ and @DKJ for that to work|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: I'm sure it is part of the meckwell system|pg||

nt|rv: at the end of 5 rounds of Pairs on Day 1 (yesterday), US have won 10 matches and Europe won 5 matches out of 15 (3 per round)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jan_jansma: a "normal"  -200|pg||
nt|flash: Hamman played safe (?) on the 2nd round of trumps; @S position exposed; 12 tricks...|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: whereas if you double as take-out of spades, they won't play 1@Hx, and you are off the hook|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: nice ending here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|odysseus69: easy diamond discard|pg||
nt|mrt2000: ah, not so, board to Europe|pg||
nt|jbgood: and this will be the first flat one in this set - worth 0.5 for both pairs in the scoring|pg||

nt|daman: although Levin lead a @S|pg||
nt|daman: if he led the @H J   that would have been useful|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1,2 or 3@H with south?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1|pg||
nt|athene: OK so he laid down the @HA - that worked out well|pg||
nt|flash: board 3 also in as a push|pg||
nt|flash: we'll see if Zia can collect at least one more trick...|pg||
nt|kaapo: USA on their way to slam on 15|pg||
nt|flash: the operator at the comparison table seems to be having a lot of problems|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kaapo: This makes it easier. Sontag was quite maximum for his 2NT, so more difficult for defence to know what to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 4 spades easy make and 5D a good save|pg||
nt|dimi: good def in 5@d for EW|pg||
nt|bigtrain: me to|pg||
nt|bigtrain: too|pg||
nt|flash: that (lack of an) overtrick may be costly|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bigtrain: XX shows 4+@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What was the score on 16 in this room, anyone know?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Where Helness did not finesse hearts in 6@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: However, 6@S here does not have many problems|pg||
nt|flash: we simply don't believe that the Board 4 auction could have been 1@C - 1@D - 1NT  passed out|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: this could get high very quickly|pg||
nt|mrdct: too much outside to preempt|pg||
nt|flash: the Norwegians are in 3NT on 22, so, again, no push board|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lml: 4@H looks normal here but maybe by way of stayman|pg||
nt|bigtrain: neb diamond shows 2+@D 10-15 many shapes possible|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@C a sound @H raise|pg||
nt|psridhar: That take out X is aggressive facing a passed pd and only 3 spds and slender values|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: and went 1 down in the open room|pg||
nt|yvesj49: we didn't see this board roland|pg||
nt|athene: wow, that's some pass from east, assuming the double is normal penalties|pg||
nt|athene: this was really the auction? or you are just putting in the final contract?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think we're just catching up|pg||
nt|athene: yes, right, that seems more likely|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi everyone|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps it went something like 2@S - 2NT - 3@S - double - all pass|pg||
nt|flash: as usual, with Sontag at the table, we're well ahead of the comparison table|pg||
nt|psridhar: this will be a quick 4s making 420 for ns|pg||
nt|kaapo: Easy 4@S to play|pg||
nt|kaapo: Is it as easy to bid?|pg||
nt|flash: 2NT is Jacoby - typically a balanced GF raise with 4 trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: and opening values anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ok|pg||
nt|stigw: 3 cl down 2 I imagine.|pg||
nt|stigw: Sorry, that was board 15 - a very unlucky start for Hellnes.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: NS very agressive.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 3n just on last sementa apol|pg||
nt|athene: then everyone would be sort of sane|pg||
nt|flash: you saw it here, folks!!!   Sontag opened 1@C and it wasn't strong, artificial and forcing!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: arguably the weakest pair in the field, Hackett twins have lost all 5 of their matches yesterday|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure of problem on bd 15 |pg||
nt|kaapo: I guess many Norths will open 1NT|pg||
nt|flash: Sementa has led a @H against 6NT, so the match will be all square|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: unless NS lose their diamond fit, which has indeed happened |pg||
nt|daman: they are going down more than 1 in 4NT|pg||
nt|drewsky: stayman, then smolen, the delayed jacoby.....thats the way I like to play it|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a soft lead and declarer should make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|flash: (and the result at this table irrelevant)|pg||
nt|psridhar: after that preempt impossible to find 3S (par for EW )-if justin had balanced 3s , Duboin wd hv raised it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: should get to 4@s now|pg||
nt|ady: clubs well placed|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 2nd diamond and a club from dummy|pg||
nt|flash: 2/1 by passed hand not forcing|pg||
nt|kaapo: Auken chooses to make the take out double once she's given a chance so low|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES BUFFETT CUP **** USA  94 EUR 80 ****   |pg||

nt|xenya: 3@H is not quite clear to me |pg||
nt|othered1: East  has a lot of cards for the auction up to him.  Not unusual when two pairs use light initial action approaches|pg||
nt|yvesj49: justin will make|pg||

mb|5H|nt|yvesj49: club now|pg||
nt|yvesj49: and with 10/9 alone|pg||
nt|kaapo: An extra pass here?|pg||
nt|flash: now Sontag gets to show his @H control (and his 2nd round control in @Cs) - that may be enough|pg||
nt|kaapo: Suppose it was Zia bidding 5@C|pg||
nt|flash: yes - that looks far more likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: many pairs play 1c-2h/2s to show major 2 suitor in a limited range-not Saelensmin|pg||
nt|daman: they must play standard count in this situation|pg||
nt|rv: sorry they lost 4 out of 5 matches|pg||
nt|bigtrain: don't think they have any play at 10 tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: valuing spade q and so no splinter|pg||

nt|vugraphzrg: no discussion|pg||
mb|5N|nt|rv: 10 tricks are possible here|pg||

nt|rv: thanks to all kibitzers for helping me and other commentators when we make mistakes:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: R deep in thought|pg||
nt|rv: another surprising stat from Day 1, Fantunes have also lost 4 matches on Day 1|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if east thought of redoubling, if it would have shown power?  And would NS have sat it out?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well after 3@D - CANTY TYPE QUICK ENOUGH:(|pg||
nt|flash: wonder if Europe has a Drury call available|pg||
nt|flash: good point, Victor - splintering with a singleton K or Q can distort partner's evaluation|pg||
mb|d|nt|rv: they are too good a pair and I expect them to bounce back today|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 15 poss fouled board in OR?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: lets ask GIB :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event|pg||
nt|flash: 2NT usually an inquiry as to the nature of the raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: auction correct|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or perhaps West wanted to drive to 5@H but tried to direct the lead on the way|pg||
nt|flash: thnx, Trevor|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: can't ruff @c losers and control trumps|pg||
nt|stigw: I guess he might make it now, but no sure thing, even if the start was promising.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: only 6 tricks available for NS|pg||
nt|bigtrain: overtricks are possible for e/w|pg||
nt|stigw: Meck is best to duck here, but not obvious by any means.|pg||
nt|othered1: agree on overtrice|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: what she should have bid last time- this sounded like a slam try - and maye it stopped Fantoni bidding 5D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not easy for EW, the way the auction went|pg||
nt|daman: Incredibly    Levin/Meyers are in 2NT in the OR|pg||
nt|chessmaste: whoops|pg||
nt|bigtrain: or should i say overtrick|pg||
mb|6S|nt|xenya: maybe it shows E's shape?|pg||
nt|drewsky: Apparently they play some sort of funny stayman (modified puppet perhaps), and they got their wires crossed|pg||
nt|lml: they have obviously had some confusion|pg||
nt|xenya: modified puppet, i'm to;d|pg||
nt|roswolf: getting the trumps right will be difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrg: E/W 6/4 majors but disagree on which way|pg||
nt|psridhar: whats that duck ? Auken shd hv some spds for her tke out X ?|pg||
nt|othered1: On that play to the first trick, I'll guess Sontag makes this easily|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: if 2s wasnt forcing, E needed to bid more-may be he could have balanced 2N ( unbal, 2 suitor) and corrected 3m to 3H showing spds as his 2nd suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2nt is odd with 6-5 in maj|pg||
nt|stigw: Must be a winning board for Europe here.|pg||
nt|psridhar: he still has he 4th club to take care of -finesse the 10 spot seems the only solution|pg||
nt|othered1: do they play attitude leads against suits?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Helgemo - Helness stopped rather surprisingly at 3@H on board 9, so USA took the lead in this match|pg||
nt|psridhar: even then u shd be allowed to lead 9 from kj9 tripleton|pg||
nt|othered1: Sure -- that's leading low.|pg||
nt|kaapo: I think the convention card described leads vs suit contracts as "3rd or 5th"|pg||
pc|c4|nt|flash: Boards 3 and 4 have been corrected in the other room|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: and it looks like twelve tricks are there in diamonds - with a shot at thirteen, too|pg||
nt|psridhar: i even sympathise with a 4h punt over 1n-p-p in E seat|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry - I was bidding upside down-2 hearts of course made no sense as did mmy comments|pg||
nt|flash: on the lead and the position of the @CK, down 1|pg||
nt|flash: this looks as though it'll be fast, so let me get a head-start on...|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to the organizing committee for a great job in attracting some of the best pairs in the world|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: 5 rounds of Pairs were played yesterday, total of 15 maches and 60 Buffet points decided|pg||
nt|rv: 60 out of 198 Buffet Points decided on Day 1|pg||
nt|psridhar: so cant duck from QXXX|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|daman: uncle|pg||
nt|daman: white flag of surrender|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe with Axx spades North should bid 2 spades rather than 2NT|pg||
nt|flash: the field is immensely stronger than it was 2 years ago and the bridge has been well worth watching|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jan_jansma: ?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: sorry was private|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jan_jansma: @C @C creates a @S trick with the @SJ|pg||
nt|jbgood: not sure - Geir may just find it, S is marked with a king and some di support, so may not have the spade queen|pg||
nt|othered1: with this ultrafriendly lie of the cards, 4@SX -100 looks like par.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|flash: again, the convention card is a bit sparse (not to mention the last-minute change to 2/1 GF)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|flash: 3@S making won that board; Board 4 was a push|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: 180 isn't an automatic win|pg||
nt|stigw: To beat it they must play in a way that probably on this layout means several ovcertricks (at board a match scoring).|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables are no longer linked|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps EW have some other lead convention in their regular partnership which caused confusion|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mrdct: @s now for guaranteed beat looks best|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: and everything else also works for EW|pg||
nt|yvesj49: oops|pg||
nt|roswolf: that may give declarer a clue|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  well done by the D|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Pairs, BAM and Teams, all events are scored on BAM style which are converted to Buffet Points at the end of matches|pg||
nt|yvesj49: overtrick is here now|pg||
nt|flash: this will also be a push, clinching at least a tie for Europe in the match|pg||
nt|kaapo: Without West's brave 3@H overcall, North would likely have been able to describe something useful for South|pg||
mc|12|nt|Walddk4: Operator, could you please shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Better now than later|pg||
nt|flash: as usual, with Sontag at the table, we've pulled far ahead of the comparison table|pg||
nt|kaapo: Like long diamonds or short clubs|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: a win for Europe for playing trump contract !|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the last hand decisive|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4H by S can make|pg||
nt|othered1: Would Sontag have gotten @H right without the trick 1 gift?  I don't think it impossible|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to our expert on the Meckwell system, Walter Johnson|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcwla: On Board 3, Saelensminde led the @SK against 3NT and held it to five, so a win to Europe there.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Wojo|pg||

nt|bigtrain: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Walter|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: sorry, distracted & missed carding|pg||

nt|flash: re-start at top of the hour - last match of the day coming up|pg||
nt|psridhar: bd 5|pg||
nt|kaapo: Another nice hand :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: I dont think he will pass but he is thinking about it|pg||
nt|chessmaste: tough call for West|pg||
nt|yvesj49: the question was is it normal to play 1NT X lol|pg||
nt|flash: last board of the match...   feel we've barely settled in!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: how good is his hand for hearts\?|pg||
nt|drewsky: West has many choices....|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a lot of views to get right/wrong|pg||
nt|flash: lots of boards to watch at the comparison table and/or at other matches|pg||
nt|psridhar: a 4h opg will be more pressure on NS; 3h seems conservative at these colours|pg||
mb|2S|nt|daman: 2NT was bizarre|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d showing one 6+M (rarely 5) is part of popular Woolsey convention|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they get the @D's in play |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D = 0-7 any shape|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Too strong to overcall 1@S?|pg||
nt|athene: lots of guessing to do|pg||
nt|roswolf: playing in nt is impressive in the other room with a 6-4 fit|pg||
nt|flash: i believe it was Duboin who reportedly had the line of the year...|pg||
nt|flash: Zia's already taken 5 tricks, so USA has clinched at least a tie in this match|pg||
nt|psridhar: that shd end the auction|pg||
nt|kaapo: That would've fit Zia's hand very well|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: with NS playing precision there will be a delay in them finding their @d fit|pg||
nt|stigw: No, thats another question - but "meckwell" sometimes do starnge things (and usually come out successfully).|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: a prempt with an ace and a king on thee side and trump suit headed by jack may seem abnormal, but is often effective|pg||
nt|daman: in my youth I would have bid 5@C with the N hand and lucked out|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H = 4+ forcing, might have a longer minor|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe strange for general consumption but they are very disciplined within the structure|pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead will solve one problem|pg||
nt|flash: evidently, USA is 2 up in both the B and C matches; 3 Buffett Points away from winning back the Cup...|pg||
nt|kaapo: I'd have guessed von Arnim to open this. She opens very light in her regular system|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: EW make 4@s easily enough, so NS's task is to locate a paying save|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 4+|pg||
nt|mrdct: if they do ever find it|pg||
nt|athene: but then @C10 switch|pg||
nt|othered1: right, but do EW let NS play it on other auctions?|pg||
nt|flash: restart in 1 hour 10 minutes|pg||
nt|psridhar: though 4h costs 800|pg||
nt|kaapo: East can choose the level of his opening from a large variety. Perhaps the 7222 distribution made him not to open 4|pg||
nt|kaapo: Now she didn't get a good chance to enter the auction|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah, she did|pg||
nt|flash: quite a brave action, but you don't get rich allowing the opps to play in an 8-card fit at the 2-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the spades are actually fairlky useful as the cards lie|pg||
nt|drewsky: my que bidding he is over bidding but will enusre that he at least gets to the correct game.|pg||
nt|xenya: well W has been warned...|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the bidding was simple|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps more of a clue now|pg||
nt|jbgood: is there a 12th?|pg||
nt|roswolf: there may well be on that lead|pg||
nt|jgc: yes...?|pg||
nt|flash: in New Orleans, during the 1st half of the semi-final match in the Spingold|pg||
nt|flash: Sementa had a blood-pressure spike and had to be taken to hospital|pg||
nt|flash: as they're wheeling him out, Duboin says:  Tonio - if you die, know that you played well today|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 2D probably checkback|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d probably artificial GF|pg||
nt|flash: this looks like a straightforward 11 (famous last words)|pg||
nt|flash: other matches:  3-0 USA and 2-2; so another good round for the USA |pg||
nt|psridhar: thats why 4s X -1 looks par|pg||
nt|flash: she might have called 2@H over 1@S (as Weinstein did in the other room)|pg||
nt|flash: putting much less at risk and involving partner in the decision|pg||
nt|flash: Helness took the push to 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: on the nother hand....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@D may buy it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would think 2 @D logical bid now but oh well.....|pg||
nt|mrdct: interesting that east didn't act over 1@c|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: this hand might take a while|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Duck the first trick and @H towards the @H9 looks best|pg||
nt|mrdct: east will be keen to score a trick with the @s2 and may try to duck a @c and then play !A and try to ruff one in her hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: the better plan may be to fire @ds back at the defence|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good lead !|pg||
nt|kaapo: Is it clear to double as North if East opens 4@H?|pg||
nt|psridhar: one simple way of looking at it is- ' i hv 7 tricks nv vs vul-on rule of 2 and 3 it is 4h'|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcwla: This is the type of board where "or it makes or it doesn't" -- E's actions really surprising.|pg||
nt|mrdct: the defence need to be careful too not to get frisky with playing @h and giving south unwanted ruffs|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @ST return now? With the @S87 in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: I'm told we're awaiting a ruling on board 16|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: from OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Russell |pg||
nt|mrdct: @s10 is good as it sends the message to north that i have control of trumps - no ruffs needed|pg||
nt|athene: you have to rise the king to block them and play a diamond to the jack right away to set up a discard|pg||
nt|athene: maybe this is all findable|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't see why you should play for clubs 5-2|pg||
nt|jbgood: kibs disagree - from 11 to 13 tricks - tu:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5H looks a profitble save for 300 may be|pg||
nt|othered1: 7@H would be a good save v. 6@S|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES BUFFETT CUP **** USA  96 EUR 78 ****   |pg||
nt|flash: the Law says bid 3@S; Sontag's hand says surrender...|pg||

pc|s4|nt|mrdct: east will be analysing how 5@d will fare here|pg||
nt|mrt2000: W needs to go quietly here|pg||
nt|yvesj49: trump promotion|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: snap|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South shows 3 spades and thats enough info for North|pg||
nt|lml: by and large the hand lies well for duboin|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oh dear ....................|pg||
nt|mrt2000: can make 5 now|pg||
nt|athene: you might just rely on @CA and @CQ both onside|pg||
nt|flash: Europe leading 3-2 in our C match; we've had some problems with our B match broadcast, so i don't have a score for that|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|psridhar: excellent shift|pg||
nt|athene: sorry you have to play trumps first otherwise north gets a club ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the bidding suggests distribution held by the defenders|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but the bidding would have been the same if south had @Sx @HA10xxx @DAxx @CAQ109|pg||
nt|athene: and if he does, the winning line is to put the jack on the @C10|pg||
nt|athene: we don't have a play record from the other room|pg||
nt|athene: so we don't know if zia was put to the test and passed it brilliantly :)|pg||
nt|athene: if he did it will surely be bulletin material|pg||
nt|flash: 9 tricks available here|pg||
nt|flash: Europe wins the C Match - a first step toward recovering from last round's 0-3 record|pg||
nt|flash: still a big lead for USA, no matter the outcome of this match and the B match|pg||
pc|hK|nt|odysseus69: no problems here with 2 out of 3 finesses right and no bad breaks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: useful here to have two raises over the double - a good raise and a weak raise. It looks like EW have no such agreement|pg||
nt|athene: boink|pg||
nt|athene: ok, now it's time for Brogeland to be a hero|pg||
nt|athene: i don't honestly see any reason to guess this right|pg||
nt|jgc: Great line! But I thought it was Versace who said it.|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wd hvv been tempted to bid 5s on that 9 card suit :)|pg||
nt|othered1: absent @C lead.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: e.g, 2@s=weak raise, 2@h=good raise |pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: they are in 5@C doubled in the OR|pg||
nt|mrdct: -500 may still win the board|pg||
nt|psridhar: vs 6s LOW club lead wont do-cl jack needed|pg||
nt|othered1: right, high @C lead|pg||
nt|flash: 10 tricks coming; thnx, all - back in just over an hour|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lml: there are a number of choices but pretty well everything works|pg||
nt|rv: losing an extra @s trick, but avoided a @h ruff in bargain|pg||
nt|roswolf: i fancy 12|pg||
nt|kaapo: On the other hand, after Roland's announcement, all they need to take any more is the Trophy with them :)|pg||
nt|flash: as we can see, the opponents Spades are 2-2; had they been 3-1 3@H would have made|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bigtrain: no way do they reach 5@D|pg||
nt|stigw: Very good lead indeed.|pg||
nt|roswolf: down the middle!|pg||
nt|flash: Board 16 in as a push|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|jan_jansma: "psyching xxx in @D now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this is all about -1 vs -2|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2 off|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: yes there is a double squeeze but can declarer read it?|pg||
nt|flash: the defense can take their @H tricks early or late...|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps Sontag could try 5@S. He may have some more spades and less defence that partner might expect|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Break for lunch after this set. Restart at 14.00 BST, in about 1 hour and 5 minutes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: yes -- there is room for either @HK or @DA in the S hand -- but taking a @H hook looks normal|pg||
nt|roswolf: the @D7 discard was a mistake|pg||
nt|flash: Zia on a @D guess to make 1NT - irrelevant to score on the board, but interesting; he gets it right!!|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of course his partner could hold stronger hearts than he has now|pg||
nt|othered1: This hasn't been the best defense.|pg||
nt|kaapo: This might well be the decisive board|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mrdct: auken wishing she had a better pip than the @S2|pg||
nt|mrdct: i prefer a @d rather than @h at this point|pg||
nt|mrdct: -1 inevitable now|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: in OR, someone apparently looked at wrong hand|pg||
nt|flash: all of which suggests that perhaps Sontag should have followed the Law (of Total Tricks) and bid 3@S|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|lml: cashing the diamond ace is good|pg||
nt|flash: so USA need only push one of the two boards remaining at our comparison table to clinch a 2nd win this round|pg||
nt|flash: the third match is still tied|pg||
nt|flash: Helness-Fantoni in 5@C on board 17; Zia found the @H lead, so that will also fail and USA will clinch the match|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|daman: 5 was -1|pg||
nt|mrdct: on this board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: on brd 16|pg||

nt|flash: thnx again, all; we hope to see you back here tomorrow and/or on another BBO Vugraph presentation|pg||
nt|psridhar: a certain win on the bd i expect for europe|pg||
nt|kaapo: 3NT made only 10 tricks on board 10 in the open room. A board for USA there. So Europe need to win boards 11 and 12 to tie the match|pg||

nt|petergill: website for Daily Bulletins, News etc is http://www.buffettcup.com/|pg||
nt|flash: von Arnim can play on Clubs to get a pitch, but that lets Zia score his @H3 - a trick for a trick|pg||
pc|cK|nt|suketbombi: 6@Cs 2@S and a3@H a possible make  5@Cs was|pg||
nt|yvesj49: jeff had to ruff with 7 @h|pg||
nt|yvesj49: not obvious|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hard start for the twins but they are now well in the play lol|pg||
nt|jbgood: this is the toughie of the toughies - Buffet points on a squeeze overtrick on the last hand of the set!|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|daman: @S ruff|pg||
nt|rv: looks like only 8 tricks now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: oops|pg||
nt|mrdct: so 16 either gets thrown out or the bridge lawyers get involved|pg||
nt|odysseus69: we can see that it is a simple matter to take the rest- Brogeland is concerned about 4-1 spades|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: but possibly East didn't expect so much from West (although everything is in the right places) - remember this EW pair open  ad respond very light|pg||
nt|stigw: This ought to be a sure + for Europe.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes high standard needed to win anything here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lml: now Duboin can make 5|pg||
nt|xenya: this might make up fot the disaster on the previous hand |pg||
nt|bigtrain: this looks like it risks -2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @D pitch and defensive surrogate trumps|pg||
nt|mrdct: on 16 there is quite a bit of precedent that if a good result is obtained at one table and then the board is fouled at the other |pg||
nt|mrdct: table - the director can rule against the side that fouled the board|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Sabine will be disppointed with herself if she goes down 2 here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|drewsky: HArd for Levin to see that...|pg||
nt|lml: I dont know|pg||
nt|lml: West can't have much less|pg||
nt|rv: can East be strip squeezed?|pg||
nt|mrdct: it is usually the responsibility of north to orientate the board correctly at the table so it could go against europe|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: but down 1 it will be|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm oh well|pg||
nt|jbgood: not coming, so a win for Europe here|pg||
nt|flash: all (sensible?) roads lead to 11 tricks...   picking one has proved difficult  :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rmb1: @CQ to tkake finesse, and eventually finesse in diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: smooth duck best|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|kaapo: Thanks, bye|pg||
mc|8|nt|kaapo: Thanks and bye|pg||
