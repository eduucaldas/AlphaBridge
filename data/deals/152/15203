nt|odysseus69: welcome to the Buffet cup - the formatt seeks to follow the Ryder cup|pg||

nt|odysseus69: for the first stage each pair is matched against a specific pair from the other side- the matched pairs sit in the same direction and play against the other pairs from the opposing ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: team|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Welcome to the Miskin Manor hotel, near Cardiff in Wales, for the 3rd edition of the Warren Buffett Bridge Cup. This contest has the concept of golfs Ryder Cup and is scheduled to ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: coincide, as closely as possible, with it. |pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all welcome :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning from Los Angeles to all|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: The competing teams, from Europe and the United States, consist of 12 players each and include one Womens pair and five Open pairs.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jcwla: For Europe, NPC Paul Hackett of England has selected Sabine Auken & Daniela von Arnim, Germany, Boye Brogeland & Erik Saelensminde, Geir Helgemo & Tor Helness, Norway, Giorgio ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Duboin & Antonio Sementa, Fulvio Fantoni & Claudio Nunes, Italy, and Jason & Justin Hackett, England.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|jcwla: For the USA, NPC Donna Compton has chosen David Berkowitz & Alan Sontag, Bob Hamman & Zia Mahmood, Bobby Levin & Steve Weinstein, Jill Levin & Jill Meyers, Jeff Meckstroth & Eric ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||
nt|jcwla: The competition includes Pairs, Teams and an Individual. All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D is constructive|pg||
nt|jcwla: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
nt|jcwla: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared.  Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: note South's response on a 1-count |pg||
nt|jcwla: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, we will have the Individual. Each player has drawn a player from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared. Each player partners each of the other eleven ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: players on their team for a short set (6 boards) against various partnerships from the other team.  Each team has agreed on a standard convention card for this event.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|jcwla: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psridhar: this may go all the way to 6s, a faulty contract !|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I don't think so|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|s4|pg||

nt|rv: Hi all, warm welcome from Bangalore in South India|pg||
mb|3S|nt|odysseus69: no not a board a match - over 11 boards each pair is competing gainst a specific pair from the other team|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont know who is playing weak NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Fantoni-Nunes, I think |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: 28-20 i heard|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Andy, Roland and all specs, 2 great pairs playing here, what more can I a bridge lover ask for:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcwla: With all that said, hi Mike.  Looks like a very good result for Europe on Board 1.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you need the 1NT in "sandwich" position to be natural against this EW pair. They open and respond very light. |pg||
nt|daman: weak Smolen|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: Hi Jordan|pg||
nt|mdgraham: On the last board, East may be weak with a long suit. Lebensohl comes in handy (2NT puppets 3@C, then you can bid your long suit). A diretc bid shows reasonable values.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psridhar: Brogeland seq asks for pd to pick a 2 level major nf|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|daman: @C tap right away|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: So West wasn't flying solo when he bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|psridhar: that attacking lead will tap decl trumps, but decl may not mind scoring his little trumps in a dummy reversal manner|pg||
nt|daman: West has to get the @Ss moving|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|nt|odysseus69: looks like 8 tricks i|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, S passed the 1@S opening and EW ended in 3@C.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|xenya: 2-2 @D and @CK in the S hand allow 11 tricks it seems|pg||

nt|daman: this way looks OK as well|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|psridhar: Brogeland playing dummy reversal indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: Duboin is on the right track so far|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rmb1: Do Justin+Jason still play weak NT?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no- 14-16 rising to 15-17 in 3rd and 4th|pg||
nt|psridhar: needs to use dia ace to play spd|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be down 1...NS just need to be careful and not get endplayed in the @h suit|pg||

nt|psridhar: but EW bid well with E bidding only 1nt on a goodish 18|pg||
nt|lml: hi :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 14-16|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: possible auction here -  3NT-6@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, same start to the auction, but Brogeland did not move over N's 1NT, so a win to USA there.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: goodish is a new word to me|pg||
nt|rv: for this match Zia, Hamman and Meckwell are for US, German Ladies, Fantunes for Europe|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|odysseus69: sure to make 6D - but can they get there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has a huge hand now after the 3@D jump |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and not bid grand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rv: this seems to be par contract|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: 3@S likely a fragment-style bid, as South did not bid 1@S over 1@H |pg||
nt|daman: Some pairs play DOPI for controls over opposition to their 2@C opening|pg||
nt|daman: he might get squeezed if he doesn't take his 2@Hs|pg||
nt|daman: but there is the issue of transportation|pg||
nt|daman: and N can hold the @Ss|pg||
nt|psridhar: decl has 10 top tricks and will need to play h to get his 11th|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rmb1: 3@S is just showing a stop (of sorts) for 3NT,  Does not know North is making slam tries.|pg||
nt|daman: if East had AK10 of @S there would be a shot  |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psridhar: now decl is a tempo behind -likely only 430|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rv: inpite of big @c fit, @hQ is offside and 9 tricks are limit here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: no 1@S overcall - mildly surprising|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psridhar: cl are 5-0|pg||
pc|sK|nt|odysseus69: few undos to correct|pg||
nt|lml: what is the max tricks possible?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: does now....|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Teams, Pairs and Individual events in Wareen Buffet Cup, every event is scored on BAM style, so OTs and UTs are very important|pg||
nt|rv: German ladies have competed to 3@s in OR which is only 1 down|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|xenya: i think he can make 11 now|pg||
nt|lml: 5 i think after that good guess|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a @D and a @S|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|odysseus69: club lead still not good enough|pg||
nt|rmb1: In a less confident partnership, South would have let North play in hearts by now :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not content with 6@D at pairs. But a club lead may be interesting  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to make after the take out double|pg||
nt|odysseus69: west will be thrown in to concede 2 spade tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess there is a strip squeeze on a club lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|odysseus69: also could duck and squeeze as long as he reads distribution-not a problem either way |pg||
nt|xenya: now he has to get @H right as well|pg||
nt|rv: much needed board for Europeans |pg||
mc|9|nt|mdgraham: the t/o double places virtually all the high cards - just room for East to hold @SJ perhaps|pg||

nt|mdgraham: no response on a 2-count at this vulnerability!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 1@C is 14+ with clubs or 15+ BAL, F|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 9 tricks in hearts and a struggle for 9 in spades -|pg||
nt|xenya: was well defended by N -- that @C shift|pg||
nt|rv: Buffet points format is analogous to a set in tennis, 7-6 is worth same as 6-0|pg||
mb|p|nt|drewsky: Many partnerships play that 4 of a aminor here by west is NOT a slam try.....|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: 6@H is not a bad contract but it won't make with the club offside|pg||
pc|c6|nt|odysseus69: as is the modern style aggressive bidding all round|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@H is a transfer 0-11 4 @S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 1@h shows spades. Good here for double  to be take-out of the shown suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3nt wont play well on a h lead; 5c has chances|pg||
nt|diumraid: Current in running scores for the Buffett Cup USA 28 EUR 20. To win a continent needs to obtain 100 points. We are in Ruuning in Round 4 of 5 today.|pg||
nt|drewsky: simply a prepared bid in case the enemy calls 4@S, |pg||
nt|andyv:  at least S will find a couple of useful Jacks in N's hand|pg||
nt|rv: each round in Teams and Pairs are worth 4 Buffet points, in Individual event 2 Buffet Points, total of 198 Buffet points at stake over 4 days|pg||

pc|s8|nt|brolucius: I see that Fantoni did pass his partner's weak-two at the other table, later protecting with 3@D over 2NT.|pg||

nt|brolucius: If you put your cursor over the 'Closed Room:' result, you can see the auction at the other table.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6&5 it would be in golf but they are not allowed to concede here|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has shown length in both red suits, so declarer can expect him to be short in clubs.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Two boards fewer per session because the players have requested longer breaks between sessions. They were very short with the schedule we had yesterday|pg||

nt|psridhar: one point to note is -if your rho waited for u to  sign off in 3d before balancing -instead of directly acting over 3c- u can infer he needed the comfort of your 3d sign off-|pg||

nt|bigtrain: there wasn't a 3@C preempt thus hamman didn't suspect the short @C in N|pg||

nt|diumraid: ******  LIVE IN RUNNING ****** BUFFETT CUP ******   USA  40 -  EUR 20  ******  Last Round of the Day.  Teams tomorrow with another 72 points at stake. ******|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rv: this is akin to sudden-death in soccer penalty shoot-out or bowl-out in T20 cricket|pg||

nt|mrdct: so the match is all down to board 12|pg||
mb|1C|nt|brolucius: A sympathetic kibitzer tells me that Auken's take-out double was 'shocking!'|pg||
nt|mrdct: @S lead needed to beat 4@H|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Restart in 45 minutes|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pelu: 4@h = -ø1 but 4@s will make|pg||
nt|mrdct: and 4@s is cold|pg||
mb|3S|nt|brolucius: von Arnim bids 3@H (with the four-card support) even at this vulnerability. Fair enough.|pg||
nt|mrdct: so 5@h could work, but @s lead will take it for 500 so the vul vs not save not working today|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S it will be I predict|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I have been wrong before|pg||
nt|mrdct: auken will do best to pass here and possible defend 3@s|pg||
nt|pelu: a u sure :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Auken can see a lot of losers in the side suits. The four trumps from partner will not help her very much.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I made an error in 1982 as Peter can confirm|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But not today|pg||
pc|hT|nt|brolucius: In 1982 BBO was just a twinkle in someone's eye.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu: close to 6-6 here|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mrdct: had fred started playing bridge then?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: A heart lead and a diamond return may do well.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|brolucius: But South does not have an entry. |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 12-0  10-2  8-4   still possible results, depending on what happens on board 12 in the closed room|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Let's go there and watch|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|andyv:  good result in OR|pg||
nt|rv: only advantage for bridge players is we don't play barometric scoring and they don't know result|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|rv: yes great result by Zia-Hamman in OR, tough for Fantunes to replicate|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is instructive that South at both tables went all the way to 3@H (following the Law of Total Trumps: 5+4 = 9, so contract for 9 tricks) even though they were vulnerable against ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: not. Something to remember.|pg||
