nt|flash: win, a tie and a loss.  ANY DIFFERENCE in the score, no matter how small, decides the Board.  We'll have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
mb|2H|an|transfer|mb|d|nt|jan_jansma: hi all|pg||
nt|flash: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints:  every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the Board.  |pg||
nt|flash: welcome to Jan Jansma|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: thx :)|pg||
nt|flash: E-W play xfers and 2-suited calls over the 1NT opening|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d|mb|3H|nt|flash: this is still a relatively new partnership|pg||
mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: Not that Sontag will pass with his void :)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: fantoni would double at imps for sure, here he has to worry can i beat this 4 if 3nt making|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Most Italian doubles are for TO, but after doubling twice already.....|pg||
nt|flash: can anyone catch me up on the current score?  (i missed the last round)|pg||

nt|flash: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|flash: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual.  With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||

nt|chick: This is the most tense form of bridge, because even a tiny mistake can make the difference in a full win or loss of the board point|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rv: of Weinstein doesn't know the result in OR and is trying his best to make the best of a inferior contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think he must have had the same thoughtas 3 commentators|pg||
nt|rv: most bridge events is not palyed in Barometric style of scoring, hence players don't know result till they play all deals in a session/round/segment|pg||

nt|spooky: I played board a match once, and it's really fun, but you have no idea what they do at the other table, because everybody is trying to score the point every board..|pg||
nt|rv: yes Hop, this form of scoring is most definitely bleeding-edge, a bit tougher than even MPs where field does protect you to some extent|pg||

nt|rv: second seat pre-empts are generally sound, but at these colors could be shaded|pg||
nt|rv: if 3@d red in second seat, I would bid 3n|pg||
nt|drewsky: The biggest reason to bid 3NT is that the opponents mught compete in hearts|pg||
nt|rv: at these colors, I will consider a pass|pg||
nt|ady: you lack quick tricks out side diamonds     even if there is sokid diamonds oppsoite   KQJ etc   it seems either a club or heart trick will leave you 1 short|pg||
nt|drewsky: The opponents are cold for 5@C....don't make it easy for them to get there|pg||
nt|ady: club or heart lead |pg||
nt|rv: Fantunes rate to take this atleast 2 down at this stage of play, so Europe may not lose on this board|pg||
nt|ady: thats different if you are bidding to keep them out|pg||
nt|rv: in my experience of watching top level Vu graph, Fantunes are exceptionally good defenders even amongst the elite|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: Fantunes play reverse Smith |pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: this was just always going off in the real world |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yes, no chance now. Needed to find a double-dummy line of playing trumps (leading high ones from hand to pin East's 9) to keep trump losers to one|pg||

nt|rv: 2@h is woolsey showing 5@h+4+m|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: For those who have just tuned in. Number of boards in the Teams has been cut down from 14 to 12 per session as the players have requested longer breaks. Start times unchanged |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|spooky: A good result for USA here, on the closed room they bid this thin game|pg||

nt|haans: when you want to bid but have nothing to bid Pass only choice|pg||

nt|vugraphzrh: its a dull overcast day here in South Wales|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|hedyg: or Multilandy :)|pg||
nt|rv: a slightly dangerous action at these colors and Levin may balance with a double|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mamos: defence has  secured a trick in each suit now|pg||
nt|rv: much needed board for US in this match|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: the singleton J@C did it|pg||
nt|chick: I was in Wales once, and my general impression was "if you don't like the weather, wait 5 minutes, it will change"  :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|mamos: needed to make sure of a Diamond trick  before the Hearts got going|pg||
nt|rv: another push board?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not much to play long dim takes care of spade|pg||
nt|spooky: still needs to find teh @HQ, but don't see a reason to missguess it|pg||
nt|rv: yes, I presume Brogeland will play with the odds and drop @HQ|pg||
nt|rv: only consolation for Fantoni is that he would have lost the board even if he had passed 1n since his counterparts reached 3n 1 down in OR|pg||
nt|rv: he was in lose-lose situation though he didn't know it|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
nt|rv: can defense take it 3 down for 800, I suspect 500 is the limit|pg||
nt|rv: don't think Fantoni can escape for 200?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: would be eccentric to do otherwise with no information from the bidding|pg||

nt|rv: :)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

nt|rv: rounds|pg||
nt|rv: starting time for all rounds as published|pg||

nt|lestergold: weinstein has given Brogeland chance for overtrick but its a sort of grosvenor|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rv: since @ds are 3-3, the play of @h suit will determine the destination of BAM point on this deal|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|chick: this is a guess, but with S bidding, she will most likely play him for the A|pg||

nt|pelu: same contract in OR - but X there|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|rv: this will get cracked|pg||

nt|rv: Brogeland competing at these colors must have decent values|pg||

nt|lestergold: what??|pg||
nt|spooky: no double surprising|pg||
nt|rv: looks like N-S forgot to double E-W in 5@s in OR|pg||
nt|drewsky: The problem for N-S is that north cannot make a forcing pass, therefore his double shows 'cards' and south must use his judgement. The double is not penalty|pg||
nt|ady: might go down 2|pg||
nt|rv: yes I agree drew, could either of them more likely Weinstein bid 4n?|pg||

nt|rv: enough @s have been discarded as well?|pg||
nt|lestergold: he kn ows that east does not know who has J@d so he must be holding on to the guarded K@c|pg||
nt|haans: why no spade play?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: a @D was S's only hope, since the 7 is big enough to prevent a 3th diamond trick for declarer|pg||

nt|pelu: now eun @c7|pg||

nt|chick: super play by von Arnim|pg||
mb|1D|nt|scotty: card for card the same as Zia|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: but Europe seem to have good scores for sure|pg||
nt|rv: this form of scoring (BAM) ensures most of boards are interesting|pg||
nt|rv: much better than IMPs|pg||
nt|spooky: BAM makes boards more exciting, every 10 points are important, so it takes more energy, so you are totally tired at the end of the day|pg||
nt|lestergold: really shows what the p[layers are made of gives them an opportunity to display their gifts for the game|pg||
nt|rv: 11 tricks for N-S hardly straight forward here|pg||
nt|spooky: is East thinking?|pg||
nt|rv: I expect Europe to hit back on this board, I can't see Bobby Levin making 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|lestergold: trying to guess how 11 tricks were made in open room|pg||
nt|rv: Eruope needs to win 1 or draw 2 out of 3 remaining brds to get 4 BPs in this match|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d= 14 + f1|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|hedyg: 2@D= i dont want to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: double is responsive showing other 2 suits|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|pelu: wow - also "easy" with @CK in S :)|pg||
nt|haans: key1809: easy 6d :) ME: rite u r|pg||
nt|scotty: This is a fortunate contract - you find the @cK onside (and jack too, in case you might misguess), clubs 3-3 and trumps 3-2|pg||
nt|haans: grossly outbid|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D in OR|pg||
nt|scotty: You might have a chance to make if N had, say @cKx.  You could ruff 2 spades AND set up the fifth club|pg||
nt|haans: OR may need an opening bid to open|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|rv: Fantoni's pass of 3@c was forcing after XX|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d did not show all he had already?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: EW can beat this|pg||
nt|rv: Hedy, they are in forcing auction after redouble, I presume Fantoni could have more than what he has|pg||
nt|hedyg: well then why not double 3@C?|pg||
nt|rv: you have to ask that question to Nunes:)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|spooky: they reached the same ontract here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d= 4+ cards so already 2@d showed 4 cards imo|pg||
nt|drewsky: It is alot easier to double 3@C when you see all the hands....|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure it is but to bid those Jxx twice......|pg||
nt|ady: this is not clear cut   |pg||
pc|c8|nt|mamos: and this is the route|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|rv: it is breaking partnership trust for Nunes to pass if redouble sets up force till 3@d|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mamos: well done|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rv: re all|pg||
nt|rv: looks like Brogeland has avoided dreaded @d lead|pg||
nt|spooky: but it's not over yet.|pg||
nt|rv: best defense here is win @hk and back @H?|pg||
nt|rv: even if he ducks this, I can't see declarer coming to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: declarer may score 1 more trick on endplay on West, but he will still be a trick short for 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|rv: his only options were to double 3@c or bid 3@d, he couldn't pass|pg||
nt|drewsky: Agree he cannot pass, but perhaps his first call of 2@D got him into this predicament|pg||
nt|hedyg: quite so Drew|pg||
nt|rv: maybe he was regretting his original bid of 2@d as suggested by Drew|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good bid and nicely played. |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|rv: if Brogeland win this, there will be no end-play but 3 @h tricks for decl, if he ducks only 2@h tricks but endplay will fetch an extra trick, in either case only 10 tricks in my ...|pg||
nt|rv: book|pg||
nt|ady: declarer knows north has length in the majors  but may forced to take a good view in hearts  as he needs the extra entry to play spades|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** BUFFETT CUP IN RUNNING Currently USA 60  EUR 48**** - Last set for today in progress|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|mamos: the hghly favourable Club position meant the defence had to secure a @club ruff|pg||
nt|drewsky: He also was very unlucky that both north AND south were BOTH speeding here in the bidding|pg||

mb|2S|nt|rv: Europe assured of 2 BPs here, they just need to tie one of the last 2 boards to get all 4 BPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: USA won Match A and got 4 BPs|pg||

mb|4D|nt|rv: great fightback by Europe this morning, they have recovered from 20-40 down at the end of Pairs event on Day 1|pg||
nt|rv: re Roland, wlc back|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: S has a very powerful supporting hand, despite the shortage of HCP|pg||
nt|haans: BAM so 5@D no option|pg||
nt|scotty: As little as AKxx, x, Axxxx, Axx makes slam excellent - and partner must have more high cards than that|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not so fast, 4@H has chances|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Depends on the defence|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mamos: not sure what is happening I assume West transferred to Diamonds and East denied support and redbl re transfers|pg||

nt|hedyg: high from even with honour or odd without|pg||
nt|drewsky: Defense gets 3 chances to beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Zia led @C6 and it took ages for Hamman to follow small|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he inserts the 10, it can make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or the king for that matter if he thought Zia had underled the ace|pg||
nt|drewsky: lead a @D, shift to a @D when declarer ducks a spade|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: In the other room, Duboin opened 1@C in 3rd seat and got a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not so good for Europe|pg||
nt|rv: 3@h by Brogeland is direction asking, East could have XXed with Ace? maybe he wanted slow down the auction with min for GF|pg||
nt|rv: @H lead will win this brd for US|pg||
nt|spooky: why wouldn't he lead a @H now?|pg||

nt|rv: if Weinstein leads a @h as expected, US can't lose this board|pg||
nt|rv: can't lose this match|pg||
nt|drewsky: Its a question of which heart to lead|pg||
nt|Walddk5: True, 26 is the last board|pg||
nt|hedyg: no K@H!|pg||
nt|rv: did he actually throw @HK?|pg||
nt|scotty: Played by N, slam is excellent, since you have time to see if trumps are 2-2 (in which case you can discard all dummy's major losers.  When trumps break 3-1, you can fall back on ...|pg||
nt|scotty: the spade finesse|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@D at all 6 tables! wd|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and can make 7. Am I right?|pg||
nt|scotty: Interestingly, you can take the spade finesse either way - the spots allow for a ruffing finesse.  But with West having the stiff @d, you would play her for it|pg||
nt|haans: miust have been a hearts lead at OR|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with @S finesse, I have seen the cards please.|pg||

pc|c9|nt|mamos: despite all those lovely Eastern tenaces this doesnt appear to be  anything like a make|pg||
