nt|haans: This is Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, may  decides the board. |pg||

mb|1S|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Rashed|pg||

nt|haans: Sucken have no good bid|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mamos: just us talking to ourselves :)|pg||
nt|haans: Aucken|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Cornelia and Haans.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: they have landed right|pg||
nt|chick: nice choice by Auken ... with N showing 4 hearts, she chooses to show the diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: von Arnom knows only 40 hcp exist but ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Tricky hand and difficult for W to pass 2@D.|pg||
nt|haans: Arnim|pg||
mb|3C|nt|haans: simple clubs raise?|pg||
nt|haans: pass a good option|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|chick: N has pretty much described his hand, except for about an A worth of value, but with his partner passing 2@D, I don't think he has much left to say|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: This is Board-A-Match (BAM or Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, may  decides the ...|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 3 hearts is plenty here|pg||
mb|4C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|haans: Hi Victor|pg||
nt|haans: all cards wrong :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if defence is accurate then 3 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: not a lot of specs .. i think I have enough biscuits to go around everyone, in fact|pg||
nt|spooky: Good afternoon all|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: Hi Hans|pg||
pc|hT|nt|daman: just a @S p/s for NS?   East took one too many bids|pg||
nt|mamos: yep looks like -300|pg||
nt|daman: difficult to understand whay he would bid 4@C|pg||
nt|daman: siff @S and Qxx of @D is better|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: yep|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|spooky: 3NT looks like making, only a @C lead from south would set it.|pg||
nt|daman: t*|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: well you cant really find yourself in a room where 'dud' players are in action ... as this event features 24 of the world's very best|pg||
nt|mamos: are we linked to the correct table ?|pg||
nt|mamos: i thought the twins were always scoring agianst Levin and Weinstein|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: other room looks to have started with a precision 2@C, and someohow they couldnt put the brakes on before reaching a hopelessly optimistic 6C|pg||
nt|spooky: but Brogeland took his "safe"plus scoe in 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: but non vulnerable :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|spooky: 5@D bid and made at the other table, so first board goes to USA|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Operator, EW are from Norway, not Sweden|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I think they will appreciate Norway flags :)|pg||
nt|rv: good recovery by Europe in last segement, they have picked up 16 Buffet points to only 8 for US, reduced lead by 12|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi all|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C+1@H+2@S=6 -3 I think.|pg||
nt|mamos: Heart lead is best start for defence as South hoping to get trump promotion |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|irwinbo: easy push now|pg||

nt|daman: or just a simple ruff|pg||

nt|othered1: And,  having seen the @CJ, north is trying to find a defense against the vul game.  I can't see any that would appeal to me.  Maybe a h opeless 11 count   |pg||
nt|othered1: Jxxx, AQxxx, K, Jxx?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer happy to lose finesses to North who can't play spades|pg||
nt|othered1: and doesn't have a third @C|pg||

nt|chick: hopefully we'll find out the end result of that board when the operator has time to put it in :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: technical problems - contract is 4S by NS |pg||
nt|haans: If Levin had bid 3@C von Arnim odds to bid 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: new board now|pg||
nt|mamos: just too much from Justin there|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|daman: bidding 4@C on that hand is like found money for the opps     getting something for nothing|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|haans: 6@C possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rv: transfer responses here, 1@h shows 4+@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|ady: 4@H can be beateb on spade lead|pg||
nt|drewsky: ONLY if played by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or 6@H|pg||
nt|mamos: although  Americans are in 4@C x at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Brogeland's 1@s denies 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: 1@S shows 3@S|pg||
nt|rv: with 4 he would have jumped to 2@s and with 2 would have rebid 1n or 2m|pg||
pc|d5|nt|spooky: weird that Brogeland didn't open 1NT, they play 15-17...|pg||
nt|rv: Levin-Weinstein compared with Duboin-Sementa and Brogeland-Saelensmide with Sontag-Berk|pg||
nt|rv: play of @h suit critical for OT in this contract|pg||
nt|ady: Europe should win the board 5@C  at least down 2|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D Bourke = just GF bid|pg||
nt|daman: Berkowicz|pg||
pc|d3|nt|spooky: it's about the overtrick in this lay out|pg||
nt|mamos: the scoring method has led to many NT contracts  as players hunt for the magic +10 points|pg||
nt|daman: easy to figure this 3rd and 5th|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: holy ... 2nt natural?|pg||
nt|chick: looks like just one diamond loser, and perhaps a heart loser|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sound 4@S with @H guess can make 6.|pg||
nt|haans: odds against doing right in hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true. 10 @H very vital card.|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|daman: Berk made the same bad 4@C bid|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rv: I presume Levin will duck @h to @hK smoothyl|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|rv: smoothly|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|kiwi_joker: unless South is very much asleep when declarer plays a heart from dummy later on, this will go -1|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|spooky: this helps declarer|pg||
nt|rv: after South's @H9, Brogeland may just get it right|pg||
nt|rv: ah, easy now for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Pairs, Teams and Individual events in Warren Buffet Cup, all scoring is BAM style|pg||
nt|rv: so OTs and UTs very crucial, this form of scoring is lot tougher than IMPs and a bit tougher than Pairs (MPs)|pg||
nt|rv: if you make 8 tricks in 2@s and your opps make same 8 tricks in NT, you get 0 BAM points|pg||
nt|haans: 54% for this slam|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event. Have a look|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer will have to sniff out Heart position for a good score|pg||
nt|daman: he will sniff it out by default|pg||
nt|daman: he will not risk his contract   and in so doing will drop the @H King|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That would be +2 and good score.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rv: in Pairs (MPs), the field does protect you a bit|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Haans and every one|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: would have been interesting if KH played on 10H|pg||
nt|mamos: Sontag and Berkowicz in 4@H so looks irrelevant how many tricks   he makes here|pg||

pc|c8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|daman: 4@H has the same guess as overtricks in 2NT|pg||
pc|c9|nt|westjava: 6-3 fit,drop I think|pg||

nt|hedyg: great defense|pg||
nt|rv: if any team gets to 6.5 BAM points, they are assured of 4 BPs|pg||
nt|hedyg: and play stops?|pg||
nt|rv: commentator's curse did not affect them on that deal:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|westjava: why not @S to K first?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: sorry about loss of service ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: 2@Sx - 1 = good MP|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kiwi_joker: undo, operator|pg||
nt|rv: no play continues till they play all deals, they don't know score till the end of the match|pg||
nt|rv: no barometric score for players in this tourney|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H?|pg||
nt|rv: only kibitzers and commentators have that luxury|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: P    P    X?|pg||
nt|hedyg: other table went to 3NT on a strong @c opening by S|pg||
nt|rv: 2@h is woolsey showing 5@h+4+m|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: For those who have just tuned in. Number of boards in the Teams has been cut down from 14 to 12 per session as the players have requested longer breaks. Start times unchanged |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: hard to understand that 2@H|pg||
nt|westjava: drop is drp, he said:)|pg||
nt|westjava: *drop|pg||
nt|haans: yeah get the point|pg||
pc|s4|nt|spooky: A good result for USA here, on the closed room they bid this thin game|pg||
nt|rv: we are at half-way stage of this match, 6 more boards to be played|pg||
pc|sT|nt|chick: perfect spot|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and good pass by S at these colours.|pg||
nt|haans: when you want to bid but have nothing to bid Pass only choice|pg||
nt|chick: but makes for boring commentary :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: its a dull overcast day here in South Wales|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|hedyg: or Multilandy :)|pg||
nt|rv: a slightly dangerous action at these colors and Levin may balance with a double|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: levin apologises for passing gf |pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|mamos: nine tricks in OR looks a good score|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: defence has  secured a trick in each suit now|pg||
nt|rv: much needed board for US in this match|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: the singleton J@C did it|pg||
nt|chick: I was in Wales once, and my general impression was "if you don't like the weather, wait 5 minutes, it will change"  :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mamos: needed to make sure of a Diamond trick  before the Hearts got going|pg||
nt|rv: another push board?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not much to play long dim takes care of spade|pg||
nt|spooky: still needs to find teh @HQ, but don't see a reason to missguess it|pg||
nt|rv: yes, I presume Brogeland will play with the odds and drop @HQ|pg||
nt|rv: only consolation for Fantoni is that he would have lost the board even if he had passed 1n since his counterparts reached 3n 1 down in OR|pg||
nt|rv: he was in lose-lose situation though he didn't know it|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
nt|rv: can defense take it 3 down for 800, I suspect 500 is the limit|pg||
nt|rv: don't think Fantoni can escape for 200?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|westjava: 6 cards of @H and 6 point, do you bid 2@H, Victor?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: would be eccentric to do otherwise with no information from the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Drew Casen|pg||
nt|drewsky: Good morning, Bridge World :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: sort of thimng u do when you are desperate for a swing|pg||
nt|spooky: Good afternoon Drew :)|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Drew, gm|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Drew|pg||
nt|rv: evening here in India though|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rv: likely result is 500 for N-S after @SA, @s ruff, 2@ds, @CA and 2 more @hs?|pg||
nt|hedyg: likely slow result you mean?|pg||
nt|rv: :)|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Simon|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rv: this result is good for neutrals, 4-3 in favor of Europe, close match is much more exciting for all kibitzers|pg||
nt|rv: to all folks who are just getting tuned into this event, no of boards in all matches reduced to 12 from 14 on account from all players to have more time for breaks in between ...|pg||
nt|rv: rounds|pg||
nt|rv: starting time for all rounds as published|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure we would like to tell Fantoni that he has lost the board irrespective of what he does from hereon in this deal:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: you may be confused with Ireland ....|pg||
nt|chick: hahahaaa|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mamos: so far Jason has avoided giving away a trick in Diamonds|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|haans: Weinstein can count|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rv: the play of this suit is not critical|pg||
nt|lestergold: weinstein has given Brogeland chance for overtrick but its a sort of grosvenor|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rv: since @ds are 3-3, the play of @h suit will determine the destination of BAM point on this deal|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d4|pc|c2|nt|hedyg: he lost the board as soon as Levin passed 1NT anyhow|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mamos: ouch|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d8|nt|rv: wd|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|haans: take @D as soon as possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In OR small @D was the lead.|pg||
nt|daman: @C now?|pg||
nt|daman: East will have to overtake to play a @D|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|pelu: but still 1-0 for Europe|pg||
nt|chick: this is a guess, but with S bidding, she will most likely play him for the A|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|rv: of course Weinstein was dicing with losing the point by playing a second @s, if Brogeland had ran it to @SQ he would have got full point|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: ! :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: A@H before @d was better|pg||
nt|haans: Weinstein did best by not playing @DA|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rv: as they say, Grosvenor always works|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: he would be risking a game, which was not obvious to bid...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: my philosophy is over 2 clubs to bid as high as possibe so defintely |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: well  East though he'd put declarer to the test by leading a smal club  but North had an easy choice and thats definitely a two foot putt missed by the Europeans|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i said it was a grovenor Weisntein must have known that it could have cost a trick|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: 6-12 with S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s= (9)10-13 unbalanced|pg||
nt|rv: 2@s is 10-12 or tartan in 3rd seat?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: no tartan openings|pg||
nt|rv: even in 3rd seat?|pg||
nt|hedyg: in 3rd can be weaker still|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|ady: can level the board with double?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rv: thanks|pg||
nt|chick: if Levin bids hearts, it will keep EW out of a dangerous 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 2@h shows majors just @hs?|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty|pg||
nt|mamos: NS seem to have a score which is unbeatable again  |pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: safe to play club so dont really understand the play|pg||
nt|spooky: looks like majors|pg||
nt|rv: looks like both majors (possibly DONT convention)|pg||
nt|rv: Brogeland's double of 2@s should be weak t/o here|pg||
nt|rv: he had passed 1n originally|pg||
nt|daman: should be a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Saelensminde thinking of passing this with all major values/length|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: this one won't make|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nope|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: dummy was all that weinstein could reasonably expect. But he needed clubs to run for 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: it will be interesting to see if this auction is duplicated at other tables|pg||
nt|mamos: South has no room to manouevre|pg||
nt|rv: anyone for 4n by Levin or Weinstein?|pg||
nt|pelu: same contract in OR - but X there|pg||
nt|chick: The 2@SX-1 on bd 20 was a push|pg||
nt|chick: This cannot make, so X will win the board|pg||
nt|haans: OR North played 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: yep|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: no actual bidding ..|pg||
nt|daman: endplayed on opening lead|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rv: this will get cracked|pg||
nt|lestergold: understandable at these colours even cracked it gains if only 1 off|pg||
nt|rv: Brogeland competing at these colors must have decent values|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: what??|pg||
nt|spooky: no double surprising|pg||
nt|rv: looks like N-S forgot to double E-W in 5@s in OR|pg||
nt|drewsky: The problem for N-S is that north cannot make a forcing pass, therefore his double shows 'cards' and south must use his judgement. The double is not penalty|pg||
nt|ady: might go down 2|pg||
nt|rv: yes I agree drew, could either of them more likely Weinstein bid 4n?|pg||
nt|haans: part scores gold in BAM |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: world champs allowing themselves to be robbed|pg||
nt|rv: can't believe that, distinct lack of trust in partner?|pg||
nt|spooky: this will be a win to USA|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: Match A US +1, Match C Europe +! and here exp 4-4|pg||
nt|daman: best lead for the D|pg||
nt|daman: and now an early coup|pg||
pc|sT|nt|drewsky: SImple principal: Partner has balanced and pushed the opponents up one level, so why double and punish him ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: encroyable|pg||
nt|pelu: C = +1 for EU|pg||
pc|sK|nt|westjava: this is USA board, 3nt cant -5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: part of the problem with this form of scoring is that if the result is known from the other room the hand becomes irrelevant sometimes|pg||
nt|haans: yep minus for kibs |pg||
nt|westjava: like this hand:)|pg||
nt|haans: TD should be allowed to tell skip this board you win/lose|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however for purists we can still watch for good technique in bidding play and defence|pg||
nt|westjava: from the top players in the world!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|daman: do we have a running score?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|spooky: Drew it's Board a Match, everything is needed to get a win|pg||
nt|rv: in this forming of scoring, pass is really strange, at IMPs I can live with pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: because 50/100 not enuf at point aboard |pg||
nt|lestergold: at imps pass  is fine|pg||
nt|spooky: is it never 300 if you have AK AK in majors? :)|pg||
nt|rv: passing is being too wimpy in my opinion|pg||
nt|drewsky: Well, if they were vulberable, I can see trying for 200 instead of 100, but there is not as much value in trying for 100 over 50.|pg||
nt|lestergold: you cannot pass when your partner has shown some values u have ak ak k and they are at 3 level and knope at these colours they rae bound to be taking the mickey|pg||
nt|rv: more interesting question, could defense have taken 6 tricks here?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kiwi_joker: I must run, see you next time|pg||
mc|11|nt|lestergold: no but it may well be 2 off and then you definitely make more than 100 ur way and u must get 300 to compensate|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|rv: OT in OR could be crucial, declarer took a risk of going down when he took @c finesse|pg||

nt|haans: easy win|pg||
nt|westjava: good stop|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@S and 1@H losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 3NT   would have made methinks and 4@S probably wont|pg||

nt|chick: Even with the bad diamond split, this looks to make, maybe even an overtrick|pg||

nt|chick: cover the @D10, draw trump, knock out the @DJ and later try an endplay in the black suits|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: NS have to be careful|pg||

nt|rv: this form of scoring (BAM) ensures most of boards are interesting|pg||
nt|rv: much better than IMPs|pg||
nt|spooky: BAM makes boards more exciting, every 10 points are important, so it takes more energy, so you are totally tired at the end of the day|pg||

nt|pelu: 5@D in OR|pg||
nt|scotty: You might have a chance to make if N had, say @cKx.  You could ruff 2 spades AND set up the fifth club|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: no problem now|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv: his only options were to double 3@c or bid 3@d, he couldn't pass|pg||
nt|drewsky: Agree he cannot pass, but perhaps his first call of 2@D got him into this predicament|pg||
nt|hedyg: quite so Drew|pg||

nt|rmb1: (Robin from OR).  In OR South switched to a club a trick two, still +1|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: A better percentage slam here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slam time.|pg||
nt|haans: only 12 boards RIGHT?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|westjava: diamonds are forever for this set|pg||
mb|2H|nt|westjava: yup|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is a dangerous board|pg||
nt|ady: not the way I tht this would be flat   what was the matter with Q@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Europe assured of 2 BPs here, they just need to tie one of the last 2 boards to get all 4 BPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: USA won Match A and got 4 BPs|pg||
nt|rv: Levin needs to pass 3@h to keep match alive|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rv: great fightback by Europe this morning, they have recovered from 20-40 down at the end of Pairs event on Day 1|pg||
nt|rv: re Roland, wlc back|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT 14-16|pg||
nt|mamos: well passing that will win the board as it happens|pg||
pc|d4|nt|scotty: S has a very powerful supporting hand, despite the shortage of HCP|pg||
nt|haans: BAM so 5@D no option|pg||
nt|scotty: As little as AKxx, x, Axxxx, Axx makes slam excellent - and partner must have more high cards than that|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not so fast, 4@H has chances|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Depends on the defence|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos: not sure what is happening I assume West transferred to Diamonds and East denied support and redbl re transfers|pg||
nt|mamos: we'll find out if East agrees|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rv: here 3@d by East shows @d fit and GF|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|diumraid: BUFFETT CUP IN RUNNING Currently USA 44  EUR 40 -  with 2 brds remaining|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|rv: I presume with weaker hand, Saelensminde would have gone via 2n |pg||
nt|ady: hi    looks that way|pg||
nt|hedyg: high from even with honour or odd without|pg||
nt|drewsky: Defense gets 3 chances to beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Zia led @C6 and it took ages for Hamman to follow small|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he inserts the 10, it can make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or the king for that matter if he thought Zia had underled the ace|pg||
nt|drewsky: lead a @D, shift to a @D when declarer ducks a spade|pg||
nt|petergill: Just 12 boards - USA needs to win both boards to tie the match|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt was interesting in OR|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: seems a bit pushy|pg||
nt|daman: this should be -1|pg||
nt|daman: if they take their @Cs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: sorry -2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: In the other room, Duboin opened 1@C in 3rd seat and got a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not so good for Europe|pg||
nt|rv: 3@h by Brogeland is direction asking, East could have XXed with Ace? maybe he wanted slow down the auction with min for GF|pg||
nt|rv: @H lead will win this brd for US|pg||
nt|spooky: why wouldn't he lead a @H now?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It will get one after Levin's double|pg||
nt|rv: if Weinstein leads a @h as expected, US can't lose this board|pg||
nt|rv: can't lose this match|pg||
nt|drewsky: Its a question of which heart to lead|pg||
nt|Walddk5: True, 26 is the last board|pg||
nt|hedyg: no K@H!|pg||
nt|rv: did he actually throw @HK?|pg||
nt|scotty: Played by N, slam is excellent, since you have time to see if trumps are 2-2 (in which case you can discard all dummy's major losers.  When trumps break 3-1, you can fall back on ...|pg||
nt|scotty: the spade finesse|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@D at all 6 tables! wd|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and can make 7. Am I right?|pg||
nt|scotty: Interestingly, you can take the spade finesse either way - the spots allow for a ruffing finesse.  But with West having the stiff @d, you would play her for it|pg||
nt|haans: miust have been a hearts lead at OR|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with @S finesse, I have seen the cards please.|pg||
nt|chick: if they don't lead a heart :)|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This, however, is a normal line and will lead to down 1|pg||
nt|hedyg: no he didnt|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: despite all those lovely Eastern tenaces this doesnt appear to be  anything like a make|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|scotty: Declarer must consider whether he can pitch spades without touching trump and play on a cross ruff|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rv: We can safely conclude that Europe has won this one now:)|pg||
nt|ady: split board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: USA has won Match C|pg||
nt|ady: so Europe wins this srt|pg||
nt|ady: set|pg||
nt|rv: atleast 0.5 BAM points for Europe on this one, enough to get 4 BPs|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: so  8-4 to USA in this set|pg||
pc|h4|nt|odysseus69: the 4C bid made it easy for defence|pg||

pc|s3|nt|haans: Have been Europas day today|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|scotty: But I think this is the sensible line - and should win the board|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|scotty: I guess it's possible he might try the @sQ to the ace...|pg||
nt|scotty: If they don'yt cover, they don't have it?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|haans: Zia quote|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: The original plan for these stanzas was 14 boards  but a change has cut them to 12 so this is the penultimate hand|pg||

nt|scotty: I meant ends the result being an issue|pg||
nt|rmb1: South bid @C in OR so defence was even clearer|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: even on @c lead, inexplicable @h duck by Sementa in OR selling the contract|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 2&1 as they would say in golf|pg||
nt|westjava: 1 board lose, USA:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: so our last hand  thanks to Simon  our op and to the tourney organisers, thanks to fellow commentators earlier in the set |pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: tough to win this board for europe, |pg||
nt|Walddk5: But Michael believes in plating on|pg||
nt|Walddk5: *playing|pg||
nt|scotty: I do|pg||
nt|westjava: last board of this set|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2h - transfer|pg||
nt|petergill: Although Europe has won this match, they might be playing the last board, in case there is an scoring error.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk5: Europe must hope that N-S also get to 5@C here. Then they need to double to win the board|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: thanks to you all for being here nad helping with comments  three more stanzas today   the next in just under 40 minutes I believe|pg||
nt|rv: unless they double 5@c by L-W|pg||
nt|rv: I think German ladies doubled Meckwell in 5@c in another match|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They did|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and Fantunes stopped in 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk5: So the double did not matter|pg||
nt|westjava: next round will be held at 30 mnt from now|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mamos: thanks to BBO   i still think vugraph is great|pg||

mb|2H|mb|4H|nt|mamos: Sontag and Berkowitz were in the bidding here   -surprise that Jason passed in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|daman: this is the last board of this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: good making 3 in OR|pg||
nt|scotty: Pretty impressive pass by Nunes in the other room over 2@s - he needed very little for game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk5: OK, so USA wins this match. I make it  USA  46    Europe  38     after this set|pg||
nt|rv: Brogeland's pass of 1@h conservative in my opinion|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very interesting boards, was enjoyable.|pg||
nt|daman: a low @S lead would be deadly|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv: we have next session starting in 25 mins, 5 PM London time|pg||
nt|odysseus69: save vul against not never easy|pg||
nt|westjava: Ty Victor, Hans, Peter and all|pg||
nt|rmb1: Harder for North to lead @C|pg||
nt|haans: next sesson last team match|pg||
nt|westjava: also to Simon (operator)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can get club ruff- just noticed|pg||
nt|daman: but he might lead a trump|pg||
nt|mamos: trump gives nothing away|pg||
nt|daman: I suspect EW will win this board   +650 was a Huge result in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: looks like 3 obvious losers|pg||
nt|mamos: yes Three Aces :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mamos: North's 2@h is  an unusual choice i think  but it has had the effect of keeping EW out of the later auction|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C gazzilli 2@S pratically nothing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 0-4|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 1NT was 0-9|pg||
nt|haans: transfer did cost this time|pg||
nt|daman: however    a non @S lead is informative|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: and another great Us board|pg||
nt|mamos: bye|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Restart in 40 minutes|pg||
nt|daman: can pitch a @C on a @D if not areful|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The key to +1 is the @D play after this lead.|pg||
nt|rmb1: When in with D!A East tried a small spade, declarer got spades right and the finessed @DJ for three @D tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer does have quite alot of information all round here from the bidding or lack of it|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Aggregate score is now Europe 40 - USA 52|pg||
