mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|petergill: EW play Strong Club, NS play Four Card Majors|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2NT = good raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h8|nt|petergill: With the friendly lie, EW can make a lot of tricks in any of the other three suits. |pg||
nt|petergill: NS I mean|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d6|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|rmb1: As a consequence, declarer will struggle to make tricks outside hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: 11 tricks in @S, @C or @D for NS, as the cards lie, with every card onside and every suit breaking|pg||
nt|petergill: Minus 150 in 3@H for USA beats -170 or -200 in spades and flattens minor suit partscores making 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer need to play passively and South will be endplayed to play @D or @C himself|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Hello Cornelia and Haans.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: they have landed right|pg||
nt|chick: nice choice by Auken ... with N showing 4 hearts, she chooses to show the diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: von Arnom knows only 40 hcp exist but ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Tricky hand and difficult for W to pass 2@D.|pg||
nt|haans: Arnim|pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: simple clubs raise?|pg||
nt|haans: pass a good option|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|chick: N has pretty much described his hand, except for about an A worth of value, but with his partner passing 2@D, I don't think he has much left to say|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: This is Board-A-Match (BAM or Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, may  decides the ...|pg||

pc|h5|nt|odysseus69: Hi Hans|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: yep|pg||
pc|h7|nt|spooky: 3NT looks like making, only a @C lead from south would set it.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kiwi_joker: well you cant really find yourself in a room where 'dud' players are in action ... as this event features 24 of the world's very best|pg||
nt|mamos: are we linked to the correct table ?|pg||
nt|mamos: i thought the twins were always scoring agianst Levin and Weinstein|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: other room looks to have started with a precision 2@C, and someohow they couldnt put the brakes on before reaching a hopelessly optimistic 6C|pg||
nt|spooky: but Brogeland took his "safe"plus scoe in 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: but non vulnerable :)|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yep|pg||
nt|rmb1: USA lost this in the bidding :)|pg||
nt|petergill: USA lost the board also because hearts were friendly for the slam-bidding Europeans|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|rmb1: Normally 2S in this sequence is 4S+5C.  Perhaps 2C denies 4card M, in which case shortage responses make sense|pg||

nt|chick: hopefully we'll find out the end result of that board when the operator has time to put it in :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: technical problems - contract is 4S by NS |pg||
nt|haans: If Levin had bid 3@C von Arnim odds to bid 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: new board now|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|haans: 6@C possible|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rv: transfer responses here, 1@h shows 4+@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ady: 4@H can be beateb on spade lead|pg||
nt|drewsky: ONLY if played by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or 6@H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rv: Brogeland's 1@s denies 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: 1@S shows 3@S|pg||
nt|rv: with 4 he would have jumped to 2@s and with 2 would have rebid 1n or 2m|pg||
mb|3H|nt|spooky: weird that Brogeland didn't open 1NT, they play 15-17...|pg||
nt|rv: Levin-Weinstein compared with Duboin-Sementa and Brogeland-Saelensmide with Sontag-Berk|pg||
nt|rv: play of @h suit critical for OT in this contract|pg||
nt|ady: Europe should win the board 5@C  at least down 2|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D Bourke = just GF bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: it's about the overtrick in this lay out|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: holy ... 2nt natural?|pg||
nt|chick: looks like just one diamond loser, and perhaps a heart loser|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sound 4@S with @H guess can make 6.|pg||
nt|haans: odds against doing right in hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true. 10 @H very vital card.|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|rv: I presume Levin will duck @h to @hK smoothyl|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|rv: smoothly|pg||
mb|d|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: unless South is very much asleep when declarer plays a heart from dummy later on, this will go -1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|spooky: this helps declarer|pg||
nt|rv: after South's @H9, Brogeland may just get it right|pg||
nt|rv: ah, easy now for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Pairs, Teams and Individual events in Warren Buffet Cup, all scoring is BAM style|pg||
nt|rv: so OTs and UTs very crucial, this form of scoring is lot tougher than IMPs and a bit tougher than Pairs (MPs)|pg||
nt|rv: if you make 8 tricks in 2@s and your opps make same 8 tricks in NT, you get 0 BAM points|pg||
nt|haans: 54% for this slam|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rv: in Pairs (MPs), the field does protect you a bit|pg||

nt|petergill: North will reject all South's slan tries|pg||
mb|3D!|an|shortage|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|rmb1: 1S can be only 4 and can be canape with a longer minor if minimum.  |pg||

nt|vugraphzre: david thinking...|pg||

mb|d|nt|rmb1: Worried the auction will end at 3@S and pre-protecting|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: East was worried that NS were about to stop in 3@S, and that partner has at most two spades|pg||

nt|rmb1: Do you always lead a trump with 5 ?|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||

nt|rmb1: Defence likely to make 2 clubs and 1? diamond for -2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|petergill: so that @SA play by South could be costly, if NS here make one less trick than the other table|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h6|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|hJ|nt|petergill: The idea of @CK play is that North can discard spades on top clubs so that North can overruff spades, or perhaps even ruff out @SK|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|petergill: -2. Will either be flat, or a win for Europe|pg||

nt|irwinbo: surely a loss for the u.s. on 3|pg||
nt|haans: defensive mistake at other table?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|westjava: wlc back:)|pg||

nt|Walddk5: cards for the Individual and other information|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: a helpful start |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3nt looks the final resting place|pg||
mb|2N|nt|haans: only think wrong with slam here is lack of aces :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Borgeland might have converted plus to minus here|pg||
nt|spooky: he probably did|pg||
nt|spooky: 3@H was a preemptive raise, so 3NT bid is strange, probably Levin is wondering what's going on|pg||
nt|rv: only  7 tricks on double dummy defense, in reality I expect Brogeland to make 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|rv: if Weinstein had doubled which he could have, I am sure Levin will lead a minor|pg||
nt|spooky: if Levin leads a @S, and Brogeland plays spade back directly, Levin needs to switch @D|pg||
mb|3N|nt|odysseus69: and lack of fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: I expect Levin to get this right and win another point for US here|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: not a point, -1 is still a 0.5|pg||
nt|rv: yes sry even the board|pg||
nt|rv: @c lead would have fetched a point, on @s lead best case scenario for L-W to half the brd|pg||
nt|haans: assume 4@D first 4nt after = do not show @DA|pg||
nt|haans: yes that 2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: did Helness really bid canapé|pg||
nt|westjava: some thing like, after 2@C GF|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ady: with spades 3-3   and hearts 3-2  this looks like 12 tricks|pg||
nt|westjava: 10 tricks after @D lead|pg||
nt|haans: playing clubs to KQ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|westjava: 3@C, 3@D, 4@S|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|rv: if Brogeland runs the @h suit, Weinstein has enough opportunities to signal @ds|pg||

nt|spooky: oh,,,|pg||
nt|spooky: didn't expect that|pg||
nt|rv: can't be true|pg||
nt|rv: Weinstein has disc @s and played lo-hi in @hs, not sure if all this indicates @d preference to @cs|pg||
nt|rv: this is assuming Levin wins @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Mike Gold|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi venky and Roland|pg||
nt|spooky: he played spades 6-5 and @H 7-J, don't think there was suit preference somewhere, not sure tho|pg||
nt|spooky: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: and gernbrand |pg||
nt|rv: thinking aloud, would it helped Weinstein to play @Hj and @hx to indicate @d preference|pg||
nt|rv: not sure of their SP methods, many partnerships play smith-echo or rev smith-echo in nt contracts to indicate continuation of suit or shifts in obvious / non-obvious suits|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure Levin-Weinstein have detailed defensive agreements, this deal will test those agreements|pg||
nt|rv: he needs to win @SA though:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I see i have arrived at the kill point|pg||
nt|spooky: winning @SA is not the problem I think.. i think he is wondering what to switch|pg||
nt|rv: yes Mike, you can give your perspective on carding agreements|pg||

nt|odysseus69: better-cash heart|pg||

pc|hA|nt|haans: ½ a point|pg||

pc|d4|nt|westjava: this is USA board, 3nt cant -5|pg||

nt|spooky: is it never 300 if you have AK AK in majors? :)|pg||
nt|rv: passing is being too wimpy in my opinion|pg||
nt|drewsky: Well, if they were vulberable, I can see trying for 200 instead of 100, but there is not as much value in trying for 100 over 50.|pg||
nt|lestergold: you cannot pass when your partner has shown some values u have ak ak k and they are at 3 level and knope at these colours they rae bound to be taking the mickey|pg||

nt|rv: though we have Pairs, Teams and Individuals, all matches are scored on BAM format (1, 0.5, 0) converted to BPs at the end of 12 boards in a round|pg||

pc|c2|nt|rv: I presume with weaker hand, Saelensminde would have gone via 2n |pg||
nt|ady: hi    looks that way|pg||
nt|hedyg: high from even with honour or odd without|pg||
nt|drewsky: Defense gets 3 chances to beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Zia led @C6 and it took ages for Hamman to follow small|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he inserts the 10, it can make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or the king for that matter if he thought Zia had underled the ace|pg||
nt|drewsky: lead a @D, shift to a @D when declarer ducks a spade|pg||
nt|petergill: Just 12 boards - USA needs to win both boards to tie the match|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room, Duboin opened 1@C in 3rd seat and got a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not so good for Europe|pg||
nt|rv: 3@h by Brogeland is direction asking, East could have XXed with Ace? maybe he wanted slow down the auction with min for GF|pg||
nt|rv: @H lead will win this brd for US|pg||
nt|spooky: why wouldn't he lead a @H now?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It will get one after Levin's double|pg||
nt|rv: if Weinstein leads a @h as expected, US can't lose this board|pg||
nt|rv: can't lose this match|pg||
nt|drewsky: Its a question of which heart to lead|pg||
nt|Walddk5: True, 26 is the last board|pg||
nt|hedyg: no K@H!|pg||
nt|rv: did he actually throw @HK?|pg||
nt|scotty: Played by N, slam is excellent, since you have time to see if trumps are 2-2 (in which case you can discard all dummy's major losers.  When trumps break 3-1, you can fall back on ...|pg||
nt|scotty: the spade finesse|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@D at all 6 tables! wd|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and can make 7. Am I right?|pg||
nt|scotty: Interestingly, you can take the spade finesse either way - the spots allow for a ruffing finesse.  But with West having the stiff @d, you would play her for it|pg||
nt|haans: miust have been a hearts lead at OR|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with @S finesse, I have seen the cards please.|pg||
nt|chick: if they don't lead a heart :)|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** BUFFETT CUP IN RUNNING Currently USA 58  EUR 50**** - Last set for today in progress|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: This, however, is a normal line and will lead to down 1|pg||
nt|hedyg: no he didnt|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mamos: despite all those lovely Eastern tenaces this doesnt appear to be  anything like a make|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|scotty: Declarer must consider whether he can pitch spades without touching trump and play on a cross ruff|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rv: We can safely conclude that Europe has won this one now:)|pg||
nt|ady: split board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: USA has won Match C|pg||
nt|ady: so Europe wins this srt|pg||
nt|ady: set|pg||
nt|rv: atleast 0.5 BAM points for Europe on this one, enough to get 4 BPs|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: so  8-4 to USA in this set|pg||
pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: the 4C bid made it easy for defence|pg||

mb|2C!|an|spade support|mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|petergill: Nah, it went one down, whatever we recorded. I know how the Hacketts play. |pg||
nt|rv: can we request the operator to check the last board?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: No, the operator is banned from interrupting the players|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: yes sorry, it was down 1 according to 2 score cards|pg||
nt|petergill: BBO operators are not allowed to interrupt the players, so we have to wait. |pg||
nt|rv: can Jason find @c lead, too tough|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|rv: @c shift will be do nicely as well|pg||
nt|rmb1: @c switch ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: just keeping you on your toes :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: board adjusted|pg||
nt|rv: thanks Alan, required after a heavy lunch here:)|pg||
nt|petergill: @C switch looks likely|pg||
nt|petergill: @D is the alternative|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|petergill: or partner could have a singleton @H|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rv: @c shift more percentage, he needs either @DA or a @s card?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|s2|pg||
mc|10|nt|rv: not best defense by Justin in my opinion|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: thanks all|pg||
nt|rv: thanks all|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: match finished|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: room will stay open whilst the closed room finish off|pg||
nt|petergill: The EW bidding was not informative enough to make the club switch easy to find|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is that it.  Thanks all.  It been a blast|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: back shortly for the final teams match before the indiv starts|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: restart 1230 BST|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table in 4@D on the 5@D -50 should make the match closer |pg||
nt|petergill: 5-4 then Bd 10 was OK for USA - a @h lead by USA would win USA Bd 10|pg||
nt|petergill: so the other table is probably worth a visit - this match might be 5-5 with a board to go|pg||
nt|petergill: The other table is Bobby Levin and Steve Weinstein trying to tie or win the match for USA|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone|pg||

nt|scotty: I meant ends the result being an issue|pg||
nt|rmb1: South bid @C in OR so defence was even clearer|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rv: even on @c lead, inexplicable @h duck by Sementa in OR selling the contract|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 2&1 as they would say in golf|pg||
nt|westjava: 1 board lose, USA:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mamos: so our last hand  thanks to Simon  our op and to the tourney organisers, thanks to fellow commentators earlier in the set |pg||
mb|2H|nt|spooky: tough to win this board for europe, |pg||
nt|Walddk5: But Michael believes in plating on|pg||
nt|Walddk5: *playing|pg||
nt|scotty: I do|pg||
nt|westjava: last board of this set|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2h - transfer|pg||
nt|petergill: Although Europe has won this match, they might be playing the last board, in case there is an scoring error.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk5: Europe must hope that N-S also get to 5@C here. Then they need to double to win the board|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: thanks to you all for being here nad helping with comments  three more stanzas today   the next in just under 40 minutes I believe|pg||
nt|rv: unless they double 5@c by L-W|pg||
nt|rv: I think German ladies doubled Meckwell in 5@c in another match|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They did|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and Fantunes stopped in 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk5: So the double did not matter|pg||
nt|westjava: next round will be held at 30 mnt from now|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mamos: thanks to BBO   i still think vugraph is great|pg||
nt|haans: :) We'll meet again :) bye all|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|haans: good making 3 in OR|pg||
nt|scotty: Pretty impressive pass by Nunes in the other room over 2@s - he needed very little for game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk5: OK, so USA wins this match. I make it  USA  46    Europe  38     after this set|pg||
nt|rv: Brogeland's pass of 1@h conservative in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: we have next session starting in 25 mins, 5 PM London time|pg||
nt|odysseus69: save vul against not never easy|pg||
nt|westjava: Ty Victor, Hans, Peter and all|pg||
nt|rmb1: Harder for North to lead @C|pg||
nt|haans: next sesson last team match|pg||
nt|westjava: also to Simon (operator)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can get club ruff- just noticed|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mamos: North's 2@h is  an unusual choice i think  but it has had the effect of keeping EW out of the later auction|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C gazzilli 2@S pratically nothing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 0-4|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 1NT was 0-9|pg||
nt|haans: transfer did cost this time|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos: and another great Us board|pg||

nt|hedyg: both tables missed 3NT in NS|pg||
nt|rmb1: Played by East in OR.  @H lead and @D switch =|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rv: 92 out of 198 BPs decided, still enough to play in remaining 2.5 days of Teams and Individuals|pg||
nt|haans: rite :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that duck by Helgemo proved to be vital|pg||
