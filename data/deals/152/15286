mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3N only possible game and will survive evben a @d lead as north has no entries to the suit|pg||

pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: Virtually impossible|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: north has to overtake and switch but it doesnt beat it|pg||
nt|jacksond: but seems setting up his suit at trick 3 with no entry is pointless|pg||

nt|lestergold: last hand was too|pg||
nt|jacksond: switch to heart jack puts dec inder pressure. no?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not really|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is not going to overtake in order to lead a heart from KJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: it does but as the oplay also shows declarer where spade ace is he should prevail|pg||
nt|lestergold: North in tank|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, time has stopped - not a problem for anyone, I hope.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Then there is no danger|pg||
nt|jacksond: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: my money on declarer|pg||
nt|jacksond: yes. declarer just survives but more interesting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It took him a while to overtake, fine, but once he did he must have a plan|pg||
