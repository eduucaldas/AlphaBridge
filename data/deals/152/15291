nt|Walddk4: Welcome back, Tez|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|haans: right now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 1 strongish NT is certainly possible here, if your system allows it.  Mine doesn't with M 2-2.|pg||
nt|andersk: In Lithuania many probably play polish club, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: Results can be seen here  http://www.pzbs.pl//wyniki/turnieje/2010/wilno/team/teamleaderb.html|pg||
nt|ybob: yes polish|pg||

nt|othered1: EW now will have plenty of room to find their @H game|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rnmalik: 6@S makes imo.|pg||
nt|haans: but not 6@H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No:)|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like a transfer to @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: I think it wasnt|pg||
nt|othered1: There's a case for defending with south hand.  They have bid one of your long suits.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: would have expected North to do something, even if 1@d could be only three cards|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Rehi!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|haans: life is not fair|pg||
nt|othered1: Perhaps we should ask what 1@C implied|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: EW doing their best to push them to 6.|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no alert, but W looks angry|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: Sorry it was alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: short 1 trick i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: And it was a transfer to spades|pg||
nt|andersk: strange 2 NT, imo|pg||
nt|othered1: Very aggressive, if natural (unless it shows 17-18 or so)|pg||
nt|ybob: upgrade |pg||
nt|dburn: but it probably would not matter all that much what he did|pg||

pc|c5|nt|andersk: upgrade when you got a double behind you, still strange|pg||
nt|othered1: 8 tricks and needs help for a chance at 9|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe 1@H shows values too 7+ and E shows 18 hcp bal|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Privat|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andersk: I dont count as well as you, Ed!  I can only count 6 tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|haans: well not easy|pg||
nt|cicus: this will require a lot of work by declarer|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|haans: Hej Frank Rødal|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: 2 Aces and a K with N and pass. Otherwise difficult to visulise the hand with S.|pg||
nt|othered1: It's strong, I'm told, which explains the 2@C bid|pg||
nt|jacksond: 1c =11-13 balanced or any 17+|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, two-way club|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: 1 Club is 11-13 bal or 17+|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But strong when he bid 2@C|pg||
pc|h6|nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W had no good lead, without helping declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: A natural auction might let you out a level or two lower|pg||
nt|cicus: the lead help|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: some say never lead singel with singel trumph|pg||
nt|othered1: north shows his "entry" in @D?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h looks like 10 tricks and a save in 5@c looks correct|pg||
nt|othered1: I think it's take it or lose it in @D right now.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry 5@d - misclich - a bad keyboard|pg||
nt|ralfwil: look at this  - MISCLICK:)|pg||
nt|othered1: doesn't it look like @D underlead is the only likely way to beat it?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|rnmalik: absolutely correct.|pg||
nt|ybob: i think 2NT probably denies 3@S|pg||

nt|april7: weak 2 opener|pg||
nt|haans: re all|pg||
nt|ybob: can declarer have J @C and play A at trick 1 ?|pg||
nt|andersk: yes, If he is afraid a switch, but this time, no!|pg||
nt|othered1: Unlikely, and at matchpoints something on which to act,perhaps.  But it's nice to ensure you beat games at imps|pg||
nt|ybob: with JXXXX and JXX its impossible|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Tez|pg||
nt|othered1: does east open "any 11?"|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: Results here  http://www.pzbs.pl//wyniki/turnieje/2010/wilno/team/teamleaderb.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: and 4@S  probably by N going down on a @D lead|pg||

nt|jacksond: the other 1c  now |pg||
mb|1S|nt|tez: do you open 1nt versace's hand?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|suketbombi: Re Hi|pg||

nt|sybarra: and rehi Hans :) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|cicus: now I suggest X|pg||
nt|cicus: not easy, of course, 3@H might be the limit of the hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|april7: even by S after @H leadds and @D switch|pg||
nt|othered1: That vulnerable overcall feels dangerous to me.|pg||
nt|andersk: 1 NT is my kinda style:)|pg||
nt|ybob: i like X but ...|pg||
nt|othered1: it's 14+.  If within my range, certainly.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: For me an opening on S - yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Mike :)  welcome|pg||
nt|ybob: always with 4/4 M´s|pg||
nt|tez: if 1nt is 15-17 i prefer to open 1nt|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd upgrade if my 1N was 12-14|pg||
nt|othered1: But 3N should be bid using most methods.  NOrth's hand isn't exactly a distributed 10-count, it's an opening by old Culberston standards.|pg||
nt|tez: polish players mostly lead 2-4|pg||
nt|cicus: and if X then 3@H, what does it mean?|pg||
nt|haans: normal|pg||
nt|haans: forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: @D ace and J for @H shift|pg||
nt|h_karluk: owerwhelming defence|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice stop in a makable spot|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, I agree|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: thats better |pg||
nt|sybarra: assuming Q |pg||
nt|othered1: He'll go after @H tricks|pg||
nt|haans: but long way to 5@C so ...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: for beginners 3NT did show spades or he should not have bid Stayman|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|haans: double finesse in @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: why not take the @C hook? |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|haans: well can you see a better bid for Kartanas? :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|cicus: I don't think 5@C can be made|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: what am I missing |pg||
nt|haans: OT just falling|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe I played too loing with Aunt MInnie |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|haans: no hearts so ...|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe NS simply do not have a plus score available|pg||
nt|cicus: at a game level|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tez: take this trick and after it there is 2 way.First play @dT or A of @h|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: bobholl: was it canape or just inspired ME: good question no answer|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: not winning bridge stopping at part score|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think your Aunt Minnie had the right idea|pg||
nt|sybarra: of course she always played for 2/2,  (when the experts went down)  she cracked me up |pg||
nt|mdgraham: it is a safety play, of sorts, catering for @CK singleton offside|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree. |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn: less dangerous when East is a passed hand, and West's opening is very likely to be a weak no trump|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|haans: good play|pg||
nt|othered1: Wow, did Versace really not cover?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|tez: it was dangereous and really very interesting|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|haans: can end with endplaying South|pg||
nt|sybarra: Pszczola=Pepsi,  since no one can say his name  (or spell) |pg||
nt|andersk: the downside is to miss a Major fit, the upside is that you show strength, so If pard have enuff to invite or enuff to game, he will staymanbid, and you find the majors|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|s4|nt|cicus: hard to stop with 2 12-HCP hands, that's true|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|haans: re Taju|pg||
nt|haans: Raju|pg||
nt|suketbombi: re hi |pg||
nt|suketbombi: Taju is a nice name too:):)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rnmalik: Once I saw Staymen Convention misused against a NT-2@C, with a hand having 5+@C 3@D, 3@H and 2@S. P on 2 @C bid 2@H and 3NT by responder and now the opener bid 4@S and went to bid ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6. The lesson unless you have a major please dont use staymen.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: only good choices|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm more concerned with having my head handed to me than I"m missing a better partial, even though the latter is quite likely with this shape|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|h8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'll bet his bank can spell it - and the taxman|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: for english speaking folks,  there are 5 letters in his name that "do not go together "  (pszcz) |pg||
nt|cicus: but at pairs games should be better than at IMPs|pg||
mc|6|nt|haans: true|pg||

nt|dburn: perhaps it did, but the auction could have been at the three level by the time it came back, and he wasn't really worth 3@h|pg||

mb|1N|nt|h_karluk: what's up chief. we skipped?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: tough slam to bid, this|pg||
nt|cicus: slam on several finesses|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rnmalik: That 6 was makeable.|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: oh allright, so far so good|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, Shirley, you should never give up skiing|pg||
nt|sybarra: my knees suggested I do that |pg||
nt|haans: spades amust now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I don't care about the @H10xxx - 2@S for me|pg||
nt|othered1: This h as a much better play for slam than the last hand, given best opening lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks in @s as the cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Sorry a @S and a @D.:)|pg||
nt|dburn: if North can bid a forcing 3@h here, that might work|pg||
nt|othered1: No impossible, if south can rebid @H and get his @Csupport into the auction.  NOrth may be able to count tricks|pg||
nt|ybob: surely 2@C = GF |pg||
nt|othered1: But is it natural?|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure whether it's natural or a relay, though|pg||
nt|ybob: not necessary|pg||
nt|haans: 11 lokking for 12|pg||
nt|cicus: seems even 3 are not enough|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: get in early |pg||
nt|othered1: The seocndary fit is what makes slam excellent|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: been there done it :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzsc: Sorry we had internet problems |pg||
nt|othered1: double should help keep EW out of trouble|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: good bidding at both tables|pg||
nt|othered1: Bad showing for these methods|pg||
nt|othered1: short suit slam try.   West goes past game in honor of it, trumps notwithstanding|pg||
nt|tez: 2 nt shows 4 card @s and invitation+|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: do not agree with 3@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no worries please, it's ok, gl there:)|pg||
nt|haans: second part score winning points|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  since pard is passed hand,  I think you have true freedom |pg||
nt|dburn: well, not sure whether the methods were at fault or whether North could have bid more slowly|pg||
nt|othered1: Or south's judgment, if north was showing good @H, good @C|pg||
nt|andersk: looks to me that 2 @C is kinda GF, and 2 @H is minimum with 5 or 6 @H  I still would prefeer a quebid from north|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: 13 tricks?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|april7: just|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|ybob: if 2@C is GF N can wait with 2NT , maybe 2@H is neutral with only 5@H|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|dburn: what should North cue bid - his third-round spade control or his fourth-round diamond control?|pg||
nt|haans: missed first chance for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: can make 12 by pinning @S6 by running @S7|pg||
nt|haans: sure|pg||
nt|cicus: not entirely far-fetched on 2nd best @S8 lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|haans: @S2 = Lavinthal for clubs shift|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S 2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: other table on bd 3 balanced with west |pg||
nt|sybarra: landing in 4 @d |pg||
pc|dA|nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||

nt|haans: np :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: I got distracted for a momnet sorry for this|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: In any case, this is a slam you must bid and your methods should provide some way to investigate.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: No entrier to solve the @s that play from the top|pg||
nt|othered1: Too much to do to play north for @SQxx|pg||

pc|h8|nt|h_karluk: good deception try|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and it worked|pg||
nt|haans: Error?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: classically, with four hearts, this isn't a weak 2@s opener. But the spades are so good I couldn't bear to pass first time |pg||
nt|haans: Did Olanski give opps a cluibs?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: an odd sort of safety play if he did|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: Sorry there was an eeror in this deal|pg||
nt|haans: got it back|pg||
nt|sybarra: best to just give score then I think |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
mc|12|nt|suketbombi: not convinced that they stayed out of this slam knowing 2@H loosers good result here tho 13 tricks for taking|pg||

nt|ralfwil: my keyboard again entries...|pg||

mb|1D|nt|haans: rite boring deal|pg||

nt|ralfwil: sry private|pg||

nt|ralfwil: another slam. 6 or 7@s?|pg||
nt|tez: if west has JTXX u have no chance|pg||
nt|othered1: right and it ends up that the nice @H break compensates for the ugly break in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: A fine approach.  But one of those 2/1 auctions where you agree in the post mortem, but that's after the patient has expired.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: doubles hanging loose here :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think this auction wrong|pg||
nt|haans: got you :) but chicken out|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|sybarra: East is not finding this bidding fun |pg||
nt|othered1: 7@S is good enough to bid, I think, especially since you're confident they'll be in at least small slam in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: yes also admire the agression of E_W in other room to be in 6@H:)|pg||
nt|haans: again a Kartanas bidding scoring Gold|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N looks like just a "stall" to let partner bid out his hand, perhaps with @D support.|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|april7: loks like 4 @S and making by cross ruff, due to distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: 2 Diamonds was alerted but after the pass |pg||
nt|h_karluk: to me 1d-1s, 2s better but maybe they've a different CC than mine|pg||
nt|othered1: Assuming, of course, that we're not into relays|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to make 7, S has to play in a correct tempo and use his entries well|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, 4@H was down, can he make 4S?|pg||
nt|haans: new try?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: NS cannot play 3 rounds of @S, then E might go down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2@d was either 12-14 or 18+ with 4 spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: close to be doomed but not sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: may just concede three tricks well|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H,3@C by ruff, 3@D by ruff and 1 natural trump trick,or 2 @D ruffs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a space to pitch @c loser to @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: same as next door|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: spirited stuff by East here, who seems to like bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: oh, he can't :)|pg||
nt|haans: blood|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: this should end up a push |pg||
nt|othered1: This south will consider how he makes 7 with 4-0 split and won't go wrong.|pg||
nt|haans: are Parol really asked?|pg||
nt|cicus: it seems to me 4@S was on with some very good guessing|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: But 7 is tricky to bid.  That 5th @S in north hand is invaluable.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that is to make the correct ruff in @h and keep entries on hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: unlucky with the @s split compensated with 3-3 in @h|pg||
nt|othered1: anyone translate the auction?  Is it relatively natural?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks very natural for me|pg||
nt|tez: maybe 2nt shows @sfit|pg||
nt|tez: if not..bad bid|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: club now,  might get ruff later by S |pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence can get @HA, trump and a club ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: but oh well  |pg||
nt|othered1: NS probably were making 3@H on the auction, maybe even 4|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|april7: cash all high cards and then cross ruff|pg||
nt|tez: ohh noo|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: but not now|pg||
nt|cicus: e.g. the @D opening has to be taken immediately to avoid the ruff|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|haans: sad when your ruff with your trumph tricks|pg||

nt|tez: ny=NT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|h_karluk: i say nice opps:)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: you will see the player names|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps they were, since West would doubtless have led a spade - but even so, South might have lost a trick in the suit anyway|pg||
nt|ybob: wasted values QJ@S, J @H , J @C and J @D here|pg||
nt|othered1: east would have been on lead against @H|pg||
nt|dburn: so he would, sorry|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: the "aha" moment |pg||
nt|haans: jni33: dbl of 4@s from E isnt that better than Pass? Me agree there|pg||

nt|sybarra: for both N and W |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|sK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: now @sQ is importaht|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: Is it meaningful that north bid @D, his long suit, first and got to 7@S, while in OR @S were bid first and they got to 6?|pg||
nt|cicus: but West's bidding is a textbook example of what not to do|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|h9|nt|haans: yep lot of books on it bid once and pass|pg||
