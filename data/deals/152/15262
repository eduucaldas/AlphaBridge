nt|haans: Sucken have no good bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yesterday, we saw Sabine lead the @ST from KTx of dummy's bid @S suit which held QJ-sixth.  Daniela won the A and returned a low one and declarer understandably pitched a side ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: loser, losing to Sabine's K and could only comment, "That was sexy."|pg||
nt|bernix: europe has amassed a large deficit of 18 BPs. so we have to make up ground NOW|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mamos: just us talking to ourselves :)|pg||

nt|pef: gitelman and levin's partners in this match are Bob Hamman and Bobby Levin|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what a hand, 4@H EW as the cards are placed and good save in minors for NS.|pg||
nt|rado: N may blast to 3NT now|pg||
nt|bernix: 6 BPs at stage per session, a 6-0 would help our cause|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: they have landed right|pg||
nt|chick: nice choice by Auken ... with N showing 4 hearts, she chooses to show the diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: von Arnom knows only 40 hcp exist but ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Tricky hand and difficult for W to pass 2@D.|pg||
nt|haans: Arnim|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|bernix: welcome back to buffet cup, session 8|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: simple clubs raise?|pg||
nt|haans: pass a good option|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|chick: N has pretty much described his hand, except for about an A worth of value, but with his partner passing 2@D, I don't think he has much left to say|pg||

mb|5H|mb|d|nt|rado: Fantoni may lead small @H at trick 2|pg||
nt|bernix: usa need 11 more bps to win the trophy. europe need 29 bps|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Hi Victor|pg||
nt|haans: all cards wrong :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if defence is accurate then 3 down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: +3|pg||
nt|bernix: unlucky - but normal - lead|pg||

nt|spooky: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: Hi Hans|pg||
nt|bernix: fantoni needs to find the @h switch now. should be routine|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: just a @S p/s for NS?   East took one too many bids|pg||
nt|mamos: yep looks like -300|pg||
nt|daman: difficult to understand whay he would bid 4@C|pg||
nt|daman: siff @S and Qxx of @D is better|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: 3NT looks like making, only a @C lead from south would set it.|pg||
nt|daman: t*|pg||
nt|yvesj49: nice event|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: well you cant really find yourself in a room where 'dud' players are in action ... as this event features 24 of the world's very best|pg||
nt|mamos: are we linked to the correct table ?|pg||
nt|mamos: i thought the twins were always scoring agianst Levin and Weinstein|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: other room looks to have started with a precision 2@C, and someohow they couldnt put the brakes on before reaching a hopelessly optimistic 6C|pg||
nt|spooky: but Brogeland took his "safe"plus scoe in 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: but non vulnerable :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bridge a funny game - Jx of @H's part of the thinking to go back to 2@S but @HJ turns out to be highly useful card.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Indeed eliminates a @D loser, as it is.|pg||
mb|6C|nt|yvesj49: where we can see the best world's players|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|spooky: 5@D bid and made at the other table, so first board goes to USA|pg||

nt|odysseus69: looked strange play of diamod 9|pg||
nt|petergill: Heading for 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|dburn: may be a little late for that now, given the running scores just posted|pg||
nt|petergill: @DJ, then low spade to nine, might have him in with a chance of eleven tricks via the intrafinesse|pg||
nt|Walddk3: or 3 x 6-0 and 2 x 5-1. Unrealistic|pg||

nt|chick: hopefully we'll find out the end result of that board when the operator has time to put it in :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: technical problems - contract is 4S by NS |pg||
nt|haans: If Levin had bid 3@C von Arnim odds to bid 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: new board now|pg||
nt|mamos: just too much from Justin there|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I think so |pg||
nt|jcwla: The N hand playable in three different strains, contains a void, and the @H suit represents a small fraction of its values with nothing on top.  |pg||
nt|yvesj49: ty rashed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes @@@C and @D.|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: bidding 4@C on that hand is like found money for the opps     getting something for nothing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|Walddk5: East is Justin Hackett|pg||
nt|bernix: looks like something went wrong :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: 3 off I believe|pg||
nt|bernix: yes|pg||
nt|drewsky: Why do you say that..down 3 looked norma|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pef: this look like a likely 4H game|pg||
mb|1D|nt|haans: 6@C possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They are both   J  Hackett|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rv: transfer responses here, 1@h shows 4+@s|pg||
nt|Walddk5: But North is Hampson|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: ah, that makes a bit more sense|pg||
nt|rado: 4@H with @S guess|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: they could be trying a posible 3NT contract from West hand |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: X will come from W|pg||
nt|bernix: von arnim could bid it knowing partner must have 'some' values|pg||
nt|bernix: X has disadvantage that she still doesnt know what to do over 3@s|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true a problem of space |pg||
nt|bernix: on my screen it was -2|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: 4@H can be beateb on spade lead|pg||
nt|drewsky: ONLY if played by south|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good bid west|pg||
nt|yvesj49: NS are out of 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: Individual: Each player on Team Europe is drawn to compare with a particular player on Team USA. A player does not meet the player with whom he or she compar|pg||
nt|yvesj49: WITH 25 COUNT|pg||
nt|yvesj49: if i play i don't want to be compared with fantoni lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or 6@H|pg||
nt|mamos: although  Americans are in 4@C x at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Fred is playing in Match A|pg||
nt|rado: strange no Drury used?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: pass surprising |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: I think her 3 card @C makes her pass|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rv: Brogeland's 1@s denies 4@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Henry, welcome.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Got it right now|pg||
nt|pef: a rather speculative double from Duboin assuming that's not an anomaly|pg||
nt|bernix: they are using a standardized cc most propably w/o drury|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: 1@S shows 3@S|pg||
nt|rv: with 4 he would have jumped to 2@s and with 2 would have rebid 1n or 2m|pg||
mb|4D|nt|spooky: weird that Brogeland didn't open 1NT, they play 15-17...|pg||
nt|rv: Levin-Weinstein compared with Duboin-Sementa and Brogeland-Saelensmide with Sontag-Berk|pg||
nt|rv: play of @h suit critical for OT in this contract|pg||
nt|ady: Europe should win the board 5@C  at least down 2|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D Bourke = just GF bid|pg||
nt|daman: Berkowicz|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: it's about the overtrick in this lay out|pg||
nt|mamos: the scoring method has led to many NT contracts  as players hunt for the magic +10 points|pg||
nt|daman: easy to figure this 3rd and 5th|pg||
nt|rado: other table will open E hand probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: cc was consulted by Fulvio before bidding 3H|pg||
nt|drewsky: Perhaps you need lasek surgery ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: we were on "manual" here - sorry|pg||
mb|4N|nt|haans: holy ... 2nt natural?|pg||
nt|chick: looks like just one diamond loser, and perhaps a heart loser|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sound 4@S with @H guess can make 6.|pg||
nt|haans: odds against doing right in hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true. 10 @H very vital card.|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: In every case the four individuals at one table have their corresponding opponent sitting in the same seat at the matching table. |pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Berk made the same bad 4@C bid|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: some spects say Est could of bid 3@D|pg||
nt|bernix: saelesmind made 8 tricks in 1n on board 13 to win the fist point for europe|pg||
mb|5S|nt|rv: I presume Levin will duck @h to @hK smoothyl|pg||
nt|pef: well 5c would have been a good save|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Good lead.|pg||
mb|6C|nt|rv: smoothly|pg||
nt|mamos: getting too high ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: nice organization|pg||
mb|6S|nt|jcwla: Instead of wishing physical harm on your enemy, just wish that Sabine leads to all their contracts.|pg||
nt|bernix: careful unblocking enables auken to make 11 tricks now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: unless South is very much asleep when declarer plays a heart from dummy later on, this will go -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: wheels have come off here|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: this helps declarer|pg||
nt|rv: after South's @H9, Brogeland may just get it right|pg||
nt|rv: ah, easy now for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Pairs, Teams and Individual events in Warren Buffet Cup, all scoring is BAM style|pg||
nt|rv: so OTs and UTs very crucial, this form of scoring is lot tougher than IMPs and a bit tougher than Pairs (MPs)|pg||
nt|rv: if you make 8 tricks in 2@s and your opps make same 8 tricks in NT, you get 0 BAM points|pg||
nt|haans: 54% for this slam|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event. Have a look|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer will have to sniff out Heart position for a good score|pg||
nt|daman: he will sniff it out by default|pg||
nt|daman: he will not risk his contract   and in so doing will drop the @H King|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That would be +2 and good score.|pg||

nt|odysseus69: is there any reason to get hearts wrong?|pg||
nt|pef: interesting point of the hand, it looks like hampson needs to take a diamond finesse now, giving up on the heart finesse|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|daman: 4@H has the same guess as overtricks in 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  unlucky. This way he runs out of trumps|pg||
nt|henryb:  provided North continues spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: East has no clearcut lead to 4@C - perhaps a low heart?  |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|c2|pc|d3|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|sybarra: The total of Buffett points over four days is 198. When a team reaches 100 points, it has won the Trophy. |pg||
nt|yvesj49: with BAM bareme ?|pg||
nt|jcwla: So this means Sementa with Meyers, Duboin with B. Levin, Hamman with von Arnim, and Rodwell with Nunes?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event. Have a look|pg||
nt|sybarra: If the scores are tied on 99 each, Europe, who won the trophy in Louisville, will retain it. |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: a wildish hand |pg||

nt|Walddk5: I have the pairings here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: x was rather optimistic, x by W of 2@H was instrumental.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|kiwi_joker: Whether you bid an immed 3H or 4H on these hands, depends on how much you like 7-4-1-1 shapes|pg||

nt|henryb:  E-W are three or four down in a major suit contract|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: leads are 1,3,5 but not easy for W he can see singleton card @D in the declarer |pg||
mb|d|nt|jameslee 2: I really think West needs to make a move & X there even with only 2card @S|pg||
nt|bernix: do they use 2@d 3rd suit forcing ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: its a 12 trick contract here on board 15 |pg||
nt|bernix: 6@c is one of two finesses|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: could be in 6NT direct from E|pg||
nt|bernix: if you do not use '3rd suit forcing', what do you bid with jason's hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: as bernard says could bid a 3rd new suit forcing but has in mind 6nt sure |pg||

nt|lestergold: and gernbrand |pg||
nt|rv: thinking aloud, would it helped Weinstein to play @Hj and @hx to indicate @d preference|pg||
nt|rv: not sure of their SP methods, many partnerships play smith-echo or rev smith-echo in nt contracts to indicate continuation of suit or shifts in obvious / non-obvious suits|pg||

nt|odysseus69: disrupting the oppo from 1NT is a popular pairs idea but there are limits and this is really stretching the concept|pg||
nt|haans: some say in MP you lose it you let them play 1nt|pg||
nt|haans: thats why DONT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I was interested to see what Helgemo would lead v 1NT - Helness spoiled it|pg||

nt|drewsky: This is the Indivdual portion of the contest, and all of the players have to play identical systems set forth by the organizers.|pg||
mb|6H|nt|mamos: defence had some chance of keeping this to nine  tricks on Club leads  but ten more likely|pg||

mb|6S|nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|haans: @D = jump this suit|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder what the @D3 actually means in their signal system|pg||
nt|haans: you do not kill the diamond suit yourselve if good in diamond|pg||
nt|rnmalik: It has to be a shift and @S looks reasonable.|pg||
nt|chick: that's the question Rashed, does it just ask for a shift, or does it indicate which suit.   |pg||
nt|chick: and if you were sitting S, which suit would you want to signal for?  :)|pg||
nt|haans: Weistein can have max 2 hearts|pg||

nt|spooky: this board will be a win to europe to tie this match.|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: this form of scoring is toughest to play, even more so than MPs where field evens you a bit|pg||
nt|bernix: only within the team|pg||
nt|bernix: the american system differs from the european|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chick: Keep in mind that this is BAM, which means an extra trick wins the hand.|pg||
nt|chick: This is the most tense form of bridge, because even a tiny mistake can make the difference in a full win or loss of the board point|pg||
nt|jcwla: It just got easier.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I am result oriented:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rv: of Weinstein doesn't know the result in OR and is trying his best to make the best of a inferior contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think he must have had the same thoughtas 3 commentators|pg||
nt|rv: most bridge events is not palyed in Barometric style of scoring, hence players don't know result till they play all deals in a session/round/segment|pg||
nt|rv: are not played|pg||
nt|spooky: I played board a match once, and it's really fun, but you have no idea what they do at the other table, because everybody is trying to score the point every board..|pg||
nt|rv: yes Hop, this form of scoring is most definitely bleeding-edge, a bit tougher than even MPs where field does protect you to some extent|pg||
nt|ady: should quicken now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A@H and another would restrict the declarer to the contract.|pg||

nt|rv: at these colors, I will consider a pass|pg||
nt|ady: you lack quick tricks out side diamonds     even if there is sokid diamonds oppsoite   KQJ etc   it seems either a club or heart trick will leave you 1 short|pg||
nt|drewsky: The opponents are cold for 5@C....don't make it easy for them to get there|pg||
nt|ady: club or heart lead |pg||
nt|rv: Fantunes rate to take this atleast 2 down at this stage of play, so Europe may not lose on this board|pg||
nt|ady: thats different if you are bidding to keep them out|pg||
nt|rv: in my experience of watching top level Vu graph, Fantunes are exceptionally good defenders even amongst the elite|pg||
nt|pef: very aggressive 3NT call by levin.  but looks like it will be justified with only 3 hearts available and the spade finesse working|pg||
