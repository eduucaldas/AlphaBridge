mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We shall see (hear)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: He had cause to complain, defending a 3NT contract. The opening lead had exposed the heart suit. When Zia got in, he switched! |pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: North does indeed hold eight tricks for partner, but the game will still go down.|pg||

mb|3N|nt|jcwla: The competing teams, from Europe and the United States, consist of 12 players each and include one Womens pair and five Open pairs.|pg||

nt|roswolf: coincide, as closely as possible, with it. |pg||
nt|jbgood: difficult to avoid the hopeless game?|pg||
nt|flash: i'm not fond of the 1NT opener with 2 suits unstopped, but Helness made the same call|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: For Europe, NPC Paul Hackett of England has selected Sabine Auken & Daniela von Arnim, Germany, Boye Brogeland & Erik Saelensminde, Geir Helgemo & Tor Helness, Norway, Giorgio ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Duboin & Antonio Sementa, Fulvio Fantoni & Claudio Nunes, Italy, and Jason & Justin Hackett, England.|pg||
nt|mrt2000: expect 4@S now|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: P is forcing followed by 4@S shows a flexible hand|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi Ed|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have 5@C  assuming getting club right|pg||
nt|ady: hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: a feisty auction as one would expec5t at this form of scoring|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: For the USA, NPC Donna Compton has chosen David Berkowitz & Alan Sontag, Bob Hamman & Zia Mahmood, Bobby Levin & Steve Weinstein, Jill Levin & Jill Meyers, Jeff Meckstroth & Eric ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||
nt|jcwla: The competition includes Pairs, Teams and an Individual. All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
nt|flash: in the Individual, even during the round in which a player draws his/her regular partner, they must use the team convention card|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: for convention cards go to http://www.buffettcup.com/ConventionCards/tabid/151/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: this should be axed|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  well over the top|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: Of course Rodwell isn't overjoyed at bidding 3@S but he doesn't have much option.|pg||
nt|flash: likely to hear Meckstroth's shrug when he bids 4@S?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Duboin has to find h shift on winning spd ace to beat this, not difficult for him|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D is constructive|pg||
nt|jcwla: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
nt|jcwla: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared.  Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: note South's response on a 1-count |pg||
nt|jcwla: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, we will have the Individual. Each player has drawn a player from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared. Each player partners each of the other eleven ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: players on their team for a short set (6 boards) against various partnerships from the other team.  Each team has agreed on a standard convention card for this event.|pg||
nt|sybarra: need your guessing shoes on in either contract however |pg||
nt|mrdct: now the challenge is to hold this to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1@H and 3@C to lose here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: usually partner will X in response to P|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay very well for n/s    can make 4@S as well |pg||
nt|roswolf: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|roswolf: difficult for north to lead a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: but fortunately south ha another ace|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|jcwla: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: but they do have to cash the first 4 :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not that you can find it but a @C lead beats 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|athene: one down is easy (@DAK, @HA, east's trump trick, with a ruff or not)|pg||
nt|roswolf: has|pg||
nt|jbgood: NS can make quite a few tricks in @ds, but ... and 3 NT may go lots of downers if defense is found|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and remember it is BAM scoring|pg||
nt|jbgood: still, may be easier to get the odd extra trick in NT than in @s contract|pg||
nt|flash: with the rather surprising location of the @SK, this will make|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psridhar: this may go all the way to 6s, a faulty contract !|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N the likely destination here|pg||
nt|jbgood: for example if S plays the ten now...|pg||
nt|flash: (certainly reasonable to expect 4 @Hs in East's hand and no reason why partner need have any)|pg||
nt|flash: same auction as comparison table|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrt2000: not a great start for Mexwell|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i think that was wrong the undoubled undertricks may not compensate for the n/s partscore|pg||
nt|roswolf: even -3 might lose the board to -170|pg||
nt|flash: 15-17; xfer; denies 3-card @S spt; GF 2nd suit; conclusion|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mrdct: meck has a good look at dummy's stiff @CK|pg||

nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|drewsky: Good Morning, Bridge World :)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: oops|pg||
nt|flash: in the other room, rodwell overcalled 2@H and they sold to 3@D|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  just a matter of how many overtricks here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: much discussion on system|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry, a bit ahead of myself !|pg||
nt|athene: and two down will be pretty much impossible i would imagine|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C certainly wasn't a routine action so this might be a swing for europe|pg||

nt|psridhar: helgemo/helness managed to beat it though !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event. Have a look|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: ah well the fun begins|pg||
nt|flash: with dummy's @D holding exposed, the defense is a big favorite to take 6 tricks here|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jbgood: I dont think Broge will try for overtick(s):)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|othered1: And 1N was making, likely with overtricks|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but obvious for West to bid 2@s|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mrdct: good start for europe|pg||
nt|athene: East's discard on the @DK asked for a heart, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer only had the @HK it would be necessary to play a heart through to get the second undertrick|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't want to ruff, of course, as soon as he sees dummy |pg||

nt|roswolf: well making the contract is a win:)|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|daman: West will not go down|pg||

nt|roswolf: remember The competition includes Pairs, Teams and an Individual. All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: available: a win, a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
nt|ady: Meckstroth can gain entry 3 times including a diamond ruff to play a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: -4 might still be possible|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: 2@C is Drury|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|brolucius: Although East has 11 points, she does not bid to 3@H because of the Law of Total Trumps. She expected eight trumps and therefore wants to play only at the eight-trick level.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The argument is that your 11 points will fare just as well in defence.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|brolucius: I tell a lie. She HAS gone to 3@H.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, HE has|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bobby is East|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, indeed.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Discard coming on the diamonds, so South must take what tricks HE can.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They can't keep her from 10 tricks if she guesses spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @HQ is marked after the lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's @D8 was a count signal.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: Europe "only" needs three clean sweeps in the first three sessions to tie the match. USA is 18 points ahead |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wishful thinking perhaps; USA has been very strong in all events|pg||
nt|brolucius: An insuperable margin, in practice. But we can still enjoy the bridge, board by board.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Europe never got out of the traps.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Justin got everything wrong at the other table as you now see|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: So a win for USA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Justin had a first-round double from North to give him the info, so hard to imagine how he went down.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Match B is all square, Europe 1 up in Match C|pg||
nt|brolucius: North was marked with the @SA, one would think, and South with the heart length.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but they are playing for swings because they are so many points behind|pg||
nt|brolucius: Does not bode well for the 'miracle change of fortune' that is required.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Wellcome to Venky|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome even|pg||
nt|athene: if East shows a limit raise in hearts, West won't like his hand that much|pg||
nt|athene: the spades are bad because there are over-ruffs threatened|pg||
nt|roswolf: a classic weak2!?|pg||
mb|d|nt|rmb1: Board-a-match throughout|pg||

nt|andyv:  hi Venky|pg||
nt|rv: Hi all, warm welcome from Bangalore in South India|pg||
mb|r|nt|odysseus69: no not a board a match - over 11 boards each pair is competing gainst a specific pair from the other team|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont know who is playing weak NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Fantoni-Nunes, I think |pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is quite funny. On the European CC we see negative doubles through 3@S, on the American through 7@H!|pg||
nt|flash: jump Q is a mixed raise (limit; usually 4 trumps; some defense)|pg||
nt|flash: a dreadful suit to overcall, but certainly a big enough hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jan_jansma: I knew :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks almost easier than 4 @S actually |pg||
nt|ady: think a slip up in the play playing clubs as it turns out|pg||
nt|yvesj49: slam in @h ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: zia went -3 in the same contract in the other room|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2@s west 3@h east ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: possible yves|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: helpful lead|pg||

mb|2H|nt|jcwla: With all that said, hi Mike.  Looks like a very good result for Europe on Board 1.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you need the 1NT in "sandwich" position to be natural against this EW pair. They open and respond very light. |pg||
nt|daman: weak Smolen|pg||
nt|sybarra: at imps you might be in 4 @S |pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: Hi Jordan|pg||
nt|mdgraham: On the last board, East may be weak with a long suit. Lebensohl comes in handy (2NT puppets 3@C, then you can bid your long suit). A diretc bid shows reasonable values.|pg||
nt|ady: may be difficult to reach a slam|pg||
nt|flash: Helness chose 1NT - neither action at all likely to find a @D contract...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|psridhar: Brogeland seq asks for pd to pick a 2 level major nf|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@H can be beaten, so this not so good for Europe|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@H makes from the N hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a gadget strikes|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: the view in trumps will be crucial here|pg||
nt|athene: he might make even losing to both hearts - he certainly will want to finesse trumps to try to keep south from putting a spade through|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but the BAM scoring method makes a significant difference|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if you just need lots of entries to dummy you might play the @DA here, but he would quite like his second diamond trick|pg||
nt|athene: my guess he will go @DK, club to the ace, trump finesse, and then think about things|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: Boye always thinks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: claims would be easier in teams|pg||
nt|roswolf: he could win in hand and lay down the Ace of trumps - and I dont think that is an unreasonable line of play which would hit the jackpot here|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with winning the first trick in hand and playing a club for the trump finesse is you are using up your clubs before you really want to|pg||
nt|athene: for example @DK, club to ace, trump finesse loses, north plays a club straight back at you|pg||
nt|athene: and you have a nasty guess to make|pg||
nt|athene: if you play @DA here and a heart finesse you have a bit more breathing-space with the club suit|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't want to be cut off from the clubs before trumps are drawn|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence might be able to do that by attacking clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed bill but that is why laying down the ace is not reasonable|pg||
nt|roswolf: not unreasonable i meant!!|pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes but you really, really don't want to lose a trump to south|pg||
nt|athene: and have spade through and immediately lose @SAQ with a possible overruff on a third spade|pg||
nt|athene: i think you have to take lots of trump finesses through south|pg||
nt|roswolf: true that is why declarer's thinking|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm vive la difference!|pg||
nt|jbgood: best game and righthanded too|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes individuals are all about practical bidding|pg||
nt|flash: notice the immediate raise - even without the 4th trump, starting with 1@S, intending to support @Hs later would give a distorted picture of the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: @C tap right away|pg||
nt|psridhar: sharp competition fro NS even though they r vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: indeed so, but not from S!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unlikely to go down even from S...  J from Jx seems an unlikely choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a fair shot by geir|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: So West wasn't flying solo when he bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|psridhar: that attacking lead will tap decl trumps, but decl may not mind scoring his little trumps in a dummy reversal manner|pg||
nt|daman: West has to get the @Ss moving|pg||
nt|jbgood: not giwing away 2 heart tricks may be good for Europe|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|flash: Hamman leaves Sontag room, but 10 tricks available on @C position (which is immediately exposed)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bigtrain: always 11 tricks available in @S...  @C lead holds 3N to 10|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good road to slam|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam never really in the picture|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 50%|pg||
pc|c9|nt|odysseus69: looks like 8 tricks i|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, S passed the 1@S opening and EW ended in 3@C.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: it seems duboin quite pessimist|pg||
nt|psridhar: if he guesses the layout he can make 10 tricks for 170|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|sybarra: so the "secret" so far is lead clubs agst. nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt many would lead clubs from Jxxx|pg||
nt|roswolf: a little worse i think and at BAM scoring not a good propostion - unless it makes of course!:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bigtrain: better lead than from Axxx imo|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: poor quality trumps|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|flash: down 2 likely|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|bigtrain: tempo seems to dictate a @C lead is best|pg||
nt|psridhar: Ed any comment on why Justin prefered 3h to 2s X ?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: 2-2 @D and @CK in the S hand allow 11 tricks it seems|pg||
pc|c5|nt|daman: this way looks OK as well|pg||
nt|mrt2000: really, I think it's likely to be the best attack at trick 1|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but east didn't bid 4@d a good new with bare ace|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: This isn't a regular partnership and he might have concerns about how penalty-oriented double would have been|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jbgood: zia stole back in the OR|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psridhar: Brogeland playing dummy reversal indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: Duboin is on the right track so far|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|rmb1: Do Justin+Jason still play weak NT?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no- 14-16 rising to 15-17 in 3rd and 4th|pg||
nt|psridhar: needs to use dia ace to play spd|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be down 1...NS just need to be careful and not get endplayed in the @h suit|pg||
nt|rv: Roland, is last night's score of US leading by 20 Buffet points confirmed?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yvesj49: i show my cards.......|pg||
nt|jbgood: no opp had a red card for him - dont they know him by now?:)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h4|nt|flash: without that lead, the only road to 10 tricks would be to start with the @CJ - not at the top of everyone's list...|pg||

nt|yvesj49: pretty hand eric|pg||
nt|flash: right, all...    3@HX is 530; so this table's result was irrelevant|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: at trick 2|pg||
nt|psridhar: but EW bid well with E bidding only 1nt on a goodish 18|pg||
nt|lml: hi :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 14-16|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 15,  Hamman and Zia in 5 @D |pg||

nt|flash: board 7 result in - an easy win for Europe|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: possible auction here -  3NT-6@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, same start to the auction, but Brogeland did not move over N's 1NT, so a win to USA there.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D = 2+ 10-15 or so... many shapes possible|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i don't know, i've seen plenty of meck's actions that require explanation  :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|daman: goodish is a new word to me|pg||
nt|rv: for this match Zia, Hamman and Meckwell are for US, German Ladies, Fantunes for Europe|pg||
nt|roswolf: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 1@s forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: that's usually best left between him and his analyst?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrdct: NS can make 4@c i think|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Rodwell will like this 3@C bid :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: it was a close call for Justin...|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt is a zia like effort|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: sure to make 6D - but can they get there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has a huge hand now after the 3@D jump |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and not bid grand|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i saw it yesterday lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm north would want to pass methinks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: perfect fit for 5D|pg||
nt|flash: 79 - 65 USA...   need to get to 100|pg||
nt|flash: 2 Buffett Points per 6-board match|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rv: this seems to be par contract|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 4,5@C?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: no 1@s is forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: this one appears to be flat also|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 9 or 10 tricks, I excpect|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but i would still want to pass!|pg||
nt|roswolf: and a probable winning one|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jbgood: even though Zia is West... 2 NT may just roll home |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@S likely a fragment-style bid, as South did not bid 1@S over 1@H |pg||
nt|daman: Some pairs play DOPI for controls over opposition to their 2@C opening|pg||
nt|daman: he might get squeezed if he doesn't take his 2@Hs|pg||
nt|daman: but there is the issue of transportation|pg||
nt|daman: and N can hold the @Ss|pg||
nt|psridhar: decl has 10 top tricks and will need to play h to get his 11th|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: very well done by NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: I always have problems finding my .5 card |pg||
nt|mrdct: optimal spot for NS|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i leant the method this night lol|pg||
nt|flash: a bit surprised at the 2@S call - a limit raise with 3 trumps certainly possible|pg||
nt|othered1: American style is to rebid 2@C on good hands with north's shape, 2@H, with lesser h ands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 3@S is just showing a stop (of sorts) for 3NT,  Does not know North is making slam tries.|pg||
nt|daman: if East had AK10 of @S there would be a shot  |pg||
nt|roswolf: run the club jack and bobs your uncle|pg||
nt|jbgood: or take the di finesse - that is also a winning loser:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|flash: 4 trump tricks and the @HA?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: now decl is a tempo behind -likely only 430|pg||
nt|yvesj49: agressive lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: learnt*|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   likely to fail     4@S has a better play|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2@d probably raise in spades|pg||
nt|flash: 3@S shortness; 4@S cue bid|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rv: inpite of big @c fit, @hQ is offside and 9 tricks are limit here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is now about the play|pg||
nt|psridhar: cards are not lying well for NS -Sontag's game try over 2H, if he had tried, wd nott hv been a success|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: no 1@S overcall - mildly surprising|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5@C is not a bad contract (it is with the @CK ofside:))|pg||
nt|ady: need to avoid the heart finesse     likely to go down |pg||
nt|flash: with Sontag at the table, we'll tend to be ahead of the comparison table|pg||
nt|flash: in 3NT in other room|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psridhar: cl are 5-0|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Interesting now|pg||
nt|jbgood: Helness' 3 spades in the OR more difficult to cope with than the more conservative 2 @s here|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|odysseus69: few undos to correct|pg||
nt|lml: what is the max tricks possible?|pg||
nt|flash: the fate of 3@S isn't clear, given the 4-1 split|pg||
nt|othered1: This wouldn't be the worst game ever seen, but the lead makes north happy he's not overboard.|pg||
nt|psridhar: quite well judged by Sontag poised for 110 now|pg||
nt|othered1: And a conservative approach is typical in board-a-match scoring|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: does now....|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Teams, Pairs and Individual events in Wareen Buffet Cup, every event is scored on BAM style, so OTs and UTs are very important|pg||
nt|rv: German ladies have competed to 3@s in OR which is only 1 down|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|xenya: i think he can make 11 now|pg||
nt|lml: 5 i think after that good guess|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a @D and a @S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if Brogeland can duck clubs twice Meckstroth has to guess right|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|yvesj49: one off|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks -1 but likely to be in game at the other table|pg||
nt|yvesj49: heart switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: yes 2d alerted as raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty terry|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: club lead still not good enough|pg||
nt|rmb1: In a less confident partnership, South would have let North play in hearts by now :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not content with 6@D at pairs. But a club lead may be interesting  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to make after the take out double|pg||
nt|odysseus69: west will be thrown in to concede 2 spade tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess there is a strip squeeze on a club lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
nt|flash: this would have made only 10 tricks - @S finesse works, but nowhere to park the 3rd round of @Ss|pg||
pc|h7|nt|odysseus69: also could duck and squeeze as long as he reads distribution-not a problem either way |pg||
nt|xenya: now he has to get @H right as well|pg||
nt|rv: much needed board for Europeans |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the t/o double places virtually all the high cards - just room for East to hold @SJ perhaps|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Sabine Auken needs to play a @D now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: for 11|pg||
nt|flash: however, this shift has opened up the possibility of an overtrick|pg||
nt|flash: Helness went down in 4@H on Board 20; tie match|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rmb1: Doesn't duck and squeeze require West to have @SJ, which is only card he might not have|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no - spade jack not relevant|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: although West may reduce to a singleton K in spades - but North will get it right  |pg||
nt|rmb1: The plan is for south to have SQx and winning diamond, and North to have SAx and C10.  |pg||
nt|dimi: Nunes has to hold @c K and @s K, so there is no chance to escape the squeeze|pg||
nt|odysseus69: N/S areboth Jill- North Jill Levin -now corrected-wife of Bobby Levin|pg||
nt|lml: yes it may be quite tempting to play hearts the wrong way|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** BUFFETT CUP IN RUNNING Currently USA 50  EUR 46  ****|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rmb1: When South cashes the diamond, either the C10 or SQ will become a winner|pg||

nt|lml: since it is safer that way|pg||

pc|cK|nt|odysseus69: that smells|pg||
nt|flash: now Zia's ducked a 2nd @C and Fantoni is home...   |pg||

nt|roswolf: REHI everyone|pg||
nt|ady: re|pg||
nt|ady: already the club lead to the ace has helped declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: have missed play here will give score at end|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: system crashed|pg||
nt|ady: seems we are back to the beginning|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok terry thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: i think SQ was switched |pg||
nt|ady: with spades 3-3  and declarers clubs set up  defence has to take care to make A@H|pg||
nt|ady: vital in this form of scoring|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment david|pg||
nt|flash: board 2 a push|pg||
nt|flash: same contract; same lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well done |pg||
nt|flash: natural lead of the @CT, so little chance of beating 3@S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzrg: 12-14|pg||
nt|flash: the situation in the other room is why Smith Echo was invented...|pg||
mb|2C|mb|4C|nt|psridhar: 2c=trf +ve ( dia)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: cards for the Individual and other information|pg||
nt|stigw: Hi all, I*ve been allowed as commentator at this table. Maybe I need some help regarding Meckwell's system, I'm afraid.|pg||
nt|flash: weak 2-bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: probably 3NT bye east|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: looks like Fantoni-Nunes are playing their own system|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no response on a 2-count at this vulnerability!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 1@C is 14+ with clubs or 15+ BAL, F|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 9 tricks in hearts and a struggle for 9 in spades -|pg||
nt|xenya: was well defended by N -- that @C shift|pg||
nt|rv: Buffet points format is analogous to a set in tennis, 7-6 is worth same as 6-0|pg||
nt|mrt2000: anybody fancy 6@H?|pg||
nt|ady: e/w will get to 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: matches in the teams are of 14 bds|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this looks a push but this is certainly not a gimmee in an individual|pg||
mb|p|nt|drewsky: Many partnerships play that 4 of a aminor here by west is NOT a slam try.....|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@h a clever bid putting the presure on north|pg||
nt|mrdct: west happy to defend now|pg||
nt|flash: (that uses an echo in the suit declarer first attacks to indicate how much you like the suit led)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Sontag wanted to bid but I suspect that 2 natural clubs not on the menu|pg||
nt|flash: (so, if Levin were able to conventionally stand up on his chair and scream "my suit's ready to run", E-W would have gotten all their tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|yvesj49: don't be afraid alfred lol|pg||
nt|flash: Sontag has an immense hand opposite the X|pg||
nt|flash: trumps not strong enough (and no shortness), so Sontag pulls to 3@C|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bigtrain: don't worry about that... i can handle things there|pg||
nt|othered1: This won't be exciting in play|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably forcing lol|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psridhar: this shd be a flat bd losing just the 2 aces for 650|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: 6@H is not a bad contract but it won't make with the club offside|pg||
nt|mrdct: but will +100 be enough for europe to win the board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We have the big train here to tell us about the Meckwell system|pg||
nt|roswolf: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|jbgood: doesnt really matter whether he plays 2 or 3 - if he doesnt get 9, he loses the board, if he gets 10, he wins it|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the play is the thing|pg||
nt|psridhar: assuming NS wont venture 5c in other room |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: as is the modern style aggressive bidding all round|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@H is a transfer 0-11 4 @S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 1@h shows spades. Good here for double  to be take-out of the shown suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3nt wont play well on a h lead; 5c has chances|pg||
nt|diumraid: Current in running scores for the Buffett Cup USA 28 EUR 20. To win a continent needs to obtain 100 points. We are in Ruuning in Round 4 of 5 today.|pg||
nt|drewsky: simply a prepared bid in case the enemy calls 4@S, |pg||
nt|andyv:  at least S will find a couple of useful Jacks in N's hand|pg||
nt|rv: each round in Teams and Pairs are worth 4 Buffet points, in Individual event 2 Buffet Points, total of 198 Buffet points at stake over 4 days|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @S to the 9 looks normal, but fatal here|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|ady: probable club lead  |pg||
nt|ady: onviously 2NT forcing|pg||
nt|yvesj49: easy on @c lead|pg||
nt|flash: all 13 available (but certainly not expected)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to John Carruthers|pg||
nt|jgc: Good afternoon all|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bigtrain: down 2 is a live possibility|pg||
nt|mrdct: true|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh, there he is, hello Walter|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes friendly beak in @S|pg||
nt|yvesj49: at least 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 2h showed extra|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|flash: Weinstein a bit worried about Sontag's length in @Cs, but would probably have seen a 2NT call (scrambling) if he didn't have 5|pg||
pc|dT|nt|daman: this is how the event is being played      http://www.buffettcup.com/EventDetails/tabid/70/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|roswolf: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|flash: hi, John - action's fast and furious - not the usual pace for this form of scoring  :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rv: whichever team gets 100 Buffet Points first wins this edition of Warren Buffet Cup|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: only @SA and !x will let him get out for down 1. Unlikely...|pg||
nt|flash: correct, Victor - Landy is the flavor of the day for USA (2@C shows Majors; rest natural)|pg||
nt|flash: @S shift to hold this to 4|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West now has the option of playing North for @s109 doubleton|pg||
nt|stigw: It semmes - the system I mean - to function for them, but I wouldnt dare to try to copy them !|pg||
nt|roswolf: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: jeff is thinking about the play of the Q@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: the current score is USA 60 EUROPE 48|pg||
nt|yvesj49: in teams it's probably the only chance to beat|pg||
nt|ady: have to be carefull not to let 11 tricks through   not taking A@H|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: i bet he is thinking on how to minimise declarer's tricks - i think he will go passive|pg||
nt|roswolf: remember this is BAM scoring|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure by team it's different|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|odysseus69: cant understand Fantoni double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: surprised East didn't rebid 2@s with four-card support|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. However, the scoreboard is americanized for obvious reasons, so we ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: must live with 1-½-0 on the scoreboard. I am sure you can figure it out reghardless|pg||
nt|daman: scores as the come in     http://www.buffettcup.com/RunningScores2010/tabid/155/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|psridhar: Brogeland has tthiss beat in his hand-though he doesnt know it yet|pg||
nt|daman: @D lead is best|pg||
nt|flash: USA +2 in Match B; Match C tied|pg||
nt|flash: well done|pg||
nt|flash: (else declarer would have had time to set up the @Ds for a @S pitch)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jan_jansma: But thast is for us, mortals|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|daman: I take that back |pg||
nt|daman: must be my green tea|pg||
nt|psridhar: Rodwell will scramble 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|othered1: NS have a -200 save in @D, b ut it's not clear how to get in at these colors |pg||
nt|psridhar: Helness made a trick more but was in a cont 2 tricks higher on bd 3|pg||
mc|11|nt|daman: @D was the best continuation|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
nt|lml: the club shift will end nthe hand quickly|pg||
nt|rv: could Fantoni competed to 3@h? not sure|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: 4@H can make, what about 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I argue the dispute along the lines of comparing 'shortage of Pygmies' with 'shortness of Pygmies'.|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@Hs on - lucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Sontag opened 3@D on the North cards - a good bid when vulnerable.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D opening by Sontag wins the board|pg||
nt|pelu: not for sure|pg||
nt|pelu: Helness has not passed|pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|brolucius: Not for the first time, we see that players are no longer willing to leap to 4@S when they hold five trumps but no singleton. This is a recent change in evaluation. Players now ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: like a singleton before bidding 4@S.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||

nt|psridhar: after a strong 1c, Rodwell made 2 bids- 3c could noot hv showed dia void, was it 4nt?|pg||
nt|daman: 4NT is not chopped liver in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: although Levin lead a @S|pg||
nt|daman: if he led the @H J   that would have been useful|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1,2 or 3@H with south?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1|pg||
nt|athene: OK so he laid down the @HA - that worked out well|pg||
nt|flash: board 3 also in as a push|pg||
nt|flash: we'll see if Zia can collect at least one more trick...|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 4 spades easy make and 5D a good save|pg||
nt|dimi: good def in 5@d for EW|pg||
nt|bigtrain: me to|pg||
nt|bigtrain: too|pg||
nt|flash: that (lack of an) overtrick may be costly|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: XX shows 4+@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What was the score on 16 in this room, anyone know?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Where Helness did not finesse hearts in 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this could get high very quickly|pg||
nt|mrdct: too much outside to preempt|pg||
nt|flash: the Norwegians are in 3NT on 22, so, again, no push board|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: 4@H looks normal here but maybe by way of stayman|pg||
nt|bigtrain: neb diamond shows 2+@D 10-15 many shapes possible|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: and went 1 down in the open room|pg||
nt|yvesj49: we didn't see this board roland|pg||
nt|athene: wow, that's some pass from east, assuming the double is normal penalties|pg||
nt|athene: this was really the auction? or you are just putting in the final contract?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think we're just catching up|pg||
nt|athene: yes, right, that seems more likely|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi everyone|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps it went something like 2@S - 2NT - 3@S - double - all pass|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mrdct: and opening values anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ok|pg||
nt|stigw: 3 cl down 2 I imagine.|pg||
nt|stigw: Sorry, that was board 15 - a very unlucky start for Hellnes.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: NS very agressive.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 3n just on last sementa apol|pg||
nt|athene: then everyone would be sort of sane|pg||
nt|flash: you saw it here, folks!!!   Sontag opened 1@C and it wasn't strong, artificial and forcing!!!|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rv: arguably the weakest pair in the field, Hackett twins have lost all 5 of their matches yesterday|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure of problem on bd 15 |pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: unless NS lose their diamond fit, which has indeed happened |pg||
nt|daman: they are going down more than 1 in 4NT|pg||
nt|drewsky: stayman, then smolen, the delayed jacoby.....thats the way I like to play it|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a soft lead and declarer should make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|flash: (and the result at this table irrelevant)|pg||
nt|psridhar: after that preempt impossible to find 3S (par for EW )-if justin had balanced 3s , Duboin wd hv raised it|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mrdct: should get to 4@s now|pg||
nt|ady: clubs well placed|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 2nd diamond and a club from dummy|pg||
nt|flash: 2/1 by passed hand not forcing|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|daman: great win for USA|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3 emabrassing overtricks for E|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H is not quite clear to me |pg||
nt|othered1: East  has a lot of cards for the auction up to him.  Not unusual when two pairs use light initial action approaches|pg||
nt|yvesj49: justin will make|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w may well bid the game now|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: well bid|pg||
nt|flash: but that's an extreme position by Sementa|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yvesj49: club now|pg||
nt|yvesj49: and with 10/9 alone|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psridhar: many pairs play 1c-2h/2s to show major 2 suitor in a limited range-not Saelensmin|pg||
nt|daman: they must play standard count in this situation|pg||
nt|rv: sorry they lost 4 out of 5 matches|pg||
nt|bigtrain: don't think they have any play at 10 tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: valuing spade q and so no splinter|pg||
nt|flash: 2@C limit +; 2@D stopper; 2@H stopper; 2NT @S stopper...|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: no discussion|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rv: 10 tricks are possible here|pg||
nt|rv: sorry @c ruff should restrict declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: thanks to all kibitzers for helping me and other commentators when we make mistakes:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: R deep in thought|pg||
nt|rv: another surprising stat from Day 1, Fantunes have also lost 4 matches on Day 1|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if east thought of redoubling, if it would have shown power?  And would NS have sat it out?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well after 3@D - CANTY TYPE QUICK ENOUGH:(|pg||
nt|flash: wonder if Europe has a Drury call available|pg||
nt|flash: good point, Victor - splintering with a singleton K or Q can distort partner's evaluation|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|rv: they are too good a pair and I expect them to bounce back today|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 15 poss fouled board in OR?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: lets ask GIB :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mrdct: can't ruff @c losers and control trumps|pg||
nt|stigw: I guess he might make it now, but no sure thing, even if the start was promising.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: only 6 tricks available for NS|pg||
nt|bigtrain: overtricks are possible for e/w|pg||
nt|stigw: Meck is best to duck here, but not obvious by any means.|pg||
nt|othered1: agree on overtrice|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|odysseus69: what she should have bid last time- this sounded like a slam try - and maye it stopped Fantoni bidding 5D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not easy for EW, the way the auction went|pg||
nt|daman: Incredibly    Levin/Meyers are in 2NT in the OR|pg||
nt|chessmaste: whoops|pg||
nt|bigtrain: or should i say overtrick|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: maybe it shows E's shape?|pg||
nt|drewsky: Apparently they play some sort of funny stayman (modified puppet perhaps), and they got their wires crossed|pg||
nt|lml: they have obviously had some confusion|pg||
nt|xenya: modified puppet, i'm to;d|pg||
nt|roswolf: getting the trumps right will be difficult|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: E/W 6/4 majors but disagree on which way|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|psridhar: if 2s wasnt forcing, E needed to bid more-may be he could have balanced 2N ( unbal, 2 suitor) and corrected 3m to 3H showing spds as his 2nd suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2nt is odd with 6-5 in maj|pg||
nt|stigw: Must be a winning board for Europe here.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and it looks like twelve tricks are there in diamonds - with a shot at thirteen, too|pg||
nt|psridhar: i even sympathise with a 4h punt over 1n-p-p in E seat|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry - I was bidding upside down-2 hearts of course made no sense as did mmy comments|pg||
nt|flash: on the lead and the position of the @CK, down 1|pg||
nt|flash: this looks as though it'll be fast, so let me get a head-start on...|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to the organizing committee for a great job in attracting some of the best pairs in the world|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rv: 5 rounds of Pairs were played yesterday, total of 15 maches and 60 Buffet points decided|pg||
nt|rv: 60 out of 198 Buffet Points decided on Day 1|pg||
pc|d9|nt|daman: uncle|pg||
nt|daman: white flag of surrender|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe with Axx spades North should bid 2 spades rather than 2NT|pg||
nt|flash: the field is immensely stronger than it was 2 years ago and the bridge has been well worth watching|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jan_jansma: ?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: sorry was private|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @C @C creates a @S trick with the @SJ|pg||
nt|jbgood: not sure - Geir may just find it, S is marked with a king and some di support, so may not have the spade queen|pg||
nt|othered1: with this ultrafriendly lie of the cards, 4@SX -100 looks like par.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|flash: again, the convention card is a bit sparse (not to mention the last-minute change to 2/1 GF)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h2|nt|othered1: 180 isn't an automatic win|pg||
nt|stigw: To beat it they must play in a way that probably on this layout means several ovcertricks (at board a match scoring).|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables are no longer linked|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mrdct: @s now for guaranteed beat looks best|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: and everything else also works for EW|pg||
nt|yvesj49: oops|pg||
nt|roswolf: that may give declarer a clue|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  well done by the D|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Pairs, BAM and Teams, all events are scored on BAM style which are converted to Buffet Points at the end of matches|pg||
nt|yvesj49: overtrick is here now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: Operator, could you please shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||

mb|1H|nt|jcwla: On Board 3, Saelensminde led the @SK against 3NT and held it to five, so a win to Europe there.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Wojo|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Walter, wlc|pg||
nt|bigtrain: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Walter|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: sorry, distracted & missed carding|pg||
nt|flash: back at the top of the hour with the 3rd match|pg||
nt|jgc: With Sementa and Sontag at the same table, this is like lightning!!|pg||
nt|flash: re-start at top of the hour - last match of the day coming up|pg||
nt|psridhar: bd 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I dont think he will pass but he is thinking about it|pg||
nt|chessmaste: tough call for West|pg||
nt|yvesj49: the question was is it normal to play 1NT X lol|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chessmaste: how good is his hand for hearts\?|pg||
nt|drewsky: West has many choices....|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a lot of views to get right/wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 2NT was bizarre|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d showing one 6+M (rarely 5) is part of popular Woolsey convention|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they get the @D's in play |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D = 0-7 any shape|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Too strong to overcall 1@S?|pg||
nt|athene: lots of guessing to do|pg||
nt|roswolf: playing in nt is impressive in the other room with a 6-4 fit|pg||
nt|flash: i believe it was Duboin who reportedly had the line of the year...|pg||
nt|flash: Zia's already taken 5 tricks, so USA has clinched at least a tie in this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: with NS playing precision there will be a delay in them finding their @d fit|pg||
nt|stigw: No, thats another question - but "meckwell" sometimes do starnge things (and usually come out successfully).|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: a prempt with an ace and a king on thee side and trump suit headed by jack may seem abnormal, but is often effective|pg||
nt|daman: in my youth I would have bid 5@C with the N hand and lucked out|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H = 4+ forcing, might have a longer minor|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe strange for general consumption but they are very disciplined within the structure|pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead will solve one problem|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: EW make 4@s easily enough, so NS's task is to locate a paying save|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 4+|pg||
nt|mrdct: if they do ever find it|pg||
nt|athene: but then @C10 switch|pg||
nt|othered1: right, but do EW let NS play it on other auctions?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: the spades are actually fairlky useful as the cards lie|pg||
nt|drewsky: my que bidding he is over bidding but will enusre that he at least gets to the correct game.|pg||
nt|xenya: well W has been warned...|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the bidding was simple|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps more of a clue now|pg||
nt|jbgood: is there a 12th?|pg||
nt|roswolf: there may well be on that lead|pg||
nt|jgc: yes...?|pg||
nt|flash: in New Orleans, during the 1st half of the semi-final match in the Spingold|pg||
nt|flash: Sementa had a blood-pressure spike and had to be taken to hospital|pg||
nt|flash: as they're wheeling him out, Duboin says:  Tonio - if you die, know that you played well today|pg||
pc|cA|nt|odysseus69: 2D probably checkback|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d probably artificial GF|pg||
nt|flash: this looks like a straightforward 11 (famous last words)|pg||
nt|flash: other matches:  3-0 USA and 2-2; so another good round for the USA |pg||
nt|psridhar: thats why 4s X -1 looks par|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on the nother hand....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@D may buy it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would think 2 @D logical bid now but oh well.....|pg||
nt|mrdct: interesting that east didn't act over 1@c|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: this hand might take a while|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Duck the first trick and @H towards the @H9 looks best|pg||
nt|mrdct: east will be keen to score a trick with the @s2 and may try to duck a @c and then play !A and try to ruff one in her hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: the better plan may be to fire @ds back at the defence|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good lead !|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcwla: This is the type of board where "or it makes or it doesn't" -- E's actions really surprising.|pg||
nt|mrdct: the defence need to be careful too not to get frisky with playing @h and giving south unwanted ruffs|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @ST return now? With the @S87 in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: I'm told we're awaiting a ruling on board 16|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: from OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Russell |pg||
nt|mrdct: @s10 is good as it sends the message to north that i have control of trumps - no ruffs needed|pg||
nt|athene: you have to rise the king to block them and play a diamond to the jack right away to set up a discard|pg||
nt|athene: maybe this is all findable|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't see why you should play for clubs 5-2|pg||
nt|jbgood: kibs disagree - from 11 to 13 tricks - tu:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mrdct: east will be analysing how 5@d will fare here|pg||
nt|mrt2000: W needs to go quietly here|pg||
nt|yvesj49: trump promotion|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: snap|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South shows 3 spades and thats enough info for North|pg||
nt|lml: by and large the hand lies well for duboin|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oh dear ....................|pg||
nt|mrt2000: can make 5 now|pg||
nt|athene: you might just rely on @CA and @CQ both onside|pg||
nt|flash: Europe leading 3-2 in our C match; we've had some problems with our B match broadcast, so i don't have a score for that|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|psridhar: excellent shift|pg||
nt|athene: sorry you have to play trumps first otherwise north gets a club ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the bidding suggests distribution held by the defenders|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but the bidding would have been the same if south had @Sx @HA10xxx @DAxx @CAQ109|pg||
nt|athene: and if he does, the winning line is to put the jack on the @C10|pg||
nt|athene: we don't have a play record from the other room|pg||
nt|athene: so we don't know if zia was put to the test and passed it brilliantly :)|pg||
nt|athene: if he did it will surely be bulletin material|pg||
nt|flash: 9 tricks available here|pg||
nt|flash: Europe wins the C Match - a first step toward recovering from last round's 0-3 record|pg||
nt|flash: still a big lead for USA, no matter the outcome of this match and the B match|pg||
pc|c5|nt|odysseus69: no problems here with 2 out of 3 finesses right and no bad breaks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: useful here to have two raises over the double - a good raise and a weak raise. It looks like EW have no such agreement|pg||
nt|athene: boink|pg||
nt|athene: ok, now it's time for Brogeland to be a hero|pg||
nt|athene: i don't honestly see any reason to guess this right|pg||
nt|jgc: Great line! But I thought it was Versace who said it.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: e.g, 2@s=weak raise, 2@h=good raise |pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: they are in 5@C doubled in the OR|pg||
nt|mrdct: -500 may still win the board|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lml: there are a number of choices but pretty well everything works|pg||
nt|rv: losing an extra @s trick, but avoided a @h ruff in bargain|pg||
nt|roswolf: i fancy 12|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bigtrain: no way do they reach 5@D|pg||
nt|stigw: Very good lead indeed.|pg||
nt|roswolf: down the middle!|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|jan_jansma: "psyching xxx in @D now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this is all about -1 vs -2|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2 off|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: yes there is a double squeeze but can declarer read it?|pg||
nt|flash: the defense can take their @H tricks early or late...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: yes -- there is room for either @HK or @DA in the S hand -- but taking a @H hook looks normal|pg||
nt|roswolf: the @D7 discard was a mistake|pg||
nt|flash: Zia on a @D guess to make 1NT - irrelevant to score on the board, but interesting; he gets it right!!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mrdct: auken wishing she had a better pip than the @S2|pg||
nt|mrdct: i prefer a @d rather than @h at this point|pg||
nt|mrdct: -1 inevitable now|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: in OR, someone apparently looked at wrong hand|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|lml: cashing the diamond ace is good|pg||
nt|flash: so USA need only push one of the two boards remaining at our comparison table to clinch a 2nd win this round|pg||
nt|flash: the third match is still tied|pg||
nt|flash: Helness-Fantoni in 5@C on board 17; Zia found the @H lead, so that will also fail and USA will clinch the match|pg||
mc|9|nt|daman: 5 was -1|pg||
nt|mrdct: on this board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: on brd 16|pg||
nt|flash: in a highly competitive auction, Helness - von Arnim reached 4@C as N-S on board 11|pg||
nt|psridhar: thx all bye|pg||
nt|othered1: USA has won this set (2 Buffett points).  |pg||
nt|othered1: Next set scheduled to begin at the bottom of the hour.  Bye for now.|pg||
