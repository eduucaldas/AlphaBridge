nt|Walddk2: must live with 1-½-0 on the scoreboard. I am sure you can figure it out regardless|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just multiply by 2|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: South was close to a bid, but he reckons that partner is still there.  |pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The inaugural event in 2006 in Ireland was won by USA, but Europe equalised two years later in Kentucky, USA|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you bid with S's hand David?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: It is close, but not really satisfactory to be shut out.|pg||
nt|hedyg: punish your pd for his t/o double?|pg||
nt|stigw: This needs a superdefence to best 3 nt, but very difficult to bid it.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Did he not want you to bid?!|pg||
nt|hedyg: if i had something, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzrd: S was not pausing|pg||
nt|brolucius: Nothing wrong with 2@H.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Terry|pg||

nt|haans: Operator Playing against which piars (compare with?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: pls ignore profile|pg||
nt|mamos: ah of course if the opp has the wrong declarer   -- we think its Rodwell the play won't work easily either :(|pg||
nt|haans: new for us all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: the twins often play canape iM openings so Diamonds then Spades shows long diamonds|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mamos: dummy may be a disappointment to declarer|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Justin asks about carding - didn't hear answer sorry!|pg||
nt|ady: even at this scoring I tht 3NT an unlikely spot    if South had the 4th club this would have been bad for the Hackets|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think "mostly upside down", but I could be wrong|pg||
nt|ady: or could have been|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: The competing teams, from Europe and the United States, consist of 12 players each and include one Womens pair and five Open pairs.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||

nt|mamos: wow|pg||
nt|haans: rare to bid 5m if 3nt possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin studies this trick in depth|pg||

nt|brolucius: Just because East has denied four spades is no reason why West should not describe her hand. Here it leads to +460 and a win on the board.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: missing a pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: East 2@H|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: When there are only around 2 tricks to be lost it is risky playing in a 5-3 major-suit fit and perhaps picking up 650 instead of 660.|pg||

mc|11|nt|stigw: But with a club-start there were 4 tricks to lose in NT.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
nt|udo: 2@C ( for majors) passed out in the other room|pg||
nt|rado: and when 430 vs 420 it's still 2:0 |pg||
nt|haans: First board to Norway|pg||
nt|rado: I meant win|pg||
nt|haans: USA still a good lead but Europe improving|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwi_joker: 1@S really? How quaint|pg||
nt|mamos: i think the twins are comparing with Levin and weinstein  who are playing Helgemo and Helness who have scored +130 in  3@D|pg||
nt|mamos: Europe won 16-8 this morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: very light 3rd pos 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: many guesses in @s contract|pg||
nt|rado: now E might bid some constructive fit raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. But Americanized, 1/2 added |pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
nt|ady: may be a heart guess for 10 or 11 tricks in spades|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kiwi_joker: hmmm|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: Mackwell cxomparing with Helgemo|pg||
nt|mamos: the twins play very aggressive 4 card majors  with 1NT 14-16 so open 1M on hands like this routinely|pg||
nt|udo: solid contract,,3@D|pg||
nt|stc: looks like a win for EW|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mamos: 1-0 to Europe  as Fantoni Nunes stopped in 2@S in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: even 10 points counts as a win so Justin trying for the NT bonus|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: this is a wild contest, reminds me "topgun" movie :) we will see best of bests|pg||
nt|ady: hackets have opted for no-trumps in this scoring method   might have come unsuck on a club lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: dont understand 2nt at all|pg||
nt|rado: maybe 4+fit and some defense:)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mamos: no heart guess now |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared.  Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||

pc|hA|nt|oliverc: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|stc: the good choice to play on @c|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mamos: the auction took some twists and turns - 3nt looked alikely contract   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hello welcome back|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|haans: Justin against Weinstein|pg||
nt|oliverc: this looks like a difficult game to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Sabine Auken sometimes visits USA, a nice lady from my unit 160, district 7 <Miss Joyce Hampton> hires her for top events and they win&scratch in teams|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kiwi_joker: Am told 2@C is a mixed raise, 3 cards|pg||

nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brolucius: 1@C would show 14+ for North.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: 2@c= (9)10-13, unbalanced|pg||
nt|brolucius: All one-of-a-suit bids show 14+ for North-South. An amazing system, but it seems to work!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: difficult bid for Nunes, 3@s can be too high already|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|stigw: 4 cl N/S is the par contract I think, but will you land there, or can E-W sacrifce proftably ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni has some nice defensive values|pg||
nt|hedyg: check out a @d lead..|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s X -3?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S looks right on the West cards - but, of course, bidding is not a precise science.|pg||

nt|henryb:  good morning all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|brolucius: The tempo of the auction was altered by it starting at the two-level. After 1@C - (1@S) - 2@S, you would not expect E/W to end in 4@S. |pg||
nt|brolucius: This line-up would grace a Bermuda Bowl final.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|mamos: again 3NT looks an obvious place to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers asks about leads; "3rd and 5th"|pg||

pc|s3|nt|mamos: and there are plent of tricks  is slam out of the question?|pg||
nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|stc: best lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: today bobby levin and alan sontag starred about the opening leads|pg||
nt|oliverc: Difficult to get the hand wrong, though|pg||
nt|udo: if she places @C king with south,,she can win and finesse @H for @C discard,,has to risk diamond to hand and hope they are not 5-0|pg||
nt|stc: the Q is if you take the hook in @h or not|pg||
nt|oliverc: right|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes but @d lead would help declarer, pitches @c|pg||

nt|mamos: Meckstroth Rodwell 's +140 beat Helegemo Helness' 130 on Board 1  to win the first board for them  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: fantoni would obviously try to knock out @h AK|pg||

nt|brolucius: If anyone else had bid 4@S, I would describe it as a poor bid.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|brolucius: North bid 3@S at the other table and South passed (quite rightly).|pg||
nt|hedyg: you might expect pd to have more than he has and better @ss too|pg||
nt|brolucius: South cannot count anything for his doubleton heart because North is surely short in hearts as well, after the raise. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes indeed, but this is basically matchpoints, so it's normally wrong to chase thin games|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S does not promise much when one of the defenders comes in over 2@H - 3@H. Someone has to bid the combined values.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree with David|pg||
nt|stigw: Zias raise to 3 H had a provocative effect on the opps.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H was off 1|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe one does not always have to bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not saying that 4@S can't be right, but I also think one should show some restraint with this format, not least when you have as many slow values as Nunes as|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *has|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lack of aces and kings|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think both NS and S have difficult decisions here|pg||
nt|stigw: May be he can hold it to down 2 only, to safe ½ a point.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Suppose the bidding had gone 3@H - Pass - Pass - 3@S. You would not consider a raise to 4@S. And this is a similar auction.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meckwell are known as aggressive bidders, so when even Rod passed I think it's fair to say that 4@S was an overbid|pg||
nt|hedyg: give N the K@s instead of a small @c, would he not bid the same?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but the format matters|pg||
nt|brolucius: Over pre-emption you often bid on the assumption that your partner will hold around 8 points. So, North has to bid 4@S at some stage, rather than rely on partner to raise on 8 ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: points and no particular fit. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would understand 4@S red at IMPs|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure it does, i just mean the decision is not easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bridge is a difficult game; one should try to learn it some day :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I think it is very easy and completely clear-cut. North's 3@S is a form of protection. He would bid more with the @SK and a six-card suit, since he needs only a card or two ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: elsewhere to make game.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This defence will force declarer to bang down tha @sA and limit his trump losers to 2 only, says Murat Molva. He could be right|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, as Roland pointed out, you cannot bid 4@S because 15% of the time you can make it (when playing matchpoints). That will give you a bad board the other 85% of the time.|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s9|nt|brolucius: Glen Ashton tells me that 1@H does not guarantee 14+ points because when they hold four spades and five hearts, they have to open 1@H even on 11-13 points. This is a change made ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: because of bad results obtained when they held the other major too and opened at the two-level.|pg||
nt|petergill: @S87 are useful|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What can you say other than 'well done' as the cards lie|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is not a great game by any means|pg||
nt|stigw: Extremely friendly sitz, no wonder the European girls missed that game.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Hamman's fourth heart was not automatic. He did well.|pg||
nt|petergill: There's no reason to mispick the trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For new spectators. Number of boards in the Teams has been cut down from 14 to 12 per session as the players have requested longer breaks. Start times unchanged|pg||
nt|brolucius: When you stop (quite reasonably) in 2@H, it is annoying to find so many cards right and you have to write +200 in your card.|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|stigw: But not by Hamman.|pg||
nt|brolucius: "And enjoy it when the commentators make a mistake," a kibitzer tells me. How cruel.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: When you play 2@C for majors and 2@d to ask for the longer one, you can play the delayed 2@S as being a bit more encouraging than an immediate 2@S. |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Zia regrets doubling 2@d, would rather be in 3@C undoubled|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: He might make it now|pg||
nt|stigw: He has shown 4 di and 5 Cl, I think - else he would have followed with 2 nt over 2 sp for the minors.|pg||
nt|petergill: Some specs predict that Hamman will make this|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|stigw: Dont believe it, even after this promissing start.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3 spades, two hearts, two heart ruffs and two top diamonds = nine tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: but might need to keep a spade entry for the last heart ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, he needed that extra trick in spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would also lead a spade I must confess|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When you have trump length it is often right to lead from your long side suit|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|petergill: but not as often as people say - |pg||
nt|brolucius: True, but sometimes better when you have four trumps rather than five.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he mistimed it now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe I am wrong|pg||
nt|brolucius: When you have five, declarer cannot draw trumps and may be able to score his trumps separately.|pg||
nt|petergill: I would have led a heart, partner's five card suit on the bidding|pg||
nt|stigw: You might have a point, that he could have made 3 di at that point.|pg||
nt|petergill: Best to cash the clubs now|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer reasonably enough was playing the doubler for the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They don't have the hand records. So much easier for us|pg||
nt|stigw: Has Nunes showed a doubleton cl by now, I wonder ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Their card says 'low = even on declarer's leads'.|pg||
nt|petergill: @C4 was Reverse Smith, saying he doesn't like spades |pg||
nt|petergill: but it's hard for North to read that @C4 was a high club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni is known as a very careful (some call it 'slow') player, but he almost always comes out of the tank with the right answers|pg||
nt|petergill: they play Reverse Smith against both trump and no trump contracts, David|pg||
nt|brolucius: Certainly worth thinking on this contract - although some would say that all boards are equal at matchpoints.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter Gill and Fantoni would never be able to finish a session if they were partners :)|pg||
nt|petergill: North does not have the club count, and might well think that East has two clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry Peter, could not resist|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would seemingly reduce their effectiveness in defence if the first signal was always Smith. On this particular hand it would prove a hindrance, for example. North does not know ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: how many clubs South has.  |pg||
nt|petergill: A spade back would remove a vital entry, how about a @d back?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Smith is only mentioned as a sub-note, not in the main table of signals.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A heart will give Hamman the tempo again|pg||
nt|petergill: @C4 was Reverse Smith, i.e. it said "I do not like spades, the suit I led."|pg||
nt|brolucius: But South did play high from his clubs, so you may be right.|pg||
nt|petergill: As they play Slawinsky Leads, a corollary is to use Reverse Smith on all hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni is obviously not convinced regarding the club position|pg||
nt|petergill: NS Convention Card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|stigw: Fantoni might think, that Hamman has got 4-card-di.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So Nunes has not necessarily shown a doubleton|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|stigw: Still some work to be done.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too much, don't you think?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's touch and go|pg||
nt|petergill: Slawinsky Leads (sorry about my spelling) are: low pip lead = even number without honour or odd number with honour|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|c5|pc|s5|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|sQ|nt|petergill: @H8 at Trick 2 was a forced card (i.e. he had not choice of what card to play) - he could not afford the play the ten, so the Reverse Smith was at Trick 3 not Trick 2|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: Zia will keep the @d cover, Hamman will keep the club cover, and Fantoni will have to guess who has what.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East would have led a diamond from Q-J-10.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|petergill: Zia is quite capable of baring @CK here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Fantoni may well get this right now.|pg||
nt|stigw: Man or mouse ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fascinating|pg||
nt|petergill: The question is  - who has @CK? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I hope you are all enjoying this, specs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is great bridge|pg||
nt|petergill: North knows East had 3 clubs to West's 3 clubs = 4/7 chance that East has @CK|pg||
nt|brolucius: East would not squeeze his partner down to bare @CK. He would retain his diamonds.|pg||
nt|petergill: so I think he will finesse|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: :)   a two up transfer :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Pass is a sure thing|pg||
nt|oliverc: Auken perhaps not counting the hand right there. partner HAS to have either the K|pg||
nt|oliverc: or J of Spades to make up their 1@C Opening|pg||
mb|2D|nt|h_karluk: normally many people plays it xfer to spades|pg||
nt|stc: this is how you win 100 times the cavendish|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: as Bob read it|pg||
nt|mamos: not necessarily Hamdi  may be cue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if Bob would open 1N then things would be easy, ie uncontested 1N>3@h mild slam invite for clubs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that'|pg||
nt|h_karluk: s also true Mike|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so there's not a novel layout problem, but the matter is to tell yr clubs to partner|pg||
nt|mamos: if you play $C@C for @H and @d for @S  makes sense to play the other way round too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure, you know it all depends partnership agreements|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and you are not sure about @c A, K|pg||

mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: http://www.masterpointpress.com/general/bbum.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: if you roll the dice and bid slam then in the newspapers, if goes down would feel worst, because the players there know their business very well|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: well  you'd want to be playing with a partner with whom you had very secure agreements on this auction ........|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I don't think anyone has the luxury to take an adventure |pg||
nt|h_karluk: still 6NT, presumably very hard to lead a @d from KJx ternace|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in case 5@s misread|pg||
nt|oliverc: Do we know exactly what 4@H meant?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : tenace|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no we do not know|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: sorry, no discussions|pg||
nt|h_karluk: its ok, no worries|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|haans: that 4@D looks costly|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 2@D shows 9 cards either way|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of bidding on a 20-20 hand|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: surprised they didnt double 4@D (at this form of scoring).|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pass saves the day|pg||
nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: not the fastest auction in the world|pg||
nt|ady: n/s can make 11 tricks in hearts    but might settle for 10?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: this could be a breakpoint, in case @dJ lead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mamos: Zia knows what he has   we know what he has   |pg||
nt|oliverc: -1 now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mamos: but Bob clearly did not|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which in practice as i said very very hard to lead from that KJ9 tenace to set it|pg||
nt|oliverc: indeed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe they were not reading the same book (Bob&Zia)|pg||
nt|oliverc: so ruffing high and exiting with the Q@S should have been a sensible line of defence|pg||
nt|haans: clubs finesse win or lose the board :)|pg||
nt|ady: lot of trumps coming now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mamos: or perhaps he did and risked 6NT   not inconceivable at this form of scoring|pg||

mb|3D|an|asking|nt|h_karluk: Boca Raton Florida players lucky, this year i was busy a lot, hope in 2011 will visit there to see some familiar faces, including Larry Mori, SC-FL not much distance|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: routine 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: no we started at 15   so although session length has been changed 14  we have two to play after thisboards to 12 |pg||
