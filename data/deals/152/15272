nt|haans: Wednesday starting with USD leading 60-48 Buffett Points 100 Buffett Points to win|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|pef: we're about to start the last individual match of the day, where members of each team pair up with a new partner each match|pg||
nt|bernix: welcome to session 6 of buffet cup|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Rashed|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Rashed :)|pg||
nt|haans: Sucken have no good bid|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yesterday, we saw Sabine lead the @ST from KTx of dummy's bid @S suit which held QJ-sixth.  Daniela won the A and returned a low one and declarer understandably pitched a side ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: loser, losing to Sabine's K and could only comment, "That was sexy."|pg||
nt|bernix: europe has amassed a large deficit of 18 BPs. so we have to make up ground NOW|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mamos: just us talking to ourselves :)|pg||
nt|haans: Aucken|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Cornelia and Haans.|pg||

nt|vugraphzrh: Jill is checking convention card ....|pg||
nt|pef: test|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: so is Fred|pg||
nt|pef: gitelman and levin's partners in this match are Bob Hamman and Bobby Levin|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what a hand, 4@H EW as the cards are placed and good save in minors for NS.|pg||
nt|rado: N may blast to 3NT now|pg||
nt|bernix: 6 BPs at stage per session, a 6-0 would help our cause|pg||
nt|april7: slamish|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: they have landed right|pg||
nt|chick: nice choice by Auken ... with N showing 4 hearts, she chooses to show the diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: von Arnom knows only 40 hcp exist but ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Tricky hand and difficult for W to pass 2@D.|pg||
nt|haans: Arnim|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|bernix: welcome back to buffet cup, session 8|pg||
mb|5H|nt|haans: simple clubs raise?|pg||
nt|haans: pass a good option|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|chick: N has pretty much described his hand, except for about an A worth of value, but with his partner passing 2@D, I don't think he has much left to say|pg||
nt|sybarra: bjr yves |pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: 3Nt looks ok here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: Fantoni may lead small @H at trick 2|pg||
nt|bernix: usa need 11 more bps to win the trophy. europe need 29 bps|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: Hi Victor|pg||
nt|haans: all cards wrong :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if defence is accurate then 3 down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: +3|pg||
nt|bernix: unlucky - but normal - lead|pg||
nt|april7: can't bid 7, because of missing K of trumps|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kiwi_joker: not a lot of specs .. i think I have enough biscuits to go around everyone, in fact|pg||
nt|spooky: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi shirley|pg||
pc|s6|nt|odysseus69: Hi Hans|pg||
nt|bernix: fantoni needs to find the @h switch now. should be routine|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@d at this table and 2@h at the OR|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|daman: just a @S p/s for NS?   East took one too many bids|pg||
nt|mamos: yep looks like -300|pg||
nt|daman: difficult to understand whay he would bid 4@C|pg||
nt|daman: siff @S and Qxx of @D is better|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|janm:  NS have pushed them to 5@H which will almost certainly go down exactly 1|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: yep|pg||
pc|c2|nt|spooky: 3NT looks like making, only a @C lead from south would set it.|pg||
nt|daman: t*|pg||
nt|yvesj49: nice event|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwi_joker: well you cant really find yourself in a room where 'dud' players are in action ... as this event features 24 of the world's very best|pg||
nt|mamos: are we linked to the correct table ?|pg||
nt|mamos: i thought the twins were always scoring agianst Levin and Weinstein|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: other room looks to have started with a precision 2@C, and someohow they couldnt put the brakes on before reaching a hopelessly optimistic 6C|pg||
nt|spooky: but Brogeland took his "safe"plus scoe in 3@D|pg||
nt|haans: but non vulnerable :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bridge a funny game - Jx of @H's part of the thinking to go back to 2@S but @HJ turns out to be highly useful card.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Indeed eliminates a @D loser, as it is.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|yvesj49: where we can see the best world's players|pg||
pc|c9|pc|hA|nt|mamos: sorry  been eating too much lunchh  only eight tricks in NT  apologies|pg||
nt|drewsky: no Mike, 3NT is indeed cold|pg||

nt|mamos: so 5@H was making six I think|pg||
nt|drewsky: Looks like -500 against +480 ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: welcome back |pg||

nt|rv: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi all|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hard to stay in a part score on this board|pg||
nt|april7: ace and ace of @S safety play, to dangerous to go to J of @C for a discard of @Hx on @D ace|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: 3@C+1@H+2@S=6 -3 I think.|pg||

pc|s8|pc|h5|pc|s9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|janm:  This is an opportunity for EW at the other table, although it looks to me as if NS can make 4@s if they guess the stiff club K - no reason to do so however, so selling to 4@s will almost certainly win the board for EW|pg||

nt|haans: new board now|pg||
nt|mamos: just too much from Justin there|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I think so |pg||
nt|jcwla: The N hand playable in three different strains, contains a void, and the @H suit represents a small fraction of its values with nothing on top.  |pg||

nt|janm:  We can expect the play to continue at this brisk pace in this last match of the even this year. The US has already won, so they're playing these last matches "for fun" and speedily.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: bidding 4@C on that hand is like found money for the opps     getting something for nothing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|Walddk5: East is Justin Hackett|pg||
nt|bernix: looks like something went wrong :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: 3 off I believe|pg||
nt|bernix: yes|pg||
nt|drewsky: Why do you say that..down 3 looked norma|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: this look like a likely 4H game|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: 6@C possible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They are both   J  Hackett|pg||
nt|janm:  Seeing Nunes name, I started to say that 1@h was forcing, but of course in the individual everyone plays a simple, standard system|pg||
nt|janm:  Did Zia really pass this out?|pg||
nt|janm:  Din't think so!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rv: transfer responses here, 1@h shows 4+@s|pg||
nt|Walddk5: But North is Hampson|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pef: ah, that makes a bit more sense|pg||
nt|rado: 4@H with @S guess|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: they could be trying a posible 3NT contract from West hand |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: X will come from W|pg||
nt|bernix: von arnim could bid it knowing partner must have 'some' values|pg||
nt|bernix: X has disadvantage that she still doesnt know what to do over 3@s|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true a problem of space |pg||
nt|bernix: on my screen it was -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H can be beateb on spade lead|pg||
nt|drewsky: ONLY if played by south|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good bid west|pg||
nt|yvesj49: NS are out of 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: Individual: Each player on Team Europe is drawn to compare with a particular player on Team USA. A player does not meet the player with whom he or she compar|pg||
nt|yvesj49: WITH 25 COUNT|pg||
nt|yvesj49: if i play i don't want to be compared with fantoni lol|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: or 6@H|pg||
nt|mamos: although  Americans are in 4@C x at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Fred is playing in Match A|pg||
nt|rado: strange no Drury used?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: pass surprising |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: I think her 3 card @C makes her pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Brogeland's 1@s denies 4@s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Henry, welcome.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Got it right now|pg||
nt|pef: a rather speculative double from Duboin assuming that's not an anomaly|pg||
nt|bernix: they are using a standardized cc most propably w/o drury|pg||
mb|4S|nt|spooky: 1@S shows 3@S|pg||
nt|rv: with 4 he would have jumped to 2@s and with 2 would have rebid 1n or 2m|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: weird that Brogeland didn't open 1NT, they play 15-17...|pg||
nt|rv: Levin-Weinstein compared with Duboin-Sementa and Brogeland-Saelensmide with Sontag-Berk|pg||
nt|rv: play of @h suit critical for OT in this contract|pg||
nt|ady: Europe should win the board 5@C  at least down 2|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D Bourke = just GF bid|pg||
nt|daman: Berkowicz|pg||
nt|drewsky: There is no winning defense here.|pg||
nt|mamos: North South may regret this |pg||
nt|drewsky: NOT suprisingly, a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: it's about the overtrick in this lay out|pg||
nt|mamos: the scoring method has led to many NT contracts  as players hunt for the magic +10 points|pg||
nt|daman: easy to figure this 3rd and 5th|pg||
nt|rado: other table will open E hand probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: cc was consulted by Fulvio before bidding 3H|pg||
nt|drewsky: Perhaps you need lasek surgery ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: we were on "manual" here - sorry|pg||
nt|janm:  Now will Jill raise to game?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: holy ... 2nt natural?|pg||
nt|chick: looks like just one diamond loser, and perhaps a heart loser|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sound 4@S with @H guess can make 6.|pg||
nt|haans: odds against doing right in hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true. 10 @H very vital card.|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: In every case the four individuals at one table have their corresponding opponent sitting in the same seat at the matching table. |pg||
nt|april7: S might misssguess the @H position|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: Berk made the same bad 4@C bid|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: some spects say Est could of bid 3@D|pg||
nt|bernix: saelesmind made 8 tricks in 1n on board 13 to win the fist point for europe|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: I presume Levin will duck @h to @hK smoothyl|pg||
nt|pef: well 5c would have been a good save|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rnmalik: Good lead.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rv: smoothly|pg||
nt|mamos: getting too high ?|pg||
nt|mamos: and indeed identical auction  -- I suppose thats mor likely with standard systems|pg||
nt|april7: S could try first to develop adiscard of @Hx on @C K which doesn't work and then try @H and might go down|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yvesj49: nice organization|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcwla: Instead of wishing physical harm on your enemy, just wish that Sabine leads to all their contracts.|pg||
nt|bernix: careful unblocking enables auken to make 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|drewsky: Levin has had 2 painful defensive hands in 2 boards.|pg||
nt|april7: very helpful switch, now  S will make it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwi_joker: unless South is very much asleep when declarer plays a heart from dummy later on, this will go -1|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mamos: wheels have come off here|pg||
nt|april7: @d continuation wouldn't give anything away|pg||
pc|hK|nt|spooky: this helps declarer|pg||
nt|rv: after South's @H9, Brogeland may just get it right|pg||
nt|rv: ah, easy now for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Pairs, Teams and Individual events in Warren Buffet Cup, all scoring is BAM style|pg||
nt|rv: so OTs and UTs very crucial, this form of scoring is lot tougher than IMPs and a bit tougher than Pairs (MPs)|pg||
nt|rv: if you make 8 tricks in 2@s and your opps make same 8 tricks in NT, you get 0 BAM points|pg||
nt|haans: 54% for this slam|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event. Have a look|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer will have to sniff out Heart position for a good score|pg||
nt|daman: he will sniff it out by default|pg||
nt|daman: he will not risk his contract   and in so doing will drop the @H King|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That would be +2 and good score.|pg||

nt|westjava: hi Haans and every one|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: would have been interesting if KH played on 10H|pg||
nt|mamos: Sontag and Berkowicz in 4@H so looks irrelevant how many tricks   he makes here|pg||
nt|pef: I'm not sure why the other table scoring isn't showing up here, but assuming the matching table is  Open room, the europeans won the first board by competing to 4c and going down 1|pg||
nt|april7: @S!|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bernix: but not necessary with meckstroth going down in 4@h in OR|pg||

nt|drewsky: East assumed that clubs was trumps all along|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|odysseus69: is there any reason to get hearts wrong?|pg||
nt|pef: interesting point of the hand, it looks like hampson needs to take a diamond finesse now, giving up on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|bernix: to repeat a so-so 5-card suit on the 3-level is not my style|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets she what is the move on the other table in board 14 |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|rnmalik: N 's hand is counted 5@S+4@D+2@C +2@H|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|pef: I guess not, although if east had ducked the heart it would ahve been more interesting|pg||

nt|sybarra: The total of Buffett points over four days is 198. When a team reaches 100 points, it has won the Trophy. |pg||
nt|yvesj49: with BAM bareme ?|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Rubber Bridge:)|pg||

nt|Walddk5: I have the pairings here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: x was rather optimistic, x by W of 2@H was instrumental.|pg||
nt|april7: we had it shown already,3NT by EW|pg||
nt|janm:  Needed one more club in the south hand and it would have been easy|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|kiwi_joker: Whether you bid an immed 3H or 4H on these hands, depends on how much you like 7-4-1-1 shapes|pg||

nt|yvesj49: not the best par score for NS|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W are three or four down in a major suit contract|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: leads are 1,3,5 but not easy for W he can see singleton card @D in the declarer |pg||
mb|4D|nt|jameslee 2: I really think West needs to make a move & X there even with only 2card @S|pg||
nt|bernix: do they use 2@d 3rd suit forcing ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: its a 12 trick contract here on board 15 |pg||
nt|bernix: 6@c is one of two finesses|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: could be in 6NT direct from E|pg||
nt|bernix: if you do not use '3rd suit forcing', what do you bid with jason's hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: as bernard says could bid a 3rd new suit forcing but has in mind 6nt sure |pg||

nt|Walddk5:  The overall score before this round is USA 85   65 Europe. 100 points wins the cup.|pg||
nt|pef: she faced the problem of penalty doubling 2d or continuing with the limit raise in spades plan.  the former would have been the dinner here, but the vulnerability made it difficult|pg||
nt|pef: 3S also being played at the other table|pg||

nt|Walddk5: It takes 5 seconds|pg||

nt|mamos: someone made the point the other day that if the opponents bid and support a suit  but dont lead it  you learn a lot about their holdings in most cases|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|ady: south in difficulties   needed to discard another spade    not easy|pg||

nt|drewsky: 6:20 am here....still on my first cup of cafe|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|janm:  Let's see - spade to the A, ruff a spade, diamonds, heart to the K last diamond - East can spare 2 spades & a club on the diamonds, but then Q of hearts and 3 rounds of clubs will force him to lead a heart in|pg||
nt|henryb:  or rather she|pg||
nt|henryb:  cannot anymore, I think|pg||
nt|janm:  The club K gives her a pretty good idea of how the clubs lie, but is she running out of dummy entries? Win the club, cross in hearts to ruff the spade, but then won't have an entry to pull the last trump before putting East in -|pg||
nt|henryb:  she could have. @hQ, @s ruff, @dJ, @hK, @dA throwing @c, @c-K-A|pg||
nt|janm:  What about A of clubs, Q of hearts, spade ruff, diamond to the A, clulb off - West can't ruff, |pg||
nt|henryb:  and East has been squeezed down to Jx in bor round suits, can be thrown in with either to lead into the remailning tenace|pg||
nt|janm:  I know she could have made it to begin with, but what about now - some alert specs have suggested ducking this trick. Then if West leads a spade, she can ruff, cash the diamond J, cross to the heart for the diamond A - East will have pitched a s|pg||
nt|henryb:  out of entries for the squeeze|pg||
nt|janm:  spade on the diamond J, will have to pitch a club on the diamond A, but still has both clubs and hearts under control - I think she had to ruff the spade earlier in order to have another entry to pull the last trump|pg||
nt|henryb:  besides West can exit with a heart|pg||

nt|jcwla: Seems like the wires got crossed.|pg||
nt|pef: europe is up 2 to 1 in match A and 3 to 2 in match C, so this round may signal a badly needed comeback for the Europeans|pg||
nt|pef: I believe the score here is 1.5  to 1.5 but we'll see|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a good 4@S from South defending 4@H|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H=620|pg||
nt|mamos: just about number of tricks i guess|pg||
nt|bernix: 10 i reckon|pg||

pc|c5|nt|ady: with spades 3-3   and hearts 3-2  this looks like 12 tricks|pg||
nt|westjava: 10 tricks after @D lead|pg||
nt|haans: playing clubs to KQ|pg||
nt|yvesj49: yes very surprizing lol|pg||
nt|pef: actually 1 to 1 the way it's being scored|pg||

nt|westjava: 3@C, 3@D, 4@S|pg||
nt|janm:  I see 9 for declarer and I don't think there's time for the defenders as long as declarer ducks the secon diamond|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|henryb:  Brogeland in the other room won the @sA and led a @c. When the K popped, he won A, drew three rounds of trumps, @hK, @s ruff, @hQ, @dA and Rodwell conceded|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rv: if Brogeland runs the @h suit, Weinstein has enough opportunities to signal @ds|pg||
nt|ady: might now run 8@S  |pg||
nt|jcwla: So on 2, where Duboin went down 4 in 3@H, in the OR it went 2@H around to a double by von Arnim and 2@S by Nunes, making 3 on a 3-3 fit for not enough.  A win to USA there.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pef: hampson can make 5 here for the win, but he'll have to guess remarkably well in trumps to do so|pg||
nt|pef: sorry, I mean to make 4 for the tie|pg||

nt|spooky: oh,,,|pg||
nt|spooky: didn't expect that|pg||
nt|rv: can't be true|pg||
nt|rv: Weinstein has disc @s and played lo-hi in @hs, not sure if all this indicates @d preference to @cs|pg||
nt|rv: this is assuming Levin wins @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Mike Gold|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi venky and Roland|pg||
nt|spooky: he played spades 6-5 and @H 7-J, don't think there was suit preference somewhere, not sure tho|pg||
nt|spooky: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: and gernbrand |pg||
nt|rv: thinking aloud, would it helped Weinstein to play @Hj and @hx to indicate @d preference|pg||
nt|rv: not sure of their SP methods, many partnerships play smith-echo or rev smith-echo in nt contracts to indicate continuation of suit or shifts in obvious / non-obvious suits|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure Levin-Weinstein have detailed defensive agreements, this deal will test those agreements|pg||
nt|rv: he needs to win @SA though:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I see i have arrived at the kill point|pg||
nt|spooky: winning @SA is not the problem I think.. i think he is wondering what to switch|pg||
nt|rv: yes Mike, you can give your perspective on carding agreements|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rv: I much like play suggested by Hop, play second @s early|pg||
nt|spooky: wow, it's made now|pg||
nt|bernix: i prefer berko's 3@c overcall but maybe they are using different conventions over 1nt opener|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|janm:  Jill knows she isn't going to want to lead hearts, so pitches one to give Zia a count on the suit as quickly as possible - thoughtful play|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|odysseus69: going for maximum|pg||
nt|westjava: now 2@C, 3@D, 1@H and 4@S|pg||

nt|odysseus69: better-cash heart|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no score for board 3 from open room - did I see 4Dx -2|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|pef: well now that won't happen, so a win for europe on the board and they go up by a board with 2 to go|pg||
nt|bernix: i think the same sacrifice will be found in OR|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rv: even the best can get it wrong, some consolation for lesser mortals like us|pg||
nt|westjava: I think connection not so good from the hotel (Miskin Manor Hotel, near Cardiff)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: might settle for 11 |pg||
nt|bernix: 11 tricks with @s10 lead in OR|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: well i dont know what happened earlier in the hand but my dog says 2 men play same suit one man crazy|pg||
nt|jcwla: With AT7 of @H's and two cards below a 7, 2NT by von Arnim looks pretty good in the rearview mirror.|pg||
nt|bernix: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: as was made in OR|pg||
nt|yvesj49: !!|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h5|nt|westjava: 3 points after 3 boards, very dominant europe on this table!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: declarer does not know where club ace is or that spades are breaking- he may be worried|pg||
nt|westjava: they are having a few technical problems, sorry for this inconvinience...|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now N-S are in charge|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||

nt|vugraphzrh: stress here is getting to the players - calling for water and pills!!!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rv: Brogeland could have won BAM point easily by passing 3@s and getting a plus, he has won it the hard way by bidding and making 3n|pg||

nt|bernix: europe still needs a halved board to clinch the match|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|kiwi_joker: EW should finish in 4@S here|pg||

nt|rnmalik: yes @H lead and 10 @D to Ace@D, making five.|pg||

mb|4H|nt|mamos: Jason didnt open the South hand  at another table    |pg||
nt|spooky: I wouldn't pass with a 7crd suit in this situation.. would you?|pg||

nt|haans: thats why DONT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I was interested to see what Helgemo would lead v 1NT - Helness spoiled it|pg||

nt|drewsky: This is the Indivdual portion of the contest, and all of the players have to play identical systems set forth by the organizers.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mamos: defence had some chance of keeping this to nine  tricks on Club leads  but ten more likely|pg||

nt|chick: from N's point of view, E may not have an entry to the last club|pg||
nt|haans: but does not no if to play @D or not|pg||
nt|janm:  6@h needs the clubs to behave, or the spade finesse, but I'd be surprised if anyone got there |pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|haans: @D = jump this suit|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder what the @D3 actually means in their signal system|pg||
nt|haans: you do not kill the diamond suit yourselve if good in diamond|pg||
nt|rnmalik: It has to be a shift and @S looks reasonable.|pg||
nt|chick: that's the question Rashed, does it just ask for a shift, or does it indicate which suit.   |pg||
nt|chick: and if you were sitting S, which suit would you want to signal for?  :)|pg||

nt|bernix: only within the team|pg||
nt|bernix: the american system differs from the european|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: Keep in mind that this is BAM, which means an extra trick wins the hand.|pg||
nt|chick: This is the most tense form of bridge, because even a tiny mistake can make the difference in a full win or loss of the board point|pg||
nt|jcwla: It just got easier.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I am result oriented:)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rv: of Weinstein doesn't know the result in OR and is trying his best to make the best of a inferior contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think he must have had the same thoughtas 3 commentators|pg||

nt|rv: are not played|pg||
nt|spooky: I played board a match once, and it's really fun, but you have no idea what they do at the other table, because everybody is trying to score the point every board..|pg||
nt|rv: yes Hop, this form of scoring is most definitely bleeding-edge, a bit tougher than even MPs where field does protect you to some extent|pg||
