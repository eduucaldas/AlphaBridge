mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|dburn: brave effort by East, that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Top four after this round qualify for the semi-finals on Sunday|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: yes, unusual|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: Open Pairs all day tomorrow|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: would tend to deny interest in hearts, so 2@h looks  a bit odd  |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: South's sequence may look odd, but he would have opened 2@c with a limited hand - this shows 16+ with clubs|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: but 3@s is... well, it is optimistic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: caters for North having Jxxxxx and out|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: so it does - I guess if you're going to bid, 3@s is what you should bid, but...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's when partner doesn't have the Jxxxxx and out that you might have a problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: if N had the singleton @H he was supposed to have he might well have had @s length|pg||
nt|dburn: in truth, the pattern of the auction at the other table was the same - here, though, East's 1NT had raised everything an octave|pg||
nt|mdgraham: like when he has a fistful of diamonds and out....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although 2@C in the other room showed 17+|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Hanlon-McGann play two-way club where 1@C is either 11-13 balanced or any 17+|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Polish Club is three-way|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|dburn: still, what with one thing and another South is in a position to make the hand if...|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dburn: ...he puts the king on this trick, which he did|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl//wyniki/turnieje/2010/wilno/team/teamrunda7.html  5 teams battling for 4 spots|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c7|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rather well done by South|pg||
mc|10|nt|dburn: and which he would not have done if East had not bid - but if East had not bid, the contract would have been 2@c or 3@c and not 4@c|pg||

nt|haans: team names to see player names|pg||
nt|andersk: I like to open 15-17 NT with east hand here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back, Tez|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1H|nt|haans: right now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 1 strongish NT is certainly possible here, if your system allows it.  Mine doesn't with M 2-2.|pg||
nt|andersk: In Lithuania many probably play polish club, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: Results can be seen here  http://www.pzbs.pl//wyniki/turnieje/2010/wilno/team/teamleaderb.html|pg||
nt|ybob: yes polish|pg||
nt|andersk: was 1 @H alerted?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.pzbs.pl//wyniki/turnieje/2010/wilno/team/teamrunda6.html  for running scores. Hold your mouse over the team names and you will get the players|pg||
nt|othered1: EW now will have plenty of room to find their @H game|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 6@S makes imo.|pg||
nt|haans: but not 6@H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No:)|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like a transfer to @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: I think it wasnt|pg||
nt|othered1: There's a case for defending with south hand.  They have bid one of your long suits.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|dburn: would have expected North to do something, even if 1@d could be only three cards|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Rehi!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: life is not fair|pg||
nt|othered1: Perhaps we should ask what 1@C implied|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: EW doing their best to push them to 6.|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no alert, but W looks angry|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: Sorry it was alerted|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ybob: short 1 trick i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: And it was a transfer to spades|pg||
nt|andersk: strange 2 NT, imo|pg||
nt|othered1: Very aggressive, if natural (unless it shows 17-18 or so)|pg||
nt|ybob: upgrade |pg||
nt|dburn: but it probably would not matter all that much what he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: upgrade when you got a double behind you, still strange|pg||
nt|othered1: 8 tricks and needs help for a chance at 9|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe 1@H shows values too 7+ and E shows 18 hcp bal|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andersk: I dont count as well as you, Ed!  I can only count 6 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: well not easy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 2 Aces and a K with N and pass. Otherwise difficult to visulise the hand with S.|pg||
nt|othered1: It's strong, I'm told, which explains the 2@C bid|pg||
nt|jacksond: 1c =11-13 balanced or any 17+|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, two-way club|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: 1 Club is 11-13 bal or 17+|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But strong when he bid 2@C|pg||
pc|hT|nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W had no good lead, without helping declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: A natural auction might let you out a level or two lower|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: some say never lead singel with singel trumph|pg||
nt|othered1: north shows his "entry" in @D?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: 4@h looks like 10 tricks and a save in 5@c looks correct|pg||
nt|othered1: I think it's take it or lose it in @D right now.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry 5@d - misclich - a bad keyboard|pg||
nt|ralfwil: look at this  - MISCLICK:)|pg||
nt|othered1: doesn't it look like @D underlead is the only likely way to beat it?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: absolutely correct.|pg||
nt|ybob: i think 2NT probably denies 3@S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: The cards shown wont give South players much joy|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: David Jackson is the Ireland NPC, so welcome to you too|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|othered1: I was including the eventual @H trick, perhaps prematurely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: McGann-Hanlon have been the anchor pair in Ireland for a long time but missed out on selection for the Europeans this summer|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|ybob: S know J@C on N|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andersk: I agree to upgrade hands, however the D indicates this is not the time to upgrade|pg||
nt|tez: if return club best defence|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|tez: he makes now|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|s6|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Tez|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: if only South had doubled before East had opened...|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|andersk: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: But he hadn't heard the double when he chose that track with the opening bid.  And he may not have had any other descriptive out at that point|pg||

nt|april7: weak 2 opener|pg||
nt|haans: re all|pg||
nt|ybob: can declarer have J @C and play A at trick 1 ?|pg||
nt|andersk: yes, If he is afraid a switch, but this time, no!|pg||
nt|othered1: Unlikely, and at matchpoints something on which to act,perhaps.  But it's nice to ensure you beat games at imps|pg||
nt|ybob: with JXXXX and JXX its impossible|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Tez|pg||
nt|othered1: does east open "any 11?"|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: Results here  http://www.pzbs.pl//wyniki/turnieje/2010/wilno/team/teamleaderb.html|pg||

nt|sybarra: and rehi Hans :) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: good afternoon everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: even by S after @H leadds and @D switch|pg||
nt|othered1: That vulnerable overcall feels dangerous to me.|pg||
nt|andersk: 1 NT is my kinda style:)|pg||
nt|ybob: i like X but ...|pg||
nt|othered1: it's 14+.  If within my range, certainly.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: For me an opening on S - yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Mike :)  welcome|pg||
nt|ybob: always with 4/4 M´s|pg||
nt|tez: if 1nt is 15-17 i prefer to open 1nt|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd upgrade if my 1N was 12-14|pg||
nt|othered1: But 3N should be bid using most methods.  NOrth's hand isn't exactly a distributed 10-count, it's an opening by old Culberston standards.|pg||
nt|tez: polish players mostly lead 2-4|pg||
pc|c9|nt|april7: @D ace and J for @H shift|pg||
nt|h_karluk: owerwhelming defence|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice stop in a makable spot|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: thats better |pg||
nt|sybarra: assuming Q |pg||
nt|othered1: He'll go after @H tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: for beginners 3NT did show spades or he should not have bid Stayman|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|haans: double finesse in @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: why not take the @C hook? |pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: well can you see a better bid for Kartanas? :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: what am I missing |pg||
nt|haans: OT just falling|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe I played too loing with Aunt MInnie |pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: no hearts so ...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tez: take this trick and after it there is 2 way.First play @dT or A of @h|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: bobholl: was it canape or just inspired ME: good question no answer|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: I think your Aunt Minnie had the right idea|pg||
nt|sybarra: of course she always played for 2/2,  (when the experts went down)  she cracked me up |pg||
nt|mdgraham: it is a safety play, of sorts, catering for @CK singleton offside|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree. |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
mc|9|nt|dburn: less dangerous when East is a passed hand, and West's opening is very likely to be a weak no trump|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Put on a sub|pg||
mb|2H!|an|spades|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: we have seen some very low scorelines in the matches today - whether that is due to tight bridge of flattish hands is a matter of opinion|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, it would be a bit hard to bring on a sub to defend 1@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H = obviously @s|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but wasn't all that obvious to bid it - maybe if we could make 2@s, we could beat the vulnerable opponents in 1NT by leading spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure one should get in over 1NT at these colours. They are vulnerable, you have a good suit to lead from and a couple of entries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: hard to know what East is thinking about - looks clear to play a heart, but...|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|dburn: ...he didn't, and he may regret it|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: South will run the @D9 you suspect|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|dburn: that diamond has ruined the suit for the defence|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So what about that sub I was talking about before? They are not going to score a goal here|pg||

nt|haans: backway play|pg||
nt|sybarra: 8 bd matches are a challenge,  you need to score (or not lose)  fast |pg||
nt|dburn: well, given that he made game opposite a six count, maybe his hand wasn't so bad after all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks now|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: He could have covered and claimed.  Here a brilliancy from east with Qxx would have put  him down|pg||
nt|tez: if west had AJXX @h it would down|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|haans: i have seen players using Stayman 1nter bid 2@H and bidding to 6nt missing spades :)|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, a 6-count that produced 3 tricks against defense to 1N, not 3N.|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: 2@H seems to be a openeing hand looks like is 1@H a denail?|pg||
nt|haans: yes short matches more like MP|pg||
nt|sybarra: East finding this bidding "fascinating" |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: maybe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h10 was a nice card|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: East will have a problem if West doubles |pg||
pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: however, he hasn't. |pg||
nt|othered1: Of course, south is at the table and we're not. |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: the ended right FAST|pg||
nt|dburn: curious - would have expected West to raise clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: EW convention card: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Ireland/hanlon-mcgann.pdf|pg||
pc|hA|nt|april7: this time 4@S by transfer played by W|pg||
nt|othered1: which trump do you lead?|pg||
nt|tez: i bid 2@S over 2@d with north hand|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|haans: original East bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: MIlner,  with smile says "thx pard" |pg||
nt|mdgraham: I confess I would double with that West hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you Mike |pg||
nt|othered1: so  do I|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: Does anyone know anything about there system?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree, they do it to confuse opps and get minus score themselves.|pg||
nt|haans: and me|pg||
pc|c9|nt|suketbombi: yes  on a @S lead declerer wud have been scared of East hand but he well placed now|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if south could have doubled negatively on second round?|pg||
nt|andersk: I would|pg||
pc|cK|nt|april7: EW could try for slam, |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think a @c switch is the best defence|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andersk: FIFO|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: Even with the ominous @S stiff, I'd double, t hen backpedal the rest of the way|pg||
nt|dburn: no doubt he could have done, but perhaps he feared a light opening bid opposite|pg||
nt|andersk: Fast In Fast Out|pg||
nt|ybob: i like a pass from S and W over 2@C|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|andersk: why do you want a ruff with KTx in @D?|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe two ruffs|pg||
nt|ybob: other move was K @D|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|haans: down to NT play|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps what he wants to do is force declarer to draw trumps, so that his side can cash more than two club tricks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andersk: 2 ruffs, when partner passed 2 @C, I doubt it|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: can E get the ruff?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: easy play|pg||
nt|suketbombi: may end up lossing 2/3 imps on this bd west by no strech of Imagination had an Vul vs NV over call with that hand|pg||
nt|haans: rite u r :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: i wonder why he did not to for 800+|pg||
nt|rnmalik: claim time.|pg||
nt|othered1: a low ruff and later trump trick, rather|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|april7: if possible to show singleton @C, but W to strong in singleton suit, so invitation rejected|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told  pszczo³a=bee in english:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: or perhaps he hoped that West's third trump would be a little higher than the four, so that he could promote it with a fourth round of clubs|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi all - connection problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: would you reopenas Wrest, Shirley?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|haans: only you were kicked out Mike :)|pg||

mb|1C|nt|haans: 6@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: it is the captaincy principle, east had no reason to look for 12 tricks with that holding|pg||
nt|ybob: cold 4@H, cheaper safety in 4@S|pg||
nt|tez: 5@h 2down looks like good save|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: Without Ew pushing in, game isn't all that easy to  find.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ybob: needs lead @C to defeat|pg||
nt|andersk: 4@S makes on a @H lead|pg||
nt|dburn: interesting choice, that double, but it will get spades into the game|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: not a chance the bid dim|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with @dA on side, a nice game|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I agree Ed. not so easy:)|pg||
nt|othered1: North is worth a short suit try, if available.  Otherwise, tougher|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But as I play- 2@c as S and after that rather easy to valur Ns hand|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|haans: 3@D in my book extra + GF|pg||
nt|haans: good @H bid :(|pg||

nt|haans: 3nt to hard|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks standard auction for all of us |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: unfortunately it will also put North on lead, and he will not lead a heart|pg||
nt|othered1: and you need @S lead to beat 5@H.  But played from north, that's likely|pg||
nt|dburn: but South may bid - he doesn't know he can beat four spades|pg||

nt|sybarra: classic 3x duck |pg||
pc|dT|nt|ralfwil: and the invite bid from me as N is any minor, not 3@s|pg||
nt|othered1: But they are leading the event, so these types of tactics must have a payoff somewhere|pg||
nt|othered1: I like 3@S if simply quantitative, looking for trumps and winners.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|suketbombi: 6@D is a good contract  needs 3-2 @Ds and a little bit more a good payoff but the problem is how do you get there?|pg||

nt|othered1: 2N looks like just a "stall" to let partner bid out his hand, perhaps with @D support.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|april7: loks like 4 @S and making by cross ruff, due to distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: 2 Diamonds was alerted but after the pass |pg||
nt|h_karluk: to me 1d-1s, 2s better but maybe they've a different CC than mine|pg||
nt|othered1: Assuming, of course, that we're not into relays|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to make 7, S has to play in a correct tempo and use his entries well|pg||
pc|c3|nt|april7: NS cannot play 3 rounds of @S, then E might go down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2@d was either 12-14 or 18+ with 4 spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: close to be doomed but not sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: may just concede three tricks well|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H,3@C by ruff, 3@D by ruff and 1 natural trump trick,or 2 @D ruffs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a space to pitch @c loser to @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: same as next door|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dburn: spirited stuff by East here, who seems to like bidding|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should end up a push |pg||
nt|othered1: This south will consider how he makes 7 with 4-0 split and won't go wrong.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: But 7 is tricky to bid.  That 5th @S in north hand is invaluable.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that is to make the correct ruff in @h and keep entries on hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: unlucky with the @s split compensated with 3-3 in @h|pg||
nt|othered1: anyone translate the auction?  Is it relatively natural?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks very natural for me|pg||
nt|tez: maybe 2nt shows @sfit|pg||
nt|tez: if not..bad bid|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: club now,  might get ruff later by S |pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence can get @HA, trump and a club ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: but oh well  |pg||
nt|othered1: NS probably were making 3@H on the auction, maybe even 4|pg||
pc|s4|nt|april7: cash all high cards and then cross ruff|pg||
nt|tez: ohh noo|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: but not now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: sad when your ruff with your trumph tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part of the game:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: Results can be seen here   http://www.pzbs.pl//wyniki/turnieje/2010/wilno/team/teamleaderb.html|pg||
nt|rnmalik: next please.|pg||
nt|haans: North may get atrick for @CT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: astonished if not 7@s now|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|april7: @S was not the best idea but defence helps|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: but not now|pg||
nt|tez: 5ny 6@c =@c king and 7@s?|pg||
nt|tez: ny=NT|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i say nice opps:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Since north doesn't know -- does he -- that south has @D controlled, that's an interesting choice|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: http://www.pzbs.pl//wyniki/turnieje/2010/wilno/team/teamleaderb.html   Lauria-Verscae among the participants. They are on the Zaleski team. Hold your mouse over the team names and ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: you will see the player names|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps they were, since West would doubtless have led a spade - but even so, South might have lost a trick in the suit anyway|pg||
nt|ybob: wasted values QJ@S, J @H , J @C and J @D here|pg||
nt|othered1: east would have been on lead against @H|pg||
nt|dburn: so he would, sorry|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: the "aha" moment |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now cold|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now @sQ is importaht|pg||
mc|9|nt|othered1: Is it meaningful that north bid @D, his long suit, first and got to 7@S, while in OR @S were bid first and they got to 6?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Jan Romanski (the player in the North seat) wrote the excellent scoring program they are using here|pg||

mb|2N|nt|sybarra: thx Mike and Hans,  great fun as always |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: the cards shown is one of the many to stay low|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: maybe @d lead|pg||

nt|sybarra: and thx Justas,  our great operator!!!   Always THE BEST!!!|pg||

nt|sybarra: and of course to our specs,  with all the helpful comments |pg||
nt|sybarra: he is counting tricks |pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like 10  |pg||
nt|haans: possibiltys for endplay |pg||
nt|sybarra: bit dicey isnt it?|pg||
nt|haans: 4th spades for clubs return|pg||
nt|dburn: but East might take a shot at 3NT at the vulnerability|pg||
nt|ybob: easy X from W with a limited hand values|pg||
nt|dburn: even though he would not be on lead against 3@c|pg||
nt|andersk: I noticed the 3 @CX should have been made at the other table, with that deefence that was played|pg||
nt|othered1: 5 imps to Vytas, when east with the 7-4 hand on board 12 overcalled in @D and wound up in 5@DX, with @S never bid.|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly it appeared to have a chance|pg||
nt|ybob: @H lead defeat easy|pg||
nt|andersk: trumph reduction and promotion of @C 9 |pg||
nt|dburn: but so does 3NT, unless South can lead the ten of hearts|pg||
nt|ybob: any @H |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe so|pg||
nt|othered1: This is the last board of the match.  Thanks to our operator, Justas, for the find presentation.  Thanks also to Ralf Willquist, Tezcan Sen, and David Jackson for their comments.  ...|pg||

pc|h4|nt|haans: Next time Bruin I promise|pg||
nt|andersk: that was 3 @C X from other room:)  If any understood that:)|pg||
