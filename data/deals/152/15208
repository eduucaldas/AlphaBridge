mb|3N|nt|rv: I presume with weaker hand, Saelensminde would have gone via 2n |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In the other room, Duboin opened 1@C in 3rd seat and got a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not so good for Europe|pg||
nt|rv: 3@h by Brogeland is direction asking, East could have XXed with Ace? maybe he wanted slow down the auction with min for GF|pg||
nt|rv: @H lead will win this brd for US|pg||
nt|spooky: why wouldn't he lead a @H now?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It will get one after Levin's double|pg||

mb|p|nt|spooky: tough to win this board for europe, |pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk5: Europe must hope that N-S also get to 5@C here. Then they need to double to win the board|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: thanks to you all for being here nad helping with comments  three more stanzas today   the next in just under 40 minutes I believe|pg||
nt|rv: unless they double 5@c by L-W|pg||
nt|rv: I think German ladies doubled Meckwell in 5@c in another match|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They did|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and Fantunes stopped in 3@C|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|mamos: North's 2@h is  an unusual choice i think  but it has had the effect of keeping EW out of the later auction|pg||
