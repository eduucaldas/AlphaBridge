nt|vugraphzrd: afraid not|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Simon Cope|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hallo|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I expected the auction to start 1@c-1@s-DBL - wonder what 2@d is|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hamman going quietly with his 7-5 hand at the moment|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably 2@d showed hearts in some way, since otherwise Hamman might have bid|pg||
mb|3C|nt|copeyj: many pairs play transfers here so 2@D would show @H, but tht would normally be 5+|pg||
nt|janm: Probably 2@d showed 4 hearts and some clubs|pg||
nt|copeyj: maybe some kind of raise yes|pg||
nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That would be very sophisticated for this pair, Jan|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1@C shows 3+ for Helgemo-Helness, and only 3 when they are 4-3-3-3 precisely as I recall|pg||
nt|janm: Now Zia knows that Hamman has heart length, at least if N promised exactly 4 hearts and S presumably doesn't have as many as 4, maybe not even 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helness-Helgemo do not have too many gadgets on their CC|pg||
nt|athene: Yes, they play 5-card spade suit and 4-card heart suit|pg||
nt|athene: 4 1/2 -card majors :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well yes, as opening|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But look at North's 2@D|pg||
nt|janm: I'm willing to bet that 2@d was not natural|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D looks extremely unusual|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs play transfers there so you might expect it with five hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Terry, no alert or anything?|pg||
nt|athene: but with four...|pg||
nt|copeyj: tough for zia here too - he has a pretty nice hand which cld make game opposite not very much with a doubleton @S opposite I thk|pg||
nt|janm: The fact that Helness has hearts and Hamman didn't bid hearts shows that 2@d showed some hearts. The fact that Helgemo bid 3@c shows that 2@d showed some clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very poor connection at the moment, we may be stuck|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tables crashing in numbers right now|pg||
nt|athene: yes, it certainly looks as though 2@D was a fit-showing bid in hearts :)|pg||

nt|athene: ok, something awry here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D!??|pg||
nt|athene: let's assume north is in 6@S|pg||
nt|copeyj: operator trying to catch up and am sure he meant to put 6@S as the call|pg||
nt|athene: "S" being next to "D" on the keyboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzrd: sorry 6S system went down here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Undo please|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|copeyj: when there are connection problems like this the operators have to do whatever they can to catch up - thats why the auction is not available to us at the moment|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|janm: So we can speculate about the auction - probably started 1@s-P-2@c, and presumably at some point N showed the singleton diamond so S bid the slam|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|janm: He has to guess hearts to make this - will he believe Hamman's heart deuce and get it right?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|s4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: he might just hope for the break or a hert-club squeeze|pg||
nt|copeyj: is it maybe surprising helness didnt use the KQ@S to take a cpl of @C ruffs (to try and bring down KXX@C in either hand)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|janm: It's tempting not to put all of your eggs in the heart finesse basket - now he can run the spades and perhaps have a show up squeeze if Hamman had the club K as well.|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugraphzrd: sorry system not responding hope it gets better|pg||

nt|psridhar: so first blood to Europe here|pg||
nt|daman: Levin ducked the @D lead|pg||
nt|mrt2000: flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: is it a board a match event?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|odysseus69: players will be named soon|pg||
nt|jcwla: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|daman: and then lost 2@S tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 14-16|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 3NT now?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this will be interesting - 3NT or 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: thats difficult to comprehend dia duck|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, one imp as 3N was played by W in OR and @d lead went into the AQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wellcome to Venky|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome even|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rmb1: Board-a-match throughout|pg||
nt|drewsky: USA is up quite a bit now...does anyone know how much ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Venky|pg||
nt|rv: Hi all, warm welcome from Bangalore in South India|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: no not a board a match - over 11 boards each pair is competing gainst a specific pair from the other team|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont know who is playing weak NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Fantoni-Nunes, I think |pg||
mb|2H|nt|jan_jansma: I knew :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks almost easier than 4 @S actually |pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: helpful lead|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 660 next hand :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: 28-20 i heard|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Andy, Roland and all specs, 2 great pairs playing here, what more can I a bridge lover ask for:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: With all that said, hi Mike.  Looks like a very good result for Europe on Board 1.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you need the 1NT in "sandwich" position to be natural against this EW pair. They open and respond very light. |pg||
nt|daman: weak Smolen|pg||
nt|sybarra: at imps you might be in 4 @S |pg||
mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: Hi Jordan|pg||
nt|mdgraham: On the last board, East may be weak with a long suit. Lebensohl comes in handy (2NT puppets 3@C, then you can bid your long suit). A diretc bid shows reasonable values.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Brogeland seq asks for pd to pick a 2 level major nf|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@H can be beaten, so this not so good for Europe|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@H makes from the N hand|pg||
mb|3D|nt|daman: @C tap right away|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: indeed so, but not from S!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unlikely to go down even from S...  J from Jx seems an unlikely choice|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: So West wasn't flying solo when he bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|psridhar: that attacking lead will tap decl trumps, but decl may not mind scoring his little trumps in a dummy reversal manner|pg||
nt|daman: West has to get the @Ss moving|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bigtrain: always 11 tricks available in @S...  @C lead holds 3N to 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: looks like 8 tricks i|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, S passed the 1@S opening and EW ended in 3@C.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: so the "secret" so far is lead clubs agst. nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt many would lead clubs from Jxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: better lead than from Axxx imo|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|bigtrain: tempo seems to dictate a @C lead is best|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: 2-2 @D and @CK in the S hand allow 11 tricks it seems|pg||
pc|s6|nt|daman: this way looks OK as well|pg||
nt|mrt2000: really, I think it's likely to be the best attack at trick 1|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|psridhar: Brogeland playing dummy reversal indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: Duboin is on the right track so far|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|rmb1: Do Justin+Jason still play weak NT?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no- 14-16 rising to 15-17 in 3rd and 4th|pg||
nt|psridhar: needs to use dia ace to play spd|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be down 1...NS just need to be careful and not get endplayed in the @h suit|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|janm: I'm sure we'll get comparisons on those first 2 boards as soon as the other room operator has a chance to enter the scores - we know that US won board 15 when both European pairs ...|pg||
nt|janm: went down in partscores|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 16 coming soon|pg||
nt|janm: Hamman is trying to ruff a heart in dummy and then pitch his diamond loser on the club A.|pg||
nt|athene: in situations like this the defence have to know whether to play ace and a trump or duck a trump|pg||
nt|janm: Helness might try to get the diamond trick in by leading one and then we'll see whether Hamman can guess that he wouldn't lead one with the K and drop the stiff K|pg||
nt|passell: he needs to lead the diamond king now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another board to USA on 16|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S+1|pg||
pc|d7|nt|janm: US was a little lucky on that one, since 6@s was a good contract that happened to go down this time|pg||
nt|janm: Helness has led the @d - let's see if Hamman gets it right|pg||
nt|janm: It took Helness a long time to shift to the diamond, but he's often a deliberate player, so I don't think Hamman can conclude anything from the tempo of the play. Would it be too ...|pg||
nt|janm: risky to underlead the K here?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|s7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|janm: Now they can hold him to 2 by getting the diamond ruff - surely Helness knows that, so Europe will win this board to make it 2-1|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|janm: Full board swing on the diamond guess - if he'd dropped the stiff K he would have made 4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d5|nt|athene: I think it was difficult for declarer to guess the diamond because north might think it was necessary to attack them even holding the king.|pg||
nt|athene: He can see a discard coming on the club.|pg||
mc|8|nt|janm: Helgemo trying for another trick with an uppercut, but Hamman's spades are good enough to stop that |pg||
pg||

nt|yvesj49: part score here|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: at trick 2|pg||
nt|psridhar: but EW bid well with E bidding only 1nt on a goodish 18|pg||
nt|lml: hi :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 14-16|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 15,  Hamman and Zia in 5 @D |pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: possible auction here -  3NT-6@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, same start to the auction, but Brogeland did not move over N's 1NT, so a win to USA there.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D = 2+ 10-15 or so... many shapes possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: goodish is a new word to me|pg||
nt|rv: for this match Zia, Hamman and Meckwell are for US, German Ladies, Fantunes for Europe|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mrdct: NS can make 4@c i think|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Rodwell will like this 3@C bid :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|odysseus69: sure to make 6D - but can they get there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has a huge hand now after the 3@D jump |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and not bid grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: this seems to be par contract|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 4,5@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: this one appears to be flat also|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 9 or 10 tricks, I excpect|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: 3@S likely a fragment-style bid, as South did not bid 1@S over 1@H |pg||
nt|daman: Some pairs play DOPI for controls over opposition to their 2@C opening|pg||
nt|daman: he might get squeezed if he doesn't take his 2@Hs|pg||
nt|daman: but there is the issue of transportation|pg||
nt|daman: and N can hold the @Ss|pg||
nt|psridhar: decl has 10 top tricks and will need to play h to get his 11th|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: very well done by NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: I always have problems finding my .5 card |pg||
nt|mrdct: optimal spot for NS|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rmb1: 3@S is just showing a stop (of sorts) for 3NT,  Does not know North is making slam tries.|pg||
nt|daman: if East had AK10 of @S there would be a shot  |pg||
pc|d7|nt|psridhar: now decl is a tempo behind -likely only 430|pg||
nt|yvesj49: agressive lead|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rv: inpite of big @c fit, @hQ is offside and 9 tricks are limit here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: no 1@S overcall - mildly surprising|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5@C is not a bad contract (it is with the @CK ofside:))|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psridhar: cl are 5-0|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Interesting now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|odysseus69: few undos to correct|pg||
nt|lml: what is the max tricks possible?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: does now....|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Teams, Pairs and Individual events in Wareen Buffet Cup, every event is scored on BAM style, so OTs and UTs are very important|pg||
nt|rv: German ladies have competed to 3@s in OR which is only 1 down|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|xenya: i think he can make 11 now|pg||
nt|lml: 5 i think after that good guess|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a @D and a @S|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|odysseus69: club lead still not good enough|pg||
nt|rmb1: In a less confident partnership, South would have let North play in hearts by now :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not content with 6@D at pairs. But a club lead may be interesting  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to make after the take out double|pg||
nt|odysseus69: west will be thrown in to concede 2 spade tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess there is a strip squeeze on a club lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|odysseus69: also could duck and squeeze as long as he reads distribution-not a problem either way |pg||
nt|xenya: now he has to get @H right as well|pg||
nt|rv: much needed board for Europeans |pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: the t/o double places virtually all the high cards - just room for East to hold @SJ perhaps|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Sabine Auken needs to play a @D now|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: for 11|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rmb1: Doesn't duck and squeeze require West to have @SJ, which is only card he might not have|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no - spade jack not relevant|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: although West may reduce to a singleton K in spades - but North will get it right  |pg||
nt|rmb1: The plan is for south to have SQx and winning diamond, and North to have SAx and C10.  |pg||
nt|dimi: Nunes has to hold @c K and @s K, so there is no chance to escape the squeeze|pg||
nt|odysseus69: N/S areboth Jill- North Jill Levin -now corrected-wife of Bobby Levin|pg||
nt|lml: yes it may be quite tempting to play hearts the wrong way|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** BUFFETT CUP IN RUNNING Currently USA 50  EUR 46  ****|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rmb1: When South cashes the diamond, either the C10 or SQ will become a winner|pg||
nt|jcwla: I'd say very surprising, meanwhile a great result for Europe here.|pg||

nt|athene: hard to see a swing on this board|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|janm: Famous last words? There can always be swings! :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|copeyj: In the other room 3@S showed an unspecified shortage and 9-12 I think (a direct splinter would have been weaker I believe as opposed to distinguishing between singleton and voids)|pg||
nt|copeyj: and as suggested looks unlikely there will be a swing here|pg||
nt|janm: Defenders have slightly different information here - know there's diamond shortness in dummy (I don't know whether it showed a singleton or void or just a sound splinter)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: at other vulnerabilities, NS might have got into the action here in diamonds|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|janm: Helgemo going passive with a heart lead - no attractive side suit to lead from on this auction|pg||

nt|odysseus69: as is the modern style aggressive bidding all round|pg||

nt|psridhar: 3nt wont play well on a h lead; 5c has chances|pg||
nt|diumraid: Current in running scores for the Buffett Cup USA 28 EUR 20. To win a continent needs to obtain 100 points. We are in Ruuning in Round 4 of 5 today.|pg||
nt|drewsky: simply a prepared bid in case the enemy calls 4@S, |pg||
nt|andyv:  at least S will find a couple of useful Jacks in N's hand|pg||

nt|janm: the run of the clubs, S pitched 2 spades, and declarer guessed that and dropped the Q, for 3 clubs, 3 spades and 2 diamonds.|pg||
nt|janm: With the 10-9 of clubs doubleton, though, it's hard to see how to beat 1NT - always a tough contract to defend against.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: 4@H looks normal here but maybe by way of stayman|pg||
nt|bigtrain: neb diamond shows 2+@D 10-15 many shapes possible|pg||

nt|yvesj49: we didn't see this board roland|pg||

nt|stigw: Sorry, that was board 15 - a very unlucky start for Hellnes.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: NS very agressive.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: arguably the weakest pair in the field, Hackett twins have lost all 5 of their matches yesterday|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure of problem on bd 15 |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: unless NS lose their diamond fit, which has indeed happened |pg||
nt|daman: they are going down more than 1 in 4NT|pg||
nt|drewsky: stayman, then smolen, the delayed jacoby.....thats the way I like to play it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: should get to 4@s now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|daman: great win for USA|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3 emabrassing overtricks for E|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H is not quite clear to me |pg||
nt|othered1: East  has a lot of cards for the auction up to him.  Not unusual when two pairs use light initial action approaches|pg||
nt|yvesj49: justin will make|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jan_jansma: well bid|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yvesj49: club now|pg||
nt|yvesj49: and with 10/9 alone|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|psridhar: many pairs play 1c-2h/2s to show major 2 suitor in a limited range-not Saelensmin|pg||
nt|daman: they must play standard count in this situation|pg||
nt|rv: sorry they lost 4 out of 5 matches|pg||
nt|bigtrain: don't think they have any play at 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rv: 10 tricks are possible here|pg||
nt|rv: sorry @c ruff should restrict declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: thanks to all kibitzers for helping me and other commentators when we make mistakes:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: R deep in thought|pg||
nt|rv: another surprising stat from Day 1, Fantunes have also lost 4 matches on Day 1|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if east thought of redoubling, if it would have shown power?  And would NS have sat it out?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rv: they are too good a pair and I expect them to bounce back today|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 15 poss fouled board in OR?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: lets ask GIB :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mrdct: can't ruff @c losers and control trumps|pg||
nt|stigw: I guess he might make it now, but no sure thing, even if the start was promising.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: only 6 tricks available for NS|pg||
nt|bigtrain: overtricks are possible for e/w|pg||
nt|stigw: Meck is best to duck here, but not obvious by any means.|pg||
nt|othered1: agree on overtrice|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what she should have bid last time- this sounded like a slam try - and maye it stopped Fantoni bidding 5D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not easy for EW, the way the auction went|pg||
nt|daman: Incredibly    Levin/Meyers are in 2NT in the OR|pg||
nt|chessmaste: whoops|pg||
nt|bigtrain: or should i say overtrick|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: maybe it shows E's shape?|pg||
nt|drewsky: Apparently they play some sort of funny stayman (modified puppet perhaps), and they got their wires crossed|pg||
nt|lml: they have obviously had some confusion|pg||
nt|xenya: modified puppet, i'm to;d|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzrg: E/W 6/4 majors but disagree on which way|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s3|pg||
nt|psridhar: if 2s wasnt forcing, E needed to bid more-may be he could have balanced 2N ( unbal, 2 suitor) and corrected 3m to 3H showing spds as his 2nd suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2nt is odd with 6-5 in maj|pg||
nt|stigw: Must be a winning board for Europe here.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: and it looks like twelve tricks are there in diamonds - with a shot at thirteen, too|pg||
nt|psridhar: i even sympathise with a 4h punt over 1n-p-p in E seat|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|othered1: 180 isn't an automatic win|pg||
nt|stigw: To beat it they must play in a way that probably on this layout means several ovcertricks (at board a match scoring).|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mrdct: @s now for guaranteed beat looks best|pg||

mb|2C|nt|chessmaste: how good is his hand for hearts\?|pg||
nt|drewsky: West has many choices....|pg||
mb|2H|nt|daman: 2NT was bizarre|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d showing one 6+M (rarely 5) is part of popular Woolsey convention|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they get the @D's in play |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D = 0-7 any shape|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Too strong to overcall 1@S?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mrdct: with NS playing precision there will be a delay in them finding their @d fit|pg||
nt|stigw: No, thats another question - but "meckwell" sometimes do starnge things (and usually come out successfully).|pg||
mb|3H|nt|psridhar: a prempt with an ace and a king on thee side and trump suit headed by jack may seem abnormal, but is often effective|pg||
nt|daman: in my youth I would have bid 5@C with the N hand and lucked out|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H = 4+ forcing, might have a longer minor|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe strange for general consumption but they are very disciplined within the structure|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW make 4@s easily enough, so NS's task is to locate a paying save|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 4+|pg||
nt|mrdct: if they do ever find it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the spades are actually fairlky useful as the cards lie|pg||

nt|sybarra: I would think 2 @D logical bid now but oh well.....|pg||
nt|mrdct: interesting that east didn't act over 1@c|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: this hand might take a while|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Duck the first trick and @H towards the @H9 looks best|pg||
nt|mrdct: east will be keen to score a trick with the @s2 and may try to duck a @c and then play !A and try to ruff one in her hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: the better plan may be to fire @ds back at the defence|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good lead !|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcwla: This is the type of board where "or it makes or it doesn't" -- E's actions really surprising.|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: @ST return now? With the @S87 in dummy|pg||

pc|c8|nt|mrdct: east will be analysing how 5@d will fare here|pg||

nt|mrt2000: can make 5 now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psridhar: excellent shift|pg||
pc|c3|nt|odysseus69: no problems here with 2 out of 3 finesses right and no bad breaks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: useful here to have two raises over the double - a good raise and a weak raise. It looks like EW have no such agreement|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: e.g, 2@s=weak raise, 2@h=good raise |pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|diumraid: :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they play reverse suit preference|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Sabine needs to avoid "cashing" the @HK here|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Else North has 3@D pitches|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: was the @C9 showing the @HQ?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: bye all i've to go nice match lol|pg||
nt|othered1: bye|pg||
nt|stigw: Still 4 sp might have had a sporting chance, so lucky for the US.|pg||
nt|othered1: I think @H play from dummy is right.|pg||

nt|sybarra: rehi all |pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: sorry, connection lost|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: ?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: lets see if the @C9 did its work here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that should finish this set|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: I think the @C9 WAS a Smith signal, saying she liked the lead (so she has the @HJ)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Russell,  was that last bd? |pg||
nt|jan_jansma: And with the @S2 being Udca, Sabine knows North has a 2146|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: She does need Danielle to hold the @DQJ to make the @S return neces.|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Without the @C9 most experts might get this wrong|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Í predict she will get it right and plays a @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: For new spectators. Number of boards in the Teams has been cut down from 14 to 12 per session as the players have requested longer breaks. Start times unchanged    but this seems ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: odd last bd given that earlier announcement |pg||
nt|sybarra: unless they split the difference |pg||

nt|othered1: and the nonruff says something, too|pg||
nt|stigw: Exactly.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: Rodwell asking about the Hacketts defence to 1@c|pg||
nt|stigw: He knows, traht he has at leat 2 trumph-losers now, so its only a question of how to play the Hearts.|pg||
nt|othered1: turns out that, if he plays @H, it doesn't matter which finesse he tries|pg||
