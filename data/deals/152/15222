nt|Walddk2: how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is common to overcall in a five-card major, rather than double, but I would expect most players to double on that South hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. However, the scoreboard is americanized for obvious reasons, so we ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: must live with 1-½-0 on the scoreboard. Just multiply by 2|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of losers - but S will be endplayed|pg||

nt|jcwla: coincide, as closely as possible, with it. |pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all welcome :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning from Los Angeles to all|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any shape|pg||

mb|3S|nt|jcwla: The competing teams, from Europe and the United States, consist of 12 players each and include one Womens pair and five Open pairs.|pg||

nt|jcwla: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this should be axed|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  well over the top|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D is constructive|pg||
nt|jcwla: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
nt|jcwla: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared.  Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: note South's response on a 1-count |pg||
nt|jcwla: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||

nt|jcwla: players on their team for a short set (6 boards) against various partnerships from the other team.  Each team has agreed on a standard convention card for this event.|pg||

pc|h3|nt|jcwla: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|jcwla: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: but they do have to cash the first 4 :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not that you can find it but a @C lead beats 3NT|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psridhar: this may go all the way to 6s, a faulty contract !|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N the likely destination here|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mrt2000: not a great start for Mexwell|pg||

nt|mrt2000: I wonder how they managed 12 tricks in the other room?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Ah, now corrected|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|daman: West will not go down|pg||
nt|ady: yes could be important not to go down 4 which could have been the case on a spade lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: remember The competition includes Pairs, Teams and an Individual. All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: available: a win, a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
nt|ady: Meckstroth can gain entry 3 times including a diamond ruff to play a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: -4 might still be possible|pg||

nt|brolucius: With four cards missing to the Q it is 52-48 in favour of playing for the drop - in the absence of any other information. The lightest clue that one defender may be long in a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: different suit switches the odds in favour of a finesse through that defender's partner for the missing queen.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Europe must win this round at least 8-4 to make it really exciting in my view.  6-6 is perhaps acceptable|pg||
nt|brolucius: ...slightest clue...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: USA are 12 ahead before this round|pg||

nt|pelu: 2 years ago Europe won the individual with soma margin|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They did|pg||
nt|brolucius: For example if one defender has overcalled in a different suit you should nearly always finesse against his partner for the missing queen.|pg||

nt|rv: Hi all, warm welcome from Bangalore in South India|pg||
mb|2C|nt|odysseus69: no not a board a match - over 11 boards each pair is competing gainst a specific pair from the other team|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont know who is playing weak NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Fantoni-Nunes, I think |pg||
mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: I knew :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks almost easier than 4 @S actually |pg||
nt|ady: think a slip up in the play playing clubs as it turns out|pg||
nt|yvesj49: slam in @h ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: zia went -3 in the same contract in the other room|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2@s west 3@h east ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: possible yves|pg||
mb|2D|an|*|nt|mrdct: helpful lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: 28-20 i heard|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Andy, Roland and all specs, 2 great pairs playing here, what more can I a bridge lover ask for:)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcwla: With all that said, hi Mike.  Looks like a very good result for Europe on Board 1.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you need the 1NT in "sandwich" position to be natural against this EW pair. They open and respond very light. |pg||
nt|daman: weak Smolen|pg||
nt|sybarra: at imps you might be in 4 @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Hi Jordan|pg||
nt|mdgraham: On the last board, East may be weak with a long suit. Lebensohl comes in handy (2NT puppets 3@C, then you can bid your long suit). A diretc bid shows reasonable values.|pg||
nt|ady: may be difficult to reach a slam|pg||
mb|4C|nt|psridhar: Brogeland seq asks for pd to pick a 2 level major nf|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@H can be beaten, so this not so good for Europe|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@H makes from the N hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a gadget strikes|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi geoffrey|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: @C tap right away|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mrt2000: indeed so, but not from S!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unlikely to go down even from S...  J from Jx seems an unlikely choice|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: So West wasn't flying solo when he bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|psridhar: that attacking lead will tap decl trumps, but decl may not mind scoring his little trumps in a dummy reversal manner|pg||
nt|daman: West has to get the @Ss moving|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: always 11 tricks available in @S...  @C lead holds 3N to 10|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good road to slam|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam never really in the picture|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 50%|pg||
pc|sA|nt|odysseus69: looks like 8 tricks i|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, S passed the 1@S opening and EW ended in 3@C.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: it seems duboin quite pessimist|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: so the "secret" so far is lead clubs agst. nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt many would lead clubs from Jxxx|pg||
nt|roswolf: a little worse i think and at BAM scoring not a good propostion - unless it makes of course!:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bigtrain: better lead than from Axxx imo|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: poor quality trumps|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|bigtrain: tempo seems to dictate a @C lead is best|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: 2-2 @D and @CK in the S hand allow 11 tricks it seems|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|daman: this way looks OK as well|pg||
nt|mrt2000: really, I think it's likely to be the best attack at trick 1|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but east didn't bid 4@d a good new with bare ace|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|psridhar: Brogeland playing dummy reversal indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: Duboin is on the right track so far|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rmb1: Do Justin+Jason still play weak NT?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no- 14-16 rising to 15-17 in 3rd and 4th|pg||
nt|psridhar: needs to use dia ace to play spd|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be down 1...NS just need to be careful and not get endplayed in the @h suit|pg||

mb|2S|mb|2N|mb|d!|mb|r|nt|brolucius: You would expect the USA to have a huge advantage in the Individual since most of them play Standard American week-in, week-out.  The European players have a mix of different ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: bidding philosophies. Indeed the USA creamed the Individual on the first holding, but Europe did the same in their favour on the second holding.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although I am Europe supporter for obvious reasons, I am first of all a supporter of good bridge, regardless of the players' nationality|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, bridge is like cricket in that respect. We can all applaud a 'good shot', whichever side makes it.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S weaker than Pass from North.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Broge can't pass obviously|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has a three-loser hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but North could hardly be weaker. He would need far too much imagination to bid other than 4@S now.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|brolucius: 'The world's most obvious 4@S bid,' I would call it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Singleton opposite KQJ9 is not so good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although he has only three losers, he does not have 10 winners|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers are suggesting West should lead a heart. I wouldn't.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Singleton heart and three trumps with Hamman is too much too handle|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And they have started the force|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A heart now, surely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then it's goodbye to the contract|pg||

nt|brolucius: East's 2NT was vulnerable, so he might hold one of the major-suit kings.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have just finished writing the first draft of a 240-page book with Boye Brogeland, where he describes his innermost thoughts as he tackles deal. It includes the gory details of a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: lot of big disasters too, which he insisted on including. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Specs suggesting that Boye wins the ace and pitches two hearts on clubs. He can, but he can't get to 10 tricks that way either|pg||
nt|brolucius: If West's redouble showed strength, rather than passing some message on his minor-suit lengths, declarer might place him with both the missing major-suit kings.|pg||
nt|pelu: how wil it work: @HA 2x@C discard @H and a @h - will the cross-ruff give 9 or 10?|pg||

nt|ady: game in either major for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: possible auction here -  3NT-6@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, same start to the auction, but Brogeland did not move over N's 1NT, so a win to USA there.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D = 2+ 10-15 or so... many shapes possible|pg||
mb|1D|nt|daman: goodish is a new word to me|pg||
nt|rv: for this match Zia, Hamman and Meckwell are for US, German Ladies, Fantunes for Europe|pg||
nt|roswolf: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 1@s forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mrdct: NS can make 4@c i think|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Rodwell will like this 3@C bid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: sure to make 6D - but can they get there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has a huge hand now after the 3@D jump |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and not bid grand|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i saw it yesterday lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm north would want to pass methinks|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rv: this seems to be par contract|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 4,5@C?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: no 1@s is forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: this one appears to be flat also|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 9 or 10 tricks, I excpect|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but i would still want to pass!|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@S likely a fragment-style bid, as South did not bid 1@S over 1@H |pg||
nt|daman: Some pairs play DOPI for controls over opposition to their 2@C opening|pg||
nt|daman: he might get squeezed if he doesn't take his 2@Hs|pg||
nt|daman: but there is the issue of transportation|pg||
nt|daman: and N can hold the @Ss|pg||
nt|psridhar: decl has 10 top tricks and will need to play h to get his 11th|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: very well done by NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: I always have problems finding my .5 card |pg||
nt|mrdct: optimal spot for NS|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i leant the method this night lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 3@S is just showing a stop (of sorts) for 3NT,  Does not know North is making slam tries.|pg||
nt|daman: if East had AK10 of @S there would be a shot  |pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: now decl is a tempo behind -likely only 430|pg||
nt|yvesj49: agressive lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: learnt*|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   likely to fail     4@S has a better play|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2@d probably raise in spades|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rv: inpite of big @c fit, @hQ is offside and 9 tricks are limit here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is now about the play|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: no 1@S overcall - mildly surprising|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5@C is not a bad contract (it is with the @CK ofside:))|pg||
nt|ady: need to avoid the heart finesse     likely to go down |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psridhar: cl are 5-0|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Interesting now|pg||

nt|odysseus69: few undos to correct|pg||
nt|lml: what is the max tricks possible?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: does now....|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Teams, Pairs and Individual events in Wareen Buffet Cup, every event is scored on BAM style, so OTs and UTs are very important|pg||
nt|rv: German ladies have competed to 3@s in OR which is only 1 down|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|xenya: i think he can make 11 now|pg||
nt|lml: 5 i think after that good guess|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a @D and a @S|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|yvesj49: one off|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks -1 but likely to be in game at the other table|pg||
nt|yvesj49: heart switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: yes 2d alerted as raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty terry|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|odysseus69: club lead still not good enough|pg||
nt|rmb1: In a less confident partnership, South would have let North play in hearts by now :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not content with 6@D at pairs. But a club lead may be interesting  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to make after the take out double|pg||
nt|odysseus69: west will be thrown in to concede 2 spade tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess there is a strip squeeze on a club lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
pc|sK|nt|odysseus69: also could duck and squeeze as long as he reads distribution-not a problem either way |pg||
nt|xenya: now he has to get @H right as well|pg||
nt|rv: much needed board for Europeans |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the t/o double places virtually all the high cards - just room for East to hold @SJ perhaps|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Sabine Auken needs to play a @D now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: for 11|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rmb1: Doesn't duck and squeeze require West to have @SJ, which is only card he might not have|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no - spade jack not relevant|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: although West may reduce to a singleton K in spades - but North will get it right  |pg||
nt|rmb1: The plan is for south to have SQx and winning diamond, and North to have SAx and C10.  |pg||
nt|dimi: Nunes has to hold @c K and @s K, so there is no chance to escape the squeeze|pg||
nt|odysseus69: N/S areboth Jill- North Jill Levin -now corrected-wife of Bobby Levin|pg||
nt|lml: yes it may be quite tempting to play hearts the wrong way|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** BUFFETT CUP IN RUNNING Currently USA 50  EUR 46  ****|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|rmb1: When South cashes the diamond, either the C10 or SQ will become a winner|pg||

nt|lml: since it is safer that way|pg||

nt|drewsky: West has many choices....|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 2NT was bizarre|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d showing one 6+M (rarely 5) is part of popular Woolsey convention|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they get the @D's in play |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D = 0-7 any shape|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Too strong to overcall 1@S?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mrdct: with NS playing precision there will be a delay in them finding their @d fit|pg||
nt|stigw: No, thats another question - but "meckwell" sometimes do starnge things (and usually come out successfully).|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: a prempt with an ace and a king on thee side and trump suit headed by jack may seem abnormal, but is often effective|pg||
nt|daman: in my youth I would have bid 5@C with the N hand and lucked out|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H = 4+ forcing, might have a longer minor|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe strange for general consumption but they are very disciplined within the structure|pg||

nt|sybarra: I would think 2 @D logical bid now but oh well.....|pg||
nt|mrdct: interesting that east didn't act over 1@c|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: this hand might take a while|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Duck the first trick and @H towards the @H9 looks best|pg||
nt|mrdct: east will be keen to score a trick with the @s2 and may try to duck a @c and then play !A and try to ruff one in her hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: the better plan may be to fire @ds back at the defence|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good lead !|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcwla: This is the type of board where "or it makes or it doesn't" -- E's actions really surprising.|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: @ST return now? With the @S87 in dummy|pg||

nt|mrt2000: can make 5 now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psridhar: excellent shift|pg||
pc|s3|nt|odysseus69: no problems here with 2 out of 3 finesses right and no bad breaks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: useful here to have two raises over the double - a good raise and a weak raise. It looks like EW have no such agreement|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: e.g, 2@s=weak raise, 2@h=good raise |pg||
pc|s5|nt|daman: they are in 5@C doubled in the OR|pg||

nt|lml: leading from a five card suit to the king is risky and yes it cost here|pg||

mb|1D|nt|psridhar: 3d d1 shd be a normal result|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|othered1: This is a great score for EW in any matchpoints game (including BAM)|pg||
nt|ady: routine 3NT  e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Europe trailing 20-40 after 5 rounds of Pairs on Day 1|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rv: 60 out of total of 198 Buffet points already decided on Day 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 6NT normally calls for a "don't kick a trick lead" -- a twist here b/c S not a balanced hand, but still would be a contender for lead of the year had E found a @D there.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C is either natural or BAL GF|pg||
nt|roswolf: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: East passes on barren 12 - good idea but others will be less prudent|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should bring 3 nt |pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: East declined to open with his hand - many would open |pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 3@C is either short @H or 5422|pg||

nt|mrdct: 3NT here for NS i guess - best played by south|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzrg: forget bidding|pg||

nt|yvesj49: cards are very 'sympa'|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: he can scorre 140 now if he risks 3-3 ccl|pg||
nt|rv: is even 1 down here a steal for Fantunes since 2@h rates to make for Meckwell|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Pairs, Teams and Individual, every event is scored on BAM style converted to Buffet points|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: diff lead problem|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: needs to lead a small black card|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 4th best of longest and strongest|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: looks normal to lead from your strong 5card suit|pg||
nt|mrt2000: making 3 perhaps?|pg||
nt|othered1: They're past 3N, so . . . |pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 2n after 1S would have been artificial|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: whether you open or not on theEast hand is very much a matter of what partner has|pg||
nt|roswolf: it looked a straightforward 4th suit forcing auction to me|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead should hold this to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 7 Brogeland made 12(!) tricks in 3nt whereas rodwell made on 7 |pg||
nt|roswolf: *only|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: you'd have to be either a genius or a lunatic to find a diamond lead there |pg||
nt|sybarra: but jan,  Rodwell, announced the stops, with 3 nt bid in face of your X |pg||
nt|sybarra: should you be looking for another lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: Rodwell thinking deeply, as usual|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 3 options:|pg||
pc|h4|nt|odysseus69: heading for 9 ticks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: spade lead has worked poorly, but it looks a normal-enough lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I think Fantoni-Nunes lead high from even if with an honour and opposite with no honour|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: But if west has the 4@S and 5@D she might (and does!) not have 3@C|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @H to the Q (and King from east...) risks a @D trough, so @C it will be|pg||

nt|brolucius: On this particular board, it turns out that Meckstroth needed to double 5@D to get the match-point.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The inaugural event in 2006 in Ireland was won by USA, but Europe equalised two years later in Kentucky, USA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers are predicting 8, 9 and 10 tricks for this heart contract. One of them is surely right.|pg||

nt|sybarra: a scramble here for 9 |pg||

nt|bigtrain: easy to hold to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  E can play @D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it's always held to 9 with best defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: possibly rumpelsohl where Nunes is showing weak competition in @ds|pg||
nt|rv: since Nunes is passed hand, I am not sure what direct 3@d would mean, it can;t possibly be Inv in @hs|pg||
nt|rv: maybe they play same system for ease on memory|pg||
nt|rv: it is very important aspect when you play complicated system |pg||
pc|c2|nt|rv: maybe 2N was both minors, and correcting 3c to 3d he intends as a good 3D bid|pg||

nt|rv: consolation for rest of us is that it happens to the best in the world:)|pg||
nt|rv: Fantoni's bid is a bit strange, practically he could have worked out to pass 3@d since partner passed 1NT and can't be inviting now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rv: I dare to say common-sense:)|pg||
