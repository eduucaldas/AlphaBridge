nt|jbgood: difficult to avoid the hopeless game?|pg||
nt|flash: i'm not fond of the 1NT opener with 2 suits unstopped, but Helness made the same call|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcwla: For Europe, NPC Paul Hackett of England has selected Sabine Auken & Daniela von Arnim, Germany, Boye Brogeland & Erik Saelensminde, Geir Helgemo & Tor Helness, Norway, Giorgio ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Duboin & Antonio Sementa, Fulvio Fantoni & Claudio Nunes, Italy, and Jason & Justin Hackett, England.|pg||
nt|mrt2000: expect 4@S now|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: P is forcing followed by 4@S shows a flexible hand|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi Ed|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have 5@C  assuming getting club right|pg||
nt|ady: hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: a feisty auction as one would expec5t at this form of scoring|pg||
nt|flash: the USA has already clinched the Cup, but we've got 3 rounds of 6-board matches still to be seen|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: For the USA, NPC Donna Compton has chosen David Berkowitz & Alan Sontag, Bob Hamman & Zia Mahmood, Bobby Levin & Steve Weinstein, Jill Levin & Jill Meyers, Jeff Meckstroth & Eric ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||
nt|jcwla: The competition includes Pairs, Teams and an Individual. All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
nt|flash: in the Individual, even during the round in which a player draws his/her regular partner, they must use the team convention card|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: for convention cards go to http://www.buffettcup.com/ConventionCards/tabid/151/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: this should be axed|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  well over the top|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: Of course Rodwell isn't overjoyed at bidding 3@S but he doesn't have much option.|pg||
nt|flash: likely to hear Meckstroth's shrug when he bids 4@S?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Duboin has to find h shift on winning spd ace to beat this, not difficult for him|pg||
nt|flash: on the lie of the cards, this lead doesn't really cost anything|pg||
nt|kaapo: Nice initiative this Buffet Cup. Any idea if it has made into big newspapers to promote bridge?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcwla: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D is constructive|pg||
nt|jcwla: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
nt|jcwla: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared.  Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: note South's response on a 1-count |pg||
nt|jcwla: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, we will have the Individual. Each player has drawn a player from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared. Each player partners each of the other eleven ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: players on their team for a short set (6 boards) against various partnerships from the other team.  Each team has agreed on a standard convention card for this event.|pg||
nt|sybarra: need your guessing shoes on in either contract however |pg||
nt|mrdct: now the challenge is to hold this to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1@H and 3@C to lose here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: usually partner will X in response to P|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay very well for n/s    can make 4@S as well |pg||
nt|roswolf: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|roswolf: difficult for north to lead a club|pg||

nt|jcwla: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|jcwla: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: but they do have to cash the first 4 :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not that you can find it but a @C lead beats 3NT|pg||

nt|roswolf: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|athene: one down is easy (@DAK, @HA, east's trump trick, with a ruff or not)|pg||
nt|roswolf: has|pg||
nt|jbgood: NS can make quite a few tricks in @ds, but ... and 3 NT may go lots of downers if defense is found|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and remember it is BAM scoring|pg||
nt|jbgood: still, may be easier to get the odd extra trick in NT than in @s contract|pg||
nt|flash: with the rather surprising location of the @SK, this will make|pg||
nt|flash: style difference leads to different contracts|pg||
nt|flash: here, Jason was willing to rebid 1NT with a singleton Spade|pg||
nt|flash: he'll have to pull the 2nd overtrick out of a hat to tie the board |pg||
nt|flash: (picking up the @D suit seems marked by North's X)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|psridhar: this may go all the way to 6s, a faulty contract !|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N the likely destination here|pg||
nt|jbgood: for example if S plays the ten now...|pg||
nt|flash: (certainly reasonable to expect 4 @Hs in East's hand and no reason why partner need have any)|pg||
nt|flash: same auction as comparison table|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mrt2000: not a great start for Mexwell|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i think that was wrong the undoubled undertricks may not compensate for the n/s partscore|pg||
nt|roswolf: even -3 might lose the board to -170|pg||
nt|flash: 15-17; xfer; denies 3-card @S spt; GF 2nd suit; conclusion|pg||
nt|psridhar: defense has to set up dia to hold this to 90|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mrdct: meck has a good look at dummy's stiff @CK|pg||
nt|ady: should get an e nd play for down 3|pg||

nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|drewsky: Good Morning, Bridge World :)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: oops|pg||
nt|flash: in the other room, rodwell overcalled 2@H and they sold to 3@D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  just a matter of how many overtricks here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: much discussion on system|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry, a bit ahead of myself !|pg||
nt|athene: and two down will be pretty much impossible i would imagine|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C certainly wasn't a routine action so this might be a swing for europe|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event. Have a look|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: ah well the fun begins|pg||
nt|flash: with dummy's @D holding exposed, the defense is a big favorite to take 6 tricks here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|flash: Sontag couldn't be sure that @Cs were running, so made a fairly normal duck of the @S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jbgood: I dont think Broge will try for overtick(s):)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|othered1: And 1N was making, likely with overtricks|pg||
nt|yvesj49: but obvious for West to bid 2@s|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mrdct: good start for europe|pg||
nt|athene: East's discard on the @DK asked for a heart, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer only had the @HK it would be necessary to play a heart through to get the second undertrick|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't want to ruff, of course, as soon as he sees dummy |pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING - BUFFETT CUP - USA  70  EUR  62  ****|pg||
nt|roswolf: these matches are played in 12 bd sets|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
nt|flash: so first blood to Europe|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mrt2000: I wonder how they managed 12 tricks in the other room?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Ah, now corrected|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzrg: yes he will|pg||
nt|roswolf: well making the contract is a win:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: unless given to him...|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|yvesj49: strange card|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he knows the entire distribution so severing dummy before end-playing declarer|pg||
nt|yvesj49: they are sleeping ???|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We are stuck I'm afraid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tables crashing in numbers at the moment|pg||

nt|flash: a good push to start us off|pg||
nt|psridhar: d2 may cost the board |pg||
nt|kaapo: Some catching up to do for Europe, I hear|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: is it a board a match event?|pg||
nt|flash: it's most unusual to see the comparison table running ahead of the table where Sontag is playing...|pg||

nt|vugraphzrg: 14-16|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 3NT now?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this will be interesting - 3NT or 4@s|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psridhar: thats difficult to comprehend dia duck|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, one imp as 3N was played by W in OR and @d lead went into the AQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wellcome to Venky|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome even|pg||
nt|athene: if East shows a limit raise in hearts, West won't like his hand that much|pg||
nt|athene: the spades are bad because there are over-ruffs threatened|pg||
nt|roswolf: a classic weak2!?|pg||
nt|flash: welcome (back), all - South this round is scheduled to be Zia...|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rmb1: Board-a-match throughout|pg||
nt|drewsky: USA is up quite a bit now...does anyone know how much ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Venky|pg||
nt|rv: Hi all, warm welcome from Bangalore in South India|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: no not a board a match - over 11 boards each pair is competing gainst a specific pair from the other team|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont know who is playing weak NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Fantoni-Nunes, I think |pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is quite funny. On the European CC we see negative doubles through 3@S, on the American through 7@H!|pg||
nt|flash: jump Q is a mixed raise (limit; usually 4 trumps; some defense)|pg||
nt|flash: a dreadful suit to overcall, but certainly a big enough hand|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jan_jansma: I knew :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks almost easier than 4 @S actually |pg||
nt|ady: think a slip up in the play playing clubs as it turns out|pg||
nt|yvesj49: slam in @h ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: zia went -3 in the same contract in the other room|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2@s west 3@h east ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: possible yves|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: helpful lead|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 660 next hand :)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: IN FRANCE LIKE THIS LOL|pg||
nt|yvesj49: oops sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 28-20 i heard|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Andy, Roland and all specs, 2 great pairs playing here, what more can I a bridge lover ask for:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW playing Fantunes? :)|pg||
nt|flash: the match-ups at our comparison table are Helness - Sementa; Meckstroth - Jill Levin|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: With all that said, hi Mike.  Looks like a very good result for Europe on Board 1.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you need the 1NT in "sandwich" position to be natural against this EW pair. They open and respond very light. |pg||
nt|daman: weak Smolen|pg||
nt|sybarra: at imps you might be in 4 @S |pg||
nt|kaapo: Mayers appears to be sitting at two tables|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: Hi Jordan|pg||
nt|mdgraham: On the last board, East may be weak with a long suit. Lebensohl comes in handy (2NT puppets 3@C, then you can bid your long suit). A diretc bid shows reasonable values.|pg||
nt|ady: may be difficult to reach a slam|pg||
nt|flash: Helness chose 1NT - neither action at all likely to find a @D contract...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|psridhar: Brogeland seq asks for pd to pick a 2 level major nf|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@H can be beaten, so this not so good for Europe|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@H makes from the N hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a gadget strikes|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: the view in trumps will be crucial here|pg||
nt|athene: he might make even losing to both hearts - he certainly will want to finesse trumps to try to keep south from putting a spade through|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but the BAM scoring method makes a significant difference|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if you just need lots of entries to dummy you might play the @DA here, but he would quite like his second diamond trick|pg||
nt|athene: my guess he will go @DK, club to the ace, trump finesse, and then think about things|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: Boye always thinks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: claims would be easier in teams|pg||
nt|roswolf: he could win in hand and lay down the Ace of trumps - and I dont think that is an unreasonable line of play which would hit the jackpot here|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with winning the first trick in hand and playing a club for the trump finesse is you are using up your clubs before you really want to|pg||
nt|athene: for example @DK, club to ace, trump finesse loses, north plays a club straight back at you|pg||
nt|athene: and you have a nasty guess to make|pg||
nt|athene: if you play @DA here and a heart finesse you have a bit more breathing-space with the club suit|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't want to be cut off from the clubs before trumps are drawn|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence might be able to do that by attacking clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed bill but that is why laying down the ace is not reasonable|pg||
nt|roswolf: not unreasonable i meant!!|pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes but you really, really don't want to lose a trump to south|pg||
nt|athene: and have spade through and immediately lose @SAQ with a possible overruff on a third spade|pg||
nt|athene: i think you have to take lots of trump finesses through south|pg||
nt|roswolf: true that is why declarer's thinking|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm vive la difference!|pg||
nt|jbgood: best game and righthanded too|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes individuals are all about practical bidding|pg||
nt|flash: notice the immediate raise - even without the 4th trump, starting with 1@S, intending to support @Hs later would give a distorted picture of the hand|pg||
nt|flash: the defense surrendered an overtrick next door, so first blood to Europe|pg||
nt|kaapo: Fantoni might open 1@C playing with his regular partner|pg||
pc|s7|nt|daman: @C tap right away|pg||
nt|psridhar: sharp competition fro NS even though they r vul|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indeed so, but not from S!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unlikely to go down even from S...  J from Jx seems an unlikely choice|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@S isn't a bad spot on the auction|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: a fair shot by geir|pg||
nt|psridhar: slam appears one out 2 finesses , shd make here|pg||
nt|flash: Board 1 was an interesting bidding problem for E-W; slam was 50%, but quite hard to judge|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: So West wasn't flying solo when he bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|psridhar: that attacking lead will tap decl trumps, but decl may not mind scoring his little trumps in a dummy reversal manner|pg||
nt|daman: West has to get the @Ss moving|pg||
nt|jbgood: not giwing away 2 heart tricks may be good for Europe|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|flash: Hamman leaves Sontag room, but 10 tricks available on @C position (which is immediately exposed)|pg||
nt|flash: Fantoni's first call seems to have decided this board|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bigtrain: always 11 tricks available in @S...  @C lead holds 3N to 10|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good road to slam|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam never really in the picture|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 50%|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 8 tricks i|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, S passed the 1@S opening and EW ended in 3@C.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: it seems duboin quite pessimist|pg||
nt|psridhar: if he guesses the layout he can make 10 tricks for 170|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: so the "secret" so far is lead clubs agst. nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt many would lead clubs from Jxxx|pg||
nt|roswolf: a little worse i think and at BAM scoring not a good propostion - unless it makes of course!:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bigtrain: better lead than from Axxx imo|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: poor quality trumps|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|flash: down 2 likely|pg||
nt|psridhar: can Meyers find tht cl shift? :)|pg||
nt|flash: the @D suit got lost|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bigtrain: tempo seems to dictate a @C lead is best|pg||
nt|psridhar: Ed any comment on why Justin prefered 3h to 2s X ?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 6NT seemed quite ambitious. This seems much better|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: 2-2 @D and @CK in the S hand allow 11 tricks it seems|pg||
nt|flash: given our late start, our operator will fill in the correct names and the score for Board 1 as we go|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: this way looks OK as well|pg||
nt|mrt2000: really, I think it's likely to be the best attack at trick 1|pg||

nt|flash: it turns out that this ruff is with a natural trump trick, but this is certainly a reasonable defense|pg||
nt|flash: in the comparison room, the auction went much slower, so West could conveniently show his @Ds|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: at trick 2|pg||

mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: possible auction here -  3NT-6@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, same start to the auction, but Brogeland did not move over N's 1NT, so a win to USA there.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D = 2+ 10-15 or so... many shapes possible|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i don't know, i've seen plenty of meck's actions that require explanation  :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: goodish is a new word to me|pg||

nt|roswolf: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 1@s forcing|pg||
mb|4H|nt|flash: that's usually best left between him and his analyst?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mrdct: NS can make 4@c i think|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Rodwell will like this 3@C bid :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: it was a close call for Justin...|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt is a zia like effort|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: sure to make 6D - but can they get there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has a huge hand now after the 3@D jump |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and not bid grand|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i saw it yesterday lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm north would want to pass methinks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: perfect fit for 5D|pg||

nt|flash: 2 Buffett Points per 6-board match|pg||
mb|6D|nt|rv: this seems to be par contract|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 4,5@C?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: no 1@s is forcing|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6c on one out of 2 finesses in majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: this one appears to be flat also|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 9 or 10 tricks, I excpect|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but i would still want to pass!|pg||
nt|roswolf: and a probable winning one|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: even though Zia is West... 2 NT may just roll home |pg||
nt|flash: Rodwell judges his hand to be just shy of a 4@D call (Leaping Michaels), showing a strong 2-suiter in @Ss and @Ds|pg||
mb|6H|nt|mdgraham: 3@S likely a fragment-style bid, as South did not bid 1@S over 1@H |pg||
nt|daman: Some pairs play DOPI for controls over opposition to their 2@C opening|pg||
nt|daman: he might get squeezed if he doesn't take his 2@Hs|pg||
nt|daman: but there is the issue of transportation|pg||
nt|daman: and N can hold the @Ss|pg||
nt|psridhar: decl has 10 top tricks and will need to play h to get his 11th|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: very well done by NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: I always have problems finding my .5 card |pg||
nt|mrdct: optimal spot for NS|pg||
nt|yvesj49: i leant the method this night lol|pg||
nt|flash: a bit surprised at the 2@S call - a limit raise with 3 trumps certainly possible|pg||
nt|othered1: American style is to rebid 2@C on good hands with north's shape, 2@H, with lesser h ands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 3@S is just showing a stop (of sorts) for 3NT,  Does not know North is making slam tries.|pg||
nt|daman: if East had AK10 of @S there would be a shot  |pg||
nt|roswolf: run the club jack and bobs your uncle|pg||
nt|jbgood: or take the di finesse - that is also a winning loser:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|flash: 4 trump tricks and the @HA?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: now decl is a tempo behind -likely only 430|pg||
nt|yvesj49: agressive lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: learnt*|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   likely to fail     4@S has a better play|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2@d probably raise in spades|pg||
nt|flash: 3@S shortness; 4@S cue bid|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES **** BUFFETT CUP **** USA  92 EUR 76 ****   (First to 100 Wins)|pg||
nt|flash: X shows 3-card @S support|pg||
nt|flash: Zia settles for the known 8-card fit, which turns out to be 9...|pg||
nt|flash: Sontag suggests a minor-suit contract|pg||
mb|d|nt|rv: inpite of big @c fit, @hQ is offside and 9 tricks are limit here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is now about the play|pg||
nt|psridhar: cards are not lying well for NS -Sontag's game try over 2H, if he had tried, wd nott hv been a success|pg||
nt|flash: at the comparison table, Hamma bid 3@D where Saelesminde bid 2@D|pg||
nt|flash: Rodwell makes a forcing pass, with his void in Hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no 1@S overcall - mildly surprising|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5@C is not a bad contract (it is with the @CK ofside:))|pg||
nt|ady: need to avoid the heart finesse     likely to go down |pg||
nt|flash: with Sontag at the table, we'll tend to be ahead of the comparison table|pg||
nt|flash: in 3NT in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: cl are 5-0|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Interesting now|pg||
nt|jbgood: Helness' 3 spades in the OR more difficult to cope with than the more conservative 2 @s here|pg||
nt|kaapo: East does not have a good bid over 2@C without an agreement|pg||
nt|flash: at the other table, E-W were briefly in 3NT, but Jill Levin (E) pulled that to 4@D; @S lead, so 150 still available|pg||
nt|flash: this forced Helness to guess and he chose 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: few undos to correct|pg||
nt|lml: what is the max tricks possible?|pg||
nt|flash: the fate of 3@S isn't clear, given the 4-1 split|pg||
nt|othered1: This wouldn't be the worst game ever seen, but the lead makes north happy he's not overboard.|pg||
nt|psridhar: quite well judged by Sontag poised for 110 now|pg||
nt|othered1: And a conservative approach is typical in board-a-match scoring|pg||
nt|flash: so no push on this one|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: does now....|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Teams, Pairs and Individual events in Wareen Buffet Cup, every event is scored on BAM style, so OTs and UTs are very important|pg||
nt|rv: German ladies have competed to 3@s in OR which is only 1 down|pg||
nt|flash: Sontag judges well|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kaapo: Will he find @SQ? Perhaps he will, because West might bid 1NT holding it|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: i think he can make 11 now|pg||
nt|lml: 5 i think after that good guess|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a @D and a @S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if Brogeland can duck clubs twice Meckstroth has to guess right|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yvesj49: one off|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks -1 but likely to be in game at the other table|pg||
nt|yvesj49: heart switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: yes 2d alerted as raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty terry|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|odysseus69: club lead still not good enough|pg||
nt|rmb1: In a less confident partnership, South would have let North play in hearts by now :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not content with 6@D at pairs. But a club lead may be interesting  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to make after the take out double|pg||
nt|odysseus69: west will be thrown in to concede 2 spade tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess there is a strip squeeze on a club lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: wow|pg||
nt|flash: this would have made only 10 tricks - @S finesse works, but nowhere to park the 3rd round of @Ss|pg||
pc|d4|nt|odysseus69: also could duck and squeeze as long as he reads distribution-not a problem either way |pg||
nt|xenya: now he has to get @H right as well|pg||
nt|rv: much needed board for Europeans |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the t/o double places virtually all the high cards - just room for East to hold @SJ perhaps|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Sabine Auken needs to play a @D now|pg||
nt|flash: but Fantoni has won the board with his 6@H call - this will only be down 3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: for 11|pg||
nt|flash: however, this shift has opened up the possibility of an overtrick|pg||
nt|flash: Helness went down in 4@H on Board 20; tie match|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rmb1: Doesn't duck and squeeze require West to have @SJ, which is only card he might not have|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no - spade jack not relevant|pg||
nt|kaapo: Berkowitz shows both majors via Michaels cue bid and with a huge playing strength of course bids game|pg||
nt|psridhar: Berko possibly evaluated his hand as Michaels cue in upper range, seeing that raise to game on 2h pref |pg||
nt|kaapo: EW might have competed in diamonds|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: although West may reduce to a singleton K in spades - but North will get it right  |pg||
nt|rmb1: The plan is for south to have SQx and winning diamond, and North to have SAx and C10.  |pg||
nt|dimi: Nunes has to hold @c K and @s K, so there is no chance to escape the squeeze|pg||
nt|odysseus69: N/S areboth Jill- North Jill Levin -now corrected-wife of Bobby Levin|pg||
nt|lml: yes it may be quite tempting to play hearts the wrong way|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** BUFFETT CUP IN RUNNING Currently USA 50  EUR 46  ****|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|rmb1: When South cashes the diamond, either the C10 or SQ will become a winner|pg||

mc|9|nt|odysseus69: that smells|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 9 tricks in hearts and a struggle for 9 in spades -|pg||

mb|p|nt|drewsky: Many partnerships play that 4 of a aminor here by west is NOT a slam try.....|pg||

nt|yvesj49: probably forcing lol|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psridhar: this shd be a flat bd losing just the 2 aces for 650|pg||
nt|psridhar: in 4S on h lead, decl will be put to a dilemma on dia shift ( on winning spd King) from W-whether to finesse or not at BAM|pg||
nt|psridhar: no such probleems in 3nt :)|pg||
nt|flash: 2@H fourth suit forcing - creates a game force; as we can see, doesn't say anything about East's holding in the suit|pg||
nt|kaapo: Saelesminde's bidding 1NT would've made the bidding simpler|pg||
nt|flash: 3@D is forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 6@H is not a bad contract but it won't make with the club offside|pg||
nt|mrdct: but will +100 be enough for europe to win the board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We have the big train here to tell us about the Meckwell system|pg||
nt|roswolf: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|jbgood: doesnt really matter whether he plays 2 or 3 - if he doesnt get 9, he loses the board, if he gets 10, he wins it|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the play is the thing|pg||
nt|psridhar: assuming NS wont venture 5c in other room |pg||
nt|flash: 3@S pre-emptive; other ways to raise to show stronger hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: as is the modern style aggressive bidding all round|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@H is a transfer 0-11 4 @S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 1@h shows spades. Good here for double  to be take-out of the shown suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3nt wont play well on a h lead; 5c has chances|pg||
nt|diumraid: Current in running scores for the Buffett Cup USA 28 EUR 20. To win a continent needs to obtain 100 points. We are in Ruuning in Round 4 of 5 today.|pg||
nt|drewsky: simply a prepared bid in case the enemy calls 4@S, |pg||
nt|andyv:  at least S will find a couple of useful Jacks in N's hand|pg||
nt|rv: each round in Teams and Pairs are worth 4 Buffet points, in Individual event 2 Buffet Points, total of 198 Buffet points at stake over 4 days|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @S to the 9 looks normal, but fatal here|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|ady: probable club lead  |pg||
nt|ady: onviously 2NT forcing|pg||
nt|yvesj49: easy on @c lead|pg||
nt|flash: all 13 available (but certainly not expected)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to John Carruthers|pg||
nt|jgc: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4s save was 300, but EW may press on to 5H-perhaps 5s for 500 is par|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: down 2 is a live possibility|pg||
nt|mrdct: true|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh, there he is, hello Walter|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes friendly beak in @S|pg||
nt|yvesj49: at least 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 2h showed extra|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|flash: Weinstein a bit worried about Sontag's length in @Cs, but would probably have seen a 2NT call (scrambling) if he didn't have 5|pg||
nt|flash: shows 5 @Ds and a 4-card Major|pg||
pc|c6|nt|daman: this is how the event is being played      http://www.buffettcup.com/EventDetails/tabid/70/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|roswolf: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|flash: hi, John - action's fast and furious - not the usual pace for this form of scoring  :)|pg||
nt|flash: Hamman - Weinstein found a good defense against Helness' 3@S, but he's still on track for 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv: whichever team gets 100 Buffet Points first wins this edition of Warren Buffet Cup|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: only @SA and !x will let him get out for down 1. Unlikely...|pg||
nt|flash: correct, Victor - Landy is the flavor of the day for USA (2@C shows Majors; rest natural)|pg||
nt|flash: @S shift to hold this to 4|pg||
nt|flash: 11 tricks is a lot...   apparently only 10 on this lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: West now has the option of playing North for @s109 doubleton|pg||
nt|stigw: It semmes - the system I mean - to function for them, but I wouldnt dare to try to copy them !|pg||
nt|roswolf: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: jeff is thinking about the play of the Q@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: the current score is USA 60 EUROPE 48|pg||
nt|yvesj49: in teams it's probably the only chance to beat|pg||
nt|ady: have to be carefull not to let 11 tricks through   not taking A@H|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: i bet he is thinking on how to minimise declarer's tricks - i think he will go passive|pg||
nt|roswolf: remember this is BAM scoring|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure by team it's different|pg||
nt|flash: Hampson also led a small @C, so the issue will be the pitches on the run of the @ds|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kaapo: Two first scores were duplicated in the open room. Board 9 has some room for variance|pg||
nt|flash: Sontag finds a safe lead - 11 tricks possible if Saelesminde leads a small Spade from dummy at trick 2|pg||
nt|flash: Rodwell working out whether anything can be gained/lost if he ducks this|pg||
nt|flash: now, he can be held to 9 tricks (with a @C continuation)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|odysseus69: cant understand Fantoni double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: surprised East didn't rebid 2@s with four-card support|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. However, the scoreboard is americanized for obvious reasons, so we ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: must live with 1-½-0 on the scoreboard. I am sure you can figure it out reghardless|pg||
nt|daman: scores as the come in     http://www.buffettcup.com/RunningScores2010/tabid/155/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|psridhar: Brogeland has tthiss beat in his hand-though he doesnt know it yet|pg||
nt|daman: @D lead is best|pg||
nt|flash: USA +2 in Match B; Match C tied|pg||
nt|flash: well done|pg||
nt|flash: (else declarer would have had time to set up the @Ds for a @S pitch)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jan_jansma: But thast is for us, mortals|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|flash: but that looks anti-percentage, so we're more likely to see 10|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|flash: now Jason has to switch to a @H|pg||
nt|flash: the @C9 seems an 'interesting' choice of a spot to return|pg||
nt|flash: there's some concern being raised in the comparison room about how seriously the match is being taken, now that USA has clinched the Cup|pg||
nt|flash: they've finished this round at the comparison table|pg||
nt|flash: i'd guess there's some possibility of play being stopped after this round; if the approach of some of the players becomes speeding through the boards just to get it over|pg||
nt|flash: the competition loses all purpose|pg||
nt|flash: in case that does happen, let me throw in...|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to the organizing committee for inviting many of the world's greatest players to participate and for staging a great show|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|daman: I take that back |pg||
nt|daman: must be my green tea|pg||
nt|psridhar: Rodwell will scramble 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|othered1: NS have a -200 save in @D, b ut it's not clear how to get in at these colors |pg||
nt|psridhar: Helness made a trick more but was in a cont 2 tricks higher on bd 3|pg||
pc|h7|nt|daman: @D was the best continuation|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
nt|lml: the club shift will end nthe hand quickly|pg||
nt|rv: could Fantoni competed to 3@h? not sure|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: so he mnay well lead the king of spades when he next gets in - let's see|pg||
nt|jcwla: Back in a flash.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to our sponsors - without their generous support, the competition couldn't take place|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psridhar: they r off 2 aces but it is that well positioned Jack of trumps thats going to beat the slam|pg||
nt|daman: Daily Bulletins    http://www.buffettcup.com/DailyBulletins/tabid/86/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|daman: they are in 4NT   NS in the Open Room|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jan_jansma: Meckstroth mortal like us too|pg||
pc|s3|nt|odysseus69: more often 1 spade as take-out and double to show hearts|pg||
nt|rv: looks like Rodwell will make 8 tricks here, 3@h is possibly 1 down and may not get doubled|pg||
nt|odysseus69: after passing I am more and more liking natural over 1NT - have tried everything|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES **** BUFFETT CUP **** USA  91 EUR 77 ****   (First to 100 Wins)|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|psridhar: mcwell bidding system is complex- i am unable to fig out how Mcstroth came to know the dia void opposite to bid 6c missing 2 aces|pg||
nt|kaapo: Auken opened with 10 high in hearts, so she must have quite a lot of strength in the minor suits|pg||
nt|psridhar: set for vienna coup if sontag can read the position now|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES **** BUFFETT CUP **** USA  91 EUR 77 ****   (First to 100 Wins)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Sontag might try for a squeeze here|pg||
nt|psridhar: cash dia ace, run spds for minor sqqueeze works|pg||
nt|othered1: works with east holding *all* high cards, incl @DJ.  |pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, Auken needs to hold @CKQ and @DKJ for that to work|pg||
pc|c7|nt|daman: I'm sure it is part of the meckwell system|pg||
nt|andyv:  with this vul, a dbl could easily cost the board|pg||

nt|psridhar: after a strong 1c, Rodwell made 2 bids- 3c could noot hv showed dia void, was it 4nt?|pg||
nt|daman: 4NT is not chopped liver in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: although Levin lead a @S|pg||
nt|daman: if he led the @H J   that would have been useful|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1,2 or 3@H with south?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1|pg||
nt|athene: OK so he laid down the @HA - that worked out well|pg||
nt|flash: board 3 also in as a push|pg||
nt|flash: we'll see if Zia can collect at least one more trick...|pg||
nt|kaapo: USA on their way to slam on 15|pg||
nt|flash: the operator at the comparison table seems to be having a lot of problems|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kaapo: This makes it easier. Sontag was quite maximum for his 2NT, so more difficult for defence to know what to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 4 spades easy make and 5D a good save|pg||
nt|dimi: good def in 5@d for EW|pg||
nt|bigtrain: me to|pg||
nt|bigtrain: too|pg||
nt|flash: that (lack of an) overtrick may be costly|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bigtrain: XX shows 4+@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What was the score on 16 in this room, anyone know?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Where Helness did not finesse hearts in 6@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: However, 6@S here does not have many problems|pg||
nt|flash: we simply don't believe that the Board 4 auction could have been 1@C - 1@D - 1NT  passed out|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: this could get high very quickly|pg||
nt|mrdct: too much outside to preempt|pg||
nt|flash: the Norwegians are in 3NT on 22, so, again, no push board|pg||
mb|r|nt|lml: 4@H looks normal here but maybe by way of stayman|pg||
nt|bigtrain: neb diamond shows 2+@D 10-15 many shapes possible|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@C a sound @H raise|pg||
nt|psridhar: That take out X is aggressive facing a passed pd and only 3 spds and slender values|pg||
mb|2S!|an|3H|nt|Walddk4: and went 1 down in the open room|pg||
nt|yvesj49: we didn't see this board roland|pg||
nt|athene: wow, that's some pass from east, assuming the double is normal penalties|pg||
nt|athene: this was really the auction? or you are just putting in the final contract?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think we're just catching up|pg||
nt|athene: yes, right, that seems more likely|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi everyone|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps it went something like 2@S - 2NT - 3@S - double - all pass|pg||
nt|flash: as usual, with Sontag at the table, we're well ahead of the comparison table|pg||
nt|psridhar: this will be a quick 4s making 420 for ns|pg||
nt|kaapo: Easy 4@S to play|pg||
nt|kaapo: Is it as easy to bid?|pg||
nt|flash: 2NT is Jacoby - typically a balanced GF raise with 4 trumps|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mrdct: and opening values anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ok|pg||
nt|stigw: 3 cl down 2 I imagine.|pg||
nt|stigw: Sorry, that was board 15 - a very unlucky start for Hellnes.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: NS very agressive.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 3n just on last sementa apol|pg||
nt|athene: then everyone would be sort of sane|pg||
nt|flash: you saw it here, folks!!!   Sontag opened 1@C and it wasn't strong, artificial and forcing!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: arguably the weakest pair in the field, Hackett twins have lost all 5 of their matches yesterday|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure of problem on bd 15 |pg||
nt|kaapo: I guess many Norths will open 1NT|pg||
nt|flash: Sementa has led a @H against 6NT, so the match will be all square|pg||
nt|flash: no, this isn't Rodwell opening 1@D nebulous...   if he opens 1@C, there are too many responses which would leave him rebidding 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: unless NS lose their diamond fit, which has indeed happened |pg||
nt|daman: they are going down more than 1 in 4NT|pg||
nt|drewsky: stayman, then smolen, the delayed jacoby.....thats the way I like to play it|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a soft lead and declarer should make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|flash: (and the result at this table irrelevant)|pg||
nt|psridhar: after that preempt impossible to find 3S (par for EW )-if justin had balanced 3s , Duboin wd hv raised it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: should get to 4@s now|pg||
nt|ady: clubs well placed|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 2nd diamond and a club from dummy|pg||
nt|flash: 2/1 by passed hand not forcing|pg||
nt|kaapo: Auken chooses to make the take out double once she's given a chance so low|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES BUFFETT CUP **** USA  94 EUR 80 ****   |pg||
nt|flash: XX to show 3-card @H spt|pg||
pc|c8|nt|daman: great win for USA|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3 emabrassing overtricks for E|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H is not quite clear to me |pg||
nt|othered1: East  has a lot of cards for the auction up to him.  Not unusual when two pairs use light initial action approaches|pg||
nt|yvesj49: justin will make|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w may well bid the game now|pg||
nt|psridhar: in practise this shd go down 1|pg||
nt|othered1: GIB would make this, but GIB peeks.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jan_jansma: well bid|pg||
nt|flash: but that's an extreme position by Sementa|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yvesj49: club now|pg||
nt|yvesj49: and with 10/9 alone|pg||
nt|kaapo: An extra pass here?|pg||
nt|flash: now Sontag gets to show his @H control (and his 2nd round control in @Cs) - that may be enough|pg||
nt|kaapo: Suppose it was Zia bidding 5@C|pg||
nt|flash: yes - that looks far more likely|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|psridhar: many pairs play 1c-2h/2s to show major 2 suitor in a limited range-not Saelensmin|pg||
nt|daman: they must play standard count in this situation|pg||
nt|rv: sorry they lost 4 out of 5 matches|pg||
nt|bigtrain: don't think they have any play at 10 tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: valuing spade q and so no splinter|pg||
nt|flash: 2@C limit +; 2@D stopper; 2@H stopper; 2NT @S stopper...|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: no discussion|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rv: 10 tricks are possible here|pg||
nt|rv: sorry @c ruff should restrict declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: thanks to all kibitzers for helping me and other commentators when we make mistakes:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: R deep in thought|pg||
nt|rv: another surprising stat from Day 1, Fantunes have also lost 4 matches on Day 1|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if east thought of redoubling, if it would have shown power?  And would NS have sat it out?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well after 3@D - CANTY TYPE QUICK ENOUGH:(|pg||
nt|flash: wonder if Europe has a Drury call available|pg||
nt|flash: good point, Victor - splintering with a singleton K or Q can distort partner's evaluation|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rv: they are too good a pair and I expect them to bounce back today|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 15 poss fouled board in OR?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: lets ask GIB :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event|pg||
nt|flash: 2NT usually an inquiry as to the nature of the raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: auction correct|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or perhaps West wanted to drive to 5@H but tried to direct the lead on the way|pg||
nt|flash: thnx, Trevor|pg||
nt|flash: the cards certainly lie badly for any N-S contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mrdct: can't ruff @c losers and control trumps|pg||
nt|stigw: I guess he might make it now, but no sure thing, even if the start was promising.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: only 6 tricks available for NS|pg||
nt|bigtrain: overtricks are possible for e/w|pg||
nt|stigw: Meck is best to duck here, but not obvious by any means.|pg||
nt|othered1: agree on overtrice|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what she should have bid last time- this sounded like a slam try - and maye it stopped Fantoni bidding 5D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not easy for EW, the way the auction went|pg||
nt|daman: Incredibly    Levin/Meyers are in 2NT in the OR|pg||
nt|chessmaste: whoops|pg||
nt|bigtrain: or should i say overtrick|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: maybe it shows E's shape?|pg||
nt|drewsky: Apparently they play some sort of funny stayman (modified puppet perhaps), and they got their wires crossed|pg||
nt|lml: they have obviously had some confusion|pg||
nt|xenya: modified puppet, i'm to;d|pg||
nt|roswolf: getting the trumps right will be difficult|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzrg: E/W 6/4 majors but disagree on which way|pg||
nt|psridhar: whats that duck ? Auken shd hv some spds for her tke out X ?|pg||
nt|othered1: On that play to the first trick, I'll guess Sontag makes this easily|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c5|pg||
nt|psridhar: if 2s wasnt forcing, E needed to bid more-may be he could have balanced 2N ( unbal, 2 suitor) and corrected 3m to 3H showing spds as his 2nd suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2nt is odd with 6-5 in maj|pg||
nt|stigw: Must be a winning board for Europe here.|pg||
nt|psridhar: he still has he 4th club to take care of -finesse the 10 spot seems the only solution|pg||
nt|othered1: do they play attitude leads against suits?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Helgemo - Helness stopped rather surprisingly at 3@H on board 9, so USA took the lead in this match|pg||
nt|psridhar: even then u shd be allowed to lead 9 from kj9 tripleton|pg||
nt|othered1: Sure -- that's leading low.|pg||
nt|kaapo: I think the convention card described leads vs suit contracts as "3rd or 5th"|pg||
pc|s7|nt|flash: Boards 3 and 4 have been corrected in the other room|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: and it looks like twelve tricks are there in diamonds - with a shot at thirteen, too|pg||
nt|psridhar: i even sympathise with a 4h punt over 1n-p-p in E seat|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry - I was bidding upside down-2 hearts of course made no sense as did mmy comments|pg||
nt|flash: on the lead and the position of the @CK, down 1|pg||
nt|flash: this looks as though it'll be fast, so let me get a head-start on...|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to the organizing committee for a great job in attracting some of the best pairs in the world|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rv: 5 rounds of Pairs were played yesterday, total of 15 maches and 60 Buffet points decided|pg||
nt|rv: 60 out of 198 Buffet Points decided on Day 1|pg||
nt|psridhar: so cant duck from QXXX|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|daman: uncle|pg||
nt|daman: white flag of surrender|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe with Axx spades North should bid 2 spades rather than 2NT|pg||
nt|flash: the field is immensely stronger than it was 2 years ago and the bridge has been well worth watching|pg||
nt|flash: playing on xruff lines - certainly feels right|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jan_jansma: ?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: sorry was private|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jan_jansma: @C @C creates a @S trick with the @SJ|pg||
nt|jbgood: not sure - Geir may just find it, S is marked with a king and some di support, so may not have the spade queen|pg||
nt|othered1: with this ultrafriendly lie of the cards, 4@SX -100 looks like par.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|flash: again, the convention card is a bit sparse (not to mention the last-minute change to 2/1 GF)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|flash: 3@S making won that board; Board 4 was a push|pg||
nt|othered1: hi, everyone|pg||
nt|flash: Match C is tied; USA +1 in Match B, playing the last board|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|othered1: 180 isn't an automatic win|pg||
nt|stigw: To beat it they must play in a way that probably on this layout means several ovcertricks (at board a match scoring).|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The tables are no longer linked|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps EW have some other lead convention in their regular partnership which caused confusion|pg||
nt|flash: and it appears we'll be in the same position here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrdct: @s now for guaranteed beat looks best|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: and everything else also works for EW|pg||
nt|yvesj49: oops|pg||
nt|roswolf: that may give declarer a clue|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  well done by the D|pg||
nt|rv: though we have Pairs, BAM and Teams, all events are scored on BAM style which are converted to Buffet Points at the end of matches|pg||
nt|yvesj49: overtrick is here now|pg||
nt|flash: this will also be a push, clinching at least a tie for Europe in the match|pg||
nt|kaapo: Without West's brave 3@H overcall, North would likely have been able to describe something useful for South|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, could you please shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Better now than later|pg||
nt|flash: as usual, with Sontag at the table, we've pulled far ahead of the comparison table|pg||
nt|kaapo: Like long diamonds or short clubs|pg||
nt|flash: he'll cash the @HA before Jason can pitch another @H?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to the sponsors - without your generosity, there would have been no event to watch|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mrdct: no entries for a trump coup|pg||
nt|jgc: I think Sementa's pass is clear - he has a balanced minimum and any other bid can get them too high (from his POV)|pg||
nt|flash: Helness - von Arnim stop in 5@H - USA will win board 10|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to Fred and crew at BBO for giving us this fantastic viewing platform|pg||
nt|flash: not a winning line...   trump back to push the board at down 1|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|stigw: Exactly, partner must hold sp A and a further diamond, so good play from Rodwell (even if it backfired this time).|pg||
nt|ady: kib suggested J@S at trick   but then heart switch  and nothing has been done to establish clubs|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to our operator, Terry Walsh, for a great job all day|pg||

He ran the risk of playing in a 5-1 club fit with a 5-3 heart fit (which would score more).|pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: level match|pg||
nt|flash: i'd expect USA to use Drury to get to 2@S on this one|pg||
nt|jgc: Withholding support leads to more bad results than any other action|pg||

nt|flash: last board now; more to watch at our comparison table and/or in other matches|pg||

nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES BUFFETT CUP **** USA  97 EUR 77 ****   after this round|pg||
nt|flash: they had a clear run in the other room...   far fewer issues|pg||
nt|flash: systemically, Sontag would have bid 3@C to show shortness|pg||
mb|1S|nt|psridhar: a win for Europe for playing trump contract !|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the last hand decisive|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4H by S can make|pg||
nt|othered1: Would Sontag have gotten @H right without the trick 1 gift?  I don't think it impossible|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to our expert on the Meckwell system, Walter Johnson|pg||
nt|rv: this match is very much alive with 2.5 each after 5 brds|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any shape|pg||
nt|athene: you might well go down in 4@S here|pg||
nt|flash: last board of the set; we're well ahead of most tables, so more to watch when we're done|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcwla: On Board 3, Saelensminde led the @SK against 3NT and held it to five, so a win to Europe there.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Wojo|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Walter, wlc|pg||
nt|bigtrain: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Walter|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: sorry, distracted & missed carding|pg||
nt|flash: back at the top of the hour with the 3rd match|pg||
nt|jgc: With Sementa and Sontag at the same table, this is like lightning!!|pg||
nt|flash: re-start at top of the hour - last match of the day coming up|pg||
nt|psridhar: bd 5|pg||
nt|kaapo: Another nice hand :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I dont think he will pass but he is thinking about it|pg||
nt|chessmaste: tough call for West|pg||
nt|yvesj49: the question was is it normal to play 1NT X lol|pg||
nt|flash: last board of the match...   feel we've barely settled in!!!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chessmaste: how good is his hand for hearts\?|pg||
nt|drewsky: West has many choices....|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a lot of views to get right/wrong|pg||
nt|flash: lots of boards to watch at the comparison table and/or at other matches|pg||
nt|psridhar: a 4h opg will be more pressure on NS; 3h seems conservative at these colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 2NT was bizarre|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d showing one 6+M (rarely 5) is part of popular Woolsey convention|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they get the @D's in play |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D = 0-7 any shape|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Too strong to overcall 1@S?|pg||
nt|athene: lots of guessing to do|pg||
nt|roswolf: playing in nt is impressive in the other room with a 6-4 fit|pg||
nt|flash: i believe it was Duboin who reportedly had the line of the year...|pg||
nt|flash: Zia's already taken 5 tricks, so USA has clinched at least a tie in this match|pg||
nt|psridhar: that shd end the auction|pg||
nt|kaapo: That would've fit Zia's hand very well|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mrdct: with NS playing precision there will be a delay in them finding their @d fit|pg||
nt|stigw: No, thats another question - but "meckwell" sometimes do starnge things (and usually come out successfully).|pg||
nt|flash: USA wins Match B; Match C still tied|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: a prempt with an ace and a king on thee side and trump suit headed by jack may seem abnormal, but is often effective|pg||
nt|daman: in my youth I would have bid 5@C with the N hand and lucked out|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H = 4+ forcing, might have a longer minor|pg||
nt|bigtrain: maybe strange for general consumption but they are very disciplined within the structure|pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead will solve one problem|pg||
nt|flash: evidently, USA is 2 up in both the B and C matches; 3 Buffett Points away from winning back the Cup...|pg||
nt|kaapo: I'd have guessed von Arnim to open this. She opens very light in her regular system|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: EW make 4@s easily enough, so NS's task is to locate a paying save|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 4+|pg||
nt|mrdct: if they do ever find it|pg||
nt|athene: but then @C10 switch|pg||
nt|othered1: right, but do EW let NS play it on other auctions?|pg||
nt|flash: restart in 1 hour 10 minutes|pg||
nt|psridhar: though 4h costs 800|pg||
nt|kaapo: East can choose the level of his opening from a large variety. Perhaps the 7222 distribution made him not to open 4|pg||
nt|kaapo: Now she didn't get a good chance to enter the auction|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah, she did|pg||
nt|flash: quite a brave action, but you don't get rich allowing the opps to play in an 8-card fit at the 2-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the spades are actually fairlky useful as the cards lie|pg||
nt|drewsky: my que bidding he is over bidding but will enusre that he at least gets to the correct game.|pg||
nt|xenya: well W has been warned...|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the bidding was simple|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps more of a clue now|pg||
nt|jbgood: is there a 12th?|pg||
nt|roswolf: there may well be on that lead|pg||
nt|jgc: yes...?|pg||
nt|flash: in New Orleans, during the 1st half of the semi-final match in the Spingold|pg||
nt|flash: Sementa had a blood-pressure spike and had to be taken to hospital|pg||
nt|flash: as they're wheeling him out, Duboin says:  Tonio - if you die, know that you played well today|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 2D probably checkback|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d probably artificial GF|pg||
nt|flash: this looks like a straightforward 11 (famous last words)|pg||
nt|flash: other matches:  3-0 USA and 2-2; so another good round for the USA |pg||
nt|psridhar: thats why 4s X -1 looks par|pg||
nt|flash: she might have called 2@H over 1@S (as Weinstein did in the other room)|pg||
nt|flash: putting much less at risk and involving partner in the decision|pg||
nt|flash: Helness took the push to 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: on the nother hand....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@D may buy it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would think 2 @D logical bid now but oh well.....|pg||
nt|mrdct: interesting that east didn't act over 1@c|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: this hand might take a while|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Duck the first trick and @H towards the @H9 looks best|pg||
nt|mrdct: east will be keen to score a trick with the @s2 and may try to duck a @c and then play !A and try to ruff one in her hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: the better plan may be to fire @ds back at the defence|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good lead !|pg||
nt|kaapo: Is it clear to double as North if East opens 4@H?|pg||
nt|psridhar: one simple way of looking at it is- ' i hv 7 tricks nv vs vul-on rule of 2 and 3 it is 4h'|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcwla: This is the type of board where "or it makes or it doesn't" -- E's actions really surprising.|pg||
nt|mrdct: the defence need to be careful too not to get frisky with playing @h and giving south unwanted ruffs|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @ST return now? With the @S87 in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: I'm told we're awaiting a ruling on board 16|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: from OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Russell |pg||
nt|mrdct: @s10 is good as it sends the message to north that i have control of trumps - no ruffs needed|pg||
nt|athene: you have to rise the king to block them and play a diamond to the jack right away to set up a discard|pg||
nt|athene: maybe this is all findable|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't see why you should play for clubs 5-2|pg||
nt|jbgood: kibs disagree - from 11 to 13 tricks - tu:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5H looks a profitble save for 300 may be|pg||
nt|othered1: 7@H would be a good save v. 6@S|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES BUFFETT CUP **** USA  96 EUR 78 ****   |pg||
nt|flash: the Law says bid 3@S; Sontag's hand says surrender...|pg||
nt|flash: had Zia Xd (certainly a possibility), on the lie of the cards, +200 would have won the board|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES BUFFETT CUP **** USA  101 EUR 79 **** IN RUNNING ****  USA CANNOT BE CAUGHT NOW ***   CONGRATS TO USA   ****|pg||
nt|flash: now +100 will lose it|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, NS need to manage take undertricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrdct: east will be analysing how 5@d will fare here|pg||
nt|mrt2000: W needs to go quietly here|pg||
nt|yvesj49: trump promotion|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: snap|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South shows 3 spades and thats enough info for North|pg||
nt|lml: by and large the hand lies well for duboin|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oh dear ....................|pg||
nt|mrt2000: can make 5 now|pg||
nt|athene: you might just rely on @CA and @CQ both onside|pg||
nt|flash: Europe leading 3-2 in our C match; we've had some problems with our B match broadcast, so i don't have a score for that|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|psridhar: excellent shift|pg||
nt|athene: sorry you have to play trumps first otherwise north gets a club ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the bidding suggests distribution held by the defenders|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but the bidding would have been the same if south had @Sx @HA10xxx @DAxx @CAQ109|pg||
nt|athene: and if he does, the winning line is to put the jack on the @C10|pg||
nt|athene: we don't have a play record from the other room|pg||
nt|athene: so we don't know if zia was put to the test and passed it brilliantly :)|pg||
nt|athene: if he did it will surely be bulletin material|pg||
nt|flash: 9 tricks available here|pg||
nt|flash: Europe wins the C Match - a first step toward recovering from last round's 0-3 record|pg||
nt|flash: still a big lead for USA, no matter the outcome of this match and the B match|pg||
pc|s7|nt|odysseus69: no problems here with 2 out of 3 finesses right and no bad breaks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: useful here to have two raises over the double - a good raise and a weak raise. It looks like EW have no such agreement|pg||
nt|athene: boink|pg||
nt|athene: ok, now it's time for Brogeland to be a hero|pg||
nt|athene: i don't honestly see any reason to guess this right|pg||
nt|jgc: Great line! But I thought it was Versace who said it.|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wd hvv been tempted to bid 5s on that 9 card suit :)|pg||
nt|othered1: absent @C lead.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: e.g, 2@s=weak raise, 2@h=good raise |pg||
pc|sA|nt|daman: they are in 5@C doubled in the OR|pg||
nt|mrdct: -500 may still win the board|pg||
nt|psridhar: vs 6s LOW club lead wont do-cl jack needed|pg||
nt|othered1: right, high @C lead|pg||
nt|flash: 10 tricks coming; thnx, all - back in just over an hour|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lml: there are a number of choices but pretty well everything works|pg||
nt|rv: losing an extra @s trick, but avoided a @h ruff in bargain|pg||
nt|roswolf: i fancy 12|pg||
nt|kaapo: On the other hand, after Roland's announcement, all they need to take any more is the Trophy with them :)|pg||
nt|flash: as we can see, the opponents Spades are 2-2; had they been 3-1 3@H would have made|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bigtrain: no way do they reach 5@D|pg||
nt|stigw: Very good lead indeed.|pg||
nt|roswolf: down the middle!|pg||
nt|flash: Board 16 in as a push|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|jan_jansma: "psyching xxx in @D now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this is all about -1 vs -2|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 2 off|pg||
nt|flash: looks as though Europe will win this board and the match|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: yes there is a double squeeze but can declarer read it?|pg||
nt|flash: the defense can take their @H tricks early or late...|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps Sontag could try 5@S. He may have some more spades and less defence that partner might expect|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Break for lunch after this set. Restart at 14.00 BST, in about 1 hour and 5 minutes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: yes -- there is room for either @HK or @DA in the S hand -- but taking a @H hook looks normal|pg||
nt|roswolf: the @D7 discard was a mistake|pg||
nt|flash: Zia on a @D guess to make 1NT - irrelevant to score on the board, but interesting; he gets it right!!|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of course his partner could hold stronger hearts than he has now|pg||
nt|othered1: This hasn't been the best defense.|pg||
nt|kaapo: This might well be the decisive board|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|mrdct: auken wishing she had a better pip than the @S2|pg||
nt|mrdct: i prefer a @d rather than @h at this point|pg||
nt|mrdct: -1 inevitable now|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: in OR, someone apparently looked at wrong hand|pg||
nt|flash: all of which suggests that perhaps Sontag should have followed the Law (of Total Tricks) and bid 3@S|pg||
nt|flash: we hope we'll be back at the top of the hour; Match C still in play|pg||
nt|flash: (even down 1 will win the board - needs to ruff a small @D to keep 9 tricks in the picture)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|lml: cashing the diamond ace is good|pg||
nt|flash: so USA need only push one of the two boards remaining at our comparison table to clinch a 2nd win this round|pg||
nt|flash: the third match is still tied|pg||
nt|flash: Helness-Fantoni in 5@C on board 17; Zia found the @H lead, so that will also fail and USA will clinch the match|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: 5 was -1|pg||
nt|mrdct: on this board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: on brd 16|pg||
nt|flash: in a highly competitive auction, Helness - von Arnim reached 4@C as N-S on board 11|pg||
nt|psridhar: thx all bye|pg||
nt|othered1: USA has won this set (2 Buffett points).  |pg||
nt|othered1: Next set scheduled to begin at the bottom of the hour.  Bye for now.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: Aggregate score after 2 rounds: Europe-USA 8-16|pg||
nt|othered1: -100 is excellent for EW|pg||
pc|c5|nt|stigw: Makes 3 !!!  trumph-tricks for the defence I guess.|pg||
nt|flash: thnx again, all; we hope to see you back here tomorrow and/or on another BBO Vugraph presentation|pg||
nt|psridhar: a certain win on the bd i expect for europe|pg||
nt|kaapo: 3NT made only 10 tricks on board 10 in the open room. A board for USA there. So Europe need to win boards 11 and 12 to tie the match|pg||
nt|othered1: Might be hard for Europe to win 11|pg||
nt|kaapo: Very hard|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks all and bye for now.|pg||
nt|kaapo: Thanks, bye|pg||
nt|petergill: website for Daily Bulletins, News etc is http://www.buffettcup.com/|pg||
nt|flash: von Arnim can play on Clubs to get a pitch, but that lets Zia score his @H3 - a trick for a trick|pg||
pc|c2|nt|suketbombi: 6@Cs 2@S and a3@H a possible make  5@Cs was|pg||
nt|yvesj49: jeff had to ruff with 7 @h|pg||
nt|yvesj49: not obvious|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hard start for the twins but they are now well in the play lol|pg||
nt|jbgood: this is the toughie of the toughies - Buffet points on a squeeze overtrick on the last hand of the set!|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|daman: @S ruff|pg||
nt|rv: looks like only 8 tricks now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: oops|pg||
nt|mrdct: so 16 either gets thrown out or the bridge lawyers get involved|pg||
nt|odysseus69: we can see that it is a simple matter to take the rest- Brogeland is concerned about 4-1 spades|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: but possibly East didn't expect so much from West (although everything is in the right places) - remember this EW pair open  ad respond very light|pg||
nt|stigw: This ought to be a sure + for Europe.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes high standard needed to win anything here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: now Duboin can make 5|pg||
nt|xenya: this might make up fot the disaster on the previous hand |pg||
nt|bigtrain: this looks like it risks -2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @D pitch and defensive surrogate trumps|pg||
nt|mrdct: on 16 there is quite a bit of precedent that if a good result is obtained at one table and then the board is fouled at the other |pg||
nt|mrdct: table - the director can rule against the side that fouled the board|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Sabine will be disppointed with herself if she goes down 2 here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|drewsky: HArd for Levin to see that...|pg||
nt|lml: I dont know|pg||
nt|lml: West can't have much less|pg||
nt|rv: can East be strip squeezed?|pg||
nt|mrdct: it is usually the responsibility of north to orientate the board correctly at the table so it could go against europe|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: but down 1 it will be|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm oh well|pg||
nt|jbgood: not coming, so a win for Europe here|pg||
nt|flash: all (sensible?) roads lead to 11 tricks...   picking one has proved difficult  :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rmb1: @CQ to tkake finesse, and eventually finesse in diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: smooth duck best|pg||
nt|yvesj49: sure|pg||

pc|s4|nt|kaapo: Thanks and bye|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: here it shows ow difficult the wonderful game of bridge is. Even the best defenders and declarers losing tricks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jgc: Oh boy, this was not optimum defence.|pg||
nt|flash: that can make; if it does, Europe will win the board and clinch a tie|pg||
nt|flash: thnx all; go watch some more bridge - back at the top of the hour|pg||
nt|jgc: Bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzrg: 12 tricks made|pg||
nt|flash: thnx, Terry |pg||
nt|flash: scorecard corrected; thnx again, all|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|flash: Europe now +1 in Match C|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|flash: on this layout, the defense can't beat 3@H; however, declarer might well have cashed his side-suit winners b4 starting the xruff lines|pg||
pc|sT|pc|dT|pc|h9|nt|flash: and, perhaps, might well have ruffed a @D at trick 2|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|flash: scores coming in for the B match - Europe +1 through 4 boards|pg||
nt|flash: playing the last board there|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|flash: overtricks now; potentially very costly|pg||
pc|hA|mc|9|nt|flash: so Europe will win this match and will apparently tie match C...   a belated 5-1 round for Europe|pg||
nt|flash: restart (if it happens) at the top of the hour|pg||
nt|flash: 102 - 84 USA|pg||
nt|flash: the Cup is headed back across the Atlantic|pg||
nt|flash: Curiously enough, the 'Home' team has never won in 3 tries. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: The recipe is jet-lag|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then you win it|pg||
nt|flash: since this competition is modeled after golf's Ryder Cup, i was most interested to see|pg||
nt|flash: BBC News headline:  Ryder Cup plea over bridge cards...   turns out to be about paying tolls on Severn River bridges to get to Ryder Cup site...|pg||
nt|flash: as long as we're staying open a while, any questions about the competition, the scoring, what we've seen over these 4 days?|pg||
nt|flash: The web site for the competition is www.buffettcup.com.  Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|flash: they'll probably have a wrap-up edition of the Daily Bulletin posted later today|pg||
nt|flash: i'm asked about the short matches in the Individual segment - time constraints suggest short matches|pg||
nt|flash: also, the length of the matches determine the number of Buffett Points available|pg||
nt|flash: 4 per match in Pairs and Teams; only 2 per match in the Individual|pg||
nt|flash: i believe we've received confirmation that the remaining matches will be played|pg||
nt|flash: we hope that the players continue to put their best effort into the play|pg||
nt|flash: again, the NPCs select the teams; availability (and finances) undoubtedly enter into the picture|pg||
nt|flash: Board-a-Match (Point-a-Board) is usually viewed as the purest and most difficult form of the game|pg||
nt|flash: it's immensely difficult to play and tends to favor the strongest teams|pg||
nt|flash: it used to be the usual alternative to matchpoints, at least at US tournaments|pg||
nt|flash: Mark Low brought the Swiss pairing concept to short-match IMP scoring |pg||
nt|flash: and that brought in many more players for the team competitions|pg||
nt|flash: about time to close and re-open with match 10|pg||
nt|flash: we'll play a full round-robin of 11 matches|pg||
nt|flash: The competition includes Pairs, Teams and an Individual.  All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board).  In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available:  a ...|pg||
nt|flash: win, a tie and a loss.  ANY DIFFERENCE in the score, no matter how small, decides the Board.  We'll have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
nt|flash: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints:  every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the Board.  |pg||
