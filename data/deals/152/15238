nt|mamos: ah of course if the opp has the wrong declarer   -- we think its Rodwell the play won't work easily either :(|pg||
nt|haans: new for us all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: the twins often play canape iM openings so Diamonds then Spades shows long diamonds|pg||
nt|jacksond: at least in hearts you can get to the dummy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a problem in auction|pg||
nt|h_karluk: impossible twofold 3@c|pg||

nt|sybarra: how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 points for a win, 2 for a tie, 0 for a loss|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 12 points at stake again|pg||
nt|blewah: these are arguably the world's two of the very best woman pairs|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not the best lead|pg||

nt|mamos: wow|pg||
nt|haans: rare to bid 5m if 3nt possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin studies this trick in depth|pg||
nt|ady: e/w would have comfortably won the board in the very safe game of 5@D    part score only in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: nine now|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rado: declarer will try to restrict losses since even 1 trick may score a win|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: UDCA for NS|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: will he be able to keep it to down 2 only? or the inevetable down 3....|pg||

nt|ady: hi   was in open room   but needed here    4@H  in OR    might make as cards lay|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rado: still endplay position after cashing all @C and @H|pg||

nt|westjava: the battle of the year 2010!|pg||
nt|jeanhari: though Auken is trying|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H now lets it make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: forcing defence (@s lead and early ruff) another deterrent factor|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: or will she cash the setting trick first?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: no hurry there, I think|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not easy for Justin|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: as long as declarer has 2 trumps, yes|pg||
nt|udo: still -2 and a decent score,,maybe the board|pg||
nt|ady: I see 4@H did make|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jan_jansma: surely a diamond. Good she takes het time now, though|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C clear enough :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jan_jansma: well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: A very loud bang from the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: The director runs past|pg||
nt|westjava: really, Ant?:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meanwhile, Sabine Auken continues to think, head resting on her hand|pg||

nt|sybarra: good |pg||

nt|h_karluk: players. her most important person in her life is her husband Mr Sid Brownstein :)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: seems Geoff disagreed abt Klinger's 100 winning tips|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: ah, this one was a "player's hand in the way of the card" issue :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there Ron described overcall principles|pg||
mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. But Americanized, 1/2 added |pg||

nt|bobholl: J of @H is a very fine card|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good raise by Auken, but maybe 2@H would have won it too|pg||

nt|blewah: for 9 tricks if @s led|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Mackwell cxomparing with Helgemo|pg||

nt|jeanhari: close call here, as would be the play in 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 1-0 to Europe  as Fantoni Nunes stopped in 2@S in OR|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: Sementa - "I might have passed a splinter"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe dbl over 4@s wld lead to 4@s disaster|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: dont understand 2nt at all|pg||
nt|rado: maybe 4+fit and some defense:)|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@d maybe forced|pg||
nt|westjava: East will support, of course|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3NT for north south no problem|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mcphee: I did not think a @C would be led after the splinter|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: they make all the tricks on the normal @DK lead|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mamos: no heart guess now |pg||
nt|blewah: this is a sequence of invitational @h supp|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ant, i hope our boss did not read your words abt a convention:)|pg||
nt|ady: dont think europe will get anything from this hand |pg||
pc|h8|nt|westjava: I think East shd take an extra action|pg||
nt|westjava: might be 3@H better|pg||
pc|h6|nt|h_karluk: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared.  Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team.|pg||
nt|westjava: so do I|pg||
pc|hT|nt|oliverc: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|stc: the good choice to play on @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: good he didn't lead the T of @C|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mamos: the auction took some twists and turns - 3nt looked alikely contract   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hello welcome back|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jacksond: south can bid 2s on her second bid because they play2/1 forcing to game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts are not friendly|pg||
nt|rado: 2@D relay 2@H 3-4 cards natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: might be keeping low because of the scoring I guess|pg||
nt|westjava: West down grade her stiff @DK|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh just as bad :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff sluff|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|haans: Justin against Weinstein|pg||
nt|oliverc: this looks like a difficult game to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Sabine Auken sometimes visits USA, a nice lady from my unit 160, district 7 <Miss Joyce Hampton> hires her for top events and they win&scratch in teams|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5@C denies @S control?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: then 5@D now? (@S control)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kiwi_joker: Am told 2@C is a mixed raise, 3 cards|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|haans: DOUBLE and get the point|pg||
nt|haans: or support spades later|pg||
nt|h_karluk: even 1N is available by N|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: NS was vul|pg||
nt|ady: hackets have started very well|pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|oliverc: No problems from here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: x not a must|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: Fantoni Nunes in 3@C at the paired table   so Bob Hamman need to make to win the board|pg||
nt|mcphee: declarer will attempt eleimination here|pg||
nt|jacksond: sememta/duboin have stopped in 4s in other room so this wiil be a swing |pg||
nt|jeanhari: tempting to balance with 2NT with north hand over 2@H|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|rado: DBL may give room for NS to find better place|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: this puzzles me 100%. OK I am lost....|pg||
nt|rado: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how|pg||
nt|h_karluk: probably wld ruff at tb, @c pitch at hand wld better|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jan_jansma: OK, 6@D was a try for 6NT|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5 or 7 now|pg||
nt|bobholl: restricted choice in @C and no rpoblem|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: Nunes did a nice hold-up with @cA|pg||
nt|oliverc: I still only count 8|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mcphee: well I guess not:(|pg||
nt|h_karluk: shortness might be your partner's winner, why not to lead it before declarer dumps somewhere|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: with no clue|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: he will just bang down @HAK|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: (slowly)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Yes, much thought at the moment|pg||
nt|sybarra: may try the spade up now?|pg||
nt|westjava: or now a @H finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Closed room are in 3@H, so all a matter of overtricks now|pg||
nt|sybarra: may play @H to the ace and a club up also |pg||
nt|westjava: she still count Levin's hand|pg||
nt|blewah: @h has to guess but @s will likely give in to N from the bid|pg||
nt|blewah: and if n continues, will create trump problem|pg||
nt|westjava: make decision, a @H drop or finesse |pg||
nt|blewah: yes, that would be my prediction too for W|pg||
nt|westjava: dont touch your @S, Arya:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: she is likely certain where the K of @H is,  question is layout |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: BAM is Super MP Best pairs (team) close to always win :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes after @dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers considering @D8|pg||
nt|blewah: so Eur in this tm has won the match regardless what will happen to the last 2 boards|pg||
pc|s5|nt|udo: 10 tricks now,,,,,good score|pg||
nt|haans: S will not pass this time but why start with 2nt|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: close to sqz tempo|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ady: 11 or 12 tricks   no difference here|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|h4|pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: yet we dont know|pg||
nt|jacksond: a swing but to who is yet to be determined|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say Jill levin solved her @hJ problem then the picture changes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far this deal is a potential candidate to the bulletin|pg||

nt|oliverc: excellent score|pg||

nt|rado: from E side if partner has singleton @H or @C and normal opening 4@S would be easy|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: that 110 doesnt look too flash a score on  2..anyone in NT will surely amass at elast 120|pg||

nt|bobholl: was afraid of over ruff may be|pg||
nt|h_karluk: needed very little at the table|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|h_karluk: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @d lead but....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i prefer neg x level 4@d|pg||

nt|h_karluk: but was almost a yarborough there|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: hi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The inaugural event in 2006 in Ireland was won by USA, but Europe equalised two years later in Kentucky, USA.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|udo: what is the westhand worth?   for me straight 4@S|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1-1|pg||

nt|oliverc: NT's the only making game here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still safe|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am ok to 3@d as East|pg||
nt|haans: 4@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi Jon, good to see you again|pg||
nt|ady: if they try 3NT   likely to fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: berkowitz would definitely have hard times|pg||
nt|jacksond: hi jon|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1NT (F) to show a weak @S raise later|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwi_joker: ..and in this form of scoring, losing the board by 10 is same as losing it by 1400 ... its  a minus|pg||
nt|mcphee: because it only gets 1 trick at most and may pass timing to the offense|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score  hand    looks like 10 tricks in clubs for n/s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you can also put your partner to an early hook|pg||
nt|westjava: cant find a @S lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unlucky lead, helps to decl to pitch @d loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however transportation problem|pg||
nt|jacksond: in fact of course he has no diamond loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we see that, dK stiff|pg||
nt|jbgood: will not be easy to get the 11 needed to half the board|pg||
nt|jacksond: stiil hard to make 11 tricks as i other room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: who would not try @cQ hook then @sK wehen hold pitch a @d at hand|pg||
nt|rado: 4@S has a little better chanses than 4@H|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: experts NEVER pass an opening bid from partner (at Teams) nonvul vs vul) !!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: NEVER|pg||
nt|westjava: yup, handle with carefully|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: (not to get to game themselves, but to prevent the oppo from reaching one)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 3@C shows either 5+@Ss&4@H or @S and @C GF|pg||
nt|ady: showing their stoppers    but not enough for 3NT to make|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mamos: again 3NT looks an obvious place to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers asks about leads; "3rd and 5th"|pg||
nt|haans: need 4@Sx to get points in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @H4 out|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *when|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: (in this case, both of course :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: and there are plent of tricks  is slam out of the question?|pg||
nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|stc: best lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: today bobby levin and alan sontag starred about the opening leads|pg||
nt|oliverc: Difficult to get the hand wrong, though|pg||
nt|udo: if she places @C king with south,,she can win and finesse @H for @C discard,,has to risk diamond to hand and hope they are not 5-0|pg||
nt|stc: the Q is if you take the hook in @h or not|pg||
nt|oliverc: right|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes but @d lead would help declarer, pitches @c|pg||
nt|haans: double: in case you want to pass|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to guess @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @S lead may make|pg||
nt|jeanhari: some bidding by Sabine, not even sure of some kind of fit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: till to here USA 79, Europe 65|pg||
mb|5D|nt|oliverc: will just claim 11, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 6nt not easy|pg||
nt|haans: sqz possibilities|pg||
nt|mamos: Meckstroth Rodwell 's +140 beat Helegemo Helness' 130 on Board 1  to win the first board for them  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: fantoni would obviously try to knock out @h AK|pg||
nt|ady: sensible auction  though if Meyers could have doubled 3@S for penalties that would win the board|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @CJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: @s lead and? :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the answer is Brogeland:)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: or Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: but only 10 available|pg||
nt|h_karluk: clubs|pg||
nt|ady: J@D lead can get 300|pg||
nt|jeanhari: BAM-dbl :)|pg||
nt|ady: well done  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@d may be unanimous in the field|pg||
nt|ady: only have to negotiate club position if east ducks twice|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bobholl: lot of upgrading from meckstroth but in BAM all is well that ends well|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oliverc: Can't afford the @D to hand, though as it exposes the K@D once North takes the A@S|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: sing @H now looks normal|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mamos: The norwegians have bid 6NT on this hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: I mean there is no net gain|pg||
nt|udo: u are rite,,,so the lead was the winner for USA|pg||
nt|udo: @D lead other room|pg||
nt|oliverc: indeed|pg||
nt|bobholl: 135 is popular :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|haans: ahalim: W will be strip-squeezed ME agree|pg||
nt|jeanhari: would be very clever to gove declarer the extra entry to finesse in clubs twice|pg||
nt|jeanhari: still must play hearts from the table too|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meckstroth leans forward, elbows on the table, cards face down in a pile|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: staring at the dummy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting individual format, still usa-europe camp. normally individual is an event all players make partnership.|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no easy return|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Jeff musing abt @s count and 3@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seeing @sK defence not much hard|pg||
nt|jeanhari: the longer it takes , the more I expect Sabine to make it|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @H she can make if guessing rigth|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in general 3rd 5th leads widely accepted, the picture would appear |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @S4@C3 towards the front of the hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h switch - table's weakness, follow the old book|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meckstroth apologies, and continues his thinking|pg||
nt|h_karluk: before long suit stopper knocked out|pg||
nt|h_karluk: needs 3 more tricks to set|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @dK, 2 hearts |pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: clubs, but @h A favborablhy placed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : favorably|pg||
nt|udo: not to forget the 2@C bid of course|pg||
nt|mcphee: the next @H applies pressure on S hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: not clubs lead in 6nt|pg||
nt|mamos: 5NT looks like pick a slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3-3 @h break then makeable one|pg||
nt|bobholl: !K not sure |pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer would obviously hook trumps|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 10 tricks on accurate defense, which we can expect|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|stc: another chance|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i shut my eyes not to see @h hook|pg||
nt|udo: next door NS bid 1@H and 3 @H so @C and @D never mentionned|pg||
nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
nt|oliverc: The hand pretty much an open book now, though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@h? oh acolish|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,the brothers|pg||
nt|udo: acol|pg||
nt|oliverc: I think it has to be the @H hook now at this form of scoring|pg||
nt|oliverc: Can't afford NOT to make 11 tricks from here|pg||

nt|h_karluk: to have a worldgrandmaster title you must be world champ and lotsa placing points|pg||
nt|mcphee: mexican 2@D for strong 18-19 balanced hands, balanced, no 5 card suit I believe is how this pair use it|pg||

nt|ady: 6@C  on trump finesse|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mamos: slightly odd position for West  p opens the bidding  oppo bid a slam and you need to save|pg||
nt|haans: maybe 2 clubs losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: most use WJS so 2@S could not be a minimum hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: as you have a lot of stress rebidding over a 2NT rebid from partners|pg||
nt|westjava: and 2nt is forcing?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Italians try a new partnership : Augustin Madala  Antonio Sementa, i guess in five years that will give good results|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in 2/1 passed hands are nonforcing|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT can fail on the same position|pg||
mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: i think 2@d over x would give much chances, ie responder would raise to 4@c --  i know it tells 6/4 @h+@s|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h not easy to find|pg||
nt|h_karluk: was a wrong input by operator, was not a psyche|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i think 2@c was drury|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: yes, as soon as West looked for his notes everyone knew he was checking for Drury, so NS allowed them to agree it regardless of the convention card|pg||
nt|jeanhari: dbl very questionable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's ok Ant, so far so good|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double indicates clubs|pg||

nt|mamos: safely done  as you would expect|pg||
nt|haans: all to USA :)|pg||
nt|westjava: duboin though his hand was too good for an immediate 4@c-bid (Texas for @h)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but many chances, total 14 boards|pg||
nt|blewah: pass was the good decision by E|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Last board in this set now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry as south|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|h_karluk: bcos of stiff @s Q|pg||
mb|r|nt|haans: does Levin have a transfer bid|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** BUFFETT CUP IN RUNNING Currently USA 50  EUR 46****|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely 5@d but a novel problem|pg||
nt|mcphee: well well 3N must be a bad minor pre-empt|pg||
nt|mcphee: bad suit that is what I mean|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3N always cold|pg||
nt|westjava: I am with you Bob|pg||
nt|h_karluk: friendly layout there|pg||
nt|westjava: I never do thet|pg||
nt|westjava: *that|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N not cold from S at all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @cQ lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: we return with Hampson-Weinstein  vs Helgemo-Justin H on this table, and many more pairings on the other tables|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: In about 25 mins|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mamos: EW will surely bid and make 4@S here|pg||
nt|udo: same biding so far|pg||
nt|stc: I don't see what can go wrong if dec plays trump before @d (keeping the 10@h in dummy)|pg||
nt|udo: in the other room 2@H-4@H followed now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or @c lead and @h back|pg||
nt|westjava: what's wrong with 3@D opening?|pg||
nt|blewah: strong club|pg||
mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: they were good enough : 1 Boye BROGELAND - Espen LINDQVIST Norway 0.82 2. 2 Claudio NUNES - Fulvio FANTONI Italy 0.71|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: strong @C in action|pg||
nt|sybarra: is 2 @S game force? |pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: 4@S no make|pg||
nt|haans: will they land in 3nt?|pg||
nt|westjava: strong suit I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrj: board being played with Sontag as N!!!|pg||
nt|oliverc: can they stop at 3@S?|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps they are playing transfer pre-empts|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html|pg||
nt|bobholl: escaped a @C lead  the guessers|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Weinstein apologieses, "I went for a little difference@@|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: honestly surprised to 1@s overcall, 2@s fine in many books, glad Ron Klinger did not see that overcall|pg||
nt|haans: odds for going wrong in spades|pg||
nt|westjava: heheh|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: just three red tricks to lose|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean direct wjo|pg||
nt|westjava: 7 cards fir 4@D??:)|pg||
nt|rado: 1@H is transfer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is a fast table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they bid and play very quick|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: if so that wont work|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|haans: but tempting|pg||
nt|ady: might stop out of game|pg||
nt|westjava: *for|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but in practice very hard to find @c lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Yes, last board now!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: restart in 30 mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Berkowitz - "She has a better takeout double than you :)"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and my homework wld b done, wow|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|kiwi_joker: might be tempted to play this one in NT instead of spades, because of the allure of the higher score|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems angels whisper to try 5@d|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt easier to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: most players prefer to pick a M suit opening lead |pg||
nt|mcphee: how hard is it to find A@H lead against 3N?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and Boye Brogeland, still the world's top ranked Junior|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@D, natural and @S support, do you play this, Shirley?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: diet coke with gree lime time, brb|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *green lime|pg||
nt|jacksond: its a long story hamdi but of course Boye is World champion and it was unfortunate that for whatever reason Norway didnt field their strongest team in the last ewuroean ...|pg||
nt|jacksond: Championships|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: a short suit game try at the 2 level. I never saw that before|pg||
nt|rado: will declarer find Q trumps:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: no |pg||
nt|sybarra: I play 2/1 |pg||
nt|westjava: the same|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3N?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 NT is on but lucky|pg||
nt|h_karluk: haha Ant, cool|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kiwi_joker: hmm.. didnt think it would die at the 2 level|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 2@h cue not fit as obv seen, just stopper|pg||
nt|h_karluk: all pass expected here|pg||
nt|oliverc: Even 3@S may be too highNunes may go one more|pg||
pc|c5|nt|westjava: I play precision|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|haans: Mackwell boys have played BAM before Sure they know |pg||
nt|mamos: it's difficult to imagine this auction at imp scoring|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@d could be fatal|pg||
nt|haans: solid bidding|pg||
nt|mamos: North had a good hand  Im not sure shed quite expect this shape from South   but game reached :)|pg||
nt|ady: so far|pg||
nt|haans: question is could N pass 4@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: AJtx|pg||
nt|jbgood: club shift?|pg||
nt|jbgood: not that it is needed - 3@h will go down 1 on any defense (but one)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it wasn't Norway's decision, NPC Paul Hackett of England has selected twelve players from different countries of Europe|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed Oliver|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think wld bring +660 for NS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks all around|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|ady: well done got to the right spot|pg||
nt|blewah: 4@s is par i think and decl must have a hard time figuring if all the missing aces are in S's hand|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos: but 4@S may well make here so may turn out tob e the wrong deision  |pg||
nt|haans: shevek: Helgemo plays in 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: Helgemo Helness have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 @C too even luckyer|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|blewah: 1 down 2 to go for guessing A/Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: S totally quiet with 3 aces may not be easy to see|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: if he could pass 4@D  I am sure he would not on that hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: my guess is that would be the normal opening lead to gambling 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: short spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems straightforward eleven tricks|pg||
nt|ady: meyers mad a tight 1NT hand 16|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|mcphee: then the @C swithc is obvious|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you lose when K onside and p has Q, just give up a trick|pg||
nt|jbgood: now 2 down|pg||
nt|ady: hand 17  the 460 looking good to maybe win the match|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we are 6 tables all days|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: falcons vs pigeons, let's see which wing would rise the trophy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 1N, 2@d dislike|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: but could he he did not have cards to slam|pg||
nt|mamos: she|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: This board will not be scored at this board :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: I will open 3N against you more often then:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant long minor|pg||
nt|westjava: fault no.1|pg||
nt|bobholl: 12 tricks on a double squeeze (rodwell found it) but in @S|pg||
pc|h8|nt|westjava: for gambling 3nt, I lead a gambling honour at other (M) suit|pg||
nt|jacksond: 2NT in other romm was a grwat result for europe and was  likely to win board anyway.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: diet coke sweetened with splenda also good, however i prefer diet coke lime|pg||
nt|haans: sry she|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which may be vital when there's unknown minor suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Nunes fans his hand|pg||

nt|bobholl: after the double hampson should bid 5@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because South would be confident partner has 8 hcp and spades|pg||
