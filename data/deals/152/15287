nt|andersk: I like to open 15-17 NT with east hand here|pg||
mb|d|mb|1H|nt|haans: right now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 1 strongish NT is certainly possible here, if your system allows it.  Mine doesn't with M 2-2.|pg||
nt|andersk: In Lithuania many probably play polish club, right?|pg||

nt|vugraphzsc: Sorry it was alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: short 1 trick i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: And it was a transfer to spades|pg||
nt|andersk: strange 2 NT, imo|pg||
nt|othered1: Very aggressive, if natural (unless it shows 17-18 or so)|pg||
nt|ybob: upgrade |pg||
pc|c5|nt|andersk: upgrade when you got a double behind you, still strange|pg||
nt|othered1: 8 tricks and needs help for a chance at 9|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe 1@H shows values too 7+ and E shows 18 hcp bal|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andersk: I dont count as well as you, Ed!  I can only count 6 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: well not easy|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|rnmalik: 2 Aces and a K with N and pass. Otherwise difficult to visulise the hand with S.|pg||

nt|april7: weak 2 opener|pg||
nt|haans: re all|pg||
nt|ybob: can declarer have J @C and play A at trick 1 ?|pg||
nt|andersk: yes, If he is afraid a switch, but this time, no!|pg||
nt|othered1: Unlikely, and at matchpoints something on which to act,perhaps.  But it's nice to ensure you beat games at imps|pg||
nt|ybob: with JXXXX and JXX its impossible|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: and 4@S  probably by N going down on a @D lead|pg||

pc|h4|nt|sybarra: thats better |pg||
nt|sybarra: assuming Q |pg||
nt|othered1: He'll go after @H tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: for beginners 3NT did show spades or he should not have bid Stayman|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|haans: double finesse in @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: why not take the @C hook? |pg||

pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: what am I missing |pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think your Aunt Minnie had the right idea|pg||
nt|sybarra: of course she always played for 2/2,  (when the experts went down)  she cracked me up |pg||
nt|mdgraham: it is a safety play, of sorts, catering for @CK singleton offside|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|dburn: less dangerous when East is a passed hand, and West's opening is very likely to be a weak no trump|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|haans: good play|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|haans: can end with endplaying South|pg||
nt|sybarra: Pszczola=Pepsi,  since no one can say his name  (or spell) |pg||
nt|andersk: the downside is to miss a Major fit, the upside is that you show strength, so If pard have enuff to invite or enuff to game, he will staymanbid, and you find the majors|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 6. The lesson unless you have a major please dont use staymen.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: only good choices|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|sybarra: stilll making 6 |pg||
nt|haans: backway play|pg||
nt|sybarra: 8 bd matches are a challenge,  you need to score (or not lose)  fast |pg||
nt|dburn: well, given that he made game opposite a six count, maybe his hand wasn't so bad after all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|haans: i have seen players using Stayman 1nter bid 2@H and bidding to 6nt missing spades :)|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, a 6-count that produced 3 tricks against defense to 1N, not 3N.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|suketbombi: 2@H seems to be a openeing hand looks like is 1@H a denail?|pg||
nt|haans: yes short matches more like MP|pg||
nt|sybarra: East finding this bidding "fascinating" |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: East will have a problem if West doubles |pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: however, he hasn't. |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: the ended right FAST|pg||
nt|dburn: curious - would have expected West to raise clubs|pg||
mb|2D|nt|april7: this time 4@S by transfer played by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: original East bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: MIlner,  with smile says "thx pard" |pg||
nt|mdgraham: I confess I would double with that West hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you Mike |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Does anyone know anything about there system?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree, they do it to confuse opps and get minus score themselves.|pg||
nt|haans: and me|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: yes  on a @S lead declerer wud have been scared of East hand but he well placed now|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if south could have doubled negatively on second round?|pg||
nt|andersk: I would|pg||
pc|c8|nt|april7: EW could try for slam, |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|andersk: FIFO|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|othered1: Even with the ominous @S stiff, I'd double, t hen backpedal the rest of the way|pg||
nt|dburn: no doubt he could have done, but perhaps he feared a light opening bid opposite|pg||
nt|andersk: Fast In Fast Out|pg||
nt|ybob: i like a pass from S and W over 2@C|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|andersk: why do you want a ruff with KTx in @D?|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe two ruffs|pg||
nt|ybob: other move was K @D|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|haans: down to NT play|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps what he wants to do is force declarer to draw trumps, so that his side can cash more than two club tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andersk: 2 ruffs, when partner passed 2 @C, I doubt it|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: can E get the ruff?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|haans: easy play|pg||
nt|suketbombi: may end up lossing 2/3 imps on this bd west by no strech of Imagination had an Vul vs NV over call with that hand|pg||
nt|haans: rite u r :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: i wonder why he did not to for 800+|pg||
nt|rnmalik: claim time.|pg||
nt|othered1: a low ruff and later trump trick, rather|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|april7: if possible to show singleton @C, but W to strong in singleton suit, so invitation rejected|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told  pszczo³a=bee in english:)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dburn: or perhaps he hoped that West's third trump would be a little higher than the four, so that he could promote it with a fourth round of clubs|pg||

nt|haans: 1 down can be costly |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 6@D?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|h_karluk: it is the captaincy principle, east had no reason to look for 12 tricks with that holding|pg||
nt|ybob: cold 4@H, cheaper safety in 4@S|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|nt|ybob: needs lead @C to defeat|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: 3@D in my book extra + GF|pg||

nt|haans: 3nt to hard|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks standard auction for all of us |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: unfortunately it will also put North on lead, and he will not lead a heart|pg||
nt|othered1: and you need @S lead to beat 5@H.  But played from north, that's likely|pg||
nt|dburn: but South may bid - he doesn't know he can beat four spades|pg||
