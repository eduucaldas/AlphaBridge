nt|mamos: ah of course if the opp has the wrong declarer   -- we think its Rodwell the play won't work easily either :(|pg||
nt|haans: new for us all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: the twins often play canape iM openings so Diamonds then Spades shows long diamonds|pg||
nt|jacksond: at least in hearts you can get to the dummy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a problem in auction|pg||
nt|h_karluk: impossible twofold 3@c|pg||

pc|h3|nt|vugraphzrj: Justin asks about carding - didn't hear answer sorry!|pg||
nt|ady: even at this scoring I tht 3NT an unlikely spot    if South had the 4th club this would have been bad for the Hackets|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think "mostly upside down", but I could be wrong|pg||
nt|ady: or could have been|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: W thinking|pg||
nt|mamos: wow|pg||
nt|haans: rare to bid 5m if 3nt possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin studies this trick in depth|pg||
nt|ady: e/w would have comfortably won the board in the very safe game of 5@D    part score only in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: nine now|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: no hurry there, I think|pg||
pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: as long as declarer has 2 trumps, yes|pg||
nt|udo: still -2 and a decent score,,maybe the board|pg||

nt|h_karluk: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
nt|udo: 2@C ( for majors) passed out in the other room|pg||
nt|rado: and when 430 vs 420 it's still 2:0 |pg||
nt|haans: First board to Norway|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|kiwi_joker: 1@S really? How quaint|pg||
nt|mamos: i think the twins are comparing with Levin and weinstein  who are playing Helgemo and Helness who have scored +130 in  3@D|pg||
nt|mamos: Europe won 16-8 this morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: very light 3rd pos 1@S|pg||
mb|2H!|an|3/4!H|nt|stc: many guesses in @s contract|pg||
nt|rado: now E might bid some constructive fit raise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cool Liliek, jill is a great personality, always humble and she doesn't even play a lot of bridge  world championships, trials. most of her close woman friends aren't even bridge ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: players. her most important person in her life is her husband Mr Sid Brownstein :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: NA style is to o/c with the S hand as opposed to a t/o dble|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. But Americanized, 1/2 added |pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1-0 Hampson here|pg||
nt|rado: 6@H makable now|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: no clue about the rest of their bidding. Lets see if they finish in 4/5/6@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: hmmm|pg||
mb|3C|an|6!C|nt|haans: Mackwell cxomparing with Helgemo|pg||
nt|mamos: the twins play very aggressive 4 card majors  with 1NT 14-16 so open 1M on hands like this routinely|pg||
nt|udo: solid contract,,3@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: 1-0 to Europe  as Fantoni Nunes stopped in 2@S in OR|pg||

mb|3D!|an|asks|nt|h_karluk: this is a wild contest, reminds me "topgun" movie :) we will see best of bests|pg||
nt|ady: hackets have opted for no-trumps in this scoring method   might have come unsuck on a club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: dont understand 2nt at all|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: the auction took some twists and turns - 3nt looked alikely contract   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hello welcome back|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jacksond: south can bid 2s on her second bid because they play2/1 forcing to game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts are not friendly|pg||
nt|rado: 2@D relay 2@H 3-4 cards natural|pg||
mb|5C|an|odd keycards|mb|p|nt|haans: Justin against Weinstein|pg||
nt|oliverc: this looks like a difficult game to make|pg||

nt|haans: or support spades later|pg||
mb|6H|nt|haans: NS was vul|pg||
nt|ady: hackets have started very well|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|oliverc: No problems from here|pg||

nt|haans: 4@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi Jon, good to see you again|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: berkowitz would definitely have hard times|pg||
nt|jacksond: hi jon|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1NT (F) to show a weak @S raise later|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kiwi_joker: ..and in this form of scoring, losing the board by 10 is same as losing it by 1400 ... its  a minus|pg||
nt|mcphee: because it only gets 1 trick at most and may pass timing to the offense|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score  hand    looks like 10 tricks in clubs for n/s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you can also put your partner to an early hook|pg||
nt|westjava: cant find a @S lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unlucky lead, helps to decl to pitch @d loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however transportation problem|pg||
nt|jacksond: in fact of course he has no diamond loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we see that, dK stiff|pg||
nt|jbgood: will not be easy to get the 11 needed to half the board|pg||
nt|jacksond: stiil hard to make 11 tricks as i other room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: who would not try @cQ hook then @sK wehen hold pitch a @d at hand|pg||
nt|rado: 4@S has a little better chanses than 4@H|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: experts NEVER pass an opening bid from partner (at Teams) nonvul vs vul) !!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: NEVER|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: (not to get to game themselves, but to prevent the oppo from reaching one)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 3@C shows either 5+@Ss&4@H or @S and @C GF|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mamos: again 3NT looks an obvious place to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers asks about leads; "3rd and 5th"|pg||
nt|haans: need 4@Sx to get points in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @H4 out|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *when|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: (in this case, both of course :))|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos: and there are plent of tricks  is slam out of the question?|pg||
nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|stc: best lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: today bobby levin and alan sontag starred about the opening leads|pg||
nt|oliverc: Difficult to get the hand wrong, though|pg||
nt|udo: if she places @C king with south,,she can win and finesse @H for @C discard,,has to risk diamond to hand and hope they are not 5-0|pg||
nt|stc: the Q is if you take the hook in @h or not|pg||
nt|oliverc: right|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes but @d lead would help declarer, pitches @c|pg||
nt|haans: double: in case you want to pass|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|oliverc: will just claim 11, I guess|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|haans: 6nt not easy|pg||
nt|haans: sqz possibilities|pg||
nt|mamos: Meckstroth Rodwell 's +140 beat Helegemo Helness' 130 on Board 1  to win the first board for them  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: fantoni would obviously try to knock out @h AK|pg||
nt|ady: sensible auction  though if Meyers could have doubled 3@S for penalties that would win the board|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @CJ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: @s lead and? :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the answer is Brogeland:)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: clubs|pg||
nt|ady: J@D lead can get 300|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|oliverc: Can't afford the @D to hand, though as it exposes the K@D once North takes the A@S|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: sing @H now looks normal|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: The norwegians have bid 6NT on this hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: I mean there is no net gain|pg||
nt|udo: u are rite,,,so the lead was the winner for USA|pg||

nt|mcphee: the next @H applies pressure on S hand|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|haans: not clubs lead in 6nt|pg||
nt|mamos: 5NT looks like pick a slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3-3 @h break then makeable one|pg||
pc|hT|nt|stc: another chance|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i shut my eyes not to see @h hook|pg||
nt|udo: next door NS bid 1@H and 3 @H so @C and @D never mentionned|pg||
nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
nt|oliverc: The hand pretty much an open book now, though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@h? oh acolish|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,the brothers|pg||
nt|udo: acol|pg||
nt|oliverc: I think it has to be the @H hook now at this form of scoring|pg||
nt|oliverc: Can't afford NOT to make 11 tricks from here|pg||
