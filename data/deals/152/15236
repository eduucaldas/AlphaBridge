nt|mamos: ah of course if the opp has the wrong declarer   -- we think its Rodwell the play won't work easily either :(|pg||
nt|haans: new for us all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: the twins often play canape iM openings so Diamonds then Spades shows long diamonds|pg||
nt|jacksond: at least in hearts you can get to the dummy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a problem in auction|pg||
nt|h_karluk: impossible twofold 3@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Liliek:)   welcome|pg||
nt|blewah: hi pak Liliek|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to make 5@d a complete guess because of two way @c finesse|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: good|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: where NS make game with their 18HCP :)|pg||
nt|rado: 4@S seems ok|pg||

nt|sybarra: ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 points for a win, 2 for a tie, 0 for a loss|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 12 points at stake again|pg||
nt|blewah: these are arguably the world's two of the very best woman pairs|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not the best lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: hello all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Among the soundtracks she has done are Forrest Gump, Good Will Hunting and the last five Woody Allen movies.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: EW carding is UDCA|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzrj: Justin asks about carding - didn't hear answer sorry!|pg||
nt|ady: even at this scoring I tht 3NT an unlikely spot    if South had the 4th club this would have been bad for the Hackets|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think "mostly upside down", but I could be wrong|pg||
nt|ady: or could have been|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||

nt|mamos: wow|pg||
nt|haans: rare to bid 5m if 3nt possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin studies this trick in depth|pg||

nt|mamos: nine now|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

nt|h_karluk: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
nt|udo: 2@C ( for majors) passed out in the other room|pg||
nt|rado: and when 430 vs 420 it's still 2:0 |pg||
nt|haans: First board to Norway|pg||
nt|rado: I meant win|pg||
nt|haans: USA still a good lead but Europe improving|pg||
nt|westjava: might be a flat board I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: overkilled  sabine |pg||
nt|jeanhari: he didnt discards his diamond?|pg||
nt|bobholl: he did i guess otherwise not 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: yeah, missed a card there - but claim right after|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jan_jansma: 10-14 with @C|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: its ok|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kiwi_joker: 1@S really? How quaint|pg||
nt|mamos: i think the twins are comparing with Levin and weinstein  who are playing Helgemo and Helness who have scored +130 in  3@D|pg||
nt|mamos: Europe won 16-8 this morning|pg||
nt|bobholl: they are always playing fast if you don't like it :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rado: very light 3rd pos 1@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: scoll down on the home page,  beautiful picture, looks like old castle |pg||
nt|westjava: classic!|pg||
nt|blewah: 4@h seems playable for EW |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: it's a lovely playing room, big oil paintings,  exposed brickwork, and a stag's head on the wall|pg||
mb|d|nt|stc: many guesses in @s contract|pg||
nt|rado: now E might bid some constructive fit raise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cool Liliek, jill is a great personality, always humble and she doesn't even play a lot of bridge  world championships, trials. most of her close woman friends aren't even bridge ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: players. her most important person in her life is her husband Mr Sid Brownstein :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: NA style is to o/c with the S hand as opposed to a t/o dble|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems Geoff disagreed abt Klinger's 100 winning tips|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: ah, this one was a "player's hand in the way of the card" issue :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there Ron described overcall principles|pg||
mb|3H|nt|h_karluk: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. But Americanized, 1/2 added |pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1-0 Hampson here|pg||
nt|rado: 6@H makable now|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: no clue about the rest of their bidding. Lets see if they finish in 4/5/6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.bridgeindia.com/Buffett_cup/Warren_Buffett_Cup_2010_Wales_UK.html    is my favourite website for this event. Have a look|pg||
nt|westjava: or 3 nt|pg||
nt|blewah: 3nt will face @s threat|pg||
nt|blewah: though @cq is dropped|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
nt|ady: may be a heart guess for 10 or 11 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: J of @H is a very fine card|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good raise by Auken, but maybe 2@H would have won it too|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: hmmm|pg||
nt|blewah: for 9 tricks if @s led|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Mackwell cxomparing with Helgemo|pg||
nt|mamos: the twins play very aggressive 4 card majors  with 1NT 14-16 so open 1M on hands like this routinely|pg||
nt|udo: solid contract,,3@D|pg||
nt|stc: looks like a win for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hey Ant, gl there|pg||

nt|jeanhari: close call here, as would be the play in 4@H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: 1-0 to Europe  as Fantoni Nunes stopped in 2@S in OR|pg||
nt|mamos: even 10 points counts as a win so Justin trying for the NT bonus|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 3rd and 5th leads|pg||

nt|h_karluk: a nice slam @s there|pg||

pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: this is a wild contest, reminds me "topgun" movie :) we will see best of bests|pg||

nt|bobholl: surely would have|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: dont understand 2nt at all|pg||
nt|rado: maybe 4+fit and some defense:)|pg||
nt|blewah: 2@d maybe forced|pg||
nt|westjava: East will support, of course|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3NT for north south no problem|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mcphee: I did not think a @C would be led after the splinter|pg||

nt|blewah: this is a sequence of invitational @h supp|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|westjava: I think East shd take an extra action|pg||

pc|d6|nt|mamos: the auction took some twists and turns - 3nt looked alikely contract   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hello welcome back|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jacksond: south can bid 2s on her second bid because they play2/1 forcing to game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts are not friendly|pg||
nt|rado: 2@D relay 2@H 3-4 cards natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: might be keeping low because of the scoring I guess|pg||
nt|westjava: West down grade her stiff @DK|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh just as bad :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff sluff|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dT|nt|haans: Justin against Weinstein|pg||
nt|oliverc: this looks like a difficult game to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Sabine Auken sometimes visits USA, a nice lady from my unit 160, district 7 <Miss Joyce Hampton> hires her for top events and they win&scratch in teams|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5@C denies @S control?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: then 5@D now? (@S control)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Am told 2@C is a mixed raise, 3 cards|pg||

pc|h2|nt|haans: NS was vul|pg||
nt|ady: hackets have started very well|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|oliverc: No problems from here|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mamos: Fantoni Nunes in 3@C at the paired table   so Bob Hamman need to make to win the board|pg||
nt|mcphee: declarer will attempt eleimination here|pg||
nt|jacksond: sememta/duboin have stopped in 4s in other room so this wiil be a swing |pg||
nt|jeanhari: tempting to balance with 2NT with north hand over 2@H|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rado: DBL may give room for NS to find better place|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: this puzzles me 100%. OK I am lost....|pg||
nt|rado: :)|pg||

pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: Nunes did a nice hold-up with @cA|pg||
nt|oliverc: I still only count 8|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mcphee: well I guess not:(|pg||
nt|h_karluk: shortness might be your partner's winner, why not to lead it before declarer dumps somewhere|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jan_jansma: with no clue|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: he will just bang down @HAK|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: (slowly)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Yes, much thought at the moment|pg||
nt|sybarra: may try the spade up now?|pg||
nt|westjava: or now a @H finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Closed room are in 3@H, so all a matter of overtricks now|pg||
nt|sybarra: may play @H to the ace and a club up also |pg||
nt|westjava: she still count Levin's hand|pg||
nt|blewah: @h has to guess but @s will likely give in to N from the bid|pg||
nt|blewah: and if n continues, will create trump problem|pg||
nt|westjava: make decision, a @H drop or finesse |pg||
nt|blewah: yes, that would be my prediction too for W|pg||
nt|westjava: dont touch your @S, Arya:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: she is likely certain where the K of @H is,  question is layout |pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: BAM is Super MP Best pairs (team) close to always win :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes after @dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers considering @D8|pg||

mb|2D|nt|h_karluk: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||

nt|h_karluk: hi Jon, good to see you again|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: berkowitz would definitely have hard times|pg||
nt|jacksond: hi jon|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1NT (F) to show a weak @S raise later|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: ..and in this form of scoring, losing the board by 10 is same as losing it by 1400 ... its  a minus|pg||
nt|mcphee: because it only gets 1 trick at most and may pass timing to the offense|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: part score  hand    looks like 10 tricks in clubs for n/s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you can also put your partner to an early hook|pg||
nt|westjava: cant find a @S lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unlucky lead, helps to decl to pitch @d loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however transportation problem|pg||
nt|jacksond: in fact of course he has no diamond loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we see that, dK stiff|pg||
nt|jbgood: will not be easy to get the 11 needed to half the board|pg||
nt|jacksond: stiil hard to make 11 tricks as i other room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: who would not try @cQ hook then @sK wehen hold pitch a @d at hand|pg||
nt|rado: 4@S has a little better chanses than 4@H|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: experts NEVER pass an opening bid from partner (at Teams) nonvul vs vul) !!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: NEVER|pg||
nt|westjava: yup, handle with carefully|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: (not to get to game themselves, but to prevent the oppo from reaching one)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 3@C shows either 5+@Ss&4@H or @S and @C GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: again 3NT looks an obvious place to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers asks about leads; "3rd and 5th"|pg||

nt|h_karluk: *when|pg||

nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|stc: best lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: today bobby levin and alan sontag starred about the opening leads|pg||
nt|oliverc: Difficult to get the hand wrong, though|pg||
nt|udo: if she places @C king with south,,she can win and finesse @H for @C discard,,has to risk diamond to hand and hope they are not 5-0|pg||
nt|stc: the Q is if you take the hook in @h or not|pg||
nt|oliverc: right|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes but @d lead would help declarer, pitches @c|pg||
nt|haans: double: in case you want to pass|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to guess @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @S lead may make|pg||
nt|jeanhari: some bidding by Sabine, not even sure of some kind of fit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|oliverc: will just claim 11, I guess|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: 6nt not easy|pg||
nt|haans: sqz possibilities|pg||
nt|mamos: Meckstroth Rodwell 's +140 beat Helegemo Helness' 130 on Board 1  to win the first board for them  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: fantoni would obviously try to knock out @h AK|pg||
nt|ady: sensible auction  though if Meyers could have doubled 3@S for penalties that would win the board|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @CJ|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s lead and? :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the answer is Brogeland:)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: or Q|pg||
pc|dA|nt|oliverc: but only 10 available|pg||
nt|h_karluk: clubs|pg||
nt|ady: J@D lead can get 300|pg||
nt|jeanhari: BAM-dbl :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobholl: lot of upgrading from meckstroth but in BAM all is well that ends well|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oliverc: Can't afford the @D to hand, though as it exposes the K@D once North takes the A@S|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: sing @H now looks normal|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|mamos: The norwegians have bid 6NT on this hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: I mean there is no net gain|pg||
nt|udo: u are rite,,,so the lead was the winner for USA|pg||
nt|udo: @D lead other room|pg||
nt|oliverc: indeed|pg||
nt|bobholl: 135 is popular :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: ahalim: W will be strip-squeezed ME agree|pg||
nt|jeanhari: would be very clever to gove declarer the extra entry to finesse in clubs twice|pg||
nt|jeanhari: still must play hearts from the table too|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meckstroth leans forward, elbows on the table, cards face down in a pile|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: staring at the dummy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting individual format, still usa-europe camp. normally individual is an event all players make partnership.|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no easy return|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Jeff musing abt @s count and 3@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seeing @sK defence not much hard|pg||
nt|jeanhari: the longer it takes , the more I expect Sabine to make it|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @H she can make if guessing rigth|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in general 3rd 5th leads widely accepted, the picture would appear |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @S4@C3 towards the front of the hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h switch - table's weakness, follow the old book|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meckstroth apologies, and continues his thinking|pg||
nt|h_karluk: before long suit stopper knocked out|pg||
nt|h_karluk: needs 3 more tricks to set|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @dK, 2 hearts |pg||
pc|d8|nt|h_karluk: clubs, but @h A favborablhy placed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : favorably|pg||
nt|udo: not to forget the 2@C bid of course|pg||
nt|mcphee: the next @H applies pressure on S hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: not clubs lead in 6nt|pg||
nt|mamos: 5NT looks like pick a slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3-3 @h break then makeable one|pg||
nt|bobholl: !K not sure |pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer would obviously hook trumps|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 10 tricks on accurate defense, which we can expect|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|stc: another chance|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i shut my eyes not to see @h hook|pg||
nt|udo: next door NS bid 1@H and 3 @H so @C and @D never mentionned|pg||
nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
nt|oliverc: The hand pretty much an open book now, though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@h? oh acolish|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,the brothers|pg||
nt|udo: acol|pg||
nt|oliverc: I think it has to be the @H hook now at this form of scoring|pg||

nt|sybarra: did we find out the bang?   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess that would be a flat result|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: major minor battle|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good luck to our operators, the guys at the table are REAL PROFESSIONALS, i believe 2nd day everything would become easier|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: The hotel's router is having an off-day|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: I suspect it|pg||
nt|mcphee: mexican 2@D |pg||
nt|mcphee: a handy toy in fact|pg||
nt|westjava: can explain,Bob?|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N might well be a choice here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: antonio sementa is 19th rank in world grandmasters list|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@D open|pg||
nt|westjava: I am told 18-19 balance|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to have a worldgrandmaster title you must be world champ and lotsa placing points|pg||
nt|mcphee: mexican 2@D for strong 18-19 balanced hands, balanced, no 5 card suit I believe is how this pair use it|pg||
nt|mcphee: the 5 card suits alter a hand a lot|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps we can "re enact" the boards at the end |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Yes, I have the play written down, so I can enter after the players have played board 26|pg||

nt|jeanhari: so good result for europe|pg||
mb|1S|nt|haans: do assume 2@S som form or reverse Flannery |pg||
nt|mamos: ahggressive bidding as usual from NS  |pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: this saves a lot of energy|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Bob|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: Justin consults the notes, and Hampson helpfully plays the 2@C bid for him|pg||
nt|bobholl: enough for 3@D ? i wouldn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: (the players are allowed to refer to the notes as they are all made to play a "standard system")|pg||

nt|haans: good 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: EW leads are quite compex, and their explanation is rather hushed - sorry!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think low show even engouraging, or odd discouraging|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a psyche|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mamos: 5@D making so Italians certainly needed to bid 5@S|pg||
nt|rado: 1@H made harder for EW|pg||
nt|haans: 3rd hand wins again|pg||
nt|mamos: in OR|pg||
nt|jbgood: Duboin decided to enter the bidding in the OR - cost the board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they have many special gadgets but unfortunately yet not much hands occurred to show that skills|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@d was another option for west players|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Helgemo - "never accept gifts from opps"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and as east even pass to 2@d would be available|pg||
mb|4C|nt|h_karluk: i thought walddk7 new at th town and not experienced like boss, but i m caught :) gr8|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzrj: @D3,@D8 being considered|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: and 6@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The inaugural event in 2006 in Ireland was won by USA, but Europe equalised two years later in Kentucky, USA.|pg||
nt|mamos: Helness  passed 2@S|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry 2@H|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: slightly odd position for West  p opens the bidding  oppo bid a slam and you need to save|pg||
nt|haans: maybe 2 clubs losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: most use WJS so 2@S could not be a minimum hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: as you have a lot of stress rebidding over a 2NT rebid from partners|pg||
nt|westjava: and 2nt is forcing?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Italians try a new partnership : Augustin Madala  Antonio Sementa, i guess in five years that will give good results|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in 2/1 passed hands are nonforcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i think 2@d over x would give much chances, ie responder would raise to 4@c --  i know it tells 6/4 @h+@s|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h not easy to find|pg||
nt|h_karluk: was a wrong input by operator, was not a psyche|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: sorry!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no worries, happens|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: thanks for spotting it though :)|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||

nt|udo: perfect fitting hands,,,,,@S 3-3|pg||
nt|oliverc: I would think everyone here was alerted :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @hA+9 would be interesting|pg||
nt|jeanhari: @D K will make guess easier|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @H ruffs in S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 2@c was drury|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: yes, as soon as West looked for his notes everyone knew he was checking for Drury, so NS allowed them to agree it regardless of the convention card|pg||
nt|jeanhari: dbl very questionable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's ok Ant, so far so good|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double indicates clubs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lead directing|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I get the impression the dbl was made partly for lead-direction and partly for comic value after the discussion :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hehe|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @D now migth beat it anyway|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|oliverc: everything|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's true mf|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mamos: with 11 points|pg||
nt|mcphee: those 2N jump rebids also eat up room creating little issues|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: well played|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: Jumping to 2M = to weak to bid natural :)|pg||
nt|mamos: I can imagine that at some tables EW will be bidding minors|pg||
nt|haans: 1@d-1@S-2@d- do you have cards for 2@H forcing?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they did it with a delay and different way, w passed, then after xx |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: say allowed by both then @c9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but @h 8 still firm even covered|pg||
nt|jbgood: Sælensminde is back to playing Broge's "old" system - more or less the same Broge played with Odin Svendsen i Pau this summer|pg||

nt|udo: 5th push board in a row|pg||
nt|udo: now way to go wrong, and no way for 11|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@c pre-sacrifice, might want them to put into a doubt they miss 4@s or not|pg||
nt|bobholl: fairly lucky result NS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fine result in my book|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if we focus on the field, all around sharks :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and to be honest, 1@h seems a good idea to me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just 3rd seat, passed partner, both nonvul|pg||
pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: two hearts and a spade for defenders|pg||
nt|westjava: some one told me : nt=trf to 3@c, 3@d=trf to 3@h: to play or slam try, 4@h mild slam try @h|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|haans: @HQ chance play|pg||
nt|mamos: Rodwell attacking his side suit first|pg||
nt|Walddk7: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. However, the scoreboard is americanized for obvious reasons, so we ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: must live with 1-½-0 on the scoreboard. I am sure you can figure it out regardless|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer claims after touching trump|pg||

nt|mamos: but 4@S may well make here so may turn out tob e the wrong deision  |pg||
nt|haans: shevek: Helgemo plays in 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: Helgemo Helness have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 @C too even luckyer|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|blewah: 1 down 2 to go for guessing A/Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: S totally quiet with 3 aces may not be easy to see|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: if he could pass 4@D  I am sure he would not on that hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: my guess is that would be the normal opening lead to gambling 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: short spades|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|mcphee: then the @C swithc is obvious|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you lose when K onside and p has Q, just give up a trick|pg||
nt|jbgood: now 2 down|pg||
pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: falcons vs pigeons, let's see which wing would rise the trophy|pg||

nt|mamos: she|pg||
pc|c9|nt|haans: This board will not be scored at this board :)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i meant long minor|pg||
nt|westjava: fault no.1|pg||
nt|bobholl: 12 tricks on a double squeeze (rodwell found it) but in @S|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|westjava: for gambling 3nt, I lead a gambling honour at other (M) suit|pg||
nt|jacksond: 2NT in other romm was a grwat result for europe and was  likely to win board anyway.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: diet coke sweetened with splenda also good, however i prefer diet coke lime|pg||
nt|haans: sry she|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which may be vital when there's unknown minor suit|pg||

nt|bobholl: 6 made|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for example, 1@h<1N>pass, 2@c <2@h> would lead to 3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: after the double hampson should bid 5@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because South would be confident partner has 8 hcp and spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: That was the last board of this set; restart in 25 mins|pg||
