nt|granguru: Wie geht es euch alle Heute?|pg||
nt|granguru: Good day all of you|pg||
nt|lestergold: tighten up the screws til they break hopefully in ur opps face|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: argument for both but in a way a pass by east is the best decription  of his hand- up to u pard|pg||
mb|2D|nt|granguru: I would have opened weith 1N in E|pg||
nt|haans: easy 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: weak NT is common in Germany|pg||
nt|Gerben42: as are negative free bids |pg||
nt|granguru: could lose 2@H and 2@C|pg||
nt|granguru: oki|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the 4-1 break is somewhat unlucky|pg||
nt|granguru: 28%|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but still >50% play strong NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzzf: yes, E/W play 12-14 NT|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|granguru: @S gives a discar for @C|pg||
nt|granguru: discard|pg||
nt|haans: but any one that makes it are an idiot|pg||
nt|hawe45:  IÂ´am glaf, that I was late - otherwise I would have had to comment on this "so-called" @S-bid...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: Hi Hans|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Gerben42: well you have 6 of them and its MP|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: Yes and therefore 5@h - or?|pg||
nt|lestergold: at that stage he doesnt know pard may have a penalty double of 4S may only have four hearts with thehearts breaking 5/1 etc etc|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|hawe45:  hi all|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|h7|nt|haans: spade now for sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A question of style may-be, but lead-directing an overcall might be now and then|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi Hans! you have a new nick!|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Had forgotten the old code|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|Gerben42: good reason :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|c8|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|granguru: you can change it|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Gerben42: safe to cross in @S, 1@S on 7 small seems strange|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mmmakela: so 10 and next|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|s6|nt|granguru: no promotion possible|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|Gerben42: still might take a bit to find safest way|pg||

nt|ralfwil: the @c discard from E costed one tring to -1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: trick...|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|granguru: an hybrid hand..|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Gerben42: simply 4cM|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: this is a likely flat bopard a row of 3N+1s i would think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: here playing weak nt changes which side plays 1 nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you if its playeed by east it could be a diamond lead and 3n+2 of course|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Gerben42: N might have doubled then S plays it|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: players playin 15-17 no trumps will open east with N|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|granguru: west should play the surrounding play in @S to make 4 @s tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: and dim lead becames very likely|pg||
nt|lestergold: although many would choose a less dangerous lead at mps|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|granguru: that is @SJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mmmakela: meaning W didn't open 1 nt|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c4|pc|d7|pg||
mc|10|nt|lestergold: North must be fairly senior he has been around for a long time |pg||
nt|lestergold: of course a very famous player|pg||
nt|lestergold: the only thing i do not like about pairs is the wait between hands|pg||
nt|ralfwil: typical for pairs:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: inevitable for logistic reasons|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also discipline by players....|pg||
nt|lestergold: so i thionk Raif you should sing and dance for the specs|pg||
nt|lestergold: ive run out of broadcastable jokes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 30 years ago|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Fore about 40 years I could imagine, but now i prefer a beeer|pg||
nt|lestergold: and i cant sing unless everyone has earplugs|pg||
nt|lestergold: what do you know about the other players Raif|pg||
nt|lestergold: I know nothing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in fact I had a career but 50 years ago...|pg||
nt|lestergold: what sort of career|pg||
nt|ralfwil: just nothing. I have not met anyone of them|pg||
nt|vugraphzzf: Again we have two German Juniors at the table...|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: still will pass it I guess *g|pg||
nt|mmmakela: strong option of multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: that will cost a precious trick|pg||
nt|haans: lot of 10 use one one :)|pg||

nt|Gerben42: still was happy to accept Greek gift|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so the old truth that west shd dbl after this bidding in pairs right again|pg||
nt|Gerben42: requires a very understanding pd|pg||
nt|haans: Old truth a little strong :)|pg||
nt|haans: truth any times 2nt do not make|pg||
nt|mmmakela: stats say it goes down more often than makes(was once in Bols tips if I recall right)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but do you gain more MP than you lose is a different question|pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe not all in 2NT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: brb get some coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphzzf: next: Günther/Schlicker|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzzf: 25% for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: coming tio 9 tricks would have been difficult without the strange cover of the qC by south|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think this is possible on a crossruff|pg||

nt|hawe45:  3 @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: except by inspired lead of club|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: perhaps @H ... but most play it as TO|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: yep|pg||

nt|lestergold: but i dont think many will defeat this|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d4|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: on e ruff not good enuf because the heart loser goes on the long club|pg||
pc|s9|mc|9|nt|lestergold: and how many mps to NS is that?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a cartload i presume|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Slam now - better than partscorees|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: will make it tough to find slam I fear|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6nt/@D|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No - North has a mountain facing a 2 NT-hand|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S invit if weak 2 in hearts|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: natural here for e/w to bid to 4S but... the minor suit layout very unfriendly|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: my guess was 4@s but this will go down|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzzf: misclick ;-)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the trick here is to play in NT not dias because matchpoints |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but not any longer|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this ace of club lead not as successful as thye last one|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|haans: or spade ruff|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|Gerben42: now decision time...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so many Kings |pg||
nt|hawe45:  But a fast board from now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if strong field 6 dias will score little under average my estimate|pg||
nt|haans: S may have a void|pg||
nt|haans: N|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: question is may S correct?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of the story win some lose some|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: @cA was not on my map|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: no mine|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|c3|nt|vugraphzzf: 33%, two pairs played 6NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so far|pg||
nt|haans: 2 of who many?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Anyway, bidding to 6 @D will not bring, what the germans call "Tapferkeitsmedaille..."|pg||
nt|Gerben42: two sections, 4th round, so in total 8 pairs played it I guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzzf: yes, that can be but I am not sure...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i am :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: is this Swiss pairs because NS remain the same pair? so are they leading?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: no its mitchell|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: my lead was quiet heart|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: mine also|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sQ|mc|10|nt|lestergold: well not many flatboards at this table|pg||
nt|vugraphzzf: at this time for @cA lead just 8%|pg||
nt|hawe45:  GOOD EVENING, NOW MY GRANDCHILD HAS FALLEN ASLEEP...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: always welcome Hans!|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Hans well so are we falling asleep between hands here but then we are awakened with a jolt usually when they get played|pg||
nt|hawe45:  hi-hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: Dirk S has got a thing about banging down ace of clubs on opening lead first timeit earned him 83% next time only 8% average below 50 so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzzf: look at the scores of the first session: http://www.bridge-verband.de/images/uploads/ftp825/09_11_21_dma.html|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a little bit slow now - late in Germany too?|pg||

mb|3D|nt|hawe45:  Oh - a tricky 6 @H|pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: so they earned constant seating because last year's winners or why?|pg||
nt|haans: good sac in clubs|pg||
nt|Gerben42: there are 4 seeded pairs|pg||
nt|lestergold: double brave by east|pg||

nt|lestergold: please stick to need to know thingsLukas|pg||
nt|vugraphzzf: here at the table they just drink water :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4D for n/s fine|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think 4 of a mjaor here goes off e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|lestergold: oh dear |pg||
nt|vugraphzzf: the player on east dont want to be mentioned by name...|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bidding misunderstanding of majopr proprtions- n/s cold top i would think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easts double comes from another planete|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|Gerben42: no must be 8 even|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here East should have bid 5 @d!!!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: NS and EW in two groups on two tables|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 6 points unpassed hand partner can protecgt on these hands|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mmmakela: agree Hans W|pg||
nt|Gerben42: true, maybe 3@D was an underbid to start with|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - but East could have recovered|pg||
nt|lestergold: a planet without a name a bit like east|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ralfwil: and on my screen he is called anonymous... and want also to bee|pg||
nt|hawe45:  CouldÂ´nt we just write the 670|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: i would nevertheless have bid as west|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d8|pg||
nt|Gerben42: will be good for NS now|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|haans: good bidding by Fritsche|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best bid on first round: 4 @d from EAST|pg||
nt|mmmakela: maybe that shows void|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|s2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still beating all games|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean - pd has made an overcall vulnerable - take a LOOK at that EAST-hand,pls.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mmmakela: ace splinters are sometimes good but more often (imo) very bad|pg||
pc|s3|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And this board proves, why an overcall - even vulnerable - is NOT six cards to the 7...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - or 8|pg||
nt|mmmakela: partner can't evaluate his assets properly if 4 points can be in the splinter suit or somewhere else|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West values in @D are the same facing a void as facing the bare Ace|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Mike I could imagine a major game as W|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hawe45:  OH - 870...|pg||
nt|lestergold: west should really bid 4D|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|mmmakela: this time yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: asking partner to pick a game|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hawe45:  South has opened 1 @D|pg||
nt|haans: 3@D did not show anything in @D just invite in @H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But how can you invite with that East hand. I am closer to 6 tnah to part score|pg||
nt|haans: and only invite by E no slam|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|c5|pg||
nt|haans: agree :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @D is NOT a good bid - but simply the BEST|pg||
nt|hawe45:  claim|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h4|nt|lestergold: always ten tricks|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: make it harder for NS to find clubs|pg||

pc|c7|pc|sJ|pc|hJ|nt|hawe45:  And last trick with @D 7 = one Bier|pg||

mb|1D|nt|mmmakela: don't think more than 50% will bid slam|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: and they play MP|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: on last hand did Fiedler hit the roof?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s internaional|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad joke  geddit all?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: a very strong hand for polish 1NT... almost looks like nat. one :)|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt 5 clubs + 4 M 11-16|pg||
nt|mmmakela: it's good for both|pg||
nt|vugraphzzf: mattson told they play polish i think...|pg||
nt|vugraphzzf: fiedler told his partner, that he didnt understood the X|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: hm 4S can be made there is a winning option and a losing one|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hawe45:  I thougt N/S played the negativ double|pg||

nt|granguru: In Geneva|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the Rosenblum, not the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|granguru: ok|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|c8|pc|dT|pc|c6|pg||
mc|10|nt|ralfwil: my keyboard doesn´t spell so well this evening.....|pg||
nt|lestergold: an argument for west to bid 5D as west has no dfence to 4S whatsoever|pg||
nt|lestergold: that would give east a choice of the reds|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps west is more to blame|pg||
nt|lestergold: ie if pard cannot double 4S then west knows its making so hcan afford 300 away|pg||
nt|lestergold: another upside of west bidding is that n/s may get thiongs wong and bid one more! one too many!|pg||
nt|lestergold: w see it all the time|pg||
nt|ralfwil: isn´t 5@h from E the best alternative to save? If not there must be a 4-4 fit in @c|pg||
