nt|haans: SA Players was:  Alon Apteker Christopher Henry Bosenberg  Tim Cope Neville Eber Craig Gower |pg||
nt|haans: So we can be quite certain that the Africans know how to play |pg||

nt|sybarra: hello all  |pg||
nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||
mb|1S|nt|haans: hi :)|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Sorry Hi|pg||
nt|sharkey: I understand these are the two top ranked teams meeting here|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|chthonic: East was a bit light to make a takeout double, but it would have resulted in a heart contract. making four, it appears|pg||
nt|xenya: so that was an Acol 2@C opening by E?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|haans: think not :)|pg||
nt|haans: we do not have any system cards|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe it was -- after all he has 8 playing tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: either strong or a 8 trick playing hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: strong bal|pg||
nt|xenya: so an ideal hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: N shut out EW who can make 4@S with some luck|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|chthonic: West was too balanced and light to act|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: unlucky start for EW :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roz Bernstien is our operator (I think) |pg||
nt|sybarra: *Bernstein |pg||
nt|sybarra: @H  lead best but how to know that ?|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|sybarra: sure  |pg||
nt|sybarra: although not many entries to dummy either|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: yeah 3@D did the trick|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|sharkey: E shud have continued with trumps|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chthonic: Rather luckily.  Hearts 3-2, singleton spade honor, club queen onside third.  Not too much good fortune.|pg||

nt|hcbfick: Will the auction be the same as the closed room?|pg||
nt|hcbfick: yes therefore any oppurtunity lost is BIG|pg||
nt|rado: 8 card suits usually bring level 5:)|pg||

mb|4D|nt|sunsamvar: Hi Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like small omission - N should open 1 @c|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or not?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: very funny bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, indeed|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi all!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Markku|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hi|pg||
nt|mmmakela: we had technical probs 1st session, seems they continue|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 1st session in the open room was perfect|pg||
nt|mmmakela: in CR we missed 4 1st boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|vinbtech: a successful exercise in cue-bidding will keep them off the non-making slam here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rado: pessimistic approach by N gave room for EW|pg||
nt|hcbfick: I'm faking,kissing is not my strength:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed, but you have to guess well in order to make 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Playing South for Ax in hearts|pg||
nt|hcbfick: very well but the layout is favourable|pg||
mb|p|nt|hcbfick: yes|pg||
mb|5C|mb|5D|nt|vinbtech: break in tempo |pg||
mb|p|nt|hcbfick: not anymore|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There will also be a restricted choice position in diamonds|pg||
nt|rado: after seeing void in @S declarer will play correctly for QJ @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When you cash a top honour and you see the queen or jack drop|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|vinbtech: whats S thinking about now ?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: what was N thinking about before ?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: A heart was an unlucky lead for the defence|pg||

nt|haans: sure|pg||
nt|haans: what a start|pg||
nt|xenya: well strictly speaking, there is no game here for EW, though 3N might have a practical chance|pg||
nt|yo_yo: slam time|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Slam for NS, 6@S better|pg||
nt|sharkey: Cheap save for NS - it was hard for EW to enter due to the balanced hands|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam coming up|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Slam a bit ambitious and does not make with 3-1 hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: sp 3 off might not be a great disaster -- we shall see|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|haans: 3@C lead directing?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@D from W showing @D + Major|pg||
nt|sharkey: ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: assume puppet|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|chthonic: Either in diamonds or hearts.|pg||
nt|chthonic: Dealing with multi -- assume NS will cope|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @H looks off|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and North might support them eventually|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: E will be delighted to hear it's @S - dont know if he'll continue past game as no outside controls|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: multi been on for 40 years now time to find defense|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6NT is also a possibilty|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but not for long :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: of course NT ok too :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so anything but @H OK  we think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
nt|sharkey: N - 4@H?|pg||
mb|3C!|an|5-5 minors|nt|chthonic: That may spur action that will be regretted.|pg||
nt|chthonic: Nope.|pg||
nt|sharkey: N may have helped as E bid voluntarily|pg||
nt|sharkey: W will bid slam now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 9 off the top  |pg||
nt|chthonic: Well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: they are playing bds 1 - 14|pg||
nt|xenya: S's sequence probably show a very good hand with long @Ds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok ok mos  @C might not make :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am never good in 2/2 fits |pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont know what 4 NT will accomplish here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: now the lead of a @S could give another |pg||
nt|sybarra: actually can always lead up towards the q of QS |pg||
nt|haans: my choice for sure|pg||
nt|chthonic: 11 tricks should be easy|pg||
nt|haans: spade finesse = 12|pg||
nt|haans: low risk|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: q of @S |pg||
nt|yo_yo: the good old strong jump shift in action here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: in imps you must lead spades best chance to get them down|pg||
nt|haans: time to pass|pg||
nt|xenya: vulnerable, i would sell out here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C = One key card?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: N would like it be a declarer in 6 NT, protecting K@C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not very fashionable here any more though|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may play 6 @D?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: with a puppet sequence Hughes may have thought the club was better |pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: looks as if @D are agreed |pg||
nt|rnmalik: except @H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: need to get that suit right ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see S setting NT  given the qx of clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah but he will|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on this bidding I think it would be 6@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no, agree shirley|pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: many americans say S was not good enough for x + suit only simple overcall|pg||
nt|xenya: S feels more optimistic -- and perhaps he is right|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ooops now North has to think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he didnt give correct reply if @S is meant|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see where @S's agreed however|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no |pg||
pc|dA|nt|chthonic: Might have played a club at trick two to prevent third trump lead, maintaining control|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|haans: no gain in finesse sorry|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Vorster took control then didnt know what to do, it seems to me|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rnmalik: qx@C became threat cards|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: maybe should have tried4 @S over 4 @D wonder if that would have helped?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think if you blackwood, you have to go for it|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How did 5@CX make on board 1?|pg||
nt|haans: S decarded a hearts on clubs|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk4: Thx|pg||
nt|sybarra: and it was a @H  lead |pg||
nt|haans: so dedcl 5th hearts was good|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yo_yo: i suppose he felt North might think that was a sign off|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|sharkey: I definitely think N helped EW by bidding 4@H - if she passes E will bid 4@H - W 4@S - will E continue?|pg||
pc|h4|mc|12|nt|sybarra: yes and I would be worried also |pg||
nt|yo_yo: so a swing to Gauteng predicted here|pg||

nt|lestergold: shaekspearian quotes time|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|lestergold: to bid or not to bid that is the question |pg||
nt|lestergold: double double toil and trouble|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|vinbtech: hi Markku and Sveta|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Sveta|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5@C/ 3 nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N the likelier contract 5c the better contract|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or even 4 @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s is actually very strongifthey can reach it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes by N very good|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I vote for 3nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: Situated in the heart of the Highveld, Gauteng is the smallest province in South Africa, with only 1.4% of the land area, but it is highly urbanised and, as of 2007, has a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: population over 10 450 000, making it the most populous province in South Africa|pg||
nt|hcbfick: should it go 3@C 4@C?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rado: some may use 4@D here as Leaping Michaels|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Johannesburg is the main city in Gauteng|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When properly pronounced, the first letter of the name Gauteng is a voiceless velar fricative, pronounced similarly to the "ch" in the German "achtung" or Scottish "loch." This ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pronunciation is natural in both the Sesotho and Afrikaans languages|pg||
nt|rado: ty we start tomorow with matchpoints:)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 3N by NS here|pg||
nt|frankaus: failure to cue @H allowed them to stop at 5@SWD|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|rado: practical jump now:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And it is in Hebrew too, one of the languages I speak|pg||
nt|hcbfick: for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|hcbfick: good action by Eber here|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|hcbfick: Stephens cld have much less|pg||
nt|hcbfick: But now only 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyone for 4@D, Leaping Michaels with the West hand? Diamonds and a major, forcing|pg||
nt|hcbfick: I go with 4@C and 4@D|pg||
nt|frankaus: easy 3NT here|pg||
nt|vinbtech: provided N passes - he should actually |pg||
nt|vinbtech: taking too long to P !|pg||
nt|frankaus: surely @H not nearly good enough to bid them again |pg||
nt|vinbtech: he has shown his 6th H; and he has DA9 ; P is automatic here|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rado: a better ttreatment is to use 4@D as both Majors and 4@C as other minor + unspecified Major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This did not lead anywhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|hcbfick: Eber wanted to extract info from partner and did not get what he was hoping for? |pg||
nt|frankaus: pd oens my XX i have 3 aces only where is a slam ?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vinbtech: that 4N is certainly out of the blue (nowhere) |pg||
nt|frankaus: *opens|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stephens did not visualise such a strong hand opposite. Perhaps Eber should have bid the slam himself|pg||
nt|vinbtech: a H switch now !|pg||
nt|vinbtech: still 10 tricks on D  finesse|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|frankaus: that would be hard to do looking at that dummy|pg||

nt|vugraphzzd: sry|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: do not like 4@S here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: too many HCP with NS for 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|haans: 4 ladies i think is DI a female name?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: can there every be too many, Rashed?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Roz - are these all Lady teams?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sybarra: may blast into some large number of hts |pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: 3N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: had jumpt to 2@H or 3@H = not preemtive|pg||
nt|xenya: since NS play a weak NT, S opens 1@D intending to rebid 1N -- that would show a strong NT hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: yes  short for Diana|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt +1 most likely |pg||
nt|sharkey: E passed?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: no open  3 men & 1 woman in other room|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|haans: +3|pg||
nt|chthonic: 4S becomes a possibility|pg||

nt|chthonic: or 4H.|pg||
nt|haans: looks good for declarer|pg||
nt|haans: yep all female|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe +2  depending on lead|pg||
nt|wilson69: 3nt 10 or 11 |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|haans: best lead continue|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Placement for cards as well. No worries regarding bidding 23 or 24|pg||
nt|wilson69: 11|pg||

nt|sharkey: the men are outnumbered :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: ok|pg||
nt|haans: only a clubs finesse from slam here|pg||
nt|haans: sort of artificial 3@C (no check back im sure)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: just a 4t h suit force|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: yep :(|pg||
nt|chthonic: the spade finesse resolves all difficulties on any lead.  This lead removes anxiety for declarer|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||

nt|hcbfick: If one does use 4@C as Eber did and follow up with another bid surely he must have a monster?|pg||

nt|yo_yo: 3@D might set the cat among the pigeons here|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|vinbtech: 2D and a D off the top to lose and 1 slow trick as well - C and D not behaving that is|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 2S and a D i mean|pg||
nt|frankaus: pushy game but the red light of vulnerability can be a tough attraction to resist|pg||

nt|vinbtech: if he can manage 2 C ruffs with the H8 and 7 he will be home |pg||

pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: If you cash two rounds of spades, you go down, because then you must rely on hearts to be 3-3|pg||

nt|Walddk2: That is the proper technique indeed|pg||
nt|mmmakela: never played precision where 2 @D shows clubs+major|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|chthonic: With North's failure to double clubs, can south bid 3N?|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: CORRECT|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Vorster goes straight to game with her 6 card suit|pg||

nt|sharkey: I bid 1@S I think|pg||
