nt|Walddk2: 6NT is the best slam|pg||

mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: As it is, four slams make. 6NT, 6@H, 6@D and even 6@S|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|vbman: its normal to place missing honours of a suit between both opps, so tez may misguess cl|pg||
nt|vbman: if 1 sp may be 4 what does dbl stand for after 1h?|pg||
nt|chick: There are times when you cannot double (don't have the other suits, etc), but this hand screams double to me|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|vbman: maybe they play some gadget|pg||
