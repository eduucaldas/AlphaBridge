nt|rnmalik: again all's well that ends well:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA without drawing the last trump was not the greatest play, because when a good opponent leads dummy's suit at Trick 1, it is very often a singleton. |pg||
nt|petergill: Seniors Final from Australia tomorrow will be these teams http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=sn&E=7&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|othered1: Why would you bid 4th suit, i ntending to show a forcing raise in @S, then back off of it?|pg||
nt|haans: old style AAQcol direct 3@S only invite|pg||
nt|haans: Acol|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 15.00 hrs here |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this shd have a lively auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: South is short for der Kinderen  (Anton)|pg||

nt|rodal f: are|pg||
nt|haans: YES WE ARE :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3NT by East can make, not by West|pg||
mb|d|nt|newmoon: in the week-end pairs event, he complained bitterly when I had his name as von Kinderen...  our fault|pg||
nt|petergill: Women's Final will be http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=sn&E=5&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|othered1: they should get to 4@S quickly here.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or might it's correct "was":)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: both was and are and will be|pg||
nt|newmoon: still... how to tell North to lead a @H in NT?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcwla: 3@H the limit, how high will they get?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: my guess is the contract will be 3@H or 4@D|pg||
mb|3C|nt|haans: do they still speak afrikaans?|pg||
nt|newmoon: Anton is here (on the right) :  http://www.sabf.co.za/free_state/photos/imagepages/002.html|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D|pg||
nt|newmoon: wow   3@H vul!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: W's nice play of 3@H on 17 has paid off to the tune of 5 IMPs when the same contract failed by one in the OR, while W in the OR managed two extra overtricks in 1@C on 18 for a gain ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: of 1 IMP.|pg||
nt|newmoon: JA, ons almal praat afrikaans nog|pg||
nt|newmoon: does the trick tho|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: it is a 5 loser hand Sid|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|othered1: and nothing at all bad happens so this will make easily|pg||
nt|fann4: North shouldn't cover, but it makes no difference here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|haans: hard to find but 7@D better than 3nt|pg||
nt|fann4: He didn't have to|pg||
nt|newmoon: with some holes in @Hs, and a NT overcaller on your left... |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and if you give north the @Hq also 4 @H will come home|pg||
nt|newmoon: give West AJxx or AQxx @H and this could go for a number|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: doubled as a bonus :)|pg||
nt|newmoon: :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: 7@D only 1 down|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@D is in danger if clubs or diamonds or both are 4-1, so is only a fairly good contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: got you :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: well the 1 nt seems to suggest that west does not have the @H suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: yes but 3nt is badder|pg||

nt|haans: but flat board?|pg||
nt|petergill: Despite the 4333 shape, 3NT by West was not best, due to the high possibility that East had good shape, such as a singleton major, for the 3@D call |pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, flat board is likely, in the real world. |pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: A nice hand in E|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzd: multi|pg||
nt|newmoon: final contract?  4@S, 5@C or 5@S?|pg||
nt|haans: team that wins the contract goes down|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: But only a 2@D rebid.|pg||
nt|newmoon: another interesting hand, with the club pictures dropping.   3NT makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or 1nt?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N|pg||
nt|rodal f: A nice fight to come for a part score?|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S a make?|pg||
nt|petergill: In the real world, people like to bid 3NT , rather than help opponents find the best lead. However, getting to the best contract can be a good idea.  |pg||
nt|petergill: Trump lead might trouble 4@S. |pg||
nt|fann4: An old style Italian type take out double. an opening hand with any old shape.|pg||
nt|fann4: Not recommended here|pg||
nt|rodal f: What will S do if N bid @C now?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: ansd we all now that many of us after|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: must be forcing|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. Sr. 3NT flat EW|pg||
mb|1S|nt|newmoon: 2NT = leb|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Belive so|pg||
nt|haans: Dorfan will come back with spades|pg||
nt|bobh1: or double|pg||
nt|fann4: surely not @S?|pg||
nt|fann4: double, if anything.|pg||
nt|rodal f: X or 3@C after the bidding so fare i belive|pg||
nt|othered1: Does anyone know if they use an old Italian response method over the double, herbert or exclusion responses?|pg||
nt|haans: old days 1@S was a baby-psych|pg||
nt|bobh1: if there system allows that double then north cannot pass now|pg||
nt|fann4: 3@C on a flat 7 count with 4 trumps looks terrible.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|haans: 3@S effective bid|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@S they play as a transfer to 3NT.   2NT-3NT used for other things|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: pretty pbvious too|pg||
nt|rodal f: Max on EW. Sac for NS in @S?|pg||
nt|petergill: Acol style is for light 2-over-1 bidding|pg||
mb|2N|nt|newmoon: 3NT bypassed now.   Eber has a head-ache|pg||
nt|petergill: I predict @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: not easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: they are playing with screens, btw|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D had been easier|pg||
nt|bobh1: in trouble now|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: I would have liked 3@C better in S. Asking for pards 2nd color|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why give them a chance to exchangeinbfo?|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer might survive this good trump lead|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|petergill: My predictions are poor, as usual|pg||
nt|haans: REHI all|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: :) we all been there|pg||
nt|haans: very boody bidding|pg||
nt|haans: bloddy|pg||
nt|othered1: Would you have doubled 1@s on the north hand?  could they to show @S?|pg||
nt|bobh1: some play that double is responsive|pg||
nt|haans: yes |pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: sry  lost connection will update on result|pg||
nt|bobh1: don't think pass the first time is good bridge|pg||
nt|bobh1: if double is penalty make it; if double is responsive bid 2@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: Where do the problem come from? S and the X after 1@D. Pass and balance later!!!!!|pg||
nt|haans: right bid now not later|pg||
nt|bobh1: coming in at the the 3-level blind like this is not good|pg||
nt|othered1: I fyoui play double is responsive and opponents know it, baby psyches can reappear on  the scene.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: 3S better|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: W should double 3S to show a max |pg||
nt|rodal f: Might ure right. Would have made it easyer for NS to sac|pg||
nt|petergill: Run @CJ now?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|haans: I strongly agree with Ed|pg||
nt|bobh1: baby psyches seem to have gone out of fashion . . . so the pendulum currently favors responsive|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans:  E you mean|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: E should reopen with X also|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: no i meant W. |pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|rodal f: Mean NS over 4@C|pg||
nt|petergill: Keeping @HA for later might have been better|pg||
nt|haans: play spade and then small diamond|pg||
nt|newmoon: tr 4 - @CA and South drops the @CQ        do u @D to table and finesse a club?  restricted choice|pg||
nt|newmoon: no need - give North the club, as no @S there         9 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|jcwla: On 19, where E/W here made 4@S, in the OR their counterparts made 3NT with two overtricks for a gain of 1.|pg||
nt|newmoon: he must engineer playing @Hs twice from dummy|pg||
nt|newmoon: so 3rd @C in dummy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W can see 8 tricks facing    x   Jxxx   xx   Axxxxx.  if E has Ds they still might have 3N, and if E has hearts, game is playable facing:   x    Axxxxxx   xx   xxx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry meant 9 trix|pg||
nt|petergill: the idea being that if you never make @HA when you keep it for later, you will not make your contract anyway|pg||
nt|newmoon: @CA and @C secures, even if @CQ stiff|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|haans: good advice|pg||

nt|newmoon: oh... North discarded @Cs on @Ss ?   just saw now|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: you might|pg||
pc|c7|nt|newmoon: huh?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|haans: 2nt leb mean he may have had long diamond|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|newmoon: and South held on to those @Ss... and discards a vital @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, and then they should be OK at 4D unless E can bid 3N.|pg||
mc|7|nt|newmoon: no commentary was needed here|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: hi all Mike Gold here from England sorry a little late folks|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi, Mike. |pg||
nt|bobh1: when people start baby psyching again, which carries its own dangers, then the pendulum may swing the other way|pg||
nt|fann4: It went for 500|pg||
nt|newmoon: 6@H not 6@S, but will they... ?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rnmalik: On Board 19, 3NT a better contract and 4@S does not make with that play here.|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi shirley|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Jordan hi Rashid|pg||
nt|haans: NS do not have it easy|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt down due to @SK|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|petergill: The Italian superstars do not overcall 2@C or 2@D on 5332 shapes; most of the rest of the world seems to do so, however. |pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Or @C:) For S he find pards second color by bidding 3@C asking over the lebensol, but might 3@S was ok anyway|pg||
nt|fann4: The 'baby psyche' is so rare, and how can you worry about it on this hand.|pg||
nt|haans: i have done some this year very good effect|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think people stopped baby psyching for other reasons|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 4@D and then we're off to the races.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: LOL   S will be sorry if he doubles 4S|pg||
nt|haans: killing now?|pg||
nt|haans: penalty x rare nowdays|pg||
nt|newmoon: what should west do ?|pg||
nt|bobh1: like sometimes their partners took them seriously|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: i dont think 3D was a wise move|pg||
nt|newmoon: East may pull to 3@H...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: his pd either has a pile of clubs or a bad hand, or both. and meanwhile he likes spades as a trump suit. why bid 3D??|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S X for 100 out Marshall?|pg||
nt|newmoon: or is NORTH thinking of 3@H?   lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S doubled for 790|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has trivially easy pass|pg||
nt|haans: belladonna tended to double for take out|pg||
nt|haans: one reason none will play with you|pg||
nt|fann4: 4@C shows 2 suits - that and trumps. a better use than a splinter|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 6 nt best i think|pg||
nt|newmoon: many pairs bid an obligatory 2@D with North, and a positive with 2 of top 3 honours.   Here, 2@H certainly is the answer|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: NS are overboard|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i wd bid only 2@D with the N hand Sid|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well 6S laydown and only depends on spades splitting 1/1 is that simply close to 50%?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: easy 6 missed|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no we are off to the chicken exit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Unlucky @C spot for EW but not unwaited by the bidding. 3NT to come?|pg||
nt|newmoon: it is not North that is hesitating... N and E on same side of screen|pg||
nt|othered1: But playing double as saying only "I would have happily made that bid myself" still has lots of merit -- opponents who play "natural over doubles," 1@S forcing, might have xxxx|pg||
nt|fann4: Well bid by N, as 4@Hx is only 1 off.|pg||
nt|newmoon: ok - 6NT here we come... cold also|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3NT had some chance. East has discarding problems on the diamonds in 3NT, and might end up endplayed by the 3rd club. |pg||
nt|bobh1: yes if double is responsive then 2@s has to be natural|pg||
nt|rodal f: And 4@S 1 of since @SQ982 make 1 trick?|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S show five spades in my book|pg||
nt|fann4: 4@S is not cold, but I'd rather be there than defending 4@H|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|newmoon: quick claim  :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|othered1: declarer had best get the @S right, or EW will find the @C ruff.  And declarer knows that from the auction.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: or Kx spads onside but you have to guess|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|newmoon: now he will definitely play to @S8|pg||
nt|fann4: Needs a 3-2 trump break or play the 4@H bidder for @H shortage|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: on blaance I think i want tro be in thism slam|pg||
nt|petergill: No, I was wrong, 3NT will always fail, as Hans said|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@S u mean. Same here. A neg X would have been better. 4@S - 3@C|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will be hard for S|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|fann4: going down now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rnmalik: Why not 4@D as suggested by Jordan, W does not lose anything|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, on 20, the difference between playing the @H9 and the @HQ was 14 IMPs.  3NT making vs. -3.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard? not harder than the hard-headed bidding:)|pg||
nt|petergill: East simply has to retain 2 spades to beat 3NT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Should declarer have gotten that right after west showed length in two suits?|pg||
nt|fann4: Declarer went wrong here - the 4@C bid told him that West was heavily 2 suited, usually 10+cards in @C and @H|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: good to see there is justive is SA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobh1: i wonder if the meaning of 4@c was disclosed?|pg||
nt|fann4: If it wasn't, he should have asked.|pg||
nt|haans: if it wasnt call TD|pg||
nt|bobh1: i agree; but he may have assumed it was a splinter|pg||
nt|othered1: in ACBL, I don't think 4@C is alertable -- at 4-level after first round of auction|pg||
nt|fann4: Now E makes both his trumps, either by ruffing or by tapping dummy|pg||
nt|bobh1: in acbl not alertable i agree|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: justice in|pg||
pc|h4|nt|newmoon: South is intent to make @S5 the long trump|pg||
nt|newmoon: what else, he muses|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N is obviously squeezable|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: certainly should be explained after auction over or south should have asked, since it's not a normal bid.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|petergill: North's 3@C bid is not a great advertisement for the Acol style of bidding - I prefer a more flexible negative double of 2@D|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. Looks like an uppercut. But N can be squized|pg||

nt|bobh1: wonder if there is any discussion|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: discussion  2 or 3 down??|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: well N/S have an excellent non making 4S  contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: probably that result will keep S from overbidding ever again|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|lestergold: time to underbid for N/S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice press, but obvious|pg||
nt|petergill: If EW reach 5@C, it's not impossible that North could get squeezed in @D's and @S's in the ending|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: not possible|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: north min nt if south conservative now they go plus|pg||

nt|vugraphzzd: either both or one major|pg||

nt|rodal f: By screen? Bough sides need to alert til 3NT or at first biddinground if over 3NT I belive|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: by conservative i mean inviting with 3S|pg||
nt|jcwla: That was on 21.|pg||
nt|petergill: With screens, we see N and E's bids simultaneously, so the pause for thought would be East before the Dbl, not North|pg||
nt|haans: screen = alert|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|haans: or if decl played any little clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C is high enough, unless North gets squeezed out of a trick|pg||

nt|haans: give them 23|pg||
nt|rodal f: I mean 2 is enough, but declerer might explained him self down for 3|pg||

nt|haans: :)|pg||

nt|fann4: I can't see why it was 3 off the way the play went. Dummy had 2 trumps left, East one, and declarer had top @D|pg||

nt|lestergold: diamonds do not have to break!|pg||
nt|jcwla: The lead is going back up to 9.  On the 2@SX-1 hand here, N/S bid to 4@D-3 in the OR.  8 IMPs to KwaZulu Natal.|pg||

nt|rodal f: :) I was blind. NS already had 3 tricks:) New glasses pleace|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: double 4@S?|pg||
nt|petergill: This East doesn't like preempting at unsuitable vulnerability with a three card major = OK, but opening 3@C is also OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: not easy now|pg||
mb|3H|nt|newmoon: will they get to the GRAND?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: 3n seems to hinge on the @h guess|pg||
nt|haans: will finesse hearts wrongly|pg||
nt|fann4: 2@D game forcing checkback|pg||

mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|newmoon: you can also get VUgraph record of entire match 1 here:  http://www.sabf.co.za/interprov/round1m.htm   (Western Province versus KwaZulu Natal)|pg||
nt|rodal f: A bit unbelivable. WHY 3@C from N? Looks like he told an opening at 1@H. Any exstra to make him bid 3@C?|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|newmoon: 5@H or 5@S response?   with 8, show the Q, I suggest|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Hmm...so many other choices.|pg||
nt|newmoon: ouch|pg||
nt|newmoon: 5@S = 2 + Q or AK-8bagger|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 3@C DBL scared N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, sometimes pd has   xxxx   x     KQ    Qxxxxx|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fann4: 3NT will be very interesting. Declarer can take a @H finesse into the safe North hand, but that will be 8 tricks.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fann4: He must duck this to have a chance.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|fann4: Then a @S to the Q which South will likely duck.|pg||

pc|d2|nt|haans: not good PR for 4 card M|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rodal f: A X from E(negative and NS are in trouble. Junior bridge for me|pg||
nt|rodal f: And at 3rd @D, after pressing out @SA N will get some problems it seems|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|haans: thank you for playing the ace|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|petergill: 3@C opening might be passed out (bad for EW) or might lead South to overcall 3!NT, which might even make|pg||
nt|haans: such is life :)|pg||
nt|petergill: so East did well not to open 3@C, I think|pg||
nt|petergill: East also did well not to bid 3@C over 2@S|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: 3NT has the virtue of making comfortably.  Can even arrange for a beer.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: There's no endplay, so 2@S should fail|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|newmoon: uh oh|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have no problem with 3C personally. if you dont TRY to find a club fit, you arent going to find it. you p[robably arent in much rouble at the 3 level, esp at these colors|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fann4: Now E still has some guessing to do. Who has the @S10? |pg||
nt|haans: North must have it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|newmoon: seems @DQ discard was logical, no?   but @S10?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fann4: N is more likely to have @S length on the @D overcall, but it's not clear, and he doesn't want to go down for nothing.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sA|nt|haans: clubs Q now|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2 clubs and a D now, curtains for S|pg||
nt|newmoon: South is hiding all his dble cards after this|pg||
nt|rodal f: We might disagree a bit there. Tell ure story. Don't tell it twice. Ceep u out of trouble a lot of times. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: got what hge deserved both times. the double rates to cost a trick anyway|pg||
nt|rodal f: Forget those few times u sucseed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes well that is the whole point, N has NOT told all of his story, he has a second suit and a void and a 5 loser hand and the colors are in favor of bidding|pg||
nt|newmoon: he was influenced by that 3@C bid, I think.   Expected an ace more in N|pg||
nt|haans: agree there 3@C were not to find any game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N has an ace more, N is likely to double 4S himself|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: doubling rates to turn 200 into 200 most of the time. down 2 undoubled into down one doubl;ed|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|rodal f: Endplay to come? A @C|pg||

nt|haans: also to say p i am here u can trust me|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: N got paid for his bid and fin|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and since the auction suggests N has marginal HC values for 3C, he is likely to have a disproportionate amount of his high cards there too, especially since EW have spades. 3C is ...|pg||

nt|haans: 4nt mean = if you had 3 or 4 rebid|pg||
nt|fann4: It shouldn't have been. 4@D was surely forward-going in some way, else he'd have signed off in 4@S.|pg||

nt|bobh1: if he had shown a strong hand, maybe not|pg||
nt|fann4: I suppose E was expecting W to continue with 3 key cards.|pg||
nt|haans: i say that is a MUST|pg||
nt|rodal f: @D 2-2=40,7%       3-1 and 1-3=49,7%        4-0 and 0-4=9,6% so odd on for 7@S if EW know they have 9: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|bobh1: here he had shown nothing so if his pd is bidding blackwood, 3 KCs must be enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: odds for 2 diamonds in dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: OR started with bds 27-28, so we now have comparisons|pg||
nt|othered1: Just add that to the annals of good pairs having trouble with key card Blackwood.  |pg||
nt|fann4: Of course you would want to be in a grand after the 4@D bid - it would mostly have the @DQ|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: is 2D meant to be weak intermediate or strong?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzd: intermediate|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: on normal methods North has a good one diamond overcall much too good for a weak|pg||
nt|rodal f: And a push to come|pg||
nt|fann4: You can look at that disaster from different angles - but what did E think the 4@D bid meant.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|newmoon: 4@C pre-accept,  now 4@H = retransfer|pg||
nt|petergill: Weide chose the old-fashioned style of doubling first; the other East followed the more modern tendency to overcall one's long suit first with about 16 points|pg||
nt|fann4: From West|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H depends on spade K onside plus only one heart loser a bit less than 50% and today its sadly zero percent|pg||
nt|rodal f: Again I will follow ORDER. 3@S. What if W was by 0 honors. 4@C????|pg||
nt|bobh1: i blame West|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: not unreasonable to bid i think quite normal the clubs and diamonds well duiplicated here|pg||
nt|newmoon: or pass = re-transfer|pg||
nt|haans: maybe spades are spades :)|pg||
nt|haans: what do you think it did mean?|pg||
nt|fann4: From West's viewpoint, despite the splinter they could have been off 2 key cards.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: weak hand for 4@C|pg||
nt|haans: in love|pg||
nt|rodal f: Vug might can tell. I have no idea:) |pg||
nt|bobh1: his partner couldn't have a blackwood bid with no keycards|pg||
nt|fann4: It was surely some slam interest, else 4@S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: The more modern style is intended to cope better with those modern opponents who sometimes preempt you if you double |pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: yes not fair|pg||
nt|newmoon: KZN will bid all the games in sight now, after that missed slam|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h3|nt|jcwla: Well, opposite passed partner, there is something to be said for 2@D.  Makes opps' auctions more difficult -- though all roads lead to 4@H here.|pg||
nt|haans: right|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: Full speed. No first controll in @C but have @D que pard:)|pg||
nt|petergill: If @HK is played here, a club switch is needed|pg||
nt|petergill: I meant "if @HA at Trick"|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|newmoon: 4-card majors, I suspect       West would drury otherwise over 1@H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: got that|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: he should have gone strat for Blackwwod|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: NS give count  usually|pg||
nt|newmoon: or rather, 4-card @H|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jcwla: Right, I agree and would bid 1@D in std methods.|pg||
nt|haans: strait|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: yes its a standard tactic but North's hand is the kind which can make game opposite  a passed partner- look how little ios needed|pg||
nt|haans: sloppy|pg||
nt|petergill: so North thinks South has 3 or 5 @Ds|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobh1: 4@d was a meaningless bid...he just wanted to mention that he had support for the suit E had opened|pg||
nt|othered1: I must go.  Thanks all and bye|pg||
nt|rodal f: By Ed|pg||
nt|fann4: One shouldn't make meaningless bids, and he didn't. |pg||
nt|haans: Bye Ed|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobh1: W had shown nothing; all he did was respond to 1@d, which players sometimes do on virtual yarboroughs|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: i mean Ks q dim to three or fourand a stiff club for example|pg||
nt|jcwla: A third overtrick in 3NT (not 6@D) on 25 means 1 to Western Province to within 8 with 3 comparisons to come.|pg||
nt|rodal f: I'm might a bit hard, but here have been many funny bids:)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fann4: Though as Ed said, put it down to another Keycard disaster. Could West really expect pard to have zero key cards?|pg||
nt|bobh1: it was meaningless in the sense that it didn't show a SI|pg||
nt|haans: all the more reason for 5@S-6@S-7@S|pg||
nt|fann4: West did not say nothing. he bid 1@S and then 4@D.4@D is not nothing. 4@S is nothing.|pg||
nt|haans: that would have been a bidding to remember|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@d doesn't show a great hand|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes it does|pg||
nt|bobh1: it just shows a few @ds|pg||
nt|fann4: No it doesn't - not in my book anyhow.|pg||
nt|bobh1: so you think it's a slam try?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|newmoon: certainly n/s play 4-card @H|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fann4: You sign off in trumps when not interested in anything.|pg||

nt|fann4: Right Bob, impossible for the Keycarder to have 0 key cards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: time for a biltung break if your teeth are up to it|pg||

nt|rodal f: A puppet would have been good to have for EW now, but they don't use it|pg||
nt|haans: not that easy to bid|pg||
nt|newmoon: tough one to get to tho.   will East start with 2@C or 4NT?|pg||

nt|fann4: It could be a great hand for that series in the American Bridge World ' Whose to blame?'|pg||
