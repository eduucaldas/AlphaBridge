nt|Walddk2: Cold grand slam in clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: as grands go this looks straightforward to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The sharks at MP would bid 7NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: its harder to count tricks in these hand so these two suited grands are pretty hard to get to|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jillm:   roland what is 2s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6+ clubs, 11-15|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Interesting result from the CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like Allerton's 3NT opposite 12-14|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: that should be looking for a second round control though really|pg||
nt|Walddk2: at these colours|pg||
nt|roswolf: does have style|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup linda|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West passed? That's criminal NV v V in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillm:   maybe 3c means something other than what west has|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: so bid 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: unlikely to go 6 off though|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: You can't pass and let the opponents have a free run|pg||
nt|athene: double from north now|pg||
nt|athene: maximum, short clubs|pg||
nt|athene: i would expect|pg||
nt|roswolf: murky auction time|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
mc|8|nt|athene: maybe he wants exactly 44 majors for that, though|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: low part score here for e/w|pg||

nt|justin c: all very restrained|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: now this is pusillanimous of Allerton his pard has doubled twice and he has some shape a bullet and he know spard has single heart at most|pg||
nt|justin c: looked like this might be headed towards 3 or 4 spades doubled|pg||
nt|lestergold: note 4S cold and 3h probably making |pg||
pc|h5|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: @CA would have held it to 8, now an overtrick is in sight|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wilkinsona: yep 3 hearts should be ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3H whetehr or not making very cheap|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@S off on @C ruff |pg||
pc|s2|nt|justin c: (and very dodgy even without it)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: well i dont bklam them for not reacj=hing 4S but they should be playing 3S for sure|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: but it seems unusual to try for a ruff holding AJx of trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: overtrick here depends on finding the Ax club position probably will cos its the natural way to play them|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: Allerto9n had a simple bid of 3S on th eway out|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I actually thought West might have bid 2@S first time round...|pg||

nt|athene: true, that's another points :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: pity diamonds were trumps|pg||
nt|athene: yes, maybe better to make spades trumps for beer purposes|pg||
nt|athene: not just because they are a better fit|pg||
nt|jillm:  wow it looks like this board was stolen at the other table|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed petty larceny|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S  5+ hearts  11-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C would be both majors 8-13 so if he shows spades it's a max|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hate 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: EW playing X as a 1@S overcall and 1NT as a t/o double of hearts, by the look of it|pg||
nt|lml: is 1NT takeout?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to the camp|pg||
nt|athene: i think that's what NS recommend to people|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: int to of h|pg||
nt|lml: okay that makes more sense|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok then i like it:)|pg||
nt|lml: it seems reasonable to me|pg||
nt|athene: Cooke might just bid a boring 2@H or he might get cute|pg||
nt|athene: he must be scared of spades|pg||
nt|athene: partner rarely has even as many as four|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: down the middle|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: flying hack time?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: i think west is just about worth 2@S - passing first time over 2@H in other room was a little bit wet|pg||
nt|lml: I think he bid 4@H with the intent of doubling 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: club lead|pg||
nt|athene: play partner for the @HA, i suppose|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: They can tap this to pieces. I don't think a club lead is good|pg||
nt|athene: yes you are right|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: it looks pretty likely that spades are precisely 4-4-4-1 round the table|pg||
nt|roswolf: -2 if declarer is lucky|pg||
nt|athene: so Garvey can force, hold up ace of trumps and continue the force|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just tap dummy|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: woe thrice woe |pg||
pc|s6|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|s5|pc|c7|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|athene: or not :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: north in scrooge mood|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: north's @S9 is starting to wake up now|pg||
nt|athene: not to mention the fact that he has four trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perfect defence. "When you have trump length, lead your longer side suit". Good rule of thumb|pg||

nt|lestergold: so a double part score swing is likely nad that is expensive|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|xenya: N taking the pressure off|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: am I the only one who passes the east hand?|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|lestergold: game will be bid and go down tody|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: major suit layout spitting at n/s|pg||
nt|vugraph815: 2h was game forcing|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: heart lead may help 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant see 3N making ht lead spade switch curtains|pg||
nt|justin c: win first spade and play a @C|pg||
nt|buffytvs: even on a spade lead in 3NT, dec can win and play on clubs, whle spades are blocked|pg||
nt|justin c: ad idem|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes then defence cant unravel their 5 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: that we be hard to find play|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well how about playing 2Hx?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i think dixon's doubkle was an indisciplined noise|pg||
nt|vugraph815: silverstone thinking|pg||
nt|lestergold: if hearts was a natural buid on his left what on earth was dixon's double meant to tell Silverston?|pg||
nt|lestergold: it would sound take out oriebnted not lead directing|pg||
nt|justin c: i have to go|pg||
nt|justin c: thanks all, and enjoy the rest of the match :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: by Justin|pg||
nt|lestergold: very hard to bid against the Allerton/ hinen system |pg||
nt|lestergold: I think they are all getting confused and wrapped up in each other's artificial bids|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: danger is south thinks norths double take out|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: eggsactly|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: wwhich is why he shouldnt have don e it|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: 3n more chance than 4H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, spade lead....|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: non dim ldead may get lucky now|pg||
nt|lestergold: ion fact a very lucky lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: well maybe a chance or Hinden to shine|pg||
nt|lestergold: for her to shine|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and now the accident perhaps...|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|lestergold: spade switch only chance for defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: if Hinden takes it how does she choose between playing a heart or club?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: this could be a swing because 4h has no play|pg||
nt|lestergold: kill point|pg||
nt|buffytvs: she might duck this, playing for N to have both aces and only 2 spades|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|wilkinsona: well done then|pg||
nt|buffytvs: wd|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: surely not|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@h "are you SURE you haven't got a heart stop? look again"|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe 3NT now, relying on the previous 2@H bid to show the heart stop is tentative|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would bid 3nt now|pg||
nt|lml: why not?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: In that case 2@H was waste of time|pg||

nt|athene: this will be played the other way up|pg||
nt|athene: which might make a difference|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S - 4@H, i predict|pg||
nt|lml: yes the last four boards were good results for small as well|pg||
nt|lml: so this is very close|pg||
nt|roswolf: remember smal has a number of + positions on 17-20|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzaa: says its not a splinter-after earlier|pg||
nt|jillm:  i wonder what east is thinking about|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: For specs who may be wondering how Garvey can bid 4@H. 1@S shows 5+ hearts and 11-15 hcp|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|jillm:  this board might even the match|pg||
nt|lml: it is good for NOrth SOuth to have east on lead|pg||
nt|athene: can declarer hold his losses to one spade and two clubs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: maybe|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|athene: the spade might even go on a club now|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: ok, east is having none of that :)|pg||
nt|jillm:  very nice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can certainly play the trump suit for no loser|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|lml: NOrth needs to use his entries to play trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|Walddk2: But did not|pg||
nt|lml: not deep enough|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: no hard to get that right|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He played too quickly|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: black lead gives declarer that vital extra entry to pick up trumps|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|athene: it had to be a diamond into the @DAJ|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|lml: I was trying to think about what is the safest play in trumps since obviously he has no idea they arent splitting|pg||
nt|roswolf: he might make dd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And now they gave it back. What a rollercoaster hand|pg||
nt|jillm:  east did very well to lead club Ace and shift to spade king|pg||
nt|athene: he has to know which black winner to cash|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: if he tries the @S10, it's no good|pg||
nt|athene: east throws diamond and must come to a trump|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|d2|nt|athene: he had to cash the @CQ |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again he played to quickly|pg||
nt|jillm:  east defended very well|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: then trump finesse, diamond ruff, and bingo|pg||
nt|lml: it is a very challenging hand|pg||

nt|athene: in situations like that you have to go back over the play mentally and remember all the spot cards played by the defence early on|pg||
nt|lml: its one of those you think about after the match and try to figure out what you should have done (not double dummy) but generally|pg||
nt|athene: almost always they give you the key to the distribution|pg||
mb|2S|an|5!s and 4 m|nt|roswolf: light weak 2|pg||
nt|jillm:  by his thinking it seems like north is trying to figure that out now |pg||
nt|Walddk2: So take your time and ask yourself some questions. There is no prize for finishing first|pg||
nt|lml: well he actually does have a heart suit|pg||
nt|lml: it seems normal to me at this vul|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like the pace at this table, but Garvey surely played too fast on 11|pg||
nt|jillm:  and it is very hard to go on to the next board when you do that, very hard to let it go|pg||
nt|athene: playing fast can induce the defenders into hasty innacuracies|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and yourself|pg||
nt|athene: if you think you can speed the whole table up and it will benefit you more, you do it, surely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: which was what happened when he tried to cash @S10 which he should know would not stand up|pg||
nt|jillm:  grant baze was the master of that, and barry crane|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room west tried 3@H which wasnt a success|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is easier to let that board go for Garvey.  He has been having a good session|pg||
nt|athene: Meckstroth too|pg||
nt|lml: he thinks he has enough... he wishes he made it but ...|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|roswolf: east should pass - he must have seen pard's weak 2's before at favorable|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt is a bit weird|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may go down a lot|pg||
nt|lml: very weird|pg||
nt|athene: what makes him think this is going to be a good contract?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lml: West will pull out|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: oops|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would he?|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope northern stubborness|pg||
nt|lml: I guess he had told his story already so you are right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It must be partner's decision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe he has 9 tricks outside hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: w says the sequence gives him an option to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: spade lead now for lots of tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jillm:  this is going to be a push |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: or 5 down|pg||
nt|athene: declarer going all out to take the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The heart suit is dead now|pg||
nt|lml: North has 2 heart tricks now|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think -5 is deserved here|pg||
nt|athene: north doesn't know that his partner has a second heart|pg||
nt|lml: if NOrth wins and plays clubs it could be worse|pg||
nt|jillm:  down more if North takes ace and shifts to club after running spades|pg||
nt|athene: he looks a bit silly if he captures this and east actually started with @HQ10x|pg||
nt|lml: can East really have that and play in notrump?|pg||
nt|roswolf: then he would have bid 4@H|pg||
nt|lml: yeppers|pg||
nt|athene: well, peoplehave been known to play in 3nt with 4-card support for a weak 2|pg||
nt|lml: still when you are looking at down 2 maybe you should just take it|pg||
nt|roswolf: EAST CLEARLY HAS A DOUBLETON|pg||
nt|lml: down 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry to shout|pg||
nt|lml: I like beating non vul undoubled contracts without worrying too much about undertricks|pg||
nt|lml: North has to be very sure after all East can have anything|pg||
nt|athene: as far as the score goes, an extra 50 or two isn't so important, true|pg||
nt|athene: but psychologically, if you take the absolute maximum every time, on defence|pg||
nt|jillm:    east should have more than he does|pg||
nt|athene: it really crushes the opps psychologically|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: -5 here we come|pg||
nt|lml: so its decent to win it and here it pays dividends|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: if you take them three down, not two down, and four down, not three down, ever single time|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lml: sometimes you get 5 down when you were trying to take 1 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Conclusion. N-S make 3NT. They should have bid, vulnerable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cooke's pause worries me|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's @S10 was a nice play|pg||
nt|roswolf: clearly south has his doubts too|pg||
nt|lml: on the positive side declarer is pretty well going at least 2 down no matter what|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe @S9 would have been a better choice as North's return|pg||
nt|athene: but the play in hearts must have some significance|pg||
nt|athene: surely north would hold up his @HA if there was any danger|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: now we find a 6@D322 north doesn't like - a vulnerable one!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: maybe it was too good for a preempt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: he had 2nt available to show 6+@D and limited opened|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has a surprise for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: limited opener|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: like 2@S for clubs earlier|pg||
nt|athene: but he needs a bit more i guess|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: 200 and 8 IMPs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: indeed -2 on the button|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I like 2@H even less|pg||
nt|lml: East West are definitely struggling from time to time in this match|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: so 1NT does not bother me|pg||

nt|jillm:  at the other table they also o'called 1nt but north bid 2d so ew got back to hearts,  garvey made a nice pass here, a good suit and an entry|pg||
nt|athene: big opportunity for Small here|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|lml: yes I think Small is going to win.  Garvey and Cooke have had a very good game at this table|pg||
nt|jillm:  another potential swing|pg||
nt|roswolf: especially on bds 17-20|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S opener was really something|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillm:  yup|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hinden's 4@S is my style|pg||
nt|athene: now NS play 4@C as non-leaping michaels i think so south will be a bit stuck maybe|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: he can double or just bid 4@C anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a great bid by the lady again|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: shows c and h|pg||
nt|jillm:  i think you need a better hand to overcall 4c|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|athene: garve might like his hand facing 5-5 in hearts and clubs :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Cooke put a club among his hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of prime controls|pg||
nt|jillm:  i didn't realize he showed hearts also|pg||
nt|athene: he has room for 4@D as a generic slam try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Non-leaping Michaels, clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but he may feel he is too good|pg||
nt|lml: he has quite a nice hand here|pg||
nt|athene: or you could play 4@D = slam try in @H, and 4@S = slam try in @C |pg||
nt|roswolf: north is odds on to explore and may punt a slam|pg||
nt|athene: lots of room, just a Q of agreements|pg||
nt|jillm:  if his partner is supposed to be 5/5 and he is looking for slam he might bid 6h to set clubs up for pitches|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|roswolf: indeed 5nt pick a slam is possible|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lml: he could easily bid the heart slam |pg||
nt|roswolf: going a scientific route|pg||
nt|jillm:  roland, what was 5d?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have no idea|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though 4@D was natural - or Cooke thought it was|pg||
nt|Walddk2: D support I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: overboard|pg||
nt|lml: this might be hard to beat|pg||
nt|roswolf: could make 5@H with the chinese finesse i suppose|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think you can make 5@H legitimately|pg||
nt|athene: well lead @HJ certainly picks up the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so you have just two diamond losers|pg||
nt|jillm:  i would be very nervous if I were North playing a 4/3 after a preempt by opponent|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jillm:  has to shorten the "long" suit right away|pg||
nt|lml: I think there might have been a shot on a small spade lead but not this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: s says 4d poss a H flag|pg||
nt|athene: maybe pitch a @D from dummy on this trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|athene: just trying to retain control to limit the undertricks if it all goes wrong|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|athene: now surely he won't play east for the @HQ as well?|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|s3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|athene: but even so, it looks as though they had a misunderstanding over 4@D as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: an original push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 17 also played in game next door|pg||
nt|athene: they could have survived if it had gone 4@C - 4@D (slam try in @H) - 4@H (no thanks!) -  pass|pg||

nt|roswolf: west will open this|pg||
nt|jillm:  how would you like to come back to the table with that result?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C 8-11 both majors might be only 44|pg||
nt|athene: 8-13 sorry|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: now the question is whether north can show some mild interest and still stop in 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S the limit|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: i think they play 2@D is any hand with game interest|pg||
nt|roswolf: le punt|pg||
nt|lml: nope|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you have game interest opposite 8-13?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|roswolf: well can e/w cash out|pg||
nt|athene: you might make 4@S facing the right 8-13 :)|pg||
nt|lml: I think Cooke has a high card mixed in with his hand|pg||
nt|athene: "sorry partner, i had some aces and kings mixed in with my cards during the bidding"|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: 3nt shows10-13 and 3c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It doesn't matter if they cash out or not. This is a dead rat|pg||
