pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|s4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli is a terrific improvement imho, altho italian version is a bit complicated due to the ambiguous aspect of 2@c rebid, i.e3. @cs or good hand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|ritong: opening 2M with M+@cs suppresses this ambiguity|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: OR started with 11 so we won't see comparisons for an age|pg||
nt|varange: very traditional, these two. 13-15 instead of 14-16 NT, and Texas instead of SA Texas. I always thought the youngsters had the more modern gadgets :)|pg||
