mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|nt|xenya: note N's 3@S opening here as opposed to the 4@S in the CR. N thought he had some defence and perhaps a 3-level preempt might be enough -- and he was right |pg||

nt|mdgraham: taken for the maximum|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|mdgraham: if East bids 1@S, is 2@H forcing or not.....|pg||

nt|mdgraham: or double....|pg||
mb|r|nt|mdgraham: moot point as to whether to overcall 1@H or to double|pg||
