mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: argument for both but in a way a pass by east is the best decription  of his hand- up to u pard|pg||
mb|2D|nt|granguru: I would have opened weith 1N in E|pg||
nt|haans: easy 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: weak NT is common in Germany|pg||
nt|Gerben42: as are negative free bids |pg||
nt|granguru: could lose 2@H and 2@C|pg||
nt|granguru: oki|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the 4-1 break is somewhat unlucky|pg||
nt|granguru: 28%|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but still >50% play strong NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzzf: yes, E/W play 12-14 NT|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|granguru: @S gives a discar for @C|pg||

nt|haans: but any one that makes it are an idiot|pg||
nt|hawe45:  IÂ´am glaf, that I was late - otherwise I would have had to comment on this "so-called" @S-bid...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: Hi Hans|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Gerben42: well you have 6 of them and its MP|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: Yes and therefore 5@h - or?|pg||
nt|lestergold: at that stage he doesnt know pard may have a penalty double of 4S may only have four hearts with thehearts breaking 5/1 etc etc|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|hawe45:  hi all|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|granguru: an hybrid hand..|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Gerben42: simply 4cM|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: this is a likely flat bopard a row of 3N+1s i would think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: here playing weak nt changes which side plays 1 nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you if its playeed by east it could be a diamond lead and 3n+2 of course|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|d4|nt|lestergold: players playin 15-17 no trumps will open east with N|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|granguru: west should play the surrounding play in @S to make 4 @s tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: and dim lead becames very likely|pg||
nt|lestergold: although many would choose a less dangerous lead at mps|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|granguru: that is @SJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mmmakela: meaning W didn't open 1 nt|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c4|pc|d7|pg||
mc|10|nt|lestergold: North must be fairly senior he has been around for a long time |pg||
nt|lestergold: of course a very famous player|pg||
nt|lestergold: the only thing i do not like about pairs is the wait between hands|pg||
nt|ralfwil: typical for pairs:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: inevitable for logistic reasons|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also discipline by players....|pg||
nt|lestergold: so i thionk Raif you should sing and dance for the specs|pg||
nt|lestergold: ive run out of broadcastable jokes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 30 years ago|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Fore about 40 years I could imagine, but now i prefer a beeer|pg||
nt|lestergold: and i cant sing unless everyone has earplugs|pg||
nt|lestergold: what do you know about the other players Raif|pg||
nt|lestergold: I know nothing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in fact I had a career but 50 years ago...|pg||
nt|lestergold: what sort of career|pg||

nt|haans: lot of 10 use one one :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: but hard to double|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh dear |pg||
nt|vugraphzzf: the player on east dont want to be mentioned by name...|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bidding misunderstanding of majopr proprtions- n/s cold top i would think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easts double comes from another planete|pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: that could have been us RIGHT?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Gerben42: no must be 8 even|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here East should have bid 5 @d!!!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: NS and EW in two groups on two tables|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: well 6 points unpassed hand partner can protecgt on these hands|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: agree Hans W|pg||
nt|Gerben42: true, maybe 3@D was an underbid to start with|pg||
nt|haans: its pairs|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|hawe45:  Yes - but East could have recovered|pg||
nt|lestergold: a planet without a name a bit like east|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and on my screen he is called anonymous... and want also to bee|pg||
nt|hawe45:  CouldÂ´nt we just write the 670|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now @H and @H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West can see, that @H Ace is the only value by East|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: i would nevertheless have bid as west|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|Gerben42: will be good for NS now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Actually it would have been better NOT to play @C Ace|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: good bidding by Fritsche|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|hawe45:  Best bid on first round: 4 @d from EAST|pg||
nt|mmmakela: maybe that shows void|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|Gerben42: still beating all games|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I mean - pd has made an overcall vulnerable - take a LOOK at that EAST-hand,pls.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ace splinters are sometimes good but more often (imo) very bad|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The E/W-speed does not look like a @S-ruff|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|h6|nt|hawe45:  And this board proves, why an overcall - even vulnerable - is NOT six cards to the 7...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - or 8|pg||
nt|mmmakela: partner can't evaluate his assets properly if 4 points can be in the splinter suit or somewhere else|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West values in @D are the same facing a void as facing the bare Ace|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Mike I could imagine a major game as W|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OH - 870...|pg||
nt|lestergold: west should really bid 4D|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|mmmakela: this time yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: asking partner to pick a game|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South has opened 1 @D|pg||
nt|haans: 3@D did not show anything in @D just invite in @H|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But how can you invite with that East hand. I am closer to 6 tnah to part score|pg||
nt|haans: and only invite by E no slam|pg||
nt|dimi: Rehder does not expect this nice layout for him|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This board will bring a lot of 200-scores - both ways|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  Lunch-break?|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D-2@C overcall = Sabine Aukens favorite bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Also with that hand?|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: to make they kill themself|pg||
nt|dimi: was worth a few MP's again Hans :)|pg||

nt|mmmakela: especially if S shows a couple of aces 1st|pg||

mc|10|nt|ralfwil: my keyboard doesn´t spell so well this evening.....|pg||
nt|lestergold: an argument for west to bid 5D as west has no dfence to 4S whatsoever|pg||
nt|lestergold: that would give east a choice of the reds|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps west is more to blame|pg||
nt|lestergold: ie if pard cannot double 4S then west knows its making so hcan afford 300 away|pg||
nt|lestergold: another upside of west bidding is that n/s may get thiongs wong and bid one more! one too many!|pg||
nt|lestergold: w see it all the time|pg||
nt|ralfwil: isn´t 5@h from E the best alternative to save? If not there must be a 4-4 fit in @c|pg||
