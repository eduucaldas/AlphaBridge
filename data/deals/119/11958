nt|rnmalik: common losers no play-W also has a balanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Natural lead but a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@C to come first and then N get good cards by his single @H after Es @H bid|pg||
nt|chick: problem is to pick up the @CJxxx and also ruff a heart |pg||
nt|rodal f: Why didn't E open 4@H?|pg||

nt|schtsch: when you have a fit, bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: By 2 times @H it realy will become a problem |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 5@C kills the slam.  4@H cuebid would have gotten them there|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 6nt is better than 6@h on W. if @h are 4-1 @sA can be on side for 12 tricks|pg||
