nt|vugraphzze: Welcome back everybody to the German Mens Pairs Set 2 in Bad Nauheim.|pg||
nt|cicus: hi everyone|pg||
nt|cicus: a partscore hand, normally ending in 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzze: Klumpp - Bitschene won the first Session. Here playing against the winners from last year who are at the 5th place now after the 1st session.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jtr: Hello people|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome to Bad Nauheim in Germany|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|cicus: yes, I have the feeling this should be a uniform bidding at all tables|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|jtr: wow|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The official name of this tournament is Dr. Heinz von Rotteck Pokal|pg||
nt|jtr: Ambitious|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which in effect is the German Men's Pairs Championship|pg||
nt|Gerben42: hello Roland - this table will follow last year's winners Smirnov & Piekarek|pg||
nt|jtr: But a good contract until the @hs dont break|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to David Greenwood and Gábor Szöts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|jtr: Hello Roland and thanks|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|cicus: trump lead is normaly suggested against this type of bidding|pg||
nt|cicus: this hand is no exception|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cicus: hi all|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jtr: Hello again people|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jtr: Hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|cicus: however, W can later oferrup spades, and lead a trump if he wishes|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|cicus: overruff|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|xenya: mistake by N|pg||
nt|xenya: ?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jtr: He still might manage|pg||
nt|xenya: would be tough if N ducked|pg||
nt|pamela: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzze: welcome Pamela|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, does that help? A switch was needed|pg||
nt|cicus: N plans a crossruff but will be surprised|pg||
nt|marlowepi: received wisdom would indicate a trump lead against this bidding|pg||
nt|cicus: hi David|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Gabor, David & specs|pg||
nt|jtr: from operator:  Klumpp - Bitschene won the first Session. Here playing against the winners from last year who are at the 5th place now after the 1st session.|pg||
nt|cicus: hi Marshall|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|jtr: It helps because South can pitch a @s|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|jtr: The 9 for a @d|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c8|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|cT|pc|dT|pg||

mb|1N|nt|cicus: decent slam here with adverse @D position|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jtr: Errrmmm|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: EW apparently play weak NT and 4-card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: slam?|pg||
nt|cicus: oh sry, @HA also missing |pg||
nt|cicus: minor flaw :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, a small technical matter:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one flaw in minor and one in major:)|pg||
nt|cicus: hehe|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|jtr: Yes, i thought he might respond 1@s|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: best if 1N would promise better values |pg||
pc|s4|nt|jtr: @sJ will be a good play at some stage|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Avram Kreisberger|pg||
nt|jtr: A 1NT overcall is no doubt a M-m hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jtr: But it did add interest to a rather boring hand|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|cicus: @SJ later by W takes 4 spade tricks for EW|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jtr: Now @ds|pg||
nt|april7: @D from S|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d6|nt|april7: W could take and play J of @S!|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|jtr: @sJ gives 4 tricks there but East cannot play a @h as well|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cicus: problem is that E can't lead both majors at the same time|pg||
nt|cicus: oh, late|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: @SJ is known as a surrounding play|pg||
nt|jtr: Stereo commentary:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am pretty sure Kirmse will find it|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|april7: no doubt|pg||
nt|jtr: Safe ground Roland|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cicus: an alert spec say W should have deblocked @HJ and then the @S@H problem would not arise|pg||
nt|jtr: In abstract, would we double or overcall 1NT as North?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|cicus: you are cruel David|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cicus: as E could hold the trick with @H9|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont like the @h stop for 1Nt and the 3@ss for a double|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h5|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
mc|10|nt|marlowepi: even NS can;t make a slam on the hand|pg||
nt|cicus: one must be mentally strong to commentate with you guys|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think  S can make 5 double-dummy |pg||
pg||
qx|o3|st||md|1SAJHK93DJ3CAT8432,ST765HJDK7642CJ96,S942HAQ74DAT985C5,SKQ83HT8652DQCKQ7|sv|e|nt|marlowepi: cashing all the major winners, squeezing S out of his extra minor suit cards and making him come down to just 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|cicus: same suggested by spec, but how is declarer to know?|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes the lead was rather odd|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: that is why i said "double-dummy"|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jtr: North tempted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like Piekarek-Smirnov, last year's winners, will remain at Table 1 throughout the session|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, Martin said that would be the case|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H by E as transfer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: New opponents are Berrnard Ludewig and Martin Rehder|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jtr: 2@h for me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: is this forcing?|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not sure 2@s would be forcing with everyone|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S intended as forcing|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jtr: And i am not just saying that because of the layout|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jtr: South helped|pg||
nt|cicus: not with me|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jtr: Logically there is a case for it being when you have shown the balance of points with the double|pg||
nt|jtr: Anyway, they managed ok|pg||
nt|april7: luckily @C K is on so W will make at least 11 tricks|pg||
nt|jtr: more luckily they are 3-3|pg||
nt|cicus: unless @DJ is led|pg||
nt|cicus: oh , even then|pg||
nt|april7: even then|pg||
nt|cicus: they lack th e@D8|pg||
nt|jtr: The voluntary 3NT bid implies 2 stops in @hs|pg||
nt|jtr: He might well get lucky if East switches to a low @s|pg||
pc|d7|nt|april7: impossible lead anyway!:)|pg||
nt|jtr: So North may well lead something else|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jtr: Wrong to do so with the 9 in dummy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H or 2C oK with me. 1N could work but in all likelihood there will be time to bid it later if it matters|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: XX means probably @D?|pg||
nt|jtr: Because with H10 he would play the 10|pg||
nt|cicus: I'd probably lead @CK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jtr: I thought it meant "bid your major"|pg||
nt|jtr: We play that anyway|pg||
nt|jtr: He would have led more quickly if it had shown @ds|pg||
nt|april7: W has to pray for Kof @C beeing finessable, but he doubts it very much!!!|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|xenya: he has little choice |pg||
pc|dA|pc|s8|pc|c4|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c7|nt|april7: but then 4@S doesn't make either|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: did u mean S ten david?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|april7: W might think endplayaing N with @H?|pg||
nt|xenya: cash spades and take as many club tricks as you can|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|jtr: He may alos think of jumping in the river:)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d6|nt|jtr: Yes With H10xx you would play the ten|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|dT|nt|april7: if N throws another @H he is endplayed in @H, but not now2|pg||
nt|jtr: In case of AJx with declarer|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c5|nt|april7: relief!|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|jtr: Of course without the 8 you might lead low|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right sure, it is just that when you wrote H 10, many could think you meant heart ten|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|xenya: so perhaps throwing another @H would have been a good move|pg||
mc|9|nt|jtr: ah yes|pg||
pg||
qx|o4|st||md|2S2H9762DAT5CK9763,SQJT87HDJ62CAJT82,SK953HKQT8DQ84C54,SA64HAJ543DK973CQ|sv|b|nt|april7: very good score for EW, because most people will play 4 @S!!!|pg||
nt|jtr: But then i would say @h10:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Worth pointing out though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we'll know next time :)|pg||
mb|2S|an|5/5 in !S+?|nt|cicus: making 12 many times :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|an|inv to 4!S|mb|p|nt|cicus: 4@S will be reached in short time here|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|cicus: will it make, however?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|cicus: btw, 3@D as inviting in @Ss is a good treatment|pg||
nt|jtr: Unlikely i would think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cicus: if W plays it after a transfer, some woill lead a @H|pg||
nt|jtr: If this was a Multi, some people double as East|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jtr: Q good choice|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|jtr: Makes sense when leading into a strong hand with nothing in dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|april7: only 7 tricks if defended correctly|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cicus: all roads lead to -1|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like -1 unless EW find a way to help|pg||
nt|jtr: They have little option of going wrong in defence|pg||
nt|cicus: they have a clear picture of the N hand now|pg||
nt|april7: N might have ace of @H, so then nothing can be done|pg||
nt|cicus: decl can't handle those blacksuit distributions|pg||
pc|cA|nt|april7: 91s|pg||
pc|c4|nt|april7: 9 of @S|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|cicus: only relevant case is N with @HK but then E gets endplayed anyway|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|sT|pc|hT|pg||
nt|cicus: E had to keep 2 clubs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|april7: 6 of @C showed doubleton with W|pg||
nt|april7: first trick|pg||
nt|jtr: @h exit best in case West is asleep:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Good chance he will be at this pace|pg||
pc|sK|pc|hJ|pc|c9|pg||

nt|cicus: new opps|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S 1 down, but they should play only 3|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@s can be beaten here|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|2D|an|weak jump|nt|cicus: EW may take a phantom save in 5 red|pg||
nt|xenya: EW migh try 4@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Indeed|pg||
nt|april7: W should be in 4@H then 4@S good defence but bad result prbably|pg||
nt|jtr: Then it is up to South but 4@s would be crazy|pg||
nt|cicus: well if S bids @Hs it won't be asy to lead a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@S red on white??|pg||
nt|jtr: By West anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|jtr: Exactly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You want to lose all your MPs, Avram?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i agree with W's bid|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|nt|xenya: matchpoint double|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: I need to feed my wife soon and Radal Frank will take over|pg||
nt|cicus: I'd be in 4@S already as I'd have bid 3@S in place of 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Welcome radal|pg||

nt|jtr: But what about 4@h?|pg||
nt|jtr: I see 4 losers|pg||
nt|xenya: losing 2 clubs, a diamond and a heart i think|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|s2|nt|cicus: hi Rodal|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|cicus: so it's the dark side of multi - you would bid a direct 4@S over 3@S|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm wondering if N's 2@D was normal at these colours|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||

nt|april7: another 2@D opening!|pg||
nt|cicus: I don't like the bad suit and outside tricks everywhere|pg||
nt|marlowepi: u said "amazing leads"|pg||
nt|jtr: True gabor but still needed to think|pg||
nt|jtr: Could be amazingly bad i suppose:)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jtr: I agree but you cant have the perfect hand always|pg||

nt|cicus: many transfers here|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|rodal f: 2 finesses are 75% and the @S make it a bit less by %|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: 6N is the spot here|pg||
nt|jtr: 5@c 6@d?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|c2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|cicus: disciplined if unsuccessful|pg||
nt|april7: fast claim!!!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: win heart ace and bang D queen down. when not covered, go with zia --rise with ace and lead a low one back. some risk in it, but all i said was that W had a chance, not that he ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should do it|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice point:)|pg||

nt|cicus: maybe none|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cicus: I would never dare to do that (even if it occurred to me) as I could be the only player going down in the game|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d4|nt|rodal f: If Garre made that. Be shure it would have comed in the papers|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably 2S was forcing, though for most europeans and americans it would not be|pg||

mc|9|nt|jtr: Would North cover with Kxxx?|pg||
nt|miuta69: 2@S constructive , not forcing i guess:)|pg||
nt|cicus: why should he anyway with @HK in dummy?|pg||
nt|rodal f: No David, but the line was a bit nice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the risk of going down in cold contract if you play that way is not that great. the bigger danger has to do with the matchpoint factor--you may blow the overtrick. it all depends ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on how you assess your LHO. but still you SHOULD lead the D queen at trick 2, i think, as LHO may cover. you were going to hook eventually anyway|pg||
nt|jtr: Gotta go now people  Enjoy the rest|pg||
nt|cicus: bye David, thx|pg||

mb|d|mb|2D|mb|3D|nt|jtr: Espeically with that lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|jtr: Especially|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: could be also 6 @H|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@h?????|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|rodal f: Waited 4@D from E there|pg||
nt|cicus: modern T/O X|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: normally, any slam should give you a decent score at matchpoints, that hand was an exception to the rule perhpas|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont believe this|pg||
nt|april7: there is something wrong!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: E bid 2@H??|pg||
nt|april7: must be a weak pair!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about the double by S. are they playing forcing club or some other nebulous diamond opening?|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|4D|nt|april7: thats how you win tournaments!:):)|pg||
nt|vugraphzze: there was a misunderstanding with overcalling after unnatural openings|pg||
nt|cicus: once I took part in a tournament wher 2 pair finished below 20 % in 30 boards|pg||
nt|jtr: Early Xmas present for N/S|pg||
nt|cicus: seems like S has taken some weird action|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: on a @H lead perhaps only 5|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: unless 2@D showed reasonable values|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Pair so -1 are OK at EW, but let's see|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: it seems to me that S did an awful lot of bidding on that mediocre hand|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|cicus: and he did not mean it as he hasn't doubled|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But it is often right to act when the opponents have found a fit at the 2-level. I think pass is clear at IMPs|pg||

mb|5H|nt|panja: I wonder why N did not bid 2@D first time...|pg||
nt|april7: @H kills the entry to the @S suit!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kiss of Death is a penalty of minus 200 at matchpoints when the maximum possible contract is at the partscore level|pg||
nt|panja: the first time bid allows South to take a view about further competition....later 2Nt forces issue|pg||

nt|panja: and whatever W chooses to rebid, he cannot get @HKQx across in normal ways of bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzze: the problem is, that the @H situation was still not clear completely|pg||
nt|panja: my sense is, 2@S rebid is a better choice than 3@S...at MP..it certainly makes far more sense to bid 2@S|pg||

mb|2N|nt|april7: Lucky position of the @H suit for making the 4@H contractE should have XX  if its in their system|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one must conclude that 2S shows 5-8 or something, otherwise W couldnt have enough cover cards for game|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT also a OK invit. Must have @S in E|pg||
nt|irwinbo: yes 2 spades should sow 4-6 points six card suit|pg||

nt|rodal f: Ain't 2@S often 0-5 if opener have total max?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: xx   KJT  AJT  AKQTx|pg||
nt|rodal f: E could make it easyer for W by 3@S. Had QJX. Do he need to bid 2NT for a risk?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|april7: Why did E duck, just on general principles?|pg||
nt|pamela: yes not sure why a duck is right though|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: we are not condoning the 2N bid|pg||

nt|marlowepi: but 3S seems questionable if the top range is 6|pg||
nt|rodal f: But for me I always listen my pards 2@S (0-5) PASS|pg||
nt|mmmakela: top range should be 4 or 5 otherwise 1 @S bid|pg||

nt|panja: well..give North 4 Spades..to QJ say..and only 1 @H honour..|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: thus 3S is much more likely to get a minus than to get to a making game, which basically depends on catching W with a stiff club. and it is MPs, not IMPs|pg||
