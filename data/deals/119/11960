mb|3C|mb|p|nt|haans: and if they dont you still have only 12|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In a while, both opponents have at least one good reason to lead a @D|pg||
nt|stc: in fact if you bid 6 without too much cuebids, W may NOT lead the A@d|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: its not a 5 ot 7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would bid 4 @S now|pg||

nt|stc: -3 x is 500...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but nowadays they cannot double for penalty on lower levels, so there is only a very small risk|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|rodal f: May we see 3@C at N? Y|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evening all.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Kadir:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr was privat|pg||
mb|3S|nt|schtsch: east-west are aek-ananijev i presume|pg||
nt|rodal f: In this group ( after 3 matches ) Serbia1 57 - Croatia 51 - Macedonia 45 - Romania 44 - Montenegro 37 - Bulgaria 35. Belive the 2 best go for semifinal. But don't know|pg||
mb|p|nt|schtsch: tough lead for zip|pg||
nt|schtsch: i guess he hates leading form Jxxx|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi Mike:) Nice to see u. As with the specs:)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mdgraham: 8 on top and a guess makes 9.....|pg||
nt|april7: with a 5th @D in dummy, there could have been a slam without a @C lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzy: yes, 2 best from both groups to SF|pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi Frank, Marko, Specs|pg||
nt|vugraphzzy: tomorrow 2x16boards SF, then 2x16boards finals|pg||
nt|vugraphzzy: also, serbia 1 is playing against macedonia in this round|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|schtsch: but he hates his other options even more|pg||
nt|rodal f: Keept away from the @C lead. If that came 12 colde been made|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: And @H to be blocked if S run for it. So 9 are home|pg||

nt|vugraphzzy: trumps and claim. +1|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|rodal f: Wander why S bid as he do. Ain't it a easy 4@S bid at his first bid?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|schtsch: aek-ananijev are the fastest croatian pair so if you stick to this room you might see the whole second half of the other room|pg||
nt|danilo1: good stop|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|h5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: But hitted @D stright.|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: interesting question as to what to play from dummy at trick 1. On the Rule of Eleven East has two cards higher than the 5 |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: therefore West has three higher cards, so the king is the percentage guess (just)|pg||

mb|p|nt|stc: i think that the % play is just start ruffing|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Maybe saves|pg||
nt|haans: ruffing finesse 5 or 6/7 never 4|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Yes - ruffing high the hearts woukd have been easy - and best play|pg||

nt|rodal f: There open rom opened again at this match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which loses only to 9865 in West, and KJ in East|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and West might have led the 8 from that holding|pg||
nt|rodal f: Here I belive NS can come up i some trouble. But only might|pg||
nt|rodal f: 21NS and 6 tricks at 1NT. 19EW and 7 tricks at 1@S as a exsample.|pg||

nt|rodal f: THX Marko:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.balkanbridge.org/en/information.html  for the tournament website|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: a more difficult hand, but in NT wll probably make 9 tricks by W|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: LOL:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|schtsch: ouch|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: this won't be nice for anyone who takes the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT jacoby=@H fit and min 4@H to bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the Roland hand 20-20 NS aretaken at there color @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Those small symbols make some different:)|pg||
nt|april7: @S lead  and @H switch holds it to 8 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|april7: I thought 3@C is a gameforce!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Here they use short color or minimum at 3@C. Not shure|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D relay I belive|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like NS should make six tricks easily enough|pg||
nt|schtsch: club|pg||
nt|april7: is it not so?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rnmalik: bottom line 1@H with singleton @D-3@C rightly passed|pg||
pc|cK|nt|schtsch: yup, now home|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: I might was wrong. Looks like quebids, but out at deep water now for NS|pg||
nt|chick: If J2N, the club bid shows shortness and diamond starts the cuebidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzzy: yes, all cues|pg||
nt|rodal f: And seems it realy would have been a Roland hand by pleacure. Ain't there 10 at EW|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Lucky start for EW etc unlucky for NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however one has gone missing....|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|schtsch: 5@d looks like one off|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: although the @C8 should establish a trump promotion |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|schtsch: but i'm not the morning type either |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzzy: sorry for this :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: nothing would probably harm this contract, still thk trump switch looked logical already long ago|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tweety1: hello all|pg||

nt|haans: 4@C must be que|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@s only with @cA on side|pg||
nt|lestergold: at these colours its only about 3 playing tricks and three ks too good |pg||

nt|lestergold: on the eleventh planmet not yet discovered|pg||
nt|lestergold: however underbididing today will eb rewarded|pg||
nt|haans: @CA lead |pg||
nt|hawe45:  But they cue-bid too mucht to get the lead of @C Ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: well does anyone know what 3s opener means here?|pg||
nt|haans: 9 tricks?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: no preemptive opening - a real fur lining|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: probably 8@ss and 13 Pts :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But how can North bid others than 4 @S to this opening - they MUST play somthing special|pg||
nt|haans: is a big winner this time|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: you have looked in the answer book Constantin:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i cant explain the auction but they have certainly gained a lot of imps 10 or so|pg||

nt|rodal f: Or might better @H|pg||
nt|schtsch: we will se a @c grand now|pg||
nt|schtsch: 100%|pg||
nt|vugraphzzy: in previou board looks like E passed gf|pg||
nt|rodal f: A @D ain't the most agressive lead. I waited @CQ from W, but....|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even 11:)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|tweety1: why there is no score?|pg||
nt|schtsch: these two like grands more than pivo&cevapi together|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will S or N open? Did at S|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|mdgraham: Raptor double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|schtsch: oh, maybe even @h grand without queen of trumps|pg||
nt|chick: I guess playing a jump shift by opener as game force is simply partnership agreement.  I usually play it as game interest.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
nt|rodal f: Unlucky @D honors at N, but a coffe board|pg||
mb|3S|nt|schtsch: zip took the blackwood away from them|pg||
nt|schtsch: but it was in vain|pg||
nt|danilo1: interesting @S slam... best to bid 6@C (if 2@C Drury)|pg||
nt|danilo1: *6@S rather|pg||
mb|p|nt|schtsch: they usually don't use blackwood|pg||
nt|schtsch: 4NT should suggest @c and another|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can 2@C be a capitan bid?|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i assume 2 clubs shows diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzzy: 2@c is three or 4-way bid, but i didn't hear all possibilities|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|chick: 2@D transfer advance to hearts?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mdgraham: dbl=4-card mjaor and 5+card minor |pg||
nt|vugraphzzy: 5nt explained as 'something exotic' |pg||
nt|rodal f: The hand elevator told 12.45HP at S hand: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AKJ63+J10+82+Q754|pg||
nt|danilo1: too much cue-bidding may be contra-productive with such sort of hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|schtsch: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or drury as named at BBO generaly|pg||
mb|5D|nt|rodal f: 5@D from N and sign of by S|pg||

nt|danilo1: so .. avoided @C and @D lead ... well done - lol :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: if we review the bidding, South practically bid 6@S already after 2@C ... so, why not immediatelly then|pg||
nt|rodal f: @D lead is OK. Not enteryes enough at N. Get the @D color up but fined by enteryes|pg||
pc|d5|nt|schtsch: baldish|pg||

nt|rodal f: Ce mai faci Romanian?:) Hoping for a good resault|pg||

nt|schtsch: 2@c puppet to 2@d|pg||
nt|rodal f: No balancing from W by 4-4 in major?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 1@D  3@D = up to 9 HCP, 4 usually 5 diamonds, and no 4 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Some put there brave bids at the right place. NOT many.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Mat we predict -2 at 3@C?|pg||
nt|rodal f: May|pg||
nt|irwinbo: six diamonds probably best hard to get there|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|schtsch: 2@s invitational with 5|pg||
nt|chick: yes, I'm surprised EW never got in a bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree with u. Still a (bad) good quality at the @S|pg||
nt|danilo1: oh ... strange bidding by East for sure ,,, since never bid @D, with 2 Aces, I would jump to 6@D over 4NT ,,, and leave choice to pd |pg||

nt|danilo1: ... but I would anyway open 1@D ... so would not be in this situation|pg||
nt|irwinbo: agree|pg||

nt|rodal f: The opening are OK in my way. BUT if E open ..................etc|pg||
nt|irwinbo: my rule is that 4nt is quantitative here since there is no agreed trump suit|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c8|nt|mdgraham: this will only be a small board. It looks like NS would be down one in 2@S, so East really has to make 3@C - and I don't think he will|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|rodal f: So as they bid now I show 7good til 11 very badHP|pg||
pc|dA|nt|april7: and N might go down on @H lead and @D back, so N should have tried for a 4-4 @S fit|pg||

nt|april7: another easy 4@H making 10 or 11 tricks with a safety play in @H|pg||
nt|irwinbo: yes both north and south have extras|pg||

mb|1S|nt|april7: 1NT by S, E or W might balance and then N will play 3@Dmaking 4 or NS will X EW in a @H contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: maybe a spade lead and heart switch|pg||
nt|schtsch: i know he likes sound openings|pg||
nt|chick: 6@H fine by W with the protected @SK|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hopefully the same bis as the OR. Contract is safe at Ws hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: now  h lead seems|pg||
nt|schtsch: but this way you might never bid six good @d|pg||
nt|schtsch: and you still have 11 count|pg||
nt|schtsch: ugly|pg||
mb|3D|an|ditto|nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney. Some more days to go so download it:) http://www.balkanbridge.org/en/information.html|pg||
nt|rodal f: bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW did not use 2NT this way earlyer|pg||
nt|vugraphzzy: yes, i noticed that too|pg||
nt|chick: I noticed that too, he has many more points this time|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last time it was a invit hand at non vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|schtsch: but 11|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6nt is better than 6@h on W. if @h are 4-1 @sA can be on side for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps it is more of an asking bid than a showing bid|pg||
mb|3H|nt|april7: what kind of bidding is this?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzy: 1@d then 1nt 17-19 bal|pg||
nt|danilo1: which contract North wish to play? ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|schtsch: as it happened|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chick: moot now, they didn't bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzzy: 11 imps for Serbia 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tweety1: W overcalled 1 @s   so Tez led a @s|pg||
nt|schtsch: letting opponents play 3@c when you have vulnerable game|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: The defence is a tempo ahead now, but with the spade lead it got in the other room, it should make|pg||
nt|rodal f: And here tempo are on for 9 now. WD by Tez|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Well. Montenegro was the underdog before the match started: http://www.balkanbridge.org/en/results.html|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No Frank|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The contract is down|pg||
nt|tweety1: -|pg||
nt|rodal f: SR. Tempo for 8|pg||
nt|tweety1: 3 @h  2 @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always is on a heart switch, I think |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: The only hope for W is @hK off side or 4@h on any hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: Oh dear|pg||
nt|april7: and 1NT opening?how many points?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chick: yep, I bet he'll kicking himself right now|pg||
nt|vugraphzzy: kind of :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|rodal f: I went stright for a oother room and found new glasses. Better now|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: that sums it up pretty well....|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hard to predict that E-W would crash their diamond honours|pg||
pc|s8|nt|tweety1: oh mamma|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|schtsch: as expected that 4@s made on 12th was 12imps for serbia|pg||

nt|stc: you may drop it when taking your coffe|pg||
nt|haans: you must show that the J is single|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In fact, @S-lead would have been best for N/S|pg||

nt|lestergold: on  a spade lead decler would play on clubs  another spade and would probably take dim finesse to q for overtrick  discover the good news and then make 12 in practice - ironically|pg||
