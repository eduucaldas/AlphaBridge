mb|p|mb|1H|nt|tweety1: 6 h better|pg||
nt|tweety1: dbl|pg||
nt|lml: no I dont think so.  |pg||
mb|2C|nt|lml: I was thinking about that too and you can maybe handle a bad heart break in spades|pg||
mb|3H|nt|tweety1: how|pg||
nt|tweety1: setting up @cs?|pg||
nt|lml: either contract needs the club finesse|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: We'll start with what looks like a quiet 3NT.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Greetings everyone|pg||
nt|varange: hi|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kiwibridge: welcome to hugh Wichmann|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: if hearts work they both need the club finesse |pg||
nt|lml: but you have extra chances in spades|pg||
nt|tweety1: 3-3 @cs with @c K in...  wha a life:)|pg||
nt|peachy: Good afternoon:)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Jordan, specs, and our vugraph operator Jerry|pg||
nt|jcwla: A couple of unusual suit splits but nothing that should cause any grief.|pg||
nt|varange: Hi Gary|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|varange: we were watching the EW pair last night I think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: or 4-2 maybe if spades break|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes names look familiar|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: anyway 6@S is not a bad contract but it is less than 50%|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: Whoa.|pg||
nt|peachy: they stopped... hmm|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: I think it is what is called a Hamman Slam|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|tweety1: there you go..|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|tweety1: this  can be a breaking point if theey bid slam|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: its try that after the diamond bid the club king is more likely onside but that may be offset a bit by the need for a heart break|pg||
nt|lml: when the opponents bid without many high cards they usually have shape|pg||
nt|jcwla: This contract has the virtue of making in comfort.|pg||
nt|peachy: yes:)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|tweety1: 5 @h asks the trump !q here i guess|pg||
nt|lml: I think Kordov can stop doubling diamonds... hes made his point|pg||
nt|gabsi info: Result after RR1.5 : 1. China 96.5 2. Ind Unsrat 84 3. Ch. Taipei A 81.5 4. Ind Unima 80.5 5. Singapore 77 6. Thailand 66 7/8. Ina ITB & Ch. Taipei B 44.5 8. |pg||

pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|jcwla: Hard to imagine what happened.  Could S have thought for a second the S hand had opened the bidding?|pg||
nt|peachy: that seems like a reasonable explanation|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|jcwla: Absolutely -- 6-4 is not the time to "thread the needle" and worry that it might only make 3.  On a really bad day, it might -- but you can't base your bridge on that.|pg||
