mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: But one never knows -- we shall see.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|an| |mb|p|nt|ritong: anyway, being able to ruff with the single trump meant +140 cold in @ss|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|an| |nt|frankaus: easy 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|an| 11-13 |mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: is it?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Easy to bid, you mean.|pg||
nt|ritong: well, yes, since south has to lead his long suit to beat it, might be considered as easy|pg||
nt|frankaus: will fail on @D lead |pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: well done!|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|tweety1: 6 h better|pg||
nt|tweety1: dbl|pg||
nt|lml: no I dont think so.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I was thinking about that too and you can maybe handle a bad heart break in spades|pg||
nt|westjava: hi every one,hi Jerry (operator)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|tweety1: how|pg||
nt|tweety1: setting up @cs?|pg||
nt|lml: either contract needs the club finesse|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: We'll start with what looks like a quiet 3NT.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Greetings everyone|pg||
nt|varange: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: welcome to hugh Wichmann|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: if hearts work they both need the club finesse |pg||
nt|lml: but you have extra chances in spades|pg||
nt|tweety1: 3-3 @cs with @c K in...  wha a life:)|pg||
nt|peachy: Good afternoon:)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Jordan, specs, and our vugraph operator Jerry|pg||
nt|jcwla: A couple of unusual suit splits but nothing that should cause any grief.|pg||
nt|varange: Hi Gary|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|varange: we were watching the EW pair last night I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: or 4-2 maybe if spades break|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes names look familiar|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: anyway 6@S is not a bad contract but it is less than 50%|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: Whoa.|pg||
nt|peachy: they stopped... hmm|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@D multi,and opps in 3nt|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lml: I think it is what is called a Hamman Slam|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tweety1: there you go..|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tweety1: this  can be a breaking point if theey bid slam|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: its try that after the diamond bid the club king is more likely onside but that may be offset a bit by the need for a heart break|pg||
nt|lml: when the opponents bid without many high cards they usually have shape|pg||
nt|jcwla: This contract has the virtue of making in comfort.|pg||
nt|peachy: yes:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|tweety1: 5 @h asks the trump !q here i guess|pg||
nt|lml: I think Kordov can stop doubling diamonds... hes made his point|pg||
nt|gabsi info: Result after RR1.5 : 1. China 96.5 2. Ind Unsrat 84 3. Ch. Taipei A 81.5 4. Ind Unima 80.5 5. Singapore 77 6. Thailand 66 7/8. Ina ITB & Ch. Taipei B 44.5 8. |pg||
nt|josj: this lead may well prove killing|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|varange: do any of the specs know the players? or the systems they play?|pg||
nt|josj: except that diamonds are blocked...|pg||
nt|westjava: as S has entry in @H|pg||
nt|westjava: halo oom jos:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|peachy: you are good at accentuating the positive Jordan:)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|tweety1: NS deserves the win|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: they did well to get to the slam and they are playing very well|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kiwibridge: they may be on the web site|pg||
pc|dK|nt|josj: selamat siang Oom Liliek|pg||
nt|westjava: selamat siang dari bandung|pg||
pc|d7|nt|varange: I'll have a look|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jcwla: Hard to imagine what happened.  Could S have thought for a second the S hand had opened the bidding?|pg||
nt|peachy: that seems like a reasonable explanation|pg||
nt|jcwla: We just finished the VG of another event in Indonesia.  The bridge was highly exciting and never predictable.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|tweety1: 7|pg||
nt|josj: di kami pagi-pagi :(|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pamela: hi sorry to be late|pg||

nt|josj: juga...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|westjava: @D block!|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s4|nt|gabsi info: China used system bid is precision, and Taipei A used natural modified|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|atharva: no i am also logging off|pg||

nt|jcwla: The number of overtricks has ping-ponged during the play, ending at four.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|westjava: wdp|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pamela: good though my bidding session with Francine gave me enough of those lol|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: i m not a firm believer in " anything goes for a preempt"|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|ritong: i m even persuaded that being super academical, that is avoiding preempts with external tricks is the thing to do|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|frankaus: at these colours is 7 loser 1 too many?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ritong: because, in my very humble opinion, preempts are basically descriptive bids|pg||
nt|ritong: and should not include defensive values|pg||
nt|jcwla: Both white and both red -- both "3" in the Rule of 2-3-4.|pg||
nt|ritong: in order to feed partner with reliable info|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sort of like, I don't have much - but here's where it is.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||

nt|jcwla: The OR is starting with Boards 23 and 24 and will then circle back to 13, getting our comparisons.|pg||
nt|varange: there's even a photo gallery on the site|pg||
nt|varange: thx Adi|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Hi Adi, looks like 4@H had chances there surprised no double|pg||
nt|westjava: danger is our business in bridge:)|pg||
nt|josj: par will be 4m-1 by EW|pg||
mb|3H|an|.|nt|varange: maybe the 3H bid was stronger than expected. would be rather strange though|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Looks like some range of weak NT here.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a weird 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: dbl will be 5-7|pg||
nt|varange: std defense to strong club :)|pg||
nt|varange: "what does the 1S show?"|pg||
nt|josj: but I doubt if par will be reached|pg||
nt|westjava: might be 3@H for NS|pg||
nt|josj: beating par :)|pg||
nt|josj: W has no good bid available to show minors over 3@H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kiwibridge: pretty pointless on that garbage|pg||
nt|varange: "thirteen cards"|pg||
nt|varange: I'm not sure it's allowed though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: banned here I know that|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: could simply be a psyche though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS should now be in severe dire straits|pg||
nt|westjava: some times par=priatna:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: west won't be able to resist bidding|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1S was obviously some 2 suiter excluding @S and now also @D|pg||
nt|varange: yeah|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: And again 3NT the landing spot -- not a friendly lie of the majors.  Let's watch.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: off the hook :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: ...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Jerry|pg||
nt|varange: hi Jerry|pg||
nt|varange: same operator too |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes nice|pg||
nt|ritong: anything goes versus big @c|pg||
pc|cA|nt|peachy: lots of points but not so easy|pg||
nt|peachy: and best lead for the def|pg||

pc|c3|nt|tweety1: uh|pg||

nt|pamela: flying solo here |pg||
pc|c7|nt|kiwibridge: now we break the sequence of board|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|tweety1: N knows that S has some money|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: South has quite a good hand for him|pg||
nt|tweety1: and S knows that N has only long|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we had this one earlier|pg||
nt|josj: but N came to the rescue and par was beaten after all|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lml: he knew he had high cards but aces and kings are nice|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|peachy: should make but no overtricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|westjava: yes,fly too high|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|pamela: wish my P had those cards when I bid like that|pg||
nt|josj: we have seen that before, these days|pg||
nt|westjava: @D cant go any where|pg||
nt|josj: N has only 2 tricks so he knows they will go off |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|josj: and he need not be afraid of a spade contract in EW|pg||
nt|westjava: will u come to GEO CUP on 18 Dec,oom jos?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|peachy: crucial moment|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||

nt|jcwla: This looks Big Club-y.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: this bid prob indicates they play strong vlub|pg||
nt|josj: should be -2|pg||
nt|westjava: 8 tricks by opps!:)|pg||
nt|josj: 2@S does not make either|pg||
nt|josj: W has to find a lead first|pg||
pc|h6|nt|westjava: for excellent minor lead|pg||

pc|h2|nt|peachy: 3C max in context|pg||

nt|lml: he did have a huddle though|pg||

nt|jcwla: The idea on the previous hand when it came down to K-7 of @C's after the previous trick went @C9, T, Q, x -- |pg||
nt|ritong: ah:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pamela: you have to let P know you thought about it but that discipline won out.. is good form lol|pg||
nt|jcwla: if West had both the J and T of @C's, might play either one on previous trick -- BUT if only has T, had to play it.  Therefore odds favor E holding the J, making it right to insert ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: the 7.  Restricted Choice.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|lml: east has to duck the heart lead then a diamond shift and ugly|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: i wonder if N upgraded to 16, or if their strong club starts at 15|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|ritong: you just can t afford to lead something else|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|jcwla: This looks like a possible upgrade, a natural and positive response, a minimum raise, and game -- easy peasy, lemon squeezy.  Even a @D ruff will not hurt here.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ritong: if it was right to lead a top @d, you then have to find another country to play your masterminding bridge|pg||

nt|ritong: for example, east can have three @cs, thus 2@ds|pg||
nt|ritong: then, wipe @ds , throw him in with the @c and wait for the @s K|pg||
