nt|vugraphzze: Welcome back everybody to the German Mens Pairs Set 2 in Bad Nauheim.|pg||
nt|cicus: hi everyone|pg||
nt|cicus: a partscore hand, normally ending in 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzze: Klumpp - Bitschene won the first Session. Here playing against the winners from last year who are at the 5th place now after the 1st session.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jtr: Hello people|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome to Bad Nauheim in Germany|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|cicus: yes, I have the feeling this should be a uniform bidding at all tables|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|jtr: wow|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The official name of this tournament is Dr. Heinz von Rotteck Pokal|pg||
nt|jtr: Ambitious|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which in effect is the German Men's Pairs Championship|pg||
nt|Gerben42: hello Roland - this table will follow last year's winners Smirnov & Piekarek|pg||
nt|jtr: But a good contract until the @hs dont break|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to David Greenwood and Gábor Szöts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|jtr: Hello Roland and thanks|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|cicus: trump lead is normaly suggested against this type of bidding|pg||
nt|cicus: this hand is no exception|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cicus: hi all|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jtr: Hello again people|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jtr: Hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|cicus: however, W can later oferrup spades, and lead a trump if he wishes|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|cicus: overruff|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|xenya: mistake by N|pg||
nt|xenya: ?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jtr: He still might manage|pg||
nt|xenya: would be tough if N ducked|pg||
nt|pamela: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzze: welcome Pamela|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, does that help? A switch was needed|pg||
nt|cicus: N plans a crossruff but will be surprised|pg||
nt|marlowepi: received wisdom would indicate a trump lead against this bidding|pg||
nt|cicus: hi David|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Gabor, David & specs|pg||
nt|jtr: from operator:  Klumpp - Bitschene won the first Session. Here playing against the winners from last year who are at the 5th place now after the 1st session.|pg||
nt|cicus: hi Marshall|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|jtr: It helps because South can pitch a @s|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|jtr: The 9 for a @d|pg||

mb|1N|nt|cicus: decent slam here with adverse @D position|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jtr: Errrmmm|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: EW apparently play weak NT and 4-card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: slam?|pg||
nt|cicus: oh sry, @HA also missing |pg||
nt|cicus: minor flaw :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, a small technical matter:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one flaw in minor and one in major:)|pg||
nt|cicus: hehe|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|jtr: Yes, i thought he might respond 1@s|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: best if 1N would promise better values |pg||
pc|s4|nt|jtr: @sJ will be a good play at some stage|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Avram Kreisberger|pg||
nt|jtr: A 1NT overcall is no doubt a M-m hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jtr: But it did add interest to a rather boring hand|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|cicus: @SJ later by W takes 4 spade tricks for EW|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jtr: Now @ds|pg||
nt|april7: @D from S|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d6|nt|april7: W could take and play J of @S!|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|jtr: @sJ gives 4 tricks there but East cannot play a @h as well|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cicus: problem is that E can't lead both majors at the same time|pg||
nt|cicus: oh, late|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: @SJ is known as a surrounding play|pg||
nt|jtr: Stereo commentary:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am pretty sure Kirmse will find it|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|april7: no doubt|pg||
nt|jtr: Safe ground Roland|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cicus: an alert spec say W should have deblocked @HJ and then the @S@H problem would not arise|pg||
nt|jtr: In abstract, would we double or overcall 1NT as North?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|cicus: you are cruel David|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cicus: as E could hold the trick with @H9|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont like the @h stop for 1Nt and the 3@ss for a double|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h5|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
mc|10|nt|marlowepi: even NS can;t make a slam on the hand|pg||
nt|cicus: one must be mentally strong to commentate with you guys|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think  S can make 5 double-dummy |pg||
pg||
qx|o3|st||md|1S86HQJ4DAJT64CT32,SQT97532HK5D7CQJ8,SA4HT73DKQ85CAK96,SKJHA9862D932C754|sv|e|nt|marlowepi: cashing all the major winners, squeezing S out of his extra minor suit cards and making him come down to just 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|cicus: same suggested by spec, but how is declarer to know?|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes the lead was rather odd|pg||
nt|vugraphzze: o32|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: that is why i said "double-dummy"|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jtr: North tempted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like Piekarek-Smirnov, last year's winners, will remain at Table 1 throughout the session|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, Martin said that would be the case|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H by E as transfer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: New opponents are Berrnard Ludewig and Martin Rehder|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jtr: 2@h for me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: is this forcing?|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not sure 2@s would be forcing with everyone|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S intended as forcing|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jtr: And i am not just saying that because of the layout|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jtr: South helped|pg||
nt|cicus: not with me|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jtr: Logically there is a case for it being when you have shown the balance of points with the double|pg||
nt|jtr: Anyway, they managed ok|pg||
nt|april7: luckily @C K is on so W will make at least 11 tricks|pg||
nt|jtr: more luckily they are 3-3|pg||
nt|cicus: unless @DJ is led|pg||
nt|cicus: oh , even then|pg||
nt|april7: even then|pg||
nt|cicus: they lack th e@D8|pg||
nt|jtr: The voluntary 3NT bid implies 2 stops in @hs|pg||
nt|jtr: He might well get lucky if East switches to a low @s|pg||
pc|d7|nt|april7: impossible lead anyway!:)|pg||
nt|jtr: So North may well lead something else|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jtr: Wrong to do so with the 9 in dummy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H or 2C oK with me. 1N could work but in all likelihood there will be time to bid it later if it matters|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: XX means probably @D?|pg||
nt|jtr: Because with H10 he would play the 10|pg||
nt|cicus: I'd probably lead @CK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jtr: I thought it meant "bid your major"|pg||
nt|jtr: We play that anyway|pg||
nt|jtr: He would have led more quickly if it had shown @ds|pg||
nt|april7: W has to pray for Kof @C beeing finessable, but he doubts it very much!!!|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|xenya: he has little choice |pg||
pc|dA|pc|s8|pc|c4|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c7|nt|april7: but then 4@S doesn't make either|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: did u mean S ten david?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|april7: W might think endplayaing N with @H?|pg||
nt|xenya: cash spades and take as many club tricks as you can|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|jtr: He may alos think of jumping in the river:)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d6|nt|jtr: Yes With H10xx you would play the ten|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|dT|nt|april7: if N throws another @H he is endplayed in @H, but not now2|pg||
nt|jtr: In case of AJx with declarer|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c5|nt|april7: relief!|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|jtr: Of course without the 8 you might lead low|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right sure, it is just that when you wrote H 10, many could think you meant heart ten|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|xenya: so perhaps throwing another @H would have been a good move|pg||
mc|9|nt|jtr: ah yes|pg||
pg||
qx|o4|st||md|2SQJ9H72DKJT9CKQT3,S3HJDQ8542CAJ9874,S8642HKQ94D763C65,SAKT75HAT8653DAC2|sv|b|nt|april7: very good score for EW, because most people will play 4 @S!!!|pg||
nt|jtr: But then i would say @h10:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Worth pointing out though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we'll know next time :)|pg||
mb|2S|an|5/5 in !S+?|nt|cicus: making 12 many times :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|an|inv to 4!S|mb|p|nt|cicus: 4@S will be reached in short time here|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|cicus: will it make, however?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|cicus: btw, 3@D as inviting in @Ss is a good treatment|pg||
nt|jtr: Unlikely i would think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cicus: if W plays it after a transfer, some woill lead a @H|pg||
nt|jtr: If this was a Multi, some people double as East|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jtr: Q good choice|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|jtr: Makes sense when leading into a strong hand with nothing in dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|april7: only 7 tricks if defended correctly|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cicus: all roads lead to -1|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like -1 unless EW find a way to help|pg||
nt|jtr: They have little option of going wrong in defence|pg||
nt|cicus: they have a clear picture of the N hand now|pg||
nt|april7: N might have ace of @H, so then nothing can be done|pg||
nt|cicus: decl can't handle those blacksuit distributions|pg||
pc|cA|nt|april7: 91s|pg||
pc|c4|nt|april7: 9 of @S|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|cicus: only relevant case is N with @HK but then E gets endplayed anyway|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|sT|pc|hT|pg||
nt|cicus: E had to keep 2 clubs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|april7: 6 of @C showed doubleton with W|pg||
nt|april7: first trick|pg||
nt|jtr: @h exit best in case West is asleep:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Good chance he will be at this pace|pg||
pc|sK|pc|hJ|pc|c9|pg||

nt|cicus: new opps|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S 1 down, but they should play only 3|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@s can be beaten here|pg||

nt|hawe45:  hi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|vugraphzze: Hello and welcome to the German Mens Pairs Championship Session 3 in Bad Nauheim.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|an|16+|nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome back to Bad Nauheim for the German Men's Pairs Championship, also known as Dr. Heinz von Rotteck Pokal. 15 rounds of 2 boards remain|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cicus: EW may take a phantom save in 5 red|pg||
nt|xenya: EW migh try 4@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Indeed|pg||
nt|april7: W should be in 4@H then 4@S good defence but bad result prbably|pg||
nt|jtr: Then it is up to South but 4@s would be crazy|pg||
nt|cicus: well if S bids @Hs it won't be asy to lead a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@S red on white??|pg||
nt|jtr: By West anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Your commentators are Ralf Willquist, Sweden, Gábor Szöts, Hungary, Markku M. Mäkelä, Finland, and Mike Graham, England. I am Roland Wald from Denmark|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|jtr: Exactly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You want to lose all your MPs, Avram?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i agree with W's bid|pg||
nt|april7: only 1 down|pg||
nt|jtr: @hKQ especially should deter him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Martin Stoszek|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jtr: Ho hum|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|april7: what do you say now,Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge-verband.de/images/uploads/ftp825/09_11_21_dma.html  for standings after 2 sessions|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: NS are well into the bidding here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: matchpoint double|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: &@@@@@@+"% probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: I need to feed my wife soon and Radal Frank will take over|pg||
nt|cicus: I'd be in 4@S already as I'd have bid 3@S in place of 2@S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jtr: Welcome radal|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I say they are brilliant, I would never have found it at these colours|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ok thanks david|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: hi frank|pg||
nt|jtr: Soon to be 17 and 404 months and one day:)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: But what about 4@h?|pg||
nt|jtr: I see 4 losers|pg||
nt|xenya: losing 2 clubs, a diamond and a heart i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: also EW...|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mmmakela: both reds have dbl finesses on and no entries to take them|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cicus: hi Rodal|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cicus: so it's the dark side of multi - you would bid a direct 4@S over 3@S|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm wondering if N's 2@D was normal at these colours|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H seems rather undisciplined....|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in fact makeable after this lead|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no it's not|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Discard a @d on @cj ruff a @d and finess in @h|pg||
nt|cicus: but a @D ruff will be available and when S cannot ruff in front of dummy the picture will be clear|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cicus: 2@S,  mean|pg||
nt|jtr: No problem with the lead....|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don' think so - if West leads a trump, Norh splits his honours - but of course he may not|pg||
nt|cicus: E can get to dummy twice, by ruffing diamonds|pg||
nt|ralfwil: two entries on W with @d ruffs, enough to finess twice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then West has no way back to hand. The defence can simply play spades to lock declarer in dummy |pg||
nt|mmmakela: oh sry missed the CJ to ditch the dia|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's cold now, yes|pg||
nt|cicus: then makes on a crossruff|pg||
nt|mmmakela: small heart now|pg||
nt|cicus: yes Markku, that's the only lead to cause prblems|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|jtr: Seen some amazing leads today|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rodal f: 13 days more and I'm 17 year 405 moths:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low club lead best|pg||
nt|cicus: it was easy with S showing 6-4|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, surprising not to find that:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you re right - it can be done. Rather double dummy though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe not so far-feteched given South's bidding|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mmmakela: might play south for singl heart honor though|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|april7: J!|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@D not my taste but can pay dividens|pg||

nt|april7: another 2@D opening!|pg||

nt|marlowepi: u said "amazing leads"|pg||
nt|jtr: True gabor but still needed to think|pg||
nt|jtr: Could be amazingly bad i suppose:)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Must be the father, originally from Poland|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cicus: now the spade ace will be ruffed and a high heart played. if taken in hand, you have to ruff with @HA|pg||
nt|cicus: if in dummy, E will score a trump by ruffing before dummy|pg||
nt|april7: might be 109 with E so N will play J of @S|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzze: Yes the father is Tomasz and the son is Thomas:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: perhaps it's beside the point, but do we agree with N bidding the slam directly?|pg||
nt|jtr: I think it was reasonable|pg||
nt|cicus: I don't think it was wild after no @D bid by S|pg||
nt|xenya: he was lucky to find partner without high cards in @Ds?|pg||
nt|april7: I think yes if he gives up 7, because he can't find out much more from S's hand|pg||

nt|ralfwil: but has to exit in @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is the problem here south must discourage hearts encourage clubs his role being to help keep declare out of dummy|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably EW play lebensohl in this situation, otherwise a 3C reply to the double would be very awkward. maybe E is best advised to overbid a bit with 2N or to underbid with pass|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Kiss of Death is a penalty of minus 200 at matchpoints when the maximum possible contract is at the partscore level|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|pamela: a nice 6 Sp...might be a tad safer.. |pg||
nt|irwinbo: would you all open the south hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pamela: puppet over this? |pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes if pd agreed modern style|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|mmmakela: with Jimmy Caine I wouldn't|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would certainly open that hand if playing drury. if not i like pass|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i would with a tolerant partner not al roth or jimmy caine|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|nt|panja: depending on the field..this is a good or an average spot..|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why would you be playing with an intolerant partner to begin with?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at pairs you hate defending after this auction|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mmmakela: well N new his style|pg||
nt|marlowepi: style schmyle, N should bid again|pg||
nt|po-s: what difference would Drury make?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mmmakela: still wet to play 3 @C|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: because if not playing drury i can bid my hand naturally as a passed hand, but if playing drury i cant bid 2C over 1H|pg||
nt|cicus: but you can bid 1@S or 1NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes i could, but i wouldnt want to|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: club sitch maybe not obvious|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|panja: if many are likely to play in the slam, it would be an average- or so....but after this high opening...I guess not many will play in the slam at MPs|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: that would give me a choice between hiding my best suit and hiding BOTH my suits, and at the same time not getting my styrength acrosss|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: not obvious |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|cicus: I would, I'd rather not miss spades which 2@C can if passed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If partner wanted a @h he should have played @d10|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|po-s: there is always Flannery..|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cicus: and Fosbury|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a small danger of that, yes, but there are a LOT of things that the deal could be about, anbd that is just one of them. besides, the auction is not over if pd passes, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially at these colors|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s5|nt|sybarra: spots in clubs with E  sort of yukky |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s4|pc|h9|pc|d7|pg||

nt|panja: will we come to know other table scores?|pg||
nt|pamela: good expression |pg||
nt|vugraphzze: at least they didn't play in @Ss|pg||
nt|jcwla: Le mot juste.|pg||
nt|vugraphzze: Bridge Mate sais it was worth 54%|pg||
nt|panja: oh ok...so significant number bid the slam....it would seem|pg||
nt|xenya: it would have made a difference if N had the @C10|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if it goes P-P-1H-2C-P-P, E is likely to bid as they might be getting stolen from|pg||
mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: sorry i left out a pass after 1H|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3N infran as cards lie for N/S|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @D  (inverted?) |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe they dont play that |pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I would not bank on tem to reopen a misfit vulnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: not obligatory to bid it tho|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But W could see @c10....|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|panja: good defence opportunity here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am so sorry specs and fellow commentators for my internet.Are out in the bush:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: overbiders bget the mps therefore|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panja: backward finesse in @D|pg||
nt|panja: when S wins @SQ, he has to play @DJ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mmmakela: 6 NT/W top spot here|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|april7: I think W's hand is worth 3@S, what do you think???|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of want to bid 2 1/2 @D    .......in between the two raises |pg||
nt|lestergold: in fact 5D also|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mmmakela: H K rates to be onside because no 1 spade overcall|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: 2@S could be bid with a very different and less playing-trick-rich hand.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: (I never can find the 1/2 card)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s3|nt|panja: @DJ now|pg||
nt|panja: else 10 tricks|pg||
nt|april7: he'l play it for sure, is strong enough, but  yau never know|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcwla: It's a different view from the vugraph booth...|pg||
nt|panja: well..a Club shift is understandable, a small Diamond is a little suboptimal..|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|april7: well, N must have 98 of @D but S should try it anyway|pg||
nt|panja: this is not an easy hand to bid....but the crucial feature is working @H honours|pg||
nt|panja: and whatever W chooses to rebid, he cannot get @HKQx across in normal ways of bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzze: the problem is, that the @H situation was still not clear completely|pg||
nt|panja: my sense is, 2@S rebid is a better choice than 3@S...at MP..it certainly makes far more sense to bid 2@S|pg||
nt|pamela: I have to admit I would have gone 4Sp .. but then ..  I would have gone off. .. I see games and slams in every hand..  very scientific|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: hard for N to cash spade ace against 6N (to hold it to 6), but not so hard against 6H|pg||
nt|lestergold: u need to buy the deluxe bidding box shirley it has the half card and it has the re......markeable card|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: if E plays 6C, he would ruff second spade high and then might take a first-round trump finesse against the ten !!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not that it would matter, but you dont see that every day:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any for 1NT opening at W on last?|pg||
nt|rodal f: If 15-17|pg||
nt|rodal f: Puppet on|pg||
nt|irwinbo: certainly if i were 5-4 in the minors|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
mc|11|nt|lestergold: when you are doubled you say re.... pause and then finish it with markeable|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Mike  I will look for it |pg||
nt|lestergold: a good bidding box has bis like spiamonds clearts etc|pg||
nt|lestergold: in otherwords when you need to bid two suits simultaneously|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and two different double cards, one for take-out and one for penalty|pg||
nt|sybarra: the real question on this hand is do you treat the S hand as an inverted raise? (2 @D being the good hand) |pg||
nt|lestergold: well i have a club member who distinguishes orally between the two- double is for takeout and I double is for penalties|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can, as long as a rebid of 3@d shows the lower end of the range|pg||
nt|lestergold: and he deosnt even know he is doing it|pg||
nt|sybarra: Ralf suggests the angle of placing the cards on the table LOL|pg||
nt|lestergold: another says double interrogatively to make it clear that its only a suggestionm because he has extras and doesnt know what to bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am falling off chair re suggestions from specs  |pg||
nt|lestergold: me too Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: you all are tooooooooooo  funnny |pg||
nt|lestergold: can you please send piccy of u falling off chair|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Is a WEB-cam supported on BBO?|pg||
nt|lestergold: u have to be funny commenating on pairs as we spend most of the time waiting for the next deal|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is better than our song and dance routines |pg||

nt|lestergold: i do  a good shirley imitation|pg||

nt|mmmakela: if puppet yes otherwise no|pg||

mb|3N|nt|panja: at unfavourable vule..N did not want to open 2@S...but this could cost...with the opening lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3N intended as minors I guess|pg||

nt|vugraphzze: yes was for the minors|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mmmakela: ok 2H is Kokish|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: and a X from N!!!|pg||
nt|panja: very speculative double...but this will succeed|pg||
nt|april7: such a lucky X, I have never seen before|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting double of 1@s|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: They found 3nt in another way|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|xenya: i've noticed that this sort of double is quite popular there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on a singleton is rather unique|pg||
nt|xenya: but i'm a bit surprised W didn't double for takeout instead of bidding 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have watched the 1 nt rebid promise singleton club more that once|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but cheaper for NS than 3@sX|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|panja: kibs asking about the meaning of dbl...it is more on the lines "lead unusual suit"...|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pamela: many pairs have  agreements that when  opps arrive at 3NT like this a x means lead a spades|pg||
nt|jcwla: might also be "lead worse major" -- from S hand can seemingly only be one thing in any case|pg||

nt|rodal f: Cicus I ment|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcwla: The W hand could rebid 2@C or 2NT.  However, with only two spots below a 7, it does look more like a brick wall than a leaky dike.|pg||
nt|panja: East could have passed 1@S.....just 5 HCP..but with a wide range opening...E is worried about a big hand with W..so has to keep the bidding open|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pamela: more to be gined by bidding if they have a H or cl fit|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like she can manage it, the way the cards lie|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ralfwil: N can now see that @d was the side suit|pg||
pc|dK|nt|panja: the defence might falter though...this is not really easy|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|panja: not enough entried to South hand to enjoy @H...so NS will have to turn their attention to the other red suit|pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe she can't -- it's a complex hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|panja: but only S can begin @D...so N has gone passive with a @S|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: Lucky position of the @H suit for making the 4@H contractE should have XX  if its in their system|pg||

nt|lestergold: 3N |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 4@C?|pg||

pc|s2|pg||

pc|sK|nt|jcwla: Maybe 3@S here on the road to 4@C.  Can only be bidding b/c of now-known big @C fit.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: one must conclude that 2S shows 5-8 or something, otherwise W couldnt have enough cover cards for game|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT also a OK invit. Must have @S in E|pg||
nt|irwinbo: yes 2 spades should sow 4-6 points six card suit|pg||
pc|s9|nt|april7: The @H contract is gone and 5@D will make with deep fineses in @H|pg||
nt|panja: the @S makes this easier than other cases|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|lestergold: it says 5d and 9+ points west jumped to 3D i assume this was constructive|pg||
nt|lestergold: in which case why not 3n|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course a spade lead ducked by nortgh and east has a losing option ofmplaying south for qxx of diamodns|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The only problem is @dQ in 3nt|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mmmakela: W is really max for 2 spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: The end now became....|pg||
nt|lestergold: odds on the basis of the spade length with North|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: i do not agree that E has to have spades to bid 2N, especially at MPs|pg||

nt|marlowepi: xx   KJT  AJT  AKQTx|pg||
nt|rodal f: E could make it easyer for W by 3@S. Had QJX. Do he need to bid 2NT for a risk?|pg||

nt|lestergold: 3N + is ur target|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the problem was that East coild not tell that West had such a prime hand - all aces and the @CJ10|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: 19 vs. 9 HCP...big @S fit...but many missing controls (A/K)...so..most likely, this would be just 4@S|pg||

nt|mdgraham: well, the West hand is very strong|pg||
nt|panja: or just singoff 4@S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: just 2 @H for me|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: that was passive by N |pg||
