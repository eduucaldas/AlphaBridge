mb|p|mb|1H|nt|tweety1: 6 h better|pg||
nt|tweety1: dbl|pg||
nt|lml: no I dont think so.  |pg||
mb|2C|nt|lml: I was thinking about that too and you can maybe handle a bad heart break in spades|pg||
mb|3H|nt|tweety1: how|pg||
nt|tweety1: setting up @cs?|pg||
nt|lml: either contract needs the club finesse|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: We'll start with what looks like a quiet 3NT.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Greetings everyone|pg||
nt|varange: hi|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kiwibridge: welcome to hugh Wichmann|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: if hearts work they both need the club finesse |pg||
nt|lml: but you have extra chances in spades|pg||
nt|tweety1: 3-3 @cs with @c K in...  wha a life:)|pg||
nt|peachy: Good afternoon:)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Jordan, specs, and our vugraph operator Jerry|pg||
nt|jcwla: A couple of unusual suit splits but nothing that should cause any grief.|pg||
nt|varange: Hi Gary|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|varange: we were watching the EW pair last night I think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: or 4-2 maybe if spades break|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes names look familiar|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: anyway 6@S is not a bad contract but it is less than 50%|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: Whoa.|pg||
nt|peachy: they stopped... hmm|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: I think it is what is called a Hamman Slam|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|tweety1: there you go..|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|tweety1: this  can be a breaking point if theey bid slam|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: its try that after the diamond bid the club king is more likely onside but that may be offset a bit by the need for a heart break|pg||
nt|lml: when the opponents bid without many high cards they usually have shape|pg||
nt|jcwla: This contract has the virtue of making in comfort.|pg||
nt|peachy: yes:)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|tweety1: 5 @h asks the trump !q here i guess|pg||
nt|lml: I think Kordov can stop doubling diamonds... hes made his point|pg||
nt|gabsi info: Result after RR1.5 : 1. China 96.5 2. Ind Unsrat 84 3. Ch. Taipei A 81.5 4. Ind Unima 80.5 5. Singapore 77 6. Thailand 66 7/8. Ina ITB & Ch. Taipei B 44.5 8. |pg||
pc|d2|nt|varange: do any of the specs know the players? or the systems they play?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|peachy: you are good at accentuating the positive Jordan:)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|tweety1: NS deserves the win|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: they did well to get to the slam and they are playing very well|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|varange: I'll have a look|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|jcwla: Hard to imagine what happened.  Could S have thought for a second the S hand had opened the bidding?|pg||
nt|peachy: that seems like a reasonable explanation|pg||
nt|jcwla: We just finished the VG of another event in Indonesia.  The bridge was highly exciting and never predictable.|pg||

mb|1S|an| |nt|varange: maybe the 3H bid was stronger than expected. would be rather strange though|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcwla: Looks like some range of weak NT here.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a weird 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: dbl will be 5-7|pg||

nt|varange: yeah|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jcwla: And again 3NT the landing spot -- not a friendly lie of the majors.  Let's watch.|pg||

mb|p|nt|pamela: you have to let P know you thought about it but that discipline won out.. is good form lol|pg||
nt|jcwla: if West had both the J and T of @C's, might play either one on previous trick -- BUT if only has T, had to play it.  Therefore odds favor E holding the J, making it right to insert ...|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: yes making on QX of clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Q9|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: both N's opened 2@D a depressing sight|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, 9 more to UNSRAT on 21 -- ITB failed by 1 in 1NT in the OR and in the silly 2@DX in here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: the last auction is 1@c - 1NT - DBL - Pass - Pass - RDBL - Pass - 2@c - DBL - allpass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: so no transfers interesting|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kiwibridge: ty operator that makes more sense|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gracelin: Precision abandon transfer to allow 2-way Stayman.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: do you think that is an advance Patrick?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|peachy: ok, now I understand:)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: S, asking away, has no clue whatever of pards holding|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: seems like a direct steal from Blue Team Club and it worked for them :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcwla: Well, last one here for this segment.  Big thanks to Roland, Jerry, the organizers, Raija, Gary, and all specs.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: glad I came bye, fun few hands :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Don't worry -- we're +1440 on the last board."   "Push."|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|jcwla: WTP?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we don't know where we're going, we're on the road to nowhere|pg||
nt|peachy: amazing, same contract|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|jcwla: 7NT would have been the coup de grace.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|peachy: well, result on this board will not affect win/loss.  I'm off to bed. |pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks specs for your helpful comments.  Thanks Gary, Jordan and Joto, and our operator|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cheers sleep well|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, the "fix" board at 2@H is being played in 2NT making 3 in the OR, so a push.  22.|pg||
nt|gracelin: not necessary, only the very old fashioned Precisioners still play that way.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcwla: The OR is finished - welcome to all those who have joined us from in there.  I'm sure you'll be shocked to see 7@D pushing.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and I've seen 37 imps in 4 boards including 1 push in that|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|gracelin: It's in the 1960"s Precision.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|sT|nt|jcwla: 5 flattish hands, and 6 hands worth 69 IMPs.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: when you say Precison abandonded it Patrick, who is that?  Is there a body somewhere who defines the system?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|ritong: presumably a bunch of bodies|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I always had transfers and still do|pg||
nt|gracelin: no Gary, just abandon the 2-level transfer bid|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|ritong: bidding theory usually improves via consensus|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|jcwla: Thanks again to all -- more in minutes -- for now, so long.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hT|pg||
mc|7|nt|kiwibridge: you won't find a Kiwi who doesn't play 2 level transfers|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yet thousands claim to play Precision|pg||
nt|gracelin: very few elsewhere, too.|pg||
nt|ritong: you have to do hard work to find that sort of people anywhere|pg||
