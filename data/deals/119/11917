nt|jtr: Now @ds|pg||
nt|april7: @D from S|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|april7: W could take and play J of @S!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jtr: @sJ gives 4 tricks there but East cannot play a @h as well|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|cicus: problem is that E can't lead both majors at the same time|pg||
nt|cicus: oh, late|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: @SJ is known as a surrounding play|pg||
nt|jtr: Stereo commentary:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am pretty sure Kirmse will find it|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c9|nt|april7: no doubt|pg||
nt|jtr: Safe ground Roland|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|cicus: an alert spec say W should have deblocked @HJ and then the @S@H problem would not arise|pg||
nt|jtr: In abstract, would we double or overcall 1NT as North?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|cicus: as E could hold the trick with @H9|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|jtr: I dont like the @h stop for 1Nt and the 3@ss for a double|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h2|nt|xenya: the @H6 discard was unfortunate -- actually E can lead both my majors: on winning the @SK he switches to the @H9|pg||
mc|7|nt|april7: 1NT is imo better than X|pg||
nt|xenya: cross ouit 'my'|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Looks like Piekarek-Smirnov, last year's winners, will remain at Table 1 throughout the session|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, Martin said that would be the case|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H by E as transfer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: New opponents are Berrnard Ludewig and Martin Rehder|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|april7: is this forcing?|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not sure 2@s would be forcing with everyone|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S intended as forcing|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3N|nt|jtr: South helped|pg||
nt|cicus: not with me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Logically there is a case for it being when you have shown the balance of points with the double|pg||
nt|jtr: Anyway, they managed ok|pg||
nt|april7: luckily @C K is on so W will make at least 11 tricks|pg||
nt|jtr: more luckily they are 3-3|pg||
nt|cicus: unless @DJ is led|pg||
nt|cicus: oh , even then|pg||
nt|april7: even then|pg||
nt|cicus: they lack th e@D8|pg||
nt|jtr: The voluntary 3NT bid implies 2 stops in @hs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|april7: impossible lead anyway!:)|pg||
nt|jtr: So North may well lead something else|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|april7: XX means probably @D?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jtr: I thought it meant "bid your major"|pg||
nt|jtr: We play that anyway|pg||
nt|jtr: He would have led more quickly if it had shown @ds|pg||
nt|april7: W has to pray for Kof @C beeing finessable, but he doubts it very much!!!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|xenya: he has little choice |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|april7: but then 4@S doesn't make either|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|april7: W might think endplayaing N with @H?|pg||
nt|xenya: cash spades and take as many club tricks as you can|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|c4|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||

nt|jtr: They have little option of going wrong in defence|pg||

nt|jtr: But it is 100% double dummy|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|cicus: now the spade ace will be ruffed and a high heart played. if taken in hand, you have to ruff with @HA|pg||
nt|cicus: if in dummy, E will score a trump by ruffing before dummy|pg||
nt|april7: might be 109 with E so N will play J of @S|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps it's beside the point, but do we agree with N bidding the slam directly?|pg||
nt|jtr: I think it was reasonable|pg||
nt|cicus: I don't think it was wild after no @D bid by S|pg||
nt|xenya: he was lucky to find partner without high cards in @Ds?|pg||
nt|april7: I think yes if he gives up 7, because he can't find out much more from S's hand|pg||
