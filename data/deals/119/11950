mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|gracelin: Is the Manoppo at other table related to Eddy ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|westjava: Manoppo is a family name,might be yes|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|westjava: 1nt from S (CR) was a big mistake I think|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gracelin: Eddy won't be happy with the 1NT rebid at other table by his namesake (if not his son).|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|westjava: hahaha...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|westjava: he will be very angry|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|westjava: if he know|pg||
nt|gracelin: I know Henky Lasut's son plays bridge, but no idea about Eddy|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps he just pulled out the wrong card...|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, that's more reasnable|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|tweety1: 6 h better|pg||
nt|tweety1: dbl|pg||
nt|lml: no I dont think so.  |pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: I was thinking about that too and you can maybe handle a bad heart break in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: how|pg||
nt|tweety1: setting up @cs?|pg||
nt|lml: either contract needs the club finesse|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: We'll start with what looks like a quiet 3NT.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lml: if hearts work they both need the club finesse |pg||
nt|lml: but you have extra chances in spades|pg||
nt|tweety1: 3-3 @cs with @c K in...  wha a life:)|pg||
nt|peachy: Good afternoon:)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Jordan, specs, and our vugraph operator Jerry|pg||
nt|jcwla: A couple of unusual suit splits but nothing that should cause any grief.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: or 4-2 maybe if spades break|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: anyway 6@S is not a bad contract but it is less than 50%|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: Whoa.|pg||
nt|peachy: they stopped... hmm|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lml: I think it is what is called a Hamman Slam|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tweety1: there you go..|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|tweety1: this  can be a breaking point if theey bid slam|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: its try that after the diamond bid the club king is more likely onside but that may be offset a bit by the need for a heart break|pg||
nt|lml: when the opponents bid without many high cards they usually have shape|pg||
nt|jcwla: This contract has the virtue of making in comfort.|pg||
nt|peachy: yes:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tweety1: 5 @h asks the trump !q here i guess|pg||
nt|lml: I think Kordov can stop doubling diamonds... hes made his point|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|peachy: you are good at accentuating the positive Jordan:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|tweety1: NS deserves the win|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: they did well to get to the slam and they are playing very well|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hard to imagine what happened.  Could S have thought for a second the S hand had opened the bidding?|pg||
nt|peachy: that seems like a reasonable explanation|pg||
nt|jcwla: We just finished the VG of another event in Indonesia.  The bridge was highly exciting and never predictable.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|tweety1: 7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|pamela: hi sorry to be late|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|lml: hi Pamela :)|pg||
nt|pamela: did I miss much :-(|pg||

pc|cT|nt|jcwla: The number of overtricks has ping-ponged during the play, ending at four.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pamela: good though my bidding session with Francine gave me enough of those lol|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|mc|11|pg||

mb|p|nt|westjava: in 70'era,our famous pair is Eddy-Freddy Manoppo|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|xenya: NS have 27 hcp between them, yet 3N went down in the CR  |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: with 17 HCP facing an opening bid, even 3NT is not certain with the NS cards. North needs to be cautious|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed, the cards are not very friendly for them here|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|westjava: henky lasut' pd was Max Agouw... |pg||
nt|gracelin: in fact they have 29 HCP in combined hands|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 29|pg||
nt|xenya: strange auction|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am not sure if they play 4NT as natural here.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Would be wiser if Fallah had found out about Minoris' hand type and point count first, perhaps through an inverted minor raise|pg||
mb|5N|nt|Walddk2: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Roland.  |pg||
nt|xenya: looks like N did mean it as natural|pg||
nt|westjava: good afternoon from Bali,Roland...:)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Roland|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: The old fashioned players will bid a direct 3NT over 1 openibng, showing 16-18 baanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That would normally be 13-15 nowadays|pg||
pc|s9|nt|westjava: you come in the right time to solve this hand Roland...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they don't play inverted raises, I think North should have responded 1@D|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|gracelin: even with this lead and declarer guesses everything, don't see how he can come to 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: This will be a struggle even after the helpful lead|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: If he had guessed @CAx with West, he could have made 11, but never more|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gracelin: even guessed clubs, I can see only 3S + 2H + 3D + 2C for 10, 2H already include a possible end-play.|pg||
nt|westjava: no way to home now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S are very lucky, because 3NT failed in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So this will not cost more than 2 IMPs I think|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|westjava: 3 imps is cheap...|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 i think|pg||
nt|gracelin: the credit sould go to the defenders of 3NT in other table.  It's them saved the hand for their team.|pg||

nt|jcwla: The OR is starting with Boards 23 and 24 and will then circle back to 13, getting our comparisons.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Looks like some range of weak NT here.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: And again 3NT the landing spot -- not a friendly lie of the majors.  Let's watch.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|peachy: lots of points but not so easy|pg||
nt|peachy: and best lead for the def|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tweety1: uh|pg||

nt|pamela: flying solo here |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|tweety1: and S knows that N has only long|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|lml: he knew he had high cards but aces and kings are nice|pg||

nt|westjava: we are waiting for the good bidding...|pg||
nt|gracelin: and already reached in closed room|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|xenya: might not be easy to find the @D fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|westjava: no good...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: especially with that bid...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is a lazy bid. Why the rush?|pg||
nt|westjava: yep:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gracelin: north really loves the 3NT jump, even that pushed him to an uncomfortable 5NT in last deal.|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|pamela: rule of 15 coming up|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|westjava: official web site : http://www.aubc2009.net/|pg||
mb|1D|nt|gracelin: north regrets that it's not his partner opening one of a minor.  Otherwise he has a 3rd chance to bid his favorate 3NT by upgrading his hand to 16 HC. |pg||

nt|lml: he did have a huddle though|pg||
nt|vugraphzys: yes he thought a bit|pg||
nt|jcwla: The idea on the previous hand when it came down to K-7 of @C's after the previous trick went @C9, T, Q, x -- |pg||
mb|p|nt|pamela: you have to let P know you thought about it but that discipline won out.. is good form lol|pg||
nt|jcwla: if West had both the J and T of @C's, might play either one on previous trick -- BUT if only has T, had to play it.  Therefore odds favor E holding the J, making it right to insert ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: the 7.  Restricted Choice.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|lml: east has to duck the heart lead then a diamond shift and ugly|pg||

nt|ritong: east happens to be the dummy, otoh|pg||
nt|lml: oh dear|pg||
nt|lml: that wont be the defense then!|pg||
nt|ritong: prolly not|pg||
nt|lml: its hard not to lead a diamond |pg||
nt|tweety1: can make with a rite @s guess|pg||
nt|lml: but you dont have any entries and they didnt check for majors?|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lml: just about now he knows it was the wrong lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: i wonder if N upgraded to 16, or if their strong club starts at 15|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|ritong: you just can t afford to lead something else|pg||

pc|h2|nt|otoj: they are using natural..|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|otoj: hi all|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jcwla: This looks like a possible upgrade, a natural and positive response, a minimum raise, and game -- easy peasy, lemon squeezy.  Even a @D ruff will not hurt here.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: if it was right to lead a top @d, you then have to find another country to play your masterminding bridge|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: hi Joto:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tweety1: same defence|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|westjava: welcome again to the slam|pg||
mb|2C|nt|xenya: otherwise it's difficult to explain his reluctance to mention his majors|pg||

nt|lml: they exile you if its right and you dont make it|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|peachy: unusually high 2NT HCP limit|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|lml: he will want to keep west out anyway so he will finesse|pg||
nt|tweety1: for sure|pg||
nt|lml: maybe a spade up and then the club play|pg||
nt|pamela: this is a tad scary for him though.|pg||
nt|tweety1: but a @d return after the 2nd @h by W wld set this|pg||
nt|ritong: well, the three good @hs are a tad scary too|pg||
mc|13|nt|lml: nice try by Kordov and I think he still gets to keep his passport|pg||
nt|tweety1: or|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, 9 IMPs are in to ITB on Board 13 - where Manoppo mistakenly stopped in 1NT here making five, ITB played 3NT making four in the OR.|pg||

mb|p|nt|westjava: Unsrat is top ranker of Indonesia Selection for this tourney|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|westjava: official web site : http://www.aubc2009.net/|pg||
nt|gracelin: I understand Indonesia promoted mini-bridge in primary schol and wonder if these junior players started their game with mini-bridge ? |pg||
nt|westjava: no for this team|pg||
nt|westjava: all mini bridge players still in elemtary school now|pg||
nt|gracelin: Don't understand why south took out partner's penalty duble.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|westjava: so di I|pg||
nt|westjava: do|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gracelin: and I would play 2D as forcing. North made a strongest possible action over 1NT and now bid a new suit.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||

nt|xenya: some issues though -- he wouls have done better to play on @Ss at once, without the @H ruff|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|gracelin: but I expect them to stop in 6D.  Seven need a finesse or some good breaks|pg||
nt|westjava: Mario Mambu - Franky Tangkudung are anchor of Indonesian Youth Team |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: 2D is probably a Multi, i.e weak two in either major or a strong balanced hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 2NT rebid shows the strong version|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,the 2nd option it is|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|gracelin: I won't be surprised if south blast into slam after checking Ace.  Is 4C Gerber ?|pg||
nt|westjava: I think so|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|gracelin: if 4C is Gerber then 4D = 0/4 Ace|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6D is safer than 6NT since declarer can ruff a Heart in 6D and pitch the 3rd club on SA|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: 4H mabe asking for King's within the erber framework, then 4NT shows 1|pg||
nt|gracelin: Gerber|pg||
nt|westjava: so,thats all clear|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|nt|xenya: actually 6N is quite safe too |pg||
nt|westjava: the eagle has landed...|pg||
nt|gracelin: south took sme gamble and it works here if he plays carefully|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: a @H lead would establish a 12th trick |pg||
nt|gracelin: since West has Qx clubs I beieve all roads lead to 13 trick and a potential gain for ITB|pg||
nt|westjava: a 13th?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|westjava: draw trump and one way finess for @C|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s5|nt|gracelin: declarer might draw 2-round of trumps then test clubs. When they break 3-2, even the CQ hasn't fallen, declarer can pitch the 3rd one on SA and ruff high the rest for 2 Heart ...|pg||
