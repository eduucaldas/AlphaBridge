nt|peachy: he did, after the H lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|xenya: so a likely 10-imp swing for Syabas Gabrial|pg||
mb|2D|nt|panja: on B21....anyone for a dbl instead of 1@H?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|xenya: i go for 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: @C suit is dead as a result of 1@H overcall..|pg||
nt|peachy: i also like 1H, difficult decisions if partner responds 2C over my Dbl|pg||
nt|xenya: where did E find the 2N bid i wonder|pg||
nt|panja: now..I guess 2Nt, too, will make on a non-@C lead..|pg||

nt|xenya: unless 2@D was forcing of course -- which would have been a bit odd|pg||

nt|xenya: @C switch now -- can S find it?|pg||
nt|panja: @HA and back will be good enough|pg||
nt|panja: @C is still speculative for South|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|motivasi: a possible 3NT hand|pg||

nt|ady: minor suit part score for n/s |pg||
nt|patricck: hearts v spades, who will push who how far?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another quiet pass by W to start with and a highly aggressive 3@S here by E.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcwla: QT-fifth and a min opener opposite a passed partner, vul at imps -- "my grandfather called in chutzpah," as Melanie Griffith said in "Shining Through."|pg||

mb|6S|nt|patricck: wow|pg||

pc|hA|nt|patricck: ruff, diamond to K (north ruffs) and this might make|pg||
nt|patricck: if North doesn't ruff then ruff the other heart and pray for a doubleton K@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Will make with highly favorable (and somewhat unlikely) @S layout.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: might get home if getting diamond position right   |pg||
nt|motivasi: the dangerous hand to attact @S is on W...less he don't have right to do it here|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
