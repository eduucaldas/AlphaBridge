mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Well done, though 12 tricks are makeable with the favourable lie of the cards|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  South will probably double now|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|nigel_k:  3@s by South is not as risky as it looks, as probably neither opponent will have more than three on the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  4@s is a reasonable contract but needs a finesse through the preemptor which fails|pg||

nt|Walddk4: West's name is actually Terje LIE, and he is from Norway originally. I guess LIM sounds more Asian :)|pg||
