pc|h7|nt|bobh1: not sure of their system|pg||
nt|ahri: i have no idea about NS system but my own system would provide exactly the same auction.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|viren169:  I take the principle... if the opps set the suit and we have to make more tricks than them to beat them... it is best to protect whenever possible.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|bobh1: i'm just allergic to passing|pg||
nt|ahri: spec points out that (same as in system i usually play), they play weak NT in favorable, so they have to open 1 of a minor with these kind of hands|pg||
nt|viren169: But I agree it depends on partnership agreement(s) and style |pg||
nt|bobh1: he may make this|pg||

nt|xenya: bur W might elect to bid 2@S now?|pg||

nt|xenya: that's the question|pg||

nt|april7: 3@C or2NT for minors!|pg||

nt|bobh1: when they play multi you have more options|pg||
nt|viren169: The problem with multis is that opps have 2 bites of the cherry|pg||
nt|bobh1: sometimes it takes a while to sort them all out|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Multi is back because of the popularity of 2-suited two-openers|pg||
nt|calabres: rite|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|viren169: The multi was v popular in the 90s here in the UK (and Europe I guess)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|calabres: very popular in Portugal|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

pc|s6|nt|jcwla: We have a very protective Big Brother...I mean, big brother.|pg||
nt|viren169: My guess is that it was not invented by them...|pg||
nt|bobh1: it is only allowed in certain high-level events where the rounds are at least 7 boards|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: only the @SA@HA standing in the way of 6@D here|pg||

nt|tweety1: Actually, If there is no blood, It is a good match they say... Who care:)  Kibz want blood:)|pg||
nt|haans: we are here to see blood :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hard to reach 7 clubs|pg||
nt|tweety1: hah|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: tricky hand for east after the 1nt opener|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully they will find out they are missing 2 aces |pg||
nt|april7: 3@S opening, hard to balance for EW vuln.and its ok anyway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@h is a good grand |pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: to show a spade-diamond two-suiter he might have to transfer to spades first and then he never gets the suit lengths across|pg||
nt|sybarra: can transfer to spades, the bid @D over 2 @S andd3 !N |pg||
nt|tweety1: I thought I am the only Drakula|pg||
nt|haans: 6@C is hard|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: some people can transfer to diamonds then bid spades naturally|pg||
nt|sybarra: *then|pg||
nt|april7: let see whether they reach it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now VERY hard|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: I can do that   and appears to be what he is doing |pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps 3@S is better than 2@S but still looks ugly to me|pg||
nt|tweety1: cant find 7|pg||
mb|d|nt|granguru:  Notice how important is the @DQ|pg||
nt|granguru:  Not easy to see it during the bidding in a nat system|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@D presumably shows enthusiasm for diamonds|pg||
nt|tweety1: I am open any bets|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bet no 6|pg||
nt|haans: some odds for 3nt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: being down|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra: I would also know by my pard's bid whether pard has good @D's or not |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|daman: down 1 on normal defense|pg||
nt|april7: 6 they will reach|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Difficult to value after a checkback 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: my pard and I use the "relay" suit for good @D's but all what the understandings are|pg||
nt|haans: again odds on 3nt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 clubs it will be my bet|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: this could get murky; which suit does 4@C agree?|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D |pg||
nt|daman: now another @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: overcalls have no definite values|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but if W opens 1 @D as I would've then diff story|pg||
nt|haans: as it is not MP bidding clubs seems most logical|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sybarra: the XX is first round control |pg||
nt|athene: we can see it agrees diamonds but east might not be in on the joke :)|pg||
nt|chemical_b: hi Shirley, hi all :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  redouble shows @SA|pg||
nt|april7: XX = ace|pg||
nt|mmmakela: must respect playing strength|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 4nt rkcb doesn't work very well for minor suits|pg||
nt|hagz: Maybe West guess that 3 @s is cuebid?|pg||
nt|athene: you tend to get too high|pg||
nt|mmmakela: i won!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|haans: :(|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: 2 off now|pg||
nt|tweety1: Actually I open 2nt with E's hand  so tell all:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: right - as i suspected east thought 4@C agreed spades|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hagz: WOW|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: these "two suiter" auctions are real deathtraps without a lot of discussion|pg||
nt|granguru:  As said ..a tough hand to bid|pg||
nt|granguru:  to try with your favorite partner|pg||
nt|april7: if E had only 2 @S cards, then S goes down!|pg||
nt|april7: I mean in 7|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@S and 3@H|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|athene: after 3@S, a simple way to play is that 4@D = good for diamonds, 4@C/@H = good for spades|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't really matter how you play as long as you agree SOMETHING|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did 2@H really go 2 down on board 2?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: It's close to impossible|pg||
nt|athene: but cue-bids when it's not clear what trumps are cause so many disasters all the time|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2@H went down on the defensive crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: declarer tried to get pitches on spades so south got a ruff and then an overruff with the @H9 too|pg||
nt|april7: best lead for EW ofcourse, ducking is best and finding J of @C S would succeed, if not ....but now S played himself down 2|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: i think north could have doubled 7@D there personally :)|pg||
nt|athene: imagine if your teammates have a disaster and go -1 in 6@D...it's nice to bring back +500 and 9 imps in|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: another slam... 6@S by West!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Slam on a finsess here - OK when it works|pg||
nt|bobh1: by W its cold|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: hard to get it played by West even if using a strong club|pg||
nt|bobh1: by E cold on a non @d lead|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|viren169: looks like it will be a blind lead...|pg||
mb|p|nt|calabres: they play puppet, so E will play|pg||
nt|viren169: I fancy West to have a try for slam now... |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Scalse tipped towards diamonds because no double of 3@C |pg||
mb|4D!|nt|viren169: 4@D will stop the diamond lead!|pg||
nt|viren169: unless N dbles...|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Unless North doubles... which will stop the slam being bid|pg||
nt|viren169: missed opportunity!|pg||
nt|bobh1: are they using screens?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@D = bal slam try w/four @S's? or just control?|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|bobh1: now S will avoid a @d lead|pg||
nt|bobh1: another chance to double bypassed|pg||
nt|cuttysark: if 4@D was a cue North should surely dbl 5@D|pg||
nt|viren169: more difficult if trumps were 3-1|pg||
nt|jcwla: looks like puppet so the 9-card fit is known to W|pg||
nt|bobh1: mind you N cannot be sure she wants a @d lead|pg||
nt|bobh1: doubling might enable them to bid a slam they would otherwise stay out of|pg||
nt|viren169: not easy|pg||
nt|bobh1: S might lead a @d anyway...his other options are uglier|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree with Liz... dble 5@D (I would have dbled 4@D!)|pg||
nt|viren169: South will be thinking that pd had a opportunity to dble diamonds twice but didnt... so no @D lead!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not tempting to lead from tens and jacks against a slam - and they have not bid it yet...|pg||
nt|bobh1: leading from a J is terrible|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: N has cards in three suits -- double somewhat commital.|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: nooooooooooooooooo|pg||
nt|viren169: Well not dbled by North!|pg||

nt|bobh1: apparently they don't agree on what 4@d is|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: I play that the only slam try when partner has shown a 5-card m is the other major - so for me 4@D is natural. I could partner Oliveira :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bobh1: W thinks it a cue in support of @ss, E thinks its a suit|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@h is a slam try in @ss|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Agree - with 4 hearts and 5 of a minor you want to Stayman, then bid your minor in search of the 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|bobh1: exactly|pg||
nt|jcwla: Right.  W has made a couple of calls that could conceivably be misread.  Do that too often and eventually one will be.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (Which is better than a 3-2 fit)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 5@c rather expensive if defence starts wit 2 rounds of @c|pg||
nt|granguru:  depends on the defense|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: south might just put this one in game - if it's a weak-only Multi, he might go 4@C asking for transfer|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: east might do something first though|pg||
