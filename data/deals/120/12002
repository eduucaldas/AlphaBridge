nt|shevek: 3NT, then 4@s  ?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: thinking...|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shevek: 8 loser hand, not interested|pg||
nt|patricck: so I guess that makes the slam about 68%, less a bit for a possible 5-0 break, so maybe a 64-65% slam|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|patricck: hard to bid of course :) but still a reasonable slam if you can get there :)|pg||
nt|shevek: south couldn't tell partner had a singleton opposite Txx|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|shevek: or maybe a $@c splinter....|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|patricck: So if 2@C was forcing as it is in some methods then a 3@C splinter by North at her 2nd bid might have been the answer|pg||

nt|patricck: 5@S probably only 2 light yes, but a 4th rund of clubs scores a trick for Souths 10@S, although to do that you have to play 3 rounds of clubs before playing any hearts at all.....  ...|pg||
