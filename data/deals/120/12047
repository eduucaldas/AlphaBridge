nt|daman: what would we do with the East hand?   is it worth an invitation?|pg||
nt|april7: starting with a partscore in @C,only 2,or in @H by W making 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: typical agreesive modern auction EW will do well to get to 3NT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: EW stroing club, if I remember correctly |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hassett was in a very strong position after the first stanza, up by 51 IMPs, but they lost all of their advantage against Crouch during the second|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk4: http://www.ebu.co.uk/events/?eventid=12  for standings after 6 rounds of 7|pg||

pc|cT|nt|april7: thats to high!!|pg||
nt|daman: down in 4@H in the CR|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit pass wouldn't have been my first thought as West|pg||

nt|chick: Our vugraph operator today is Brian McGuire.   Hi Brian :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Ed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nice economic bidding|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can be some IMPs to gain in OR at 7NT, but ...|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|lestergold: even a tame Bill might have|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 7 off would be a plus result so ny reicks scrambled will be good|pg||

pc|dT|nt|daman: wow|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Darek|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|garnetts: When you have opps who are known for agressive tactics there is but one answer--return the compliment|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|garnetts: I think West should double 1NT--three hearts notwithstanding--he can bid 2@D over 2@C and get over the value of his hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bridge_one: However West don't have a efficace bid, having only 3@h, and Qxx in @s - i would choose 2@D, but pass is a possible way|pg||

mb|1D|nt|lestergold: why did i say that?|pg||

nt|rodal f: Will they end in a hard 3NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partial in notrump or diamonds for EW|pg||

mb|1S|nt|haans: intermediate jump|pg||

nt|Walddk2: But with all those light openings, I guess they will end up in game|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3N N/S??|pg||
nt|chick: another generic opening bid|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: I assume 3H must be a strong bid here|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/ 4s e/w good save in 5d at these colours|pg||
nt|haans: it will son be bid|pg||
nt|daman: North has a problem?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: west have no option|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland deal anyone see why?|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: spec has worked it out|pg||
nt|lestergold: do some arithmetic|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: holy...|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh my this is incredible|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: well there is a case for psyching 1@H i suppose as west --mind you the last time I did that I got a 5NT rebid!!!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now difficult to find 5@C for N/S|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H can make if they dont find the cluib ruff|pg||
nt|garnetts: East will not lead the A@C |pg||
nt|mdgraham: suddenly I feel very old|pg||
nt|april7: Michaels over weak 2???|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: so they will make it I suppose|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sufficient also the lead @s - neutral @D help opps|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think gold will bang down three rounds of hearts at the speed of light|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like a rather easy 4@s on EW|pg||
nt|daman: standard practice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: why not Avram?|pg||
nt|othered1: south resisted getting his @S into the auction, a good move|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: i was searching for syscard links but didnt find them|pg||
nt|chick: I didn't say geriatric :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: holy guacamole|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: are they so old Chick?|pg||
nt|april7: I am not very familiar with Michaels|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chick: I don't know about the players, but some of us are :)|pg||
nt|haans: no 21-19|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good Lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: By 2 @H tricks........|pg||
pc|d3|nt|garnetts: well when you lead the A@S my choice --you have to work on a defence and the A@C looks right doesn't it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: did i miscount Hans|pg||
nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|haans: i did|pg||
nt|daman: used more on this side of the Atlantic|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at a guess, EW are probably about 35-45 and NS a bit older, but I'm not certain of that |pg||
nt|rodal f: Darek. Du u know what type of system EW and NS play? In front thx:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: http://bridge.gda.pl/puchar/2009/puchar/Puchar09runda1.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: polish @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: both|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E has to decide which suit to develop - @Hs or@Ds first|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: that is years, by the way, not waist measurements|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: N/S 70/50, E/W late 40 s?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|rodal f: So Es hand was a type wich didn't suit there 1@C=16HP+ by his 18HP|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Anything  S now leads will benefit declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A spade isn't|pg||

nt|rodal f: There the boss came:) Hi Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @HK from hand and he has 9 tricks for certain|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: that might not have been best|pg||
nt|daman: this hand should be a push|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: When you open 11 counts and force to game with 12, you are bound to get too high on a regular basis|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: now the kill point|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And it's not as if the breaks are bad|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c7|pc|d9|nt|bridge_one: West over A in @s must play lavinthal with KQxx in the dummy, so np to find the return A in @C and @c|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway it seems there can be some endplay in @C if not 2 @H tricks EW|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|daman: unless West happens to get involved|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: I donot feel north could aford to cash that heart|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 3@H with a 2 suit hand not precise bid, also with passed p|pg||
nt|lestergold: David asked what the matter was|pg||
nt|dburn: cashing @dA and playing a third round of hearts, on theother hand...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: odd that West never bid diamonds|pg||
nt|daman: NS will wend their way to 4@S on this|pg||
nt|daman: pretty straightforward|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3D|nt|lestergold: I think the matter was that west didnt bid 5D to save 320 points|pg||

nt|rodal f: Will NS bid there game and will EW then take the sac?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: East opened 1@H, then 1@S overcall and later 3@D|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would think yes Frank|pg||
nt|lestergold: For you Roland this would be clsoe to slam I suppose|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: http://www.ebu.co.uk/events/?eventid=12  for standings |pg||
nt|chick: weak NT for NS, and a superaccept still applies (9 card fit)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I have been in worse|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: double ot not?  |pg||
nt|lestergold: hard for hasset to compete at these colours|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many use super acceptation with 4 cards - here guess to bid only 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most pairs that play superaccepts have different methods of doing so |pg||
nt|lestergold: havent we all?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: 3C by e/w makeable not laydown tho|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4333 shape|pg||
nt|chick: I used to play weak NTs but people began to find good ways to punish it, so I went back to strong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some use the step2 to the transfer (so 2@S here)  |pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk4: Other scores: Small 46 - 45 Rosen; Hassett 65 - 14 Irens; Dhondy 32 - 35 Hackett|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|an|4 !h weak|nt|mdgraham: I think Ew play that 2@S only promises three trumps |pg||
nt|chick: S wanted to defend spades, I suspect|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wild effort from North imho|pg||
nt|daman: 4 of 6 pairs in the Seniors final yesterday play that dreaded convention|pg||
nt|daman: so do Zia/Hamman|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, 11 tricks then, but thats close to a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I admit an initial 2@H would be takeout--but I like to be able to balance |pg||
nt|cuttysark: this North hand does not look like profitable sacrifice material to me :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: u told me off once for suggesting a slam with two aces missing|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chick: if S bids clubs, N has hearts to run back to|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/w were wisely chicken|pg||

nt|lestergold: well i think we can predict the play Guy so np|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: ok - let try again - apologies all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same contract in Closede|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a big deal anyway, 500/620|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: was south's double clearly support?  Or maybe a "cue-bid" double (a favorite of mine)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon South expected 6/5|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: he will be tempted|pg||
nt|rodal f: One of the 1@C polich variants. 18+ balanced if I remember rigth|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: nice lead by South|pg||
nt|lestergold: admittedly i wasd half asleep|pg||
pc|d9|nt|peachy: i woulda have thought S's Dbl was some responsive type|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I am happy to say I know nobody who plays it|pg||
nt|lestergold: in fact 4S is not even a great contract|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: and he has fallen for the temptation altho that was an error|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double probably general values|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe not on this lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold wasnt having any of this nonsense|pg||
nt|lestergold: he heard the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East have a good hand, the game depending on hight cards in West|pg||
pc|dT|nt|garnetts: There 1NT is 14-16 I suppose?   With this very suitable 14 I would have bid 4@S but I like to be agressive |pg||
nt|lestergold: on this lead a diamond ruff meaning that to make declarer has to take the double heart finmesse|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|april7: right lead against this kind of bidding|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: well, if you do not want the opponents to bid nonsense contracts, you had better make sure you beat them|pg||
nt|dburn: and this opening lead will not have that effect|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is sadly true|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would expect more from East--did West upgrade his 1NT?  (15-17)  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 9 in @D 3th, so can make 4@s|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, the double might cause declarer to do something fanicful in the play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but down if east play finesse at the 9@d|pg||
nt|dburn: since he has to negotiate the diamond suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: the  curse of scotland dropping in three rounds is helpful|pg||

mb|2N|an|game forcing|nt|mdgraham: might be awkward now though|pg||
nt|haans: think 1nt will cost|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: South won't know his @CQxx gives SIX tricks in the suit |pg||
nt|lestergold: I suspect N/S have some kit here|pg||
nt|haans: yes spade lead is not good|pg||
nt|daman: useless is not a word I would use to describe any Ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no double this time|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the worst distribution and force for East after passed hand :) 2Nt seam the best reply|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dburn: perhaps fortunate that @hK is well placed - this was not the right side to play the hand from|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@s will perhaps calm N down|pg||
nt|haans: 6@C played by North spade lead harder to find|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: East can establish 2@s, so np to make 3Nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence cannot establish the diamonds and the KH no time|pg||
nt|lestergold: and declarer has nine tricks without the qH|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I admire South's restraint. He has obviously seen North's opening bids before|pg||
nt|peachy: very nice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if declarer guesses everything, he should not be able to make this|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes and could be more than one down|pg||
nt|lestergold: double hook about 25% Kx onside I think is actually less- because you have 50% for K being write and althou nmorer than 25% for hearts breaking 45/2 there have to be 2 specifically ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: with south this reduces odds to below 25%|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: Can anyone tell me what was wrong with the J@D?  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: was thinking that - odd to lead 4th from J109xx|pg||
nt|haans: @H lead not an option|pg||
nt|april7:  6 @C a very good contract, but doesn't work because of bad break|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If he guesses diamonds he has 1 trick in each side suit and 4 trump?|pg||
nt|othered1: But the decision wasn't made on a prima facie basis -- there was lots of other information|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: yes, 7 tricks|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Depending on @D guess|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the @D play I belive E will go for @CQ to the K. Let's see|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I aways feel it is best to decide which card to play before leading towards dummy - the long thought makes things easy for the defence|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: not textbook for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: well wont lead a singleton might be reluctant to bang an ace down and trump leads against small slams are not usually effective|pg||
nt|lestergold: but who does this calc at the table?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe Towsend felt important to tell pard that lead was from length with entries|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: thk|pg||
nt|garnetts: Was wondering if I had been missing something for years---don't all yell a brain at me |pg||
nt|garnetts: Bet he plays the K@H |pg||
nt|bridge_one: finding Qx in @d at the partner, and A8xx at opps, the lead J lose one time - alternative, finding 8x in @D at the partner |pg||
nt|haans: yes spade it will be |pg||
nt|rodal f: Duck and declerer play for keep S out? Seems as a reasonable play|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: they are playing a strong jump shift by responder, a rarity these days|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure but what other information improved the odds in favour of playing for Kx onside specificlly?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: you were half right|pg||
nt|dburn: well, leading low will cost if declarer has all of AKQ8 with four-card length in one hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: i expect so|pg||
nt|lestergold: more by elimination than anything else|pg||
nt|haans: good slam|pg||
nt|chick: J984 isn't much better to lead from than the other choices though|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep has a lot of chances|pg||
nt|lestergold: see how they have kit to check back on the nature of the no trum opener|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: quite impressed by the bidding whjatever the result|pg||
nt|haans: yes good bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: wow let it thru!!!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Oh well, it's only 50s...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|dburn: leading high could work poorly if partner has the singleton ace, king, queen or eight|pg||

nt|daman: right     they help you more than hinder|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|othered1: may depend on what declarer, who is at the table, thinks the count is at that late point in the hand|pg||

pc|sA|nt|othered1: I'll back making, if he doesn't lose too many trumps too early|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as long as clubs are 3-2, he can handle 3-1 spades  |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 7 diamonds may turn out to be an important card here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: of course they have guaranteed diamond cover thats the point|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may have needed a heart switch there, rather than the club|pg||
nt|chick: hadn't they guaranteed cover in all suits?|pg||
nt|haans: 4@C que no @D que|pg||
nt|haans: sry 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but in the cas o dims east knows that the cover is seond round - whereas in spades cover may be only first round while still holding the ace of dims|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: declarer having a big think now|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are times for leading an unsupported ace against a small slam and times when its ill advisewd|pg||

nt|dburn: duck? what earthly use would that be?|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications|pg||

nt|lestergold: well he has ducked it it seems|pg||

nt|vugraphzat: Tom now in deep thought|pg||
nt|chick: I wish we could have a tape recording of the thoughts :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: he may be best to play a diamond and let declarer struggle on as there are problems with lub losers as well as hearts|pg||
nt|haans: if clubs + hearts want he decl to do?|pg||
nt|lestergold: if townsend plays dim is not declarer without recourse?|pg||
nt|dburn: not exactly|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: A shake of the head and a shrug of the shoulders and more thinking|pg||

mb|1H|nt|bridge_one: correct Brian|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I wondr what 2@c is|pg||
nt|lestergold: michaels ish bid i expect|pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe try 2@S and wriggle hoping to get hit in 3@H |pg||
nt|lestergold: wont gethit in 3 probably will in four|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after Dbl by North (points) East can bid prudent|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: @D  and @S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
nt|garnetts: Still kinda of fun to do some chain jerking as East|pg||
nt|bridge_one: overall if they use weak michael's in overcall|pg||
nt|lestergold: east wont want vul to risk 3H all pass when 4 is making|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 3@h is sufficient to give the hand at West ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we await with tenterhooks to see whose chains get jerked probably us commentators in the end|pg||
nt|garnetts: Try 2@D run to 2@S etch via 2NT build up a momentum|pg||
nt|mdgraham: won't want to give NS a shot at 500 when it is possible that they cannot make game - as here |pg||
nt|bridge_one: knowing @S @C 3@h means closed suit, game depending on hight cards out|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: very long thk|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold/townsend may have heard all this before|pg||
nt|lestergold: long thinks against gold are not winning tactics|pg||
nt|lestergold: he specialises in mind reading|pg||
nt|chick: we'll see who chickens out first :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 4@S may be tough, even if they don't get @H ruff.|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has to ruff a dim and then has toplay a club away from q then left with heart loser at the end|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: oh hes gone for a real chain jerker|pg||
nt|dburn: or perhaps he has just bid his longest suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: sadly not |pg||
nt|garnetts: but it is quite safe --he might even make it |pg||
nt|lestergold: no perhaps about it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H is a tactic bid, waiting ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: For what exactly|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h is an attempt to play in two hearts - there isn't anything tactical about it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this could be passed out and inm the fullness of time Hassett will be more delighted than he may immnediately realise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if west keep same cards without A in @d 2@H is made !|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if West has shown diamonds and spades, he doesn't have much of a problem here, imho - either 2@H is to play or it isn't|pg||
nt|lestergold: for that observation Geogio u get a medal|pg||
nt|daman: East will get involved|pg||
nt|april7: they don't play it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@H to play, ok, but impossible the partner could bid anythink with A in @S and A in @D|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear to what extent this auction is forcing on North|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold's turn to tank|pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose North has to bid now |pg||
nt|mdgraham: if indeed it is forcing at all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Doubt South will go on over 5@C - he will be more afraid of 6@C making|pg||
nt|lestergold: i may have missed something please explain David|pg||
mb|2C|an|11+ PC 5+ !h|nt|bridge_one: so 2@H is a tactical bid, hoping opps bid anything to can rebid 3@h after|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: even if West did have both @sA and @dA, 4@h might still not make if he had a heart void|pg||
nt|garnetts: Double should promise another bid most of the time --unless they bid game in my view|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n meaning i dont know what to bid but i have something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting - why not pass 2NT? |pg||
nt|dburn: 2NT is natural, and Hassett should have passed it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because thik South wouldn't pass 2Nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not as if yuo don't have a good lead...|pg||
nt|othered1: did the double really accomplish anything?|pg||
nt|haans: looks like easy slam|pg||
mb|2D|an|11-13PC max 2!h|nt|april7: 2NT? an unlucky bid though!!!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I dont mind the 2@C George but I would rebid 3@S with the W hand|pg||
nt|daman: I would bail to 3@D if I was West|pg||
nt|rodal f: Coffe time Ed - Mike and Roland:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hard to find @H from E|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: well we didnt predict this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, so ou can defend 3NT instead|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he will pass this|pg||
nt|lestergold: now surelty pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however better to counterplay 3Nt that 2Nt :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: well I'll be ............................|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hornswoggled?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem is: West keep a @h or he is void ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not unreasonable for towsend to think Gold has a heart guard here|pg||
nt|dburn: it doesn't much matter, since East is on lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it got hearts into the picture, I suppose |pg||
nt|othered1: and then partner waits for additional definition at a high leve.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I must say  that 2@c is rather modest in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Good lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: so e/w make 3N and score 500|pg||
nt|haans: irens now in lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no 4@D cue|pg||
nt|daman: I never thought of that      that would work for sure|pg||
nt|daman: this will not be a success|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is not going to be a success!|pg||
nt|april7: enough Ks and Qs but aces are missing!!|pg||
nt|daman: but the auction seems OK for the most part    West is getting what he hoped for (5 @D tricks)|pg||
nt|lestergold: yup|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: but I wouldn't complain about any judgment on the way to the fine 5@C|pg||
nt|othered1: How would EW have played an immediate 3@C by west?|pg||

pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: defenders won't make @DA, tjough|pg||
nt|dburn: not quite - they can't cash that diamond|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|bridge_one: no, 8 tricks only, A in @d impossible to make for defence|pg||

nt|april7: X|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm another possible swing here for Darles|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a very good result in the CR, withthe potential to be another big swing, especially if played by north|pg||

nt|bridge_one: only for love :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: It has been suggested that 2NT might show what he has--but I hate it |pg||
nt|mdgraham: daft to bid, imho - North could be quite strong|pg||
nt|lestergold: at these colours any action kamikaze|pg||
nt|lestergold: left to own devices 4s is surely going down|pg||

pc|c6|nt|mcarroll: On 20, 5@D was -2 so 8 imp swing|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good judgment - players are often reluctant to play 3NT with a 6-card major, but with balanced hands you avoid the dangers of unespected trump losers - ruffs and such|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just for fun. @S 3-2 67,8% and 4-1 28.3%: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||

nt|othered1: They have opened some awful rubbish, at least as regards defensive prospects|pg||
nt|othered1: But I'd double, too.|pg||
nt|othered1: I think 4@S makes on minor squeeze on west, especially with @H lead|pg||

nt|april7: the 8 of @S should be with W instead of the 7!|pg||

nt|lestergold: I mean the sort of routine bid which is normally a try/invite but on next round u show that in this case it was more than that|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: this is a last hand at this segment, next segment will be start at 20.00 CET :), welcome all|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Crouch plays transfers over EVERYTHING|pg||
nt|othered1: @C raise or relay?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: art GF I think|pg||
nt|chick: One of my partners says, hold to 1 loser opposite 3 small in my hand.   Another says, any 2 honors or 4 cards is enough to go on.   Very different ideas about the meanings.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: 3N can make here if West picks the diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: time to overbid here 3n makes|pg||
nt|othered1: is there a specified response structure over 2@S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure Chick|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 3NT makes luckily on any lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: was a spirited struggle this set|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|garnetts: but it might go down on a @D finesse |pg||
nt|mdgraham: after @dQ-K-A, declarer may finesse the 8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 5@D and 5 controls many would choose to play game in this hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in East|pg||
nt|lestergold: vulnerbale its worth a shot not at this colour tho|pg||
nt|garnetts: To be honest I have no idea how to play the diamonds---but leading the j@D is best might get a reaction or a tell |pg||
nt|mcarroll: @Dten lrad would be inspired|pg||
nt|april7: K of @H is the right lead!!!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: lead|pg||

nt|lestergold: now alosing option but it doesnt matter in 2|pg||
nt|garnetts: that K@D seemed pretty qucik so it looks like a singleton--|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but not so easy after the trumph lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And thank you Dzidek - great job|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|garnetts: covering would be a mistake if West had J10xxx|pg||
