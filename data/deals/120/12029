nt|westjava: re hi every one!|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|1D|nt|tweety1: 6 h better|pg||
nt|tweety1: dbl|pg||
nt|lml: no I dont think so.  |pg||
nt|westjava: hi Vlad!|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Liliek|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I was thinking about that too and you can maybe handle a bad heart break in spades|pg||
nt|westjava: hi every one,hi Jerry (operator)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tweety1: how|pg||
nt|tweety1: setting up @cs?|pg||
nt|lml: either contract needs the club finesse|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: We'll start with what looks like a quiet 3NT.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Greetings everyone|pg||
nt|varange: hi|pg||
nt|westjava: seems 3nt for NS|pg||
nt|xenya: nice 3N by S -- not so good if declared by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: welcome to hugh Wichmann|pg||
nt|westjava: wrong hand:)|pg||
nt|westjava: looks like NS play precision|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lml: if hearts work they both need the club finesse |pg||
nt|lml: but you have extra chances in spades|pg||
nt|tweety1: 3-3 @cs with @c K in...  wha a life:)|pg||
nt|peachy: Good afternoon:)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Jordan, specs, and our vugraph operator Jerry|pg||
nt|jcwla: A couple of unusual suit splits but nothing that should cause any grief.|pg||
nt|varange: Hi Gary|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: on the right hand|pg||
mb|3S|nt|varange: we were watching the EW pair last night I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: or 4-2 maybe if spades break|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes names look familiar|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lml: anyway 6@S is not a bad contract but it is less than 50%|pg||
nt|tweety1: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: Whoa.|pg||
nt|peachy: they stopped... hmm|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@D multi,and opps in 3nt|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no Precision player of note would open 2@C with that suit :(|pg||
nt|xenya: i would hate to open a precision 2@C with the S hand -- anything but that!|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@C 11-15 may have 4 major|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: promises a decent suit!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think it is what is called a Hamman Slam|pg||
nt|westjava: hello Gary!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tweety1: there you go..|pg||
nt|westjava: why not Kiwi student here now..?:)|pg||
nt|xenya: good lead, gives a chance to beat it -- E wins and switches to a @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tweety1: this  can be a breaking point if theey bid slam|pg||
nt|xenya: but that's tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: its try that after the diamond bid the club king is more likely onside but that may be offset a bit by the need for a heart break|pg||
nt|lml: when the opponents bid without many high cards they usually have shape|pg||
nt|jcwla: This contract has the virtue of making in comfort.|pg||
nt|peachy: yes:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|tweety1: 5 @h asks the trump !q here i guess|pg||
nt|lml: I think Kordov can stop doubling diamonds... hes made his point|pg||
nt|gabsi info: Result after RR1.5 : 1. China 96.5 2. Ind Unsrat 84 3. Ch. Taipei A 81.5 4. Ind Unima 80.5 5. Singapore 77 6. Thailand 66 7/8. Ina ITB & Ch. Taipei B 44.5 8. |pg||
nt|josj: this lead may well prove killing|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|varange: do any of the specs know the players? or the systems they play?|pg||
nt|josj: except that diamonds are blocked...|pg||
nt|westjava: as S has entry in @H|pg||
nt|westjava: halo oom jos:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|peachy: you are good at accentuating the positive Jordan:)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tweety1: NS deserves the win|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I don't know, our youth are usually there but not this one sadly :(|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: they did well to get to the slam and they are playing very well|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kiwibridge: they may be on the web site|pg||
nt|xenya: so 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|josj: selamat siang Oom Liliek|pg||
nt|westjava: selamat siang dari bandung|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|varange: I'll have a look|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|jcwla: Hard to imagine what happened.  Could S have thought for a second the S hand had opened the bidding?|pg||
nt|peachy: that seems like a reasonable explanation|pg||
nt|jcwla: We just finished the VG of another event in Indonesia.  The bridge was highly exciting and never predictable.|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: needs to take the right finesse|pg||
nt|ritong: needs an inspired non @h lead|pg||

nt|jcwla: The OR is starting with Boards 23 and 24 and will then circle back to 13, getting our comparisons.|pg||
nt|varange: there's even a photo gallery on the site|pg||
nt|varange: thx Adi|pg||
nt|westjava: he has 2 teams now here|pg||
nt|xenya: on a closer look, 3N can't be set even with the defence i mentioned -- S goes up with the @DK, but the suit is blocked|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: his comment: people should get a firm grounding in natural bidding before trying Precision|pg||
nt|westjava: I agree,full|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the only opening for that last had was the catch all 1@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Hi Adi, looks like 4@H had chances there surprised no double|pg||
nt|westjava: danger is our business in bridge:)|pg||
nt|josj: par will be 4m-1 by EW|pg||
mb|1D|nt|varange: maybe the 3H bid was stronger than expected. would be rather strange though|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Looks like some range of weak NT here.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a weird 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: dbl will be 5-7|pg||
nt|varange: std defense to strong club :)|pg||
nt|varange: "what does the 1S show?"|pg||
nt|josj: but I doubt if par will be reached|pg||
nt|westjava: might be 3@H for NS|pg||
nt|josj: beating par :)|pg||
nt|josj: W has no good bid available to show minors over 3@H|pg||
nt|westjava: yup.precision equal to 1@D...|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kiwibridge: pretty pointless on that garbage|pg||
nt|varange: "thirteen cards"|pg||
nt|varange: I'm not sure it's allowed though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: banned here I know that|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: could simply be a psyche though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS should now be in severe dire straits|pg||
nt|westjava: some times par=priatna:)|pg||
nt|xenya: this will buy contract|pg||
mb|2D|nt|varange: west won't be able to resist bidding|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1S was obviously some 2 suiter excluding @S and now also @D|pg||
nt|varange: yeah|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: And again 3NT the landing spot -- not a friendly lie of the majors.  Let's watch.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: off the hook :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: ...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Jerry|pg||
nt|varange: hi Jerry|pg||
nt|varange: same operator too |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes nice|pg||
nt|ritong: anything goes versus big @c|pg||
mb|2N|nt|peachy: lots of points but not so easy|pg||
nt|peachy: and best lead for the def|pg||
nt|josj: he's double par|pg||
nt|westjava: hahaha|pg||
nt|westjava: should be 8 tricks here|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: uh|pg||
nt|atharva: hi!|pg||
nt|pamela: flying solo here |pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: now we break the sequence of board|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: N knows that S has some money|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: South has quite a good hand for him|pg||
nt|tweety1: and S knows that N has only long|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we had this one earlier|pg||
nt|josj: but N came to the rescue and par was beaten after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: the strain may be wrong but the level is right|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|lml: he knew he had high cards but aces and kings are nice|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|peachy: should make but no overtricks|pg||
nt|westjava: for info, http://www.aubc2009.net/|pg||
pc|d3|nt|westjava: yes,fly too high|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pamela: wish my P had those cards when I bid like that|pg||
nt|josj: we have seen that before, these days|pg||
nt|westjava: @D cant go any where|pg||
nt|josj: N has only 2 tricks so he knows they will go off |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|nt|josj: and he need not be afraid of a spade contract in EW|pg||
nt|westjava: will u come to GEO CUP on 18 Dec,oom jos?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|peachy: crucial moment|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c5|pc|hA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jcwla: Should have gone right there, I think.|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: not any more...|pg||
nt|ritong: they paid for the multi, other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|josj: sure, E gets an extra round of free doubling :)|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|ritong: well, the result is ugly, maybe we should be more respectful, but the idea is amusing:)|pg||

nt|josj: over 2@H E cannot possibly X but he has to do something|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c7|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|josj: whatever it is, it is interesting to see how a different approach lead to completely diferent auctions, it hapens quite often|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|josj: S has to give access to dummy or give up a trump trick so 2@S is never in danger|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ritong: well, regarding multi 2@d, i ve never been a huge fan, but i might have to play it in the future|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|d5|nt|ritong: and, anyways, it is very interesting with strong three suiters|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

pc|d8|pc|h7|pg||

nt|westjava: next...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: HI jOTO|pg||
nt|otoj: Hi Liliek, Vlad & Gary|pg||
nt|westjava: how about 4@H EW now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pamela: when you are in 3 you have to make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: again part score hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pamela: rule of 15 coming up|pg||
nt|lml: I pass on the east hand myself|pg||
nt|lml: I like spades in fourth|pg||
nt|pamela: passssss|pg||
nt|lml: or at least an ace or two|pg||
nt|jcwla: This looks Big Club-y.|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: this bid prob indicates they play strong vlub|pg||
nt|josj: should be -2|pg||
nt|westjava: 8 tricks by opps!:)|pg||
nt|josj: 2@S does not make either|pg||
nt|josj: W has to find a lead first|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it works I suppose|pg||
nt|xenya: decent, but somehow 5@C looks better|pg||
nt|otoj: 5@C also has a play with @d on side..|pg||
mb|r|nt|westjava: for excellent minor lead|pg||
nt|josj: either minor will do but a @H will not|pg||
nt|westjava: ohh,major...|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 3C max in context|pg||
nt|peachy: not sure I would have done it...|pg||
nt|jcwla: I wouldn't.  3 of my HCP in my suit.|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, thats the reason|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@S by S is brave but questionable in my opinion|pg||
mb|2H|nt|josj: now 8 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: agrreed|pg||
nt|westjava: you are in vul!|pg||
nt|xenya: the @HKJx doesn't look too good and they are vulnerable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@H would have been better|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: support raise|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcwla: If N does get ideas now, will be rewarded.|pg||
nt|peachy: he is going|pg||
nt|westjava: yup:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|otoj: what's the EW system? |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: what?|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|peachy: even 4-1 diamonds no obstacle|pg||
pc|s3|nt|westjava: 4@S,@C accepted|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: just swap the @HQ to the W hand -- and where will you be in 3@S X?|pg||
nt|westjava: not sure,Joto|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this can make|pg||
nt|westjava: to the hell,Vlad...|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|ritong: amazing|pg||
nt|otoj: will make.. no guessing position.. you need only to play to @dK..|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|josj: not at all|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|josj: there was a breakdown so they are entering the old stuff once again|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we had a ha;f hour break H these may be the catch up bpards|pg||
nt|ritong: you wouldn t mention @hs at any stage as well, jos?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|westjava: what will be will be...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: looks reasonable to play a small @H to Q -- like this|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s7|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c9|nt|westjava: end of defence|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: now he can be sure that the @DA is with N -- so quite safe|pg||
nt|otoj: if club is 3-1.. probably double finesse in @h is another possibility..|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|westjava: thats all|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c3|nt|jcwla: next|pg||

nt|ritong: so, italians play that 2@c rebid is either @cs or any good hand|pg||
nt|ritong: i find that difficult to handle|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: yes that's because you are not Italian, Henri :)|pg||
mb|2D|an|.|mb|d|nt|ritong: therefore, i cancel this ambiguity opening 2M with M and @cs and medium hand|pg||
nt|josj: weak with both M, 2@D|pg||
mb|2S|nt|josj: but 2@S is a safe spot for them|pg||
nt|ritong: which implies either giving up on weak 2 or adopt multi|pg||

nt|lml: he did have a huddle though|pg||
nt|vugraphzys: yes he thought a bit|pg||
nt|jcwla: The idea on the previous hand when it came down to K-7 of @C's after the previous trick went @C9, T, Q, x -- |pg||
nt|ritong: ah:)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@S EW anyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|pamela: you have to let P know you thought about it but that discipline won out.. is good form lol|pg||
nt|jcwla: if West had both the J and T of @C's, might play either one on previous trick -- BUT if only has T, had to play it.  Therefore odds favor E holding the J, making it right to insert ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: the 7.  Restricted Choice.|pg||
nt|otoj: if slam is bid.. south will be squeezed in @C and @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|otoj: it seems EW is using prec..|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: both are we believe|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: east has to duck the heart lead then a diamond shift and ugly|pg||
nt|lml: that is my double dummy defense|pg||
nt|lml: lets see what happens in real life|pg||

nt|lml: its hard not to lead a diamond |pg||
nt|tweety1: can make with a rite @s guess|pg||
nt|lml: but you dont have any entries and they didnt check for majors?|pg||
nt|tweety1: agree linda|pg||
nt|pamela: south will be using the esp  .. heart heart heart|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|josj: I never mention hearts, Henri :)|pg||
nt|westjava: x?|pg||
nt|josj: close to 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|westjava: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: its too tempting I guess|pg||
nt|tweety1: appearance seduced:)|pg||
nt|ritong: heh|pg||
nt|xenya: my bet is on 4@S -- or 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: business calculation now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: just about now he knows it was the wrong lead|pg||
nt|josj: makes no sense as someone else always bids @S then|pg||
nt|ritong: they are not eatable, right?:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Jerry our operator hasn't had time to tell us what happened|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kiwibridge: a Prec asking bid of 2@S far superior to 2N byW|pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: i wonder if N upgraded to 16, or if their strong club starts at 15|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mind you E has a negative anyway so here we are seeing amateur Prec|pg||
nt|westjava: he mark up his power|pg||
nt|otoj: W will not stop I guess|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: you just can t afford to lead something else|pg||
nt|westjava: why W didnt bid 3nt?|pg||
nt|josj: no @H stopper :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kiwibridge: "you can always show more but you can never show less"  Kiwibridge|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|otoj: they are using natural..|pg||
nt|westjava: and 8 hcp only|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h3|nt|otoj: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: you can't "mark up" your power it's silly to lie in a Precise auction|pg||
nt|westjava: struggle your life,East!|pg||
nt|otoj: I've no idea.. the reason to accept the invitation..|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcwla: This looks like a possible upgrade, a natural and positive response, a minimum raise, and game -- easy peasy, lemon squeezy.  Even a @D ruff will not hurt here.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 100% blame to E if this fails|pg||
nt|otoj: I do hope the play as "good" as the bidding :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ritong: if it was right to lead a top @d, you then have to find another country to play your masterminding bridge|pg||
pc|cK|nt|peachy: hi Joto:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tweety1: same defence|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: this is still going down I guess|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|lml: I wonder if he really had to attack spades right away|pg||

nt|otoj: declarer need to duck club for squeeze or double finesse in @H..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can count S's hand fairly well|pg||
nt|westjava: need a squieezer,like you,Joto|pg||
nt|xenya: can he, Gary -- how?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: are students up to rectifying the count?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|tweety1: h lead wld be exciting|pg||

nt|lml: they exile you if its right and you dont make it|pg||
nt|ritong: i d say that, yes  north was more or less forced to bid 3 NT|pg||
nt|ritong: he can even have something like @s Qxx|pg||
nt|varange: Jerry's been doing a great job under trying circumstances|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|westjava: not this time!|pg||
nt|josj: it surely was INTENDED for penalties, Liliek :)|pg||

nt|josj: sometimes they are...chicken hearts etc. :)|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, right|pg||
nt|josj: but chicken players' hearts I would not eat...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now OR gone their turn :(|pg||
nt|varange: they had a half-hour connection break earlier, and are now inputting the scores that were lost|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: BUT now OR off the air|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|peachy: unusually high 2NT HCP limit|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|lml: he will want to keep west out anyway so he will finesse|pg||
nt|tweety1: for sure|pg||
nt|lml: maybe a spade up and then the club play|pg||
nt|pamela: this is a tad scary for him though.|pg||
nt|tweety1: but a @d return after the 2nd @h by W wld set this|pg||
nt|ritong: well, the three good @hs are a tad scary too|pg||
nt|gabsi info: Result after RR 1.3 : Ind UNIMA 55.5, China 51.5, Taipei A 50.5, Ind Unsrat 48.5, Ind ITB 41, Thailand 39, Singapore 37, Taipei B 29|pg||

nt|lml: he doesnt really want to open up diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: I think he will get it right what do you guys think|pg||
nt|tweety1: i bet yes|pg||
nt|lml: the card play has been very good|pg||
nt|pamela: he has no choice really|pg||
nt|ritong: he certainly has a choice|pg||
nt|ritong: for example, east can have three @cs, thus 2@ds|pg||
nt|ritong: then, wipe @ds , throw him in with the @c and wait for the @s K|pg||
nt|lml: but if he had that he could afford to play a club from the dummy|pg||
nt|tweety1: and endplay E?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|westjava: I dont like 4@H bid by N,seems a lazy bid,sry|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lml: he might as well play the top diamonds and the club finesse|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lml: interesting position if he doesnt cash the diamond|pg||
nt|lml: its an interesting endplay|pg||
nt|lml: lets say he hooks the club and leaves the diamond king in dummy ... east will be endplayed into giving him a trick|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s4|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cT|nt|westjava: yes,13 imps already come|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pamela: I am with you Linda.. he needs to not  put all eggs in one basket|pg||

pc|c8|nt|westjava: from 3nt-2 other room|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pamela: he could have left himself wide open |pg||

mb|p|nt|jcwla: South sort of endplayed into X -- and obviously N has a little something to get off chest.|pg||

nt|ritong: same auction, but other side  how curious, said oscar the owl|pg||
nt|josj: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: should be a coffee hand indeed|pg||
nt|otoj: bye Liliek|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: this is quite remarkable indeed, I think I have never seen it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kiwibridge: unbelievable|pg||
nt|peachy: i dont undersand...|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gracelin: 3NT by south is not a sure thing yet.|pg||
nt|gracelin: especially after a D lead, which is possible|pg||
nt|ritong: west considering the @d lead|pg||
nt|varange: both hands are flat as a pancake :(|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hard not to make 4 I think|pg||
nt|josj: a club lead would have been much better for the def.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: no entry for E|pg||
nt|josj: exact copy cats...|pg||
nt|otoj: yes should make 4.. with @c is 3-3..|pg||
nt|josj: end of the clubs...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|westjava: no double no trouble|pg||
pc|hT|nt|josj: boring, Liliek? :)|pg||
nt|westjava: again and again and again and...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gracelin: yes, though no entry for East to run D, declarer has only 8 tricks and needs to end play WEst for the 9th|pg||
nt|josj:  19 was a big swing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3N was bid on 20 for 13 imps to China|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c8|nt|kiwibridge: and a bad lead to boot, S happier now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gracelin: after the spade lead, declarer is of course home|pg||
nt|westjava: ...and I am hungry|pg||
nt|josj: S opened 3NT instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|josj: selamat makan|pg||
nt|westjava: ty, after this round:)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|josj: @D finesse and claim|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unlucky, trumps were 6-1 pard :(|pg||
nt|ritong: claiming the rest|pg||
nt|josj: 3 imps to Ch. Taipei...|pg||
mc|11|nt|josj: +16 = 19-11 VP|pg||

nt|westjava: last...|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting result grom OR|pg||
nt|xenya: *from3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: entertaining match and a surprising number of flat boards|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kiwibridge: 15 "unlucky" imps, here now is a solid grand lol|pg||
nt|ritong: yup|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: China finally on the board with a couple of 1imp pickups|pg||
nt|ritong: 100%|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|jcwla: To quote Aretha Franklin in "Freeway of Love," "Don't know what you're doin', but you must be living right."|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes making on QX of clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like more imps for China may be coming|pg||
nt|ritong: now the board where our friend jitang found it amusing to blast 3NT on @s xx|pg||
mb|2S|nt|peachy: Q9|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: both N's opened 2@D a depressing sight|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, 9 more to UNSRAT on 21 -- ITB failed by 1 in 1NT in the OR and in the silly 2@DX in here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: the last auction is 1@c - 1NT - DBL - Pass - Pass - RDBL - Pass - 2@c - DBL - allpass|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: the last of the most of boring session...ty every body|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@D I belive is forcing Stayman not a transfer|pg||
nt|josj: now they won't any more...|pg||
nt|josj: after the overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: so no transfers interesting|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kiwibridge: ty operator that makes more sense|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W forgets the system|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Precision abandon transfer to allow 2-way Stayman.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: do you think that is an advance Patrick?|pg||
nt|ritong: headed for 5@c|pg||
mb|3H|nt|peachy: ok, now I understand:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|otoj: yes a forcing stayman|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- and W shows 2-3-4-4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh excellent|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|westjava: cu all on the next round at 33 mnt from now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: S, asking away, has no clue whatever of pards holding|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: seems like a direct steal from Blue Team Club and it worked for them :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Well, last one here for this segment.  Big thanks to Roland, Jerry, the organizers, Raija, Gary, and all specs.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: glad I came bye, fun few hands :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Don't worry -- we're +1440 on the last board."   "Push."|pg||
mb|p|nt|otoj: probably I will lead @CQ/J instead of a @S..|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcwla: WTP?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we don't know where we're going, we're on the road to nowhere|pg||
nt|peachy: amazing, same contract|pg||
nt|ritong: all this is quite normal and will gain 3 imps|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcwla: 7NT would have been the coup de grace.|pg||
nt|josj: so Ch. Taipei wins 20-10 VP to maybe go to the top|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: well, result on this board will not affect win/loss.  I'm off to bed. |pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks specs for your helpful comments.  Thanks Gary, Jordan and Joto, and our operator|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cheers sleep well|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, the "fix" board at 2@H is being played in 2NT making 3 in the OR, so a push.  22.|pg||
nt|gracelin: not necessary, only the very old fashioned Precisioners still play that way.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jcwla: The OR is finished - welcome to all those who have joined us from in there.  I'm sure you'll be shocked to see 7@D pushing.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and I've seen 37 imps in 4 boards including 1 push in that|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|gracelin: It's in the 1960"s Precision.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 flattish hands, and 6 hands worth 69 IMPs.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|kiwibridge: when you say Precison abandonded it Patrick, who is that?  Is there a body somewhere who defines the system?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
nt|josj: UNSRAT can pass them if they get 23 or more|pg||
mc|10|nt|ritong: presumably a bunch of bodies|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: for board 15, director decision ave|pg||
nt|vugraphzbe: in this table|pg||
