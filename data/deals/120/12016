nt|santyclz: A low @c by declarer at trick 2 might have worked better.  The need to switch might not have been as obvious.  That's the play I would make only to find the stiff K and have them ...|pg||

nt|vugraphzau: 2@h: denies a K and a Q, or an A|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe that, i was really guessing|pg||
nt|syl: :)))|pg||
nt|syl: i said the same|pg||
nt|rodal f: So the weakest bid to give was 2@H:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Interesting (and why I don't consider playing "double-negative").  I've gotten 5 answers to what a double-negative is and no 2 of them agree.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last round come up now. At board 45 we are finned|pg||
nt|vugraphzau: now a short break to let them check the entries|pg||
nt|syl: nano points or ZZZpoints|pg||
nt|syl: at most 2 of them|pg||
nt|xenya: have to leave now -- thanks everyone|pg||
nt|santyclz: Double-negative is:  0-3 hcp; no a or k; 0-5 hcp; 0-7 hcp; 0-5 hcp no 5 card suit.  |pg||
