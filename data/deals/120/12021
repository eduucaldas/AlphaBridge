nt|lestergold: 4d woulod have helped maybe Coyle as a little ashamed of his 2 over 1 response but he was a passed hand and i do agree he could have afforded the cue|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, 4@D may be taken as a high-card control, rather than a singleton, perhaps|pg||

nt|lestergold: this is rtaher unlucky|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I see no crime in NOT opening this West-hand - born in Â´45|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wrong-sided it.|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer cannot get rid of those dims on the clubs cos he has no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|haans: no needed @SA|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Simpson has wisely taken a cautious view- on another day his partner will be sitting with 5H but insufficient points for a 2 level response|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not blame de booton here she is entitltled to upgrade her 11 count with AQ Cl sitting over the north bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: lead damaging spade q wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Would you also hide the @H-suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: I do not think so|pg||
nt|eggy: The polarity is reversed on this hand, so Coyle actually has the West hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: depends on what the range is in 1nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: does seem odd not to rebid 2@H, but West must have a Cunning Plan|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Steve - you operating?|pg||
nt|eggy: no - just next to Jacek|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not see the downside in showing the hearts- partner cant raise hearts without 4 and with a weakish hand will in most cases revert toi spades in any case unless he has someting ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: like stiff spade and three heartrs in which case you may prefer to play in hearts in any case certainly no disaster|pg||

pc|c3|nt|lestergold: howeevr cards fairly favourable here for decl;arer|pg||
nt|eggy: The spade position, coupled with teh DA should mean that the ruff won't help though, in practice|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Why?|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|bobh1: W had 5 lousy @s and very good @ds so i don't think 3n was wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he wanted to know if partner had three spades, he could have asked. He did not, so East must pass 3NT|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|bobh1: the problem with jump shift rebids by opener is you jam your own auction|pg||
nt|bobh1: W had to guess whether his @ds or his @s were more relevant|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well that does happen, it is true. but the converse problem is festering in 2C with 3 games cold|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did he have to guess? He made a unilateral decision|pg||
nt|jallerton: true, but the 2@c chosen in the other room could easily have become the final contract from E's point of view|pg||
nt|bobh1: E might have suspected he had that problem and covered him by bidding 4@ss|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3@d would have suggested doubt about his @d stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT told partner that he wanted to play that contract whether East had three spades or not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is not negotiable in my view|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@d suggest doubt about strain, doubt over @d stopper is only one possibility|pg||
