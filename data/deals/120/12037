mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: t/o dble?|pg||
mb|1C!|an|STR ART F|nt|vugraphzan: looks like a chance for Poland here perhaps|pg||
nt|mcphee: ugly|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: marginal, especially opposite passed hand|pg||
nt|fifee: This is quite an impressive closed room :)|pg||
mb|2C|an|8-10, 5+ !Cs|mb|p|nt|mcphee: well partner being a passed hand makes us act with more aggression|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=421&pid=250  for a summary of the E-W system|pg||
nt|mcphee: now due for a plus score|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|sybarra2: how many @h's from N?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Based on the name, I'm guessing Polish @c rather than precision.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: 3 @H the "good hand" |pg||
nt|kareno: Just a raise I guess.  He hasn't got substantial extras.|pg||
nt|fifee: he showed a positive response with 2@C so no need to jump. they are in gf|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jstokes: also based on the 1@S bid|pg||
nt|mcphee: 1c lead a big winner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now is a lead problem|pg||
nt|sybarra2: as passed hand? |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: well done|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: robinson: "i have the perfect hand for you"|pg||
nt|mcphee: nice lead for a maximum score|pg||
nt|fabsayc: safer than usual as west is not strong|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: and boyd clears his throat...|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: NS surprisingly passive in this room |pg||
nt|xenya: can it be made?|pg||
nt|roswolf: INDEED WITH THE BOSS SUIT AS WELL|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: if declarer will go 1 off we'll have a tie in the overall match. exciting!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: well they got there  |pg||
nt|kareno: Their club is 16+ I think, not a HUGE 1@c :)|pg||
nt|fifee: I think 1@C is artificial and forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra2: as long as you have the agreements/understanding |pg||
pc|dA|nt|Vugraphu2: n-s standard carding|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|fifee: 16 plus 9 is bingo these days with a fit|pg||

pc|s3|nt|vugraphzan: E asking N about leads and N respond by "standart"|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||

nt|fabsayc: hi guys|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair & Ozdil had a discussion about how they'd bid if Lair had asked about things, so I guess they hadn't discussed much after Drury and Lair made the practical bid|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Martin|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2N!|an|jokingly alerted as 20-22 :)|nt|fabsayc: now this board may get interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Some players virtually never open 2@C on a 2-suiter.  Guess they *might* make an exception for this|pg||
mb|5C|nt|othered1: Auctions like this are why|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: indeed hard to get to 5 of a major now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but does oz pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: granted his minor kings are not worth much, but three trumps and heart queen|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Lair wrote a note to Robinson but I can't read it - probably just style|pg||

nt|mcphee: hi anddrew|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, those long suits count for something extra :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Another forcing club!|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: East will be feeling a bit miffed by the DQ's failure to be onside|pg||
mb|1C!|an|STR ART F|nt|xenya: but perhaps they were not bidding to make -- unfortunately we don't have the auction|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I know it's irrational to get upset by the location of the cards, but it's hard to avoid|pg||
nt|mcphee: well he stole a trick with a @S|pg||
nt|mcphee: here come the @H|pg||
mb|1D!|an|Ms or ms|nt|cuttysark: If 4@S as not making then 4@H probably would be - Poland could not lose by being in game in both rooms|pg||
nt|mcphee: and the vote is for 2 or 3?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am expecting 3nt by passell|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyone tell us what age you need to be to play in this event?  I didn't have to ask - I'm well qualified :)|pg||

nt|fifee: 2@H is interesting|pg||
nt|kareno: 1@d some sort of suction bid?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: strange west not bidding something|pg||
nt|santyclz: Anyone open the s hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fifee: minors or majors|pg||
nt|kareno: Either minors or majors.I'm told|pg||
nt|sybarra2: crash is it over 1 cl?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5C|nt|sybarra2: great club save for e/w |pg||
nt|kareno: I'm sure pass by south is forcing here |pg||
nt|sybarra2: bet so |pg||
nt|sybarra2: 6 @C might be too expensive |pg||
nt|fifee: kit thinking about his 2.5 loser hand and how can he find out if pd has controls|pg||
nt|fifee: for me it is illegal to cue at the 5 level unless you have the ace. what do you all do?|pg||
nt|kareno: Good point by spec.  Pass and pull would show extra offensive values.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: 6 @C -500?|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|jstokes: if you open any 11 count....|pg||
nt|santyclz: Only 1 taker.|pg||
nt|irwinbo: 4333 vul?  meckwell would open butnot most of us|pg||
nt|kareno: Saving over five is really risky.  |pg||
nt|fifee: yes but hard to predict by EW|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|kareno: You have to be exactly right - that they CAN makie 5 and can't make six.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: When I open 1NT with a singleton partner transfers into it!|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'd open it playing chicago.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do you get mad because slam is off?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: yes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: yup as he should!|pg||
nt|fifee: and that you will not go off 4 or more :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mcphee: only when I am in it:)|pg||
nt|kareno: That's a minor consideration but real - the biggie is that you might push them to slam making.|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|s3|nt|mcphee: thats the end of that|pg||

nt|fifee: 7 tricks available. need to develop another|pg||
nt|kareno: Ah, 10-12.  Then very optimistic raise by north.|pg||

nt|roswolf: Shezifi) for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Vladimir and Liz for their wit and perceptive comments and ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes!|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: we'll probably have a transmitting from the invitational event on Thursday evening so see you there!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not the time for the defenders to draw trump - they can make them separately by overruffing|pg||
nt|kareno: Well done!  Had east risen with the heart ten, however...|pg||
nt|kareno: (and I'm not suggesting that is the right play)|pg||
mb|1D!|an|could be 2 !Ds|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@D makes, so E-W can afford to be pushed|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But it won't happen|pg||

nt|xenya: both will make i expext|pg||

nt|vugraphzan: the future of the match lies in the hand of one Ron Pachtman |pg||
nt|cuttysark: No pressure, as they say|pg||
nt|roswolf: well east should be short in diamonds for his bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: if he goes doen it's probable that Poland will win it all, |pg||
nt|vugraphzan: remember - they need more than 38|pg||
nt|fifee: lots of conjecture with the specs|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|xenya: E showed long spades, so the finesse is percentage play|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|roswolf: should get it right now|pg||

pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: ok, unusual agreement|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: two boards left and 3nt was a push, running out of boards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do either of the major games make, i am not sure|pg||
nt|chip: I doubt either would make, Even double-dummy seems like a lot of work to do.|pg||
nt|othered1: good question|pg||
mb|3C|an|hearts, INV+|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: in practise i agree they are likely both down|pg||
mb|3S|an|Accepts INV and wants partner to declare|nt|othered1: I wonder what the lower limit on west's bid is at these colors|pg||
nt|chip: A kib criticizes the wide range 2C, but in fact overcalling 1s just trades this for different (mostly worse problems).|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3c may have been an attempt to get partner to bid his longer suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: I'm sure W could have much less (say same hand with no club honors).|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: They just explained that 3@c was invitational or better with hearts and 3@s was an accept that wanted partner to declare|pg||
nt|chip: Note says 3C was an invite+ in hearts.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: ok, now this definitely improves declarers chances|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice that east was able to play this.|pg||
nt|chip: With this lead maybe a little life, but still have to guess very well.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Robinson still doesn't know he chose correctly to have partner declarer - said he wasn't sure|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: I wonder if @S by east might not play better|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||

nt|fabsayc: down now|pg||
nt|chip: Now we can be sure he won't make, and probably Robinson's chances in the match go down also.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: yes, they'll need lucky results in CR on 62 and 63 and a huge swing on 64.|pg||

nt|sybarra: lot of imps for 2 hands |pg||
nt|sybarra: needed|pg||
nt|kareno: Doesn't look like it.  With that slam it might have been in the cards - here I doubt it very much.|pg||
nt|sybarra: they needed that slam |pg||
mb|1D!|an|cld be 2, ltd|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: they= n/s  |pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: 7@H for maximum points|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 9NT is my bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: weak 2@H - 5NT; 7@H my preference; sadly, West has more discipline about is weak 2's|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|fabsayc: well if they positive is two top honours, this is simple|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and even if not, between RKC &/or Josephine, they can surely sort it out|pg||
nt|fifee: @D lead would be more productive here with long trumps, tapping declarer|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|fifee: but we cannot be sure that 1@D is diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was the "catch all" @D bid|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tejjyid: although, East will want to test the possibility of the 7-2 @S fit, but maybe it's not possible to do everything|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|tejjyid: Josephine is 5NT trump honour ask; bid 6 with 1 or 7 with 2 of the top 3|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kareno: Hmm.. can he go down now?  |pg||
pc|c8|nt|tejjyid: sorry, it's an old-fashioned name from which youcan probably deduce when I learned the game|pg||
