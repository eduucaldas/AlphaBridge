nt|kareno: There are so many different defenses to Multi -|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: I think that he could have chosen to DBL and treat the hand as a very strong T/O of spades, but probably didn't think it was good enough for that|pg||
nt|ritong: unless lair sits for the second double|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: I think that Woolsey wrote that 3@h was natural and asking, but not certain|pg||
nt|ritong: did*|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Stewart wrote 11-13 I think but perhaps he writes a 5 that looks like a 3 so it might be 11-15 |pg||
nt|kareno: Problem with 2nt response to 1@c is all that space is used up by their own auction.|pg||
nt|ritong: well, he has 17, but let s wait|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe 11-13 or 17+?  Sorta like 2N then 4N in a natural auction, showing a hand too good for 3N?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry, I take it back - he put the note about 2NT next to an old note - it actually says 15+|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: NS have all the aces and kings plus a few other assets -- that might prove dangerous...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: That one is clear - Stewart showed support and 7 controls with A=2 and K=1|pg||
nt|kareno: Now south must find a way to discover the two third-round controls he needs.|pg||
nt|othered1: If Kit said 3@H wasn't asking, will he reconsider and work out what north means?|pg||
nt|ritong: or their lack|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: KIt definitely said 3@h was asking, I just couldn't tell whether it was also natural - since Fred wrote "support" I'm now confident that what I couldn't read said natural|pg||
nt|ritong: my bet is they will avoid it|pg||
nt|othered1: but north needs even more unbid extras than the @SQ.  I"d wonder if south couldn't find a way to show all the controls and suit honor and let it up to north?|pg||
nt|ritong: stewart might be able to show his ù@s feature, and if sollicited again, decline|pg||
nt|othered1: tough auction -- we're contriving auctions looking at 52 cards and they're not as well informed.|pg||
nt|ritong: although the @h K is not known yet|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Yes it is - the 7 controls have to be the 3 aces and heart K since Kit has the rest|pg||
nt|xenya: it is known Henri|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: I think the problem is that there isn't any way for Woolsey to tell at this point - their general approach is to have one person doing the asking and being captain, and they can't ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: change that in the middle of the auction to have him show that they have all the controls|pg||
nt|othered1: 3rd round control ask, very sophisticated.|pg||
nt|ritong: now please, guys  i m not dumb, i can see that woolsey has the missing controls  my point is : stewart doesn t|pg||
nt|ritong: know for sure it is the case|pg||
nt|kareno: So now 6@c by north asking, then 6@d by south telling and asking could do it for them.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Stewart is just going to answer Woolsey's questions. Sometimes this "captain" approach is good, sometimes it would be better to be able to show|pg||
