nt|Vugraphu1: Sorry - I was worrying about the score - you are correct that there will be 2 more segments after this one|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|othered1: Fisher - Hamilton have come in for Kaminski in the CR, a gainst Lair and Ozdil|pg||
nt|sharynr: looks like NS have a shot at 11 or 12 tricks in diamonds|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|an|hearts|mb|1S|nt|othered1: West's double is "stansdard" but not necessarily all that popular today.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: Standard for me would be 2@H (5 or more), double with 4|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|sharynr: 3@D would be better I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The only was to disclose a psyche if there is one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *way|pg||
nt|othered1: with me it's simply "I would happily have bid 1 or more @H)|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like east took double to be snapdragon (for takout)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D is somewhat wet|pg||
nt|sharynr: South should know that the hand fits very well|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Is this "walking the dog" strategy by south, bidding em up one at a time?|pg||
nt|sharynr: possibly :)|pg||
nt|othered1: if east thinks double was for takeout, then 2@H might be a cue-bid in support of @C .. . |pg||
nt|sharynr: Perhaps Lynch took the DBL as takeout..and is now in a quandry|pg||
mb|5C|nt|othered1: If east works out to pass, south will have an interesting decision (I'd bid on without any second choice)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: 2@H taken as a cue-bid.  NS now have what baseball fans would call a "fielder's choice"|pg||
nt|sharynr: i am told other room in 4@D|pg||
nt|othered1: winning defense looks to be to try to tap declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Best defence is to tap declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: snap|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Passell clarified for Lynch that in case it comes up again, the DBL and 2@h showed hearts. Then encouraged her to take her time and just think about the hand,|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: She could easily lose control here and go for a big number|pg||
nt|othered1: This is going to take careful play by the less experienced declarer . . . |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|othered1: I think it's 500 on any red continuation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but it could be more if declarer plays trumps too early|pg||
nt|sharynr: I wonder what Levit's low diamond meant|pg||
nt|othered1: Probalby looking for @H sh ift whick will ensure 500 at cost of gaininng more if declarer goes wrong|pg||
nt|sharynr: does anyone know their signal method?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|c2|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|othered1: ducking is normal strategy to gain control of trumps|pg||
nt|sharynr: good ducks by Levit|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|othered1: passive defense best here, I think (@S)|pg||

pc|s3|nt|othered1: finds the best continuation|pg||

mc|8|nt|Vugraphu1: Taking a short break to regroup|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wasn't she 800 in the endgame?|pg||
nt|sharynr: looked like down 4 Jan?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Yes, it was -4. Fixed in movie and the bidding and play are  now gone, which is perhaps just as well :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: To defend hearts!|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|othered1: And west makes an old-fashioned double rather than a simple overcall.  When he bids @H llater it will show extras.|pg||
nt|sharynr: i am in favor of a 2@H overcall myself|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|othered1: Could be a matter of what style partner can handle best.|pg||

nt|kareno: (or else Flannery).|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: meaning 1nt shows spades, but i think not|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: hamilton probably wanted to make sure he could bail out in clubs, 1s would make that tougher|pg||

nt|othered1: sounds like south inferred @D in north's hand after he first passed then acted.  That would be the inference in my partnerships, too, especially with an ambiguous 1D opening.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: or was it @S and another?|pg||
nt|sharynr: how many down?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Definitely both majors - Kaminski just asked and that's what Passell said|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sharynr: counting on a @S stopper from Levit....|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe should have just bid 3 nt immediately (for the preempt?)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharynr: I guess he wanted to punish a possible @h contract|pg||
nt|othered1: Preempt against the sacrifice if they happen tohave 9 @S?|pg||

nt|sharynr: a flannery, Roland :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have barred people for less|pg||
nt|othered1: And they committed one in the CR, earning 650|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: A sensible person like Mike Passell would obviously open 1@H, just like they do when they play bridge|pg||
nt|sharynr: may get to game if Kaminski is aggressive|pg||
nt|sharynr: and it looks like he is thinking about it|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: People who would open 2@d have many more world championships even than Mr. Passell :)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|othered1: hamilton's 3@H i n CR looks aggressive to me, but he was right |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I now see that you can't bid to 4@H if you open 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or you get X'd|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: So that silly convention costs again|pg||
nt|sharynr: not their optimum result  (N-S)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this result to be fair is a bit of a lottery|pg||
nt|sharynr: i feel for Amos, who has what looks like 2 tricks and his partner will come up with ....none|pg||
nt|othered1: That convention does provide opponents with extra information, a deficit that it's proponents don't worry about.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: All conventions, systems and treatments have their upsides and their downsides|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: But few have 18 like F|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|othered1: Absolutely and many top players evaluate them differently, often reflecting a matter of temperment|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: We'll have to agree to disagree about that Roland, but I'll still back my Flannery team against most others|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|hQ|mc|11|nt|othered1: I agree about your top Flannery teams, but bench strength likely is inferior to the non-Flannery's|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: We will restart at 4:00 Pacific time, about an hour and 5 minutes from now|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks everyone and bye for now.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: to me hamilton's 3@H was a guess also|pg||
nt|kareno: Suits break nicely and there's no problem with this contract.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I'm not sure what it means.  I play it invitational but I think he doesn't (judging by his hand)|pg||
