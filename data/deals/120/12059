nt|ahri: i don't like doubling on marginal hands. 670 demoralizes way too much. even if you are on plus with 10 of such hands, demoralizing effect is way too big|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Partner won't believe that you have longer diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahri: most pairs don't have mechanism to show 5-6 in this kind of auction|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: only the @SA@HA standing in the way of 6@D here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: tricky hand for east after the 1nt opener|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully they will find out they are missing 2 aces |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: to show a spade-diamond two-suiter he might have to transfer to spades first and then he never gets the suit lengths across|pg||
nt|sybarra: can transfer to spades, the bid @D over 2 @S andd3 !N |pg||
mb|2N!|nt|athene: some people can transfer to diamonds then bid spades naturally|pg||
nt|sybarra: *then|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I can do that   and appears to be what he is doing |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@D presumably shows enthusiasm for diamonds|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: I would also know by my pard's bid whether pard has good @D's or not |pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|d|nt|sybarra: my pard and I use the "relay" suit for good @D's but all what the understandings are|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: this could get murky; which suit does 4@C agree?|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D |pg||
mb|p|mb|r|nt|sybarra: the XX is first round control |pg||

nt|chemical_b: hi Shirley, hi all :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|athene: 4nt rkcb doesn't work very well for minor suits|pg||
nt|hagz: Maybe West guess that 3 @s is cuebid?|pg||
nt|athene: you tend to get too high|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|athene: right - as i suspected east thought 4@C agreed spades|pg||
mb|7D|nt|hagz: WOW|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: these "two suiter" auctions are real deathtraps without a lot of discussion|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: after 3@S, a simple way to play is that 4@D = good for diamonds, 4@C/@H = good for spades|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't really matter how you play as long as you agree SOMETHING|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did 2@H really go 2 down on board 2?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: It's close to impossible|pg||
nt|athene: but cue-bids when it's not clear what trumps are cause so many disasters all the time|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2@H went down on the defensive crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: declarer tried to get pitches on spades so south got a ruff and then an overruff with the @H9 too|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: i think north could have doubled 7@D there personally :)|pg||
nt|athene: imagine if your teammates have a disaster and go -1 in 6@D...it's nice to bring back +500 and 9 imps in|pg||
