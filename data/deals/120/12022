nt|patricck: been quite a quick game today, but too many players find some virtue in Sloth :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: where is this event being played|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Roland, hi, Martin!|pg||
nt|nickf: Mostly boring flat games so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It's being played in Northern NSW, just South of the Gold Coast ... if that helps you at all|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bjacobs: Anyway, it's in Australia|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|nickf: but we'll reconfigure the dealing machine for the second set|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: nonsense, they played 5cx-3 on board 3, should have been down 5|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|othered1: With @SJ right, they likely would survive 4@H (which could get tricky)|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|othered1: Isn't it time for east to show @H support?|pg||

mb|3H|nt|othered1: and?|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|nickf: but if 2NT was forcing, so would 2D|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nickf: so that means he should have raised 2 to 3|pg||
nt|othered1: well 2!N managed to pinpoint the @S lead and it's lucky that the suit only has 2 losers|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not necissarily but i would want something like jxx in spades to prefer 2nt|pg||

nt|mugsmate:  But the club 8 in hand functions as the menace card|pg||
nt|woozle: I think that declarer needs to start hearts with low to the ten, or the squeeze won't function|pg||
nt|woozle: It's the right play, I'm sure, but many would slip|pg||
mc|11|nt|woozle: Actually, looking at Wiltshire's hand, it's uncharacteristically strong for a preempt (by him) - "We use the rule of 500, but we don't take a double into account"|pg||

nt|woozle: you have to discourage it even though you want it led again|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  On a trump switch one line is to ruff a club in hand, making when spades break and either clubs break or an honour is doubleton|pg||
