nt|xenya: perhaps a somewhat light 2@C considering the vulnerability, but you want to interfere at the 2-level over 1@C whenever possible|pg||
nt|kareno: Practical bid by north.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: can't read all the details but suggests 2major may have been NF from Robinson|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: Boyd: 2nd/4th leads, UDCA, regular smith|pg||

nt|thurston: that's quite a vul 2@C overcall by Mr Lair - his partner seems to have been expecting more|pg||
nt|xenya: this won't be easy however|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Ozdil stroking his whiskers.  Lair tosses him a stick of gum.|pg||
nt|kareno: Maybe that's to preclude comments on his overcall :)|pg||

nt|thurston: questions about the dbl are known as stalling for time|pg||

nt|thurston: leaving for other room, thx, was fun if brief|pg||

nt|Walddk4: So Alon is fine :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: lamed I  mean|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not sure I'd start that way but perhaps he was looking for Kx of spades in east.|pg||
nt|kareno: He'll be surprised by west's lack of values in his suits.|pg||
nt|kareno: And this one will be counted in 100's.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Boyd fingers DK then leans back|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Boyd is a very thoughtful player.  Kibitzed him some yesterday in their QF.  Taciturn especially in comparison to Robinson|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: now Boyd handles @CQ and has another think|pg||
nt|kareno: In the CR it was also notrump but played by east.  A nice pickup for Robinson.|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: Both pairs at this table are playing Precision, but probably with a lot of different gadgets|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|othered1: Decent tactics to intervene aggressively over the ambiguous 1@D opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Sabine Auken, in her book, suggests that it's always right to stretch to bid 2@c over 1@d, because it takes up so much room|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|othered1: this is not a spot EW would choose if left to their own.|pg||

nt|othered1: +150 rather|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Should have been +200 - Woolsey's high club surely said his last card was a spade|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu1: Passell clarifies what they play over the weak NT for future boards - DBL is penalties, 2@c is Majors, 2@d is diamonds + Major|pg||

pc|s8|nt|othered1: Odd-even signals would help here, as @C2 would clarify @C position|pg||
nt|othered1: As would many other styles|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: I don't think anyone asked about signals, so I don't know what E/W play - N/S I know play UDCA|pg||
