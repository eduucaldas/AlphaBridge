nt|april7: if its 4th he need not, but it could be a falsecarding|pg||

nt|Walddk2: When you can't stand 5@S as response, you don't have cards that warrant an ask|pg||

nt|xenya: that's the question|pg||

nt|april7: 3@C or2NT for minors!|pg||

nt|garnetts: Luckilly the cards will forgive this five level transgression|pg||
nt|garnetts: luckily even|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: I assume on n/s methods  north promised no more than he has     so south has taken the bidding too high|pg||
mb|6H|nt|mmmakela: not very exciting brb cig br|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: now W has 10 tricks|pg||
nt|april7: 2 aces and a 5card suit!!!|pg||

mb|1S|nt|athene: only the @SA@HA standing in the way of 6@D here|pg||

nt|tweety1: Actually, If there is no blood, It is a good match they say... Who care:)  Kibz want blood:)|pg||
nt|haans: we are here to see blood :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hard to reach 7 clubs|pg||
nt|tweety1: hah|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: tricky hand for east after the 1nt opener|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully they will find out they are missing 2 aces |pg||
nt|april7: 3@S opening, hard to balance for EW vuln.and its ok anyway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@h is a good grand |pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 @H best here?|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  likely to get to 4@S      should be down 1|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|athene: to show a spade-diamond two-suiter he might have to transfer to spades first and then he never gets the suit lengths across|pg||
nt|sybarra: can transfer to spades, the bid @D over 2 @S andd3 !N |pg||
nt|tweety1: I thought I am the only Drakula|pg||
nt|haans: 6@C is hard|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some people can transfer to diamonds then bid spades naturally|pg||
nt|sybarra: *then|pg||
nt|april7: let see whether they reach it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now VERY hard|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S should go one off unless west starts with the A@C |pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: I can do that   and appears to be what he is doing |pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps 3@S is better than 2@S but still looks ugly to me|pg||
nt|tweety1: cant find 7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What is 1 @D?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: missing the 9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. Same as 5@D. Need to find the Q@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  Notice how important is the @DQ|pg||
nt|granguru:  Not easy to see it during the bidding in a nat system|pg||
nt|mmmakela: some dbl|pg||
nt|ady: un unlucky contract  ace of clubs wrong   and a definate trump loser|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: 3@D presumably shows enthusiasm for diamonds|pg||
nt|tweety1: I am open any bets|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bet no 6|pg||
nt|haans: some odds for 3nt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: being down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You can only handle @D 4-1 with the length in North|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I would also know by my pard's bid whether pard has good @D's or not |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: down 1 on normal defense|pg||
nt|april7: 6 they will reach|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Difficult to value after a checkback 2@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u are|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: my pard and I use the "relay" suit for good @D's but all what the understandings are|pg||
nt|haans: again odds on 3nt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 clubs it will be my bet|pg||
nt|garnetts: David would you double 1@S with the east hand?  I admit I might |pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: this could get murky; which suit does 4@C agree?|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D |pg||
nt|daman: now another @H|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: overcalls have no definite values|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but if W opens 1 @D as I would've then diff story|pg||
nt|haans: as it is not MP bidding clubs seems most logical|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: the XX is first round control |pg||
nt|athene: we can see it agrees diamonds but east might not be in on the joke :)|pg||
nt|chemical_b: hi Shirley, hi all :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  redouble shows @SA|pg||
nt|april7: XX = ace|pg||
nt|mmmakela: must respect playing strength|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|ady: not vul against not|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|ady: now down 2|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: 4nt rkcb doesn't work very well for minor suits|pg||
nt|hagz: Maybe West guess that 3 @s is cuebid?|pg||
nt|athene: you tend to get too high|pg||
nt|mmmakela: i won!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|haans: :(|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: 2 off now|pg||
nt|tweety1: Actually I open 2nt with E's hand  so tell all:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: right - as i suspected east thought 4@C agreed spades|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|hagz: WOW|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: these "two suiter" auctions are real deathtraps without a lot of discussion|pg||
nt|granguru:  As said ..a tough hand to bid|pg||
nt|granguru:  to try with your favorite partner|pg||
nt|april7: if E had only 2 @S cards, then S goes down!|pg||
nt|april7: I mean in 7|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@S and 3@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so for the perfectionists: is 10 the right card to play? what u want to find out /deceive/? opposed to playing Q/J?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|athene: after 3@S, a simple way to play is that 4@D = good for diamonds, 4@C/@H = good for spades|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't really matter how you play as long as you agree SOMETHING|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did 2@H really go 2 down on board 2?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's close to impossible|pg||
nt|athene: but cue-bids when it's not clear what trumps are cause so many disasters all the time|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2@H went down on the defensive crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: declarer tried to get pitches on spades so south got a ruff and then an overruff with the @H9 too|pg||
nt|april7: best lead for EW ofcourse, ducking is best and finding J of @C S would succeed, if not ....but now S played himself down 2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: i think north could have doubled 7@D there personally :)|pg||
nt|athene: imagine if your teammates have a disaster and go -1 in 6@D...it's nice to bring back +500 and 9 imps in|pg||
nt|ady: if you double with west hand and you find a worthwhile contract ok    but if opps eventually play you have given them a hint of the distribution which may be fatal|pg||
nt|garnetts: I thought that lead might cost and it has |pg||
pc|d6|nt|daman: yes    cannot get to dummy|pg||

nt|ady: at last the spades hve arrived|pg||
nt|ady: now e/w need to save|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is a forcing pass situation |pg||

nt|granguru:  except on a @C lead|pg||

pc|s3|nt|athene: most top pairs these days try to put the weak-2 as dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Take @S Ace-Queen, ruff a @D - and it brings 12easy tricks|pg||

nt|athene: it looked natural for south to retain @CJx though|pg||
nt|athene: when dummy is down to @HA singleton|pg||
nt|april7: looks like 6@S but.......|pg||
nt|xenya: one of the reasons why it may be dangerous to open a weak 2 on a 7-carder|pg||
nt|april7: 6 or 7 @H, that is the question!!!|pg||
nt|tweety1: part score battle|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To me, South has a 15-17 NY|pg||
nt|rodal f: I agree with u Markku. E don't want to play 3NT normaly. But if W had his max(17) and @H support. Could have been the @CQ and not the J|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so -5 in red in vol 3 nt without opps bidding and no freak hands|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes they will not have figured on that I suppose |pg||
mb|1C|nt|april7: thats true too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another slam in @h but only on N(!) (@s ruff)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: north might open 1@D, hoping for 1@D - 1@H - 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: but what he might get is the dummy in 1@D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now intersting maybe|pg||
nt|rodal f: A hand for Roland again. 20-20|pg||
nt|ady: e/w likely to make 3NT    but will they get there?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|2N!|nt|ralfwil: and with this bidding sequence they are on the right way|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H possible|pg||
nt|mmmakela:  4 @H ?|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate diamond position for e/w  south unable to stop the run of the suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: The dreaded lehbensol--I am afraid I would just have bid 3NT as east and hoped for the best |pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: bet he's lurking around somewhere..|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|athene: of course, no-one ever passing 1minor openers these days|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D? |pg||
nt|haans: opps do help  NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think 3@D would be a huge underbid|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT gets the hand across|pg||
nt|sybarra: that works also |pg||
mb|3D|nt|ralfwil: ??? 6@s ???|pg||
nt|tweety1: not on @c lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: 14-16 or upgraded to 15 by the middlecards?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think South is wonerinf if he can jsutify a 3@S bid--and I am not convinced North can justify 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: wondering even|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: top club, @C9, spade switch maybe|pg||
nt|haans: Nortyh pass i did not undersand|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|mmmakela: i'd upgrade|pg||
nt|rodal f: Me to:)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: looks like 16 to me|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|april7: what about 7 @S now???5NT would be Josephine for @H and then one might be able to bid 7|pg||
nt|rodal f: I'll check|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: hmmm...not sure i like the @C4, whatever their methods...doesn't west want to play either a BIG one (@C9) or a SMALL one (@C2)?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I'd never give up as south here|pg||
nt|ady: J@H switch might beat this|pg||
nt|garnetts: This an occasion where 3@D needed to be played by west--but East can play to drop the K@D as South needs it to justify not just an opening but a think too lol|pg||
nt|ady: will need to avoid the diamond finesse   so that might provoke an overtrick|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: the more spades you have the less partner have|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the program doesn't see the merits of dias suit|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: now declarer has to decide whether to cash out for one down or try and sneak a trick through|pg||

nt|sybarra: tried to sneak a @s|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
nt|april7: a very unfortunate decision by S|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c5|pc|dQ|nt|athene: if you run diamonds then they know they can't let you have a spade because that gives you nine|pg||
nt|garnetts: well done can claim now |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|sybarra: true|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: didnt he lead the K?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: what shd N bid Hans ?|pg||
nt|haans: North more likely to have KJx inn spades|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d5|nt|athene: yup|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe low better?|pg||
nt|haans: he have cards to 3@H|pg||
pc|s9|pg||

nt|haans: or 2nt leb|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NOOOO with 3|pg||
nt|ady: one of the occasions when a 4-1 split is better than 3-2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|haans: you 3@H to make them bid 3@S going down|pg||
nt|mmmakela: One day I promise I'll write a book about appreciating playing strength as opposed to traditional point count even in 1 NT openings......|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spec asked me if Nunes is Claudio. Some who know?|pg||

nt|roswolf: an easy enough slam to bid and play|pg||
nt|miguelgon: easy 6 hearts i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 4NT bid in the CR would be quantitive for me|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|miguelgon: 4nt must be cuantitative|pg||
nt|patricck: if the @D were badly split as well as the @HK offside it would be an interesting declarer problem, but shouldn't have any trouble on this layout|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: then why would he have bid 5@S?|pg||
nt|miguelgon: 1nt was 15-17|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: What does it take to support hearts? Like 3@H|pg||

nt|athene: it's not as though west has @DKx, when he might well duck the @SK|pg||
nt|xenya: another solid game|pg||
nt|april7: lucky stop, because if @S are 3-2 slam is a very good one|pg||
nt|mmmakela: it's south who must act period|pg||
nt|tweety1: action?|pg||
nt|ady: good morning Victor|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning Victor|pg||
nt|odysseus69: as I arrive so does a slam|pg||
nt|garnetts: reasonable heart slam |pg||
nt|ady: 6@H  a make for e/w|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good morning David squared|pg||
nt|garnetts: west might open with 1NT which would not make so attractive a proposition |pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: declarer was pretty sure where the @SA was|pg||
nt|athene: he could have tried a diamond to the @D10 and a small spade, but when the @D10 holds that's pretty revealing|pg||
nt|april7: another 3NT but going down on very bad breaks everywhere|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i bet they get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: basically the defence have to be very sleepy to let that one through|pg||
nt|athene: after the heart switch at trick 2|pg||
nt|april7: another unfortunate 4 @H contract|pg||
nt|mmmakela: anybody upgrading now|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|mmmakela: he did!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this new 2C convention may work|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: @h is a polular suit to play. now only 3@h on EW|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North - without any reason|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hard to be critical of that as a 1@S rsponse would make a rebid awkward|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: wow, almost a repeat performance here!|pg||
nt|athene: a monster with diamonds facing not very much with @HJ10xxx :)|pg||
nt|april7: exchange NS hand and you have 10 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|rodal f: As hard as EW have bidded before I precume NS to end in 3NT:) A nice contract|pg||
nt|ady: seems to be fashionable to open 1NT on 5-4-2-2 shapes|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but this time game will make|pg||
nt|athene: now east isn't sure whether to show the fifth heart or the spade stop, maybe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: popular..|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i like to play that 3H is now forcing|pg||
mb|4N|nt|daman: East will invite|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however most play as invitational|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: on their way|pg||
mb|5S|nt|rodal f: 12-14? And Santos gave up by the 10|pg||
nt|ady: forced now as 5@S will come|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I had doubled on S in this sequence|pg||
nt|haans: and we see The LAW in action|pg||
nt|garnetts: You and Chris Dixon play all such raises as forcing and have done for years --and I adopted it too--it is an excellent idea--|pg||
mb|6H|nt|hawe45:  9 easy tricks here|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: good auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: the destructing value of 1 NT is underapreciated, IMHO any excuse to open 1 NT is a good one!|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: this is interesting for north actually|pg||
nt|athene: if he puts declarer with the @SK, he might try and play against dummy|pg||
nt|athene: giving declarer the @SK is his ninth trick|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|april7: take K and finesse in @C!!!|pg||
nt|daman: impossible for this to make|pg||
nt|april7: but its a good try|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: he might play his partner for the @HK and @CQ and exit a diamond|pg||
nt|daman: maybe if S blocks the @Hs|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think you play 1@H 2@D 2@H 3@H as forcing too |pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: admittedly that gives declarer very little for his negative double|pg||
nt|haans:  some blood|pg||
nt|odysseus69: chris likes the Dixon game try - with the invitational hands just bid game|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|daman: I would have played the @H Jack|pg||
pc|hT|nt|april7: N will not lead ace after @C Q, but still not possible to make|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|athene: but sometimes your only chance to beat a contract is to play declarer for not having his bid :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Specs might can tell if NS use 12-14 at non vul.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|april7: S can't make a mistake!!!|pg||
nt|april7: the last hand was ofcourse very unlucky but selfinflicted !!!|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|haans: some reasons to play @HA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|odysseus69: yes we do|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|xenya: S should unblock as a matter of course -- but that doesn't make much difference on this layout|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, the J looks more natural|pg||
nt|april7: even  now not possible to make, butthe chance was there|pg||
nt|april7: defence was trying to help but at no avail|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however we do not play 2/1 |pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can get both, the American way|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT  2@C  ;  2@H   3@S   balanced slam try with heart support|pg||
nt|Walddk4: same applies over 2@S response. The opposite major is a slam try|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then you still have the natural invites|pg||
nt|garnetts: another adjunct to that is 1H  2@C 2@D  2@H should always show two--that was a method I also though very useful |pg||
nt|odysseus69: I like the jumps as splinters- chacun....|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mmmakela: after S A very good reasons|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|xenya: could be an imp to Manuel Neto|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mmmakela: never mind the singletons or a little meagre poincount, 1 NT is a  bid of a real winner in the long run|pg||

nt|odysseus69: not clear what was best line- and any reasonable line works|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@S - 1NT; 2@D - 2@S; and north will make another try, surely|pg||
nt|mmmakela: only 2 aces missing|pg||
nt|haans: he did know as we did HE did not like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I agree--another hand type I do not like--after say 1@D 1@H waht is the best rebid with the South hand?  |pg||
nt|ady: if Q@D  had not dropped   might have finessed 10@C   and plaayed to ruff 2 spades|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: perhaps just a gentle 3@D |pg||
nt|haans: 6@S or 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now south will probably just pass it|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S 1 down and 5@D at least 1 down|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra2: and e/w have wrong colors to come in |pg||
nt|xenya: now do you double or bid 2@D as W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the hearts are a worry for 3nt when partner has ten cards in the pointed suits|pg||
nt|april7: N should bid 3 @S not 2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: time to take an sight check Hans|pg||
mb|4H|nt|xenya: S will do it for him|pg||
nt|haans: right u are 5@S max|pg||
nt|ady: might get to 4@H here    going down|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: no..|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2NT is showing the hand type and point count--but if you feel you must support hearts how many?  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: 2@D is a better bid and later X of 2 @S showinf preference for other szuits|pg||
nt|april7: most of zthe times 6-3-3-1|pg||
nt|april7: because with5-4-3-1 X is best|pg||
nt|april7: only @C lead kills the contract of 4@S,@H lead gives S the time to set up the J of @D|pg||
nt|odysseus69: happy with 4H Davids?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: no lead can defeat @s|pg||

nt|ady: yes  |pg||
pc|h2|nt|mmmakela: 5 even nicer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I lead a @D from South|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now 660|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: south likes his @SQ and @CA|pg||
nt|athene: but then we saw on board 4 that south doesn't underbid :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: abd @S are 3/3  can N handle it?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: *and|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard a @h instead|pg||
nt|ady: passive club best|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: 4 top losers|pg||
nt|athene: @DA, @HA, two trumps|pg||
nt|athene: now the @HQ goes away on a club - he might make it|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. No squize on here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: any chance of dropping heart king?|pg||
nt|garnetts: that trump lead makes matters interesting--|pg||
nt|garnetts: Would east lead from Kxx--maybe we all might fancy that lead |pg||
nt|ady: possible to get heart right|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the failure to return a heart may tip declarer|pg||
nt|ady: with this in north hand and playa diamond seems best|pg||
nt|garnetts: possibly but hard to explain if the were 3-2 with split honours |pg||
nt|ady: win|pg||
nt|ady: 10@C  played now would give extra entry|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra2: cant he get the @H queen away?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mmmakela: can E pull in these zones|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|garnetts: that failure to return a heart would be suspicious if he had won with the K--not so much with the Q as he will know partner has the king |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|haans: and NS win|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: he did see clubs losers|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|sybarra2: its his only chance |pg||
nt|athene: when you know declarer has 5-5 in spades and diamonds, perhaps you should lay down the @HA on opening lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N's bidding maybe shd tip off to pull, I don't know|pg||
pc|cA|nt|odysseus69: if he won with the king declarer would be sure to drop the Q|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: but of course there are many layouts where that would be catastrophic - @HKx with declarer, or ruff and @HKQ set up in dummy for club pitches, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: opening leads are basically just evil|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the worst leads in general:Jxx Jxxx 10xx Jx against any contract|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|april7: suicide!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: S defeated it himself|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like he is now forced to play for the drop|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|ady: a small possibility that if a 2nd heart finesse is taken  west might at that point be end plaayed and have to play a spade|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|april7: E didn't raise, with 4 trumps you always should consider, but at teams its questionable with so weak hand|pg||
nt|april7: in desperate situation S should play @D even from hand!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a card blindness|pg||
nt|garnetts: unless he plans to ruff a diamond|pg||
pc|d8|nt|odysseus69: he could ruff a diamond back|pg||
nt|ady: no    Lara has taken care of that|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: hmmm...he gets forced now|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
