mb|1D|mb|p|nt|kareno: 2@c must have been for takeout - major minor??|pg||

nt|kareno: It's a lucky diamond slam n/s but it has the virtue of making.|pg||
nt|kareno: I expect a 3@s bid from south for a number of reasons.|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm getting conflicting evaluations of how good the slam is (always appreciative of specs' input)|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: wrong void george|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this says dont lead a spade|pg||
nt|kareno: He is insistent on no spade lead with the double.  Heart likely but nothing will defeat this slam.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu3: but considering that it might not be bid at the other table (as here) he's only risking an imp or so|pg||

nt|fabsayc: here the slam was always going to be bid|pg||
nt|kareno: West had little enough for the original spade bid :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: how do you think he'll play the clubs?|pg||
nt|kareno: Small from the dummy :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: or 8?|pg||
nt|kareno: He has no choice how to play them.  The nine pops up and he'll have to play the jack.  Or west will insert an honor and tell all.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might lead 8, but only for style points|pg||
nt|kareno: Maybe the ten but I doubt he'll do that either.  He wins with KQ onside or Kx or Qx onside.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: west has already shown out in diamonds, though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 10 might gain if he could eliminate the side suits, but not possible here|pg||

nt|Walddk2: And a swing it will be. E-W cashed the first five tricks next door|pg||
nt|chip: of course W will have a bad picture of the hand thinking declarer has the spade ace (so his partner probably has the heart ace).|pg||
nt|chip: Wonder if the J lead at trick one was supposed to deny a higher honor (that would explain E's duck).|pg||

nt|othered1: I'd be surprised if west false carded his partner on opening lead.  He's been very careful to put partner in positions where she figures to do well and avoid setting more complex ...|pg||
nt|othered1: problems.  |pg||
mc|10|nt|chip: I don't think W false carded on lead, but sometimes can be issues over what today's agreement is.|pg||

nt|kareno: Although non-vul, it's a little more of a push.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bettter try 3nt to have any hope|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: They both pushed on this one.  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: all oz values in spades mean 4s is very unlikely to reach, side suits will have too many holes|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kareno: But 3nt was the one that would make on the logical heart lead.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||

pc|s3|pc|h2|pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: on heart queen lead it would go down in 3nt i think, but on low heart would make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the point is on heart queen lead george can shift to a club|pg||
nt|kareno: Aren't there just nine tricks on heart, heart?  Why would west switch to clubs unless east led the queen specifically of hearts.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is what i said karen|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, but low heart is the correct lead from that holding.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kareno: Right you are.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sometimes but here this is likely to be a race hand|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
