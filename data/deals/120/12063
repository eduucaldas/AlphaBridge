nt|Walddk4: http://www.freewebs.com/fpbridge/CNEO_Final_2009_R1.pdf  for round 1 results|pg||
nt|april7: a grand!!!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: only the @SA@HA standing in the way of 6@D here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: tricky hand for east after the 1nt opener|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully they will find out they are missing 2 aces |pg||
nt|april7: 3@S opening, hard to balance for EW vuln.and its ok anyway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@h is a good grand |pg||
mb|2C|an|gf|nt|athene: to show a spade-diamond two-suiter he might have to transfer to spades first and then he never gets the suit lengths across|pg||
nt|sybarra: can transfer to spades, the bid @D over 2 @S andd3 !N |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some people can transfer to diamonds then bid spades naturally|pg||
nt|sybarra: *then|pg||
nt|april7: let see whether they reach it|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: I can do that   and appears to be what he is doing |pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps 3@S is better than 2@S but still looks ugly to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  Notice how important is the @DQ|pg||
nt|granguru:  Not easy to see it during the bidding in a nat system|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|athene: 3@D presumably shows enthusiasm for diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I would also know by my pard's bid whether pard has good @D's or not |pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|daman: down 1 on normal defense|pg||
nt|april7: 6 they will reach|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Difficult to value after a checkback 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: my pard and I use the "relay" suit for good @D's but all what the understandings are|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: this could get murky; which suit does 4@C agree?|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D |pg||
nt|daman: now another @H|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|sybarra: the XX is first round control |pg||
nt|athene: we can see it agrees diamonds but east might not be in on the joke :)|pg||
nt|chemical_b: hi Shirley, hi all :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  redouble shows @SA|pg||
nt|april7: XX = ace|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|athene: 4nt rkcb doesn't work very well for minor suits|pg||
nt|hagz: Maybe West guess that 3 @s is cuebid?|pg||
nt|athene: you tend to get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2 off now|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: right - as i suspected east thought 4@C agreed spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|hagz: WOW|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: these "two suiter" auctions are real deathtraps without a lot of discussion|pg||
nt|granguru:  As said ..a tough hand to bid|pg||
nt|granguru:  to try with your favorite partner|pg||
nt|april7: if E had only 2 @S cards, then S goes down!|pg||
nt|april7: I mean in 7|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@S and 3@H|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|athene: after 3@S, a simple way to play is that 4@D = good for diamonds, 4@C/@H = good for spades|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't really matter how you play as long as you agree SOMETHING|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did 2@H really go 2 down on board 2?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's close to impossible|pg||
nt|athene: but cue-bids when it's not clear what trumps are cause so many disasters all the time|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2@H went down on the defensive crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: declarer tried to get pitches on spades so south got a ruff and then an overruff with the @H9 too|pg||
nt|april7: best lead for EW ofcourse, ducking is best and finding J of @C S would succeed, if not ....but now S played himself down 2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: i think north could have doubled 7@D there personally :)|pg||
nt|athene: imagine if your teammates have a disaster and go -1 in 6@D...it's nice to bring back +500 and 9 imps in|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|daman: yes    cannot get to dummy|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|s6|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|athene: when you have a big trump holding but no shortage, it's often bad news in defence|pg||
nt|athene: because declarer if he reads the position can cash lots of side-suit winners and you end up with nothing but trumps|pg||
nt|athene: these clever sort of plays abound in textbooks|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps if south had doubled, it might have tipped declarer off to the trump break (what else can south hand?)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|d2|pc|h9|pg||
