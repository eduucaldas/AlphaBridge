nt|roswolf: a lucky 3nt here|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 3NT makes because declarer can hold up the A@H until the 3rd round and the A@D is not with the long hearts|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ady: e/w likely to reach 3NT    nees to duck twice if opening heart lead  fairly routine|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, hearts could have been 4-4 and then it doesn't matter who has @DA when spades produce four tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: 2@H likely to be 3rd & 5th leads  so East knows hearts not 4-4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||

nt|dburn: well, not "very lucky"|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|dburn: below the required odds for a non-vulnerable game, it's true|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3NT on the way now?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: tempting for W|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: but he is bidding low|pg||
nt|ady: difficult to get to 5@C on e/w cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: West won't look for a game facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  likely to make     South will be in troubled with discards on diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: odd sort of bid, 1@s - do North-South play four-card majors?|pg||
nt|hedyg: preemptish 1@s :)|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|april7: E could X 1SA as if would be in direct position because nonvuln.|pg||
nt|xenya: all quite normal so far|pg||
nt|april7: 8 tricks in NT also|pg||
nt|xenya: bur W might elect to bid 2@S now?|pg||
nt|april7: but 2NT would be for minors probably|pg||
nt|daman: what would we bid with the West hand?|pg||
nt|xenya: that's the question|pg||
nt|daman: not easy|pg||
nt|april7: 3@C or2NT for minors!|pg||

nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|april7: both contract work though @D and @C|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, at least now we know what 2@h means|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H now again Tartan|pg||
nt|dburn: either weak with spades or strong balanced|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|ady: looks as though 3@S in CR should have been only down 1|pg||
nt|calabres: rite|pg||
nt|roswolf: hardly scottish |pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: e/w should compete|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, East will consider that he would double after 2@s-pass-pass, so he will double here|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has a problem re level|pg||
nt|dburn: and it's a question of how much rope West gives his partner|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|patricck: West has a pretty good hand facing a partner who doubled at his first opportunity|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed the stratosphere beckons now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: running into a minus|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Down 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If he takes his seven top tricks, otherwise more|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5th longest works here|pg||
nt|patricck: perhaps pass would have been the better action from East considering his hand had no aces, and whichever major south had his cards were poorly placed|pg||
nt|hedyg: no X by N over 3@s to show an honour in @s|pg||
nt|patricck: a lot of imps swingng on the lead|pg||
nt|dburn: South was known to have spades (if weak) - he could not have hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, if Dias does not lead a spade .....|pg||
nt|roswolf: south mighr lead a heart perhaps?|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, he could have 20-22 balanced, in which case East might regret bidding|pg||
pc|s2|nt|patricck: ok, if south known to have spades then @SK bad, so double probably an overbid|pg||
nt|hedyg: hardly @H, E sort of showed those|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah 7th highest|pg||
nt|ady: 2 down if cashing out|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|patricck: obviously 3rds, 5ths and 7ths :)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, anyone would double after 2@s was passed round, and East was in the same sort of position|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed but then West could have bid a constructive 3@D|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|dburn: awkward hand, really - if West was using lebensohl so that 3@d would be constructive, his 3@s was an overbid|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think W would have doubled with xx in @H, maybe 2NT?|pg||
nt|patricck: , yes, but partner is there for you if 2@S passed around to him.... in this case West would bid 2NT for minors|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: North fell asleep|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dA|nt|dburn: sure, but West would pass throughout with a balanced 14 count or so|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And now made :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm incroyable|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, what do we think North was hoping for?|pg||
mc|9|nt|roswolf: north believes opps rather than pard|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, East's bidding appears to have been vindicated, but I don't quite understand why|pg||
nt|calabres: big discussion about the 2@S lead|pg||

mb|3S|nt|athene: only the @SA@HA standing in the way of 6@D here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: tricky hand for east after the 1nt opener|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully they will find out they are missing 2 aces |pg||
nt|april7: 3@S opening, hard to balance for EW vuln.and its ok anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: to show a spade-diamond two-suiter he might have to transfer to spades first and then he never gets the suit lengths across|pg||
nt|sybarra: can transfer to spades, the bid @D over 2 @S andd3 !N |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some people can transfer to diamonds then bid spades naturally|pg||
nt|sybarra: *then|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: I can do that   and appears to be what he is doing |pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps 3@S is better than 2@S but still looks ugly to me|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|athene: 3@D presumably shows enthusiasm for diamonds|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would also know by my pard's bid whether pard has good @D's or not |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|daman: down 1 on normal defense|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: my pard and I use the "relay" suit for good @D's but all what the understandings are|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: this could get murky; which suit does 4@C agree?|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D |pg||
nt|daman: now another @H|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|sybarra: the XX is first round control |pg||

pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|s8|nt|athene: 4nt rkcb doesn't work very well for minor suits|pg||
nt|hagz: Maybe West guess that 3 @s is cuebid?|pg||
nt|athene: you tend to get too high|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 off now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: right - as i suspected east thought 4@C agreed spades|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hagz: WOW|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: these "two suiter" auctions are real deathtraps without a lot of discussion|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: after 3@S, a simple way to play is that 4@D = good for diamonds, 4@C/@H = good for spades|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't really matter how you play as long as you agree SOMETHING|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did 2@H really go 2 down on board 2?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk4: It's close to impossible|pg||
nt|athene: but cue-bids when it's not clear what trumps are cause so many disasters all the time|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2@H went down on the defensive crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: declarer tried to get pitches on spades so south got a ruff and then an overruff with the @H9 too|pg||
nt|april7: best lead for EW ofcourse, ducking is best and finding J of @C S would succeed, if not ....but now S played himself down 2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: i think north could have doubled 7@D there personally :)|pg||
nt|athene: imagine if your teammates have a disaster and go -1 in 6@D...it's nice to bring back +500 and 9 imps in|pg||

nt|dburn: indeed - that may have distracted North, and I am not sure why South led it|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: he didnt want to waste the 3 and 4 @s|pg||
nt|ady: safest slam 6NT  for n/s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing wrong with 6@S although 6NT is safer. They usually don't ruff anything in notrump|pg||
nt|patricck: North/South will be happy to reach 6@S.....best contact is 6NT, but both contracts make today because there is no ruff available for EW|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|calabres: S should had lead th 4@S in previous|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: agree|pg||

nt|roswolf: this will set spades as trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: now S is worried that N will take 4@d as fit rather than cuebid|pg||
nt|dburn: not totally clear for South to drive to a slam on his own, but if he bids 4@d North may take up the slack|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: and 4NT as quantitative|pg||

nt|hedyg: well as to the Portuguese Bridge Federation for sharing this event with BBO, especailly to Luis Correia who was instrumental in organising these broadcasts|pg||
nt|patricck: EW lucky in the closed room. Fortunate @S position meant 5@C couldn't be beaten.... 3NT or even 4@H are much better contracts|pg||
nt|hedyg: thank you all for joining and for your kind and helpful comments; we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|hedyg: we will be back at 7:00 am Los Angeles, 10:00 am New York, 16.00 Paris, 3:00 pm London|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 5@C in closed room a risky contract    could have run into 2 spades and a ruff   rather play 4@H   but 3NT seems the best|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: easy 4@S for e/w   10 or 11 tricks on diamond view|pg||
nt|hedyg: no we dont, but Luis does !|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Luis|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a gentle start|pg||
nt|hedyg: ola Luis :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|patricck: should be a quiet 4@S to get us started here, an overtrick on the diamond guess|pg||
nt|calabres: Our Vugraph Operators are Mariana Leit√£o in OR and Rita Russo in CR. Wish both a good work.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 15 and 16 first, followed by comparisons from the closed room when we roll over to board 1|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Mariana|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|hedyg: basic 2/1 Luis?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i play splinter bids weaker than this|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the splinter may encourage wersy to make a try|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
mc|11|nt|hedyg: splinter bids should be limited hands|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: 6nt is best here, but no-one can be criticized for ending in 6@H, i guess|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|sybarra2: its not matchpoints |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|athene: interesting that both Easts started the same way - transfer to hearts, then 3@C|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if it's some artificial scheme?|pg||
nt|xenya: should be flat|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|athene: more likely they had to invent a club suit as otherwise it's hard to develop the bidding|pg||

nt|hedyg: no idea what 2@H is|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|Walddk2: Unusual use of 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: on a heart lead it may be possible to make 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: looks as though it may be a Tartan Two Bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: must mean 22 hcps balanced hand..|pg||
nt|hedyg: :p|pg||
nt|dburn: well, could be "either weak with spades or strong balanced"|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: might play 4@S/|pg||
nt|ady: south likely to raise to 3NT   hoping diamonds work|pg||
nt|roswolf: not now|pg||
nt|patricck: even on a non-heart lead it may be possible, East probably gets endplayed|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|hedyg: N taking off?|pg||
nt|roswolf: north making a slam try?|pg||
nt|dburn: not at all sure about this|pg||
nt|ady: what suit agreed?|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South forgot that he was supposed to transfer to 3NT somehow|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: quite likely|pg||
mb|5D|nt|hedyg: or is 2@H a mistake? does N think he opened 2@c?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: all very mysterious|pg||
nt|ady: 1 too high unless mis defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: and booked for a minus score|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: maybe 3NT is xfer to a minor and 4@c p/c|pg||
nt|dburn: not impossible that declarer will finesse this|pg||
nt|hedyg: (trying to guess here)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Tartan Two Bids were conceived Hugh Kelsey and Tom Culbertson of Scotland. The essence of the concept is that 2@H and 2@D are Multi openings|pg||
nt|ady: east just needs to play low if a small diamond from dummy|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|dburn: he did|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s3|nt|ady: reasonable  to try and avoid a spade loser with 2 discards|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|dburn: not unreasonably either - the @h4 could easily have been low from some number to the queen|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|ady: now even if east rises with A@D   another heart ok|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|athene: 4@H can probably come to 11 tricks for a flat board|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
