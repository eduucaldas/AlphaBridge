nt|Vugraphu3: This round we will have the current leaders, Nickell against the Kendrick team from England & the Netherlands|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Karen Allison and Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: Because the Lin file will not retain names, we're going to tell them to you before each round even though it seems unnecessry - at this table we have Ralph Katz North, Nick Nickell ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: South, Brian Senior East and David Kendrick West|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: This is considered by many to be the toughest form of team bridge, the Board-a-Match.  Win, lose or tie are the only possibilities.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|paulhac:  It could be a good result for Nickell if they play 4@S in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: When these pairs sat down there was some joking about the fact that the EW pair play 4 card Majors :). |pg||
nt|kareno: 4@s could well go down, losing two hearts, a diamond and a spade.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kareno: Conservative pass by Nickell at the vulnerability.|pg||

nt|jtr: Hi Karen@h|pg||
nt|kareno: At this level I think it is just values, penalties.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Board 1 goes to the European team. 3NT bid and made in the closed room|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jtr: North has an unsuitable hand to remove anyway despite the 7th @h|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|paulhac:  They avoided their 4-4 major on the first board so Kendrick scored the point|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|kareno: If they start with three rounds of hearts, then cash their winners, a fourth heart will inflict a painful uppercut.|pg||

nt|kareno: Needed to cash that diamond first, however.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the closed room, Jan van Cleeff (Netherlands) - Jon Sveindal (Norway) are N-S against Meckstroth-Rodwell|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Again a good sacrificeas 4@H makes|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt a fine spot on the first board.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: But will South pass? He 100% should|pg||
nt|kareno: We used to say, "No double, no trouble"|pg||

pc|cT|pc|h8|pc|d5|mc|8|nt|Vugraphu3: That's the end of this round. We'll be back in a bit with the second round.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  No idea if this is a good or bad result and for whom|pg||
nt|kareno: One thing to remember about this form of scoring is that you try hard not to put any board out of reach of your teammates.  So minus 100 can be easily covered, while minus 470 ...|pg||
nt|kareno: cannot.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 3 to Europe. Meckwell tried 3NT, not a success|pg||
nt|paulhac:  But it could have been 300 Karen|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, it could.  And for the same good result but what if it made?  West has no guarantee to defeat it.|pg||
nt|jtr: They had 23 points between them so 3NT is routine|pg||
nt|jtr: Did they make any slam tries en route?:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Sounds like the Rixi-Fritzi point count :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A couple :)|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyway, 3NT is going 2 down, so 2 boards to Senior, 1 to Nickell|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There we have it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Short break before round 2|pg||
nt|jtr: I can only find the top ten teams on the website|pg||
nt|jtr: Are there more anywhere?|pg||
nt|jtr: Usually they have a separate entry for the event|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Van Cleef made an interesting bid of 3@D over 1NT forcing Meckwell into game|pg||
nt|paulhac:  The final is 10 teams|pg||
nt|jtr: Only ten remain?|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah right  It just said 10 out of 42|pg||
nt|kareno: Interesting.  Used to come down to 11.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  42 started going down to 20|pg||
nt|jtr: Thanks for all the help|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 11? They surely can't have an odd number of teams|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A sitout you mean?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  The event is too tough for most players who elect therefore to play the Swiss|pg||
nt|kareno: That was the formula (round robin) for I can't tell you how many years.  No sitout.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: Next round we will have Becker vs Polowan. At this table, E-W are Jakob Morgan and Michael Polowan - NS have not yet arrived|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Morgan and Polowan are having a good tournament always up with the leaders|pg||
nt|kareno: Now BeBe has jumped into my lap and is sharing my yogurt.  Yes, and purring too!|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: My memory was wrong & Jake Morgan is with a "c" not a "k" NS are Michael Becker & Aubrey Strul|pg||

pc|s6|pc|c3|pg||

nt|me argent: give jon @H@H from me|pg||

pc|d9|nt|paulhac:  Fair game needs the diamonds 4-4 or no diamond lead or a bit of luck|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: Strul checks on what the lead means - Polowan says it would show the ten if he were leading from length|pg||

nt|kit: you would want to be in 7NT at this form of scoring (assuming some grand bid at other table), since it is at worst on spade hook|pg||
nt|xenya: W elects to convert to NT|pg||
nt|kit: I think at this point West will pass, as any grand may be thin from his point of view|pg||

nt|me argent: good biddings by EW inOR|pg||
nt|xenya: Lindqvist doesn't know 7N fails -- we do|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Hi Jack|pg||
nt|jtr: Welcome Jack|pg||
nt|joest: one interesting thing about that 1@s call|pg||
nt|paulhac:  If East had passed and South had bid 1@S where would E/W have ended up?|pg||
nt|joest: when RHO shows spades you have to have a reason to bid imho|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: Next round we'll have teams with players from 5 countries (Kwiecien all Polish and Delmonte with 4 countries represented). This is really an international event|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|joest: so you should be at least as  distributional as this|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|jtr: A @h would have been more awkward obviously|pg||
nt|kareno: For specs just arriving, ten teams remain in this event and are playing three-board rounds with the scoring BAM - win = 1 point, tie = 1/2 point, lose =0 points.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 points a win or a tie?|pg||
nt|kareno: Win here.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Win|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks|pg||
nt|kareno: So lots of 3nt contracts instead of 4 major, trying for that extra ten points for the win.|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|paulhac:  He could have marginally recovered by ducking the first club but how tough is that|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|h3|nt|jtr: Not saying a @h is automatic but either that or a @s seems sane|pg||
nt|joest: partner is known to have long clubs (or longish) yet did not lead them. Inference declarer isstrong there|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
pc|h5|mc|8|nt|paulhac:  Could have been worse for N/S|pg||
nt|jtr: The @d switch probably saved a trick|pg||
nt|joest: at that point declarer was counted out|pg||
nt|jtr: North would have been in trouble on the last @c otherwise|pg||
nt|kareno: For the spec who was asking, the scoring in the top left has no real meaning; we are trying to tell you the results board by board.|pg||
nt|jtr: Look at movie for teh individual 3 boards in each match|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: The Polish pair (Kwiecien will be S, Jagniewski N) have arrived at the table, but the EW pair aren't here yet, so I can't go on to board 7. Will as soon as they get here. EW team ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: will be Delmonte|pg||
nt|joest: being held to 90 next door i believe|pg||
nt|jtr: is this barometerised?|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess it shouldnt be|pg||
nt|kareno: I doubt it is barometer|pg||
nt|paulhac:  The second half certainly is|pg||
nt|jtr: So teams can take punts if needed?|pg||
nt|kareno: After the first half, everyone will know their score.  I doubt it is published round by round.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  It must be because we would not get the boards in order|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: No one can start until everyone is ready, because they're all playing the same boards, so we have a lot of people standing around ready to play and some still playing|pg||
nt|kareno: Most likely the boards are being played in the same order for security.  |pg||
nt|paulhac:  You can find out your score at the end of each round (If you play quickly enough)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: The scores will be posted for the players to see after each round, but with a one round delay - so after the second round, scores from the first round were posted, but I haven't ...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He is because his opening was limited to 15 hcp. N-S play Precision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So he has a very good hand in context|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Difficult to find a cue bidding sequence|pg||
nt|jtr: He has a great hand|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Good nose|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe 4@h should be a cue here?|pg||
nt|joest: next door Rita Shugart raised 2@s to 3 which might cause Robson to hit the gas|pg||
nt|jtr: Having not repeated them over 2@s|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kareno: Great trumps but they will have to be used ruffing diamonds.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think Platnick's was concerned because partner must ruff diamonds with big trumps|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s4|nt|joest: rightfully concerned|pg||
nt|kareno: Raising a second suit with only three could lead to problems.  Of course, they may play that 1@h - 2@d - 2@s is just natural and denies extras.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|joest: of course if partner has ace of clubs and all he needs to do is knock out the ace of diamonds...different story|pg||
nt|joest: depends on where his cards are|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Not an easy hand to play at this form of scoring|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|s6|pg||

nt|Walddk2: In the other room, Robson also took the low road. He simply raised Shugart's 3@S to game|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Still should come to 11 tricks but likely to be slowly|pg||
nt|kareno: It has been known to happen, David, but the first time is generally the last time :)|pg||

nt|dburn: if West was slow over 4@h, East's double might be cancelled|pg||
nt|dburn: not that any of it will matter, since whether NS were -100 in 5@h doubled or plus 420 in 4@h is irrelevant|pg||

nt|joest: this is a reasonable treatment.   Now North can bid 2@s and you can play 4@s without getting the heart king attacked on the go|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: Hampson alerted 2@h and explained that it was natural; Greco didn't alert but also said natural when Strul asked. Both Strul & Becker alerted DBL - Becker said "cards" - I couldn't ...|pg||

nt|joest: next door south PASSED over 2@h, north reopened with 2@s and they are ina spade game|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu2: N to E: We haven't discussed this auction.|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|xenya: seems he could take 11 but that won't matter|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: on the standard trump lead this will not be a lot of fun|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|paulhac:  Tough bid for South over 1NT|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|joest: I've been convinced that old-fashioned "Landy" is good.   Partner can bid 2@d asking for longer majors which permits you to get in with 5-4 either way|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d6|nt|joest: of course that convention is about sixty years old :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: An oldie but goodie?|pg||
nt|joest: I think it is better than DONT b/c major lengths can be ambiguous with DONT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stayman is older and that's still pretty useful|pg||
nt|joest: I actually play "Multi-Landy" but the Landy part is good and that's all I'm promoting at the moment|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: There were 2 hands yesterday where the DONT ambiguity caused people to play a 4-2 instead of a 5-2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|joest: I agree Jan.  The ambiguity kills you|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I have no reasonable bid for the South hand. the nearest is X which shows 1 minor or both majors but this hardly qualifies|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A defence to 1NT that does not have 2@C as majors is not worth playing imo|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h2|pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I disagree Roland I mutch prefer Asptro|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's why Capp is useless too|pg||
pc|d8|nt|paulhac:  I still have the X in reserve to show both majors (but I should be 5-5)|pg||
nt|joest: how to use double is also a critical decision|pg||
nt|joest: as you watch more and more 'upgrades' on thirteen counts you have to worry more than you used to that you are getting stolen|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: Most of the tables have finished. For the last round, we'll have Shugart vs. Kwiecien. The second session starts at 5:00 Pacific time. We'll try to get you Swiss standings as well ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: as Reisinger this evening.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5:00 Pacific = in 2 hours from now|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Of course if they see it making then laziness may produce +1|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: We'll have Andy Robson & Rita Shugart here against Smirnov & Piekarek|pg||
nt|Vugraphu3: The Polish pair isn't here yet, so I just guessed who'd be East and who'd be West - I'm probably wrong, usually am :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Jan you are usually expert when it comes to 50% guesses|pg||
