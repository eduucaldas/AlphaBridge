nt|othered1: Hi, Kit|pg||
nt|kit: I think his best bet is win ace of hearts, AK of clubs, heart pitch, club ruff (hope they split), ruff diamond in dummy, a good club pitching last heart|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|fifee: Kaminski team may try some underdog tactics|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: what do you suggest|pg||
nt|fifee: pushing harder, looking for swings|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i think the opposite|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: pushing harder is too hard, you have to be playing well|pg||
nt|fifee: 67 imps down going into the final. no small margin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so instead underbid and pray for bad breaks|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: yes but needs to ruff both diamonds|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|fifee: when he ruffs the 3rd @C, it establishes the @Cs for pitches|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|fifee: he then ruffed a @D, and a @H with a higher trump forcing the @SJ from south hand|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2C|nt|ritong: drawing the @s ace was a curious idea|pg||
nt|ritong: he played his part for the @d A, but even so, keeping A5 of @ss would work|pg||

nt|ritong: when responder has 5 @ss, he simply repeats them|pg||

pc|c5|nt|ritong: especially facing a 1@h opening|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|othered1: Rebidding 5 mediocre @S won't be good if partner's allowed to rebid 1N with @S stiff|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: it is interesting for our advanced/intermediate spectators , woolsey:) for them, bidding a new suit says first one is longer|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kit: partner will never rebid 1NT with a stiff spade after opening 1@H -- he must have a minor to bid|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||

nt|kit: declarer easily has 5 spade tricks, 2 club tricks, 1 heart, 1 diamond.  He can get a tenth trick by leading up to queen of diamonds ....|pg||
nt|kit: But if he tries to get it by ruffing clubs in hand, things may go badly for him|pg||

mb|5H|nt|othered1: rkc in @C?|pg||
mb|p|mb|7C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Looks like they will get to 6@C, which is a good contract -- but could lose 13 IMPs if other table shoots out grand|pg||

nt|ritong: which is precisely what happened|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Passell: "we don't get our clubs in as early as other people"|pg||

nt|othered1: And they've managed to get the right hand in dummy, where the defense can be sure to take their tricks, if they get to defend 5@S|pg||
nt|ritong: limited to eight playing tricks?|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@C is Precision -- we've been watching these guys for several sets -- but it's still outside the normal range for the opening for  most of us humans|pg||
nt|kit: I don't thinhk Hamilton will quit -- but then what will E-W do?|pg||
