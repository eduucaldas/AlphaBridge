nt|bridge_one: 15 balanced - West could choose also 1nt open, so 3Nt can be possible in other room|pg||
nt|calabres: the x of 3@D will sugest long diamonds for eventual defense|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Santos did not think he had an automatic 2@S in the other room. I think he has|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S, when possible, it is a great bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: take level at opps, no space to bid |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some distinguish between a pre-emptive raise (2@S) and a constructive one (2@H)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hard bid for west - 12 hcp, but probably they use also weak dbl (only with good distribution)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|calabres: N is the President of Portuguese Bridge Federation|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3@S is a surprise. may be they use this bid without @h(otherwise DBL takeout)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think the hand is worth 3@S. Too flat and a wasted @SQ|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|patricck: also, no aces makes the hand much less attractive|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 5 @D are very much with this layout|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pessoa thinks he has a red two-suiter by the look of it|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|fpg: .|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think they arn't sure about the means of 3@s - not easy for a pir to arrange all bid !|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But they are a very experienced partnership|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|bridge_one: yes, they are on eof the best portugese pair|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|patricck: 5@D is surely too much here, but declarer can go 2 off and still get a push board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if he guesses @CQ, he is a trick short because of the 4-1 trump split|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Automatic trump switch now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|bridge_one: guessing all can make 5@d|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
nt|calabres: 3 @S could be to ask for a @S stopper to try 3N, not sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not on a trump switch|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need to see all cards ...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|d2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|patricck: North has enought to open the bidding with AKJ@S and QJ@H, so no real reason to guess the Q@C|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bridge_one: can make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@d 4@D ?|pg||
nt|patricck: trump exit looked automatic there|pg||
nt|bridge_one: happen, but i am not sure - may be a mistake by operator|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The last trick did not make sense to me|pg||

nt|Walddk2: South ruffed with @D5 and declarer underruffed with the 4!? Please explain|pg||
nt|ritong: taken in speed?|pg||
nt|patricck: declarer was probably not expecting the ruff and called for the @D too quickly. That would not be a case where you could be allowed to change your call for unintended designation|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|dK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||

nt|daman: but he has to duck the @Hs twice|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

nt|daman: what would we bid with the West hand?|pg||
nt|xenya: that's the question|pg||

nt|april7: 3@C or2NT for minors!|pg||

mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: which 1@S would confirm anyway even if it could have been 3+|pg||

nt|tweety1: Actually, If there is no blood, It is a good match they say... Who care:)  Kibz want blood:)|pg||
nt|haans: we are here to see blood :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hard to reach 7 clubs|pg||
nt|tweety1: hah|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: tricky hand for east after the 1nt opener|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully they will find out they are missing 2 aces |pg||
nt|april7: 3@S opening, hard to balance for EW vuln.and its ok anyway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@h is a good grand |pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 @H best here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: to show a spade-diamond two-suiter he might have to transfer to spades first and then he never gets the suit lengths across|pg||
nt|sybarra: can transfer to spades, the bid @D over 2 @S andd3 !N |pg||
nt|tweety1: I thought I am the only Drakula|pg||
nt|haans: 6@C is hard|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: some people can transfer to diamonds then bid spades naturally|pg||
nt|sybarra: *then|pg||
nt|april7: let see whether they reach it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now VERY hard|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: I can do that   and appears to be what he is doing |pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps 3@S is better than 2@S but still looks ugly to me|pg||
nt|tweety1: cant find 7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What is 1 @D?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: missing the 9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. Same as 5@D. Need to find the Q@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  Notice how important is the @DQ|pg||
nt|granguru:  Not easy to see it during the bidding in a nat system|pg||
nt|mmmakela: some dbl|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: 3@D presumably shows enthusiasm for diamonds|pg||
nt|tweety1: I am open any bets|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bet no 6|pg||
nt|haans: some odds for 3nt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: being down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You can only handle @D 4-1 with the length in North|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: I would also know by my pard's bid whether pard has good @D's or not |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: down 1 on normal defense|pg||
nt|april7: 6 they will reach|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Difficult to value after a checkback 2@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u are|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: my pard and I use the "relay" suit for good @D's but all what the understandings are|pg||
nt|haans: again odds on 3nt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 clubs it will be my bet|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: this could get murky; which suit does 4@C agree?|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D |pg||
nt|daman: now another @H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: overcalls have no definite values|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but if W opens 1 @D as I would've then diff story|pg||
nt|haans: as it is not MP bidding clubs seems most logical|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: the XX is first round control |pg||
nt|athene: we can see it agrees diamonds but east might not be in on the joke :)|pg||
nt|chemical_b: hi Shirley, hi all :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  redouble shows @SA|pg||

nt|athene: you tend to get too high|pg||
nt|mmmakela: i won!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|haans: :(|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: 2 off now|pg||
nt|tweety1: Actually I open 2nt with E's hand  so tell all:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: right - as i suspected east thought 4@C agreed spades|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hagz: WOW|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: these "two suiter" auctions are real deathtraps without a lot of discussion|pg||
nt|granguru:  As said ..a tough hand to bid|pg||
nt|granguru:  to try with your favorite partner|pg||
nt|april7: if E had only 2 @S cards, then S goes down!|pg||
nt|april7: I mean in 7|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@S and 3@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so for the perfectionists: is 10 the right card to play? what u want to find out /deceive/? opposed to playing Q/J?|pg||

nt|athene: it's not as though west has @DKx, when he might well duck the @SK|pg||
nt|xenya: another solid game|pg||

nt|tweety1: action?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer was pretty sure where the @SA was|pg||

pc|h7|nt|hawe45:  9 easy tricks here|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|daman: good auction|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the destructing value of 1 NT is underapreciated, IMHO any excuse to open 1 NT is a good one!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: this is interesting for north actually|pg||
nt|athene: if he puts declarer with the @SK, he might try and play against dummy|pg||
nt|athene: giving declarer the @SK is his ninth trick|pg||
pc|h5|nt|april7: take K and finesse in @C!!!|pg||
nt|daman: impossible for this to make|pg||
nt|april7: but its a good try|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: he might play his partner for the @HK and @CQ and exit a diamond|pg||
nt|daman: maybe if S blocks the @Hs|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: admittedly that gives declarer very little for his negative double|pg||
nt|haans:  some blood|pg||
pc|cT|nt|daman: I would have played the @H Jack|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|april7: N will not lead ace after @C Q, but still not possible to make|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: but sometimes your only chance to beat a contract is to play declarer for not having his bid :)|pg||

pc|s5|nt|april7: S can't make a mistake!!!|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps just a gentle 3@D |pg||
nt|haans: 6@S or 6@C|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: now south will probably just pass it|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S 1 down and 5@D at least 1 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: and e/w have wrong colors to come in |pg||
nt|xenya: now do you double or bid 2@D as W?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: the hearts are a worry for 3nt when partner has ten cards in the pointed suits|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: S will do it for him|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra2: its his only chance |pg||
nt|athene: when you know declarer has 5-5 in spades and diamonds, perhaps you should lay down the @HA on opening lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N's bidding maybe shd tip off to pull, I don't know|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|athene: but of course there are many layouts where that would be catastrophic - @HKx with declarer, or ruff and @HKQ set up in dummy for club pitches, maybe|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: 5@D by W beacuse |pg||

nt|rodal f: 19HP at NS but best spot on|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: @C void|pg||
nt|xenya: all he had to do was place W with both @HA and Q -- very likely on the auction|pg||
nt|daman: exactly|pg||
nt|mmmakela: must have a very strong argument to lead from 1 of those|pg||
mb|1D|nt|april7: W will probably X, which is wrong imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: N finding the opening bid "interesting"|pg||
nt|daman: they can make 5@D  EW|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: EW might end up in 4@SX|pg||
nt|daman: but    NS have the @S suit|pg||
nt|daman: and will push the envelope|pg||
nt|xenya: S should invite now i think|pg||
nt|daman: for sure|pg||
mb|2H|nt|daman: some would bid 4@D|pg||
nt|xenya: with 2@C or something|pg||
nt|april7: 10 tricks in @S also except on @C lead and @H back and so on |pg||
nt|rodal f: If 2@D was inv. min E realy would have had a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: now 3 nt from S?|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: i don't like to splinter with only 3 trumps|pg||

pc|h3|nt|athene: just cash three hearts and three diamonds|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: and then exit a small spade at the end and force him to lead into the trumps|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mmmakela: I have a good theory about prebalances; ask me at mmmakela@@yahoo.com|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: when you have a big trump holding but no shortage, it's often bad news in defence|pg||
nt|athene: because declarer if he reads the position can cash lots of side-suit winners and you end up with nothing but trumps|pg||
nt|athene: these clever sort of plays abound in textbooks|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: perhaps if south had doubled, it might have tipped declarer off to the trump break (what else can south hand?)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|april7: in all those cases trump play is most efective, so S should have switched to trump second trick|pg||

mc|10|nt|athene: his 2@S in a forcing auction, not giving partner a chance to double 2@D, did show a weak hand|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H is a good stop i think, even though 10 tricks can be made|pg||
nt|april7: E should go 1 down on good defence, that means N should play the 9, because S has a natural trump trick anywaybut E must play trumps carefully, not Q or J at first round|pg||

pc|h4|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|athene: more likely they had to invent a club suit as otherwise it's hard to develop the bidding|pg||

nt|rodal f: Last board up by this evening. Turney start at 12.30CET tomorrow for 2 more rounds|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: 3 nt not worst contract in the world either |pg||
nt|mmmakela: seems this needs THE lead to beat it|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT is cold, and might be bid directly|pg||

mb|3N|nt|xenya: this might be interesting|pg||
nt|april7: did W play the 5 from J52?|pg||
nt|ritong: ole|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: me too as we all in the panel|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  With a @D-lead against 3 NT, you are forced to play North  for the @S Queen - and succeed|pg||

nt|ritong: declarer should draw three @hs, in case someone shows out|pg||
nt|ritong: that would severely impact the @s break odds|pg||
