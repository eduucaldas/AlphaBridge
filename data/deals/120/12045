nt|daman: what would we do with the East hand?   is it worth an invitation?|pg||
nt|april7: starting with a partscore in @C,only 2,or in @H by W making 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: typical agreesive modern auction EW will do well to get to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW stroing club, if I remember correctly |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hassett was in a very strong position after the first stanza, up by 51 IMPs, but they lost all of their advantage against Crouch during the second|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk4: http://www.ebu.co.uk/events/?eventid=12  for standings after 6 rounds of 7|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|garnetts: When you have opps who are known for agressive tactics there is but one answer--return the compliment|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: I think West should double 1NT--three hearts notwithstanding--he can bid 2@D over 2@C and get over the value of his hand|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bridge_one: However West don't have a efficace bid, having only 3@h, and Qxx in @s - i would choose 2@D, but pass is a possible way|pg||

nt|daman: NS will wend their way to 4@S on this|pg||
nt|daman: pretty straightforward|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: I think the matter was that west didnt bid 5D to save 320 points|pg||

mb|2D|an|ask|nt|mdgraham: http://www.ebu.co.uk/events/?eventid=12  for standings |pg||

nt|lestergold: hard for hasset to compete at these colours|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many use super acceptation with 4 cards - here guess to bid only 2@H|pg||

mb|4S|nt|lestergold: 3C by e/w makeable not laydown tho|pg||

nt|chick: I used to play weak NTs but people began to find good ways to punish it, so I went back to strong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some use the step2 to the transfer (so 2@S here)  |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Other scores: Small 46 - 45 Rosen; Hassett 65 - 14 Irens; Dhondy 32 - 35 Hackett|pg||

nt|lestergold: Gold wasnt having any of this nonsense|pg||
nt|lestergold: he heard the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East have a good hand, the game depending on hight cards in West|pg||
pc|c2|nt|garnetts: There 1NT is 14-16 I suppose?   With this very suitable 14 I would have bid 4@S but I like to be agressive |pg||
pc|c7|nt|april7: right lead against this kind of bidding|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn: well, if you do not want the opponents to bid nonsense contracts, you had better make sure you beat them|pg||
nt|dburn: and this opening lead will not have that effect|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is sadly true|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would expect more from East--did West upgrade his 1NT?  (15-17)  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 9 in @D 3th, so can make 4@s|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, the double might cause declarer to do something fanicful in the play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but down if east play finesse at the 9@d|pg||
nt|dburn: since he has to negotiate the diamond suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: like now:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade lead against 6C Hans?|pg||
nt|april7: its not so useless now because of bad break in @C|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: might be awkward now though|pg||
nt|haans: think 1nt will cost|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South won't know his @CQxx gives SIX tricks in the suit |pg||
nt|lestergold: I suspect N/S have some kit here|pg||
nt|haans: yes spade lead is not good|pg||
nt|daman: useless is not a word I would use to describe any Ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no double this time|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the worst distribution and force for East after passed hand :) 2Nt seam the best reply|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: perhaps fortunate that @hK is well placed - this was not the right side to play the hand from|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@s will perhaps calm N down|pg||
nt|haans: 6@C played by North spade lead harder to find|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bridge_one: East can establish 2@s, so np to make 3Nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence cannot establish the diamonds and the KH no time|pg||
nt|lestergold: and declarer has nine tricks without the qH|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I admire South's restraint. He has obviously seen North's opening bids before|pg||
nt|peachy: very nice|pg||
pc|hK|nt|garnetts: Can anyone tell me what was wrong with the J@D?  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: was thinking that - odd to lead 4th from J109xx|pg||
nt|haans: @H lead not an option|pg||
nt|april7:  6 @C a very good contract, but doesn't work because of bad break|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|lestergold: not textbook for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: well wont lead a singleton might be reluctant to bang an ace down and trump leads against small slams are not usually effective|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe Towsend felt important to tell pard that lead was from length with entries|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: thk|pg||
nt|garnetts: Was wondering if I had been missing something for years---don't all yell a brain at me |pg||
nt|garnetts: Bet he plays the K@H |pg||
nt|bridge_one: finding Qx in @d at the partner, and A8xx at opps, the lead J lose one time - alternative, finding 8x in @D at the partner |pg||
nt|haans: yes spade it will be |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: they are playing a strong jump shift by responder, a rarity these days|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: you were half right|pg||
nt|dburn: well, leading low will cost if declarer has all of AKQ8 with four-card length in one hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: i expect so|pg||
nt|lestergold: more by elimination than anything else|pg||
nt|haans: good slam|pg||
nt|chick: J984 isn't much better to lead from than the other choices though|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep has a lot of chances|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: interesting hand, 6@S works easily in 5-2 fit and 6 @H in 4-4 fit problematic!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: should make - dummy can throw a club on the @HK |pg||
nt|haans: we have all done worse|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was tough for sure sometimes you have anace and king to cash or else but that wopuld be a bit of an insult to this partnership|pg||
nt|chick: yes, I don't think the A was that much worse than spade from J98x, just unlucky this time|pg||
nt|lestergold: they bid their way there carefully and were not likelyto have two quick diamond losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: I beg to disagree on that|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: was possibly down 2, now maybe 1|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now we may have trouble|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D must have been a GF relay of some sort|pg||
nt|daman: or maybe it showed @Hs|pg||

nt|daman: I agree with you Avram|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: I was off by 1...|pg||
nt|haans: jump to 6@C did mean i have @D covered|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A bit conservative by both?|pg||
nt|april7: E doesn't know about the strong @S suit, so has to give up|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: I'll back making, if he doesn't lose too many trumps too early|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as long as clubs are 3-2, he can handle 3-1 spades  |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course they have guaranteed diamond cover thats the point|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may have needed a heart switch there, rather than the club|pg||
nt|chick: hadn't they guaranteed cover in all suits?|pg||
nt|haans: 4@C que no @D que|pg||
nt|haans: sry 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but in the cas o dims east knows that the cover is seond round - whereas in spades cover may be only first round while still holding the ace of dims|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: declarer having a big think now|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are times for leading an unsupported ace against a small slam and times when its ill advisewd|pg||

nt|lestergold: long thinks against gold are not winning tactics|pg||
nt|lestergold: he specialises in mind reading|pg||
nt|chick: we'll see who chickens out first :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: 4@S may be tough, even if they don't get @H ruff.|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has to ruff a dim and then has toplay a club away from q then left with heart loser at the end|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh hes gone for a real chain jerker|pg||
nt|dburn: or perhaps he has just bid his longest suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: sadly not |pg||
nt|garnetts: but it is quite safe --he might even make it |pg||
nt|lestergold: no perhaps about it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H is a tactic bid, waiting ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: For what exactly|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h is an attempt to play in two hearts - there isn't anything tactical about it|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this could be passed out and inm the fullness of time Hassett will be more delighted than he may immnediately realise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if west keep same cards without A in @d 2@H is made !|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if West has shown diamonds and spades, he doesn't have much of a problem here, imho - either 2@H is to play or it isn't|pg||
nt|lestergold: for that observation Geogio u get a medal|pg||
nt|daman: East will get involved|pg||
nt|april7: they don't play it|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bridge_one: 2@H to play, ok, but impossible the partner could bid anythink with A in @S and A in @D|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear to what extent this auction is forcing on North|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold's turn to tank|pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose North has to bid now |pg||
nt|mdgraham: if indeed it is forcing at all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Doubt South will go on over 5@C - he will be more afraid of 6@C making|pg||
nt|lestergold: i may have missed something please explain David|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: so 2@H is a tactical bid, hoping opps bid anything to can rebid 3@h after|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think so|pg||
mb|2N|nt|dburn: even if West did have both @sA and @dA, 4@h might still not make if he had a heart void|pg||
nt|garnetts: Double should promise another bid most of the time --unless they bid game in my view|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n meaning i dont know what to bid but i have something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting - why not pass 2NT? |pg||
nt|dburn: 2NT is natural, and Hassett should have passed it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because thik South wouldn't pass 2Nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not as if yuo don't have a good lead...|pg||
nt|othered1: did the double really accomplish anything?|pg||
nt|haans: looks like easy slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 2NT? an unlucky bid though!!!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I dont mind the 2@C George but I would rebid 3@S with the W hand|pg||
nt|daman: I would bail to 3@D if I was West|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well we didnt predict this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, so ou can defend 3NT instead|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he will pass this|pg||
nt|lestergold: now surelty pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however better to counterplay 3Nt that 2Nt :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: well I'll be ............................|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hornswoggled?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem is: West keep a @h or he is void ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not unreasonable for towsend to think Gold has a heart guard here|pg||
nt|dburn: it doesn't much matter, since East is on lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it got hearts into the picture, I suppose |pg||
nt|othered1: and then partner waits for additional definition at a high leve.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I must say  that 2@c is rather modest in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Good lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: so e/w make 3N and score 500|pg||
nt|haans: irens now in lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: no 4@D cue|pg||
nt|daman: I never thought of that      that would work for sure|pg||
nt|daman: this will not be a success|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is not going to be a success!|pg||
nt|april7: enough Ks and Qs but aces are missing!!|pg||
nt|daman: but the auction seems OK for the most part    West is getting what he hoped for (5 @D tricks)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: but I wouldn't complain about any judgment on the way to the fine 5@C|pg||
nt|othered1: How would EW have played an immediate 3@C by west?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: defenders won't make @DA, tjough|pg||
nt|dburn: not quite - they can't cash that diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry make 2n score 400|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no, 8 tricks only, A in @d impossible to make for defence|pg||
nt|haans: 2 spade dummy reversal = 12|pg||

nt|mdgraham: no, 1200. Not a score you see every day|pg||
mb|5H|mb|5S|nt|garnetts: I agree Mike--rather a lucky make --but if they bid it ...........|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C alerted - anyone know what means ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: nothing written down so cannot say|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like a sort of super swiss --little unusual but workable |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: just a nod between the players|pg||
nt|bridge_one: balance raise to 4@h, no sgl/void and no 5@d told a kibitz|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: there you are|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i suppose was this after the long think by East|pg||
nt|garnetts: if its a splinter ir will put east off--and west will need to visit an occulist |pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: that's one downside of jumping all the way to 3@S with a fit - it makes subsequent biding murky |pg||
nt|chick: why cue the @DA, he knows pard cannot cue hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 6@C and 6@H possible and they may be pushed into one or other|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 6@H missed|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: i agree with East - not easy to find the cards to make slam here |pg||
nt|garnetts: If my partner though for ages and bid 4@H in this situation it would annoy me |pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 1NT-2@h-2NT shows a fit, you have more space|pg||
nt|peachy: murky for opps too |pg||
nt|lestergold: Gopld with a q and q J outside clubs will not be the slightest interested|pg||
nt|mdgraham: second suit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: 3@D = game invit |pg||
nt|mdgraham: North could still have 4/5 diamonds|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: Because you can now be fairly sure a slam has chances because of your hard values |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: 4@c was explained at the opening lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and you are barred from going on, ethically - not that that would stop some people |pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: or less in clubs|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: Townsend had higher hopes in mind|pg||
nt|chick: it can't be a help suit game try, because he bid 4@S anyway.   I suppose it could be a help suit slam try ....|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chick: a lot of interesting possible lines here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|garnetts: thats true--but here I suspect the police would arrest you and a higher court sentence you to 4@H |pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would try 4@d leaving at my p the chance to bid over 4@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was a game try in practice but the subsequent bid showed he was slamming|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chick: E has declined to prevent spade ruffs, instead setting up his own trump trick|pg||

nt|lestergold: I mean the sort of routine bid which is normally a try/invite but on next round u show that in this case it was more than that|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mcarroll: The weak-weak 2!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: but p jumps to 4@S on general value|pg||

nt|mdgraham: art GF I think|pg||
nt|chick: One of my partners says, hold to 1 loser opposite 3 small in my hand.   Another says, any 2 honors or 4 cards is enough to go on.   Very different ideas about the meanings.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: 3N can make here if West picks the diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: time to overbid here 3n makes|pg||
nt|othered1: is there a specified response structure over 2@S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure Chick|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 3NT makes luckily on any lead |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: but it might go down on a @D finesse |pg||
nt|mdgraham: after @dQ-K-A, declarer may finesse the 8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 5@D and 5 controls many would choose to play game in this hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in East|pg||
nt|lestergold: vulnerbale its worth a shot not at this colour tho|pg||
nt|garnetts: To be honest I have no idea how to play the diamonds---but leading the j@D is best might get a reaction or a tell |pg||
nt|mcarroll: @Dten lrad would be inspired|pg||
