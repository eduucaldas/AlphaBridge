nt|Walddk2: Pass or bid with the South cards?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why are you not playing karen?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Yes, basically natural systems - the most exciting thing E/W was Flannery and N/S some strange 2-suiters over opening 1NT by the opponents|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: if East passes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I pass|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cards are reasonably favourable and game is a huge longshot|pg||

pc|d2|nt|kareno: No surprise at all.  So I assume they are in game?|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: discussions over, screen comes down|pg||
nt|kareno: Good morning from Las Vegas.  I watched the Lynch team earlier this week and they were playing superbly.|pg||
nt|kareno: And of course, the Robinson team is a powerhouse so this should be an interesting match.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Ozdil still getting his bidding box in order|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: Good morning John :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphu2: Good morning Karen and spectators|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@s is almost as good as a finesse and will be tempting to south.|pg||
nt|mcphee: Kaminski a previous winner of this event|pg||
nt|mcphee: bid or pass Henri?|pg||
nt|ritong: 1NT|pg||
nt|mcphee: me also|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphu2: amos (south) never passes if he can help it|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rain2:  Hi, please welcome Paul Thurston himself as commentator for a while :)|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps a somewhat light 2@C considering the vulnerability, but you want to interfere at the 2-level over 1@C whenever possible|pg||
nt|kareno: Practical bid by north.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: can't read all the details but suggests 2major may have been NF from Robinson|pg||
nt|thurston: hello all|pg||
mb|p|pc|s9|nt|kareno: Paul :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: landing from the other side,  will it make a difference?|pg||

pc|s2|nt|kareno: Rain :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Boyd: 2nd/4th leads, UDCA, regular smith|pg||
nt|kareno: Space consuming |pg||
nt|thurston: that's quite a vul 2@C overcall by Mr Lair - his partner seems to have been expecting more|pg||
nt|xenya: this won't be easy however|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Ozdil stroking his whiskers.  Lair tosses him a stick of gum.|pg||
nt|kareno: Maybe that's to preclude comments on his overcall :)|pg||
nt|thurston: an extra King or 2 would be preferred to gum|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Yonatan Alon|pg||

pc|dK|nt|mcphee: yes|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||

pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: lamed I  mean|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kareno: I'm not sure I'd start that way but perhaps he was looking for Kx of spades in east.|pg||
nt|kareno: He'll be surprised by west's lack of values in his suits.|pg||
nt|kareno: And this one will be counted in 100's.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Boyd fingers DK then leans back|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Boyd is a very thoughtful player.  Kibitzed him some yesterday in their QF.  Taciturn especially in comparison to Robinson|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: now Boyd handles @CQ and has another think|pg||
nt|kareno: In the CR it was also notrump but played by east.  A nice pickup for Robinson.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: @D K now beats the contract regardless of what N might have|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: he was leaning|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Here's Arnie Fisher - not to be kept out twice.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, it looks a bit double dummy, but over 1@C a 1@S bis is v often a 5 card suit & the raise is more encouraging|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: the par contract|pg||
nt|tejjyid: very surprised north didn't X 2@D for T/O with the 3rd @S|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: Boyd asks about the club break, Ozdil shows 3 fingers|pg||
nt|sybarra: some 4 sp +1 for n/s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: depends on the opening lead|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sybarra: maybe only 4 |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Another example in favor of the Just Bid the Game and Let Them Defend strategy|pg||
nt|ritong: any other than a @c = 12 tricks|pg||

nt|kareno: Which is to say?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4 card major, 5 card minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Robinson never looks comfortable, twisting his neck, rubbing his scalp, etc.|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Lair requests water from kibitzer who obliges|pg||

mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|othered1: If that's an opening bid and raise, south's 4N is very aggressive.  Good type of hand for weak NT|pg||

mb|4S|nt|kareno: I play that 3@h as a two-way bid; either invitational to game OR a five-level drive.  I play 4@h is simply the game value splinter bid.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Say you get a spade lead|pg||

pc|s3|nt|kareno: It's just 52-48 after one round of clubs so any little indication can change those odds.|pg||

mc|11|nt|daman: ciao everyone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this one was an exact tossup mathematically i believe|pg||
nt|kareno: 52-48 for the drop.|pg||
nt|kareno: Tiny bit for the possible longer diamonds in east.  Pretty much a tossup.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: less a bit of vacant places for the 6/5 @D disto|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no karen, not if you assume diamonds 65|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that leaves identical number of slots|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: We'll start the fourth quarter shortly after the other table finishes. If the two matches are starting at the same time, we'll show you the closer one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can hope they reach 7s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, it's all happened - see everybody soon|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thks for coming to watch|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes why down 2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jan, really down 2?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: At the 3/4 in Lynch-Robinson, the score is 115-95 in favor of Lynch. Robinson picked up 23 on the last two boards, beating 3N on 47 and bidding and making 7@c on 48|pg||

nt|ritong: talk about a tornado|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: robinson's trump lead gained 1 imp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I believe play will resume after a short break|pg||
mb|2C|an|STR ART F|mb|2D|nt|kareno: Roland :)  |pg||
nt|mcphee: 7@C my my|pg||
nt|othered1: Doesn't that make if you guess @C?|pg||
nt|ritong: oh yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: effortless|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzan: sry|pg||
nt|kareno: This one will be claimed pretty quickly.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: will S catch up after the pass?|pg||
nt|mcphee: well they guessed bad in the other room|pg||
nt|othered1: of course, you have to find @C first . . . |pg||
nt|othered1: In OR, south bid 3@C, apparantly naturally over 2@D.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Vugraphu2: yes, now should be very quick :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: in the other room they bid 3@C over 2@D|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Our estimate is a break for 10-15 mins, so don't go too far away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S ew is interesting, needs club leads to beat i think|pg||
nt|othered1: And, after east's vulnerable 2@D overcall, played east for @C shortness, I guess|pg||
nt|mcphee: that makes it easy to reach 7:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: makes a lot of sense, ed, we have to admit|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra2: am told that  "most are playing that pass over interference = cards and X = neg."|pg||
nt|mcphee: not here, so another big swing to end the 1/4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: same contract in the CR|pg||
nt|kareno: And that is why 4@h was such a good bid.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, see you later|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: i will leave table open for a bit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks all|pg||
nt|kareno: See you soon!!|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: back soon...|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|mcphee: very difficult to go down in 6|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ritong: if 4@c is a long suit, i find 6@c a bit lazy|pg||
nt|ritong: 5NT would look more like it, imo|pg||
nt|mcphee: i agree|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
mc|12|nt|mcphee: 5NT asking partner for the KQ@C|pg||
nt|ritong: or !Kxxxxx|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: ok, we'll be back very soon|pg||
nt|mcphee: sure looks right to me|pg||
