nt|davidstern: Hmmm three 8-0 fits - normal hand|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|3S|nt|davidstern: In 'normal bridge' you pick up the West hand and lick your lips thiking of good things. In Goulash you pick it up and wonder how you can avoid triuble|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: This will make I think|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mug: 3NT bid more in hope than expectation, but this will be close|pg||
nt|davidstern: @HK, @C10 and diamond may make life difficult|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mug: @D2 could be an important card|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mug: ah yes I see, North just takes the first club and plays a diamond immediately|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s6|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|mug: now it's home|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yep all over |pg||
nt|mug: the low club wasn't best|pg||
nt|davidstern: I thought South had realised what was happening|pg||
nt|mug: @C10 and North could tuck dummy in with a spade|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes the low club muddied the otherwise clear waters|pg||
nt|mug: you sure he played the low club operator?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|hT|nt|roswolf: this makes now|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|davidstern: On the hand where they bid 7@D, in the CR South opened 4@S pass pass and 7@D by east all pass|pg||
nt|mug: East considering whether North had all five diamonds, in which case he has to finesse|pg||
nt|davidstern: So that will be a flat board|pg||
nt|vugraphzza: I do sure|pg||
nt|davidstern: Unlike this one which will be 13 to Estonia|pg||
nt|mug: a good year for Estonian bridge, finalists in the Bonn Nations Cup, and also in the NN Cup|pg||
nt|mug: different team though I think|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|mug: ah, I'm told Sester and Levenko were in Bonn too|pg||

nt|sybarra: might be interesting at BAM |pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mug: hello again|pg||
nt|shevek: hello everyone, this is going to be fun :)|pg||
nt|shevek: hello again , welcome to the house of horrors :)|pg||
nt|mug: good morning|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: hi  )|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hi guys !Q |pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh my goodness.  An actual fit!|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back to finals of goulash |pg||
nt|sybarra: thiks is goulash tourney,  and systems adjusted to recognize such |pg||
mb|2D|nt|mug: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Tom |pg||
nt|mug: hi Denis|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello Denis |pg||
nt|mug: sorry I can't be here this year but this is the next best thing|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Welcome all :)|pg||
nt|shevek: hi Denis|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: we will lots of wild hands  |pg||
nt|sybarra: as in this one |pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: E probably not really pleased with that lead |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: good morning Shirley!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the "leaping bids"  will start soon |pg||
nt|sybarra: starting out "normally" |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes not too unusual|pg||
nt|mug: problem is that South has opened quite light, North may need some restraining|pg||
nt|sybarra: put leash around his neck?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: This is the semifanal of NN-CUP-2009|pg||
nt|shevek: in OR west bought it in 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: You can find the results here: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
nt|mug: 4NT now to show the diamonds?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Zmud and Balicki have won this tourney many times (but not last year)  |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: hi All :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mug: this is Goulash from moscow, mixture of IMP and BAM scoring|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is interesting i was once told when in doubt bid game instead of slam and partscore instead of game when hands were goulashed|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
nt|sybarra: how do they score it? |pg||
nt|mug: noone's going to be leaping too high here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: we play patton|pg||
nt|mug: West will probably settle for an invitational bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and Tuszinski is 10th ranked player in Poland  (no slouch) |pg||
nt|sybarra: Balicki we think is celebrating wifes birthday  |pg||
nt|sybarra: all the "gossip" I can give you |pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: no X  lets not give the  hand away |pg||
nt|mug: South will sign off, void in partner's second suit is not good |pg||
nt|mug: quite right shirley, double of 4@C would be criminal, they're all much too canny for that|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7@ds might be a touch better than defending 4@s.|pg||
nt|mug: Sester was speechless, so am I now|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: at goulash doubles are for blood|pg||
nt|shevek: even if before length|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: thought he might crash into 4 @S |pg||
nt|mug: partner is almost certain to be void in spades after 2@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: might as well be in 4 @S if you are at the 4 level |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is Patton scoring |pg||
nt|sybarra: every board is 2-0,1-1 or 0-2, then they add for the total of imps and get the vp |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: probably a sound start|pg||
nt|mug: to be honest I think 4@S was a wild overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: gm Denis |pg||
nt|sybarra: a brutal hand to begin with |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: this is a final of the goulash tournament in Moscow|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes folks it is 609 am for me |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: the final consists of the 2 segments (5 boards in each segment)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: you should expect two trump losers with the broken spade suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 3NT asking for another suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Traian Chira|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: is that where "we" want to be?|pg||
nt|mug: very far away|pg||
nt|sybarra: so does E lead a @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or more passive @D? |pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: losing 2@H and 2 @S?|pg||
nt|mug: must try to give partner a ruff somewhere|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to be @C |pg||
nt|sybarra: Nico, did you say 20 pt vp |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: I'm afraid no|pg||
nt|bebechira: hello everybody...and hello Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Traian |pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: 20-10 to 10-10|pg||
nt|sybarra: and N doesnt have a H! to lead |pg||
nt|shevek: Estonia is leading 13-7 after the 1st segment|pg||
pc|cK|nt|shevek: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
nt|mug: personally at Goulash I like to show both suits with one bid, opening or overcalling|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzzb: the current score of this match is 11:9|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d7|nt|mug: North is in a lot of pain|pg||
pc|s2|nt|shevek: well, north would have done better (maybe) to pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Luks has just tried to escape|pg||
nt|shevek: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bebechira: these goulash tournaments are fantastic !|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is 6 am for me  I wanted to see the final |pg||
nt|bebechira: Zmudzinski-Tuszinski ....interesant pertnership|pg||
nt|sybarra: is Zmud the same as the one who plays interenatioanally ?   cant remember his usual parrd's name |pg||
nt|bebechira: Balicki|pg||
nt|sybarra: right |pg||
nt|sybarra: I have operated when they were at the table |pg||
nt|bebechira: yes...very famous partnership|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Balicki is enjoying the birthday of his wife as far as I know )|pg||
nt|sybarra: makes sense|pg||
nt|bebechira: they came to Australia for the NOT 2 years ago|pg||
nt|sybarra: they were in the USA of our Nationals in AUg. |pg||
nt|bebechira: fantastic players|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: should you double in principle most contracts?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mug: not necessarily Geoff|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought he might  try ace and a @H?  now maybe |pg||
nt|roswolf: yup cant see too many trcks|pg||
nt|mug: now is good|pg||
nt|mug: North would like to duck @H3 but not possible :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|sQ|nt|bebechira: good defence by Adam... |pg||
nt|bebechira: and very good initial pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: and notice N did not try to r|pg||
nt|sybarra: *rescue|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.msc.com.pl/cezar/?s=&mycl=0&tmt=4&p=43 3rd and 10th best from Poland :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: the moment Adam passed they were in trouble|pg||
nt|sybarra: W= 3rd and E=10th |pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: draw dummys trump yes seems best|pg||
nt|shevek: there are of course different rules for this game|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|shevek: - only five-card suits may be bid|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|d8|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sA|mc|8|nt|shevek: - 12-15 hcp balanced hands (IF you get one!) are passed rather than opened|pg||

nt|roswolf: 7@C in the other room was wild imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: imHo|pg||
mb|p|mb|7C|nt|mug: my battery is about to run out so thanks everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Oops|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|davidstern: Have a good day papa|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: double is too obvious|pg||
nt|davidstern: With 3 boards scored and Estonia leading this set by 18 and the last by 9 it would not be too premature to suggest that they are likely winners of the NN Cup|pg||
nt|davidstern: with Board a Match scoring doubling is important|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|pc|h2|nt|davidstern: Half the VPs on Board a match and half on imps|pg||

nt|sybarra: E hates his hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: you can find the current results of the tournament using the following link: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
nt|shevek: 11 card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: double in front of partner should be a very firm message|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah a 4nt bid for north|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont think in goulash that is right  |pg||
nt|sybarra: and 6 @C here for e/w |pg||
nt|shevek: did I tell you Shirley, Roland has prizes for the commentators who guess the final contract :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: no,  didnt get the notice |pg||
mb|4C|nt|shevek: reminds me of a story Ron Klinger once told:|pg||
nt|santyclz: Don't lead a @s.|pg||
nt|shevek: when he started playing bridge in his uni years his mates set him up|pg||
nt|shevek: dealt him 13 spades; in 2nd seat he thought would be a good idea to pass,|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: yesterday we could see 12 card suit )|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: how ever it is good for 6 @D  little does he know  |pg||
nt|mug: he hates his hand but it is quite useful for his partner|pg||
nt|roswolf: well east has some offence|pg||
nt|shevek: since faking a sacrifice might attract a double (and rdbl)|pg||
nt|bebechira: open room played 3nt.... this contract should be banned in goulash tournaments|pg||
nt|sybarra: its more than just the BAM,  they also IMP the board also   |pg||
nt|sybarra: this may go 6 @C  now |pg||
mb|7C|nt|sybarra: wow!!!  look at N hand!!!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and who need BW anyway??|pg||
nt|mug: East will bid 7@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Nord has an ordinary hand in Goulash )|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe should have walked it up?|pg||
nt|mug: creepy crawly doesn't work in my experience|pg||
nt|sybarra: you have played there,  so you should know |pg||
nt|mug: and anyway North is far from guaranteed to make 7@C|pg||
nt|mug: he needs South to have @SA, and to avoid a spade ruff|pg||
nt|mug: this way East is put to the test|pg||
nt|sybarra: and that is a consideration  (the ruff that is) |pg||
nt|mug: BIG consideration Shirley|pg||
nt|roswolf: but even goulashes obey the laws of probability - dont they?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Easts pard did not announce a great hand! |pg||
nt|sybarra: actually geoffrey from watching,  they are very disciplined  |pg||
nt|mug: but West's bid showed a long suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: or commenting last couple of years,  (I should say) |pg||
nt|roswolf: would a prolonged pause and pass impose any ethical problems on west|pg||
nt|mug: yes you're right Shirley, the best players are very conservative and very disciplined|pg||
nt|mug: good to use the jump shift to show a solid suit, setting trumps|pg||
nt|shevek: BUT they all passed so he threw his cards to be redealt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: 12 cards in club and Ace of spade )|pg||
nt|shevek: when his partner asked him "what did you have?" he said "only 10 points!|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: likely 6@S BY NORTH?|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually overstated that one,  6 @D does not make |pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: will the 10-card suit holder buy the contract??|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lol!|pg||
nt|mug: now South can cue @SA and North can jump to 5@C to say that he needs the red aces|pg||
nt|mug: they do it differently|pg||
mb|d|nt|mug: EW can make a few tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@s all pass?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think e-w can make 10 tricks in either pointed suit.|pg||
nt|shevek: no prize for that Joe|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh dear |pg||
nt|shevek: is this your prediction?  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: a specs suggests 7@c by south - too late for that :)|pg||
nt|shevek: you have to predict the final contract :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5@dx.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: partnership trust is very important|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow!!! |pg||
nt|sybarra: restraint |pg||
nt|roswolf: HMMMM unexpected|pg||
nt|mug: I think South owed North 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|sybarra: S owed something |pg||
nt|sybarra: lost that one |pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: good bidding by all|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have a way to say it in US,   "this tourney is a hoot"  (hoot= entertaining, fun etc) |pg||
nt|mug: certainly is|pg||
nt|mug: we did terribly but had a really great time last year|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump lead best|pg||
nt|mug: at the 5-level North was right to shut up shop, his suit is far from solid at this game|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: perhaps for 5this tourney only you should be allowed to bid at the 8 level as in the old days|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11 tricks on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont know how else to explain Patton |pg||
nt|sybarra: well there you go,  the "banned"  bid |pg||
nt|shevek: non-@h lead?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: would you do it again Tom?|pg||
nt|bebechira: :)|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: oh , this will go down on a @H lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: W fell to the @H lead since N bid his other suits |pg||
nt|sybarra: brilliant.....|pg||
nt|bebechira: i said ...it should be banned|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: incredible , 4@C is the max you can make|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: it looks like -3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mug: was planning to come this year but circs intervened|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bebechira: they should know they have very few chances for making 3nt |pg||
nt|shevek: only a revoke will save him|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mug: at least they didn't double 5@D although that probably won't help their score much|pg||
nt|santyclz: Right as usual|pg||
nt|shevek: when you don't have transportation to dummy, only chance is to endplay the opponents, BUT...|pg||
nt|sybarra: if S held Ax of sp...totally different story |pg||
nt|dan_hohor: you loose 2@H and a club   |pg||
nt|mwigor: 6@c makes on a non-@h lead|pg||
nt|shevek: 3NT also|pg||
nt|bebechira: :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzzb: it should go down|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: a 5NT Josephine would have done the job :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mug: the rest of my crew is playing|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: poor S doesnt have a club to lead :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: 7@c from the other table|pg||
nt|sybarra: other room almost walked it up |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes after a straightforward ordinary type auction|pg||
nt|mug: South should be DD here|pg||
nt|mug: his partner must have 12 clubs|pg||
nt|mug: hard to explain some of these calls|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mug: it won't matter, big winning board for his team|pg||
nt|mug: although a trick went there, poor defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: only -4|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@s maybe was a bad idea...|pg||
nt|mug: East must lead something red now|pg||
nt|shevek: south trusted pd|pg||
nt|mug: should find a winning lead, North did bid 3@S|pg||
nt|mug: but North didn|pg||
nt|mug: but South's AK are in North's void, what else has he got for partner?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Psychic q's are also fairly frequent in ghouly.|pg||
nt|shevek: rules of this game are completely different|pg||
nt|shevek: - 12-15 hcp balanced hands (IF you get one!) are passed rather than opened|pg||
nt|shevek: - preemptive openings are forbidden;|pg||
nt|shevek: i.e.  a high-level opening bid denotes the exact number of tricks the hand possesses|pg||
nt|shevek: - use of conventions is reduced to a minimum, as opponents will often interfere taking away the bidding space|pg||
nt|mug: actually the organisers allow any system you like Nicoleta|pg||
nt|shevek: - doubles behind the length are for penalties, where they would usually be for take out|pg||
nt|shevek: forcing pass too?|pg||
nt|mug: some pairs play very natural, others play very scientific|pg||
nt|shevek: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
nt|mug: that's part of the fun I think, trying out your new ideas against the other players' ideas|pg||
nt|mug: some pairs have very well worked out specialist Goulash systems|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: pairs who wants to get the money ))|pg||
nt|mug: we want to get the money one year too Denis, the problem is we're not good enough yet :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: last thing Zmud thought was they were missing ace of trump |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: another @H and does E win and push it back?|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: any lead , cash A @S and then AK and a @C and the opps have to open the H . If you guess you may make 5|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  Josephine would have worked |pg||
mc|12|nt|sybarra: didnt have to |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: this can be too expensive|pg||

nt|sybarra: or when you thought you lost 16   you mates say  "push"  |pg||
nt|mug: you can do what you like Geoff|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w misfit n/s have spades played in say 6@C|pg||
nt|shevek: this year 16 teams entered the event|pg||
nt|shevek: http://www.nncup.org/page_07_e.htm|pg||
nt|shevek: stage 1 of Q they played in 4 groups, winners went to group A, losers to group B|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sybarra: last bd,  and we come back in about  5 min  |pg||
nt|sybarra: or so |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: we will continue in about 10 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: but I think psyching would be foolish|pg||
nt|shevek: with repechage matches to get back in the QF:|pg||
nt|shevek: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
nt|shevek: prize money US$9,000|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: we glad to see your team in Moscow :)|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: ty all, very funny :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok 10 min then |pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: double tends to be a two-suiter|pg||
nt|mwigor: win @sA ruff @c cash @sk @dA pitching last @h as east ruffs with his trump trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: doubt you need to, pard may take you seriously |pg||
nt|mug: this double is probably not penalty|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how to get to @S here,  notice that E did not bid |pg||
nt|mug: North can clarify now with 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: TOO COMMITTAL|pg||
nt|frankaus: what did they feed the dealing machine - rat poison?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: and missing 6 here |pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: its a goulash tourney Frank |pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
nt|sybarra: so if 2 suiter  does he bid 6?|pg||
nt|roswolf: finis|pg||
nt|mug: I don't think North will like his hand, @CKx looks sick|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: interesting contract|pg||
nt|shevek: is this a general invitation Denis?  |pg||
nt|mug: improved on 2007, quarter-finals this year, the boys said 8500 played perfectly against them in that match|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: it is truth|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may swing the other way |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: we can see very quick bridge|pg||
nt|shevek: quick bridge is the operator's nightmare , I know :)|pg||
mc|12|nt|sybarra: so pass is in order |pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|davidstern: REAL (Gladysh E., Churlin I., Tuszynski P., Zmudzinski A.) |pg||
mb|3S|nt|mug: so East can obviously make 7@D here, but also 7NT|pg||
nt|davidstern: ESTONIA (Levenko V., Sester S., Luks L., Oja O.) |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: looks like West has shown clubs and hearts, and therefore North did not bid his clubs|pg||
nt|davidstern: Obvious to us and I think even to East|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|nt|davidstern: I would have bid 7@D and not 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Why let opps find good save in major|pg||
nt|mug: he wants to find out if partner has @CA|pg||
nt|davidstern: :)|pg||
nt|mug: 7NT scores more and doesn't go off on ruffs|pg||
nt|mug: Evgeny Gladysh is considering a save in 7@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Weigh that up against not having the @CA and opps finding great fit|pg||
nt|davidstern: Best lead against 7@S is @H to Ace diamond ruffed with king then @HK and club ruff strecthes them trumps out|pg||

nt|mug: tough when your suit breaks 3-3, how can you play for that?|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: as usual,   ....here we go again!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|shevek: hello Traian|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Nicoleta|pg||
nt|bebechira: Roland asked me to help because you were busy as usual .... :)|pg||
nt|shevek: hi shirley @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may have a "date" in the bar |pg||
nt|sybarra: look at the east hand!!! |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: you are right |pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk7: and welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: notrump contracts are rare|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he walk it up or just bid it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: after the final there will be banquet )|pg||
nt|sybarra: how fun!  and lots of vodka?  wine  or? |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: with the "goulash"|pg||
nt|shevek: main course: goulash soup|pg||
nt|sybarra: Nico,  gave recipe earlier |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: "goulah" in russian is the meet|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: 6@D is a fair result for NS|pg||
mb|7D|nt|roswolf: pass = poor hand?|pg||
nt|mug: 7@D is cold but EW can save in 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: here we go "blasting" into..........|pg||
nt|mug: or 7@H obviously|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is gf presumably in this event|pg||
nt|sybarra: they might try the "reverse" to save in 6 @H  LOL|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now we get 3@D from west!?|pg||
nt|shevek: hello Roland :)|pg||
nt|shevek: and Joe|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: hi Roland  )|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: hi all )|pg||
nt|sybarra: Zmudzinski is world grand master - world and olympic champion - have won the Transnationals in Brazil lately ( Zimmermann team ) |pg||
nt|sybarra: ty specs for great info  |pg||
nt|shevek: he is a Goulash expert|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: hang on, West can ruff a club and East can ruff a spade, didn't see that|pg||
nt|mug: 3@D now by South should end the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: red save anyone? |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: meat )|pg||
nt|shevek: http://www.bestrecipes.com.au/recipe/Beef-Goulash-L238.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: or a save I mean |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Hi Denis|pg||
nt|sybarra: strong jump shifts typical in goulash |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: he is expert in all games )|pg||
nt|bebechira: he has a nice club suit this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Levenko has decided not to bid 7@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is quick claaim |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk5: This is divided into to halves of 5 boards, so there will be a short break after board 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: bid what you think you can make|pg||
nt|sybarra: yeah this can go down |pg||
nt|mug: doubles like West's usually show 2-suiters|pg||
nt|mug: 3-suited hands are very rare|pg||
nt|santyclz: For many people playing ghoulash, e's x would be penalty.|pg||
nt|santyclz: W knows he's doomed this hand.  4333 is a death holding.|pg||
nt|mug: in fact some pairs play any 3NT bid as ace-asking|pg||
nt|shevek: that is true in any form of bridge Joe :)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|roswolf: very disci[plined|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: good contract )|pg||
nt|sybarra: S is proabably sure @D's dont break |pg||
nt|mug: it doesn't make, but good contract |pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|mug: West has a difficult lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: Denis, you are right |pg||
nt|shevek: true true|pg||
nt|bebechira: and 7nt ..... will they bid it?|pg||
nt|shevek: 4th suit forcing|pg||
mc|13|nt|mug: second double is for the club lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: and slam doubles lightner !?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and X says  2 suiter,  lead a (suit preference if you have one) club |pg||
nt|mug: watch for the suit preference club lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can see ace and club q works |pg||
nt|sybarra: S is saying   "lovely pard, thanks"  |pg||
nt|mug: you can tell this hand was dealt 4-3-3-3|pg||

nt|davidstern: Hi Geoff|pg||
mb|2C|nt|davidstern: Basically avoiding trouble is the trick on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: the expert Goulash players here are very good at staying low on these misfits|pg||
nt|davidstern: Imagine a golf hole where the entire fairfay is covered with bunkers - that is this hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: fairway|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mug: 2@C presumably showed the minors|pg||
nt|davidstern: Best is to play trumps as soon as possible|pg||
nt|davidstern: yes and East passed to show his better minor|pg||
nt|mug: so East simply packs it in|pg||
nt|davidstern: These are seasoned players|pg||
nt|mug: some of the best players here are very good indeed|pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice hand in that the opps cant force you as you have 28 points and 6 of the remaining 12 are in trumps|pg||

nt|davidstern: 3NT may go on @SJ lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: Oh then South gets endplayed|pg||
nt|mug: a chance for Real to pick up if they can bid and make 3NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzzb: the last board of the first segment|pg||
nt|sybarra: well,  the partenship understand of the X |pg||
nt|sybarra: impressive |pg||
nt|sybarra: and now last  bd of this segment |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: the last board of the QF|pg||
nt|mug: this time there is no ruff against the grand slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: Denis,   great job as always |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: we will continue tomorrow - SF and Final of the tournament|pg||
nt|roswolf: grand is on|pg||
nt|sybarra: being asked why 7 @S wasnt bid,k  |pg||
nt|sybarra: or obvious |pg||
mb|2N|an|minors at least 6-5|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and another fascinating hand |pg||
nt|mug: the problem is that declarer is often also void|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w may have to really scramble here to match the OR result |pg||
nt|roswolf: why did 6@S MAKE? looks like 2 losers|pg||
nt|mug: a good partner will probably try his 8-card suit in case you can ruff, anyway|pg||
nt|shevek: good score for EW in the OR|pg||
nt|santyclz: Although it wouldn't work in a tourney setting, ghoulash is frequently played that any hand that doesn't reach at least 4@ds is redealt.|pg||
nt|shevek: 2NT showing @h+ min?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: The last board of the first segment|pg||
nt|shevek: or @c and a Maj?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: the last board of the Semifinal|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: the last board... (|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 nt must be both minors |pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk5: Declarer played clubs for no loser. Strong player|pg||
nt|mug: whoops, egg on face for someone|pg||
nt|shevek: don't go far, we restart in 10 min or so, true Denis?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: correct|pg||
nt|shevek: west is not going to pass :)|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: another wild one|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: of course with double )|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I have signed up to be here at 6 am my time |pg||
nt|mug: I think we'll see EW employ some kind of ace-asking device|pg||
nt|sybarra: just to join in |pg||
nt|mug: maybe 3@S says spades are trumps, and now East will cue-bid|pg||
nt|shevek: 7@h would be a good sac here|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@c opening in the other room denied 3-card Maj I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: last bd of tourney |pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: Except East might have had a club, then 7NT cold. (Ron)|pg||
nt|sybarra: great job Denis     we enjoyed |pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: @CJ lead and @C10 continuation, not best|pg||
nt|mug: all cue-bids in this game are first-round|pg||
nt|shevek: well done to the winners, forgot to mention the prize pool US$9,000  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: thanks all|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to all the sponsors, the players and the commentators   |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: indeed i would lead ace and another trump not the J +10 OFclubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: we will continue in 10-15 minutes|pg||
nt|mug: another 3NT contract in the OR, making when @DQ fell|pg||
nt|sybarra: unusual to see a "weak" 2 in goulash |pg||
nt|bebechira: quiet 4 spades here|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: oh , I have just been told that this is a goulash tournament :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: great tourney!   we look forward to it next year |pg||
pc|c2|nt|mug: 4NT may be some kind of specialized BW|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Let me invite you to the final which start in 25 minutes|pg||
nt|mug: very good result for Estonia, as I don't think 5@D makes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: isnt if fun!!  |pg||
nt|shevek: 2NT asked for minor, 3@s = @d longer??|pg||
nt|shevek: just making it up....|pg||
nt|sybarra: totally different methods here than the usual |pg||
nt|bebechira: :)|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: yes :) it is fun|pg||
nt|sybarra: wemay play 5 @D here|pg||
nt|bebechira: does not make|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 sp does |pg||
nt|bebechira: yep|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mug: surprised West didn't try 6@S here, but fair play to him, he did the right thing|pg||
nt|shevek: for those who are looking for the cooking classes:http://www.bestrecipes.com.au/recipe/Beef-Goulash-L238.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Estonia is going to win the Cup )|pg||
nt|shevek: thx shirley, great job Denis, thx specs|pg||
nt|sybarra: congrats to them |pg||
pc|d5|nt|santyclz: Bidding isn't as safe as it looks.  S could easily have 6@s for the 4@h bid.|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe just a flat board ?  :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5@s, i mean|pg||
nt|shevek: good decision by north|pg||
nt|mug: good morning|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hello Tom|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: hi Tom|pg||
nt|mug: bit unprincipled though, showed his hand pretty well with 6@H I'd have thought|pg||
nt|santyclz: Gm Tom.|pg||
nt|shevek: -800 wins the segment|pg||
nt|shevek: hi Tom|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: heart from the right hand ()|pg||
nt|mug: on the other hand if partner has @CA he is probably making 7@H and no way to find out|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: no trump lead|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe even -500|pg||
nt|benislovas: A of clubs and 13 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mug: spade lead and South may get endplayed|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: nope |pg||
nt|shevek: 2 down even on trump lead (from david)|pg||
nt|mug: the opening lead is always a challenge at this game|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mug: and Kholomeev did well with the lead, a trump was certainly in the picture, or at least I'd have thought so|pg||
nt|mug: rather disappointing, they didn't have the methods|pg||
nt|sybarra: they needed it |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm grand missed|pg||
nt|roswolf: off to monaco bye all|pg||
nt|mug: how would the bidding go in your Goulash system, Denis?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: now all participants are going to watch the big TV|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: the football match between Germany and Russia|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: I think 1@h - 2@S should be FG|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Kholomeev thought that 3@s was SPL|pg||
nt|sybarra: and enjoy the banquet Denis |pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: got a plus score|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok cu back in short time, |pg||
nt|mug: some very hot play at this table|pg||

nt|bebechira: wow|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: ty Nicole :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lucky it makes|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I would have bid 4 @H  I am sure there is a reason |pg||
nt|sybarra: looking for 6 @S maybe?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Adam has asked his opponents not to ask about the bidding|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mug: ah well, thank you for the entertainment, see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx all cu in my early am :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: thanks all !|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|shevek: but wait...there is MORE!|pg||
nt|mug: some situations really are total guesswork, West took the IMP-type decision to bid on|pg||
nt|shevek: good sport|pg||
nt|sybarra: Gladysh-Churlin together with Balicki-Zmudzinski has won this Cup 2004,2005.2006.2007. Think they didn´t play last year :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: from a spec  |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: thanks, I will try )|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dan_hohor: :) true , the normal rules do not apply at goulash|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mug: trump lead was good enough I think, now he can exit twice in spades|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dan_hohor: it is all inspiration and table presence |pg||
pc|s3|nt|shevek: 7@h was the winning bid here|pg||
