nt|athene: bidding after a t/o double is actually an area where there is a lot of scope for innovation and experiment, i think|pg||
nt|athene: basically you get twice as many possible sequences because you can always pass and bid later|pg||

mc|9|nt|hedyg: however passing with the S hand is not a good option IMO|pg||
nt|athene: so it's definitely playable - and might well be optimal - to reserve direct bids only for certain hands, and pass and come in later with many others|pg||

pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: still, there is the danger of getitng forced |pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW probably do best to cash @SAK and switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|jstokes: yes, and crossing to dummy to lead a club increases that danger -- but increases the possibility of making|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H actually shows diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even 3S ttypically puts enough pressure on opps in auctions like this wherethey have not made one natural bid|pg||
nt|roghog: glad you can interpret for us, Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W play, in my opinion, one of the world's most interesting systems|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: this save a bit gungho|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jcmax: I am wondering why Madala did not choose a preempt at 1st opportunity|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2C!|an|Majors|nt|hedyg: in that case he could have bid 1NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i believe in bidding what you would have bid without the double, here 1@h|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|vugraphzxt: 2NT = Clubs - inv or more|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: south doesn't just bash in 3NT, which certainly looks like an option|pg||
nt|athene: if east has equal majors you might well profit from preventing west showing which he prefers, to help with the opening lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: how so? E showed majors and he has no stoppers|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: on the auction north didn't fancy 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: give south a small singleton heart and you can see them running the first five hearts|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: of course, whenever you decide partner "must" have a singleton in opps' suit on the bidding, he has a doubleton|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: but even so, on a heart lead there's only 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|hedyg: but was 5@c necessary? would 4@c have been stronger than 5?|pg||

nt|athene: still, they will lose 3 imps for this anyway|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||

nt|marlowepi: outbid them in any other suit. 1S allows NS to find a red suit too|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no - 5@c looks wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=804&qshowflag=1  running scores Group A|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H = 10-13 with hearts, and maybe a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: ah, here we go|pg||
nt|santyclz: Harmon Edgar points out 5@cs is there for those who bid @cs as a suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: in any event -500 is way better than -800|pg||
nt|roghog: another fascinating idea|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@S is an enquiry, not showing spades|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C|nt|haans: long way to 9th trick|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4H was there too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|hedyg: this cannot be right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless Versace is in 5@Hx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double probably prepares for showing a value raise to 3H|pg||
nt|jcmax: Bocchi doubles 2@S here because his hand is not all about hearts. he has some constructive values and all of them outside hearts. Bidding 3@H would show a different kind of hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sabine said it better:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: no, I just used more words :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: people seldom outbid me in THAT respect:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: male and female?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: what on earth is going on here? |pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2NT denied a minor, hence 6+ hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: @S lead will give declarer the temp |pg||
nt|sybarra: *tempo|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: 2@s weak 1suiter . 5+ cards|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bessi2: that makes no sense either|pg||
nt|jstokes: better but still seems unlikely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon West bid 4@S and South 5@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then double by West|pg||
nt|bessi2: yep,  that seems plausible|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do i get to choose?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Once again, e-w's 9 card club fit was undisclosed.|pg||
nt|jcmax: It seems like declarer has to lose 11S, 2@H and 2@D tricks. Making this contract would be tough|pg||
nt|santyclz: Who cares about @cs.|pg||
nt|santyclz: See you later folks, I've been re-assigned.|pg||
nt|jcmax: see you|pg||
nt|marlowepi: see you Joe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: send a  postcard|pg||
nt|jcmax: Maala is trying to figure out a lie of the cards consistent with the bidding that would let him make his contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: To show spades, West would have to bid 2NT.  The system can at times make your head spin|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And the system is not clever enough to know that South has all the hearts, unfortunately|pg||
nt|roghog: Leader is thrown in, so only 1 down|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bjacobs: It looks like this down one without any endplay|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: he shouldnt have bid so much without the 8 of diamonds (though even then diamond lead & spade back beats it|pg||

nt|athene: oh, ok, 3@C was just an overbid then?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i guess so|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: they are lucky, though - the defence can't get a diamond through before the diamonds go on @HAK|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: still, it allows our imagination free rein :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Francois is a new operator :)|pg||
nt|h bertens: after d for tke king he could cash ace of c and play q of spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now we check their non-slam bidding|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|h bertens: then he wins|pg||
mb|p|nt|jstokes: and it's not that easy :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so the 2@S opening shows a profit there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed it isn't|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he will learn quickly :) courage Francois!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not absloutley certain, but I think 2@D=both majors|pg||
nt|roghog: not too tough a test here|pg||
nt|haans: that 2 is weeeeeeeeak|pg||
nt|sybarra: is this (mini) multi?|pg||
nt|haans: can we call it anything?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|h bertens: should have taken ace of d|pg||
nt|jcmax: Sementa apparently did very well on board 1 in the other bringing hme 3NT with an overtrick after a @S lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: garbage multi  I am told |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bessi2: it will take a heart lead to beat this it seems|pg||
nt|jstokes: hardly seems fair -- not only are Lauria-Versace two of the world's greatest players, they have a bid for everything |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They will cue 1st and 2nd round controls, so Nunes knows immediately that he is off 2 club losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: will make on a diamond lead |pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|haans: spec think suicidal is best|pg||
nt|sybarra: in 3rd seat with this vulnerability |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|roghog: welcome|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Most top players cue-bid this way.  Cue 1st and 2nd round controls, and use Blackwood to check back whether you are off two aces|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have some other suggestions which will remain private to me, thanks specs, ! |pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: will make on a club lead, too|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|jcmax: Very tough for Bocchi here to stay out of game after partner freely bid 1@S. The question is: Did 31H confirm 4 cards in @S?|pg||

mb|1S|nt|athene: you might open north a 15-17 NT, but that doesn't mean you want to overcall 1nt over 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: when opps have bid your 5-card suit it reduces your playing strength a lot because the suit is very unlikely to break|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i would not open N as 1NT without any spotcards|pg||
nt|athene: so with no club texture, you are downgrading severely here|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: i would open north 1nt with three aces and decent 5-suit, but it's close|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 level overcalls are getting lighter and lighter. no need to hang pd for making them by bashing into game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|hedyg: Rekstad just bid 4@s, no fooling around with cuebids|pg||
nt|athene: notice how Bocchi uses 2@D, rather than 2@C, as the cue to show a good spade raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|athene: the reason being, he might want to bid clubs naturally but he can never want to bid diamonds naturally, on this auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: since he didn't overcall 1@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: can we assume that 2@d is stronger than 2@c would have been?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: North could have doubled rather than bidding 3@S if he has already shown three spades|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|hedyg: he certainly did, both by bidding 2@d and by passing 2@s|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: but perhaps they play that more as pure penalty rather than just "cards" so he felt he didn't have the diamonds for it|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: but this is a classic example of "law" decisions - why bid 3 over 3 just because you have points? what matters is the degree of fit|pg||

nt|hedyg: vraiment 4@H par S?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No problems with the aces and kings.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: merci|pg||
nt|bessi2: i wonder what the range of 1N is,  seems strange not to try for slam with east hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: so it was a South African Texas after all, 4@C=@H|pg||
nt|jstokes: I suspect 4@C was Gerber (asking aces) and he found two missing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then it was a good idea to stop. |pg||
nt|bessi2: ahhh.. yes.. i think you're right|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT might well be 13-15|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|haans: Lindqvist to blame|pg||
nt|paulg:  is Rekstad older than Lindqvist?|pg||
nt|sybarra: may need some help from defense here|pg||
nt|sybarra: or a spec rightly suggest help from supernatural powers |pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: I'm guessing, but it's common nowadays with big clubs, that 1@H shows 19+, artificial|pg||
nt|roghog: 2@c some sort of semi-positive after that|pg||

nt|ritong: or @h A and a @h|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, Henri, he develops a heart ruff that way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, the @HA and another is the way to get 800, as the hearts can be played succesfully with dummy's two entries|pg||
nt|ritong: the difference between 500 and 800 is not huge, imp speaking, with the result other room 2 imps or so|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: True Bill as a hundred specs tell me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yeah, specs can be like that :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but Henri it could mean a 10 imp swing if the Italians were only in game in the other room|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: sry 8 imps|pg||
nt|paulg:  At the club West would have bid, but the Italians like a stronger hand for their 2-suiter overcalls when vulnerable|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: I don't think the italians did anything wrong here ... at this level, you have to disrupt big club auctions|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not 10|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|roghog: Well, if partner is sticking his neck out with 2@s, you risk chopping it off with 3@s, I suppose|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The 3@S bid takes away N/S's 3@D and 3@H bids.  If Nunes didn't have @C10, he would have earned a big swing|pg||

nt|athene: it's quite a low-level bid so you can load lots of cunning meanings into it|pg||

nt|hedyg: do you play 4@c as rkc in @c?|pg||

nt|paulg:  3@c, natural and forcing looks a good start here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: Tournament website: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/09Paris/Paris.htm |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  or perhaps 4@c to show the slam intent|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bjacobs: North needs to find out 3 things:  aces, @DK, @HQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: lost the @H suit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not yet|pg||
nt|bessi2: he will surely bid 3h now|pg||
nt|jstokes: 3N is OK too|pg||
nt|bessi2: but 2n seems like an underbid to me|pg||
nt|roghog: Isn't that 4? :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One very simple way to do it is 4NT over 2@H - if partner bids 5@S (2 aces, @HQ), he can bid 5NT asking for a cue-bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: All right 4 things, you pedant :)|pg||
nt|ritong: moi?:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so none of the above Paul |pg||
nt|haans: 4th suit or anythink but GF|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: very friendly layout hee for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: they will probably discover @h Q is missing|pg||
nt|haans: did the 4th suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: makes sense,   and then now can find the trump suit |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Seriously, this is the auction you should have in SAYC:  1@D-1@H-2@H-4NT-5@H-6@H|pg||
nt|roghog: he is too embarrassed to use a simple 4NT on VG|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or something like that, anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: there are other considerations|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I guess so - eg a 3-card raise|pg||
nt|ritong: like maybe @h is not the right suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is where the French are at an advantage?  2@H would show 4?|pg||
nt|ritong: it is not really an advantage|pg||
nt|paulg:  this works okay unless partner supports hearts, and then there is confusion about trumps|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: North virtually endplayed at trick 1|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 9 quick tricks, when @hs split give K@D|pg||
nt|ritong: it just saves the checking bids|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well, this will make, but not a great advert for the system when a simple 1@S overcall means you can't find a 4-4 fit (unless 3@S showed hearts and West rejected hearts to play NT) ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  |pg||
nt|lestergold: at least diamond never cost a trick|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like some sort of Turbo here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: however, this is 13 for azzurri|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|ritong: yes, 12|pg||

nt|ritong: ok, 13|pg||
nt|haans: 5nt-7?|pg||
mb|5N|nt|bjacobs: You really should be able to call the match referee and get the imp result adjusted on the board|pg||
nt|ritong: come on|pg||
nt|ritong: there is a gambling part in the game|pg||
nt|bjacobs: nope.  I am offended by this result|pg||
nt|roghog: You should get moral IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: but they do|pg||
nt|sybarra: obviously @C's are trump to S |pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|roghog: So a good but unlucky player could be a Moral Grand Master|pg||

nt|haans: just playing now?|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  South can hardly be better here, but concerned that partner only has four hearts and there is a pointed loser ... 6@d is a nice bid|pg||

nt|bessi2: but i wonder what dbl of 3@h meant.. some play it penalty and pass t/o  or no good bid,  but others play dbl as pure t/o and pass everyting else|pg||
nt|bessi2: i believe the latter is the better approach.. usually you don't get rich dbling opps in their 9+ fits|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think after 2@c they were in forcing mode and X was t/o|pg||
nt|jstokes: In a GF auction, it would be unusual to me to play it as takeout|pg||
nt|jstokes: pass works for Take out|pg||
nt|bessi2: exactly what i mean.. the general approach.. when GF dbl is pen,,, |pg||
nt|bessi2: but that pass becomes so loaded,  it just shows no penalty dbl of hearts.. |pg||
nt|bessi2: and no other convenient bid|pg||
nt|jstokes: and no ability to raise clubs or bid your own suit|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Incredibly tricky hand on @SQ lead|pg||
nt|ritong: i therefore wonder why he did not decide to go for game and propose his @cs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bjacobs: Has to win in North|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then if a club is ducked - how do you unentangle things?|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe 3@h has a conventional sense|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer doesn't know clubs are 2-2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So here GIB is really giving unrealistic advice|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Specs want declarer to take 2 diamonds, his 8th and 9th tricks - pray, what do you discard on the second diamond?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's what I was thinking of when I mentioned a squeeze on declarer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What a hand!|pg||

nt|paulg:  evo has pointed out that a trump lead would beat this|pg||

nt|lestergold: if west cannot find a double over 4H then east's 4S bid extremely dangerous|pg||
nt|h bertens: 5@C only 1 down?|pg||
nt|h bertens: is he thinking about it?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s may only go one down all depends|pg||
nt|lestergold: on lead|pg||
nt|h bertens: why 5C down 2?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but as 4h is one off on leading the stiff ace of spades its not good business|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2NT was not for minors, it showed a strong hand asking|pg||
nt|h bertens: normal I think.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they dont actually know the layout when they have to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4S vul against notwith a horrific suit you consider that normal?|pg||
nt|h bertens: yes I do.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too, just unlucky|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That comment applies to this board as well ... imagine N/S's spades swapped|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: vul against not affects game bonus also|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: this will make easily enough|pg||
nt|ralfwil: of course a 6-card suit, but too weak in my opinion|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: i wonder whether pass over 5@s was forcing|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: it  is veryunlucky but sometimes you have to allow a preempt to stand- it could be even worse|pg||
nt|roghog: Indeed. An aggressive 2@s by E|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: I think it will be forced to|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|paulg:  everything very friendly on this deal|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes but a challenge to play |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: i want a better suit quality rest of hand ok|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you will make usually 4S facing   Qxxx  xxx  x  Kxxxx  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s is also only -1 with the right play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes yoyu just have to hope for support|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Axxx   xx   xx    xxxxx    you wiull also usually mnake|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h to @h A and @sJ...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: sorry  meant  stiff diamond in 2nd ex|pg||
nt|lestergold: and north will kill the club suit|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: like here - has to play @HA, really|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: but to agressive when nonvul?|pg||
nt|paulg:  "colours are for children" seems to be the way in all aspects of the game nowadays|pg||
nt|haans: agree (with u)|pg||
nt|paulg:  just keep bidding game and let the defence have the problems|pg||
nt|haans: and they never double|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|h bertens: only down 1, not to bad|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bessi2: i doubt it was forcing.. versace probably just gambled his pd had an ace and wanted to force him to lead clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: N had 15 hcps but no defense really|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roghog: Hey, we're coming to board 20, our last one. Time to thank Francois, our superb VG Operator in Paris!!|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: N carefully saving exit card for later|pg||
nt|lestergold: isnt ti 3 dims to lose?|pg||
nt|roghog: Not forgetting the EBL, and our hosts Xavier Schurer and the FFB|pg||
nt|roghog: Thanks also to Bill, Henri and Sunil. And to Fred, Roland and the magnificent BBO|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h bertens: has to guess very well|pg||
nt|h bertens: play Q of @D, and squeese/endplay north....very hard i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: it will be well played/lucky if it only goes one off|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|h bertens: 2down at least now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ralfwil: Not if E takes one more round of trumps|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N has AKTx of diaomonds there are 3 diamond losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: finesse curse of scotalnd?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i reckon|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe 3 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless he plays a high dim now|pg||
nt|lestergold: what an uncomfortable tank forEast|pg||
pc|s9|nt|haans: @C9 BIG|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: the shapes are marked and N surely has both D honors. i think the winning play may be the correct one -- diamond honor from hand, unblocking the 7|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|mdgraham: EWwill get to game here, just a question of which one|pg||
nt|haans: we thank you all spectator its meen nice|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our wonderful (nameless) operator  (we are quite sure his name is not "vugraph" |pg||

mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: Tx Roger & Bill. Was a pleasure commentating with you.|pg||
nt|sybarra: our operators name is Francois....@H@H|pg||
nt|haans: next match 50 minutes|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our specs, who keep us on our toes and provide advice and humor |pg||
mb|4C|nt|bjacobs: Thanks all|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|hedyg: can make 6@H with a good view in @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy game in any of three denoms hee|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4 of a major expected|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and to all the specs for their useful comments|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ends quietly but there were several wonderful boards in that set|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: one thing worth noting - in twenty boards, the Italians have conceded only one major swing, and it took a slightly abnormal opening (2@S on a five-card suit) to generate it  |pg||
nt|hedyg: but really a lousy slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they are really hard to beat at the table|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 19 will be a swing too?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could be.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If E had playes one more @s N is squeezed to discard a @h and after that a @dQ from the hand N must win and exit with what?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yes Raif a difference of two ricks but how often do we see a player in a horrible contract gho off even more than he had to|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|hedyg: 3@d shows control in @D AND in @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry 4@d of course|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bessi2: amen,  i thought 1N was limited and he would surely bid 4h there not 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: since 4@c denied @s control E would not cuebid @d without @s control|pg||
nt|jstokes: big club, so 1NT may not be all that limited|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our matches at 20.00 local time (in 1 hour and 35 minutes) will be France Hosts vs Iceland and Allegra Italy vs Germany|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it looks like they ahve done too much, though|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can make this by playing J@H |pg||
nt|hedyg: J@S drops and he can disc 2@cs in dummy |pg||
nt|mdgraham: can make this double-dummy - bet one off|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|haans: easy make|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of k of @S to be on side |pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
pc|s9|nt|anders: There were many nice plays in the open room as well|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jstokes: running the jack is a start; also have to NOT finese the second round in hearts|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|bessi2: i bet versace not feeling to good right now holding the king of hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: what would you play now?|pg||
nt|bessi2: versace will play club |pg||
nt|mdgraham: club nine|pg||
nt|hedyg: can Lauria have singleton @S?|pg||
nt|bessi2: impossible imo|pg||
nt|mdgraham: likely to have led it if so|pg||
nt|hedyg: as in if you dont lead it you dont have it?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|anders: A nice match for both players, spectators and commentators.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: I like these systems where you wait til fourth level before bidding the suit you are going to play in|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roghog: Absolutely. We're so lucky to be entertain by these experts|pg||
