nt|haans: what a fight :)|pg||
nt|pkl: Lots of dynamite in the first deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: one a  missing in  Schollaardt|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@h on W. will they find it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hi Mike Gold Uk here|pg||
mb|2D|an|18-19 balanced|nt|ralfwil: Hello Mike! Nice to see you again!|pg||
nt|jcmax: Hi all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Sabine!|pg||
nt|haans: Both teams need a good win|pg||
nt|sybarra2: bet we hear 3 @C from N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Only 2@h???|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: our operator is Francois Colin, bonjour Francois:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@C is an artificial game force|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: hi Raif|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H is even more artificialer|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Bill|pg||
nt|pkl: I have no idea what the D means, so don't ask about the bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If S bids 5@c I prefer 5@d from W|pg||
mb|2N|nt|santyclz: Hi Sabine.  I guess I'll let you make the 2@c/1@d suggestions.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: @H cheriehi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Sabine|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Marshall|pg||
nt|haans: and he got it|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|h bertens: nice 800 to start with|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3@D a make|pg||
mb|p|nt|jstokes: good dummy for Versace -- right ace, spade J|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://tinyurl.com/539d3g|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and an easy 3 @C here,  S hand nearly perfecto |pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|h bertens: 500|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: still, there is the danger of getitng forced |pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW probably do best to cash @SAK and switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|jstokes: yes, and crossing to dummy to lead a club increases that danger -- but increases the possibility of making|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H actually shows diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: even 3S ttypically puts enough pressure on opps in auctions like this wherethey have not made one natural bid|pg||
nt|roghog: glad you can interpret for us, Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W play, in my opinion, one of the world's most interesting systems|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: this save a bit gungho|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcmax: I am wondering why Madala did not choose a preempt at 1st opportunity|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roghog: agreed. nothing else anywhere near it|pg||
nt|haans: Fantunes system text by Daniel Neill 29 pages): http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No artificial forcing opening ... just a lot of natural ones, 1@C, 1@D, 1@H and 1@S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bessi2: now he'll just discard club and except a small minus|pg||
nt|bessi2: accept i mean :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Peter, Ralf and specs|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: lucky lead and it still makes a loss|pg||
nt|h bertens: back to 800|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@h has some play e-w but doesn't seem likely to be bid.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|ralfwil: W:s hand is VERY strong in this situation, so 5@d is obvious for me and my P will bid 6@h|pg||
nt|pkl: Seems like a draw. West will play the spade ace soon to keep South out, then claim 13 tricks|pg||
nt|pkl: Yes - Wests hand is almost to good.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|h bertens: to 500|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|haans: and very hard to learn|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pg||
nt|hedyg: good defense|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roghog: Are you trying to, Hans?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c9|nt|haans: looking at it but not really trying|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As one who is in fact playing with it (or trying to), I can tell you that it's a lot of fun|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|roghog: I can well imagine|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: playing @DK wasn't|pg||
nt|hedyg: E wishing he had not played the K@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c X in the OR was not a success|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: he will not be expecting 13 imps for that|pg||
