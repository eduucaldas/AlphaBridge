nt|Walddk2: Perhaps you could edit your profile|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Graham is Mike Graham, mdgraham, one of our regular vugraph commentators|pg||
nt|jallerton: Father and son combination East/West|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are Welsh, are they not, Jeffrey?|pg||
nt|jallerton: West (Gary) is the father.  Both from Wales but living in London|pg||
nt|jallerton: In fact, many players on the Welsh nationl team do not actually live in Wales, Roland|pg||
nt|chick: correct me if I'm wrong, John, but I think we are playing 12 boards this session, starting with 10 so we can see comparisons after a couple of boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We would normally start with boards 11 and 12 in this room, but perhaps they changed the procedure|pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: correct|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html  for standings after 3 rounds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So these two teams are 9th and 10th, but much can still happen|pg||
nt|chick: but its fun to watch one of our own like Mike Graham :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jallerton: True, Roland.  Even when we get a bit further, the teams in 9th/10th have something to play for: to avoid relegation!|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: this match is from division1, relegation would be to divsion 2|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Graham's idea was to tap declarer if possible. That's often a good idea when you have trump length|pg||
nt|chick: a kib asks why not the @DJ|pg||
nt|jallerton: Imagine AQ9x(x) in dummy|pg||

nt|vugraphzwf: Daf thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If declarer times this, the defence will only get 2 trump tricks from here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Diamond to hand, ruff a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks ok as roland says timing is crucial|pg||
nt|jallerton: Is it obvious to do this rather than take @h finesse?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h4|pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: No, but he can't take a heart finesse from dummy|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a funny hand. On the surface it looked like declarer had to lose a heart and two trump tricks from where he was, but one of those can be avoided|pg||
nt|jallerton: His actual line just needs @h finesse to work (or @sQJ doubleton)|pg||
mc|9|nt|Walddk2: However, as Jeffrey pointed out, you probably have to know the layout to play the hand like that|pg||

nt|lestergold: the suit rebid implies now that east started with five spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially as 3S is not forcing here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: so the raise can be made with either three or four spades accordingly|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|roswolf: agreed marshall|pg||
nt|jallerton: but partner should have opened 3@D with 7!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: On a good day you make a heart slam here; this is not a good day|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well that is also true|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The slam is actually quite good after East's opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: no semblance of a slam try here|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jallerton: I'm sure Roland would find a way to bid slam|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: quite good  maybe an overbid, since E opened in 3rd chair at fav colors|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a very boig overcall. Mike has made Eric Kokish proud|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: i would have bid 2@C as north|pg||
pc|d6|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jallerton: I agree with 1@h.  You don;t want partner to jump in @S|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't mind 1@H either|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|h4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, with a 19 count there is little risk that partner can jump|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, since you are prepared to bid 3N, double is not that dangerous-- a good partner is not going to jump to 4S|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|jallerton: Spec suggests that a @s lead might beat this|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: despite the bad trump break declarer is in control|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: he didnt open 2S or 3S, and if he has a good hand with shorter spades he should cue and go slowly|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jallerton: not after 1@c-X-3@C say|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that sequence he can still bid 3S or responsive double, danger of 4S is small. anyway yr club holding makes that development unlikely|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c4|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|mc|10|nt|marlowepi: i might bid 1H myself, but the double has some distinct upsides. for example, 1H  is unlikely to get you to 6D which could easily be cold facing not much of a hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: now we will get comparisons|pg||
