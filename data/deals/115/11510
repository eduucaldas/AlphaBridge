nt|othered1: What's 2@S?|pg||
nt|rodal f: If 4@S EW have a sac at @D for 500|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would rdbl to show a half stop|pg||

nt|rodal f: All info we can serve u, sorrely no resaults: http://www.federation-bridge.mc/INTERNATIONAL-TEAMS-TOURNAMENT.html|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: SATURDAY 10 : Intermediate Phase (14.30) Formula Swiss, 4 rounds of 8 boards : teams keep all VP won during the Phase of Qualification|pg||
nt|gracelin: but some partnerships open 5-card weak two systematically. Their 2H/2S are genuine weak two|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2D shows a weak two with only a 5-card suit.|pg||
nt|haans: very often in denmark|pg||
nt|gracelin: might be a good idea|pg||
nt|gracelin: Is north choosing between game and partial, or between 3NT and 4S?|pg||
nt|haans: loves being declarer|pg||
nt|gracelin: all depend on their weak two style|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: The good @C suit would lead me to open 1@C also, but that's far from a universal choice|pg||

nt|aupillon: there is Cindy overthere too :)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: for some it is not an issue of solidity but rather of partner being able to judge the auction because he knows how many cards we have in our fitting suit|pg||
nt|othered1: Why?  May be tougher to penalize (is that true?) but what does it do to constructive bidding?|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed in europe it is quite fashionable to use the multi to show rbbish and 2M as solid weak 2's|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all:) was commenating in other room and slipped through hole in wall:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: anyway bye for now - restart in 10-15 mins|pg||
nt|othered1: Ok with that distinction it makes some sense to my conservative eyes.  But still why throw the cards up in the air 1st seat vul?  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes Geoff i play the same method but i still would not open a 7 card suit with a weak 2. matter of style and philosophy|pg||
nt|othered1: For a rare occasion, I agree with Marshall about an initial action :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 7 card suits are for the 3 level. if ya cant stand that much heat then ya pass and bid later|pg||
