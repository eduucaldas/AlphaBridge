nt|andersk: " groups with a round robin first, thats 5 rounds|pg||
nt|andersk: 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many of he French play play precise 2-suited overcalls, e.g. Ghestem, but here S understandably bids 1S|pg||

nt|rado: hello all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Rad|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|rado: welcome to Euro Champ's league:)|pg||
nt|rado: official site at: http://www.eurobridge1.org/competitions/09Paris/Paris.htm|pg||
nt|andersk: no slam on this hand! Levy so aggressive that it probably wont be bid|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|an| |nt|marlowepi: effective use of forcing passes here|pg||
nt|rado: EW open very light so present E's hand is far from minimum|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it will be W who is thinking here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W would seem to have a clear double here, hand too balanced to bid higher|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  so E's pass was not forcing after all|pg||
nt|andersk: strange pass|pg||

nt|rado: for minus 1 not a big diffrence|pg||
nt|andersk: I would play @C in trick 2|pg||

pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: forcing game best|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S must lose lead 4 times|pg||
nt|andersk: That pass from W still a mystery|pg||
nt|andersk: Maybe East did double:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  unlike Victor to be so passive|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: 3 of those times to E. he will probably try to snare Qx of clubs in the E hand. as cards lie his best shot is king of clubs from hand|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes but the french are apparently the best card-holders in the universe, because they have TWO strong artificial forcing openings: 2D which is a powerhouse buyt not GF, and 2D ...|pg||

mb|1D|nt|andersk: N  hand is 2 @C to me|pg||
mb|1H|mb|4D|nt|andersk: But I would probably change my mind and open as Mouiel did|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on this one you need some sort of fitting length or cards, so 2C maybe not right even though this hand has more defense than the other|pg||
nt|andersk: yep|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's an easy 1@c opener|pg||
nt|andersk: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on previous hand you really only needed club jack|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: also you dont want to invite a big preempt with 2C as you will likely lose spades (unless you elect to lose clubs)|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c pretty lame...seems as 4@s had a lot to gain|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: 4S seems auto|pg||

nt|xenya: actually it looks quite logical|pg||
nt|ybob: to me impossible|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and BC Quantum comes from?|pg||
nt|xenya: well E can count on his @SQ to win a trick -- N should have both A and K on the auction|pg||

nt|andyv:  and I agree with Anders...good to have methods to show both majors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good point andy, thumbs up on that one|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes but if you dont play puppet over 1N, there is i think more upside in playing those bids as splinters with a 3-card major|pg||

nt|ralfwil: After D on 1@s, why not @c from W on 2@c?. Perhaps they could avoid 4@h and perhaps found 3nt |pg||
nt|xenya: correction: declarer can get rid of a @D loser of course, but that doesnt help as he has to use the high @Hs in the dummy for ruffing, losing a trump trick in the end |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Sry pass from E and D from W on 2@c|pg||
