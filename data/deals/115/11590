nt|athene: Right :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I must note down that @SQ lead for my own use.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: I wonder how close Gold is to 3NT on that hand?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Maybe the @CJ would have been enough.|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|athene: With the @CQ he might have done I suppose.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: @HA, heart ruff, @DA, diamond would have beaten it.|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, sorry. Perhaps not.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: Scoltock will not be happy that N ignored his x I think|pg||
nt|athene: No, there's no trump promotion once BOTH defenders have ruffed|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: well i more than think actually - he already isn't|pg||
nt|brolucius: That's right.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Certainly 5@S could have been beaten at the other table.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: So the heart lead would have won the BAM and an imp.|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|athene: Ah well - South gets his heart ruff anyway :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: South managed to show a heart void by the cunning combination of doubling 4@H and then throwing a diamond on the heart led from dummy.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|c7|pc|s3|pg||

nt|lestergold: Well normal auction here to the point at which Cooke optimistically makes a slam try|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: not really giving his partner some alloweance for bidding under pressure|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: unofrunately Erichsen decided that leading his own singleton was abetter shot than trying the ace form his 8 card suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: can declarer profit from the failure to cash @ha?|pg||
nt|lestergold: however Small sill has the problem of what to do with a lot of red suit losers|pg||
nt|jallerton: perhaps better to pitch @d and rely on @s 2-2|pg||
nt|jallerton: making 7@s 2@h 2@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: he cant really afford to burn two valuable heart tricks here|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|athene: NS don't really have the values for 4@S but with a 5-4 major fit, one tends to wander into game.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Seems that Erichsen overbid on this one. South had his 2@H bid.|pg||
mb|3H!|an|mixed raise|mb|4H|nt|athene: 3@H mixed raise; 4 trumps and a smattering of values.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course 4@S is good against their 4@H.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: Yes, perhaps Erichsen in the other room just took a two-way shot since the hand could be a double-fit, blacks vs reds.|pg||
nt|athene: He was anticipating that EW might be about to bid 4@H.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Signaling with the @SQ (requesting an underlead at Trick 2) would be the right defence is South did not hold the @CA and could then give the defenders two club tricks with a lead ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: through the @CK.|pg||
nt|athene: It could be right even if South held the @CA and not the @CJ, as a small club lead would give declarer a guess with @CKJ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|dburn: good switch, that|pg||
nt|athene: but South knows he isn't getting on lead with the second round of spades since declarer can't have more than one.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|dburn: now, if declarer finesses in hearts, another diamond will kill dummy|pg||
nt|athene: Yes, excellent diamond switch.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|dburn: so he needs to play ace and another|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|dburn: and he did - good shot|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer sees the risk and counters accurately.|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: When many defenders see an imposing suit in dummy, they panic and go active, trying to cash out, but leading the suit to cut communications can be very effective.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Still a bad board for N/S in the bidding, despite their valiant efforts in defence. |pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2D!|an|denies 3 !H's|nt|jallerton: then dec has another trick with @dQ instead of a 2nd heart trick|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|an|gf|mb|p|nt|athene: One or other contract makes a decent proportion of the time.|pg||
nt|dburn: this wasn't the right contract at the other table|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|dburn: but why on Earth did it not make?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: 5@D looks as though it should make, surely?|pg||
nt|dburn: and this is the usual dire problem for 2/1 game-forcing|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: @HA lead, spade switch in the other room.  Declarer laid down the @DA and the play record comes to a tantalizing halt.|pg||
nt|dburn: since no one has yet limited his hand, so that East has no idea whether he ought to be bidding on or not|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but the same could be true with standard bidding on these hands.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: still, if they can avoid diamonds and get to 6NT instead...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...but they couldn't|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzzh: apparently the correct closed score is 6D-1|pg||
nt|dburn: that makes more sense|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: "6@D one down" and Cooke will say "Yes, the same for us, I'm afraid." |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|athene: What are the odds of picking up this diamond suit?  You cash the @DA and then if an honour falls from South, you finesse, I guess; so you make against 2-2 or stiff honour with ...|pg||

nt|jallerton: 2@h natural FG|pg||

nt|lestergold: well in dims or spades 5 indeed the limit!|pg||
nt|jallerton: 6NT is where you want to be as chances in 3 suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: but you would have thought that with this degree of rock crushing strenth they may have finished in 6N|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course not a vey regular partnership here|pg||

nt|dburn: but 6NT had twelve on top - very tough hand to bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Three small slams make but 6@D is not one of them.|pg||
nt|dburn: which three?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|athene: 6@S not so good on the bad break.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|dburn: and 6@h beaten by a diamond ruff|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: Rixi Markus said in one of her books "if you have lots of points and more than one potential trick source, try to play in 6NT as you can survive a lot of bad breaks."|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|dburn: is this the actual defence?|pg||
nt|athene: Perhaps North was reluctant to lay down the @DA as then if partner led from @DQxx, the @DJ could be ruffed good.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: honest David|pg||
nt|athene: So she was catering for either a singleton lead or @DQxx - just not the doubleton which it actually was.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c5|pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dburn: ah well - if partner won't give you a ruff, perhaps declarer will|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|cJ|pc|h6|nt|athene: Actually, that does happen a lot - the defence don't get an 'obvious' ruff, so declarer assumes the threatening layout can't exist, and runs into the ruff anyway.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: still cost a trick though|pg||
mc|9|nt|dburn: declarer knew the diamond position - North bid the suit|pg||

nt|dburn: well, England can win another board if Cope can get out for one down|pg||
nt|athene: It doesn't look at all obvious to me, but I suppose the suit is quite good and you aren't vulnerable.|pg||

nt|athene: He probably assumed the overcall was a five-card suit?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|athene: now ruff this, trump to the @HA, and run three diamonds throwing a spade, for one down.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

mb|2S|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|jallerton: Yes, not the right time to open light on the East hand as it turns out|pg||
nt|lestergold: not everyone opens east's hand and withoutn the opening 4H may not be reached|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small may have taken a second look at the valu of his KS|pg||
nt|lestergold: but its hard not to bid a game with 14 points whenyour partner opens|pg||
nt|jallerton: declarer hopes that South will not get in again|pg||
nt|jallerton: but his @d pips are too poor|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the 4/1 heart break means that any fantasies about discarding a spade on a lonmg diamond and uffing one are also doomed|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jallerton: Is there a case for suggesting 3NT on the West hand to protect @sK?|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly is a case and i think many players would try it|pg||
nt|lestergold: unfortunaely that doesnt help here either|pg||

nt|athene: Declarer is a little short of entries to hand to finesse hearts.|pg||
nt|athene: He might bash out @HAK, hoping for @HQx.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: Copey is a Liverpool fan by the way ...|pg||
nt|athene: But he knows the @S10 won't be a dummy entry, I guess?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: so please don't mention the score|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer still seems books for several down, because North will switch to the @CQ.|pg||
nt|athene: So perhaps he just wins @SA, leads small heart.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..booked..|pg||
nt|athene: Or perhaps wins @SA, plays spade, just trying to set up three spade tricks.|pg||
nt|brolucius: My theory that 1NT is the slowest-played contract is being borne out.|pg||

nt|athene: The BAM element of the scoring is very interesting here, if you are interested in such things.|pg||

nt|dburn: one wonders quite why it was the contract - maybe East-West play Flannery|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: Gold will be thinking about what will happen in the other room - will they play 2@H?  What will happen to that?|pg||
nt|dburn: because otherwise one would have expected East to respond 1@s|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now five down on a diamond switch.|pg||
nt|athene: Gold-Townsend play Flannery, don't they?  So maybe Gold-Cope do, too.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: omg!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Makes on a low club switch!|pg||
nt|dburn: it looks as though East-West may be using the Gold-Townsend system|pg||
nt|dburn: which incorporates four-card majors, so that East chose neither 1@s nor 2@h as his response|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: Sunderland just scored against Liverpool with a shot that deflected off a balloon.  Allowed to stand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: The duck of the spade was very suspicious|pg||

nt|jallerton: Yes, "England" should read "Premier League winners"|pg||
nt|lestergold: not to mention mr. Townsend|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: The England European taem are playing (mostly) as the Gold Cup team|pg||
nt|jallerton: This is the last board of the set. Thank-you to David Muller, our excellent vu-graph operator.|pg||
nt|jallerton: Thanks also to my co-commentator, Mike Gold|pg||

nt|lestergold: well it was an exting show very frustrating for Small and Cooke thx to my excellent fellow commentator Jeffrey Allerton and thx to excellent operator andhelpful spec comments too|pg||
nt|jallerton: TGRs should pick up on this board|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps, but 1NT was actually a good save against 3NT|pg||

nt|jallerton: can have 4 spades if he has 3 hearts not suiable for 2@h (7-10)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jallerton: suitable|pg||
