mb|2C!|nt|marlowepi: this is strong but not GF|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  major suit take out will right side contract here|pg||
nt|xenya: W may well bid 3@H now|pg||
nt|xenya: rightsiding @Hs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the french cherish this part of their system, 2 strong artificial forcing openings, 2C & 2D. one can only conclude that they hold 10 times more rock-crushers than the rest of us|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: of course NS can take a few tricks in a club contract|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|3C|nt|marlowepi: 12 without a brisk cash|pg||

nt|Walddk4: from group A|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: looks like a cheap save in 4@s. Let´s see if the sacrifie had been correcy|pg||

nt|jbgood: difficult not to end up in the favourite contract of them all - 3 NT - but 5@c seems to be better|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N makes for NS on a non -diamond lead... |pg||
pc|h3|pc|c3|nt|kiwibridge: hello everyone|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: N has 8 top tricks and little chance for a 9th -- so he will run the clubs first in the hope something good happens|pg||
nt|lestergold: he can only play 3 rounds now as he needs one for a second entry to repeat the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|haans: must be lavinthal to @D|pg||
nt|ritong: it is|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|h6|pg||

nt|rnmalik: S has no choice|pg||
nt|xenya: now declarer might go wrong|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: seond heart discard may have been dangerous on a different layout|pg||
nt|xenya: now he might take the @D finesse -- seeing E has pitched 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: and mouiel would have played the queen if he had it|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: W woild love to put in a word, but the vulnerability deters him|pg||
nt|ralfwil: without a @h lead 6@s is makeable|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 6@C is cold regardless of lead|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H lead difficult |pg||
nt|Walddk4: In Minsk?|pg||
nt|haans: despite that it looks like the normal bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: looks natural to play his trump at that point|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sfoxa: yes, here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@S is better as it does not need @Sk to be right|pg||
nt|lestergold: this should make tho|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|bessi2: unlucky lead for south here |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only for 6@s a @h lead will defeat|pg||
nt|xenya: @H lead is not impossible to find |pg||
nt|rnmalik: tough decision for E|pg||
nt|xenya: actually it looks quite logical|pg||
nt|ybob: to me impossible|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and BC Quantum comes from?|pg||
nt|xenya: well E can count on his @SQ to win a trick -- N should have both A and K on the auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not necessarily best, as South needs exit cards outside the spade suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and that removed one of them|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: and there it is|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he found it!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well done|pg||
nt|xenya: so E should try to set up a trick ina side suit, and that can be only @Hs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tho there is the danger of @C ruff in 4@S|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|bessi2: but the contract is still doomed|pg||

pc|h5|nt|xenya: 4@S would have issues i think|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|lestergold: natural to play in 3n when all suits stopped and fits only a 7 carder|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: After teh @s support I prefer 6@c from N and S has to choose between @s or @c. What´s your opinion?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: even a dim lead would not have beatn 3non this kind layout|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what id @Sk and @Ca were exchanged|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what if|pg||
nt|xenya: S can see his fate -- if he ducks, he will be endplayed eventually... |pg||
pc|d7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @DJ|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sunsamvar: but he can also see that the duck will disrupt declarer's communication|pg||
nt|xenya: now 11 tricks are available|pg||
nt|xenya: true Sunil|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnmalik: 6@S a better contract slight misdefend and home.|pg||

nt|xenya: oh i missed that -- did he make?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: superficially, that is a bad result, but it would not be surprising if it was flat|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if N/S allow vulnerable interventions of south's type on a festering suit  in a fersteing hand, then north should have gone more cautiously|pg||

nt|haans: maybe 3@H is 2@S say no hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but even on this lead 3N stands no chance|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sfoxa: especially after 5-4 in majors by W, but we have comfortable chairs in our warm houses, and they have to play on the spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I haven´t got any information about nationality on NS|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: they are from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thx|pg||
nt|sfoxa: good stop of S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting double - I wonder why not 1NT|pg||
nt|haans: most bid 1nt with weaker hand but not Norway |pg||
nt|haans: have seen it before|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose it depends on the range you play for 1NT in the fourth position |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can play 9-12, 11-14, or even 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: for east to hold 3127 + not open with a club preempt nv vs vul,  well it was possible but the finesse was with the odds i believe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a club lead will make things awkward, but how can East find that?|pg||
nt|haans: only double dummy|pg||
nt|haans: had still beeen a make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, rise with @CQ|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: Murat butun gun msn de bir acmiyor gorelim hatir soralim|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Chemla can afford to bid 3N on this moderate 12 count  because opening bids in France are somewhat sounder than many play elsewhere|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double dummy there is an extra chance that the slam could also be made if the same hand holds 3 spades and four Ds and 3 clubs. so declarer might star: spade ace, club toward jack.|pg||
nt|xenya: provided NS don't do something silly later|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry was writing that before N played....that is exactly what he did and why|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: then you can find 6-2 in spades|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: 6@S might be tempting here |pg||

pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||

nt|xenya: so a nice stop|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If @h was not 5-1, 6@s had a chance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: big delay in my chat reaching the screen|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @Cj to cater for West having 4 clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 off but probably a push|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: well you need 3-2 @Ss and a finesse -- perhaps a bit more|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on the last board, the @D8 return was for sure a heart signal - West led back the @H3 |pg||
nt|mdgraham: which East obviously took as a request for another diamond |pg||
nt|mdgraham: deep waters|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|xenya: the finesse is on, @Ss are 3-2, but the @H split puts paid to the slam|pg||

nt|lestergold: defence were only due three bullets and two ruffs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 ruffs|pg||
nt|xenya: thy won't stop of 6@C now -- the question is whether they'll bid 7|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: A normal contract by a nice layout for EW|pg||
nt|haans: slam bidding much easier if 2@H promise 4 cards|pg||
nt|xenya: *short of 6@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was a courageous and imaginative defence in which he decided what to play his partner for and how to wrong foot declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: how to bamboozle declarer from taking the winning line|pg||

nt|haans: 3@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and a roland special 20/20 so watch out for fireworks folks|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Let us see how Z & B handle this misfit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure why 4H should not make. W is going to bid which shows where H queen is, and he has 2 perfectly natural leads which allow the contract to make. the only winning lead is one ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nobody would be likely to  make|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S|nt|sfoxa: board  13 is "all in red" and usually, the layout is cruel, I collect statistics |pg||
nt|mdgraham: these pairs seem quite fond of Michaels|pg||
nt|rcerreto: if I'm not mistaken, it shows @h+@c|pg||
nt|rcerreto: in their system|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah yes, sry|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: That 2@D made Ws card good|pg||
nt|sfoxa: and N's as well|pg||
nt|jbgood: I dont see how N has a good hand - he has 5 di, yes, but defensive values only|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@S likely, choices in the play |pg||
nt|haans: long way to go |pg||
nt|haans: 3@S === min|pg||
nt|ritong: bocchi might like it|pg||
nt|ritong: i would try 3@s to show balanced hand|pg||
nt|rcerreto: I think EW will be pushed to 4@s|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: yes i agree marshall they did very well to bid it|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: the 3-1 trump break is awkward, as if you draw trumps and ruff a diamond in dummy you only have a partial elimination, as dummy is out of trumps    |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A careful 3@H. To careful?|pg||
nt|jbgood: forcing|pg||
nt|sfoxa: delayed fit showing must be strong|pg||
nt|rodal f: I was a bit in my own land there. 3@C forcing|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: Forcing even in our land, Frank|pg||
nt|rodal f: U are SO correct Jon:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: must be north who considers another di support..|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaops thats why france a re leading now|pg||
nt|ritong: one more for the road|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well skywards into the valley of doom|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: oooops|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so you will have to guess clubs - and with North short in diamonds, not easy, even though South is short in spades|pg||
nt|haans: much action in this match|pg||
mb|d|nt|sfoxa: indeed???|pg||
nt|haans: stopping in 5@S?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doubt it, with East having @HA unbid|pg||
nt|haans: soon he que 5@H then W?|pg||
nt|lestergold: if a double is attractd it will be bloody|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes WD indeed to Pilon & Bompis. very hard for 2 balanced hands to bid a game in a suit contract after an opposing strong NT opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: east must be looking at the red card hopefully|pg||
nt|marlowepi: actually a spec points out rightly that even a D lead does not set 4H, ty|pg||
nt|xenya: all credit goes to Pilon for his aggressive balancing |pg||
nt|lestergold: Balicki aint happy in diamonds thats for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: zimmermanns hand get bigger and bigger|pg||
nt|lestergold: one more turn of the wheel?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, 98%. 2% must go to the dealing machine for distributing that lot when NS were vul and EW nonvul:)  that surely affected Pilon's decision:)|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||

pc|d7|nt|sfoxa: E wouldn't be happy to collect 12 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: likely:  D jack, then A, then heart jack.  E will be worried that N has heart king|pg||
nt|lestergold: best defence here to ruff small|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||

pc|h5|nt|rodal f: Only one question to come. What did the pass after 3@D mean? A risk for pass after 3@H at W?? 3@C was as we predicted......|pg||
pc|hT|nt|haans: know play @CJ will he cover?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure why. why let declarer score D ten?|pg||
nt|ahri: now he can make|pg||
nt|lestergold: however declarer is distinctly short of tricks|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|xenya: suppose he plays A and Q of spades now?|pg||

nt|lestergold: well i didnt like the ruff with JD|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and bad defence by east|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but chemla was under no pressure when he discarded a spade|pg||
nt|xenya: not so nice by Chemla|pg||
nt|ahri: that spade discard costed two tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not 3? preempts work:)|pg||
nt|mgchat: bonsoir a tous|pg||
nt|robinswr: seems reasonable to bid since you want a diamond lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am guessing 1S did not promise 5, else michel might have bid 2S, having passed 1S|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: i think the rule is that if you have nothing you bid nothing and south has nothing|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: probably a RDBL by Thomas the first round would have meant--or risked being construed as--diamond confirmation|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: easy 9 now?|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: yes take heed of pards warnings :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we promised fireworks and we got it but bnot in the way we expected it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think we can attribute that swing to the 20/20. and especially not to 20/20 vision by defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: seems EW have given away a trick or two|pg||
nt|lestergold: if you gave this hand to an exper panel and asked them how 3D doubled was made against top class international opposition no one would guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A Wald hand again:) 20-20|pg||

nt|lestergold: as specs point out the international oppsotiotn slipped a little |pg||
nt|lestergold: honest palookas definitley wouldhave beaten it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW were honest enough|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i think east shd also take the blame for giving an additional entry for the @D10.. why not cash @Da|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not palooka enuf|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure|pg||
nt|ahri: 4@h makes I think? Just North cannot use telephaty to find out S has no wasted values in diamonds|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2N|nt|xenya: first it should be played in @Ds|pg||
mb|3D|nt|xenya: but even then there might be problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 5@D+4@S+3@C=12|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Ralf, but only if declared by E|pg||
nt|ahri: *telepathy :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, as i said -- diamond jack, then ace, then heart J. i think E failed to appreciate that heart jack was a safe exit even if N had the king|pg||
nt|lestergold: he didnt use telepathy he used puntopathy|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: then the @S discard by west wd not hv mattered|pg||
nt|ahri: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but so did east not surprisingly overpunted him|pg||

nt|lestergold: how was 5c let thru in open?|pg||

nt|lestergold: this is an incredibly swingy match|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: as South is a passed hand, 3@D=@D+@S, but is perhaps overdoing it a bit... |pg||

nt|Walddk4: Did anyone notice that 5@C is cold on any defence?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sunsamvar: have a whisky like me Mike|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes they did Roland but sadly Zaleski didnt|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahri: i think|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rnmalik: but the only lead that beats 5@D|pg||

nt|mdgraham: the open room seems to be very slow - or maybe the results are not coming through|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: sure all works well and no @H lead either:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: of course, North doesn't know clubs are 2-2; if he wins @SK and they are 3-1, he can be shut out of dummy  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and if he wins @SA and theya re 3-1, he can be shut out of hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: such a great game :)|pg||

mb|2S|nt|lestergold: well has to lead ace of hearts or spade to beat!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and not that easy for west if he finds himself on lead her against 3N|pg||

nt|haans: why did they stop at 2@S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jbgood: .. to end in 4 spades just making|pg||
nt|bessi2: i believe 1h was either nat or bal hand,  1s waiting 1n 18-19, 2h transfer and so on|pg||
nt|sfoxa: or just plain transfer with nat bidding?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5C as always cold|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n maybe 4H no play 5c cold and of course they play in the  no play spot!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont know th intricacies of their system, but since 2H on the face of it looks awful i am assuming they have treatments we dont know about|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sfoxa: anyway, game is here|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: only treatment here is surgery im afraid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S has to bid over 2C, i would think 3C was the least distortion.|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you Chemla would have not been a happy sapper if his double catapulted them into 5C which it might well have done|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't see why N was S persistent about @Hs -- 3@H is OK perhaps, but why not bid 4@C next?|pg||
nt|xenya: so, not S|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jbgood: OR has reached brd   10...|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: yes well done |pg||
pc|sT|nt|ritong: because east has nada|pg||
pc|s8|nt|marlowepi: chemla had two aces and was not terribly worried about 5C. both aces will score against that too so worst case scenaio is a few IMPs away.  and after that auction chances of them ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: running to clubs have to be at least 50-1 against, maybe much higher. both opps bid hearts TWICE|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the double was a warning|pg||
nt|xenya: Chemla is not in the habit of doubling lightly?|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|lestergold: N/S taking a conservative view this time or should i say Balicki being the conservative|pg||

nt|ralfwil: If W not plays @hA he is down|pg||

nt|marlowepi: so likely to hit 45 card klength|pg||

nt|lestergold: wll what a posiiton neck und neck with all on the next board|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what a match!!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: average of over 6 IMPs per board scored so far|pg||
nt|ritong: what do you think i meant with " he was not supposed to miss"?:)|pg||
nt|rcerreto: good I don't know, effective... surely|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa: giving a loosing choice|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last board already.|pg||
nt|sfoxa: actually, there are no choice, but each attempt is worth :-)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS on the road on the last few boards  |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and this likely to be a push |pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: this may not brek the tie|pg||
mb|2C|nt|xenya: and the last board now|pg||
nt|lestergold: unlikley too|pg||

nt|marlowepi: E may bid 2S|pg||
nt|lestergold: ait a minute it will probably brak the tie|pg||
nt|lestergold: by1 imp|pg||
nt|lestergold: north on lead surely wil cash three hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and if NS save the match wont be a tie|pg||
nt|lestergold: in open east played the hand|pg||
nt|rcerreto: IMHO, when partner asks for aces you just tell how many of them you happen to have|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sfoxa: 3nt ot 4 in major? in which one?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Avalanche is booked to in by an imp|pg||
nt|ritong: he probably had a doubt|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: by more than that|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: and so to the last board of this match, thx to Elisabeth a great job on the vugraph, Haans and Mike for their great commentary, Roland and BBO for allowing us to share and to all ...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: you great spectators thank you|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: going for a svae here|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|rcerreto: yes, I guess|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jbgood: and this quick set  will finish with 4@h just making|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks tp France for giving us some great bridge, a good match|pg||
nt|lestergold: a save yes even more|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: as i said, EW may not even get to 4S|pg||
nt|lestergold: east wont let them play 4d|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: have you discussed with your reg part aboàut this?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: many thanks to our operator Elisabeth |pg||
pc|s5|nt|rcerreto: Norberto is a very clever player but when he has to remember the system... well... :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@S probably puppet to 3NT |pg||
nt|vugraphzxq: sry for all their claims !!!|pg||
nt|haans: and specs been great fun|pg||
nt|ritong: never mind E|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it has sure been that|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|nt|lestergold: oh my not even gerdoubled|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: who is saving ?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|xenya: can make 12 |pg||
nt|jbgood: guess he will take the double finesse in spades|pg||
nt|ritong: well, i m not sure to like seeing my countrymates getting ripped off|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: were and the 9th|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: if he guesses to pin the @H10|pg||
nt|ritong: noone|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well not many dull moments im exhausted|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ritong: but this set has not been boring, for sure|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|lestergold: i expect the players are everyone is|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|haans: are Madala terrific player spec ask?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: but this is not matchpoints, so safety comes first|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|ybob: thx all|pg||
nt|sfoxa: with the odds, actually|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think lack of double is not surprising at all. W cannot double, and E knows S has stiff club--meanwhile he has already invited game and W said no. N may be void of spades too. so ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why double for down 1, as a fellow commentator recently said|pg||
nt|lestergold: what a battle this was|pg||
nt|ritong: kinda mozart|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
