nt|ralfwil: Only 2@h???|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hedyg: our operator is Francois Colin, bonjour Francois:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@C is an artificial game force|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5C|nt|lestergold: hi Raif|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H is even more artificialer|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Bill|pg||
nt|pkl: I have no idea what the D means, so don't ask about the bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If S bids 5@c I prefer 5@d from W|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Hi Sabine.  I guess I'll let you make the 2@c/1@d suggestions.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: @H cheriehi all|pg||

mb|p|mb|5H|nt|h bertens: nice 800 to start with|pg||

nt|sybarra2: and an easy 3 @C here,  S hand nearly perfecto |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|h bertens: 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: still, there is the danger of getitng forced |pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW probably do best to cash @SAK and switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|jstokes: yes, and crossing to dummy to lead a club increases that danger -- but increases the possibility of making|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H actually shows diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even 3S ttypically puts enough pressure on opps in auctions like this wherethey have not made one natural bid|pg||
nt|roghog: glad you can interpret for us, Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W play, in my opinion, one of the world's most interesting systems|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: this save a bit gungho|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcmax: I am wondering why Madala did not choose a preempt at 1st opportunity|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roghog: agreed. nothing else anywhere near it|pg||
nt|haans: Fantunes system text by Daniel Neill 29 pages): http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||

pc|hK|nt|lestergold: lucky lead and it still makes a loss|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W:s hand is VERY strong in this situation, so 5@d is obvious for me and my P will bid 6@h|pg||
nt|pkl: Seems like a draw. West will play the spade ace soon to keep South out, then claim 13 tricks|pg||

nt|athene: south not a Law-abiding fellow|pg||
nt|athene: no need for lebensohl here - east is known not to have anything from his pass over 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|icesleepy:  The vulnerability keeps South low|pg||

nt|icearif: not that tempting to bid 3s there, reasonable action all players here|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|marlowepi: outbid them in any other suit. 1S allows NS to find a red suit too|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no - 5@c looks wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=804&qshowflag=1  running scores Group A|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H = 10-13 with hearts, and maybe a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: ah, here we go|pg||
nt|santyclz: Harmon Edgar points out 5@cs is there for those who bid @cs as a suit.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcmax: in any event -500 is way better than -800|pg||
nt|roghog: another fascinating idea|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@S is an enquiry, not showing spades|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|haans: long way to 9th trick|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4H was there too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|hedyg: this cannot be right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless Versace is in 5@Hx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double probably prepares for showing a value raise to 3H|pg||
nt|jcmax: Bocchi doubles 2@S here because his hand is not all about hearts. he has some constructive values and all of them outside hearts. Bidding 3@H would show a different kind of hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sabine said it better:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: no, I just used more words :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: people seldom outbid me in THAT respect:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: male and female?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: what on earth is going on here? |pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2NT denied a minor, hence 6+ hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: @S lead will give declarer the temp |pg||
nt|sybarra: *tempo|pg||
nt|pkl: 3@S is preemptive with four cards. On the actual hand, I could be tempted to stay low with 2@S|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: 2@s weak 1suiter . 5+ cards|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bessi2: that makes no sense either|pg||
nt|jstokes: better but still seems unlikely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon West bid 4@S and South 5@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then double by West|pg||
nt|bessi2: yep,  that seems plausible|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do i get to choose?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Once again, e-w's 9 card club fit was undisclosed.|pg||
nt|jcmax: It seems like declarer has to lose 11S, 2@H and 2@D tricks. Making this contract would be tough|pg||
nt|santyclz: Who cares about @cs.|pg||
nt|santyclz: See you later folks, I've been re-assigned.|pg||
nt|jcmax: see you|pg||
nt|marlowepi: see you Joe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: send a  postcard|pg||
nt|jcmax: Maala is trying to figure out a lie of the cards consistent with the bidding that would let him make his contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: To show spades, West would have to bid 2NT.  The system can at times make your head spin|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And the system is not clever enough to know that South has all the hearts, unfortunately|pg||
nt|roghog: Leader is thrown in, so only 1 down|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: It looks like this down one without any endplay|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: he shouldnt have bid so much without the 8 of diamonds (though even then diamond lead & spade back beats it|pg||
nt|pkl: Any comments from anyone are much appreciated |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure N has enough tempo to find 9th trick |pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: Easy -1 after a @h lead, but now....|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2 colors to handle here. Belive the @C will be played from N because of the enteryes|pg||

nt|ralfwil: a small @c is very clear|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|jcmax: but E could just overtake and cash the @HJ unless he was asleep|pg||

nt|mdgraham: not absloutley certain, but I think 2@D=both majors|pg||
nt|roghog: not too tough a test here|pg||

nt|sybarra: is this (mini) multi?|pg||
nt|haans: can we call it anything?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h bertens: should have taken ace of d|pg||

nt|sybarra: garbage multi  I am told |pg||
nt|Walddk4: play|pg||

mb|3C|nt|bessi2: it will take a heart lead to beat this it seems|pg||
nt|jstokes: hardly seems fair -- not only are Lauria-Versace two of the world's greatest players, they have a bid for everything |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They will cue 1st and 2nd round controls, so Nunes knows immediately that he is off 2 club losers|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: will make on a diamond lead |pg||

nt|haans: spec think suicidal is best|pg||
nt|sybarra: in 3rd seat with this vulnerability |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roghog: welcome|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Most top players cue-bid this way.  Cue 1st and 2nd round controls, and use Blackwood to check back whether you are off two aces|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|sybarra: I have some other suggestions which will remain private to me, thanks specs, ! |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like that save action  from W. Trust your partner!|pg||

nt|rodal f: He will agree with u after the board:) Or might already now.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: will make on a club lead, too|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcmax: Very tough for Bocchi here to stay out of game after partner freely bid 1@S. The question is: Did 31H confirm 4 cards in @S?|pg||
nt|haans: common in Norway to play garbage Multi + ordinally weak 2s|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s5|nt|pkl: I don't know Ralf, depends very much on your defensive style|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|pkl: But the actual pips in @C could be a warning to stay low|pg||

nt|bjacobs: No problems with the aces and kings.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: merci|pg||
nt|bessi2: i wonder what the range of 1N is,  seems strange not to try for slam with east hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: so it was a South African Texas after all, 4@C=@H|pg||
nt|jstokes: I suspect 4@C was Gerber (asking aces) and he found two missing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then it was a good idea to stop. |pg||

nt|sybarra: may need some help from defense here|pg||
nt|sybarra: or a spec rightly suggest help from supernatural powers |pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: I'm guessing, but it's common nowadays with big clubs, that 1@H shows 19+, artificial|pg||
nt|roghog: 2@c some sort of semi-positive after that|pg||
nt|roghog: 1@s is probably the double-negative|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think the defence may already have helped by not doubling|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A spec who seems like he knows what he's talking about says: 1@H could also be hearts, 2@C showed 5-7|pg||

nt|paulg:  Thanks to all who have told me that Rekstad is over ten years older ... which may explain why he expected more for 1@s|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|sunsamvar: will Nunes find the @S lead ?|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: it is between the majors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Active or passive -that's the question|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @H more likely i think|pg||

nt|icesleepy:  3@S is of course stretching a bit, but could be just as dangerous to pass|pg||
nt|ybob: i think W play @C, same -1 with @H|pg||
nt|icesleepy:  And 4@S seems very natural over 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: well there's a ruffing finesse in diamonds, but you can only pitch one loser|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe if the defence mess up, west might get himself squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|athene: let's say heart to ace, diamond|pg||
nt|athene: declarer ruffs high, draw trumps, ruffing diamond finesse, run trumps|pg||
nt|athene: and west is crushed|pg||
nt|icearif: west would feel better now if east had take ace of heart instead of direct diamond 4 back. Now not clear if ace of heart or club|pg||
nt|athene: if they want to put another diamond through they should go @HK, @HA, diamond|pg||
nt|ybob: agree|pg||

mb|2S|nt|roghog: This is the Fantunes opening that really doesn't look sound|pg||

nt|paulg:  8 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: which states that, in a slam auction, find out how many aces are missing. Subtract that number from eight, and do not bid at the level given by the answer. Also known as the Rule ...|pg||

nt|bjacobs: The 3@S bid takes away N/S's 3@D and 3@H bids.  If Nunes didn't have @C10, he would have earned a big swing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sometimes, you just don't know|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: but the points are counted out now|pg||
nt|roghog: Well, he's seen KKQ from South|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He might just get it right.  If North had started with A109x, he could play 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and he shd place @Ha with north|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a matter of who has @H9, he knows about @HA|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: in real life Nunes will probably lead a @C and def will be unable to cash the toppies|pg||
nt|ritong: and why would he|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: all no trumps and red suit games make but club lead defeats slams|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: how so, 1@s?|pg||
nt|roghog: @c lead to 10 and K. What then?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sigurjonsson had problems to fin a pass:) Nice quality|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: 2@c some relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: tough to duck the @Ca on the lead tho|pg||
nt|roghog: very true|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That will beat it, but as Sunil points out, it's quite a defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i agree that the earlier pass by W followed by a last-second 4H looks a bit like a good guess after a self-inflicted endplay. however, if most of the time the E sequence would mean ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4 trumps, then W will have decent play opposite a LOT of hands, even:  xxx  Axxx  xx  xxxx|pg||
nt|lestergold: so lead makes a difference of three tricks here|pg||
nt|paulg:  a bit of work to do here, but will probably lead the @cA from hand at some point and it will get easier|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@s forcing|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: defence may be cashing 5 clubs.. so east cannot duck|pg||

mb|2C|nt|bjacobs: Tournament website: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/09Paris/Paris.htm |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  or perhaps 4@c to show the slam intent|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: North needs to find out 3 things:  aces, @DK, @HQ|pg||

nt|bessi2: but 2n seems like an underbid to me|pg||
nt|roghog: Isn't that 4? :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One very simple way to do it is 4NT over 2@H - if partner bids 5@S (2 aces, @HQ), he can bid 5NT asking for a cue-bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: All right 4 things, you pedant :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Seriously, this is the auction you should have in SAYC:  1@D-1@H-2@H-4NT-5@H-6@H|pg||
nt|roghog: he is too embarrassed to use a simple 4NT on VG|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or something like that, anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: there are other considerations|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I guess so - eg a 3-card raise|pg||
nt|ritong: like maybe @h is not the right suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is where the French are at an advantage?  2@H would show 4?|pg||
nt|ritong: it is not really an advantage|pg||
nt|paulg:  this works okay unless partner supports hearts, and then there is confusion about trumps|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as I wrote him, but could it be any other lead left from E after the 4@C bid?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ralfwil: a lot of guesses in this contract. |pg||
nt|pkl: Guess hearts or clubs... Hearts will NOT be guessed, I guess ;-)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y, and I belive the @H will be missed so then @C are to hit. Lets see:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: North virtually endplayed at trick 1|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9 quick tricks, when @hs split give K@D|pg||
nt|ritong: it just saves the checking bids|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: well, this will make, but not a great advert for the system when a simple 1@S overcall means you can't find a 4-4 fit (unless 3@S showed hearts and West rejected hearts to play NT) ...|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|sT|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Yes, it takes a heart lead to put it under pressure|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: even on @H lead he can hope for @C to run|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Unfortunately, a heart lead is what he's going to get ... what is the % play in clubs?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do you have to play clubs at all, Bill?|pg||
nt|ritong: the % play is a try for throw in, first|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: % play in @C is to drop the q|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: someone had better bid some hearts here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What about partial elimination and throw South in with a heart?|pg||
nt|roghog: Elimination|pg||

pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: wonder why D instead of 3D by E|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 3D would confirm clubs and be a NT try|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, it works because the opponents have no choice who wins the 2nd heart ... but I guess it's worth a try, however unlikely|pg||
nt|roghog: Indeed. Costs nothing to try it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe it does not work after all as Marion Michielsen says|pg||
nt|Walddk4: South plays a 4th diamond|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So you are back to playing the club suit, and I think it's normal to bang out ace and king|pg||

nt|bessi2: but i wonder what dbl of 3@h meant.. some play it penalty and pass t/o  or no good bid,  but others play dbl as pure t/o and pass everyting else|pg||
nt|bessi2: i believe the latter is the better approach.. usually you don't get rich dbling opps in their 9+ fits|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think after 2@c they were in forcing mode and X was t/o|pg||
nt|jstokes: In a GF auction, it would be unusual to me to play it as takeout|pg||
nt|jstokes: pass works for Take out|pg||
nt|bessi2: exactly what i mean.. the general approach.. when GF dbl is pen,,, |pg||
nt|bessi2: but that pass becomes so loaded,  it just shows no penalty dbl of hearts.. |pg||
nt|bessi2: and no other convenient bid|pg||
nt|jstokes: and no ability to raise clubs or bid your own suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: That's a very interesting point|pg||
nt|paulg:  Anders tells me that even a diamond lead is insufficient, 5@c is cold|pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulg:  so a good result for NS|pg||
nt|haans: ok :)|pg||
nt|pkl: It could be played for two down - you're right|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jstokes: another big hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: i do not claim he will play the Q, i m just saying there is a (tiny) clue|pg||
nt|paulg:  well, perhaps cold is not the right description, but there is a viable line to make it :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: always good to hold a hand like the North one and see partner pass as dealer |pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: the dealer is E's friend|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but best lead of D unlikely|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||

pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: guess so|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications certainly less than ideal|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  i guess 3NT is choice of game rather than a non-serious slam try|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: odd that EW play 1@C-1N as balanced. Better for the stronger hand to become declarer |pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: if he can ruff one dim in dummy and discard one one on a club he is home just losing 2 spades and a heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: on way back to hand via heart ruffs west of course will sluff clubs |pg||
nt|lestergold: the great Bochi understandably in the tank|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Mike. |pg||
nt|lestergold: but overruffs by west will only exchange trump tricks from one form to another|pg||

nt|lestergold: now heart and heart and two clubs go from west and another finesse and ruff by west and then trump leabibg a dim loser and a trump loser|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: why not 3@d from W?|pg||

nt|lestergold: 3N yuch also probably makes|pg||

nt|ralfwil:  I had passes on that hand and let partner take action Huub|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West is in theory showing 14+, with clubs and spades, hence East's aggressive 3NT|pg||

nt|haans: in my book 4@C stronger 5@C fast arrival|pg||
nt|paulg:  me too, but with two key cards I would not wish to bid 5@c|pg||
nt|haans: yep see them|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: last making game rapidly approaching|pg||
nt|h bertens: madala looking for best game, Bocchi for best slam...|pg||
nt|lestergold: no best game only one game making|pg||
nt|ritong: it also threatens to land in 3 NT down with a cold 5/6 @cs, from nystrom's point of view|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Incredibly tricky hand on @SQ lead|pg||
nt|ritong: i therefore wonder why he did not decide to go for game and propose his @cs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: Has to win in North|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then if a club is ducked - how do you unentangle things?|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe 3@h has a conventional sense|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer doesn't know clubs are 2-2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So here GIB is really giving unrealistic advice|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Specs want declarer to take 2 diamonds, his 8th and 9th tricks - pray, what do you discard on the second diamond?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's what I was thinking of when I mentioned a squeeze on declarer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What a hand!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems so logical to retain @SK as an entry to the clubs, but ...|pg||

nt|lestergold: one more turn of the screqw|pg||

nt|lestergold: u measn not even good enuf for roland|pg||
nt|h bertens: its a good slam with the EW hands reversed :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only with @sKJ in front will make|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|bessi2: the rule here in iceland concerning closed room play and smokers is that it is ok  until 30 min left on the clock then not allowed to leave unless finished|pg||

nt|haans: and now rebid @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: reasonable double|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H ?|pg||
nt|pkl: Thanks to those who informed me that the North player, he is a she|pg||
nt|rodal f: I like better 4@H. Now he often tell some more @D at his hand. 2nd an X|pg||
nt|pkl: She is Meike Wortel. I like that name|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: She then have bidded and played as a he so fare|pg||

nt|haans: easy 3nt|pg||
nt|paulg:  interesting pass from Sementa .. I'd be thinking that I had two kings more than I'd shown although a heart less|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy to get there with stiff A of clubs |pg||
nt|sybarra: but the 1 @H bid didnt help either |pg||

nt|athene: another @S vs. @H battle here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: north might just bid 4@H|pg||
nt|icearif: many battles like that in this set|pg||
mb|3H|nt|icesleepy:  Perhaps EW push NS to 6@H here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: then we see how strongly east believes in the rule "4@S over 4@S"|pg||
nt|athene: sorry "4@S over 4@H"|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ybob: what is 3@H ?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Vugraphzxt: weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a desperate and doomed attempt to stop east bidding spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|ybob: S works to 5@H X|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: south could bid clubs to involve his partner|pg||
nt|athene: but he is on lead against spades so he decides to keep his side-suit to himself|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: redoubling there might be worth a shot actually|pg||
nt|athene: but you don't want opps to run to 5@S if it really is a double-fit hand|pg||
nt|icearif: Axxx and short spade enough for slam Kxxx could be enough|pg||
nt|athene: this hand shows why bidding "scientifically" is a two-edged sword|pg||
nt|athene: if south shows his clubs, he tells west what's going on|pg||
nt|athene: and west is less likely to double|pg||

nt|ralfwil: one board and 54 IMPs - difficult.........|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|h bertens: 4@S|pg||
nt|pkl: 6@H can win, but difficult to bid, perhaps?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: 2NT for minors? yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s making|pg||
nt|pkl: I am sure it would be easier to bid if East had the @HQ |pg||
nt|ralfwil: anyone of you for 3@s on E after 3@h from N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 5@s as well...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: needs a view or two though|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lestergold: well a vul against not phantom|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a pretty result |pg||
nt|lestergold: if west cannot find a double over 4H then east's 4S bid extremely dangerous|pg||
nt|h bertens: 5@C only 1 down?|pg||
nt|h bertens: is he thinking about it?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s may only go one down all depends|pg||
nt|lestergold: on lead|pg||
nt|h bertens: why 5C down 2?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but as 4h is one off on leading the stiff ace of spades its not good business|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2NT was not for minors, it showed a strong hand asking|pg||
nt|h bertens: normal I think.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they dont actually know the layout when they have to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4S vul against notwith a horrific suit you consider that normal?|pg||
nt|h bertens: yes I do.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too, just unlucky|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That comment applies to this board as well ... imagine N/S's spades swapped|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: vul against not affects game bonus also|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: this will make easily enough|pg||
nt|ralfwil: of course a 6-card suit, but too weak in my opinion|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: i wonder whether pass over 5@s was forcing|pg||
nt|pkl: Ohhh... 3@S certainly is an option. 4@S might be a good contract.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: it  is veryunlucky but sometimes you have to allow a preempt to stand- it could be even worse|pg||
nt|roghog: Indeed. An aggressive 2@s by E|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: I think it will be forced to|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|paulg:  everything very friendly on this deal|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes but a challenge to play |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: i want a better suit quality rest of hand ok|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you will make usually 4S facing   Qxxx  xxx  x  Kxxxx  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s is also only -1 with the right play|pg||

nt|ralfwil: @h to @h A and @sJ...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: sorry  meant  stiff diamond in 2nd ex|pg||
nt|lestergold: and north will kill the club suit|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: like here - has to play @HA, really|pg||
nt|pkl: So a few consolation IMPs to Iceland, but far from enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: At vul against non vul. Bit to bad quality at the @S. Belive pass is OK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: but to agressive when nonvul?|pg||
nt|paulg:  "colours are for children" seems to be the way in all aspects of the game nowadays|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: and to all the specs for their useful comments|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ends quietly but there were several wonderful boards in that set|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: one thing worth noting - in twenty boards, the Italians have conceded only one major swing, and it took a slightly abnormal opening (2@S on a five-card suit) to generate it  |pg||
nt|hedyg: but really a lousy slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they are really hard to beat at the table|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 19 will be a swing too?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could be.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If E had playes one more @s N is squeezed to discard a @h and after that a @dQ from the hand N must win and exit with what?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: yes Raif a difference of two ricks but how often do we see a player in a horrible contract gho off even more than he had to|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|bessi2: amen,  i thought 1N was limited and he would surely bid 4h there not 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: since 4@c denied @s control E would not cuebid @d without @s control|pg||
nt|jstokes: big club, so 1NT may not be all that limited|pg||
