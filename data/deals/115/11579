mb|4C!|an|good pre-empt in !H|nt|athene: I thought it was normal to lead the ace unless you knew it was in declarer's (or dummy's) long suit.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: Of course that's a lot more appealing at MP where you might just be trying to hold the slam to 12 tricks.|pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|nt|brolucius: Leading aces was popular decades ago because the bidding was so awful that you might have two tricks off the top.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Similar bidding at both tables.|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C showing a strong 4@H opener.  I prefer to use 3NT for that purpose (as in the other room).|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: Oh dear - @SA face up lead out of turn (no screens)|pg||
nt|athene: That means West can bar a spade lead  - and North can't just lead a top diamond and then *switch* to a spade, am I right?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to imagine how it can cost, though.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: I will relay the penalty choice|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: Spade lead requested|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: It seems that 5@S would have made (with the fortunate diamond position), although no-one had a chance to bid it.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: What about a heart force against 5@S?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|athene: Declarer runs out of trumps before he can set up his club trick, doesn't he?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|s6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Seems so, if West started with four spades.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s3|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: He can tackle clubs first and leave a spade in dummy to hold the hearts, maybe...but that's a bit double-dummy.|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|h5|pc|d5|pg||

nt|vugraphzzg: lots of Q s from Carroll|pg||
nt|ady: 4@C and 4@D  may hav e been some sort of cu bids    perhaps the opening could be stronger than it is|pg||
nt|viren169: Carroll is just waiting to see where they end up before trying 4@S|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzzh: nasty|pg||
nt|athene: Interesting use of double after the spades have been bid-and-raised.|pg||
nt|athene: I would have thought the "standard" agreement was that double is penalties after you have found a fit.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: Priday's two bids seemed OK at the time.|pg||

nt|athene: Declarer must be 6-4.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: maybe5-5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: Sure, but either way, the diamond loser is going away.|pg||
nt|brolucius: West must take the @DA. Ah, he has done. Well defended.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: Anyone prefer 2NT rather than 3C?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h3|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C looked OK to me.|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT is possible if you think it shows 6-4 where 3@C would be 5-5.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|h8|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|c4|nt|athene: But perhaps North thinks the failure to use Michaels/whatever has already denied the 5-5 shape.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|s8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|brolucius: That would be a bit fancy for this pair. Bernard plays a fairly simple system.|pg||

nt|brolucius: If East says only 2@D, they may miss game.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: OK - here we see the alerted 2@C rebid which I was (vaguely) deducing earlier.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: But it isn't so alertable - just could be 5-4 or 4-5; so I am still a bit puzzled about that 2@H response.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's pass also made it difficult to reach game. Embarrassing when the result is -690 at the other table.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: bernard gave 2H a look i think |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: East is worth 3@D if he knows his partner has 5+@D 4+@C.  But certainly he can't risk the 3-level if they might have only a 4-3 fit.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: So here we see the ambiguous 1@D-2@C sequence costing quite a lot.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: a rather poor game though|pg||
nt|brolucius: Twenty years ago, or so, I partnered Priday in the Lederer. I was a bit nervous and he was very tolerant.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even though I was over 40, he insisted on calling me 'Young David'.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: Someone asks me if this is THE Tony Priday from way back when.  I believe so.|pg||

mb|3S|nt|brolucius: If declarer can set up two diamond tricks, avoiding a ruff or losing control, he can make 4@S. But the 4-1 break in trumps makes it very unlikely.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|nt|athene: Interesting lead decision for East.  Trump or @C10?  @DK is an outside choice.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: @DK not attractive when you hold four trumps. Anyway, I heard a very strong player recently speaking against leading from a king-high suit. On BBO, I think it was.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|athene: Interesting that Silverstone chose 2@C in this position as East, rather than a negative double.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|brolucius: North's game try was a bit ambitious at the other table,since South had raised directly (showing a fairly weak hand) rather than via a cue-bid.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|brolucius: As on the previous deal, Priday seems to be taking control of the bidding - expecting his partner to be bidding somewhat conservatively.|pg||

pc|c9|nt|athene: Well, I approve of the 2@D opener.  In m experience it works very well to open weak-2 bids with 4 in the other major.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good of him to forego the Spanish sunshine to play in this event.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I agree, Bill.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|brolucius: We are lucky to have Steve Eginton as out VG operator. He will no doubt explain the bidding when he notes that the commentators are struggling.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|athene: I suppose if declarer managed to lose all his trump losers, South might end up getting squeezed in the majors|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: Priday is doing his best to break up the position, but he has just played his last major-suit card.|pg||
nt|athene: Actually the simpler route to one down is just win @SK and exit a trump here - North can take his three diamonds but is then endplayed to concede a club trick.|pg||

mc|7|nt|brolucius: Yes, there were several lines to only one down but declarer stepped onto a different track.|pg||
nt|athene: My guess is declarer didn't imagine that it was South who held the four spades - or perhaps he just doesn't want to waste too much effort on turning -100 into -50 :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: The latter would have been my general approach.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: "Perhaps that was a bit wet of me" quoth Priday|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Priday had doubled, declarer would no doubt have made the effort to get out for one down, with the same result.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|athene: Yes and it would have cost South thirteen tricks of terror... since he didn't have any defence|pg||
nt|athene:  - certainly not the "glint of steel" you are supposed to have for a weak-2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Reese used to say that a weak-two opening should contain a 'glint of steel' - in other words a card that would prove useful in defence.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Snap!|pg||
mb|2H|an|7-11 5!H+4+!C|mb|p|nt|athene: Interesting that they devote the 2@H response to exactly this hand.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H seems to be a weak jump shift. Yesterday we saw the same sequence being used to show a two-suiter clubs and diamonds (opposite an opening of 1@C or 1@D)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: "A pre-empt known to be weak is a blunt weapon" was a quote of Reese's i believe|pg||
nt|brolucius: West may bid 4@H, expecting a six-card suit opposite.|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H is 5@H4@C - it might seem strange to show this, but my guess, is, they do it so that responder can bid 1@H and then later use 2@C as a relay|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|brolucius: 5@H and 4@C?!  What a strange idea. Dreamed up in a haze of smoke from some strange cigarette, it seems.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: Or perhaps they do it so that if East simply responds 1@H, West can use 2@C rebid artificially with less fear of missing a club fit.|pg||
nt|athene: After all, 2@C bids in the modern game never show clubs.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That's all a bit convoluted. If East holds only four hearts, he might have four (or even five) clubs.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: Yes but EW play Blue Club - style don't they?  So 1@D tends to deny a 4-card major and hence responder tends not to show 4-card majors.  I might be babbling nonsense of course.|pg||
