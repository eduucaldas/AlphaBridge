pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ducking D in preparation for overtrick via 2 heart finesses, assuming W has 5 Ds|pg||
pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: will attack clubs, then hearts--but this would lose if W has led from tripleton|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade queen's early appearance will bring in uptrick anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and 2 uptricks if E misreads position and throws a spade|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not easy with stiff hart|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: dont like this bidding by east|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: agree, stiff heart is na nhuge defensive asset. he should double--cant be huge spade stack so W will be well placed to decide|pg||
nt|roswolf: and didnt doubling 3@S come into the picture|pg||

mb|2H|nt|roswolf: bid all round the houses and end up in 4@H no doubt|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: Believe the score is 17-40 now unofficial|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6@H tempting but no entry to dummy for the trump finesse|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This will make the match tighter as in Closed they bid to 7@C went 2 off. 6@C a better contract than 6 @H of course|pg||
nt|rodal f: 7@CN11 in OR here and 17-40 so fare. Unofficial|pg||
