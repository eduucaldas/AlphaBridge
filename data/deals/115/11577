mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Hello Mike! Nice to see you again!|pg||

nt|haans: Both teams need a good win|pg||
nt|sybarra2: bet we hear 3 @C from N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Only 2@h???|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hedyg: our operator is Francois Colin, bonjour Francois:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@C is an artificial game force|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|lestergold: hi Raif|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H is even more artificialer|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Bill|pg||
nt|pkl: I have no idea what the D means, so don't ask about the bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If S bids 5@c I prefer 5@d from W|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Hi Sabine.  I guess I'll let you make the 2@c/1@d suggestions.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: @H cheriehi all|pg||

nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://tinyurl.com/539d3g|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and an easy 3 @C here,  S hand nearly perfecto |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|h bertens: 500|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mdgraham: still, there is the danger of getitng forced |pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW probably do best to cash @SAK and switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|jstokes: yes, and crossing to dummy to lead a club increases that danger -- but increases the possibility of making|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H actually shows diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even 3S ttypically puts enough pressure on opps in auctions like this wherethey have not made one natural bid|pg||
nt|roghog: glad you can interpret for us, Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W play, in my opinion, one of the world's most interesting systems|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lestergold: this save a bit gungho|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: I am wondering why Madala did not choose a preempt at 1st opportunity|pg||
mb|5N|nt|roghog: agreed. nothing else anywhere near it|pg||
nt|haans: Fantunes system text by Daniel Neill 29 pages): http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No artificial forcing opening ... just a lot of natural ones, 1@C, 1@D, 1@H and 1@S|pg||

mb|6C|nt|lestergold: lucky lead and it still makes a loss|pg||

nt|feffo: hi all, hi Roland and tks|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: W:s hand is VERY strong in this situation, so 5@d is obvious for me and my P will bid 6@h|pg||
nt|pkl: Seems like a draw. West will play the spade ace soon to keep South out, then claim 13 tricks|pg||
nt|pkl: Yes - Wests hand is almost to good.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Peter Koch Larsen|pg||
nt|pkl: Hello all|pg||
nt|feffo: hi Peter, wlc|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no - 5@c looks wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=804&qshowflag=1  running scores Group A|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H = 10-13 with hearts, and maybe a minor|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: ah, here we go|pg||
nt|santyclz: Harmon Edgar points out 5@cs is there for those who bid @cs as a suit.|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcmax: in any event -500 is way better than -800|pg||
nt|roghog: another fascinating idea|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@S is an enquiry, not showing spades|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|haans: long way to 9th trick|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4H was there too|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|hedyg: this cannot be right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless Versace is in 5@Hx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double probably prepares for showing a value raise to 3H|pg||
nt|jcmax: Bocchi doubles 2@S here because his hand is not all about hearts. he has some constructive values and all of them outside hearts. Bidding 3@H would show a different kind of hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sabine said it better:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: no, I just used more words :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: people seldom outbid me in THAT respect:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: male and female?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what on earth is going on here? |pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2NT denied a minor, hence 6+ hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: @S lead will give declarer the temp |pg||
nt|sybarra: *tempo|pg||
nt|pkl: 3@S is preemptive with four cards. On the actual hand, I could be tempted to stay low with 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@s weak 1suiter . 5+ cards|pg||
nt|feffo: mmmmmmmmhhhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bessi2: that makes no sense either|pg||
nt|jstokes: better but still seems unlikely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon West bid 4@S and South 5@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then double by West|pg||
nt|bessi2: yep,  that seems plausible|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do i get to choose?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Once again, e-w's 9 card club fit was undisclosed.|pg||
nt|jcmax: It seems like declarer has to lose 11S, 2@H and 2@D tricks. Making this contract would be tough|pg||
nt|santyclz: Who cares about @cs.|pg||
nt|santyclz: See you later folks, I've been re-assigned.|pg||
nt|jcmax: see you|pg||
nt|marlowepi: see you Joe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: send a  postcard|pg||
nt|jcmax: Maala is trying to figure out a lie of the cards consistent with the bidding that would let him make his contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: To show spades, West would have to bid 2NT.  The system can at times make your head spin|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And the system is not clever enough to know that South has all the hearts, unfortunately|pg||
nt|roghog: Leader is thrown in, so only 1 down|pg||
nt|pkl: Difficult to find the club lead after D - now 11 easy tricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: still, it allows our imagination free rein :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Francois is a new operator :)|pg||
nt|h bertens: after d for tke king he could cash ace of c and play q of spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now we check their non-slam bidding|pg||
nt|rodal f: A better bid Ralf|pg||
nt|pkl: I would - after seeing all four hands|pg||
nt|feffo: strange for Fantoni|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|h bertens: then he wins|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This will likely be the last appearance on BBO vugraph for Vilhjalmsson and Sigurjonsson. After Dec 31 our new rule will be enforced. People with surnames longer than 10 characters ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: will not be allowed to ...|pg||
nt|milton_se: quite an aggressive double|pg||
mb|p|nt|jstokes: and it's not that easy :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so the 2@S opening shows a profit there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed it isn't|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he will learn quickly :) courage Francois!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not absloutley certain, but I think 2@D=both majors|pg||
nt|roghog: not too tough a test here|pg||
nt|haans: that 2 is weeeeeeeeak|pg||
nt|sybarra: is this (mini) multi?|pg||
nt|haans: can we call it anything?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|h bertens: should have taken ace of d|pg||
nt|jcmax: Sementa apparently did very well on board 1 in the other bringing hme 3NT with an overtrick after a @S lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: garbage multi  I am told |pg||
nt|Walddk4: play|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@d first and perhaps a D later to show @c|pg||
nt|dima:  Looks like German pair plays weak NT and 4-card majors ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Walddk4: Same applies for Schollaardt of course|pg||
nt|pkl: Brøndum bid 2@C in the open room.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Tell his story|pg||
nt|rodal f: E a bit more careful here contra the OR|pg||
nt|pkl: A most sensible rule - and I've heard they will also disallow any players with a 4-letter word last name.|pg||
nt|dima:  So we get some action here|pg||
nt|milton_se: will East be able too keep his spade entrance?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bessi2: it will take a heart lead to beat this it seems|pg||
nt|jstokes: hardly seems fair -- not only are Lauria-Versace two of the world's greatest players, they have a bid for everything |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They will cue 1st and 2nd round controls, so Nunes knows immediately that he is off 2 club losers|pg||
nt|dima:  I dont think so - if South gets a count signal on a herat play he will know hearts are likely to be 4=2=2=5 around the table|pg||
nt|feffo: in OR 5 @D by Versace, lead @C and down|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: will make on a diamond lead |pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|haans: spec think suicidal is best|pg||
nt|sybarra: in 3rd seat with this vulnerability |pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: if not, the 10C will be valuable|pg||
mb|p|nt|roghog: welcome|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Most top players cue-bid this way.  Cue 1st and 2nd round controls, and use Blackwood to check back whether you are off two aces|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|sybarra: I have some other suggestions which will remain private to me, thanks specs, ! |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like that save action  from W. Trust your partner!|pg||
nt|pkl: A most sensible 2@D and still a blood bath for EW. Sometimes stuff just happens |pg||
nt|rodal f: He will agree with u after the board:) Or might already now.|pg||
nt|dima:  upside down count I suppose by NS|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: will make on a club lead, too|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|jcmax: Very tough for Bocchi here to stay out of game after partner freely bid 1@S. The question is: Did 31H confirm 4 cards in @S?|pg||
nt|haans: common in Norway to play garbage Multi + ordinally weak 2s|pg||
pc|sK|nt|milton_se: and now?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pkl: I don't know Ralf, depends very much on your defensive style|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pkl: But the actual pips in @C could be a warning to stay low|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: he can claim now|pg||
nt|milton_se: good def|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: Corretion: STRIK3R: nope, not common to play garbage multi anymore|pg||
nt|haans: only in 3rd|pg||
nt|dima:  So herats have been killed for a moment|pg||
nt|milton_se: should go at least one down now|pg||
nt|dima:  Specs honor fine effort by South|pg||
nt|dima:  So Declarer has now 2@s + 2@d + @cA, might endplay South for 6th trick|pg||

nt|dima:  Maybe North should have cleared @s trick for his side ...|pg||
nt|milton_se: y a spade we needed|pg||

nt|dima:  well WAS an entry|pg||
nt|milton_se: endplaying pard isn't popular :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes not much fun in this post mortem I reckon|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Good afternoon to Paul Gipson|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: or not...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: N/S's turn|pg||
nt|feffo: 1nt 12-14|pg||
nt|pkl: 4@S can't win as EW can get a club trump or a trump trick. |pg||
nt|feffo: 3 imp's more for Denmark|pg||
mb|d|nt|roghog: another non-slam that isn't too demanding|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|haans: we had some talk from specs here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Paul,  welcome |pg||
nt|haans: yes Hi Paul|pg||
nt|pkl: A lot of play looks obvious when you can see all four hands. In real life you can only see two.|pg||
nt|pkl: I also play a weak 1NT but feel slightly uncomfortable in third hand vulnerable|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: oh dear, G****r - don't tell Roland|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my, what is happening here?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H by West, of course...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Francois?|pg||
nt|hedyg: vraiment 4@H par S?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No problems with the aces and kings.  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Not often you see the same contract made by NS and EW on the same hand at this level|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: merci|pg||
nt|bessi2: i wonder what the range of 1N is,  seems strange not to try for slam with east hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: so it was a South African Texas after all, 4@C=@H|pg||
nt|jstokes: I suspect 4@C was Gerber (asking aces) and he found two missing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then it was a good idea to stop. |pg||
nt|bessi2: ahhh.. yes.. i think you're right|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT might well be 13-15|pg||
nt|feffo: me too Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|pkl: Personally I often find that to be one to many|pg||
nt|rodal f: No trancfeer|pg||
nt|pkl: That is not the position where I upgrade 11 points ;-)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: Lindqvist to blame|pg||
nt|paulg:  is Rekstad older than Lindqvist?|pg||
nt|sybarra: may need some help from defense here|pg||
nt|sybarra: or a spec rightly suggest help from supernatural powers |pg||
nt|feffo: :)|pg||
nt|feffo: 5 @C by Lauria in OR|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: I'm guessing, but it's common nowadays with big clubs, that 1@H shows 19+, artificial|pg||
nt|roghog: 2@c some sort of semi-positive after that|pg||
nt|roghog: 1@s is probably the double-negative|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think the defence may already have helped by not doubling|pg||
nt|dima:  At the level of 1NT it does happen :) but you meant another level :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A spec who seems like he knows what he's talking about says: 1@H could also be hearts, 2@C showed 5-7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another flat board|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mcarroll: a couple of overtrick imps to EW|pg||
nt|milton_se: just then?|pg||
nt|milton_se: ten|pg||
nt|dima:  If NS go passive it will be a push|pg||
nt|pkl: 3@S is an easy winner; against 5@C you must take the three first tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: So then 3@C some sort of Stayman|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So in summary ... no one is playing SAYC at this table!!|pg||
nt|roghog: Perhaps we can convert yhem :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: good luck with that ...|pg||
nt|roghog: @c gives the 9th trick, so it's just about overtricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: think you are right Paul |pg||

nt|feffo: maybe now we have a match|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: oops|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oopsing all over the place.  Board 3 ... board 4|pg||
nt|roghog: perhaps we can convert them after all....|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks to all who have told me that Rekstad is over ten years older ... which may explain why he expected more for 1@s|pg||
nt|pkl: It now comes down to the play in clubs. It is one or two losers - if West ducks the jack, East might get a trick on the @C9|pg||
nt|pkl: We will see - it certainly will be a swing. |pg||
pc|c9|nt|bjacobs: true!|pg||
nt|dima:  looks like 10 tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sunsamvar: will Nunes find the @S lead ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well this is real ugly if Nunes hits on a spade lead|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: it is between the majors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Active or passive -that's the question|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @H more likely i think|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roghog: difficult - you know partner has very little|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|dima:  weak NT making an appearence|pg||
nt|milton_se: will South go for a minor-suit slam?|pg||
nt|sssvablue: EW can save in the minors if they get involved, and will be pleased to find they make 6|pg||
mb|3S|an|ask for singleton|nt|hedyg: 1NT for EW is 14-16|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 10-13, spades, could have a minor ...|pg||
nt|dima:  That is the kind of hand where people bid 3@h to show GF with @h shortness without 4@s|pg||
nt|pkl: They might find that their save was an underbid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcmax: I wonder how high Madala is planning to bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  Slam on a 2-2 trump break?|pg||
nt|haans: how many would have bid only 2@S?|pg||
nt|pkl: South has a perfect hand for 4@H. How could North ever know?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Surely S is not thinking of anything except Game over a weak NT?|pg||
nt|dima:  2NT is surely some Multiway something- does anyone know the meaning?|pg||
nt|pkl: 3@S asks for singleton. But why?|pg||
nt|feffo: after 3 @S i don't think Stan|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roghog: This is the Fantunes opening that really doesn't look sound|pg||
mb|4N|nt|bjacobs: It's not sound, I suppose, but it puts considerable pressure on the opponents|pg||
nt|roghog: Must gain more than it costs, I guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play constructive raises  so 2 @S for me|pg||
nt|dima:  Rather brave 3@h by Wrang|pg||
nt|milton_se: well, not more than a good D fit and an outside ace will do|pg||
nt|dima:  Now take your money|pg||
mb|5H|nt|h bertens: now we know|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Presumably they have found the minors, now they may get pushed to 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: What do you think about 3@c from W instead of 2@s, showing a @c-suit and a 3-card @s support?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd show a limit raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|paulg:  8 losers|pg||
nt|pkl: Will East bid on? I certainly would bid!|pg||
nt|feffo: in OR 5@H by Lauria|pg||
nt|sssvablue: And NS have a good Red/White save in 6@H :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well spotted Stan, red/white, the Danish colours|pg||
nt|pkl: An excellent result for Italy in the open room|pg||
nt|feffo: very interested situation now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: which states that, in a slam auction, find out how many aces are missing. Subtract that number from eight, and do not bid at the level given by the answer. Also known as the Rule ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: of Eight |pg||
nt|hedyg: great dummy|pg||
mb|5N|nt|bjacobs: You can see how West might well be guessing over these openings ... the two level openings definitely roll the dice|pg||
nt|dima:  Specs suggest both minors with the follow-up showing shortness (now available per inference)|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: STRIK3R: so 2@h would have shown 12+ and @h or 3-7 and @s, think they play it like, that not sure|pg||
nt|paulg:  Easy to say looking at the hand, but 4@h is an imprecise slam try|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I vote for @dQ as a lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would have been the best here buy I belive Q@C is a normal one:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: but|pg||
nt|pkl: The @DQ sets 4@S, but I would also have led the @CQ|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|bessi2: i feel east must dbl 2c with that shape at that vulnerability|pg||
nt|feffo: push fantoni|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: all cards sitting well for him, can make this|pg||
nt|sssvablue: If EW stumble into 7, North better lead a spade|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcmax: you mean i suppose. But that may not be part of their system.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Now the @H7 gets a ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roghog: It has to be there, though, to make a complete system, as Goran reminds me|pg||
nt|pkl: Anyway - this lead is just as good|pg||
nt|pkl: ... just not anymore - but who can blame East?|pg||
nt|pkl: Ouch - I´m babbling right now|pg||
nt|dima:  I think if you overcall 3@h on those hands partner better watch his steps about raising to 4 level|pg||
nt|pkl: Lots of imps to Italy here. Lets see how many|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|pkl: So thirteeen tricks - anyone now what that is in imps?|pg||
nt|sssvablue: If my math is right the overtrick doesn't cost an IMP|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: i think E remembers that his pd passed 1@s and is lying low|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, it's not THAT different from a weak two, as a lot of people play them.  Just a different point range|pg||
nt|sssvablue: 15 IMPs|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: West might have responded 1NT (if that would be natural)|pg||
nt|bessi2: but they play strong club so pass can have some hcp easily|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: I thought he might upgrade that hand to a 1@S opening ... but no|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|rodal f: If @S8 was at N.... Then enteryes enough for use the @D there|pg||
nt|dima:  that @h 7 is worth a lot of IMPs|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|sunsamvar: how do they handle a 8 point 6 card major ?|pg||

nt|pkl: I received several interesting links. One is http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||
nt|sssvablue: The Danes continue to have a very good set, with one glaring exception|pg||
nt|pkl: ... which describes bidding by EW|pg||
nt|feffo: now is better Peter :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcmax: That will feel like a very good result for Italy|pg||
nt|sybarra: another slam |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: ok so strong @c it is|pg||
nt|paulg:  are we back at the goulash event?|pg||
nt|haans: very easy to bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: no wasted values in the @C suit |pg||
nt|pkl: Westra in the open room was a bit more cautious as West - perhaps Sigurjonsson was helped by his system?|pg||
nt|pkl: 2@S Michaels - 5 hearts and a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|pkl: ... sorry - it is spades and clubs|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|roghog: Lauria Versace overboard next door. Can the Swedes do better?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You can all guess what 3@C means ...|pg||
nt|roghog: anything but @C|pg||
nt|dima:  So now EW kann sniff around for a slam|pg||
nt|pkl: EW 3NT? |pg||
nt|feffo: i supposed|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Was 2@s weak or muiderberg?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hedyg: they might be playing ice-relay precision|pg||
nt|jcmax: There seem to be a lot of competitive doubles in this match. |pg||
nt|h bertens: does not easy to bid 4@H after this start|pg||
nt|h bertens: does not soud like english.......|pg||
nt|h bertens: sound|pg||
nt|lestergold: west could have shown extras by a redouble and east may have upgraded holding Ks over the overcall|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, that would be, so, SAYC'ish|pg||
nt|sybarra: not short suit bid |pg||
nt|paulg:  probably showing some non-minimum|pg||
nt|sybarra: which might have helped both pard and defenders here|pg||
nt|haans: think 3@C min and then steps|pg||
nt|pkl: Can Wortel resist that one? I would not|pg||
nt|dima:  Is 1NT 14-16?|pg||
nt|feffo: is a weak in Denmark system, correct Peter?|pg||
nt|pkl: So... how easy is it to set? 3@C indicates hearts, I guess. A tad more difficult now?|pg||
nt|pkl: 2@S is weak - can be five cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I now like 3@d from E|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: actually it is only the @C suit quality that is the problem in a slam|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: now cue bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: West's hand is looking very good here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: If West could have scraped up a 3@D bid East surely would bid game, but not so easy to visualise game with the W hand|pg||
nt|h bertens: wel done|pg||
nt|roghog: A penalty double. Heard our recommendation!|pg||
nt|sybarra: or shape?|pg||
nt|milton_se: apparently|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i am told just strong @c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they might have found a few more bids in that case|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: imps for the Swedes here|pg||
nt|rodal f: N have a auto 4@S now but will W lead @HK?|pg||
nt|pkl: West must play low when South leads a club.|pg||
nt|dima:  Controled stop|pg||
nt|dima:  Without @d lead Wrang will be happy to see @s finesse fail|pg||
nt|milton_se: 6 is only on a finesse, though|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: Francois tells me they play precision|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No swing - they play 3NT in Open|pg||
nt|feffo: very interested board|pg||
nt|pkl: 2@S is exactly five spades and 7-11|pg||
nt|pkl: South needed to lead a heart - or the @DA and switch to hearts. |pg||
nt|sssvablue: Thanks very much to the knowledgeable kibbitzers who have been a great help so far|pg||
nt|sssvablue: It would appear that the line is difficult, but almost all lines will lead to success |pg||
nt|sssvablue: with both red aces onside and the 10@c dropping doubleton|pg||
nt|feffo: ya, but all us knows Fulvio, this board will be finish in 1 hour more or less :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: well, E was not far off a 2S bid last time. but i am not sure if 3D is a better call than D|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sunsamvar: if the defence does not touch @H they could get it many down|pg||
nt|haans: and B|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 sp asked for singleton I am told |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: very likely W needs something different for a RDBL in their methods|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sunsamvar: lol|pg||
nt|dima:  Well without @d lead it is better then finesse, I think @s AK + @s to the J ...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pkl: ... it doesn't really matter. Always ten tricks, I guess|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: Well it was a good comment - maybe North might have played 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|ritong: or @h A and a @h|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, Henri, he develops a heart ruff that way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, the @HA and another is the way to get 800, as the hearts can be played succesfully with dummy's two entries|pg||
nt|ritong: the difference between 500 and 800 is not huge, imp speaking, with the result other room 2 imps or so|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: True Bill as a hundred specs tell me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yeah, specs can be like that :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but Henri it could mean a 10 imp swing if the Italians were only in game in the other room|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: sry 8 imps|pg||
nt|paulg:  At the club West would have bid, but the Italians like a stronger hand for their 2-suiter overcalls when vulnerable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Here is a classical duck from W when s plays @c towards dummy. otherwise S has 2 discards|pg||
nt|rodal f: If so there are 1 @H and 2@D loosers. Even 10 by a @HK lead. 3 @Ds run |pg||
nt|pkl: Duck and EW has three diamond and one heart trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: one trick to win and 2 to loose. But this time it does not matter|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. The @D8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Sry Did´nt see the @d8 so a duck was essential|pg||
nt|pkl: I first overlooked the @D8, I do not believe that 4@S wins if W ducks the club|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think the italians did anything wrong here ... at this level, you have to disrupt big club auctions|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not 10|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|roghog: Well, if partner is sticking his neck out with 2@s, you risk chopping it off with 3@s, I suppose|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The 3@S bid takes away N/S's 3@D and 3@H bids.  If Nunes didn't have @C10, he would have earned a big swing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sometimes, you just don't know|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: True Bill. Nunes was betting the opps had slam|pg||
nt|roghog: always, in my case|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gioffi: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: I missed it 2 Ralf:)      :(|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: It's a mysterious game.  Watching it on VuGraph demystifies it a little, but you also discover that no-one can play the perfect game|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: Fortunately|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @S q shd have been ducked i think|pg||
nt|roghog: Still has an entry to play @h from dummy|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|lestergold: no risks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Tough play here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good play|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but the points are counted out now|pg||
nt|roghog: Well, he's seen KKQ from South|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He might just get it right.  If North had started with A109x, he could play 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and he shd place @Ha with north|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a matter of who has @H9, he knows about @HA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So technically, finessing here is playing for North to make a mistake|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pkl: We all missed it, it seems|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dima:  wins vs. singleton, Qx or Q onside any length|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|d4|nt|sunsamvar: true Bill he can easily place north to have a109x|pg||

nt|marlowepi: but i agree that W could have done something over the double. probably not that likely that EW have a game, and there is some danger in getting to a no-play 4H if W bids freely ...|pg||

nt|ritong: sorry, sometimes can t help|pg||
nt|haans: 7@C not very cheap|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: lol|pg||
nt|dima:  and here too :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|milton_se: looks like a 2-way club and transfer|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pkl: What to bid as South? How probable is slam with a passed partner?|pg||
nt|dima:  Transfer I suppose , constructive raise from South, no slam interest by West|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|ritong: although if west does not cash @hs immediately..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in real life Nunes will probably lead a @C and def will be unable to cash the toppies|pg||
nt|ritong: and why would he|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: all no trumps and red suit games make but club lead defeats slams|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ritong: how so, 1@s?|pg||
nt|roghog: @c lead to 10 and K. What then?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sigurjonsson had problems to fin a pass:) Nice quality|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@c some relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: tough to duck the @Ca on the lead tho|pg||
nt|roghog: very true|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That will beat it, but as Sunil points out, it's quite a defence|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: i agree that the earlier pass by W followed by a last-second 4H looks a bit like a good guess after a self-inflicted endplay. however, if most of the time the E sequence would mean ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4 trumps, then W will have decent play opposite a LOT of hands, even:  xxx  Axxx  xx  xxxx|pg||
nt|lestergold: so lead makes a difference of three tricks here|pg||
nt|paulg:  a bit of work to do here, but will probably lead the @cA from hand at some point and it will get easier|pg||
nt|sssvablue: action double by S|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@s forcing|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: defence may be cashing 5 clubs.. so east cannot duck|pg||
nt|pkl: That 1@H was lead-directing, I presume|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive the same but cost a trick|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Hopefully for the Danes the action won't be 4@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|pkl: In the open room, Westra also directed a heart lead|pg||

mb|p|pc|c9|nt|bjacobs: They play an usual system of opening leads ...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bjacobs: That shows either an odd number of clubs with an honour, or an even number of clubs without an honour|pg||
nt|ritong: visibly, the bell rung in fulvio s mind|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Definitely, but there's not much to go on|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: with a better hand N would have cuebid over 3@s|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ritong: nunes doubled 1@c, then he might try for 4 @h tricks|pg||
nt|milton_se: another push -- low scores|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: am told:  Bocchi - Madala pair reached and made 6@s on  5|pg||
nt|sybarra: as we can see in the OR here|pg||
nt|paulg:  currently Duboin can see 7 tricks with endplay possibilities for an 8th|pg||
nt|haans: not the best slam ever :)|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|sunsamvar: def cant get the @C ruff AND the @Dk as east will be declaring the 4@H contract|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4@H was a fine contract in the other room ... here the Italians cannot go wrong, as they have put @DK on lead|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt is a dicey contract|pg||
nt|dima:  was 4@c Blackwood in clubs?|pg||

nt|bjacobs: You mean they don't have the tools to find out about the missing @HQ?|pg||

nt|roghog: not sure if the raise is always 4|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt a make if play spade finesses|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D reverse|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@c, natural and forcing looks a good start here|pg||
nt|pkl: I would not play D as Lebensohl in this situation, but who knows?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Tournament website: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/09Paris/Paris.htm |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  or perhaps 4@c to show the slam intent|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bjacobs: North needs to find out 3 things:  aces, @DK, @HQ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And now things are even better for the Bamberg team|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: lost the @H suit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not yet|pg||
nt|bessi2: he will surely bid 3h now|pg||
nt|jstokes: 3N is OK too|pg||
nt|bessi2: but 2n seems like an underbid to me|pg||
nt|roghog: Isn't that 4? :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One very simple way to do it is 4NT over 2@H - if partner bids 5@S (2 aces, @HQ), he can bid 5NT asking for a cue-bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: All right 4 things, you pedant :)|pg||
nt|ritong: moi?:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so none of the above Paul |pg||
nt|haans: 4th suit or anythink but GF|pg||
nt|pkl: And I mean Lightner, of course. |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Another 11 imps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: very friendly layout hee for E/W|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ritong: they will probably discover @h Q is missing|pg||
nt|haans: did the 4th suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: makes sense,   and then now can find the trump suit |pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: Seriously, this is the auction you should have in SAYC:  1@D-1@H-2@H-4NT-5@H-6@H|pg||
nt|roghog: he is too embarrassed to use a simple 4NT on VG|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or something like that, anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: there are other considerations|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I guess so - eg a 3-card raise|pg||
nt|ritong: like maybe @h is not the right suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is where the French are at an advantage?  2@H would show 4?|pg||
nt|ritong: it is not really an advantage|pg||
nt|paulg:  this works okay unless partner supports hearts, and then there is confusion about trumps|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as I wrote him, but could it be any other lead left from E after the 4@C bid?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: a lot of guesses in this contract. |pg||
nt|pkl: Guess hearts or clubs... Hearts will NOT be guessed, I guess ;-)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y, and I belive the @H will be missed so then @C are to hit. Lets see:)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: North virtually endplayed at trick 1|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pkl: A reasonable contract: wins if diamonds come home. They just don't today|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: 9 quick tricks, when @hs split give K@D|pg||
nt|ritong: it just saves the checking bids|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, this will make, but not a great advert for the system when a simple 1@S overcall means you can't find a 4-4 fit (unless 3@S showed hearts and West rejected hearts to play NT) ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  |pg||
nt|lestergold: at least diamond never cost a trick|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like some sort of Turbo here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: however, this is 13 for azzurri|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s5|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h8|nt|ritong: yes, 12|pg||
nt|ritong: they played in @ds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Back to 13.  Very unfortunate for the Swedes who OBVIOUSLY knew what they were doing and paid the price|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, 13|pg||
nt|haans: 5nt-7?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bjacobs: You really should be able to call the match referee and get the imp result adjusted on the board|pg||
nt|ritong: come on|pg||
nt|ritong: there is a gambling part in the game|pg||
nt|bjacobs: nope.  I am offended by this result|pg||
nt|roghog: You should get moral IMPs|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: but they do|pg||
nt|sybarra: obviously @C's are trump to S |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|roghog: So a good but unlucky player could be a Moral Grand Master|pg||
nt|ritong: afterwards, it goes " we did OK, but the b....ds called a dubious grand"|pg||
nt|haans: just playing now?|pg||
nt|pkl: So what to do in clubs? NS in the other room guessed correctly, it seems|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|paulg:  South can hardly be better here, but concerned that partner only has four hearts and there is a pointed loser ... 6@d is a nice bid|pg||
nt|pkl: I can't see any guidance here. What about you? |pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: nowday 5nt to not ask for KING but ask to show a K|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D = @DK|pg||

nt|bjacobs: You would expect 3@H to have made in the OR ... but the defence was machiavellian|pg||

pc|s3|nt|lestergold: communications not great either|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|marlowepi: opps may defend differently--and to their advantage--if you only invite|pg||

pc|s4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: 4@s some kind of last train?|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely 4@s implies @d control|pg||
nt|dima:  That is a fight :)|pg||
nt|dima:  I would rather use 4@d overcall to show reds if W opens 2@s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Seems obvious to lead @S, which will force  declarer and control will be a major issue|pg||
nt|dima:  @s shift now?|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s7|nt|hedyg: anybody know if they play turbo?|pg||
