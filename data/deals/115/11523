nt|davidstern: 3NT here for N/S looks easy|pg||
mb|1D|nt|davidstern: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is in the Hinden team|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: some teams should be looking to Europe for some new blood- maybe get a few stars on Bosman|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|jallerton: I'm not in any team in this League, Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh|pg||
nt|davidstern: So N/S seems play weak 1NT opening so 2NT rebid shows 15-17|pg||
nt|davidstern: They dont have a Division 3 for you geoff|pg||
nt|jallerton: 15-19 more common in England|pg||
nt|davidstern: As noted rules are here http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League_information.html|pg||
nt|davidstern: Sorry Jeff|pg||
nt|roswolf: no i am not in london any more - prefer the south coast!|pg||
nt|jallerton: when playing weak NT|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Warmer south|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a great sucess one must say. Two divisions, organised by Nick Sandqvist|pg||
nt|roswolf: Brighton has reputedly the best weather in the UK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 16 and 5-card suit; Mayo should accept|pg||
nt|davidstern: Like most bridge tournaments which are successful they simply (and I say this jokingly) need a dedicated organiser who knows what they are doing|pg||
nt|jallerton: Brighton can't compete with Sydney though|pg||
nt|davidstern: simply = jokingly|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: ?????|pg||

nt|vugraphzwf: some debate about 5NT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Mayo kicked the ball back to partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: It would have probably been OK if South was declarer on a club lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: the only problem with 15-19 is that it is a wide range, best to play some system such as 3@c enquiry in my view|pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: kicking more now|pg||
nt|roswolf: true Australia is wonderful but is it true you wont be able to climb the Coathanger?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: 5NT described as pick a slam|pg||
nt|davidstern: I havent heard about that but am checking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Franklin did not realise that 5NT is not a slam :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I can't after that lead|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|roswolf: well -2 seems likely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The double of 2@D is questionable|pg||
nt|davidstern: spade lead won by Ace and declarer played a low diamond from hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: What sort of hand should it show Roland?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Then @S10 ducked to declarer's jack and lost 2 spades 2 diamonds and a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond continuation looks ok|pg||
nt|odysseus69: whats wrong with the double of 2D Roland? |pg||

pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: having passed 1 spade he was now showing long diamonds and a desire to compete |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Whose fault is it? East's?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: He should have known that he does not want a diamond after his double?|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|odysseus69: the double enabled East to bid 3D and double 3 hearts- the only fault was the failure to double|pg||

pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: An honour, surely|pg||

nt|jallerton: @cK lead, declarer may now plan to take @H finesse|pg||
nt|jallerton: but Qx onside this time so can hardly go wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes over weak nt it is almost obligatory to overcall with any 13 cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you bid with 5-4 in the majors. Do you show spades?|pg||
nt|jallerton: North passed with 13 cards.  Did he miscount?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i normally do if i have room but this is one of the areas where serios partnerships have thorough agreements|pg||
nt|roswolf: serious|pg||
nt|jallerton: DIfferent pairs play different ways, Roland.  I normally anchor to the shorter major, which at least means that you get to the right strain|pg||
nt|odysseus69: those who play this seem to be divided- some anchor to weaker major - others (including me) to stronger|pg||
