nt|Walddk4: from group A|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: looks like a cheap save in 4@s. Let´s see if the sacrifie had been correcy|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make after S has shown a black 2-suiter|pg||

pc|s7|nt|Walddk4: North is  Magnusson|pg||

nt|rnmalik: depends entirely on @D play|pg||
nt|ybob: run trumps @S to K and @D to dummy = home|pg||
nt|jbgood: difficult not to end up in the favourite contract of them all - 3 NT - but 5@c seems to be better|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N makes for NS on a non -diamond lead... |pg||

pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: N has 8 top tricks and little chance for a 9th -- so he will run the clubs first in the hope something good happens|pg||
nt|lestergold: he can only play 3 rounds now as he needs one for a second entry to repeat the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|haans: must be lavinthal to @D|pg||
nt|ritong: it is|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|xenya: on second thoughts, the save looks cheap enough|pg||

nt|xenya: now declarer might go wrong|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|lestergold: seond heart discard may have been dangerous on a different layout|pg||
nt|xenya: now he might take the @D finesse -- seeing E has pitched 2 hearts|pg||

pc|d4|nt|xenya: W woild love to put in a word, but the vulnerability deters him|pg||
nt|ralfwil: without a @h lead 6@s is makeable|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 6@C is cold regardless of lead|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H lead difficult |pg||
nt|Walddk4: In Minsk?|pg||
nt|haans: despite that it looks like the normal bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: looks natural to play his trump at that point|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sfoxa: yes, here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@S is better as it does not need @Sk to be right|pg||
nt|lestergold: this should make tho|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bessi2: unlucky lead for south here |pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: only for 6@s a @h lead will defeat|pg||
nt|xenya: @H lead is not impossible to find |pg||
nt|rnmalik: tough decision for E|pg||
nt|xenya: actually it looks quite logical|pg||
nt|ybob: to me impossible|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and BC Quantum comes from?|pg||
nt|xenya: well E can count on his @SQ to win a trick -- N should have both A and K on the auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not necessarily best, as South needs exit cards outside the spade suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and that removed one of them|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: and there it is|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he found it!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well done|pg||
nt|xenya: so E should try to set up a trick ina side suit, and that can be only @Hs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tho there is the danger of @C ruff in 4@S|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bessi2: but the contract is still doomed|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: natural to play in 3n when all suits stopped and fits only a 7 carder|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: After teh @s support I prefer 6@c from N and S has to choose between @s or @c. What´s your opinion?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: even a dim lead would not have beatn 3non this kind layout|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what id @Sk and @Ca were exchanged|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what if|pg||
nt|xenya: S can see his fate -- if he ducks, he will be endplayed eventually... |pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: good play here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: @DJ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sunsamvar: but he can also see that the duck will disrupt declarer's communication|pg||
nt|xenya: now 11 tricks are available|pg||
nt|xenya: true Sunil|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@S a better contract slight misdefend and home.|pg||

nt|pelu: But I am just going for the CC - they are not partners this season - but played together for 2-3 years before|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: South will not lose a club now, as he can take the ruffing diamond finesse  |pg||

nt|snorris:  now there is a slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I am asked why South did not open 1NT. Because they play weak NT (12-14), so 15-17 balanced hands are opened 1x, and 1NT rebid shows 15-17|pg||
nt|snorris:  sh...|pg||

nt|petergill: I'm not sure if there is a way for the defence to convince declarer to mispick @Ds|pg||

nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can play 9-12, 11-14, or even 15-17|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bessi2: for east to hold 3127 + not open with a club preempt nv vs vul,  well it was possible but the finesse was with the odds i believe|pg||

pc|cA|nt|lestergold: Chemla can afford to bid 3N on this moderate 12 count  because opening bids in France are somewhat sounder than many play elsewhere|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double dummy there is an extra chance that the slam could also be made if the same hand holds 3 spades and four Ds and 3 clubs. so declarer might star: spade ace, club toward jack.|pg||

mb|1N|nt|sunsamvar: a spec says --maybe they play 2NT as a natural bid , so 3@C must become Jacoby 2NT|pg||

nt|haans: here a good slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: most fascinating this defence badgered declarer into avoiding the spade finesse so was very effective|pg||
nt|lestergold: cannot knock a defence that beet this contact when it wa laydown as cards lie|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to see how the 5 could hurt even playing that--in fact it would be easier to read as from 3 than the 4-spot is|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa: EW will find their way to 3nt, nothing special|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: I thought declarer had a chance after playing all the @C should have AJ@D, the N hand would be squeezed|pg||
nt|sfoxa: oops!!!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lucky on 6@C as 3nt somehow failed too|pg||
nt|lestergold: when Balicki declined to ive opartner the marked seond dimaond ruff taking a chance in so doing he kcould probabbly see that giving the ruff at that time would have let the ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: contract through- this defence showed why they are world class players in spite of the occasional wild bid made|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: How was the contract on previous bd laydown Mike ?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: it;s a cold slam|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lestergold: he could have evenbtually entered hand with a heart ruff and finessed the spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, they do tend to pay attention to their trick target at this level and defend accordingly, yes|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|haans: and off they go|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just seem the movie - North ducked two spades, then led @CK from hand. Not a success on the actual layout |pg||
nt|lestergold: defence were only due three bullets and two ruffs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 ruffs|pg||
nt|xenya: thy won't stop of 6@C now -- the question is whether they'll bid 7|pg||
nt|pelu: not so cold|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: A normal contract by a nice layout for EW|pg||
nt|haans: slam bidding much easier if 2@H promise 4 cards|pg||
nt|xenya: *short of 6@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was a courageous and imaginative defence in which he decided what to play his partner for and how to wrong foot declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: how to bamboozle declarer from taking the winning line|pg||
nt|xenya: and i'm told the other rable is in 7|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: is 5@S asking for kings ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty easy to reach, one would think using splinters and KC|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect 4D was KC|pg||
nt|lestergold: you have to count 13 tricks i dont think everyone gets there thaty easily|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sunsamvar: well he can count 12 tricks with 2 @D ruffs... but needs the @HK or @Sq for the 13th|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly not easy at all|pg||

pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: isnt that a five card heart suit in dummy?|pg||

nt|aldek: the question of discipline, there are hands which require a deep analysis|pg||
nt|pelu: the winning play : a small @C from dummy is not so diff to find - but easy for us|pg||
nt|petergill: Roald's point is very good. Most of the very best players in the world can identify that a hand like the previous one requires deep analysis at the table, not in the post mortem|pg||
nt|pelu: i9n CR West open 2@S = 7-11 and 5 card @S , 3@S from N (@H+minor) and 3NT|pg||
nt|aldek: Right, you can't think all the time|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: Fantoni left the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Germany on a roll against Sweden. 35-8 after 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: and fantoni comas back|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|petergill: After a heart lead to the king, the club switch at the other table solved declarer's problems|pg||
nt|cuan: 2@S from danish in both tables|pg||
nt|pelu: look at 3Nt in S - in CR @H lead and easy make, men try on the lead of @s3 to 9 - now a very diff contract|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT has four top losers, and only 8 top tricks (inclduing 3 hearts), so is in danger|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But if they arrive in 3NT, North will be declarer|pg||
nt|pelu: here 2@S = 7-10 and normal 6 card suit|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|an| |mb|p|mb|3H|nt|pelu: 3@C = I have only a 5 card suit (in @s)|pg||

nt|pelu: ??? 3@H = F1|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maybe Denmark should not be on vugraph. They were the only team that wasn't shown in the RR and played well, but now ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: Roland is disapointed|pg||
nt|petergill: EW play Slavinsky (Slawinski) Leads - low pip = even number without honour, or odd number with honour. High pip = the other two possibilities. So @D6 and @C6 are possible leads.|pg||
nt|cuan: but 3@H after 2NT isn't forcing ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe it's their way of inviting; we don't know|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ritong: inviting with north hand is really pessimistic, no?|pg||
