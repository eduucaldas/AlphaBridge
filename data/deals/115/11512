nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Or then again maybe he picked his worse|pg||

mc|7|nt|davidstern: And will likely fail by one trick and 2 imps to Real|pg||
nt|davidstern: Nope failed by 2 so flat board - we have had three flat boards so far including the 7@C bid/made|pg||
nt|mug: good morning|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi Tom|pg||
nt|davidstern: We can wish Tom all the best on his recent fatherhood|pg||
nt|mug: ah thank you|pg||
nt|mug: more than makes up for missing my visit to Moscow to play Goulash|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think you need to revisit your priorities|pg||
nt|mug: very disciplined preference to 2@S by Igor Churlin|pg||
nt|davidstern: Anyway Moscow would be closer to the baby - no?|pg||
nt|davidstern: He did what he had to - bid his better major|pg||
nt|davidstern: mythical one anyway|pg||
nt|davidstern: So -1|pg||
nt|davidstern: for a flat board|pg||
nt|mug: it's Mr Gladysh's tournament, and he said he had the majors, better play in one :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Tick|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am guessing we will resume in about 5-10 minutes for the last five boards to decide the winner|pg||
nt|mug: the expert Goulash players in Moscow are very disciplined, ready to shut up shop very quickly on a misfit|pg||
nt|davidstern: It is called experience|pg||
nt|davidstern: And once bitten|pg||
nt|davidstern: On the hand where they played 3NT going -3 they also got he @HQ lead and East did better and ducked in the CR|pg||
nt|davidstern: See you in 10 minutes|pg||
nt|davidstern: So 4 flat boards which would be a new record at Goulash|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: hi guys !Q |pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh my goodness.  An actual fit!|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back to finals of goulash |pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Tom |pg||
nt|mug: hi Denis|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello Denis |pg||
nt|mug: sorry I can't be here this year but this is the next best thing|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Welcome all :)|pg||
nt|shevek: hi Denis|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we will lots of wild hands  |pg||
nt|sybarra: as in this one |pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: E probably not really pleased with that lead |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: good morning Shirley!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: the "leaping bids"  will start soon |pg||
nt|sybarra: starting out "normally" |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes not too unusual|pg||
nt|mug: problem is that South has opened quite light, North may need some restraining|pg||
nt|sybarra: put leash around his neck?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: This is the semifanal of NN-CUP-2009|pg||
nt|shevek: in OR west bought it in 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: You can find the results here: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
nt|mug: 4NT now to show the diamonds?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mug: this is Goulash from moscow, mixture of IMP and BAM scoring|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is interesting i was once told when in doubt bid game instead of slam and partscore instead of game when hands were goulashed|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
nt|sybarra: how do they score it? |pg||
nt|mug: noone's going to be leaping too high here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: we play patton|pg||
nt|mug: West will probably settle for an invitational bid|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: no X  lets not give the  hand away |pg||
nt|mug: South will sign off, void in partner's second suit is not good |pg||
nt|mug: quite right shirley, double of 4@C would be criminal, they're all much too canny for that|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7@ds might be a touch better than defending 4@s.|pg||
nt|mug: Sester was speechless, so am I now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|shevek: at goulash doubles are for blood|pg||
nt|shevek: even if before length|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: thought he might crash into 4 @S |pg||
nt|mug: partner is almost certain to be void in spades after 2@C|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably a sound start|pg||
nt|mug: to be honest I think 4@S was a wild overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: gm Denis |pg||
nt|sybarra: a brutal hand to begin with |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: this is a final of the goulash tournament in Moscow|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes folks it is 609 am for me |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: the final consists of the 2 segments (5 boards in each segment)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c2|nt|mug: you should expect two trump losers with the broken spade suit|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|shevek: 3NT asking for another suit|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Traian Chira|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: is that where "we" want to be?|pg||
nt|mug: very far away|pg||
nt|sybarra: so does E lead a @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or more passive @D? |pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: losing 2@H and 2 @S?|pg||
nt|mug: must try to give partner a ruff somewhere|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to be @C |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: I'm afraid no|pg||
nt|bebechira: hello everybody...and hello Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Traian |pg||
pc|cT|nt|shevek: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
nt|mug: personally at Goulash I like to show both suits with one bid, opening or overcalling|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzzb: the current score of this match is 11:9|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|mug: North is in a lot of pain|pg||
pc|d8|nt|shevek: well, north would have done better (maybe) to pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Luks has just tried to escape|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bebechira: these goulash tournaments are fantastic !|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is 6 am for me  I wanted to see the final |pg||
nt|bebechira: Zmudzinski-Tuszinski ....interesant pertnership|pg||
nt|sybarra: is Zmud the same as the one who plays interenatioanally ?   cant remember his usual parrd's name |pg||
nt|bebechira: Balicki|pg||
nt|sybarra: right |pg||
nt|sybarra: I have operated when they were at the table |pg||
nt|bebechira: yes...very famous partnership|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Balicki is enjoying the birthday of his wife as far as I know )|pg||
nt|sybarra: makes sense|pg||
nt|bebechira: they came to Australia for the NOT 2 years ago|pg||
nt|sybarra: they were in the USA of our Nationals in AUg. |pg||
nt|bebechira: fantastic players|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: should you double in principle most contracts?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mug: not necessarily Geoff|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought he might  try ace and a @H?  now maybe |pg||
nt|roswolf: yup cant see too many trcks|pg||
nt|mug: now is good|pg||
nt|mug: North would like to duck @H3 but not possible :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dQ|nt|bebechira: good defence by Adam... |pg||
nt|bebechira: and very good initial pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: and notice N did not try to r|pg||
nt|sybarra: *rescue|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.msc.com.pl/cezar/?s=&mycl=0&tmt=4&p=43 3rd and 10th best from Poland :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: the moment Adam passed they were in trouble|pg||
nt|sybarra: W= 3rd and E=10th |pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: draw dummys trump yes seems best|pg||
nt|shevek: there are of course different rules for this game|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|shevek: - only five-card suits may be bid|pg||
pc|c7|pc|hT|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|shevek: - 12-15 hcp balanced hands (IF you get one!) are passed rather than opened|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mug: three more tricks for EW, down five|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably -5|pg||
nt|bebechira: -1 and next|pg||
nt|sybarra: E is stuffed in|pg||

nt|davidstern: I dont think it can make Geoff|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry i see now thought lack of a trump lead was fatal to defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is a tough lead imo|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d3|pc|hA|nt|davidstern: heart lead win ace and play trump. Maybe on a spade lead it is possible win ace ruff heart spade pitch heart and diamond pitch heart|pg||

nt|sybarra: E hates his hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: you can find the current results of the tournament using the following link: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
nt|shevek: 11 card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: double in front of partner should be a very firm message|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah a 4nt bid for north|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont think in goulash that is right  |pg||
mb|2S|nt|shevek: reminds me of a story Ron Klinger once told:|pg||
nt|santyclz: Don't lead a @s.|pg||
nt|shevek: when he started playing bridge in his uni years his mates set him up|pg||
nt|shevek: dealt him 13 spades; in 2nd seat he thought would be a good idea to pass,|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: yesterday we could see 12 card suit )|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: how ever it is good for 6 @D  little does he know  |pg||
nt|mug: he hates his hand but it is quite useful for his partner|pg||
nt|roswolf: well east has some offence|pg||
nt|shevek: since faking a sacrifice might attract a double (and rdbl)|pg||
nt|bebechira: open room played 3nt.... this contract should be banned in goulash tournaments|pg||
nt|sybarra: its more than just the BAM,  they also IMP the board also   |pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: wow!!!  look at N hand!!!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and who need BW anyway??|pg||
nt|mug: East will bid 7@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Nord has an ordinary hand in Goulash )|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe should have walked it up?|pg||
nt|mug: creepy crawly doesn't work in my experience|pg||
nt|sybarra: you have played there,  so you should know |pg||
nt|mug: and anyway North is far from guaranteed to make 7@C|pg||
nt|mug: he needs South to have @SA, and to avoid a spade ruff|pg||
nt|mug: this way East is put to the test|pg||
nt|sybarra: and that is a consideration  (the ruff that is) |pg||
nt|mug: BIG consideration Shirley|pg||
nt|roswolf: but even goulashes obey the laws of probability - dont they?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Easts pard did not announce a great hand! |pg||
nt|sybarra: actually geoffrey from watching,  they are very disciplined  |pg||
nt|mug: but West's bid showed a long suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: or commenting last couple of years,  (I should say) |pg||
nt|roswolf: would a prolonged pause and pass impose any ethical problems on west|pg||
nt|mug: yes you're right Shirley, the best players are very conservative and very disciplined|pg||
nt|mug: good to use the jump shift to show a solid suit, setting trumps|pg||
nt|shevek: BUT they all passed so he threw his cards to be redealt|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: 12 cards in club and Ace of spade )|pg||
nt|shevek: when his partner asked him "what did you have?" he said "only 10 points!|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: likely 6@S BY NORTH?|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually overstated that one,  6 @D does not make |pg||
mb|3D|nt|shevek: will the 10-card suit holder buy the contract??|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lol!|pg||
nt|mug: now South can cue @SA and North can jump to 5@C to say that he needs the red aces|pg||
nt|mug: they do it differently|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: EW can make a few tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@s all pass?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think e-w can make 10 tricks in either pointed suit.|pg||
nt|shevek: no prize for that Joe|pg||
mb|3N|nt|shevek: a specs suggests 7@c by south - too late for that :)|pg||
nt|shevek: you have to predict the final contract :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5@dx.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: partnership trust is very important|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow!!! |pg||
nt|sybarra: restraint |pg||
nt|roswolf: HMMMM unexpected|pg||
nt|mug: I think South owed North 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|sybarra: S owed something |pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: good bidding by all|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have a way to say it in US,   "this tourney is a hoot"  (hoot= entertaining, fun etc) |pg||
nt|mug: certainly is|pg||
nt|mug: we did terribly but had a really great time last year|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump lead best|pg||
nt|mug: at the 5-level North was right to shut up shop, his suit is far from solid at this game|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: perhaps for 5this tourney only you should be allowed to bid at the 8 level as in the old days|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11 tricks on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont know how else to explain Patton |pg||
nt|sybarra: well there you go,  the "banned"  bid |pg||
nt|shevek: non-@h lead?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: would you do it again Tom?|pg||
nt|bebechira: :)|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: oh , this will go down on a @H lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: W fell to the @H lead since N bid his other suits |pg||
nt|sybarra: brilliant.....|pg||
nt|bebechira: i said ...it should be banned|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: incredible , 4@C is the max you can make|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: it looks like -3|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mug: was planning to come this year but circs intervened|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bebechira: they should know they have very few chances for making 3nt |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mug: at least they didn't double 5@D although that probably won't help their score much|pg||
nt|santyclz: Right as usual|pg||
nt|shevek: when you don't have transportation to dummy, only chance is to endplay the opponents, BUT...|pg||
nt|sybarra: if S held Ax of sp...totally different story |pg||
nt|dan_hohor: you loose 2@H and a club   |pg||
nt|mwigor: 6@c makes on a non-@h lead|pg||
nt|shevek: 3NT also|pg||
nt|bebechira: :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzzb: it should go down|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mug: the rest of my crew is playing|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: poor S doesnt have a club to lead :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: 7@c from the other table|pg||
nt|sybarra: other room almost walked it up |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes after a straightforward ordinary type auction|pg||
nt|mug: South should be DD here|pg||
nt|mug: his partner must have 12 clubs|pg||
nt|mug: hard to explain some of these calls|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mug: it won't matter, big winning board for his team|pg||
nt|mug: although a trick went there, poor defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: only -4|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@s maybe was a bad idea...|pg||
nt|mug: East must lead something red now|pg||
nt|shevek: south trusted pd|pg||
nt|mug: should find a winning lead, North did bid 3@S|pg||
nt|mug: but North didn|pg||
nt|mug: but South's AK are in North's void, what else has he got for partner?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Psychic q's are also fairly frequent in ghouly.|pg||
nt|shevek: rules of this game are completely different|pg||
nt|shevek: - 12-15 hcp balanced hands (IF you get one!) are passed rather than opened|pg||
nt|shevek: - preemptive openings are forbidden;|pg||
nt|shevek: i.e.  a high-level opening bid denotes the exact number of tricks the hand possesses|pg||
nt|shevek: - use of conventions is reduced to a minimum, as opponents will often interfere taking away the bidding space|pg||
nt|mug: actually the organisers allow any system you like Nicoleta|pg||
nt|shevek: - doubles behind the length are for penalties, where they would usually be for take out|pg||
nt|shevek: forcing pass too?|pg||
nt|mug: some pairs play very natural, others play very scientific|pg||
nt|shevek: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
nt|mug: that's part of the fun I think, trying out your new ideas against the other players' ideas|pg||
nt|mug: some pairs have very well worked out specialist Goulash systems|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: pairs who wants to get the money ))|pg||
nt|mug: we want to get the money one year too Denis, the problem is we're not good enough yet :)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: another @H and does E win and push it back?|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: any lead , cash A @S and then AK and a @C and the opps have to open the H . If you guess you may make 5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: didnt have to |pg||
pc|d2|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: bah  q of clubs!|pg||
nt|mug: sorry that's not true, defence was fine|pg||

pc|d8|pc|s6|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dan_hohor: sorry 4 |pg||
nt|sybarra: thought Zmud might pitch the @H |pg||
pc|s4|pc|d5|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|shevek: yet another flat board|pg||
mc|6|nt|dan_hohor: on a spade lead you can not make more than 4@c|pg||

nt|vugraphzzb: the last board of the segment|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: are you allowed to psyche in this event or is it frowned upon|pg||

nt|shevek: stage 1 of Q they played in 4 groups, winners went to group A, losers to group B|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: last bd,  and we come back in about  5 min  |pg||
nt|sybarra: or so |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: we will continue in about 10 minutes|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mug: but I think psyching would be foolish|pg||
nt|shevek: with repechage matches to get back in the QF:|pg||
nt|shevek: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
nt|shevek: prize money US$9,000|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: we glad to see your team in Moscow :)|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: ty all, very funny :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok 10 min then |pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: double tends to be a two-suiter|pg||
nt|mwigor: win @sA ruff @c cash @sk @dA pitching last @h as east ruffs with his trump trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: doubt you need to, pard may take you seriously |pg||
nt|mug: this double is probably not penalty|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how to get to @S here,  notice that E did not bid |pg||
nt|mug: North can clarify now with 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: TOO COMMITTAL|pg||
nt|frankaus: what did they feed the dealing machine - rat poison?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: its a goulash tourney Frank |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: so if 2 suiter  does he bid 6?|pg||
nt|roswolf: finis|pg||
nt|mug: I don't think North will like his hand, @CKx looks sick|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: interesting contract|pg||
nt|shevek: is this a general invitation Denis?  |pg||
nt|mug: improved on 2007, quarter-finals this year, the boys said 8500 played perfectly against them in that match|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: it is truth|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: so pass is in order |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm some interesting tactics could arise eg 4@H BY NORTH INSTEAD OF 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you see,  "WE" dont X |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: in QF we play 2 segments. Each segment consist of 5 boards.|pg||
nt|mug: sensible bidding|pg||
nt|shevek: in this cade south's dbl was takeout, because he already showed his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: yes, all participants have been invited by Eugene Gladysh|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: imo,  this is such a great lesson to play goulash |pg||
nt|mug: I don't think it has much in common with bridge, the point is that it is good fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: great comment tom|pg||
nt|sybarra: my thought on that would be..........for students (I dont teach) think about what you heard in bidding,  and think about what the hands could be|pg||
nt|mug: North probably considered a trump lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: double ruffing finesse brings in a few tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: E to try for the ruff |pg||
nt|mug: higher than you'd like to be but they will get away with it this time|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard sometimes holds a trump |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm not today|pg||
nt|shevek: north chose to pass....|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe trumps are not so good for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzb: yes but what North can chose?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: I think the double was too optimistik|pg||
nt|shevek: hard to support partner with void :)|pg||
nt|shevek: Bd 2 same contract and outcome in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: the double should show extra value which South doesn't have in his hand (in goulash game)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so we expect these deals |pg||
nt|sybarra: and would be disappointed if anything less |pg||
nt|dan_hohor: :) Frank fall in the same trap I did|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: :)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mug: always on the shortlist when you have one|pg||
nt|bebechira: tuszynski worried he might miss 6 spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we are watching one of the great goulash players Zmud  (plays all other games well also) |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzb: it looks like the saldo has been lost by the SPACE MUTANTS|pg||
nt|sybarra: what is sald?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *saldo |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: it is a patton|pg||
nt|shevek: this board won't be flat|pg||
nt|shevek: was about time|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes....|pg||
nt|shevek: who knows what's going to happen if they have a tie|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4 flat boards (IMPs)|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|dan_hohor: actually 6@s might make , A@C club ruff and play on diamonds|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mug: West will hardly expect the clubs to lie so well |pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 more hands after this |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Tom what did you do re systems,  when you played?  strong 2's?|pg||
nt|mug: the English team plays 2C thru 2NT as limited two-suiters, covering all combinations except the minors|pg||
nt|mug: 4NT is the minors|pg||
nt|mug: one bids show good hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok,  dont give away all secrets |pg||
nt|mug: 29 IMPs is nothing|pg||
nt|sybarra: so this is patton?   so we have imps and bam (or is it matchpoints)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: correct|pg||
nt|mug: just try and nick an overtrick on the last two boards and the Mutants will fine|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @S and hit the deck everyone |pg||
nt|bebechira: brd 15 won by REAL at BAM|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: this is the first segment only|pg||
mb|6S|nt|shevek: declarer would have done better not to duck|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzb: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: he would have Jx left in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: he could get the contract|pg||
nt|santyclz: They didn't get to 7@ds in the other room either, but at least they got them into the auction and made 5 +2.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: 3NT we used to play as Blackwood, but this year the boys are playing it as a 10-trick major-suit hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzb: no|pg||
nt|shevek: true Traian|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: 10 total points is 1:1|pg||
nt|bebechira: i see|pg||
nt|bebechira: so 10 points halves the point|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mug: modified IMP scale though, right Denis?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no clue how to explain patton  (someone else on my team keeps score) |pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzzb: correct )|pg||
nt|sybarra: patton is not played in the US,  I played it in Neth.   and loved it |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mug: think he's gone off, playing for North to have a short club honour|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer may run out of control here|pg||
nt|mug: some pairs in Moscow have very detailed specialist systems|pg||
nt|sybarra: for specs,  none of these systems are permitted in "normal" tourneys   |pg||
nt|mug: our system would be permitted in normal tournaments, but it would be absurd :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh fair comment |pg||
nt|sybarra: just trying to point out,  this is very "specialized"  tourney/systems etc |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but the fun factor should be predominant|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes  I envy Tom for playing it |pg||
nt|mug: the event is played in very good spirits|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: doesnt E just play @S here?|pg||
nt|bebechira: if he makes this will be a good lead going to the break|pg||
nt|mug: I don't think he can keep trump control|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: and he may mean that "literally" |pg||
pc|c6|nt|mug: predominantly vodka but others too|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hello Nicoleta|pg||
nt|mug: and he doesn't have enough tricks on a cross-ruff either|pg||
nt|shevek: @c6 shows 2 voids now :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h5|pc|s4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|shevek: declarer has hopes that north has @hK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|d2|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: now club ruff and KD and @D ruff |pg||
nt|shevek: and north will have more trumps...|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: I wonder ifthere is a way|pg||
nt|bebechira: i think Tuszynski wonders the same thing|pg||
nt|sybarra: we think we have figured out the scoring.  Denis tell me right |pg||
nt|mug: the scoring is a mixture of IMP and BAM, like the Lederer tournament in London next weekend|pg||
nt|sybarra: every board is 2-0,1-1 or 0-2, then they add for the total of imps and get the vp |pg||
nt|sybarra: I know Tom,  just trying to explain it |pg||
nt|shevek: VPs on a scale 20-0|pg||
nt|mug: yes it was a coincidence we both mentioned it|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is not played AT ALL in usa|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: my kind of tournament - fruit flavoured vodkas sare my thing|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mug: so he's decided to draw trumps and hope to guess clubs, unlucky|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: that trump play at trick 2 killed the contract :) if you expect a 4-0 then club ruff , AKD of @D , D ruff ...|pg||
nt|mug: it is very rare in Europe|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: I think we just went in the soup |pg||
pc|cT|pc|h7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c9|pc|s7|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mug: I doubt he could make it whatever he did at trick two|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: now a bunch minus |pg||
nt|sybarra: I played in one in Schreveingen Neth. |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: yuck|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h8|pg||
nt|roswolf: 12 imps back|pg||
pc|d7|pc|hT|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|cQ|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|sybarra: why didnt he pitch the H!?|pg||
nt|sybarra: doesnt matter |pg||
nt|bebechira: bye all...see you soon|pg||
nt|sybarra: back in about 5/10 min for final 5 |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: thanks and see you soon|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: I want to license it if they get to these contracts|pg||

nt|mug: tough when your suit breaks 3-3, how can you play for that?|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: as usual,   ....here we go again!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|shevek: hello Traian|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Nicoleta|pg||
nt|bebechira: Roland asked me to help because you were busy as usual .... :)|pg||
nt|shevek: hi shirley @h|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk7: and welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: notrump contracts are rare|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mug: 6@D is a fair result for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: pass = poor hand?|pg||
nt|mug: 7@D is cold but EW can save in 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: here we go "blasting" into..........|pg||
nt|mug: or 7@H obviously|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is gf presumably in this event|pg||
nt|sybarra: they might try the "reverse" to save in 6 @H  LOL|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now we get 3@D from west!?|pg||
nt|shevek: hello Roland :)|pg||
nt|shevek: and Joe|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: hi Roland  )|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: hi all )|pg||
nt|sybarra: Zmudzinski is world grand master - world and olympic champion - have won the Transnationals in Brazil lately ( Zimmermann team ) |pg||
nt|sybarra: ty specs for great info  |pg||
nt|shevek: he is a Goulash expert|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mug: hang on, West can ruff a club and East can ruff a spade, didn't see that|pg||
nt|mug: 3@D now by South should end the auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|Walddk7: Hi Denis|pg||
nt|sybarra: strong jump shifts typical in goulash |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: he is expert in all games )|pg||
nt|bebechira: he has a nice club suit this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: This is divided into to halves of 5 boards, so there will be a short break after board 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: bid what you think you can make|pg||
nt|sybarra: yeah this can go down |pg||
nt|mug: doubles like West's usually show 2-suiters|pg||
nt|mug: 3-suited hands are very rare|pg||
nt|santyclz: For many people playing ghoulash, e's x would be penalty.|pg||
nt|santyclz: W knows he's doomed this hand.  4333 is a death holding.|pg||
nt|mug: in fact some pairs play any 3NT bid as ace-asking|pg||
nt|shevek: that is true in any form of bridge Joe :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|roswolf: very disci[plined|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: good contract )|pg||
nt|sybarra: S is proabably sure @D's dont break |pg||
nt|mug: it doesn't make, but good contract |pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|mug: West has a difficult lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: Denis, you are right |pg||
nt|shevek: true true|pg||
nt|bebechira: and 7nt ..... will they bid it?|pg||
nt|shevek: 4th suit forcing|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mug: second double is for the club lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: and slam doubles lightner !?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and X says  2 suiter,  lead a (suit preference if you have one) club |pg||
nt|mug: watch for the suit preference club lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can see ace and club q works |pg||
nt|sybarra: S is saying   "lovely pard, thanks"  |pg||
nt|mug: you can tell this hand was dealt 4-3-3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and one of the worlds nicest guys (from what I can tell as vugraph operator)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mug: @CQ might have been clearer for West|pg||
nt|shevek: most doubles should be for penalties|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: let's see if he gets it right|pg||
nt|roswolf: well is it clear to ruff and lead a spade?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Never in my life did I see one player with 13 cards in the majors and his partner with 13 in the minors|pg||
nt|sybarra: straight aces, I double they play key car here|pg||
nt|shevek: EW seems in control|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Dan Hohor|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Dan welcome |pg||
nt|shevek: hi Dan|pg||
nt|bebechira: welcome to Dan Hohor... a great admirer of Balicki-Zmudzinski|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: hi Dan )|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: hi all|pg||
nt|shevek: west afraid to bid 5@s?|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be the coctail hour in Oz?|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: well, don't forget about Tuszynski, great polish champion|pg||
nt|bebechira: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: he is ranked   10 in Poland |pg||
mb|7C|nt|mug: I don't know what theyv|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: this is ordinary situation in goulash )|pg||
nt|shevek: we'd like to remind our spectators that we're watching "goulash bridge"|pg||
nt|shevek: if you're looking for recipes for the hungarian soup, we recommend this site:|pg||
nt|shevek: http://www.bestrecipes.com.au/recipe/Beef-Goulash-L238.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: 've agreed about these situations|pg||
nt|mug: might have been clearer to have led something like the TEN of clubs|pg||
nt|mug: now East needs to work out the heart situation|pg||
nt|mug: Mr Goulash also sanctions 6-4-3 and 5-5-3 I think|pg||
nt|mug: but 4-3-3-3 is the most fiery kind of Goulash|pg||
nt|shevek: cold for 6@h|pg||
nt|mug: I mean the way the cards are "dealt" by the program|pg||
nt|shevek: mind you they're cold for 7N for that matter|pg||
nt|mug: NS don't expect the suits to break, EW could just as easily be as distributional as they are|pg||
nt|mug: so stopping low was very reasonable|pg||
nt|bebechira: open room reached 7 clubs...|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: regardless of current ranking ( he is getting old ) he is one of the greats|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzb: forth best )))|pg||
nt|shevek: I'm wrong 7NT down on a @c lead|pg||
nt|mug: "Mr Goulash" by the way is Evgeny Gladysh|pg||
nt|santyclz: That still meets the bbo definition of cold:  can be made double-dummy, perhaps with a little help from the defense.|pg||
nt|shevek: claim at trick 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|shevek: however, if you like some spicy bridge you're in the right place|pg||
nt|santyclz: R rated bridge.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Children under 17 shouldn't watch without adult supervision.|pg||
nt|shevek: Estonia might gain 3 imps here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: this is a patton|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: its not just 3 IMPs|pg||
nt|sybarra: as long as no ruff |pg||
nt|shevek: and not @cQxx|pg||
nt|shevek: both very common :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dan_hohor: 7NT to steal the board :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|mug: on the same wavelength, well done by E-W|pg||
nt|sybarra: so this hand was "only" 17 imps |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Kholomeev said: "very good when the trumps are 1-1, isn't it?"|pg||
nt|shevek: this year 16 teams entered the event, http://www.nncup.org/page_07_e.htm|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk7: aha, combination of Board-a-Match (BAM) and IMPs|pg||
nt|shevek: nice prize money US$9,000|pg||
nt|santyclz: Endplays and avoiding endplays is a huge part of ghouly.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|shevek: I spoke to Roland and there are also prizes for the commentators who make predictions for the final contract|pg||
nt|santyclz: A low @c back might be best.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mug: too difficult, other layouts were possible|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
nt|sybarra: cashing these outside suits is scary in a trump  contract |pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: yes fair comment|pg||
nt|santyclz: The hand is double-dummy by now.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bebechira: indeed|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|s2|pc|c2|pg||
mc|13|nt|sybarra: now a claim |pg||
nt|sybarra: whew he says |pg||
nt|bebechira: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Adam has explained his decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: If club 3-0|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe down more in nt  (bet is his reason) |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: then it much more cheaper to play 7@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep |pg||
nt|dan_hohor: yes, you go off zillions if clubs are 3-0 in 7NT :)|pg||
pg||

nt|davidstern: As in many of these hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: For anybody just joining us: Goulash dealing has variations; basically, each player sorts the cards from the previous deal by suits, and all four hands are stacked back in the ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: deck. The deck is then cut once or twice, and cards are then dealt in groups of 4-5-4 or 5-5-3, instead of one at a time as usual.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: west passing - hmmm dont think i could do that|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hence the flat hands we have been watching - NOT|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: It is clearly not an opening ......!!!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: not enough hcps - ok|pg||
nt|davidstern: Can NS make 4@H - remember they cant cash diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont understand this bidding|pg||
pc|c2|nt|davidstern: EW are cold for 4@S maybe 5 and they have allowed NS to play 2@H - Im with you Geoff|pg||

nt|vugraphzzb: the last board of the first segment|pg||

nt|sybarra: impressive |pg||
nt|sybarra: and now last  bd of this segment |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: the last board of the QF|pg||
nt|mug: this time there is no ruff against the grand slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: Denis,   great job as always |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: we will continue tomorrow - SF and Final of the tournament|pg||
nt|roswolf: grand is on|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|sybarra: and another fascinating hand |pg||
nt|mug: the problem is that declarer is often also void|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w may have to really scramble here to match the OR result |pg||
nt|roswolf: why did 6@S MAKE? looks like 2 losers|pg||
nt|mug: a good partner will probably try his 8-card suit in case you can ruff, anyway|pg||
nt|shevek: good score for EW in the OR|pg||
nt|santyclz: Although it wouldn't work in a tourney setting, ghoulash is frequently played that any hand that doesn't reach at least 4@ds is redealt.|pg||
nt|shevek: 2NT showing @h+ min?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: The last board of the first segment|pg||
nt|shevek: or @c and a Maj?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: the last board of the Semifinal|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Declarer played clubs for no loser. Strong player|pg||
nt|mug: whoops, egg on face for someone|pg||
nt|shevek: don't go far, we restart in 10 min or so, true Denis?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: correct|pg||
nt|shevek: west is not going to pass :)|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: another wild one|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: of course with double )|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: I have signed up to be here at 6 am my time |pg||
nt|mug: I think we'll see EW employ some kind of ace-asking device|pg||
nt|sybarra: just to join in |pg||
nt|mug: maybe 3@S says spades are trumps, and now East will cue-bid|pg||
nt|shevek: 7@h would be a good sac here|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: Except East might have had a club, then 7NT cold. (Ron)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mug: @CJ lead and @C10 continuation, not best|pg||
nt|mug: all cue-bids in this game are first-round|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed i would lead ace and another trump not the J +10 OFclubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: we will continue in 10-15 minutes|pg||
nt|mug: another 3NT contract in the OR, making when @DQ fell|pg||
nt|sybarra: unusual to see a "weak" 2 in goulash |pg||
nt|bebechira: quiet 4 spades here|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: oh , I have just been told that this is a goulash tournament :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
mb|4H|nt|mug: 4NT may be some kind of specialized BW|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Let me invite you to the final which start in 25 minutes|pg||
nt|mug: very good result for Estonia, as I don't think 5@D makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: isnt if fun!!  |pg||
nt|shevek: 2NT asked for minor, 3@s = @d longer??|pg||
nt|shevek: just making it up....|pg||
nt|sybarra: totally different methods here than the usual |pg||
nt|bebechira: :)|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: yes :) it is fun|pg||
nt|sybarra: wemay play 5 @D here|pg||
nt|bebechira: does not make|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 sp does |pg||
nt|bebechira: yep|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mug: surprised West didn't try 6@S here, but fair play to him, he did the right thing|pg||
nt|shevek: for those who are looking for the cooking classes:http://www.bestrecipes.com.au/recipe/Beef-Goulash-L238.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Bidding isn't as safe as it looks.  S could easily have 6@s for the 4@h bid.|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe just a flat board ?  :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5@s, i mean|pg||
nt|shevek: good decision by north|pg||
nt|mug: good morning|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hello Tom|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: hi Tom|pg||
nt|mug: bit unprincipled though, showed his hand pretty well with 6@H I'd have thought|pg||
nt|santyclz: Gm Tom.|pg||
nt|shevek: -800 wins the segment|pg||
nt|shevek: hi Tom|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: heart from the right hand ()|pg||
nt|mug: on the other hand if partner has @CA he is probably making 7@H and no way to find out|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: no trump lead|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe even -500|pg||
nt|benislovas: A of clubs and 13 tricks|pg||
mb|5S|nt|mug: spade lead and South may get endplayed|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: nope |pg||
nt|shevek: 2 down even on trump lead (from david)|pg||
nt|mug: the opening lead is always a challenge at this game|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: and Kholomeev did well with the lead, a trump was certainly in the picture, or at least I'd have thought so|pg||
nt|mug: rather disappointing, they didn't have the methods|pg||
nt|sybarra: they needed it |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm grand missed|pg||
nt|roswolf: off to monaco bye all|pg||
nt|mug: how would the bidding go in your Goulash system, Denis?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: now all participants are going to watch the big TV|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: the football match between Germany and Russia|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: I think 1@h - 2@S should be FG|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Kholomeev thought that 3@s was SPL|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: got a plus score|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok cu back in short time, |pg||
nt|mug: some very hot play at this table|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Denis,  cu then |pg||
nt|roswolf: see you soon|pg||
nt|shevek: http://www.bestrecipes.com.au/recipe/Beef-Goulash-L238.html|pg||
nt|bebechira: wow|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: ty Nicole :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: lucky it makes|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I would have bid 4 @H  I am sure there is a reason |pg||
nt|sybarra: looking for 6 @S maybe?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Adam has asked his opponents not to ask about the bidding|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mug: ah well, thank you for the entertainment, see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx all cu in my early am :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: thanks all !|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|shevek: but wait...there is MORE!|pg||
nt|mug: some situations really are total guesswork, West took the IMP-type decision to bid on|pg||
nt|shevek: good sport|pg||
nt|sybarra: Gladysh-Churlin together with Balicki-Zmudzinski has won this Cup 2004,2005.2006.2007. Think they didn´t play last year :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: from a spec  |pg||
pc|c2|nt|dan_hohor: :) true , the normal rules do not apply at goulash|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mug: trump lead was good enough I think, now he can exit twice in spades|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: it is all inspiration and table presence |pg||
pc|d3|nt|shevek: 7@h was the winning bid here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: see you in 10 minutes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|shevek: Estonia won the 1st segment by 9 imps only (13-7 VP)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|santyclz: Has to make a lot of pitches, though.|pg||
nt|mug: he's ok|pg||
pc|d5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: from anothe spec:   they did but were defeated in the quarter or semi :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: he has showed the hand with two voids|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx all fun to know these things |pg||
pc|hA|nt|shevek: so it looks like Stoichov going to the Final|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mug: there's a big BAM element in the scoring|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h9|pg||
nt|mug: Estonia have won a couple of boards here, and got some IMPs back, could be close now|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|dT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: yesterday  (dens I think you were operating)  almost every bd we +/- 15 or 16 |pg||
nt|sybarra: *we saw |pg||
nt|dan_hohor: if he plays a H he is gone, S discards a @D|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mug: got to go now, have fun|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|bebechira: wow|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|h4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: he is gone anyhow , he will be shortened in clubs if A@S and @S|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: still winning the board (just) at the other table :)|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: the 8@s is the key card|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: this is a patton (combination BAM and IMPs)|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have tried to explain patton  (It is not played in USA) |pg||
nt|sybarra: its a combined scoring of imps and BAM/matchpoint  |pg||
nt|shevek: Board-a-Match Teams is the toughest type of event (which may account for its lack of popularity)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h6|nt|shevek: Each board is scored separately as a win, a tie or a loss.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: I wonder if the play went AK@D , @D ruff and small spade from the table |pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|shevek: every board in a board-a-match game is worth one full matchpoint|pg||
pc|c9|nt|frankaus: we moved our clock forward 1 hour last sunday  so i was hoping that the adjustment had been recorded by his system|pg||
nt|shevek: If your NS pair is +130 in a diamond partial, and your counterparts play in 2NT making 120, you get a full 1.0 (WIN) on the board !|pg||
mc|9|nt|dan_hohor: nah, not working|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not like Zmud |pg||
nt|shevek: just another flat board|pg||
pg||
