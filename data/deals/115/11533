nt|jbgood: unless Hantveit opens 1 NT - then 3 NT may be the contract|pg||

nt|petergill: Trond Hantveit's best bridge result was 3rd in the 1997 World Junior Pairs, partnered by Boye Brogeland|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|an|!|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|petergill: NC France = National Champions of France - their 3rd pair, sitting out this match, is Thomas and Michel Bessis|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|jbgood: I think they play 2@c (at least) 2-way here, one alternative is the 3 card spade support and an invitaqtional or game going hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|petergill: If spades were 4-1, it would be possible to go down, but not possible with trumps 3-2|pg||
nt|petergill: Alain Levy and Herve Mouiel are two of France's top super-experts|pg||
nt|petergill: Trond Hantveit is thinking about how to counter a 4-1 spade break|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|jbgood: rare to see a Norwegian give up his beer card at trick 2:)|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  beer card, Jon, what is it?|pg||

nt|eweber: in the closed Nord doubled 3@s after the same start of bidding|pg||

nt|petergill: or perhaps if you are running last and are desperate you run @CJ|pg||

nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
nt|ralfwil: After D on 1@s, why not @c from W on 2@c?. Perhaps they could avoid 4@h and perhaps found 3nt |pg||
nt|xenya: correction: declarer can get rid of a @D loser of course, but that doesnt help as he has to use the high @Hs in the dummy for ruffing, losing a trump trick in the end |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Sry pass from E and D from W on 2@c|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|an|!|nt|petergill: with a hand like South's opposite a strong 1NT, never underbid. Always reach some game, and hope for success, that's what I think|pg||

nt|petergill: or perhaps 3NT at the other table showed clubs, if they (like me, in one partnership) play transfers in all suits after 1NT - 2@D - 2@H|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: For me it looks like Easts D over 1@s was for penalty. But he could also have choosen 3nt direct as a speculation|pg||

nt|rodal f: Seems as 16+ and 0-7 for 1@D|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: sure all works well and no @H lead either:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: of course, North doesn't know clubs are 2-2; if he wins @SK and they are 3-1, he can be shut out of dummy  |pg||

nt|eweber: nice hand to learn from|pg||
nt|petergill: You had to win the spade in dummy at Trick 1 - how interesting|pg||
mb|2S|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|petergill: Espen Lindqvist is a brilliant 26 year old poker and bridge star from Norway. |pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@D was typically Norwegian, and either 2@D or 5@D was too much|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after 2@d and 2@s - E can consider this move|pg||
nt|petergill: Im not that keen on the advance sacrifice against the 4@S that NS were not about to bid|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but AK @c in his hand...|pg||
nt|jbgood: 5 @d is a bit unilateral..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|petergill: also, NS have already described their hands quite a lot, so 5@D is probably unnecessary - no need to preempt against people who don't mind losing the bidding space.   |pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|petergill: Sveta's point about @CAK is good - every time partner has @SAx or similar, as little as a club riff might beat 4@S, so the save will often be a phantom|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: and world class opponents nearly always just take the plus score by doubling you - it is only the weaker players back home who bid 5 over 5 too much|pg||
