nt|brolucius: If North had more points, he would have continued to show his shape, bidding 2@S.|pg||
nt|ady: North took a view to pass 1NT   |pg||
nt|hedyg: well if he is not prepared to do so why not open 1@s?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or even 2@C |pg||
pc|c5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome Andrei |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh ok |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: surely not|pg||
nt|othered1: Any idea what system rebids 1@S rather than raising @H naturally?|pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: was not az transfert.. was just 0-5 Hcp he said|pg||
nt|haans: one advantahe of Big Clubs compared to Polish Clubs is that the strong @C can pass |pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: he didnt talk about hearts|pg||
nt|haans: got that|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: why suppress 4 card support?|pg||
nt|haans: good start for NS|pg||
nt|rodal f: So a sort of Ekrens 2@D it seems|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|rodal f: 2NT often used as lebensol in this possision|pg||

nt|haans: more often for every day :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@H normaly 16+ now so hard for E to pass|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt often say bid 3@C|pg||

nt|rodal f: BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php OR 4@H here|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sfoxa: this tournament is really interesting from the very beginning: each team can choose qualification time: either 3:00 p.m. or now|pg||

nt|mdgraham: the alternative is to play that 1@S-any-3@C is strong, and 1@C followed by spades a normal opening|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but always a debatable topic|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|hedyg: i dont think Chemla would have bid over 2@s, his red hcps are surley not what his pd needs|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: No, but North might have 17 points for that sequence.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 17 and 5 5 he would make a forcing sequence imo|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree 100% with opening that N hand with 1C. bid where you liuve whenever possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: for sure|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: otherwise all too often you end up bidding where you die|pg||
nt|ady: look like intending to set up diamands    may be better to cross ruff  on the lay out|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h5|nt|brolucius: Once you start bidding the better suit, you lose the inferences about the relative strength of different sequences.  For example, on that hand shape you might open 1@S when minimum ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: and 1@C (rebidding the spades thereafter) when stronger.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: personally i would bid 2D over 1H. few play that as a GF in comp, and even if it is that's fine as i never mind a slight overbid if it helps me to describe my hand. here 2D ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: followed by spades paints perfect picture|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: is North running out of trumps here?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as  for that particular, hand, though, what i see is a good five card club suit plus a four-card spade suit withg a tail|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: i see the good 5card @c suit, but i also see a 5 card suit suit keeping my eye on possible contracts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, ok now. Cross-ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: weak five card suits do not tend to play like the typical 8-card fit |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|s6|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|sK|pc|c5|nt|hedyg: have had worse than J9xxx|pg||
nt|brolucius: He has to ruff the heart before a club because otherwise East could ditch his heart on a diamond ruff.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: and N did not have five spades--he had a four card suit with a tail (did i say that laready?)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes you did|pg||

nt|sfoxa: tomorrow, all the teams will be divided in 2 group, depending on VP results|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup and the board has been lost|pg||
nt|haans: letting them play was best|pg||
nt|aupillon: 4 spades anyone ?|pg||

nt|sybarra: joe, constantin,  welcome |pg||
mb|1D|nt|rodal f: Slam on but hard to bid and % under 50 so 4@S I presume as the end|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 nt?  (hate the pattern for that bid)   |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|haans: unusual bid from Bonori|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Another 3nt on NS, and why not let EW play 1@h X?|pg||
nt|haans: 2 low non vul?|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: 6@s must be at about 30%|pg||

pc|dK|nt|roswolf: declarer on the right track here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: no which makes it fun!:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa: you have to be lucky enough to be dropped into section/session with weaker opps )))  |pg||
nt|roswolf: the @D7was/might be expensive|pg||
nt|frankaus: play like pairs for part scores - like teams for game level|pg||

pc|d3|nt|roswolf: good idea frank|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the opening. Strong or better @H it seems as Multon X if Zimermann have @Hs|pg||
nt|haans: S do see a dim ruff|pg||
nt|rodal f: 800 if Multon discard a @D now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|stc: probably making 5|pg||
nt|jstokes: might well run trumps twice from dummy -- advantage is you don't have to guess when neither K or J appears after ace, small|pg||
nt|aupillon: wait for seeing how he plays trumps|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: the spot cards here are fascinating|pg||
nt|aupillon: this was the point|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|othered1: this scoring can provide many unusual and complex decisions both in bidding and play.  For example, deciding on whether to bid a lower scoring but less risky game, or whether to ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: lot of messages, but all right - mistimed. Unfortunate|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: when you have a weak five-card suit and you expect a force, your honor in the suit is important. with the ace you can usually keep control, and with the king you need only A or Q ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: opposite to survive most of the time. once you get down to Q or especially J, they often dont play like a 5-card suit due to control issues|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: at these colors a 1S opening by S has its appeal, but not to the French|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: they like to open with an opening, especially in 1st seat|pg||
nt|brolucius: West preferred 1NT to a double at the other table. Double looks better to me, with only @SQ-x-x.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looking at movie, North could have made that in a number of ways at the end. Play @CA and ruff a club, then diamonds....make @SQ en passant |pg||

pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||

nt|marlowepi: suits including both majors, no rebid problems, adequate defense, and you get to bid the suit you want led, if you wait on this hand, you may get to bid spades but you are very ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: and ugly is sometimes good|pg||

nt|marlowepi: N showed extra heart length, and it is unlikely that S would jump to slam with a void or singleton when the slam can be beat|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm 7@H-1  |pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|brolucius: Mouiel did not double 7@H, holding the ace of trumps! Well, there have been cases of a retreat to 7NT being successful. |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|d|nt|mdgraham: I think West did not double 7@H because (a) he was happy with the contract,and (b) if North switches to 7NT, that may have 13 tricks on top if East misguesses the lead    |pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|brolucius: Yes, strange.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a psyche, perhaps?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: maybe they use 1S as a wide-range neg double?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|hedyg: are you suggesting he just likes to bid 1@s?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: not in France, I suspect|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some play that they always double with 4 or more spades and 1@S denies four spades. But it seems from the earlier hand that Damiani cannot play that method.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you know what is good for you, you dont psyche in the boss suit on your own hand at unfavorable vul|pg||
