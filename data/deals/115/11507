nt|davidstern: OK so the misfitting 7-6 opposite 8-5|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: I did warn you|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3D|nt|davidstern: And as I said suits dont break look at those red suit breaks|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: When was the last time partner bid game with 5-4 in your suit|pg||
nt|davidstern: No double by south?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|davidstern: dummy will ruff and North wont be able to overruff|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi Geoff - you strapped in?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|davidstern: And as one spec points out: i dont recall the last time anyone kept quiet with a 76 hand either :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: saw one yesterday|pg||
nt|santyclz: some people play that all x's are penalty|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi Joe|pg||
nt|santyclz: Gm folks.|pg||
nt|davidstern: Basic System: When goulash dealing is in effect, some players adjust their bidding principles in some or all of the following ways in order to accommodate the anticipated wildness ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: of the deal: (a) Only five-card suits may be bid (b) Weak balanced hands (in 12-15 high card points range) are passed rather than opened (c) Preemptive openings are forbidden; (d) ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: instead, a high-level opening bid denotes the exact number of tricks the hand possesses.|pg||
nt|davidstern: (e) Conventions are highly reduced, as opponents will often interfere and break up the subtle information exchange. (f) Doubles behind a bidder are for penalties, where they would ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: usually be for take out. (g)Others use opening bids to identify aces or two-suited hands, or have other conventional meanings that aid in determining whether to bid or double in ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: competition.|pg||
nt|vugraphzza: 2 segments of 5 boards in semifinal|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h5|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|davidstern: Before you guys arrived I called this the R Rated version of the game|pg||
nt|roswolf: btw is it true that you can play any "convention" like 1nt denies 10 points or more|pg||
nt|davidstern: That I dont know - Roland would be the authority on that|pg||
pc|d8|nt|santyclz: Reminds me of the old Vietnam war slogan:  Goulash is not good for children or other living creatures.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|davidstern: 4@Hx North in the CR after 5 rounds of bidding|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|h4|nt|davidstern: Avoiding endplays is also a big part of this game|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|roswolf: and giving ruff and discards at trick 1|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|d5|pg||

nt|sybarra: might be interesting at BAM |pg||

mb|2C|nt|mug: hello again|pg||
nt|shevek: hello everyone, this is going to be fun :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|mug: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Tom |pg||
nt|mug: hi Denis|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello Denis |pg||
nt|mug: sorry I can't be here this year but this is the next best thing|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Welcome all :)|pg||
nt|shevek: hi Denis|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: the "leaping bids"  will start soon |pg||
nt|sybarra: starting out "normally" |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes not too unusual|pg||
nt|mug: problem is that South has opened quite light, North may need some restraining|pg||
nt|sybarra: put leash around his neck?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: This is the semifanal of NN-CUP-2009|pg||
nt|shevek: in OR west bought it in 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: You can find the results here: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: this is Goulash from moscow, mixture of IMP and BAM scoring|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is interesting i was once told when in doubt bid game instead of slam and partscore instead of game when hands were goulashed|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
nt|sybarra: how do they score it? |pg||
nt|mug: noone's going to be leaping too high here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: we play patton|pg||
nt|mug: West will probably settle for an invitational bid|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sybarra: no X  lets not give the  hand away |pg||
nt|mug: South will sign off, void in partner's second suit is not good |pg||
nt|mug: quite right shirley, double of 4@C would be criminal, they're all much too canny for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: at goulash doubles are for blood|pg||
nt|shevek: even if before length|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: thought he might crash into 4 @S |pg||
nt|mug: partner is almost certain to be void in spades after 2@C|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: probably a sound start|pg||
nt|mug: to be honest I think 4@S was a wild overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: you should expect two trump losers with the broken spade suit|pg||
mb|d|nt|shevek: 3NT asking for another suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: is that where "we" want to be?|pg||
nt|mug: very far away|pg||
nt|sybarra: so does E lead a @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or more passive @D? |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: losing 2@H and 2 @S?|pg||
nt|mug: must try to give partner a ruff somewhere|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to be @C |pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: I'm afraid no|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|vugraphzzb: the current score of this match is 11:9|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|d2|nt|mug: North is in a lot of pain|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|shevek: well, north would have done better (maybe) to pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Luks has just tried to escape|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|roswolf: should you double in principle most contracts?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mug: not necessarily Geoff|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought he might  try ace and a @H?  now maybe |pg||
nt|roswolf: yup cant see too many trcks|pg||
nt|mug: now is good|pg||
nt|mug: North would like to duck @H3 but not possible :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|d3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|roswolf: draw dummys trump yes seems best|pg||
nt|shevek: there are of course different rules for this game|pg||
pc|h2|nt|shevek: - only five-card suits may be bid|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s7|pc|d6|nt|shevek: - 12-15 hcp balanced hands (IF you get one!) are passed rather than opened|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mug: three more tricks for EW, down five|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably -5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|shevek: - preemptive openings are forbidden;|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h3|nt|shevek: i.e.  a high-level opening bid denotes the exact number of tricks the hand possesses|pg||
nt|shevek: - use of conventions is reduced to a minimum, as opponents will often interfere taking away the bidding space|pg||
nt|shevek: - doubles behind the length are for penalties, where they would usually be for take out|pg||
mc|7|nt|shevek:  - suits NEVER break and partner NEVER has a fit for you|pg||
pg||

nt|santyclz: Note the 4@h bid, 2 card support is usually unexpectedly good.|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Last making spot|pg||
nt|davidstern: Again jump to game with doubleton as 2@H showed a fist load of hearts|pg||
mb|6C|mb|6H|nt|davidstern: Yes as noted a usualy Goulash phenomenon no game by North 7@C by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: what is par here?5@Cx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Yes 5@Cx is par unless South declares|pg||
nt|davidstern: 7@D Souh as well|pg||
nt|davidstern: 6@H passed out in CR|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@H was not well judged - pass was better allowinf pard to decide|pg||
nt|davidstern: As noted no 7@D on a heart lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|davidstern: Obvious doubles are not so obvious in this form of the game|pg||
nt|roswolf: with @SAKQ east would have had an easy double|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|davidstern: Only one down was good |pg||
nt|davidstern: You'll like the opening bid in the CR on the next hand 2@D showing diamonds (5) and a major (8)|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch as many vugraph rooms as you want - one window per table|pg||
nt|davidstern: Good lead by North and worth noting - better to lead partner's suit than your 9 card suit|pg||
nt|davidstern: Except when partner is void|pg||
nt|davidstern: In your suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think i would switch to a club which would end only-1|pg||
nt|santyclz: A good hand for low from a doubleton.|pg||
nt|davidstern: Have we lost our connection or is South sleeping|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: E hates his hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: you can find the current results of the tournament using the following link: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mug: double in front of partner should be a very firm message|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah a 4nt bid for north|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont think in goulash that is right  |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sybarra: how ever it is good for 6 @D  little does he know  |pg||
nt|mug: he hates his hand but it is quite useful for his partner|pg||
nt|roswolf: well east has some offence|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra: wow!!!  look at N hand!!!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and who need BW anyway??|pg||
nt|mug: East will bid 7@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Nord has an ordinary hand in Goulash )|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe should have walked it up?|pg||
nt|mug: creepy crawly doesn't work in my experience|pg||
nt|sybarra: you have played there,  so you should know |pg||
nt|mug: and anyway North is far from guaranteed to make 7@C|pg||
nt|mug: he needs South to have @SA, and to avoid a spade ruff|pg||
nt|mug: this way East is put to the test|pg||
nt|sybarra: and that is a consideration  (the ruff that is) |pg||
nt|mug: BIG consideration Shirley|pg||
nt|roswolf: but even goulashes obey the laws of probability - dont they?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Easts pard did not announce a great hand! |pg||
nt|sybarra: actually geoffrey from watching,  they are very disciplined  |pg||
nt|mug: but West's bid showed a long suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: or commenting last couple of years,  (I should say) |pg||
nt|roswolf: would a prolonged pause and pass impose any ethical problems on west|pg||
nt|mug: yes you're right Shirley, the best players are very conservative and very disciplined|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: likely 6@S BY NORTH?|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually overstated that one,  6 @D does not make |pg||
mb|4C|nt|shevek: will the 10-card suit holder buy the contract??|pg||
mb|5C|mb|5H|nt|shevek: a specs suggests 7@c by south - too late for that :)|pg||
mb|6H|nt|mug: partnership trust is very important|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow!!! |pg||
nt|sybarra: restraint |pg||
nt|roswolf: HMMMM unexpected|pg||
nt|mug: I think South owed North 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|sybarra: S owed something |pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: good bidding by all|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have a way to say it in US,   "this tourney is a hoot"  (hoot= entertaining, fun etc) |pg||
nt|mug: certainly is|pg||
nt|mug: we did terribly but had a really great time last year|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump lead best|pg||
nt|mug: at the 5-level North was right to shut up shop, his suit is far from solid at this game|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: perhaps for 5this tourney only you should be allowed to bid at the 8 level as in the old days|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11 tricks on a cross ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: would you do it again Tom?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mug: was planning to come this year but circs intervened|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|mug: at least they didn't double 5@D although that probably won't help their score much|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: it should go down|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mug: the rest of my crew is playing|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: poor S doesnt have a club to lead :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: 7@c from the other table|pg||
nt|sybarra: other room almost walked it up |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes after a straightforward ordinary type auction|pg||
nt|mug: South should be DD here|pg||
nt|mug: his partner must have 12 clubs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mug: it won't matter, big winning board for his team|pg||
nt|mug: although a trick went there, poor defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: only -4|pg||

nt|roswolf: well hes got them|pg||
nt|davidstern: IN the CR on the previous hand where they made 2@H they are playing 3@C doubled EW|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: that is perhaps rash - suit quality is at a premium in this form of bridge|pg||
pc|cA|nt|davidstern: I wonder why South felt compelled to bid 2@S rather than double his vul opps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: a goodly thought|pg||
nt|davidstern: @SK lead would make 2@DX very unpleasant|pg||
nt|roswolf: it seems to me you should plan to defend as much as possible|pg||
nt|davidstern: Tick|pg||
pc|h7|nt|davidstern:  A reminder that this is a Goulash Tourney: Goulash dealing has variations; basically, each player sorts the cards from the previous deal by suits, and all four hands are stacked ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: back in the deck. The deck is then cut once or twice, and cards are then dealt in groups of 4-5-4 or 5-5-3, instead of one at a time as usual.|pg||

nt|sybarra: oh good another great hand, I LOVE this tourney!!|pg||
nt|mug: as 16 IMP swings are pretty routine|pg||
mb|2D|an|!d and M|nt|roswolf: are you allowed to psyche in this event or is it frowned upon|pg||
nt|sybarra: or when you thought you lost 16   you mates say  "push"  |pg||
nt|mug: you can do what you like Geoff|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w misfit n/s have spades played in say 6@C|pg||
nt|shevek: this year 16 teams entered the event|pg||
nt|shevek: http://www.nncup.org/page_07_e.htm|pg||
nt|shevek: stage 1 of Q they played in 4 groups, winners went to group A, losers to group B|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mug: but I think psyching would be foolish|pg||
nt|shevek: with repechage matches to get back in the QF:|pg||
nt|shevek: http://www.nncup.org/page_08_e.htm|pg||
nt|shevek: prize money US$9,000|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: double tends to be a two-suiter|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: doubt you need to, pard may take you seriously |pg||
nt|mug: this double is probably not penalty|pg||
nt|sybarra: and how to get to @S here,  notice that E did not bid |pg||
nt|mug: North can clarify now with 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: TOO COMMITTAL|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|sybarra: so if 2 suiter  does he bid 6?|pg||
nt|roswolf: finis|pg||
nt|mug: I don't think North will like his hand, @CKx looks sick|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: interesting contract|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: so pass is in order |pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: hmm some interesting tactics could arise eg 4@H BY NORTH INSTEAD OF 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you see,  "WE" dont X |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: in QF we play 2 segments. Each segment consist of 5 boards.|pg||
nt|mug: sensible bidding|pg||
nt|shevek: in this cade south's dbl was takeout, because he already showed his hand|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: imo,  this is such a great lesson to play goulash |pg||
nt|mug: I don't think it has much in common with bridge, the point is that it is good fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: great comment tom|pg||
nt|sybarra: my thought on that would be..........for students (I dont teach) think about what you heard in bidding,  and think about what the hands could be|pg||
nt|mug: North probably considered a trump lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: double ruffing finesse brings in a few tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: E to try for the ruff |pg||
nt|mug: higher than you'd like to be but they will get away with it this time|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard sometimes holds a trump |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm not today|pg||
nt|shevek: north chose to pass....|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe trumps are not so good for that|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzzb: yes but what North can chose?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: I think the double was too optimistik|pg||
nt|shevek: hard to support partner with void :)|pg||
nt|shevek: Bd 2 same contract and outcome in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: the double should show extra value which South doesn't have in his hand (in goulash game)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mug: always on the shortlist when you have one|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzzb: it looks like the saldo has been lost by the SPACE MUTANTS|pg||
nt|sybarra: what is sald?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *saldo |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: it is a patton|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|mug: West will hardly expect the clubs to lie so well |pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: Tom what did you do re systems,  when you played?  strong 2's?|pg||
nt|mug: the English team plays 2C thru 2NT as limited two-suiters, covering all combinations except the minors|pg||
nt|mug: 4NT is the minors|pg||
nt|mug: one bids show good hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok,  dont give away all secrets |pg||
nt|mug: 29 IMPs is nothing|pg||
nt|sybarra: so this is patton?   so we have imps and bam (or is it matchpoints)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: correct|pg||
nt|mug: just try and nick an overtrick on the last two boards and the Mutants will fine|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|shevek: declarer would have done better not to duck|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzzb: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: he would have Jx left in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: he could get the contract|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mug: 3NT we used to play as Blackwood, but this year the boys are playing it as a 10-trick major-suit hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mug: modified IMP scale though, right Denis?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzzb: correct )|pg||
nt|sybarra: patton is not played in the US,  I played it in Neth.   and loved it |pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|mug: think he's gone off, playing for North to have a short club honour|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer may run out of control here|pg||
nt|mug: some pairs in Moscow have very detailed specialist systems|pg||
nt|sybarra: for specs,  none of these systems are permitted in "normal" tourneys   |pg||
nt|mug: our system would be permitted in normal tournaments, but it would be absurd :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh fair comment |pg||
nt|sybarra: just trying to point out,  this is very "specialized"  tourney/systems etc |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but the fun factor should be predominant|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes  I envy Tom for playing it |pg||
nt|mug: the event is played in very good spirits|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

pc|s4|pg||

nt|roswolf: declarer i think should make this|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pc|d4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|davidstern: Will likely make now if he plays @SK and @SJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|davidstern: The lead was unfortunate for the defence|pg||
nt|davidstern: But better than a club perhaps|pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice endplay with @HQ and heart|pg||

nt|mug: tough when your suit breaks 3-3, how can you play for that?|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: as usual,   ....here we go again!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: and welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|mug: 6@D is a fair result for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: pass = poor hand?|pg||
nt|mug: 7@D is cold but EW can save in 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: here we go "blasting" into..........|pg||
nt|mug: or 7@H obviously|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is gf presumably in this event|pg||
nt|sybarra: they might try the "reverse" to save in 6 @H  LOL|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now we get 3@D from west!?|pg||
nt|shevek: hello Roland :)|pg||
nt|shevek: and Joe|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: hi Roland  )|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: hi all )|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mug: hang on, West can ruff a club and East can ruff a spade, didn't see that|pg||
nt|mug: 3@D now by South should end the auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Hi Denis|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk5: This is divided into to halves of 5 boards, so there will be a short break after board 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: bid what you think you can make|pg||
nt|sybarra: yeah this can go down |pg||
nt|mug: doubles like West's usually show 2-suiters|pg||
nt|mug: 3-suited hands are very rare|pg||
nt|santyclz: For many people playing ghoulash, e's x would be penalty.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: very disci[plined|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: good contract )|pg||
nt|sybarra: S is proabably sure @D's dont break |pg||
nt|mug: it doesn't make, but good contract |pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|mug: West has a difficult lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: second double is for the club lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: and slam doubles lightner !?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and X says  2 suiter,  lead a (suit preference if you have one) club |pg||
nt|mug: watch for the suit preference club lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can see ace and club q works |pg||
nt|sybarra: S is saying   "lovely pard, thanks"  |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|mug: @CQ might have been clearer for West|pg||
nt|shevek: most doubles should be for penalties|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mug: let's see if he gets it right|pg||
nt|roswolf: well is it clear to ruff and lead a spade?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Never in my life did I see one player with 13 cards in the majors and his partner with 13 in the minors|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mug: I don't know what theyv|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: this is ordinary situation in goulash )|pg||
nt|shevek: we'd like to remind our spectators that we're watching "goulash bridge"|pg||
nt|shevek: if you're looking for recipes for the hungarian soup, we recommend this site:|pg||
nt|shevek: http://www.bestrecipes.com.au/recipe/Beef-Goulash-L238.html|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mug: 've agreed about these situations|pg||
nt|mug: might have been clearer to have led something like the TEN of clubs|pg||
nt|mug: now East needs to work out the heart situation|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h3|nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|shevek: however, if you like some spicy bridge you're in the right place|pg||
nt|santyclz: R rated bridge.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Children under 17 shouldn't watch without adult supervision.|pg||
nt|shevek: Estonia might gain 3 imps here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: this is a patton|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: its not just 3 IMPs|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h4|nt|mug: on the same wavelength, well done by E-W|pg||
nt|sybarra: so this hand was "only" 17 imps |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Kholomeev said: "very good when the trumps are 1-1, isn't it?"|pg||
nt|shevek: this year 16 teams entered the event, http://www.nncup.org/page_07_e.htm|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk7: aha, combination of Board-a-Match (BAM) and IMPs|pg||
nt|shevek: nice prize money US$9,000|pg||
nt|santyclz: Endplays and avoiding endplays is a huge part of ghouly.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|shevek: I spoke to Roland and there are also prizes for the commentators who make predictions for the final contract|pg||
nt|santyclz: A low @c back might be best.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mug: too difficult, other layouts were possible|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes fair comment|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: i prefer 4-8|pg||
mb|2D|nt|davidstern: Faster than me sorry|pg||

mb|3C|mb|5S|mb|6H|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|davidstern: 6@S as there are enough trumps to deal with the clubs|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ruff and claim|pg||
nt|davidstern: dont ruff and claim|pg||
nt|davidstern: So par is 7@Hx -800|pg||

nt|Walddk6: I guess we could have a heated debate as to whether this has anything to do with bridge|pg||
mc|12|nt|davidstern: But it IS entertaining - to me at least|pg||
nt|davidstern: VG is there a beak now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzza: we will continue in 10-15 minutes|pg||
nt|davidstern: break|pg||
nt|davidstern: UHUH|pg||
nt|roswolf: no it doesnt save to alert you to rare possibilities|pg||
nt|roswolf: also if you have an abnormal hand at real bridge it often pays to stay low|pg||
nt|roswolf: is there any news of the score from the other semi?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Bidding ffrom CR 2NT North 4@H South|pg||
nt|davidstern: I will say that these wild distributions do test your skills to analyse and comment on a timely basis|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but the bidding is the thing to get right|pg||
nt|davidstern: CR in 7@H on the hand you can see after ripping his partner (S) double of 6@S and West is thinking|pg||
nt|davidstern: in the passout seat|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm feels un natural to double but he should i believe|pg||
nt|roswolf: trusting opps is actually a sound strategy here|pg||
nt|davidstern: They have bid 7@S and this was dobled|pg||
nt|davidstern: So Estonia will pick up something like 15 imps on this ghand|pg||
nt|davidstern: North lead the @CK and South ruffed just to make sure|pg||
nt|davidstern: so will resume in about 5 minutes and in 65 minutes the final will start|pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: the last board of the first segment|pg||
nt|sybarra: well,  the partenship understand of the X |pg||
nt|sybarra: impressive |pg||
nt|sybarra: and now last  bd of this segment |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: the last board of the QF|pg||
nt|mug: this time there is no ruff against the grand slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: Denis,   great job as always |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: we will continue tomorrow - SF and Final of the tournament|pg||
nt|roswolf: grand is on|pg||
mb|2N|an|!H + minor, 16-20 HCP|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and another fascinating hand |pg||
nt|mug: the problem is that declarer is often also void|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w may have to really scramble here to match the OR result |pg||
nt|roswolf: why did 6@S MAKE? looks like 2 losers|pg||
nt|mug: a good partner will probably try his 8-card suit in case you can ruff, anyway|pg||
nt|shevek: good score for EW in the OR|pg||
nt|santyclz: Although it wouldn't work in a tourney setting, ghoulash is frequently played that any hand that doesn't reach at least 4@ds is redealt.|pg||
nt|shevek: 2NT showing @h+ min?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: The last board of the first segment|pg||
nt|shevek: or @c and a Maj?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk5: Declarer played clubs for no loser. Strong player|pg||
nt|mug: whoops, egg on face for someone|pg||
nt|shevek: don't go far, we restart in 10 min or so, true Denis?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: correct|pg||
nt|shevek: west is not going to pass :)|pg||
mb|5S|nt|sybarra: I have signed up to be here at 6 am my time |pg||
nt|mug: I think we'll see EW employ some kind of ace-asking device|pg||
nt|sybarra: just to join in |pg||
nt|mug: maybe 3@S says spades are trumps, and now East will cue-bid|pg||
nt|shevek: 7@h would be a good sac here|pg||
mb|6H|mb|6S|nt|mug: @CJ lead and @C10 continuation, not best|pg||
nt|mug: all cue-bids in this game are first-round|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: indeed i would lead ace and another trump not the J +10 OFclubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: we will continue in 10-15 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: 4NT may be some kind of specialized BW|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|nt|mug: surprised West didn't try 6@S here, but fair play to him, he did the right thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Bidding isn't as safe as it looks.  S could easily have 6@s for the 4@h bid.|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe just a flat board ?  :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5@s, i mean|pg||
nt|shevek: good decision by north|pg||
nt|mug: good morning|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hello Tom|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: hi Tom|pg||
nt|mug: bit unprincipled though, showed his hand pretty well with 6@H I'd have thought|pg||
nt|santyclz: Gm Tom.|pg||
nt|shevek: -800 wins the segment|pg||
nt|shevek: hi Tom|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: heart from the right hand ()|pg||
nt|mug: on the other hand if partner has @CA he is probably making 7@H and no way to find out|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: no trump lead|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe even -500|pg||
nt|benislovas: A of clubs and 13 tricks|pg||
mb|7S|mb|d|nt|sybarra: nope |pg||
nt|shevek: 2 down even on trump lead (from david)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: and Kholomeev did well with the lead, a trump was certainly in the picture, or at least I'd have thought so|pg||
nt|mug: rather disappointing, they didn't have the methods|pg||
nt|sybarra: they needed it |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm grand missed|pg||
nt|roswolf: off to monaco bye all|pg||
nt|mug: how would the bidding go in your Goulash system, Denis?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: now all participants are going to watch the big TV|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: the football match between Germany and Russia|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: I think 1@h - 2@S should be FG|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Kholomeev thought that 3@s was SPL|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: got a plus score|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok cu back in short time, |pg||
nt|mug: some very hot play at this table|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Denis,  cu then |pg||
nt|roswolf: see you soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: ah well, thank you for the entertainment, see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx all cu in my early am :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: thanks all !|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|shevek: but wait...there is MORE!|pg||
nt|mug: some situations really are total guesswork, West took the IMP-type decision to bid on|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|sK|mc|12|nt|shevek: 7@h was the winning bid here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: see you in 10 minutes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all.|pg||
