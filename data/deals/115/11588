mb|2D|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|nt|ralfwil: Hello Vladimir|pg||
nt|jbgood: good evening|pg||
nt|xenya: a routine 4@S to warm up|pg||
nt|haans: mini NT is not rutine|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The player names are reversed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 11 tricks in @c after a @S lead, but more difficult or impossible after a @d singleton lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: on a diamond lead?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sunsamvar: actually i expected a minor suit bidding war here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Angelini-Versace do not play mini-NT. E-W do|pg||
nt|april7: Hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|dima:  Likely GromÃ¶ller-HÃ¤usler will get to Grand here - they were very efficient in the 1st segment|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: no but i xpect the contract to be reached in the OR as well -- probably on a different auction|pg||
nt|xenya: oh|pg||
nt|april7: S is looking for an adequate bid to find out about the K of @C to get to 7, he will find it I suppose|pg||
nt|dima:  Now (if they play sort of standard) South knows that North is 1=5=3=4 or actual shape so 13 tricks is matter of keycards|pg||
nt|sybarra: its not a game hand....3 nt is down on any lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: this is not good for sweden|pg||
pc|d9|nt|haans: do look balanced but yes they may have changed|pg||
nt|haans: italy are playing game here|pg||
nt|sybarra: E bit "reluctantly"  and W found good discipline here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @s is the only suit E can establish an entry to clean trumps|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: wow lead|pg||

pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: Germany 77 Denmark 70 Italy Allegra 65|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Paris for the 8th European Champions' Cup. Twelve teams divided into two groups. Matches of 20 boards in the round-robin. This is a round 2 match ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: from group A|pg||
nt|dima:  Well this start will make swedish fans sit up right :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ralfwil: looks like a cheap save in 4@s. Let´s see if the sacrifie had been correcy|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make after S has shown a black 2-suiter|pg||
nt|haans: names wrong|pg||
nt|april7: I'm very astount with 20 HP and 4 aces not to reach the slam, S figured N to have psyched perhaps|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North is  Magnusson|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: @c was 1310|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: declarer will know how to handle the diamonds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: depends entirely on @D play|pg||
nt|ybob: run trumps @S to K and @D to dummy = home|pg||
nt|jbgood: difficult not to end up in the favourite contract of them all - 3 NT - but 5@c seems to be better|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N makes for NS on a non -diamond lead... |pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: so Italy is EW, Denmark NS?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hello everyone|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: even on a heart lead a @D switch is obvious|pg||

nt|haans: all bidding go to 4@H down|pg||
nt|vugraphzxq: DAILY BULLETIN IS FALSED I AM CORRECT|pg||

nt|lestergold: north will try a finesse against the ten of diamonds sadly not on today|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Very unlikely to psych standing +28 on the first board of the segment|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes Shirley - on W it looks like 5@c is easy|pg||

nt|haans: hearts good placed|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: N has 8 top tricks and little chance for a 9th -- so he will run the clubs first in the hope something good happens|pg||
nt|lestergold: he can only play 3 rounds now as he needs one for a second entry to repeat the diamond finesse|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: seond heart discard may have been dangerous on a different layout|pg||
nt|xenya: now he might take the @D finesse -- seeing E has pitched 2 hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: strange play by E|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this 4@H looks better|pg||
nt|cuan: i don't think so|pg||

mb|1N|nt|xenya: -3 instead of 2, still a good save|pg||

pc|h9|nt|xenya: W woild love to put in a word, but the vulnerability deters him|pg||
nt|ralfwil: without a @h lead 6@s is makeable|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H lead difficult |pg||
nt|Walddk4: In Minsk?|pg||

nt|ritong: looks natural to play his trump at that point|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sfoxa: yes, here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@S is better as it does not need @Sk to be right|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|bessi2: unlucky lead for south here |pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: only for 6@s a @h lead will defeat|pg||
nt|xenya: @H lead is not impossible to find |pg||
nt|rnmalik: tough decision for E|pg||
nt|xenya: actually it looks quite logical|pg||
nt|ybob: to me impossible|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and BC Quantum comes from?|pg||
nt|xenya: well E can count on his @SQ to win a trick -- N should have both A and K on the auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not necessarily best, as South needs exit cards outside the spade suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and that removed one of them|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|xenya: and there it is|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he found it!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well done|pg||
nt|xenya: so E should try to set up a trick ina side suit, and that can be only @Hs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tho there is the danger of @C ruff in 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: yep add 1p more for that|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c7|nt|bessi2: but the contract is still doomed|pg||

mb|p|nt|flash: i've been trying to wade through the convention card...   the 1@H response could have many possible meanings|pg||

nt|xenya: oh i missed that -- did he make?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but the question was 6@s or 6@c from N and hand over to S to decide|pg||

mb|2S|nt|sybarra: clubs also |pg||
nt|haans: 2@C 9-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa: seems, 2NT as GF with fit becomes popular |pg||

mb|4C|nt|haans: Madala had no bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: unbelievable -- what made Zimmermann switch i wonder|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: wont get beaten in the trump suit, but I see some other losers |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @C has to has to have some meaning,  like gerber (I may get booted for saying that) |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 6@s before any other slam. If @s are 4-1, @c must behave and the slam similar to 6nt|pg||
nt|haans: they may use reverse transfers|pg||
nt|sybarra: did 2 @C promise just clubs or a 4 card major also|pg||
nt|haans: loook like natural precision|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think you are right Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: its not Wrang thinking I guarantee that |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: We will not see much of Iceland on vugraph after Dec 31 when we enforce the rule that no player with a surname longer than 10 characters is allowed to appear|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: The Chinese are just smiling|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Sveta can make it ... only just|pg||
nt|dima:  No avoidance play in @d suit for NystrÃ¶m here, likely to fail by a trick|pg||
nt|april7:  N will lead @S after the @D trick and the contract will be 1 off|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But without @hQ 6@s should be played on E|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will not do well for e/w |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a big mistake from EW....|pg||
nt|haans: may a swede say :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: this helps declarer |pg||
nt|dima:  making sure that partner splits his honors (if he has them)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: well if N/S allow vulnerable interventions of south's type on a festering suit  in a fersteing hand, then north should have gone more cautiously|pg||

nt|dima:  so about a small slam on a finesse through opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I know a couple of pairs who, after an obviously flat board like that, will try to needle the opposition - a comment like "Oh, well bid, good job we didn't get any higher, etc." ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: That sort of thing |pg||
nt|cuan: duck is wrong, after elimination|pg||

nt|dima:  Peter is not going to pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant they make 6 of either minor?|pg||
nt|dima:  So now we have some guessing games at the high level|pg||
nt|dima:  I think 12 tricks are available|pg||
nt|sybarra: dima you mentioned the possible 6 above|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|cuan: 2@C = 6@C or 5@C+4@D 11-15|pg||
nt|dima:  It is the matter of bidding, Nystrom gives a lot of leeway, but still might be pushed into "sacrifice"|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may "take" it early also |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa: if NS reach 5@d, EW can sacrifice in 5@s|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: short suit try no doubt|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its cold on the 2/2 spade break|pg||
nt|dima:  So far nobody know who is in attack who is in defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet the pass by W shows the ace  |pg||
nt|dima:  Now West might figure that partner is void in hearts otherwise would vul opponents go to the 5 level with only 4-card support?|pg||
nt|sybarra: W asking if it is his lead  (joke)|pg||
nt|dima:  East sorry|pg||
nt|haans: anyone know what system NS are playing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: i think it's better to throw 10 (2nd highest) from Q108x --makes things much clearer|pg||
nt|haans: right kick them|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jbgood: and hard to imagine why N let the opps win 3 nt by giving away the first club trick on  1|pg||
nt|haans: the must take 4 pronto|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: for me a pass on W is not so far away after 1@s from E|pg||
nt|haans: @DA + small|pg||

pc|cK|nt|sfoxa: yes, that was costly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @DQ or @cq|pg||
nt|dima:  I would not hurry about the swing - but surely very solid result|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sunsamvar: south may not be too happy with North's @h shortage|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland would approve|pg||
nt|xenya: NS play POlish Club i believe, so N's hand is almost super maximum for the 1@S opening -- and S's response was positive|pg||

nt|xenya: a @H lead might have given declarer some problem, but the contract should make anyway|pg||
nt|pelu: But I am just going for the CC - they are not partners this season - but played together for 2-3 years before|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a claim  |pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: but even on this lead 3N stands no chance|pg||
nt|xenya: seems we are heading for another flat result|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D = multi 3-10HCP|pg||
nt|haans: yes|pg||
mb|5H|nt|sfoxa: especially after 5-4 in majors by W, but we have comfortable chairs in our warm houses, and they have to play on the spot|pg||

nt|haans: most bid 1nt with weaker hand but not Norway |pg||
nt|haans: have seen it before|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose it depends on the range you play for 1NT in the fourth position |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can play 9-12, 11-14, or even 15-17|pg||
nt|dima:  Stayman and Smolen|pg||

mb|p|nt|bessi2: for east to hold 3127 + not open with a club preempt nv vs vul,  well it was possible but the finesse was with the odds i believe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a club lead will make things awkward, but how can East find that?|pg||

pc|cK|nt|serhat: Murat butun gun msn de bir acmiyor gorelim hatir soralim|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: Chemla can afford to bid 3N on this moderate 12 count  because opening bids in France are somewhat sounder than many play elsewhere|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double dummy there is an extra chance that the slam could also be made if the same hand holds 3 spades and four Ds and 3 clubs. so declarer might star: spade ace, club toward jack.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: a spec says --maybe they play 2NT as a natural bid , so 3@C must become Jacoby 2NT|pg||

nt|lestergold: very borderline|pg||

nt|dima:  NS might slightly overcompete in @c|pg||
nt|dima:  like 2@c - 2@s - 3@c - ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not exactly the bid N wanted to hear |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|haans: meaning U pass|pg||

nt|april7: ppX|pg||
nt|dima:  will become interesting :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but as there arent the entries to play club finesses from dummy declarer is forced to bang down club ace and with ace hearts with north thats 9 tricks to b made|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|ahri: and for curious specs: 1M-2NT is not natural. they play it as 10-11 with 4card support or any 6-9 splinter.|pg||
nt|lestergold: spades cant be continued so defence cant do anythinmg|pg||
nt|ahri: to be more precise, it's over 1@S; over 1@H, they play it one step below.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: basically a 50% slam here?|pg||
nt|ritong: i agree|pg||
nt|po-s: too good form a simple 3C?|pg||

nt|dima:  Well opponents have 8-card fit, South is still unlimited|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: not sure he is forced to do that. if heart ace or ten is doubleton he will have an entry to dummy and there are various club layouts he could play for to give him 4 tricks in the ...|pg||

nt|dima:  So good bad seem to apply|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: i expectea dim switch|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: me too|pg||

pc|sK|nt|sfoxa: which plan accepts declarer? playing for 4-4 in clubs or for 3-3 in hearts? both work, actually |pg||

nt|ritong: levy won t give up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not that NS are bidding like a pair who are sacrificing|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ritong: here we go|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 6@C here|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but no hearts lead then|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant actually see 3n going off but ill be surprised if they bid it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like misunderstanding here about 2C|pg||
nt|ritong: pass over 6@s is " i have first round @s control"|pg||
nt|april7: tough bidding from both sides|pg||
nt|sybarra: now?|pg||
nt|dima:  Do we see lowly promotion here :)?|pg||
nt|dima:  that @s 6 is looking sweet but will not help|pg||
nt|april7: X or 5@D, but the vulnerability calls for X, except N could be very weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems to me bidding 5 @d over 4 would have been better so opps do not know their major suit |pg||
nt|dima:  And we have a new leader again|pg||
nt|sybarra: S now worried  N could hold xx in spades |pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: 2N looks OK to me, but it is fraught here|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w are perhaps palu=ying in third bet dnomination at second best level|pg||
nt|april7: but then 4 @S might be on and 5@D only 1 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: no a happy play|pg||
nt|haans: not|pg||
nt|dima:  With flying colors|pg||
nt|april7: he is in "law"|pg||
nt|april7: no X by W???|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and looks like lucky to get out with a plus ascore with 2 dim ruffs to come|pg||
nt|april7: N has nothing to think about,but I think E is thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: spade lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -2 on a @s lead, but let us see|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: oh goodness me|pg||
nt|ritong: it is not that surprising|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Nice lead!|pg||
nt|haans: still time|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: one is with a natural trump trick|pg||
nt|ritong: the lead is|pg||
pc|h7|nt|po-s: Pass is probably forcing  but Fredrik wants to pass|pg||
nt|dima:  Was pass forcing?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: true but that makes the defence tally 5 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C Turbo = odd no of keys = 3|pg||
nt|haans: big hearts = NO|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: hard to predict the outcome |pg||
nt|ybob: best lead to NS|pg||
nt|xenya: even with this @D distribution, the contract might have a play i think|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: N is going passive -- looks like the best he can do|pg||
nt|ybob: if W discard @D = no way to win by @D|pg||
nt|ybob: from dummy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sunsamvar: hmm|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely Balicki isn ducking this?|pg||
nt|xenya: why not|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|haans: 6nt from E makable squeeze in red on S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wonder why S played the heart 4? 2 or 5 would seem normal according to methods. some sort of odd-even thing seems unlikely|pg||
nt|ritong: west visibly has mega double fit, and trump(s)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ritong: so, the @d A stands out, imho|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: balicki cannot knowm his pard has KS|pg||
pc|c5|nt|april7: W should have passed in the first place, has no business doubling 3NT IMO|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ybob: S shows 5@D now|pg||
nt|xenya: so far N has defended very well but it seems there might be another hurdle or two to overcome|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|dima:  Strong result for German team here coming|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bessi2: the lead didn't cripple declarer but it was always making|pg||
nt|xenya: they play 2/4 i believe|pg||
nt|haans: spades before hearts|pg||
nt|haans: declarer will like 3-1 clubs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or 2-2|pg||
nt|haans: sorry 3-1 right|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ybob: now 8@S , 10 @D , what discard ?|pg||

nt|haans: here a good slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: most fascinating this defence badgered declarer into avoiding the spade finesse so was very effective|pg||
nt|lestergold: cannot knock a defence that beet this contact when it wa laydown as cards lie|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to see how the 5 could hurt even playing that--in fact it would be easier to read as from 3 than the 4-spot is|pg||

nt|sfoxa: u-hu|pg||
nt|haans: did North really pass?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxq: yes|pg||
nt|dima:  EW play a system where 1@d could be 0 @d so gromÃ¶ller has an unusual decision to  make|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: by contrast, this hand looks easy enough|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rnmalik: I thought declarer had a chance after playing all the @C should have AJ@D, the N hand would be squeezed|pg||
nt|sfoxa: oops!!!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lucky on 6@C as 3nt somehow failed too|pg||

nt|lestergold: contract through- this defence showed why they are world class players in spite of the occasional wild bid made|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: How was the contract on previous bd laydown Mike ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: now 3 @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: it;s a cold slam|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lestergold: he could have evenbtually entered hand with a heart ruff and finessed the spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, they do tend to pay attention to their trick target at this level and defend accordingly, yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|haans: and off they go|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just seem the movie - North ducked two spades, then led @CK from hand. Not a success on the actual layout |pg||
nt|lestergold: defence were only due three bullets and two ruffs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 ruffs|pg||
nt|xenya: thy won't stop of 6@C now -- the question is whether they'll bid 7|pg||
nt|pelu: not so cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: S sounded like he had 6 spades I think |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A normal contract by a nice layout for EW|pg||
nt|haans: slam bidding much easier if 2@H promise 4 cards|pg||
nt|xenya: *short of 6@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was a courageous and imaginative defence in which he decided what to play his partner for and how to wrong foot declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: how to bamboozle declarer from taking the winning line|pg||
nt|xenya: and i'm told the other rable is in 7|pg||
nt|xenya: *table|pg||
nt|pelu: 500 against 650|pg||

nt|lestergold: this is surely an excellent granny|pg||
nt|dima:  S had to bid something|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 2 nt might have promised more|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa: and with nice start, as wee see|pg||
nt|dima:  with xx in @d does not really look appealing|pg||
nt|april7: ruff and cash K of @S and play @H, 10 tricks!!!|pg||
nt|dima:  That H9 in West hand is helpful|pg||

pc|dA|nt|haans: need to do right in clubs|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|sunsamvar: is 5@S asking for kings ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty easy to reach, one would think using splinters and KC|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect 4D was KC|pg||
nt|lestergold: you have to count 13 tricks i dont think everyone gets there thaty easily|pg||
nt|dima:  3@c X was duplicated in the open room|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he can count 12 tricks with 2 @D ruffs... but needs the @HK or @Sq for the 13th|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dima:  Smile :) seeing that @s 9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|lestergold: exactly not easy at all|pg||

pc|d6|nt|ritong: oole|pg||
nt|haans: suprise|pg||

nt|dima:  3@c went -2 in the OR so we have correction|pg||

nt|Walddk5: One of the few good boards Denmark had against Angelini. 5@C+1 in one room, 6@SX= in the other. 17 IMPs|pg||
