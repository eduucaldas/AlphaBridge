nt|aupillon: because of the economic crisis ( ? ) i am not in Monaco but besides my swimming pool|pg||

pc|d6|nt|haans: and only 1 clubs loser|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, everything lies favorably for declarer|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sfoxa: at least - prevent them from further bidding, if in doubt|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|aupillon: 4@c|pg||

nt|aupillon: in South|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: dont like 1@S opposite a passed pard|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S would be my choice|pg||
nt|othered1: dbl extras or penalty oriented or ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: extras i would think|pg||
nt|sfoxa: agree, 3@s would be better as a first N's move |pg||
mb|4C|nt|othered1: do you play 6@C for the @H break or try for @D ruff?|pg||
nt|othered1: or squeeze, perhaps|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spec ask me for resaults. Yesterday I was prommissed it til today, but sorrely nothing to get:(|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i wouls try for the diamond ruff single dummy:(|pg||
nt|aupillon: ype|pg||

nt|mgchat: +6 for Damiani|pg||
pc|hK|nt|aupillon: oui|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: a chance missed by e/w|pg||
nt|othered1: that was my thought, but with @S marked in north, some type of squeeze might also be attractive.|pg||
nt|gracelin: est took 1NT as showing both minors ? Shouldn't be as East can double with both minors.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|aupillon: sure. You are in Monaco. Monaco is in France, somewhat. Sun, beaches, etc... People are a bit lazy there|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR at 6@D on 10|pg||

mb|3C|nt|rodal f: Y but stil 12 in @C. Pitching 2@D at @H for 12|pg||
nt|aupillon: only do it|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Again it seems like declarer in OR just didn't take his tricks.  Wonder if that's accurate?|pg||
nt|aupillon: the same thing , under a convention|pg||
nt|ralfwil: interesting to see, but there are two aces missing (@cA and @hK)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Way too good to be called a Roland Slam -- but unlikely to get there.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|aupillon: 4 spades and drink Lavazza coffee|pg||
nt|rodal f: Lebensol variant at W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|aupillon: maybe a napolitan version :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: will east bluss a spade stop?|pg||

nt|othered1: What's 2@S?|pg||
nt|rodal f: If 4@S EW have a sac at @D for 500|pg||
nt|aupillon: they have a good sacrifice in diamonds. Elton John and radu Bataturescu mentioned this in their songs|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would rdbl to show a half stop|pg||
nt|othered1: and 3@H|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club at its best|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, all game contracts, 4H, 5C or 3NT, will make|pg||
nt|gracelin: of course, 3NT needs to be played by North|pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: 6C if no diamond lead|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed|pg||

pc|c8|nt|gracelin: in fact 5C is a superior contract than 3NT.  |pg||

nt|rodal f: All info we can serve u, sorrely no resaults: http://www.federation-bridge.mc/INTERNATIONAL-TEAMS-TOURNAMENT.html|pg||
nt|gracelin: the double finesse is the correct play in trump.  You lose one case KQ doubleton offside, but win 3 cases, KQ2, KQ8 and KQ82 on side|pg||
nt|haans: weak 2 here?|pg||
nt|gracelin: by south ?|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|aupillon: in Damiani's case I would have pushed. Sorry, this concerns only MY opinion|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|othered1: I'm surprised at west's play|pg||
nt|roswolf: another fascinating adventure likely here|pg||
nt|gracelin: not me in 2nd position.  One opponent has passed|pg||
nt|aupillon: Pushed to 6, i meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|aupillon: gate open for bets. Mine = 3NT NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: nobody passes 1m, nonvul, anymore|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: rdbl is good if not support|pg||
nt|haans: yes very very right conservative in second site|pg||
nt|aupillon: and try a nice lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: SATURDAY 10 : Intermediate Phase (14.30) Formula Swiss, 4 rounds of 8 boards : teams keep all VP won during the Phase of Qualification|pg||
nt|gracelin: but some partnerships open 5-card weak two systematically. Their 2H/2S are genuine weak two|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2D shows a weak two with only a 5-card suit.|pg||
nt|haans: very often in denmark|pg||
nt|gracelin: might be a good idea|pg||
nt|gracelin: Is north choosing between game and partial, or between 3NT and 4S?|pg||
nt|haans: loves being declarer|pg||
nt|gracelin: all depend on their weak two style|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|othered1: The good @C suit would lead me to open 1@C also, but that's far from a universal choice|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@c is a nice contract on this board|pg||
nt|aupillon: i ain't had the courage to say it ...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h2|nt|haans: some play n3@C = strong 3@D/3@H trf weak|pg||
