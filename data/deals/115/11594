nt|mdgraham: Good evening all|pg||
nt|haans: Allegra need an other bid win France have nothing to play for|pg||
nt|xenya: semifanals|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|haans: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/09Paris/Paris.htm Semifinal 12 boards each session (SEMI 48 boards)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe E-W would appreciate to have Danish flags rather than German|pg||
nt|haans: hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Haans|pg||
nt|Walddk4: besides, team names are reversed|pg||
nt|haans: RESULTS: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/09Paris/Results.htm|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w need to play in clubs.  otherwise no entry to E hand |pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi all and welcome!|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NS play strong club with lots of relays|pg||
nt|ralfwil: let us hope for interesting boards and Sweden has som IMPs to pickup|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Andy and Markku|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Ralf and Markku|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 12 boards so 2,1 imps per boad needed|pg||
nt|andyv:  first board close to a Roland slam|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ralfwil: good afternoon from Sweden|pg||
nt|haans: Hi 'Mike|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: Allegra Italy took 21 in last match but were still 4 p from a semi|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ybob: Hi all|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D 18-19 bal|pg||
nt|dima:  Good afternoon everyone - Swedish team has their work cut out for them|pg||
nt|haans: may be what they need|pg||
mb|2N|mb|d|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Roberto|pg||
nt|dima:  And we have a big board to start the 2nd segment with|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: close?|pg||
nt|andyv:  sure|pg||
nt|andyv:  only A@h being off stops it:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hej PO!|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6dias by N makeable double dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Hello Vladimir|pg||
nt|jbgood: good evening|pg||
nt|xenya: a routine 4@S to warm up|pg||
nt|haans: mini NT is not rutine|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The player names are reversed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 11 tricks in @c after a @S lead, but more difficult or impossible after a @d singleton lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: maybe even in practise|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: on a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's a Roland slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Po:)|pg||
nt|po-s: that´s what I meant - close means nearly - this one does make|pg||
nt|andyv:  true...I forgot N would be playing it:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sunsamvar: actually i expected a minor suit bidding war here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Angelini-Versace do not play mini-NT. E-W do|pg||
nt|april7: Hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|dima:  Likely GromÃ¶ller-HÃ¤usler will get to Grand here - they were very efficient in the 1st segment|pg||
nt|andyv:  but this should be a huge pick up for NS|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: must win this trick and play @d|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: no but i xpect the contract to be reached in the OR as well -- probably on a different auction|pg||
nt|xenya: oh|pg||
nt|april7: S is looking for an adequate bid to find out about the K of @C to get to 7, he will find it I suppose|pg||
nt|dima:  Now (if they play sort of standard) South knows that North is 1=5=3=4 or actual shape so 13 tricks is matter of keycards|pg||
nt|sybarra: its not a game hand....3 nt is down on any lead |pg||
nt|mmmakela: can make a lot of tricks here,11 that is|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|haans: this is not good for sweden|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: do look balanced but yes they may have changed|pg||
nt|haans: italy are playing game here|pg||
nt|sybarra: E bit "reluctantly"  and W found good discipline here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @s is the only suit E can establish an entry to clean trumps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: wow lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|april7: this bid doesn't help at all|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry i was responding to a spec who suggested 3n|pg||
nt|dima:  OUCH !!! Serios misfired|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  and he should get the @ds right|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: Germany 77 Denmark 70 Italy Allegra 65|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Paris for the 8th European Champions' Cup. Twelve teams divided into two groups. Matches of 20 boards in the round-robin. This is a round 2 match ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: from group A|pg||
nt|dima:  Well this start will make swedish fans sit up right :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: must because even if E had the Q clubs could be blocked as here|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ralfwil: looks like a cheap save in 4@s. Let´s see if the sacrifie had been correcy|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make after S has shown a black 2-suiter|pg||
nt|haans: names wrong|pg||
nt|april7: I'm very astount with 20 HP and 4 aces not to reach the slam, S figured N to have psyched perhaps|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North is  Magnusson|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that @h 10 also saves with a missguess in @d|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: @c was 1310|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: declarer will know how to handle the diamonds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: depends entirely on @D play|pg||
nt|ybob: run trumps @S to K and @D to dummy = home|pg||
nt|jbgood: difficult not to end up in the favourite contract of them all - 3 NT - but 5@c seems to be better|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N makes for NS on a non -diamond lead... |pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: so Italy is EW, Denmark NS?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hello everyone|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: even on a heart lead a @D switch is obvious|pg||
nt|xenya: and that might well have been the scenario had they bid it|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|sunsamvar: will make on the probable @S lead tho|pg||

pc|s4|pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: No @h8 is high enough|pg||

nt|andyv:  hi Dima:)|pg||
nt|dima:  Very early in states now?|pg||
nt|andyv:  Board 1 will be a big swing for EW|pg||
nt|andyv:  8:38am in LA:)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  made darker by a power failure earlier:)|pg||
nt|dima:  NystrÃ¶m made 2NT X in the other room, just the start swedish team needed|pg||
nt|andyv:  this 3N should go down in flames|pg||
nt|dima:  So the gap is only 14 IMPs all to play for|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dima:  well - well just another @h or spade play and declarer wraps up 9 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  true...W may have difficulty in guessing what to shift to...maybe 3@h by E on first trick was a clue|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|andyv:  playing something like reverse smith, E could play the 4-2 of @d to discourage a @h return|pg||
mc|9|nt|dima:  I agree since count looks irrelevant @d 2 then 4 might indicate clubs|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: hello Rashed|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H for NS -- a sacrifice by EW might prove too expensive|pg||

nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|haans: have not seen that prempt before :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wasted points in @S will doom this 3 nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: well an unlucky habd for N/S here no play 3N likely to be flat tho |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as you say, a killing lead|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|xenya: of course nothing can make S to stop short of game|pg||
nt|ritong: 1410 points at stake|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: now 4@H and W ?|pg||
nt|haans: But Multon has |pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: ok 4@S X|pg||
nt|xenya: now you take the money|pg||
nt|haans: all bidding go to 4@H down|pg||
nt|vugraphzxq: DAILY BULLETIN IS FALSED I AM CORRECT|pg||
nt|dima:  I think there was misunderstanding - S meant that 3@h fixed trumps and 3NT was a gadget asking for Q|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can this help NS to a nice contract = 5@d?|pg||
mb|d|nt|jbgood: hi Sigurbjørn|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bessi2: this will drift -1 quietly |pg||

mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: 4@h in the limit for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: north will try a finesse against the ten of diamonds sadly not on today|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dima:  Very unlikely to psych standing +28 on the first board of the segment|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes Shirley - on W it looks like 5@c is easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: so it was a misunderstanding|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2009Brazil/Systems/bermudabowl/germany/wladow-elinescu.pdf|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: please Elisabeth, tell us who is who|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: 3nt a make|pg||
nt|haans: hearts good placed|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: N has 8 top tricks and little chance for a 9th -- so he will run the clubs first in the hope something good happens|pg||
nt|lestergold: he can only play 3 rounds now as he needs one for a second entry to repeat the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|haans: must be lavinthal to @D|pg||
nt|ritong: it is|pg||
nt|mmmakela: S limited to 16 points bec 1 @C 17+|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|xenya: on second thoughts, the save looks cheap enough|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: the@D return  is best i think|pg||
nt|ybob: 500 if play A @S first|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S has no choice|pg||
nt|xenya: now declarer might go wrong|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|dima:  Nice lead by Fredrik NystrÃ¶m|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: seond heart discard may have been dangerous on a different layout|pg||
nt|xenya: now he might take the @D finesse -- seeing E has pitched 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: and mouiel would have played the queen if he had it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so hard for N to see 5 dias is on|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: and nowthe bad news|pg||
nt|xenya: we are a bit confused|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sunsamvar: putting the screws on east|pg||

nt|lestergold: as predicted tho a push|pg||

nt|haans: Hej Ralf Markuu Avram|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so back to 24 imp diff|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rnmalik: strange play by E|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this 4@H looks better|pg||
nt|cuan: i don't think so|pg||
nt|dima:  With a nothing hand and no move in a major from Partner he figures that partner has values in clubs. |pg||
nt|haans: OR open with som ekind of weak 2 and opps go on|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: -3 instead of 2, still a good save|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c is makeable on NS|pg||
nt|bessi2: sometimes one doesn't notice the plausible losing options seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|haans: may be go higher|pg||
nt|dima:  Though I think the result exceeded expectations|pg||
mb|2C|nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: only ! lead defeat 6@S|pg||
nt|ybob: @H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Duck first @h and ruff it hign och the next round for discard of 2 @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is a "heavy"  1 nt imo |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|xenya: anyone knows NS's system?|pg||
nt|haans: but can take 5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may have too' :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: game for e/w either 3n or 4S |pg||

nt|haans: sweden had a bad 12 boards|pg||

mb|3C|nt|ybob: strong @C |pg||

mb|p|nt|ybob: i think ...|pg||
nt|haans: all did right|pg||
nt|haans: Antonio what does that mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxq: less 2 on the 2 i will correct|pg||
nt|xenya: ok|pg||
nt|dima:  Notice the absence of X or 2@c overcall opposite passed partner ...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Do you know why S didn´t support @c PO?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kiwibridge: 3@C was a game bid|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Sveta Bodrenkova|pg||

mb|5C|nt|haans: 1nt did show 15-17|pg||
nt|sybarra: but agree with  1 nt  as there is not good rebid |pg||
nt|sybarra: if you open 1 @C |pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  A couple of vulnerable undertricks here|pg||
nt|haans: BC|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Hans - for me W´s hand is at least 18|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was my point on "heavy"  1 nt |pg||
nt|haans: which mean flat board (good)|pg||
nt|sybarra: its an prime hand also |pg||
nt|sybarra: with the aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa: Hello to all, sorry for being late - rush hour in the rainy evening dosn't look good )))|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: W woild love to put in a word, but the vulnerability deters him|pg||
nt|ralfwil: without a @h lead 6@s is makeable|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 6@C is cold regardless of lead|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H lead difficult |pg||
nt|Walddk4: In Minsk?|pg||
nt|haans: despite that it looks like the normal bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: looks natural to play his trump at that point|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sfoxa: yes, here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@S is better as it does not need @Sk to be right|pg||

nt|haans: 5@C much better than 3nt :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: most NS sequences are just relays if they open bidding|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|bessi2: unlucky lead for south here |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only for 6@s a @h lead will defeat|pg||
nt|xenya: @H lead is not impossible to find |pg||
nt|rnmalik: tough decision for E|pg||
nt|xenya: actually it looks quite logical|pg||
nt|ybob: to me impossible|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and BC Quantum comes from?|pg||
nt|xenya: well E can count on his @SQ to win a trick -- N should have both A and K on the auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not necessarily best, as South needs exit cards outside the spade suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and that removed one of them|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: and there it is|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he found it!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well done|pg||
nt|xenya: so E should try to set up a trick ina side suit, and that can be only @Hs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tho there is the danger of @C ruff in 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: yep add 1p more for that|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|bessi2: but the contract is still doomed|pg||

pc|cK|nt|xenya: 4@S would have issues i think|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: natural to play in 3n when all suits stopped and fits only a 7 carder|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C was not relay so natural|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: After teh @s support I prefer 6@c from N and S has to choose between @s or @c. What´s your opinion?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: even a dim lead would not have beatn 3non this kind layout|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what id @Sk and @Ca were exchanged|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what if|pg||
nt|xenya: S can see his fate -- if he ducks, he will be endplayed eventually... |pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: good play here|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @DJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sunsamvar: but he can also see that the duck will disrupt declarer's communication|pg||
nt|xenya: now 11 tricks are available|pg||
nt|xenya: true Sunil|pg||
nt|dima:  Cullin - Upmark reached 7@c on N1 in the OR so sweidish team starts with a bang in this segment|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: 6@S a better contract slight misdefend and home.|pg||
nt|ybob: i prefer play 6@S , without @H lead need 3/2 trump|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, the idea occurred to me during the bidding and i liked it|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But there must be some reason, even if it is relay. - showing his hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2C|nt|andyv:  question on this hand is how fast can you put the brakes on|pg||
nt|dima:  Likely 1NT is something conventional for this pair|pg||
nt|dima:  East has put his 2 cents in - he will brake now at every turn|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry. was away - on which nbr|pg||
nt|andyv:  he's hoping N bids|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  off the hook and out of here!|pg||
nt|dima:  Specs confirm that 1NT would be 4@h + longer minor|pg||

mb|p|pc|sA|nt|dima:  well with 5 trumps you might take your plus in 100s|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm impressed|pg||

pc|s4|pc|h7|pc|s7|pg||
nt|andyv:  i wouldn't... i confess I'd bid 3@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  7 card suits aren't supposed to be shut out at the 2 level|pg||
nt|dima:  Well if you make you are 110 if they go down 1 only you are 100 so what's the point?|pg||
nt|dima:  And partner surely being short in @d decided not to bid ...|pg||

nt|andyv:  most pairs wouldn't have 2@c available anyway in that position so W would have bid 3@c to begin with:)|pg||
nt|dima:  Anyway now it is purely academical discussion, let see what they score in 2@d|pg||
nt|dima:  Now west will shorten both hands playing clubs every time|pg||

nt|xenya: oh i missed that -- did he make?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but the question was 6@s or 6@c from N and hand over to S to decide|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, at 800, I am sure that he will be equable about it |pg||
nt|haans: often showing cards|pg||

nt|sybarra: either works |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: superficially, that is a bad result, but it would not be surprising if it was flat|pg||
nt|haans: semi are to be played 48 boards today|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 32 points and a 5-card suit on EW must be enough |pg||
nt|stc: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Interesting to see what happens if E does not show his @s|pg||
nt|haans: 6+4 por 7|pg||
nt|haans: or|pg||
nt|mmmakela: S will balance|pg||
nt|stc: ending in 4@s ?|pg||

mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: and a routine 3N here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Dima :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: clubs also |pg||
nt|haans: 2@C 9-14|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sfoxa: seems, 2NT as GF with fit becomes popular |pg||
nt|sybarra: but probably play nt?  no ruffs |pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: Madala had no bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just the sort of dummy you want|pg||
nt|haans: only cards to 3@S i think?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: unbelievable -- what made Zimmermann switch i wonder|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: wont get beaten in the trump suit, but I see some other losers |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @C has to has to have some meaning,  like gerber (I may get booted for saying that) |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 6@s before any other slam. If @s are 4-1, @c must behave and the slam similar to 6nt|pg||
nt|haans: they may use reverse transfers|pg||
nt|sybarra: did 2 @C promise just clubs or a 4 card major also|pg||
nt|haans: loook like natural precision|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think you are right Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: its not Wrang thinking I guarantee that |pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes, S could be weaker|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: We will not see much of Iceland on vugraph after Dec 31 when we enforce the rule that no player with a surname longer than 10 characters is allowed to appear|pg||
nt|stc: wladow doubled one trick to early but he will still collect a  lot|pg||
nt|haans: many assume partner has 5-6 p 8-9 if balancing|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk4: The Chinese are just smiling|pg||
nt|jbgood: some play it as invitational +, but "nobody" plays 2 NT as natural after a major opening any more|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sveta can make it ... only just|pg||
nt|dima:  No avoidance play in @d suit for NystrÃ¶m here, likely to fail by a trick|pg||
nt|april7:  N will lead @S after the @D trick and the contract will be 1 off|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But without @hQ 6@s should be played on E|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will not do well for e/w |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a big mistake from EW....|pg||
nt|haans: may a swede say :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: this helps declarer |pg||
nt|dima:  making sure that partner splits his honors (if he has them)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if N/S allow vulnerable interventions of south's type on a festering suit  in a fersteing hand, then north should have gone more cautiously|pg||
nt|pelu: West cant bid 1NT over 1@S - 1Nt = 15-17 - so he has to bid 2@C|pg||
nt|stc: -500, may -800 ?|pg||
nt|haans: -400 i OR|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sfoxa: yes, living in the European bridge suburb...|pg||
nt|haans: 9th trick in clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N by E would be slightly better here, but 4@H is also OK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dias shift now?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what had happened after pass from E? only an academic question|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: a flat board  - next|pg||
nt|dima:  Not too much of help :)|pg||
nt|april7: E might have ducked this and N could perhaps continue for a ruff,then the contract would be made|pg||

nt|haans: hi Mike |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Hi Mike welcome along|pg||
nt|haans: u missed nothing |pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, don't seem to have missed much - three flattish hands |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all quiet so far|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the sort where you will probably go down a packet, and there is diddly-squat on for the opponents|pg||
nt|haans: i think pass|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mmmakela: now the @C loser goes on hearts if plays A|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice defence!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: this looks a bit too high -- apparently N was hoping for a better hand with S for his vulnerable overcall|pg||
nt|april7: it was a chance|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S =assume some steath but not forcing|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: and this 3N seems to have three club tricks and two in each |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|xenya: there's no chance at all|pg||

pc|c2|nt|ritong: let s make it 1 NT was optional|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jbgood: all of a sudden a good slam..|pg||
nt|dima:  With 10+ black cards there could be another action then 1@s overcall|pg||

nt|dima:  Also some easy minor suit contract for EW|pg||
nt|dima:  so about a small slam on a finesse through opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I know a couple of pairs who, after an obviously flat board like that, will try to needle the opposition - a comment like "Oh, well bid, good job we didn't get any higher, etc." ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuan: 2@C = 6@C or 5@C+4@D 11-15|pg||
nt|dima:  It is the matter of bidding, Nystrom gives a lot of leeway, but still might be pushed into "sacrifice"|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may "take" it early also |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sfoxa: if NS reach 5@d, EW can sacrifice in 5@s|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: short suit try no doubt|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its cold on the 2/2 spade break|pg||
nt|dima:  So far nobody know who is in attack who is in defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet the pass by W shows the ace  |pg||
nt|dima:  Now West might figure that partner is void in hearts otherwise would vul opponents go to the 5 level with only 4-card support?|pg||
nt|sybarra: W asking if it is his lead  (joke)|pg||
nt|dima:  East sorry|pg||

nt|lestergold: and i do not care if a panel of world champions recommend a vuil spade overcall with 7 points and a loust suit with both opps bidding i will still say they are all crazy|pg||
nt|ritong: so, an impressive string of disasters|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, club heart squeeze.|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|sybarra: all the other cards should be in N hand,  right Dima|pg||
nt|stc: Sweden runing out of boards, needing 3 swings with 7 to go|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|bessi2: but that diamond finesse seemed highly indicated to me|pg||
nt|ritong: readers had translated by themselves|pg||
nt|cuan: finesse in diamonds was free|pg||
nt|sybarra: is E going to bid @D or @H?|pg||
nt|haans: @D lead 4@H down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: depends on N as I see it. If I had been N 5@c|pg||
nt|haans: no big swing here|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: (or most) |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: West could have avoided that by playing @HK first|pg||
nt|mmmakela: E's playing strength quite low in that opening hand|pg||

mb|3C|nt|xenya: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=805&qshowflag=1  running scores Group B|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i like Chelma's 3 nt.. no info divulged|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well spotted everyone|pg||
nt|haans: more spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: better avoid 3N...|pg||
nt|haans: maybe 3@H is 2@S say no hearts|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
nt|sybarra: do you X again by W or bid 5 @D?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now perhaps 5@d from E|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now starts dbling|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: but even on this lead 3N stands no chance|pg||
nt|xenya: seems we are heading for another flat result|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D = multi 3-10HCP|pg||
nt|haans: yes|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sfoxa: especially after 5-4 in majors by W, but we have comfortable chairs in our warm houses, and they have to play on the spot|pg||
nt|dima:  Strong @c and semipositive I guess |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I haven´t got any information about nationality on NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: check back sequence |pg||
nt|sybarra: my bet is E bids @H at this point and he did |pg||
nt|haans: and will not get a @D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard likely to be doubling on majors |pg||
nt|sybarra: and you have one |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: they are from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thx|pg||
nt|sfoxa: good stop of S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting double - I wonder why not 1NT|pg||
nt|haans: most bid 1nt with weaker hand but not Norway |pg||
nt|haans: have seen it before|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose it depends on the range you play for 1NT in the fourth position |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can play 9-12, 11-14, or even 15-17|pg||
nt|dima:  Stayman and Smolen|pg||
nt|sybarra: smolen |pg||
nt|haans: but does he dare|pg||
mb|d|nt|bessi2: for east to hold 3127 + not open with a club preempt nv vs vul,  well it was possible but the finesse was with the odds i believe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a club lead will make things awkward, but how can East find that?|pg||
nt|haans: only double dummy|pg||
nt|haans: had still beeen a make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, rise with @CQ|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: Murat butun gun msn de bir acmiyor gorelim hatir soralim|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Chemla can afford to bid 3N on this moderate 12 count  because opening bids in France are somewhat sounder than many play elsewhere|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double dummy there is an extra chance that the slam could also be made if the same hand holds 3 spades and four Ds and 3 clubs. so declarer might star: spade ace, club toward jack.|pg||
nt|xenya: provided NS don't do something silly later|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry was writing that before N played....that is exactly what he did and why|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: then you can find 6-2 in spades|pg||
nt|mmmakela: SOTM yes |pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: 5-2|pg||
nt|april7: now its time for EW to go down|pg||
nt|dima:  @c break will be tough to manage :)|pg||
nt|dima:  @d lead seem to be indicated by a hand and the bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes typing same |pg||
nt|ralfwil: and the 3@c opening will make the @h situation very clear - or?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: I just do not see enough tricks |pg||
nt|dima:  So another couple of vulnerable undertricks|pg||
nt|stc: looks like -1|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@S might be tempting here |pg||
nt|jbgood: di after heart ace would suffice I think|pg||
nt|haans: must play 2 @H|pg||
nt|haans: must take 2 tricks in hearts preferable now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now by reduction S knows N's heart holding|pg||
nt|stc: if not they will take an extra @c trick|pg||
nt|haans: do not like 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so can play small now and N will switch to dias|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|haans: what wasw that?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think this is the limit. 4@s|pg||
nt|xenya: but it's a poor contract|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@S i mean|pg||
nt|xenya: so a nice stop|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If @h was not 5-1, 6@s had a chance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: big delay in my chat reaching the screen|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @Cj to cater for West having 4 clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 off but probably a push|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: well you need 3-2 @Ss and a finesse -- perhaps a bit more|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: on the last board, the @D8 return was for sure a heart signal - West led back the @H3 |pg||
nt|mdgraham: which East obviously took as a request for another diamond |pg||
nt|mdgraham: deep waters|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/09Paris/Paris.htm   are the results here? |pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: the finesse is on, @Ss are 3-2, but the @H split puts paid to the slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also no double finess in @h|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: schamoly|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: odd that East did not continue with spades |pg||
nt|mdgraham: holding three entries|pg||

nt|ritong: he should not|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

nt|haans: this is a deal to talk about|pg||

nt|stc: AQ@s A@D K@S -1|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|xenya: i'm a bit surprised he hasn't touched @Ds|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bessi2: ofc.. that is by far the best play.. almost guaranteed that way|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|haans: they have 6 boards|pg||

nt|april7: very good defence!!|pg||

pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: LHO is unlimited|pg||

nt|xenya: endplay? but S has 3 clubs|pg||
nt|dima:  NS might slightly overcompete in @c|pg||
nt|dima:  like 2@c - 2@s - 3@c - ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not exactly the bid N wanted to hear |pg||
nt|mmmakela: grandmaproof|pg||
nt|stc: easy to play, no so easy to reach|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|haans: meaning U pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as someone who dislikes the Michaels convention, it is quite satisfying to see one get taken out on a stretcher|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then? |pg||
nt|april7: ppX|pg||
nt|dima:  will become interesting :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but as there arent the entries to play club finesses from dummy declarer is forced to bang down club ace and with ace hearts with north thats 9 tricks to b made|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|ahri: and for curious specs: 1M-2NT is not natural. they play it as 10-11 with 4card support or any 6-9 splinter.|pg||
nt|lestergold: spades cant be continued so defence cant do anythinmg|pg||
nt|ahri: to be more precise, it's over 1@S; over 1@H, they play it one step below.|pg||
nt|stc: I think 2@d is any game forcing|pg||
mb|3H|nt|xenya: basically a 50% slam here?|pg||
nt|ritong: i agree|pg||
nt|po-s: too good form a simple 3C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may be the "get out bid" |pg||
nt|dima:  Some Good-Bad on the way|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: pard to bid 2 @C now |pg||
nt|haans: the normal contract|pg||
nt|haans: yep cc say so|pg||
nt|sastro: 2 @D gf|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: which will get X'd|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: no, I like 3NT in fourth seat|pg||
nt|haans: then we agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: strange situation for good bad|pg||
nt|dima:  tougher to X 3@c now since it might be for 3@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: Nystrom had no problem say X |pg||
mb|4N|nt|ybob: 4@S win 1 imp at least|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 imps i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well life made very eay for declarer now|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Tx Tomislav. What are N/S carding methods ?|pg||
nt|ritong: .|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at last, a tea hand|pg||
nt|cuan: fantunes eventually playing by est. they played weak notrump.|pg||
nt|dima:  Well opponents have 8-card fit, South is still unlimited|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not sure he is forced to do that. if heart ace or ten is doubleton he will have an entry to dummy and there are various club layouts he could play for to give him 4 tricks in the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: round suits|pg||
nt|dima:  So good bad seem to apply|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lestergold: i expectea dim switch|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: me too|pg||
nt|ahri: CC says Smith, SP discards; udca |pg||
nt|ahri: so @d5 is spades in the context now|pg||
nt|xenya: both teams need a big win if they want to have a chance to be in contention|pg||
nt|dima:  Well this time is really BAD :)|pg||
nt|po-s: difficult to run to 3H - cheaper I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: and who should run? |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa: which plan accepts declarer? playing for 4-4 in clubs or for 3-3 in hearts? both work, actually |pg||
mb|6H|nt|dima:  So swedish supporters have smiles on their faces.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: 10 @H lead + Q @C + A @D|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong red King by West|pg||
nt|dima:  500 territory |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: oh yes, 1 on a @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: @sJ was a nice card for declarer|pg||
nt|haans: llucky them|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: strong hand as dummy|pg||

nt|andyv:  did they have their X?|pg||
nt|josj: that's easy,according to the lawbook|pg||
nt|dima:  I would not now - the message was probable partner you are not making 1@h|pg||
nt|josj: but might be difficult to explain to THIS pair|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|dima:  Law book call this inadmissible but I found it funny anyway|pg||
nt|dima:  To such a pair you dont explain you RULE :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  this could go down a lot:)|pg||
nt|josj: many inadmissible things are quite funny...|pg||
nt|andyv:  good thing N has the 7@hs|pg||
nt|dima:  But can also be ducked ... disaster|pg||
nt|josj: 3NT by N seems an easy make...|pg||
nt|andyv:  any reason for E not to take Ace?|pg||
nt|dima:  Trying to keep communications open ... but then S might well have9 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess E might think pd has QJ10 of @d and suit will block|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||

nt|april7: with @C J appearing on second round|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lestergold: e/w with a comfortable part score in dimaonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: or a rout of 1n|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: Diwali is a big Indian festival of lights with lots of fireworks :)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: backwash|pg||
nt|lestergold: in fact 3n by e/w is not without chances|pg||
nt|ritong: levy might go high here|pg||
nt|ritong: since 2@h probably shows @ss and @cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: another interesting hand...|pg||
nt|sfoxa: should this dbl have special meaning, or...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and as this is not a Gambling-3NT type auction, you cannot blame West for the lead. Against an opening 3NT, West would likely lead @SA and then switch to hearts, which would defeat ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT. But I would still open it in fourht seat.   |pg||
nt|haans: easy 2nt for me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: France of course made 3N on 6 and are in it again on 7 to open up a decent lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this 2@h overcall is really scary - 1@S?|pg||
nt|dima:  not easy but as advanced sacrifice vs 4@s|pg||
nt|april7: W saved S probably!|pg||
nt|dima:  Not so easy to steal here though, now NystrÃ¶m will have a chance to bid 4@d ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to find the spell checker for commentators |pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|haans: you can first write it in Word then copy it :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: like that in Word. It´s a challenge for BBO|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: The D a penalty I belive and the RD T/O|pg||

nt|cuan: 2NT = good onesuiter |pg||
nt|haans: looks like slam is possible|pg||
nt|cuan: impossible to wrong in hearts|pg||
nt|haans: natural bidding 1@C-1@S-3@C and off|pg||
nt|dima:  Now 5@d?|pg||
nt|haans: unlucky no 3nt now|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C was "other suits"   |pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: no comment|pg||
nt|ritong: i m not fond of two suited overcalls either|pg||
nt|ritong: especially with medium hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S is making, so NS have a good save here|pg||
nt|ritong: levy won t give up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not that NS are bidding like a pair who are sacrificing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: here we go|pg||
nt|stc: so the final will be Angelini-Bamberg, a Champion's Cup classic !|pg||
mb|2C|nt|haans: 6@C here|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but no hearts lead then|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant actually see 3n going off but ill be surprised if they bid it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like misunderstanding here about 2C|pg||
nt|ritong: pass over 6@s is " i have first round @s control"|pg||
nt|april7: tough bidding from both sides|pg||
nt|sybarra: now?|pg||
nt|dima:  Do we see lowly promotion here :)?|pg||
nt|dima:  that @s 6 is looking sweet but will not help|pg||
nt|april7: X or 5@D, but the vulnerability calls for X, except N could be very weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems to me bidding 5 @d over 4 would have been better so opps do not know their major suit |pg||
nt|dima:  And we have a new leader again|pg||
nt|sybarra: S now worried  N could hold xx in spades |pg||
nt|haans: 1H GF most hand without splinter|pg||
mb|2D|nt|xenya: 2N looks OK to me, but it is fraught here|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w are perhaps palu=ying in third bet dnomination at second best level|pg||
nt|april7: but then 4 @S might be on and 5@D only 1 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: no a happy play|pg||
nt|haans: not|pg||
nt|dima:  With flying colors|pg||
nt|april7: he is in "law"|pg||

mb|2H|nt|lestergold: and looks like lucky to get out with a plus ascore with 2 dim ruffs to come|pg||
nt|april7: N has nothing to think about,but I think E is thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: spade lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -2 on a @s lead, but let us see|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: oh goodness me|pg||
nt|ritong: it is not that surprising|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Nice lead!|pg||
nt|haans: still time|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: one is with a natural trump trick|pg||
nt|ritong: the lead is|pg||
mb|3C|nt|po-s: Pass is probably forcing  but Fredrik wants to pass|pg||
nt|dima:  Was pass forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: true but that makes the defence tally 5 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C Turbo = odd no of keys = 3|pg||
nt|haans: big hearts = NO|pg||
nt|stc: 1H GF was already too much :)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|xenya: hard to predict the outcome |pg||
nt|ybob: best lead to NS|pg||
nt|xenya: even with this @D distribution, the contract might have a play i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: N is going passive -- looks like the best he can do|pg||
nt|ybob: if W discard @D = no way to win by @D|pg||
nt|ybob: from dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: hmm|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely Balicki isn ducking this?|pg||
nt|xenya: why not|pg||
nt|haans: system did well here|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 6nt from E makable squeeze in red on S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wonder why S played the heart 4? 2 or 5 would seem normal according to methods. some sort of odd-even thing seems unlikely|pg||
nt|ritong: west visibly has mega double fit, and trump(s)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1|pg||
nt|haans: but sadly|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ritong: so, the @d A stands out, imho|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: balicki cannot knowm his pard has KS|pg||

pc|hT|nt|ybob: S shows 5@D now|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|dima:  Strong result for German team here coming|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bessi2: the lead didn't cripple declarer but it was always making|pg||
nt|xenya: they play 2/4 i believe|pg||
nt|haans: spades before hearts|pg||
nt|haans: declarer will like 3-1 clubs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or 2-2|pg||
nt|haans: sorry 3-1 right|pg||

nt|xenya: *short of 6@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was a courageous and imaginative defence in which he decided what to play his partner for and how to wrong foot declarer|pg||

nt|dima:  How many @d is declarer supposed to cash?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess one |pg||
nt|po-s: had he cashed a diamond first|pg||
nt|dima:  Dentist coup is extracting exit cards from defender @d A in this case|pg||
nt|sybarra: how does he know it should not be 2?  or just hope?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: don t ask me why, i have no idea  i would have considered @h A first, içn case west holds Qxxx  i m so naive|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: yes! looks easy|pg||
nt|jbgood: 12-14?|pg||
nt|rodal f: By 2 ten's I belive N will make an invit|pg||
nt|bessi2: if i was a betting man i would bet 10-12|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S = 7-11 card @S|pg||
nt|april7: if its 2 it doesn't matter, so cash only 1!!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is some special treatment of 2 @H |pg||
nt|dima:  Well if @d are 2-2 he is home dry since last spade is likely to be with East|pg||
nt|po-s: only one since if they are 2-2 it is ok -  but here was not easy.. they have a heart entry as well|pg||
nt|dima:  We all seem to agree :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pelu: 5 card @s|pg||
nt|april7: bravo!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx all for info,  |pg||
nt|dima:  That 2@h shows both majors?|pg||
nt|dima:  Some action again|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting... 6 spades?|pg||
nt|haans: must be negative no spade|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: Hi Jon:) |pg||
nt|haans: Norway did find an unluckly slam on 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: looks like it! Hi Frank|pg||
nt|dima:  Lightner double :) lead a heart and get @d ruff - just kidding|pg||
nt|april7: but not 6 @H,its interesting|pg||
nt|haans: but took time|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 nt? |pg||
nt|sybarra: or 2 @C |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I want to live in 1 @S |pg||
nt|haans: or xx = help|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: another option |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: N does not know if S has any clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: let us see if they can reach it after a strong 1@C from S and negative !1D from N |pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that was made to look easy|pg||
nt|april7: E should X not W!!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: W will be sorely disappointed to see the aces come down in dummy |pg||
nt|april7: K!!!!|pg||
nt|haans: and xx must mean ok with diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: the landed right here|pg||
nt|haans: they|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: N will surely lead trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: some play here that X of 3@S = dont lead @S - so the pass = lead @S|pg||
nt|pelu: on a small !§S declayer have some problems|pg||
nt|pelu: after @s to 9 and 10 decl has to take 9 tricks - or there will be 5 for defense|pg||
nt|pelu: 25 to Italy after 2 not so good slams by the danish|pg||
nt|cuan: 3@S = strong twosuiter 5-5 heart+minor|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dima:  How can Bertheau find a @s shift now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: k of @C for spade shift |pg||
nt|dima:  I think it is matter of agreement - @c J might be asking for UNUSUAL shift|pg||
nt|sybarra: am told K only shows Q |pg||
nt|april7: thats true|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: then with club switch and D duck declarer has zip|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|dima:  Now it is a crunch time as they say in USA|pg||
nt|april7: W can't imagine a 7-5 distribution, but the 6 @C bid!!!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t know what´s happening at the table, but I don´t like N´s thinking in this situation and after that a pass!|pg||
nt|haans: folled them?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|xenya: seems they are on their way?|pg||
nt|haans: what kind of bidding was that?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 9 was unlucky for Norway. One of those random swings which can go either way. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: after 3rd spade i mean|pg||
nt|Walddk5: One of the few good boards Denmark had against Angelini. 5@C+1 in one room, 6@SX= in the other. 17 IMPs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jbgood: 6 boards ahead of the OR :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@c?|pg||
nt|haans: some use 2nt lebensohl here|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rcerreto: very thin, but it makes|pg||
nt|haans: an easy make :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any guesses on 3@S? Spade values?|pg||
nt|haans: you have a point there|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: of course 2N here could be too high spade lead and then dim switch and revert to spades looks lie would defeat 2n|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dima:  Another doubled slam missing 3 keycards and a key King comes home|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|xenya: great!|pg||
nt|lestergold: laltho let thru in open|pg||
nt|rcerreto: think so|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ybob: easy to Mihov :)|pg||

pc|c5|nt|pelu: yes - now :(|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ybob: 7 now|pg||

nt|ybob: Q @C stiff|pg||
nt|april7: its not over yet!!!, shouldn't cover|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 6@S was meant as a save over 6@C of course. The best sacrifices are the ones that make|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ybob: impossible !!!!|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: good defence here beating 2s as dims will be cutt off|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: I have an explanation for 4@C - North with other partners uses 1NT over the double to show clubs.|pg||
