nt|Walddk5: Hello Andy and Ed|pg||
nt|andyv:  Good morning Roland and Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Andy!|pg||
nt|andyv:  first hand seems a simple 4@h |pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome to Stara Zagora for an 8 board match|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Mike, Momchil and Deyan|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: Good morning, Andy|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Andy |pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Roland|pg||
nt|othered1: kThe prevfious match featured a number of very unusual auctions.  Wonder if it will continue here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Ed|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Roland |pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Star6i|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|vugraphzym: 2@H is 13-16 points 5+ @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Deyan:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N probably an inquiry as to type of 2@s raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: rehi, everyone!|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: rehi, Ed|pg||
nt|mamos: game for ew|pg||
nt|mamos: although North doesnt think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Hi Deyan:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hello silvia and specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: that 3@D bid gives chance to EW to find the 5@D save|pg||
nt|andyv:  if NS find their game|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzym: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pass by S seems very tame|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: rehi silvia|pg||
nt|marlowepi: does 1D maybe DENY diamonds?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Roberto Mart√≠nez|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Roberto|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: although 4@S is a bit double dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: normal auction, so far, good suit in south making up for 1/2 point high card shortness|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think S hand worth more than an invite|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk5: Welcome back to Rado Radev|pg||
nt|rado: hello:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Rado|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Constantin Stancescu|pg||
nt|stc: hi, buna ziua|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi Deyan|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may be pushed into it... although it looks like NS are out of ammo|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s looks too expensive now|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he can make 4@S |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzym: has to play small @C to earn an entry|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N is a mp bid|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk4: Hello Ed and Andy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Deyan, our operator|pg||
nt|othered1: west reasonably passed over 1N.  Not sure if it was judgment or a systemic lack of an appropriate call (i.e., double has a conventional meaning)|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, Roland!|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hi, Roland|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  but N sees losing the first 3 tricks and still not sure where rest of tricks are coming from|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: good part score for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N can make 6@S and 4@C |pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  as it turns out|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Silvia, North has a Reunion flag :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: It's very pretty|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: thx :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ybob: nice bid 3@S :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks like it can make|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't agree.  depends on actual 1N range and non-vul considerations aren't all that different from matchpoints.|pg||
nt|stc: A@d beats, now too late|pg||
nt|stc: but of course dec must guess @H for 4tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is the indicated play after N imprudently bid the suit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: Hi, Andy!|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|ybob: maybe lead @S defeat|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Momchil Aleksandrobv|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Ed:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4D a doubtful decision as almopst surely going minus|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rado: after friendly lead declarer has 9 top tricks and will try @D to develop more|pg||
pc|h5|nt|stc: right, he knows that @h are 4-2, but S may have 10x|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mamos: now fairly straightforward|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|andyv:  and hi again Deyan!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odds against it, esp when N went out of way to bid 1H|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: somewhat more likely with KTxx than Kxxx|pg||
nt|stc: agree,4 cases for 10x and 6 for xx|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|star6ija: hello everybody :)|pg||
nt|ybob: home now|pg||
nt|ybob: hi :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: shoulb be careful though|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: should*|pg||
nt|ybob: A @D shows AQ|pg||
nt|ybob: singleton @C not play to singleton @D too|pg||
nt|ybob: S shows 4@S 6@H|pg||
nt|ybob: J @D, A @H @H ruff ,  AK @S , @H discard = end play to W|pg||

nt|vugraphzym: Hi, Andy. Thought you were asleep :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Mike Gold|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer's of course is unaware that the @h suit is behaving|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: sth strange happened|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not normally awake at this hour so I may make more errors than the players!|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Andy|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  this hand going painfully slow...and I can imagine NS not happy the way things are unwrapping|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't need that excuse Mike:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like E may have trapped himself in his hand and was unable to get @hs started?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: yes at the end he had to play A@H and a @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: but I didnt understand how that happened|pg||
nt|lestergold: My geography was not my best subject at school could you enlighten me as to which countries these respective teams belong to?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: they are not showing their cards :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  Had to get up sometime|pg||
nt|andyv:  mp only that you want a plus score... i think game is better than 50% with the S hand...good 5 card major and 2 10s|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S  Romania    E-W  Bulgaria|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Stara Zagora is the organiser of the event.It is in Bulgaria. And the other team is from Buchurest (Romania)|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx Roland|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N looks playable for EW|pg||
nt|star6ija: nice distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Geoff|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: EW are playing precision|pg||
nt|star6ija: 7@c is possible, but...|pg||
nt|mamos: grand certainly looks a possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he put 1NT and then changed it :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Dayan, do you know their NT opening ranges?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think it is 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|vugraphzym: 2@C should be @S and another suit|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rado: W has minimum neg dbl here|pg||
nt|othered1: this should go very quickly -- you have a 20-count and partner jump supports  you . . . |pg||
nt|andyv:  AQ10xx suit will almost always produce 4 tricks and 5 tricks a good portion of the time|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: 3N by West probable diamond lead and no sweat|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 2N is invite, it is a heavy one|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, matter of style, I guess... I like being aggressive with those hands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: as Roberto pointed out the timing is very important in such boards - as we like to say in Bulgaria "1 second careless = dead for the rest of your life" :)|pg||
nt|rado: E has a choise rebiding weak @H, 3 cards 2@S or upgrading to 2NT protekting minor Kings|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|stc: A part score in @h for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  wow....wonderful!!!|pg||
nt|andyv:  oops:)|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S?  |pg||
nt|othered1: Fast arrival?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 2NT should be invitational hand yes|pg||
nt|rado: hi Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from chilly central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hi, Ed|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Good morning, Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  E sequence usually reserved for hands that are just short of game forcing  bids|pg||
nt|lestergold: any lead except a club helps and no one is kicking off with the stiff club ace|pg||
nt|star6ija: this 2@s bid from S is not good option... in this vulnerability strong club has to be sa descriptive as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|mamos: have Ns agreed a suit?|pg||
nt|star6ija: @Ss? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think 1@C is natural, star6i|pg||
nt|mamos: was 1@C strong or nat?|pg||
nt|star6ija: if so ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS sure have a lot of points on this hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree for playinig for 9 tricks.  But it's likely you'll be playing for 10 in @H with flat hand v. flat hand|pg||
nt|othered1: 7N is off the top and playing 7 elsewhere is just running risk|pg||
nt|andyv:  then bid 2@c and jump to 3N;)|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the auction you find in the post-mortem, but not at the table by either the players or commentators.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Joe Stokes|pg||
nt|jstokes: Hello all|pg||
nt|stc: hard to reach now :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: even a spade lead sets up a spade trick for declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  Ed, ever have hands where you just have too many bids?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Joe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has some communication issues on the last hand. i think he needed to let the first spade ride around to his hand|pg||
nt|stc: and 2@d will make, good result for EW|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ybob: :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: theyare trying to strike back immediately|pg||
nt|othered1: very rarely, but in my partnerships (the few that remain) we define things very tightly.|pg||
nt|andyv:  the N hand would give me a headache here|pg||
nt|othered1: 5N?  2 keys, plus Q, plus void?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction will run out of steam quickly|pg||
nt|mamos: North thinks it's Hearts :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: 7@cs depends on some precautions which should've benn made by declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it will be interesting if 6@H are bid wheather E will double :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: Hello Andy and Carl|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Carl and roland|pg||
nt|ybob: down 2 AK @S low @C , later ruff @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s would have set trump and asked for cue bids|pg||
nt|mamos: ugh|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 7@S* looks the minimax|pg||
nt|mamos: well it makes but this has not been a good auction imho|pg||
nt|star6ija: 12 tricks are easy|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 1@H response, to get a natural rebid from partner.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  all roads lead to 9 tricks, Mike? :))|pg||
nt|othered1: second best spot, but safe here.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|andyv:  they got there.... good thing this isn'|pg||
nt|andyv:  isn't a BAM event:)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Deyan:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it didnt run out of steam that quickly :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they decided to bring it to a boil:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - this auction not for the faint hearted...|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, the question is why E didn't simply open 4@s if that was what he was intending to bid all the time?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ironically a club lead and declarer has to do abit of guesswork|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably no over tricks|pg||
nt|rado: lack of communications between NS will help declare for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: this will claim as soon as both follow to one trump|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  this can go down 500 easily|pg||
nt|ybob: 4/2 @S shows even and interest @C|pg||
nt|star6ija: but @d now will bring the contract home|pg||
nt|othered1: Right -- a hand worth 2@C in playing strength but with inadequate high cards for the call.|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe even 9|pg||
nt|rado: sure with @S suit favourable|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: I thought that was standard, but east's action here is what I see regularly at the table.  Times changed, I guess.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|sharkey: set before they get started|pg||
nt|andyv:  a pretty steep price to pay to protect against a partial|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think so Ed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N had played 2@D on the A of spade so he was obliged to play it|pg||

nt|sharkey: yes - if make only lose 170 points|pg||
nt|sharkey: not the game bonus in addition|pg||
nt|andyv:  2 questionable bids (2@h and 4@s) produce an inadaquate result|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the ranking after the previous round : http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
nt|star6ija: I think that Romanians made it well, as far as agressive Bulgarian pair at the other table might have reached grand and clubs and to chose losing option which is equal as ...|pg||
nt|star6ija: percentage to the winning one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6H by W has play|pg||
nt|jstokes: six needs a lot, but it is there -- resting in game seems more likely to me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when S preempts spade king is located in favorable position. then if necessary showup squeeze against N, but here clubs are 33 so turns out unnecessary|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|andyv:  easy slam for EW and easy safe for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  save|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h for EW|pg||
nt|stc: NS can make some @s, 2 on trump defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  right|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@H EW|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@D is cold, but 6@S is a fine save.|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N for EW|pg||
mb|4N|nt|andyv:  yes, 6@s almost makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: South's Pass is interesting|pg||
nt|mamos: North's 4@D is more interesting|pg||
mb|5D|nt|othered1: On a good day, 6@S might even make|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d now|pg||
nt|stc: but we see 4@h and 4@s phantom save|pg||
nt|stc: we may see|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  W thrilled with pd's dbl|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS still not underbidding...|pg||
nt|sharkey: especially S|pg||
nt|andyv:  how would you have bid the W hand, Ed?|pg||
nt|ybob: cold 7 tricks|pg||
nt|rado: and again some chases for more|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in other words, once S openes 3S, slam is a favorite to make|pg||
mb|5H|nt|jstokes: then again ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nice bid by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@h a bit aggressive|pg||
nt|mamos: West has tremendous playing strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: the minimax here seems to be 6@H*|pg||
mb|6H|nt|sharkey: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|othered1: Not that way.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think this is the optimum way|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: though 4N, if clearly unusual, is decent, planning to convert 5@C to 5@D, thus a slam try (if partner doesn't think you have a red 2-suiter)|pg||
nt|andyv:  would you think about passing the first time and "limping in" later?|pg||
nt|star6ija: playing yes but not defensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well in spite of 4/1 heart break and unfavourable position of KS E/W have  plenty of strength t make 4h here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results and standings after 3 rounds at   http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s lead will make it very tough|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose a dim and 2 spades must just take care with the timing|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: this makes it very untough tho|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would seem so|pg||
nt|marlowepi: serdika teammates wont be pleased|pg||
nt|stc: a beer for me :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|othered1: This makes, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes... shoud make 5|pg||
nt|andyv:  should|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: surely East will bid 5@s|pg||
nt|jstokes: a bit timid of East not to double, although there would be no guarantees|pg||
nt|stc: anyway, no double no trouble|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzym: she just claimed|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sharkey: unless something happens in the @D suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be able to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: At his vulnerability, all passing would do is give NS a chance to find an eventual save.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|nt|lestergold: South may be thinking that the best defnce holding 4 trumps is to try and set up a force in which case diamonds was the best prospect|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: bearing in mind that the diamond bid didnt promise diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't understand the need to play @ss immediately|pg||
nt|andyv:  now @d and @d ruff, forcing E to ruff with Q may create real problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: shout a dim straight back altho better if draws a trump ot so first|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|ybob: 8@C look to @S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos: thats quite some three boards to start with|pg||
nt|star6ija: 17 IMPs back to Romanians|pg||
nt|mamos: why do you think South passed as dealer?   too good for 2@H?  too poor for 1@H?|pg||

nt|othered1: a game-slam swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  board 2 cast Leromain 9 imps as they played 1N in OR|pg||

nt|lestergold: 20/20 hcp division|pg||
nt|andyv:  and plenty of action|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S 4S?|pg||

nt|rado: 5@C makable with unlikely @S guess|pg||

nt|marlowepi: time|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|sharkey: shud end here|pg||
nt|mamos: double by South seems normal|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: I expect N/S to reach 4S and eith diamonds bid declarer will play play spades for only one loser|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks like N needs to play the right @S honour in 4@S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: I open south's hand, but our initial actions are sound and wouldn't criticize a pass if they open lightly in 1 and 2 pos.|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but it is both the natural way to play the spads and the indicate way on the overcall|pg||
nt|mamos: problem on next round|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should dbl here|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: you can find results here : http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rado: good 3 card raise - nice distribution and Txx in trump|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: 3@H makes |pg||
nt|andyv:  who wants to be in it?|pg||
nt|andyv:  borderline hand but you do have the majors|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: in any case a small spade from hand and a cover of any spade that east plays is a safety pklay here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  this should go down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 2@H looked like last makeable spot but you cant blame S for bidding on|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS likely to get overboard|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mamos: no |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: should always only lose one sapde trick with this combined holding|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  this contract should be no problem|pg||

nt|andyv:  can easily go down 2 or 3 vul against a partial|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|rado: declarer must restrict his loser to 2 Aces and 1 trump|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|sharkey: yes - shudnt be hard to find @D shift when N in with @SK|pg||
nt|othered1: You want to play  trumps to avoid 3 losers there, if the rest of the hand allows that|pg||
pc|sT|nt|othered1: I consider the raise normal, though it might be heresy in some parts of the world.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is the worst kind of trap bidding by W|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you have something tio say, say it as early as possible|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jstokes: yes, give the free run and then when they get too high, come to life and bid -- not a good strategy :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|andyv:  very little for the defense to initiate...just have to wait for declarer|pg||
nt|mamos: on Board 2 reaching 6NT was a fantastic swing for NS as in Open Room 6@H was not a success|pg||
nt|ybob: i cant understand @C at trick 2 ...|pg||
nt|rado: 1@D ruff and 1@d on Q@h and then trumps|pg||

pc|sK|pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|vugraphzym: isnt he down now ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  this isn't the way to make the hand|pg||

nt|rado: no:)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ybob: 10@H stiff make this easy|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly this is the most challenging defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: a matter of timing here|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he will shift to @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: is there a trump coup? I think no|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|cindy:  sorry all   i had phone call i had to take   here now :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ybob: is this a reasonable line :) ?|pg||

nt|othered1: I'm told east was 3rd in this year's Bermuda Bowl, which may put 2@H bid into context.  Players who are successful at that level have confidence they'll make whatever they bid :)|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|vugraphzym: hello ed|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi Ed !|pg||
nt|andyv:  E must be impressed with the outside strength of his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  i would bid 4 with S hand|pg||
nt|othered1: 10 cards in 2 suits, favorable vul: bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't understand that lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  any game try will get NS too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: well South should be content with 2H his pard hasnt made an unassuming cue bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s too high at 2H!|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 losers 2 spades 2 dims a club and a dim ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: admittedly north's raise with two trumps and a collection of quacks under the openiong bid wa pretty pointless|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ???|pg||
mb|2N|nt|othered1: 3@C a relay?|pg||

nt|andyv:  and S has yet to be shy in this set:0|pg||
nt|sharkey: i agree Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: you pass with north because you o not want to see pard's expression when you table that as dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N thought for a long time and passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: and his partner could be splinering as it was it was close to a splinter|pg||
nt|ybob: 5@H = 300 |pg||
nt|rado: 5@h is cheap but 5@S easy too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|andyv:  N 1N opener hit pay dirt|pg||
nt|sharkey: "looks like 1 NT - open 1 NT"|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... i like 1N with N cards....too awkward to describe hand if you open 1@D|pg||
nt|sharkey: Leromain picked up another 5 IMPs when W opened 1 NT in OR and played there|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he just claimed|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H = 5+ @H  13/16 pts |pg||
nt|ybob: WOW|pg||
nt|othered1: but it's a good one, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  gave up a club trick so I'm no so sure how good it is|pg||
nt|othered1: gave up a trick?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it hasn't yet but it's frozen the suit so N can never lead it|pg||
nt|othered1: What other lead beats it?  South wins @D and plays another @C before east can drive last @S, no?|pg||
nt|andyv:  now E can play the hand straight up|pg||
nt|mamos: 43 imps have changed hand son Boards 1-3 so -300 may be the flattest board yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: you can go down in 5@S|pg||
nt|ybob: defeat 5@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  7@c great contract except for 4-1 break|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: and still you can make |pg||
nt|othered1: very careful auction by west.  an immediate 6N, just quantitative, would appeal to many|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Nice pass by east, for play in @D, but 3N is there for the taking.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is 2 off at least|pg||
nt|ybob: good lead|pg||
nt|rado: yes due unvaourable trump break|pg||
nt|jstokes: did that really show spades and a minor?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: are we looking at the right diagram?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  all 7@c requires is 1 @s ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: in my book N hand a clear 1 NT opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: a trump lead would have been  reasonably murderous|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: It's good to have very tight agreements when  you embark on an auction like west's.|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|nt|othered1: is 4N a sign-off?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks like RKCB|pg||
nt|othered1: coiuld be, or west could be cue-bidding in rank order.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: what, then, is 5@S?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: playing K may mislead south|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think anything else beats it... I just don't understand leading from Jx of a minor when pd has opened a major.  Why not lead pd's suit?|pg||
nt|othered1: inspiration counts|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would also make me open suits that I don't want the lead because I know pd will never lead my suit:)|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't hate that lead at all.  South does have enough @H length that he might decide to try to attack elsewhre|pg||
nt|andyv:  would you hate the lead if the club honors were split?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: some talking about the bidding between W and S|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|sharkey: 4@H OR as well|pg||
nt|mamos: well not many points here but the contract looks a good one|pg||
nt|rado: facing 5th fit and heraing 4@C values + fit @D lead is logical|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: Pays your money, takes your choice, it says.|pg||
nt|andyv:  end result was disappointing (to the specs and us, that is)|pg||
nt|othered1: Wow, after the double, that @SJ promotes.  Wonder if west had alternatives to 6N?|pg||
nt|othered1: alternatives that would have continued the auction|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|sharkey: EW have to their @S trick or making 12|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and 5S is -- how should i say it? -- not obvious|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 2@H was misbid|pg||
nt|jstokes: maybe he meant to bid 2@D and bid 2@H|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|andyv:  just for partnership trust, I don't think N could ever pass 3@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 off end of story|pg||
nt|othered1: 2 rounds of @D and claim|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: at least W did not bid the slam|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  now he leads a @h?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  game set and match|pg||
nt|lestergold: two bad bids Andy|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|othered1: But maybe north should have enouraged @C at trick 1, or if they play upside down signals south should have continued|pg||
nt|andyv:  J@c turned out to be a good lead... S had to follow thru|pg||
nt|othered1: did north discourage or did south ignore it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N could have ducked @D to hand and then it would have been down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: W went out|pg||
nt|othered1: Little old ladies at the club would have gotten there in 2 bids and wouldn't have put pressure on the partnership's confidence in their agreements|pg||

nt|andyv:  i think they will find it... but then, I thought they would find it here:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thinking his partner has a michaels hand, W has 2 choices: 3S and 4S. The former suggests a save, and leaves the decision up to the hand that may have defense--the exact same ...|pg||

nt|mamos: was NT 15-17 here?|pg||

nt|vugraphzym: yes* |pg||

nt|andyv:  20|pg||
nt|jstokes: east could go passive here -- oops|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ybob: can be A or K @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think E had to try...W hasn't shown much of anything|pg||

pc|d6|nt|lestergold: must set about ruffing hearts immediately|pg||

nt|stc: could bring 7IMP if EW play part score in @c|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: premature use of ace of dims|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ybob: @S now|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the results after the round robin http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: yes, assuming south has a reason to overcall, north's auction looks very normal, though some might cue-bid to show support or take other positive action, per system.|pg||

nt|mamos: and despite some favourable lies of the cards North still goes 2 off|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if heart ten does not unequivocally mean "diamonds", then EW have some talking to do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but that hand does help explain the phantom save earlier|pg||
nt|cindy:  true but think its difficult to stay out of 3N with the E hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|ybob: 500 5@D X , cold 5@S|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is a typical example of "Partner, only me and not you know that 3N is more expensive than 2 or 1" from both sides of the table - invitation with 8 points and accepting with 15|pg||
nt|ybob: hand  with 50 hcp to E|pg||
nt|rado: some will open even 4@S at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I am one of those|pg||
mb|2H|nt|othered1: 3N best, as independent of @S suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry got booted. you mean they missed the obvious cold 4H on the previous one?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This NS pair like to get in at the 1-level.  Some, if playing weak jump overcalls, might have bid 2@D on morth's hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: wahtr about ending at 2C|pg||
nt|lestergold: easty might venture in |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 1N seem useless and gave west the free cue-bid|pg||
nt|ybob: I think they play jump overcall 12/16|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: sry - cant help youDeyan:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't understand N's pass|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mamos: this time I have more sympathy with NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I actually like the 3NT by N :) he has terrific 15|pg||

pc|sA|nt|othered1: Thanks, I've seen hand 13, which went by before I arrived.|pg||
nt|ybob: :9|pg||
nt|ybob: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@D or 6N is simply on finesse|pg||
nt|ybob: better 500 to NS|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: in my book 1 NT rebid wud show 18-19 and Dbl the actual hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i ould have bid 2S with N hand i think|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  if they play variable NT, this might have a different meaning for them|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - obviously|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3C looks makeable|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d has to be some type of checkback, but 2@s looks like sign off|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|stc: some don't with Hxxx in the other major|pg||
pc|s7|nt|othered1: So, slam and no slam are both reasonable|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d not even on a finesse|pg||
nt|othered1: really?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 6@s can't make|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  but otherwise I agree..1N shows about 18-19|pg||
nt|andyv:  this has a chance now|pg||
nt|sharkey: N willing to push to 4@H here - to much when pd didnt superaccept I think|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: how do you make 6@D without finesse?|pg||
nt|andyv:  you are right...need the @c hook to dump the @s|pg||
nt|andyv:  early morning disease...stupidity|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: cant you discard your @C on hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  but still have a @h and @s loser if you do that|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, then lose @HA and @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I see|pg||
nt|andyv:  and there we have it|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N with qxx of dims somehat foolhardy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Squize at N now:)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence can only cash first 7 triks|pg||
nt|andyv:  conceivable for EW to take the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: you can find results after 3rd round here -> http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: dimaond lead guaranteed|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: is the 4 the right @D to lead ? |pg||
nt|lestergold: even if for any reason declarer was allowed to win this trick its cold off|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: I think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: cant you block the suit ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i think 4@d is ok here|pg||
nt|andyv:  but J@d better|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes you can but doesnt matter with east havinmg an entry and if east hasnt an entry the contract would make|pg||
nt|andyv:  suit will block up period|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I would have led the J or even the K probably|pg||
pc|hT|nt|othered1: This can put EW right back into the match, if OR pair takes the other side of the 50-50 shot.|pg||
nt|othered1: Or could lose a couple of imps if they play 6N|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm trying to find the part of the auction which shows the @d fit has been found|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|andyv:  ugh|pg||
nt|lestergold: stuill only 8 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they have bid a forcing club, no? i have a onesuited hand, with a few measly hearts on the side|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: 6@D, choice of slams?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think 5@D might suggest @D game but not sure|pg||
nt|othered1: allowing a trick 1 claim|pg||
nt|andyv:  that sounds plausible|pg||
nt|rodal f: :(|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  ugh|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: and I dont like this 4@H bid by N because still S can have only 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: there is possible endplay now|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: no there isnt sry|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: now E has no idea about the suit|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|nt|othered1: 5?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  backward squeeze:)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|othered1: Board 4 was a swing when NS played 2@H in OR, making and holding loss to 5 imps v. the EW 2@H here -300|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|sharkey: but things happen...|pg||
nt|andyv:  E needs to learn patience on defense|pg||
nt|sharkey: easy game...|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: best now W to discard the K@D :) |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|mamos: but here North hopes that West has all the values in @D and that the NS hands will fit   I think this is a bit unlucky|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h4|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|andyv:  has to take finesse|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  from going down to making|pg||
nt|lestergold: contract now firgidised by east|pg||
nt|andyv:  I can't conceive what type of @D holding E gave S on opening lead... did he really think that S had KQx of @d?|pg||
nt|lestergold: frigidised|pg||
nt|andyv:  E is not playing bridge... just throwing cards now|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: still hasnt played it |pg||
nt|vugraphzym: holding the A in hand |pg||
nt|lestergold: then what was partner getting in with to lead his presumed QJ( of spades through with|pg||

nt|andyv:  same thing, Mike:)|pg||

nt|ybob: 3NT best spot , win too 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: Andy you are trying hard to be polite straining at the seams Id say|pg||
nt|andyv:  See Ed...board 5 was a swing board:))|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  empathy, Mike... we've all been there and done things at the table that later on we have no idea what we were thinking about.|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|vugraphzym: I think S's hand was pretty good and there was a finesse on and still down 1|pg||
nt|ybob: slam time|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  wonder if EW are playing non forcing free bids...that would explain double instead of 1@S bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: not clear who is buying this hand 3h N/S limit already reached|pg||
nt|jstokes: S wishing he had a penalty double here.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes - some of it not suitable for the Family Hour :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  12 imps picked up on Board 7 as strangely, they didn't get to that fine 4@h contract:0|pg||

nt|rodal f: Sr for interrupting. Could not stand it. Leaving in ten min for my next set.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: last board in a very iowscoring affair|pg||

nt|vugraphzym: sure|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: 3S a brave effort vul all on his own|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|rado: but he decided to jump reverse immy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sharkey: 2@C a variation of New Minor Forcing...?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D I mean|pg||
nt|ybob: i prefer play 10 from dummy to invite another @D round|pg||
nt|andyv:  E came here to bid:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: prtner has promised a good hand with a good 6 card suit he happens to have neither|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d very playable|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if west is going to bid it should be 4s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5D needs a lot of good guessing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c a dim  heart and a spade to be lost on a bad day|pg||
nt|andyv:  only @d hook... but if N covers 10@S immediately, 5@d will go down|pg||
nt|ybob: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: after west supports @H, east will push the rest of the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: no way they can miss the slam now|pg||
nt|rado: facing strongest sequence available E has to check key  cards only for grand:)|pg||
nt|othered1: East's black honors are key in an auction like this.|pg||
nt|andyv:  always welcome Frank|pg||
nt|stc: NS very conservative here, going to loose 9 IMP|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|andyv:  i play it as forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 5@D goes down with a @C switch aftrer K @H|pg||
nt|rado: rkcb for @H maybe|pg||
nt|othered1: Only question for east may be whether a black suit might be more solid than @H.|pg||
nt|ybob: 5@H = 2+Q @H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|star6ija: this is a nice event... actually it started in the year of 2005 as Balkan Championship|pg||
nt|othered1: with west having a possible pitch on the @D.|pg||
nt|rado: AQJx Qxx x AKJxx might be W's hand:)|pg||
nt|ybob: i play 6Nt with E hand|pg||
nt|othered1: That's what I was considering|pg||
nt|rado: so after KC reply some pick a slam bid would be nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: W is holding his head|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he seems not to understand 4@S bid|pg||
nt|othered1: if you have a pick a slam call available after setting trumps with RKC|pg||
nt|ybob: kickback ?|pg||
nt|rado: if E had 4-4 in Majors with FG he may bid 4@S directly, so now he has more|pg||
nt|ybob: i dont like a 4¬∫ suit in a Fg sequence|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzym: W alerted 3@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d may have a more realistic chance of a plus score|pg||
nt|andyv:  if they find the switch...pd doesn't always have 5 for his 3 level raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: now he alerted and explained RBC|pg||
nt|rado: btw other room stoped at 4@H|pg||
nt|rado: so a swing expected|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharkey: agree Andy - 2@H may have been non-forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  looking for @c slam?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'll settle for a 1-imp loss of 5 when I stop short of the grand.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Andy, the humorist by swings|pg||
nt|cindy:  i believe in sound overcalls but still think N might have bid 1@s at this vul|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sharkey: has it chances... but will probably fail|pg||
nt|star6ija: Mr Toni Rousev from Stara Zagora, supported by some local enthusiasts helped the idea to come true|pg||
nt|sharkey: how many nations participate Momchil?|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS used their rabbit's foot on this auction|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|s3|nt|andyv:  slam asperations died a quick death|pg||
nt|sharkey: this may be trouble too...|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2 years ago Balkan Championship started to change its locality... Bucarest year ago and Novi Sad (Serbia) - November this year|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner can show count|pg||
nt|othered1: In other room, I think east didin't give enough value to the black honors|pg||
nt|andyv:  tough to stay out of gameon this one but well done by EW|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent exhibit supporting the principle that the hand short in enemy suit has to go out of its way to act. here colors are in NS favor|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|othered1: A little lucky that 6@H is so playable,  6N didnt seem to be under consideration.  Guess ruffing out long @C suit was possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: and still looks like they are going down|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  if N is listening:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: or dont they have such sophisticated kit|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, Mike, pay up:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: pay up?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: they are playing only 4 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: although if W didnt have J of @C a club switch would have been vital even in 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, they should try to defend it properly|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ybob: What if W hand was AQJX QXX Q AKJXX ?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|star6ija: we have record concerning the number of the participants this year|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably want to take @c hook thru N|pg||
nt|ybob: or AQJX QJ X AKJXXX|pg||
nt|othered1: 23 highs and misfit isn't automatic to push to game.|pg||
nt|andyv:  need @d switch|pg||
nt|othered1: won't @C back also work?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: see you after lunch break :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|andyv:  what do you do on j@s then?|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: probably he decided S has long @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D10 shud enforce @S signal|pg||
nt|othered1: claim time|pg||
nt|stc: on 14 EW managed to stay out of 3NT for 7IMP|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|star6ija: 12 teams from Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Greece and Sweden take a part in the competition|pg||
nt|rodal f: No. 10 then on one original trumh trick at @S with a new pitch in @D|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|lestergold: at least it would have been an attemopt to make the contract|pg||
nt|othered1: That second hand with QJ tight in @H isn't possible -- 3@H would be criminal in my eyes|pg||
nt|ybob: bid you 4@C with this hand ?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4 boards to go in a very tight match|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N also had 2 pitches on the club... their system doesn't allow them to tell pd what suit to shift to?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S is betting N's major is not @s|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@H -p - p- dbl?|pg||
nt|othered1: multi may work OK here, avoiding 3-level dive, not that 2-level will be a pleasure, either.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|othered1: NS should get to a quick 4@H here.  EW competition won't be effective, as 4@S isn't a good save|pg||
nt|othered1: If south doesn't bid it, north will accept an invite|pg||
nt|andyv:  now, this is a grand that will be fun to get to|pg||
mb|d!|nt|othered1: I play 2@H as takeout of @S, wonder if east does, too.|pg||
mb|2D|an|3+!H, stronger than 2!H|nt|star6ija: hello everybody :)|pg||
nt|othered1: If so, a high @D contract is possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: personally, I don't think the second hand is worth a jump shift|pg||
mb|3C|nt|othered1: 3N?  Sound preemptive raise?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess so|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 4@h?|pg||
nt|othered1: but what, then is 3@C?|pg||
nt|andyv:  a suit|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|andyv:  wow, the 1N opener going further down the scale|pg||
nt|andyv:  to the illegal zone in the ACBL|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks like 9-11 in green vs red|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think pitching @D from the top shud have conveyed the message Andy|pg||
nt|sharkey: N passed...|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: they missed the slam in the other room as well btw |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi!|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer needs to duck this club |pg||
mb|d|nt|star6ija: this is popular convention in Serbia... shows limited raise to 4@hs (4+ trumps) and Ace outside|pg||
nt|andyv:  won't happen|pg||
nt|lestergold: I didnt think he would|pg||
nt|othered1: and forcing?  2@H must not have been just for takout.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Hi everyone held up at the dentists sorry|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: ty.  specifying side Ace could be very useful|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I agree Carl...I'm just amazed that with all the pitches they couldn't come up with the right answer.|pg||
nt|sharkey: must be different range 3rd hand opening 1 NT?|pg||
nt|ybob: now ? 3@S or 4@C ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  W won't let this stop here|pg||
nt|othered1: West wisely continues|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: real @H support, providing an easy, natural rebid makes the difference to me|pg||
nt|othered1: how does west possibly get across such good support, 4-cards long?|pg||
nt|othered1: RKC could come up short the @DQ.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I thought 4@h bid was an obvious choice for that|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ybob: ??|pg||
nt|othered1: do we know why 2@C was alerted?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it shows at least 9 minor cards|pg||
nt|ybob: m¬¥s i think 9 + cards|pg||
nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it can be 5@C and 4@D|pg||
nt|ybob: playing strong @C i prefer rebids 3@C shows 5 / 5 m¬¥s max|pg||
nt|othered1: I'll be surprised if south bids again, on the misfit without knowing of extra @C length.|pg||
nt|ybob: hard to S|pg||
nt|ybob: HX  X  5/6@D  4@C ...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ybob: 3@D shows 5+ @D 4@C ...|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm more comfortable making an immediate strong bid on the south hand, like 2@H, if available.  Prevents decisions like this one, since partner would know of possible slam interest ...|pg||
nt|othered1: right away.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now an avalanche of tricks for the defence|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: Hi Robert and Ed|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  in the ACBL, any NT that has a range of less than 10 cannot use any conventions with it (xfers, stayman, etc)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: J of spade confused the declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he must be wondering who is lying|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW seem to be getting bogged down again|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: a brave pass of the second round takeout double denying much high card strenth|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: ducking wouldnt have helped tho|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  I guess they knew what they were doing:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  nicely done|pg||
nt|ritong: impressive|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: S asking about the bidding|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|othered1: can set up a @C but there's no useful pitch|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: but as cards lie 3S has no play|pg||

pc|s4|nt|ybob: 13 cold tricks |pg||

pc|dT|pc|h4|nt|ybob: ruff @S @C to K trump|pg||

pc|h9|pc|s5|nt|andyv:  they always play the J here|pg||

nt|othered1: Another just about exactly 50 percent game.  NV staying out isn't hopeless, but nowadays pairs bid games.|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, very well done.  Wonder what all that bidding meant, however, especially 3@C|pg||
mb|1H|nt|othered1: If north weren't a passed hand, south might have tried a responsive double, pretty aggressively|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: south may have choices here, including a gambling 3N.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|othered1: looks like a professional 1N.|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: well an interesting 20/20 hand here|pg||
nt|andyv:  it has everything you want in a NT bid, Ed:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: normally, restrictaions in regular clubs should be made in accordance with the most recent Contract Bridge Laws|pg||
nt|othered1: if you play (really) weak jump shift responses, north might h ave qualified.|pg||
nt|rado: seems E believes in reopening|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: No  high level contracts making here for anyone|pg||
nt|othered1: Do you double with east's hand?  Or bid 1N?  or pass?|pg||
nt|ybob: i prefer 1NT over X|pg||
nt|ybob: X with 4333  dont like|pg||
nt|rado: if K@S was in other suits could dbl|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1N whats the problem a balace 11|pg||
nt|othered1: My choices would be pass, 1N and dbl in that order|pg||
nt|othered1: We rarely trap at these colors|pg||
nt|lestergold: pass is allowed at unfavourable but normal balance range is 11-14|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N can go for 500|pg||
mb|3H|nt|othered1: only 4?|pg||
nt|star6ija: it would be interesting how Ivanova will deal with 4@h here|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Momchil!|pg||
nt|othered1: Do you play pass of the redouble as penalty?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: yes he bid 4@D|pg||
nt|ybob: p p p ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2H fo N/S maybe 2/3 dims or E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: 2@H has a play|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: W alerted 2@D|pg||
nt|ybob: becuase E is passed hand i prefer 1NT , pass , never X|pg||
nt|rado: maybe transfer?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2D presumably an intended transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D looks like a misentry|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: yes but E didnt understand it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: or as u say a misentry|pg||
nt|lestergold: something is seriously remiss at any rate|pg||
nt|rado: but N is happy|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: mind you with the 5/0 heart break 2h may well be unmaneagable|pg||
nt|lestergold: if passed it will be a misery|pg||
nt|rado: and surely will find the lead|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sharkey: im thinking ACBL which different in many respect than European standards|pg||
nt|andyv:  lots of club games in the states make up their own rules... mostly to keep the paying customers happy|pg||
nt|star6ija: hello, Andy :)|pg||
nt|othered1: south to the rescue|pg||
nt|lestergold: South is still there wantinmg to say i really do have a mountain pard|pg||
nt|othered1: But there was no reason for south to know the wheels were coming off EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: giving west a chance to er em show his er second suit!!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  the bigger ones adhere to the ACBL standards|pg||
nt|othered1: Bidding 2@H is normal, despite suit disparities, planning to rebid @S, showing extras for sure|pg||
pc|sK|nt|star6ija: @d lead ould be helpful for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: if east wakes up he may not give preference by bidding 3D|pg||
nt|othered1: I think the redouble opposite a passed partner showed the strength adequately, but the double did imply the shape|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ybob: cant win 4@D or 4@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  ask and you will receive:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: north wants out of this auction badly|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H  -1 surely|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like one offski|pg||
nt|othered1: or 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely a spade lead then 3 losers in each major unavoidable|pg||
nt|othered1: this won't be trivial to play|pg||
pc|cK|nt|star6ija: this is fine policy|pg||
nt|sharkey: i have to leave now - ty all - enjoyed|pg||
nt|sharkey: bye|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Carl...see you soon|pg||
nt|othered1: In OR, east knew to stay out, after south opened 1@C (presumably big)|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer lucky with the minors no losers unless there is an 'accident' in dims|pg||
nt|lestergold: like ducking when north switches to a diamondafter ruffing the third spade needs presence of mind here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|othered1: I think north was timid, if south's 2@C openings aren't a joke.|pg||
nt|othered1: quite helpful -- splits here make this far from easy but that lead softens things up for declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  now can play it off the top|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: defence should probably make 3 spades a club and 2 heart tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|othered1: @Dshift now beats, n o?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h5|nt|star6ija: Leroumain's team is going to finish the match a little bit agressively|pg||
nt|andyv:  putting pressure on declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer has to be careful, but 10 tricks look easy, even with @C tap here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|star6ija: they made compensation to 3@ss contract which is cold on the actual laydown|pg||
nt|andyv:  should make 3@h tricks |pg||
nt|othered1: was south's play of @H10 as opposed to 9 meaningful? |pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: maybe 2 off with dim ruff reentry with club and another diamonjd effectively promoting anothet trump|pg||
nt|othered1: should north ruff here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: now ruff the winner|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ybob: -1 now|pg||
nt|lestergold: no imagination !!|pg||
nt|lestergold: absolutely but not many would see the no cost play of ruffing and playing a diamond|pg||
nt|andyv:  apparently not to N|pg||
pc|h7|nt|othered1: let me retract easy.  East on several lines|pg||
nt|lestergold: that would deserve a prize at this level|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, why didn't S play the A@h instead of the 10@h?|pg||
nt|andyv:  when W ruffs, that should get the message across pretty loudly|pg||
pc|c6|pc|hA|nt|andyv:  not much left for the defense to do|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|othered1: easy|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|othered1: That, too.  It's the 10 that looks ambiguous to me.|pg||

nt|andyv:  good result for EW in OR|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|star6ija: 5@ss here is a good sacrifice againt 5@hs|pg||

nt|andyv:  4@h by N?|pg||
nt|ybob: S cant have 14 cards so play first A @D if K not drop K@C was stiff|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|othered1: My partners might think I had something and overcompete|pg||

nt|andyv:  would you pull dbl with E hand?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|othered1: 3@D did stop slam and west might have had a normal looking @C lead, so I guess it was worth the risk|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  i think it's clear to pull|pg||
nt|star6ija: if 2@s is GF... pass is correct option|pg||
nt|andyv:  pd passed 1@D and you have maybe one defensive trick|pg||

pc|sK|nt|lestergold: wellnow he wants to grab one of those available ruffs|pg||
nt|othered1: sounds like just a "semiforcing" 1N, not a style I prefer.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|star6ija: to prevent new heart from W|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: sounds like dartboard bridge|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|star6ija: now is late 12 IMPs leroumain|pg||
nt|andyv:  yeap|pg||
nt|othered1: true, but he'll have no choice but @H hook if he had|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty Deyan for an outstanding job|pg||
nt|star6ija: and again possible swing|pg||
nt|star6ija: bravo, Dido :) nice job|pg||
nt|star6ija: and thanks to Andy and to all kibitzers for joining us|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the last deal of this round. Tx all for watching and special thanks to the commentators. We'll be back in 14CET.Thats in 2 hours 20 min.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and ty Momchil (and Carl too).|pg||
nt|andyv:  coming up to our final board of this set|pg||
nt|andyv:  and our final board of this match.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and a tricky 4S which can and indeed was defeated in theopen|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Mike, Deyan and all the specs who have joined us.|pg||
nt|lestergold: it can also be let thru|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Last board of the round. Tx Mike and Andy. We'll be back at 13CET with the last round of the round robin.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the last board of the event. Thank you all comentator and kibtzs.|pg||
nt|andyv:  many thanks to our operator, Deyan, for an excellent job.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: some of my club members play this form of bidding style it usually means why consult partner when i can guess a bid all by myself|pg||
nt|andyv:  Ed, it's been a pleasure as always.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: 3NT = cold from E|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: This looks like a wash, so Ankara's lead will stand up.|pg||
nt|othered1: North really likes to have his bids.|pg||
nt|andyv:  And thank you to all the specs who make these events so enjoyable for all of us.|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks, Andy, it's mutual.  And thanks, Deyan, for the fine presentation.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ybob: from W @D leads can defeat|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: 6@D is really excellent|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you Deyan for an excellent job.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: wrong again.|pg||
nt|lestergold: what on earth are they playing at?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: well then this is the decisive one|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 2@S should show a sound opener with six good spades in the balancing seat|pg||
nt|othered1: What did 2@S imply?  Looks intermediate to me, but north didin't see it that way.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it seems Beograd will make it to the final|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Just what South has, so North should bid again|pg||
nt|othered1: You wouldn't open AKQJxx, xx, xxx, xx?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i was thinking how close this was to a Roland slam|pg||
nt|ogoksel: 2@S shows 11-15 but N is not sure about that i guess|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@S in 4¬∫ shows 11/13 6¬∫ to me|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the bad break in @hs it looks as if NS did well to make 4@h in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: hope to see you in 2 hours for next round of this very interesting competition |pg||
nt|othered1: OR found grand slam also, so this match is constructively over.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: in any thx excellent operator and very much enjoyed our double act Andy look forward to working with u again sometime|pg||
nt|lestergold: I'm gong back to bed for a nice kip|pg||
nt|andyv:  same here Mike...it was fun and some pretty zany boards kept us awake:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|andyv:  their sequence a little easier to understand:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  as a spec pointed out, 4H may be optimum contract|pg||
nt|othered1: but there's no reason for EW to know best positioning|pg||
nt|ybob: hard to humans not win 1¬∫ trick with K @D|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@D (4th suit still forcing?)|pg||
nt|star6ija: very nice comeback to Rossenovo team, who was 18 IMPs behind in first 2 boards|pg||
nt|star6ija: this 1@d bid could be very expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the last board for today. Thank you all. Tomorrow we start at 9CET.|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing tis system with a chicken uinderbidder is kamikazi|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk5: 12-15 in my book|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzym: looks very easy to make|pg||
nt|star6ija: this will probably end plus one and 11 IMPs Cernato are just to come|pg||
nt|star6ija: and it was|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you Ed and Momchil and all the specs who make these events fun and entertaining.|pg||
nt|othered1: wow, that was ineffective|pg||
nt|lestergold: youth bridge usually has some fun for specs and commenttaors but thre has been somje good signs of talent here|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should make|pg||
pc|s2|nt|star6ija: now even to overtricks are possible|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 602 126 889|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder what would have happened on the grand slam if north at one table or the other had decided to preempt to the 3 level on the 7-bagger at those colors.  Could it have played ...|pg||
nt|othered1: their, doubled and down much less than the grand?|pg||
nt|othered1: played there|pg||
nt|andyv:  we won't know it feels to me that E would have simply bid 3N then|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: 5@C may survive for a nice pick-up, but can they get there?|pg||
nt|othered1: with only the @HQ possibly duplicated, east has so many tricks it feels timid not to make another move.  Of course, I don't know what west has shown exactly|pg||
nt|lestergold: isnt this leada bit damaging|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like NS may give a bunch back here, but it  won't be enough.  EW here did have their chances with sounder play.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: Need good partnership to handle shortness cue-bids in partner's known long suits.|pg||
nt|ybob: disagree with 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: that's another way to put it :)|pg||
nt|othered1: No, NS stopped quickly enough to survive this, I think.|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure why S didn't simply xfer and then bid @ds to show the 2 suits|pg||
nt|andyv:  with this lead, yes|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe they don't play transfers?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: That should end it firmly.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|andyv:  could be but I thought they did earlier... maybe an illusion|pg||
nt|andyv:  they do... look at board 1:)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|star6ija: two|pg||
nt|andyv:  guess @hs right and as one spec points out, without @s lead, can make 6|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least the play won't take long|pg||
nt|lestergold: only 8 tricks on top here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: hi Roland been taking ur name in vain again|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|othered1: West doesn't see it my way, but without detailed system and style notes, it's hard to be sure where the rot set in|pg||
nt|ybob: i prefer bid 3@S over 3@C ...|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree with 3@S.  You bid 4th suit to set up forcing bid in @S, so why not bid hand out?|pg||
nt|ybob: where are extra cards from W ?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C bid, in casual partnerships, might have been seen as having strong preference and good support for @C that justified 4th suit auction.|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally think west had to respect the 5@C sign-off (if that'swhat it was.)  But he may be taking a shot against an expected @CAxxx in the east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the last board. Tx for all specs and kibtzs. We'll be back in 10 min for the last round of today|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may actually pick up an imp here|pg||
nt|andyv:  very little EW can do to stop them |pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: West may think they aren't in a good position in this match.|pg||
nt|ybob: AXXX needs trump 2/2 in unbal hand sure, lost A @D ...|pg||
pc|d9|nt|othered1: Unusual for me to have less for my bid than most, but I think 10-13 (or bad slightly better) works well.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c4|nt|star6ija: once again :) big thanks everybody for joining us - see you in 2 PM CET (2 hours since now)|pg||
nt|othered1: Onthe other hand, a round robin is very much like a single match of great length, so shooting to win this match may not be best overall strategy|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably 5-7 hand with @d support and stiff @h|pg||
nt|ybob: i open 1@S and rebid 2@S with 14/15|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  W might have been worried about a 4-1 @h break|pg||
nt|andyv:  or was trying to get his name in the papers by smothering the 10x of @hs;)|pg||
nt|star6ija: 13th trick will save 1 IMP eventually|pg||
nt|star6ija: yup|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  looks like a push board |pg||
nt|lestergold: no play that i can see Andy|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|star6ija: yes and this was the proper way to avoid the danger if 4 were with S|pg||
mc|10|nt|andyv:  good night all from Los Angeles|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: thanks all see you in 2 hours 10 min . |pg||
nt|vugraphzym: good night andy :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: iF n DUCKED WITH 4TH kING... jACK IS THE LOSING OPTIN|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is the last board from Round Robin :) stay with us for upcomming semifinals and final|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This was the last deal of the round robin. We start 1/2 finals at 15CET|pg||
nt|mamos: the rout is complete :(   sorry for NS this has been a disatrous set|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: are You hungry?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: We'll be back at 15CET with the 1/2 finalist|pg||
nt|lestergold: see had dims broken 3/3 it would be just the dozen tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: see you after about 5 min.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: congtarulations for team "Svetla", they will play final|pg||
pg||
