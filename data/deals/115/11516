nt|vugraphzyu: Hi Mike|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: choices for East - 2@h on six to the eight or 2@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: or, indeed, 2@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi David|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I am glad to see the spade raise on three trumps. Very sensible.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mdgraham: West is interested now |pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D implies that the raise is on only three trumps.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: good auction |pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it was possible to get too high with those values.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: well with @Cs 4-4 you can make 12 now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Five trumps and two A-K combinations, so one ruff is needed to bring the total to ten.|pg||

nt|haans: Hi Shirley|pg||
pc|c6|nt|stc: 8 top tricks and the 9th because of everything on side for dec|pg||
nt|sybarra: quite a @H suit |pg||
nt|haans: Hi Shirley twos|pg||
nt|stc: sorry 9 top tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: A bit safer then 4@S but @H are always 10|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H hard to reach :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont know the break out here but part of the game is matchpoints and part of the game is imps|pg||
nt|jstokes: sounds difficult :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are playing 2 games at the same time  on each hand |pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: Well Hans. 3@C for W and 3@H at E?|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h may go dwon with @h 4-1, 3NT is best|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jstokes: at whatever scoring, this will not be a success for EW|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rodal f: At team 3NT is best. Patton?|pg||
nt|sybarra: only name of tourney  this is regular imp scoring |pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: not Patton here semi|pg||
nt|stc: playing with the fire|pg||
nt|stc: what if they cash 3@h now ?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|haans: they dare not :)|pg||
nt|stc: unfair ?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|haans: yep|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sfoxa: each deal counts - if the difference is null - it means 1:1 in the deal, if we have 420 in 4@s and they - 430 in 3NT - we lose the deal 0:2|pg||

nt|xenya: true|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzyu: 1@C can be 2 cards in @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|brolucius: If Roland was watching and South bid 1@D, we would hear about it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzyu: 2@H : invitational with 6 cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: but he is not and S didn't|pg||
mb|2S|mb|4H|nt|brolucius: Not so bad to overcall 1@S on such a suit, because you take away bidding space from E/W. Pointless when you have diamonds.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that will tempt South|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: and 4@S has tempted East - which he may regret|pg||
nt|brolucius: West was apparently light for an 'invitational' 2@H.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed, this looks like it is on the trump gues |pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: one way of playing spades is the strightd |pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer may cash @SA first, to pick up single @S10 with West. But he must be worried about a hold-up in diamonds cutting him off from the long cards.|pg||
nt|brolucius: @SK first, I meant.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: - striaghtforward one - ace and king. Alternatively, if North thinks they are 3-1, he can try running the jack (hoping to pin West's singleton ten)    |pg||
nt|brolucius: He will probably go for a club ruff, to solve the problem in that suit.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but I think he will play for 2-2 spades|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: Defenders can switch to diamonds at Trick 2, East holding off the ace, and then declarer cannot play on clubs because he would suffer a diamond ruff.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: and he will be worried about a diamond hold-up, as David says|pg||

nt|sfoxa: thereafter saldo counts|pg||
nt|jstokes: is there an IMPs component?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think after the BAM score, the imps count  |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|stc: GIB 2 swings behind, a lot with 7 to go|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: what is saldo Svelta?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|sybarra: *Sveta|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sfoxa: overall sum - from 3:3 (with difference no more than 90) till 6:0 (if over 590)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: you see, just a simple scoring issue |pg||
nt|sfoxa: we see plain IMP score and can assume the outcome|pg||
nt|rodal f: Exspressing atletics or speedskating now Constantin?:)|pg||
nt|stc: 4@s in NS with no points !!|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa: sorry, my omission 10  points difference (i.e. 420 to 430) doesn't count, will be 1:1 in a deal |pg||
nt|haans: you have the higherst suit so you get the minus|pg||
nt|sybarra: points/schmoints as they say |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|stc: which minus ?|pg||
nt|haans: yes fare quistion|pg||
nt|stc: sry, the trump promotion|pg||
nt|stc: so a phantom save, 4@h is -2 becuase of the 9@c|pg||
nt|stc: but same contract next door, a push and a missed oprtunity for GIB to come back in the match|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: Maybe 2NT over 2@H.  In any case all roads lead to 3NT.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sfoxa: but 400 in 3NT vs 420 in 4@s means 0:2 |pg||

nt|haans: nothing|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: always handy to have a little bit more in trumps than Qx for a penalty double at the four-level |pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|brolucius: In the third seat North might have opened 1@H, 2@H or 3@H.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|brolucius: A resonsive double from West now will suggest the minors, since he could bid spades with four in the 'other major'.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW make 3NT - at first sight 4@H looks like a good save|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mdgraham: however, they can't make 3NT now|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, indeed.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@C, rather than 3@C, is a bit surprising.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: best to defend here|pg||

mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: South's card is suit preference (high for spades), since no further tricks could be taken in the suit that was led.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: the 4@Sx was flat.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|xenya: perhpas W's 4@C was aimed at finding a save in either minor (5-4)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Bocchi has almost the same hand as North on the previous deal, again in 3rd seat.|pg||
nt|xenya: He didn't know N had opened so light|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very disciplined pass by South over East's 1@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has what I would have thought was a totally obvious overcall in diamonds.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I was wondering why he hadn't overcalled|pg||
nt|brolucius: Cards lie so well that 5@D can be made.|pg||

mb|1C!|an|strong|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2H!|nt|vugraphzyu: 2@H = a good 2@S bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on second thoughts, if South does bid 2@D, North would probably just bid 5@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|brolucius: 2@H would not have much value as a natural bid, since South's double would normally indicate hearts. (Not here perhaps, if 1@C is strong).|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I wonder why Norht didn't double 2@H?|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's sequence is fairly weak, since he did not bid a forcing 2@H on the previous round. Still, he is particularly weak for 3@H, via any route.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe that would have shown a different hand|pg||

nt|rodal f: And if 4@H EW have a nice sac in @S|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: need to negotiate getting back to hand (assuming S playing)   for anohter @D hook |pg||

nt|marlowepi: good enough to bid but not to lead apparently|pg||
nt|stc: not to find|pg||
nt|rodal f: I am not shure, but belive NS use 15-17NTs so Sementa count his 18 by the 10s and red suit combinations|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|haans: 6@H in other room|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jcwla: With no N/S bidding!|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 5C would probably fail on spade lead|pg||

nt|rodal f: 3@C could be puppet but what's 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: still iffy imo |pg||

nt|mdgraham: double would not be everybody's choice  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: not mine for sure|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 29: Kx in LHO's suit can bea good holding for suit play, if partner has Axx or Qxx or Q10x or Axxx and in many other ways, so perhaps it's not so amazing. |pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|brolucius: Disciplined pass by South, where many would have rebid 3@C, hoping for an improvement in the contract somewhere.|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: of course, North may ahve @SKQJ10xx and 2@S is the last makable spot.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some kibitzers don't like the 2@S bid, but it seems OK to me. Just a bit unlucky.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|sJ|nt|xenya: down 1 or 2 might not be so bad for NS on this freak|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: would you super accept with  E?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|jcwla: It's an ongoing debate which format is the "truest" or "best."  Most believe that the truest test of bridge skill is a long IMP match.  Then others such as Larry Cohen point to ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: hands like that one that have an element of chance and are so overweighted, plus the fact that you can take certain hands "off" at IMPs, and argue that matchpoints is best...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that 1S overcall is not a typical French action, at least not for the older guard|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt hee? |pg||

pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|sfoxa: but how often is your partner strong opposite your 21-22 count? |pg||
nt|jstokes: but if partner is strong, s/he is surely worried about the heart suit -- nice to hear that superaccept|pg||

nt|vugraphzyu: 1@C = 6@d 4@C 2@S and 1@H  18-19|pg||

nt|brolucius: No reason for Borisov to double the final contract. His 5@D, which was bold, has done its job, pushing the opponents to 5@H. |pg||

pc|c2|pc|hK|pc|d4|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: Madala might re-open with a Dbl, which Bocchi will pass|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C is often played as Stayman, over a 1NT overcall.|pg||
