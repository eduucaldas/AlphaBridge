nt|xenya: hello Snorri|pg||
nt|snorris:  Hi Vladimir|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: our operator is Francois Colin, bonjour Francois:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@C is an artificial game force|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3S|nt|lestergold: hi Raif|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H is even more artificialer|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Bill|pg||
nt|pkl: I have no idea what the D means, so don't ask about the bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If S bids 5@c I prefer 5@d from W|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Hi Sabine.  I guess I'll let you make the 2@c/1@d suggestions.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: @H cheriehi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Sabine|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Marshall|pg||
nt|haans: and he got it|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|h bertens: nice 800 to start with|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3@D a make|pg||
mb|p|nt|jstokes: good dummy for Versace -- right ace, spade J|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://tinyurl.com/539d3g|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and an easy 3 @C here,  S hand nearly perfecto |pg||
nt|xenya: this should make|pg||
nt|snorris:  a lucky 3nt..|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|snorris:  but quit good after easts double|pg||
pc|h3|nt|h bertens: 500|pg||
nt|xenya: This is a semifinal, Round 3 of 4|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: still, there is the danger of getitng forced |pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW probably do best to cash @SAK and switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|jstokes: yes, and crossing to dummy to lead a club increases that danger -- but increases the possibility of making|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H actually shows diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|xenya: well it's certainly a reasonable contract |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even 3S ttypically puts enough pressure on opps in auctions like this wherethey have not made one natural bid|pg||
nt|roghog: glad you can interpret for us, Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W play, in my opinion, one of the world's most interesting systems|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: this save a bit gungho|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jcmax: I am wondering why Madala did not choose a preempt at 1st opportunity|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roghog: agreed. nothing else anywhere near it|pg||
nt|haans: Fantunes system text by Daniel Neill 29 pages): http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No artificial forcing opening ... just a lot of natural ones, 1@C, 1@D, 1@H and 1@S|pg||
nt|xenya: exactly|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bessi2: now he'll just discard club and except a small minus|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hi Peter, Ralf and specs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: lucky lead and it still makes a loss|pg||
nt|h bertens: back to 800|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@h has some play e-w but doesn't seem likely to be bid.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Mathias Bruun|pg||
nt|mbruun: Hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: The 24-imp lead is serious but can be overcome over the remaining 24 boards|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Federico Lizzio|pg||
nt|feffo: hi all, hi Roland and tks|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W:s hand is VERY strong in this situation, so 5@d is obvious for me and my P will bid 6@h|pg||
nt|pkl: Seems like a draw. West will play the spade ace soon to keep South out, then claim 13 tricks|pg||
nt|pkl: Yes - Wests hand is almost to good.|pg||
nt|feffo: the situation for Denmark is very bad, so now try to play very aggresive|pg||
nt|feffo: N thinking bid  7 @H|pg||
nt|feffo: or 7NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3NT is no success. In the other room Fantroni found the master bid of 5@C|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h bertens: to 500|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: hello Mathias|pg||
nt|mbruun: After serious calculations Ill take it for 1 IMP every hand|pg||

pc|c2|nt|haans: and very hard to learn|pg||

nt|bjacobs: As one who is in fact playing with it (or trying to), I can tell you that it's a lot of fun|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|snorris:  so some much needed imps to Denmark|pg||
nt|xenya: so 8 imps to Denmark|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|feffo: done by Versace|pg||
pc|c8|nt|april7: to late now|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: 10 more IMPs down the drain, but you have to credit to Fantoni's excellent judgement|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|roghog: I can well imagine|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
mc|9|nt|mbruun: I hate to admit it was 10 well deserved IMPs for Italy for bidding the best contract|pg||

nt|marlowepi: outbid them in any other suit. 1S allows NS to find a red suit too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Peter Koch Larsen|pg||
nt|pkl: Hello all|pg||
nt|feffo: hi Peter, wlc|pg||
nt|xenya: but well played by W for only one undertrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no - 5@c looks wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=804&qshowflag=1  running scores Group A|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H = 10-13 with hearts, and maybe a minor|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: ah, here we go|pg||
nt|santyclz: Harmon Edgar points out 5@cs is there for those who bid @cs as a suit.|pg||
nt|snorris:  another "lucky" 5 @ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: in any event -500 is way better than -800|pg||
nt|roghog: another fascinating idea|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@S is an enquiry, not showing spades|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H with a deep finesse in @H|pg||
nt|mbruun: 3 NT by NS, maybe hard to reach|pg||
nt|xenya: tough for N|pg||
nt|mbruun: To get the excitement back in the match, he´ll better pass|pg||
nt|snorris:  actually quit good contract too|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|haans: long way to 9th trick|pg||
nt|xenya: i tend to agree with the pass|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it's a swingy hand -- just what Denamrk needs |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4H was there too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|hedyg: this cannot be right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless Versace is in 5@Hx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double probably prepares for showing a value raise to 3H|pg||
nt|jcmax: Bocchi doubles 2@S here because his hand is not all about hearts. he has some constructive values and all of them outside hearts. Bidding 3@H would show a different kind of hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sabine said it better:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: no, I just used more words :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: people seldom outbid me in THAT respect:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: male and female?|pg||
nt|xenya: well swing goes the other way...|pg||
nt|snorris:   lets prey for a @h lead...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: what on earth is going on here? |pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2NT denied a minor, hence 6+ hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: @S lead will give declarer the temp |pg||
nt|sybarra: *tempo|pg||
nt|pkl: 3@S is preemptive with four cards. On the actual hand, I could be tempted to stay low with 2@S|pg||
nt|april7: still 100 for NS|pg||
nt|snorris:  not enough..|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: 2@s weak 1suiter . 5+ cards|pg||
nt|feffo: mmmmmmmmhhhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|xenya: and no switch afterwards...|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bessi2: that makes no sense either|pg||
nt|jstokes: better but still seems unlikely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon West bid 4@S and South 5@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then double by West|pg||
nt|bessi2: yep,  that seems plausible|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do i get to choose?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Once again, e-w's 9 card club fit was undisclosed.|pg||
nt|jcmax: It seems like declarer has to lose 11S, 2@H and 2@D tricks. Making this contract would be tough|pg||
nt|santyclz: Who cares about @cs.|pg||
nt|santyclz: See you later folks, I've been re-assigned.|pg||
nt|jcmax: see you|pg||
nt|marlowepi: see you Joe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: send a  postcard|pg||
nt|jcmax: Maala is trying to figure out a lie of the cards consistent with the bidding that would let him make his contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: To show spades, West would have to bid 2NT.  The system can at times make your head spin|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And the system is not clever enough to know that South has all the hearts, unfortunately|pg||
nt|roghog: Leader is thrown in, so only 1 down|pg||
nt|pkl: Difficult to find the club lead after D - now 11 easy tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it should be -1 again|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records(PDF)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|feffo: now yes|pg||
nt|snorris:  right :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: It looks like this down one without any endplay|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 trump tricks, a club and a heart (2nd heart loser goes on a diamond) -- plus the two tricks already lost|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: he shouldnt have bid so much without the 8 of diamonds (though even then diamond lead & spade back beats it|pg||
nt|pkl: Any comments from anyone are much appreciated |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dima:  Morning all|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure N has enough tempo to find 9th trick |pg||
pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: Easy -1 after a @h lead, but now....|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2 colors to handle here. Belive the @C will be played from N because of the enteryes|pg||
nt|Walddk5: there is no   n   in Wikner   operator|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Dima Nikolenkov and Bertil G Johnson|pg||

nt|pkl: As Ralf pointed out, an initial heart lead would give E-W a trump promotion.  North now gets nine tricks no sweat after the spade guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a small @c is very clear|pg||
nt|april7: now 3 down |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s2|nt|jcmax: but E could just overtake and cash the @HJ unless he was asleep|pg||
nt|h bertens: not anymore|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: yes was expecting that--in any case i dont see how retaining club ace in hand can help, unless he is worried about 4-1 trumps|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|thorvald: It was 8 imp to DK on the first board, but they will loose more on board 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it's fair to say that the Danish pairs have been outbid throughout this match|pg||

nt|pkl: Would anyone have bid clubs instead of doubling.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: still, it allows our imagination free rein :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Francois is a new operator :)|pg||
nt|h bertens: after d for tke king he could cash ace of c and play q of spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now we check their non-slam bidding|pg||
nt|rodal f: A better bid Ralf|pg||
nt|pkl: I would - after seeing all four hands|pg||
nt|feffo: strange for Fantoni|pg||
nt|snorris:  same theme|pg||
nt|snorris:  5 minor beats 3nt|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|h bertens: then he wins|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This will likely be the last appearance on BBO vugraph for Vilhjalmsson and Sigurjonsson. After Dec 31 our new rule will be enforced. People with surnames longer than 10 characters ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: will not be allowed to ...|pg||
nt|milton_se: quite an aggressive double|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jstokes: and it's not that easy :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so the 2@S opening shows a profit there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed it isn't|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he will learn quickly :) courage Francois!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not absloutley certain, but I think 2@D=both majors|pg||
nt|roghog: not too tough a test here|pg||
nt|haans: that 2 is weeeeeeeeak|pg||
nt|sybarra: is this (mini) multi?|pg||
nt|haans: can we call it anything?|pg||
nt|xenya: chance for the Danes|pg||
mb|p|nt|h bertens: should have taken ace of d|pg||
nt|jcmax: Sementa apparently did very well on board 1 in the other bringing hme 3NT with an overtrick after a @S lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: garbage multi  I am told |pg||
nt|Walddk4: play|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@d first and perhaps a D later to show @c|pg||
nt|dima:  Looks like German pair plays weak NT and 4-card majors ...|pg||
mb|3S|nt|snorris:  thay should be warned..|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Same applies for Schollaardt of course|pg||
nt|pkl: Brøndum bid 2@C in the open room.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rodal f: Tell his story|pg||
nt|rodal f: E a bit more careful here contra the OR|pg||
nt|pkl: A most sensible rule - and I've heard they will also disallow any players with a 4-letter word last name.|pg||
nt|dima:  So we get some action here|pg||
nt|milton_se: will East be able too keep his spade entrance?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: it will take a heart lead to beat this it seems|pg||
nt|jstokes: hardly seems fair -- not only are Lauria-Versace two of the world's greatest players, they have a bid for everything |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They will cue 1st and 2nd round controls, so Nunes knows immediately that he is off 2 club losers|pg||
nt|dima:  I dont think so - if South gets a count signal on a herat play he will know hearts are likely to be 4=2=2=5 around the table|pg||
nt|feffo: in OR 5 @D by Versace, lead @C and down|pg||
nt|april7: W must take a @S ruff in hand, so a @H lead might have been best for the defence|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@D was a transfer to @Hs, W obviously raised to game|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mdgraham: will make on a diamond lead |pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|haans: spec think suicidal is best|pg||
nt|sybarra: in 3rd seat with this vulnerability |pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: if not, the 10C will be valuable|pg||
mb|p|nt|roghog: welcome|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Most top players cue-bid this way.  Cue 1st and 2nd round controls, and use Blackwood to check back whether you are off two aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: well done|pg||
nt|snorris:  10 imps back|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: I have some other suggestions which will remain private to me, thanks specs, ! |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like that save action  from W. Trust your partner!|pg||
nt|pkl: A most sensible 2@D and still a blood bath for EW. Sometimes stuff just happens |pg||
nt|rodal f: He will agree with u after the board:) Or might already now.|pg||
nt|dima:  upside down count I suppose by NS|pg||

pc|dK|nt|jcmax: Very tough for Bocchi here to stay out of game after partner freely bid 1@S. The question is: Did 31H confirm 4 cards in @S?|pg||

nt|haans: yes Hi Paul|pg||

nt|pkl: I also play a weak 1NT but feel slightly uncomfortable in third hand vulnerable|pg||
nt|mbruun: Pretty staightforward. No swing|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: oh dear, G****r - don't tell Roland|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my, what is happening here?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H by West, of course...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Francois?|pg||
nt|hedyg: vraiment 4@H par S?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No problems with the aces and kings.  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Not often you see the same contract made by NS and EW on the same hand at this level|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: merci|pg||
nt|bessi2: i wonder what the range of 1N is,  seems strange not to try for slam with east hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: so it was a South African Texas after all, 4@C=@H|pg||
nt|jstokes: I suspect 4@C was Gerber (asking aces) and he found two missing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then it was a good idea to stop. |pg||
nt|bessi2: ahhh.. yes.. i think you're right|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT might well be 13-15|pg||
nt|feffo: me too Peter|pg||
nt|snorris:  well.. 2 times @hs is tough..|pg||
mb|p|nt|pkl: Personally I often find that to be one to many|pg||
nt|rodal f: No trancfeer|pg||
nt|pkl: That is not the position where I upgrade 11 points ;-)|pg||
nt|april7: is this forcing?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: Lindqvist to blame|pg||
nt|paulg:  is Rekstad older than Lindqvist?|pg||
nt|sybarra: may need some help from defense here|pg||
nt|sybarra: or a spec rightly suggest help from supernatural powers |pg||
nt|feffo: :)|pg||
nt|feffo: 5 @C by Lauria in OR|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: I'm guessing, but it's common nowadays with big clubs, that 1@H shows 19+, artificial|pg||
nt|roghog: 2@c some sort of semi-positive after that|pg||
nt|roghog: 1@s is probably the double-negative|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think the defence may already have helped by not doubling|pg||
nt|dima:  At the level of 1NT it does happen :) but you meant another level :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
nt|xenya: i like N's 3N -- considering the state of the match|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: yes, "serious" 3N|pg||
nt|mbruun: Most Danes play it as slammy with no shortage|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A spec who seems like he knows what he's talking about says: 1@H could also be hearts, 2@C showed 5-7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another flat board|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcarroll: a couple of overtrick imps to EW|pg||
nt|milton_se: just then?|pg||
nt|milton_se: ten|pg||
nt|dima:  If NS go passive it will be a push|pg||
nt|pkl: 3@S is an easy winner; against 5@C you must take the three first tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: So then 3@C some sort of Stayman|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So in summary ... no one is playing SAYC at this table!!|pg||
nt|roghog: Perhaps we can convert yhem :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: good luck with that ...|pg||
nt|roghog: @c gives the 9th trick, so it's just about overtricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: think you are right Paul |pg||
nt|mbruun: 4 any after 3 Sp is shortage. Not 4 Sp though |pg||

nt|roghog: perhaps we can convert them after all....|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks to all who have told me that Rekstad is over ten years older ... which may explain why he expected more for 1@s|pg||
nt|pkl: It now comes down to the play in clubs. It is one or two losers - if West ducks the jack, East might get a trick on the @C9|pg||
nt|pkl: We will see - it certainly will be a swing. |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bjacobs: true!|pg||
nt|dima:  looks like 10 tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sunsamvar: will Nunes find the @S lead ?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|dima:  weak NT making an appearence|pg||
nt|milton_se: will South go for a minor-suit slam?|pg||
nt|sssvablue: EW can save in the minors if they get involved, and will be pleased to find they make 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1NT for EW is 14-16|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 10-13, spades, could have a minor ...|pg||
nt|dima:  That is the kind of hand where people bid 3@h to show GF with @h shortness without 4@s|pg||
nt|pkl: They might find that their save was an underbid|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcmax: I wonder how high Madala is planning to bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  Slam on a 2-2 trump break?|pg||
nt|haans: how many would have bid only 2@S?|pg||
nt|pkl: South has a perfect hand for 4@H. How could North ever know?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Surely S is not thinking of anything except Game over a weak NT?|pg||
nt|dima:  2NT is surely some Multiway something- does anyone know the meaning?|pg||
nt|pkl: 3@S asks for singleton. But why?|pg||
nt|feffo: after 3 @S i don't think Stan|pg||
mb|p|nt|roghog: This is the Fantunes opening that really doesn't look sound|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It's not sound, I suppose, but it puts considerable pressure on the opponents|pg||
nt|roghog: Must gain more than it costs, I guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play constructive raises  so 2 @S for me|pg||
nt|dima:  Rather brave 3@h by Wrang|pg||
nt|milton_se: well, not more than a good D fit and an outside ace will do|pg||
nt|dima:  Now take your money|pg||
nt|xenya: as expected, 12 more imps to Angelini on 3 -- so the real score now is 109-48|pg||
mb|p|nt|h bertens: now we know|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Presumably they have found the minors, now they may get pushed to 6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ralfwil: What do you think about 3@c from W instead of 2@s, showing a @c-suit and a 3-card @s support?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd show a limit raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|paulg:  8 losers|pg||
nt|pkl: Will East bid on? I certainly would bid!|pg||
nt|feffo: in OR 5@H by Lauria|pg||
nt|sssvablue: And NS have a good Red/White save in 6@H :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well spotted Stan, red/white, the Danish colours|pg||
nt|pkl: An excellent result for Italy in the open room|pg||
nt|feffo: very interested situation now|pg||
nt|snorris:  this should be 8 tricks nomore no less|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: which states that, in a slam auction, find out how many aces are missing. Subtract that number from eight, and do not bid at the level given by the answer. Also known as the Rule ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: of Eight |pg||
nt|hedyg: great dummy|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: You can see how West might well be guessing over these openings ... the two level openings definitely roll the dice|pg||
nt|dima:  Specs suggest both minors with the follow-up showing shortness (now available per inference)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|haans: STRIK3R: so 2@h would have shown 12+ and @h or 3-7 and @s, think they play it like, that not sure|pg||
nt|paulg:  Easy to say looking at the hand, but 4@h is an imprecise slam try|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I vote for @dQ as a lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would have been the best here buy I belive Q@C is a normal one:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: but|pg||

nt|pkl: ... just not anymore - but who can blame East?|pg||
nt|pkl: Ouch - I´m babbling right now|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pkl: So thirteeen tricks - anyone now what that is in imps?|pg||
nt|sssvablue: If my math is right the overtrick doesn't cost an IMP|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: i think E remembers that his pd passed 1@s and is lying low|pg||
nt|mbruun: Should be down one, if North manages to duck Sp Q |pg||
nt|xenya: a @S switch might have created some problems |pg||
pc|c9|nt|bjacobs: Well, it's not THAT different from a weak two, as a lot of people play them.  Just a different point range|pg||
nt|sssvablue: 15 IMPs|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mbruun: With CKxxx, never a chance|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: West might have responded 1NT (if that would be natural)|pg||
nt|bessi2: but they play strong club so pass can have some hcp easily|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: I thought he might upgrade that hand to a 1@S opening ... but no|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: If @S8 was at N.... Then enteryes enough for use the @D there|pg||
nt|dima:  that @h 7 is worth a lot of IMPs|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|bjacobs: With this defence, Fantoni is happy to be undoubled.  Going 3 or 4 off it seems|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i Guess when you are playing a very strong team, you have to predecide that you are going to risk some doubles.. as here|pg||
nt|roghog: The French always doubled English weak 1NTs with hands like North's|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North must have been tempted.  |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|feffo: is nor easy|pg||
nt|feffo: t|pg||

nt|pkl: I received several interesting links. One is http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||
nt|sssvablue: The Danes continue to have a very good set, with one glaring exception|pg||
nt|pkl: ... which describes bidding by EW|pg||
nt|feffo: now is better Peter :)|pg||
nt|snorris:  the @c ruff was a bit strange|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcmax: That will feel like a very good result for Italy|pg||
nt|sybarra: another slam |pg||
nt|mbruun: Pedestrian 4 H|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: ok so strong @c it is|pg||
nt|paulg:  are we back at the goulash event?|pg||
nt|haans: very easy to bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: no wasted values in the @C suit |pg||
nt|pkl: Westra in the open room was a bit more cautious as West - perhaps Sigurjonsson was helped by his system?|pg||
nt|pkl: 2@S Michaels - 5 hearts and a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|pkl: ... sorry - it is spades and clubs|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|roghog: Lauria Versace overboard next door. Can the Swedes do better?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You can all guess what 3@C means ...|pg||
nt|roghog: anything but @C|pg||
nt|dima:  So now EW kann sniff around for a slam|pg||
nt|pkl: EW 3NT? |pg||
nt|feffo: i supposed|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Was 2@s weak or muiderberg?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hedyg: they might be playing ice-relay precision|pg||
nt|jcmax: There seem to be a lot of competitive doubles in this match. |pg||
nt|h bertens: does not easy to bid 4@H after this start|pg||
nt|h bertens: does not soud like english.......|pg||
nt|h bertens: sound|pg||
nt|lestergold: west could have shown extras by a redouble and east may have upgraded holding Ks over the overcall|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, that would be, so, SAYC'ish|pg||
nt|sybarra: not short suit bid |pg||
nt|paulg:  probably showing some non-minimum|pg||
nt|sybarra: which might have helped both pard and defenders here|pg||
nt|haans: think 3@C min and then steps|pg||
nt|pkl: Can Wortel resist that one? I would not|pg||
nt|dima:  Is 1NT 14-16?|pg||
nt|feffo: is a weak in Denmark system, correct Peter?|pg||
nt|pkl: So... how easy is it to set? 3@C indicates hearts, I guess. A tad more difficult now?|pg||
nt|pkl: 2@S is weak - can be five cards|pg||
nt|xenya: well perhaps it wasn't easy to work out the layout |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I now like 3@d from E|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: actually it is only the @C suit quality that is the problem in a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: now cue bids|pg||
nt|mbruun: Need swingy boards to catch up with these strong Italians. Running out of time|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: West's hand is looking very good here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jcmax: If West could have scraped up a 3@D bid East surely would bid game, but not so easy to visualise game with the W hand|pg||
nt|h bertens: wel done|pg||
nt|roghog: A penalty double. Heard our recommendation!|pg||
nt|sybarra: or shape?|pg||
nt|milton_se: apparently|pg||
nt|snorris:  no after the king of @c lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: i am told just strong @c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they might have found a few more bids in that case|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: imps for the Swedes here|pg||
nt|rodal f: N have a auto 4@S now but will W lead @HK?|pg||
nt|pkl: West must play low when South leads a club.|pg||
nt|dima:  Controled stop|pg||
nt|dima:  Without @d lead Wrang will be happy to see @s finesse fail|pg||
nt|milton_se: 6 is only on a finesse, though|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: Francois tells me they play precision|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No swing - they play 3NT in Open|pg||
nt|feffo: very interested board|pg||
nt|pkl: 2@S is exactly five spades and 7-11|pg||
nt|pkl: South needed to lead a heart - or the @DA and switch to hearts. |pg||
nt|sssvablue: Thanks very much to the knowledgeable kibbitzers who have been a great help so far|pg||
nt|sssvablue: It would appear that the line is difficult, but almost all lines will lead to success |pg||
nt|sssvablue: with both red aces onside and the 10@c dropping doubleton|pg||
nt|feffo: ya, but all us knows Fulvio, this board will be finish in 1 hour more or less :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, E was not far off a 2S bid last time. but i am not sure if 3D is a better call than D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sunsamvar: if the defence does not touch @H they could get it many down|pg||
nt|haans: and B|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: 3 sp asked for singleton I am told |pg||
pc|d6|nt|mbruun: Wests bidding just shows 18-19 NT. Upgrading the clubsuit|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very likely W needs something different for a RDBL in their methods|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: well this is not a board to get swingy on|pg||
nt|mbruun: If EW reaches a slam 6Ht will be played by West, where the diamondlead is obvious|pg||
nt|xenya: pretty obvious from S too|pg||
nt|april7: why not, should they reach 6, then .......|pg||
nt|mbruun: Yes|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|sunsamvar: lol|pg||
nt|dima:  Well without @d lead it is better then finesse, I think @s AK + @s to the J ...|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pkl: ... it doesn't really matter. Always ten tricks, I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: well done|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bjacobs: Well it was a good comment - maybe North might have played 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|ritong: or @h A and a @h|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, Henri, he develops a heart ruff that way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, the @HA and another is the way to get 800, as the hearts can be played succesfully with dummy's two entries|pg||
nt|ritong: the difference between 500 and 800 is not huge, imp speaking, with the result other room 2 imps or so|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: True Bill as a hundred specs tell me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yeah, specs can be like that :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but Henri it could mean a 10 imp swing if the Italians were only in game in the other room|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: sry 8 imps|pg||
nt|paulg:  At the club West would have bid, but the Italians like a stronger hand for their 2-suiter overcalls when vulnerable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Here is a classical duck from W when s plays @c towards dummy. otherwise S has 2 discards|pg||
nt|rodal f: If so there are 1 @H and 2@D loosers. Even 10 by a @HK lead. 3 @Ds run |pg||
nt|pkl: Duck and EW has three diamond and one heart trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: one trick to win and 2 to loose. But this time it does not matter|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. The @D8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Sry Did´nt see the @d8 so a duck was essential|pg||
nt|pkl: I first overlooked the @D8, I do not believe that 4@S wins if W ducks the club|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bjacobs: I don't think the italians did anything wrong here ... at this level, you have to disrupt big club auctions|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not 10|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roghog: Well, if partner is sticking his neck out with 2@s, you risk chopping it off with 3@s, I suppose|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The 3@S bid takes away N/S's 3@D and 3@H bids.  If Nunes didn't have @C10, he would have earned a big swing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sometimes, you just don't know|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: True Bill. Nunes was betting the opps had slam|pg||
nt|roghog: always, in my case|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|gioffi: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: I missed it 2 Ralf:)      :(|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a mysterious game.  Watching it on VuGraph demystifies it a little, but you also discover that no-one can play the perfect game|pg||
nt|mbruun: Invert Wests minorholding, and slam is very good |pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: Fortunately|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @S q shd have been ducked i think|pg||
nt|roghog: Still has an entry to play @h from dummy|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: no risks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Tough play here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good play|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but the points are counted out now|pg||
nt|roghog: Well, he's seen KKQ from South|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He might just get it right.  If North had started with A109x, he could play 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and he shd place @Ha with north|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a matter of who has @H9, he knows about @HA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So technically, finessing here is playing for North to make a mistake|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pkl: We all missed it, it seems|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|dima:  wins vs. singleton, Qx or Q onside any length|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mbruun: Toss a coin|pg||
nt|rcerreto: worth noticing that only a very lucky hearth position allows making 5@h|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s8|nt|xenya: very nice defence|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He may when it takes Schou this long to respond to Blackwood|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Brøndum is not allowed to field a psyche|pg||

nt|feffo: sorry all|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ritong: although if west does not cash @hs immediately..|pg||

nt|ritong: and why would he|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: all no trumps and red suit games make but club lead defeats slams|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ritong: how so, 1@s?|pg||
nt|roghog: @c lead to 10 and K. What then?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sigurjonsson had problems to fin a pass:) Nice quality|pg||
nt|xenya: 5 imps to Angelini on 5, when they stopped in 3@H in the other room, just making|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@c some relay|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sunsamvar: tough to duck the @Ca on the lead tho|pg||
nt|roghog: very true|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That will beat it, but as Sunil points out, it's quite a defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i agree that the earlier pass by W followed by a last-second 4H looks a bit like a good guess after a self-inflicted endplay. however, if most of the time the E sequence would mean ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4 trumps, then W will have decent play opposite a LOT of hands, even:  xxx  Axxx  xx  xxxx|pg||
nt|lestergold: so lead makes a difference of three tricks here|pg||
nt|paulg:  a bit of work to do here, but will probably lead the @cA from hand at some point and it will get easier|pg||
nt|sssvablue: action double by S|pg||
nt|snorris:  2@s and 3@cs dont look natural|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: 3@s forcing|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: defence may be cashing 5 clubs.. so east cannot duck|pg||

nt|april7: he will lead a @C, otherwise S must take the finesse and make 9 tricks at least|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: They play an usual system of opening leads ...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bjacobs: That shows either an odd number of clubs with an honour, or an even number of clubs without an honour|pg||
nt|ritong: visibly, the bell rung in fulvio s mind|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Definitely, but there's not much to go on|pg||
nt|mbruun: Nine tricks are there now|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N must be a serious slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: with a better hand N would have cuebid over 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: nunes doubled 1@c, then he might try for 4 @h tricks|pg||
nt|milton_se: another push -- low scores|pg||
nt|xenya:  i think they'll stop there|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: am told:  Bocchi - Madala pair reached and made 6@s on  5|pg||
nt|sybarra: as we can see in the OR here|pg||
nt|paulg:  currently Duboin can see 7 tricks with endplay possibilities for an 8th|pg||
nt|haans: not the best slam ever :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  he also knows that the defence will not be helpful, as they have found their two suits to attack|pg||
nt|dima:  Looks like 1@h and 2@d for another push|pg||
nt|snorris:  2@s is any hand exept with minimum and 5 @hs|pg||
nt|xenya: rather hard to bid slam with any degree of certainty|pg||
pc|h8|nt|snorris:  and 3@cs 2 suiter |pg||
nt|snorris:  a chanse for some pickup here for the Danes?|pg||

mb|d!|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In the meantime, it's looking good for Germany against Sweden in the other semi-final. 136-100 after 5 comparisons, but still time for the Swedes to come back|pg||

nt|haans: we do know that :)|pg||
nt|dima:  450 is a bit strange ...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @C slam?|pg||
nt|april7: Angelini got lazy, but can afford it till now|pg||
nt|mbruun: Im the only Danish bridgehooligan around|pg||
nt|rcerreto: think so but you're forgiven :)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Wearing funny hats and drinking beers while singing the natinal anthum|pg||
nt|xenya: might be some excitement here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Score is 420 so as basketball player says we still got 3 point game :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: Isn't Roland Danish?:)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bjacobs: 1@H natural and 100% forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @H must be @S's|pg||
nt|pkl: One more gunslinger deal. 4@S and 4@H wins|pg||
nt|xenya: oh sure -- if they are in the mood of taking risk |pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  i wonder if double is takeout or just hearts?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do u belive in a @D lead? 5@H might OK|pg||
nt|pkl: S hand looks like 3NT to me|pg||
nt|mbruun: Hes sitting right next to me|pg||
nt|xenya: NS can make 4@H or 4@S it seems|pg||
nt|rcerreto: yes, but he's supposed to be neutral!! :)|pg||
nt|mbruun: He doesnt look neutral to me|pg||
nt|rcerreto: lol|pg||
nt|rcerreto: funny opening bid|pg||
nt|mbruun: Very lucky 4M|pg||
nt|rcerreto: Versace didn't foresee 4@h as a makeable contract|pg||
nt|snorris:  no game on here despite 26hp|pg||
mb|d|nt|snorris:  combined|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pkl: 4@C a fit-bid: clubs and spades|pg||
nt|dima:  Not a beauty but would make if they get there - I would tip 3NT again|pg||
nt|milton_se: 3C should encourage South|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: N endplayed|pg||
nt|haans: transfer respones more and more common. All need to talk about what x and 1@S mean|pg||
nt|pkl: ... ahh perhaps a trick short|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but Angelini showed his pattern anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: some might be tempted to bid 2@d with east hand but just as well he didn't since west will then surely jump to 3N|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@D = spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  I used to play that X was hearts and 1@s takeout, but now play X is takeout and 1@s=hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|haans: agree there|pg||
nt|haans: for NOW ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  but perhaps I should not have said that as I play transfer responses too|pg||
nt|dima:  Not the first time I had to eat my words :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: funny auction|pg||
nt|rcerreto: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N by N might work|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|snorris:  well a @s lead perhaps..?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: why should he bid 2@d?|pg||
nt|pkl: In real life, I also believe that 5@H will be a winner. |pg||
nt|rodal f: This table at least find out that they miss 2A|pg||
nt|dima:  Well seriously HÃ¤usler now knows that finesses are likely to be right|pg||
nt|rcerreto: now, if it were not for those annoying 4 loosers...|pg||
nt|mbruun: 3 down on a spade lead|pg||
nt|xenya: or if E elecxts to duck now...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: then it is nice to me just commenator|pg||
nt|rodal f: So a sac to come? No|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good contract, wrong cards|pg||
nt|rcerreto: a good save, anyway|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sunsamvar: def cant get the @C ruff AND the @Dk as east will be declaring the 4@H contract|pg||
nt|april7: there is a chance if S continues @D!|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4@H was a fine contract in the other room ... here the Italians cannot go wrong, as they have put @DK on lead|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 nt is a dicey contract|pg||
nt|dima:  was 4@c Blackwood in clubs?|pg||
nt|milton_se: seems that 4C was RKC|pg||
nt|snorris:  bingo!!|pg||
nt|xenya: which he did -- |pg||
mc|10|nt|dima:  I think so and 4@h sound like 3|pg||

nt|snorris:  no|pg||
mb|1C|nt|paulg:  possible that some EW may bid to 3NT on that hand|pg||
nt|haans: slam again|pg||
nt|dima:  Precision 2@c opening got in the way in the OR somehow|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rodal f: A spec told me that W might wandered to X for get a @D lead. |pg||
nt|mbruun: Blackwood stop in 5S|pg||

mb|2D|nt|Walddk4: Our matches at 20.00 local time (in 3 hours) will be France Hosts vs Iceland and Allegra Italy vs Germany|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry pd i had 18 hcps and a great suit!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: great result for the italians in open room|pg||

mb|p|nt|bessi2: well.. would have worked better here in any case.. 3n plays well.. might even make |pg||

nt|sssvablue: 3@d natural and invitational|pg||
nt|feffo: hi Rodolfo wlc|pg||
nt|rcerreto: hi everybody|pg||
nt|sssvablue: ciao|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mbruun: South has two aces on every hand |pg||

mb|p|nt|jstokes: and I forgot to draw trumps :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Roland :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: the injustice of it al|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: they will be in @H here... 6 or 7 ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our matches in round 4 (in 2 hours and 25 minutes) will be France Hosts vs Russia and Italy Allegra vs Norway|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You mean they don't have the tools to find out about the missing @HQ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I will bet a whole lot of something that they don't reach 7@H|pg||
nt|roghog: not sure if the raise is always 4|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt a make if play spade finesses|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D reverse|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@c, natural and forcing looks a good start here|pg||
nt|pkl: I would not play D as Lebensohl in this situation, but who knows?|pg||
nt|mbruun: Discountblackwood|pg||
nt|rcerreto: any idea what 3NT means?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Tournament website: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/09Paris/Paris.htm |pg||
nt|xenya: again the slammish 3N|pg||
nt|snorris:  ns can win 3 @s ..not more|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  or perhaps 4@c to show the slam intent|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: North needs to find out 3 things:  aces, @DK, @HQ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And now things are even better for the Bamberg team|pg||
nt|rcerreto: serious slam try?|pg||
nt|snorris:  a good game mind you after the opening in east|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: lost the @H suit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not yet|pg||
nt|bessi2: he will surely bid 3h now|pg||
nt|jstokes: 3N is OK too|pg||
nt|bessi2: but 2n seems like an underbid to me|pg||
nt|roghog: Isn't that 4? :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One very simple way to do it is 4NT over 2@H - if partner bids 5@S (2 aces, @HQ), he can bid 5NT asking for a cue-bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: All right 4 things, you pedant :)|pg||
nt|ritong: moi?:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so none of the above Paul |pg||
nt|haans: 4th suit or anythink but GF|pg||
nt|pkl: And I mean Lightner, of course. |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Another 11 imps|pg||
nt|mbruun: I thought it denied shortage|pg||
nt|xenya: yup|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: very friendly layout hee for E/W|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ritong: they will probably discover @h Q is missing|pg||
nt|haans: did the 4th suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: makes sense,   and then now can find the trump suit |pg||
nt|mbruun: Apparently it didnt|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rcerreto: good old blackwood to follow|pg||
nt|snorris:   but unlucky with the brake in @ss|pg||
nt|xenya: on 8, the Danes did too much work -- they got to 7 (!) @S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: Seriously, this is the auction you should have in SAYC:  1@D-1@H-2@H-4NT-5@H-6@H|pg||
nt|roghog: he is too embarrassed to use a simple 4NT on VG|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or something like that, anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: there are other considerations|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I guess so - eg a 3-card raise|pg||
nt|ritong: like maybe @h is not the right suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is where the French are at an advantage?  2@H would show 4?|pg||
nt|ritong: it is not really an advantage|pg||
nt|paulg:  this works okay unless partner supports hearts, and then there is confusion about trumps|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as I wrote him, but could it be any other lead left from E after the 4@C bid?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ralfwil: a lot of guesses in this contract. |pg||
nt|pkl: Guess hearts or clubs... Hearts will NOT be guessed, I guess ;-)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y, and I belive the @H will be missed so then @C are to hit. Lets see:)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: North virtually endplayed at trick 1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pkl: A reasonable contract: wins if diamonds come home. They just don't today|pg||
nt|xenya: classic auction|pg||
nt|snorris:  dimond lead from the king..|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hedyg: 9 quick tricks, when @hs split give K@D|pg||
nt|ritong: it just saves the checking bids|pg||
nt|rcerreto: blackwood got out of fashion in Italy, still I think it's simple and effective|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, this will make, but not a great advert for the system when a simple 1@S overcall means you can't find a 4-4 fit (unless 3@S showed hearts and West rejected hearts to play NT) ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  |pg||
nt|lestergold: at least diamond never cost a trick|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like some sort of Turbo here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: however, this is 13 for azzurri|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|xenya: some hands are tailor-made for blackwood, this is one of them|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|rcerreto: quite so, yes|pg||
nt|snorris:  not enough..|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|ritong: yes, 12|pg||
nt|ritong: they played in @ds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Back to 13.  Very unfortunate for the Swedes who OBVIOUSLY knew what they were doing and paid the price|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, 13|pg||
nt|haans: 5nt-7?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bjacobs: You really should be able to call the match referee and get the imp result adjusted on the board|pg||
nt|ritong: come on|pg||
nt|ritong: there is a gambling part in the game|pg||
nt|bjacobs: nope.  I am offended by this result|pg||
nt|roghog: You should get moral IMPs|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ritong: but they do|pg||
nt|sybarra: obviously @C's are trump to S |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|roghog: So a good but unlucky player could be a Moral Grand Master|pg||
nt|ritong: afterwards, it goes " we did OK, but the b....ds called a dubious grand"|pg||
nt|haans: just playing now?|pg||
nt|pkl: So what to do in clubs? NS in the other room guessed correctly, it seems|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  South can hardly be better here, but concerned that partner only has four hearts and there is a pointed loser ... 6@d is a nice bid|pg||
nt|pkl: I can't see any guidance here. What about you? |pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: nowday 5nt to not ask for KING but ask to show a K|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D = @DK|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|xenya: some sort of mix-up happened on 8 in the OR -- not only did the Danes bid 7 missimg an ace, they played it ina 4-3 imstead of 5-5  fit...|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|pkl: There was a suggestion to play for split aces. Split red queens is just as good|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||

mc|9|nt|pkl: Ah... North has some reason to believe that W has @DAce|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well. A puch. Well guessed|pg||

nt|lestergold: even with this lead and the clubs favourable there are problems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont have a problem with a 3N bid with all those high spots, and whenever pd is going to accept it can help to have bid it yourself|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You would expect 3@H to have made in the OR ... but the defence was machiavellian|pg||
nt|pkl: Schollaardt might well be correct, but there is only room for ten characters in the name|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications not great either|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|marlowepi: opps may defend differently--and to their advantage--if you only invite|pg||
nt|lestergold: I dont really agree the pips make it worth an invite not a unilatreral raise|pg||
nt|h bertens: If you want to bid them this surely is the best way to do it|pg||
nt|haans: in norway you play low enc but low odd count|pg||
pc|d7|nt|snorris:  a @d lead had tobe a small|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|hedyg: 4@s some kind of last train?|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely 4@s implies @d control|pg||
nt|dima:  That is a fight :)|pg||
nt|dima:  I would rather use 4@d overcall to show reds if W opens 2@s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Seems obvious to lead @S, which will force  declarer and control will be a major issue|pg||
nt|dima:  @s shift now?|pg||
nt|dima:  I guess @c card was count so declarer is either 0=6=4=3 or actual shape|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: anybody know if they play turbo?|pg||
nt|bessi2: assuming 4c was nat showing 5,  then 5c was somewhat of an underbid|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|snorris:  not that east would fall for it..|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bessi2: well if 4h showed 4clubs then maybe not|pg||
nt|pkl: Would anyone not D with Wests cards?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|rcerreto: unavoidable, I think|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dima:  Now declarer is in control |pg||
nt|xenya: no matter where the @SK is|pg||
nt|xenya: there is hardly any @D guess here -- because S had opened|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it just goes to show that even Lauria-Versace can miss a decent slam. There's hope for the rest of us yet. |pg||

nt|mdgraham: and let's face it, this one is only sort of decent - an ace and Qxxx of trumps missing |pg||
nt|jcmax: bye all!|pg||
nt|lestergold: bye Sabine|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sorry, 3@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Running scores for new specs: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=805&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Seems to be going -2|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 3@s with a 7-5 is not something you can foresee|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: indeed,  the kind of hand you don't mind bidding the slam and you don't mind stopping in game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bye Sabine thx|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bye Sabine|pg||
nt|lestergold: we have a roland special here|pg||
nt|haans: Landy comming up|pg||
nt|rcerreto: then you're fixed|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Wild set of cards, 78 IMPs so far|pg||
nt|rcerreto: yes, a very good sacrifice :)|pg||
nt|snorris:  3@s e-w again|pg||
nt|xenya: and now the last board|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: ok now we can talk cars & sports|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: 20/20 hcp division|pg||
nt|april7: then cross ruff|pg||
nt|snorris:  3@ds: inviting with @hs|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: 5@c showed an odd nr of keycards but with @H void...very difficult for Lauria IMO|pg||
nt|xenya: last hand now and 3 more to compare -- the OR is still on 9|pg||
nt|rcerreto: again two aces missing, again 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rcerreto: not the kind of hands the Danes are needing|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: 2@d 10-13 @d|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|snorris:  this might go -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Yep so 3 imps to Bamberg |pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: indeed,  he probably felt he had done more than enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no pressure here from N/S at these colours so an easy ride for E/W|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W almost has enough to try 3H hoping for perfect fitter|pg||
nt|pkl: A perfectly normal 4@S - that can win now|pg||
nt|rcerreto: difficult defense here|pg||
nt|xenya: let me remind you that the actual score is 116-58 Angelini |pg||
nt|april7: exactly double|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|snorris:  if east finesses south for the quenn of @s|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roghog: @C takes the entry, but fortunately there will be another one|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if south ducks and Fantoni knowing the layout continues with a low @D ?|pg||
nt|dima:  We are at the last board of the 1st segment and German team has opened up a very useful lead on a strong set by GromÃ¶ller - HÃ¤usler here|pg||
nt|dima:  I think besides that @d J play on the board N2 they were just about flawless|pg||
nt|dima:  And the score should be 35:7 ....|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: 16 hcp missing so W have it|pg||
nt|sssvablue: This will make now|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|haans: 17|pg||
nt|sybarra: nt places a lot (all) of the cards|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|haans: may be unlucky|pg||
nt|haans: lead of K = dubbleton|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dima:  A powerful effort for a new partnership as knowing spectators mention|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Zia-style double|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|bessi2: the dreaded 4-2 fit, but it will handle very well and make easily enough it seems|pg||
nt|hedyg: the lead helped|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes,  it certainly didn't cripple declarer|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: with 3 cards in @s W would have corrected to 2@s|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but is @S is wrong that wd be winning line|pg||
nt|rcerreto: very hard for N to win with the ace to play a @c back|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Ron needed to play ace @h and shift to a club|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: looks like a trivial ten tricks|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|mcarroll: Looks like 35-8 will be the score as 4@S also in Open|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dima:  Losing one of each nondiamond for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|paulg:  very strange|pg||
nt|paulg:  sorry, that was a comment to someone else!|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rcerreto: right, but it would have been a disaster had S had @hQ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Thanks everyone|pg||
nt|pkl: Yes - that defense was probably impossible to find. An unlucky lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: Next|pg||
pc|c9|nt|snorris:   a little fether in the hat of n-s|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pkl: An easy slam to bid and make.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
mc|8|nt|dima:  I think N8 is a push so score is 35-7|pg||
nt|xenya: mind you, 4@S is not as insane as it mght look|pg||
nt|snorris:  gratulation to Angelini|pg||
nt|snorris:  this was the last boards?|pg||
