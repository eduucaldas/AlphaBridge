nt|vugraphzxr: Hello everybody this the second segment of the semi finale between Sweden et Germany teams'|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|an| |nt|vugraphzxr: the semi final : 4 segments of 12 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: so far all South´s bids have been relays|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|benjent: I'm not 100% sure on the systems being played, but I think NS are playing strong club, and South's bidding here has been entirely relays|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|ritong: wish them to find this excellent @c grand|pg||
nt|udo: my guess:  3@S was complete shape, 4 @C keycard@C, 4@D minimum  4@H keycard|pg||
nt|benjent: Piekarek-Smirnov play, I think, a version of Polish club|pg||
nt|udo: usual agreement in relais systems|pg||
nt|udo: 4!NT 1 or 4 keys|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|an| |mb|p|mb|5H|an| |nt|udo: 3 NT in the other room ist surprising, at least small slam should be found|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|an| |nt|benjent: I have an old version of the Cullin-Upmark card ... I think 2@d showed a minimum with a shortage somewhere|pg||
nt|po-s: that´s correct, 5-7 zz points (321 for ace,king,queen|pg||
nt|udo: looks like a bidding missunderstanding in othe other room about the 3 NT bid|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good afternoon to Tjolpe Flodqvist|pg||
nt|benjent: They also play 1430 RKCB, so I suspect they didn't need the minimum step response to 4@c - so 4@d was probably 1 or 4 key cards for @c|pg||
nt|udo: possible, yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|7C|nt|ritong: nice|pg||
nt|udo: well done|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Somewhere in that sequence from 4@d through 6@d, I expect Cullin showed his Ks, and that was enough for Upmark|pg||
nt|po-s: I´m not sure that South could RKCB w 4C - it may well have been a further relay|pg||
nt|benjent: Nice to have detailed relay methods on hands like this|pg||
nt|udo: so, a huge 14 imp swing for start|pg||
nt|benjent: How long will Upmark spend wondering if he can make against a 5-0 trump break ? :)|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Hello Vladimir|pg||
nt|jbgood: good evening|pg||
nt|xenya: a routine 4@S to warm up|pg||
nt|haans: mini NT is not rutine|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The player names are reversed|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: on a diamond lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: actually i expected a minor suit bidding war here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Angelini-Versace do not play mini-NT. E-W do|pg||
nt|april7: Hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|dima:  Likely GromÃ¶ller-HÃ¤usler will get to Grand here - they were very efficient in the 1st segment|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|xenya: no but i xpect the contract to be reached in the OR as well -- probably on a different auction|pg||
nt|xenya: oh|pg||
nt|april7: S is looking for an adequate bid to find out about the K of @C to get to 7, he will find it I suppose|pg||
nt|dima:  Now (if they play sort of standard) South knows that North is 1=5=3=4 or actual shape so 13 tricks is matter of keycards|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|haans: do look balanced but yes they may have changed|pg||
nt|haans: italy are playing game here|pg||

pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Paris for the 8th European Champions' Cup. Twelve teams divided into two groups. Matches of 20 boards in the round-robin. This is a round 2 match ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: from group A|pg||
nt|dima:  Well this start will make swedish fans sit up right :)|pg||
mc|12|nt|ralfwil: looks like a cheap save in 4@s. Let´s see if the sacrifie had been correcy|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make after S has shown a black 2-suiter|pg||
nt|haans: names wrong|pg||
nt|april7: I'm very astount with 20 HP and 4 aces not to reach the slam, S figured N to have psyched perhaps|pg||

nt|udo: great @C lead ag 3 NT here in the other room ( from E ! )|pg||
nt|benjent: I think that CR @c lead was from a man looking for a swing ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|po-s: p-2D-P-3NT|pg||
mb|r|nt|ritong: i think that bertheau s pass was that|pg||
nt|po-s: sorry - it would have been the auction by Bertheau-Nystrom|pg||
mb|1H|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|udo: now @S lead ag. 3 SA ?|pg||
nt|udo: or what to bid with North now ?|pg||
nt|benjent: I expect so ... West has suggested them, and Cullin's 3NT will focus on the @h stopper|pg||
nt|udo: is 3 @S only a stopper ?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|udo: now its easy........|pg||
nt|benjent: Interesting choice by E to bid 1@h. With no real preference between the majors, and nothing useful in his hand, I expected him to pass the XX|pg||
mb|4D|nt|tjolpe:  too much science by North|pg||
nt|udo: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|benjent: I'm not keen on North's 3@h here - much better to play 3NT from his hand and have the weak (ie blind) hand on lead|pg||
nt|udo: hamman rule would have been correct here|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|udo: guess the lead ?:)|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  It's a pity they didn't profit from the pass and logical club lead in the other room|pg||
nt|benjent: Cullin's clearly expecting a better hand from Upmark - and he's looking for a @d slam|pg||
nt|udo: i dont know if its common sense, but i thin a  better hand would pass 1 @H and pull the possible double or bid later|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|udo: think|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: hello Rashed|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H for NS -- a sacrifice by EW might prove too expensive|pg||
nt|rnmalik: looks like 4@H for NS and good save in 4 @S by EW|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|haans: have not seen that prempt before :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wasted points in @S will doom this 3 nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: well an unlucky habd for N/S here no play 3N likely to be flat tho |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as you say, a killing lead|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|xenya: of course nothing can make S to stop short of game|pg||
nt|ritong: 1410 points at stake|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ybob: now 4@H and W ?|pg||
nt|haans: But Multon has |pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: ok 4@S X|pg||
nt|xenya: now you take the money|pg||
nt|haans: all bidding go to 4@H down|pg||
nt|vugraphzxq: DAILY BULLETIN IS FALSED I AM CORRECT|pg||
nt|dima:  I think there was misunderstanding - S meant that 3@h fixed trumps and 3NT was a gadget asking for Q|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jbgood: hi Sigurbjørn|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: this will drift -1 quietly |pg||
nt|haans: Hi Henri|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4@h in the limit for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: north will try a finesse against the ten of diamonds sadly not on today|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Very unlikely to psych standing +28 on the first board of the segment|pg||
pc|c5|nt|april7: so it was a misunderstanding|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: Hello Ralf|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|xenya: please Elisabeth, tell us who is who|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|xenya: N has 8 top tricks and little chance for a 9th -- so he will run the clubs first in the hope something good happens|pg||
nt|lestergold: he can only play 3 rounds now as he needs one for a second entry to repeat the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|haans: must be lavinthal to @D|pg||
nt|ritong: it is|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|xenya: on second thoughts, the save looks cheap enough|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: the@D return  is best i think|pg||
nt|ybob: 500 if play A @S first|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S has no choice|pg||
nt|xenya: now declarer might go wrong|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dima:  Nice lead by Fredrik NystrÃ¶m|pg||
mc|8|nt|lestergold: seond heart discard may have been dangerous on a different layout|pg||
nt|xenya: now he might take the @D finesse -- seeing E has pitched 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: and mouiel would have played the queen if he had it|pg||
pg||

nt|benjent: diamonds and a decent hand|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|udo: nearly impossible to reach 2@H here ?|pg||
nt|benjent: Clearcut lead, but also the lead that will cut 2@s to ribbons. Bad trump layout, and every finesse losing will completely doom 2@s|pg||

nt|benjent: Best prospect for 2@s is to get lucky with the location of the red K and @sA. Swap the NS hands, and 2@s is in the making zone|pg||
nt|benjent: Maybe not actually making, but in the zone :)|pg||
nt|po-s: North has shown 2x KJ so maybe declarer will try hearts instead|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: strange play by E|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this 4@H looks better|pg||
nt|cuan: i don't think so|pg||
nt|dima:  With a nothing hand and no move in a major from Partner he figures that partner has values in clubs. |pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: -3 instead of 2, still a good save|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 3@C was a game bid|pg||
nt|ritong: 5or8 hundreds|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: ah S did diuble -- i was wondering why he didn't at first |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Sveta Bodrenkova|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by east preferbly|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|dima:  A couple of vulnerable undertricks here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sfoxa: Hello to all, sorry for being late - rush hour in the rainy evening dosn't look good )))|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: W woild love to put in a word, but the vulnerability deters him|pg||
nt|ralfwil: without a @h lead 6@s is makeable|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 6@C is cold regardless of lead|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H lead difficult |pg||
nt|Walddk4: In Minsk?|pg||
nt|haans: despite that it looks like the normal bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: looks natural to play his trump at that point|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sfoxa: yes, here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@S is better as it does not need @Sk to be right|pg||
nt|lestergold: this should make tho|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|bessi2: unlucky lead for south here |pg||
pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: only for 6@s a @h lead will defeat|pg||
nt|xenya: @H lead is not impossible to find |pg||
nt|rnmalik: tough decision for E|pg||
nt|xenya: actually it looks quite logical|pg||
nt|ybob: to me impossible|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and BC Quantum comes from?|pg||
nt|xenya: well E can count on his @SQ to win a trick -- N should have both A and K on the auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not necessarily best, as South needs exit cards outside the spade suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and that removed one of them|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|xenya: and there it is|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he found it!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well done|pg||
nt|xenya: so E should try to set up a trick ina side suit, and that can be only @Hs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tho there is the danger of @C ruff in 4@S|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|lestergold: natural to play in 3n when all suits stopped and fits only a 7 carder|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: After teh @s support I prefer 6@c from N and S has to choose between @s or @c. What´s your opinion?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: even a dim lead would not have beatn 3non this kind layout|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what id @Sk and @Ca were exchanged|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what if|pg||
nt|xenya: S can see his fate -- if he ducks, he will be endplayed eventually... |pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: good play here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: @DJ|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but he can also see that the duck will disrupt declarer's communication|pg||
nt|xenya: now 11 tricks are available|pg||
nt|xenya: true Sunil|pg||
nt|dima:  Cullin - Upmark reached 7@c on N1 in the OR so sweidish team starts with a bang in this segment|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rnmalik: 6@S a better contract slight misdefend and home.|pg||

nt|xenya: oh i missed that -- did he make?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but the question was 6@s or 6@c from N and hand over to S to decide|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, at 800, I am sure that he will be equable about it |pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: Madala had no bid|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Sveta can make it ... only just|pg||
nt|dima:  No avoidance play in @d suit for NystrÃ¶m here, likely to fail by a trick|pg||
nt|april7:  N will lead @S after the @D trick and the contract will be 1 off|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: this helps declarer |pg||
nt|dima:  making sure that partner splits his honors (if he has them)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: well if N/S allow vulnerable interventions of south's type on a festering suit  in a fersteing hand, then north should have gone more cautiously|pg||
nt|pelu: West cant bid 1NT over 1@S - 1Nt = 15-17 - so he has to bid 2@C|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sfoxa: yes, living in the European bridge suburb...|pg||

nt|mdgraham: the sort where you will probably go down a packet, and there is diddly-squat on for the opponents|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks a bit too high -- apparently N was hoping for a better hand with S for his vulnerable overcall|pg||
nt|april7: it was a chance|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: and this 3N seems to have three club tricks and two in each |pg||

pc|hA|nt|ritong: let s make it 1 NT was optional|pg||

nt|jbgood: all of a sudden a good slam..|pg||
nt|dima:  With 10+ black cards there could be another action then 1@s overcall|pg||

nt|haans: France may go to high here|pg||
nt|dima:  some shape some fit - might get interesting here|pg||
nt|april7: an easy 4@H or 4@S, but not more|pg||
nt|dima:  Also some easy minor suit contract for EW|pg||
nt|dima:  so about a small slam on a finesse through opener|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: I know a couple of pairs who, after an obviously flat board like that, will try to needle the opposition - a comment like "Oh, well bid, good job we didn't get any higher, etc." ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: That sort of thing |pg||
nt|cuan: duck is wrong, after elimination|pg||
nt|april7: 5@H a good save against makable 5@C|pg||
mb|4N|nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: thin slam on|pg||
nt|dima:  Peter is not going to pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: cant they make 6 of either minor?|pg||
nt|dima:  So now we have some guessing games at the high level|pg||
nt|dima:  I think 12 tricks are available|pg||
nt|sybarra: dima you mentioned the possible 6 above|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|cuan: 2@C = 6@C or 5@C+4@D 11-15|pg||
nt|dima:  It is the matter of bidding, Nystrom gives a lot of leeway, but still might be pushed into "sacrifice"|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sybarra: may "take" it early also |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa: if NS reach 5@d, EW can sacrifice in 5@s|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: short suit try no doubt|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its cold on the 2/2 spade break|pg||
nt|dima:  So far nobody know who is in attack who is in defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet the pass by W shows the ace  |pg||
nt|dima:  Now West might figure that partner is void in hearts otherwise would vul opponents go to the 5 level with only 4-card support?|pg||
nt|sybarra: W asking if it is his lead  (joke)|pg||
nt|dima:  East sorry|pg||
mb|5H|nt|xenya: i think it's better to throw 10 (2nd highest) from Q108x --makes things much clearer|pg||
nt|haans: right kick them|pg||
mb|6C|nt|jbgood: and hard to imagine why N let the opps win 3 nt by giving away the first club trick on  1|pg||
nt|haans: the must take 4 pronto|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: for me a pass on W is not so far away after 1@s from E|pg||
nt|haans: @DA + small|pg||

nt|dima:  All pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Peter Lund what system are the danes playing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: good old Acol style|pg||
nt|dima:  Uh-oh|pg||
nt|sybarra: S thinking they have 2 major suit tricks,.....NOT|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: another swing for EW|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sfoxa: yes, that was costly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @DQ or @cq|pg||
nt|dima:  I would not hurry about the swing - but surely very solid result|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sunsamvar: south may not be too happy with North's @h shortage|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland would approve|pg||
nt|xenya: NS play POlish Club i believe, so N's hand is almost super maximum for the 1@S opening -- and S's response was positive|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Marshall Lewis|pg||
nt|lestergold: Balicki didnt need much from his pard to make a slam here|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|benjent: Odds have improved for short @c in South, but you need a much bigger disparity in NS's shapes to justify taking the finesse here|pg||
nt|benjent: With the likely vacant spaces, playing for the drop is still about 4-5% better than the finesse here|pg||
nt|benjent: And when you factor in the imp effect of losing a @c finesse now (ie ditch extra undertricks), it's not close|pg||
nt|benjent: For the technically-minded, North needs 5 more vacant spaces than South for the @c finesse to be right|pg||
nt|tjolpe:  so he's doing his math or just posing?|pg||
nt|benjent: For these combos, it's probably better to have done the maths ahead of time :)|pg||

nt|haans: most bid 1nt with weaker hand but not Norway |pg||
nt|haans: have seen it before|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose it depends on the range you play for 1NT in the fourth position |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can play 9-12, 11-14, or even 15-17|pg||
nt|dima:  Stayman and Smolen|pg||
nt|sybarra: smolen |pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: for east to hold 3127 + not open with a club preempt nv vs vul,  well it was possible but the finesse was with the odds i believe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a club lead will make things awkward, but how can East find that?|pg||
nt|haans: only double dummy|pg||

mb|3N|nt|serhat: Murat butun gun msn de bir acmiyor gorelim hatir soralim|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Chemla can afford to bid 3N on this moderate 12 count  because opening bids in France are somewhat sounder than many play elsewhere|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double dummy there is an extra chance that the slam could also be made if the same hand holds 3 spades and four Ds and 3 clubs. so declarer might star: spade ace, club toward jack.|pg||
nt|xenya: provided NS don't do something silly later|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry was writing that before N played....that is exactly what he did and why|pg||

mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: one of my team's matches was on BBO this week - so if you make a mistake ( and we made a few) it feels a lot worse |pg||
nt|ritong: it cost 12 to some team|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: In the open room on the last board the @Hj was led and declarer went up with the Ace|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|sfoxa: hm, I know few buddies willing to compete with 2@s with N's hand|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: is 3@C some kind of strong Bergen raise ?|pg||

pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: Did they survive?|pg||

pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: This is a bad lead|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Partner is a passed hand and you are vulnerable|pg||

pc|s9|nt|april7: very good defence!!|pg||

nt|sybarra: nice  for N/S and e/w started out so well |pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: a spec says --maybe they play 2NT as a natural bid , so 3@C must become Jacoby 2NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a very lucky layout here for E/W probably will make 9 triks if East decides tooptimistically raise this|pg||
nt|lestergold: very borderline|pg||
nt|ahri: their CC says 3@c was 12-17 with fit|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: fourth in hand? Sure|pg||
nt|xenya: not without interest though|pg||
nt|xenya: endplay? but S has 3 clubs|pg||
nt|dima:  NS might slightly overcompete in @c|pg||
nt|dima:  like 2@c - 2@s - 3@c - ?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|haans: meaning U pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as someone who dislikes the Michaels convention, it is quite satisfying to see one get taken out on a stretcher|pg||
nt|sybarra: and then? |pg||
nt|april7: ppX|pg||
nt|dima:  will become interesting :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: but as there arent the entries to play club finesses from dummy declarer is forced to bang down club ace and with ace hearts with north thats 9 tricks to b made|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|ahri: and for curious specs: 1M-2NT is not natural. they play it as 10-11 with 4card support or any 6-9 splinter.|pg||
nt|lestergold: spades cant be continued so defence cant do anythinmg|pg||
nt|ahri: to be more precise, it's over 1@S; over 1@H, they play it one step below.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: basically a 50% slam here?|pg||
nt|ritong: i agree|pg||
nt|po-s: too good form a simple 3C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may be the "get out bid" |pg||
nt|dima:  Some Good-Bad on the way|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||

mb|3C|nt|sybarra: which will get X'd|pg||

nt|dima:  Well opponents have 8-card fit, South is still unlimited|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not sure he is forced to do that. if heart ace or ten is doubleton he will have an entry to dummy and there are various club layouts he could play for to give him 4 tricks in the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: round suits|pg||
nt|dima:  So good bad seem to apply|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: i expectea dim switch|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: me too|pg||
nt|ahri: CC says Smith, SP discards; udca |pg||

pc|s3|nt|sfoxa: which plan accepts declarer? playing for 4-4 in clubs or for 3-3 in hearts? both work, actually |pg||

nt|sfoxa: should this dbl have special meaning, or...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and as this is not a Gambling-3NT type auction, you cannot blame West for the lead. Against an opening 3NT, West would likely lead @SA and then switch to hearts, which would defeat ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT. But I would still open it in fourht seat.   |pg||
nt|haans: easy 2nt for me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: France of course made 3N on 6 and are in it again on 7 to open up a decent lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this 2@h overcall is really scary - 1@S?|pg||
nt|dima:  not easy but as advanced sacrifice vs 4@s|pg||
nt|april7: W saved S probably!|pg||
nt|dima:  Not so easy to steal here though, now NystrÃ¶m will have a chance to bid 4@d ?|pg||

mb|4S|nt|ritong: here we go|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 6@C here|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but no hearts lead then|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant actually see 3n going off but ill be surprised if they bid it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like misunderstanding here about 2C|pg||
nt|ritong: pass over 6@s is " i have first round @s control"|pg||
nt|april7: tough bidding from both sides|pg||
nt|sybarra: now?|pg||
nt|dima:  Do we see lowly promotion here :)?|pg||
nt|dima:  that @s 6 is looking sweet but will not help|pg||
nt|april7: X or 5@D, but the vulnerability calls for X, except N could be very weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems to me bidding 5 @d over 4 would have been better so opps do not know their major suit |pg||
nt|dima:  And we have a new leader again|pg||
nt|sybarra: S now worried  N could hold xx in spades |pg||
mb|5D|nt|xenya: 2N looks OK to me, but it is fraught here|pg||

nt|haans: here a good slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: most fascinating this defence badgered declarer into avoiding the spade finesse so was very effective|pg||
nt|lestergold: cannot knock a defence that beet this contact when it wa laydown as cards lie|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to see how the 5 could hurt even playing that--in fact it would be easier to read as from 3 than the 4-spot is|pg||
mb|1D|nt|haans: or 6@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or even 6@H|pg||

nt|mdgraham: so the only question is will NS get there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good stuff this - 2000 in doubled penalties on four boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa: EW will find their way to 3nt, nothing special|pg||
nt|sfoxa: u-hu|pg||
nt|haans: did North really pass?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxq: yes|pg||
nt|dima:  EW play a system where 1@d could be 0 @d so gromÃ¶ller has an unusual decision to  make|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: by contrast, this hand looks easy enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: I thought declarer had a chance after playing all the @C should have AJ@D, the N hand would be squeezed|pg||
nt|sfoxa: oops!!!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lucky on 6@C as 3nt somehow failed too|pg||
nt|lestergold: when Balicki declined to ive opartner the marked seond dimaond ruff taking a chance in so doing he kcould probabbly see that giving the ruff at that time would have let the ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: contract through- this defence showed why they are world class players in spite of the occasional wild bid made|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: How was the contract on previous bd laydown Mike ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: now 3 @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt ?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: it;s a cold slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: he could have evenbtually entered hand with a heart ruff and finessed the spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, they do tend to pay attention to their trick target at this level and defend accordingly, yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: and off they go|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just seem the movie - North ducked two spades, then led @CK from hand. Not a success on the actual layout |pg||
nt|lestergold: defence were only due three bullets and two ruffs|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 3 ruffs|pg||
nt|xenya: thy won't stop of 6@C now -- the question is whether they'll bid 7|pg||
nt|pelu: not so cold|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: S sounded like he had 6 spades I think |pg||
pc|c6|nt|rodal f: A normal contract by a nice layout for EW|pg||
nt|haans: slam bidding much easier if 2@H promise 4 cards|pg||
nt|xenya: *short of 6@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was a courageous and imaginative defence in which he decided what to play his partner for and how to wrong foot declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: how to bamboozle declarer from taking the winning line|pg||
nt|xenya: and i'm told the other rable is in 7|pg||
nt|xenya: *table|pg||
nt|pelu: 500 against 650|pg||

pc|cA|nt|pelu: 200 now|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North might have bid 4NT last time|pg||
nt|xenya: which is excellent looking at NS's hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is surely an excellent granny|pg||
nt|dima:  S had to bid something|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 2 nt might have promised more|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sfoxa: and with nice start, as wee see|pg||
nt|dima:  with xx in @d does not really look appealing|pg||
nt|april7: ruff and cash K of @S and play @H, 10 tricks!!!|pg||
nt|dima:  That H9 in West hand is helpful|pg||
nt|april7: 8 of@S best card!!!|pg||
pc|c9|nt|haans: need to do right in clubs|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even if they bid 7 it would make|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|sunsamvar: is 5@S asking for kings ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty easy to reach, one would think using splinters and KC|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect 4D was KC|pg||
nt|lestergold: you have to count 13 tricks i dont think everyone gets there thaty easily|pg||
nt|dima:  3@c X was duplicated in the open room|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sunsamvar: well he can count 12 tricks with 2 @D ruffs... but needs the @HK or @Sq for the 13th|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|dima:  Smile :) seeing that @s 9|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|lestergold: exactly not easy at all|pg||

nt|ritong: oole|pg||
nt|haans: suprise|pg||
nt|april7: small @H is better!!|pg||

nt|dima:  Same thing I guess|pg||
nt|april7: y|pg||
nt|april7: becaus @H 3-3|pg||
nt|dima:  3@c went -2 in the OR so we have correction|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: they will be very disappointed to lose 12 imps here|pg||

nt|dima:  How many @d is declarer supposed to cash?|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course 2N here could be too high spade lead and then dim switch and revert to spades looks lie would defeat 2n|pg||
