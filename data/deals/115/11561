mb|p|nt|hedyg: our operator is Francois Colin, bonjour Francois:)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: still, there is the danger of getitng forced |pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW probably do best to cash @SAK and switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|jstokes: yes, and crossing to dummy to lead a club increases that danger -- but increases the possibility of making|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H actually shows diamonds|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: even 3S ttypically puts enough pressure on opps in auctions like this wherethey have not made one natural bid|pg||

nt|marlowepi: outbid them in any other suit. 1S allows NS to find a red suit too|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: no - 5@c looks wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=804&qshowflag=1  running scores Group A|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@H = 10-13 with hearts, and maybe a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: ah, here we go|pg||
nt|santyclz: Harmon Edgar points out 5@cs is there for those who bid @cs as a suit.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jcmax: in any event -500 is way better than -800|pg||
nt|roghog: another fascinating idea|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@S is an enquiry, not showing spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: long way to 9th trick|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: 4H was there too|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|hedyg: this cannot be right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless Versace is in 5@Hx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double probably prepares for showing a value raise to 3H|pg||
nt|jcmax: Bocchi doubles 2@S here because his hand is not all about hearts. he has some constructive values and all of them outside hearts. Bidding 3@H would show a different kind of hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sabine said it better:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: no, I just used more words :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: people seldom outbid me in THAT respect:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: male and female?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what on earth is going on here? |pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2NT denied a minor, hence 6+ hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: @S lead will give declarer the temp |pg||
nt|sybarra: *tempo|pg||
nt|pkl: 3@S is preemptive with four cards. On the actual hand, I could be tempted to stay low with 2@S|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: 2@s weak 1suiter . 5+ cards|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bessi2: that makes no sense either|pg||
nt|jstokes: better but still seems unlikely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon West bid 4@S and South 5@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then double by West|pg||
nt|bessi2: yep,  that seems plausible|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do i get to choose?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Once again, e-w's 9 card club fit was undisclosed.|pg||
nt|jcmax: It seems like declarer has to lose 11S, 2@H and 2@D tricks. Making this contract would be tough|pg||
nt|santyclz: Who cares about @cs.|pg||
nt|santyclz: See you later folks, I've been re-assigned.|pg||
nt|jcmax: see you|pg||
nt|marlowepi: see you Joe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: send a  postcard|pg||
nt|jcmax: Maala is trying to figure out a lie of the cards consistent with the bidding that would let him make his contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: To show spades, West would have to bid 2NT.  The system can at times make your head spin|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And the system is not clever enough to know that South has all the hearts, unfortunately|pg||
nt|roghog: Leader is thrown in, so only 1 down|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It looks like this down one without any endplay|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: he shouldnt have bid so much without the 8 of diamonds (though even then diamond lead & spade back beats it|pg||
nt|pkl: Any comments from anyone are much appreciated |pg||
pc|h3|nt|dima:  Morning all|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: not sure N has enough tempo to find 9th trick |pg||

nt|rodal f: 2 colors to handle here. Belive the @C will be played from N because of the enteryes|pg||

nt|rodal f: A better bid Ralf|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|h bertens: then he wins|pg||

nt|Walddk4: will not be allowed to ...|pg||
nt|milton_se: quite an aggressive double|pg||
mb|d|nt|jstokes: and it's not that easy :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so the 2@S opening shows a profit there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed it isn't|pg||
nt|hedyg: but he will learn quickly :) courage Francois!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not absloutley certain, but I think 2@D=both majors|pg||
nt|roghog: not too tough a test here|pg||
nt|haans: that 2 is weeeeeeeeak|pg||
nt|sybarra: is this (mini) multi?|pg||
nt|haans: can we call it anything?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h bertens: should have taken ace of d|pg||
nt|jcmax: Sementa apparently did very well on board 1 in the other bringing hme 3NT with an overtrick after a @S lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: garbage multi  I am told |pg||
nt|Walddk4: play|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@d first and perhaps a D later to show @c|pg||
nt|dima:  Looks like German pair plays weak NT and 4-card majors ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Same applies for Schollaardt of course|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: Tell his story|pg||
nt|rodal f: E a bit more careful here contra the OR|pg||
nt|pkl: A most sensible rule - and I've heard they will also disallow any players with a 4-letter word last name.|pg||
nt|dima:  So we get some action here|pg||
nt|milton_se: will East be able too keep his spade entrance?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bessi2: it will take a heart lead to beat this it seems|pg||
nt|jstokes: hardly seems fair -- not only are Lauria-Versace two of the world's greatest players, they have a bid for everything |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They will cue 1st and 2nd round controls, so Nunes knows immediately that he is off 2 club losers|pg||
nt|dima:  I dont think so - if South gets a count signal on a herat play he will know hearts are likely to be 4=2=2=5 around the table|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: will make on a diamond lead |pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|haans: spec think suicidal is best|pg||
nt|sybarra: in 3rd seat with this vulnerability |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|milton_se: if not, the 10C will be valuable|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roghog: welcome|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Most top players cue-bid this way.  Cue 1st and 2nd round controls, and use Blackwood to check back whether you are off two aces|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|sybarra: I have some other suggestions which will remain private to me, thanks specs, ! |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like that save action  from W. Trust your partner!|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|jcmax: Very tough for Bocchi here to stay out of game after partner freely bid 1@S. The question is: Did 31H confirm 4 cards in @S?|pg||
nt|haans: common in Norway to play garbage Multi + ordinally weak 2s|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|milton_se: and now?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pkl: I don't know Ralf, depends very much on your defensive style|pg||

nt|milton_se: should go at least one down now|pg||

nt|haans: we had some talk from specs here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Paul,  welcome |pg||
nt|haans: yes Hi Paul|pg||
nt|pkl: A lot of play looks obvious when you can see all four hands. In real life you can only see two.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: oh dear, G****r - don't tell Roland|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my, what is happening here?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H by West, of course...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Francois?|pg||
nt|hedyg: vraiment 4@H par S?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No problems with the aces and kings.  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Not often you see the same contract made by NS and EW on the same hand at this level|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: merci|pg||
nt|bessi2: i wonder what the range of 1N is,  seems strange not to try for slam with east hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: so it was a South African Texas after all, 4@C=@H|pg||
nt|jstokes: I suspect 4@C was Gerber (asking aces) and he found two missing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then it was a good idea to stop. |pg||
nt|bessi2: ahhh.. yes.. i think you're right|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT might well be 13-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|pkl: Personally I often find that to be one to many|pg||
nt|rodal f: No trancfeer|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Lindqvist to blame|pg||
nt|paulg:  is Rekstad older than Lindqvist?|pg||
nt|sybarra: may need some help from defense here|pg||
nt|sybarra: or a spec rightly suggest help from supernatural powers |pg||
pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: I'm guessing, but it's common nowadays with big clubs, that 1@H shows 19+, artificial|pg||
nt|roghog: 2@c some sort of semi-positive after that|pg||
nt|roghog: 1@s is probably the double-negative|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think the defence may already have helped by not doubling|pg||
nt|dima:  At the level of 1NT it does happen :) but you meant another level :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|bjacobs: A spec who seems like he knows what he's talking about says: 1@H could also be hearts, 2@C showed 5-7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another flat board|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mcarroll: a couple of overtrick imps to EW|pg||
nt|milton_se: just then?|pg||
nt|milton_se: ten|pg||
nt|dima:  If NS go passive it will be a push|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: So then 3@C some sort of Stayman|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So in summary ... no one is playing SAYC at this table!!|pg||
nt|roghog: Perhaps we can convert yhem :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: good luck with that ...|pg||
nt|roghog: @c gives the 9th trick, so it's just about overtricks|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|sunsamvar: oops|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oopsing all over the place.  Board 3 ... board 4|pg||
nt|roghog: perhaps we can convert them after all....|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks to all who have told me that Rekstad is over ten years older ... which may explain why he expected more for 1@s|pg||
nt|pkl: It now comes down to the play in clubs. It is one or two losers - if West ducks the jack, East might get a trick on the @C9|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: true!|pg||
nt|dima:  looks like 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sunsamvar: will Nunes find the @S lead ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well this is real ugly if Nunes hits on a spade lead|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: it is between the majors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Active or passive -that's the question|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @H more likely i think|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roghog: difficult - you know partner has very little|pg||
nt|haans: time to remove dummys trumps|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|bjacobs: The fact that partner has only a little probably acts in favour of the heart lead.  Eg partner has @HK, you get an entry with one of your minor queens|pg||

mb|2N|nt|hedyg: 1NT for EW is 14-16|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 10-13, spades, could have a minor ...|pg||
nt|dima:  That is the kind of hand where people bid 3@h to show GF with @h shortness without 4@s|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcmax: I wonder how high Madala is planning to bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  Slam on a 2-2 trump break?|pg||
nt|haans: how many would have bid only 2@S?|pg||
nt|pkl: South has a perfect hand for 4@H. How could North ever know?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Surely S is not thinking of anything except Game over a weak NT?|pg||
nt|dima:  2NT is surely some Multiway something- does anyone know the meaning?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roghog: This is the Fantunes opening that really doesn't look sound|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bjacobs: It's not sound, I suppose, but it puts considerable pressure on the opponents|pg||
nt|roghog: Must gain more than it costs, I guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play constructive raises  so 2 @S for me|pg||
nt|dima:  Rather brave 3@h by Wrang|pg||
nt|milton_se: well, not more than a good D fit and an outside ace will do|pg||
nt|dima:  Now take your money|pg||
mb|d|nt|h bertens: now we know|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: What do you think about 3@c from W instead of 2@s, showing a @c-suit and a 3-card @s support?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd show a limit raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|paulg:  8 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: which states that, in a slam auction, find out how many aces are missing. Subtract that number from eight, and do not bid at the level given by the answer. Also known as the Rule ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: of Eight |pg||
nt|hedyg: great dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: You can see how West might well be guessing over these openings ... the two level openings definitely roll the dice|pg||
nt|dima:  Specs suggest both minors with the follow-up showing shortness (now available per inference)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: STRIK3R: so 2@h would have shown 12+ and @h or 3-7 and @s, think they play it like, that not sure|pg||
nt|paulg:  Easy to say looking at the hand, but 4@h is an imprecise slam try|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I vote for @dQ as a lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would have been the best here buy I belive Q@C is a normal one:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: but|pg||
nt|pkl: The @DQ sets 4@S, but I would also have led the @CQ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|bessi2: i feel east must dbl 2c with that shape at that vulnerability|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

nt|pkl: Anyway - this lead is just as good|pg||
nt|pkl: ... just not anymore - but who can blame East?|pg||
nt|pkl: Ouch - I´m babbling right now|pg||
nt|dima:  I think if you overcall 3@h on those hands partner better watch his steps about raising to 4 level|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|hedyg: i think E remembers that his pd passed 1@s and is lying low|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, it's not THAT different from a weak two, as a lot of people play them.  Just a different point range|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: West might have responded 1NT (if that would be natural)|pg||
nt|bessi2: but they play strong club so pass can have some hcp easily|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: I thought he might upgrade that hand to a 1@S opening ... but no|pg||

nt|rodal f: If @S8 was at N.... Then enteryes enough for use the @D there|pg||

nt|rodal f: N have a auto 4@S now but will W lead @HK?|pg||
nt|pkl: West must play low when South leads a club.|pg||
nt|dima:  Controled stop|pg||
nt|dima:  Without @d lead Wrang will be happy to see @s finesse fail|pg||
nt|milton_se: 6 is only on a finesse, though|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: Francois tells me they play precision|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No swing - they play 3NT in Open|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: well, E was not far off a 2S bid last time. but i am not sure if 3D is a better call than D|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sunsamvar: if the defence does not touch @H they could get it many down|pg||
nt|haans: and B|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 sp asked for singleton I am told |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: very likely W needs something different for a RDBL in their methods|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sunsamvar: lol|pg||
nt|dima:  Well without @d lead it is better then finesse, I think @s AK + @s to the J ...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pkl: ... it doesn't really matter. Always ten tricks, I guess|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: Well it was a good comment - maybe North might have played 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|ritong: or @h A and a @h|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, Henri, he develops a heart ruff that way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, the @HA and another is the way to get 800, as the hearts can be played succesfully with dummy's two entries|pg||
nt|ritong: the difference between 500 and 800 is not huge, imp speaking, with the result other room 2 imps or so|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: True Bill as a hundred specs tell me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yeah, specs can be like that :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but Henri it could mean a 10 imp swing if the Italians were only in game in the other room|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: sry 8 imps|pg||
nt|paulg:  At the club West would have bid, but the Italians like a stronger hand for their 2-suiter overcalls when vulnerable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Here is a classical duck from W when s plays @c towards dummy. otherwise S has 2 discards|pg||
nt|rodal f: If so there are 1 @H and 2@D loosers. Even 10 by a @HK lead. 3 @Ds run |pg||
nt|pkl: Duck and EW has three diamond and one heart trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: one trick to win and 2 to loose. But this time it does not matter|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. The @D8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Sry Did´nt see the @d8 so a duck was essential|pg||
nt|pkl: I first overlooked the @D8, I do not believe that 4@S wins if W ducks the club|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think the italians did anything wrong here ... at this level, you have to disrupt big club auctions|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not 10|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|roghog: Well, if partner is sticking his neck out with 2@s, you risk chopping it off with 3@s, I suppose|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The 3@S bid takes away N/S's 3@D and 3@H bids.  If Nunes didn't have @C10, he would have earned a big swing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sometimes, you just don't know|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: True Bill. Nunes was betting the opps had slam|pg||
nt|roghog: always, in my case|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|bjacobs: Fortunately|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: @S q shd have been ducked i think|pg||
nt|roghog: Still has an entry to play @h from dummy|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: no risks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Tough play here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good play|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but the points are counted out now|pg||
nt|roghog: Well, he's seen KKQ from South|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He might just get it right.  If North had started with A109x, he could play 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and he shd place @Ha with north|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a matter of who has @H9, he knows about @HA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So technically, finessing here is playing for North to make a mistake|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pkl: We all missed it, it seems|pg||

pc|h2|pc|c8|pg||

nt|marlowepi: but i agree that W could have done something over the double. probably not that likely that EW have a game, and there is some danger in getting to a no-play 4H if W bids freely ...|pg||

mb|1C|nt|sunsamvar: lol|pg||
nt|dima:  and here too :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|milton_se: looks like a 2-way club and transfer|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pkl: What to bid as South? How probable is slam with a passed partner?|pg||
nt|dima:  Transfer I suppose , constructive raise from South, no slam interest by West|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: although if west does not cash @hs immediately..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in real life Nunes will probably lead a @C and def will be unable to cash the toppies|pg||
nt|ritong: and why would he|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: all no trumps and red suit games make but club lead defeats slams|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ritong: how so, 1@s?|pg||
nt|roghog: @c lead to 10 and K. What then?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sigurjonsson had problems to fin a pass:) Nice quality|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hedyg: 2@c some relay|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sunsamvar: tough to duck the @Ca on the lead tho|pg||
nt|roghog: very true|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That will beat it, but as Sunil points out, it's quite a defence|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree that the earlier pass by W followed by a last-second 4H looks a bit like a good guess after a self-inflicted endplay. however, if most of the time the E sequence would mean ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4 trumps, then W will have decent play opposite a LOT of hands, even:  xxx  Axxx  xx  xxxx|pg||
nt|lestergold: so lead makes a difference of three tricks here|pg||
nt|paulg:  a bit of work to do here, but will probably lead the @cA from hand at some point and it will get easier|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: 3@s forcing|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: defence may be cashing 5 clubs.. so east cannot duck|pg||
nt|pkl: That 1@H was lead-directing, I presume|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive the same but cost a trick|pg||

pc|h8|nt|hedyg: with a better hand N would have cuebid over 3@s|pg||

nt|bjacobs: This is where the French are at an advantage?  2@H would show 4?|pg||
nt|ritong: it is not really an advantage|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|ritong: yes, 12|pg||
nt|ritong: they played in @ds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Back to 13.  Very unfortunate for the Swedes who OBVIOUSLY knew what they were doing and paid the price|pg||
nt|ritong: ok, 13|pg||
nt|haans: 5nt-7?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: You really should be able to call the match referee and get the imp result adjusted on the board|pg||
nt|ritong: come on|pg||
nt|ritong: there is a gambling part in the game|pg||
nt|bjacobs: nope.  I am offended by this result|pg||
nt|roghog: You should get moral IMPs|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ritong: but they do|pg||
nt|sybarra: obviously @C's are trump to S |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|roghog: So a good but unlucky player could be a Moral Grand Master|pg||
nt|ritong: afterwards, it goes " we did OK, but the b....ds called a dubious grand"|pg||
nt|haans: just playing now?|pg||
nt|pkl: So what to do in clubs? NS in the other room guessed correctly, it seems|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|paulg:  South can hardly be better here, but concerned that partner only has four hearts and there is a pointed loser ... 6@d is a nice bid|pg||
nt|pkl: I can't see any guidance here. What about you? |pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: nowday 5nt to not ask for KING but ask to show a K|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D = @DK|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d3|nt|pkl: There was a suggestion to play for split aces. Split red queens is just as good|pg||
pc|s3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Many often do, but N didn't even go for find out that|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: There was a great article written many years ago called "The Subtractor"|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: taking the sure line|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pkl: Ah... North has some reason to believe that W has @DAce|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well. A puch. Well guessed|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: so, morale is saved (and the italians win)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The Subtractor would adjudicate bad play that earned master points and subtract them accordingly|pg||
nt|pkl: Schollaard missed the chance to make the match break even. ;-)|pg||
nt|rodal f: hehe|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: You could end up as a "Life Potzer"|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d5|nt|paulg:  in this auction 5NT also shows all the controls, so South could bid 7@c directly if he can count 13 tricks|pg||

nt|bjacobs: 4@H is also interesting|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes all very interesting but in real life......|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This IS real life!|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@S is probably about 2 off|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup money in the bank|pg||

mb|4H|nt|hedyg: 3@c puppet|pg||
nt|h bertens: this is very high|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm North worth an invite  but 3N does not look to easy but lead helpful|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bocchi is very high:) madala no|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This would be a top at matchpoints|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S best at E but I belive @H by the long ride is best lead. Or??|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@d= 1 or both 4 vard majors, 3@H=@ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: card*|pg||

nt|roghog: He assumes dummy is cut off|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: never say never|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed,  stupid to say that since I don't know the nuances of their system|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H accepts @cs and denies @d control|pg||
nt|mdgraham: their system is easy - they just bid to the right contract |pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: even with this lead and the clubs favourable there are problems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont have a problem with a 3N bid with all those high spots, and whenever pd is going to accept it can help to have bid it yourself|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You would expect 3@H to have made in the OR ... but the defence was machiavellian|pg||
nt|pkl: Schollaardt might well be correct, but there is only room for ten characters in the name|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: communications not great either|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|marlowepi: opps may defend differently--and to their advantage--if you only invite|pg||
nt|lestergold: I dont really agree the pips make it worth an invite not a unilatreral raise|pg||
nt|h bertens: If you want to bid them this surely is the best way to do it|pg||
nt|haans: in norway you play low enc but low odd count|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s some kind of last train?|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely 4@s implies @d control|pg||
nt|dima:  That is a fight :)|pg||
nt|dima:  I would rather use 4@d overcall to show reds if W opens 2@s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Seems obvious to lead @S, which will force  declarer and control will be a major issue|pg||
nt|dima:  @s shift now?|pg||
nt|dima:  I guess @c card was count so declarer is either 0=6=4=3 or actual shape|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|hedyg: anybody know if they play turbo?|pg||
nt|bessi2: assuming 4c was nat showing 5,  then 5c was somewhat of an underbid|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|bessi2: well if 4h showed 4clubs then maybe not|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: 20/20 hcp division|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: 5@c showed an odd nr of keycards but with @H void...very difficult for Lauria IMO|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|mcarroll: Yep so 3 imps to Bamberg |pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: indeed,  he probably felt he had done more than enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no pressure here from N/S at these colours so an easy ride for E/W|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W almost has enough to try 3H hoping for perfect fitter|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roghog: @C takes the entry, but fortunately there will be another one|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if south ducks and Fantoni knowing the layout continues with a low @D ?|pg||
nt|dima:  We are at the last board of the 1st segment and German team has opened up a very useful lead on a strong set by GromÃ¶ller - HÃ¤usler here|pg||
nt|dima:  I think besides that @d J play on the board N2 they were just about flawless|pg||
nt|dima:  And the score should be 35:7 ....|pg||

mb|p|nt|dima:  A powerful effort for a new partnership as knowing spectators mention|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|bessi2: the dreaded 4-2 fit, but it will handle very well and make easily enough it seems|pg||
nt|hedyg: the lead helped|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
