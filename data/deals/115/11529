nt|bessi2: but i wonder what dbl of 3@h meant.. some play it penalty and pass t/o  or no good bid,  but others play dbl as pure t/o and pass everyting else|pg||
nt|bessi2: i believe the latter is the better approach.. usually you don't get rich dbling opps in their 9+ fits|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think after 2@c they were in forcing mode and X was t/o|pg||
nt|jstokes: In a GF auction, it would be unusual to me to play it as takeout|pg||
nt|jstokes: pass works for Take out|pg||
nt|bessi2: exactly what i mean.. the general approach.. when GF dbl is pen,,, |pg||
nt|bessi2: but that pass becomes so loaded,  it just shows no penalty dbl of hearts.. |pg||
nt|bessi2: and no other convenient bid|pg||
nt|jstokes: and no ability to raise clubs or bid your own suit|pg||
