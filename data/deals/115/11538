nt|Walddk4: from group A|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like a cheap save in 4@s. Let´s see if the sacrifie had been correcy|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make after S has shown a black 2-suiter|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: North is  Magnusson|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|xenya: declarer will know how to handle the diamonds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: depends entirely on @D play|pg||
nt|ybob: run trumps @S to K and @D to dummy = home|pg||
nt|jbgood: difficult not to end up in the favourite contract of them all - 3 NT - but 5@c seems to be better|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: N has 8 top tricks and little chance for a 9th -- so he will run the clubs first in the hope something good happens|pg||
nt|lestergold: he can only play 3 rounds now as he needs one for a second entry to repeat the diamond finesse|pg||
pc|h8|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: seond heart discard may have been dangerous on a different layout|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|kiwibridge: and nowthe bad news|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sunsamvar: putting the screws on east|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: maybe he shd have discarded @Sa from dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: and by declarer as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: frankly i tyhink the dim finesse was the only viable play happened to be wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: on another day an honest palooka makes the contract|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but N must have "felt" the play wouldn't work -- and he was right! |pg||

mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Without the conventional 2@D (whatever it means...), West would have had to choose between false preference to 2@S and 2NT. |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I never understand these long pauses on such an auction. Even if it is a close decision, you are not going to find some new helpful clue by sitting there for ages.|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|brolucius: She, I mean. Perhaps that was better, because it might avoid a ruff when clubs are 4-1.|pg||
nt|h bertens: also problem if north has Kxxx in @S and returns a @D, if you start with ace  and Q of @S|pg||
nt|brolucius: That problem is still alive now.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h bertens: This way you make if king of @S is well placed, 3rd or 4th|pg||
nt|santyclz: Speaking of the pauses, I don't understand them during the play when you haven't learned anything new.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems that Gromova's line is the best available. There was always going to be some sort of risk, playing in a 5-2 fit.|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: W woild love to put in a word, but the vulnerability deters him|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H lead difficult |pg||
nt|Walddk4: In Minsk?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa: yes, here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 4@S is better as it does not need @Sk to be right|pg||
nt|lestergold: this should make tho|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|bessi2: unlucky lead for south here |pg||
pc|h7|nt|ralfwil: only for 6@s a @h lead will defeat|pg||
nt|xenya: @H lead is not impossible to find |pg||
nt|rnmalik: tough decision for E|pg||
nt|xenya: actually it looks quite logical|pg||
nt|ybob: to me impossible|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and BC Quantum comes from?|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|xenya: and there it is|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he found it!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well done|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: tho there is the danger of @C ruff in 4@S|pg||

nt|xenya: 4@S would have issues i think|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|lestergold: natural to play in 3n when all suits stopped and fits only a 7 carder|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ralfwil: After teh @s support I prefer 6@c from N and S has to choose between @s or @c. What´s your opinion?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: even a dim lead would not have beatn 3non this kind layout|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what id @Sk and @Ca were exchanged|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what if|pg||
nt|xenya: S can see his fate -- if he ducks, he will be endplayed eventually... |pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but he can also see that the duck will disrupt declarer's communication|pg||
nt|xenya: now 11 tricks are available|pg||
nt|xenya: true Sunil|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: 6@S a better contract slight misdefend and home.|pg||

nt|ralfwil: After D on 1@s, why not @c from W on 2@c?. Perhaps they could avoid 4@h and perhaps found 3nt |pg||
nt|xenya: correction: declarer can get rid of a @D loser of course, but that doesnt help as he has to use the high @Hs in the dummy for ruffing, losing a trump trick in the end |pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 3NT for NS looks good|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as 16+ and 0-7 for 1@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|ybob: impossible lead small @C from W in 5@D|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C is 15+ i presume|pg||
nt|lestergold: specs asking whether north had a 3c bid|pg||
nt|ahri: nope, they play polish style so 2@c is 15+|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahri: i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: but the only lead that beats 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no problem with clubs 2-2|pg||
nt|lestergold: north certainly cloe to it in conventional methods|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: sure all works well and no @H lead either:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: of course, North doesn't know clubs are 2-2; if he wins @SK and they are 3-1, he can be shut out of dummy  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and if he wins @SA and theya re 3-1, he can be shut out of hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: such a great game :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2H looks like an overbid to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well has to lead ace of hearts or spade to beat!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and not that easy for west if he finds himself on lead her against 3N|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|rodal f: Relays from N now I belive|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: E doubled with @sKQJ9x, and had @d10xx and @cJ in minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 5@D is the best game here, looking at NS's hands|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry private|pg||
nt|lestergold: sadly this has no play|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: for 3 nt ie|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5C looks good|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jbgood: .. to end in 4 spades just making|pg||
nt|bessi2: i believe 1h was either nat or bal hand,  1s waiting 1n 18-19, 2h transfer and so on|pg||
nt|sfoxa: or just plain transfer with nat bidding?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5C as always cold|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n maybe 4H no play 5c cold and of course they play in the  no play spot!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont know th intricacies of their system, but since 2H on the face of it looks awful i am assuming they have treatments we dont know about|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sfoxa: anyway, game is here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: only treatment here is surgery im afraid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S has to bid over 2C, i would think 3C was the least distortion.|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you Chemla would have not been a happy sapper if his double catapulted them into 5C which it might well have done|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't see why N was S persistent about @Hs -- 3@H is OK perhaps, but why not bid 4@C next?|pg||
nt|xenya: so, not S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jbgood: OR has reached brd   10...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but they are 2-2. Sigh of relief. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes well done |pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|nt|marlowepi: chemla had two aces and was not terribly worried about 5C. both aces will score against that too so worst case scenaio is a few IMPs away.  and after that auction chances of them ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: running to clubs have to be at least 50-1 against, maybe much higher. both opps bid hearts TWICE|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the double was a warning|pg||
nt|xenya: Chemla is not in the habit of doubling lightly?|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|lestergold: do you double for an extra 50 hen you risk tem bidding to a makeable game?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Told from spec: 1@H relay - 1@S forced - 2@H trancfer - 3@C natural. Thx gunnark|pg||

mb|3S!|an|splinter|nt|brolucius: North is too good for 2@D or 3@D. He has chosen a splinter bid rather than a cue-bid in one of the E/W suits.|pg||
nt|h bertens: hard to ave I think|pg||
nt|h bertens: save|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps East will risk 4@S now.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: A bit light, facing a passed hand, but a double does not get the job done. Oh, East has passed.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S certainly looks right now, to me.|pg||
nt|h bertens: one more chance to reach my "normal" 4@S....:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe the splinter bid has worried her, imagining that South may hold four spades.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|santyclz: If she bids it, a x seems more likely than a sac.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|h bertens: bridge is just to difficult|pg||
nt|brolucius: Gromova has done well. It would have been awful to sell out to 4@D when you had a vulnerable game on a finesse that was marked by the bidding.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not surprisingly, Chemla made the 4@H where West here decided to throw a spade (instead of a diamond) on the @CK.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|h bertens: and he ducked the Q of @D lead...|pg||

nt|lestergold: wll what a posiiton neck und neck with all on the next board|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what a match!!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: average of over 6 IMPs per board scored so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa: giving a loosing choice|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last board already.|pg||
nt|sfoxa: actually, there are no choice, but each attempt is worth :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and this likely to be a push |pg||
mb|1C|nt|sunsamvar: this may not brek the tie|pg||
mb|1D|nt|xenya: and the last board now|pg||
nt|lestergold: unlikley too|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: game could be missed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E may bid 2S|pg||
nt|lestergold: ait a minute it will probably brak the tie|pg||
nt|lestergold: by1 imp|pg||
nt|lestergold: north on lead surely wil cash three hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and if NS save the match wont be a tie|pg||
nt|lestergold: in open east played the hand|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sfoxa: 3nt ot 4 in major? in which one?|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: Avalanche is booked to in by an imp|pg||
mb|4C|nt|marlowepi: by more than that|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: and so to the last board of this match, thx to Elisabeth a great job on the vugraph, Haans and Mike for their great commentary, Roland and BBO for allowing us to share and to all ...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: you great spectators thank you|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: going for a svae here|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: and this quick set  will finish with 4@h just making|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks tp France for giving us some great bridge, a good match|pg||
nt|lestergold: a save yes even more|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: as i said, EW may not even get to 4S|pg||
nt|lestergold: east wont let them play 4d|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: oh my not even gerdoubled|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: who is saving ?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: can make 12 |pg||
nt|jbgood: guess he will take the double finesse in spades|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|xenya: if he guesses to pin the @H10|pg||
nt|ritong: noone|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well not many dull moments im exhausted|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i expect the players are everyone is|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d5|pc|s2|nt|xenya: but this is not matchpoints, so safety comes first|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|ybob: thx all|pg||
nt|sfoxa: with the odds, actually|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think lack of double is not surprising at all. W cannot double, and E knows S has stiff club--meanwhile he has already invited game and W said no. N may be void of spades too. so ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why double for down 1, as a fellow commentator recently said|pg||
nt|lestergold: what a battle this was|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d2|mc|10|nt|lestergold: thk you Marshall that was me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: as you well kinow|pg||
nt|ritong: marshall is short memored|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only explaining E line of thought|pg||
