mb|2S|nt|jcmax: in any event -500 is way better than -800|pg||
nt|roghog: another fascinating idea|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@S is an enquiry, not showing spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|hedyg: this cannot be right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless Versace is in 5@Hx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double probably prepares for showing a value raise to 3H|pg||
nt|jcmax: Bocchi doubles 2@S here because his hand is not all about hearts. he has some constructive values and all of them outside hearts. Bidding 3@H would show a different kind of hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sabine said it better:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: no, I just used more words :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: people seldom outbid me in THAT respect:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: male and female?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what on earth is going on here? |pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2NT denied a minor, hence 6+ hearts|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: 2@s weak 1suiter . 5+ cards|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bessi2: that makes no sense either|pg||
nt|jstokes: better but still seems unlikely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon West bid 4@S and South 5@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then double by West|pg||
nt|bessi2: yep,  that seems plausible|pg||
nt|marlowepi: do i get to choose?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Once again, e-w's 9 card club fit was undisclosed.|pg||
nt|jcmax: It seems like declarer has to lose 11S, 2@H and 2@D tricks. Making this contract would be tough|pg||
nt|santyclz: Who cares about @cs.|pg||
nt|santyclz: See you later folks, I've been re-assigned.|pg||
nt|jcmax: see you|pg||
nt|marlowepi: see you Joe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: send a  postcard|pg||
nt|jcmax: Maala is trying to figure out a lie of the cards consistent with the bidding that would let him make his contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: To show spades, West would have to bid 2NT.  The system can at times make your head spin|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And the system is not clever enough to know that South has all the hearts, unfortunately|pg||
nt|roghog: Leader is thrown in, so only 1 down|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||

nt|roghog: 1@s is probably the double-negative|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: A spec who seems like he knows what he's talking about says: 1@H could also be hearts, 2@C showed 5-7|pg||

nt|roghog: Perhaps we can convert yhem :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: good luck with that ...|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Actually, the @HA and another is the way to get 800, as the hearts can be played succesfully with dummy's two entries|pg||
nt|ritong: the difference between 500 and 800 is not huge, imp speaking, with the result other room 2 imps or so|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: True Bill as a hundred specs tell me|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yeah, specs can be like that :)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but Henri it could mean a 10 imp swing if the Italians were only in game in the other room|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: sry 8 imps|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bjacobs: I don't think the italians did anything wrong here ... at this level, you have to disrupt big club auctions|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: not 10|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|roghog: Well, if partner is sticking his neck out with 2@s, you risk chopping it off with 3@s, I suppose|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The 3@S bid takes away N/S's 3@D and 3@H bids.  If Nunes didn't have @C10, he would have earned a big swing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sometimes, you just don't know|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: True Bill. Nunes was betting the opps had slam|pg||

nt|bjacobs: He might just get it right.  If North had started with A109x, he could play 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and he shd place @Ha with north|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a matter of who has @H9, he knows about @HA|pg||

mb|4D|nt|marlowepi: wonder why D instead of 3D by E|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|marlowepi: maybe 3D would confirm clubs and be a NT try|pg||

nt|bessi2: but i wonder what dbl of 3@h meant.. some play it penalty and pass t/o  or no good bid,  but others play dbl as pure t/o and pass everyting else|pg||

nt|hedyg: i think after 2@c they were in forcing mode and X was t/o|pg||
nt|jstokes: In a GF auction, it would be unusual to me to play it as takeout|pg||
nt|jstokes: pass works for Take out|pg||
nt|bessi2: exactly what i mean.. the general approach.. when GF dbl is pen,,, |pg||
nt|bessi2: but that pass becomes so loaded,  it just shows no penalty dbl of hearts.. |pg||
nt|bessi2: and no other convenient bid|pg||
nt|jstokes: and no ability to raise clubs or bid your own suit|pg||

nt|lestergold: what dos 3d mean here?|pg||
nt|h bertens: i think @C|pg||
nt|h bertens: thats how we play it|pg||
nt|lestergold: a simple soul like me finds all these bids confusing |pg||

nt|h bertens: me to, ask my partner :)|pg||
nt|h bertens: now 4@C shows good hand for @C and @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: well as long as they reach 4S all will end well|pg||
nt|lestergold: is Bochi in tank here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry mis-spell Bocchi|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hmm, here's another hand that seems to threaten a defensive squeeze|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: last making game rapidly approaching|pg||
nt|h bertens: madala looking for best game, Bocchi for best slam...|pg||
nt|lestergold: no best game only one game making|pg||
nt|ritong: it also threatens to land in 3 NT down with a cold 5/6 @cs, from nystrom's point of view|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Incredibly tricky hand on @SQ lead|pg||
nt|ritong: i therefore wonder why he did not decide to go for game and propose his @cs|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: Has to win in North|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then if a club is ducked - how do you unentangle things?|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe 3@h has a conventional sense|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer doesn't know clubs are 2-2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So here GIB is really giving unrealistic advice|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Specs want declarer to take 2 diamonds, his 8th and 9th tricks - pray, what do you discard on the second diamond?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's what I was thinking of when I mentioned a squeeze on declarer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What a hand!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems so logical to retain @SK as an entry to the clubs, but ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sorry  I can't respond to all the specs.  |pg||

pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|hedyg: 2@c= gazzilli, 2@d= 8+ hcps, 3@D= 3@s + 4 m, 3@H relay, 3NT= 3 5 1 4|pg||

nt|lestergold: well he had better subside if he wants a plus score|pg||

nt|lestergold: why when he knows his pard is limitd to 19 balanced i do not know|pg||

nt|marlowepi: maybe a 10% slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: u measn not even good enuf for roland|pg||
nt|h bertens: its a good slam with the EW hands reversed :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only with @sKJ in front will make|pg||
nt|lestergold: i see no merit in Madala's 4D bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: its like handing ammunition to John Wayne|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: director called again other side of the rooom|pg||

nt|roghog: strange how the duck now causes such a tangle|pg||
nt|ritong: just joking, claudio has to duck this|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|bessi2: the rule here in iceland concerning closed room play and smokers is that it is ok  until 30 min left on the clock then not allowed to leave unless finished|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think smokers can smoke anywhere they like, as long as it is inside a sealed plastic bag  |pg||
nt|hedyg: the wbf demands that all competitions be nonsmoking, also in France all public places are nonsmoking by law|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Ends quietly but there were several wonderful boards in that set|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: one thing worth noting - in twenty boards, the Italians have conceded only one major swing, and it took a slightly abnormal opening (2@S on a five-card suit) to generate it  |pg||
nt|hedyg: but really a lousy slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they are really hard to beat at the table|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 19 will be a swing too?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: If E had playes one more @s N is squeezed to discard a @h and after that a @dQ from the hand N must win and exit with what?|pg||

pc|h4|nt|bessi2: amen,  i thought 1N was limited and he would surely bid 4h there not 6|pg||
