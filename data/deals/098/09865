mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: S will bid game|pg||
nt|jbgood: S will at least invite in one way or other|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if he does, the @HK lead could prove unfortunate|pg||
nt|sharkey: W may fight with 4 NT - showing minors|pg||

nt|sharkey: Strange game - in CR N fails to bid and miss game; in OR N bids and forces EW into a makeable(?) game...|pg||
nt|jbgood: will not the 3-1 club break cause problems here?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: not 11 sure tricks - with @C-3-1 u cant win by setting up the @H-suit|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: South might steer clear of a diamond lead - he knows West has length there|pg||

nt|lestergold: not  a bad 6 actually|pg||
nt|lestergold: cold played by south whenever there is no club lead ot club k onside|pg||
nt|chthonic: Getting to six would be a bit much, but it is a swing opportunity|pg||
nt|lestergold: well trhey had a strong 9 card fiut 29 combinde d points and excellent controls not that far fetched|pg||
nt|star6ija: fine, we will try to make something , thanks a lot |pg||
nt|col3435: there may be people around, it's not as busy with vugraphs as it was earlier|pg||
nt|star6ija: 9 IMPs sry|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@d from Nort's hand|pg||
nt|tomi2: 400 is always a good start into a teams tournament|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this is "Danish"  as it is a movement in teams where  1 plays  2 |pg||
nt|vugraphb1: bad connection, sry all|pg||
nt|tomi2: but why do they play so early in the morning. Is Bulgaria in the same time zone as middle europe?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, 1 hour ahead|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 9:41 in Sofia|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, that is a little bit better :)|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: yes, 9.41 is here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: well a bit of a misfit hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s have a normal spade part score|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@h can not be made even if W misses @C lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@s is a good sacrifice even against game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: but hard to  reach!|pg||
nt|chthonic: That overcall may have a negative result, since NS would surely be playing spades absent the bid|pg||
nt|Walddk5: But it's still in the middle of the night as far as I'm concerned|pg||
nt|tomi2: am no big fan of transfer overcalls after strong club|pg||
nt|Walddk5: There should be a law against playing at this hour|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: a reopening double would have been interesting and pehaps a rather better bid|pg||
nt|star6ija: dokolkoto vijdam njamame komentatori|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6te opitam da buda polezen za analizite|pg||
nt|tomi2: you give your opponents a pass, a double, a cuebid and passing and later bidding/cuebidding|pg||
pc|sA|nt|star6ija: nice job from EW|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|chthonic: This board will not create a swing of any consequence.|pg||

nt|chthonic: oops.  A transfer misinterpreted.???|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|star6ija: I will try to catch someone, thanks for advice :)|pg||

pc|sK|nt|col3435: oh|pg||
nt|col3435: it does help that it's North's lead :)|pg||

nt|chthonic: This is not a good start for north south|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is not an overtstament Craig|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|chthonic: Partnership discussions need to include unlikely auctions as well as the normal ones.|pg||

nt|sharkey: I understand 4@S too - pd's under the gun VUL and the bonus is so significant you tend to stretch. |pg||
nt|jbgood: nonvul it may be 5-3-3-2, vuln he would have to have a 4+ card side minor|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H shows @H and a minor under opening?|pg||

nt|lestergold: part score limit here for both sides e/w minors n/s spades |pg||
nt|chthonic: I would.  How are you ever going to show this otherwise?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would pass and michaelsd at first opportunity|pg||
nt|lestergold: well whatever the redouible was not inmtended to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: very dangerous to use this bid when meaning may not be clear to pard|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chthonic: three 4333 hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: has its dangers b ut we are at favourable vulnerability i would not want to mislead my partne into the belief that ighad any defensive values|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: maybe who gets to 1 nt first |pg||

mb|p|nt|chthonic: Sure, not enough defense... |pg||
nt|lestergold: ah should show two suiter immediately|pg||

nt|chthonic: And I am strong for sound openers... But this one I would make an exception for.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: 120?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|col3435: well|pg||
nt|star6ija: 11 is double dummy of course|pg||
nt|tomi2: but I don't know why E did not enter the bidding?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I am surprised that East passed over an 11-14 1NT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: now this way north knows|pg||
nt|lestergold: his hand is not pullinmg a lot of defensive weight|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you 5c is off|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3d is an atrocious bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: and facing an passed opp! he can not run in that much of trouble|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|star6ija: now @DAce @d ruff|pg||
nt|star6ija: @C to the King @druff|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: his pardners bid over the double is clearly weak|pg||
nt|star6ija: izvinjavam se na vsi4ki bulgari, no 6te smenja malko ezika za6toto imame dosta gosti|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: looks like it |pg||
nt|lestergold: makes on any defence other than spade followed by heart switch assuming declarer picks the club|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: on best defence|pg||
nt|chthonic: It would -- or will -- be interesting to see the effect on EW of an opening bid.  Whether there is sufficient competition to bid 5C|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to sit tight with this misfitting evenly divided hand ifpard cant bid again then must defnd 2s|pg||
nt|tomi2: he preferes to be endplayed in the opening lead maybe :)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|star6ija: @c to the Queen @s to the Ace and another @s for throw-in|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: now north judged wisely or not to pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially at unfavourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|star6ija: Most probably Danailov will try to cash 3 @h now|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|col3435: west would love partner to double of course, but that seems a lot to hope for|pg||
nt|lestergold: For benefit of specs i do not know any of these players|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps I should|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: but i am commentating on the bridge as i find it played|pg||
nt|tomi2: West should duck this|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|tomi2: but I guess the result here will not change the score on the board since I expect other room will score -600 or -630|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: south's five spade bid was incorrect- he had no reason to contradict his partner's suggestion that they defend|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: had he showed his weak two suiter then he would have not placed himself in this position partner would kbnow exactly what he had|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|col3435: so perhaps it would have been advisable to bid 3NT|pg||

nt|tomi2: West had the options of playing a spade through and giving a heart ruff after his partner underlead his @C ace. I think E should signal his intent with the card he plays. Leading a ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: low coub = heart ruff and a high one, as the 5 was imo, ="play a spade first"|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: overboard I wonder?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|chthonic: Could have problems on a club lead...?  |pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi everyone :) good morning|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: is there a "right" way to play that @D holding |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure |pg||
nt|chthonic: Can they find first nine tricks?.... Probably|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tomi2: as a spec points out, this looks like a gazilli auction|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: 3n more chance than 4s because of the 4333 mirror|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|lestergold: however i can see 3 spades 3 hearts a club and a dim where is the ninth coming from?|pg||
nt|tomi2: allowes them to stay in partscore with that non fitting hands, but not in 2@D, since that would show "any 8+ hand"|pg||
pc|c3|nt|MolvaM: friendly distribution but declarer has to manage the spade suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: mind you if they get it right its only4 off for 400|pg||
pc|cT|nt|star6ija: this is mistake from N|pg||
nt|lestergold: and north /south may well develop 2 long hearts along with the spade and the 2 clubs in the rqce in any case|pg||
nt|star6ija: this ruff with the @D Jack looks very starnge|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

nt|chthonic: Nice|pg||
nt|lestergold: should have made a raise showing defensive values so that east would know not to push to the five level|pg||
nt|chthonic: Al Roth would turn over in his grave... to open that 1S.|pg||
nt|lestergold: an unassuming cue bid raise with his 12 count for example|pg||
nt|MolvaM: open room didnt find the S hand worth opening|pg||
nt|ritong: on board 2, he overcalled for the single reason that he held 13 cards|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes but its kind of strange to me that they on't let the team play that was so well in last years Europeans|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: this bidding must surely be wrong or for the next hand more likely??|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|chthonic: But it has/had preemptive value|pg||

nt|tomi2: Bulgaria finished 4th as far as I remember and so qualified for the Bermuda Bowl this year in Brazil|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: And on board 4, where 1NT was set three vulnerable tricks, North in the other room overcalled 2C... P P P.|pg||
nt|chthonic: So there will be another swing.|pg||

nt|chessmaste: North should overcall now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: slam makes but I dont think they will bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: OR room even made 12 tricks missing 3 acres in that hand where E passed all the time, so first huge swing now for N/S, "A-SRR"|pg||
nt|ritong: or 1NT, for that matter|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: as i guessed ahead of yourself|pg||
mb|d|nt|chthonic: It played from the other side  -- south -- in the other room and on a heart lead, only going up ace from dummy retains the tempo.... very tough, indeed.|pg||

nt|chthonic: OK, this hand...|pg||
