nt|Walddk6: This is the last board of the match. Many thanks again to Martin Stoszek, our very capable operator in Bonn. Well done!|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk6: Finally, our appreciation to the DBV (German Bridge Federation) for bringing this prestigious event to BBO vugraph. Josef Harsanyi, Matthias Schüller and Peter Eidt have been ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: yes a good old fashioned bid|pg||
nt|papa hall: For those of you not familiar with Swedish geography....2@H is called Askeröd...named after a little town in southern Sweden|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many time a overcall at level 1 is more effective that a preemptive at 3 level|pg||
nt|bt: 2N was conservative?|pg||
nt|magnus_e: on board 14 Törnqvist in other room showed 13+ with norhs hand. It led to 4@s. Good evaluation. |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: South didnt think north could have the @H suit|pg||
