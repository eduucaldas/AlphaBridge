nt|lestergold: not  a bad 6 actually|pg||
nt|lestergold: cold played by south whenever there is no club lead ot club k onside|pg||
nt|chthonic: Getting to six would be a bit much, but it is a swing opportunity|pg||
nt|lestergold: well trhey had a strong 9 card fiut 29 combinde d points and excellent controls not that far fetched|pg||
nt|star6ija: fine, we will try to make something , thanks a lot |pg||
nt|col3435: there may be people around, it's not as busy with vugraphs as it was earlier|pg||
nt|star6ija: 9 IMPs sry|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@d from Nort's hand|pg||
nt|tomi2: 400 is always a good start into a teams tournament|pg||
nt|santyclz: On the nose.  |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this is "Danish"  as it is a movement in teams where  1 plays  2 |pg||
nt|vugraphb1: bad connection, sry all|pg||
nt|tomi2: but why do they play so early in the morning. Is Bulgaria in the same time zone as middle europe?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, 1 hour ahead|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 9:41 in Sofia|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, that is a little bit better :)|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: yes, 9.41 is here|pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@S for EW looks like a struggle here if NS get the Hearts going soon enough|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lestergold: well a bit of a misfit hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s have a normal spade part score|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@h can not be made even if W misses @C lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@s is a good sacrifice even against game|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like 4@s has some play here and things are sitting pretty well for it.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: but hard to  reach!|pg||
nt|chthonic: That overcall may have a negative result, since NS would surely be playing spades absent the bid|pg||
nt|Walddk5: But it's still in the middle of the night as far as I'm concerned|pg||
nt|tomi2: am no big fan of transfer overcalls after strong club|pg||
nt|Walddk5: There should be a law against playing at this hour|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a reopening double would have been interesting and pehaps a rather better bid|pg||
nt|star6ija: dokolkoto vijdam njamame komentatori|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6te opitam da buda polezen za analizite|pg||
nt|tomi2: you give your opponents a pass, a double, a cuebid and passing and later bidding/cuebidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: nice job from EW|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Patricia Anderson|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fifee: thank you, Roland|pg||
nt|oliverc:  Morning Patricia|pg||
nt|fifee: hello Oliver :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Presumably a smolen variant, showing a game force with 4@h and 5@s.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|chthonic: This board will not create a swing of any consequence.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: 2h is that natural?|pg||
nt|chthonic: oops.  A transfer misinterpreted.???|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm told "presumably" was an underbid.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|star6ija: I will try to catch someone, thanks for advice :)|pg||
nt|col3435: south has a nasty hand to lead from here|pg||
nt|star6ija: sistemata e datska|pg||
pc|s2|nt|col3435: oh|pg||
nt|col3435: it does help that it's North's lead :)|pg||
nt|col3435: so declarer does have a guess to make here|pg||
nt|col3435: in trumps|pg||
nt|col3435: and I don't see any reason to get it right|pg||

nt|oliverc: This looks off now unless Declarer can get the Spades right|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chthonic: small|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s by north could hardly be misinterpreted|pg||
nt|chthonic: This is not a good start for north south|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is not an overtstament Craig|pg||
nt|oliverc: yup|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chthonic: Partnership discussions need to include unlikely auctions as well as the normal ones.|pg||

nt|santyclz: Note that s lead high from a doubleton.  That's not automatic in this part of the world.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chthonic: Are systems on after a balancing 1N?)  Does that include transfers into the overcalled suit?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|sK|pc|c6|pg||

nt|chthonic: DIscuss and agree|pg||

nt|oliverc: Declarer unsurprisingly gave himself a chance to catch either defender with Jxxx|pg||
nt|oliverc: rather than South with J10xx|pg||

nt|chthonic: I would.  How are you ever going to show this otherwise?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would pass and michaelsd at first opportunity|pg||

nt|fifee: west will get excited to hear @Cs from his pd|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: has its dangers b ut we are at favourable vulnerability i would not want to mislead my partne into the belief that ighad any defensive values|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: maybe who gets to 1 nt first |pg||
nt|lestergold: well im in time to witness the bidding and play of another not well fitting set of handfs|pg||

nt|tomi2: I assume both pairs play some strong club system? that is quite common in Bulgaria|pg||
nt|santyclz: X, @ds or support?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now 2n|pg||
nt|oliverc: Shouldn't be too hard to get everything right in the play either|pg||
nt|fifee: I don't know how you can avoid 2 losers but its only 6am here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Sure, not enough defense... |pg||
nt|lestergold: ah should show two suiter immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: haqppened to have hit the right suit|pg||
nt|chthonic: And I am strong for sound openers... But this one I would make an exception for.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chthonic: 120?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|col3435: well|pg||
nt|star6ija: 11 is double dummy of course|pg||
nt|tomi2: but I don't know why E did not enter the bidding?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I am surprised that East passed over an 11-14 1NT|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: now this way north knows|pg||
nt|lestergold: his hand is not pullinmg a lot of defensive weight|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you 5c is off|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3d is an atrocious bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: and facing an passed opp! he can not run in that much of trouble|pg||
pc|d9|nt|star6ija: now @DAce @d ruff|pg||
nt|star6ija: @C to the King @druff|pg||
nt|oliverc: No, you're right, always 2 losers|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: his pardners bid over the double is clearly weak|pg||

nt|fifee: phew :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: Only on my first coffee here :)|pg||
nt|fifee: having a spot of tea ;)|pg||
nt|othered1: slam is about good enough, if you can find it.  But 4@S may have gotten in the way|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: looks like it |pg||
nt|lestergold: makes on any defence other than spade followed by heart switch assuming declarer picks the club|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|lestergold: on best defence|pg||
nt|chthonic: It would -- or will -- be interesting to see the effect on EW of an opening bid.  Whether there is sufficient competition to bid 5C|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to sit tight with this misfitting evenly divided hand ifpard cant bid again then must defnd 2s|pg||
nt|tomi2: he preferes to be endplayed in the opening lead maybe :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|star6ija: @c to the Queen @s to the Ace and another @s for throw-in|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: now north judged wisely or not to pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially at unfavourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|star6ija: Most probably Danailov will try to cash 3 @h now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|col3435: west would love partner to double of course, but that seems a lot to hope for|pg||
nt|lestergold: For benefit of specs i do not know any of these players|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps I should|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i am commentating on the bridge as i find it played|pg||
nt|tomi2: West should duck this|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h4|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|tomi2: but I guess the result here will not change the score on the board since I expect other room will score -600 or -630|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s4|nt|lestergold: south's five spade bid was incorrect- he had no reason to contradict his partner's suggestion that they defend|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: had he showed his weak two suiter then he would have not placed himself in this position partner would kbnow exactly what he had|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|col3435: so perhaps it would have been advisable to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|fifee: The Bulgarians have some great players. Do we have a website for this event?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|col3435: partner doesn't have much but it still makes|pg||

nt|tomi2: West had the options of playing a spade through and giving a heart ruff after his partner underlead his @C ace. I think E should signal his intent with the card he plays. Leading a ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: low coub = heart ruff and a high one, as the 5 was imo, ="play a spade first"|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: overboard I wonder?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chthonic: Could have problems on a club lead...?  |pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi everyone :) good morning|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|sybarra: is there a "right" way to play that @D holding |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure |pg||
nt|chthonic: Can they find first nine tricks?.... Probably|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tomi2: as a spec points out, this looks like a gazilli auction|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: 3n more chance than 4s because of the 4333 mirror|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: however i can see 3 spades 3 hearts a club and a dim where is the ninth coming from?|pg||
nt|tomi2: allowes them to stay in partscore with that non fitting hands, but not in 2@D, since that would show "any 8+ hand"|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|MolvaM: friendly distribution but declarer has to manage the spade suit|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: mind you if they get it right its only4 off for 400|pg||
pc|c3|nt|star6ija: this is mistake from N|pg||
nt|lestergold: and north /south may well develop 2 long hearts along with the spade and the 2 clubs in the rqce in any case|pg||
nt|star6ija: this ruff with the @D Jack looks very starnge|pg||
nt|oliverc: no fairytale here, then|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||

pc|d3|pg||

nt|chthonic: That last hand was worthy of further study.|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard tovreach the thin spade game so probably a good enuf result|pg||

nt|col3435: this looks dull, maybe even a passout ... do they pass out hands around here?|pg||
nt|col3435: certainly if it gets round to West|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if u give up a trump trick in the process|pg||
nt|jaheim: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needed to lead a low @c rather than the q.|pg||
nt|othered1: EW have game in either red suit here|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D|nt|chthonic: Lots of action on board 2.... East preempted 3C, and NS are in 4S X..... so the 3H "disaster" is going to be a pickup....|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s may well bid to game on their combined 25 points buty i cant see anything making|pg||
nt|lestergold: plenty of swingy hands|pg||
nt|MolvaM: quiet boards.  good for the leading teams|pg||
nt|othered1: A little short on high card points, but pointcount doesn't evaluate playing hands like east's very well|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: hallo tomi|pg||

nt|MolvaM: esp at this vul|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: interesting 2 @C |pg||
nt|chthonic: I don't like that bid.  Let them get to 3NT and cash five tricks...|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard leads wrong and you are never in |pg||
nt|sybarra: and they cash 7 or 8 minor |pg||
nt|chthonic: Good point..... |pg||
nt|col3435: ah, good, East has found something in his cards|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer has to locate the @sJ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but will probably make even if he cant|pg||
nt|moen: yes|pg||
nt|santyclz: One of the under appreciated benefits of a strong @c system is the ability to make a reverse on a hand like this.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: kq doubleton lub not pulling its full weight|pg||
nt|star6ija: EW are not original partners, but probably Nanev assumed that Ivanchev had @Ds|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chthonic: No games make NS on this one. |pg||
nt|lestergold: but they aqre surely headed for 3N now|pg||
nt|chthonic: NS might get too high.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n is off on any half sensible defence|pg||
pc|s3|nt|santyclz: West's red honors have become golden.|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes.  It lets you get your suits into the auction in length order.  But there are other gadgets for hands like that (like a nonforcing jump reverse I used to play)|pg||
nt|othered1: But I'd reverse this hand in standard as well.  Sound 4-loser, pure hand can be bid up a bit.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h2|nt|col3435: mind you, it looks like he'll regret it|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|fifee: easier if declarer gets the @D lead and ruff|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: only a dim part score and i cant see them resting in one|pg||
nt|lestergold: will i think need help from defence to make thisone- wit the diamonds behaving badly and the club k waste paper i can see only 6 tricks and that is only becfause of the lucky heart ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: position|pg||
nt|star6ija: I am sure that he plays this convention with his original partner|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chthonic: Especially if I were on lead...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: Looks like there was some system confusion here.  4@D, nonforcing, seems misguided|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|santyclz: All for naught.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|MolvaM: now the club guess|pg||
nt|santyclz: West doesn't seem to have appreciated the value of his red honors opposite a 5/6+.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chthonic: West, that is|pg||
nt|chthonic: Have to lose three spades and a club in this contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s might have a play if the spades were 3/3 but as it is 4 top losers|pg||
nt|MolvaM: interesting 2nt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but karakolev didnt have many good alternative bids I guess|pg||
nt|jaheim: y  needs to play j of@D now|pg||
nt|jaheim: but almost impossible|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the 2nt bid might make that difficult now for ivanchev|pg||
nt|jaheim: right|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if west thought 3@D forced to game (a style some play, with 2N starting less good hands)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|lestergold: and when are the defence going to find a club switch? the pips are such that theycan cash 5 clubs without pausing for breath|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|MolvaM: wd|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jaheim: wow|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: north can read west now for kq hearts and ace clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: for his double|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: will probably be a flattish board may even gain because n/s could well be 3n-2 i nthe open oom|pg||
nt|star6ija: Aronov and Stefanov are reigning champions of Europe, this board should not be problem for each of them|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm|pg||

nt|MolvaM: the 2nt bid did the damage after all|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|MolvaM: nanev assumed karakolev had the 4th diamond|pg||

nt|oliverc: definitely. brb :)|pg||
nt|othered1: It's really tough, without detailed system notes, to assign blame on the last hand.  But you should be in game at any vul.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|chthonic: So, there was no swing on board 1, where NS could make slam on favorable card placement, but on the second board a problem arose in both rooms NS.  The worse of the two disasters ...|pg||
nt|chthonic: occurred in the other room after a preempt.  It looked like a misunderstanding in this room would have been the problem, but it paled in comparison.  |pg||
nt|lestergold: 2slooks limit for n/s but e/w can probably make 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2@h anyone?|pg||
nt|ritong: they might play different system according to the vulnerability|pg||

nt|MolvaM: cards lie well for 3@h also|pg||
nt|fifee: headed to 3NT, cards lying favorably this time :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: yes, playing 11-13 NT is more effective non vuln|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chthonic: Oh, I misread the auction|pg||
nt|ritong: and here, also, balancing with a double holding @s KJ makes few sense, since pard can hardly have a penalty doiouble for @ss|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|MolvaM: 2@h opening might have stopped NS to find their game|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Dimitar Kapitanski|pg||
nt|othered1: There are many ways to handle west's hand -- subject to your agreements.  Stayman, bailing out in 2M, is one, if available as here.|pg||
nt|othered1: Some play 2@S invitational on this auction, but EW apparantly don't, since west's hand is really pushy for an invite|pg||

mb|1S|nt|lestergold: this bidding must surely be wrong or for the next hand more likely??|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3S|nt|chthonic: But it has/had preemptive value|pg||
nt|lestergold: ??|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it is important to play 3NT from east but declarer still has 8 tricks unless south leads a heart|pg||
nt|tomi2: Bulgaria finished 4th as far as I remember and so qualified for the Bermuda Bowl this year in Brazil|pg||
mb|4C|nt|chthonic: And on board 4, where 1NT was set three vulnerable tricks, North in the other room overcalled 2C... P P P.|pg||
nt|chthonic: So there will be another swing.|pg||
nt|lestergold: again west does not want to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it ahappens 4h should not make on best defence|pg||
nt|chthonic: That one adverse to our NS team|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west has a clear cut bid of 3h|pg||
nt|chthonic: No... adverse to our EW team.  Sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: now north opens and east cant bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: In Germany teams who achieve such qualification are always allowed to play the event they qualified for|pg||
nt|santyclz: If any hand deserved upgrading for spots, west's certainly qualifies.|pg||
nt|othered1: Not easy to  find @S at a low level here|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|chthonic: Board 5, that is.|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|MolvaM: 3@d nice spot|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'd rate w's hand at about 17.5 points, wonder what k&r say?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|MolvaM: declarer will duck a heart to see if something good happens.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: still has to find the @cq|pg||
nt|tomi2: so since the players are always improving their score, there have been no trials for 6 years now. Only from time to time a pair or one player has been replaced.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|MolvaM: but finally resort to the @HK finesse|pg||
nt|jaheim: y   3 imps to ns|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|MolvaM: aggressive lead|pg||
nt|moen: well that was a friendly lead|pg||
nt|ritong: are you aware about rumen/kalin system, dimi? we are not sure about the reasons they open 1@c or 1@d|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would call it unfair, if our national team, who played that well last year, would have to play trials and then maybe loses n a bad day and may not play Bermuda Bowl|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodal f: Have a easy one for 660 and plat. NEXT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or 12?|pg||
nt|othered1: Even playing a big @C system, some pairs don't upgrade.  There are some old Hamman-Wolff hands where a light Blue Club opening got them too high.|pg||

nt|sybarra: thx as always to our wonderful operator |pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course,  thx to Craig Hemphill my co commentator |pg||
nt|chthonic: I nominate board 4 as the hand of this segment.  A difficult but makeable 3NT contract, down two in one room, three in the other, vulnerable.  |pg||
nt|chthonic: Thanks, Shirley, a pleasure.|pg||
nt|sybarra: its certainly an interesting "puzzle" type hand |pg||
nt|chthonic: No swing on board 7, as expected|pg||

nt|lestergold: 2s and a club only to lose|pg||
nt|chthonic: On this, our last board,  8, EW bid and made 4S in the other room.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: 4@s making is a super score|pg||
nt|MolvaM: with this layout|pg||
nt|jaheim: but they made 4 sp in the other romm?|pg||
nt|fifee: that is remarkable|pg||
nt|oliverc: That will potentially put a bit of a dent in the V-IVI lead|pg||
nt|fifee: swing for the T-RSB team there|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tight match.|pg||
nt|othered1: Not everyone|pg||

nt|star6ija: Varna|pg||
nt|col3435: and don't forget there are two "bonus" rounds coming up that weren't origianlly advertised in the schedule|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south led a heart in spite of the 1@h opening|pg||
nt|chessmaste: North should overcall now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: slam makes but I dont think they will bid it|pg||
nt|othered1: You can't use KR only when it upgrades.  Or you can, but your evaluations will be inconsistent|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: OR room even made 12 tricks missing 3 acres in that hand where E passed all the time, so first huge swing now for N/S, "A-SRR"|pg||
nt|ritong: or 1NT, for that matter|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lestergold: as i guessed ahead of yourself|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chthonic: It played from the other side  -- south -- in the other room and on a heart lead, only going up ace from dummy retains the tempo.... very tough, indeed.|pg||
nt|fifee: without a @C lead or switch NS can make 4@H|pg||
nt|fifee: and EW can make 4@S|pg||
nt|kapitanski: in Bulgaria  not so many  players but  both of them are  very  strong...and  not  be  suprice  here  to wiin  any  team|pg||
nt|santyclz: Pretty close to a 50% slam here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Seems that the heart suit is the key.|pg||
nt|chthonic: OK, this hand...|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I dont like a RDBL with a good fit for pd|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Here's another strong 2-suiter in east.  Again only 14 HCP, but . . . |pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: 4@S should be off|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: 4s here is nopt incidentally that great acontract it makes because the spades behave and the hearts are 3/3|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: last board on this tournament|pg||
nt|oliverc: @D ruff|pg||
nt|fifee: with the @D ruff |pg||
nt|oliverc: but solid if NS don't find it immediately|pg||
nt|othered1: Here 3@S has to be a long suit.  Had north not bid, @S might have been looking for help|pg||
nt|santyclz: I can't use k&r at all, I get a "you do not have permission..." when I try,|pg||
nt|santyclz: W is surely worth 4@d regardless.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: lets hear the brakes screech soon |pg||
pc|cK|nt|MolvaM: Aj9873 is a nice overcall I think at this vul|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@s preempt willbe costly|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: ty all, see you soon|pg||
nt|col3435: lots of awkward part-score hands in this round|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: after about 10 min.|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart lead creates the 8th trick|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Best to have a six card suit at the two level|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but reasonable after ivanchev bid 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: ty all|pg||
pc|d4|nt|col3435: seems that everything goes off at the moment|pg||
nt|ritong: bulgarian style, i like it|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: or they blast it being behind |pg||
nt|MolvaM: there goes the diamond trick|pg||
nt|chessmaste: That lead will not paralyse declarer|pg||
nt|pelu: I agree, Mark, are u getting old? :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it seems the board will be flat now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chthonic: It makes, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|chthonic: Sure.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Not yet!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: will go for 500|pg||

nt|kapitanski: end of the  board? :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|ritong: first bid game, then try to make it  that is their idea about game tries, and i agree fully:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chthonic: Lose spade, heart, club|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east knows that if he doesnt bid then his partner will never be in anything|pg||
nt|oliverc: next :)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure -- @Sxxxx isn't a plus, unless east has 5|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h2|nt|MolvaM: it seems both Nort's had poor memories of overcalling with such hands|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphb1: bye|pg||
pc|c4|nt|MolvaM: now Nanev knows that the opps have a slam.  could teammates have bid that?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphb1: see you soon|pg||
nt|lestergold: the nonth could come from spades but declarer will probably try the clubs|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chthonic: Assuring a diamond ruff and a push.|pg||
nt|lestergold: lucky here they flatten the board playing in the same dodgy spade game|pg||
nt|kapitanski: yes they  (rumen-kalin)  play  their  sistem....1@c  weak NT or  strong (GF)hand|pg||
nt|ritong: oki  ty|pg||
nt|ritong: so 1@d is anything which does not fit with that|pg||
nt|kapitanski: nasko-toni play  their  precision  variant.|pg||
nt|oliverc: Why is Joey Silver never here when you need him?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: On previous hand, KR evaluates west's 15 count as 17.65|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|chthonic: when the spade ten falls|pg||
nt|lestergold: i predict this will go off|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|s7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: on his way |pg||
nt|chthonic: no uppercuts lying around loose|pg||
nt|lestergold: no i stand corrected|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can t get at their spade trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: what about spade switch now and then heart back|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: Ivanchev is thinking|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think only card to beat this contract is Js|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: 8 spads not good enuf|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok thanks everyone :)|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: see you after 5-10 min.|pg||
nt|fifee: he has lots of clones :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h4|nt|lestergold: the spades will be blocked now|pg||
nt|oliverc: lol|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: well declarer has to take ace of spades but he didnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: so contract now off on heart return|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chthonic: Just has to guess hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: impossible for declarer to read that situation so east got away with a loose card- the J was a killer against all plays by north|pg||
pc|c7|nt|MolvaM: @h2 asked for a heart return probably|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chthonic: except imaginary ones|pg||
nt|lestergold: yeh but there was also a question of the third dim- if a trump is drawn it cant be ruffed in dummy and needs a long heart for a discard|pg||
nt|lestergold: needing hearts 3/3|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|stoffers: in CR sjetne had 3@d awailable as fitjump, it was abit passive from forfot just to bid 3@s there, 3@h was a option with the nice controls. |pg||

nt|kipp: Usually you don't have a solid suit for the fit jump, so I guess he pictured 2 @C losers, a @D loser, and also a @H or @S loser|pg||

pc|d4|nt|ritong: east is sure about 4/1 trump break, if not worse, so his target is to minimize the loss|pg||
nt|santyclz: Partner, you never return my leads!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|oliverc: If 1@S was natural (and not alerted, apparently) it does seem curious, and 3@S|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d9|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lots of tricks, but both black suits are blocked.|pg||
nt|othered1: with the @S coming down (but declarer doesn't know it) there is no way to stop this.  In fact, double-dummy, n orth must now cash.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c5|nt|tomi2: in hand 4 where gazillii allowed NS to stop in 3@D, the OR bid 3nt and failed badly, so next huge swing to NS|pg||
