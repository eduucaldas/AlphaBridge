nt|sunsamvar: all the cards lying wrong for a nt contract by E/W|pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps W shud have Dbl 2@H in CR instead of bidding 2 NT.  View uinitial pass this shud be for take-out|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bjacobs: Yes, the CR auction is not one that will go into the text books|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H!|an|majors|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Let's see what this West does ...|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be 2 NT intended as a type Lebensohl|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps it was intended as Lebensohl?|pg||
nt|jbgood: echo|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Presumably North has shown the majors, so the takeout double is less attractive than just getting to 3@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is there any point using Lebensohl here?|pg||

nt|lestergold: not  a bad 6 actually|pg||
nt|lestergold: cold played by south whenever there is no club lead ot club k onside|pg||
nt|chthonic: Getting to six would be a bit much, but it is a swing opportunity|pg||

mb|3C|nt|lestergold: well a bit of a misfit hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s have a normal spade part score|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@h can not be made even if W misses @C lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@s is a good sacrifice even against game|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: but hard to  reach!|pg||
nt|chthonic: That overcall may have a negative result, since NS would surely be playing spades absent the bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a reopening double would have been interesting and pehaps a rather better bid|pg||

nt|bjacobs: 5@H seems to be contract of the day |pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|4S|nt|sharkey: S passed in CR|pg||

nt|lestergold: i would pass and michaelsd at first opportunity|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|chthonic: three 4333 hands|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: has its dangers b ut we are at favourable vulnerability i would not want to mislead my partne into the belief that ighad any defensive values|pg||

nt|lestergold: mind you 5c is off|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3d is an atrocious bid|pg||
pc|s2|nt|star6ija: now @DAce @d ruff|pg||
nt|star6ija: @C to the King @druff|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|lestergold: makes on any defence other than spade followed by heart switch assuming declarer picks the club|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: on best defence|pg||
nt|chthonic: It would -- or will -- be interesting to see the effect on EW of an opening bid.  Whether there is sufficient competition to bid 5C|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to sit tight with this misfitting evenly divided hand ifpard cant bid again then must defnd 2s|pg||
pc|cA|nt|star6ija: @c to the Queen @s to the Ace and another @s for throw-in|pg||

nt|lestergold: south's five spade bid was incorrect- he had no reason to contradict his partner's suggestion that they defend|pg||

nt|star6ija: Varna|pg||
nt|col3435: and don't forget there are two "bonus" rounds coming up that weren't origianlly advertised in the schedule|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south led a heart in spite of the 1@h opening|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: as i guessed ahead of yourself|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|chthonic: It played from the other side  -- south -- in the other room and on a heart lead, only going up ace from dummy retains the tempo.... very tough, indeed.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: I dont like a RDBL with a good fit for pd|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4s here is nopt incidentally that great acontract it makes because the spades behave and the hearts are 3/3|pg||
