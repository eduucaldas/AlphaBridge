nt|lestergold: not  a bad 6 actually|pg||
nt|lestergold: cold played by south whenever there is no club lead ot club k onside|pg||
nt|chthonic: Getting to six would be a bit much, but it is a swing opportunity|pg||
nt|lestergold: well trhey had a strong 9 card fiut 29 combinde d points and excellent controls not that far fetched|pg||
nt|star6ija: fine, we will try to make something , thanks a lot |pg||
nt|col3435: there may be people around, it's not as busy with vugraphs as it was earlier|pg||
nt|star6ija: 9 IMPs sry|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@d from Nort's hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this is "Danish"  as it is a movement in teams where  1 plays  2 |pg||
nt|vugraphb1: bad connection, sry all|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: well a bit of a misfit hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s have a normal spade part score|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@h can not be made even if W misses @C lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@s is a good sacrifice even against game|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|1S|nt|lestergold: but hard to  reach!|pg||
nt|chthonic: That overcall may have a negative result, since NS would surely be playing spades absent the bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a reopening double would have been interesting and pehaps a rather better bid|pg||

nt|chthonic: No one will get excited here|pg||

nt|lestergold: part score limit here for both sides e/w minors n/s spades |pg||
nt|chthonic: I would.  How are you ever going to show this otherwise?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would pass and michaelsd at first opportunity|pg||
nt|lestergold: well whatever the redouible was not inmtended to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: very dangerous to use this bid when meaning may not be clear to pard|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1H|nt|chthonic: three 4333 hands|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: has its dangers b ut we are at favourable vulnerability i would not want to mislead my partne into the belief that ighad any defensive values|pg||

mb|p|nt|chthonic: Sure, not enough defense... |pg||
nt|lestergold: ah should show two suiter immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: haqppened to have hit the right suit|pg||
nt|chthonic: And I am strong for sound openers... But this one I would make an exception for.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: 120?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|col3435: well|pg||

pc|s2|nt|lestergold: now this way north knows|pg||
nt|lestergold: his hand is not pullinmg a lot of defensive weight|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you 5c is off|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3d is an atrocious bid|pg||
pc|s9|nt|star6ija: now @DAce @d ruff|pg||
nt|star6ija: @C to the King @druff|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: his pardners bid over the double is clearly weak|pg||
nt|star6ija: izvinjavam se na vsi4ki bulgari, no 6te smenja malko ezika za6toto imame dosta gosti|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: looks like it |pg||
nt|lestergold: makes on any defence other than spade followed by heart switch assuming declarer picks the club|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: on best defence|pg||
nt|chthonic: It would -- or will -- be interesting to see the effect on EW of an opening bid.  Whether there is sufficient competition to bid 5C|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to sit tight with this misfitting evenly divided hand ifpard cant bid again then must defnd 2s|pg||
pc|h3|nt|star6ija: @c to the Queen @s to the Ace and another @s for throw-in|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: now north judged wisely or not to pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially at unfavourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|star6ija: Most probably Danailov will try to cash 3 @h now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|col3435: west would love partner to double of course, but that seems a lot to hope for|pg||
nt|lestergold: For benefit of specs i do not know any of these players|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps I should|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: but i am commentating on the bridge as i find it played|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: south's five spade bid was incorrect- he had no reason to contradict his partner's suggestion that they defend|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: had he showed his weak two suiter then he would have not placed himself in this position partner would kbnow exactly what he had|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d6|nt|col3435: so perhaps it would have been advisable to bid 3NT|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|col3435: partner doesn't have much but it still makes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Murat Molva|pg||

nt|MolvaM: hi everyone :) good morning|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: is there a "right" way to play that @D holding |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure |pg||
nt|chthonic: Can they find first nine tricks?.... Probably|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n more chance than 4s because of the 4333 mirror|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: however i can see 3 spades 3 hearts a club and a dim where is the ninth coming from?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|MolvaM: friendly distribution but declarer has to manage the spade suit|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: mind you if they get it right its only4 off for 400|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is mistake from N|pg||
nt|lestergold: and north /south may well develop 2 long hearts along with the spade and the 2 clubs in the rqce in any case|pg||
nt|star6ija: this ruff with the @D Jack looks very starnge|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|MolvaM: normally the 1-1 split is 52%. |pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|chthonic: Lots of action on board 2.... East preempted 3C, and NS are in 4S X..... so the 3H "disaster" is going to be a pickup....|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s may well bid to game on their combined 25 points buty i cant see anything making|pg||

nt|MolvaM: esp at this vul|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: interesting 2 @C |pg||
nt|chthonic: I don't like that bid.  Let them get to 3NT and cash five tricks...|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard leads wrong and you are never in |pg||
nt|sybarra: and they cash 7 or 8 minor |pg||
nt|chthonic: Good point..... |pg||
nt|col3435: ah, good, East has found something in his cards|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer has to locate the @sJ|pg||

nt|moen: yes|pg||

nt|lestergold: but this was absurd west should have bid his hand to begin with|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting north opened a dim in open room takeout double so e/w played inm their making pat score|pg||
nt|lestergold: but no great damage done on the hand|pg||
nt|jaheim: :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|MolvaM: good score from the open room for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Well, they did not bid 2S on that other hand.. and DOUBLED the 3NT contract, receiving a SPADE !! lead|pg||
nt|chthonic: Nice|pg||
nt|lestergold: should have made a raise showing defensive values so that east would know not to push to the five level|pg||
nt|chthonic: Al Roth would turn over in his grave... to open that 1S.|pg||
nt|lestergold: an unassuming cue bid raise with his 12 count for example|pg||
nt|MolvaM: open room didnt find the S hand worth opening|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: this bidding must surely be wrong or for the next hand more likely??|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|chthonic: But it has/had preemptive value|pg||
nt|lestergold: ??|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it is important to play 3NT from east but declarer still has 8 tricks unless south leads a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: And on board 4, where 1NT was set three vulnerable tricks, North in the other room overcalled 2C... P P P.|pg||
nt|chthonic: So there will be another swing.|pg||
nt|lestergold: again west does not want to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it ahappens 4h should not make on best defence|pg||
nt|chthonic: That one adverse to our NS team|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west has a clear cut bid of 3h|pg||
nt|chthonic: No... adverse to our EW team.  Sorry|pg||

mb|d|mb|1S|nt|lestergold: as i guessed ahead of yourself|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chthonic: It played from the other side  -- south -- in the other room and on a heart lead, only going up ace from dummy retains the tempo.... very tough, indeed.|pg||
