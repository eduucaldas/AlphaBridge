nt|yuval10: winning 23 VP's|pg||
nt|yuval10: Berik 4th with 18|pg||
nt|bjurn: EW plays a strong club system that looks a lot like Scanian Scientific. No one knows what NS plays but I hope they do :)|pg||
nt|pale hose: NS is not a regular partnership assuming natural|pg||
nt|vugraph815: They play 5542 with trfs over 1@C I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: N should raise to 2@s now|pg||
nt|bjurn: We're starting with a good 6@H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|haans: no slam here|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt feels right|pg||
nt|larrymori: 10-12 1NT presumably|pg||
nt|haans: 14-16|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps S is considering slam, but after the X there's not much hope for it in his point of view|pg||
nt|pale hose: thanks|pg||
nt|vugraph815: I heard them discuss earlier :)|pg||
nt|pale hose: :)|pg||
nt|bjurn: Easts 1@D denies a minimum hand with 4cM and a longer minor|pg||
nt|bjurn: but it will be hard to reach when East didn't open his 11 count|pg||

nt|pale hose: This is trouble, very aggressive D by Wrang|pg||

mb|3C|nt|haans:  EW play 2 way clubs |pg||
nt|milton_se: a bit light 1C opener -- may lead to a negative score|pg||
mb|p|nt|gunnarhall:  can they stay out of game ater that openig=ngbid?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|larrymori: if it is 14-16, N is a little short|pg||
nt|davpro: I hope I´ll do a better job here then when I was playing...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|haans: looked wrong 13-16|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@s probably promised 3 cards, otherwise he passed|pg||
nt|haans: i think its better to pass with support|pg||
nt|larrymori: better rise or the hand is down|pg||
nt|haans: then X-man has to lead'|pg||
nt|larrymori: there is also the consideration of showing stoppers or not in @hs|pg||
nt|yuval10: If N had 3@h's, then 3NT was better here as the defense could've scored a ruff|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps he considered that , too|pg||

nt|Walddk4: We were very kind to you, David, although you did not deserve it :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|mikael_w: this looks like a comfortable contract|pg||

mb|1H|nt|haans: larsson-johansson fairly natural bidding|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H here?|pg||
nt|milton_se: this may be a nice 3-level fight|pg||
nt|haans:  opps are vul so no hanky panky|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes if East hand HXX play the K was the best thing to do|pg||
nt|yuval10: *had|pg||
nt|mikael_w: no, he KNOW the lead was from 3 @h:s |pg||
nt|yuval10: blocking the suit|pg||
nt|davpro: NS do a lot here...hard to bid though? Or?|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: and a trivial 4S|pg||
mb|2D|an|5 !d|nt|gunnarhall:  diamond pos crucial in 4 h|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  Likely 4sp sac 2-3 down|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW can have a decent save with 4@s|pg||
nt|haans:  nothing to say about this deal|pg||
nt|bjurn: allthou Scania hasnt performed so far, this team beat Fredin's team in one of the semifinals|pg||
nt|bjurn: Probert seems to be desperate opening a bit weak in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|haans:  yep|pg||
nt|pale hose: I agree with opening, I mean you cant just give up|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: n/s plays 2@s@h openings as 10-13 +6|pg||
nt|yuval10: which is -3 with the best defense|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  If ostberg bid 4 sp they may get away with it unxed|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yuval10: NS's standard of weak 2's in 2nd hand while red against white must be higher than what South has here|pg||
nt|bjurn: 1@C is either natural or promises a balanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 14-16 NT by EW?|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  can we get the score in this match?|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's 7:1|pg||
nt|yuval10: from the 1st half|pg||
nt|larrymori: still difficult to not get overboard but 2@d might have helped|pg||
nt|yuval10: X by West now - if TO|pg||
nt|milton_se: -- even if 6 is makeable|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mikael_w: and if opps comes in to the bidding all Dbl are for penalty, this is a realy good opening if you ask me|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello all from Italy|pg||
nt|larrymori: surprised south did not act over 3@s|pg||
nt|bjurn: his team mate Johan Bennet would be proud of West action, advocating never to pass in 3rd seat!|pg||
nt|haans:  3nt????????? avarelli tried that 1968 did not find slam|pg||
nt|haans:  they miss a grand|pg||
nt|vugraph815: There's some trouble with the bridgemate, mr. Brenning is in the room trying to fix it|pg||
nt|bjurn: North seems to be trusting Probert to have at least opening values|pg||
nt|haans:  belladonna did say avarelli was to blame|pg||
nt|pale hose: he caught a good dummy this time, but vs East we all can see what he would have made|pg||
nt|vugraph815: he just left|pg||
nt|bjurn: Dbl shows at least four spades|pg||
nt|haans:  N have a passing hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|gunnarhall:  pia andersson is N and W according to my computer!|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well. if e/w try 3 NT it will be realy expensive|pg||
nt|vugraph815: Roger Andersson is playing North, by some reason they both change when I change one of'em|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pia is a very capable woman... :)|pg||
nt|haans: i would have opened 2? you?|pg||
nt|haans:  1@H shows 3+ hearts|pg||
nt|bjurn: N isnt that good at passing|pg||
nt|vugraph815: Arne tar upp 3@h ur budlådan men ångrar sig|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gunnarhall:  Ahlesved is looking at a doubleton sp and a sing in p suit normal pass but surprised he did not open a weak two|pg||
nt|larrymori: 64 ok though light unfavorable|pg||
nt|haans:  no that was EW|pg||
nt|milton_se: only that EW in fact has the highest making contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|gunnarhall:  Pass is not for cilla|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  Is this a clever bid to show a raise to 2 1/2 heart?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: ohhh, sry, I looked on the wrong conv. card|pg||
nt|yuval10: the interference might actually help NS to reach their top spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: weak jump raise (with cards :))|pg||
nt|yuval10: didn't E denied a 4-carded major by passing 2@d ?|pg||
nt|larrymori: but wasn't 2@h to play or was it inv?|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  THAT WHAT SHE THOUGHT|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's why 2@h bid looks inferior for me to X|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North could choise also Dbl (with Kxx in @H) instead 2@C, guessing|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  He trapped himself|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd hand i never have 4 cards on other major|pg||
nt|larrymori: but a red overcall is supposed to show a good hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C normally is better, but bridge isn't chess :)|pg||
nt|haans: biggest error is not opening 2@H|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  Double with norths hand = bad bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, dbl not ortodoxe, but would work in this hand|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|davpro: 4@s antisplinter would have done the trick...|pg||
nt|yuval10: I think N could've donw more here....|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed i was about to suggest 4@s David|pg||
nt|haans:  3nt may make|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mikael_w: even 2@s might be expensive|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: overcall with 1nt gets u to game|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gunnarhall:  It works only on this hand |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have very good cardsfor defense from W's hand|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  x may be penalty|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Martin de Knijff|pg||
nt|bjurn: good lead by Thomas Andersson, holding 3NT to ten tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yuval10: but i guess she wasn't sure about the meaning of X in this position|pg||

nt|bjurn: nine even|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|yuval10: a Kibitzer suggest that 2@h by South was 9-12|pg||
nt|bjurn: @H lead would have defeated it promptly|pg||
pc|d4|nt|davpro: Even I could make this...on a bad day :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|yuval10: hat's X for you anyway?  |pg||
nt|yuval10: *what's|pg||
nt|mikael_w: verry nice lead from selldén, LOW @d from 109x to show P he has 3|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3/5 lead probably|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  Lucky that not much is making|pg||
pc|s3|nt|milton_se: that 3rd spade wasn't good|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|haans:  players did not play wrong only operatorÂ¨'|pg||
nt|bjurn: but a @H from East is enough when he takes the @CA|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|davpro: Yes- But leading P's suit simply can't be right, can it?|pg||
nt|bjurn: depends on who's your partner :p|pg||
pc|s6|nt|milton_se: on the other hand, QH also was a mistake'|pg||
nt|pale hose: Does anyone know NS methods?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans:  but small contracts minor importance|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|yuval10: make it more understandable for the reason that led him to pass|pg||
nt|haans: i do not have that info|pg||

mb|1N|nt|haans: 11-13 or 16+|pg||
mb|p|nt|gunnarhall:  maybe your cardplay is lacking in flair|pg||
nt|pale hose: EW does not use Multi or weak twos, 2S would have been 4S and a longer minor 10-13|pg||

mb|p|nt|gunnarhall:  DOUBLED OR NOT?|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  I can't recall that I ever taken you down|pg||

mb|p|nt|arvid: Is 4@H really makeable?|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, set up a spade|pg||
nt|haans:  settle for 2@H please|pg||
nt|pale hose: I like 1N by E despite showing 14-16 nice upgrade|pg||
nt|pale hose: a problem in any strong 1C system is obviously the 1D catchall opening.|pg||
nt|yuval10: A kibitzer suggested that 2NT would've been 18-19|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: 17-19|pg||
nt|haans:  x is not DONT then what?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|arvid: If a club is led the defence can get a club ruff|pg||

nt|pale hose: and preemptive vs NS eventual major fit|pg||
nt|haans:  4@D was nice but why?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pale hose: u dont see Wrang overcall 4c suits  very often|pg||
nt|bjurn: it's not really the 1@D opening that is the problem.. the 2@C opening is the worst part|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|pale hose: facing a 14-16 NT vulnerable is the West hand not worth game?|pg||

nt|haans: the lead made it|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  Explains easts pass|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  Here we go again 3NT makes when it could have been beaten|pg||
nt|yuval10: what do you bid from E ?  very interesting decision|pg||
nt|bjurn: My guess, his partner wants him to bid his longest suit.. |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans:  3 hearts ergo p short|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|haans:  x must mean @H + other suit|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans:  clubs not found|pg||
nt|yuval10: your choices been 2@h with a very bad suit,  XX or 1NT|pg||
nt|davpro: RD perhaps...not knowing what it shows...but seems to fit Es hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: or, as E decided, 2@s|pg||
nt|mikael_w: looks like this might go down 1 whith desent def|pg||
nt|haans:  yes how could i not se that|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mikael_w: with a @h lead this would have a chanse to go down, now I think this will always make|pg||
nt|pale hose: assuming 3S not forcing Andersson did really well here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pale hose: that really depends what 2C shows, for me and Wrang it shows both minors 45-54-55, thats a great opening|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gunnarhall:  Is Axdorph having a problem counting to 9|pg||
nt|milton_se: and besides, 3S making|pg||
nt|bjurn: this looks to go one down when nothings behaves for NS|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: why the delay|pg||
nt|yuval10: interesting swing in the first hand, normal 4@s here, 2@c XX + 1 other room|pg||
nt|yuval10: W found a bad hand for a lead-directing X over the artifical 2@c.... he found his P with a Yarbrough|pg||
nt|haans: is there data error?|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  This is the sort of hand that tells you about the player holding it . Some player spend 10 sec others 10 min|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mikael_w: and now @d J|pg||

mb|1D|nt|haans: to weak to prempt?|pg||

mb|1S|nt|bjurn: 1NT shows 15-17 so N seems to have upgraded his baggy @C suit|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pale hose: Eliazohn normally a very aggressive bidder|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: 4@s is a great sacr. vs 4@h. but n/s will probebly make 5@h if they reach it|pg||
nt|pale hose: NS playing 4c Majors made the West hand easier no doubt, other rooms vs a 5c M  S would raise hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: most that have 10-13 for 2 M open 2@D multi with less|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  Win in hand and play a low sp looks right to me If PO Sundelin is watching he could tell|pg||
nt|yuval10: another 14 imps for Berik - the blitz continue|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  Better still win in hand and play ace of S |pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: @sA and more @s might set it down tho|pg||
nt|haans: standard is that 4nt is asking for minors|pg||
nt|haans:  3@H do not look like a prempt|pg||
nt|vugraph815: As we can now tell|pg||
nt|bjurn: 3@C shows 5-5 and about 14-16 |pg||

pc|s2|nt|davpro: and the 6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pale hose: and West overcalling 2S probably|pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans:  why do X 2@H meaning longer @H|pg||
nt|yuval10: this lead will give away the contract immediately|pg||
nt|davpro: that lead will not make declarer cry|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|haans:  @SJ == odd cards == no|pg||
nt|vugraph815: 3@h showed 4-8 points at Warne, and 4-5 at Haglund's|pg||
nt|haans:  or singel |pg||
nt|pale hose: with the great breaks this will make i suppose|pg||
nt|bjurn: I cant see why not|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mikael_w: 5@h would go down, but funny thing is that 5@d would probably make :) BUt NOT 6|pg||
nt|bjurn: and that lead will only speed things up|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: in sweden all play udca (we call it schneider-malmö)|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: because the return @C leave the return to the dummy|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mikael_w: but old blackwood will stop them from bidding it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: mey be i am in error, but i would play @D for the dummy like Peterson|pg||
nt|pale hose: guess not |pg||
nt|pale hose: so this 1C is natural, or balanced 11-13/17-19|pg||
nt|bjurn: Fryklund stole the opponents trump suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: 6@D makes with two clubs ruffs (saving @D3 to enter Souths hand obviously)|pg||
nt|bjurn: 1@D shows 4+@H|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans:  why would dare to x here?|pg||
nt|davpro: Tobias wants to bid...would have been better to act on 3@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gunnarhall:  Ididn't give correct count so they barred me from the country|pg||
nt|larrymori: that's what I meant by the exile|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  Please focus on the bridge |pg||
nt|yuval10: and now?|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  K of s and sp A is the str forward play|pg||
nt|larrymori: he really had to keep the entries to dummy|pg||
nt|milton_se: this is a test of the brakes :)|pg||
nt|pale hose: I assume South thinks he has way too good of a hand for 2C now|pg||
nt|pale hose: proven wrong|pg||
nt|bjurn: I thought so too|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this will work out fine|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gunnarhall:  You know about me Larry|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow, brave bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: i stand corrected :(|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bjurn: is 3@D showing canapé now? |pg||
nt|haans:  as usual 60 points out|pg||
nt|vugraph815: South wrote that 3@D was canapé but North didn't|pg||
nt|bjurn: so now South will probably jump to 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: good function ...|pg||
nt|haans:  they alert 1@H for showing 5 cards|pg||
nt|haans:  well not america|pg||
nt|pale hose: that is a real thin opening in a natural system|pg||
nt|davpro: Would he have bid 5@s had he held a 5-card suit? :)|pg||
nt|bjurn: W is a nice guy, helping out|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yuval10: not the optimal spot, again|pg||
nt|haans: odd bidding|pg||
nt|milton_se: maybe because their CC says "rarely 6 or 4"|pg||
nt|bjurn: North will bid 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: South disregarded his @s suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: N need to find the @h switch to prevent 11 tricks, it seem|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|yuval10: but the bidding takes a twist here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yuval10: will W find the small @h switch?|pg||
nt|yuval10: not very likely...|pg||
nt|davpro: This is going nowhere very fast :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: I think 3 nt shod deny 4 card major here|pg||
nt|haans:  spade ruiff soon|pg||
nt|pale hose: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: so NS escaped with a good MP result....|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  Lovely cl J|pg||
nt|larrymori: and 10@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: and does|pg||
nt|haans:  lead dia |pg||
nt|pale hose: anyone for a direct 4S overcall by W ?|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I agree whith Hans|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think its TERRIBLE bridge to do this in a TM|pg||
nt|davpro: Yes. Better to make a slightly weak negatvie double of 3@h and then let P look at his cards|pg||
nt|davpro: Now P is stairing with disbelief (probably)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think this will end in a disaster|pg||

pc|c7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|yuval10: now things will go apart for declarer.... E can play @s and score a ruff|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and now @d|pg||
nt|yuval10: @s better i think|pg||
nt|davpro: Well- me 2, but compare the 3@h-opening with the 4@s;4NT,5@d bids and it's amaingly beutiful :)|pg||

nt|milton_se: high C now = making |pg||
nt|davpro: 6! more tricks for defense?|pg||
nt|yuval10: defence can take 4 more ticks ( 2@s, 1@d, 1@c ) to beat it 4 |pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, a @s lead would lead to -6 I think|pg||
nt|haans:  mikael all that ask about 3@H have you told them about 2 3 4 rules?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: where this will end we will have to wait and see|pg||
nt|haans:  partner to have 1 trick himself|pg||
nt|yuval10: I was wrong by the way - our excellent operator is Johan Gronkvist - Tack Johan!|pg||

nt|haans:  big clubs here but opps have game|pg||
nt|haans:  1@C-1@H-3@C and away|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: seven need @H 2/2 or Q sgl, little bit over 50%|pg||
nt|haans:  big clubs have highest contract 4@S|pg||
nt|bjurn: 1@C shows clubs or a balanced hand (not 15-17)|pg||
mb|1N|an|fg|nt|yuval10: if NS knew the situation in the match...perhaps. otherwise i don't think it's likely|pg||
nt|haans:  two ten to much for 1n|pg||
nt|pale hose: with the kind of openings South presented on the previous hand 2D looks ambitious|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans:  5@D as sacrifice - zone|pg||
nt|arvid: 2@C = destructive with @C or 55 @H and @D|pg||
nt|mikael_w: To be honest I think its fair to pay 1100 when you bid like that in a team match, if you do it in matchpoint I think you deserve a TOP|pg||
mb|2C|an|4+ !c|nt|gunnarhall:  oppurtunity for a trailing team|pg||
nt|larrymori: 52.5 for that but Qxxx onside too|pg||
nt|milton_se: just a 10-11 3-card raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: 1@S is either balanced or good cards with @D suit|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bridge_one: anyone know the meens of 1@s ?|pg||
nt|haans: carrot clubs style 5 hearts|pg||
nt|bjurn: this will end in 1NT?|pg||

mb|p|nt|gunnarhall:  Pia and Cilla need something good to happen We all know they are capeble of beating anybody|pg||
nt|yuval10: not a good grand, that requires 70% + |pg||

nt|haans:  ahh stayman|pg||
nt|davpro: not as they play|pg||
mb|2N|an|bal no 4 major|nt|larrymori: the lead was crucial here|pg||

nt|haans:  3 card spade support|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: 57.5|pg||
nt|arvid: I guess North could see east had the red suits, so maybe he should pass|pg||
nt|milton_se: but 2NT was certainly an overbid|pg||
nt|pale hose: 4333 vs a partner who could be balanced I dont know not my style|pg||

nt|haans:  to strong for a direct 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraph815: North's opening promised an unbalanced hand...|pg||
nt|bjurn: at least in the sense that it was natural |pg||
mb|3N|nt|gunnarhall:  Good if you are 33 IMPs down|pg||

nt|yuval10: yes, 4 rounds of @c remove the threat|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I bet Anders is regreting that now|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a partial battle here|pg||
nt|pale hose: this could be eventful|pg||
nt|bjurn: I was starting to worry if I was being too groggy :)|pg||
nt|davpro: If this would have been a fotballmatch the manager would have substituted some players :)|pg||
nt|bjurn: Erik is still a junior and still need to learn to pass occasionally|pg||
mb|2N|nt|gunnarhall:  In order to beat 3 nt NS has to attack clubs in time|pg||
nt|haans:  reopeng x please|pg||
nt|haans:  and he is learning|pg||
mb|p|nt|gunnarhall:  Phantom in 5 D possible|pg||
nt|pale hose: Nice fit for NS|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gunnarhall:  Now 4 D = more likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 10-12 not vuln in I and II site work very well !|pg||
nt|bjurn: EW will probably end up in 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: north stole the ew contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: board 7 was a push at 6@h, as expected|pg||
nt|haans: 13-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: more likely if the K@c is in @hs|pg||
nt|pale hose: a lot of experts play transfers here (I dont nor seems like EW does) with the West hand|pg||
nt|bjurn: Dbl is for take-out|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|haans: opening bids get weaker and weaker|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  not close|pg||
nt|milton_se: Svensson seems convinced that Ss won't break|pg||
nt|bjurn: so West will take out :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yuval10: W was too passive here IMO..|pg||
nt|milton_se: and still a decent 3NT :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans:  3@D asking not showing|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pale hose: a lesson for many. So easy to get caught sleeping with the east hand over 4H|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|yuval10: red vs white there's a good chance that opps are playing games with you, you MUSt act|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I like to Dbl here on W:s hand after 1@d -1@h, then you have done what you can and your partner can decide the rest|pg||
nt|larrymori: declarer working on the entryless suit...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gunnarhall:   pick up opportunity for ns|pg||
nt|davpro: good lead for declarer|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yuval10: nice switch by E|pg||
nt|haans:  we can all see a better lead :-)|pg||
nt|bjurn: a @H lead would be better now|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bjurn: 50% slam here, will they avoid it?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|arvid: this was the normal lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pale hose: Wrang is a firm believer of Rusinow, looks like he even convinced South to play 2-4|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bjurn: Erik seems to be learning fast |pg||
pc|hT|nt|pale hose: will Probert ruff high :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: 13 more imps for the Sivves team|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bjurn: has he convinced u as well?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pale hose: good play|pg||
nt|pale hose: good thing they did not play transfers 4H would likely have been doubled played by East|pg||
pc|d5|nt|arvid: now east will be squeezed|pg||
nt|pale hose: I play anything to please my partner :) , but sure I see a lot of benefits|pg||

pc|sT|nt|yuval10: quite bitter for the Everfresh pair here, as 6@c would've given them 12 imps|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: perfect counterplay by E/W|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  well def eastberg|pg||

nt|larrymori: didnt try to steal the @c?|pg||
nt|bjurn: West could have saved for one down by entering dummy with a @S instead of ruffing @H|pg||
nt|haans:  41H here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or opps to double you :)|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  Too tired|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|an|5 !d|mb|d|nt|haans: 1D show ANY 5-card M|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: cc say so|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s now?|pg||
nt|bjurn: 3@C?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yuval10: i really don't like this 2@s...almost everything here is against it - 2 Aces, horrible suit....|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Rdl for @H is a rubinshol depth|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: but losing some penalty situations|pg||
nt|yuval10: I don't think i open South's hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be they can arrange this situation|pg||
nt|haans:  1nt forcing?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yuval10: even in 2nd hand, i'd rather Pass|pg||
nt|milton_se: that opening bid was a helping hand to N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|gunnarhall:  Its all about having as many conventions as possible|pg||
mb|3C|nt|haans:  bidding game with S hand must be correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|gunnarhall:  Where are the Uncle slam hands?|pg||
nt|larrymori: in a big club sys, this is solid|pg||
nt|haans: they only have 1 cc but most have different systms|pg||
nt|bjurn: trump lead|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yuval10: they play it from the right side here.... @s lead from W was more uncomfortable for declarer|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 2Nt is natural, so North don't knew the weak hand of p|pg||
nt|haans:  trash stayman turned to stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: Arne L isn't to impressed by Brunzells 2-opener -- has seen'em before...|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd hand = be conservative|pg||
nt|yuval10: sometimes P will have 5 @c's here and you just gave away the game because you opened such a poor suit|pg||
nt|haans:  spade lead is a killer|pg||
nt|milton_se: y. 5C is better|pg||
nt|bjurn: why?|pg||
nt|bjurn: is there any hurry to get to 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraph815: Arne isn't really a big fan of taking time|pg||
nt|haans:  he was on the right track (wrong suit)|pg||
nt|davpro: Good lead. For declarer.|pg||
nt|haans:  rare in sweden to bid 3@H forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|gunnarhall:  3NT will be possible to make on this lead If you dont believe me ask Martin Hoffman!|pg||
nt|pale hose: should be an easy smooth ride|pg||
nt|bjurn: declarer wont have any problem with @SA in Wests hand|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|yuval10: the game looks like it might make|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|milton_se: still far from home, though|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|pale hose: Andersson took an aggressive but reasonable approach bidding 2S. His partner basically denied 4S when he bid 2C|pg||
nt|bjurn: I think West will try a low @S now|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|larrymori: but guessing the @h would be tough|pg||
nt|pale hose: NS needs to cash out otherwise +150|pg||
nt|mikael_w: normaly you bid 2@c 4:th suit and then bid @h again|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|milton_se: Skalman really needed this|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|bjurn: if 4@S is the right contract you'll get there. No need not to confer with partner|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s6|nt|haans:  yes|pg||
nt|davpro: Nice duck. Declarer needed it.|pg||
nt|bjurn: @H now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans:  or if 2@H is prempt simple rebid of @H show stronger hand|pg||
nt|haans:  making 3@H forcing|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  Now heart to the nine for us who can see all cards|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d2|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|larrymori: that would be good for much needed entries|pg||
nt|larrymori: the 10 sewered the whole suit|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s8|pc|h8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  To keep communication it would have been sensible to play heart to the nine |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|milton_se: +2?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  Not down if it loses|pg||
nt|larrymori: passing the 7 would have given him 3 @c tricks, now he removed his entry|pg||
nt|vugraph815: let's hope for N/S's sake that the last 2 boards won't contain any decisions. They don't really have the time for it|pg||

nt|po-s: 3d should make|pg||
nt|yuval10: we have one last board here|pg||
nt|bjurn: then bring it on|pg||
nt|vugraph815: Since it's impossible to change board in 3 min's the players decided to go to the toilet|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|yuval10: but then again, there's really nothing wrong in taking time to consider your play|pg||

nt|milton_se: 2C = 4Ss + long minor?|pg||
nt|milton_se: sorry 1NT|pg||
nt|pale hose: I must say I like Becklens 2N in the open room|pg||
nt|milton_se: would bid in 8 das a week|pg||
nt|milton_se: bid it 8 days|pg||
nt|pale hose: Helloo! here comes Eliazohn|pg||

nt|magnus_e: P Forcing from S?|pg||
nt|pale hose: haha|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: Dbl is again for take-out catering for a longer minor suit in Wests hand|pg||
mb|2D|an|relay 8+|nt|mikael_w: the game is not a good one, but as the cards are it works out fine|pg||
nt|mikael_w: But I dont thinf Anders and Jim will reach it here|pg||
nt|yuval10: they already did...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and there is how wrong I am :)|pg||
nt|haans: we have no cc|pg||
nt|bjurn: West might pass anyway, leading trump hoping to score enough tricks |pg||
mb|p|nt|bjurn: now EW is on minus whatever they do|pg||
mb|2H|nt|haans:  we will end with a GRAND |pg||
nt|haans:  gazzilli variation (Ã¶r HÃ¤xan in sweden)|pg||
nt|pale hose: I know Svensson likes 109 of spades and 10 hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|vugraph815: We had a little water-break but now we are back on track|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bridge_one: they play strong @C , i suppose, so pass can be any hand less 6/7 hcp|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  Another adventure in no mans land|pg||
nt|haans: nowdays most pass with 6+|pg||
nt|milton_se: he likes any card better than a 6 :)|pg||
nt|pale hose: with partner upgrading a lot of 19hcps you should pass the south hand in my opinion, Partner could have a 16++ he made 17 and rarely a good 19 count|pg||
nt|milton_se: sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 1nt did show 17-19 without major|pg||
nt|yuval10: good lead, but declarer can hardly go wrong here|pg||
nt|haans:  yes u cannot upgrade both hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pale hose: I suppose they can raise to 2H with 3, seems weird since 1H is 3+ in their system|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gunnarhall:  why do you never give me the dummy I deserve p ?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pale hose: a "thoughtful" speculative lead, not everyones choice|pg||

pc|c4|nt|yuval10: i'm not too familier with NS's system, but i think 2@h is what i'd have bid using natural system|pg||

pc|h2|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|bjurn: 2@H shows four when south interviened with the double (Rdbl would show 3c raise)|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  right bid wrong dummy|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  Peterson hoping for K doubleton with east|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mikael_w: I think I like 2 @h better, just becuse of this reason, your P might be happy whith a 6-card @s when he assume you have 2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans:  squeezing dummy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|milton_se: they play rather natural w 12-14 NT|pg||

nt|haans:  contract needed a simple finesse|pg||
nt|bjurn: haha, Arne must be furious :)|pg||
nt|davpro: Perhaps he's the one at the toilet...:)|pg||
nt|haans:  three opening bids now|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|3S|nt|haans:  11-13 or 16+|pg||
mb|d|nt|milton_se: waterproof 3NT now -- only H lead keeps it there|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I am told 1 NT showed 17-19. the opening is 14-16 ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: someone for 3@h in W now?|pg||
nt|yuval10: in natural systems it will show this kind of hand|pg||
nt|milton_se: you're right Mikael, 14-16 and 17-19 nowadays|pg||
nt|mikael_w: not much will happen on this board. e/w will bid 3 nt that dosent giwe much problems|pg||
nt|yuval10: but when you have an ace singelton if might be problematic in convincing your partner to go away from the NT contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: as we might see here...not that it matters, as 5@c is making as well|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 2@c -2@h 3 NT now I think|pg||
nt|haans: i put a $ ON 3NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: a BBO $  or a real one, Hans? :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: but i think so, too|pg||
nt|mikael_w: maybe 3@c -3@h -3NT|pg||
nt|vugraph815: Arne's asking: "how much time do we have?" It doesn't seem to be his biggest problem though, ever|pg||
nt|magnus_e: 5@d depending on that defence dont find their @c ruff|pg||
nt|haans:  for 1@C|pg||
nt|pale hose: we play 2N here as 8-10 (11) and 4card support|pg||
nt|bjurn: regarding Eliazohns harsh bidding I cant see how they will avoid 4@S on this boad|pg||
nt|bjurn: only South left out|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: he has too much of it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to our brilliant operator in Örebro and all our excellent commentators|pg||
nt|bjurn: *board|pg||
nt|bjurn: but DavPro would open it, right?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|haans:  strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: we're going to finish about 5 boards before the other table|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think W will bid @c becuse of the 1 NT bid over 1@d, W:s hand is great and a minor slam is around the corner|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our appreciation to FSB (Swedish Bridge Federation) for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Carina Westlin and Carl Ragnarsson have been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  17 opposite 6 took them to 2 nt Modern bridge|pg||
nt|yuval10: stayman now and then 3@d perhaps?|pg||
nt|pale hose: he might be saved by the convention|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: making 11 now|pg||
nt|mikael_w: that lead will give 1 IMP to e/w here|pg||
nt|larrymori: last chance for 3nt|pg||
nt|pale hose: guess not|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yuval10: thanks all, see you shortly|pg||
nt|haans: one squeeze defense missed and thats close to all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Back in 55 mins. Play still in progress in the open room|pg||
nt|milton_se: these 12 boards won't decide the championship|pg||
nt|mikael_w: P-O pointed out something almost what I wanted to be said before. If E:s major K is in @s instead of @h 6 @c is a better contract then 3 NT|pg||
nt|mikael_w: THATS why I thougt Arne will bid 3@c|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pale hose: I wonder if this shows his pattern and minimum|pg||
nt|milton_se: 4H seems interesting|pg||
nt|vugraph815: Wrang thought 2NT was natural while South thought it was Jacobyish|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mikael_w: I like the bid 3 @d|pg||
nt|haans:  still a long way to 7nt|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  Few exciting hands but the players did their best to liven it all up . Heja Sverige!!|pg||
nt|pale hose: I would rebid 2D with North giving partner a cheaper 2H 4 suit if I had more say 15+|pg||
pc|h3|nt|larrymori: he could afford to do that as a passed hand|pg||
nt|magnus_e: Very natural 3N|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 4 hearts lookes like a good contract also|pg||
nt|davpro: Rarely in fourth|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yuval10: last hand of the half now - thx to our commentators, and to our wonderful operator- Johan Gronkvist|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|haans:  @D lead?|pg||
nt|pale hose: I would like a NON lead with that hand|pg||
nt|haans:  to tranfer the lead?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans:  can they find @SK|pg||
nt|haans:  W has 6 hcp more|pg||
nt|milton_se: if N can be trusted w KH, then KS is needed for 17|pg||
nt|haans:  yes if trusted :-)|pg||
nt|milton_se: ;)|pg||
nt|pale hose: y :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pale hose: In the other room Jarlvik looks to have shown a good raise + with 2D and then raised 2S to 3S|pg||
nt|bjurn: at least EW will have one good board to score. They must be disappointed to see it to be flat|pg||
nt|pale hose: The South hand is very very poor|pg||
nt|bjurn: I agree with 2@D as a good raise but raising to 3@S is a gross overbid with @CKQ bare|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  Only a clublead would have given dec a problem|pg||
nt|gunnarhall:  Hard to avoid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@H the only game|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 4 @h will not be an easy contrakt with @s lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it is made bec @H 3/3|pg||
nt|yuval10: with 3-3 @h it's laydown.... just win A@s and play @c for 10th trick|pg||
nt|milton_se: and old auntie would lead her longest :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pale hose: I guess with the spades as they are a clubshift will do the job anyways|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
