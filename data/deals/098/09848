nt|Vugraphzqs: sorry here it was a problem with the connection|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Bonn for the annual Nations Cup. Seven 12-board matches in the round-robin. This is a match from round 3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Martin Carroll, Ireland, Josef Harsanyi, Germany, Mike Gold and David Edwin, England. I am Roland Wald from Denmark|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Mike from England here|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi David|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Lukas Schenk|pg||
nt|ady: first hand looks like a part score in spades for n/s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi David, Mike|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: Welcome to Round Robin 3rd: Germany II - Netherlands|pg||
nt|ady: hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie hard not to see 10 tricks for n/s but nmot really a biddable game|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  might make  on a low diamond lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: now its right|pg||
nt|lestergold: now the bidding fits |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  good evening|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  welcome back|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|mcarroll: Surprised N passed|pg||
nt|ady: north did not open?|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is going on here?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now they have no chance of getting to 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: and east opened on 8 pts      must be wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi  all Mike from England here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Mike|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: input error?|pg||
mb|2C|an|!d|nt|lestergold: looks like N/S are headed for 3N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 2@C rubinshol - xfert|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is unless e/w are determined to offer a penalty|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|boltonian2:  a trick short if played by S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: Lukas, are they really playing board 1?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: must be input |pg||
nt|lestergold: must be a different board the bidding doesnt matcvh the hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: yes, its board 1! no mistake ;-)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But the bidding does not match the cards they have|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At least not the cards *we* have|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: the cards are wrong, but its board 1|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|lestergold: ak and J of spades looks deadly|pg||
nt|duschek: Good evening from Copenhagen|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however A K and J @s would beat 3Nt|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, hmm, not overly convinced by a @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is wrong with a top spade to look at dummy?|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  seems as though partner is not going to have a killing suit anyhow|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  and the @S might well be the safer lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S could make only 2@C 3@D 2@H 1@S -|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like this will be let thru now only a club a heart and 2 spades for e/w|pg||
nt|duschek: I wonder if West could be squeezed into an endplay after @SA,K,J|pg||
nt|lestergold: the tempo given to declarer|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now np for N/S - can establish one @H more|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  still need to get that @S trick, EW might still  come to another @C|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: Good evening all|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  providing E ducks two rounds|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||

nt|lestergold: hi Jacob|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h4|nt|bridge_one: South is playing  perfectly|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: 1 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: but is he? didnt he need to preserve the link in diamonds|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  will have a count on the hand too, so will be no problem finding the endplay|pg||
nt|duschek: North/South do not form a regular partnership - Michael Askgaard usually plays with Gregers Bjarnarson; they have been part of the Danish national team for some 5 years|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no - he must play in this way - now no defence for West|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he cant go wrong eiother way|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|h3|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: that's true. However a British International collated stats about transferring with a five card major after a 1NT opening. Over three years, he found it was 70% correct to ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer. |pg||
pc|dT|nt|bridge_one: well done !|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, could have been imps either way there, but eventually surfaced on the danish side|pg||

nt|vugraphzpt: All before last round|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Hanging in there for directors ruling and final score|pg||
nt|poohbear: on board 26 Feldman hesitated in PO seat and his partner led dummy's first bid suit which I think was the right lead but wasnt at all clear to do|pg||

nt|vugraphzpt: I have no mor eknowledge than what you see there|pg||
nt|jbgood: great job David!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: The ruling will clearly affect P&L final position|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: The delay is ruling and gettting final scores delivered to me|pg||
nt|poohbear: so the @h lead might not be so wrong. If the directors had asked the first 3 experts and they all said a @s lead then as long as they were sure about the hesitation the ruling ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: would be made already|pg||
nt|poohbear: no ruling as of yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: OK the interesting part is as usual - the permanent partnerships again do well|pg||
nt|poohbear: So one minor point although it might not be relevant|pg||
nt|po-s: David, it would be sad if the reverse were true|pg||
nt|poohbear: The screen got pushed to Feldman who was the only person who had a chance to act so clearly it was his hesitation|pg||
nt|poohbear: Players give honest opinions|pg||
nt|poohbear: about the action the director asks |pg||
nt|po-s: how many did lead a heart?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|poohbear: this is the hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|po-s: I guess the bidding was similar at many tables|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Now West hesitated and East led a heart|pg||
nt|poohbear: which I think is the correct lead but not at all clearcut|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Not wanting to cast anything on anybody I would actively not lead a heart in this situation. |pg||
nt|jbgood: hesitated ,|pg||
nt|poohbear: anyway I am off to enjoy some Cavendish free food:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: why put myself in harms way - they cant call the director because I DIDNT lead a heart|pg||
nt|poohbear: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I await ruling and results|pg||
nt|henryb: Aren't Pepsi and Feldman on the same side, and couldn't Lev be thinking if for example he were 5-5 in the red suits?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: The screens dont help one always knows who is thinking based on the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: No screen runs top left to bottom right|pg||
nt|henryb: I mean Pepsi thinking|pg||
nt|henryb: Yes, but it could have been Pepsi thinking about whether to pass 3N|pg||
nt|henryb: the tray went to Pepsi and Feldman|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Which would you back Pepsi to be thinking of bidding over 3NT or partner doubling - anyway as I said why put yourself in harms way|pg||
nt|jbgood: of course S didnt have any bid|pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome back to Bon |pg||
nt|sybarra: *Bonn|pg||
nt|april7: something is wrong|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 tops|pg||
nt|po-s: I was here before, and then Mattsson played for Germany....|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Paul Heckett - Tony Waterlow for Journalists|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hackett|pg||
nt|po-s: better...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: depending also on distribution and honors - 10xxxx is different from QJ9xx|pg||
nt|duschek: Match started off with an interesting hand - let's hope it continues that way|pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 25 count for e/w looks like they will play this in 3N but cards are spitting at them|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: slam for e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|frankaus: @S partial looks to be the spot|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like 4 card suits strong NT by EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: cards all wrong for n/s to venture very far in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 7 cold in 3 denominations|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: grand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@D is a good start|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Thomas Gotard from Germany|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bonn-nations-cup.bridgeverband-westfalen.de/2009/liveticker/09_05_20_team.html  for running scores in all matches. The 16 teams are didvided into two groups. France ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: leading Group A|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: indeed, but 10xxxx is virtually useless in NT, whereas it might make some tricks if it is the trump suit|pg||
nt|duschek: I am not sure they will bid it though; West will invite, but East will probably decline with 16 HCP and a flat distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|boltonian2:  yes not the most attractive game, especially after a @C lead|pg||
mb|2N|nt|frankaus: may make 4 here|pg||
nt|sybarra: just going to say,  might make 4 |pg||
nt|frankaus: light red 4 NS as well|pg||
nt|april7: W will lose 3@C and 1 @H trick, because not enough entries for the finesses needed|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure 4 will make,  doesnt he lose 1 ht, 1 sp, and 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|frankaus: cant imagine any S not passing  so looks like more technical problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we are stuck via connex |pg||
nt|april7: 4th @S is also en entry, so 10 tricks are really available|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: anderson is still thinking|pg||
nt|frankaus: 0 H if W gets it all right|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure he has enough entries |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well here go |pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: its a seven depending on good hearts suit behaviour|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Well, North will be quite happy defending 2@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: possible also 2@S by West instead 2@C with 3S and a sgl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. But spades don't break either - not a nice hand for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Alex Wilkinson|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: Marsal/Mattson are no regular pdship, but I am sure they have played lots of boards together|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: so a nice bidding contest for them|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3/2 break and some 4/a breaks also|pg||
nt|lestergold: some 4/1 breaks too|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  good evening|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: @C@C@Cthen @D fionesse ,@H finesse ,@D and @H finesse ,@S  and another @H finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bonn-nations-cup.bridgeverband-westfalen.de/2009/Englisch/Englisch_00_Frame.html|pg||
nt|duschek: Sorry, can't count - with those 9 decent HCP West should bid game himself opposite partner's 15-17|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes 9 points with  good intermediates|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bridge_one: Hi Alex|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  I think I would have bid 2@S|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  but as you say, they don't break much better on this occassion|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Capital punishment in France if you support with three cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: :)|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  sounds reasonable|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  i will put off my plans to relocate there when I am older|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: website I have at moment |pg||
nt|lestergold: normal bidding normal lead and no play today sadly|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|projekt1: hi again|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Bonn for the annual Nations Cup. Seven 12-board matches in the round-robin. This is a match from round 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the lowest scoring of the 3 grands but as itys not mps it hardly mtters|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting that west rkc'd in hearts but opted fror the dim slam|pg||
nt|tomi2: Germany II is traditionaly the spot for players from the host Bridge Club (Bonn)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: nobody here from them in closed room ;-)|pg||
nt|tomi2: rkc in hearts gave hin all usefull information he needed|pg||
nt|lestergold: but could well be flat|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Shirley Ybarra, USA, Martin Carroll, Ireland, Josef Harsanyi and Avram Kreisberger, Germany. I am Roland Wald from Denmark|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Lukas Schenk|pg||
nt|april7: something is wrong with the name of the players|pg||
nt|mcarroll: its ok now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: hi... brd 13 was played already|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not anymore|pg||
nt|april7: now it might  be ok|pg||
nt|projekt1: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: 7@H   worst of grand slams    7NT  or 7@D  can make if north has 4 or 5 hearts and k@S  or has JXXX hearts and KJ@S|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi Josef|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: west probably opted for dims in case hearts didnt break and hoping that there would be alternative plays in 7d in that eventuality|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tomi2: yes and east had no reason to remove this|pg||
pc|d4|nt|april7: helpfull|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Let me find a link to the E-W convention card. They play an odd system called Dwururka|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with AQ8  for 10 in the dummy i think it is netter play small @C for the 10|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course not|pg||
nt|ady: 7@D  of course could go off to a ruff if north had 5 hearts|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d2|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|duschek: I would expect that too - E/W at the other table play a weak notrump but will certainly bid game after an auction resembling 1@D-1@H-1NT-3NT|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: well you cant deman 100 percent for a grand slam- you need better odds than for a small slam its true|pg||
nt|lestergold: no trump game if played by west may be let thru on spade lead tho|pg||
nt|duschek: South will lead a club there as well, choosing the better of his holdings in the unbid suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: but probably not even make then|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is one of those hands where you go a couple off and move on to the next board|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  I thought West might win and play a @D, but maybe figures has a reasonable chance of making if the finesse works|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|frankaus: 10|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.geocities.com/daniel_neill_2000/sys/Dwururka.txt|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: actually the club ruff probably didnt help n/s |pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@C = hearts  11+|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@D = spades  11+|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and so on|pg||

nt|Vugraphzqs: here is now the TD|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes and @C by declarer gave them another chance|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: because of the 3@h bidding|pg||
nt|april7: 1@C - 1@D -  !NT  - 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: sorry, because of the 2@s...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: it was explained by Pazur: invitational with shortage|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: but the explantation was on both sides the same so its ok now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: lets go to board 15 :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: in those short matches and tournaments of course luck is an important factor. you make decisions that will bring or cost you lots of imps and sometimes you need good breaks to make ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: your bidding successfull|pg||
mb|1C|nt|tomi2: http://www.bonn-nations-cup.bridgeverband-westfalen.de/2009/BBO_00_Frame.htm  the page with running scores|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 25 combined with long suits here for n/s but......|pg||
mb|1H|nt|frankaus: E will not pass this out LOL|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n does make|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  a bit short of 5@C, but not sure will stop short...|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: 3NT   or 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: nasty for East over 1@S |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  W will certainly bidding 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w can make up to 5h but at favourable even 6c is a good save|pg||
mb|1N|nt|april7: 11 tricks in NT or @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bonn-nations-cup.bridgeverband-westfalen.de/2009/liveticker/09_05_20_team.html  for running scores|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.geocities.com/daniel_neill_2000/sys/Dwururka.txt|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c too|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  ay some point|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bridge_one: If north pass sure lead @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@h is a surprise for me|pg||
nt|duschek: E/W make 5@H, and 6@C-X is down -300 on a diamond guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: exatly a profit|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  so is 2@H, his partner has passed once, might do again|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|tomi2: other room in 7@H on the last hand, so a small pick-up for the Dutch Juniors|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  might get to 2@H now, not sure how that will go|pg||
nt|mdgraham: flaws for double: only three hearts. Flaws for 2@C: empty suit. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: now DBL by East isn't penalty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it should be|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  ok, maybe they are :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think West would Dbl - can't be penalty ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i will be surprised if par is reached harly ever is in this sort of situation|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|frankaus: lights green many will psyche with N hand|pg||
nt|april7: no need for E to go to 4@H with his hand|pg||
nt|frankaus: i have an occasional pd that would bid 1NT with N - |pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s will compete to 5c i guess and then take their chances against 5h if its bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|duschek: I would rather leap to 4@H single-handedly - does not require that much from partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@C   the better contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes in 5c declarer can play for safety in clubs cashing ace and then leading up tothe club in 3n he has to take the club finesse to preserve communications|pg||
nt|lestergold: which would be a disaster for example if the stiff k was offside|pg||
nt|ady: might be right to duck first round of clubs|pg||
nt|tomi2: have been asked about the format. 16 teams were drawn into 2 groups and play a RR there. then only the first of each group reaches the final (I think 3 segments) while all others ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: play a swiss with full carryover|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, I am not convinced by 2@D, by they are not doubled so...|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  W should have decided what to do over 1@C, this seems a strange way to do things|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ady: tricky lead|pg||
nt|tomi2: Marsal tried to hit partners long suit? :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes probably is right to|pg||
nt|tomi2: in bridgebase he would quicly use the undo button and try to lead something else :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzqs: now its right ;-)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 2@H is playble for N/S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West has penalty-passed 1@S. So why is dbl of 2@C not penalty? |pg||
nt|bridge_one: the only way to play 4@H dbl ?|pg||
nt|duschek: Now who would have expected this auction?|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: such poor suits so bid NT ROFL|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he hit someones long suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: me no|pg||
nt|lestergold: west cannot have passed surely?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: still only 1 tricks|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, on this way, W will think his partner has been invited to the auction 3 times and not done anything|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i predicted non par but this atrocity is unbelievable|pg||
pc|h2|nt|boltonian2:  though in reality, partner could never have really evaluated the cards he needed anyhow|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|april7: 9 or 10 tricks if J of @D can produce a trick|pg||
pc|h7|pc|cQ|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: is there no reason to cash a of @H first or maybe even ak? |pg||
nt|april7: has to play @H now anyway|pg||
nt|bridge_one: bec 1@S DBL p p; 2@C DBL isn't penalty but means 2/3 @C ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: disagree.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so pass can be only 1@C (impossible) or a penalty hand|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  I dont think West thought this was going to end in 2@D nevertheless|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|sybarra: not sure I would have wasted the @S entry, but Kirmse must have a plan |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ady: might have been great for defence if east had led from jack six of clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: it would have been a horrible moment for north on the second round of clubs|pg||
nt|ady: yes    might well finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: however play will speed up and blood pressure will drop when he sees the pesky ten of clubs shortly|pg||
nt|ady: as it is no problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he seems to be very reluctant to advance that club but what else can he do now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: no technical problem, i am still here :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: whjat is north in the tank about?|pg||
nt|tomi2: every time I was operator in Bonn the players played so quickly that I could not follow the game|pg||
nt|duschek: In fact, bidding the West hand is not easy - wrong hand for an initial double, and difficult to show the hand otherwise. Perhaps 1@H and then 3@H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has not shown a fraction of his strength with his hanmd most of us would bid 4h immediately rather than drop out after a competitivie auction|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|cJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: no other source of anything remotely approaching nie tricks|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|boltonian2:  I would have favoured double, then 4@H, as W seems to strong in hight cards for a straight 4@Hs|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  especially with a void|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: if you've got a penalty hand, then you should double. Why wait for partner to do it for you?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: depending on agreements - many play how i told, but it is right also play natural and DBL by East penalty|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bridge_one: i use dbl at 1Nt to give strong hand - 3@H about same cards without one A |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: agreed, agreements matter, but once West passes 1@sx for penalties, reckon all doubles penalties|pg||
nt|lestergold: its absurd what he needs from his partner to make game is so little that his partner will often not be able to value his hand- a  little stuffing in spades and dims would usually ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: be enuf|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  not sure why E did not dble for penalty regardless of this argument, surely that should be penalty|pg||
nt|lestergold: well surely 13 imps away here|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh perhaps not misguessed diamodns|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  yes|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, 12 imps instead|pg||
nt|duschek: 12 imps only, then|pg||
mc|9|nt|april7: some odd plan E had to make only 10 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not much difference|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||

mb|4H|nt|mcarroll: @S slam on here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 tops in 3n but 5d looks the elegabt contract to bid|pg||
nt|ady: could make 6 diamonds   but not likely to get there      3NT   or 5@D   likely|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes set up a long heart to get rid of spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: and south cant lead spades of course|pg||
nt|tomi2: 6@D needs @SK with the leader and hearts 4-3?  those contracts only work, when you don't bid them|pg||
nt|ady: yes     if south leads a spade will have to run it|pg||
nt|duschek: E/W need to guess hearts at 5@H though|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, that is some bid by W, suppose has two good cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we get another chance |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  confident in partners michaels|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think n/s will be doubling e/w by the time they reach the 5 level|pg||
nt|lestergold: west's bid is clearcut|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West yes, East no dbl at level 5 with 66|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  NS aren't getting into this by the looks of things, that was one advantage of 4@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: 4@h - p - p - p|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well bought by EW|pg||
nt|bridge_one: similar auction in the open room, where North choise to bid 5@C instead pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think north has to bid 5c over 4h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzqs: the final was to fast for me...|pg||
nt|april7: 6@S but not 6 @H!!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes a good example of choosing the 4-4 fit being best|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: Just enter the final contract Lukas|pg||
nt|lestergold: so if 6d is bid east cant fail to make it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cards don't lie well here for EW|pg||
nt|bridge_one: could also open 1Nt - but in IMP with not passed hand from p, can be rigth give 5 good cards in @D|pg||
mc|11|nt|Walddk4: This takes too long|pg||
nt|mcarroll: There must be something wrong - all commentators agree on this one lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Letsomeone bid 5@S now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: then lead a card and claim|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so big swing for Croatia|pg||
nt|duschek: However, East had bid 4@C instead of 2@C, probably showing her 6-6, so she had no particular reason to bid her distribution a second time at the 5 level|pg||

mb|3N|nt|april7: just making|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 1n didnt look a good contract and this looks just as bad if not worse unofortunately|pg||
nt|lestergold: unlucky of course perfectly sensible bidding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S probably happiest player at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing in the 5/3 fit with the diabolical layout|pg||
nt|tomi2: there seems to be a problem with the liveticker, so we have no running results from the other matches|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer will lose 2c 3h and a spade at least and south may end up making all 4 of histrumps the pesky 3h ruffing the third round of clubs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bridge_one: unlucky slams - 6@h down with @S lead, 6@S down with @C lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: or not :)|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  6@S should be ok with the lucky @H situation|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as a point of method, I reckopn East owes his partner 4@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming that 2@H is forcing and 3@S unlimited|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: sorry for the wrong board|pg||
mb|5H|nt|duschek: Preferably with the @HKx(x) onside and no diamond lead|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well S should know now that N was willing all along to bid 4@H over 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but wont make in practice |pg||
nt|bridge_one: to make 12 tricks need to guess the figure of @H - but reasonable to call, making with the finesse|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  which might not have done with a weaker hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@H by South is perfect in my opinion|pg||
mb|6H|nt|boltonian2:  yes, I think I would too, has three aces, which seems good|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as he has limited his hand with 3@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: here comes a club back |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, probably another big swing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The percentage play for one loser in the heart suit is low to the 9 spot, which is also the winning line here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: SuitPlay whispered in my ear|pg||

nt|bridge_one: the line to play @H to 9 seam the right way to move the suit ... |pg||

nt|Walddk5: Let's see if 'Otto' knows his odds|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht to the nine will deserve some applause|pg||

nt|mdgraham: still, West has made his game, and seeing the breaks he'll be happy he wasn't higher|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks really excellent slam normal breaks you can throw it against the wall|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|boltonian2:  N apparently has a way of showing this 2 suiter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it is generally a good idea to bid your long suit here (1@D) and then spades later|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless you have a Gadget|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the reason because all pairs in Italy don't use to open 2Nt with minors is that the open give too much informations at opps if they could play in attack|pg||
mb|4S|nt|duschek: Askgaard in his partnership with Bjarnarson plays this kind of 2NT opener himself, showing at least 5-5 in the minors and below opening strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: so 2@C means @S/@D, so np for N to choise the bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: not keen on going negative with any hand - played too much rubber bridge when younger|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: NS have to develop their @D trick early to beat the contract|pg||
nt|april7: again 4@H |pg||
nt|tomi2: north will have to check the fit|pg||
nt|projekt1: 2Nt?|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  should be warned by the 2NT bid though|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: well south knows that his club suit is not lloking too great|pg||
nt|duschek: On the other hand, you will often be able to preempt effectively after such a 2NT opener - I guess this 2NT bid is more efficient as an opening bid than as an overcall over an ...|pg||
nt|duschek: enemy 1@H/@S opening bid|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: cards lay well for n/s  especially if west is played for one of the heart honors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now North could reopen with 3@D instead 3@S|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s3|pg||
nt|frankaus: here it comes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|boltonian2:  S could bid one more confidently with K10 and an A|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: presumably when north bid 2s he was looking to see if no trumps was the better spot?|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, I assume south had shown some @S support with this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I must say, I wonder where West got the double from |pg||
nt|bridge_one: The DBL by West is justified by sgl in @D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, yes, his bidding box...|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  hmm, not sure it is justification enough though|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  surely can't be surprised to see that @C void in dummy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i means sgl @D the reason to give a risk dbl|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: perhaps south was allowed to have only three hearts for example|pg||
nt|tomi2: think it is common to raise on 3 cards in the Netherlands, so playing in a Axxx - xxx fit while 3NT could be laydown or 4@S is not great|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes as i thought|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the lead wont hurt|pg||
nt|tomi2: i recently played some tourney with a Dutch player and was shocked how often I got raised on 3. then i stopped to bid bad 4 card suit and then we agreed on not raising on 3 :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I am sure if I doubled as west South would make two overtricks |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: 7s will leave declarer well place to take the double heart hook|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|duschek: You can take more liberties as an opener because the opponents have not shown that major suit yet|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bridge_one: me too :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: yep hes gone for it|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||

pc|d6|nt|frankaus: @C cant run away|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: true|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: now will make 5 one way or the other|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good timing by North|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|po-s: this time no overtricks but he surely plays it well|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and best defence by West|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, South will not reckon the spades are 3-3 - but he might have to assume it|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  ruff, and then spade to the A followed by a @H might not have been so good for S either|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now South has insurmountable entry problems, it would seem|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be @H from dummy the best line|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - unfortunately, Sothis in hand |pg||
nt|bridge_one: after K in West South is protected by @C return|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  yes, but a @C switch by E when in with the A@S might force dummy after that|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: now looks like 1 H, p 1 @S, p, 1 !NT |pg||
nt|lestergold: however here is a not so favourable layout!|pg||
nt|tomi2: this looks as if there is a loser in every suit after a @C lead|pg||

mb|4H|nt|bridge_one: but not vuln me too open 2@s|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  yep, I would too|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: not easy the bid by East with 4@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: my team lost to a Gold Cup match to the Hacketts last weekend - they are tough to play against |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: any idea what NT range they play?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: 1NT is 11-13|pg||

nt|frankaus: beer hand :)|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H made in OR    seems there could be 4 losers|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably without J in @D would choise Dbl|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  no, there is a case for passing, as you know partner could not do something with short @Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but they never got theirn club trick in the open room it must have gone on a spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 4/2 heart break and the spade layout could be awkawrd|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4/1 break i meant to type|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Vugraphzqs: i am very sorry dear spectators|pg||
nt|april7: @H lead ducking twice by E, but doesn< t help|pg||
nt|april7: but on @S lead @H switch very necessary|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1H = 4+ @C, 11+HCP|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  a good start for W too, maybe not all that simple|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|projekt1: who will switch to @c?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: they dont have to lead clubs they can switch before trumps are dealt with |pg||
nt|lestergold: providdeclarer has to play the spades carefully unless opps are kind enuf to open them for him|pg||
pc|h5|nt|duschek: Slightly awkward opening lead - the @DJx is unattractive, but there is no alternative|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: south switch |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: well, he might have @SKQJx |pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: even a dim now and then a club switch would beat it|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tomi2: south can now see the discard|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now it can be beaten onm a spade ruff so how was it made in the open room|pg||
nt|projekt1: and a @s-ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: it looks cold off|pg||
nt|tomi2: partner has showed 4 spades by playing @S4 and @S3 and could not cover the queen, so east has Kx|pg||
pc|c2|nt|boltonian2:  depends how he thinks is sat south :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|boltonian2:  *who|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: or when south takes heart trick   switch to either minor can beat it    mystery how it got through|pg||

nt|april7: @H from S|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  there was also a slight pause from Hacket, but that could just be screens, if they are in use|pg||

nt|tomi2: with clubs you bid 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West has to bid 3@h, as otherwise East will not know what major he has |pg||
nt|duschek: 3@H could be preemptive, but 2NT as a general invitation then|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bridge_one: yes, i mean a bid inviting, and not a direct game|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

nt|ady: 4@H should be down 1   as long as e/w defend correctly|pg||
nt|lestergold: they have to do it or the long dim will take care of teh club|pg||
nt|lestergold: but should be obvious|pg||
nt|lestergold: well  this can be made as cards lie dim finesse will take care ofcl ub loser and only one spade and 2 heart losers |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  might make|pg||
nt|duschek: We don't know the style of their weak jumps shifts though|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  probably not, but never know|pg||
nt|duschek: In Denmark, the common style is roughly 4-8 HCP with a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  @D finesse for the @C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: we don't know, but they know for sure !|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has to take the dim finesse now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: seam finesse in @D the only chance -|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  seems to be short, but considering 65 imps have flown in 7 boards, i am not ruling out anything|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant be postponed|pg||

nt|lestergold: but yes i think it is 1 off even so|pg||

mc|8|nt|boltonian2:  yes, though maybe has a bit of a guess|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  if W has 3@S instead of 2@D|pg||

nt|boltonian2:  yes but maybe AQ stiff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, South doesn;t know diamonds are 3-2 |pg||

nt|boltonian2:  he had a much better hand than his partner, as it happens|pg||
nt|lestergold: 8 tricks can be made if the defence is slow or inaccurate|pg||
pc|c5|nt|duschek: Tough opening lead|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|april7: should lose only 2@H, 1@S and 1 @D|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: well no chance now |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: funny how when you misguess like that, you always pick up a 0-count next hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: not even the square root of a chance and the lousy opener will reap its just desserts|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|duschek: All red honour cards being offside is not particularly lucky for West though|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the best switch|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the return @S is correct only if South want @H, so North must play there|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: when u open with that pile of grabage vul in 4thand note only a jack in the majors are u expeing to profit|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5d maybe is slightly sounder as it could make when a trick is lost to the Kd|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E can now relax|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: on a bad day nothing makes|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: and as we can se a downside is that when ur partner hasd the best/second best hand at the table he will put u overboard as here|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|tomi2: I will have to leave now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|duschek: Perhaps West decided he had to go for some action, remembering the huge losses and perhaps not recognizing he has some good boards too|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: some would have bid 3n with east hadn opposite a 4th in hand vulnerable opener|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: bye Tom|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c6|nt|tomi2: thx all, bye|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

nt|Vugraphzqs: board 22 starts soon|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: board 21 one down, but i dont know the contract|pg||
nt|ady: comedy of errors board 7 where 4@H got through    north led a spade from 4 to the 10  South won and returned a spade   north playing the 10 I assume to show a high card in diamonds ...|pg||
nt|ady:     when south won the Q@H  from QXXX   played a club  and now the contgract made becaause the spades were unblocked for the discard|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  I think that should have been 11 still, but...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: yes 11|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  thanks :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: looks like 3NT here too|pg||

nt|boltonian2:  no worry|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: multi|pg||
nt|lestergold: well had to be pretty erratic to let that thru...!|pg||
nt|duschek: Facing 1NT-X in the open room, a sensible 4th hand pass would have gained 5 imps instead of losing 1|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: 2 @D= multi,  major suit, like a wk 2 |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mcarroll: Glad to know it wasnt made on a winkle we failed to spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: and here a likely failing 4s due to everything horribly wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: gritt ur teeth and hope there is not 6 @S behind u :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: a winkle- this is a bridge site!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @HK, then a small club?|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  4@H or 3NT should be ok|pg||
nt|duschek: Slightly aggressive 1@H opener by Askgaard, but the final contract will probably be 3NT in any case|pg||
mb|2N|an|forcing with !s|mb|p|nt|lestergold: rofl|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S    down because of club ruff     3NT a possibility|pg||

nt|lestergold: well im surprised that no one bid game here- 4s doesnt look bad on paper|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  would seem like it, play south to have the A and shortage|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: W is not in the law but E opened vul. 2@D so must have some points|pg||
nt|april7: W should go 1 down, losing 2 @H, 1@S and 2 @D, but we will see|pg||
nt|duschek: Or will it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n surely|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  hmm, N has good cards|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  knows partner has a singleton @C now as well, I think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if 2Nt ask for distribution North must guess J in @C to call 3NT|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  might decide that 6@D or 6@H is a fairly reasonable shout|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: 8 card fit 24 combined point6s kc favourably placed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: the @H intemediates are missing unfortunately|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: wood back this contract to fails 95/100 or more|pg||
nt|lestergold: even game is not infrangible|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bridge_one: 3Nt is on finding AQ in @H in South, so it is reasonable|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: the fact that defenders have club ruff and ks is wrong is unlucky|pg||
pc|cT|nt|duschek: 4@H is more or less laydown. With the @CA9xx opposite a probable singleton, North might have bid 3@H|pg||

pc|s9|nt|boltonian2:  there are some puppet auctions that ask for 3 cards in @Ss too|pg||
