nt|pelu: close to a slam again - on the @DQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: and the clubs and @SK - but close :)|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|benjent:  The hidden bonus of ducking @sK is that NS will be doubting every finesse they take from now on|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3H|nt|ineg: but why not open 3@H?|pg||
nt|benjent:  with hearts 7-3, the odds heavily favour taking the @d finesse|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 3@H? - |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|pelu: I would openj 3@H (or even 4@H) - what would u open?|pg||

nt|benjent:  Kurka should get the @d suit right ....|pg||
nt|ineg: yes, I agree on 4@H but I prefer the safer bid if I have to play the hand :)|pg||

nt|pelu: S only exp 6 card suit in W - so odds very close|pg||
nt|benjent:  just in case @cQJ drop - and nice @cJ from Kopecky, trying to suck Kurka into the @c finesse|pg||
nt|benjent:  no, even with hearts 6-4, the odds still favour finessing diamonds|pg||
nt|pelu: will he count West for 3-6-2-2?|pg||
nt|benjent:  He'll be thinking about Kopecky heart plays. Can he trust low then J for 3?|pg||
nt|benjent:  He knows Kopecky is a tricky player|pg||
nt|ineg: W only promised 6 card H, did not open 3H so may be.... |pg||
pc|d5|nt|benjent:  the tell may be that West volunteered 3@h over 2NT - very unusual |pg||

mb|3H|nt|ineg: agree, dbl better and more flexible|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent:  I agree - prefer to show 12 cards instead of 5|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|pelu: and a X would get East in the bidding|pg||
nt|ineg: yes, wrong decision with hard punishment :(|pg||
nt|benjent:  unfortunately, overcalling has taken out his side's best competitive option (ie spades)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|pelu: not so hard - 4@SX would cost 300|pg||
nt|benjent:  as it happens, it's no big deal - 4@s is not particularly cheap, and 5@h makes, but it doesn't look good|pg||
