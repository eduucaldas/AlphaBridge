nt|lestergold: not  a bad 6 actually|pg||
nt|lestergold: cold played by south whenever there is no club lead ot club k onside|pg||
nt|chthonic: Getting to six would be a bit much, but it is a swing opportunity|pg||
nt|lestergold: well trhey had a strong 9 card fiut 29 combinde d points and excellent controls not that far fetched|pg||
nt|star6ija: fine, we will try to make something , thanks a lot |pg||
nt|col3435: there may be people around, it's not as busy with vugraphs as it was earlier|pg||
nt|star6ija: 9 IMPs sry|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@d from Nort's hand|pg||
nt|tomi2: 400 is always a good start into a teams tournament|pg||
nt|santyclz: On the nose.  |pg||
nt|april7: EW can make 4@S finding the Q of @S. If E opens 2@S S will bid 3@D and W 3@S and S wil be outbid|pg||
nt|april7: If E passes it might go 1@D 2@C - 2@S  and ?|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S depends on lead from S.in 3@S E will have to give up a @D playing from dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: do we have an intermission?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sybarra: this is "Danish"  as it is a movement in teams where  1 plays  2 |pg||
nt|vugraphb1: bad connection, sry all|pg||
nt|tomi2: but why do they play so early in the morning. Is Bulgaria in the same time zone as middle europe?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, 1 hour ahead|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 9:41 in Sofia|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, that is a little bit better :)|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: yes, 9.41 is here|pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@S for EW looks like a struggle here if NS get the Hearts going soon enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well a bit of a misfit hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s have a normal spade part score|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@h can not be made even if W misses @C lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@s is a good sacrifice even against game|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like 4@s has some play here and things are sitting pretty well for it.|pg||
nt|april7: 1 point missing|pg||
nt|ignatov_bg: hi all|pg||
nt|snorris: if e-w can sniff the @s situation there are 10 tricks|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|lestergold: but hard to  reach!|pg||
nt|chthonic: That overcall may have a negative result, since NS would surely be playing spades absent the bid|pg||
nt|Walddk5: But it's still in the middle of the night as far as I'm concerned|pg||
nt|tomi2: am no big fan of transfer overcalls after strong club|pg||
nt|Walddk5: There should be a law against playing at this hour|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a reopening double would have been interesting and pehaps a rather better bid|pg||
nt|star6ija: dokolkoto vijdam njamame komentatori|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6te opitam da buda polezen za analizite|pg||
nt|tomi2: you give your opponents a pass, a double, a cuebid and passing and later bidding/cuebidding|pg||
nt|april7: now E might go to 4@S by transfer|pg||
nt|skaftij: yes, likely east will play 2@s for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|snorris: dont expect them to bid it though|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|star6ija: nice job from EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|fifee: thank you, Roland|pg||
nt|oliverc:  Morning Patricia|pg||
nt|fifee: hello Oliver :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Presumably a smolen variant, showing a game force with 4@h and 5@s.|pg||
nt|skaftij: do we have their system cards?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chthonic: This board will not create a swing of any consequence.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 2h is that natural?|pg||
nt|chthonic: oops.  A transfer misinterpreted.???|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm told "presumably" was an underbid.|pg||
nt|april7: will not succeed with a @D lead but now has a xhance|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: I will try to catch someone, thanks for advice :)|pg||
nt|col3435: south has a nasty hand to lead from here|pg||
nt|star6ija: sistemata e datska|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: oh|pg||
nt|col3435: it does help that it's North's lead :)|pg||
nt|col3435: so declarer does have a guess to make here|pg||
nt|col3435: in trumps|pg||
nt|col3435: and I don't see any reason to get it right|pg||
pc|d9|nt|snorris: 2 @ds was -1..but natural to bid 2@s|pg||

nt|oliverc: This looks off now unless Declarer can get the Spades right|pg||

pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|chthonic: small|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s by north could hardly be misinterpreted|pg||
nt|chthonic: This is not a good start for north south|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is not an overtstament Craig|pg||
nt|oliverc: yup|pg||
nt|april7: but W will have to play the @S beeing 2-2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chthonic: Partnership discussions need to include unlikely auctions as well as the normal ones.|pg||

nt|santyclz: Note that s lead high from a doubleton.  That's not automatic in this part of the world.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chthonic: Are systems on after a balancing 1N?)  Does that include transfers into the overcalled suit?|pg||

nt|tomi2: and facing an passed opp! he can not run in that much of trouble|pg||

nt|oliverc: No, you're right, always 2 losers|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: looks like it |pg||

nt|fabsayc: well called charles|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: on best defence|pg||
nt|chthonic: It would -- or will -- be interesting to see the effect on EW of an opening bid.  Whether there is sufficient competition to bid 5C|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to sit tight with this misfitting evenly divided hand ifpard cant bid again then must defnd 2s|pg||
nt|tomi2: he preferes to be endplayed in the opening lead maybe :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: -800|pg||
nt|skaftij: certainly West has a 3@h bid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|star6ija: @c to the Queen @s to the Ace and another @s for throw-in|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lets see if they can max the defense for 800|pg||
nt|charles_l: ruff with stiff trump is a good start :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: then AK spades, spade overruff and trumps|pg||

pc|d5|nt|charles_l: still on road to 800s-ville though|pg||
nt|charles_l: duck a club seems a good ploy?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: way too simple for NS|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: now north judged wisely or not to pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially at unfavourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|star6ija: Most probably Danailov will try to cash 3 @h now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|col3435: west would love partner to double of course, but that seems a lot to hope for|pg||
nt|lestergold: For benefit of specs i do not know any of these players|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps I should|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|nt|charles_l: trump needed from E now|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i am commentating on the bridge as i find it played|pg||
nt|tomi2: West should duck this|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|snorris: and 3 @hs as inviting|pg||
nt|snorris: if they use Lebenshol|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|tomi2: but I guess the result here will not change the score on the board since I expect other room will score -600 or -630|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|lestergold: south's five spade bid was incorrect- he had no reason to contradict his partner's suggestion that they defend|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: had he showed his weak two suiter then he would have not placed himself in this position partner would kbnow exactly what he had|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|charles_l: but he is still hoping for his @H ruff|pg||
nt|charles_l: @s10=s/p for @h|pg||
nt|charles_l: discard @hJ best|pg||
pc|cA|nt|col3435: so perhaps it would have been advisable to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|fifee: The Bulgarians have some great players. Do we have a website for this event?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3 boards in 40 minutes is going for the roland slow list|pg||
nt|charles_l: maybe the open room will overtake us, then we get some comparisons|pg||
nt|skaftij: probably the double by East was clearly defined|pg||
pc|c5|nt|col3435: partner doesn't have much but it still makes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Murat Molva|pg||
nt|star6ija: the generator made very interesting boards for the final rounds|pg||

pc|c4|nt|MolvaM: re hi everyone|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|skaftij: nor clearly defined|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: west is lucky in that some of north's trumps will be mangled in the cross fire|pg||
nt|charles_l: but 4 undertricks have been mysteriously turned into 2.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: order all four of them double espresso coffees|pg||

mb|p|nt|skaftij: only this morning, I watched a pair double 2@s for penalties where they had 7@hs laydown!|pg||

nt|santyclz: While I'm a big believer in showing support early, in this case n had so much to describe 3@c somewhat preempted the auction.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently although nt sort of fits also|pg||
nt|skaftij: 3 @d = bad suit, minimum?|pg||
nt|snorris: think so..looks like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Have to play diamonds correctly to do it, I think|pg||
nt|charles_l: now 3@s shows stop|pg||

nt|vugraphb1: good morning|pg||

nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and good morning to Murat Molva|pg||
nt|tomi2: West had the options of playing a spade through and giving a heart ruff after his partner underlead his @C ace. I think E should signal his intent with the card he plays. Leading a ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: low coub = heart ruff and a high one, as the 5 was imo, ="play a spade first"|pg||
nt|charles_l: when 2 suits are unbid, cue SHOWS a stop.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: overboard I wonder?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chthonic: Could have problems on a club lead...?  |pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi everyone :) good morning|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: is there a "right" way to play that @D holding |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure |pg||
nt|chthonic: Can they find first nine tricks?.... Probably|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tomi2: as a spec points out, this looks like a gazilli auction|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n more chance than 4s because of the 4333 mirror|pg||
nt|skaftij: this will not be a problem|pg||
nt|snorris: no 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: however i can see 3 spades 3 hearts a club and a dim where is the ninth coming from?|pg||
nt|tomi2: allowes them to stay in partscore with that non fitting hands, but not in 2@D, since that would show "any 8+ hand"|pg||
pc|h7|nt|MolvaM: friendly distribution but declarer has to manage the spade suit|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: mind you if they get it right its only4 off for 400|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 0.04 start|pg||
nt|april7: now 2@C is game forc. but not in hand  2|pg||
nt|april7:  1|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: 2 @C over 1@H/@S is GF /ONLY if rebid @Cs = invitation with 6+ @C/|pg||
nt|skaftij: safest to duck a @d|pg||
nt|snorris: or 12 if s raises @hs|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is mistake from N|pg||
nt|lestergold: and north /south may well develop 2 long hearts along with the spade and the 2 clubs in the rqce in any case|pg||
nt|star6ija: this ruff with the @D Jack looks very starnge|pg||
nt|oliverc: no fairytale here, then|pg||

nt|moen: yes|pg||
nt|santyclz: One of the under appreciated benefits of a strong @c system is the ability to make a reverse on a hand like this.|pg||
nt|skaftij: strange pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: kq doubleton lub not pulling its full weight|pg||
nt|star6ija: EW are not original partners, but probably Nanev assumed that Ivanchev had @Ds|pg||

nt|chthonic: NS might get too high.|pg||

nt|april7: making 2,3 or 4 depending on @C play and @S finesse, but will not risk @C finesse in only 2@S but in 4 E had to|pg||
nt|snorris: very now?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|santyclz: West's red honors have become golden.|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes.  It lets you get your suits into the auction in length order.  But there are other gadgets for hands like that (like a nonforcing jump reverse I used to play)|pg||
nt|othered1: But I'd reverse this hand in standard as well.  Sound 4-loser, pure hand can be bid up a bit.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ignatov_bg: 2NT = 6+@D max|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he bid the suit twice, should be void really|pg||
pc|dA|nt|col3435: mind you, it looks like he'll regret it|pg||
nt|skaftij: certainly when North does not double, he must bid 5@d|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|fifee: easier if declarer gets the @D lead and ruff|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: only a dim part score and i cant see them resting in one|pg||

nt|lestergold: position|pg||
nt|star6ija: I am sure that he plays this convention with his original partner|pg||

nt|snorris: a @s is the obvious choise|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chthonic: Especially if I were on lead...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: Looks like there was some system confusion here.  4@D, nonforcing, seems misguided|pg||
nt|charles_l: maybe 1@d=0+@d, and 3@d showed extra length? ;)|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: All for naught.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|MolvaM: now the club guess|pg||

nt|snorris: no|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chthonic: West, that is|pg||
nt|chthonic: Have to lose three spades and a club in this contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s might have a play if the spades were 3/3 but as it is 4 top losers|pg||
nt|MolvaM: interesting 2nt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but karakolev didnt have many good alternative bids I guess|pg||

nt|charles_l: another 1min hand taking 6min|pg||
nt|charles_l: 6N is an excellent contract if W can play it|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H by W orE|pg||
nt|snorris: 6 @ds is good|pg||
nt|snorris: and 6 nt|pg||

nt|chthonic: occurred in the other room after a preempt.  It looked like a misunderstanding in this room would have been the problem, but it paled in comparison.  |pg||

nt|skaftij: or even squeeze|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tomi2: yes, playing 11-13 NT is more effective non vuln|pg||

mb|3H|nt|chthonic: Oh, I misread the auction|pg||
nt|ritong: and here, also, balancing with a double holding @s KJ makes few sense, since pard can hardly have a penalty doiouble for @ss|pg||
mb|4C|nt|MolvaM: 2@h opening might have stopped NS to find their game|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Dimitar Kapitanski|pg||
nt|othered1: There are many ways to handle west's hand -- subject to your agreements.  Stayman, bailing out in 2M, is one, if available as here.|pg||
nt|othered1: Some play 2@S invitational on this auction, but EW apparantly don't, since west's hand is really pushy for an invite|pg||

pc|h3|nt|chthonic: 4S would have been a level lower and a better result....|pg||

pc|c3|nt|lestergold: why no obvious spade lead|pg||

nt|lestergold: but this was absurd west should have bid his hand to begin with|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting north opened a dim in open room takeout double so e/w played inm their making pat score|pg||
nt|lestergold: but no great damage done on the hand|pg||
nt|jaheim: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: but on a prvious deal, we saw that rumen does not consider things under this angle|pg||
nt|kapitanski: very strong team qualification  for national team in  Sofia..|pg||
nt|santyclz: Pity n didn't have a @h or @c left, we'd have seen a smother play on defense.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bizarre, did he ask how hearts split or something|pg||
nt|charles_l: i would|pg||
nt|skaftij: North is likely to declare and make 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: good score from the open room for EW|pg||
nt|april7: I know, this is what kept us alive for so many thousands of years|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Well, they did not bid 2S on that other hand.. and DOUBLED the 3NT contract, receiving a SPADE !! lead|pg||
nt|chthonic: Nice|pg||
nt|lestergold: should have made a raise showing defensive values so that east would know not to push to the five level|pg||
nt|chthonic: Al Roth would turn over in his grave... to open that 1S.|pg||
nt|lestergold: an unassuming cue bid raise with his 12 count for example|pg||
nt|MolvaM: open room didnt find the S hand worth opening|pg||
nt|ritong: on board 2, he overcalled for the single reason that he held 13 cards|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes but its kind of strange to me that they on't let the team play that was so well in last years Europeans|pg||
nt|kapitanski: ilko Bonev was  champion  in Bulgaria  in 1985  like  said  my friend  Marinchev|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lestergold: this bidding must surely be wrong or for the next hand more likely??|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|chthonic: But it has/had preemptive value|pg||
nt|lestergold: ??|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it is important to play 3NT from east but declarer still has 8 tricks unless south leads a heart|pg||
nt|tomi2: Bulgaria finished 4th as far as I remember and so qualified for the Bermuda Bowl this year in Brazil|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chthonic: And on board 4, where 1NT was set three vulnerable tricks, North in the other room overcalled 2C... P P P.|pg||
nt|chthonic: So there will be another swing.|pg||
nt|lestergold: again west does not want to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it ahappens 4h should not make on best defence|pg||
nt|chthonic: That one adverse to our NS team|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west has a clear cut bid of 3h|pg||
nt|chthonic: No... adverse to our EW team.  Sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: now north opens and east cant bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: In Germany teams who achieve such qualification are always allowed to play the event they qualified for|pg||
nt|santyclz: If any hand deserved upgrading for spots, west's certainly qualifies.|pg||
nt|othered1: Not easy to  find @S at a low level here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|chthonic: Board 5, that is.|pg||

nt|skaftij: tempting to cashthe king and lead a @d|pg||

nt|santyclz: I'd rate w's hand at about 17.5 points, wonder what k&r say?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|MolvaM: declarer will duck a heart to see if something good happens.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: still has to find the @cq|pg||
nt|tomi2: so since the players are always improving their score, there have been no trials for 6 years now. Only from time to time a pair or one player has been replaced.|pg||

mb|2C|nt|chthonic: It played from the other side  -- south -- in the other room and on a heart lead, only going up ace from dummy retains the tempo.... very tough, indeed.|pg||

nt|kapitanski: in Bulgaria  not so many  players but  both of them are  very  strong...and  not  be  suprice  here  to wiin  any  team|pg||
nt|santyclz: Pretty close to a 50% slam here.|pg||
nt|charles_l: 1@c 16+ 1@d 0-7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like change the club 2 and 6 it makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Seems that the heart suit is the key.|pg||
nt|chthonic: OK, this hand...|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I dont like a RDBL with a good fit for pd|pg||
nt|snorris: 2nt east and 3@cs west?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|othered1: Here's another strong 2-suiter in east.  Again only 14 HCP, but . . . |pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: 4@S should be off|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|lestergold: 4s here is nopt incidentally that great acontract it makes because the spades behave and the hearts are 3/3|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: last board on this tournament|pg||
nt|oliverc: @D ruff|pg||
nt|fifee: with the @D ruff |pg||
nt|oliverc: but solid if NS don't find it immediately|pg||
nt|othered1: Here 3@S has to be a long suit.  Had north not bid, @S might have been looking for help|pg||
nt|santyclz: I can't use k&r at all, I get a "you do not have permission..." when I try,|pg||
nt|santyclz: W is surely worth 4@d regardless.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: lets hear the brakes screech soon |pg||
nt|skaftij: I like 2@hs. You never know with these hands if you double 1@s and it goes 3@s pass pass|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|MolvaM: Aj9873 is a nice overcall I think at this vul|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@s preempt willbe costly|pg||
nt|charles_l: E:"your @cs weren't strong enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphb1: ty all, see you soon|pg||
nt|col3435: lots of awkward part-score hands in this round|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: after about 10 min.|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart lead creates the 8th trick|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Best to have a six card suit at the two level|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but reasonable after ivanchev bid 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: ty all|pg||
mb|4S|nt|col3435: seems that everything goes off at the moment|pg||
nt|ritong: bulgarian style, i like it|pg||
nt|snorris: not hte best spot|pg||
nt|snorris: the|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or they blast it being behind |pg||
nt|MolvaM: there goes the diamond trick|pg||
nt|chessmaste: That lead will not paralyse declarer|pg||
nt|pelu: I agree, Mark, are u getting old? :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it seems the board will be flat now|pg||
nt|charles_l: 4@s is down on @h lead, so 5@s is down even more|pg||
mb|4N|nt|chthonic: It makes, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|chthonic: Sure.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Not yet!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: will go for 500|pg||
nt|moen: 500 ag 480,,1 imp|pg||
nt|kapitanski: end of the  board? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: unfortunately not|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|ritong: first bid game, then try to make it  that is their idea about game tries, and i agree fully:)|pg||
mb|5N|nt|chthonic: Lose spade, heart, club|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east knows that if he doesnt bid then his partner will never be in anything|pg||
nt|oliverc: next :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure -- @Sxxxx isn't a plus, unless east has 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: east knows its only 5 @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: it seems both Nort's had poor memories of overcalling with such hands|pg||
nt|april7: no entry for the 4th @S, so E might go down, ut has the 9th trick in @H|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|vugraphb1: bye|pg||
pc|h3|nt|MolvaM: now Nanev knows that the opps have a slam.  could teammates have bid that?|pg||
nt|snorris: so maybe should bid 2nt |pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphb1: see you soon|pg||
nt|lestergold: the nonth could come from spades but declarer will probably try the clubs|pg||
nt|april7: but will go down if S switchs to @C after K of @D|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: Popov is thinking|pg||
nt|april7: playing the J but still has time after @H tricks, now even possible 3down|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chthonic: Assuring a diamond ruff and a push.|pg||
nt|lestergold: lucky here they flatten the board playing in the same dodgy spade game|pg||
nt|kapitanski: yes they  (rumen-kalin)  play  their  sistem....1@c  weak NT or  strong (GF)hand|pg||
nt|ritong: oki  ty|pg||
nt|ritong: so 1@d is anything which does not fit with that|pg||
nt|kapitanski: nasko-toni play  their  precision  variant.|pg||
nt|oliverc: Why is Joey Silver never here when you need him?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1: On previous hand, KR evaluates west's 15 count as 17.65|pg||
nt|skaftij: yes I think so|pg||
nt|skaftij: it probably shows a better hand|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|chthonic: when the spade ten falls|pg||
nt|lestergold: i predict this will go off|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|charles_l: they are playing 6@c in 5@c, so 13imps to NS i imagine|pg||
nt|april7: E should have taken ace of @H first trick and religh on ace of @C with S|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|sybarra: on his way |pg||
nt|chthonic: no uppercuts lying around loose|pg||
nt|lestergold: no i stand corrected|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can t get at their spade trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: what about spade switch now and then heart back|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: Ivanchev is thinking|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think only card to beat this contract is Js|pg||
nt|snorris: 2nt might mean something else from what he had|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: 8 spads not good enuf|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok thanks everyone :)|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: see you after 5-10 min.|pg||
nt|fifee: he has lots of clones :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: not restricted choice in @s, surely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could not handle 3-1 spades, dont think restricted choice should be applied|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes i think so too|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|lestergold: the spades will be blocked now|pg||
nt|oliverc: lol|pg||
nt|april7: rely|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well declarer has to take ace of spades but he didnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: so contract now off on heart return|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chthonic: Just has to guess hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: impossible for declarer to read that situation so east got away with a loose card- the J was a killer against all plays by north|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|MolvaM: @h2 asked for a heart return probably|pg||
nt|april7: cash ace of @H and endplay N with 4th @S|pg||
nt|skaftij: why did West not open 2@h? Answer= only 5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chthonic: except imaginary ones|pg||
nt|lestergold: yeh but there was also a question of the third dim- if a trump is drawn it cant be ruffed in dummy and needs a long heart for a discard|pg||
nt|lestergold: needing hearts 3/3|pg||
nt|tweety1: seems he will endplay|pg||

nt|april7: 1@S 1NT X or 2@S,lets see!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ritong: east will double 1@h, so south will probably bid at the three level|pg||
mb|d|nt|santyclz: So my 17.5 wasn't too far off.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|othered1: In an aggressive game, north and east might open (north with weak 2 at this vul)|pg||
nt|charles_l: 9 tricks in @s for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: will E double one more time?|pg||
nt|charles_l: W might bid too much though|pg||
nt|skaftij: 3@c looks ugly but PD has 4 card support for either minor if not 2-5-3-3|pg||
nt|snorris: 5 @ds is a winner if you guess the @ss|pg||
mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|ritong: if allowed to, he shoulmd|pg||
nt|fifee: are we looking at the right hand :)|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ritong: should*|pg||
mb|p|nt|kapitanski: interesting  ....|pg||
nt|skaftij: 3 NT easier|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: from his hand, 4@s just needs some @ss and a good card|pg||
nt|april7: to high even if playing @S for no losers by double finesse|pg||
nt|snorris: maybe..|pg||
nt|skaftij: take @h ace and play 6@d, west will have great fun|pg||
nt|snorris: but after the 2@c bid its easy to place the ace of @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|charles_l: coffee time people. on past form this will take 8 min|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h7|nt|kapitanski: "knock out"  reglament|pg||
pc|d2|nt|charles_l: :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: wow*|pg||
nt|ritong: venomous double:)|pg||
nt|oliverc: 1@S from South possibly a Forcing No Trump-style of bid. That's quite a common|pg||
nt|oliverc: treatment for Precision|pg||
nt|fifee: true :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: will succeed at first sight|pg||
nt|ritong: only three losers, but tough to make ten tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: nothing works|pg||
nt|ritong: ruffing @cs, south pre_ruffs|pg||
nt|kapitanski: -300|pg||
nt|othered1: Here west did open a big @C.  And KR evaluates this 16 count at 17.7|pg||
nt|skaftij: especially after @hQ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|snorris: nobody belived south was going to finesse @s|pg||
pc|hA|nt|april7: an unnecessary 3@S bid by E|pg||
nt|april7: Q of @S|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ritong: ruffing @hs, a trump trick is established or defense|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: This will be easy.  At worse, west can trust the lead and set up another @H|pg||
nt|othered1: at worst|pg||
nt|santyclz: Magic @s position.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|fifee: but curious that N would bid 3@S here if that were the case|pg||
pc|h6|nt|april7: 2 down now|pg||
pc|d5|pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: bad prediction|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|ritong: east is sure about 4/1 trump break, if not worse, so his target is to minimize the loss|pg||
nt|santyclz: Partner, you never return my leads!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|oliverc: If 1@S was natural (and not alerted, apparently) it does seem curious, and 3@S|pg||
nt|oliverc: certainly seems a gross overstatement of North's hand|pg||
nt|april7: 1 trickpresent|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|santyclz: Lots of tricks, but both black suits are blocked.|pg||
nt|othered1: with the @S coming down (but declarer doesn't know it) there is no way to stop this.  In fact, double-dummy, n orth must now cash.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: did the director load his gun|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tomi2: in hand 4 where gazillii allowed NS to stop in 3@D, the OR bid 3nt and failed badly, so next huge swing to NS|pg||
nt|ritong: yes that hand was excellent for NS here|pg||
nt|othered1: conceding the contract, but best for NS|pg||
