mb|p|nt|vugraphzku: S said to E "You saw my declarer's play and decided to double ;)"|pg||
nt|henryb: and I have no understanding as to why North would raise to 3N|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: this auction and the final contract look quite logical (except the double perhaps)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 2NT was invitational|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: so he knows his partner has sth|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||

nt|capercliff: yes very good defence|pg||
nt|paulg: momentum plays a significant part in these 16 board sets and N/S definitely have it after the first two boards|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|bridge_one: weak @S + minor - muideberg style|pg||
mb|p|nt|pkl: 12 stik, tror jeg|pg||
nt|iain sime: We don't have communication to the other room, but I can tell you that Steel won 4 on 1 and 10 on 2, so leads 14-0.|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|boltonian2:  part score battle now, EW good for|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  3@S|pg||
nt|paulg: i like to be able to bid clubs over a short 1@c|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  at this vul I imagine Cuthbertson will come in at some point later|pg||
nt|capercliff: unless they bid lots of @s first|pg||
nt|paulg: sure, but an immediate 3@c would probably have scooped the pot|pg||
nt|iain sime: EW scored 300 in the other room.|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  though if McGinley bids a @S they will be in four before that can happen|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  maybe W will only bid 3|pg||
nt|capercliff: I would imagine 3@c is not natural for some reason|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  an easy 4@S should steady things though|pg||
nt|paulg: another thin game that will probably fail|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  though, as you say, it is going off|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ebrok: Et ligespil her, ikke efter Schaltz hoved|pg||

pc|d5|nt|pkl: .... men 3 af tre er 12.5% ... vi har vist alle været i dårligere slemmer|pg||
nt|capercliff: hmm|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  hmm, not where we imagined this auction would end up|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is interesting indeed|pg||
nt|iain sime: playing equal level conversion, 2D does not show extras.|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  no, though I think I would still have gone for 3@C with the N hand|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  ok, on the plus side we now have communication with the other room|pg||
nt|iain sime: We seem to have established a link with the other room, so should get comparisons.|pg||
nt|paulg: Howie-McGinley are a conservative pair and so far this has not been working to their advantage|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|paulg: Walker is a passed hand|pg||
nt|capercliff: the N bid is what I was wondering about|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|boltonian2:  me too, unless W thought 3NT might still be the intended spot|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|paulg: i think most top players would respond 1@s on this hand for instance|pg||
nt|capercliff: how many brds per set?|pg||

pc|cT|pc|s8|pg||
pc|dA|pc|sT|nt|paulg: this 2@c response to the takeout double is something that Cuthbertson-Walker have clearly not discussed .. or remembered|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulg: sound defence from Steel and McGeorge|pg||

nt|bridge_one: correct|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bridge_one: the jump at 3@D with normal hand but good suit is usewd today by many players|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: East have for sure 2 of 3 cards hight - so small from dummy is the best|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|boltonian2:  :)|pg||

nt|boltonian2:  the auction looks pretty standard|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|iain sime: Seems to have reached a fairly ugly game though. |pg||

nt|bridge_one: no gazzilli (2@H isn't contemplate in gazzilli with 2 cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so may be they play without a GF open, similar to Fantoni Nunes|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|capercliff: X just in case they play in a @c slam|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: if it is a special gazzilli, then 3@S after 2@H need with Kx in @C and 10 hcp with QJx n @S|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2diamonds could be Bart, and this sequence shows 9-10 points ( I play exactly two spades)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|iain sime: first round control.|pg||
nt|paulg: 4@h may be ambiguous here -- last train or cue bid or both|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  why are you more pushed on a @D lead? it is all on the @S play isn't it|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|werge: 5 @D spør´ vel efter trumf dame|pg||
nt|ebrok: sikkert|pg||

nt|boltonian2:  not sure you need the entry|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  5 might actually be more difficult than 6 though|pg||
nt|paulg: hard for Walker to see 5-6 opposite|pg||
nt|mowen: is it reasonable to cash @SAK and play the same hand for 3@Ss and 3@Cs|pg||
nt|capercliff: Walker might take some time with this one|pg||
nt|paulg: Walker takes time on most hands ... I think Cuthbertson is the only fast player at the table|pg||
nt|capercliff: safety play must be to finesse @s twice anyway no?|pg||
nt|mowen: not so good if the finesse loses|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||

nt|mowen: low heart now?|pg||
nt|paulg: i guess ducking the diamond in case spades are 4-1 offside|pg||
