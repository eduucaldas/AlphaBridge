nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Bonn for the annual Nations Cup. Seven 12-board matches in the round-robin. This is a match from round 3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Martin Carroll, Ireland, Josef Harsanyi, Germany, Mike Gold and David Edwin, England. I am Roland Wald from Denmark|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Mike from England here|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi David|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Lukas Schenk|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Hi David, Mike|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: Welcome to Round Robin 3rd: Germany II - Netherlands|pg||
nt|ady: hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie hard not to see 10 tricks for n/s but nmot really a biddable game|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  might make  on a low diamond lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: now its right|pg||
nt|lestergold: now the bidding fits |pg||

nt|lestergold: what is going on here?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzqs: yes, its board 1! no mistake ;-)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But the bidding does not match the cards they have|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At least not the cards *we* have|pg||

nt|jbgood: great job David!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: The ruling will clearly affect P&L final position|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: The delay is ruling and gettting final scores delivered to me|pg||
nt|poohbear: so the @h lead might not be so wrong. If the directors had asked the first 3 experts and they all said a @s lead then as long as they were sure about the hesitation the ruling ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: would be made already|pg||
nt|poohbear: no ruling as of yet|pg||

nt|poohbear: So one minor point although it might not be relevant|pg||
nt|po-s: David, it would be sad if the reverse were true|pg||
nt|poohbear: The screen got pushed to Feldman who was the only person who had a chance to act so clearly it was his hesitation|pg||
nt|poohbear: Players give honest opinions|pg||
nt|poohbear: about the action the director asks |pg||
nt|po-s: how many did lead a heart?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|po-s: I guess the bidding was similar at many tables|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Now West hesitated and East led a heart|pg||
nt|poohbear: which I think is the correct lead but not at all clearcut|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Not wanting to cast anything on anybody I would actively not lead a heart in this situation. |pg||
nt|jbgood: hesitated ,|pg||
nt|poohbear: anyway I am off to enjoy some Cavendish free food:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: why put myself in harms way - they cant call the director because I DIDNT lead a heart|pg||
nt|poohbear: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I await ruling and results|pg||
nt|henryb: Aren't Pepsi and Feldman on the same side, and couldn't Lev be thinking if for example he were 5-5 in the red suits?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: The screens dont help one always knows who is thinking based on the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: No screen runs top left to bottom right|pg||
nt|henryb: I mean Pepsi thinking|pg||
nt|henryb: Yes, but it could have been Pepsi thinking about whether to pass 3N|pg||
nt|henryb: the tray went to Pepsi and Feldman|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Which would you back Pepsi to be thinking of bidding over 3NT or partner doubling - anyway as I said why put yourself in harms way|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ady: grand|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bonn-nations-cup.bridgeverband-westfalen.de/2009/liveticker/09_05_20_team.html  for running scores in all matches. The 16 teams are didvided into two groups. France ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: leading Group A|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: indeed, but 10xxxx is virtually useless in NT, whereas it might make some tricks if it is the trump suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: may make 4 here|pg||
nt|sybarra: just going to say,  might make 4 |pg||
nt|frankaus: light red 4 NS as well|pg||
nt|april7: W will lose 3@C and 1 @H trick, because not enough entries for the finesses needed|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure 4 will make,  doesnt he lose 1 ht, 1 sp, and 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|frankaus: cant imagine any S not passing  so looks like more technical problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we are stuck via connex |pg||
nt|april7: 4th @S is also en entry, so 10 tricks are really available|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: anderson is still thinking|pg||
nt|frankaus: 0 H if W gets it all right|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure he has enough entries |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well here go |pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: its a seven depending on good hearts suit behaviour|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Well, North will be quite happy defending 2@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: possible also 2@S by West instead 2@C with 3S and a sgl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. But spades don't break either - not a nice hand for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Alex Wilkinson|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tomi2: Marsal/Mattson are no regular pdship, but I am sure they have played lots of boards together|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tomi2: so a nice bidding contest for them|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3/2 break and some 4/a breaks also|pg||
nt|lestergold: some 4/1 breaks too|pg||

nt|boltonian2:  I think I would have bid 2@S|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  but as you say, they don't break much better on this occassion|pg||

nt|lestergold: interesting that west rkc'd in hearts but opted fror the dim slam|pg||
nt|tomi2: Germany II is traditionaly the spot for players from the host Bridge Club (Bonn)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: nobody here from them in closed room ;-)|pg||
nt|tomi2: rkc in hearts gave hin all usefull information he needed|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Not anymore|pg||
nt|april7: now it might  be ok|pg||
nt|projekt1: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: 7@H   worst of grand slams    7NT  or 7@D  can make if north has 4 or 5 hearts and k@S  or has JXXX hearts and KJ@S|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi Josef|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: west probably opted for dims in case hearts didnt break and hoping that there would be alternative plays in 7d in that eventuality|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tomi2: yes and east had no reason to remove this|pg||
pc|d2|nt|april7: helpfull|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Let me find a link to the E-W convention card. They play an odd system called Dwururka|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with AQ8  for 10 in the dummy i think it is netter play small @C for the 10|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course not|pg||
nt|ady: 7@D  of course could go off to a ruff if north had 5 hearts|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: well you cant deman 100 percent for a grand slam- you need better odds than for a small slam its true|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is one of those hands where you go a couple off and move on to the next board|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  I thought West might win and play a @D, but maybe figures has a reasonable chance of making if the finesse works|pg||

nt|Vugraphzqs: here is now the TD|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes and @C by declarer gave them another chance|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: because of the 3@h bidding|pg||
nt|april7: 1@C - 1@D -  !NT  - 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: sorry, because of the 2@s...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: it was explained by Pazur: invitational with shortage|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: but the explantation was on both sides the same so its ok now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: lets go to board 15 :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: in those short matches and tournaments of course luck is an important factor. you make decisions that will bring or cost you lots of imps and sometimes you need good breaks to make ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: your bidding successfull|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: http://www.bonn-nations-cup.bridgeverband-westfalen.de/2009/BBO_00_Frame.htm  the page with running scores|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 25 combined with long suits here for n/s but......|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: E will not pass this out LOL|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n does make|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: 3NT   or 5@C|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: nasty for East over 1@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 11 tricks in NT or @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bonn-nations-cup.bridgeverband-westfalen.de/2009/liveticker/09_05_20_team.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Look at the CC I gave you for explanations of bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.geocities.com/daniel_neill_2000/sys/Dwururka.txt|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c too|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: If north pass sure lead @S|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|tomi2: other room in 7@H on the last hand, so a small pick-up for the Dutch Juniors|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  might get to 2@H now, not sure how that will go|pg||
nt|mdgraham: flaws for double: only three hearts. Flaws for 2@C: empty suit. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: now DBL by East isn't penalty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it should be|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  ok, maybe they are :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think West would Dbl - can't be penalty ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|frankaus: lights green many will psyche with N hand|pg||
nt|april7: no need for E to go to 4@H with his hand|pg||
nt|frankaus: i have an occasional pd that would bid 1NT with N - |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 5@C   the better contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes in 5c declarer can play for safety in clubs cashing ace and then leading up tothe club in 3n he has to take the club finesse to preserve communications|pg||
nt|lestergold: which would be a disaster for example if the stiff k was offside|pg||
nt|ady: might be right to duck first round of clubs|pg||
nt|tomi2: have been asked about the format. 16 teams were drawn into 2 groups and play a RR there. then only the first of each group reaches the final (I think 3 segments) while all others ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: play a swiss with full carryover|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, I am not convinced by 2@D, by they are not doubled so...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: tricky lead|pg||
nt|tomi2: Marsal tried to hit partners long suit? :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes probably is right to|pg||
nt|tomi2: in bridgebase he would quicly use the undo button and try to lead something else :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzqs: now its right ;-)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 2@H is playble for N/S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West has penalty-passed 1@S. So why is dbl of 2@C not penalty? |pg||
pc|h9|nt|frankaus: such poor suits so bid NT ROFL|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he hit someones long suit|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|april7: still only 1 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|april7: 9 or 10 tricks if J of @D can produce a trick|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: is there no reason to cash a of @H first or maybe even ak? |pg||
nt|april7: has to play @H now anyway|pg||
nt|bridge_one: bec 1@S DBL p p; 2@C DBL isn't penalty but means 2/3 @C ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: disagree.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so pass can be only 1@C (impossible) or a penalty hand|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  I dont think West thought this was going to end in 2@D nevertheless|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|sybarra: not sure I would have wasted the @S entry, but Kirmse must have a plan |pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: might have been great for defence if east had led from jack six of clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: it would have been a horrible moment for north on the second round of clubs|pg||
nt|ady: yes    might well finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: however play will speed up and blood pressure will drop when he sees the pesky ten of clubs shortly|pg||
nt|ady: as it is no problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he seems to be very reluctant to advance that club but what else can he do now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: no technical problem, i am still here :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: whjat is north in the tank about?|pg||
nt|tomi2: every time I was operator in Bonn the players played so quickly that I could not follow the game|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|lestergold: no other source of anything remotely approaching nie tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|d5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if you've got a penalty hand, then you should double. Why wait for partner to do it for you?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: depending on agreements - many play how i told, but it is right also play natural and DBL by East penalty|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agreed, agreements matter, but once West passes 1@sx for penalties, reckon all doubles penalties|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|boltonian2:  not sure why E did not dble for penalty regardless of this argument, surely that should be penalty|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|april7: some odd plan E had to make only 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: I think Kirmse was not playing for @H's 3/2 |pg||
nt|sybarra: afraid I would have taken a different line |pg||
nt|april7: its easy to claim tricks,which are not available|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he did not make 6 |pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: he made just 10, sorry|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bridge_one: if they use DBL penalty East would DBL, true ?|pg||

nt|april7: wrong decision by Mr .Fucik|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mcarroll: @S slam on here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 tops in 3n but 5d looks the elegabt contract to bid|pg||
nt|ady: could make 6 diamonds   but not likely to get there      3NT   or 5@D   likely|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes set up a long heart to get rid of spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: and south cant lead spades of course|pg||
nt|tomi2: 6@D needs @SK with the leader and hearts 4-3?  those contracts only work, when you don't bid them|pg||
nt|ady: yes     if south leads a spade will have to run it|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we get another chance |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzqs: the final was to fast for me...|pg||
nt|april7: 6@S but not 6 @H!!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes a good example of choosing the 4-4 fit being best|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk4: Just enter the final contract Lukas|pg||
nt|lestergold: so if 6d is bid east cant fail to make it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cards don't lie well here for EW|pg||
nt|bridge_one: could also open 1Nt - but in IMP with not passed hand from p, can be rigth give 5 good cards in @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: This takes too long|pg||
nt|mcarroll: There must be something wrong - all commentators agree on this one lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Letsomeone bid 5@S now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: then lead a card and claim|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: np  Lukas,  they do that sort of thing |pg||
nt|frankaus: could get too high here id NS venture beyond game|pg||
nt|april7: another 3NT,this time from NS also making probably 10 tricks,setting up the @D suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well enuf entries to do it|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 6@D may have a fair chance|pg||
nt|tomi2: amazingly that de pagter fond a bid and marsal no 2nd|pg||
nt|tomi2: while hop found 2 bids and mattson 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: east will not be encouraged by the original heart  response|pg||
nt|mcarroll: will they even bid 5? seemed to be ready to pass out 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: anderson pressing on |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  yes and maybe even a little strong for 1NT too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes 17 + 5 cards = 18|pg||

pc|h4|nt|april7: 4NT!|pg||

pc|hA|nt|april7: slam try ,but no chance for 12 tricks in @D|pg||

nt|sybarra: not sure David (Greenwood) can handle the @D's   for one loser |pg||
nt|april7: whats 5@S?|pg||
nt|april7: asking for quality?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm not sure N can move with xxx of @D|pg||
nt|april7: so 4NT was a better bid!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Surely 4NT from S was called for?|pg||
nt|sybarra: he is the only one who knows he has stiff ace of @D|pg||
nt|projekt1: slam depending on the @s honneurs? ?   or general (quantitative) slam invitation??|pg||

nt|lestergold: playing in the 5/3 fit with the diabolical layout|pg||
nt|tomi2: there seems to be a problem with the liveticker, so we have no running results from the other matches|pg||

mb|2C|an|!s & !d|mb|p|nt|boltonian2:  N apparently has a way of showing this 2 suiter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it is generally a good idea to bid your long suit here (1@D) and then spades later|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless you have a Gadget|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: so 2@C means @S/@D, so np for N to choise the bid|pg||
mb|3S|nt|frankaus: not keen on going negative with any hand - played too much rubber bridge when younger|pg||

nt|tomi2: north will have to check the fit|pg||
nt|projekt1: 2Nt?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|ady: cards lay well for n/s  especially if west is played for one of the heart honors|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: here it comes|pg||
mb|p|nt|boltonian2:  S could bid one more confidently with K10 and an A|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: presumably when north bid 2s he was looking to see if no trumps was the better spot?|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, I assume south had shown some @S support with this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I must say, I wonder where West got the double from |pg||
nt|bridge_one: The DBL by West is justified by sgl in @D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, yes, his bidding box...|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  hmm, not sure it is justification enough though|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  surely can't be surprised to see that @C void in dummy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i means sgl @D the reason to give a risk dbl|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: perhaps south was allowed to have only three hearts for example|pg||
nt|tomi2: think it is common to raise on 3 cards in the Netherlands, so playing in a Axxx - xxx fit while 3NT could be laydown or 4@S is not great|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes as i thought|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the lead wont hurt|pg||
nt|tomi2: i recently played some tourney with a Dutch player and was shocked how often I got raised on 3. then i stopped to bid bad 4 card suit and then we agreed on not raising on 3 :)|pg||

nt|bridge_one: and best defence by West|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, South will not reckon the spades are 3-3 - but he might have to assume it|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  ruff, and then spade to the A followed by a @H might not have been so good for S either|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now South has insurmountable entry problems, it would seem|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - down|pg||

nt|boltonian2:  NS have done quite well here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: on the bidding north has shown dims so they are an obvious danger|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|frankaus: Kirmse will find the winning line IMO|pg||

nt|boltonian2:  yes, though maybe has a bit of a guess|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  if W has 3@S instead of 2@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no- @SA almost pinpoints the @SQ|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  yes but maybe AQ stiff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, South doesn;t know diamonds are 3-2 |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  the other table have also done well to get to 4@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and without DBL at 4@S by East know also @S 3/2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but I reckon that is what he will play for |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  yes, probably|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this evening i learn a new word: reckon :) good song !|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|tomi2: expect them to play low-high, so 6-4 was odd and maybe it showed preferance for clubs since he could have played the 9 in first trick|pg||

nt|lestergold: but a good try|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
