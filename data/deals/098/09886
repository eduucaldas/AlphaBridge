nt|sybarra: I am surprise e/w played 4 @H in the other room |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: surely with extras Jansma would have bid 3@s|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The issue on the hand is not aces anyway, it is fit and the diamond control|pg||
mb|2D!|an|multi|mb|d|nt|nigel_k:  Fast arrival is not very helpful when partner needs specific cards and room to find out about them|pg||
nt|hedyg: no 3@d opening by S, just as well, might find @ss now|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sybarra: pretty heavy multi |pg||

nt|aida_mk_nl: maybe jan will make a move now|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4 @S please, no chance of beating this one |pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: this is very dang double :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  IMO South should bid either 4S or nothing, 3S doesn't take up space and makes it easier for them over the eventual 4S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d X pass for many pairs shows the hand S has, i.e. 6+@ds|pg||
nt|hedyg: so now N doubled hoping for @d tricks and ruff by him|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|nigel_k:  I like double by North, he has maximum defence for his bidding and may help partner avoid a phantom sacrifice|pg||
