nt|drahcir: 3@D seems a bit too much to me, should not it show the @H / @D 5-5 hand ?|pg||
nt|drahcir: And why bid at all? |pg||
nt|ineg: I agree Richard, I think S did not show @D, just short @H which explains why E did not dbl with his @H holding?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I have a rule- whenever opponents bid 5 of a minor and there is a suspicion that they might be too high - double|pg||
nt|goanoei:  I guess South thinking N has 5@H/5@D and North thinking South has 6@D|pg||
