nt|iain sime: 15/17|pg||
nt|paulg: would you open Lucas 2@h with Cuthbertson's hand, or is it too playable in spades?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|werge: Til de knap så rutinerede: Når man åbner på Nords hånd, skal man regne med at komme for højt ganske ofte|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  it was better than the previous Lucas 2@H that McGinley came up with earlier|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|iain sime: I guess that is why he didn't.|pg||
nt|capercliff: too good for a lucas 2 no?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ebrok: Der strammes helt igennem!|pg||
nt|pkl: God dobling, ja.|pg||

nt|boltonian2:  some action here maybe|pg||
nt|capercliff: how any @d over 1@s?|pg||
nt|capercliff: many*, 2 is normal I gues|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  just the two I think|pg||
nt|iain sime: Double?|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  might double to think of the alternative|pg||
nt|capercliff: the 4@h's makes t awkward|pg||
nt|paulg: just a simple overcall, don't want to lose the opportunity to get hearts into the game or show power later|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|iain sime: ok, that changes it.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|an|4+!H|mb|p|nt|capercliff: I would not open this 2@c|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  might make it more difficult for EW to realise that diamonds are going to be the problem for 6@H though|pg||

nt|capercliff: would anyone here pen 2@c?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|iain sime: Dave Walker passed 2C in the hope of being on lead v. 3NT.|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: hvad med en dobling?|pg||
nt|werge: Fra hvem?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: jeg ved godt den ikke er køn, men... (fra Peter)|pg||
nt|werge: Har du arvet?|pg||
nt|pkl: Den eneste, der kunne doble var Nord. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: nej|pg||

mb|p|nt|boltonian2:  this is by no means certain|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  done well to reach this game, but it is going to be a difficult make|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|vugraphzpd: 2 gange på en dag :-)|pg||
nt|pkl: Jeg ville kunne forstå en dobling fra Dorthe, men pas er den sympatisk melding|pg||
nt|ebrok: nu kan han vinde, og bør vinde !!|pg||
nt|iain sime: Well stopped; the trump break sinks 5H.|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, it's not an obvious game to bid and (it may be) unlucky to find the 4-1 trump break|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg: the @cK lead asks for upside count|pg||
pc|s4|nt|boltonian2:  that might have been the best play|pg||
nt|paulg: diamond or @c3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h6|nt|iain sime: Yes, a third round of diamonds may be the best shot.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|werge: Har man overhovedet lov at brudge åbningen 1 C som spærremelding?|pg||

pc|dK|nt|boltonian2:  it was the diamond ony my screen, but this could be good too|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ebrok: det ligner 5 Imp til Schou|pg||
nt|capercliff: could e some communication problems after the @h break is found|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pkl: 1@C var ganske effektiv som spær i gamle dage ;-)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulg: i think a trump back would have been better, but McGeorge will not be confident of the spade situation|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|capercliff: yes very good defence|pg||
nt|paulg: momentum plays a significant part in these 16 board sets and N/S definitely have it after the first two boards|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|bridge_one: weak @S + minor - muideberg style|pg||
mb|d|nt|pkl: 12 stik, tror jeg|pg||
nt|iain sime: We don't have communication to the other room, but I can tell you that Steel won 4 on 1 and 10 on 2, so leads 14-0.|pg||
mb|p|nt|boltonian2:  part score battle now, EW good for|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  3@S|pg||
nt|paulg: i like to be able to bid clubs over a short 1@c|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  at this vul I imagine Cuthbertson will come in at some point later|pg||
nt|capercliff: unless they bid lots of @s first|pg||
nt|paulg: sure, but an immediate 3@c would probably have scooped the pot|pg||
nt|iain sime: EW scored 300 in the other room.|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  though if McGinley bids a @S they will be in four before that can happen|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  maybe W will only bid 3|pg||
nt|capercliff: I would imagine 3@c is not natural for some reason|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  an easy 4@S should steady things though|pg||
nt|paulg: another thin game that will probably fail|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  though, as you say, it is going off|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|mb|2N|nt|ebrok: Et ligespil her, ikke efter Schaltz hoved|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: not vuln it is ok also with Jxxxx|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bridge_one: effective 2@s - E/W could play slam here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pkl: To ud af tre knibninger er faktisk 50%....|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|paulg: i'd bid 4@d as West to get to the right game|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pkl: .... men 3 af tre er 12.5% ... vi har vist alle været i dårligere slemmer|pg||
nt|capercliff: hmm|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  hmm, not where we imagined this auction would end up|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is interesting indeed|pg||
nt|iain sime: playing equal level conversion, 2D does not show extras.|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  no, though I think I would still have gone for 3@C with the N hand|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  ok, on the plus side we now have communication with the other room|pg||
nt|iain sime: We seem to have established a link with the other room, so should get comparisons.|pg||
nt|paulg: Howie-McGinley are a conservative pair and so far this has not been working to their advantage|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|paulg: Walker is a passed hand|pg||
nt|capercliff: the N bid is what I was wondering about|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  me too, unless W thought 3NT might still be the intended spot|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|paulg: i think most top players would respond 1@s on this hand for instance|pg||
nt|capercliff: how many brds per set?|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|paulg: this 2@c response to the takeout double is something that Cuthbertson-Walker have clearly not discussed .. or remembered|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

nt|boltonian2:  not sure you need the entry|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  5 might actually be more difficult than 6 though|pg||
nt|paulg: hard for Walker to see 5-6 opposite|pg||
nt|mowen: is it reasonable to cash @SAK and play the same hand for 3@Ss and 3@Cs|pg||
nt|capercliff: Walker might take some time with this one|pg||
nt|paulg: Walker takes time on most hands ... I think Cuthbertson is the only fast player at the table|pg||
nt|capercliff: safety play must be to finesse @s twice anyway no?|pg||

nt|paulg: easy double for Cuthbertson|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|fcarioca: I'm guessing EW will bid 6@D here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: depending on the bid by south|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to make 6@S need @H lead|pg||

mb|3H|nt|iain sime: The Steel team are favourites with a lot of international experience; only Ian Howie has played for Scotland in the Maiolani team.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ebrok: 41|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|bridge_one: the Dbl at 4@H is a old way to procede - normally Dbl means no interest in @H|pg||
