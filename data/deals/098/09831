nt|lestergold: not  a bad 6 actually|pg||
nt|lestergold: cold played by south whenever there is no club lead ot club k onside|pg||

nt|lestergold: n/s have a normal spade part score|pg||

nt|star6ija: 6@s is a good sacrifice even against game|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: but hard to  reach!|pg||
nt|chthonic: That overcall may have a negative result, since NS would surely be playing spades absent the bid|pg||

nt|chthonic: It would -- or will -- be interesting to see the effect on EW of an opening bid.  Whether there is sufficient competition to bid 5C|pg||

nt|lestergold: but east west can make 4s less easily|pg||
nt|lestergold: no sorry they can only make 3 but good save in 4s|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially if they double fin esse the clubs for onlkhy one club loser|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|chthonic: So, there was no swing on board 1, where NS could make slam on favorable card placement, but on the second board a problem arose in both rooms NS.  The worse of the two disasters ...|pg||
nt|chthonic: occurred in the other room after a preempt.  It looked like a misunderstanding in this room would have been the problem, but it paled in comparison.  |pg||
nt|lestergold: 2slooks limit for n/s but e/w can probably make 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
