nt|vugraphzpt: Fallenius Fredin 871|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: All before last round|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Hanging in there for directors ruling and final score|pg||
nt|poohbear: on board 26 Feldman hesitated in PO seat and his partner led dummy's first bid suit which I think was the right lead but wasnt at all clear to do|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2100 plus kibs watching nothing . that should tell us something..|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: while I await the directors ruling and final results - Agains with one round to go|pg||

nt|vugraphzpt: I have no mor eknowledge than what you see there|pg||
nt|jbgood: great job David!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: The ruling will clearly affect P&L final position|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: The delay is ruling and gettting final scores delivered to me|pg||
nt|poohbear: so the @h lead might not be so wrong. If the directors had asked the first 3 experts and they all said a @s lead then as long as they were sure about the hesitation the ruling ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: would be made already|pg||
nt|poohbear: no ruling as of yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: OK the interesting part is as usual - the permanent partnerships again do well|pg||
nt|poohbear: So one minor point although it might not be relevant|pg||
nt|po-s: David, it would be sad if the reverse were true|pg||
nt|poohbear: The screen got pushed to Feldman who was the only person who had a chance to act so clearly it was his hesitation|pg||
nt|poohbear: Players give honest opinions|pg||
nt|poohbear: about the action the director asks |pg||
nt|po-s: how many did lead a heart?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|poohbear: this is the hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|po-s: I guess the bidding was similar at many tables|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Now West hesitated and East led a heart|pg||
nt|poohbear: which I think is the correct lead but not at all clearcut|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Not wanting to cast anything on anybody I would actively not lead a heart in this situation. |pg||
nt|jbgood: hesitated ,|pg||
nt|poohbear: anyway I am off to enjoy some Cavendish free food:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: why put myself in harms way - they cant call the director because I DIDNT lead a heart|pg||
nt|poohbear: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I await ruling and results|pg||
nt|henryb: Aren't Pepsi and Feldman on the same side, and couldn't Lev be thinking if for example he were 5-5 in the red suits?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: The screens dont help one always knows who is thinking based on the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: No screen runs top left to bottom right|pg||
nt|henryb: I mean Pepsi thinking|pg||
nt|henryb: Yes, but it could have been Pepsi thinking about whether to pass 3N|pg||
nt|henryb: the tray went to Pepsi and Feldman|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Which would you back Pepsi to be thinking of bidding over 3NT or partner doubling - anyway as I said why put yourself in harms way|pg||
nt|jbgood: of course S didnt have any bid|pg||

nt|lestergold: 9 tops|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: slam for e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|frankaus: @S partial looks to be the spot|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like 4 card suits strong NT by EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: cards all wrong for n/s to venture very far in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 7 cold in 3 denominations|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: grand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@D is a good start|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Thomas Gotard from Germany|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|frankaus: may make 4 here|pg||
nt|sybarra: just going to say,  might make 4 |pg||
nt|frankaus: light red 4 NS as well|pg||
nt|april7: W will lose 3@C and 1 @H trick, because not enough entries for the finesses needed|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure 4 will make,  doesnt he lose 1 ht, 1 sp, and 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|frankaus: cant imagine any S not passing  so looks like more technical problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we are stuck via connex |pg||
nt|april7: 4th @S is also en entry, so 10 tricks are really available|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: anderson is still thinking|pg||
nt|frankaus: 0 H if W gets it all right|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure he has enough entries |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well here go |pg||
mb|4N|nt|lestergold: its a seven depending on good hearts suit behaviour|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: Marsal/Mattson are no regular pdship, but I am sure they have played lots of boards together|pg||
mb|5S|nt|tomi2: so a nice bidding contest for them|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3/2 break and some 4/a breaks also|pg||
nt|lestergold: some 4/1 breaks too|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: @C@C@Cthen @D fionesse ,@H finesse ,@D and @H finesse ,@S  and another @H finesse|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|projekt1: hi again|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Bonn for the annual Nations Cup. Seven 12-board matches in the round-robin. This is a match from round 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the lowest scoring of the 3 grands but as itys not mps it hardly mtters|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting that west rkc'd in hearts but opted fror the dim slam|pg||
nt|tomi2: Germany II is traditionaly the spot for players from the host Bridge Club (Bonn)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: nobody here from them in closed room ;-)|pg||
nt|tomi2: rkc in hearts gave hin all usefull information he needed|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Shirley Ybarra, USA, Martin Carroll, Ireland, Josef Harsanyi and Avram Kreisberger, Germany. I am Roland Wald from Denmark|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Lukas Schenk|pg||
nt|april7: something is wrong with the name of the players|pg||
nt|mcarroll: its ok now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: hi... brd 13 was played already|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not anymore|pg||
nt|april7: now it might  be ok|pg||
nt|projekt1: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: 7@H   worst of grand slams    7NT  or 7@D  can make if north has 4 or 5 hearts and k@S  or has JXXX hearts and KJ@S|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi Josef|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: west probably opted for dims in case hearts didnt break and hoping that there would be alternative plays in 7d in that eventuality|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tomi2: yes and east had no reason to remove this|pg||
pc|d6|nt|april7: helpfull|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course not|pg||
nt|ady: 7@D  of course could go off to a ruff if north had 5 hearts|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c3|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: well you cant deman 100 percent for a grand slam- you need better odds than for a small slam its true|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 1@C = hearts  11+|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@D = spades  11+|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and so on|pg||

nt|poohbear: afterwards the pair can appeal|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Director had gone to determine ruling|pg||

nt|Vugraphzqs: here is now the TD|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes and @C by declarer gave them another chance|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: because of the 3@h bidding|pg||
nt|april7: 1@C - 1@D -  !NT  - 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: sorry, because of the 2@s...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: it was explained by Pazur: invitational with shortage|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: but the explantation was on both sides the same so its ok now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: lets go to board 15 :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: in those short matches and tournaments of course luck is an important factor. you make decisions that will bring or cost you lots of imps and sometimes you need good breaks to make ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: your bidding successfull|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: http://www.bonn-nations-cup.bridgeverband-westfalen.de/2009/BBO_00_Frame.htm  the page with running scores|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 25 combined with long suits here for n/s but......|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: E will not pass this out LOL|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n does make|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: 3NT   or 5@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|april7: 11 tricks in NT or @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bonn-nations-cup.bridgeverband-westfalen.de/2009/liveticker/09_05_20_team.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Look at the CC I gave you for explanations of bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.geocities.com/daniel_neill_2000/sys/Dwururka.txt|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c too|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|tomi2: other room in 7@H on the last hand, so a small pick-up for the Dutch Juniors|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|frankaus: lights green many will psyche with N hand|pg||
nt|april7: no need for E to go to 4@H with his hand|pg||
nt|frankaus: i have an occasional pd that would bid 1NT with N - |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 5@C   the better contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes in 5c declarer can play for safety in clubs cashing ace and then leading up tothe club in 3n he has to take the club finesse to preserve communications|pg||
nt|lestergold: which would be a disaster for example if the stiff k was offside|pg||
nt|ady: might be right to duck first round of clubs|pg||
nt|tomi2: have been asked about the format. 16 teams were drawn into 2 groups and play a RR there. then only the first of each group reaches the final (I think 3 segments) while all others ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: play a swiss with full carryover|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: tricky lead|pg||
nt|tomi2: Marsal tried to hit partners long suit? :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes probably is right to|pg||
nt|tomi2: in bridgebase he would quicly use the undo button and try to lead something else :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|frankaus: such poor suits so bid NT ROFL|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he hit someones long suit|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|april7: still only 1 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|april7: 9 or 10 tricks if J of @D can produce a trick|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: is there no reason to cash a of @H first or maybe even ak? |pg||
nt|april7: has to play @H now anyway|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|sybarra: not sure I would have wasted the @S entry, but Kirmse must have a plan |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ady: might have been great for defence if east had led from jack six of clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: it would have been a horrible moment for north on the second round of clubs|pg||
nt|ady: yes    might well finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: however play will speed up and blood pressure will drop when he sees the pesky ten of clubs shortly|pg||
nt|ady: as it is no problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he seems to be very reluctant to advance that club but what else can he do now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: no technical problem, i am still here :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: whjat is north in the tank about?|pg||

nt|april7: wrong decision by Mr .Fucik|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mcarroll: @S slam on here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 tops in 3n but 5d looks the elegabt contract to bid|pg||
nt|ady: could make 6 diamonds   but not likely to get there      3NT   or 5@D   likely|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes set up a long heart to get rid of spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: and south cant lead spades of course|pg||
nt|tomi2: 6@D needs @SK with the leader and hearts 4-3?  those contracts only work, when you don't bid them|pg||
nt|ady: yes     if south leads a spade will have to run it|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzqs: the final was to fast for me...|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Yes a good example of choosing the 4-4 fit being best|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk4: Just enter the final contract Lukas|pg||
nt|lestergold: so if 6d is bid east cant fail to make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: This takes too long|pg||
nt|mcarroll: There must be something wrong - all commentators agree on this one lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Letsomeone bid 5@S now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: then lead a card and claim|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: np  Lukas,  they do that sort of thing |pg||
nt|frankaus: could get too high here id NS venture beyond game|pg||
nt|april7: another 3NT,this time from NS also making probably 10 tricks,setting up the @D suit|pg||

pc|s5|nt|lestergold: perhaps south was allowed to have only three hearts for example|pg||
nt|tomi2: think it is common to raise on 3 cards in the Netherlands, so playing in a Axxx - xxx fit while 3NT could be laydown or 4@S is not great|pg||

nt|lestergold: well the lead wont hurt|pg||

nt|Vugraphzqs: board 22 starts soon|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: board 21 one down, but i dont know the contract|pg||
nt|ady: comedy of errors board 7 where 4@H got through    north led a spade from 4 to the 10  South won and returned a spade   north playing the 10 I assume to show a high card in diamonds ...|pg||
nt|ady:     when south won the Q@H  from QXXX   played a club  and now the contgract made becaause the spades were unblocked for the discard|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: W is not in the law but E opened vul. 2@D so must have some points|pg||

mb|3H|nt|sybarra: may get caught here? |pg||
nt|frankaus: no way E will pass IMO|pg||

pc|s5|nt|projekt1: but where is the @cJ ? or is the double @cA a good chance?|pg||
