nt|mariner1: hi Jon|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|xenya: doesn't a @D lead beat 3@H?|pg||
nt|ady: anything above 2 level difficult for n/s|pg||
nt|finch: yes|pg||
nt|athene: north could have considered 2@C over 1@H there, perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: non-vul and a pretty fair suit|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - think i went to the wrong room:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: careful makes the 3N on any lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  IN the orther room - NOrth somehow stole 1NT+1|pg||
nt|finch: 3@C was forcing, I imagine, otherwise 3NT was a tad optimistic|pg||
nt|frankaus: MM's are a sweet here bit like smartees|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@C Polish  12-14 balanced, or 15+ with clubs or any 18+ (here)|pg||
nt|chthonic: a game hand in spades, no doubt.  Hearts works, too|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1nt as a passed hand would be minors, but that doesn't look sensible with such suit disparity|pg||
pc|d3|nt|frankaus: interesting spot|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: goodcase for passing, holding the @HQ, but I think West will bid 4@H |pg||
nt|sybarra: good stop,  I can not see 9 tricks unless some help |pg||
nt|frankaus: no one plays 2NT to play here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: yes, he has :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorting @D out early would help |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|granguru: around the limit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a bit of pressure on declarer, as he will have a god idea the @SK is wrong - so he won't want to lose two trump tricks |pg||
nt|chthonic: Well, So does this.  Three clubs and the spade ace|pg||
pc|h6|nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE  LIMERICK ****  N-IRELAND 93, SCOTLAND 91, ENGLAND 78,  CBAI 71, IRELAND 67,  WALES 46  ****|pg||
nt|granguru: good stop|pg||
nt|mariner1: W probably makes a good decision not to compete further|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Reasonable 6@c?|pg||
nt|nielsfoged:  Two @d ruffs|pg||
pc|h4|nt|granguru: Hi Rob|pg||
nt|athene: i assume E-W play some variation of Polish Club, so West can't have a 'normal' 2NT rebid (18-19 balanced)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: @DA and another will work well |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi John|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is off if they find the @S ruff|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chthonic: but this looks riskier and depends on the clubs splitting or favorable entries|pg||
pc|d8|nt|frankaus: many will bid & make 3NT i expect|pg||
nt|sybarra: guess we are not going to use @D |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|athene: but i must say, it looks possible that East was treating 2NT as natural|pg||
nt|athene: (3@C just checking back for 3-card spade fit; 3NT to play)|pg||

pc|d9|pc|c8|pg||

nt|Gerben42: please welcome Michael Gromöller|pg||
nt|mariner1: well not the optimum defense|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: cashing a top heart would be ok if south had a big singleton, but he is more likely to have a small one, if hearts really are 4-1|pg||

nt|hedyg: hello :)|pg||
nt|ady: hi Hedy|pg||
nt|ady: only 2nd hand    first was a throw in|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 4 matches: AIDA 64, Kannavos 59, ONYX (Romania) 58, POLINA 58, Papakyriakopoulos 57, Zipovski 54 |pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: missed the announcement . sry|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    n/s with their combined 17 pts  can make  4@C   but will they find the club contract after a no-trump opening from west|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@h limit in EW, 4@c NS|pg||
nt|athene: presumably the 7 imps is some sort of carry-over|pg||
nt|Gerben42: and hi Rob :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Gerben|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: not sure I believe Open made 6 there :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: someone could get shoved too high here|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: hello|pg||
mb|1S|nt|frankaus: could have been held to 8 at various times|pg||
nt|mariner1: easy @H game for EW|pg||
mb|d|nt|thegarve:  danger of going overboard in @d|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores it seems here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, 7.2 actually|pg||
nt|athene: now north wants to show a good 3-card raise|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But our software does not do fractions|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C would be the normal way if you treat 1@C as natural|pg||
nt|athene: a very weak NT!|pg||
nt|sybarra: but old adage:  where there is 8.....|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: EW can make 3NT on this layout, but they are unlikely to get there|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   very duplicated   can only make 2@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs a tool to show a 3 suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: E-W have 6@C but pretty much impossible to find at the best of times|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: can double 2@H for t/o now|pg||
nt|ady: north may well re-open with double|pg||
nt|hedyg: even 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: may have to re-open at 3 level|pg||
nt|hedyg: W should pass with QJx in @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: on the other hand the long @hs..|pg||
nt|ady: but nothin much lost if letting e/w play 3@H  should be down 1|pg||
nt|chthonic: Perfect fit, spade finesse onside...|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: hard to stay out of game here, although 3NT looks for most natural final contract|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   not a bad spot for e/w    -  but the diamond unkind   and a likely spade lead will beat it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I expect 2@d was an Artificial GF|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N very aggressive call from E with his 11|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems he is looking for the 8th and 9th trick|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt makes for N-S - if they see through the backs of the cards|pg||
nt|frankaus: this looks only 9 in @H |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|finch: Unusually for a ladies' pair, EW play 5card majors, strong NT|pg||
nt|thegarve:  now with doubt about @h stops - I expect to see 5@d|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And it's very unlucky anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You need @S6 as an entry to take the club finesse|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H is down on the spade ruff|pg||
nt|athene: sorry NS have 6@C :)|pg||
nt|athene: now south will just bid 4@S i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: when you have 5-3 fits in both black suits, clubs rarely get a look-in :)|pg||
nt|athene: south has a good hand facing short diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: all his hcp are working|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Panja|pg||
nt|panja: hi Roland, all|pg||
nt|athene: a spectator just points out that 6@C goes down on diamond lead|pg||
nt|athene: because of course you get forced|pg||
nt|athene: so the 4-1 club break dooms both black slams, for different reasons :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: would you come with @H over 2 @D?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn: may not get a spade lead on this bidding, mind|pg||
nt|mariner1: I see 8th, 9th will be harder|pg||
nt|Walddk4: *lucky I meant to say|pg||
nt|hedyg: hello again!|pg||
nt|frankaus: will they even mention the suit?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: N might have doubled 2@C for T/O|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but vuln. is not good for a save|pg||
nt|Gerben42: would be -500|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|finch: personally sitting West I'd have more doubts about club stops|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D interesting...i wonder if he is trying to keep 3nt in the picture?|pg||
nt|panja: North would have passed the 2@D double..with a BAL|pg||
nt|athene: i can't believe he is considering staying out of game?|pg||
nt|panja: what does the first dbl show? the second?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: pls disregard the score, it has NOTHING to do with this match|pg||
nt|chthonic: No club ruff.  Potential slam swing if anyone is aggressive enough to seek it|pg||
nt|chthonic: but hardly likely with sich weak looking cards east|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dburn: but South will probably not have much choice - hearts are going to be the unbid suit, but the singleton @hQ isn't really a candidate|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT is certainly a better spot that 5@D|pg||

nt|dburn: though I guess clubs might not be a "bid suit" in this auction - not sure how many of them East has promised|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: tought to do so now, over..... |pg||
nt|frankaus: not me|pg||
nt|sybarra: was going to say 3 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: me either,  since a "live" auction |pg||
nt|frankaus: too round and the traffic lights are red|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|dburn: well, West has started bidding them|pg||
nt|finch: East has promised 3@C, although having denied diamond support probably should have 4 now|pg||
nt|finch: looks as if 4@C is a self-cue for diamonds.  Either that, or Gerber.|pg||
nt|dburn: exclusion keycard Gerber for diamonds, one assumes|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3NT off in the other room , I doubt if 5@d will be doubled|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: N/S respect the LAW and do not compete to 3 @H|pg||
nt|athene: if north had shown a good raise, i think south might have gone 3@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: both opps unlimited,  maybe go for 1100 at the 2 level |pg||
pc|h3|nt|chthonic: and making six is too routine to bother discussing.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: since 2@H showed a minimum, don't know what exactly W wanted|pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe 3NT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: five aces|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT went off after a spade lead, spade return, diamond to the jack ducked|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and a void|pg||
nt|athene: first double is good hand, second is penalties i am assuming|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: sure seems E owes W a @S raise here.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West might have tried one more spade there |pg||
nt|athene: 3@H would be very interesting on spade lead, @SAK, ruff, club back to the @CA, fourth spade|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: south did not cover the @D since he wants @C play from p|pg||
nt|frankaus: too much defence  - |pg||
nt|mariner1: can make 5 now|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|dburn: exclusing @cA, of course|pg||
nt|finch: EW are probably fortunate that everything else is going off |pg||
nt|mariner1: I think over 2@H was needed as well|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence don't do that, the trump position will be revealed and declarer can pick up the @HQ10|pg||
nt|athene: same contract, same lead in other room|pg||
nt|athene: west put the @C10 in|pg||
nt|panja: with such an UNBAL hand, the dbl by N seems a bit odd|pg||
nt|athene: well he is a bit stuck - has to double to show a good hand|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S risks missing game |pg||
pc|c4|pc|d9|pc|s3|nt|ady: the everything else can only be 3NT   and that might make with a defensive slip up|pg||
nt|sybarra: wo we will soon see what signals they use |pg||
nt|frankaus: need a @C right now|pg||
nt|sybarra: best if a club honor now |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not sure EW have been on the same wavelength here|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|finch: South probably feels the need for slightly better diamonds to double.  It sounds as if the opponents are making slam tries|pg||
nt|dburn: they were doing OK until East raised what she thought were West's clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, East might have done, with three trumps|pg||
nt|frankaus: wd|pg||
nt|sybarra: note on bd 1 both rooms played 2 nt |pg||
pc|dA|nt|thegarve:  the 5@c indicates that, but it is not an easy hand to bid|pg||
nt|frankaus: both made 9|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant|pg||
nt|finch: I think West should pass 3NT.  She's had the chance to show a big hand with diamonds; 3NT must imply no interest in anything higher|pg||
nt|xenya: i totally agree|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe it was East's fault for not passing 2@d, which appeared to be her last chance for a plus score|pg||
nt|chthonic: Hi, Ed|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s4|nt|sunsamvar: but with the @D honours dropping , declarer needs only 1 @D ruff|pg||
pc|sK|nt|finch: I agree the risk is that East has e.g. Kxxx AKx Qx xxxx, but that is a 3@H bid over 3@D|pg||
nt|dburn: although I suppose she could also have passed 3@d|pg||
nt|dburn: or 1@d, come to that|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|h6|nt|finch: while we are results-merchanting, East could have not opened a nasty 12-count with 3 jacks|pg||

nt|finch: or it could be invitational with the minors (that's how I play it)|pg||
nt|athene: north can't really have @DAK as well as everything else|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he counted north's points and knew he cud not have the 2nd @D honour|pg||
nt|panja: the dbl carries the risk that South might pass with a BAL hand..and some up to 8 HCP..|pg||
nt|athene: it was easier to read the lead as a singleton perhaps in this room|pg||
nt|panja: 1Nt might be cold..and so might some black suit partial for NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: well done here |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Craig!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes agression is paying off for NS mainly because EW are not that aggressive|pg||
nt|sybarra: dealer having "fun" today |pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW here|pg||
nt|mariner1: lose 3 and out|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: looks like 4@H  for n/s|pg||
nt|thegarve:  penalty shootout in the FA Cup semi final Man U v Everton, no goals at extra time|pg||
nt|finch: that's what I would call an 'aggressive' 2@D overcall at red|pg||
nt|mariner1: so did not find the 8th then|pg||
nt|mariner1: aggression|pg||
nt|athene: east will probably double 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: NS have 6@H if they can find it|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice 3N here|pg||
nt|mariner1: not the easiest bidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: just stay out of grand..|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@C polish|pg||
mb|1C|nt|finch: EW obviously on the same wavelength, as surely East is close to raising a sound overcall|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops I missed a car, they have 5@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS playing inverted majors to 1@D? |pg||
nt|mariner1: can EW even find it now|pg||
nt|athene: ok - or not :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: not much makes here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: card|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S good spot here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@S - 4@S|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dburn: not completely clear that North-South will get these to game|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c hook off stops 6|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe 1@S shows a 1N call|pg||
nt|athene: east will surely double this?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 1@S shows hearts in their methods|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that is, 1@D-1@h=spades and 1@d-1@S=hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: some use 1N as 4+ @S and 1@S and a 1N call to put the 1N in opener|pg||
nt|mariner1: no alert so its hard to tell which it is Mike :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: so Roland knows it seems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what's the advantage of that, Roland?|pg||
nt|mariner1: E may be pickled here|pg||
nt|hedyg: but N has no reason to go for the grand anyhow|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S should be found routinely. |pg||
mb|1N|nt|finch: good prediction|pg||
nt|dburn: since South doesn't have to have a sixt heart for 2@h in this auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW did not need much for slam......|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d splinter|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  could bid to 7@H      but  4-1 break  bad     6@H may get swing|pg||
nt|athene: E-W won't do too badly in 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: ah - north isn't going to pass 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D |pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: doesn't North have an invite, if they play sound opening bids?|pg||
nt|ady: stopped short      surely worth 3@H|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Kevin Cautious looking at Axxx @d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he has to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: again aggression goes to the front for NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: then what |pg||
mb|2D|nt|mariner1: well NS can beat 4@S however it is not their top spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: a defense slip can allow 4@S also|pg||
nt|granguru: very unprobable|pg||
nt|hedyg: S has a QUICK 4@h bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha |pg||
nt|frankaus: this will make|pg||
nt|chthonic: A bit light opener, but understandable in a forcing club context.  Still a tad light.  too strong outside, however for 2S|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: running scores: http://tinyurl.com/oh5tmv|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 3N should make too, N has no quick entry|pg||
nt|mariner1: K@D is the play here,,,,,, does no good to duck|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: still N has a good hand -- the pass is questionable i think|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C puppet to 2@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: so will play 2@D  successfully |pg||
nt|frankaus: i like the trump lead in this auction|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: well, they may or may not play sound opening bids, and North might have risked a move anyway, but as I say, it wasn't obvious|pg||
nt|finch: Carol Cautious, surely?|pg||
nt|athene: the defence will only come to @HAK, 3 spades and maybe @DK|pg||
nt|athene: with a balanced hand and just 4 diamonds, south wld open 1@C, usually|pg||
nt|athene: so he has presumably promised 5 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would double 2@D with east's hand, i have to say|pg||
nt|athene: 5/4 in the unbid suits and some hcp|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ady: North worried about wastage in diamonds opposite shortage    but north obviously bidding on|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: If clubs were 5-1 we'd be saying 'well stopped'|pg||
nt|thegarve:  doubt it|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 92, N-IRELAND 90, ENGLAND 79, CBAI 70, IRELAND 70, WALES 45 ****|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some English pairs use this major suit inversion over 1@D, but I can't see any major theoretical merit (or else I'm too stupid)|pg||
nt|athene: sorry @DA|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now enter in @C and @D fin|pg||
nt|athene: no, sorry - they have time to get the @DQ as well|pg||
nt|panja: isn't @D an automatice lead here?|pg||
nt|athene: diamond certainly looks reasonable lead|pg||
nt|chthonic: Afraid I am guessing about the system here.  Relays and asking bids apparently set trumps, asked for shortness with 2NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 9 tricks since @C comes too late|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: Buras still thinking|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Buras sees @CA in dummy and @DQ in hand, not very promising prospect|pg||
nt|mariner1: S still thinking?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: maybe that 2@d overcall was a good idea after all, although I confess it doesn't look like one|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe 4@s is kickback and 6@c shows 3 keycards..|pg||

nt|othered1: @C lead against 3N will require some good guessing|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: If EW play J denies higher honor, north will likely go right.|pg||
nt|chthonic: And now the rather infamous weakness of "jack denies" may help declarer.  If it does not deny -- standard -- then declarer has a guess.  If it denies, there is a roadmap in the ...|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||

pc|hA|nt|hedyg: because normal action for N to ask keycards after 4@H|pg||

nt|mdgraham: East was a bit too passive there.  |pg||
nt|mariner1: one problem with those type calls is they become considerably less effective as|pg||
nt|mariner1: the level of opponents increases......... they need to be fit well into the overall|pg||
nt|mariner1: structure of a system|pg||
nt|hedyg: might be difficult to avoid 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: well, even though E-W beat 1nt, they would have scored better in 2@S, i think|pg||
nt|panja: a slam on board 16....a GS even|pg||
mb|1N|nt|finch: 10 tricks NS is a surprisingly large number|pg||
nt|dburn: not often Brown and Stockdale stop in 2NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS should force more in @D here than in Open Room|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS and out|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I see 11,,, would have to come up with 12th....... lead could help if played in E|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6N is what I see them in|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mariner1: EW are finding out if you sit on your hands you will lose a lot of tournaments and|pg||
nt|mariner1: have flat hands............|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S partial EW.... game off best defense|pg||
nt|ady: a partial in hearts seems the best on this hand    only 3 top losers   but with the 4-1 trump break  game seems to much|pg||
nt|athene: it should be possible to have a fairly smooth auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the Polish 1@C opener is very vulnerable to pre-emption, i think|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT here for EW |pg||
nt|sybarra: one of THE best |pg||
mb|2N!|nt|dburn: is it? without a spade lead at trick one, there seem to be ten winners|pg||
nt|ady: well they have got a 22pt semi mis fit|pg||
nt|finch: yes, but only if you take the first diamond|pg||
nt|athene: and it's something which is really not exploited as much as it could be|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S 2@D 2@H 3@H|pg||
nt|Gerben42: really taking the fun outta it, arent you|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: assuming that's forcing of course :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: 6 in reach, not sure there's much chance of them getting to 7|pg||
nt|panja: the only problem is West's stiff @D opposite the 2@D bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: best played by W I think |pg||
nt|othered1: No game makes here, either way|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|dburn: 1@h? is that some cunning plan?|pg||
nt|finch: it would a more amusing cunning plan NV|pg||
nt|mariner1: S has no reall attractive call here,,,,,,, I do not particularly like 1N with KQ stiff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, all calls seem to have one or more major flaws|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike do you like the 1N? (2@C regrettable @c might be my call)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so EW must play some sort of forcing @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: now we find out whether 2@d was gf|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|athene: yes, it will be hard for E-W to diagnose that the @DK isn't a worry|pg||
nt|panja: with this layout, W can simply ask aces and get to the grand..|pg||
nt|panja: what does W need? three key cards, and the trump Q..|pg||
nt|athene: actually having said all that, the grand isn't absolutely laydown - but it's pretty good|pg||
nt|othered1: but both 4@H and 5@D are reasonable shots|pg||
mb|3H|nt|thegarve:  Everton win penalty shootout|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not with KQ stiff, and 2@C should really be a better suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes NS, hard to bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: not much to this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 3@h certainly seems to suggest some artifice - a passed hand facing a vulnerable overcall ought to bid more than that|pg||
nt|finch: 3@H appears to be limit raise values (or more), so perahps South should have seen it through with 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: it wasnt|pg||
nt|ady: not|pg||
nt|ady: trump leads look best|pg||
nt|oliverc: If 2@D is GF then 3@H is very definitely slam-invitational here, so we should get some|pg||
nt|oliverc: cue-bidding|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: a heard lead might kill 3 no|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: and has to play @D the only way that works|pg||
nt|panja: and...4-card trump support..which is not very clear yet|pg||
nt|chthonic: If EW get to 5D, North had better lead a spade -- and that is unlikely. |pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: now a rolling 4@H perhaps|pg||
nt|frankaus: not easy to lead @H|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or a club with a h back|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: any way 2 spade and 3 club tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: still, I guess 3@h has good chances|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree, but on @C lead, west still has a trump guess of sorts|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: this may well take more tricks than it technically should, because the defence will not have the right idea|pg||
nt|dburn: again, declarer has pretty much the same ten top tricks as in 2NT without a spade attack|pg||
nt|finch: in fact I think it makes a load of tricks anyway with no entry to the diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: she can make 10 with all cards in view, not sure about single dummy|pg||
nt|finch: best is to take two hearts before touching clubs, but in practice she might win the heart and play a second club at once|pg||
nt|thegarve:  she will probably assume a@s is with West|pg||
nt|ady: dont think 3NT appeals -  singleton diamond  and opposite a passed hand   10C makes the hand good in no-trumps|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe I need coffee........ just reminded 4@S 3@H 2@D and 3@C are 12 :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so what do you bid with S over the 1@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: small @H in case pd has a stiff high honour|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so a good pass here|pg||
nt|frankaus: nice stop|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: wow!|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: after all the best lead! i see 7 tricks only|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4th from L&S  often the best|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: not an easy hand to play |pg||
nt|athene: west has the perfect hand, so 6@C makes|pg||
nt|athene: 5@S now asking for @HQ and other assorted goodies|pg||
pc|dA|nt|panja: if W bids 5@S now..E should simply bid 7...should he not?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|granguru: @C-@H squeeze for 7NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the slam is easier than I 1st "envisioned"|pg||
nt|granguru: After 4@S and @DAK S cant hold both rounded suits|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: not alwasy easy to do when that suit was bid on right|pg||
nt|sybarra: *on your right |pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: perhaps this is the unbiddable hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: borrow a @H from last deck..|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now moment to show good defence!|pg||
nt|frankaus: sneakie @S |pg||
nt|frankaus: bur S will get it right|pg||
nt|frankaus: *but|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: polish defence play is among the best in the world for sure|pg||
pc|dK|nt|finch: If West's double denied four spades (as it appears from the auction), she'll get a count of the hand in due course|pg||
nt|othered1: And without @Dlead, this has chances, too|pg||
pc|d9|nt|finch: 3NT may not immediately appeal, but you have to compare it with the thought of playing 3@H|pg||
nt|xenya: now a club should hold it|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|granguru: But E can also go for the @CJ  finesse which is bad this time|pg||
nt|granguru: 6NT from top|pg||
nt|athene: east could see pretty much how the play would go - the @DAKQ can be used for fast discards|pg||
nt|frankaus: another commetators curse :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: 2@C is regrettable to me...... just no other good calls|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doubling 3@S seems a bit chancy|pg||
nt|mariner1: I find pass even more regrettable :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one-and-a-half clubs, perhaps|pg||
nt|oliverc: wow, Nicely done|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but here it failed,  south couldnt know about the 5 dia in west- so very difficult to find|pg||
nt|othered1: No, chance for -1 now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: when north wins A@C   ace and another trump|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C sounds like @HQ and @CK to me, but i am sure they know what they are doing|pg||
nt|panja: the wrong player bids the GS, I guess...does W know enough to suspect that the GS is good?|pg||
nt|athene: well he knows everything he is facing|pg||
nt|oliverc: yup|pg||
nt|athene: except the @DQ|pg||
nt|panja: I mean 4th trump...|pg||
nt|panja: does W know that?|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H has to be 4|pg||
nt|panja: well..with 2353..and without Club check....what can E rebid?|pg||
nt|athene: something else :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: if trumps were 3-1 this would take a bit more playing|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: because you can't ruff the spades good AND ruff a club in dummy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sunsamvar: that was quick|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: ruff a spade and  discard last spade on K@D|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: although maybe 1NT is just practical bridge - I have x-y points and a spade stop |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mariner1: operator says 1@D has different meanings based on position|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mariner1: and since S can see 4@C in dummy he will pitch a @H allowing 7 if declarer sees|pg||
nt|mariner1: it that way|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers asking if I consider 2N unusual with S, yes I do NV, the problem here is|pg||
nt|mariner1: RED you have no way to assess N's strenght and will pay a high prices if wrong|pg||
nt|athene: you might try to set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe he thought pd had @S A or Q LOL|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: cash 2 clubs pitching @Ss|pg||
nt|thegarve:  amusing part-score hand|pg||
nt|xenya: @Ds, sorry|pg||

pc|sA|nt|hedyg: down in 3?|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes but 4@H|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: I am very disciplined in my 1N overcalls,,,,,, I like to have what LOOKS LIKE 2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: that looks best - ruff the diamonds good and reverse dummy|pg||

pc|hA|nt|thegarve:  hmm off now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|finch: eh? what was wrong with playing another club|pg||
nt|athene: but dummy doesn't have all that many entries|pg||
nt|panja: well..it might have been better to try Spades first..and finesse @DQ if major suit don't break satisfactorily|pg||
nt|athene: if someone had @H10x left now you couldn't ruff another diamond safely|pg||
nt|athene: i think perhaps try just boringly drawing trumps was the best %|pg||
nt|athene: if they are 2-2 you are pretty much home|pg||
nt|athene: if they are 3-1, you hope for spades 3-3 or the @DK onside|pg||
nt|oliverc: He pretty much has to play for 2-2 trumps from here|pg||
nt|oliverc: little chance of a black-suit squeeze|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s3|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mariner1: and making 7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|ady: 7 for wales|pg||
nt|finch: no that's a swing for England|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   7 for england|pg||
nt|vugraphzmp: director called|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Scotland marginally in the lead now  as NI are only winning by 3 IMPs comapred to Scotland's 14 IMPs|pg||
nt|finch: North to be accused of fielding the psyche?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmp: 1H not alerted as showing longer clubs and could be 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzmp: east would have given west a ruff but assumed out of trumps|pg||
nt|finch: difficult to say how many tricks it would have made on a club back, as declarer dropped a trick later anyway|pg||
nt|thegarve:  and then 3@h would have made by default |pg||
nt|finch: also, if it 'could be' only 3, does that mean it could not be 4?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmp: at least 3|pg||
nt|thegarve:  they got their best possible result|pg||
nt|finch: again, if double denied 4@S then East knows West is 3262 or 3172 (or has 8 diamonds)|pg||
nt|finch: and didn't open in first seat|pg||
nt|finch: but of course if you 'know' that declarer has 4+ hearts you might not think that all the way through|pg||
nt|vugraphzmp: scored as is at the moment|pg||

nt|mariner1: the Chinese overcall 1N and open 1N and 2N with a stiff|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice stop on that hand |pg||
nt|athene: even so, i think it was aggressive - east needed west to have every single card he had|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mariner1: 16 opposite a pretty good 8 though cards are not sitting well for them......|pg||
nt|arel1: 1@d 11-15 bal|pg||

nt|Gerben42: your bid as S after 1@H?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@S i mean|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ady: n/s  look destined to play either 1NT   or 2@S    both likely to go down|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: nice freak here--5 hearts possible|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hello all. Please excuse the late arrival but I was having some logon issues, hopefully now solved|pg||
mb|5S|nt|mariner1: now over the 2@S by E in Open Room I would have to bid 2N with S,,,,,,, DBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: and PASS are not options|pg||
nt|oliverc: Not, one suspects, what North was dying to hear|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 2@D multi, showing a bad weak two in a major or various strong hands|pg||
nt|ady: good save by wales in OR  5@H|pg||
nt|thegarve:  should get to 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets try again  |pg||
nt|athene: well it cld be worse -  he has a pretty good hand in support of minors|pg||
nt|athene: three useful honours|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem is, as 1NT is weak, he may imagine that 2NT has to be constructive|pg||
nt|sybarra: well I am bidding 2 @H over the X  |pg||
nt|sybarra: (probably that is what S did also) |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 dia is a transfer|pg||
nt|frankaus: reflex 2nd hand low is hard to avoid on last|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N seems right|pg||
nt|Gerben42: would lead to a Burn's Law violation|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they pass due to E's limited count I think|pg||
nt|sga1: Hi all|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@S is 11-17 so W has normal pass|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: hi Sudhir|pg||
nt|mariner1: they would play in 2@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Sudhir|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: running scores: http://tinyurl.com/oh5tmv|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  West is unlikely to save looking at least 3 defensive tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: not completely clear to save over it - that West hand has some defensive prospects|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has play here|pg||
nt|athene: interesting - i wonder if south's lack of double was judgement or system|pg||
nt|oliverc: West going to be disappointed, though, if he ends up doubling 3@D|pg||
nt|athene: but the double has probably alerted him to what is going on|pg||
nt|sybarra: S thought for a moment before playing low |pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS will presumably have little trouble reaching a red-suit game, or perhaps 3NT|pg||
nt|chthonic: Seems normal to get to 4H, but now there will have to be some interesting acrobatics to do so|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Marshall!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps NS are playing negative free bids, as otherwise the neg double would seem a somewhat eccentric choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi ed & craig|pg||
nt|othered1: Luckily, EW's @S fit isn't good enough to up the ante before south's second chance|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: looks cold in fact with the pointed Aces set right|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need the @H guess |pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Rob |pg||
nt|sybarra: a likely 3 nt for n/s here |pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: think South will have to get to 4@S herself|pg||
nt|dburn: so the Welsh West, Jean Hand, took a pretty good decision|pg||
nt|thegarve:  if she passes 2@s it would only be 50s - an old ploy|pg||
nt|finch: at the other table West guessed well, although I don't think that weak two was a 'bad' one|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S off, @H off, at lead @c are 3 3,,,,,, @D could be worse|pg||
nt|mariner1: has no real choice I think and the 3@D call helps define the play|pg||
nt|hedyg: unfriendly hand|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. i wonder if double would have been artificial|pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt feel like reflex here |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 5 clubs any body?|pg||
nt|chthonic: Of course, 3NT makes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: west  could lead a top spade  and then decide|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c in EW|pg||
nt|hedyg: but no way to bid it|pg||
nt|ady: yes    e/w could make 2@C   but could not really get into the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: you got there ffirst Heddy|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs a miracle in @D and there is no such thing|pg||
nt|ady: wont go down if they dont play a card|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: making at least 4 |pg||
nt|athene: if i passed 1nt i would surely double 2@S for t/o though|pg||
nt|chthonic: Good bid!|pg||
nt|othered1: can they avoid 4@H simply by never getting their 8-card fit into the auction?|pg||
nt|chthonic: South should be happy with that development.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: careful defense sinks this|pg||
pc|d7|nt|finch: 5@H more of a 2-way shot, could collect x AQxxxx Qxxx xx and make on a good day|pg||
nt|dburn: no saves now - Seale adopting more of a Manchester United approach than an Everton approach to saving|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N in N I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: undo please operator :)|pg||
nt|athene: if pass was neutral, surely south should have bid 3@D himself with 6-5?|pg||
nt|athene: length more important than the extra honour|pg||
nt|oliverc: I would have thought so|pg||
nt|athene: ah ok 2nt wasn't specifically minors|pg||
nt|oliverc: interesting treatment|pg||
nt|othered1: If north hasn't implied long @C, some minimums could produce slam if there isn't serious @C duplication|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mariner1: 4@H tough spot|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder what strength they play it as?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sunsamvar: whatever Bill... it is not often that you dont bid at all with 19 points|pg||
nt|athene: but south does have a very defensive hand|pg||
nt|athene: so prefers to just try for some 50s rather than risking going down at the 3-level|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: can cash for 10 tricks |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chthonic: Very surprising|pg||
nt|othered1: Feels like this isn't a very good layout for their style, unless someone has taken a position about a forcing bid.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphznh: sry the connection is very bad|pg||
nt|hedyg: still waiting for the @D spots to change|pg||
nt|ady: could make if spade position favourable    but not that difficult hand to play   |pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like connection problems, he really does not have that many choices|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: operator?|pg||
nt|athene: if you are going to bid it on very weak hands like south, you can't really use it for strong ones too|pg||
nt|panja: against, perhaps a trump lead might have been better?|pg||
nt|athene: not without a lot of guessing|pg||

pc|s4|pc|dK|nt|finch: passing out 2@S is much more tempting if South has shown 16+, but I doubt it would work here: 4@S is still natural over it|pg||

nt|sga1: yes. @h ruff takes 1@s down|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: another slam coming up|pg||
nt|oliverc: still, cheaper than 3@DX= LOL|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt by N or S will be easy to defeat on B18|pg||

nt|sybarra: may play @H's again as a sac |pg||
nt|chthonic: So easy when we see the cards.|pg||
nt|mariner1: migth win and imp or 2 anyway|pg||
nt|mariner1: might|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: not easy to defeat, but not easy to reach either, after 1@S 2@D 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: i guess west might not think he is quite worth 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: having three small diamonds and 4333 AND minimum hcp|pg||
mb|1H|nt|oliverc: green vs red, tho|pg||
nt|chthonic: So here, we presume 4S making 5.... wonder what could go wrong with that?  NS vul and no reasonable save.  |pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: 2 red aces to lose in hearts for n/s|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3 @S plays well EW here|pg||
nt|athene: let's see if they can get all the marks and play 6nt|pg||
nt|athene: north can double now|pg||
nt|athene: a little bit light on hcp perhaps but the ideal shape for it|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand, HE is red vs. green :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: if the @SQ were in hearts i think it's right to double |pg||
nt|panja: if the overcall could be weak..North will probably pass|pg||
nt|frankaus: how many 1H now?|pg||

nt|mariner1: NS could be in trouble with a @H game|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  might get to 4@S    but will fail either on a heart l ead or clyb|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3@H 4 me|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now 6 spades is down on the b, but 6 clubs makes on carefull playad spade break|pg||
nt|chthonic: So we expect a push board.....|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: as it is...maybe it will cause partner to misjudge (i.e. think you have something :) )|pg||
nt|athene: but misjudging will work very well for N-S if it gets them to 3nt :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: Not sure I'd find a double with the North cards here, but this should work out well|pg||
nt|panja: South wants to try 3N now...but how does he figure out the @S position?|pg||
nt|athene: hard for N-S to work out they have a spade stopper between them|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6 clubs my preference |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can actually make 5  cant they |pg||
mb|p|nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNNG ****  LADY MILNE LIMERICK ****  SCOTLAND 91, N-IRELAND 88, ENGLAND 81, IRELAND  72, CBAI 71, WALES 43 ****|pg||
nt|ady: north took the quick root|pg||
nt|ady: club|pg||
nt|athene: double might help them|pg||
nt|athene: north can pass, showing a little something in spades|pg||
nt|frankaus: pass is a nice bid by 2@C openener|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: after all only 26 combined high c points- so 4 spade is my guess|pg||
nt|othered1: some might bid 3@S with east's fit, assuming 2@H was a simple transfer|pg||
nt|sga1: 1@s is a bold bid with 2 Js|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dburn: still not much in it - one swing in either match could win the Lady Milne for Northern Ireland|pg||
nt|mariner1: well W ensures the @H will not be bid NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West did well to make 3@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 of a major that is |pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N here shows minors over the @c|pg||
nt|Gerben42: very :)|pg||
nt|sga1: and nice @s suit.|pg||
nt|mariner1: bold is a nice word :)|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: with poker chance:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: players under 30 are often bold |pg||
nt|mariner1: well EW make some @H so this will be good|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3@S can be beat though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it certainly looks like it|pg||
nt|mariner1: off 4 best defense|pg||
nt|oliverc: A little something is all South needs|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt has to be right now|pg||
nt|panja: a little courage, do you mean?|pg||
nt|athene: unless you have the firm agreement that north's pass over the double specifically shows a very bad hand (which i can't believe they have)|pg||
nt|chthonic: Losing two clubs after drawing trumps.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: EW can make upto 4@h with correct @s guess.|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  dug up the ground inbetween|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Edgar Kaplan used to say that take-out doubles should be taken out|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S   competitive   so east right to pass|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: 3N has a play,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to duck 1st @S if led|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and this may be a perfect example|pg||
nt|sybarra: pointed out be spec,  even 6 @D can make on the layut for e/w |pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: north can't bid 6nt as they might be off @HK and @CA|pg||
nt|oliverc: wow, that's a little unexpected. lots of ways for this to be defeated, even with the|pg||
nt|oliverc: KJX@H onside|pg||
nt|athene: with nothing in spades and a fifth heart, north should bid 4@H over 3@SX, maybe...but not easy at all|pg||
nt|panja: this should make...|pg||
nt|panja: he will need to ruff third Spade for the second entry|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@H X is still t/o by my methods|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but this is more certain $$$|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: this could get tricky |pg||
nt|athene: trump lead helps declarer a lot|pg||
nt|oliverc: a trump lead is not one of them, though|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you franak |pg||
nt|mariner1: well if they only get it 1 they lose I think|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thist ime bold didnt work|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: and a heart lead wld be embarrassing :)|pg||
nt|athene: excellently done in the open room to flatten 6@C|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: how would you treat  a double on 3 hearts?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *frank |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: will certainly make this now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: 3N was a better spot,, K@S lead helps a lot|pg||
nt|ady: can beat 3 |pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mariner1: he does have one entry to dummy coming|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mariner1: no way to prevent a @D loser it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, @C position doesn't need a ruff to set up 4th @C|pg||
nt|Gerben42: ducking @CA would have been better, but the doubleton lead is not that easy to know|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mariner1: looks like off 2 now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: they need to do this right to get all the @D tricks |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: if x on 3 hearts is to double on 4 is pen|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ady: 3 diamonds a make   so nothing lost|pg||
nt|panja: not done yet...|pg||

nt|sybarra: as I am reminded "only 4 imps" |pg||

nt|mariner1: 4 imps in a 6 - 7 match is huge....... lead vs being behind|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Board 13 was my kind of slam, around 10%|pg||

mb|1C|nt|mdgraham: South missed an inference there - if North was strong, he could have bid 2@S for take-out a round earlier|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: easy 4 heart here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|thegarve:  maybe not if West cashes a@h v 4@S and underleads the @ds|pg||
nt|ady: 4@s  a make for e/w   |pg||
nt|athene: there's a principle names after someone-or-other, isn't there, saying that it's better to play in the weaker of your two fits|pg||
nt|athene: *named|pg||
nt|panja: 6@h should make even on a @C lead..|pg||
nt|athene: you want the solid suit to be side suit and the weak one to be trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I doubt that this will be flat|pg||
nt|panja: exchange one of West's @S with East's small @H..and 6@H won't make|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you get paranoid about these things you miss a lot of slams and make life much harder for yourself|pg||
nt|chthonic: Narrowing the gap to nine IMPs.  Increasing the interest and the tension.  |pg||
nt|othered1: Guess they found no @D lead there, either.|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: that would get you into the papers|pg||
nt|thegarve:  get 4@s two off|pg||
nt|mariner1: we started a little late so I am NOT sure when the next session from Greece|pg||
nt|mariner1: will start.|pg||
nt|mariner1: be sure to check the vugraph schedule for the many vugraphs Roland has|pg||
nt|mariner1: scheduled this weekend! -|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|athene: hard for it to be flat without being the same contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: or make spades be 3-1|pg||
nt|athene: is there anything else that adds up to 1620?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but will they reach it?|pg||
nt|frankaus: peter hall - has a good chapter on competative X's in his book competative bidding at pairs - well worth a read|pg||
nt|sga1: Let us see whether NS can stop at 3@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: in 8 bd matches,  tough to lose a hand lke that and recover |pg||
nt|athene: i suppose e-w might go 3 down redoubled - but that's still 1 imp difference|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east will surely double if north cues clubs at any point|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@H: non-minimum, no shortage. I agree with non-minimum. This is a very good 13 count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 14, sorry|pg||
nt|athene: it's a very good 14 count, even :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: they must play 3 @D stronger than I do |pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: n/s play a club system (perhaps orange club)  and 1 @D =07 |pg||
nt|mariner1: EW might make 4@H here,,,,,,,, 3N has an issue|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well-judged from west; 2@H might miss the game|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: running scores: http://tinyurl.com/oh5tmv|pg||
nt|othered1: Oh, you meant board 17|pg||
nt|chthonic: Can EW find the way to five tricks?  |pg||
nt|sga1: Now will reach 3@S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|finch: more plausible is one top diamond first|pg||
nt|ady: it is a possibility|pg||
nt|thegarve:  switch to q@d to get an enc/disc signal|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland has many excellent vugraphs on the schedule this weekend!|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: after all south hand is pretty ugly|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so there is an inference that North is just protecting with good shape  |pg||
nt|ady: 5@H   save to much if they find best defence|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt = spade cue?|pg||
nt|chthonic: Against NT, AK and a diamond, followed by a heart shift.  All quite double dummy, though.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sunsamvar: double major fit get E/W going to game|pg||
nt|chthonic: Well...... maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: if diamonds are 5332 with partner having the doubleton you look a bit silly underleading the first round|pg||
nt|sybarra: well true |pg||
nt|othered1: They can take 6 quick ones by your line, but it sitll won'd be clear here|pg||
nt|chthonic: But not in game, either|pg||
nt|othered1: still it would be nice to get a plus EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: very disciplined from S|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they can make 4@S if they find Q@S which is not likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: either that, or just shows general happiness without being able to cue 4minor|pg||
nt|oliverc: or maybe denying a Club cue|pg||
nt|othered1: East does know that west won't have much at all, so actual lie is a possible consideration|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: am told its a sort of polish club with variations |pg||
nt|mariner1: ok a @D lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think its very close to the orange club via Jan Jansma |pg||
nt|athene: this is too costly|pg||
nt|athene: as long as the defence stay away from clubs declarer must lose two tricks in each side suit|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so 2 off here is good for east west, bec 4 h is diff to reach|pg||
nt|frankaus: loser in each suit if they defend accuratly|pg||
pc|hA|nt|thegarve:  hmm|pg||
nt|athene: 1100|pg||
nt|athene: the main thing is for south to NOT bid 4@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dbl gave the @SQ away|pg||
nt|sga1: yes I agree|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: but if they mix firsts and seconds....|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now that East got the chance to double clubs at a lowish level, he will not double 6@H|pg||
nt|athene: this is where that style doesn't work so well|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|chthonic: No, it was very difficult, indeed|pg||
nt|othered1: And now it's about overtricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: my aunt Matida said 8 ever 9 never|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mariner1: and off from the top now|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|mariner1: he may not try the hook only in 3@S anyway|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|sybarra: and to the specs, who are always helpful.  I enjoy your comments |pg||
nt|athene: as usual, it's not good for all the strength to be massed in one hand|pg||
nt|athene: no way for west to get in and put the @DQ through|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the @S honours shd provide parking place for the @D|pg||
nt|athene: playing 2@D wld be more fun for E-W than defending 1NT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: looks like 2@d  is the limit  n/s|pg||
nt|ady: I think 1NT better 2nd bit by east    |pg||
nt|athene: so the defence can't get their four tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and not the easiest play,,,, is possible|pg||
nt|mariner1: good to see a player that knows an invitation can be refused|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: declarer just leads up to @SKQ and pitches @D - right|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: easier now|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 spades is to play not an invitation if north has spades i thk, only if north has hearts he should bid on, but here 4 spades makes on the h finess|pg||
pc|h4|nt|finch: I admit I'd have led my AK suit. Dummy is known to be short in diamonds|pg||
nt|thegarve:  why not a@H?|pg||
nt|granguru: establishing the @H might also help|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unfortunately (or rather not, as it is a flat board) this is an occasion when it would be a good time to accept |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: not a great game, but lucky enough|pg||
nt|mariner1: on board 6 Open Room found the 4@H now to make it|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|ady: dont like A@D lead    why not A@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bad news in clubs, but good news in diamonds  |pg||
nt|othered1: There's room for declarer to go wrong here in @C|pg||
nt|chthonic: Declarer must just negotiate the club jack.  After the club and and the third heart, does he drop or finesse?|pg||
nt|chthonic: oh, they blocked the hearts...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS have blocked heart suit|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mariner1: yes now has a couple of ways to make it and both work|pg||
nt|granguru: to avoid losing @Cs..the @C return made things much more easy|pg||

nt|granguru: see you soon|pg||
nt|mariner1: many many more vugraphs coming up!  Roland has been busy!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: assume the dbl showed at least 1 major  better not to commit west to another bid and limit with 1NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: did NS bid to help them?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand comes tumbling home |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|othered1: the @H8 back would be an odd card to return, in standard methods, which I assume NS are not using|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|mariner1: only a 1@D opener, N passed it|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|s9|nt|xenya: actually the @D continuation might have defeated the contract?|pg||
nt|finch: that's a nice play in clubs. gains with Ax and also on this layout|pg||
nt|ady: spec has requested address to find previous results|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|finch: although from South's perspective, if North's 5 was a true card it's either a singleton or J95|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: it doesnt , clubs were played twice , well done on defence|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: the pitches on @S will be difficult for S |pg||
pc|hT|nt|mariner1: well this is one of those STOM hands..... and could decide mathc|pg||
nt|mariner1: STOM - state of match|pg||
nt|sybarra: they might just bid at other table if they think they need it |pg||

nt|athene: 4@H from south now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|xenya: oh yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: risky without discussion - and 1@D might be some strong hands, perhaps, which would make it doubly risky|pg||

nt|xenya: who is to blame here? S for trying to find a few specific cards with N for a slam to be good, or N for converting to 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: no, with a marked 2-suiter (5-5 or more extreme), 3nt is very rarely going to be right|pg||
nt|athene: if partner is strong enough for both suits to run, you are going to make slam|pg||
nt|athene: and if he isn't, just running one suit isn't going to give you enough tricks for 3nt|pg||
nt|oliverc: absolutely, Bill|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: here decl could have made 3, but just 1 imp--|pg||
nt|othered1: That was certainly a favorable result for NS|pg||
nt|mariner1: so off 2 trying to make it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: bd 6 e/w played 4 @S in the other foom |pg||
mb|1D|nt|thegarve:  an exciting board |pg||
nt|sybarra: *room |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: is south an opener?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: part scores here although action is possible|pg||
mb|d|nt|finch: you would do well to bid to 6@D. You would also do well to make it; it's not obvious what the right line is|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S now from south perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: he can't have much more and not overcall 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he isn't sure what the double means - but it was t/o last time :)|pg||
nt|othered1: EW can try for slam on the @C finesse, and west might have to pull in a notch or two with all those cards and @D support|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|oliverc: I have never been a fan of Weak jump-shifts that aren't based on at least a decent|pg||
nt|oliverc: tolerance for partner's suit|pg||
nt|oliverc: trump leads will give West no chance here|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  should make 6NT by playing q@s from hand without releasing a@S to attempt to create an entry to dummy |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe they can duck|pg||
nt|athene: well 3@D looks intermediate to me...but there's surely risk of losing hearts? perhaps it shows 4@H6@D or something weird|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont mind it,  as long as I am playing with pard's where I can get out |pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H pass or correct|pg||
nt|mariner1: N should pass,,,, his AJ @S is good as 3|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: but I agree, it's not at all clear|pg||
mb|d|nt|thegarve:  you can play a 3@S reponse to 2@C as 4@S and 5@D|pg||
nt|finch: obviously you can make double dummy after the @SQ holds by enplaying North. |pg||
nt|thegarve:  or 2@c 2@d 3@s as 4!@S and 5@d from declarer too|pg||
mb|r|nt|othered1: But east has gotten @S into the picture and west knows his fit there isn't very good.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|finch: maybe you should do... win the lead, queen of spades winning, ace of spades, oops, what else is there to play for?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: all 2 no bids are forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: We are in Wroclaw (German: Breslau), the chief city of the historical region of Lower Silesia in south-western Poland, situated on the Oder river|pg||
nt|mariner1: N lucky the @D are 2 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: 6@S however is not going to make|pg||
nt|ady: can then cash all clubs  and try diamonds    and end play North|pg||
nt|ady: was afraid they might find that|pg||
nt|frankaus: not 4 me - but in poland good hands are opened 1@C so more likely that the hand will be opened|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: well looking at EW's hands, 6@S doesn't look all that bad|pg||
nt|thegarve:  a little sad that you do not possess 9@s|pg||
nt|finch: yes, single dummy 6@S looks a pretty good spot. You would have been worried about a heart lead in 6NT|pg||
nt|thegarve:  no-one has 9 0r 10 asks even in relay systems|pg||
nt|chthonic: One IMP away on last board, when declarer played first one club -- the king, and it was ducked.  Then went on with spades and diamonds, making ten tricks.|pg||
nt|othered1: @H lead is good and indicated by the auction (if 3@C is natural), so delcarer likely will get only 10 tricks here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|janhamhurg: and repeating the opening suit shows min, so no trouble here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|athene: declarer is likely to get the clubs wrong|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how he will be able to get a count on east's hand|pg||
nt|athene: the only thing that might force him to play right is lack of dummy entries to take the double finesse against the @CK10|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|oliverc: looks like -2 now|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|finch: Do you cash the @SA first or not?|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S areasonable spot    but unlucky here|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|finch: this line is in trouble if North has 3 clubs and 9xx of spades|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, just a bit of bad luck -- but almost the same in the other room|pg||

nt|thegarve:  did well to make 4@s in the other room with mirror distributions|pg||
nt|athene: of course once east showed up with @DAK, @CK, @SQ, he can't have @HA as well as that would be a 1nt opener|pg||
nt|oliverc: I wonder what 1@S-1NT-2@C-2@D would have shown|pg||
nt|chthonic: On board 19, there WAS a swing -- but the defense prevailed.  Nicely done.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but he was doubtless going up with the @HK anyway, even if not sure|pg||
nt|athene: (declarer was)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|oliverc: Well that makes the match nicely poised with 2 Boards to go|pg||
nt|athene: yes, or respond 1NT intending to bid 3@D over 2@C, if you think you are worth it - the point being you don't lose hearts|pg||
nt|oliverc: right|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|thegarve:  @c lead let it through|pg||

nt|thegarve:  3NT makes sense if its natural|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: lets see who bids spades first|pg||
nt|chthonic: The lead is growing again, so PETRO needs a swing.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sybarra: 2 @d ?  or?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|sybarra: 3 @D I mean |pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve:  England striding on|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|athene: 3@S is quite aggressive but they still have lots of room to do their little dance and stop in 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: 1NT with a five card major -- the ongoing debate.  With two unstopped side suits, I would not be tempted, |pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: club lead in OR  and later a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|ady: this looks like down 2|pg||
nt|thegarve:  NI down by 1 and Scotland up by 4 so its down to the wire|pg||
nt|athene: but south must like his @DK and @CA|pg||
nt|athene: @SX @HKQx @DAQxxx @Cxxxx hardly impossible for south's bidding?|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he needs the @DJ with all that to make slam good|pg||
nt|sybarra: and yet another 2 nt |pg||
nt|frankaus: @S lead will help declarer|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be the spec can help- i thk this hand could be opened with 1 dia having a 3 club in revers|pg||
nt|chthonic: and this should be down easily.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N showing a limit raise maybe with 3 cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 1NT not terribly attractive with two dead black suit holdings, especially if you don;t play Puppet (or have some other way of disclosing 5th heart in time). of course, the choice ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: of opening all depends on whether you are willing to raise a 1NT response to 2NT. i would be on this S hand, so I would open 1H|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|janhamhurg: this beats 2 no|pg||
nt|frankaus: @H lead sets it - wd|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|athene: @SA, @DK, spade ruff, then @DAQ pitching a club, and 4th diamond|pg||
nt|athene: if east follows you pitch another club|pg||
