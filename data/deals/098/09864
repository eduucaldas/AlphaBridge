nt|Walddk3: Karaivanov played it very well in the closed room|pg||
nt|charles_l: would you open N 1@d or 2@c playing precision?|pg||
nt|mariner1: good auction after the 2@C opener to get to 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: my style if you open 1@D here you deny this hand|pg||

nt|iain sime: 15/17|pg||
nt|paulg: would you open Lucas 2@h with Cuthbertson's hand, or is it too playable in spades?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|werge: Til de knap så rutinerede: Når man åbner på Nords hånd, skal man regne med at komme for højt ganske ofte|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  it was better than the previous Lucas 2@H that McGinley came up with earlier|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|iain sime: I guess that is why he didn't.|pg||

pc|cK|pg||

nt|boltonian2:  some action here maybe|pg||
nt|capercliff: how any @d over 1@s?|pg||
nt|capercliff: many*, 2 is normal I gues|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  just the two I think|pg||
nt|iain sime: Double?|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  might double to think of the alternative|pg||
nt|capercliff: the 4@h's makes t awkward|pg||
nt|paulg: just a simple overcall, don't want to lose the opportunity to get hearts into the game or show power later|pg||

mb|1C!|an|Precision Club|nt|iain sime: ok, that changes it.|pg||

mb|1D!|an|!Hs|mb|p|mb|1H!|mb|1N|nt|capercliff: I would not open this 2@c|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  might make it more difficult for EW to realise that diamonds are going to be the problem for 6@H though|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Den spærrer godt, sådan en 1 @C|pg||
nt|capercliff: would anyone here pen 2@c?|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|iain sime: Dave Walker passed 2C in the hope of being on lead v. 3NT.|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: nej|pg||

nt|iain sime: Well stopped; the trump break sinks 5H.|pg||
nt|paulg: yes, it's not an obvious game to bid and (it may be) unlucky to find the 4-1 trump break|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|paulg: the @cK lead asks for upside count|pg||
pc|hK|pg||

nt|paulg: diamond or @c3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|ebrok: det ligner 5 Imp til Schou|pg||

mb|p|nt|pkl: 12 stik, tror jeg|pg||

nt|boltonian2:  3@S|pg||
nt|paulg: i like to be able to bid clubs over a short 1@c|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  at this vul I imagine Cuthbertson will come in at some point later|pg||
nt|capercliff: unless they bid lots of @s first|pg||
nt|paulg: sure, but an immediate 3@c would probably have scooped the pot|pg||
nt|iain sime: EW scored 300 in the other room.|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  though if McGinley bids a @S they will be in four before that can happen|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  maybe W will only bid 3|pg||
nt|capercliff: I would imagine 3@c is not natural for some reason|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  an easy 4@S should steady things though|pg||
nt|paulg: another thin game that will probably fail|pg||

nt|capercliff: hmm|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  hmm, not where we imagined this auction would end up|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is interesting indeed|pg||
nt|iain sime: playing equal level conversion, 2D does not show extras.|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  no, though I think I would still have gone for 3@C with the N hand|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  ok, on the plus side we now have communication with the other room|pg||
nt|iain sime: We seem to have established a link with the other room, so should get comparisons.|pg||
nt|paulg: Howie-McGinley are a conservative pair and so far this has not been working to their advantage|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg: Walker is a passed hand|pg||
nt|capercliff: the N bid is what I was wondering about|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|boltonian2:  me too, unless W thought 3NT might still be the intended spot|pg||
pc|h9|nt|paulg: i think most top players would respond 1@s on this hand for instance|pg||
nt|capercliff: how many brds per set?|pg||

nt|iain sime: Maiolani has got on the board, but this could be another six or eight imps to Steel.|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  a little unilkely seen as he had denied a major|pg||

nt|capercliff: Walker might take some time with this one|pg||
