nt|Walddk6: This is the last board of the match. Many thanks again to Martin Stoszek, our very capable operator in Bonn. Well done!|pg||

nt|haans: spade lead?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk6: Also thanks to our excellent commentators: Kath Nelson and David Bird|pg||
nt|bjurn: 2@D is natural with either 6+@D or 5+@D with 4+@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S ON for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|milton_se: no, KD|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bt: tough to bid now though|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and 5@C for E/W|pg||
nt|milton_se: not easy to find now|pg||
nt|bt: should be easier|pg||
nt|papa hall: with some very, very good guessing, maybe|pg||
nt|vugraph815: Good preempt by West, kept them out of the cold slam|pg||
nt|milton_se: but ruffing first D high|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: better pass at 4@C :)|pg||
nt|papa hall: Now cI don't think 4@S will be an issue any more|pg||
nt|arvid: 7@C is a good contract|pg||
nt|diaoff: Absoloutely|pg||
nt|milton_se: excellent 6C if not S lead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|magnus_e: I will bid 1S with norths hand|pg||

nt|milton_se: sorry 7C|pg||
mb|p|nt|diaoff: No problem, any lead|pg||
nt|arvid: The problem is the bidding|pg||
nt|diaoff: True :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, missed one M trick|pg||
nt|diaoff: Maybe an old-fashioned jump-shift to 3@C would hhave made life easier|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: great minds think alike|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Peterson passed, but much better bid 1@S|pg||
nt|milton_se: you see that as old-fashioned?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: ruff spade. lead a heart|pg||
nt|milton_se: no, sir, we old men bid 1S|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk6: Finally, our appreciation to the DBV (German Bridge Federation) for bringing this prestigious event to BBO vugraph. Josef Harsanyi, Matthias Schüller and Peter Eidt have been ...|pg||
nt|Walddk6: instrumental in setting up a great show|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good old checkback 2@C i assume|pg||
nt|milton_se: serious mistake, I'd say|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: The club position is unfavourable.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|brolucius: A club lead would kill the game before it had a chance. He has led a club.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a rotten lead for the Estonians |pg||
nt|milton_se: me too, but only 1-suited as this|pg||
nt|milton_se: easy enough then 1H - 3C - 4D...|pg||
nt|milton_se: well on their way now|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|milton_se: good bid!|pg||
nt|diaoff: A kibitzer suggest 5@D exclusion BW over 3@C, but this will also work I guess|pg||
nt|milton_se: can you be sure that 3C promises this suit?|pg||
nt|diaoff: No, that is the problem|pg||
nt|milton_se: Berik is 24 VPs up for the championship now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|magnus_e: nice play|pg||
nt|papa hall: Arne must be getting old...that was his longest thinking pause ever|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good line by declarer|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|diaoff: Strange, shouldn't 5NT ask for two honnors?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: take out double better than bidding suit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|milton_se: we both do -- at least in theory :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: Playing a different NT range, South would open 1NT and play the contract after a transfer response.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: when i lead a doubleton my partner never has AQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Never? That's unlucky.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe it just seems that way :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: very good slam, but not much room to find it|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|brolucius: Keep playing and one day...|pg||
nt|haans: they were not prepared|pg||
nt|bjurn: I'm not sure why W didnt bid 3@D, maybe a bit too weak?|pg||
nt|diaoff: Alternatively, Andersson could have shown a two-suiter with 3@D|pg||

mb|3N|nt|diaoff: ...or have they also started to apply the modern pick-a-slam conv? :)|pg||

nt|milton_se: ... not easy to take back 20 imps from Berik|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: yes a good old fashioned bid|pg||
nt|papa hall: For those of you not familiar with Swedish geography....2@H is called Askeröd...named after a little town in southern Sweden|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many time a overcall at level 1 is more effective that a preemptive at 3 level|pg||
nt|bt: 2N was conservative?|pg||
nt|magnus_e: on board 14 Törnqvist in other room showed 13+ with norhs hand. It led to 4@s. Good evaluation. |pg||
mb|p|pc|s9|nt|yo_yo: South didnt think north could have the @H suit|pg||
