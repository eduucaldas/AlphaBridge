nt|mcarroll: Hi David, Mike|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: Welcome to Round Robin 3rd: Germany II - Netherlands|pg||
nt|ady: hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie hard not to see 10 tricks for n/s but nmot really a biddable game|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  might make  on a low diamond lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: now its right|pg||
nt|lestergold: now the bidding fits |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  good evening|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  welcome back|pg||

nt|serhat: hi .. I am abit upset for my friends.. but good luck to all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Surprised N passed|pg||
nt|ady: north did not open?|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is going on here?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now they have no chance of getting to 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: and east opened on 8 pts      must be wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi  all Mike from England here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Bonn for the annual Nations Cup. Seven 12-board matches in the round-robin. This is a match from round 6|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Your commentators are Julien Clément, France, and Jahangir Ahmed, Pakistan|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: input error?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: looks like N/S are headed for 3N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 2@C rubinshol - xfert|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is unless e/w are determined to offer a penalty|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Mike Gold, England, and Nigel Kearney, New Zealand. I am Roland Wald from Denmark|pg||
nt|jujux: 2@h is both majors (at least 4 4) weak|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi guys|pg||
nt|jujux: hi|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Lukas Schenk|pg||
pc|dA|nt|boltonian2:  a trick short if played by S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bonn-nations-cup.bridgeverband-westfalen.de/2009/liveticker/09_05_20_team.html  for running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: Lukas, are they really playing board 1?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all |pg||
nt|mmmakela: friendly dias so easy make|pg||
nt|jujux: Last segment had nice boards let's hope this one will be fun too :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcarroll: must be input |pg||
nt|lestergold: must be a different board the bidding doesnt matcvh the hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: yes, its board 1! no mistake ;-)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But the bidding does not match the cards they have|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At least not the cards *we* have|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: the cards are wrong, but its board 1|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: ak and J of spades looks deadly|pg||
nt|duschek: Good evening from Copenhagen|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however A K and J @s would beat 3Nt|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, hmm, not overly convinced by a @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is wrong with a top spade to look at dummy?|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  seems as though partner is not going to have a killing suit anyhow|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  and the @S might well be the safer lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S could make only 2@C 3@D 2@H 1@S -|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like this will be let thru now only a club a heart and 2 spades for e/w|pg||
nt|duschek: I wonder if West could be squeezed into an endplay after @SA,K,J|pg||
nt|lestergold: the tempo given to declarer|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now np for N/S - can establish one @H more|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  still need to get that @S trick, EW might still  come to another @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards lie very favourably here and close to amking ten tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evening all|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  providing E ducks two rounds|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d6|nt|boltonian2:  it is let through now|pg||
nt|jujux: As the cards lie, the declarer shouldn't have too much pbs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bridge_one: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly no probs in 3|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d2|pc|hT|nt|jujux: N/S plays multi and they decided to give 2@h the signification of a  weak majors bicolor |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and clubs 4-4 if original club lead|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: normal enough NT opening and transfer here|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Everything is lying nicely for declarer here so he'll probably end up with nine or ten tricks|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|Walddk5: Good evening to Jacob Duschek|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: Welcome to Round 7, Estonia - Netherlands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: the match began earlier than expected because lunch isnt ready yet|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|bridge_one: W could also pass at 1Nt|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  good evening Jacob|pg||
nt|serhat: 10 tricks unbeatable for many ways to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer has to play to ruff the heart inhandn case he has 2 spade losers and he doesnt |pg||
nt|lestergold: know about the dim position either|pg||
nt|lestergold: well does now|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course this is not a good game to be in just happens to roll in if one is in it|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d5|nt|duschek: Good evening|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Jacob|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: South is playing  perfectly|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c2|pc|s8|nt|bridge_one: 1 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: but is he? didnt he need to preserve the link in diamonds|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  will have a count on the hand too, so will be no problem finding the endplay|pg||
nt|duschek: North/South do not form a regular partnership - Michael Askgaard usually plays with Gregers Bjarnarson; they have been part of the Danish national team for some 5 years|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Vladimir Ivanov from Russia|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bridge_one: no - he must play in this way - now no defence for West|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he cant go wrong eiother way|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: now it is held to 3 as the 9h will force the last trump|pg||
nt|serhat: now best way to play is 9 of C and pich a dia from dummy|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk7: and welcome back to Markku M. Mäkelä|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: that's true. However a British International collated stats about transferring with a five card major after a 1NT opening. Over three years, he found it was 70% correct to ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer. |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes safest|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: well done !|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, could have been imps either way there, but eventually surfaced on the danish side|pg||
nt|jujux: Nice try by the declarer|pg||

nt|vugraphzpt: All before last round|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Hanging in there for directors ruling and final score|pg||
nt|poohbear: on board 26 Feldman hesitated in PO seat and his partner led dummy's first bid suit which I think was the right lead but wasnt at all clear to do|pg||

nt|jbgood: great job David!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: The ruling will clearly affect P&L final position|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: The delay is ruling and gettting final scores delivered to me|pg||
nt|poohbear: so the @h lead might not be so wrong. If the directors had asked the first 3 experts and they all said a @s lead then as long as they were sure about the hesitation the ruling ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: would be made already|pg||
nt|poohbear: no ruling as of yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: OK the interesting part is as usual - the permanent partnerships again do well|pg||
nt|poohbear: So one minor point although it might not be relevant|pg||
nt|po-s: David, it would be sad if the reverse were true|pg||
nt|poohbear: The screen got pushed to Feldman who was the only person who had a chance to act so clearly it was his hesitation|pg||
nt|poohbear: Players give honest opinions|pg||
nt|poohbear: about the action the director asks |pg||
nt|po-s: how many did lead a heart?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|poohbear: this is the hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|po-s: I guess the bidding was similar at many tables|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Now West hesitated and East led a heart|pg||
nt|poohbear: which I think is the correct lead but not at all clearcut|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Not wanting to cast anything on anybody I would actively not lead a heart in this situation. |pg||
nt|jbgood: hesitated ,|pg||
nt|poohbear: anyway I am off to enjoy some Cavendish free food:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: why put myself in harms way - they cant call the director because I DIDNT lead a heart|pg||
nt|poohbear: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: I await ruling and results|pg||
nt|henryb: Aren't Pepsi and Feldman on the same side, and couldn't Lev be thinking if for example he were 5-5 in the red suits?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: The screens dont help one always knows who is thinking based on the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: No screen runs top left to bottom right|pg||
nt|henryb: I mean Pepsi thinking|pg||
nt|henryb: Yes, but it could have been Pepsi thinking about whether to pass 3N|pg||
nt|henryb: the tray went to Pepsi and Feldman|pg||
nt|vugraphzpt: Which would you back Pepsi to be thinking of bidding over 3NT or partner doubling - anyway as I said why put yourself in harms way|pg||
nt|jbgood: of course S didnt have any bid|pg||

nt|april7: something is wrong|pg||

nt|lestergold: 9 tops|pg||
nt|po-s: I was here before, and then Mattsson played for Germany....|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Paul Heckett - Tony Waterlow for Journalists|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hackett|pg||
nt|po-s: better...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: depending also on distribution and honors - 10xxxx is different from QJ9xx|pg||
nt|duschek: Match started off with an interesting hand - let's hope it continues that way|pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 25 count for e/w looks like they will play this in 3N but cards are spitting at them|pg||
nt|jujux: Someone knows what kind of system E/W are playing ?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 12 tricks in spades EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: slam for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 20/20 here, but 4@S for EW |pg||
mb|1S|nt|frankaus: @S partial looks to be the spot|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like 4 card suits strong NT by EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: cards all wrong for n/s to venture very far in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Estonian Beach Diamond. I kid you not|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland would like to be in a slam here|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Strong Club system|pg||
nt|mmmakela: in NT too this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 7 cold in 3 denominations|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: grand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@D is a good start|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Thomas Gotard from Germany|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|jujux: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bonn-nations-cup.bridgeverband-westfalen.de/2009/liveticker/09_05_20_team.html  for running scores in all matches. The 16 teams are didvided into two groups. France ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: leading Group A|pg||
nt|lestergold: so would I as the clubs lie well|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good afternoon to Marion Canonne from France|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: indeed, but 10xxxx is virtually useless in NT, whereas it might make some tricks if it is the trump suit|pg||
nt|duschek: I am not sure they will bid it though; West will invite, but East will probably decline with 16 HCP and a flat distribution|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6 NT/W 100 %|pg||
nt|xenya: may well reach it now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 10 vs 10 no singeltons, hard to bid|pg||
nt|xenya: but E has opened...|pg||
nt|xenya: W rather|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3rd hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|boltonian2:  yes not the most attractive game, especially after a @C lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Mike here from Uk|pg||
mb|3C|nt|frankaus: may make 4 here|pg||
nt|sybarra: just going to say,  might make 4 |pg||
nt|frankaus: light red 4 NS as well|pg||
nt|april7: W will lose 3@C and 1 @H trick, because not enough entries for the finesses needed|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure 4 will make,  doesnt he lose 1 ht, 1 sp, and 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|frankaus: cant imagine any S not passing  so looks like more technical problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we are stuck via connex |pg||
nt|april7: 4th @S is also en entry, so 10 tricks are really available|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: anderson is still thinking|pg||
nt|frankaus: 0 H if W gets it all right|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Mike|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure he has enough entries |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well here go |pg||
nt|wechwech: hello :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: its a seven depending on good hearts suit behaviour|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Well, North will be quite happy defending 2@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: possible also 2@S by West instead 2@C with 3S and a sgl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. But spades don't break either - not a nice hand for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Alex Wilkinson|pg||
nt|jujux: Hello marion :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 @S was too hasty|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: Marsal/Mattson are no regular pdship, but I am sure they have played lots of boards together|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: so a nice bidding contest for them|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3/2 break and some 4/a breaks also|pg||
nt|lestergold: some 4/1 breaks too|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  good evening|pg||
nt|serhat: hi :)|pg||
nt|jujux: Hi Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: @C@C@Cthen @D fionesse ,@H finesse ,@D and @H finesse ,@S  and another @H finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bonn-nations-cup.bridgeverband-westfalen.de/2009/Englisch/Englisch_00_Frame.html|pg||
nt|duschek: Sorry, can't count - with those 9 decent HCP West should bid game himself opposite partner's 15-17|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes 9 points with  good intermediates|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  High cards are evenly balanced but E/W won the the contract because they have the spade suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 6 rolls in in three denominations but that doesnt make them great slams|pg||
nt|jujux: He has a lot to bid that way. If they play kind of a standard system 1@c 1@s 4@s with 21 and 5@c AQJ10 is a little pessimistic |pg||
nt|mmmakela: must be a stronger route available|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bridge_one: Hi Alex|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  I think I would have bid 2@S|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  but as you say, they don't break much better on this occassion|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Capital punishment in France if you support with three cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: :)|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  sounds reasonable|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  i will put off my plans to relocate there when I am older|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: website I have at moment |pg||
nt|lestergold: normal bidding normal lead and no play today sadly|pg||
nt|serhat: this board went a bit cheap!|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Marion|pg||
nt|lestergold: not surprisingly they failed to bid this perfecto game needing a 2/2 spade break|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|projekt1: hi again|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Bonn for the annual Nations Cup. Seven 12-board matches in the round-robin. This is a match from round 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the lowest scoring of the 3 grands but as itys not mps it hardly mtters|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting that west rkc'd in hearts but opted fror the dim slam|pg||
nt|tomi2: Germany II is traditionaly the spot for players from the host Bridge Club (Bonn)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: nobody here from them in closed room ;-)|pg||
nt|tomi2: rkc in hearts gave hin all usefull information he needed|pg||
nt|lestergold: but could well be flat|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Difficult for declarer to avoid six losers for one down, or two down if defenders find the trump promotion|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Shirley Ybarra, USA, Martin Carroll, Ireland, Josef Harsanyi and Avram Kreisberger, Germany. I am Roland Wald from Denmark|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Lukas Schenk|pg||
nt|april7: something is wrong with the name of the players|pg||
nt|mcarroll: its ok now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: hi... brd 13 was played already|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not anymore|pg||
nt|april7: now it might  be ok|pg||
nt|projekt1: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: 7@H   worst of grand slams    7NT  or 7@D  can make if north has 4 or 5 hearts and k@S  or has JXXX hearts and KJ@S|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi Josef|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: west probably opted for dims in case hearts didnt break and hoping that there would be alternative plays in 7d in that eventuality|pg||
nt|lestergold: a 20/20 hand pointswise!|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tomi2: yes and east had no reason to remove this|pg||
pc|s9|nt|april7: helpfull|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Let me find a link to the E-W convention card. They play an odd system called Dwururka|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with AQ8  for 10 in the dummy i think it is netter play small @C for the 10|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless that is ur name is Roland in which case they are too good|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course not|pg||
nt|ady: 7@D  of course could go off to a ruff if north had 5 hearts|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|duschek: I would expect that too - E/W at the other table play a weak notrump but will certainly bid game after an auction resembling 1@D-1@H-1NT-3NT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: can claim now|pg||
mc|10|nt|lestergold: well you cant deman 100 percent for a grand slam- you need better odds than for a small slam its true|pg||
nt|lestergold: no trump game if played by west may be let thru on spade lead tho|pg||
nt|duschek: South will lead a club there as well, choosing the better of his holdings in the unbid suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: but probably not even make then|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Translate into English, Mike please|pg||

nt|Vugraphzqs: here is now the TD|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes and @C by declarer gave them another chance|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: because of the 3@h bidding|pg||
nt|april7: 1@C - 1@D -  !NT  - 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: sorry, because of the 2@s...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: it was explained by Pazur: invitational with shortage|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: but the explantation was on both sides the same so its ok now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: lets go to board 15 :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: in those short matches and tournaments of course luck is an important factor. you make decisions that will bring or cost you lots of imps and sometimes you need good breaks to make ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: your bidding successfull|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Anders Sigsgaard|pg||
nt|asig: Hello|pg||
nt|serhat: but the chance is just above 40%. is it good enough Roland?:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland requires 12.85%|pg||
nt|Walddk7: .89|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4h a spread for n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: this hand with far more points cannot make game|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: http://www.bonn-nations-cup.bridgeverband-westfalen.de/2009/BBO_00_Frame.htm  the page with running scores|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 25 combined with long suits here for n/s but......|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 the limit|pg||
mb|1C|nt|frankaus: E will not pass this out LOL|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n does make|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  a bit short of 5@C, but not sure will stop short...|pg||
nt|lestergold: in fact come to think of it not a bad slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT   or 5@C|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: nasty for East over 1@S |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  W will certainly bidding 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w can make up to 5h but at favourable even 6c is a good save|pg||
nt|wechwech: it is encouraging with 4 trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 11 tricks in NT or @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bonn-nations-cup.bridgeverband-westfalen.de/2009/liveticker/09_05_20_team.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Look at the CC I gave you for explanations of bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.geocities.com/daniel_neill_2000/sys/Dwururka.txt|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c too|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  ay some point|pg||
nt|lestergold: well good enuf for Roland but unlike previous hand cant make sadly|pg||
nt|wechwech: (i meant 3@c)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I only bid the slams that make|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 NT seems clear here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bridge_one: If north pass sure lead @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@h is a surprise for me|pg||
nt|duschek: E/W make 5@H, and 6@C-X is down -300 on a diamond guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: exatly a profit|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  so is 2@H, his partner has passed once, might do again|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Routine 3NT for N/S but any West who opens a weak two spades will regret it|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|tomi2: other room in 7@H on the last hand, so a small pick-up for the Dutch Juniors|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  might get to 2@H now, not sure how that will go|pg||
nt|mdgraham: flaws for double: only three hearts. Flaws for 2@C: empty suit. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: now DBL by East isn't penalty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it should be|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  ok, maybe they are :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think West would Dbl - can't be penalty ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i will be surprised if par is reached harly ever is in this sort of situation|pg||
nt|serhat: that is 100%|pg||
nt|serhat: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: the nu are the only one in the world who does but i havent seen ur name in world championship|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: lights green many will psyche with N hand|pg||
nt|april7: no need for E to go to 4@H with his hand|pg||
nt|frankaus: i have an occasional pd that would bid 1NT with N - |pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s will compete to 5c i guess and then take their chances against 5h if its bid|pg||
nt|Walddk7: go further back|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4 on a finesse good odds for a vulnerable game|pg||
mb|p|nt|duschek: I would rather leap to 4@H single-handedly - does not require that much from partner|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I participated in the 1886 Nepal Bowl|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 actually|pg||
nt|mmmakela: in spades|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: 5@C   the better contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes in 5c declarer can play for safety in clubs cashing ace and then leading up tothe club in 3n he has to take the club finesse to preserve communications|pg||
nt|lestergold: which would be a disaster for example if the stiff k was offside|pg||
nt|ady: might be right to duck first round of clubs|pg||
nt|tomi2: have been asked about the format. 16 teams were drawn into 2 groups and play a RR there. then only the first of each group reaches the final (I think 3 segments) while all others ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: play a swiss with full carryover|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, I am not convinced by 2@D, by they are not doubled so...|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  W should have decided what to do over 1@C, this seems a strange way to do things|pg||
nt|asig: Notice N's use of Stayman on this hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: tricky lead|pg||
nt|tomi2: Marsal tried to hit partners long suit? :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes probably is right to|pg||
nt|tomi2: in bridgebase he would quicly use the undo button and try to lead something else :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Vugraphzqs: now its right ;-)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 2@H is playble for N/S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West has penalty-passed 1@S. So why is dbl of 2@C not penalty? |pg||
nt|bridge_one: the only way to play 4@H dbl ?|pg||
nt|duschek: Now who would have expected this auction?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Ruud von Seida|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I am 134 years old|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|frankaus: such poor suits so bid NT ROFL|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he hit someones long suit|pg||
nt|boedhy: hi all|pg||
nt|jujux: It s an interesting sequence, I m not sure 3@c would be the choice of everybody |pg||
nt|lestergold: ht switch needed|pg||
nt|lestergold: with such low spade pips must surely try and beat it with a ruff|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bridge_one: me no|pg||
nt|lestergold: west cannot have passed surely?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i knew that Roland|pg||
nt|serhat: what is 3c? fit howing or?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Marion said it|pg||
nt|serhat: showing|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they m,ay just bid a pip too many off these cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: still only 1 tricks|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, on this way, W will think his partner has been invited to the auction 3 times and not done anything|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i predicted non par but this atrocity is unbelievable|pg||
pc|h6|nt|boltonian2:  though in reality, partner could never have really evaluated the cards he needed anyhow|pg||
nt|lestergold: no they stopped in time|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Robert knows it's no better than 53% so decided against|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|serhat: ok missed that. ty Marion.. but it is good enough for me to bid 4d|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|boedhy: Yes Nigel interesting point I think its close to opening 2@s probably wouldnt do it |pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: 9 or 10 tricks if J of @D can produce a trick|pg||
nt|asig: His hand is much better playing a suit contract|pg||
nt|mmmakela: diamonds couldn't be better placed and either H or C entry to enjoy them|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|nigel_k:  I was delicately avoiding the question of whether I might do it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: is there no reason to cash a of @H first or maybe even ak? |pg||
nt|april7: has to play @H now anyway|pg||
nt|bridge_one: bec 1@S DBL p p; 2@C DBL isn't penalty but means 2/3 @C ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: disagree.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so pass can be only 1@C (impossible) or a penalty hand|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  I dont think West thought this was going to end in 2@D nevertheless|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I would have wasted the @S entry, but Kirmse must have a plan |pg||
nt|lestergold: oh it was what i gfeared|pg||
nt|mmmakela: too late|pg||
nt|lestergold: he should have found the ruff- why has pard switched to a ht- if not a singleton then he would have switched to a club|pg||
nt|jujux: I m not sure but I think they play the convention that says to lead the K with AK when a singleton|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N played highest S pip available but it was the 5, S can't read it|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed -- the @D return doesn't make much sense it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: wellit was certainly an error|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: might have been great for defence if east had led from jack six of clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: it would have been a horrible moment for north on the second round of clubs|pg||
nt|ady: yes    might well finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: however play will speed up and blood pressure will drop when he sees the pesky ten of clubs shortly|pg||
nt|ady: as it is no problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he seems to be very reluctant to advance that club but what else can he do now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: no technical problem, i am still here :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: whjat is north in the tank about?|pg||
nt|tomi2: every time I was operator in Bonn the players played so quickly that I could not follow the game|pg||
nt|duschek: In fact, bidding the West hand is not easy - wrong hand for an initial double, and difficult to show the hand otherwise. Perhaps 1@H and then 3@H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has not shown a fraction of his strength with his hanmd most of us would bid 4h immediately rather than drop out after a competitivie auction|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: the contract is very unlucky to be beatable but they should have unravelled tehir defensive communication systems|pg||
pc|c5|nt|serhat: good stop|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: spade hook in reserve if dias don't produce more than 1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: no other source of anything remotely approaching nie tricks|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Very good duck of the KD by East|pg||
nt|lestergold: and robert is prayin g for the qh not to come down|pg||
nt|jujux: 3@c is probably a 6 4 no ? while u say 2@s with either 55 (when u opened 1@c with 5@s) or when no bids are available|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sT|nt|boltonian2:  I would have favoured double, then 4@H, as W seems to strong in hight cards for a straight 4@Hs|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|asig: Had S answered 2@h/@s he would have passed that too|pg||
pc|d8|nt|boltonian2:  especially with a void|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: if you've got a penalty hand, then you should double. Why wait for partner to do it for you?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: depending on agreements - many play how i told, but it is right also play natural and DBL by East penalty|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bridge_one: i use dbl at 1Nt to give strong hand - 3@H about same cards without one A |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: phew he says|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: agreed, agreements matter, but once West passes 1@sx for penalties, reckon all doubles penalties|pg||
nt|lestergold: its absurd what he needs from his partner to make game is so little that his partner will often not be able to value his hand- a  little stuffing in spades and dims would usually ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: be enuf|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
mc|9|nt|boltonian2:  not sure why E did not dble for penalty regardless of this argument, surely that should be penalty|pg||
nt|lestergold: well surely 13 imps away here|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh perhaps not misguessed diamodns|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  yes|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, 12 imps instead|pg||
nt|duschek: 12 imps only, then|pg||
nt|Walddk7: No, he speaks French|pg||
nt|lestergold: at end of day tho why on eafrth would pard lead the oppositions big side suit|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes set up a long heart to get rid of spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: and south cant lead spades of course|pg||
nt|tomi2: 6@D needs @SK with the leader and hearts 4-3?  those contracts only work, when you don't bid them|pg||
nt|ady: yes     if south leads a spade will have to run it|pg||
nt|duschek: E/W need to guess hearts at 5@H though|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, that is some bid by W, suppose has two good cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Maarten Schollaardt|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: we get another chance |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  confident in partners michaels|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think n/s will be doubling e/w by the time they reach the 5 level|pg||
nt|lestergold: west's bid is clearcut|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West yes, East no dbl at level 5 with 66|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  NS aren't getting into this by the looks of things, that was one advantage of 4@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: 4@h - p - p - p|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well bought by EW|pg||
nt|bridge_one: similar auction in the open room, where North choise to bid 5@C instead pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think north has to bid 5c over 4h|pg||
nt|asig: Hi Maarten|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Transferring into opener's non-suit|pg||
nt|jujux: and 4@c is asking for partner to bid his major in transfer|pg||
nt|wechwech: I've been asking for their system and I was wrong: 3@c was 11-15 with 4 trumps and a singleton, 3@d was relay, then 3nt: 11-13 with @d singleton |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzqs: the final was to fast for me...|pg||
nt|april7: 6@S but not 6 @H!!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes a good example of choosing the 4-4 fit being best|pg||
nt|lestergold: mon francais est tres tres mieux |pg||
nt|mmmakela: test|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk4: Just enter the final contract Lukas|pg||
nt|lestergold: so if 6d is bid east cant fail to make it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cards don't lie well here for EW|pg||
nt|bridge_one: could also open 1Nt - but in IMP with not passed hand from p, can be rigth give 5 good cards in @D|pg||

nt|Walddk4: then lead a card and claim|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so big swing for Croatia|pg||
nt|duschek: However, East had bid 4@C instead of 2@C, probably showing her 6-6, so she had no particular reason to bid her distribution a second time at the 5 level|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: np  Lukas,  they do that sort of thing |pg||
nt|frankaus: could get too high here id NS venture beyond game|pg||
nt|april7: another 3NT,this time from NS also making probably 10 tricks,setting up the @D suit|pg||
nt|boedhy: telling he has a 5crd @s suit and was force to rebid his spades..|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: well enuf entries to do it|pg||
nt|skollie: Estonia needs to score 15 to reach the final, i think|pg||
nt|skollie: Netherlands need 17|pg||
nt|skollie: anybody what happens with a tie?|pg||
nt|skollie: (if NL win 16-14)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: where is the  ç  ?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: français|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont know how to type that nor the acute on the tres|pg||
nt|lestergold: i told, you my franglais is almost infranglible|pg||
nt|mmmakela: HA right no problems, because now must pull trumps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|frankaus: 6@D may have a fair chance|pg||
nt|tomi2: amazingly that de pagter fond a bid and marsal no 2nd|pg||
nt|tomi2: while hop found 2 bids and mattson 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: east will not be encouraged by the original heart  response|pg||
nt|mcarroll: will they even bid 5? seemed to be ready to pass out 3@D|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: anderson pressing on |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  yes and maybe even a little strong for 1NT too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes 17 + 5 cards = 18|pg||
nt|mdgraham: heart lead, goodnight Vienna|pg||
nt|asig: I think NL advances, but I am not sure|pg||
pc|dA|nt|april7: 4NT!|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  yes, on this hand i think Vienna said goodnight regardless|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Gerbrand Hop whose brother is in the South seat|pg||
nt|spooky: Hello all|pg||
nt|asig: Hi|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: well slam played in a part score and that will cost|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They certainly don't want to go beyond the four level here|pg||
nt|asig: So now we may be able to get som inside information|pg||
pc|d8|nt|april7: slam try ,but no chance for 12 tricks in @D|pg||
nt|frankaus: will need to get @D position rigt|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure David (Greenwood) can handle the @D's   for one loser |pg||
nt|april7: whats 5@S?|pg||
nt|april7: asking for quality?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm not sure N can move with xxx of @D|pg||
nt|april7: so 4NT was a better bid!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Surely 4NT from S was called for?|pg||
nt|sybarra: he is the only one who knows he has stiff ace of @D|pg||
nt|projekt1: slam depending on the @s honneurs? ?   or general (quantitative) slam invitation??|pg||
pc|d9|nt|boedhy: but offcourse East has a big hand curious if he will stop below 6@s |pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot depends here now on what declafrer makes of the dims|pg||
nt|mmmakela: might guess dias|pg||
nt|lestergold: kill point|pg||
nt|xenya: tough to make on this lie|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bridge_one: @D 3/3 and finesse in @C to make 9 tricks |pg||
nt|skollie: looks like @C lead wouldve defeated 2@S|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes|pg||
pc|s5|nt|april7: its impo|pg||
nt|frankaus: cash @DA then low towards ten|pg||
nt|april7: even 11 tricks not easy, must guess the @S 10|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sry conn probs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|boedhy: so now west had to go on with @h cue.....I think that is what east wanted|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade of course|pg||
pc|s9|nt|tomi2: pass on 1nt after a 3rd hand opener would not be my choice, 2@D to show your real good dias...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Declarer is best to win this and set up diamonds immediately|pg||
nt|boedhy: 6@s not that bad without @h lead @s 3-2 and @d not too bad for making|pg||
nt|boedhy: with @h lead you need @s queen third onside with @d 3-2|pg||
nt|boedhy: can make 6 by taking @c ace @d ace @s to the ace @h Q throw @d ruff @d and take @s finesse. Not sure is the best play in 4@s tho|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|projekt1: especially in Butler ..|pg||
nt|skollie: switch works just as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: now hard to make in spite ofthe combined points of 23|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: yes and fantastic shape 6/4 hands tend to be useul|pg||
nt|lestergold: 22 did im miscount|pg||
nt|xenya: actually he may go down a lot|pg||
nt|lestergold: he will if he plays a heart to the K!|pg||
nt|xenya: exactly|pg||
nt|xenya: may well do that|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
pc|d4|nt|asig: yes|pg||

nt|ady: think east should have bid 2@D  after 1NT intervention    the pass made west pessismistic  I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think better than taking a finesse guess|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: and guess the @S |pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: well playing in 4dims when both 3n and 5d are laydown is not good|pg||
pc|sT|nt|serhat: interesting line|pg||
nt|lestergold: its still infrangible|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|frankaus: will make from here IMO|pg||
nt|sybarra: cash @H's and stuff E in with @D?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to one of the tournament organisers, Josef Harsanyi|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Josef, welcome  |pg||
nt|xenya: on the other hand, declarer might decide that S can't have that many points|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: but declarer wont be comfortable|pg||
pc|hA|nt|frankaus: G'day Josef|pg||
nt|serhat: he cant go down.|pg||
nt|lestergold: he never could|pg||
nt|serhat: but isnt it easy to cash 2 sps and claim if it even 3-1|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he cant be enjoying the endgame|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|jujux: But he smay still need to rruff a @d if @s are 3-1 no Serhat ?|pg||
nt|serhat: now he would be down if W had 3 sps|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tomi2: playing 4@d is rarley good :)|pg||
nt|projekt1: I dont know, if not the 3@d an underbid?|pg||
nt|skollie: accident in diamonds|pg||
nt|skollie: so de Pagter makes 2@S|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c4|nt|boedhy: if he plays like this he didnt throw a @d on the @c.....|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: congrats on you fine tourney!|pg||
nt|lestergold: bgoth have slightly underbid ading to a combined gross underbid|pg||
nt|tomi2: IMO this goes 100% to east, west bid 3 times facing a 3rd hand opener and then silent partner|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|lestergold: well he was very unlucky with the diamodns but very lucky here with the general layout|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|lestergold: i agree|pg||
nt|mcarroll: me too|pg||
nt|mdgraham: again, EW record their designated undertricks and move on...  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, here in close room probably East would choise 5@H over 5@C|pg||
nt|skollie: i guess Karpov did cash 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: could be an input-mistake, was pretty fast...|pg||
nt|lestergold: and another phew or alors maybe|pg||
nt|jujux: So i u draw trumps (they are 31) and then u play diamond, the opps take and play trump so ur down no ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: that was one of his problems of course|pg||
nt|serhat: :) ofcourse you play 1 round sp then 3 times dia|pg||
mb|p|nt|boltonian2:  chances here though|pg||
nt|jujux: That's better :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|april7: high preemtive bid by E??|pg||
nt|projekt1: w2 in a major|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I wonder what would have happened if that spade finesse lost and they continued with clubs ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: dias lead ruins 7 NT but 7 clubs is the spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: may well reach 4s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|frankaus: if E wasnts to dispupt   in @H  - he will get a rude shock|pg||
nt|april7: but has a weak 3bid|pg||
nt|frankaus: disrupt|pg||
nt|tomi2: E hand looked like bidding 2@D intending to bid 3@C next turn|pg||
nt|skollie: NS will play 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Shirley Ybarra|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4s bound to be reached here|pg||
mb|p|nt|boltonian2:  fairly reasonable slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hello all sorry I am late or early or whatever|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Roland |pg||
nt|spooky: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|skollie: and probably will go 1 down on @D lead|pg||
nt|asig: Down 1, I predict|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hoi Gerban and Anders |pg||
nt|asig: Hello|pg||
nt|lestergold: which as cards lie appears to have some play|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|boltonian2:  I have been in worse slams that 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 2@S by S and 3@S by N?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2NT 4 me|pg||
nt|ady: this looks doomed|pg||
nt|tomi2: will notd find a double?|pg||
nt|tomi2: north|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7@S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *Gerbran |pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 @D? but danger now going to 7 NT maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzqs: sorry for the connection problems here in bonn|pg||
nt|april7: whats going on here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: seems we have to move the table nearer to the router next time|pg||
nt|april7: but how come EW stop short of game with this collection?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the lead will not hurt|pg||
nt|lestergold: ten tlop tricks if he runs it as i expect he will|pg||
nt|serhat: now he can make extra may be|pg||
nt|lestergold: almost impossible on the bid and carding for east not to have led away from the KH but north doesnt want a club thru if hes wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: and at favourable vuilnerability anything can happen|pg||
nt|serhat: I think he is more worried about 0 H on the W|pg||
nt|lestergold: that too is possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: either way he would run the heart|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|april7: might even pass, which is best|pg||
nt|mmmakela: strange bidding, hope they know what they are doing|pg||
pc|d3|nt|april7: just making|pg||
nt|boedhy: Yes I agree Nigel not sure that was the best play in 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's early for Shirley, we forgive her. 6:35 am I believe|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: 1n didnt look a good contract and this looks just as bad if not worse unofortunately|pg||
nt|lestergold: unlucky of course perfectly sensible bidding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S probably happiest player at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing in the 5/3 fit with the diabolical layout|pg||
nt|tomi2: there seems to be a problem with the liveticker, so we have no running results from the other matches|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer will lose 2c 3h and a spade at least and south may end up making all 4 of histrumps the pesky 3h ruffing the third round of clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: phew again!|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: unlucky slams - 6@h down with @S lead, 6@S down with @C lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: 635am yes |pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: seems not...|pg||
nt|lestergold: can afford to lose 2 spades and a heart these h emust|pg||
pc|h9|nt|frankaus: or not :)|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  6@S should be ok with the lucky @H situation|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as a point of method, I reckopn East owes his partner 4@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming that 2@H is forcing and 3@S unlimited|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: sorry for the wrong board|pg||
nt|boedhy: this is high|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I should have been a poet, early for shirley|pg||
pc|h5|nt|duschek: Preferably with the @HKx(x) onside and no diamond lead|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well S should know now that N was willing all along to bid 4@H over 3NT|pg||
nt|spooky: I don't have the latest system update of my Brother(south), but earlier 3@S was 13-15 with a singelton somewhere...|pg||
nt|jujux: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: or the french equivalent|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: but wont make in practice |pg||
nt|bridge_one: to make 12 tricks need to guess the figure of @H - but reasonable to call, making with the finesse|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  which might not have done with a weaker hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@H by South is perfect in my opinion|pg||
nt|sybarra: and on 1st cup of coffee |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  yes, I think I would too, has three aces, which seems good|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as he has limited his hand with 3@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: can he ruff all his club losers with south expending a trump gtrick on ruffing in front of dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: well north better switch to a trump|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now will go down for sure|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|sybarra: here comes a club back |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, probably another big swing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The percentage play for one loser in the heart suit is low to the 9 spot, which is also the winning line here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: SuitPlay whispered in my ear|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5h asks for heart quality missing kjt north arguably hasnt got the bid he cant expect his partner to have an honour card in hearts|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  could have the 10 or J|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the line to play @H to 9 seam the right way to move the suit ... |pg||
nt|jujux: U didn't seem to like the "ouf", so if u prefer u may use the "pffff"|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|boedhy: but can make it with the @d as they are...|pg||
nt|serhat: he can still make extra. but risky|pg||
pc|h8|nt|frankaus: fine defence|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: well defence are getting 4 trump gtricks in any case now|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  this makes it a little awkward, may be worried about a @C loser|pg||
nt|lestergold: i like ouf actually|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk5: Let's see if 'Otto' knows his odds|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht to the nine will deserve some applause|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  not sure will necessarily find it now, with know after @H to 9 will have to chose to cash three spades before the second finesse - if needed - or to drop the !XCJ|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c6|nt|boltonian2:  @CJ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|nigel_k:  I think he is still a trick short|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: now then - run the @H ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes wow|pg||
nt|Walddk5: well done|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well played|pg||
nt|duschek: Declarer will expect the @H9 to lose to the jack or ten, but then he still makes the hand with spades 4-3 and the @HK onside|pg||
nt|lestergold: easier said here in the armchair seat than done correctly in the heat of the match|pg||
nt|serhat: cash sps and dias and play H|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: H!6|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But North may be endplayed|pg||
nt|mmmakela: was 3 @D alerted or was it a wrong card?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: @H6 - I'll get it right eventually |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to John Carruthers from Canada|pg||
nt|boedhy: needed to play a small @s....I think..and playing the 8 in the first round would have made life more difficult for south|pg||
nt|jgc: Good morning all - Roland thought it was late for me but it's merely early|pg||
nt|boedhy: Hi John|pg||
nt|jgc: Fergani-l'Ecuyer are very agressive bidders and often back it up with good card play|pg||
nt|boedhy: has to play @h after the @c J? No think has always an escape...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: TD was called to the table...|pg||
nt|spooky: I am wondering why|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: because of the time, how much time it took playing a card by east|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk4: Our match in round 2 (in about 1 hour and 5 minutes) will be Poland vs Austria|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think North should find the KH switch to beat it now, but it's not easy|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: surely an error not to play a trump|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jujux: Good lead  by Quentin :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: because a certain french lady at my club always says ouf|pg||
nt|lestergold: nothing was running away|pg||
nt|mmmakela: didn't, surprised|pg||
nt|lestergold: frigid now|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer did very well to take a finesse in @Cs, not @Hs|pg||
nt|lestergold: the ht finesse was abit of an illusion south can cover the heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: he hjad to take a club finesse whatever happened|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, true|pg||
nt|lestergold: south must be not best pelased with partners failure to play terump|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h4|nt|sybarra: little ht and ruff, club and ruff |pg||

nt|spooky: looks like East couldn't open a 2suiter|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|boltonian2:  N apparently has a way of showing this 2 suiter|pg||

nt|bridge_one: the reason because all pairs in Italy don't use to open 2Nt with minors is that the open give too much informations at opps if they could play in attack|pg||
nt|jgc: Sure why not?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|duschek: Askgaard in his partnership with Bjarnarson plays this kind of 2NT opener himself, showing at least 5-5 in the minors and below opening strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: so 2@C means @S/@D, so np for N to choise the bid|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe it is outside their range for Michaels, otherwise it's a perfect hand for it|pg||
nt|skollie: N doubles because 2@H would've been forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to stay out of 4 |pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Maarten, didnt see you here before |pg||
nt|skollie: looks like they will be able to stop in 3@H now|pg||
nt|serhat: probably H lead and C K then it is just hapening on it is own|pg||
nt|xenya: which is quite likely|pg||
mb|2C|nt|frankaus: not keen on going negative with any hand - played too much rubber bridge when younger|pg||
nt|lestergold: and in hearts a club lead kills contract immediately|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: NS have to develop their @D trick early to beat the contract|pg||
nt|april7: again 4@H |pg||
nt|tomi2: north will have to check the fit|pg||
nt|projekt1: 2Nt?|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  should be warned by the 2NT bid though|pg||
nt|spooky: South might bid game now..|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes this could get them if trouble if he does |pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: well south knows that his club suit is not lloking too great|pg||
nt|duschek: On the other hand, you will often be able to preempt effectively after such a 2NT opener - I guess this 2NT bid is more efficient as an opening bid than as an overcall over an ...|pg||
nt|duschek: enemy 1@H/@S opening bid|pg||
nt|mmmakela: cllubs 4-4 and dias hook on so 3 NT makes|pg||
nt|jujux: Was a good time for being a junior and open 1nt there was a chance from South hand :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: cards lay well for n/s  especially if west is played for one of the heart honors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now North could reopen with 3@D instead 3@S|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and was duly bid too|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N little insecure|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mmmakela: and E kicking himself not passing 1 @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: here it comes|pg||
nt|sybarra: but understandabel,  vul. and game looks possible |pg||
nt|mmmakela: S denied H supp?|pg||
nt|jujux: No|pg||
mb|4H|nt|boltonian2:  S could bid one more confidently with K10 and an A|pg||
nt|spooky: yes, has 5-5 shape..|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there are over-ruff possibilities declarer cannot simply draw trumps as he may be a trick short|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: presumably when north bid 2s he was looking to see if no trumps was the better spot?|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  well, I assume south had shown some @S support with this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I must say, I wonder where West got the double from |pg||
nt|bridge_one: The DBL by West is justified by sgl in @D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, yes, his bidding box...|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  hmm, not sure it is justification enough though|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  surely can't be surprised to see that @C void in dummy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i means sgl @D the reason to give a risk dbl|pg||
nt|boedhy: not easy to see what the best defence is for east..|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Trump switch is best now I think|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  He can see suits are not breaking and trumps will be the main source of tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy: @h ace small @d......but he cannt be sure partners @d was singleton|pg||
nt|mmmakela: saved by N|pg||
nt|jujux: 2@d is a relay|pg||
nt|xenya: the @C lead might not be easy to find though|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lead is the kill point|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: perhaps south was allowed to have only three hearts for example|pg||
nt|tomi2: think it is common to raise on 3 cards in the Netherlands, so playing in a Axxx - xxx fit while 3NT could be laydown or 4@S is not great|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes as i thought|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the lead wont hurt|pg||
nt|tomi2: i recently played some tourney with a Dutch player and was shocked how often I got raised on 3. then i stopped to bid bad 4 card suit and then we agreed on not raising on 3 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I am sure if I doubled as west South would make two overtricks |pg||
nt|sybarra: will take a lot of money to put the minor suit Q' s into ace of @S |pg||
nt|spooky: will be another -1..|pg||
nt|mmmakela: this could decide the title even|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: 7s will leave declarer well place to take the double heart hook|pg||
nt|jujux: 2@d is relay and 2NT shows 5@h in limit balanced hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes |pg||
nt|xenya: well done|pg||
nt|lestergold: exciting stuff|pg||
nt|lestergold: he led passive not to giver anything away and he has hit gold dust|pg||
pc|cT|nt|boedhy: @h queen good card....confirms singleton @d...|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|duschek: You can take more liberties as an opener because the opponents have not shown that major suit yet|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course we can see that with the ten of clubs dropping he would be able to|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: me too :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: yep hes gone for it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|boedhy: good defence cannt make it anymore I think|pg||
nt|jgc: Sorry my computer got so excited there it passed out for a few minutes!|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|sybarra: there is patience for yu |pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: superior odds to playing ace and another heart|pg||
pc|c7|nt|frankaus: @C cant run away|pg||
pc|h2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|sybarra: true|pg||
nt|lestergold: without hesitation and... 1 off is very good bridge today!!|pg||
nt|jujux: It seems they went  down in the other room too|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it cango off withou a club lead declarer has some guesswork on the hand|pg||
nt|jujux: On the same defense (according to specs)|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: now will make 5 one way or the other|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good timing by North|pg||
nt|boedhy: well i can understand very good defence by E/W here|pg||
nt|serhat: has to ruff with 9 to small h ..|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i did say it was not completely chopped liver or sorry foi gras|pg||
nt|serhat: he has to pitch a dia|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jgc: I was about to say Douglas Drury is spinning in his grave at this application|pg||
nt|jujux: Come on Quentin let's throw your @d :)|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|sybarra: here is what I have |pg||
nt|lestergold: if he throws dim he then has to decide what to do when a heart is led|pg||
nt|lestergold: flattie|pg||
pc|h7|nt|po-s: this time no overtricks but he surely plays it well|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and best defence by West|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, South will not reckon the spades are 3-3 - but he might have to assume it|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  ruff, and then spade to the A followed by a @H might not have been so good for S either|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now South has insurmountable entry problems, it would seem|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be @H from dummy the best line|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - unfortunately, Sothis in hand |pg||
nt|bridge_one: after K in West South is protected by @C return|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  yes, but a @C switch by E when in with the A@S might force dummy after that|pg||

mb|1S|nt|frankaus: 1NT P P P?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however was a interesting hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: s tricky hand here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I see |pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: of course he doesn´t have to worry when trumps 3-2 and club king onside|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a ligth 2@S by S|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was my point  |pg||
nt|serhat: it wasnt an easy hand but I believe dia pitch was obvious|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly interesting because good players would oftengo off asnd other good players would make not clear what the best line was at all|pg||
nt|serhat: are you saying dia pitch was wrong?|pg||
nt|lestergold: wel the match will not be decided on this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: more likely a coffee break|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: very favourable layout yes|pg||

nt|lestergold: however here is a not so favourable layout!|pg||
nt|tomi2: this looks as if there is a loser in every suit after a @C lead|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  4@H or 3N seems to be not too hard|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if in 6 play a dia to 10|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bridge_one: but not vuln me too open 2@s|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  yep, I would too|pg||

nt|sybarra: go to live ticker |pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: not easy the bid by East with 4@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: my team lost to a Gold Cup match to the Hacketts last weekend - they are tough to play against |pg||
nt|skollie: 2@S or 2NT by S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not sure Sehat!Rosenberg would be sure im not as good|pg||
nt|lestergold: well roland isnt in the team|pg||
nt|lestergold: it must be even less than  his 12.85%|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: any idea what NT range they play?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: 1NT is 11-13|pg||
nt|sybarra: that 'splains it |pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: now this is 14-16|pg||
nt|frankaus: beer hand :)|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H made in OR    seems there could be 4 losers|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably without J in @D would choise Dbl|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  no, there is a case for passing, as you know partner could not do something with short @Ss|pg||
nt|lestergold: my understatement for the day|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but they never got theirn club trick in the open room it must have gone on a spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 4/2 heart break and the spade layout could be awkawrd|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4/1 break i meant to type|pg||
nt|jgc: N might have competed further with 3@C|pg||
nt|skollie: 3NT makes|pg||
nt|skollie: and de Pagter will bid it|pg||
nt|spooky: yes @DQ dropping and @HAKJ rightsided|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: there was a revoke on the other table at brd. 14|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Vugraphzqs: i am very sorry dear spectators|pg||
nt|april7: @H lead ducking twice by E, but doesn< t help|pg||
nt|april7: but on @S lead @H switch very necessary|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1H = 4+ @C, 11+HCP|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  a good start for W too, maybe not all that simple|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no slam today onlty needed a 3/2 break and 2/2 finesses so perhaps it was about 155 and qualified for a roland slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: 15%|pg||
pc|d4|nt|spooky: Is 2N natural here? isn't it scrambling?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good bidding|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|projekt1: who will switch to @c?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: think so too|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: they dont have to lead clubs they can switch before trumps are dealt with |pg||
nt|lestergold: providdeclarer has to play the spades carefully unless opps are kind enuf to open them for him|pg||
nt|wechwech: more imps coming from France... Nicolas decided to pass because of the vuln and to not mislead his part |pg||
pc|s5|nt|duschek: Slightly awkward opening lead - the @DJx is unattractive, but there is no alternative|pg||
nt|mmmakela:  N sold to 2 @H in OR|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: south switch |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well without that lead this had every prospect of biting the dust|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: well, he might have @SKQJx |pg||
nt|mmmakela: so dbl partsc swing|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: even a dim now and then a club switch would beat it|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tomi2: south can now see the discard|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now it can be beaten onm a spade ruff so how was it made in the open room|pg||
nt|projekt1: and a @s-ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: it looks cold off|pg||
nt|tomi2: partner has showed 4 spades by playing @S4 and @S3 and could not cover the queen, so east has Kx|pg||
pc|c4|nt|boltonian2:  depends how he thinks is sat south :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|boltonian2:  *who|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ady: or when south takes heart trick   switch to either minor can beat it    mystery how it got through|pg||
pc|sT|nt|april7: this lead helps, otherwise W might have problems to develop 7 tricks|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mmmakela: or not|pg||
nt|xenya: W feeling some pressure on the run of @Ss|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c3|pg||
nt|frankaus: serving James Bag premium (a pilsener) from Tasmania ....... ahhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|frankaus: Boag|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: now spade ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: well defended|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d6|nt|april7: still not home|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  the @C break is handy, allowing S to lead the the J@S from dummy|pg||
nt|spooky: hmm NS not lucky here so far..|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|april7: @H from S|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  there was also a slight pause from Hacket, but that could just be screens, if they are in use|pg||
nt|sybarra: with @S shift before hrts, isn't this more precarious |pg||
pc|s3|pc|d9|nt|mmmakela: didn't notise spades 4-1|pg||
pc|c5|nt|skollie: +180 for NS|pg||
nt|spooky: @DQ drops...|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|april7: take ace and Ace of @C and @C|pg||
nt|xenya: can take all 13 now|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|mmmakela: so -2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|april7: double dummy ofcourse|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if they have screens, it could be a pause from East|pg||
nt|lestergold: but we must remember that west can draw a trump and then play a forcing card|pg||
nt|spooky: so you have 5@C 3@D 1@S shirley|pg||
pc|dT|nt|duschek: So if declarer guesses spades wrong, he is one off, and otherwise he is one off|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h2|pc|d7|pg||

mb|d|nt|tomi2: 2@C = hearts|pg||

nt|ady: can make up to 3@S|pg||
nt|tomi2: allowes you to get your hearts in even on weaker hands than that one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S=pass if you have spades, but I am prepared to go to at least 3H |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  yes and E quite happy with either|pg||
nt|skollie: and Karpov will try for 7|pg||
nt|skollie: 5@S-6@D-pass, i guess...|pg||

nt|spooky: don't expect that with a 6223 and 3Q's|pg||
nt|spooky: ooh sorry you meant 5@S at East..|pg||
nt|mmmakela: France can only lose if they bid 6 clubs or 7 hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c bid not outside then realms of possibility 7h i think not|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mmmakela: sterile 10 in heart contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: East has a big hand, can't he try for 7 just directly? 3Aces..|pg||
nt|brolucius: South may have doubled with only one four-card major, so North cannot be sure of a heart fit. Nevertheless, he is happy to bid 4@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: NS have a @D partscore|pg||
nt|duschek: Certainly - 12 crummy HCP and far too little offence for a 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3 @H was not sufficient by West ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: ell contract the same|pg||
mb|p|nt|projekt1: Board a Match  |pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3h should be limit for n/s as two black suit tricks can eb established before the diamod is set up for a discard|pg||
nt|tomi2: with clubs you bid 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West has to bid 3@h, as otherwise East will not know what major he has |pg||
nt|duschek: 3@H could be preemptive, but 2NT as a general invitation then|pg||
nt|jgc: This hand is good enough for an old-fashioned 22-24 2NT IMO|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an easy slam to find |pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: yes, i mean a bid inviting, and not a direct game|pg||

nt|lestergold: shouild go off spade lead followed by club switch|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H should be down 1   as long as e/w defend correctly|pg||
nt|lestergold: they have to do it or the long dim will take care of teh club|pg||
nt|lestergold: but should be obvious|pg||
nt|lestergold: well  this can be made as cards lie dim finesse will take care ofcl ub loser and only one spade and 2 heart losers |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  might make|pg||
nt|duschek: We don't know the style of their weak jumps shifts though|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  probably not, but never know|pg||
nt|duschek: In Denmark, the common style is roughly 4-8 HCP with a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  @D finesse for the @C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: we don't know, but they know for sure !|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has to take the dim finesse now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: seam finesse in @D the only chance -|pg||

nt|lestergold: but yes i think it is 1 off even so|pg||
nt|lestergold: gib is right|pg||
nt|lestergold: as long as north waits patienetly declarer must either lose 2 spades or three trump tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy: well south didnt think so looks normal tho maybe North has too much for 20/21 NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: the ten of spade lead would give it but he hasnt!!|pg||
nt|serhat: nice lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cannot see this making now|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|projekt1: nooooooo|pg||
nt|projekt1: normal team match|pg||
nt|sybarra: just looks like it, with score all 1's so far |pg||
nt|frankaus: this looks like coming home|pg||
nt|projekt1: also 3nt is to make -the lucky 2-2 in @c|pg||
nt|april7: very aggressive by W, but with @C 2-2 game is on, duck 1 @H and cash then ace and play on @C, if necessary overtake Q with ace|pg||

nt|sybarra: Watch many vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some don't,  Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless 3@H by East would be pass/correct.  |pg||
nt|boltonian2:  NS have done quite well here|pg||
nt|jujux: Tx all :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzqs: thanks markku for comments!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|skollie: he needs to guess @D as well...|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: on the bidding north has shown dims so they are an obvious danger|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, such a method is vulnerable to (for example) a 4@D raise by North |pg||
nt|lestergold: east could have doen with the 9 of hearts in his hand instead of the 7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ty all and by for now!|pg||
nt|Walddk7: This is the last board of the match. Many thanks again to Lukas Schenk, our very capable operator in Bonn. Well done!|pg||

nt|lestergold: thx all well done young France !! and bye for now|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Finally, our appreciation to the DBV (German Bridge Federation) for bringing this prestigious event to BBO vugraph. Josef Harsanyi, Matthias Schüller and Peter Eidt have been ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: instrumental in setting up a great show|pg||
pc|h8|nt|frankaus: Kirmse will find the winning line IMO|pg||
nt|ady: yes    if e/w signal correctly and give count   the club switch should come after cashing 1 spade|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 in @D great card|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The right decision by South facing a balanced 20-22 HCP, though North is a bit stronger than that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: it is of course a dreadful contract which n/s were effectively bounced into|pg||
nt|wechwech: was better to wait with A@d :s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: an impossible @S lead would have killed the contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse of scotland concealed|pg||
nt|serhat: he cd have  if he  ducked it..|pg||

nt|skollie: but he won't, i think|pg||
nt|spooky: hmm, @HK to take chance of @HQJstiff now?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: no diff|pg||

nt|mdgraham: @DQ isn't bad, either :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, but not sufficient :)|pg||
nt|boltonian2:  good play by south, not going to change anything on this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has no choice|pg||
nt|lestergold: but how 3 heart tricks 2 spades 2 dims thats 7 tricks|pg||
nt|jujux: Let's hope they ll offer us the same good bridge in Brasov for the Youth european championship :)|pg||
nt|jujux: Tx Roland|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: easier link   |pg||
