pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

mb|d|nt|lestergold: n/a 4h but e/w need to save in 5c|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|3C|nt|bobholl: but bidding it ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s makes|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: should bid it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: west must show his two pennwth worth with 4c|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bobholl: after bidding only 1 @S you have 2 tricks extra :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Info by the player: http://users.skynet.be/lbxdata/Open0809/index.htm|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: well maybe not if n/s are staying short of game mind u on that logic they would have defended 4cl for one off and an enormous score to e/w either way west should bid 4c|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a good game why arent they in it|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s3|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bobholl: dfficult to bid IMO|pg||
nt|lestergold: club  a dim and a heart to losee only going off when cards lie very badly|pg||
nt|daman: they aren't in it for reasons which escape me|pg||
nt|lestergold: and me too|pg||
nt|lestergold: they are vulnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: even at ps you need to bid ur cold vulnerable games|pg||
nt|lestergold: mps|pg||
nt|bobholl: in this auction N should bid it :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: For follow all turneys http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|lestergold: but at favourable do you agree that west must let east know that he can save in 5cl if necessay|pg||

nt|bobholl: but does 4@C mean that only ?|pg||
nt|daman: sure it does|pg||
nt|daman: on the auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4c competing doesnt promise much|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially as pard has opened and rebid the clubs at the three level on his own|pg||
nt|bobholl: but you "lift" them to 4:)|pg||
mc|10|nt|daman: especially if the tray comes back slowly|pg||
nt|daman: this will be a below average MP result|pg||
nt|lestergold: w can see here that mighht hyave happened but in my experiecne they bid 4 when they have it to make ithout ur help|pg||
nt|daman: my Mom would be in game|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|lestergold: because pard may have enuf defence to bat it an you cannot unilaterally bid 5cl with the west hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|lestergold: its just normal bridge in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: South has to be careful|pg||
nt|vugraphzpz: south is askingsome explanation|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|lestergold: south doesnt know just how much e/w have to spare|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: but it looks like that these are all players who do not believe that bridge is about bidding|pg||

nt|lestergold: selling out to a 2 level part score is not good mp tactics especially at favourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|bobholl: in pairs playing has amuch greater role than in imps|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: amongst experts its a card players game whereas imps is the bidders game|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|hA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|daman: selling out was best on this hand|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
mc|10|nt|bobholl: but continuing @C wasn't :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: selling out was best in practice but that doesnt change theory|pg||
nt|vugraphzpz: end of the round|pg||
nt|lestergold: south should have doubled they would have ended defending 3h ok it would have m,ade no difference|pg||
nt|lestergold: but next time it might|pg||
nt|lestergold: mps is a tight game where you have to turn the screw to the maximum|pg||
nt|lestergold: no easy rides for opps|pg||
nt|daman: on this hand    partner has passed your opening....the opps have found their fit    the only real chance for you is in 2@S if you don't want to sell out     hoping partner has 3 or ...|pg||
nt|daman: 4 @Ss plus shape is aiming for a very small target   ergo, pass has to be right|pg||
nt|bobholl: if the Q of @H would have been in @S for example than X is obligatory in pairs :)|pg||
nt|daman: then he could have x'd 1 @H|pg||
nt|kgr: NS play obvious switch. I guess small @c was encouraging and denying @sK or @sA. Made it more difficult to see if @c continuation was right|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i would have backed in with a double in the passout seat- little to lose you are at favoutrbl vulnerability they have to double u and take u two off to profit|pg||
nt|lestergold: not usually that easy|pg||
pg||

nt|rodal f: They obvious are playing 12 - 14 NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: but how manhy tricks will north make?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not enough is my guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: -2 is deadly as usual :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i wouldnt play weak no trump with a gun to my head|pg||
nt|daman: kiss of death at MPs|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||

pc|sT|nt|lestergold: i know that a few top pairs play it successfully|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|daman: or   the @S 10|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobholl: 3 @D 4@D|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lestergold: west must start to realise he has a useful hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: :( no 4@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh no! this is dreadful bidding|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will say that at pair it's a ok spot.|pg||

nt|lestergold: its a 75 percent ish contract it needs either the ace hts or k dims favourabkly placed|pg||
nt|bobholl: somewhat less for 4-1 @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: in a strong field you have to bid ur games and slams even at mps because the others will|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|c5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|daman: West detected a misfit (sorta) and made the logical bid|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|lestergold: east must make another try he cannot expect west to envisage such a rick crusher of a hand|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||

nt|vugraphzpz: most of the best belgian pair are here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bobholl: field is the best available in belgium |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: in which case i would be surprised if 3n on last hand earns more than 30 percent or so|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|daman: we'll see the result later|pg||
nt|lestergold: given 6dims and 6n can be thrown against th wall|pg||

nt|bobholl: unlucky @S division :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: if partner has 4 cards in one of my suits i will reckon that 6 is odds on with the east hand  especially when partner responded to my opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpz: Kurgan is in the tank|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: mps is about probabilioty/ frequency how can you not think that east's hand will notm probably produce a slam on the auction|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzpz: kurgan was thinking to a grand slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: well here n/s hav bid a very poor six spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have a small shance. AKX@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: first finesse @C to get rid off @D|pg||
nt|rodal f: C finess comes later. @H first|pg||
nt|lestergold: it needs club finesse spadebehaviour and even then work to be done to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: less than 50% not a good proposition especially at mps|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless u are desperate |pg||

nt|rodal f: So u mean poor Wald again or EW?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the e/w cardas are enormous but rkc at some point should prevent them form bidding slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: doyou weant tio be in a slam needing a finesse at mps?|pg||
nt|lestergold: depends where u are lying?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: of course the lack of possesion ofthe ten of spades makes this less than 50 percent|pg||
