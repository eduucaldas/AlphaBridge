nt|lestergold: an initing hand only|pg||
nt|lestergold: inviting|pg||
nt|lestergold: limit raise|pg||
nt|lestergold: thatw as all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|kipp: if 2NT can both contain this type of hand, and also normal invitational+ hands with 4-card support, it's very difficult to know how to evaluate your cards as opener. As for now, he ...|pg||
nt|kipp: already had shown inv+ with support, so the 4@S bid could hardly be right|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: absolutely!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: a right old misfit here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: someone will get too high i suspect|pg||
nt|lestergold: a hand to defend rather than declare|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kipp: difference in style on the two tables here|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: most players open north hand @H|pg||
nt|kipp: on a 10-count without aces?|pg||
nt|haans: yepp (dont ask me why)))|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: three rounds of trumps will leave declarer a trick short of his contract i think|pg||
nt|liujing: not my style|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont open north hanbd|pg||
nt|liujing: that indicates I'm no longer a youth:(|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a nine count without aces im not counting the jack of spades|pg||
nt|kipp: I might consider opening it playing a strong @C system with 9-15 openings, but 1st seat in a natural system I don't consider that an opening|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course it isnt|pg||
nt|haans: opening bids get lighter and lighter (i we do not open we may miss game :))))))))|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kipp: on the other hand, I'd be delighted to open 2@H if I were playing a system with 5-card 2M openings|pg||
nt|liujing: weak 2@H is closer|pg||
nt|lestergold: time to draw trumps i think|pg||
nt|haans: me2 :)|pg||

pc|dT|nt|kipp: first blood to top bridge, probably 9 imps|pg||
nt|kipp: brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever result here a fair gain for e/w as they avoided getting out of depth unlike their opps in the closed room|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|sJ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: 6 imps if this goes 1 0ff|pg||
nt|lestergold: and i think i counted 7 tricks on this defence|pg||
nt|liujing: not 8?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 dims thats 4 the kc , ks and ace hts thats 7 where is 8th?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|liujing: ruff with @DQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|d9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: ur analysis may have been deeper thanmine|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: but surely defenc will have 6 ticks in the process|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s4|pc|c3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he could have cashed 7 tricks for 1 off 2off reduces gain to a mere 5 imps|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: west has signed off but the little encouragement he gave to partner was enuf to propel him onwards|pg||

nt|lestergold: not  a bad 6 actually|pg||
nt|lestergold: cold played by south whenever there is no club lead ot club k onside|pg||
nt|chthonic: Getting to six would be a bit much, but it is a swing opportunity|pg||
nt|lestergold: well trhey had a strong 9 card fiut 29 combinde d points and excellent controls not that far fetched|pg||
nt|star6ija: fine, we will try to make something , thanks a lot |pg||
nt|col3435: there may be people around, it's not as busy with vugraphs as it was earlier|pg||
nt|star6ija: 9 IMPs sry|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@d from Nort's hand|pg||
nt|tomi2: 400 is always a good start into a teams tournament|pg||
nt|santyclz: On the nose.  |pg||
nt|april7: EW can make 4@S finding the Q of @S. If E opens 2@S S will bid 3@D and W 3@S and S wil be outbid|pg||
nt|april7: If E passes it might go 1@D 2@C - 2@S  and ?|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S depends on lead from S.in 3@S E will have to give up a @D playing from dummy|pg||
mb|1C|nt|april7: do we have an intermission?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this is "Danish"  as it is a movement in teams where  1 plays  2 |pg||
nt|vugraphb1: bad connection, sry all|pg||
nt|tomi2: but why do they play so early in the morning. Is Bulgaria in the same time zone as middle europe?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No, 1 hour ahead|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 9:41 in Sofia|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, that is a little bit better :)|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: yes, 9.41 is here|pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@S for EW looks like a struggle here if NS get the Hearts going soon enough|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|lestergold: well a bit of a misfit hand here|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s have a normal spade part score|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@h can not be made even if W misses @C lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@s is a good sacrifice even against game|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like 4@s has some play here and things are sitting pretty well for it.|pg||
nt|april7: 1 point missing|pg||
nt|ignatov_bg: hi all|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: but hard to  reach!|pg||
nt|chthonic: That overcall may have a negative result, since NS would surely be playing spades absent the bid|pg||
nt|Walddk5: But it's still in the middle of the night as far as I'm concerned|pg||
nt|tomi2: am no big fan of transfer overcalls after strong club|pg||
nt|Walddk5: There should be a law against playing at this hour|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: a reopening double would have been interesting and pehaps a rather better bid|pg||
nt|star6ija: dokolkoto vijdam njamame komentatori|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6te opitam da buda polezen za analizite|pg||
nt|tomi2: you give your opponents a pass, a double, a cuebid and passing and later bidding/cuebidding|pg||
nt|april7: now E might go to 4@S by transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: nice job from EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: yes|pg||

nt|santyclz: Presumably a smolen variant, showing a game force with 4@h and 5@s.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chthonic: This board will not create a swing of any consequence.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: 2h is that natural?|pg||
nt|chthonic: oops.  A transfer misinterpreted.???|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm told "presumably" was an underbid.|pg||

pc|d5|nt|col3435: oh|pg||
nt|col3435: it does help that it's North's lead :)|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|s3|nt|chthonic: small|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s by north could hardly be misinterpreted|pg||
nt|chthonic: This is not a good start for north south|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is not an overtstament Craig|pg||
nt|oliverc: yup|pg||
nt|april7: but W will have to play the @S beeing 2-2|pg||

nt|fifee: I don't know how you can avoid 2 losers but its only 6am here :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chthonic: Sure, not enough defense... |pg||
nt|lestergold: ah should show two suiter immediately|pg||
nt|lestergold: haqppened to have hit the right suit|pg||
nt|chthonic: And I am strong for sound openers... But this one I would make an exception for.|pg||
nt|charles_l: X might get NS in trouble...|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: wlc, Veysel|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: 120?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|col3435: well|pg||
nt|star6ija: 11 is double dummy of course|pg||
nt|tomi2: but I don't know why E did not enter the bidding?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I am surprised that East passed over an 11-14 1NT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: now this way north knows|pg||
nt|lestergold: his hand is not pullinmg a lot of defensive weight|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you 5c is off|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3d is an atrocious bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: and facing an passed opp! he can not run in that much of trouble|pg||
nt|tweety1: Weak Free Bids are still very common in Bulgaria.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|star6ija: now @DAce @d ruff|pg||
nt|star6ija: @C to the King @druff|pg||
nt|oliverc: No, you're right, always 2 losers|pg||
nt|april7: 2@H a dangerous bid by S,|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: his pardners bid over the double is clearly weak|pg||
nt|star6ija: izvinjavam se na vsi4ki bulgari, no 6te smenja malko ezika za6toto imame dosta gosti|pg||
nt|fifee: phew :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: Only on my first coffee here :)|pg||
nt|fifee: having a spot of tea ;)|pg||
nt|othered1: slam is about good enough, if you can find it.  But 4@S may have gotten in the way|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like it |pg||
nt|lestergold: makes on any defence other than spade followed by heart switch assuming declarer picks the club|pg||
nt|charles_l: i think X was not unreasonable, but 3@d is|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well called charles|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: on best defence|pg||
nt|chthonic: It would -- or will -- be interesting to see the effect on EW of an opening bid.  Whether there is sufficient competition to bid 5C|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to sit tight with this misfitting evenly divided hand ifpard cant bid again then must defnd 2s|pg||
nt|tomi2: he preferes to be endplayed in the opening lead maybe :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: -800|pg||
pc|c6|nt|star6ija: @c to the Queen @s to the Ace and another @s for throw-in|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lets see if they can max the defense for 800|pg||
nt|charles_l: ruff with stiff trump is a good start :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: then AK spades, spade overruff and trumps|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|charles_l: still on road to 800s-ville though|pg||
nt|charles_l: duck a club seems a good ploy?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: way too simple for NS|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: now north judged wisely or not to pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially at unfavourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|star6ija: Most probably Danailov will try to cash 3 @h now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|col3435: west would love partner to double of course, but that seems a lot to hope for|pg||
nt|lestergold: For benefit of specs i do not know any of these players|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps I should|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|charles_l: trump needed from E now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: but i am commentating on the bridge as i find it played|pg||
nt|tomi2: West should duck this|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|tomi2: but I guess the result here will not change the score on the board since I expect other room will score -600 or -630|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c7|nt|lestergold: south's five spade bid was incorrect- he had no reason to contradict his partner's suggestion that they defend|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: had he showed his weak two suiter then he would have not placed himself in this position partner would kbnow exactly what he had|pg||
pc|c2|nt|charles_l: but he is still hoping for his @H ruff|pg||
nt|charles_l: @s10=s/p for @h|pg||
nt|charles_l: discard @hJ best|pg||
pc|d4|nt|col3435: so perhaps it would have been advisable to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|fifee: The Bulgarians have some great players. Do we have a website for this event?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3 boards in 40 minutes is going for the roland slow list|pg||
nt|charles_l: maybe the open room will overtake us, then we get some comparisons|pg||
pc|c8|nt|col3435: partner doesn't have much but it still makes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Murat Molva|pg||
nt|star6ija: the generator made very interesting boards for the final rounds|pg||
nt|april7: safety play by E |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|MolvaM: re hi everyone|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|lestergold: west is lucky in that some of north's trumps will be mangled in the cross fire|pg||
nt|charles_l: but 4 undertricks have been mysteriously turned into 2.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: order all four of them double espresso coffees|pg||
nt|charles_l: order them a TD to stand over their shoulders|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|tweety1: hi|pg||
nt|ignatov_bg: both pairs using precision club|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|sybarra: 3 nt for n/s |pg||
nt|tweety1: wow|pg||
nt|tweety1: N opened|pg||

mb|p|nt|chthonic: Can NS find 4S after a strong NT opening?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|chthonic: Nope|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Jan Arne Heimdal|pg||
nt|jaheim: Good morning all|pg||
nt|santyclz: While I'm a big believer in showing support early, in this case n had so much to describe 3@c somewhat preempted the auction.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently although nt sort of fits also|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Have to play diamonds correctly to do it, I think|pg||

nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and good morning to Murat Molva|pg||
nt|tomi2: West had the options of playing a spade through and giving a heart ruff after his partner underlead his @C ace. I think E should signal his intent with the card he plays. Leading a ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: low coub = heart ruff and a high one, as the 5 was imo, ="play a spade first"|pg||
nt|charles_l: when 2 suits are unbid, cue SHOWS a stop.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: overboard I wonder?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chthonic: Could have problems on a club lead...?  |pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi everyone :) good morning|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sybarra: is there a "right" way to play that @D holding |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure |pg||
nt|chthonic: Can they find first nine tricks?.... Probably|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tomi2: as a spec points out, this looks like a gazilli auction|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: 3n more chance than 4s because of the 4333 mirror|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: however i can see 3 spades 3 hearts a club and a dim where is the ninth coming from?|pg||
nt|tomi2: allowes them to stay in partscore with that non fitting hands, but not in 2@D, since that would show "any 8+ hand"|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|MolvaM: friendly distribution but declarer has to manage the spade suit|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: mind you if they get it right its only4 off for 400|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 0.04 start|pg||
nt|april7: now 2@C is game forc. but not in hand  2|pg||
nt|april7:  1|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: 2 @C over 1@H/@S is GF /ONLY if rebid @Cs = invitation with 6+ @C/|pg||
pc|s4|nt|star6ija: this is mistake from N|pg||
nt|lestergold: and north /south may well develop 2 long hearts along with the spade and the 2 clubs in the rqce in any case|pg||
nt|star6ija: this ruff with the @D Jack looks very starnge|pg||
nt|oliverc: no fairytale here, then|pg||
pc|s6|nt|charles_l: nicely bid by NS|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
nt|chthonic: I think north had to play the heart Q |pg||

pc|cQ|nt|chthonic: should.... for down thee, plus 300.. Bu|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chthonic: no buts.... there it is|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|MolvaM: on the way to crosruff|pg||

nt|chthonic: That last hand was worthy of further study.|pg||

nt|lestergold: hm no ricj=hes for either side here|pg||
nt|col3435: this looks dull, maybe even a passout ... do they pass out hands around here?|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2C!|nt|chthonic: Lots of action on board 2.... East preempted 3C, and NS are in 4S X..... so the 3H "disaster" is going to be a pickup....|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s may well bid to game on their combined 25 points buty i cant see anything making|pg||
nt|lestergold: plenty of swingy hands|pg||
nt|MolvaM: quiet boards.  good for the leading teams|pg||
nt|othered1: A little short on high card points, but pointcount doesn't evaluate playing hands like east's very well|pg||

pc|sA|nt|sybarra: interesting 2 @C |pg||
nt|chthonic: I don't like that bid.  Let them get to 3NT and cash five tricks...|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard leads wrong and you are never in |pg||
nt|sybarra: and they cash 7 or 8 minor |pg||
nt|chthonic: Good point..... |pg||
nt|col3435: ah, good, East has found something in his cards|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer has to locate the @sJ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but will probably make even if he cant|pg||
nt|moen: yes|pg||
nt|santyclz: One of the under appreciated benefits of a strong @c system is the ability to make a reverse on a hand like this.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: kq doubleton lub not pulling its full weight|pg||
nt|star6ija: EW are not original partners, but probably Nanev assumed that Ivanchev had @Ds|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chthonic: No games make NS on this one. |pg||
nt|lestergold: but they aqre surely headed for 3N now|pg||
nt|chthonic: NS might get too high.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n is off on any half sensible defence|pg||
nt|april7: making 2,3 or 4 depending on @C play and @S finesse, but will not risk @C finesse in only 2@S but in 4 E had to|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|santyclz: West's red honors have become golden.|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes.  It lets you get your suits into the auction in length order.  But there are other gadgets for hands like that (like a nonforcing jump reverse I used to play)|pg||
nt|othered1: But I'd reverse this hand in standard as well.  Sound 4-loser, pure hand can be bid up a bit.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ignatov_bg: 2NT = 6+@D max|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he bid the suit twice, should be void really|pg||
pc|cA|nt|col3435: mind you, it looks like he'll regret it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fifee: easier if declarer gets the @D lead and ruff|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: only a dim part score and i cant see them resting in one|pg||
nt|lestergold: will i think need help from defence to make thisone- wit the diamonds behaving badly and the club k waste paper i can see only 6 tricks and that is only becfause of the lucky heart ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: position|pg||
nt|star6ija: I am sure that he plays this convention with his original partner|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chthonic: Especially if I were on lead...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: Looks like there was some system confusion here.  4@D, nonforcing, seems misguided|pg||
nt|charles_l: maybe 1@d=0+@d, and 3@d showed extra length? ;)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|santyclz: All for naught.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now the club guess|pg||
nt|santyclz: West doesn't seem to have appreciated the value of his red honors opposite a 5/6+.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chthonic: West, that is|pg||
nt|chthonic: Have to lose three spades and a club in this contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s might have a play if the spades were 3/3 but as it is 4 top losers|pg||
nt|MolvaM: interesting 2nt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but karakolev didnt have many good alternative bids I guess|pg||
nt|jaheim: y  needs to play j of@D now|pg||
nt|jaheim: but almost impossible|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the 2nt bid might make that difficult now for ivanchev|pg||
nt|jaheim: right|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if west thought 3@D forced to game (a style some play, with 2N starting less good hands)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: now i claim|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: and when are the defence going to find a club switch? the pips are such that theycan cash 5 clubs without pausing for breath|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|MolvaM: nanev assumed karakolev had the 4th diamond|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|1S!|nt|chthonic: So, there was no swing on board 1, where NS could make slam on favorable card placement, but on the second board a problem arose in both rooms NS.  The worse of the two disasters ...|pg||
nt|chthonic: occurred in the other room after a preempt.  It looked like a misunderstanding in this room would have been the problem, but it paled in comparison.  |pg||
nt|lestergold: 2slooks limit for n/s but e/w can probably make 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2@h anyone?|pg||
nt|ritong: they might play different system according to the vulnerability|pg||
nt|fabsayc: par seems to be 7D|pg||

nt|MolvaM: cards lie well for 3@h also|pg||
nt|fifee: headed to 3NT, cards lying favorably this time :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tomi2: yes, playing 11-13 NT is more effective non vuln|pg||
nt|charles_l: 6@c(E) makes on @d lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Oh, I misread the auction|pg||
nt|ritong: and here, also, balancing with a double holding @s KJ makes few sense, since pard can hardly have a penalty doiouble for @ss|pg||
mb|3S|nt|MolvaM: 2@h opening might have stopped NS to find their game|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Dimitar Kapitanski|pg||
nt|othered1: There are many ways to handle west's hand -- subject to your agreements.  Stayman, bailing out in 2M, is one, if available as here.|pg||
nt|othered1: Some play 2@S invitational on this auction, but EW apparantly don't, since west's hand is really pushy for an invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: east vulnerable this isbonkers|pg||

nt|star6ija: Valerie Westheimer|pg||
pc|cA|nt|MolvaM: yes I agree. but for result merchants, 2@h is a good opening today :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now we are coming to the bids that actually require thought, and naturally all done quickly|pg||

nt|lestergold: 5s will not be so cheap especially if declarwer plays clubs the wrong way|pg||
nt|tomi2: playing 2 systems dependingon vulnerability is one basic idea in one of Krzystof Martns' books|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: well as i fearesd but this lead has let it thru|pg||

pc|s3|nt|kapitanski: they play very  well there|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: it is certainly more comfortable to play big @c white vs red|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|chthonic: 4S would have been a level lower and a better result....|pg||
nt|lestergold: north correctly cashes dim not touching clubs|pg||
nt|kapitanski: stanislav nedkov  is like a  "stanned" on  BBO|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: why no obvious spade lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: acostly error|pg||
nt|ritong: as opponents look at it twice before overcalling|pg||

nt|lestergold: enjoy ur qd and what now brown cow?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|oliverc: lol|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: when you know that a long dim suit is likely to be run you need to develop your 5 tricks quickly- clubs was not a good prospect|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: whereas spades was an excellent prospect|pg||
nt|fifee: Tenev is Tenyu on BBO, ty hedy|pg||

nt|kapitanski: on  good  pairs|pg||
pc|h4|nt|col3435: well, this is just a horrible layout and you struggle to make anything|pg||

nt|chthonic: Just for the record..... On board 3, when I would have opened 1S on 6511, they DID open 1S in the other room and are playing an uncontested 4S, undoubled., down 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: but this was absurd west should have bid his hand to begin with|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting north opened a dim in open room takeout double so e/w played inm their making pat score|pg||
nt|lestergold: but no great damage done on the hand|pg||
nt|jaheim: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: but on a prvious deal, we saw that rumen does not consider things under this angle|pg||
nt|kapitanski: very strong team qualification  for national team in  Sofia..|pg||
nt|santyclz: Pity n didn't have a @h or @c left, we'd have seen a smother play on defense.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bizarre, did he ask how hearts split or something|pg||
nt|charles_l: i would|pg||
mb|1S|nt|MolvaM: good score from the open room for EW|pg||
nt|april7: I know, this is what kept us alive for so many thousands of years|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Well, they did not bid 2S on that other hand.. and DOUBLED the 3NT contract, receiving a SPADE !! lead|pg||
nt|chthonic: Nice|pg||
nt|lestergold: should have made a raise showing defensive values so that east would know not to push to the five level|pg||
nt|chthonic: Al Roth would turn over in his grave... to open that 1S.|pg||
nt|lestergold: an unassuming cue bid raise with his 12 count for example|pg||
nt|MolvaM: open room didnt find the S hand worth opening|pg||
nt|ritong: on board 2, he overcalled for the single reason that he held 13 cards|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes but its kind of strange to me that they on't let the team play that was so well in last years Europeans|pg||
nt|kapitanski: ilko Bonev was  champion  in Bulgaria  in 1985  like  said  my friend  Marinchev|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: this bidding must surely be wrong or for the next hand more likely??|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|chthonic: But it has/had preemptive value|pg||
nt|lestergold: ??|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it is important to play 3NT from east but declarer still has 8 tricks unless south leads a heart|pg||
nt|tomi2: Bulgaria finished 4th as far as I remember and so qualified for the Bermuda Bowl this year in Brazil|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: And on board 4, where 1NT was set three vulnerable tricks, North in the other room overcalled 2C... P P P.|pg||
nt|chthonic: So there will be another swing.|pg||
nt|lestergold: again west does not want to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it ahappens 4h should not make on best defence|pg||
nt|chthonic: That one adverse to our NS team|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west has a clear cut bid of 3h|pg||
nt|chthonic: No... adverse to our EW team.  Sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: now north opens and east cant bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: In Germany teams who achieve such qualification are always allowed to play the event they qualified for|pg||
nt|santyclz: If any hand deserved upgrading for spots, west's certainly qualifies.|pg||
nt|othered1: Not easy to  find @S at a low level here|pg||

pc|s3|nt|charles_l: easy 8 tricks when 1dK is onside|pg||
pc|s6|nt|MolvaM: 3@d nice spot|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kapitanski: Bonev in  around 48 years old   Batov  38-39  like  others 2  players|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'd rate w's hand at about 17.5 points, wonder what k&r say?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|MolvaM: declarer will duck a heart to see if something good happens.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: still has to find the @cq|pg||
nt|tomi2: so since the players are always improving their score, there have been no trials for 6 years now. Only from time to time a pair or one player has been replaced.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|MolvaM: but finally resort to the @HK finesse|pg||
nt|jaheim: y   3 imps to ns|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|MolvaM: aggressive lead|pg||
nt|moen: well that was a friendly lead|pg||
nt|ritong: are you aware about rumen/kalin system, dimi? we are not sure about the reasons they open 1@c or 1@d|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|charles_l: lots of other chances too|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would call it unfair, if our national team, who played that well last year, would have to play trials and then maybe loses n a bad day and may not play Bermuda Bowl|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Have a easy one for 660 and plat. NEXT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or 12?|pg||
nt|othered1: Even playing a big @C system, some pairs don't upgrade.  There are some old Hamman-Wolff hands where a light Blue Club opening got them too high.|pg||

nt|moen: yes|pg||
nt|MolvaM: velichkov could not time the 4@h contrat at the other room and went down at board4 in the open room|pg||

pc|s3|pc|h4|pc|sA|pg||

nt|sybarra: thx as always to our wonderful operator |pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course,  thx to Craig Hemphill my co commentator |pg||
nt|chthonic: I nominate board 4 as the hand of this segment.  A difficult but makeable 3NT contract, down two in one room, three in the other, vulnerable.  |pg||
nt|chthonic: Thanks, Shirley, a pleasure.|pg||
nt|sybarra: its certainly an interesting "puzzle" type hand |pg||
nt|chthonic: No swing on board 7, as expected|pg||
nt|lestergold: im wrong 4h is always cold|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s and a club only to lose|pg||
nt|chthonic: On this, our last board,  8, EW bid and made 4S in the other room.|pg||
nt|lestergold: in any case gross underbidding again|pg||

nt|MolvaM: 4@s making is a super score|pg||
nt|MolvaM: with this layout|pg||
nt|jaheim: but they made 4 sp in the other romm?|pg||
nt|fifee: that is remarkable|pg||
nt|oliverc: That will potentially put a bit of a dent in the V-IVI lead|pg||
nt|fifee: swing for the T-RSB team there|pg||

nt|star6ija: Varna|pg||
nt|col3435: and don't forget there are two "bonus" rounds coming up that weren't origianlly advertised in the schedule|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south led a heart in spite of the 1@h opening|pg||
nt|chessmaste: North should overcall now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: slam makes but I dont think they will bid it|pg||
nt|othered1: You can't use KR only when it upgrades.  Or you can, but your evaluations will be inconsistent|pg||
nt|april7: EW might end up in a 4@S contract or 3NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|tomi2: OR room even made 12 tricks missing 3 acres in that hand where E passed all the time, so first huge swing now for N/S, "A-SRR"|pg||
nt|ritong: or 1NT, for that matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: as i guessed ahead of yourself|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chthonic: It played from the other side  -- south -- in the other room and on a heart lead, only going up ace from dummy retains the tempo.... very tough, indeed.|pg||
nt|fifee: without a @C lead or switch NS can make 4@H|pg||
nt|fifee: and EW can make 4@S|pg||
nt|kapitanski: in Bulgaria  not so many  players but  both of them are  very  strong...and  not  be  suprice  here  to wiin  any  team|pg||
nt|santyclz: Pretty close to a 50% slam here.|pg||
nt|charles_l: 1@c 16+ 1@d 0-7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like change the club 2 and 6 it makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|chthonic: Seems that the heart suit is the key.|pg||
nt|chthonic: OK, this hand...|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I dont like a RDBL with a good fit for pd|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Here's another strong 2-suiter in east.  Again only 14 HCP, but . . . |pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: 4@S should be off|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: 4s here is nopt incidentally that great acontract it makes because the spades behave and the hearts are 3/3|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: last board on this tournament|pg||
nt|oliverc: @D ruff|pg||
nt|fifee: with the @D ruff |pg||
nt|oliverc: but solid if NS don't find it immediately|pg||
nt|othered1: Here 3@S has to be a long suit.  Had north not bid, @S might have been looking for help|pg||
nt|santyclz: I can't use k&r at all, I get a "you do not have permission..." when I try,|pg||
nt|santyclz: W is surely worth 4@d regardless.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: lets hear the brakes screech soon |pg||
pc|c4|nt|MolvaM: Aj9873 is a nice overcall I think at this vul|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@s preempt willbe costly|pg||
nt|charles_l: E:"your @cs weren't strong enough|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: ty all, see you soon|pg||
nt|col3435: lots of awkward part-score hands in this round|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: after about 10 min.|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart lead creates the 8th trick|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Best to have a six card suit at the two level|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but reasonable after ivanchev bid 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: ty all|pg||
pc|s5|nt|col3435: seems that everything goes off at the moment|pg||
nt|ritong: bulgarian style, i like it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: or they blast it being behind |pg||
nt|MolvaM: there goes the diamond trick|pg||
nt|chessmaste: That lead will not paralyse declarer|pg||
nt|pelu: I agree, Mark, are u getting old? :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it seems the board will be flat now|pg||
nt|charles_l: 4@s is down on @h lead, so 5@s is down even more|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chthonic: It makes, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|chthonic: Sure.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Not yet!|pg||

nt|april7: unfortunately not|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|ritong: first bid game, then try to make it  that is their idea about game tries, and i agree fully:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chthonic: Lose spade, heart, club|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east knows that if he doesnt bid then his partner will never be in anything|pg||
nt|oliverc: next :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tomi2: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure -- @Sxxxx isn't a plus, unless east has 5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|MolvaM: it seems both Nort's had poor memories of overcalling with such hands|pg||
nt|april7: no entry for the 4th @S, so E might go down, ut has the 9th trick in @H|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphb1: bye|pg||
pc|h7|nt|MolvaM: now Nanev knows that the opps have a slam.  could teammates have bid that?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphb1: see you soon|pg||
nt|lestergold: the nonth could come from spades but declarer will probably try the clubs|pg||
nt|april7: but will go down if S switchs to @C after K of @D|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: Popov is thinking|pg||
nt|april7: playing the J but still has time after @H tricks, now even possible 3down|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chthonic: Assuring a diamond ruff and a push.|pg||
nt|lestergold: lucky here they flatten the board playing in the same dodgy spade game|pg||
nt|kapitanski: yes they  (rumen-kalin)  play  their  sistem....1@c  weak NT or  strong (GF)hand|pg||
nt|ritong: oki  ty|pg||
nt|ritong: so 1@d is anything which does not fit with that|pg||
nt|kapitanski: nasko-toni play  their  precision  variant.|pg||
nt|oliverc: Why is Joey Silver never here when you need him?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|othered1: On previous hand, KR evaluates west's 15 count as 17.65|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|chthonic: when the spade ten falls|pg||
nt|lestergold: i predict this will go off|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h3|nt|charles_l: they are playing 6@c in 5@c, so 13imps to NS i imagine|pg||
nt|april7: E should have taken ace of @H first trick and religh on ace of @C with S|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|sybarra: on his way |pg||
nt|chthonic: no uppercuts lying around loose|pg||
nt|lestergold: no i stand corrected|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can t get at their spade trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: what about spade switch now and then heart back|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: Ivanchev is thinking|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think only card to beat this contract is Js|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: 8 spads not good enuf|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok thanks everyone :)|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: see you after 5-10 min.|pg||
nt|fifee: he has lots of clones :)|pg||
nt|charles_l: not restricted choice in @s, surely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could not handle 3-1 spades, dont think restricted choice should be applied|pg||
nt|charles_l: yes i think so too|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d7|nt|lestergold: the spades will be blocked now|pg||
nt|oliverc: lol|pg||
nt|april7: rely|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well declarer has to take ace of spades but he didnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: so contract now off on heart return|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chthonic: Just has to guess hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: impossible for declarer to read that situation so east got away with a loose card- the J was a killer against all plays by north|pg||
pc|s3|nt|MolvaM: @h2 asked for a heart return probably|pg||
nt|april7: cash ace of @H and endplay N with 4th @S|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chthonic: except imaginary ones|pg||
nt|lestergold: yeh but there was also a question of the third dim- if a trump is drawn it cant be ruffed in dummy and needs a long heart for a discard|pg||
nt|lestergold: needing hearts 3/3|pg||
nt|tweety1: seems he will endplay|pg||

nt|april7: Q of @S|pg||

nt|santyclz: Partner, you never return my leads!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|oliverc: If 1@S was natural (and not alerted, apparently) it does seem curious, and 3@S|pg||

nt|april7: 1 trickpresent|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|santyclz: Lots of tricks, but both black suits are blocked.|pg||
nt|othered1: with the @S coming down (but declarer doesn't know it) there is no way to stop this.  In fact, double-dummy, n orth must now cash.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: did the director load his gun|pg||

mb|p|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: this is actually a 20/20 hand but e/w s 20 is a lot bigger than n/s 's 20!|pg||

pc|c2|nt|kipp: I have a very strong opinion against bidding jacoby (which should show 4-card support) with only 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do n ot think at imps that east had a clear bid of 4s- should have gone for the certain money here alto i have some sympathy 300 is a poor score aghainst 620 if 620 is available|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: but opposite a minimum opener east'shand is simply a whisker short of game certaintyeffectively an 11 count with three low spades|pg||

mc|8|nt|lestergold: when vulnerabl;e yu musnt allow non vul opps to bounce you into a dodgy game|pg||
nt|liujing: if 2NT shows limited+, west could consider X 4@H with defensive power|pg||
nt|lestergold: his hand was more defensive than offensive basically|pg||
nt|lestergold: no ruffing values minimal trumps wasted j hearts|pg||

nt|santyclz: I will accept bets on where this will end up.|pg||
nt|tweety1: a flat 3nt by NS|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: In a natural system, I might not get @S into the auction very quickly. (Open 1@C and rebid 2N shows the hand well)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|santyclz: We have one bet on 6@s.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|april7: an interesting pening by W vuln.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: remember they play strong @c|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: so this auction is not as strong as it is playing natural|pg||
nt|othered1: I woiuldn't bet against 6@S either, espacially was west hasn't taken more room away|pg||
