nt|sybarra: thx as always to our wonderful operator |pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course,  thx to Craig Hemphill my co commentator |pg||
nt|chthonic: I nominate board 4 as the hand of this segment.  A difficult but makeable 3NT contract, down two in one room, three in the other, vulnerable.  |pg||
nt|chthonic: Thanks, Shirley, a pleasure.|pg||
nt|sybarra: its certainly an interesting "puzzle" type hand |pg||
nt|chthonic: No swing on board 7, as expected|pg||
nt|lestergold: im wrong 4h is always cold|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s and a club only to lose|pg||
nt|chthonic: On this, our last board,  8, EW bid and made 4S in the other room.|pg||
nt|lestergold: in any case gross underbidding again|pg||
nt|star6ija: povikaha sadijata|pg||
nt|star6ija: klasirane 6te imate sled 20-ina minuti, kum momenta ima samo teku6to, no krygyt vse o6te ne e doigran|pg||
nt|star6ija: objasneno e 4e kontrata e majori|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|star6ija: republikanski 6ampioni za smeseni dvojki za 2009 godina sa 6u6i i brum, vtori sa Ten4o ot Haskovo s Mariana Ribarska ot Sofia, a treti sa Svetla Nenova i Stefan Georgiev (DEDO) ot ...|pg||
nt|star6ija: Varna|pg||
mb|d|mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|chthonic: It played from the other side  -- south -- in the other room and on a heart lead, only going up ace from dummy retains the tempo.... very tough, indeed.|pg||
mb|3D!|an|splinter|nt|chthonic: Seems that the heart suit is the key.|pg||
nt|chthonic: OK, this hand...|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|lestergold: 4s here is nopt incidentally that great acontract it makes because the spades behave and the hearts are 3/3|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: lets hear the brakes screech soon |pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: or they blast it being behind |pg||
