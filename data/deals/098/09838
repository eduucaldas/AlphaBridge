nt|odysseus69: well if they can make 11 tricks passing would be great idea|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|odysseus69: clear that North was thinking of passing 1Hx so attractive to lead own suit|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: better duck this|pg||
nt|ady: even one top diamond  and then low  bad    east can switch to a spade   and kill the entry  with diamonds blocked|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think there is any squeeze or pressure play its off|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|nt|odysseus69: difficult not to say bad things about that diamond play|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|an|strong 16+|nt|Walddk6: or East|pg||
nt|ineg: none, they play 5/5 only (2@H = 6 @S or 5/5 @S/m)|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Difficult to catch up when you pass a hand like East's|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|odysseus69: influenced by colours- for me 1S mandatory in 3rd suit regardless|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: How about Easts initial pass?|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I don't pass a 5-loser hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: 3n or 5c 3n by west best|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: east was lying in wait hoping to show his hand with an unusual nt on next round if oppos opened|pg||
nt|lestergold: its an old fadhioned gambit|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lestergold: has its virtues easier to show the hand that way especially as clubs longer than diamodns and can  hardly set himself up to reverse|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ineg: NS have the opening 2nt for minors, obviously EW have not and then I prefer waiting too|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the one slight attraction of passing is that when you dash in later with minors it suggests 6 clubs and 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes an extension of my point Victo|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|odysseus69: the one argument against opening is that if you start with 1 club you may have to suppress diamonds - if you start with 1D you may end up in the wrong suit|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course 3n would not look to good on 3 to the k of clubs in one hand and an early entry breaker|pg||

nt|Walddk6: Suppose you advance @HJ and it holds. Then what?|pg||
nt|Walddk6: That's declarer's problem|pg||
nt|odysseus69: simplest is heart to 8 - club ruff- spade to dummy - club ruff then second spade|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: a doomed 4s because south hasnt then necessary peripheral vision|pg||

nt|lestergold: hell drop qs now|pg||
nt|ady: playing for spades 3-2 and finesse will fail     could refuse spade finesse and if queen does not come down play on clubs    but that will fail if playing for queen to come down|pg||
nt|ady: however as Q@S is doubleton    that line works|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 1 off still good bridge|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes many things to try but it fails as we can see|pg||

nt|ineg: yes, agree, 3@D or 2NT would be my choice (I prefer 3@D)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if u are playing 15-17 nt do you break just because you have 4 good spades altho min points overall|pg||
