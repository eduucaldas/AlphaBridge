mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|lesniak: very nice but not so easy slame|pg||
nt|lestergold: because  players normally leave that sort of one shot finesse for a later option|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 6@H is not a make, but 6@S is. Not so easy to bid.|pg||
nt|saurier: if suoth has a possibility to show a huge hand with spades north will cue|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|saurier: too high:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6s is a pretty good slam|pg||
nt|lesniak: Jagniewski should bid something diferant from 4 spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jagniewski should not sign off when looking at 2 keycards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We agree Lesniak|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has a good fit for the splinter, but only an ace and a king outside. Not so easy for him to bid high on that.  |pg||
nt|lesniak: maybe -last train 4 hearts if not 5 clubs|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Well bid!|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|pelu: no bidding from CR - they have restarted 2-3 times, så small problem|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: its called partnership trust|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|brolucius: Now North will sign off have already stretched to the limit (or even beyond that...). But of course South was looking for a grand and therefore still goes to six.|pg||
nt|lestergold: makes on almost all 3/2 spade breaks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like 4@H as Last Train here. "I am interested in slam but have no convenient way of telling you. I do not promise a heart control"|pg||
nt|brolucius: Trouble can be that quick 4@H shows a heart control and slow 4@H is last train...|pg||
nt|lestergold: when south bid 5h he was obviously thinkiong of the grand it only needed the qs alongside the K to make the grand reasonable|pg||
nt|lesniak: spade-heart layout is good for declarer- he cannot loose his contract|pg||
nt|pelu: after a @H-lead no safe-play in @S - or he can play @SA and a @S to 9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last Train. The only remaining slam-try below the level of game, sometimes used to encourage a further slam try but unrelated to the holding in the suit bid;|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||

nt|lesniak: 1club= 12-14 bal, 12-22 with clubs, 18-23 bal|pg||
nt|brolucius: A fortunate double-fit in the red suits cancels out the mis-fit in spades.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|lesniak: other openings on level 1 are 12-21 not like in Polish club 12-17|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has to judge whether to play a spade now, or to draw trumps. Spade looks better to me.|pg||
nt|lestergold: the final raise to 4h was far from automatic they do not have a cl;ue about the double red suit fit|pg||
nt|brolucius: I suppose he might rely on the @D10 being with th @DJ and draw trumps. |pg||
nt|lesniak: both are working|pg||
nt|brolucius: Which will also be OK.|pg||
nt|lestergold: east's hand could have been close to useless on some west hands consistent with the bidding such as vlaues  in clubs instead of diamodns|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our next match (in about 1 hour) features Germany 2 and Netherlands|pg||
nt|lesniak: Y but anyway E must bid a game- to much  things to mage a game good proposition|pg||
nt|saurier: i think terraneo is considering if he can make 4H if the reds dont break|pg||
nt|lesniak: surelly |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|brolucius: If the trumps are 4-1, he may need to play a spade. Ah, he is drawing trumps.|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has probably decided that he has to play for the reds to be breaking as he knows ace of spades wrong so spades could only provide 1 trick|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A Multi was good enough for E-W in the other room to bid the game|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|saurier: 3nt instead of 4H probalbly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is a very light 1-opening|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: 3n inferior here- 4h makes even if u lose 2 heart tricks 3n could be vulnerable to a spade attack if the general layout was not as favourable eg swop holdings in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: For the second hand in a row, declarer will imagine many dangers but the lie of the cards is benign.|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H is a better game that 3NT - u can discard a @S-loser on @DJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lesniak: but cards lay so favorable that any sensible way to play is winer|pg||
nt|lestergold: as  it happens 3n cannot fail whatever line declarer takes|pg||
nt|pelu: Multu is ok for me - sometimes u have maximum :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|brolucius: Declarer holds up, with a double stopper, so North will have no spade left if/when he wins the lead in some other suit.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|saurier: ecxellent switch but..........|pg||
nt|saurier: 9 of clubs will solve all problems|pg||
nt|brolucius: The heart suit is dead but declarer can turn to clubs.|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is why 3n is an inferior contract as such|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|pelu: for sure Terraneo a thinking: wht didnt I let my pd play 4@H :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but it was difficult to bid it differently when West held two spade stoppers.|pg||
nt|saurier: ducked K of H will solve all problems|pg||
nt|pelu: he cant be sure, that East has a 6-card-suit, but he could bid 2@S over 2@H|pg||
nt|lesniak: very complex hand especially for defenders|pg||
nt|brolucius: Presumably North can rule out @DA-J-x-x with South because of the spot-card led at Trick 2.|pg||
nt|pelu: N cant read the @H-position - but for sure Est dont have a singleton af play @HK|pg||
nt|lesniak: and also declarer would not duck first spade|pg||
nt|saurier: i think he has to take and try his luck in D|pg||
nt|lesniak: He -probablly knows he hase no chance|pg||
nt|lestergold: no other defence could have any future that could be seen form the north hand|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|pelu: N know that pd @C-honnors are for finess - so no defence|pg||

nt|pelu: against Denmark The irish managed to play 7@S from the West hand - no ruff and 2210|pg||
nt|brolucius: West may regret his redouble, which was perhaps the reason why North decided to bid 5@C. |pg||
