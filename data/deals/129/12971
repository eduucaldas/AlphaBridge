nt|h_karluk: i meant in previous hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes we were right  2@C at the other table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nice guess again|pg||
nt|justin c: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like the wrong set of boards has been loaded|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: congratulations Kath|pg||
nt|turkforces: .|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yo_yo: :)|pg||
nt|jackthelad: not much to get excited about here|pg||
nt|roswolf: are we live operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: straightforward 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Looks for all the world like a 1NT contrcat by west|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I suspect this will end in 3N, and make when the opening lead is a heart|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: funny bidding by west but that's their system|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 4@h would be fair enough to buy |pg||
nt|chick: I can't see E finding a club lead|pg||
nt|jackthelad: nice part score....any dreams of the Moysian @s get killed real quick|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: i think that was Walsh|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: too many tricks potential after partner opened|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: just 5 losers say partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: interesting point here as to whether 2@H shows extras|pg||
nt|justin c: cold 6@S|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|chick: 5@D has no chance, because W will lead a heart (maybe even cash a club first)|pg||
nt|chick: so they stop short of game and NS miss a big chance|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: unfortunately the link to the murchan system doesnt work|pg||
nt|jackthelad: N/S dont really have the values for game|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzdu: Sorry initial problems with the open room so just results for the first few boards|pg||
nt|justin c: even with this trump break|pg||
pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: or 4/3 with a stiff - restricted choice|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: They play canape|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i got it now, on IE|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would claim in case @s A drawn now |pg||
nt|yo_yo: Blue club|pg||
nt|chick: 26 NT playing points between them (HCP plus @D length)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: We have a problem with the boards this is in hand 19 sothe vul is wrong|pg||
mc|12|nt|yo_yo: ty heather|pg||

nt|jackthelad: good judgement :)|pg||
nt|justin c: how many @S for east i wonder|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok ty for info|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 23 vs 17 there|pg||
nt|chick: but 3N would have been lucky to make because there were ways to set it|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|h_karluk: i feel myself a traveller in past - long years ago those were the stuff practice everyday|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you mean Blue Club?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe a destiny|pg||
nt|h_karluk: absolutely|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: you like it?|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|h_karluk: and later on TRS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i liked it much|pg||
nt|justin c: the 1@D opening promised 4@D i think, so 4@D not as odd as it would otherwise be|pg||
nt|justin c: 5@D and 4@S both failing|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: but the problem was to find studious partner|pg||
nt|roswolf: srong club|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chick: N doesn't have much to do now ... even NT with a singleton in partner's suit isn't appealing|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@H beatable with a @D ruff|pg||
nt|justin c: neg @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: TRS - tony forrester, raymond brock, steve lodge invented a nice strong pass relay sys in that years|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what will murchan do, pass?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nowadays i guess allowed in level 5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i guess this is catch up time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|roswolf: 4@H looks pre-destined|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 2@H a lot better than a 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|justin c: i see a couple of hearts, a spade and a club to lose here|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@H not a bad contract, but everything wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Continuing to try and solve the problem so showing you the hands and bidding as best we can|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jackthelad: routine now|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: you need a good memory for those funny systems|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the trouble is sometimes films lost :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: if you play TRS your opps have no chance unless they start bidding|pg||
nt|garnetts: the Ax in spades tells you that even if it is a Moysian fit you have a ruffing value|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|jackthelad: depends on style....2@h by N here would guarantee 4|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzdu: Sorry lost it working at another table|pg||
nt|justin c: np|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|justin c: double looks better to me for south|pg||
nt|justin c: needs to be careful here|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: and i was living in turkiye, currency exchange were not allowed, so we were asking to our friends educating there to send us with post monthly bridge magazine/s :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: EW system: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2010/ccards/Ciara-John.pdf|pg||
nt|garnetts: Moysian after the late US player Sonny Moyse who had a penchant for opening with three card majors |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|justin c: will ruff out the @SA now|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|garnetts: Nothing to do with style and everyhting to do with judgement|pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgehands.com/M/Moysian_Fit.htm.htm|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|garnetts: even if 2@H show four I would bid it|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|garnetts: Let partner improve his or her card play |pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|garnetts: playing the odd 4-3 is good for it |pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|justin c: if it didnt drop, could try to drop the @C10, and if that didnt drop, try the @D finesse|pg||
pc|hJ|mc|10|pg||
qx|c22|st||md|4SKQJ9874HJ97DJ8C3,S2HAT5DAQ975CAQJ7,S6HK642DKT4C98542,SAT53HQ83D632CKT6|sv|e|nt|garnetts: a heart rather then a @D would I think get one more trick for the defence|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting layout there|pg||
nt|jackthelad: sadistic dealer |pg||
nt|justin c: can always correct club replies to @D|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@S-X-P-3NT?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|roswolf: very possible|pg||
mb|d|nt|jackthelad: pass is the best bid on this hand...as soon as possible|pg||
nt|justin c: wrong :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: so far 3N makeable|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 3NT clearly makes and is likely to be bid I think|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and there's a clear danger for overboard quickly|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H makes it almost inevitable |pg||
nt|justin c: Wests hand here appears in the MSC often|pg||
nt|justin c: E will just pass this out|pg||
nt|roswolf: well double passed out likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a bit too much!?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|justin c: My opps always bid 1NT and land on their feet|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: i think 3N wld save th day|pg||
nt|garnetts: There is that danger maybe East should pass 2@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: standard defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like -2 but is that enough compensation?|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT would make for EW, so 300 not wonderful here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jackthelad: both pairs did well to get out quick|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: my crystall ball is bleak right now|pg||
nt|garnetts: Although I do not subscribe to the view that bidding shows extras|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d5|pc|c2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|dburn: thank you, partner|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d7|pc|h2|nt|justin c: EW look close to 5@C here|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think 3@S is a poor bid--he has already shown that suit--why not 3NT it could be as is the case here a desire to hear 3NT |pg||
nt|h_karluk: exactly|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|jackthelad: declarer should get out for one down|pg||
nt|chick: depending on how he plays the @Ds|pg||
nt|chick: and I think on what N leads now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jackthelad: it should be obvious to the def now |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: this is to cut ruff|pg||
pc|cT|nt|justin c: 1@S is a dogs breakfast, of course|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h5|pc|c8|pc|sT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: still, not at all clear what Crouch ought to have led - spade certainly reasonable, and declarer might have gone right in the suit anyway|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|justin c: If W doubles, time will slow down as E reaches for a 2@H card|pg||
nt|justin c: If he bids 1NT, E transfers him into @H|pg||
nt|justin c: but if you pass, you get this|pg||
nt|justin c: nothing very good for W to do|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|s8|nt|chick: looks like you called it right :)|pg||
nt|justin c: try a @D finesse for -1?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dburn: likely to do that - mind you, if he'd kept a club in dummy and not a heart, would have been a sure thing|pg||
nt|justin c: west would be squeezed here |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm |pg||
nt|roswolf: as peter lost track of the cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: has?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well if this is a real tank the position should be crystal clear to declarer|pg||
