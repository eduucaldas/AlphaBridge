nt|roswolf: good result that for the english|pg||
nt|justin c: difficult lead for east|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|chick: all roads led to 10 tricks :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: board 18 is actual board 17|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: we get to see the N/S system|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c includes all 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have around 8 tricks in spades|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jallerton: 1@d response is 4+ @h|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: East will pre-empt over North|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: though West might intervene|pg||
nt|chick: ah, here we go, something to talk about at least :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: an unlucky 4@H to fail|pg||
mb|2H|nt|justin c: 4@H here I imagine|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@H or3NT is the choice|pg||
nt|chick: predictions?   1@H  2@H  4@H P, down 1 :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: now too high|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 5D is missing three aces and four hearts can be beaten with a ruff|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: This gives the free option of a double|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: but only one off|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: who is leading this event overall?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: although, E could save the diamond loser by setting up the @SQ for a pitch|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|ady: difficult to blame east   2NT strong invote with 4 spades   but a simple cu at 2 level would have worked out better|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, I prefer to use 2@h as a good 4-card raise (2@c would be a good 3-card raise)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ireland on completed matches by 1 vp|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: small swing as 5D is also one off|pg||
nt|chick: @SK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcphee: might be able to dump the @D loser on K@S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|justin c: might be a nailbiter|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|mcphee: so may well make this one|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|pdjourdain: the heart goes on the spade|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|chick: may not have enough entries for that and twice finessing the @CA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|jallerton: 2NT is useful as a natural call|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mcphee: so save the @D loser but lose 2@C|pg||
nt|mcphee: how could you raise me with such shiddy trumps pard:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: shoody|pg||
nt|mcphee: i'll get the spelling right soon|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d4|pc|hQ|nt|justin c: 11 on top for declarer after the @D lead|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jallerton: particularly against opponents such at these who will open and respond quite light|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: take the @DA and play for 3-3 clubs?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: or take the slightly better odds of the finesse?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d9|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||

nt|mcphee: 3@S dble 3N |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: vul game wins|pg||
nt|mcphee: and should make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: on bd 18 the english bid 6@C for a useful swing|pg||
nt|mcphee: well passing seems a very deep postion here to me|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S can make, but he has to finesse the @S10 on the first spade trick|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jallerton: undo|pg||
nt|mcphee: or 10@D|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|jallerton: pass by South|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@h by West|pg||
nt|jallerton: Helen|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: I think Board 1 was flat not 15 to NI as the score was wrongly entered|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mcphee: E took quite a view here|pg||
nt|chick: yes, but I think 3N is equally dangerous ... W doesn't have to have nearly as good a hand as he actually has|pg||
nt|mcphee: so remove the Q@D and 3N is still a make|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would not expect my p[artner to dble 3@S facing a passed hand vul with a poor hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is no 1-4-4-4 12 count t/o dble|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|roswolf: the spade overcalll may have kept the irish out of trouble|pg||
nt|chick: yes, in the open room, EW did not make 4@S :)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: And Wales has stopped in game on board 3 when NI failed in  a slam|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: so once those two are in Wales has a lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|justin c: W might have passed 2@D here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chick: declarer has a lot of work to do, and the strong hand is exposed |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|jallerton: interesting double, which North may regret|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think S should have unblocked the J@D after seeing E play the 2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|chick: better for S to just bid the 2@H I think|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: thats the slam swing in but the scoring error on the first board has to be corrected|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|justin c: hard to analyze this one - potential endplays everywhere|pg||
nt|chick: good example of when a re-transfer bid is needed|pg||
nt|chick: yes, agree|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: would rather defend 4@S|pg||
pc|d9|nt|justin c: NS can win this, cash 2@C, put dec in with a @S|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: the first double by Dafydd was "poor diamonds" the second "good hearts"|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mcphee: good play|pg||
nt|chick: has unblocked it now :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: now can actually play safe for an over trick!|pg||
nt|mcphee: well like an over trick wif he makes it|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is going to cost 15 imps I predict|pg||
nt|chick: if he manages to work it all out correctly|pg||

nt|mcphee: still rates with win 11 |pg||
nt|mcphee: i can see n/s getting to hi this time|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|jallerton: is 4@s in any danger on a @C lead?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: any game will fail|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: likely to play 4@S  e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 20 the irish didnt bid game|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3N difficult to reach|pg||
nt|mcphee: although 3N is a winner|pg||
nt|chick: the weak 2 will slow them down a bit|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: double seems ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1nt is a little obscure|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: It will surprise Dafydd when south runs to spades!|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: a @S lead against 3NT would remove the entry to the @D suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: as is pass!!!|pg||
nt|justin c: not so obscure by west :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|chick: some might argue for opening the S hand with 1@S (not me, though)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: ah sense at last|pg||
nt|mcphee: mackenzie taking a dm view of this hand|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|ady: slam possibilities are fair   but would fail on the lay out|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: i play penalty doubles after 1N overcall and rescue, not takeout|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is a squence where multi falls short a bit|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|chick: would you run to diamonds in N?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chick: as do I|pg||
nt|chick: no need, W has rescued them|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Gary did not know the double was clearly for penalties|pg||
pc|s7|nt|justin c: spoke too soon ...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: lack of aces is a problem for declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed justin|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: west  satisfied with game    diamonds are a a bit wesk to look for more|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chick: if the first X were for penalty, the 2nd one would certainly also be|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps S should take another bid|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Though his hand does suggest a NT contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|justin c: somebody should put a red card on this|pg||
nt|petepunt: East may have been better passing and picking them up in 100's here|pg||
nt|chick: my thought also, Pete|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: quite a few play the same method as they do over a weak notrump, namely takeout doubles of any rescue|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jallerton: declarer might start with the @d finesse or maybe just lead @sQ out of hand|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mcphee: if 2@S shows a hand with interst in 4@H|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|justin c: but not sure who|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: ah red cards are banned in bridge|pg||
nt|roswolf: on in football are they relevant|pg||
nt|roswolf: only|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petepunt: we had the oppossite of this earier in the day where west had a penalty x of 2@S n the same auction and passed.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chick: same pair?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps N could bid 2N (15+), as a spec suggests :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: of course the problem is that S has no idea how many @S holds|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: dont like heart play|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: declarer knows his fate|pg||
nt|petepunt: no damage though, avoided 4@H.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petepunt: yes,  but GJones ahd the non-dbl choice|pg||
nt|mcphee: the N hand|pg||
mc|9|nt|mcphee: so opportunities for both sides on the first 2 boards|pg||
