Do you rebid 2NT to show your strength (with the flaw of having xx diamond and concealed QJx support for partner)? Or do you bid 2C ...|pg||
nt|mrnye: then show your spades later?|pg||

nt|mrnye: i think i would rebid 2C then maybe jump to 3S over partner's 2H bid to show a good invite with 3 spades|pg||
nt|janm: 2NT was a little bit of an overbid, also - I'd like more than this, wouldn't you? But he must have been concerned that his partner might pass 2@c with a hand that would make a ...|pg||
nt|janm: vulnerable game|pg||

nt|janm: McGann attacking dummy's entry to the spade 10 before it gets set up|pg||
nt|mrnye: I guess in the polish methods 1C denies 18+ so the 2nt bid probably shows exactly 17 and 5332|pg||
nt|mrnye: so it is probably more attractive to rebid 2NT if you are playing polish club|pg||
nt|mrnye: Playing standard, I think I prefer 2C rather than showing it as 18-19 balanced|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrnye: sorry, I meant to say 1H denies 18+ since you would have opened 1C with 18+|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|janm: So the 2NT bid was descriptive, although it still concealed the spade support and risked being too hight if responder didn't have much|pg||

mb|2C|an|!|mb|p|nt|mrnye: yes and the direct 2NT jump also protected the club suit from a potentially dangerous lead if played by north|pg||
mb|2H|an|!|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|mrnye: so a double partscore swing here will likely get 7 imps back for Hans for a final result of 155-81 and a convincing win for the Polish team Consus Oil.|pg||
