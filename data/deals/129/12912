nt|henryb:  do you really intend to pass partner's diamond response? or show a monster by bidding your hearts after doubling?|pg||
nt|henryb:  YYYYYuch|pg||
nt|april7: in this case it shows at least 5 @H and 4@S without additional strength in my system|pg||
nt|april7: the reason is you might lose a @S fit,think about it|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would not mind a delayed double: over 3@c. that would bring spades back into the picture|pg||
nt|april7: you might not have the time|pg||
nt|henryb:  meanwhile Nab-Drijver missed a game |pg||
nt|april7: y, and 5@S is good defence|pg||
