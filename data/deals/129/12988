mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: what will South do over a 1@S opening - double or 2@D|pg||

nt|jackthelad: afternoon all.....nice little challenge for E/W here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jackthelad: did the job though|pg||
nt|garnetts: virtually a forced 3NT from North which can be made |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: But not at all convinced it will be |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: My point is that there is no need to double as partner can still balance |pg||
nt|garnetts: But of course we always have the clever lead to consider |pg||
nt|h_karluk: John or Brian Short? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Brian|pg||
nt|garnetts: on a heart lead it would take some inspired declarer play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@S here not usually played as a game try, more as a shut-out bid, to make things difficult for NS  |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: then south is David |pg||

pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: i am okay with fast, however i prefer accuracy|pg||
nt|garnetts: so do I looking at all four hands but from Norths viewpoint he needs five club tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Lots of questions fromj Brian about the initial lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: The game seems to be over complicated for too many people--like leading your long suit against no-trumps--why bother when you lead something else|pg||

nt|dohicky:  no :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, certainly not NS |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east will balance with 2@D and west has to decide how much of his hand his partner has bid already|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: of course, king in each of partner's suits and a side ace is nice, but i don't think west will be envisaging game|pg||
mb|2H|nt|garnetts: ruff three spades is a good idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i prefer 2@C actually,  |pg||

pc|d7|nt|h_karluk: still trying to review abt theor savings|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: too many tricks potential after partner opened|pg||

nt|justin c: cold 6@S|pg||
nt|athene: but he doesn't have any room to show mild interest|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: several danger signs - strong diamonds opposite shortage, and relatively bad trumps|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chick: 5@D has no chance, because W will lead a heart (maybe even cash a club first)|pg||

nt|justin c: the 1@D opening promised 4@D i think, so 4@D not as odd as it would otherwise be|pg||
nt|justin c: 5@D and 4@S both failing|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: but the problem was to find studious partner|pg||
nt|roswolf: srong club|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chick: N doesn't have much to do now ... even NT with a singleton in partner's suit isn't appealing|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@H beatable with a @D ruff|pg||
nt|justin c: neg @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: TRS - tony forrester, raymond brock, steve lodge invented a nice strong pass relay sys in that years|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what will murchan do, pass?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nowadays i guess allowed in level 5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i guess this is catch up time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be|pg||
nt|athene: south has a fairly unappealing lead decision against 3nt|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: 4@H looks pre-destined|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 2@H a lot better than a 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|justin c: i see a couple of hearts, a spade and a club to lose here|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@H not a bad contract, but everything wrong|pg||

nt|justin c: wrong :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: so far 3N makeable|pg||
mb|3S|nt|garnetts: 3NT clearly makes and is likely to be bid I think|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and there's a clear danger for overboard quickly|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H makes it almost inevitable |pg||
nt|justin c: Wests hand here appears in the MSC often|pg||
nt|justin c: E will just pass this out|pg||
nt|roswolf: well double passed out likely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H best here, but how to get there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a bit too much!?|pg||
nt|athene: west will just bid 4@S i am sure|pg||
mb|4S|nt|justin c: My opps always bid 1NT and land on their feet|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i think 3N wld save th day|pg||
nt|garnetts: There is that danger maybe East should pass 2@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: standard defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like -2 but is that enough compensation?|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT would make for EW, so 300 not wonderful here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S should be ok too.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: both pairs did well to get out quick|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: my crystall ball is bleak right now|pg||
nt|garnetts: Although I do not subscribe to the view that bidding shows extras|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|justin c: EW look close to 5@C here|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think 3@S is a poor bid--he has already shown that suit--why not 3NT it could be as is the case here a desire to hear 3NT |pg||
nt|h_karluk: exactly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 20-odd years ago I played a system where you could show a strong 6331 hand after 1M-1N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: happy days|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|jackthelad: declarer should get out for one down|pg||
nt|chick: depending on how he plays the @Ds|pg||
nt|chick: and I think on what N leads now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jackthelad: it should be obvious to the def now |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: this way you can't lead spades twice towards your hand of course|pg||

pc|c7|nt|justin c: 1@S is a dogs breakfast, of course|pg||

pc|s2|nt|athene: but that isn't likely to help you much anyway with this suit|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dburn: still, not at all clear what Crouch ought to have led - spade certainly reasonable, and declarer might have gone right in the suit anyway|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h2|pc|s9|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|roswolf: spade partscore likely|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H likely here, and unfortunately the defence have the first three diamonds with a trump or two to come|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North is picking up some nice hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 3rd 3N for EW|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT is more fun|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: likely not much than 4@s for EW|pg||
nt|jackthelad: interesting call for both E and S|pg||
nt|justin c: lots of losers in @H - EW heading overboard|pg||
nt|athene: just needs 4-3 diamonds or blockage or no diamond lead|pg||
nt|athene: east can't seriously consider 3nt here|pg||
nt|athene: he seems to be considering something, though!|pg||

mb|4H|nt|chick: and now for N as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: you have your fun justin|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, his hand is worth opening - some play that 2@s is a sound weak two bid, but possibly not this pair|pg||
nt|justin c: my powers of analysis tell me that cashing the @HAK, @SA and @DA would beat 4@S, but not 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is frigid|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: good pass - as probably fsf in their system card|pg||
nt|jackthelad: N has no choice...2@h|pg||
nt|chick: or Pass|pg||
nt|justin c: think they play strong @C, so probably lightish openings|pg||
nt|dburn: then the rest of us can sit back and let you take over for the remainder of the match - analysis 100% so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: Anna says the 3 spades might be a cue|pg||
pc|c4|nt|garnetts: If north had the 9@S it would make a big difference |pg||
nt|athene: the defence will probably still get two diamonds and two trumps here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: five-card majors, strong club, so West at liberty to pass out 1@h, thouhg no harm would have come to him had he bid|pg||

nt|h_karluk: 5 trumps out; 3/2 68%, 4/1 28%, 5/0 4%--probability of an honour card being: stiff 6 %, doubleton 27 %, trebleton 41 % |pg||

pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||

nt|h_karluk: okay guys, broadcast from Turkiye will start very soon, gl here, bye|pg||
nt|garnetts: Bye Hamdi |pg||
nt|chick: an ugly result for NIBU|pg||
nt|jackthelad: may well be repeated|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@S for NS|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be feisty|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: EW save in @C tho|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@S NS i imagine|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: they kept low in the OR on this one|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I would be in 3NT on this|pg||
nt|roswolf: unlikely to be now|pg||
nt|dburn: why not?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: depends how mouldy this muiderberg is|pg||
mb|1N|nt|h_karluk: in which seat?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I admit I could not resist opening 3@S --the sort of bad bid I like |pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: the younger amongs us may get interested with the N hand...I am sure Brian wont be|pg||
nt|jackthelad: ouch !...that makes my eyes water :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well e/w not in the auction therefore no feistiness|pg||
nt|dburn: if 2@s shows, as it appears to show, spades and a minor, South may well bid a game on discovering (to his surprise) that North has clubs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: north for me with a 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|chick: lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: tears of sadness or tears of joy?  :)|pg||
nt|athene: this looks like ten fairly uneventful tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: even if you were lucky to avoid killing @s lead prospects are not bright for 3N|pg||

pc|hK|nt|jackthelad: mmmmmm...a session of 20 GBP per hundred is in order david :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chick: -3 undoubled unvul is not that bad|pg||
nt|dburn: apparently 2@s was spades and any other suit, and 3@s showed a maximum with spades and clubs|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jackthelad: not for anyone with a weak constitution|pg||
nt|athene: if hearts were 5-2, declarer might give up on the spade finesse, on the basis that he can afford to lose the lead to south but not to north, so he just gives himself the extra ...|pg||
nt|athene: chance of singleton @SK offside|pg||
pc|h8|nt|garnetts: Rolling the dice as North could lead to anything--even a slam making for EW --playing for money at green I would certainly try it|pg||
nt|chick: hehehee|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|h_karluk: i think undelead @c a reasonable|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jackthelad: I'm with Brian...we are OLD :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: well, declarer could probably afford to cash a high spade first, just in case East was up to some trickery|pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: Not ready to get a pension book cover for my next birthday Ian|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jackthelad: well I do, and Shorty was 2 years in front of me at school |pg||
nt|athene: he can't cross to dummy with the @DA and take another spade finesse only to find north wins the @SK and the defence take the @HQ and some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: and crossing to the @DA would lose when south had four spades as well|pg||

nt|chick: whoa, the dealer for today must have been on drugs|pg||

mb|1S|nt|justin c: 6@C, anyone?|pg||
nt|roswolf: how high will n/s go|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: so 3IMPs lost for NS when failed to set 1 more|pg||
nt|jackthelad: yep.....part score again...anything higher should be punished|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: not my cup of tea|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 2@C for majors?|pg||
nt|jackthelad: both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: Woolsey|pg||
nt|justin c: you have been in worse geoff|pg||
nt|justin c: (quite a lot worse, truth to tell :) )|pg||
nt|roswolf: absolutely haven't we all|pg||
nt|athene: south had a borderline decision first time|pg||
nt|athene: now he has to wake up and double i suppose|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very dangerous |pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: 1.3% grands are my specialty|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: not much wrong with 6@c that I can see - perfectly decent contract, and South does not have to worry about a heart lead through the @hAQ|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: terrible 1N overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky:  eek|pg||

mb|p|pc|sT|nt|jackthelad: prefer garbage stayman there|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: off one|pg||
nt|garnetts: Why not 2@C and pass a major response or correct after 2@D--unless it would be forcing |pg||
nt|jackthelad: surprising lead|pg||
nt|justin c: would have thought 2@S for W, but i dont know the system they play|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like 2NT is artificial weakness showing bid|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: not quite sure what all this means - 3@c may have been asking in clubs, but what 4@d was I don't know (perhaps keycard Blackwood, but...)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: gulp, thinks South|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chick: without a club lead, this does have some hope|pg||
nt|jackthelad: yep...but not a lot|pg||
nt|athene: a good illustration here of why: a) it's safer to get in early and b) you double on hands like this, especially when your overcall is the most expensive suit, so it leaves partner ...|pg||
nt|athene: with nowhere to go|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|dburn: at any rate, whatever it all meant it got the job done|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jackthelad: mystified.....|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|dburn: not completely clear how to play, but a cross-ruff looks the best chance|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chick: now the club ruff is lost and the hand is made|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jackthelad: yes|pg||
pc|s4|nt|justin c: NIBU just gained a lot of points when the 'straightforward 3NT' was played in 5@D|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c2|pc|sQ|nt|yo_yo: in the OR  East preempted with 3@C and everyone passed|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dburn: but to do that, you should cash @sK first, then ruff spades with the eight and king, not mess around leading low spades from dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: write down two zeroes in the minus column, and fill in the rest later|pg||
pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: bloody bid|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: nor mess around leading low diamonds from hand - if you're going to play a cross-ruff, cash your high cards first|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: with an overtrick no less|pg||
nt|justin c: looks to me like 3NT is a much better contract, and that 5@D might make, but i dont know the gory details|pg||

nt|justin c: 4@H for EW would be entertaining|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you have to feel sorry for South, but 3@H was not really a very good bid|pg||
nt|athene: that's why the argument "it's safe to bid after you know opps don't have game values" just isn't true - opps can stop in a partscore and still have enough to kill you stone dead|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: it's all about finding a fit and double was much more likely to find the best fit than 3@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|justin c: just intra finesse trumps, guess @C, and chalk it up|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C!|nt|chick: yes, and I kinda think if you don't lead an A, you don't have an AK|pg||

nt|justin c: i read an article the other day, one of danny kleinman's many, that said five five in the blacks should open 1@C|pg||
nt|justin c: seemed quite convincing at the time|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jackthelad: @s win|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The Lawrence book says that 1@S-2@S is a very dangerous auction to re-open, as the 2@S bidder can have any other suit - as there  |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: ?|pg||

nt|athene: cue-raise and then a double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: geting a few questions as to which book - Mike Lawrence, The Complete Book of Overcalls|pg||
nt|dohicky:  Probably 8 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: it could be fewer - depends how many club ruffs west gets :)|pg||
nt|dohicky:  True|pg||
nt|athene: if she gets just one ruff she is likely to make the @SK too|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|athene: if declarer had played low from dummy at trick 1, West would have had a certain amount of agonizing to do over whether he had a singleton @DQ|pg||

mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: spades 2-2 , @d ace and @c K favorably placed|pg||
nt|garnetts: another 12 imps to Scotland after a verry poor piece of declarer play led to 4@S failing in this room--both the two swings could been avoided |pg||

nt|dburn: but there was some confusion at the start of this match regarding the boards, and perhaps that has not been entirely cleared up|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: i would begin with a heart |pg||
nt|chick: I would pass quietly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: I would have fancied 4NT by either e or w|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: really?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 10 cards in M suits and a void|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that goes against the grain here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he will show his shape first|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: @c AJT tempting|pg||
nt|garnetts: why bid 1@H?|pg||
nt|justin c: dont like the looks of 6@H here|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|jackthelad: but all credit to the ballsy 4@s|pg||
nt|athene: looks like a simple 4@H for west over 1nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, a bit of faffing around first |pg||
mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: i think uncontested 1@h>2@d ; 2@s etc would also work well|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now South has a difficult bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say 3@c fsf appeared, still 3@s ok|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fsf = 4th suit forcing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i believe in that way South will easily would make better guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if south bids 3NT his partner might be short in @C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5-5 in M so not hard to guess rest possibilities|pg||
nt|jackthelad: put off a @h lead ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: North has just mentioned he has that suit --and I would have thought ti showed five clubs too|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: is the faffing because of fear that partner has a singleton heart?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: surely west can't have slam ambitions|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: God bless all commentators of BBO - what a busy day since 06.00 am USA EST|pg||
nt|mdgraham: spare me from partnres who rebid 1NT with a singleton  |pg||
pc|c2|nt|dohicky:  They don't|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they should be taken out and shot  |pg||
nt|athene: i agree east can't really ever need to rebid 1nt there with a singleton heart|pg||
nt|athene: after 1@C - 1@H; 1NT might be 3-1-4-5 but 1@D - 1@H; 1NT has to be honest as the day is long, i guess|pg||
nt|dohicky:  And a lot of people get around that problem by oprning a canape 1@d on all 54 minor hands|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but east might not do that|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: I suppose if you are 3145 it can be awkward - KQx x AKxx Jxxxx say, we'd all hate to rebid 2@C|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|garnetts: The 1@H bid has led to a 1NT contract  which after this lead renders the west hand of little value--2@D is much better|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: too late now for the @D trick|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|garnetts: why not lead a spade back  |pg||
nt|justin c: guess you ruff a @S and squeeze S in the minors|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|h_karluk: absolutely 12 hours and 24 minutes passed in screen, wow|pg||
nt|garnetts: ressurected the west hand again|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jackthelad: agree.....completely lost tempo now|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|yo_yo: what did we do before BBO came on our computers?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: either party bridge or duplicate tournaments|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: but on the other hand, at least it shows that you have 5+clubs, and doesn't lead partner up the garden path about your heart length|pg||

nt|jackthelad: Slime is on a roll today...wont hear the end of it :)|pg||
nt|chick: hehehee  luck does play a part in this game|pg||
nt|justin c: definitely the best play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, rant over|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|yo_yo: This is Blue Club |pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky:  2@d shows a weak 2 in @h with some strong options|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|garnetts: 6@H is a fair contract here--but 6@C might be better on paper--hard to bid either and both might go off on the club suit split |pg||
nt|garnetts: 2nt LLOKS BEST TO ME |pg||
nt|jackthelad: my guess is that they will subside into 3nt....but |pg||
nt|garnetts: looks even |pg||
nt|dburn: this seems to be back to normal|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|jackthelad: Murphy's law of the unbalanced 2nt is that partner will always have your short suit|pg||
nt|justin c: dont like the looks of 6@H here either|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|yo_yo: 2@H shows a 4 card major|pg||
nt|justin c: cant ruff a @C without losing a trump trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: my syberian husky running for a record, again tangled up to another tree :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: West's hand isn't as good as it might at first appear - the point being, the great hearts are largely wasted|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: and 2@S asks which it is|pg||
nt|h_karluk: back to game - - good auction but some misfit layout|pg||
nt|yo_yo: dont they pull sledges?  |pg||
nt|justin c: dont know the details of the bidding methods|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chick: Ian, do you like the first double?   I would bid 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: facing a weak-2@H, @HAxxxx would be just as good|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: down on a club ruff - mildly unlucky|pg||
pc|c4|nt|justin c: but it looks better to me if north can show diamonds and get south to evaluate|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder why they just cant bid the major they have, would save a lot of time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mine german shepherd and syberian husky breed|pg||
nt|justin c: this @D switch not best|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jackthelad: would have been tempted to use puppet there...just in case !|pg||
nt|jackthelad: now this is in the lap of the Gods, and Brian was wishing that he HAD opened 2NT :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jackthelad: I like 1@s|pg||
pc|c8|nt|garnetts: the jack of hearts dropping might lead to defeat by play a club to the queen |pg||
nt|garnetts: in 6NT I mean|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely a flat result unless a big slip on defense|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a cunning duck, hoping they continue @D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely South knows the count in @D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: aiming to cut connection on defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far not bad foresight|pg||
nt|yo_yo: still he has a difficult lead back|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but the real problem is about own communication between hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes, there is none :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and to find safe discards|pg||
nt|jackthelad: 10 trix...next|pg||
nt|athene: even without a club ruff it would still be down if the @SK were offside|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jackthelad: Dave has obviously fallen in @h with this pile....BRAKES coming|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: David unsure about what the 4 diamonds is and has taken 3 goes at his final bid of 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Brian now in a brown study|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h5|nt|Walddk1: Good morning to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2NT opening are awlays difficult starts to an auction when borderline slams are possible --South did well with 4@C |pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hi Joe|pg||
nt|santyclz: 0640 here, wake me if something happens.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly it wasn't, and I am not sure what prompted it, but perhaps West could see that South might eventually throw a diamond loser on @hK|pg||
pc|d5|nt|justin c: he was concerned that a @D loser could go on the @HK i think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Q the right falsecard against reverse signallers - hasn't fooled North, though|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: say there were an entry to table then 3-3 @c (35.6 pct) wld be helpful|pg||
nt|justin c: the trick appears to have been returned|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: routine hands give me a chance to get my morning tea :)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

nt|dohicky:  yes|pg||
nt|dohicky:  it is|pg||

mb|p|nt|dohicky:  2@sx could have been fun|pg||
nt|athene: surely 2NT describes the west hand better than 3@H?|pg||

nt|athene: well, she will bid 3nt now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the spade stop isn't overly super - perhaps East can bid 3@S now to ask for one|pg||
