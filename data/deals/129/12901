nt|rodal f: Easy to fail against CR here.|pg||
nt|mrdct:  that could be a decicive board when we get to the end and will give adam and andy a confidence boost|pg||

mb|1N|an|!|mb|2D|nt|othered1: rather a good major suit fit|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct:  it's quite a long day for the teams finishing 3rd to 6th who play 72 boards compared to the top 2 who only play 48 - so fatigue may well be a factor towards the end of this match|pg||
mb|r|nt|mrdct:  need to defend carefully to beat 3NT by EW here|pg||

nt|chick: not the most effective lead|pg||

nt|rodal f: At 1st Cornelia? Pass or 2@H|pg||

nt|peachy: its just a tad too weak for me as 1H, of course now we know it is a perfect systemic bid for Adam|pg||

nt|rodal f: If I was E and pard as normal. A easy 1NT opening at W and P |pg||

nt|rodal f: What abough3-2@H and NT at S?|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, with Sartaj's 1NT opening here it seems they aren't playing a weak NT, that would have affected North's bidding on the previous hand|pg||

nt|mrdct:  a few imps flowing to Hans now from the early boards played at this table which werent very good for goren|pg||
nt|patricck: The closed room reached a better contract, but it will be 13 imps to the Hans team instead of the Goren team because of the trump break|pg||

mb|1D|nt|othered1: With some partners I have to pass the south hand because the suit isn't good enough to bid 2 and the hand not good enough to bid 1.  But that's very old-fashioned.|pg||

nt|mrdct:  stiff A opposite a splinter is not a good holding|pg||
nt|othered1: 3 Aces are good.  @C duplication bad. relatively weak trumps?|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bucheister: agreed you cannot be passive with that type of hand and expect to win|pg||
nt|peachy: mm, he went with the "aces"|pg||

nt|rodal f: Ain't @Stold for E tolead now? Corlenia:)|pg||
nt|peachy: this is an interesting topic, what does splinter show|pg||
nt|othered1: south has an interesting hand, but no aces.|pg||
nt|peachy: there are couple different schools of thought|pg||
nt|mrdct:  and no @H key cards|pg||
nt|othered1: some require specific numbers of side controls, others trump quality.  Most are generic.|pg||

nt|mrdct:  Hans ceratinly seem on paper to a much stronger team that the other pre-seeded semi-finalist|pg||
nt|chick: So congratulations to the Goren team!!   A close match -- Well done by both sides :)|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the top two teams from teh qualifying got this morning off and have been pre-seeded into the semis|pg||
nt|mrdct:  2 game swings was what goren needed and thats what they got|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same for the co operators - specs ans the nice vug operators|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you all.  Especially to all kibitzers without whom we would not even have these event s on vugraph!!|pg||
nt|bucheister: It actually came down to the last hand; if doubled in 3H S much go down an minimurm of 2 tricks and with good D 3 tricks;close match|pg||

nt|peachy: Hello everyone, second half of this match about to begin|pg||
nt|rodal f: As i told stroppy.Failed. But I had my fingersat the paper and tabakk. Ment @H. Sr specs:)|pg||
nt|patricck: i'm sure declarer started out hoping for much more tha down 3|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|mrdct:  ew have a game in @S here|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  should reach it easily with the double fit in @S and @D|pg||
nt|rodal f: So here we have AA against ZZ as a spec pointed:)|pg||
nt|mrdct:  south will make some sort of @H raise here|pg||
nt|peachy: i wonder why Dbl alrted|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|mrdct:  dbl probably shows 4+ @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct:  INT is likely to come to 1@S, 2@H, 2@C and 2@D - so east best be careful here|pg||
nt|rodal f: AreHung fightingfor a loss against good pairs?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: By the longtime.|pg||
nt|mrdct:  this isn't a disaster as they haven't been doubled into game and EW don't figure to be able to make anything themselves|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodal f: Y does|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|peachy: right, which was my "prob". Is neg Dbl alerted in Australia?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mrdct:  with no screens, no doubles are alerted in Aust , but with screens you alert everything|pg||
nt|chick: the prob with that X is that it is pretty strong for a conventional neg X|pg||
nt|mrdct:  good lead - as @S lead removes all doubt|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mrdct:  declarer can't play on @S himself so will now need to find his 7th trick elsewhere|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|peachy: perhaps in system 1S would not be "spades", I am just guessing|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|othered1: That's what it looks like|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still 7 and can be hard to hold them there|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mrdct:  @H are 3-3 so that will work - but he's trying @C first|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mrdct:  west saying "leave @S alone"|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: It was a good signal, but E missed the @C|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mrdct:  solid start for Consus - if this match comes down to the wire this wont a potential pick-up for goren|pg||
pc|s5|nt|patricck: presumably odd/even signals as otherwise you would signal with the 9@S or 7@S|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mrdct:  they might use 1@S as 8-10 balanced or similar|pg||
nt|mrdct:  mike ware looking good for +180 now|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|d2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|mrdct:  mmight make an overtrick if he can endplay west|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|h8|nt|rodal f: After the hook at @C and a @H NS was on at8|pg||
nt|patricck: Mike's favourite contract is 1NT, I'm not sure how he feels about 1NT doubled, but in this case he should be happy|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|mrdct:  beer card position emerging|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: As I saw this board it was min 10 tricks and always 11 by @SQ on so a push|pg||
nt|othered1: That's an increasingly common method|pg||
nt|peachy: I have too reasons to root for Horen: they are undersdogs now (I always root for underdogs) and  they are juniors (always root  for juniors)|pg||
nt|mrdct:  nah - he can't safely rectify the count for the beer card now|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

nt|mrdct:  this one looks like a slam for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: brb|pg||
nt|mrdct:  until you look at the EW cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any to go in the bare by the NS tables here?|pg||
nt|mrdct:  NS can make 4@h here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  actually slam is pretty marginal|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i think :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|peachy: even with even some breaks, handling problems|pg||
nt|mrdct:  trump lead might make it difficult|pg||
nt|patricck: how about trump leads?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  north would be bit more excited if he had some values in @D once the @C fit is found|pg||
nt|othered1: AS they say, A Roland Slam.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not by a @H lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: nah, Roland slams slip home:)|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if 2N shows extras in their style?|pg||
nt|rodal f: :) A hand for him, but stil to bad even there|pg||
nt|patricck: will be A@C and a trump switch|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|chick: I think it will be hard for them to stay out of slam|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess 3@H may imply @C fit.|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the aussie juniors are seeking funds to play in the White House Tournament later this month - info on ways you can help are at http://www.ozjuniorbridge.com/|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am not shure as long as N have 5@S ED. Else it does|pg||
nt|othered1: If north has shown opening NT values, this may peter out.  If he hasn't promised extras yet . .. |pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|chick: well, they ARE juniors, after all ... they fpm peter out :)|pg||
nt|mrdct:  now is where adam's lack of a @D card should ring alarm bells|pg||
nt|chick: fpm|pg||
nt|chick: don't*|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: Frankly, I think north is done, unless he has more extras.|pg||
nt|mrdct:  they are juniors but are well and truly amongst australia's top open players now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mrdct:  that double will help put the brakes on|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|rodal f: One of told. Are EW helping NS not to bid 6@C?|pg||
nt|othered1: some play that south's pass over the double is meaningful.  Others just nothing more to say|pg||
nt|mrdct:  south hasn't cued a 2nd round @H control so there is one loser and @D are by no means sewn-up|pg||
nt|chick: N still thinking about it :)|pg||
nt|mrdct:  4@H was likely to go down several actually as declarer is going to hook @D twice to try to make it - but in 2@H will come home with 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now isinteresting|pg||
nt|patricck: ruff a club and cncede a spade|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Can be bough still. Or not ED?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|othered1: south is also done, as north hasn't guaranteed @SA,  has he?|pg||
nt|mrdct:  so far so good - but 5@C may not be safe either|pg||
nt|rodal f: I waited 4@S and 5@C from S as a small invit for 6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: not at all as the cards lie.|pg||
nt|peachy: close, I think me night make|pg||
