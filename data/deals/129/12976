nt|h_karluk: interesting layout there|pg||
nt|jackthelad: sadistic dealer |pg||
nt|justin c: can always correct club replies to @D|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@S-X-P-3NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: re|pg||
nt|roswolf: are the boards sorted now|pg||
nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|roswolf: very possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: pass is the best bid on this hand...as soon as possible|pg||
nt|justin c: wrong :)|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|h_karluk: so far 3N makeable|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 3NT clearly makes and is likely to be bid I think|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and there's a clear danger for overboard quickly|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H makes it almost inevitable |pg||
nt|justin c: Wests hand here appears in the MSC often|pg||
nt|justin c: E will just pass this out|pg||
nt|roswolf: well double passed out likely|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: a bit too much!?|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: My opps always bid 1NT and land on their feet|pg||
mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: i think 3N wld save th day|pg||
nt|garnetts: There is that danger maybe East should pass 2@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: standard defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like -2 but is that enough compensation?|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT would make for EW, so 300 not wonderful here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: both pairs did well to get out quick|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: my crystall ball is bleak right now|pg||
nt|garnetts: Although I do not subscribe to the view that bidding shows extras|pg||

nt|h_karluk: he had much chances to enter table and shift @c b4 pulling @s A|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Yes he played it like that|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps not|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure if anyone is actually thinking on this trick - declarer probably wondering what to do on the twelfth|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: spade partscore likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 3rd 3N for EW|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT is more fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: like west's change of name:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|justin c: lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well game should be reached now south thinks his hand is worth opening|pg||
nt|dburn: a U-turn, so to speak|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: likely not much than 4@s for EW|pg||
nt|jackthelad: interesting call for both E and S|pg||
nt|justin c: lots of losers in @H - EW heading overboard|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|yo_yo: did Ciara really declare on all those hands?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: and now for N as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: you have your fun justin|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|dburn: well, his hand is worth opening - some play that 2@s is a sound weak two bid, but possibly not this pair|pg||
nt|justin c: my powers of analysis tell me that cashing the @HAK, @SA and @DA would beat 4@S, but not 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is frigid|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: good pass - as probably fsf in their system card|pg||
nt|jackthelad: N has no choice...2@h|pg||
nt|chick: or Pass|pg||
nt|justin c: think they play strong @C, so probably lightish openings|pg||
nt|dburn: then the rest of us can sit back and let you take over for the remainder of the match - analysis 100% so far|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|garnetts: If north had the 9@S it would make a big difference |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|dburn: five-card majors, strong club, so West at liberty to pass out 1@h, thouhg no harm would have come to him had he bid|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|jackthelad: N will struggle to probably 8 trix|pg||
nt|justin c: 2@D, @D ruff, 2@H off the top|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|justin c: sad|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|garnetts: why not Q@C  makes it easier for partner to see what is happening |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5 trumps out; 3/2 68%, 4/1 28%, 5/0 4%--probability of an honour card being: stiff 6 %, doubleton 27 %, trebleton 41 % |pg||
nt|jackthelad: good lead|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|justin c: something depressing about writing minus 80 on the scorecard|pg||
nt|justin c: best avoided by balancing, and going for 300 instead|pg||

mb|1N|nt|jackthelad: how tempting is a slam here ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be trappy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: This is another example where 2@S by EW is a reasonable contract |pg||
nt|chick: if NS find their way to 6@H, will make on anything except a spade lead|pg||
nt|justin c: should have forced dummy to ruff a C at the end there|pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: but the key card is with E...so doomed|pg||
nt|roswolf: east staying very low|pg||
pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: moysian fit|pg||
nt|dburn: probably facing 14-16 rather than 15-17|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: i think double by North would also work well|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if EW keep quite they defend 3NT maybe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: quiet|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: tho i disagree Ciara's 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Finally caught up - lost the connection|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chick: N opened on 9 HCP  (mind you, I agree with that), so he will discourage slam tries|pg||
nt|jackthelad: Iain squirming now :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|garnetts: 2@C  is just plain daft |pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: so 3N expected now|pg||
nt|jackthelad: 2@h works as well|pg||
nt|chick: but if he reads the 4@S as the A, won't hesitate now|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Yes!|pg||
nt|justin c: NS need to be in this auction|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|h_karluk: luckily 3/3 35.6 % @h break there|pg||
pc|cT|nt|garnetts: Well it does Ian but what of his partner has KJxxx in spades then 4@S works well too|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: not much tough contract|pg||
nt|chick: now it's all in whether E leads the @SA|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jackthelad: lucky Iain|pg||
pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: just watch the auction and bring it to home|pg||
nt|justin c: would rather try to make 4@S than try to beat this|pg||
nt|dburn: still, this was East-West's hand in 3@d|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h2|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jackthelad: they should employ checkback then|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d6|nt|garnetts: He has run into a real problem because I am sure that 2@S after this sequence would show extras--therefore bid 2@S initially|pg||
pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: i think would claim|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|dburn: or 2@d, as at the other table after a slightly more descriptive sequence by West|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: @h hook obviously off|pg||

nt|chick: good careful play|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 2@c rebid was natural - checkback after minor - major, then 1N sequence?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Cannot use checkback without a 1NT rebid can you?  There is a case for employing 2@C as an artificial ask though after the 1@S response|pg||
mc|6|nt|roswolf: a few more imps back to the trailing team|pg||

nt|garnetts: Bye Hamdi |pg||
nt|chick: an ugly result for NIBU|pg||
nt|jackthelad: may well be repeated|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@S for NS|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be feisty|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|justin c: EW save in @C tho|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@S NS i imagine|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: they kept low in the OR on this one|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I would be in 3NT on this|pg||
nt|roswolf: unlikely to be now|pg||
nt|dburn: why not?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|roswolf: depends how mouldy this muiderberg is|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: in which seat?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I admit I could not resist opening 3@S --the sort of bad bid I like |pg||
mb|3S!|nt|jackthelad: the younger amongs us may get interested with the N hand...I am sure Brian wont be|pg||
nt|jackthelad: ouch !...that makes my eyes water :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well e/w not in the auction therefore no feistiness|pg||
nt|dburn: if 2@s shows, as it appears to show, spades and a minor, South may well bid a game on discovering (to his surprise) that North has clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: north for me with a 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|chick: lol|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: tears of sadness or tears of joy?  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: even if you were lucky to avoid killing @s lead prospects are not bright for 3N|pg||
nt|garnetts: As Wilde once said I can resist anyhting but temptation|pg||
nt|jackthelad: agony :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yo_yo: they are not :)|pg||

nt|justin c: cant argue with success|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jackthelad: mmmmmm...a session of 20 GBP per hundred is in order david :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|chick: -3 undoubled unvul is not that bad|pg||
nt|dburn: apparently 2@s was spades and any other suit, and 3@s showed a maximum with spades and clubs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jackthelad: not for anyone with a weak constitution|pg||
pc|sT|nt|garnetts: Rolling the dice as North could lead to anything--even a slam making for EW --playing for money at green I would certainly try it|pg||
nt|chick: hehehee|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: i think undelead @c a reasonable|pg||

nt|justin c: Wonder what would happen of E put the @SQ on the first round?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|h_karluk: i think NS missed a chance|pg||

nt|jackthelad: not very friendly layout here|pg||
nt|chick: whoa, the dealer for today must have been on drugs|pg||
nt|justin c: South hand looks far too strong for 4@S to me|pg||
nt|dburn: as it is, it was far from clear for declarer to play for the drop anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 6@C, anyone?|pg||
nt|roswolf: how high will n/s go|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|h_karluk: so 3IMPs lost for NS when failed to set 1 more|pg||
nt|jackthelad: yep.....part score again...anything higher should be punished|pg||

nt|justin c: (quite a lot worse, truth to tell :) )|pg||
nt|roswolf: absolutely haven't we all|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|roswolf: 1.3% grands are my specialty|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not much wrong with 6@c that I can see - perfectly decent contract, and South does not have to worry about a heart lead through the @hAQ|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chick: terrible 1N overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jackthelad: prefer garbage stayman there|pg||
mb|5C|nt|h_karluk: off one|pg||
nt|garnetts: Why not 2@C and pass a major response or correct after 2@D--unless it would be forcing |pg||
nt|jackthelad: surprising lead|pg||
nt|justin c: would have thought 2@S for W, but i dont know the system they play|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like 2NT is artificial weakness showing bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not quite sure what all this means - 3@c may have been asking in clubs, but what 4@d was I don't know (perhaps keycard Blackwood, but...)|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|chick: without a club lead, this does have some hope|pg||

nt|yo_yo: in the OR  East preempted with 3@C and everyone passed|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|dburn: but to do that, you should cash @sK first, then ruff spades with the eight and king, not mess around leading low spades from dummy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: bloody bid|pg||

nt|dburn: unlikely result from the Open Room, but if South really did get out for down one in 4@h, he played it very well|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: multi from Ciara?|pg||
nt|chick: I want to know which dealing program was used for this session, it's like goulash :)|pg||
nt|dburn: 3NT = solid major|pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: @d A and a small @d would not set with careful timing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a good weak 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in their system|pg||
nt|jackthelad: making 4@s is a tad tricky....but 4@h rolls in|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: it doesnt look that great to me  but  i suppose there are worse |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: spades 2-2 , @d ace and @c K favorably placed|pg||
nt|garnetts: another 12 imps to Scotland after a verry poor piece of declarer play led to 4@S failing in this room--both the two swings could been avoided |pg||
nt|chick: EW will have two chances to attack S's entries|pg||
nt|chick: must knock out both before trumps are drawn to beat 4@H|pg||
nt|jackthelad: but cant touch 3NT|pg||
nt|chick: yep, that's the place to be|pg||
nt|jackthelad: as is pointed out...the unlikely @d lead beats it|pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|garnetts: nasty hand for North now--what would a double be I wonder  |pg||
nt|jackthelad: really tuff.....cant support..cant double|pg||
nt|dburn: another gadget imported from the lower regions of Hades by the demon Liggins|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think N hand deserves a cue bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: both hands are rather good|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but South has a lot of @H to deal with|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just draw 2 rounds trump and switch @d ten towards table|pg||
nt|garnetts: Poor east has had a rough ride--maybe feeling the pressure a bit--it can make you do silly things --I know been there and got the scars to prove it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yo_yo: and if it's ducked?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: you are at home with 12 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you can only ruff 2@H|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|c6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h4|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|justin c: in some circles of hell they just play acol|pg||
mc|9|nt|h_karluk: loser on loser there - in case ducked|pg||
nt|h_karluk: throw a heart at hand ans west endplayed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in that scenario|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *and - ans typo sorry|pg||

nt|vugraphzdu: Not too slow here - just the occasional board|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we dont like those :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|jackthelad: more action|pg||
nt|chick: spades will win, and could even make|pg||
nt|justin c: should take the @DA before playing a @H there, helps dec to get the @H wrong|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|jackthelad: more of the same.....dealer is uninspired today|pg||
nt|jackthelad: 11 trix for E/W|pg||
nt|dburn: the Open Room seems to have been rotated through ninety degrees - North probably did not go down one in 3@s there|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: S is checking the backs of his cards to see if the same deck as partner |pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: a tad perplexed it seems|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jackthelad: W will act|pg||
nt|chick: W is Vul, 7 HCP, and may think partner has spade stack|pg||
nt|dburn: but there was some confusion at the start of this match regarding the boards, and perhaps that has not been entirely cleared up|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i would begin with a heart |pg||
nt|chick: I would pass quietly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: I would have fancied 4NT by either e or w|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: really?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 10 cards in M suits and a void|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that goes against the grain here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he will show his shape first|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: @c AJT tempting|pg||
nt|garnetts: why bid 1@H?|pg||
nt|justin c: dont like the looks of 6@H here|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jackthelad: but all credit to the ballsy 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i think uncontested 1@h>2@d ; 2@s etc would also work well|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now South has a difficult bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say 3@c fsf appeared, still 3@s ok|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fsf = 4th suit forcing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i believe in that way South will easily would make better guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if south bids 3NT his partner might be short in @C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5-5 in M so not hard to guess rest possibilities|pg||
nt|jackthelad: put off a @h lead ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: North has just mentioned he has that suit --and I would have thought ti showed five clubs too|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: God bless all commentators of BBO - what a busy day since 06.00 am USA EST|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|garnetts: The 1@H bid has led to a 1NT contract  which after this lead renders the west hand of little value--2@D is much better|pg||
mc|10|nt|chick: too late now for the @D trick|pg||
pg||
qx|c30|st||md|4SQ7432H72DAJ4CAT4,SHQJT983DQT85C976,ST985HK54DK62CKQ3,SAKJ6HA6D973CJ852|sv|o|nt|jackthelad: Dave and Brian have a 4 ball on Monday mornings with Les and myself.....the topics will be interesting :)|pg||
nt|jackthelad: Slime is on a roll today...wont hear the end of it :)|pg||
nt|chick: hehehee  luck does play a part in this game|pg||
nt|justin c: definitely the best play|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|yo_yo: This is Blue Club |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H!|nt|garnetts: 6@H is a fair contract here--but 6@C might be better on paper--hard to bid either and both might go off on the club suit split |pg||
nt|garnetts: 2nt LLOKS BEST TO ME |pg||
nt|jackthelad: my guess is that they will subside into 3nt....but |pg||
nt|garnetts: looks even |pg||
nt|dburn: this seems to be back to normal|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jackthelad: Murphy's law of the unbalanced 2nt is that partner will always have your short suit|pg||
nt|justin c: dont like the looks of 6@H here either|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 2@H shows a 4 card major|pg||
nt|justin c: cant ruff a @C without losing a trump trick|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: my syberian husky running for a record, again tangled up to another tree :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|yo_yo: and 2@S asks which it is|pg||
nt|h_karluk: back to game - - good auction but some misfit layout|pg||
nt|yo_yo: dont they pull sledges?  |pg||
nt|justin c: dont know the details of the bidding methods|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|chick: Ian, do you like the first double?   I would bid 1@S|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|justin c: but it looks better to me if north can show diamonds and get south to evaluate|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: i wonder why they just cant bid the major they have, would save a lot of time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mine german shepherd and syberian husky breed|pg||
nt|justin c: this @D switch not best|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jackthelad: would have been tempted to use puppet there...just in case !|pg||
nt|jackthelad: now this is in the lap of the Gods, and Brian was wishing that he HAD opened 2NT :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jackthelad: I like 1@s|pg||
pc|c6|nt|garnetts: the jack of hearts dropping might lead to defeat by play a club to the queen |pg||
nt|garnetts: in 6NT I mean|pg||
pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: likely a flat result unless a big slip on defense|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a cunning duck, hoping they continue @D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely South knows the count in @D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: aiming to cut connection on defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far not bad foresight|pg||
nt|yo_yo: still he has a difficult lead back|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but the real problem is about own communication between hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes, there is none :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and to find safe discards|pg||
nt|jackthelad: 10 trix...next|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jackthelad: Dave has obviously fallen in @h with this pile....BRAKES coming|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: David unsure about what the 4 diamonds is and has taken 3 goes at his final bid of 4 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Brian now in a brown study|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|Walddk1: Good morning to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2NT opening are awlays difficult starts to an auction when borderline slams are possible --South did well with 4@C |pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hi Joe|pg||
nt|santyclz: 0640 here, wake me if something happens.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: certainly it wasn't, and I am not sure what prompted it, but perhaps West could see that South might eventually throw a diamond loser on @hK|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|justin c: he was concerned that a @D loser could go on the @HK i think|pg||
mc|8|nt|h_karluk: say there were an entry to table then 3-3 @c (35.6 pct) wld be helpful|pg||
nt|justin c: the trick appears to have been returned|pg||
pg||

nt|garnetts: North mistimed it anyway |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|jackthelad: 4@h is a bit pushy on these values|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|jackthelad: summat wrong here :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I thought for a moment here we were watching Kiwi bridge.|pg||
nt|jackthelad: but 4@s looks fairly decent :)|pg||
nt|jackthelad: still Woolsey...@s and a minor|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|dburn: well, declarer played a spade to the queen because West might have had the singleton jack, so no great harm was done|pg||
nt|justin c: strong @C, neg @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: think north bid stayman here, planning to pass the reply|pg||

nt|justin c: this is unlucky|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jackthelad: I agree...@s suit is good and the void in @d...sorry pard, I like mine better|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is to coin a phrase remembered this week by the death of Michael Foot the longest suicide note in history |pg||

nt|justin c: 4@H at the other table...|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: you could be a single unmarried grandmother|pg||

nt|santyclz: Matches open room auction so far.  I guess it wasn't as crazy as it first seemed.|pg||
