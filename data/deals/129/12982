nt|patricck: yes, hard to bid tho, because there are only 21 points and only a little distribution, but quite a good contract, needs a 3-2 trump break, but might not need the K@D onside - ...|pg||
nt|patricck: discards on @C possibly|pg||

nt|xenya: note the @CA lead -- normal tactics against the gambling 3N to cash an ace first in the hope to get a few quick tricks|pg||
nt|babydolldk: Pharmaservice is only leading by 10½ imps|pg||
nt|patricck: If the defence is on the ball needs 3-2 trums and K@D  a 34% chance. If the defence don't get to attack diamonds then only needs the trumps which is 68%|pg||
nt|rnmalik: everything working for declarer|pg||
nt|patricck: so how good the game is depends on how good the defence is|pg||

mc|10|nt|mdgraham: was thinking..lead the @D3...ten, ace then maybe six towards dummy - if S plays low, N wins Q and has to concede a ruff-sluff, if the hand had been eliminated. Not possible now of ...|pg||

nt|vahaboglu: Bülent güneyin antresinin ne olduðunu mu düþünüyor|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: ne fark eder ne ise ortaðý ona geçer zaten|pg||
nt|patricck: bidding this game with such poor trumps had one other drawback..If the trumps are 4-1 and you are going down then somebody will be looking at a good enough trump stack to double|pg||

nt|patricck: well, the other one was a precision club and 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|cicus: do NS play precision?|pg||
nt|patricck: I presumed so from the first 2 bids on board 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|an|asking info|nt|hedyg: so he put his eggs into the 3-3 @hs with Q on side basket|pg||

nt|hedyg: i remember my 1st ever teamgame competition i was told: never double a partial except if you have enough SURE tricks to beat it in your hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: such as opps playing 3 M and you have AKQJ10 in the suit was the example i was given|pg||
nt|gulyas: slam only goes down cos of the 4-0 trumps in fact|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps a little extreme but sound enough principle|pg||
nt|sharkey: Krøjgaard upgrades with the playing strength|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easily 800|pg||
nt|cicus: thx for the help|pg||
nt|patricck: Nusine? Is that an acronym for something? or a place name?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: i suppose we don't know the systems here?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hedyg: just a little extreme :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4-0 trumps is not enough to beatthe slam, also spades must be 5-1|pg||
nt|csabi: and if they go down in 6@C they still win 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|gulyas: makes no diff, u lose a @D and a trump (discard 4th @H on the @SK at end)|pg||
nt|yusufb: günaydýn herkese|pg||
nt|babydolldk: 2@C a kind of reverse drury|pg||
nt|xenya: probably 2@C was sort of relay (GF?) and 2@D showed a minimum hand|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm told EW play reverse drury over major-suit openings in all positions|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East was ready|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ok that N have 15HP and 4-3 in the unbidded colors. But are E or W limited?|pg||
nt|cicus: I have never been to Denmark|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: does W hand qualify for reverse?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: yes fielders choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if spades wre not 5-1 it would be an easy make with correct single-dummy handling of trump suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: why would they go to 6@c when N passed twice first?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Peter's 2@D timid a little I think....|pg||

nt|gulyas: he saw the fit, they are unlikely to x him|pg||
nt|hedyg: on 5 cards with a balanced weak hand|pg||

nt|rnmalik: positive|pg||
nt|rodal f: Insteed it ended +1 at 4@C. Would not have done at 5.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: There was no way out|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2@H plays very well here -- perhaps the defence dropped a trick somewhere though|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: leaddir bid|pg||
nt|csabi: was szalay's bid a fit non-jump supporting spades?|pg||

mb|1C|nt|gulyas: what spades|pg||

nt|tokay1975: 6nt yapm,s iyi sp cýkýlmassa squize oynarsa  oluyo|pg||
nt|xenya: now for more serious things...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Last hand actually played itself as W needed to find @CQJ bare in N hand to make the contract|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here we have a fair 4 @S|pg||
mb|1D|nt|csabi: ah, Hegedûs's wife has just explained|pg||
nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|csabi: 3@C contains the 0-7 too|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: really!!!|pg||
nt|tokay1975: defansta  spi teklemek yerine hlerni atmýs kararda kalmamis  oynayana|pg||
mb|d!|nt|sharkey: 1@S showing 5 card suit?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gambit: looks like 8 or 9 tricks should be routine |pg||

nt|rodal f: 2@C is? Matias.|pg||
nt|cicus: game on a finesse for EW|pg||

mb|4H|nt|hedyg: 4@c 2suiter?|pg||
nt|csabi: (and the 6-9)|pg||

nt|sharkey: NS playing weak NT as well I think|pg||
mb|4S|nt|harmon: Hedy!!!|pg||

nt|yusufb: mrb tekrar|pg||
nt|xenya: ah i was waiting for that|pg||
nt|babydolldk: 6@D is on:)|pg||
nt|xenya: EW can make 5 in either minor (actually they can make 6 but they'd better not bid that)|pg||
nt|xenya: but if S bids 5@S now -- quite reasonablle at these colours -- what is W to do?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|yusufb: slm nafiz abi hoþgeldin|pg||
nt|gambit: Will N play 10@d trick 2?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. And 9 if N tell all his minor honors.|pg||
nt|gambit: Not likely....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT played by W also would make but who will bid it on such values|pg||
nt|cicus: my guess is NS will save in 5%H|pg||
nt|cicus: 5@H|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w maybe just swinging because of ttheir poor set thus far|pg||
nt|begse: bu konuþma artifisyel|pg||

nt|csabi: sure|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT might be easier|pg||
pc|s9|nt|harmon: not so double dummy on bidding|pg||
nt|csabi: eliminate black suits and lead a trump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: throw in on South|pg||
nt|hedyg: now @c and endplay on S looming if Szalay doesnt play @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps even single dummy after north/s bid declarer must surely have great clues as to the layout|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes even on @d return he makes it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
nt|yusufb: @h kup var|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-lead would have been better - for the defense|pg||
nt|rodal f: That lead, when S show the @S, tell the rest of the story by honors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y Hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hans I ment|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But still @H Ace and the 10 from South, and a small @H, small from North and declarer might get an idea - which will NOT work|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: 1100 was push|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or a small @C from W and can't fail.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|begse: batmasý için 3 karo vermesi lazým|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some will be happy and other disepointed at that push:)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: tricks at NT u can make 10, so there is safety at the 4 level  (d) S would have been endplayed into bidding 3N on many hands|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: when north ducks what next?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Could bring 1 IMP for Schaltz|pg||
nt|rodal f: 6@C or 5@S from W|pg||
nt|pelu: not so easy - 51S = 2 xA + @SQ or 6@C = 2 xA + void in @C??|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: lots of work to do|pg||
nt|sharkey: But since West's stiff @S is the 9 shud be ok I think|pg||
nt|babydolldk: yes it's a friendly layout|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even on @C lead N does not have a @C to play 2nd time=so it makes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South shall lead against 6 @C...|pg||
nt|pelu: ?? Hans|pg||
nt|rodal f: And then we are back to my start. Waisted cards, seen from Dorte's side|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: get some imps back|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: though  either defender can make declarer guess by leading an honor on the first round|pg||
nt|cicus: I think it was ill-advised. where are the spades? if with partner, he must be weak|pg||
nt|patricck: I don't like the raise to 4@S...  partner should have some leeway with transfers over 2NT and the fact that partner didn't bid 4@S himself must reduce the chances of getting a good ...|pg||
nt|patricck: enough hand to make|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Rush of blood:) more than logic|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: here declarer did the logical thing, hoping D king an entry|pg||

nt|rodal f: Peter for shure feel that some IMPs are needed and shot the gold bird this time.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|patricck: Both South and North took questionable actions......who do we give the most blame to?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|marlowepi: sooner or later NS will have to break clubs, and they need to start by leading an honor|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer has another entry but not very useful|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W should not be fooled though, given the NS silence, with N known to have S Kxxxx and D ace and heart queen, |pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
nt|marlowepi: while S would likely have balanced with club KQ and H QJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS play multilandy and he didnt bid 2@s so basically should not be 5-4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry AJ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|babydolldk: no, I don't think so, the clubs are a problem..|pg||

pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  Next board looks exciting (also)|pg||
nt|pelu: strange thatdennis Bilde discard a 1H - he know from the bidding that decl is void in @C|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: he should be content with down one once spades were 5-1 and D king was not an entry|pg||
