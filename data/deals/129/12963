nt|jallerton: an earlier @d might break the communications|pg||
nt|ady: 20 pts each|pg||
nt|roswolf: SAFETY MAY COST AN IMP|pg||

nt|justin c: but 50-50|pg||
nt|roswolf: in some strong club systems|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 2D forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|chick: 2@H shows a minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: if north bids nt at any point south will raise to 3 when the defence will make hay|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|jallerton: a matter of partnership style whether East should bid 1@s or raise to 2@h|pg||
nt|justin c: declarer could make quite a bit of hay himself if east tries a heart lead|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|justin c: kibs asking about 4@S NS|pg||
nt|justin c: dec has 10 winners|pg||
pc|s2|nt|justin c: but the defence take two hearts and a club then force south to ruff|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: East will pre-empt over North|pg||
mb|d|nt|jallerton: though West might intervene|pg||
mb|4S|nt|justin c: 4@H here I imagine|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@H or3NT is the choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: now too high|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 5D is missing three aces and four hearts can be beaten with a ruff|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: This gives the free option of a double|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: but only one off|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: who is leading this event overall?|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|pc|sQ|nt|ady: difficult to blame east   2NT strong invote with 4 spades   but a simple cu at 2 level would have worked out better|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, I prefer to use 2@h as a good 4-card raise (2@c would be a good 3-card raise)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ireland on completed matches by 1 vp|pg||

mb|2S|nt|roswolf: 1nt is a little obscure|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: It will surprise Dafydd when south runs to spades!|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: a @S lead against 3NT would remove the entry to the @D suit|pg||

nt|chick: no need, W has rescued them|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: lack of aces is a problem for declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed justin|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west  satisfied with game    diamonds are a a bit wesk to look for more|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: if the first X were for penalty, the 2nd one would certainly also be|pg||
pc|dA|nt|justin c: somebody should put a red card on this|pg||
nt|petepunt: East may have been better passing and picking them up in 100's here|pg||
nt|chick: my thought also, Pete|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: quite a few play the same method as they do over a weak notrump, namely takeout doubles of any rescue|pg||

nt|athene: 3@D opener in the open room on board 29 showed a pre-empt in either major|pg||
nt|petepunt: another slam !|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and south naturally enough assumed it was hearts|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jallerton: 6@c and 6@h both possible contracts here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: which led to the unusual spectacle of an 8-5 spade fit being lost|pg||
nt|justin c: the method seems rather prone to that|pg||
nt|justin c: the better your fit is, the less likely you are to believe you have it|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed the method is sub -optimal and prone to give up large minus swings|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree justin|pg||
nt|petepunt: will need care with @C posotion in 6@H|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ady: england extend lead   got 11 imps on hand 11 when ireland went down 2 in 4 hearts and england played 3NT making 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s control showing: an ace and a king, or three kings|pg||
nt|jallerton: presumably South can just bid 4@h now|pg||
nt|petepunt: may ruff 3@D in South and rev dummy|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|justin c: goig to be close|pg||
nt|justin c: @HA and another?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Does 4@C agree @h?  Maybe it does, as South could have responded 2NT to show "any 6-card suit"|pg||
nt|roswolf: this also looks crazy bidding by the english but if you live by the sword occasionally you die by it|pg||
nt|chick: wonder what they play 5@S to show|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|ady: 5@S?|pg||
nt|ady: Ireland got 12 imps back on hand 12   found 4@H  when england went down in 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: S believes 4n agreed clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: but you can also triumph|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: oh, never mind, @H is trump, not spades :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: think it needs a @D lead let through|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|jallerton: to make 6@c he'll need to start with the Q from hand, then take another finesse on the 2nd round|pg||
nt|justin c: this would be a good time to play trumps|pg||

nt|petepunt: may lack 1 entry for dummy rev|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes -2 but -1 dd before that card|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|h5|nt|jallerton: but stiff 4 and stiff 5 in West twice as likely|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ady: another mis fit|pg||
nt|jallerton: England did well to stop in 2@s in other room|pg||
nt|justin c: if your mental equilibrium is of value to you, do not look at the auction in the other room|pg||
nt|petepunt: 1n is 15-17 on 3rd pos vuln, hence 1@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: a very conservative contract, especially vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Crouch/Patterson play a strong @c system, so West was able to show a distributional hand without huge strength|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petepunt: 2N is 11-poor 14 i suspect|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: 1@H    1NT    2@S   all pass in OR|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: yes a little surreal|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petepunt: worth considering using 2@D as 8-10 with 3@H by a passed hand. :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: fav lie of cards here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jallerton: playing Acol, perhaps West should content himself with 2@h over 1NT|pg||
nt|justin c: my 'mature' judgment sees five @H and five @C for dec |pg||
nt|roswolf: ah but in which order?|pg||
nt|justin c: unless of course he goes and ruffs the third @D high, but I dont think he will do that|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
