nt|ady: likely slam for n/s to start|pg||
nt|ady: only danger is they get to a grand and fail|pg||
nt|ady: maybe an old hand  |pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: hello cornelia|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not much here for either side|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still might land in 3N|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 nt NS best|pg||
nt|Gerben42: will you bid stayman over 1N? then they play 2@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no I pass gladly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does it mean?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and i've been trying alt0222 |pg||
nt|yo_yo: nothing happens|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no idea what Roland meant|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W could find a thin spade game here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To get the  Þ|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/russia/gromov-dubinin.pdf  for EW's CC. Precision it is|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Rashed and Ralf :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Hedy!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi Hedy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No CC for N-S as they are not regular partners. 2/1 is the general approach|pg||
nt|hedyg: both 3NT and 5@c for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Notrump range a bit uncertain|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
nt|sharkey: We're back|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: hello|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello and welcome all|pg||
nt|pelu: 25 HCP - but 3Nt need @D 4-4 (or blocade) and @SK in S + @CQ drop - not a god chance, bit here all work|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: Get a chat line and press Alt0222|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: My name is Gudni and I´ll be your operator to day in closed room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S sharp but can|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hello and 4@S EW makes only 3 losers|pg||
nt|sharkey: starting with a tie hand - 20 points a side|pg||
nt|jtr: Hello people|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hello Ivan and welcome all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@C  16+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So, the Hackett twins, Justin and Jason, EW|pg||
nt|Geofspa: I see that now :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: nothing|pg||
nt|granguru: in effect Zia itself is here |pg||
nt|jtr: Welland opened a worse hand in this position last match|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hi Rashed & Ivan|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Ivan, Peter and Ralf,  and our valued specs welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm  for standings and running scores|pg||
nt|hedyg: W needs to show 8+ hcps now and also @s stopper|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Gerben42: i think with expected 22 HCP or so, you should take your plus|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam in diamonds is makeable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi rashed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: asks minor|pg||
nt|jtr: I thought this might be thrown in|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Carl,Ivan|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi David|pg||
nt|chick: Hello|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello and welcome back|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what so special about this one, NS have really destroyed the opposition|pg||
nt|sharkey: Need a @S lead to set 3 NT I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: X= majors|pg||
nt|pelu: how do u play 3Nt on a 1@s-lead - I exp u to go down - need to play @C now and take the finess|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: a somewhat attenuated 1@D opening, but has an easy rebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: support double, by the look of it - showing three-card spade support|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true but biddable?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Downgraded to 7 hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yeah, we all do :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mmmakela: absolutely no reason to bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi rashed  and Gudni|pg||
nt|mdgraham: playing that, a raise to 2@S would show four-card support.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: well west has to show them now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Double is takeout of spades|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mmmakela: good lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has East done enough?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from a snowy Manchester|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pointwise it is 21 vs 19|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm  for standings|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess he will raise|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes difficult because you cannot test A@c and then go to dummy to finesse @c if Q didnt drop and no more entry to dummy to make the @cs|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Qx is never my favourite holding (unless in trumps)|pg||
nt|pelu: now for sure EW will not bid 3NT - and not give a score to NS|pg||
nt|hedyg: what was 2@d?|pg||
nt|po-s: hard to bid 4 spades now?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps a help for EW to enter the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW 4-card majors, frequent light openings. 1NT 14-16 in 1st and 2nd, 15-17 in 3rd and 4th|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vinbtech: helo and wc to all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that bidding correct gudni?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello  vinay|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: yes there are misunderstanding at the table |pg||
nt|roswolf: welland +zia wont sit quietly|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Its different when you are leading|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|sharkey: Resukts and standings: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ideal hand for it after his initial pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Dubinin awkwardly placed now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But if Zia supports @d there is no solution but a stiff @cQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: but is 2@d a natural bid?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NS 2/1|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: spade contracts played by east arent so threatened by a club lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Keep Alt down with your left hand while you type  0222 with your right hand. It's not difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bullets nice suit poor and stuffingh non exiastent 2s was a free bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i/ve tried that 15 times|pg||
nt|vinbtech: likely 3n interpreted as both majors !|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Cornelia:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think I can find a CC for EW. They play modified Polish Club. One moment|pg||
nt|hedyg: why would he bid 2@d with 4 cards when Zia asked for majors?|pg||
nt|pelu: S could still be 4-3-4-2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Natural with fit for a major is my guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He is a passed hand after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3s would be an overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome Martim|pg||
nt|jaapfr: difficult word Mike but got what you meant about 1@D:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Trump lead best|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zmudzinski-Witel are placed 14th of 16 - shows the quality of this field|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like 4@H may have a play...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Have to guess a little...|pg||
nt|jtr: Pretty routine this one|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|jaapfr: has to agree seeing first 9 sessions|pg||
nt|hedyg: better pass now|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4 is too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i never heard of that |pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are very friendly for 4@H and 3NT for NS|pg||
nt|sharkey: some may not open N hand....|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess East has shown hs shape and West will be interested facing a single @d|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11 tricks in @H and 10 or 11 in NT|pg||
nt|jtr: although 3NT maybe also shows a minimum (seems to use up a lot of space)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Standings - http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r7.htm|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes but a better contract, makeable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re|pg||
nt|chick: with that lead, making 10-11 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@c smells like a singleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: will that make him play A@s and @s?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Jaap the computer has started working but slightly tough:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/germany/piekarek-smirnov.pdf|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on the lay out 4@H not a bad contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sry, Private, |pg||
nt|po-s: I guess 2NT is a good raise to 3H...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vinbtech: y a lucky break|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 3@H bid interfered nicely with the e/w auction|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@C vuln safe -1 is a good result but unbiddable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although 3nt and 5@C fine too|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Carl|pg||
nt|sharkey: *Results|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets assume he got in his lead-director with 2@d in case opps played|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Gerben42: dont want to lead from honors behind the big NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: and this is mps not right to push for dodgy games|pg||
nt|sybarra2: *Martin|pg||
nt|jaapfr: indeed 6@S DD and unbeatable DD|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - Zmud looking for slam?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure what 2NT is supposed to mean, PO seems to know|pg||
nt|po-s: Know is too much|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Sensible decision by E/W|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make -- particularly after W's overcall|pg||
nt|rnmalik: by X showed 5M and 4 major, is that it|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i meant E"s overcall|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was quite aggressive since it's likely to be only a 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|granguru: It has some merits...some|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@c KC probably|pg||
nt|sharkey: give up 3 @H tricks perhaps|pg||
nt|po-s: believe intended to via a later correction if partner bids 3 of a minor|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 300 is fine compensation as 3NT is dodgy at best|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rnmalik: agree but cards are very friendly here|pg||
nt|athene: west judges that he has enough entries to his hand (trumps and @HK) that the defence can't kill them all before the clubs are up and running|pg||
nt|po-s: what about a small club?|pg||
nt|jtr: No, not Gerber!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: allergy:)?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Key card for clubs|pg||
nt|paulhac:  quiet start for sure|pg||
nt|jtr: I will go for 11|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|granguru: giving a lead..f.i.|pg||
nt|granguru: opps may err Q-A position|pg||
nt|jtr: Why is he thinking?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Of all the conventions which most top players dislike Gerber is No 1|pg||
nt|sharkey: Everyone's thinking today David...|pg||
nt|chick: certainly the best play given the lie, but will he play for KJx offside when E is looking for a ruff?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S is a sound diamond raise|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yo_yo: it's teams|pg||
nt|jtr: He played rather quickly to trick one|pg||
nt|sharkey: Flannery  2?|pg||
nt|jtr: The play will be quicker than the bidding|pg||
nt|jtr: One hopes........|pg||
nt|jaapfr: claim 11 in tr 3?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia still has to lead...|pg||
nt|jtr: @s probably|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re|pg||
nt|rnmalik: po would you bid 4@H in W|pg||
nt|po-s: nah... A passed partner?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2nt looks easy, but 4@h? I doubt it with @h 3-1|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: martens says " I'm the winner !"|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: What makes you think  TEAMS  is  MP?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: So it follows that Zia is pushing the boat out bidding 3@S with only three spades, but it has pushed EW to 4@H, where there should be four losers  |pg||
nt|jaapfr: not much chance to make this|pg||
nt|jtr: Mere mortals lead the @dJ:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and duck too K for 12 tr:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y  but now down SD logic but DD we all would make:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Jaap|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I agree|pg||
nt|rnmalik: non vul and undbled.|pg||
nt|po-s: for a moment there I thought they would manage to stop in four|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yo_yo: very lucky for North South|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh duck this even|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but N should know E short in @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont think makeable now|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@H and @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c was on a major squeeze i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You have 2@S available for that purpose as it can't be natural after the 1NT response|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@H+1@D+1@C=3|pg||
nt|athene: yes, a small club from north might work a treat|pg||
nt|jtr: God knows what his plan is|pg||
nt|jtr: why no @d finesse there?|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi rashed|pg||
nt|jtr: Phew:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcarroll: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|rnmalik: look good 11|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: oh u sure it bwa pairs last time i commentated yesterday|pg||
nt|lestergold: even tho it said imps are u sure Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: tomorrow is another day :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mike, it's all in your e-mail|pg||
nt|sharkey: Take @CA and dump a @S?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Sometimes David we do agree:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi jaap|pg||
pc|dT|nt|po-s: nine will force kng, hen all over|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might draw all the trumps and finesse clubs|pg||
nt|po-s: small club may result in trump drawing and club finesse!!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 8@H very vital card in E|pg||
nt|chick: scary :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: or not..N could stop last @s|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but sequence have no knowledge|pg||
nt|jtr: Wise to take that|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1 now|pg||
nt|hedyg: claiming -1?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for most mortals the 4@S bid too aggressive|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia-Welland use 12-14 NT nv?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: http://reykjavikbridgefestival.com/index.php?m=E1&id=M_TEAMS2010&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2010&m=D3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sometimes I wish people would read what I write|pg||
nt|lestergold: in my dotage i forget what i read two days ago u know that roland|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sharkey: may make this...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm  for standings|pg||
nt|po-s: I think 4H is made|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Justin might have Qxx in diamonds so Jason will be reluctant to exit with a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D could be 3|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|vinbtech: but 3N should also make w/ 4 each in red suit and 1 black suit K at least|pg||
nt|jaapfr: is this a female pair EW?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: appears to be -2|pg||
nt|pelu: the 2@S from S help the defense, but what would u lead after 1Nt - 3 NT - prob also a @s|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - A simple 3 NT by Zia may have been more effective here - science gave opps the chance|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree and transfer to @C has now become a hurdle in making 3NT|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be a @H lead - "longest & strongest(?)"|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: So take notes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like that when i get it right|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: N alert 3nt and say it is 5-5 major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looks as if the culprit is South  ( forgetting system)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: that explains it ! not 4-4 as i hazarded but 55|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then Zia has been pushing the boat out for years, and it does not seem to have done huim any  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: ...him any harm|pg||
nt|po-s: after a high spade easy|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Gerben42: will just scratch home|pg||
nt|chick: just cashing out for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: rise with the king, hurray|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate i think that 2s is quite enough on the east hand tatcics at imps are not to bid dodgy games non vul|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It looks like the defence will grab 5 tricks, then declarer 2 or 3, then the defence another - and Declarer gets the rest - 1NT making|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok 12 claim in tr 6|pg||
nt|chick: why does that matter?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: thoughtful play, @D from hand|pg||
nt|xenya: Welcome to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|xenya: but the @SK was not so good |pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @HJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi |pg||
nt|athene: these hands are always tricky, both to play and defend|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, i think East will overfuff the 3rd @c and play trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The results of rounds in IMPs will be converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. In calculating the datum score (= average score) on each board, about 50% (but not more) of the scores (a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: quarter from the top and a quarter from the bottom) will not be taken into account|pg||
nt|jtr: 4th @c|pg||
nt|granguru: so how many are taken into account?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: of course the bidding and the layout lucky in some ways so ten tricks made|pg||
nt|rnmalik: someone surely did:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry i have no link to running scores   who has?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nor me, sorry|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: what a unmakeable hand:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome to Moscow|pg||
nt|Walddk4: with me are Peter Lund and Rashed Nabi Malik|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r1.htm  for results|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: declarer wants to leave dummy's trumps to control diamonds whilst he gets the clubs set up|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that´s a point P-O|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm  for standings after round 12|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jaapfr: realistic finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: still he will manage to survive?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he was sure E to have1 @H max 2 min 0:)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: it's really annoying when partner forgets the system  |pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes he will make it|pg||
nt|paulhac:  if he ruffs with the Q@S and plays the 10@S back?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even then makes it|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wins the T in hand and small @S to J|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even hen:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok but DD easier than SD:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pitches the T @H on Q@D that is if E ruffs with Q@S and plays T@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @C away as specs suggest does not help defense|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: welland made a claim|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he is brite|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: TD called|pg||
nt|jaapfr: claim is correct|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe just a little bit premature|pg||
nt|athene: the defence try to disrupt this of course|pg||
nt|peterh: slopped a few tricks |pg||
pc|c4|pg||

nt|Walddk4: You can click on Round Number (1) for results for each board in Round 1 - website design by Anton Osipov. |pg||

nt|Gerben42: been in worse slams - 6@D |pg||
nt|mmmakela: here red slams|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think partner would be surprised that you had 2 aces|pg||
nt|jtr: And it speeds things up|pg||
nt|sharkey: Another 3 NT coming up?|pg||
nt|pelu: 3 NT again? - and down again?|pg||
nt|po-s: but they can´t lose parts of their lead at the rate from round 12...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree that was bad for them|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I guess some will make 3NT|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: yes it is max for the bid but it falls between stools its not really a 3S bid unless your methods can allow you to expres these values more accurately|pg||
nt|rnmalik: if that is a system then it is strange-one might get a hand in 200 deals where responder to 2NT has 5/5 majors|pg||
nt|xenya: oh he can of course|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt from zia i assume|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|jaapfr: again 4@S-1?|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@s has problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: anyway that alt0222 doesnt work with my keyboard|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i agree Rashed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so the 1@D opening pays dividends|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think 9 out of 4@H plays was down 1|pg||
nt|po-s: on the result page you can translate via Google (upper right corner)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 9 out of 10|pg||
nt|jtr: Nothing makes here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will they beat 4@H (we must assume Zia will:)|pg||
nt|jtr: I think North will be on lead|pg||
nt|jtr: At this table anyway|pg||
nt|paulhac:  On a good day 4@H would make|pg||
nt|sharkey: W may bid 2 NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if played by E much more chance:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can look it up here ....|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Gerben42: 6@S has issues with the trump distribution|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi and welcome|pg||
nt|athene: now 4@S looks likely although it's just about possible north might go for 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: there are certainly hands where 3nt is better but it's a swingy view to take|pg||
nt|jtr: But maybe not so many by East|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@H |pg||
nt|pelu: there are a misscoring on board 95 - scored that EW maded 8 tricks in 1 Nt, but they maded only 4 = 6 VP more for Welland - Zia|pg||
nt|po-s: or drop... - knowing them|pg||
nt|paulhac:  They had the points for it and against natural bidding N/S are unlikely yo get into the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 6 spades needs guessing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the youngsters tend to remember these things.  Are NS youngsters?|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@s|pg||
nt|jtr: surely|pg||
nt|rnmalik: partial available all round|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and W 6@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Looks like a normal 3NT and it can be made even on the annoying heart lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jtr: oh|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6 or 7 that is the question, cards placed in friendly position|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT 2 places to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: now simple 3nt+2 or so so coffee break|pg||
nt|jtr: Not that it will matter|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like it - 4333 doesnt add value...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3NT is easy with clubs breaking|pg||
nt|paulhac:  They are in the only making game but can they stay there|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vinbtech: one of them is surely NOT  he FORGOT ! lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will he pass???|pg||
nt|sharkey: Welland may push Vul...|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@S I bet|pg||
nt|sharkey: If invitational|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and 3@S would make|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Welcome to Ralf|pg||
nt|sharkey: Welland stayed away from @H lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good morning from Sweden!|pg||
nt|pelu: strange to lead minor when decl has max 3-3 in major|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Peter. follow your rule and lead a @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/y8rdsoc  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@H you cant bid - how would you find out about @HJ|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT? 12-14 or 15-17?|pg||
nt|jtr: Nicely organised as it happens|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S lead or @CA not easy|pg||
nt|jtr: @cA possible|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Whats the betting Zia leads a diamond|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why wud W want the lead into East's hand? Peeked?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Not so easy |pg||
nt|chick: 4@C presumably shows 5-5 majors|pg||
nt|jtr: although it doesnt look good|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s lead is needed to break 5@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D the likely stop unless Zia comes in the balancing seat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And he certainly will not come in now that Justin has shown hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 2@C could be either natural or strong (Gazilli)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: iceland you have a wonderful bridge site with great photos|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i bet that this makes|pg||
nt|jtr: Well done Paul:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I do not think this will be as quick as the last hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Awful communications too|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Difficult to see a winning line|pg||
nt|jtr: There is a reason for the difficulty:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
nt|chick: sometimes there isn't one :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Unless opponents help|pg||
nt|rnmalik: opps can't help either:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: much stronger bid than just 5@H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: needs some play to make it-3NT but 9@C very important card|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: so can they locate 4-4 dias|pg||
nt|roswolf: one tip about playing against zia was that if he didnt bid you should assume a bal hand of less than 7/8 hcp!! true on this hand|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that isn't clear - he may be doing that as his only slam try in hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi David|pg||
nt|chick: a slam try in any suit is fine with S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@S bid now most likely or fearing an opps grand?|pg||
nt|hedyg: then why didnt Zia bid 5@s?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting agreement|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, I was wrong again|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yo_yo: but no names |pg||
nt|rnmalik: it also meand that with 3 cards of a major the contract would be 4 of that major|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Will EW talk NS out of their @H game?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@S could even go for 500|pg||
nt|roswolf: this also applies to all very aggressive players|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2 NT some kind of relay I presume|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you win|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: because he does not have all that much for his original double, after all|pg||
nt|hedyg: on his way to 6@h|pg||
nt|chick: good question, maybe he should :)|pg||
nt|bucheister: how could he have gone down three; he had the rest of the tricks for down one?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: trump lead or heart lead and trump switch will leave declarer a trick short here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like to see the participants photos|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW can make 9 tricks as the cards are placed|pg||
nt|pelu: 15-17 I see :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: an upgraded 15-17|pg||
nt|mdgraham: big view to pass though. |pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|roswolf: can be sometimes a valuable inference in the play|pg||
nt|jtr: Kx@s and xx@h with South looks the best option|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also 5@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: is it easier from N?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Zia needs to find a spade very tough|pg||
nt|pelu: Welland has 2 sure trick - will he take @sA?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Let's face it, it's not easy|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: yes i know|pg||
nt|pelu: in on @CQ NS has to take the 4 @S-tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry private|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C play would determine the fate of the contract after this lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, please delete the  h  in Kwiecien|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi Peter, Vladinir|pg||
nt|rnmalik: vladimir-sorry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose a pair of loonies might, but NS are definitely not that|pg||
nt|athene: Jxxx is a horrible lead, but all west's lead choices were horrible :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Zia will be delighted with the lead|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told it's actually against the rules to lead from Jxxx in Sweden|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting even if your P has bid the suit|pg||
nt|po-s: no, no, not when it is right|pg||
nt|athene: EW play 4th best leads i guess?|pg||
nt|athene: so east knows zia has five hearts|pg||
nt|paulhac:  East is thinking about whether his partner could have the K@S in which case dummy could be dead or whether he needs to win and switch|pg||
nt|sharkey: Key here is for defence to stay passive and this should fail|pg||
nt|pelu: that would be my lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I wonder if he got the right explanation, or if he asked at all|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: now 6 top losers|pg||
nt|athene: his problem is, if he takes the @HA right away and switches, that sets up the @HQ as an entry|pg||
nt|sharkey: View the bonus for game Vul players tend to stretch.  Experts will bid games when the chance of success is no more than 37-38% due to the game bonus available|pg||
nt|chick: I"m told that in Russia names ending in eva or ova always indicate a woman|pg||
nt|sharkey: Results: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I take it  a good lead losing nothing leadind @H would have give away a trick|pg||
nt|sharkey: As Peter mentionde Zia lead @S into the K knowing W has max 3 @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: given|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: maybe I was wrong, but I heard it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hello Roland|pg||
nt|jaapfr: indeed 3nt theoretically chance to make here but who will bid that:)??|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, when south didn't open his 11 count|pg||
nt|po-s: Hi Patrick|pg||
nt|athene: it's normal for opener to prefer the suit contract with three, so east is assuming his partner has four spades|pg||
nt|athene: so it's not impossible he has the king|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@D may deny @C control - thus W places the final contact|pg||
nt|sharkey: *contract|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Gerben42: no slam interest opposite 2@H (minimum)|pg||
nt|vinbtech: 2D= what they call Ekrens in this part 44+ H+S 5-10 i think|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re|pg||
nt|jtr: She chose subtifuge instead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: best lead for defense but can not beat|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: looks like it but gib thinks differently|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: all lines now can not go wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass by N was forcing|pg||
nt|po-s: If Zia wins first heart it is possible that Piekarek tries to drop the HJ believing that Smirnov has four of them|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true but after NT by Zia, Wellan could count more than 3 losers|pg||
nt|hedyg: though i am surprised he didnt bid X to show losers in @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: usually pass over 6@s= no @s losers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very unusual I would say|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chick: 2@H is an artificial bid showing minimum hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no often a singleton trump in dummy is the contract making trick!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think Zia would, difficult for Welland|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yo_yo: set up @D?|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, South will open the bidding at some tables, I imagine|pg||
nt|gracelin: I will go to the other room where they are short of commentators. See you.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Bye|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: logical language then\|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: they must be playing it inverted|pg||
nt|hedyg: reminder: N could have A@s in his hand|pg||
nt|dburn: nothing is written in stone in this kind of auction|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if S passed the 4@S N bid and @S 5@S then...............:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: S 5@S|pg||
nt|dburn: if South had passed 4@s, so would everyone else have done|pg||
nt|pelu: 3 @C + 2@D + 4 tricks in Major|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not surprisingly ns do end in 4@H with no ot|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: yes, at some tables South will open, and then North might steamroller on|pg||
nt|jaapfr: +1 can if @CA @C @C|pg||
nt|xenya: stopping in 4@H was a tiny problem perhaps -- the rest should be easy|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Difficult to see this going off as he has not got entries to misguess hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk4: or 5 clubs, you know, Zia|pg||
nt|po-s: no danger to run nine|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: Gudni,  can anyone tell us which photos are of the players here?|pg||
nt|pelu: decl need a lot of entries in dummy - will he top-play @Cs?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: then would make:)|pg||
nt|xenya: 16 pairs will play a complete round robin of 8-board matches. The format is IMPs converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. This is Round 1 of 15. |pg||
nt|sharkey: Give Zia @DQ instead of @CQ...|pg||
nt|chick: when you are outgunned, outmanned, and outmaneuvered, there is one remaining option --- guile|pg||
nt|Walddk4: voila|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong again :(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To let 2@C show hearts|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: so it should be important for N to show A@s if he had it opposite maybe a singleton|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Not unreasonable for Roy to lead a heart through the strong hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you bid a D/C hand then I wonder|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: Jason alert 2cl im sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We believe you, Ivan|pg||
nt|po-s: Zia may have believed it might be longer clubs and didn´t bother to ask???|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes, if 2@C was gazilli then 2@H shows 6-7 without 6-card @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: E masy have to guess in @C after leading low to K and 9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mmmakela: so once again N gave up too easily, could investigate well below 4H-level|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re rashed david|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: anyone leading @C gives up a trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: not like this tho|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the only one i recognise is David Stevenson from Liverpool|pg||
nt|jaapfr: cllaim 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thats my thought too, PO|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|pelu: west has 11+ cards in minor so @sA is for sure an option|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think they have rd 15 running yet, though|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jaapfr: ok +1 auto now|pg||
nt|po-s: West is sure to have the DA so this was a safety play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: also if South opens West will bid spades, which will help in the play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: changes the whole hand and now makes 4|pg||
nt|xenya: 10 tricks now but perhaps the defence would have been different against 4@S|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Good defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hopefully they will get it up soon. Very interesting finish|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: yes gib right if ducks a diamond!|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm is the link to results etc|pg||
nt|athene: zia is hoping that he will get a chance to set up tricks in both hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: again, nothing is clear - no one knows in advance that the red suits are solid and that the club finesse will work|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sharkey: I think some top players may have invited with North's hand; I'm not sure S wud have accepted though|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1100 1430|pg||
nt|dburn: given a free run, you would not bid these cards to 7@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@C could ofc be in W|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vinbtech: W will cl all now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mmmakela: sometimes pards do have the perfect cards|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I think NS system needs an overhaul  , (memo get rid of that 2@D opener)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|dburn: might also encourage North to do more bidding - slow stuff in opponent's suit usually good for notrump|pg||
nt|athene: but the defence should find the diamond suit if their discards are well-discussed|pg||

nt|dburn: and it's not impossible that some pairs will just pass out 4@s - Zia wasn't exactly maximum for his double|pg||
nt|pelu: but wrong if West is void in @S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: yes that too|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@H+1 quiet board|pg||
mb|2S|an|5 spades + 4minor|nt|mmmakela: 1 H from N?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: again a DD slam with all cards sitting nicely|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes my kind of grand:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7nt unbeatable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he does not want to spend a play of 1 card too many whilst claiming: i love it:)|pg||
nt|athene: true the diamonds weren't good anyway but zia didn't know that, is what i meant|pg||
nt|po-s: 4spades might even go down|pg||
nt|granguru: 2NT looks like LSGT..3@D cue positive so game is bid|pg||
nt|granguru: Long Suit Game Try|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oh ic|pg||
nt|jaapfr: thought by disc @SJ thant he had to attack @CQ as entry|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@h an limited values|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Pass from Zia?|pg||
nt|hedyg: with K@H instead of ace Gromov might have passed 5@c to protect the king|pg||
nt|pelu: bad start for NS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But 3nt from E indicates somthing and W has at least 10 (or 11) cards in minors....|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcx: working on the photos hehe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Natural, 2+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming normal views|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, he had a long @s suit:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me it´s a good hand with 5431|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@C is four-way for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 12-14 bal, 11-18 natural, 16+ 4441 or 19+ any|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In the OR N bid 1@S here Roy starts with 1@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@C is a fine contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk4: EW do not play Polish Club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry all, have to go. Enjoy the rest of the show.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: running scores at http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|jaapfr: to eliminate a @S win in dummy|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zhao opened 3 NT OR...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what about 3@D by EW|pg||
nt|jaapfr: let us see later how many do bid  my bet is less than 20%:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no but he had great shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: N trying to make up for underbidding the last hand by going overboard on this one?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pity that 4@H has here no chance|pg||
nt|sharkey: And I think N will raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H looks purely competitive, so N may well pass|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: Welland may have opened..|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: Hachett: 1Nt (weak) and passed out - here EW wscaped|pg||
nt|granguru: would you defend 4@S with South hand if p had never bid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S by EW a bit lunatic imo:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: better hand after X Zia would have bid 4|pg||
nt|sharkey: Click on flashing green light on Round 8 for Board update|pg||
nt|jtr: Cards lie well on this one though|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a black 1nt|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed he did, but great shape will not always save you at the five level - imagine what would have happened if the North-West cards had been interchanged|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT= 5-5 other suits|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 1NT by N - do they play strong NT i 3. seat?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Don't know what 3@S is|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s asking for @s stopper probably|pg||
nt|pelu: would u X or bid 1@S in West - my bid is X|pg||
nt|hedyg: now does this look like wanting to play 4NT?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Peter:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: if 3@s was asking what is 4NT?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  4NT would not have occurred to me|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4-6 in the minors it sounds to me|pg||
nt|hedyg: Zia likes to live dangerously|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welland also confused|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, 3@s looks like fit in @c to me for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is Jxx a fit opposite 2+?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: choice of contract 5@C or 4NT, I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: no it isnt, Roy chose not to bid his suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: hide and seek rarely good in bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@D on his first turn would have made it a lot easier|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe 2@d was nf|pg||
nt|rnmalik: If @S stopper available|pg||
nt|pelu: do we have a update problem - round 14 is not on the sesult-page?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Looks like it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Don't try 4NT on your partner unless discussed in detail|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Cannot be a final bid in my opinion as D could have been better, so a long @c suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and let N decide|pg||
nt|hedyg: opposite an assumed @c fit 4NT can ask for better minor|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot*|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Roy sounds as confused as we are|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@S a strange bid by Welland - why not just 2@S = GF?|pg||
nt|bucheister: How can that result be right; he again had the rest of the tricks; something is wrong|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi John, everyone:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: transfer to @H|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Sensible contract|pg||
nt|jaapfr: think 3nt even DD unbeatable|pg||
nt|jaapfr: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Zia going for the 3NT money if partner has a @s stop|pg||
nt|sharkey: trump lead will set it 2 i think|pg||
nt|granguru: Hot second|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia thinking x?|pg||
nt|sharkey: or 4 NT?|pg||
nt|granguru: defending|pg||
nt|jtr: X probably|pg||
nt|jtr: But he will pass|pg||
nt|granguru: a x only if it not a pen one|pg||
nt|sharkey: He will not bid 5@C as kib suggests...|pg||
nt|granguru: agree|pg||
nt|granguru: 4NT is much better|pg||
nt|jtr: X or pass the only options|pg||
nt|granguru: showing more @Cs than @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: Rite you are Vladimir|pg||
nt|rnmalik: absolutely but difficult to bid|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@C sh be the 'normak' bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will you all pass on a hand like south´s|pg||
nt|pelu: 50-50|pg||
nt|sharkey: S opened OR - may be difficult to play in @H contract now view N bidding 1 NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|ralfwil: That´s a point Peter!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have been watching Welland/Zia for ages and we are still not sure what their notrump range is|pg||
nt|othered1: 3rd seat, non-vul can be a good place to semipsych 1N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what is your opinion about 1nt on N? for me 1@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: great  gudni  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: seems strange W didn't open 1@D -- it does look like some version of Polish Club?|pg||
nt|jtr: He knows 5m is probably not making|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yw|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that takes care of 3@D|pg||
nt|xenya: W might get in with 2N now?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: too balanced to bid as W i am afraid|pg||
nt|othered1: If my system requires 1N on that hand, I find another system.  But as a matter of tactics, it has some appeal.|pg||
nt|po-s: 3rd in hand it is worth a preempt...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Russian women in the other room were shut out when Zhao opened a two-suited 2@S|pg||
nt|po-s: but did it make?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vinbtech: on a D lead; has only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a nice simple sequence, WD  EW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: slight disparity of contracts....not sure what 1N is|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS need to get @S into play|pg||
nt|jtr: tempted to bid 2@d|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -1 possible|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, not ideal|pg||
nt|jaapfr: aha proves me wrong|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now 3@H and 4@H|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@S strange - no suit and values for bid @S later|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Landed on their feet|pg||
nt|pelu: his only bid if 2@D is NF|pg||
nt|pelu: spects tell me that 2@S = @C-fit - but then what to bid in N???|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and probably no problem with the play. W is squeezed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fu corrected to 3@C (pass/correct)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and that contract made|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzcx: E/W are playing prec|pg||
nt|mmmakela: brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: game not an awful proposition here but doomed with both trump honours offside|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i feel uneasy with East's bidding thee|pg||
nt|yo_yo: there|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S very mild, considering the nice holdings in both partner's suits|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then 2@D has to be forcing. Otherwise you can't bid|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: 1NT not enough for game ( as i understand it) then he jumps to game |pg||
nt|athene: interesting the south in the other room didn't open|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a X by E was not too standard|pg||
nt|jtr: But he should know partner has 4@hs|pg||
nt|xenya: but 3@H is not a piece of cake either|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @D now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and to find @CT as reentry|pg||
nt|xenya: not obvious from W's perspective i think|pg||
nt|jaapfr: too much DD|pg||
nt|chick: a non-working commentator suggests that X of 2@D might have worked out well for EW|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree David, my point was just that pass or X over 6@s usually have specific meanings in a partnership|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure...|pg||
nt|sharkey: may pass|pg||
nt|pelu: Welland - Zia has some succes by bidding 3Nt "every" time - and even here a succes (but not in last round) :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can zia make this after a @c lead?|pg||
nt|pelu: a @C-lead will make it hard for Zia|pg||
nt|pelu: but - as spects tells me - @D-lead will defeat 5@D|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|paulhac:  With the double this might well make|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe 1NT is M-m?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Well Roy has worked it out well|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jaapfr: 2@S-5 no one had a X chance:)|pg||
nt|athene: it looks normal enough to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: Easier from here .....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@D was on way to 2@H:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Zia was a ph, 3@s already a strong bid|pg||
nt|pelu: Welland could bid 3@H - Zia is almost out of the bidding now :(|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jaapfr: i guess this a 15% 3nt|pg||
nt|paulhac:  As high as that?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i accept if lower:)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Bare K or KX with South|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and this lead too|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulhac:  Though we can see this is an easy make declarer will be worried in case both spades and the Q@H are badly placed|pg||
nt|xenya: spectators in the other room had a rare chance to see a psychic transfer |pg||
nt|jaapfr: lovely 2@H bid but could end as disaster|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we  all agree:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|dburn: South could have been a lot worse for 1NT - 3@s was plenty|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sharkey: N may have had a Support xx available 1st time - chose 1 NT instead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I cannot understand 3nt when partner has a stiff @d|pg||
nt|pelu: has Welland placed one af his @hs in the @d-suit? :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 9 tricks in @h or even 10 if N plays another @d|pg||
nt|po-s: trump?|pg||
nt|po-s: but not enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too late now, isn't it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe an initial trump lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if he ruffs 2 diamonds in his hand he may run out of trumps before scoring club trick i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't ruff any diamond if you get a trump switch|pg||
nt|po-s: if he ruffs 2 diamonds he has already nine|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was replying to the comment about "if N leads another D"|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yo_yo: seems a shame it's going down |pg||
nt|mdgraham: quasi-forcing, maybe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: DD i like 3@H nice N did|pg||
nt|rnmalik: seems so I thought 3@H bid over 3@D was plausible|pg||
nt|ralfwil: there will probably be some discussion from NS after this...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Results: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|sharkey: Click on the flashing green light for board updates this round|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lead problem in E, giving AQ@D to N|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not your everyday bidding sequence... |pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: on natural methods there is an argument for an invite of 3S rather than a unilateral 4 but west ould probably decline its quite a good contract but unlucky|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway 3nt most likely to fail so 1nt+1 optimal imo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: funny thing of bridge S is fearing now to go down: even in 3nt|pg||
nt|paulhac:  + hearts 3-3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was replying to "or even 10 if N plays another diamond"|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: We are in Moscow for the annual Slava Cup|pg||
nt|roswolf: but he will be happy soon|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Good 7@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp:  http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16p1h.htm|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Communications are not very fluid for declarer, and the defence will try not to help him, but may be forced to |pg||
nt|mcarroll: S should probably have ducked, even though it was only postponing the problem. what to lead now?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: (opening looks normal, i mean, not passing :) )|pg||
nt|dburn: not really|pg||
nt|xenya: too late -- now the @D only helps declarer|pg||
pc|c8|nt|paulhac:  Some may consider it too good for a weak 2 at the vul but would be reluctant to open 1|pg||
nt|jtr: or J10 or Single J/10 North|pg||
nt|jtr: Must be getting close to 50%:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 99% made now i do not see down chances|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although @D @D best defense|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A few complications with clubs 4-0, but I trust Zia to work it out|pg||
nt|paulhac:  With the trump break Zia cannot test diamonds so has to rely on the heart A being right|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk4: http://www.slavacup.ru/  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|jtr: Seems no rush though|pg||
nt|dburn: he did not want West to cash that @dJ - he would have made the contract if West had not done so|pg||
nt|jaapfr: defense seems appropiate until now|pg||
nt|dburn: this defence is fine - not cashing the diamond would have let the contract through|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good lead and -1 I think|pg||
nt|granguru: A trump lead would have been better|pg||
nt|granguru: @S of course now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mcarroll: On board 2 in the Open NS had no difficulty bidding the @H game which was played in 1NT here generating the first significant swing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is a show-up squeeze now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: right, all he promised was shape|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jaapfr: y true specs @HT is needed not to be trown in in E to get it down|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y no SJ coming down in 2|pg||
mc|10|nt|sharkey: W forced to take @H finesse to have a chance|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with best defence -4|pg||
nt|pelu: qntil now 3 x 4@H making|pg||
nt|sharkey: Double-Dummy defence...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D back -2, Q@S back productive and we see the cards also|pg||
nt|sharkey: West will not lead @SQ - doesnt look too good if N has @SA instead of !K...|pg||
nt|sharkey: @SK|pg||
nt|pelu: even -2 is a big score for EW|pg||
nt|pelu: remember we are playing IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh well, so much for that squeeze|pg||

nt|vugraphzcx: 5th photo 2 man on the left are the magnusson and eliasson in this order magnusson is W|pg||
nt|mcarroll: An 13 imps away as 3NT was made in the Open|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@C down too|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you do it to gain a tempo, so that declarer can't take the deep finesse and force the ace|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I thought T@D on Ace was to switch to @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: dont think so - N wud get a @C ruff with @S9|pg||
nt|jtr: Miracle position though|pg||
nt|sharkey: kib suggested @DQ|pg||
nt|jtr: No entry|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@S and 4m do make here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this 4@H we all make and claim in tr 1:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: 3sp = show sp stop|pg||

nt|hedyg: give them the occasion to make a mistake|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If Zia open with 1@h the rest is easy|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vinbtech: from magnusson also i think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting board|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S too|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H vs 4@S|pg||
nt|caruga: 5@S|pg||
nt|paulhac:  That explains everything|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Sensible pass this time|pg||
nt|sharkey: Click on flshing Round 7 to see the score on previous board|pg||
nt|sharkey: *flashing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although..|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4NT was meant to play as 3@S should show a spade stopper according to Zia|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But @c discard had made it easier for W than a guess|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: part score hand for E/W best played in spades|pg||
nt|yo_yo: star pairs or open pairs ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: just to make it interesting for us |pg||
nt|dburn: not sure why Welland bypassed spades - Zia would pass 1NT also with a 4=5=2=2 minimum|pg||
nt|xenya: EW have a cheap save available but not clear whether they can find it|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@S is down|pg||
nt|chick: 4@D a fit jump, showing good diamonds and spade support|pg||
nt|rnmalik: at 4@S has 2 losers only-for 4@H there are 3 losers|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so as a spec says  @C or 6@H-2 is the OPTIMUM score|pg||
nt|jaapfr: X|pg||
nt|pelu: The first board - 3 pairs in 3NT - 1 making - the other 2 down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Easy 3NT with diamonds breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure why declarer in the other room did not take his 10 top tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: in fact has 10 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: horror result in the other room for n/s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@S on @H lead -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5M can go down|pg||
nt|chick: first EW have to find the @H fit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@CX-2 or 6@HX-2|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Cheap sacrifice for the Russians here|pg||
nt|hedyg: unusual 4@d bid with just 3 card fit|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt maded on a @H lead - down on @S-leads|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welland trying to persuade them not to take it. How do you do that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can he scrape by making 1?|pg||
nt|dburn: unless... no, surely they can't be playing F***ry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possible|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y with solid 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Welland didnt open with 11 and stiff - did with 10....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Interesting all germs for going overboard|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i am too stupid how to copy yr given links specs:(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what weaker pass or 4@S?|pg||
nt|drewsky: 4@S = I don't want to let them find their heart fit :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT = 4 cards in a major and a longer minor|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Known as Raptor|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  ambitious 6@S but could have worked on a different layout|pg||
nt|jaapfr: due to x@C in E 6@S down pity whilst fine contract|pg||
nt|xenya: the score on the screen only shows a comparison between 2 tables, actually there are 8 tables in play|pg||
nt|athene: 6-2 spade fit played in 3nt a moment ago|pg||
nt|athene: now a 4-4 spade fit played in 3nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - 3 NT makes - how do you bid after Opps open 1 NT?|pg||
nt|chick: E doesn't have the stuff to try a 5 bid|pg||
nt|pelu: the misscoring in board 95 has been corrected - and gave &VPs for Zia|pg||
nt|pelu: 6VP|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@s is on|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You don't|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How cheap is 5@H really?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 500 is hardly a profitable save|pg||
nt|hedyg: well it is less than 650|pg||
nt|hedyg: Zia now sees @H shortage in N|pg||
nt|po-s: is 500 enough?|pg||
nt|bucheister: interesting result in the CR|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: spades? why not diamonds?|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, I am off to do the Junior Camrose - have fun|pg||
nt|jaapfr: kib suggests 4@S kungfu contract here:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bye David|pg||
nt|po-s: spade slam looks ok until you have to play nit|pg||
nt|granguru: now vul vs not|pg||
nt|xenya: and they did not -- just like in the other room|pg||
nt|sharkey: Neither EW ventured into the bidding - surprisingly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: As a veteran rubber bridge player, Zia perhaps uses a redouble a bit more than many experts currently tend to|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double when vulnerable and facing a passed partner is too rich for me|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|po-s: bye David |pg||
nt|jaapfr: bye|pg||
nt|roswolf: makes me ashamed to be english:(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: confusing Vlad:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway the 2@S bid is a clear warning which was not there in OR|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Ace less may pass|pg||
nt|xenya: not really Jaap -- there are 16 pairs in competition and the format is IMPs converted to VPs on a datum basis|pg||
nt|jaapfr: aha if trump a @C with @SQ all is well|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I agree with the kitbitzers that you can make 6@S  but not so obvious to do so on a trump lead|pg||
nt|paulhac:  6@S could be called unlucky |pg||
nt|jtr: Rebid problems and position mattered to him|pg||
nt|jaapfr: too many disadvantages with the 1@C opening today|pg||
nt|rnmalik: outbid:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and yesterday|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer to show a strong rise in @s instead of D from N|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like down 2 for me|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: yes, a lot of work to do with only a 4-4 fit, despite having no losers|pg||
nt|granguru: other was the other way around|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5 dias can be made if accident but can go down too|pg||
nt|pelu: he played 4x1H first - and disc a @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: could bid and make 6@D also|pg||
nt|xenya: NS can make 6@D here -- but that certainly looks far-fetched|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in OR there was no clue (here there is : odd dristibution|pg||
nt|jtr: Looks like 4@s could go down|pg||
nt|dburn: South took a lot of tricks at the other table - 20 points apiece, ten tricks for declarer and three for the opponents|pg||
nt|bigtrain: :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT sh be 15-17 here|pg||
nt|sharkey: N NT rebid with 15 HCP - may shud open 1 NT?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: hm 2N looks optimistic 16 counts very difficult to deal with opposite wide ranginmg 1 respon ses|pg||
nt|yo_yo: http://reykjavikbridgefestival.com/index.php?m=E1&id=M_STARPHOTO2010&iid=IF_PHOTOSTAR2010&m=E1|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this one Gudni?|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm  for standings after Round 3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a lot of bbo plyers would bid 4nt as W:)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  3 clubs and 2 diamonds for starts|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yo_yo: i can see East's character starting to emerge |pg||
nt|yo_yo: he's a bit of a gambler|pg||
nt|lestergold: diamodns reasonable 6/2 fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: 12/13 imps on a coffee hand|pg||
nt|athene: even assuming you play it the right way round|pg||
nt|po-s: not such a lot if the red suits - or one of them behaved|pg||
nt|granguru: it is like getting involved with a woman when single and when married...risks are different|pg||
nt|jtr: Forrester delivered an unwanted @d ruff  Not easy though|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: That's one way of putting on a Sunday morning John :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  The 1Nt opener has kept e/w out of game|pg||
nt|pelu: weak Nt in 1. and 2|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D GF I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even Vul?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with the minors this way around, you mean|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5-2 certainly better if you play ELC|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with 2-5 you have no choice if he bids diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ELC = Equal Level Conversion|pg||
nt|peachy: lack of spade overcall de-railed EW |pg||
pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: thanks   |pg||
nt|jaapfr: and do you  want to be there normally?|pg||
nt|jtr: Fighting|pg||
nt|marlowepi: am slightly surprised N let EW off the hook. how good do his Ds have to be to double 2D ??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S has a stiff heart there may be no game|pg||
nt|othered1: pe;rhaps they don't play that double for penalty|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|paulhac:  The 2@S bid may make it easier |pg||
nt|sharkey: West opened in OR - still cudnt get there|pg||
nt|jtr: Welland wins|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yo_yo: hi David  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: hope some of your "laws" come up|pg||
nt|vinbtech: a loser in each suit; he has to avoid 1 of them at least|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the link above shows Magnusson and elisasson   folks|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT appears to be the optimal strain - EW cannot attack any suit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: and david stevenson from UK|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2+2+3+2|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zhao-Fu are one of the top pairs in the world|pg||
nt|sharkey: ...and they're leading this contest; Zia-Welland are placed third|pg||
nt|jtr: If they dont play another card i guess they win by default|pg||
nt|sharkey: zzzzzz|pg||
nt|rnmalik: misfit and comfortably assessed|pg||
nt|pelu: vuln are only for small boys :)|pg||
nt|pelu: I am old - so I play weak in green and strong in red :(:(|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10 or 11 tricks in 4@S depending on diamonds. I think 11|pg||
nt|po-s: yes but should we start with a dia ruff?|pg||
nt|peachy: while S overcall derailed NS in the other room|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chick: that makes it cashout time|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if 2@S in the other room was artificial? so-card "third suit forcing"|pg||
nt|athene: looks a bit weird after a 2 over 1|pg||
nt|jtr: It would be interesting to know what he is thinking about  I cant really tell|pg||
nt|sharkey: or E?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S easier to play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C so friendly|pg||
nt|pelu: I go for coffee :(:(|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: so-called|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well then the blue card isn;t pulling ny weight|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: I dont know the lady |pg||
nt|peachy: things happen, none of the actions were wild at all|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jaapfr: @DJ is so vitally important but can W ever know that?|pg||
nt|sharkey: No - must be W|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so 6-1 preferred to 6-2 here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  How can we get to 6@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Next....|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rnmalik: the observation is after seeing all 52 cards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you lead a @D|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Certainly makeable on a non diamond lead|pg||
nt|athene: east thinking about 6n? but that can't be making if the double is really lightner for diamonds, since the diamonds aren't going to be a trick source|pg||
nt|athene: and there's no way that north would double with something like @SQJ109 and nothing else :)|pg||
nt|po-s: and if it is for hearts it is ok for him|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok bets on: make or down?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: me down|pg||
nt|jaapfr: E a bit strong but yes too|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: they usually ome up when David is not here|pg||
nt|vinbtech: didnt avoid H loser; letssee what follows|pg||
nt|rnmalik: make|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cannot be @H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: flat next please|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jaapfr: imo the 3@H bid in OR useless bid|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Surely after the X a diamond stands out|pg||
nt|jtr: Players always think the longest when there is no defence|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Looking at the 2 hands if you know the points are in North Yes|pg||
nt|pelu: East know that his pd has 0-2 HCP - sp passiv lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Can't avoid 12 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/EGlossary/EqualLevelConversion.html  in case you want to read about ELC|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sA and another @s will kill 4@h|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: looks like working on @s  better but not naturaly given 8 card @H fit |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very unlucky|pg||
nt|pelu: take the @d finess = 11|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what think of the opening lead?|pg||
nt|xenya: my money is on make|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Make|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chick: will take 11 when the @HQ falls|pg||
nt|yo_yo: sort of a gambler's lead?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: 2S was ok but if bidding went to 3 level it sure has to be diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: while we are on the subject of redoubles and auctions like this, i just reread a classic article in the Bridge World by Ed Manfield called "I've Got a Secret", in which he laid out ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a framework for bidding over takeout doubles which was innovative in its day but now has been widely adopted. highly recommended for the eager reader|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: Some kibs asking why no Stayman by Welland with 4-4 in the majors. Search me is all I can say|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He felt like bidding 3NT is my guess|pg||
nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i agree now: makes|pg||
nt|jaapfr: must play @S 2-2 for best chance |pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1@C was each session 1x or 2x working as a nasty boomerang|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yo_yo: for those who dont know, david Burns laws, might care to look them up at: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm|pg||
nt|vinbtech: he had a lead problem |pg||
nt|vinbtech: cant lead H and C and D too; so S ! simple|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: west forced out but can still enjoy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if i understood it correctly|pg||
nt|dburn: well, not "very unlucky" - would also have gone down with 4-1 spades|pg||
nt|po-s: or lucky...guess he would have doubled also with Jxx|pg||
nt|chick: I don't know what 1@C was supposed to do, but not bidding @Hs by W was nuts|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: claim:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Declarer doesnt know the @hs are breaking but thinks they probably are|pg||
nt|jtr: Takes the 100% option|pg||
pc|d5|nt|paulhac:  Well done|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Jaap a coke please:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he did it again although here was easier to claim|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jaapfr: 5-5 most likely now|pg||
nt|dburn: but mildly unlucky, for certain|pg||
nt|sharkey: of course...|pg||
pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: i believe that article won a prestigious award, as well|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vinbtech: will be suprised if he makes now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think that there are 7 tricks on almost any line now|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok he did it right |pg||
pc|hT|nt|yo_yo: cant he claim?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but a helpful lead and sitting @C do make declarers life easy here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mmmakela: shd've tested QJ dbltn in spades before heart play|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Unlucky would normally make on any 3-2 trump brak|pg||
nt|bucheister: that must be wrong; he had a natural spade trick and a long one for down one|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chick: helpful is an understatement, the club lead was disasterous|pg||

nt|mmmakela: well was Qx...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do you open the NOrth hand?|pg||

nt|lestergold: as we were discussing the merits of different denomination how many tricks were avialble in hearts??|pg||
nt|lestergold: academic i fear|pg||
nt|vinbtech: even DK would have workded here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wd |pg||
nt|vinbtech: Dk discard|pg||
nt|po-s: would you say close to 60%?|pg||
nt|jtr: 1NT again|pg||
nt|jaapfr: rather strong expression if systemic|pg||
nt|rnmalik: On 4@D W should have bid 4@H instead of X|pg||
nt|jaapfr: here the scoring result unclear whilst first  2boards (for OR 2 last) can change the result heavily|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Got to go bye all|pg||

nt|vugraphzdp: 2c = art|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Ivan|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: but lots do open |pg||
nt|jaapfr: now to bid 4@H :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be W shud - pd's 3@D VUL must be a good hand - if not suicidal vs Pd pass opening|pg||
nt|jtr: I think they play 14-16|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam coming up|pg||
nt|rnmalik: WOW, what a hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But @cK is not so far away, when E won the first @c with @cA - or?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: pass out ? maybe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for yours:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in weekend no non alcoholics|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no X makes, no @D lead makes:)|pg||
nt|solex33: maybe - quite "unlucky" ? :-)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Another routine game|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcarroll: The Open seem to be pursuing the same line|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  At least South has to find a ruff when the spades are 3-2|pg||
nt|po-s: all 3-2 without a direct ruff|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H has a play here?|pg||
nt|sharkey: S remained silent in OR|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice defence next door|pg||
nt|vicky888: hello all|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i would open the south hand though|pg||
nt|athene: West has a bit of a problem here|pg||
nt|jtr: North wants to bid something|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H some kind of good @S raise - viw S has shown @H|pg||
nt|sharkey: Can they bid the Grand?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 35 HCP between them|pg||
nt|dburn: now, has Forrester been persuaded to take up Polish bidding>|pg||
nt|hedyg: heavy 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can even survive the 5-level on this layout|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 23 count and you expect to be left alone, but no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Before you know it, opps are in 5@D|pg||
nt|othered1: Reasonable save here in @D.  but position of @HQ now likely exposed|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: is my first day doing this ever, sorry for inconvieniences|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: most E will pass after1@S and some mite bid 1nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: opposite a passed pard 2@H is bold|pg||
nt|sharkey: *view|pg||
nt|jaapfr: where this will end 3nt?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now a lot ask me to explain so i do pass the trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Is that not over 60% PO|pg||
nt|athene: double is fine as long as partner isn't so ill-mannered as to bid diamonds|pg||
nt|po-s: I would think more than 60|pg||
nt|dburn: closer to 65%, but a contract that will fail one time in three is not "very unlucky" to do so - unless you're Polish, of course|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we see the cards every key card is nicely placed for Grand:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia is rechecking his hand....|pg||
nt|jtr: I prefer 2@s|pg||
nt|dburn: no - he will bid his longest suit first, like the Yorhshireman he is|pg||
pc|c7|nt|po-s: new form of Polish club?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now 4@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia may think Welland has @hs|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Me also|pg||
nt|chick: I don't, for me that would show 4 spades|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jtr: 2NT now?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@C nicer|pg||
nt|xenya: this is not a very good grand...|pg||
nt|chick: 1N describes the hand much better|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@d can be made by ruffing out the K@c?|pg||
nt|bucheister: NP|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: North knows his customer|pg||
nt|jaapfr: click and crl+c then in chatbox ctrl+v|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont like Kx@h facing 3 cards|pg||
nt|dburn: and then he will bid his second longest suit, and hope for the best|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good one|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Support double from N showing 3@Ss?|pg||
nt|pelu: with @CJ by NS 6@C would be a nice slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT balanced and old-fashioned game-forcing. No major|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my praying did help for yours:)|pg||
nt|athene: we need an adjective slightly less emphatic than "very" but more so than "mildly"|pg||
nt|sharkey: E will bid 3@S I think - showing 6 card suit|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@d did the trick anyway|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - I think Zia's initial Dbl afforded that|pg||
nt|sharkey: Running scores: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r7.htm|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S+4@H+4@C+1@D=13|pg||
nt|xenya: oh yes it makes|pg||
nt|sharkey: Click on flashing green light on Round 8 for Board updates|pg||
nt|sharkey: One Kib counted 18 tricks....|pg||
nt|chick: why distort your shape with spades first?   with 6-5, just bid normally, longest suit first|pg||
nt|hedyg: no @c lead :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Double Dummy we know E has @CAQ - E cud be having stiff @CA |pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: have time to ruff some @D here  should not be all bad |pg||
nt|roswolf: slam try - i would play that as a splinter maybe a fit jump type bid!?|pg||
nt|athene: how about "somewhat"|pg||
nt|po-s: I´m for whoever tries a slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S was somewhat unlucky|pg||
nt|sharkey: N have shown 1-3-4-5 I think|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi all gm|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gd morning Jaap|pg||
nt|jtr: I think West devalued his hand by only bidding 2@h and is now wondering|pg||
nt|jtr: Hoi Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi carl and is ivan here?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi David|pg||
nt|sharkey: Whats W to do - two soft Q?|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe he thinks partner has a @d single|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Ivan was our operator yesterday in this CR and made 0 misclicks in all sessions:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: As long as you take the right view in Major suits 3 NT no problem...|pg||
nt|dburn: tell that to Malinowski - I already know|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A rare strong jump shift|pg||
nt|pelu: but the alert? did it show @H-support?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The CC does not reveal that|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: well third in hand yes but vul is unvafourable some might be more conservative|pg||
nt|xenya: the score on the screen doesn't mean much -- it's only a comparison between 2 tables, but there are 8 tables in play|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 13-10 makes match close again|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slightly unlucky|pg||
nt|po-s: go for very - not extremely or utterly|pg||
nt|solex33: slightly very unlucky|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true|pg||
nt|chick: I don't like J9x facing AQxx for a trump suit either :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Would you prefer ro play 2@S or 1NTX|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can become expensive her|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@D more beatiful than 3nt although 1 imp profit:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mmmakela: is that 1 @C 15+ precicion or upgrade|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: prec|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 15+? or 16+? |pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: will ask after this board?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok ty|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting no 1@H-1@S|pg||
nt|po-s: very courageous 2H btw|pg||
nt|jtr: South engineered a trump promotion at the other table|pg||
nt|sharkey: or get a @D lead...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -2 atleast|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg: a bit DD that|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|chick: generally you need about 29 HCP to play 3N with a 5-5-2-1 facing a 1-2-5-5 (not quite the case here), but they do have 27|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If the defence do not lead trumps a @C @D crossruff will produce lots of tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: give pd a chance to play @s?|pg||
nt|dburn: what with one thing and another, though, 4@h would have been problematic, so this result is again unclear|pg||
nt|pelu: pl tell me the NT-opening system for NS - I has exp N to pen 1NT - but - :(:(:(|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dburn: now, making a takeout double of 2@s and hearing partner want to play in clubs and not diamonds - that's more than somewhat lucky|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, it must be Zia's fault then:)|pg||
nt|chick: I would prefer to play 1NX than 2SX here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: one would expect 1@S response, agree|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia jnows they're missing only 5 HCP; does he know pd is 4441?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jtr: Zia is on his way to doing the same|pg||
nt|hedyg: if 8@H showed 3 cards then void in @c is known in E hand|pg||
nt|po-s: and of DJ, but with stiff wouldn´t Roy bid 5H?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would be afraid of bidding just 1NT with the north hand however|pg||
nt|sybarra: and now?|pg||
nt|pelu: even @C 10 would do|pg||
nt|jaapfr: another example of the disadvantage of a 1@C opening|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Any reason why Roy opened 1@C instead of 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Paul|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well he needs those trumps for ruffing anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not much use to pick up Ds 3-1|pg||
nt|othered1: In some auctions where more is known about north's hand, I'd think pass might imply @D shortness.  But this is different and north has so many possible hand types.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: was 3@h an underbid?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps it is a sequence for Unusual over Unusual|pg||
nt|po-s: Ralf is kidding?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: i guess if east had gone for diamonds, west was planning just to pass and hope for the best|pg||
nt|sharkey: East was destined to lead a red card which wud make it easier for declarer|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still enough to do|pg||
nt|sharkey: Communications may be a problem if W ducks..|pg||
nt|drewsky: I know why he opened 1@C|pg||
nt|jtr: They do that on balanced hands i guess|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mcarroll: @C @H crossruff|pg||
nt|pelu: give N@C8 and intrafiness could bring home a slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C suit not very favourable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this is going very wrong for ew|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one hears the sound of falling wheels |pg||
nt|jaapfr: DD an easy board but SD a puzzle for all there|pg||
nt|xenya: if you have to bid grand, 7@C is best perhaps|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@C checkback; 3@D one or both Majors - I presume|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: so I predict they will make this|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so they did well|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - why bid a bad suit with a good hand?|pg||
nt|po-s: what do they do with the "normal" 18-19 NT?|pg||
nt|jtr: Like Polish @c|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agreed |pg||
nt|jaapfr: see beauty defense OR why 6@S went down in tr 2|pg||
nt|jtr: Here the distribution is marked for declarer|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think you can make Grand in all strains??|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: well-judged by Welland?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you suspect that 5@D wasn't what East wanted to hear |pg||
nt|jaapfr: likely no X by N to encourage @H lead by pd|pg||
nt|po-s: so they never know if they have a major and wk NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: X of 5@D i meant|pg||
nt|mdgraham: auction not over yet....|pg||
nt|po-s: couldn´t West have CA and DK?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: after an 18-19 1nt by pd if he not pass now he has to go too............................:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, 1NT can't be 18-19, that's for sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it's all a bit mysterious|pg||
nt|po-s: it used to show 18, and 1M was bid with wk NT and 3+card suit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: also for them i am sure|pg||
nt|po-s: but these guys don´t play regular Polish|pg||
nt|po-s: not his style at all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nv-v i would bid 2@H too|pg||
nt|paulhac:  So do not keep us in suspense Drew|pg||
nt|chick: zia trying to appear tricky :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: told 1NT is a one-round force, called the Dymanic NT  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, Dynamic|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be not @H|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure about 7@H|pg||
nt|xenya: but they won't bid that|pg||
pc|hT|nt|paulhac:  In the other room West bid spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still i think he will make it|pg||
nt|jtr: If he can manouvre things|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @HA and @C|pg||
nt|jtr: A sort of dummy reversal makes it|pg||
nt|jtr: Nothing the defence can do but declarer does not know that|pg||
nt|dburn: very tricky, Roy|pg||
nt|pelu: is it? @CK = 50% (almost) - and the @Hs 3-3 (or Q drop) = ?|pg||
nt|oliverc: no. Marking your team record that you want to (as you have done) is quite|pg||
nt|oliverc: sufficient)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of spec ask me a lot of Q - please update your profil with names !!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: same here and same answer|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I think at pairs 3NT was a better contract as played in OR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S puppet to 2NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: dynamite 1nt?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia has shown 5@S on this bidding in my opinion - somewhat surprised N doesn't correct to 4@S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn: if we need to play in spades, partner can bid them|pg||
nt|xenya: well they sniffed at slam here|pg||
nt|athene: and if east bid diamonds and south doubled, he could reconsider (fake an urgent phone call perhaps)|pg||
nt|po-s: "quite" might be the right one in both cases|pg||
nt|rnmalik: either 7@C or 7NT:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: wd|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but imo 2@D -2 too|pg||
nt|drewsky: They play 5 card @D suits, I think.....but Roy LOVES to mix it up a lot...ergo 1@C rather than 1@D|pg||
nt|jtr: They were unlucky to get caught|pg||
nt|chick: there is no good contract for NS on this hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Sped cameras everywhere nowadays:)|pg||
nt|jtr: speed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: by the ladies is not that awful i suppose:)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: i think 90% would bid 1@S   |pg||
nt|xenya: lots of messages saying 7 @H also makes|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dont think so|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we know about 18 tr but declarer will sweat:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: did he miscount declarer and play Zia for @c void?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: defnce have done well to hold it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7@H can make imo|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Even I can make it after seeing all cards:)|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure Welland is happy to see the dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: no, but he knew that declarer (if he had the void) would not run that club|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, all will be forgiven if East makes this|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia shud have switched to @S trick 2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: take 7 tricka and trump 6x but if @H lead?|pg||
nt|dburn: after all, what could he usefully discard on it anyway?|pg||
nt|hedyg: Zia knows Forrester has nothing to discard|pg||
nt|pelu: Welland - Zia very often play 3Nt on 5-3 fits in major|pg||
nt|ralfwil: calim 11 tricks and next board|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharkey: yes - 7@H makes - 3@S 3@C 4@H 2@D and @S ruff|pg||
nt|rnmalik: makes an extra trick now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with @CA @D return created a trick so -1 can|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jtr: Wouldnt that make life easier?|pg||
nt|jtr: Cheap finesse|pg||
nt|jaapfr: claim|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2+2@S+1@D+1C=6 specs is -1 agree now:)?|pg||
nt|drewsky: after 2 rounds of spades and a heart off dummy, Sabine has better duck it|pg||
nt|jtr: Was tough to find the @c|pg||
nt|jaapfr: esp after 1@C:)|pg||
mc|10|nt|chick: the spade lead seems wrong when S showed 4 spades|pg||
nt|po-s: or 22 in trumps and any 42 in hearts or at least 3 hearts with the long trumps?|pg||

nt|chick: he settled for simply making the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: 1@C is 16+|pg||
nt|mmmakela: thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: np|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and reach 4@H:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Time to revist the system file|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what a push|pg||
nt|paulhac:  It did not seem to effect the chineses:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: running scorers at http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|jtr: As long as he is allowed to gain the lead twice in @cs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even @S lead i think it beats too|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice board for N/S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if xH Q endplay W also 7 tr|pg||
nt|chick: lol  one spec suggests that zia was keeping the beer card (@D7) for last trick :)|pg||
nt|pelu: slam now|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Slam time again|pg||
nt|po-s: bidding 2 strong clubs and opps bid 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Slam possible here|pg||
nt|hedyg: no 1NT opening it seems with 5 card major|pg||
nt|po-s: still only 3 down. How is a trump lead?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1st and 2nd position they play 13-15|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: after 2 heart tricks Zia show cards and was some embrassing because spade 0-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: spade partial for e/w vs heart partial for N/S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, revisit - couild have been revise, too, which would also be appropriate I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: this tournament is held in the Moscow City Golf Club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A little surprised to see that Fu did not interfere after the strong club in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On 21|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mmmakela: sry can't type your name correctly dear operator!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 16 pairs taking part, by invitation only|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed, Paul|pg||
nt|athene: west needs to write "negative free bids" on his card quickly|pg||
nt|athene: so he can bid 2@S|pg||
nt|dburn: good time to have a non-forcing 2@s available|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S makes, on the layout|pg||
nt|athene: for any specs who haven't met the term, "negative free bids" means after an overcall, as here, responder's new suit is non-forcing|pg||
nt|dburn: but if North bids 5@d, East will not be certain how to proceed|pg||
nt|athene: with a "real" 2@S bid he doubles first then bids spades|pg||
nt|athene: these methods are very popular in poland - not sure why, especially - i don't think they mesh especially well with the rest of Polish Club - just tradition, perhaps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even 4@H doomed here|pg||
nt|sharkey: @S lead needed to beat 4@H|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Another hand where you need the spade ruff|pg||
nt|jaapfr: had only 9!!|pg||
nt|jtr: Switch is more practicable|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@s?:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sure N to throw a @C if W not @HQ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: makes 6@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure why N didnt just continue diamonds. leading 2 rounds of spades was costly|pg||
nt|peachy: I am trying to get help for the opearator to clear up some of the board results|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: very solid result in the other room for n/s maybe i can raise the flag again|pg||
nt|pelu: need a friendly lay-out in @Cs|pg||
nt|sharkey: Forrester opened OR - still cudnt get there|pg||
nt|othered1: That's 800 on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Take it and run|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4D seems like the call to make....let S decide whether or not to save|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk4: The scores on the board make little sense, and here is why ...|pg||
nt|pelu: aggresiv 1@S by Hachett in East|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure - E gets to ruff one @C and can get home on low @H?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry reply to spec saying declarer a bad player whilst not claiming 10 tr previous board|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh 1@s only|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you all bid 1@s as N? 1@d for me|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Very popular to bypass diamonds when you only may have one bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S is normal playing Walsh|pg||
mb|p|nt|vinbtech: 1C= precision or some some such ART club|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt here?|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://slavacup.ru/reglament.htm|pg||
nt|dburn: dyed-in-the-wool pessimists would pass those North cards at this point|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: it was a claim, don't know what happend, but zia said "down one" in last board|pg||
nt|sharkey: An no @H lead vs 3 NT|pg||
nt|pelu: only Fredin-Nilsson bid and maded the slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS have to be careful not to block the @H suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless in their methods 5D= "i have five diamonds":)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzcx: hehe you can say Gudni|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N managed to buy the contract on previous board in 1@S so a likely 5 imp swing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The results of rounds in IMPs will be converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. In calculating the datum score (= average score) on each board, about 50% (but not more) of the scores (a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: quarter from the top and a quarter from the bottom) will not be taken into account|pg||
nt|dburn: this, though, is the wrong tempo - now if North bids 5@d East-West will double him|pg||
nt|jtr: @d overtaken and @s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DK @DA overtake @SA @SK x@S for -1|pg||
nt|sharkey: This won't make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: some 70% i quess|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|jtr: Zia lying low|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@D pass or S 3@C?|pg||
nt|drewsky: I think passing 2@C is normal with the north cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: it looked like -2 from here|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 out of 5 in 6@s so far|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Also with several forms of check back you can play 2@D if partner rebids 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: i doubt you will win here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  But it is cheaper than 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: but one thing Roy Welland is not, is a dyed-in-the-wool pessimist|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: and all agreed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: i think so, -2|pg||
nt|hedyg: then it is -1 |pg||
nt|ralfwil: as on board 27, I like to open on a 5431-distribution with 2 aces and a rather good 5-card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One way of seeing it; another is that 4@D makes it easier for EW to judge|pg||
mb|2N|nt|yo_yo: that's quite a hunky 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|yo_yo: chunky|pg||
nt|dburn: well, at least they avoided the 3-3 diamond fit, but...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt+2 most likely|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S has a vey good chance to be made here|pg||
nt|dburn: and if he doesn't, then East-West will pick up a pretty good result|pg||
nt|po-s: long ago we met a Polish pair in the European, and my partner asked abt a "free" bid - and the opponent answered "unlimited" - It turned out he meant downwards|pg||
nt|athene: hahahaha|pg||
nt|athene: that's a good one :) i must remember that|pg||
nt|rnmalik: great|pg||
nt|athene: such a useful interpretation - for example "i have unlimited faith in teammates not to screw up our good set"|pg||
nt|jtr: 'garbage' stayman?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H easy to beat but 5@C here better|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@H showing short @H and game values - max 3@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: previous board the problem was that W was before 5@H not aware of the 4514 at least not the @D misfit imo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: W sweating now:)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Even if he does not overtake what else can west switch to?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true too|pg||
nt|sharkey: thinking 5@D....|pg||
nt|jtr: he doesnt like it|pg||
nt|jtr: But at red will pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - alternative may cost more...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pls give the link again|pg||
nt|sharkey: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r7.htm|pg||
nt|sharkey: Click on flashing Green light on Round 7 for board update|pg||
nt|jaapfr: has W name a meaning as  smooth (phonetically it sounds like that?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in Polish i meant|pg||
nt|sharkey: Burden on Zmudzinski - just back from a tough loss in the NEC Cup|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway he does not feel ""smooth"" rite now:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Probably wondering if there's a better way to spend Sunday morning in Moscow...|pg||
nt|jtr: Afternoon:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: it is a team event|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont know why someone cant bid @cs|pg||
nt|pelu: Forrester - Malinowsky in 3Nt - making :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Nice bidding by EW|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib advises lead OR @HK and @S switch...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: This is an annual event that has been set up in memory of Russian bridge player Slava Grinuk, who died at the age of 30. Slava was very fond of bridge, so a group of his friends ...|pg||
nt|xenya: (who didn't play bridge themselves) decided that the best way to commemorate him would be to hold an annual  bridge tournament in his honour. |pg||
nt|jtr: 2@h can show a weak hand with both majors|pg||
nt|jtr: either way round|pg||
nt|sharkey: View NS can only lead @S twice regardless of lead think it was always a make - previous hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh wow|pg||
nt|sharkey: Sry David - time flies when you have fun :)|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -500 due to the first X imo|pg||
nt|xenya: looks fairly routine to get to 4@S here -- but there is no play for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The Law of Total Tricks also does not help in this 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surprising previous board where Zia bid Grand; four other scores reported none bid Grand!|pg||
nt|jtr: North might maybe?:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :) good one|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@H = singleton and both minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/y8rdsoc  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|rnmalik: system:)|pg||
nt|po-s: somehow it seems a waste to use 1NT for 20+ hands; they are so infrequent - and you must then create unclear (two-threeway) bids for all other hands|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y is only one real Zia: S:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welland must remember to claim his 100 honours|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5D makes it even easier for them to judge, it usually endplays them into doubling. also, i think 5D should have more shape than one crummy doubleton|pg||
nt|othered1: And double of 4@D is either responsive, or much more flexible than double of 5|pg||
nt|othered1: We've seen throughout this event that north isn't afraid to take views.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the only hope for Zia is that @hA is off side, and 6@h can be made|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as spec notes, the 5D bid caught S with 6 diamonds and not much defense, exactly when you would expect it to win, and yet it is still the losing call|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 1@D did already show 5+, so Roy knew they had at least 10 between them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Otherwise he would never have bid 5@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ten, sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: ok so it resembles a "D" good to gnow! and I assume you are a she?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: *know|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If someone had to play for my life ....it would be Zia, a spectator tells me. Not a bad choice I would say :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: results: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7 imps gain|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1700??|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: this looks a good spot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C shows 15+hcp. Thanks to Thomas Bobik|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW use Precison 2@C opening|pg||
nt|rnmalik: identical bidding in both the rooms and result as well|pg||
nt|paulhac:  441614461138 (will be here for 1 hour)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 5@d for @sQ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: With this hand type Welland would only bid 1@D if he was strong enough to force to game|pg||
nt|hedyg: what was 2@c?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|po-s: It looks like 3H was a splinter...|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: new operator :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: heart contract does well if club q is found and dimaond ruff is not found!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they have got this played by West - so it might make|pg||
nt|po-s: interesting lead - if we assume that opps do´t have 44 in a major then West must have 4+ hearts but may only have 3 spades|pg||
nt|rnmalik: nice one still enjoying:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, declarer can play @cs from hand to stop South getting in twice|pg||
nt|sharkey: After @HA NS will find their @C ruff for off 2|pg||
nt|drewsky: perfect defense beats this 3 for +500 EW|pg||
nt|jtr: Doesnt 4@h make?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: N 10 sec thinking after 4@S?|pg||
nt|dburn: neither, of course, is Zia, so the final contract was inevitable|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi, we feel sorry for the "old" one, it is hard first day!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We understand, spectators too, I'm sure|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: could make a couple of overtricks here as the cards lie favorably|pg||
nt|jtr: He was thinking of bidding @cs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: to please you:)?|pg||
nt|jtr: Of course|pg||
nt|rnmalik: should have been in 6|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|chick: best lead, get @DAK+ruff, a trump trick, and the @HA|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: Zia has dropped the glass|pg||
nt|drewsky: @D, @D ,@D ruff, heart to ace, @D ruff with king@S, and sit back for trump trick with Q10 @S !|pg||
nt|chick: lucky for N that the trump A is in the same hand as the singleton @D|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mcarroll: Now likely to make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: unlikely tho for 4H to be misdefended here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I think 16+ 1@C|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: and with 3-3 clubs, making|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|vinbtech: should E be bidding 3H here?|pg||

nt|mmmakela: only 1 ot|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Defence over|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Zia loves his nines, so a partner in solidarity would play nine of clubs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Need to quess @CKx to make|pg||
nt|hedyg: ( they play 1NT f1)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: it will:)|pg||
nt|chick: not now :(|pg||
nt|dburn: not a bad contract in the abstract, but in the concrete it ain't so hot|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mcarroll: W should have put in the @C ten, allowing partner the option of overtaking to give a @D ruff|pg||
nt|po-s: this is interesting - 5D and 4S depend on who has the club king (apart from the rest of the conditions - NS should bid 5D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or rather, need to guess location of club ten. just another game on a finesse|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can you translate that pls:)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|jaapfr: not needed|pg||
nt|jtr: He will ruff it though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he means that asof trick two, 3N is in concrete galoshes:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Marshall :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||
nt|dburn: that is: in theory (the abstract) the contract had some play, but in reality (the concrete) it will go down a bundle|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ty|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 17-15 close|pg||
nt|yusufb: x igrenc hiç bi ele üzülmedim bu el yýktý beni|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very useful @H109|pg||
nt|jaapfr: only 3@H to lose not 1@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect North will play @HA and a low one|pg||
nt|po-s: please!!! normally it is a small heart, and normally opponents will get in somewhere and can cash the hearts - and if East´s high cards are al elsewhere 5D will make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hoping South has Q98x or similar|pg||
nt|sharkey: Agree Jaap - and I think they wud have beaten 4@H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: srslorryall have to dre. |pg||
nt|xenya: 5 now -- 2 tables left|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia needs to pull a rabbit out of the hat here|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h7|nt|mmmakela: sryyyyyyyyy|pg||
nt|chick: depends on what finesses he takes ... got the hearts right so far|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems a shame not to bid those @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: claim|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe not, but if partner has four hearts (and three clubs) then both 3@h and 3@c might make|pg||
nt|paulhac:  3@S looks a bit of an underbid but maybe it was because of the vulnerability|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jaapfr: think other table declarer blew up the 3@S with play of @SK too early|pg||
nt|jaapfr: at least DD:)|pg||
nt|xenya: he hasn't got either i'm afraid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a push indeed|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chick: now clubs |pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: Here 8 tricks appears cold - shud be matter of overtrick...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: do you understand why N bids 2@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume S has shown garbage hand with @H & @S - N corrects to get lead into his hand...|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sharkey: Thus 2@S from Zia wud have shown different hand...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ty specs i got it:)|pg||
nt|dburn: from now on I promise to confine myself to monosyllables|pg||
nt|pelu: actual standing in 'our'matck 45-15 for EW|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rnmalik:  no endplay even with A@C in W|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jaapfr: so -300 not so bad whilst i must agree with David 4@H very probably will be made|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mmmakela: thought E got the spade ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: no problem hehe|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jaapfr: 17-16 even|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jaapfr: just as: sharp 3nt|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@D other room an overbid:)?|pg||
nt|dburn: such as "pearls" "fore" and "swine"|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jtr: Yes, i play the same with 2@s showing 5-4 and an invite|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: well, North can see the singleton @HK in dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sharkey: shud make 10 now?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|po-s: but I perhaps East could have 3136 as 2D was probably only a relay|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jaapfr: 1@S1@H4@D and 3!@C so unbeatable even with x@H lead imo|pg||

nt|chick: partscores best possible here :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Welland was not sure of single @S with P|pg||
nt|athene: quite hard for north to bid at the 5-level with no shortage and a lot of defence|pg||
nt|paulhac:  E/W can make 5@S and N/S 5@D and might easily make 6D as it is tough to defend|pg||
nt|jaapfr: verzeihung ich verstehen dass dass slecht war fur EW:(|pg||
nt|jtr: Good save in 5@s|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Sorry 4@S|pg||
nt|chick: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_card|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so far:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk4: 4@H might depend on getting clubs right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D makes as well|pg||
nt|athene: zia had the stiff spade but he had only five diamonds - not easy at all|pg||
nt|solex33: 3 rounds of h defeats 5 dia. regardless the pos of k of c|pg||
nt|jtr: If 4@h was making this would probably be 800|pg||
nt|jtr: True, 6@d will probably make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a bundle includes also 1:)?|pg||
nt|pelu: a 'small' misscore on this board in rsult: 5@D making by S? Table 7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can Zia and Roy lose this?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, the claim showed  1700|pg||
nt|po-s: -1700 would have been VERY unlucky|pg||
mb|3C|an|! nf|nt|mmmakela: in precision that used to be a club opening in the old days|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bet east will go to game|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @HA x@H x@S then it could down?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting choice for East|pg||
nt|dburn: here is a slightly somewhat quite very lucky slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - only lost one round - previous one 28-32|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yo_yo: it was quite nice for declarer when South tackled trumps|pg||
nt|vinbtech: y the result justified 3H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you subscribe to the Principle of Restricted Choice, you will get it right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lets see |pg||
nt|athene: it all depends what 4@H promises - i suppose the usual rule "don't pre-empt over a pre-empt" applies here, so 4@H is a real hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry kibs - I don't speak Italian or Turkish....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: scowl back for links specs pls|pg||
nt|Walddk5: On the other hand, if they really bid to 6@D, how many spade tricks do you think you can cash?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: don't know way, sorry )|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yo_yo: a fit jump?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: a fit jump more likely |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very good hans for 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S is reasonable, but what about 5@S? Would that be the same as a 5@S opening  bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry for confusion i referred to x@H lead as unbeatable but with @HA x@H and @S switch it was DD down|pg||
nt|jaapfr: team 1 will gain here|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not a fan of 1NT but Welland is a law unto himself|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: "precision" has so many variations that its very name is a contradiction :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tony Forrester did in the other room with no opponent bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_restricted_choice_(bridge)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's even more evident here where Kwiecien has shown a two-suiter by opening 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR the @D-lead gave Forrester a help to "see" 2 x singleton by West - with singleton @H (and no bid) u would not play the @Cs right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@S pls|pg||
nt|athene: maybe not quite as real as 3@S would be, but still real-ish|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 3@s would be bid on most "real hands" - 4@h is something like a decent limit raise|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i can help whilst West speaksDutch fluently:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi ivan|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia helped EW getting @S suit into play...|pg||
nt|jtr: Heading to 4@s|pg||

nt|jaapfr: ty Carl:)|pg||
nt|chick: at IMPs, do you pass 2@C, bid 2@D, or bid 2@S?|pg||
nt|drewsky: Anyone wodering how they made 12 tricks at the other table ?|pg||
nt|pelu: until now they only had one round belove average (28-32 against Forrester)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H is not without risk|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: well, the scores from THIS table are correct :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: oops|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y 6@C has a chance specs but will not be bid:) imo|pg||
nt|xenya: on the surface, 6@C looks tempting|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D chance they go higher than in OR|pg||
nt|xenya: but is likely to fail|pg||
nt|paulhac:  6 @C Needs a lot of work|pg||
nt|jaapfr: is it so slow today? yesterday fast enough|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not the best spot, but may make...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: *why|pg||
nt|Walddk2: np|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: hand|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r8.htm  for running scores|pg||
nt|drewsky: 4NT by Zia here is natural, but if he passes and THEN bids 4NT after partner doubles, pehaps he would be showing 6-4 in the minors|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe you dont know if they are bidding to make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Zia taking him seriously|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: There's no Four-and-a-half spades card in the bidding box |pg||
nt|jtr: E/W are not the quickest|pg||
nt|jtr: I uess hey are though|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I think von Arnim will lead @HA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway the specs do lead @HA:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Me too|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @HA or @SA|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Is it clear to lead the A@H on this auction I am not so sure|pg||
nt|drewsky: I agree woth Paul...not so clear|pg||
nt|chick: as do I|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok specs bet on @SA or @HA or else?|pg||
nt|jtr: God knows why Welland bid it|pg||
nt|drewsky: Peter Fredin led a low heart from AKx on the go :)|pg||
nt|po-s: competitors don´t seem to do very well either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here we have the sound raise again|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzdp: you can find current results here: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I bet Zia will get it right too if 4@H is the final destination|pg||
nt|jaapfr: vwd 5@S bid|pg||
nt|dburn: they might get to seven at this rate|pg||
nt|athene: certainly interesting that zia bids 5@C instead of 4@S - i wonder if it's a "help-suit slam try" rather than a normal control-bid|pg||
nt|dburn: that is how Zia prefers to play, certainly|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Roy trying to evaluate his Q@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D finesse working can't pitch the 5th@C|pg||
nt|dburn: but for 6@c he ought to have rather better clubs - if I were Welland I would be giving serious thought to bidding seven|pg||
nt|po-s: x,Axxxx,Ax,AKJxx|pg||
nt|athene: zia needs a lot opposite for seven - @HKQ, @SA, @CK and more - that would be a 3@S bid not a 4@H bid surely|pg||
nt|dburn: still, even @sNone @hAJxxx @dAxx @cAKJxx is not a grand slam, so he may settle for six|pg||
nt|athene: (i mean zia doesn't need the @SA but he knows his partner has it, so that just means he hasn't got something else that *is* needed)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|chick: if you think you are not getting any spade tricks, then @HA is not enough to set this|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4-3-2|pg||
nt|jtr: But the @hK reckons to be in dummy if anywhere|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4-5-2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tell us pls|pg||
nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: normal enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: normal?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes apparently wasnt sure which honor they lead from that holding...|pg||
nt|dburn: strict third and fifth, they play in Sweden|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: well that sure was strict|pg||
nt|drewsky: last time my partner did that dummy had Jxx and I played my nine from Q9xx.....|pg||
nt|hedyg: oy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N better but this is obviously a good spot|pg||
nt|dburn: in Poland, however, they play middle from three cards, so if Malinowski leads a heart at all, it may not be the five|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i repay the  1000000 if he lkeads @H5 as well:)|pg||
nt|drewsky: stop..tell west I will offer 500,000 if he leads a low heart...|pg||
nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||
nt|dburn: not that he will necessarily lead a heart - he may play partner for a singleton club and a fast spade trick|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i must refing that spec offering me 1000000 if not @HA was lead against 6@D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: refind|pg||
nt|dburn: and one of the opponents for a singleton heart, in which case a club lead is entirely logical|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont bother Jaap|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, the bidding does not appear to be over|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: running score at http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Ivan|pg||
nt|jaapfr: after long thinking he passes:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low heart lead is not totally crazy on this auction, only dangerous. Peter was undoubtedly thinking they will probably need 3 heart tricks, in which case low is best when dummy has ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: queen and does no harm when E does|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Ivan tell us what happens?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: is he to the toilet?|pg||
nt|hedyg: afraid i must go now, ty all, enjoy|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: welland close his ears and try to concentrate|pg||
nt|jaapfr: bye|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: difficult decision|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess this is one of these 2/1 positions - no one got to make a limit bid yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: bye Jaap|pg||
nt|dburn: Zia would bid 4@s with such as @sKQxxx @hx @dQxx @cAxxx|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i stay ivan:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: oh, im gld)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Every time I respond 1@H with those cards, partner's next bid is 3@D or 2NT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jaapfr: a @H lead against 6@C would be helpful:) lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud be off 1|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Certainly  a better spot than 4@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt much better than 4@S imo|pg||
nt|sharkey: Superior contract this time - the fillers making the difference|pg||
nt|jtr: @c guess needed But he needs the entry to get it right|pg||
nt|sharkey: Problem if he plays on @S suit vs @C suit?|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh dear|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@S now|pg||

nt|jaapfr: and i meant E not N|pg||

nt|po-s: there go a bunch of losers maybe|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mmmakela: E promising clubs with dbl so maybe 3 nt by south was the right bid, n must have some stuff in majors and often a 4th dia|pg||

nt|rnmalik: plausible reasoning and a finesse involved|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Could  But even if Zia had AKxxxx@C and AD he is still a trick short|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D temporising saying "i can't bid seven but i don't want to shut up shop" - that has to mean good trumps i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: it can't be a control as he bid 5@S over 5@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: she would but @HQJTX told her not to bid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: such as is a marvellous fit   agree?|pg||
nt|varange: hi|pg||
nt|sharkey: S will ask for @S shift on running the @C - NS shud get max here I think|pg||
nt|paulhac:  well noone doubled|pg||
nt|ralfwil: is this possible on a cross ruff now? Looks like that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe he can come to 10 tricks actually. The cards fit very well|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@h was a weak bid so X was not strong and Q@D not worth much in the N hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mmmakela: *6th dia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: all other leads 6@C probably down|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Makes on a coss ruff but is that really the right line?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: buut maybe in their methods he would bid 3H with that hand over 2C|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|pelu: here he know @S+@D by West|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then 1 imp the 2nt joke:)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  It looked very tough|pg||
nt|chick: still has to guess clubs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: one spec did bet $1000000 on @HA lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W could X 1@H, no|pg||
nt|chick: that as well as a junky spade suit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: thin but could|pg||
nt|jaapfr: X 1@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, he has 10 on cross-ruff|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jtr: 4 tricks vs 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only guessing|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm  for standings after Round 7|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume 1@C shows 11-19 and min 2@C?|pg||
nt|peachy: this will be a nice pickup for the trailing team|pg||
pc|cA|nt|po-s: I think Zia had a fortunate escape here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good afternoon|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it takes a lot of courage to pull partner's double with the South hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: made easy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slightly lucky escape:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Anybody 3@S with East's hand?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we share|pg||
nt|rnmalik: All specs satisfied with @H switch|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jaapfr: but is the non cross ruff an attractive alternative (i doubt that)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: problmaking now|pg||
nt|chick: that's enough to travel to his home to collect|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He wanted to get out of it cheaply, and undoubled, but 3@C would likely have achieved the same|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jtr: Fu thought about it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: no entry left if ever for long @D in E|pg||
nt|sharkey: Playing @H first took out East's entry|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry Jaap|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet|pg||
nt|jtr: Well,they can endplay dummy|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Zia will solve that D:)|pg||
nt|dburn: even Zia is not allowed to solve declarer's problems when he is dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: it is true that he usually has the solution afterwards, but for the moment he needs to keep it to himself|pg||
nt|jtr: West indicated @ss with the @h4|pg||
nt|chmitty: 1540 already seen twice at other tables|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: E got an opportunity to bid 1S OR - Welland's 1 NT overcall prevented that|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i suppose 2@S meant inviting and balanced|pg||
nt|sharkey: Assume showing suit and good hand Jaap?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: do not ask me:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|po-s: so if South is in after 4 spades - no he isn´t|pg||
nt|solex33: true. zia needs a lot for 7-  6 c prob means: "did u pd- by chance- forgot to bid 3s ? "|pg||
nt|dinos1: wd bid 4@s with @h singleton? having dbl fit?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: partner is a PH and will pass 3C 99% of the time|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mmmakela: ok forget all I wrote|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ask David|pg||
nt|sharkey: ok - since we're on the assuming track....|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR a 1S-lead did the work for defense|pg||
nt|peachy: and last board at this table|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I would after 1@D opening|pg||
nt|bucheister: unlucky slam does not make; pretty good slam|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: regardless of the outcome, it's a fine effort by EW |pg||
nt|jtr: I guess they play 2NT as minor(s) and dont want to bid 2@c without a major|pg||
nt|jaapfr: any spec KNOW what 2@S meant?|pg||
nt|jtr: ergo 2@s invite with no major|pg||
nt|dburn: depends to an extent on what 1@c meant|pg||
nt|jtr: now dummy could get squeezed|pg||
nt|hedyg: i expected a @s switch|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he would, but maybe he would not - someone has got to show a minimum sometime|pg||
nt|hedyg: if not lead...|pg||
nt|po-s: he plays it well...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jaapfr: we did see in the Zia room today a lot of fireworks so ill be this 6@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now only rite play in @C and home|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jaapfr: votes specs pls make or down???|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2-4|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@s could be "either invitational in notrump or a sign-off in clubs", if the full system is on|pg||
nt|dburn: poor Zia - about to get endplayed and squeezed, and he is only the dummy|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, Welland is left with no option now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i fail to see any problem for declarer as long as he plays @CK with E|pg||
nt|po-s: of course he has an option - he can play either club from his hand - and still make|pg||
nt|jtr: Say it is Kxx though?|pg||
nt|jtr: West just puts dummy in|pg||
nt|po-s: yes?|pg||
nt|jtr: If he can of course|pg||
nt|po-s: he cashes his clubs|pg||
nt|jtr: H9@s and they effectively cannot|pg||
nt|jtr: who does?|pg||
nt|po-s: assuming he plays the wrong club from hand, gets blocked but cashes the 3rd club then a spade?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can anyone tell W it makes no difference:) Ivan:)??|pg||
nt|peachy: it surely is, just need 3-2 hearts|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jaapfr: D 5 specs KNOW you were rite:)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If @D8 is to believed to be an "honest" card, Jagniewski has shown an odd number of diamonds. They play upside-down count|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Rest assured that Zia will have noticed|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jaapfr: 5-12|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Maybe a heart finesse to get rid of the spade is a possible line|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 16-31 if counted correctly|pg||
nt|hedyg: Welland working on saving his 10@s|pg||
nt|pelu: after @CK decl han a return on a @c-ruff and can ruff 2 x @D in dummy|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jtr: Nice 10|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think better take @SAK and 4 x @D pitch @H|pg||
nt|paulhac:  When you are in form everything you touch turns to gold|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: we'll be back in about 90 minutes|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: here the count-signal is only a help for decl|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like a curious push|pg||
mc|9|nt|yo_yo: @d behave so all is well|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 19-34 final no other bets|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 20-38 stopppppppppppppppppppppppp pls|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i vote makes:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm|pg||
nt|rnmalik: best of luck:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty David - we needed that clarification...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: link for overall standings is ??|pg||
nt|po-s: nice unblock in spades, should he need an entry on the spade 8|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Not so good PO if a club had been returned and teh Q played he would have gone down|pg||
nt|jtr: Declarer next door played on @ss|pg||
nt|paulhac:  But I agree with you in principle|pg||
nt|chick: specs seem to think that zia cannot possibly get the clubs wrong, and looks like they were right|pg||

nt|athene: you can do the same thing with blackwood - ask for the trump queen, partner says he hasn't got it, so you sign off in six|pg||
nt|solex33: or dont dbl|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another one in minors now|pg||

nt|drewsky: Everyone is a world class player when they can see all the hands :)|pg||

nt|dburn: at any rate, Welland solved his bidding problem, Malinowski solved his lead problem, and we can all go back to "what's the problem?"|pg||

nt|vugraphzdp: live results|pg||
nt|po-s: hard to beat that result from closed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: when I made that observation of -1, he had ruffed a @D with 10@C|pg||
nt|jtr: Even so, the @cQ gives him a maximum and the contract makes anyway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think that a better defence is to play @s every time N is on lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yes, 9 imps on board 1 when NS sacrificed in 5@Dx|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes north bid his weaker suit|pg||
nt|po-s: good start|pg||
nt|paulhac:  That helps|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Last board of the match now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: that kind of 3-way 2@C  opening isn't allowed in many countries because itdoesn't include an anchor suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Vladimir|pg||
nt|po-s: or are they barred from having an ace|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|sharkey: ouch - getting too high now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: there I agree:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: some pairs play a special sort of blackwood after a pre-empt|pg||
nt|athene: since partner is known to have nothing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and Carl?\|pg||
nt|chick: one spec suggests that E should X to suggest a non-@S lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 9 sessions Ivan and still waiting for your first misclick:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Results and scores: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm    Click on green light Round 12 for board updates|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good effort by Gromov-Dubinin to bid this slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last round scheduled to start in 15 mins. Slight delay likely|pg||
nt|peachy: operator has now checked the scores, FYI to spectators who have been concerned|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mcarroll: The Open room started 3 boards behind us and has now caught up and is even ahead. They play this hand in 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D says "what flavour of nothing do you have here partner?"|pg||
nt|granguru: EW can make 2@C|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - much easier with all hands in view - also very difficult to defend |pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe he played too quickly?:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: previous hand|pg||
nt|xenya: There will be  a break for dinner now. Play will resume in about an hour and half. Stay tuned|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another bad board for the leaders|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me a strange 3@c-opening|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: 2@D =?|pg||
nt|po-s: how much is 4D RD 12 or 13 tricks?|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|granguru: only a @C lead can beat|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Same auction here it seems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Andrew Robson--frequent partner of Zia--once ran a series of articles in one of his columns on playing 4-3 fits. I wonder if that hand will appear in the next installment of the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: series? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welland could not even be certain that they had the kind of fit, the best possible on the auction |pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava10/slava10t16r.htm  for standings|pg||

nt|sharkey: 2@D first I think|pg||
nt|jtr: well 4@s sort of|pg||
nt|granguru: which can also be made|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@H must be weak invite i think|pg||

nt|vugraphzdp: i am sorry )|pg||
nt|jaapfr: another 9 imps expected|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if -3|pg||
nt|chick: for a vulnerable 1st seat, the (equivalent of) weak 2@H bid was a bit suicidal|pg||

nt|jaapfr: develop @D  for simple make here|pg||
nt|dburn: may not have been a good moment for 2@h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: pass|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: now it is clear after @H and @S bids and instead of DBL N could bid 4NT with that hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Only a 5 imp swing I miscounted the undertricks in the Open|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my quess team 2 to win this with 1 imp:)|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: bye and quick recovery |pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5 matches of 8 boards today, 6 tomorrow and 4 on Monday. I believe the upcoming Monday is a public holiday in Russia. Maybe Vladimir can confirm|pg||
nt|xenya: actually the holiday is on 23rd, but Monday is a non- working day too|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Non-working non-holiday, I like those :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: big loss here|pg||
nt|po-s: 2D was a clever bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: this 3nt is wrong sided|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but still leads @D|pg||
nt|xenya: previous hand should produce a great score for NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx all and for sure Ivan is really the greatest (family of Alexander:)?|pg||
nt|athene: asking for a diamond lead against 6nt if partner has @DAK, maybe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: specs previous board was meant that discarding a @H by W could only give the contract of 2nt away and could never be winning as JTR explained N could have had @CAQ then 2nt makes ...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and if not @CQ then easy to discard  a @C and even @CK could not to be trown in|pg||
nt|jtr: South didnt read the lead next door|pg||
nt|jaapfr: about the misclick:)?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s= @c or invite hand, 3@c= maximum|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right, the example hand i gave would have been a 4-1 fit. Andrew hasn't broached that topic yet as far as i know:)|pg||

pc|d4|nt|mmmakela: some taps coming up|pg||

nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|solex33: maybe a mixture of lead directing and take-out ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: thx all|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks and C..................U.|pg||
nt|po-s: is there more today?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: no, that was last segment today|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: next segment starts tommorow in 11 msk time|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: I'll be gald to see you all tommorow )|pg||
nt|jtr: But it should still go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: we play round robim|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Interestingly 6D was bid 4 times and only 1 player found the heart lead so if the experts found it tough who are we to argue|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: after round 7 all russian pairs played against each other|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: the same with polish pairs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and operator:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: This 3@C opening 2nd hand is not my cup of tea|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rnmalik: well done:)|pg||
nt|chick: you think other planets play bridge better than Earth?  :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Easy to play with the A@D right might have had more problems if it had been wrong|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jaapfr: aha even make chances indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: we will be back shortly -- stay tuned |pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia won't let go now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i thought Mike was unusually quiet :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If ever there is a case for a trump lead, this is the auction. Even Bill and D Bird would lead one, don't you think, David?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@S, as in OR, is more to my liking; 4333 and Qs and Js detracts from the hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: although that may be a bit double-dummy|pg||
nt|jtr: Bill maybe|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS shud take the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|jtr: It is a religious thing with Bird though i think|pg||
nt|dburn: Zhao perhaps a little unlucky not to find Fu with a three-card major after the opponents had started 1@c-1NT|pg||
nt|jtr: He can only lead trumps on thursdays|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if so then 17-12|pg||
nt|granguru: the whole day?|pg||
nt|dburn: for all that, his @cQ wasn't a bad feature for playing in clubs, so he might not have run|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although not sure comparison is with allother ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good bridge, many doubles and redoubles|pg||
nt|jtr: Up until 10pm|pg||
nt|sharkey: Roland will explain the scoring method I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The results of rounds in IMPs will be converted to VPs using a 60:0 scale. In calculating the datum score (= average score) on each board, about 50% (but not more) of the scores (a ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: quarter from the top and a quarter from the bottom) will not be taken into account|pg||
nt|granguru: a heard a nice tip about leading trumps. If you are going to lead trumps before count up to ten..|pg||
nt|granguru: if that doesnt work..then count up to hundred|pg||
nt|jtr: Does Welland think Zia has doubled with xx?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk5: and the two English pairs met in round 1 yesterday|pg||
nt|dburn: still, this may be down only two against a game|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzdp: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: all )|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx ivan and all|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
nt|xenya: There will be a break for dinner now. Play will resume in about an hour and half|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zia - Welland has regained the lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I think there is another segment to follow in SLAVA CUP|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: skip to board 21|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2H|mb|d|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: strange bid|pg||
nt|dburn: probably not the real auction - we may be some way behind the play here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ahha|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: oh, I see - if 1@d showed spades, then it was indeed the real auction|pg||
nt|mcarroll: somewhat offcentre NT opening in Open|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: Sorry to the specs; cannot figure out the play for you; I will just stay quiet and you can watch.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|peachy: same for me, the operator is doing the best he can, it is his first time.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|dburn: but if 1@D showed spades, it seems odd that East didn't bid over it|pg||
nt|dburn: given that he seems to bid over almost everything else|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes he can x 1@S|pg||
nt|vinbtech: the major Ks sitting pretty for declarer !|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: but not 1D is if's natural|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: Courtney off for a pit stop|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|s3|nt|dburn: at any rate, his side didn't find the vulnerabl sacrifice located at the other table|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so a big board for the Grant Thornton team|pg||
nt|dburn: which became a better sacrifice still when no one doubled it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: have you been to Iceland David?|pg||
nt|dburn: no, but I would like to visit sometime|pg||

nt|chick: so Gudmunder pulling out to a big lead with only 2 more boards to compare|pg||
nt|dburn: still, South would probably not sit for 5@h, doubled or not - he would bid 5@s and then it would be a question of finding a club ruff to beat it|pg||

nt|yo_yo: in the other room @D10|pg||
nt|yo_yo: played by west|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mmmakela: not back but NEXT|pg||
nt|dburn: better contract than at the other table, but four rounds of clubs will enable West's @d8 to take a trick|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|mmmakela: so gave the 9th|pg||
nt|chick: he can't look for overtricks now, club finesse out, so will just have to claim 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: there is a change in declarers as the hand was played 3NT by w in the OR and was -1 here is being playeed by E |pg||

nt|mmmakela: A or K was needed for the lead|pg||
