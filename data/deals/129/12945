nt|minimonkey:  What level of opener will we get here|pg||
nt|roswolf: multi or mouldy berg?|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  A weak 2 in hearts is the minimum but the extra offense of having a void and being at the right colours might make this a 3H bid|pg||
nt|galadriel: 2|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|galadriel: might he get to play there?|pg||

mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I am not in least bit keen on this double |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jackthelad: did the job though|pg||
nt|garnetts: virtually a forced 3NT from North which can be made |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: But not at all convinced it will be |pg||
pc|sT|nt|garnetts: My point is that there is no need to double as partner can still balance |pg||
nt|garnetts: But of course we always have the clever lead to consider |pg||
nt|h_karluk: John or Brian Short? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Brian|pg||
nt|garnetts: on a heart lead it would take some inspired declarer play|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then south is David |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yo_yo: this should play pretty quickly|pg||

pc|d3|pc|h5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am okay with fast, however i prefer accuracy|pg||
nt|garnetts: so do I looking at all four hands but from Norths viewpoint he needs five club tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Lots of questions fromj Brian about the initial lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: The game seems to be over complicated for too many people--like leading your long suit against no-trumps--why bother when you lead something else|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yo_yo: i would draw trumps and claim|pg||
nt|yo_yo: +1|pg||

nt|minimonkey:  NS are playing a multi|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  so this is an easy 2D opener I think|pg||
nt|galadriel: These are tricky hands for 10a.m.!|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|minimonkey:  N will probably be able to guess which major|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|minimonkey:  I like 2H bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|galadriel: Great when you have to bid your void:)|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  3NT not likely to play well on a max combined 25|pg||
pc|d2|nt|minimonkey:  and as I said before when one hand is weak and has a long suit it is often best to play in that suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: brb|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  How to play this heart suit for the minimum number of losers is something I dont know|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  any opinions|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  I guess on this hand though you play to ruff spades in hand|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think he will just try to ruff some @S s|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  and then cash the reminging winners and exit something and force the opponents to finesse for you|pg||
