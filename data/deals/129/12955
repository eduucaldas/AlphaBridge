nt|athene: i don't think blackwood really told west what he wanted to know|pg||
nt|athene: slam could still have been good after the 5@H bid|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he decided he wanted to be there facing @HAK @SA, and not otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that's a reasonable practical view to take but it doesn't leave south much for his 2@D bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  2N IS OBVIOUSLY FORCING  and probably asks about 4 card support and min/max|pg||
nt|athene: so the chances are you are just going to end up playing 5@H rather than 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|henryb:  probably Liggins showed a minimum with 3 card spade support|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|henryb:  I doubt that it actually showed clubs|pg||
nt|athene: if west finds his partner with four clubs, he might want to look for 6@C rather than 6@H|pg||
nt|athene: for example if east had something like @SQx @HAKJxx @Dxx @CKxxx|pg||
nt|athene: on a diamond lead you need to throw dummy's diamond loser on a heart|pg||
nt|athene: before losing the @SA|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|athene: there's no play for 6@H on a diamond lead as the spade discard for east is set up too late|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ah yes, but as a spec points out, if east has shown his clubs, that imples a stiff diamond anyway|pg||
nt|athene: *implies|pg||
nt|athene: since he has to have three spades :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|athene: when you have a 4-4 and a 5-4 fit, you sometimes prefer the 44 fit, but i don't think that applies here - even though you might be throwing two spades on hearts, that isn't ...|pg||

nt|athene: 3@D opener in the open room on board 29 showed a pre-empt in either major|pg||

mb|1H|nt|jallerton: 6@c and 6@h both possible contracts here|pg||

mb|1S|nt|athene: which led to the unusual spectacle of an 8-5 spade fit being lost|pg||
nt|justin c: the method seems rather prone to that|pg||

pc|hA|nt|athene: when your opponents make an artificial raise you can double to show the suit bid or as t/o of their actual suit|pg||
