mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|eamongall: looks like a nebulous 1@D from Fitzgibbon in the north|pg||
nt|eamongall: I was just wondering where is Mr Pigot today ...but he is probably commentating in the closed room |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: game isn't so great here but you don't mind being in it|pg||
nt|athene: i would say your expectation from being in game is probably about the same as from staying out of it|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: the @D9 isn't that much use because you can't combine chances - you have to decide whether to play them from the top or take the finesse|pg||
nt|athene: and even if the diamonds are behaving the defenders might well be able to set up enough tricks in the black suits to beat you|pg||

nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|dohicky:  Hi Mike|pg||
nt|roswolf: lucky to recover from the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what will South do over a 1@S opening - double or 2@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|garnetts: I am not in least bit keen on this double |pg||
nt|jackthelad: afternoon all.....nice little challenge for E/W here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|roswolf: heart partscore likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: did the job though|pg||
nt|garnetts: virtually a forced 3NT from North which can be made |pg||
mb|2H|nt|garnetts: But not at all convinced it will be |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: My point is that there is no need to double as partner can still balance |pg||
nt|garnetts: But of course we always have the clever lead to consider |pg||
nt|h_karluk: John or Brian Short? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Brian|pg||
nt|garnetts: on a heart lead it would take some inspired declarer play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@S here not usually played as a game try, more as a shut-out bid, to make things difficult for NS  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: then south is David |pg||
nt|Walddk1: Operator, there is no   i    in Matheson, please delete|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: this should play pretty quickly|pg||
nt|dohicky:  He shouldn't have many problems here, especially after that lead. |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|jackthelad: I think the obvious duck, then cash @c A and whoosh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D NS goes off due to the 4-1 diamond break |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: i am okay with fast, however i prefer accuracy|pg||
nt|garnetts: so do I looking at all four hands but from Norths viewpoint he needs five club tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Lots of questions fromj Brian about the initial lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: The game seems to be over complicated for too many people--like leading your long suit against no-trumps--why bother when you lead something else|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yo_yo: i would draw trumps and claim|pg||
nt|yo_yo: +1|pg||

nt|athene: i don't think anyone is bidding 3nt on this hand though :)|pg||
nt|dohicky:  no :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, certainly not NS |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east will balance with 2@D and west has to decide how much of his hand his partner has bid already|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: of course, king in each of partner's suits and a side ace is nice, but i don't think west will be envisaging game|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: ruff three spades is a good idea|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS LOOKS OK|pg||

nt|justin c: cold 6@S|pg||
nt|athene: but he doesn't have any room to show mild interest|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: several danger signs - strong diamonds opposite shortage, and relatively bad trumps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chick: 5@D has no chance, because W will lead a heart (maybe even cash a club first)|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 23 vs 17 there|pg||

nt|justin c: 5@D and 4@S both failing|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: but the problem was to find studious partner|pg||
nt|roswolf: srong club|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chick: N doesn't have much to do now ... even NT with a singleton in partner's suit isn't appealing|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@H beatable with a @D ruff|pg||
nt|justin c: neg @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: TRS - tony forrester, raymond brock, steve lodge invented a nice strong pass relay sys in that years|pg||

nt|h_karluk: nowadays i guess allowed in level 5|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@H looks pre-destined|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 2@H a lot better than a 1NT rebid|pg||

nt|roswolf: are the boards sorted now|pg||
nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this has possibilities|pg||
mb|1C|nt|dohicky:  6@s seems making but a bit unlikely :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: very possible|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jackthelad: pass is the best bid on this hand...as soon as possible|pg||
nt|justin c: wrong :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: if they play in slam it may be in @C|pg||
nt|dohicky:  NS are clearly treating the 1@c opening as natural|pg||
mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: so far 3N makeable|pg||
mb|3D|nt|garnetts: 3NT clearly makes and is likely to be bid I think|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and there's a clear danger for overboard quickly|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H makes it almost inevitable |pg||
nt|justin c: Wests hand here appears in the MSC often|pg||
nt|justin c: E will just pass this out|pg||
nt|roswolf: well double passed out likely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H best here, but how to get there?|pg||
nt|roswolf: YUP good principle|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a bit too much!?|pg||
nt|athene: west will just bid 4@S i am sure|pg||
nt|dohicky:  Well you might want to keep 2@c as Natural rather than Michaels|pg||
mb|3H|nt|justin c: My opps always bid 1NT and land on their feet|pg||
nt|roswolf: hello|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i think 3N wld save th day|pg||
nt|garnetts: There is that danger maybe East should pass 2@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: standard defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like -2 but is that enough compensation?|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT would make for EW, so 300 not wonderful here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S should be ok too.|pg||
nt|roswolf: something odd happened there:(:)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jackthelad: both pairs did well to get out quick|pg||
nt|roswolf: now if south had bid 4@H on his previous turn...............|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: 1 club was alerted I just forgot to click it so they do know|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: my crystall ball is bleak right now|pg||
nt|garnetts: Although I do not subscribe to the view that bidding shows extras|pg||
nt|athene: yes, should be 650|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: ty heather|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is becoming obscure|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ruff one club and throw club, heart on the diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: if not murky|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: thank you, partner|pg||
nt|dohicky:  Neither W or E ever showed the full strength of their hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they wont be happy but to bid any slam let alone the right one is difficult|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|pc|h3|nt|justin c: EW look close to 5@C here|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think 3@S is a poor bid--he has already shown that suit--why not 3NT it could be as is the case here a desire to hear 3NT |pg||
nt|h_karluk: exactly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 20-odd years ago I played a system where you could show a strong 6331 hand after 1M-1N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: happy days|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|jackthelad: declarer should get out for one down|pg||
nt|chick: depending on how he plays the @Ds|pg||
nt|chick: and I think on what N leads now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jackthelad: it should be obvious to the def now |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: this way you can't lead spades twice towards your hand of course|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: this is to cut ruff|pg||
pc|c8|nt|justin c: 1@S is a dogs breakfast, of course|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: but that isn't likely to help you much anyway with this suit|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: still, not at all clear what Crouch ought to have led - spade certainly reasonable, and declarer might have gone right in the suit anyway|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer gives up on that for the advantage of not having to guess the @HQ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h5|pc|d4|nt|justin c: If W doubles, time will slow down as E reaches for a 2@H card|pg||
nt|justin c: If he bids 1NT, E transfers him into @H|pg||
nt|justin c: but if you pass, you get this|pg||
nt|justin c: nothing very good for W to do|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d2|pc|c6|pc|s9|pg||

nt|justin c: try a @D finesse for -1?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: likely to do that - mind you, if he'd kept a club in dummy and not a heart, would have been a sure thing|pg||
nt|justin c: west would be squeezed here |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm |pg||
nt|roswolf: as peter lost track of the cards|pg||

nt|roswolf: perhaps 1nt by n/s here|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: spade partscore likely|pg||

mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: 3rd 3N for EW|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT is more fun|pg||

mb|p|nt|justin c: lol|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well game should be reached now south thinks his hand is worth opening|pg||
nt|dburn: a U-turn, so to speak|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt is of course the best contract|pg||
mb|1N|nt|h_karluk: likely not much than 4@s for EW|pg||
nt|jackthelad: interesting call for both E and S|pg||
nt|justin c: lots of losers in @H - EW heading overboard|pg||
nt|athene: just needs 4-3 diamonds or blockage or no diamond lead|pg||
nt|athene: east can't seriously consider 3nt here|pg||
nt|athene: he seems to be considering something, though!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: did Ciara really declare on all those hands?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: and now for N as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: you have your fun justin|pg||
nt|roswolf: club lead is effective|pg||
nt|dohicky:  yes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: well, his hand is worth opening - some play that 2@s is a sound weak two bid, but possibly not this pair|pg||
nt|justin c: my powers of analysis tell me that cashing the @HAK, @SA and @DA would beat 4@S, but not 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is frigid|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont fancy that lead will lose the tempo on most layouts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: good pass - as probably fsf in their system card|pg||
nt|jackthelad: N has no choice...2@h|pg||
nt|chick: or Pass|pg||
nt|justin c: think they play strong @C, so probably lightish openings|pg||
nt|dburn: then the rest of us can sit back and let you take over for the remainder of the match - analysis 100% so far|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzdu: Anna says the 3 spades might be a cue|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|garnetts: If north had the 9@S it would make a big difference |pg||
nt|athene: the defence will probably still get two diamonds and two trumps here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dburn: five-card majors, strong club, so West at liberty to pass out 1@h, thouhg no harm would have come to him had he bid|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|jackthelad: N will struggle to probably 8 trix|pg||

nt|athene: of course south doesn't attack diamonds - dummy is dead so declarer will lose whatever diamonds he loses, eventually|pg||

mb|1S|nt|jackthelad: how tempting is a slam here ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be trappy|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|garnetts: This is another example where 2@S by EW is a reasonable contract |pg||
nt|chick: if NS find their way to 6@H, will make on anything except a spade lead|pg||
nt|justin c: should have forced dummy to ruff a C at the end there|pg||
nt|dohicky:  Lindsay's play of the @h suit did make it look like he stated with 4 though|pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: but the key card is with E...so doomed|pg||
nt|roswolf: east staying very low|pg||
mb|2D|nt|h_karluk: moysian fit|pg||
nt|dburn: probably facing 14-16 rather than 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: EW make 3@C easily but they might not bid it so easily|pg||
nt|athene: it depends how random 1@C was|pg||

nt|dohicky:  yes|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||

pc|d4|nt|athene: if west has only two hearts he has to have one 4-card minor at least|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt was possible|pg||
nt|athene: if you need to cater for west opening 1@C on 4-2-4-3, for example|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|garnetts: He has run into a real problem because I am sure that 2@S after this sequence would show extras--therefore bid 2@S initially|pg||

nt|jackthelad: ouch !...that makes my eyes water :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well e/w not in the auction therefore no feistiness|pg||
nt|dburn: if 2@s shows, as it appears to show, spades and a minor, South may well bid a game on discovering (to his surprise) that North has clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: north for me with a 15-17 NT|pg||

nt|roswolf: incredible|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|chick: -3 undoubled unvul is not that bad|pg||
nt|dburn: apparently 2@s was spades and any other suit, and 3@s showed a maximum with spades and clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jackthelad: not for anyone with a weak constitution|pg||
nt|athene: if hearts were 5-2, declarer might give up on the spade finesse, on the basis that he can afford to lose the lead to south but not to north, so he just gives himself the extra ...|pg||
nt|athene: chance of singleton @SK offside|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|garnetts: Rolling the dice as North could lead to anything--even a slam making for EW --playing for money at green I would certainly try it|pg||

nt|mdgraham: very dangerous |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1.3% grands are my specialty|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dburn: not much wrong with 6@c that I can see - perfectly decent contract, and South does not have to worry about a heart lead through the @hAQ|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: terrible 1N overcall|pg||

mb|p|nt|jackthelad: prefer garbage stayman there|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: off one|pg||
nt|garnetts: Why not 2@C and pass a major response or correct after 2@D--unless it would be forcing |pg||
nt|jackthelad: surprising lead|pg||
nt|justin c: would have thought 2@S for W, but i dont know the system they play|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like 2NT is artificial weakness showing bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not quite sure what all this means - 3@c may have been asking in clubs, but what 4@d was I don't know (perhaps keycard Blackwood, but...)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: gulp, thinks South|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably wrongly|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: without a club lead, this does have some hope|pg||
nt|jackthelad: yep...but not a lot|pg||
nt|athene: a good illustration here of why: a) it's safer to get in early and b) you double on hands like this, especially when your overcall is the most expensive suit, so it leaves partner ...|pg||
nt|athene: with nowhere to go|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||

pc|c4|pc|d8|pg||

pc|hK|nt|jackthelad: yes|pg||
nt|dohicky:  This is making now isn't it?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|justin c: NIBU just gained a lot of points when the 'straightforward 3NT' was played in 5@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: on a spade switch declarer just plays on diamonds and west is ruffing with a winner|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think so|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in the OR  East preempted with 3@C and everyone passed|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|dburn: but to do that, you should cash @sK first, then ruff spades with the eight and king, not mess around leading low spades from dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: write down two zeroes in the minus column, and fill in the rest later|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: bloody bid|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|dburn: nor mess around leading low diamonds from hand - if you're going to play a cross-ruff, cash your high cards first|pg||

nt|justin c: 4@H for EW would be entertaining|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you have to feel sorry for South, but 3@H was not really a very good bid|pg||
nt|athene: that's why the argument "it's safe to bid after you know opps don't have game values" just isn't true - opps can stop in a partscore and still have enough to kill you stone dead|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm another potential swing hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: it's all about finding a fit and double was much more likely to find the best fit than 3@H|pg||

mb|3N|nt|chick: yes, and I kinda think if you don't lead an A, you don't have an AK|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@S by S not so entertaining at all|pg||
mb|4C|nt|dohicky:  true|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing his 2 suiter - very wise|pg||
mb|4D|nt|justin c: Headed to 2@S i guess|pg||

mb|4S|nt|jackthelad: @s win|pg||

nt|roswolf: the 9 card suit will be dummy!!!!|pg||
mb|5D|mb|5H|nt|athene: yes, and you are at the 3-level|pg||

mb|5S|nt|h_karluk: ?|pg||
nt|athene: east sure likes his hand!|pg||
nt|athene: cue-raise and then a double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: geting a few questions as to which book - Mike Lawrence, The Complete Book of Overcalls|pg||
nt|dohicky:  Probably 8 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: it could be fewer - depends how many club ruffs west gets :)|pg||
nt|dohicky:  True|pg||
nt|athene: if she gets just one ruff she is likely to make the @SK too|pg||

nt|jackthelad: more action|pg||
nt|chick: spades will win, and could even make|pg||
nt|justin c: should take the @DA before playing a @H there, helps dec to get the @H wrong|pg||

nt|roswolf: this time for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: more of the same.....dealer is uninspired today|pg||
nt|jackthelad: 11 trix for E/W|pg||
nt|dburn: the Open Room seems to have been rotated through ninety degrees - North probably did not go down one in 3@s there|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: S is checking the backs of his cards to see if the same deck as partner |pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: a tad perplexed it seems|pg||
nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jackthelad: W will act|pg||
nt|chick: W is Vul, 7 HCP, and may think partner has spade stack|pg||
nt|dburn: but there was some confusion at the start of this match regarding the boards, and perhaps that has not been entirely cleared up|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass? south 1nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i would begin with a heart |pg||
nt|chick: I would pass quietly|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jackthelad: I would have fancied 4NT by either e or w|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: really?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 10 cards in M suits and a void|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that goes against the grain here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he will show his shape first|pg||
mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: @c AJT tempting|pg||
nt|garnetts: why bid 1@H?|pg||
nt|justin c: dont like the looks of 6@H here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jackthelad: but all credit to the ballsy 4@s|pg||
nt|athene: looks like a simple 4@H for west over 1nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, a bit of faffing around first |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i think uncontested 1@h>2@d ; 2@s etc would also work well|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now South has a difficult bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say 3@c fsf appeared, still 3@s ok|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fsf = 4th suit forcing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i believe in that way South will easily would make better guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if south bids 3NT his partner might be short in @C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5-5 in M so not hard to guess rest possibilities|pg||
nt|jackthelad: put off a @h lead ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: North has just mentioned he has that suit --and I would have thought ti showed five clubs too|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: is the faffing because of fear that partner has a singleton heart?|pg||
nt|roswolf: short and sweet|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: surely west can't have slam ambitions|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sT|nt|h_karluk: God bless all commentators of BBO - what a busy day since 06.00 am USA EST|pg||
nt|mdgraham: spare me from partnres who rebid 1NT with a singleton  |pg||
pc|s7|nt|dohicky:  They don't|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they should be taken out and shot  |pg||
nt|athene: i agree east can't really ever need to rebid 1nt there with a singleton heart|pg||
nt|athene: after 1@C - 1@H; 1NT might be 3-1-4-5 but 1@D - 1@H; 1NT has to be honest as the day is long, i guess|pg||
nt|dohicky:  And a lot of people get around that problem by oprning a canape 1@d on all 54 minor hands|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but east might not do that|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: I suppose if you are 3145 it can be awkward - KQx x AKxx Jxxxx say, we'd all hate to rebid 2@C|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|garnetts: The 1@H bid has led to a 1NT contract  which after this lead renders the west hand of little value--2@D is much better|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chick: too late now for the @D trick|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|garnetts: why not lead a spade back  |pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: This is Blue Club |pg||
mb|1S|nt|dohicky:  2@d shows a weak 2 in @h with some strong options|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a biddable slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 6@H is a fair contract here--but 6@C might be better on paper--hard to bid either and both might go off on the club suit split |pg||
nt|garnetts: 2nt LLOKS BEST TO ME |pg||
nt|jackthelad: my guess is that they will subside into 3nt....but |pg||
nt|garnetts: looks even |pg||
nt|dburn: this seems to be back to normal|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dohicky:  yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: Murphy's law of the unbalanced 2nt is that partner will always have your short suit|pg||
nt|justin c: dont like the looks of 6@H here either|pg||
nt|roswolf: playing precision south has room to bid 3@D|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 2@H shows a 4 card major|pg||

nt|roswolf: YUK the diamond suit is buried|pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: my syberian husky running for a record, again tangled up to another tree :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: West's hand isn't as good as it might at first appear - the point being, the great hearts are largely wasted|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: and 2@S asks which it is|pg||
nt|h_karluk: back to game - - good auction but some misfit layout|pg||
nt|yo_yo: dont they pull sledges?  |pg||
nt|justin c: dont know the details of the bidding methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Ian, do you like the first double?   I would bid 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: facing a weak-2@H, @HAxxxx would be just as good|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: down on a club ruff - mildly unlucky|pg||
nt|dohicky:  not great|pg||
nt|roswolf: very poor sequence imo|pg||
nt|dohicky:  Unless there's something funny going on I can't see anything wrong with 3@d instead of 3@h|pg||
pc|d3|nt|justin c: but it looks better to me if north can show diamonds and get south to evaluate|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: i wonder why they just cant bid the major they have, would save a lot of time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mine german shepherd and syberian husky breed|pg||

nt|roswolf: absolutely maybe fatigue setting in|pg||

pc|h4|nt|jackthelad: I like 1@s|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: the jack of hearts dropping might lead to defeat by play a club to the queen |pg||
nt|garnetts: in 6NT I mean|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|h_karluk: likely a flat result unless a big slip on defense|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a cunning duck, hoping they continue @D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely South knows the count in @D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: aiming to cut connection on defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far not bad foresight|pg||
nt|yo_yo: still he has a difficult lead back|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but the real problem is about own communication between hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes, there is none :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and to find safe discards|pg||
nt|jackthelad: 10 trix...next|pg||

nt|dohicky:  Very possible|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|jackthelad: Dave has obviously fallen in @h with this pile....BRAKES coming|pg||

nt|roswolf: well this will make|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|Walddk1: Good morning to Joe Shair|pg||

nt|garnetts: Hi Joe|pg||
nt|santyclz: 0640 here, wake me if something happens.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: certainly it wasn't, and I am not sure what prompted it, but perhaps West could see that South might eventually throw a diamond loser on @hK|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|justin c: he was concerned that a @D loser could go on the @HK i think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Q the right falsecard against reverse signallers - hasn't fooled North, though|pg||
