nt|chick: had*|pg||
nt|petepunt: :),  will be tough after 1@H 2@D auction too|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi Patrick|pg||
mb|1D|nt|justin c: it could|pg||
nt|justin c: but with the @DK wrong...|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ady: part score  hand   20-20    e/w may play in either spades or hearts |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petepunt: maybe good hand for the weak NT here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mcphee: should make this one, although could go down|pg||
nt|mcphee: he had 7 tricks, strange|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: @H rate to be 4-2 so declarer may play on @S first|pg||
nt|mcphee: if so, he will be rewarded|pg||
nt|chick: no scores in the movie, so we'll just have to believe|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|justin c: very hard for south to stay out of this|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: EW play 1N 12-14 in 1st/2nd seat,  15-17 in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: of course, if the lead isnt the @SA, then norths spade goes on a @C|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|justin c: i dont know their bidding methods|pg||
nt|roswolf: i hope they do|pg||
nt|justin c: told 4@D is 'last train' type slam try|pg||
nt|roswolf: blackwood might keep them out|pg||
nt|justin c: if that is right, north cant really know what to do|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: Pondering|pg||
nt|justin c: if south had the @DK instead of the @CK, this would be an easy one|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mcphee: bad news here|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks like 1 off|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: sign off|pg||
nt|justin c: transfer to the appeals committee|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: Southerly pondering|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd 23 a disaster for the irish 3NTXX +2|pg||
nt|justin c: north might have cue bid 5@C here, hoping to hear 5@D when opposite the @DK but 5@H otherwise|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would also bid 2@C as N|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petepunt: looks like 9 on top in 3NT|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|justin c: i am told the other room is in 6@H on the @SA lead|pg||
nt|justin c: (which leaves it with no play that i can see)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcphee: but it just goes to show you how holding 3 fast losers in the opened suit make it dangerous|pg||
nt|chick: especially in an unsupported suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petepunt: for N/S|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|roswolf: same fate here i suspect|pg||
nt|mcphee: well the point I was trying to show is that the 2@C bid is not as good an o/c as it appears|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|ady: problem for east with doubleton heart|pg||

pc|c5|nt|jallerton: declarer can pick up the diamond suit for no losers - the contract will depend on how he plays the @C|pg||
nt|ady: hand 6   England played 4@S  down 2   when ireland retreated to 5@C after 4@S was doubled    14 imps to Ireland|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|ady: part score this time   likely in hearts|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|justin c: what could possibly go wrong|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm unusual |pg||
nt|justin c: 4@H going off on a @C ruff|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|justin c: south would rather defend 3@DX, if north doesnt...|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will be pleased he has 4 cards in diamonds|pg||
nt|justin c: do that|pg||
nt|roswolf: this now looks like 4@H|pg||
nt|petepunt: usually best to bid 1@S on these type of hand, even with 4points|pg||
mb|4C|nt|chick: NS play ACOL, so this is all natural bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: a WJS 2@S also works|pg||
nt|petepunt: expect 9 with @S ruff|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jallerton: perhaps 1NT-2@C-2@d-2@S would be constructive for this pair|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|roswolf: PROBABLY SHOULD MAKE|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: some might try 2@C with south hand and go to 2@S if north does not show hearts   probably not right for their system|pg||
nt|chick: cards certainly lie badly for any contract NS|pg||
mb|5D|nt|chick: 5@D Q-ask|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|chick: should kill the @H entry to the clubs now|pg||
nt|petepunt: 8 of @C makes 6@C an even better spot.  As you can ruff your @S high|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: playing normal Stayman Silverstone would prefer to bid 2@c|pg||
mb|7C|nt|roswolf: or not as the case may be:)|pg||
nt|chick: 6@C only contract that has a chance|pg||
nt|petepunt: hadn't thought of that one!|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: North might do better to X 2NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|chick: may be swinging a bit here, as NI is pretty far behind|pg||
pc|s7|nt|justin c: gives south a crack at 3@D|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chick: makeable now, but requires the "backward" club finesse|pg||

nt|vugraphzdt: Comfort break|pg||
nt|ady: west will do well not to insist on hearts|pg||
nt|jallerton: his heart suit is not good enough to insist playing in.  1@h-2@c-2@h-2@s-3@H-3NT-Pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: partscore fight!?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|roswolf: wow|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jallerton: or even 3@d 4th suit over 2@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: should west go to 4@H  north would do well to pass  as e/w can make 10 tricks  or possible 11 in no-trumps|pg||

nt|petepunt: helps if he had the @D count|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|jallerton: still perhaps East considers that West's hearts are not good enough to bid a 3rd time.  Preference to 3@c would be a possibility |pg||

nt|athene: 3@D opener in the open room on board 29 showed a pre-empt in either major|pg||
nt|petepunt: another slam !|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: and south naturally enough assumed it was hearts|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jallerton: 6@c and 6@h both possible contracts here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: which led to the unusual spectacle of an 8-5 spade fit being lost|pg||
nt|justin c: the method seems rather prone to that|pg||
nt|justin c: the better your fit is, the less likely you are to believe you have it|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed the method is sub -optimal and prone to give up large minus swings|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree justin|pg||
nt|petepunt: will need care with @C posotion in 6@H|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chick: again, 2@D shows hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: england extend lead   got 11 imps on hand 11 when ireland went down 2 in 4 hearts and england played 3NT making 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s control showing: an ace and a king, or three kings|pg||
nt|jallerton: presumably South can just bid 4@h now|pg||
nt|petepunt: may ruff 3@D in South and rev dummy|pg||
nt|chick: E is happy to defend @Ss|pg||
nt|petepunt: y and 2N a 4 card raise i @S|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|justin c: goig to be close|pg||
nt|justin c: @HA and another?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jallerton: Does 4@C agree @h?  Maybe it does, as South could have responded 2NT to show "any 6-card suit"|pg||
nt|roswolf: this also looks crazy bidding by the english but if you live by the sword occasionally you die by it|pg||
nt|chick: wonder what they play 5@S to show|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|ady: 5@S?|pg||
nt|ady: Ireland got 12 imps back on hand 12   found 4@H  when england went down in 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: S believes 4n agreed clubs|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: but you can also triumph|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|chick: oh, never mind, @H is trump, not spades :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: think it needs a @D lead let through|pg||
nt|chick: so EW will get 2 hearts, and if E ducks a spade smoothly, maybe 3 @Ss|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|d7|nt|jallerton: to make 6@c he'll need to start with the Q from hand, then take another finesse on the 2nd round|pg||
nt|justin c: this would be a good time to play trumps|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|petepunt: may lack 1 entry for dummy rev|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be -1 i think now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|justin c: for one of the stranger flat boards|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jallerton: looks like the natural line as he'll be in the North hand anyway: pay off to stiff K in West|pg||
nt|ady: looks like going down now|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: queen first though would also lose to stiff king with east|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jallerton: I don't see the advantage of low to the J|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|chick: I think he can cash a club, pitch a club, ruff a club then draw trump|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes -2 but -1 dd before that card|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|c5|nt|jallerton: but stiff 4 and stiff 5 in West twice as likely|pg||
nt|jallerton: as stiff K in East|pg||
mc|7|nt|chick: pinpoint defense, well done|pg||
pg||

nt|roswolf: where was the irish axe|pg||
nt|chick: nice and safe :)|pg||
nt|chick: I'm sure E ruffed that last @D trick|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jallerton: Good result for England in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: very swingy set     england got 11 imps on hand 13 when dixon went down 1 in 2 hearts   england made 3NT in OR|pg||
nt|petepunt: E would have over ruffed if he had exited with a @C tho'|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: NS play weak NT in 1st/2nd seat,  ACOL 4 card majors|pg||
mb|2S|nt|justin c: unswung Geoff, unswung|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: :|pg||
nt|justin c: 2NT leb, trying to play 3@H|pg||
mb|r|mb|3C|mb|4S|nt|chick: I would imagine XX shows extras, inviting|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: dbl shows a penalty double of @d|pg||
nt|jallerton: a matterof agreement what @s holding it promises|pg||
nt|ady: dixon double shows penalty pass of 2 diamonds and cards to compete|pg||
nt|ady: south likely 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: N might X when that comes back to him, or W might raise to 4@H regardless|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: I rather like 2NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: running scores at http://www.bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwmb/display.cgi?pid=display_page5&club=bangorholidaycongress&sessid=266715925403045|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|ady: this not likely to go well|pg||
nt|justin c: did i predict something that actually happened?|pg||
nt|justin c: (weird)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|justin c: 4@H risky now - maybe push NS into 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: just shows your maturing judgment|pg||
pc|h6|nt|justin c: lol|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|ady: surely better to not play A@S first round|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|chick: I can't see making this with the holey trump suit ... will have to lose 3 trumps|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: this is doomed too|pg||
nt|justin c: i see 6 trump tricks and a couble of @C|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|jallerton: Yes, but peraps hoping to gain the lead in @H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|justin c: the other two tricks are more enigmatic|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|chick: or maybe only 2 :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|ady: must be better to keep communications by letting the K@S win first round|pg||

nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Helen. Great Job! Our appreciation to BGB (Sandra Claridge), and the NIBU for ensuring that this ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: fine event is brought to BBO vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentator Justin for his wit and perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: our toes.|pg||
nt|roswolf: and finally another irish horror show in the other room|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jallerton: Thanks also to my co-commentator, David Edwin|pg||

mb|3C|nt|justin c: 5@D seems kinda high...|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: scheduld re start in 40 mins|pg||
nt|petepunt: tx cornelia and specs|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks to our excellent vugraph operator, Helen Cole!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: thx all    a very swing set     england made 3@SX last hand another large swing|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks to our very excellent vugraph operator, Helen Cole, great job Helen!! :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2nd half  of the match coming up in 20 minutes from now|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ady: another mis fit|pg||
nt|jallerton: England did well to stop in 2@s in other room|pg||
nt|justin c: if your mental equilibrium is of value to you, do not look at the auction in the other room|pg||
nt|petepunt: 1n is 15-17 on 3rd pos vuln, hence 1@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: a very conservative contract, especially vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: Crouch/Patterson play a strong @c system, so West was able to show a distributional hand without huge strength|pg||
nt|petepunt: tx all,  will have right boards on bbo form the start on sunday!|pg||
nt|chick: hehehe|pg||
nt|chick: Peter will see to it personally :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petepunt: 2N is 11-poor 14 i suspect|pg||
nt|chick: W doesn't have much to work with here|pg||
nt|petepunt: entries not easy to set up @D|pg||
nt|chick: a hand of aces and small cards is not much use at 3N, despite the point count|pg||
nt|chick: I don't think he can get more than the 2 top diamonds|pg||
nt|petepunt: lack of 10,9's and 8's is unusual|pg||
nt|chick: only 2 spade tricks, 1 club, 3 hearts ... I don't see much hope for a 9th trick|pg||
nt|chick: 13th club possible|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: 1@H    1NT    2@S   all pass in OR|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: yes a little surreal|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petepunt: worth considering using 2@D as 8-10 with 3@H by a passed hand. :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: fav lie of cards here|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jallerton: playing Acol, perhaps West should content himself with 2@h over 1NT|pg||
nt|justin c: my 'mature' judgment sees five @H and five @C for dec |pg||
nt|roswolf: ah but in which order?|pg||
nt|justin c: unless of course he goes and ruffs the third @D high, but I dont think he will do that|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|justin c: @H first Geoff, @H first|pg||
nt|petepunt: but too slow |pg||
pc|d6|nt|justin c: (safety play)|pg||
nt|chick: Yes, will make overtricks and regret not bidding 3 :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jallerton: but you can see how game might be making if partner has the right high cards|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: this is down 2  so some imps for england|pg||

nt|petepunt: 13 & 14 to score|pg||
