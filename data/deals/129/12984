mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|minimonkey:  I think that N hand is far too good for a 3S opener, but these things are a matter of style|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|galadriel: Spears opened a full-blooded 4@S in other room|pg||

nt|benjent: Entertaining problem for declarer - if you use the @hA entry to get to the @ck (to ditch your @s loser), you lose 4 @d tricks|pg||

mb|d|nt|galadriel: Lucky game here - can they bid it?|pg||
mb|2H!|an|TRF|nt|minimonkey:  I like a Diamond overcall as South but Double seems fine too, 1NT not too good with only Qx as a stop|pg||
nt|benjent: It's not a ridiculous game by any means. You threaten a lot of @h ruffs on the board, and the alternative of a moderately lucky @c layout|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|minimonkey:  Lots of players these days play transfers after their opponents double|pg||
nt|benjent: If the defence play trumps, it may just solve the hand for you ... so the defence could easily hand you a game you don't deserve|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  this allows you to show suits even with a weak hand and differentiate between a good raise of partners suit and a bad raise|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|minimonkey:  given that 2H usually shows the good raise I am guessng this is a very minimum|pg||
mb|3S|nt|galadriel: Aha South may push them.....|pg||
nt|benjent: If that 2@h was a good version of 2@s, then I think East could have been a little more enthusiastic|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|benjent: That 3@c bid turned Sime off. If North had tried 3@h, I think Sime might had revised his earlier opinion and bid 4@s|pg||
nt|galadriel: Would we all X again with S hand?|pg||
nt|galadriel: forcing partner to 3 level vul?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s2|nt|benjent: Not this little black duck. North had an easy X of 2@h and didn't do it|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: might declarer read this and drop the king?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: It looks like 4 clubs, three spades and 1 trick in each other, but not easy timing|pg||
nt|cicus: I think 2@S or even 3 making|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: Murdoch has correctly downvalued his two bacl Qx is|pg||

nt|barnets: probably one of the longest running partnerships in bridge|pg||

nt|lestergold: black doubleton qs neither of which are pulling their weight|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i was expecting a further effort fromN/S but they are ta ufavouravle and south's hand was rightly devalued|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|cicus: good decisions by all|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pdjourdain: West switches a heart and then the hearts run, so declarer needed to play club ace at trick one|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|minimonkey:  E has 2S avaliable as Spades and a Minor|pg||
nt|benjent: Always worth trying to snag an extra imp (if you can do it without risking your contract)|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  But a reasonable 5D |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|an|!S+m|nt|benjent: 4@s is cold (on the layout) also|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: W has a difficult bid now|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  Good spot, 4S is a fine game. The diamonds can be used to force South to ruff, in that respect they are Trump substitutes|pg||
nt|galadriel: He would like to make a try|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  Generally bids over a weak NT should be sounder than those over a strong NT, as you still might have game|pg||
nt|benjent: If they don't lead @c's against 4@s, you can play for either @s's or @d's breaking evenly. If they do lead @c's and force you off, you still make if @s's are 3-3 or 4-2, and @d's ...|pg||
nt|benjent: break 3-2|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  over a strong NT you are really just trying to compete the partscore|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  as such 2S shows some values, especially at this vul|pg||
mb|3S|nt|minimonkey:  so Sime really looks like he is worth a move|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|galadriel: Well done for getting there!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|benjent: I guess Sime could have asked for the minor with 2NT, but I like his 3@s bid - aim for the most likely game|pg||

nt|dohicky: taken|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: Interesting hansd - right play in spades is somewhat dependant on how aggressive a multi is played|pg||
nt|dohicky: A fairly heavy defeat about 30-40 imps|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lestergold: 3N makes 9 top tricks wikth the clubs breaking|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|barnets: so england are now in the lead ?|pg||
nt|dohicky: I would guess so, i don't know the other scores and the website hasn't been updated|pg||
nt|lestergold: but with a combined 23 game not that likely to be bid 5@d might run into difficulties with spades 4/2|pg||
mb|r|nt|dohicky: it wasnt a multi :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you 4@s loses 2@s and a club|pg||
nt|cicus: strange that E is not bidding his spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: east can show both suits like this|pg||
nt|cicus: spade length is concealed or strength overvalued later|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pdjourdain: another Multi and N must bid his void!|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: N sitting there hoping opps will bid :)|pg||
nt|dohicky: I'm told by the cbai president that it was a 24 imp loss for 19/11|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|cicus: but it may well go in accordance with their agreements|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pdjourdain: Declarer should scramble 8 or 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: the x  for the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well west has chanced game and they will egt an excellent result for their optimism|pg||
nt|cicus: not a particularly good game as both minors should break|pg||
nt|lestergold: west knows hia Ks in partner's two suits are working well however his er club stop four to the eight is perhaps not that robust|pg||
nt|cicus: by choosing X as his first call, E has practically endplayed his side into game|pg||
nt|lestergold: very robust wehn opps cl;ubs are breaking tho 4/4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i like that ides of being ebdplayed into game!!|pg||
nt|cicus: game is about 25 %|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s tho was much sounder as it makes even when clubs do not break as long as dims break and spades no worse than 4/2|pg||
nt|cicus: you need 38 % for vul games so it is not that poor|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pdjourdain: He can ruff all three spades|pg||
nt|barnets: i think it takes a club lead to beat 6@S|pg||
nt|dohicky: England beat NI 25/5|pg||
nt|barnets: interesting play in 6|pg||
nt|dohicky: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think west should have bid4@s if he was going to bid game|pg||
pc|c9|nt|barnets: so here|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|minimonkey:  In the other room Spears Blasted 4H |pg||
nt|benjent: 6@h can make with doubleton @hA onside, but it's really a poor contract. And the @d splinter is a good warning|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|galadriel: yes, well done|pg||

mb|3N|nt|benjent: There's a good case for treating East's robust @h suit as a 4-card suit. Stayman to catch the 5-4 fit, but otherwise head for 3NT|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|benjent: Except after @hAK, South gets in in time...|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  AK of hearts looks like the right play to me though|pg||
nt|benjent: West had exactly the right hand to convert 3NT to 4@h - concentrated values, 3 hearts including 2 of the top 3, a side doubleton ...|pg||
nt|galadriel: Unlucky board for Scots|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|pdjourdain: The singleton 9 of spades helps declarer in 4S|pg||
nt|eamongall: maybe 3@Ds can slip thru via @H ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: Scotland overbid the last board to 4@H with no values and are playing it xd|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|eamongall: hard for Brian Short to stop at 2N|pg||
nt|barnets: this is down 1 as is 3@H|pg||

nt|minimonkey:  EW's club can be as short as 3 so the 2C bid by Matheson is quite interesting|pg||
pc|hT|nt|minimonkey:  I would have bid 1NT, but as you can see the 2C bid has gotten them to a fine contract they otherwise would probably have missed|pg||
nt|benjent: I'm with 2@c, despite the risk. It's basically far too wet to pass, so the realistic choices are 1NT and 2@c|pg||
nt|benjent: Once they overcall, the chances of partner having actual clubs go up a little, and raising is usually the betetr action in competitive auctions|pg||

nt|barnets: if dec plays for 6@h tricks 2@C 1@s and 3@D|pg||
nt|eamongall: well I am not arguing with Barnet Shenkin ...I was reading a book recently about playing with experts by the same guy :) |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|xenya: yes on both points -- but it would be too much to expect S to let them play 5@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm south on lead? this gets curiouser and curiouser|pg||
nt|cicus: board is shifted 180 degrees plus bid out of turn?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i doubt bid out of tuen more likely 180 degrees|pg||
nt|cicus: but dealer shifts as well|pg||
nt|cicus: or am I totally confused?|pg||
nt|lestergold: I must leave for a while folks and look forward to being back for next stanza|pg||

mb|p|nt|benjent: He was good if @d's were 4-3 and @h's were 3-2 (that's  43%), and he had the residual of getting the single @s finesse right on the way out|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|benjent: That puts his line at around 70% (we'll give him a small deduction for the risk of a @d over-ruff) ... not terrible|pg||
nt|galadriel: @C ruff scupper this @H game|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|benjent: The unlikely 3NT is down on a @c lead also|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Plan A will be to drop @cQ on the big @c lead. Shouldn't work, but you have to try it|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|benjent: Dropping the @cQ at trick 2 is too late on 2 counts - the J is already set up, and South has already given count|pg||

nt|dohicky:  Mesbur misreading the lead on 27 gives Scotland 5 imps |pg||
mb|1N|nt|xenya: of course 5@H was makeable -- on the previous one|pg||
nt|dohicky: yes|pg||
nt|dohicky: not on A and another @h lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|dohicky: A weak 2 in @s with strong options|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|xenya: here too|pg||
nt|dohicky: 4@s look ok|pg||
nt|dohicky: looks|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: 3N from north|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|xenya: a @H lead might be awkward?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: again|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: It appears so.  |pg||
nt|cicus: can you please warn them not to do it again for the last two boards?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: I can't clearly seethe held hand by east or south|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|xenya: but still should make|pg||
nt|dohicky: yes if S ducks a @c finesse after drawing trumps|pg||
nt|dohicky:  2N is probably some form of limit raise in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky: Missing slam here could be costly|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dohicky: well with a @d lead it was down|pg||
nt|dohicky: well no it wouldnt :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think so|pg||
nt|xenya: on a @H lead declarer can work on @Ds making 10 eventually|pg||
nt|dohicky: Another possible 6@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky:  maybe a more balanced version than 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: England 139 Ireland 126 Scotland 114 I think is the current top 3 after 7 matches |pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: so it was West who opened 1NT and E transferred|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: I don't think it's their fault - misdealt by me I think?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cicus: 4@D was another transfer to make the hand be played by West (I am writing this hanging from the ceiling)|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|galadriel: W upgrading his hand|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  I would not be upgrading that to a strong NT|pg||
mb|3C|an|54+ms FG|nt|galadriel: We saw alot of upgrades yesterday|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  its a nice hand but I dont think its a special 14 count|pg||
nt|galadriel: But they were better than this one|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  What % of 15-17 NT openers are 14's these days?|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Judging just from the form displayed so far in the Camrose, Scotland would be the favourite in this match|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimonkey:  That 3C bid looks like a convenient gadget|pg||
nt|benjent: And I'm guessing my Scottish co-commentators aren't about to disagree with me :)|pg||

pc|h5|nt|galadriel: Well, we can see that it can make|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  Scotland are my favourite in every match....sometimes it dosent work out though|pg||
nt|benjent: According to the card, 3@c was game forcing with 54+ in the minors|pg||
nt|galadriel: But harder when you can't see all the cards :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|minimonkey:  Looks like W can keep playing diamonds through south, N, cannot attck the hearts effectively|pg||

nt|minimonkey:  N cn switch to a club or a spade here, without giving a away a trick|pg||
nt|benjent: You're unlikely to play the J from KJ32, so the J kind of gives away the 9|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  a club looks right given how solid dummys holding is|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  this might well be right by N|pg||
nt|benjent: If he had held slightly better spades (eg Q8xx), a @s shift would have been attractive|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  What 2 count can south have that makes this tricky for declarer|pg||

nt|cicus: but in fact I thought the lead will be from the ace, managed to confuse myself again|pg||
nt|cicus: after 2 rounds of @Hs N wil have to switch so declarer will have time to develop his tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: he can even  play @Ds from the top|pg||
nt|cicus: if S has the ace he will go up anyway to lead a 3rd @H so declarer may place the ace behind the king|pg||
