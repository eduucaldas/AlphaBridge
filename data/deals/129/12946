mb|1N|mb|p|nt|dburn: Crouch missed a game in 1996, and he he vowed never to miss another one|pg||
nt|athene: always hard to ruff partner's winner - you feel he has taken control of the defence by playing the winner, and must know what he is doing|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: it's true that some of them don't make, but that's not the point|pg||
mb|2S|nt|finch: I always assume that partner has no idea what he has doing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|finch: passing out 1NT would have been somewhat more successful here|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, he may have missed one here - I suppose 3NT has some sort of chance|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|athene: most top pairs play defences to 1nt which are strongly oriented toward the majors|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn: but Crouch can always blame partner for not bidding|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: so they are very stuck when they have a hand like east's here |pg||
nt|finch: 2@S showed spades together with a 4-card minor|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dburn: not easy, though = the strong no trump again working well as a pre-empt|pg||
nt|finch: The normal expectation is that you don't have 3NT on when LHO has 15+ HCP|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble may be here that you don't have 2@s on either - at the other table East's overcall was a more effective choice|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure whether it showed a signle-suiter, or whether it was "diamonds or majors"|pg||
nt|dburn: but whatever it was, it worked|pg||
nt|finch: the 2@C overcall in the other room showed any single-suited hand|pg||
nt|finch: North is looking for 6 tricks and failing. He wants to put partner in with the @HJ for a spade through|pg||
nt|finch: but is trying to work out if the contract is beatable if declarer has the @HJ|pg||

nt|dburn: modern bidding at the other table - East chose to raise hearts at once rather than rebid 1@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|dburn: because a sequence such as 1@d-1@h-1@s-1NT-2@h shows extra values|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|finch: So does East  here - 2@C shows a 3-card heart raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: if 2@C shows a 3-card raise, what does east do with a natural 2@C rebid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: on this lie of cards, though, the sequence 1@d-1@h-1@s-1NT-pass would have been more effective, but that is a fluke|pg||
nt|finch: they rebid 1NT on hands with 5-4 in the minors|pg||
nt|dburn: he would rebid 1NT|pg||
nt|finch: I imagine that 2@D showed a bad hand|pg||
nt|dburn: this is the Crouch Strong Club system, the world's second most complicated bidding method|pg||

pc|h3|nt|dburn: the Crouch Natural System being the first|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|athene: five 2major contracts in a row - they might reach game eventually if the match goes on long enough, i suppose|pg||
nt|dburn: well, East could not really do less - that was not the most robust of overcalls|pg||
nt|finch: 1@D shows hearts by South|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|d|mb|2S|nt|finch: and North's 1@C could have been short (5-card majors, 4-card diamonds)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|dburn: Patterson, though, may find a way to do less - he knows that Crouch won't have anything, because he never does|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: still, that cue bid (which ought to be played as natural against systems of this kind) allowed North-South to locate their club fit|pg||

nt|dburn: a lot of IMPs were lost yesterday when pairs could not play in clubs because the opponents had opened 1@c|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|athene: yes, it's normal for east to cue 2@D rather than 2@C, as the spade raise there|pg||

nt|dburn: well, 2@d can still be a cue bid - you can hardly want to bid diamonds naturally over 1@s when you passed over 1@c|pg||
nt|athene: the idea being you might well want to bid clubs naturally as east on the second round (you might have ten solid or something) but you can't want to bid hearts as you didn't ...|pg||

nt|athene: if they were to be believed, his partner had nothing|pg||
nt|finch: 2@C is an artificial game force|pg||
nt|athene: in which case, why should 4@S or 5@C be going down?|pg||
nt|dburn: not quite sure what the result at the other table was all about - I can see why you might double 7@c, and I suppose you might even take a shot at 6@c, but...|pg||
nt|finch: it's a good idea to come into these auctions at this vulnerability, because you really want the opponents not to have a free run|pg||
nt|finch: when they play these complex relay methods|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: yes, but 2@D doesn't take any space away|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: what you are hoping is that partner will raise it|pg||
nt|finch: it immediately makes them switch from relay to natural bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if people play artificial sequences you need to bid three steps up otherwise they can continue undisturbed, using pass and double to regain the lost space|pg||
nt|dburn: as indeed partner might have done|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is trouble for England - a trump shift now will beat 4@s|pg||
pc|s3|nt|finch: 5@C was not trivial to play on a diamond lead as declarer has to decide who has the @SK. The double helped.|pg||

nt|dburn: somewhat unlucky to go down in 4@s with these black-suit breaks, admittedly|pg||
nt|finch: and he could have played for the @HA onside or @HJx in either hand instead of taking the spade finesse|pg||
nt|athene: it takes a small heart now to beat|pg||
nt|athene: killing the dummy entry|pg||
nt|athene: the @CJ won't do the job because declarer can win, ruff club to hand, draw trumps, and play a heart up to reach the clubs again|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: excellent defence|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, and if South has discouraged diamonds, a heart shift is quite possible|pg||
nt|athene: leading small from an ace up to a KQ combination in dummy is quite a common idea|pg||
nt|dburn: still, finding it was a pretty good effort|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|cT|nt|athene: often you do it to set up some tricks for the defence in the suit|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|finch: yes, and finding partner with J9 of hearts also a big success|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: if he balanced with 3@D  surely east will try 3NT|pg||

nt|athene: so the @C7 was a trick and an entry! a bit like that famous Belladonna hand where @S7x or something in dummy in opps' suit is an entry|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|dburn: as a result of which, @c7 became a vital entry to dummy, so the contract made anyway|pg||

nt|finch: passing over 2@D was very dangerous as opener could have had a weakish hand with both minors|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Does 4@C agree @h?  Maybe it does, as South could have responded 2NT to show "any 6-card suit"|pg||

nt|athene: hi good morning everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: Hi Bill|pg||
nt|finch: East is Derek Patterson|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|finch: Team rosters and results can be found at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2010/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|athene: North's delayed double of 3@C says "i was trap passing over 2@D"|pg||
nt|finch: If South is finding this particularly difficult, then perhaps he is worried that partner has long clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: usually these later doubles are takeout of the second suit - but south isn't sure exactly what sort of spades his partner is promising here, perhaps|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|finch: North is not promising huge spades, but he should have enough high cards to believe that they don't have 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|finch: This would normally be a trump lead auction but I can see why South didn't fancy it|pg||
nt|athene: club lead, trump switch and the defence can leave declarer with a whole lot of heart losers|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: indeed, but they can't readily cash them, since the suit is blocked|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|dburn: and declarer will have a couple of spare minor-suit winners in the dummy|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|finch: Against that declarer can't quite get at enough tricks as his diamond ruff to hand is being overruffed|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c7|nt|finch: This looks to be losing 2 clubs, 1 heart, 1 trump and... one in the wash|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|finch: the wash possibly being a club ruff|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: the defence could take @CAQ and give south the @SK en passent on a diamond, for an easy five tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: this is more dangerous - if Patterson works it out, he can make from here|pg||
nt|finch: but declarer doesn't really have a reason to drop the @SK here as AKQxxx in hearts plus the @DJ is probably an opening bid|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|dburn: and he may tend to believe that South needs @sK for that opening bid|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: maybe he rose with the @SA just to be sure of getting one more heart ruff? and the appearance of the @SK was a nice bonus|pg||
nt|finch: that's the point where he wanted to ask about their opening bid tendencies|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s9|nt|finch: Their card says their weak twos (via the multi) are up to 10 HCP vul against not so perhaps that influenced him|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|sT|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sQ|mc|9|nt|athene: perhaps north's second double was wrong|pg||
nt|athene: his double of 3@C has shown his hand, hasn't it? |pg||
nt|finch: It was certainly aggressive|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|finch: EW here play more system than all the other players combined|pg||
nt|athene: some might be tempted to bid 2nt with south's hand, but 1@H - 1NT has to have minors since there's not much else for it to have|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: EW play a strong club system, so West's 2@S is limited by the failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|finch: In a more standard system he has to rebid 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: i would rebid 2@H anyway, to be honest|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: assuming east can have no more than 3 spades, it's pretty unlikely you want to play in a 5-card spade suit rather than a 7-card heart suit|pg||
