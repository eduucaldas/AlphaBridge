nt|galadriel: 3@C showing min with 3@S I guess|pg||
nt|galadriel: at least that's what I play |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|minimonkey:  Having shown a 7 card spade fit the slam gets much worse as any hand with 5 spades would know to lead the ace and then give partner a ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: My point is that there is no need to double as partner can still balance |pg||

nt|h_karluk: John or Brian Short? |pg||

nt|garnetts: so do I looking at all four hands but from Norths viewpoint he needs five club tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Lots of questions fromj Brian about the initial lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: The game seems to be over complicated for too many people--like leading your long suit against no-trumps--why bother when you lead something else|pg||

nt|minimonkey:  2S is probably one of the better ones|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|minimonkey:  1NT by north shouldnt be based on a rubbish 6/7 count as you might have to do sometimes|pg||

nt|minimonkey:  this is an important distinction when Partner can have a balanced 16 count|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i think that was Walsh|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: just 5 losers say partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: interesting point here as to whether 2@H shows extras|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: 5@D has no chance, because W will lead a heart (maybe even cash a club first)|pg||
