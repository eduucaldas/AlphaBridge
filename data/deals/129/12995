mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|justin c: hi geoffrey|pg||
nt|justin c: you prefer 5@H for east?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would double simply because 5@H looks too much of a committment|pg||
nt|justin c: nothing ideal really|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: Hi from Patrick jourdain|pg||
nt|garnetts: Pull 5@C to 5@H |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: England gained 2 IMPs during the scoring break compared with our earlier scores|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: assume 2 diamonds   spades and minor    east reasonably passed|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c showed any 1-suited hand|pg||
nt|justin c: this needs something good to happen in @D|pg||
nt|justin c: which it is not|pg||

nt|justin c: anybody prefer 1@S?|pg||

pc|h9|nt|pdjourdain: Declarer should collect an eighth trick in clubs but the ninth looks tough|pg||
nt|chick: maybe an endplay?|pg||
nt|justin c: will try to endplay W, but needs help fro the def|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: @H continuation by Tim was best to leave declarer all the work|pg||

nt|mcphee: ahhh back to the 4-1 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Hello again, Helen :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: clubs was his only chance anyway, he could see the endplay in both other suits|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: dbl 13-15|pg||
nt|justin c: pushy 2@D bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2@d Multi, pass probably shows @d|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: pass from west shows 6+ diamonds|pg||
nt|justin c: partscore hand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 12 tricks for EW when both @S are right|pg||
nt|roswolf: the english are very aggressive|pg||
nt|justin c: was just wondering if S would make a second X|pg||
nt|justin c: likely EW in 3@H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jallerton: is 2NT natural from N here?|pg||
nt|justin c: but E got there first :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk7: Good morning David, Justin and Patrick|pg||
nt|justin c: Liggins 'balancing'|pg||
mb|3H|nt|justin c: knows that passed hand East will drop 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this seems super optimistic|pg||
nt|justin c: hi Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: hi folks|pg||
nt|chick: We are experiencing some difficulty with the vugraph hands, so please be patient, we'll get it fixed soon|pg||
nt|chick: hi Bob|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will do well yo make this|pg||
nt|ady: best to play low in both hands|pg||
nt|jallerton: yes, there is still room for East to hold @cK (the EW CC does not specify a range)|pg||
nt|ady: west may be end played if winning KC if the first heart is ducked|pg||
nt|justin c: I guess if you want to play in slam , 6@C by W is as good as anything|pg||
nt|roswolf: crawling back under his stone!|pg||
nt|justin c: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwma/display.cgi?pid=display_page5&club=bangorholidaycongress&sessid=545753491721727  for current standings (scroll down)|pg||
nt|garnetts: It seems a little incongruous to me to make a marginal game try here and pass with the last hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: west will be disappointed when he sees the full layout|pg||
nt|justin c: If you are going to ask for keycards with west, it doesnt make a lot of sense to then sign off when you have enough, does it?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: Good morning Roland|pg||
nt|justin c: buying a useful dummy for his efforts|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: Lost it|pg||
nt|justin c: likely to make 10 here, rising @SA on a trump switch and ruffing hearts|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not to worry viewgraph is really hard to manage and this happens from time to time--not sure if this will make but looks favourite to me |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|justin c: If you arent going to know what to do over the reply, 4NT not a good idea|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: At other table Wales bid failing slam on Board 31 we will see later|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: little chance now unless dropping KC|pg||

nt|jallerton: combinations like AJ98xx do not appear on the convention card|pg||

nt|ady: silverstone liekly to open|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@d Multi also played by N/S|pg||
nt|justin c: more slams|pg||
nt|mcphee: that 4-1 fit looked like a tuff one:)|pg||
nt|chick: yes, I was starting to think someone was starting the party early :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: now this hand looks like 4@S may have a decent shot|pg||
nt|mcphee: it doesn't, but close|pg||
nt|mcphee: they must be taking a moment to hit the bar|pg||
nt|chick: may still be trying to get to the right set of hands|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is what we call teeter totter hands|pg||
nt|chick: teetering on the brink of disaster and then tottering back to normalcy?  :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: lets predict an auction|pg||
nt|petepunt: sorting boards out as we speak.  Players have right boards tho'|pg||
nt|chick: I'm starting to worry that the hands they are actually playing are not in the vugraph computer :-\|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: Thanks first time doing this|pg||
nt|justin c: game likely to be let through if N overcalls 1@S and S raises with @SKQ doubleton (as he might)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|justin c: then north would assume 3@S in S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: likely to play 2H|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm now a real slam perhaps even a grand for the heroic|pg||
nt|justin c: 1NT 14-16|pg||
nt|roswolf: if they lock into hearts they may get into the grand|pg||
nt|justin c: should be able to find out the @DK missing|pg||
nt|roswolf: but diamonds is the likely trump suit = the 1nt opening should see to that|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: Good result for wales there and on board 15 at the other table we will see later|pg||
nt|justin c: nebulous precision type 1@D|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3N likely for E/W |pg||
mb|3H|nt|justin c: 3@C = 6@D i think|pg||
nt|garnetts: North will always bid almost whatever |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: presumably transfer|pg||
nt|justin c: support X, (3@H)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: 3@H PROBE|pg||
nt|garnetts: rdble now catches NS |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: needs to shorten trumps as much as possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: Another nine!|pg||
nt|jallerton: there are some entries to hand in @d|pg||
nt|justin c: now 3@S = shortage (maybe)|pg||
nt|justin c: it does|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT will make EW with @C 4-4|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1NT has no advantage over redouble --in fact it rules out a penalty|pg||
nt|garnetts: However is East worth 3@D?  |pg||
nt|justin c: hard for him to judge|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: no splinter|pg||
nt|justin c: if there is a real @D suit in S, east's hand just falls apart|pg||
nt|garnetts: He was very aggressive on the last hand Non vul but not so here |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Normal to bid 2D|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: void splinter|pg||
nt|chick: The vugraph operator is getting caught up on some hands that have already been played, we'll get to live hands soon|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: but difficult to reach|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: they will play 6@D|pg||
nt|justin c: looking that way|pg||
nt|justin c: 5@D okay too|pg||
pc|c3|nt|justin c: nothing wrong with playing this in 2@S|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|justin c: game needs a @D break and a @C break|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Excellent try|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not so sure Patrick--depends on a number of systemic arrangements|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3N lucky to make|pg||
nt|justin c: this looks like making|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: wants heart finesse to lose|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: but if he doesn't take it and South has Kx very bad news|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|justin c: y|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: can take A@S   and 3 spade ruffs   2 diamond tricks and 1 club trick   then exit and wait for 8th trick|pg||
nt|justin c: wont take long|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: But well done the Jones!|pg||
nt|garnetts: The system NS were using almost forced this--No reason for EW to worry about a club lead on the auction|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Father Gary is West and son Dafydd East|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pdjourdain: There is a trophy at stake in this match: the Alan Pierce Trophy given in memory of a former Welsh international|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: safe now and will make an overtrick|pg||
nt|justin c: i suppose the problem with a @H finesse is that, N will hold up with Kxx or Kxxx, and that leaves the trump suit blocked with an awkward entry situation|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Yes, he had to take the risk of Kx with South, as North rated to have the king|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|justin c: would be horrible to play @HQ, @HA, then a spade to find N winning, delivering a @D ruff, and S cashing a @C|pg||
mc|11|nt|chick: perhaps E should have played another club to force dummy again|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: Doesn't look more than 4@H to me|pg||
nt|garnetts: guaging trump suit quality can be hard--here even 5@H could fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: 5@D is a decent contract, failing when the @HA is wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: north might bid 1nt|pg||
nt|justin c: but 50-50|pg||
nt|roswolf: in some strong club systems|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 2D forcing|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: non-forcing 2@S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pdjourdain: 1@S = @H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chick: 2@H shows a minimum|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: if north bids nt at any point south will raise to 3 when the defence will make hay|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: System card doesn't say but I think 2@S was an asking bid|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like 9, losing a couple of @S, a @H and a @D|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jallerton: a matter of partnership style whether East should bid 1@s or raise to 2@h|pg||
nt|justin c: declarer could make quite a bit of hay himself if east tries a heart lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: difficult to blame east   2NT strong invote with 4 spades   but a simple cu at 2 level would have worked out better|pg||

nt|justin c: did he really rebid 4NT here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: E took quite a view here|pg||
nt|chick: yes, but I think 3N is equally dangerous ... W doesn't have to have nearly as good a hand as he actually has|pg||
nt|mcphee: so remove the Q@D and 3N is still a make|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would not expect my p[artner to dble 3@S facing a passed hand vul with a poor hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is no 1-4-4-4 12 count t/o dble|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: they open 2@D with limited minor two-suiters so West may realise East is strong|pg||
mb|3N|nt|justin c: might make 6@S here in absurd fashion|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the spade overcalll may have kept the irish out of trouble|pg||
nt|chick: yes, in the open room, EW did not make 4@S :)|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: The jones bid several thin making games and several thin non-making slams!|pg||
nt|justin c: this one might make|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@H will likely go off as there is no reason for West to play North for Qxx--can pick up Qxxx in the south hand |pg||

mb|4D|nt|justin c: W might have passed 2@D here|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: E wont let 3NT play|pg||
nt|chick: E should not settle for 3N, any strong 6-5 belongs in slam|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 5@C more likely|pg||
mb|5C|nt|chick: declarer has a lot of work to do, and the strong hand is exposed |pg||
nt|justin c: this auction is not sound|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 5@D asked for trump queen|pg||
nt|justin c: West would bid the same way with the @SK, for instance, when 6@H is a claimer|pg||
nt|justin c: as David said, no real reason to get the trumps right here|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: On Board 3 where Jones bid and made the thin 3N Eng are in a thin, but sounder 5@D|pg||

pc|s2|nt|chick: no need in diamonds, has 4 pitches |pg||

pc|sA|nt|roswolf: hmm unusual |pg||
nt|justin c: 4@H going off on a @C ruff|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3@S not a game try|pg||
nt|justin c: normally 3@h by E would be a game invitation, 3@S just competitive|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|garnetts: My guess is that South will lead the J@C against this unless North has another  go--which I doubt|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|justin c: south would rather defend 3@DX, if north doesnt...|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will be pleased he has 4 cards in diamonds|pg||
nt|justin c: do that|pg||
nt|roswolf: this now looks like 4@H|pg||
nt|petepunt: usually best to bid 1@S on these type of hand, even with 4points|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Fairly easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Wales has one good result to come at the other table on Board 15|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chick: NS play ACOL, so this is all natural bidding|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chick: a WJS 2@S also works|pg||
nt|petepunt: expect 9 with @S ruff|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jallerton: perhaps 1NT-2@C-2@d-2@S would be constructive for this pair|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|roswolf: PROBABLY SHOULD MAKE|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: some might try 2@C with south hand and go to 2@S if north does not show hearts   probably not right for their system|pg||
nt|chick: cards certainly lie badly for any contract NS|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|chick: 5@D Q-ask|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Of course the ACOL 1@D-1@H might get there too if East did not raise to 2@H|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|chick: should kill the @H entry to the clubs now|pg||
nt|petepunt: 8 of @C makes 6@C an even better spot.  As you can ruff your @S high|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jallerton: playing normal Stayman Silverstone would prefer to bid 2@c|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: Dummy has trump entry for club finesse|pg||

nt|justin c: this gets out for one off|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Very tricky and well done by N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: should west go to 4@H  north would do well to pass  as e/w can make 10 tricks  or possible 11 in no-trumps|pg||

nt|justin c: not sure 4@S is a bargain|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: at least two off in 4@S|pg||
nt|justin c: couple of @D, @HA, @CA, @C ruff off the top|pg||
nt|justin c: and dec still needs to drop the @SK|pg||
nt|justin c: E might bid a sixth here?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: @D lead gives ruff & discard but may still be one off|pg||
nt|chick: ruff/discard does no good at all|pg||
nt|justin c: trump and 2@C to lose here|pg||
nt|justin c: Quite a view for E to let this go|pg||
nt|justin c: @SJ in dummy makes 5@S, when 6@D just one off|pg||
pc|c2|nt|garnetts: As the card lie maybe not but 4@H is likely to make and you have a lot of undisclosed playing strength|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: meanwhile declarer is short of entries to take all those finesses in 4@H|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Declarer may have to ruff in hand to retain trump entry to hearts but they don't break|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jallerton: Dixon should have learnt his lesson in that respect!|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: Sometimes it gets you defending 5@H  --I know the cards are bad but was looking at it as a single hand problem|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Declarer might cross to club run @HQ and then switch to diamond finesse|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: that gives him 12 tricks!|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|ady: yes I agree  west should not bid hearts a 4th time|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ady: east has raised    but this time wisely no double|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: Plenty of options for declarer but all work (e.g. playing on spades or diamonds)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: west may duck the heart|pg||

nt|jallerton: can get a loser away on the @C as West ruffs with a trump trick|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: in my dreams|pg||
pc|hK|nt|justin c: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I quite like 3@D over the double to show indicate a lead if they bid to 4H from a  Northerly quarter |pg||
nt|justin c: Pinning singleton @S10/9/8 in E, and finding N with @SA98xx or similar would be nice|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: spades look better to me|pg||
nt|justin c: (failing horribly on the actual layout of course)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: should plan for 1 spade, 1 heart and seven minor winners|pg||
nt|chick: needs to set up the spade while he still has a way to it|pg||
nt|justin c: with the @SJ dropping, the @D 3-3 and the @HA in S, he can do no wrong|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|justin c: will figure that S would pass 4@H with Jx|pg||

nt|jallerton: 2@h|pg||
nt|petepunt: S had no entry so W was ok too|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: a 13 card @S fit defending 5@C |pg||
nt|roswolf: the open room auction looks very odd|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S looks like the limit to me|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: kib suggesting 4 hearts a make last hand   which look right|pg||
nt|ady: 109 hearts in north hand  and club holding of AJ  very good for a heart contract|pg||
nt|jallerton: Surely West does not have enough to protect here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if he balanced with 3@D  surely east will try 3NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: probably just clarifying the NS methods: 2@h can be 5-4 either way round|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT for NS here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: double game swing here|pg||
nt|petepunt: top end for 3@S,  2n shows 4@S and inv|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@H = 3 suiter short @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: straightforward 4@H here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|justin c: y, this needed a @D|pg||
nt|petepunt: 6@H has play,  but likely to fail|pg||
nt|chick: NS are getting high enough to X for penalty instead of a partscore|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: Yes, you can show shortages, find 4-4 fits AND make opener declarer (see my invention)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I think we missed a Pass here|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3N by SOUTH|pg||
nt|justin c: which would wrongisde @H in the event of a fit there...|pg||
nt|justin c: South has better chances than East of making this|pg||
nt|justin c: it is a vexed question how best to handle 3 suited hands opposite 1NT|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|chick: that looks better :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petepunt: cards lie well here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|garnetts: yes lead towards the spades twice|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|justin c: popular system in the USA is to use a 2@D transfer to @H as @H or 3 suited (Walsh)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: You can use 3-level bids and cover all possibilities but 1 with the 12 sequences possible|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: I will write it up sometime|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|jallerton: I would have led a trump on this auction- dummy could be even shorter in spades|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petepunt: righjt auction now|pg||
nt|chick: can make 4, with the hearts splitting|pg||
pc|d8|nt|petepunt: unless they get their @D ruff|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||

pc|c4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|nt|jallerton: but I don't see how the pause would demonstrably suggest any particular lead|pg||

nt|petepunt: entries not easy to set up @D|pg||
nt|chick: a hand of aces and small cards is not much use at 3N, despite the point count|pg||
nt|chick: I don't think he can get more than the 2 top diamonds|pg||
nt|petepunt: lack of 10,9's and 8's is unusual|pg||
nt|chick: only 2 spade tricks, 1 club, 3 hearts ... I don't see much hope for a 9th trick|pg||

pc|h7|nt|roswolf: yes a little surreal|pg||

nt|justin c: no time to finish that thought :)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

nt|justin c: my 'mature' judgment sees five @H and five @C for dec |pg||
nt|roswolf: ah but in which order?|pg||
nt|justin c: unless of course he goes and ruffs the third @D high, but I dont think he will do that|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|justin c: @H first Geoff, @H first|pg||
