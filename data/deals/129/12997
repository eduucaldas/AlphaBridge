mb|p|pc|h8|nt|galadriel: The @D break unkind|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  Cards not lying very well for declarer though, 4 hearts, 1 spade, 2 diamonds, the remaining 2 are a bit of a struggle|pg||
pc|h4|nt|minimonkey:  Seems natural to play on diamonds |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes and then get upset|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|minimonkey:  finding out about the bad break will give declarer a chance to fall back on clubs or spades for more tricks...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|minimonkey:  if this holds a club to the Q seems right hoping the AK of clubs are with W|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  then if that dosent work play E for the A@s|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: maybe cashing two hearts before playing clubs would have been better - leave Murdoch with a slight problem|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wilkinsona: should win this in dummy now and play @Cs, which might gain 2 imps in the end|pg||

nt|minimonkey:  Can W be endplayed somehow?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes,  but still one off I think|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  he has to find 2 pitches but he has to do so after dummy so dosent seem possible|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|d7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|galadriel: I preferred the @S :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  Declarer making the right play of playing spades now, I think he is admitting 1 off otherwise|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, not sure, I dont think he had a line to make it anymore|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|minimonkey:  Well doubleton Jack of Spades|pg||
pc|d8|nt|wilkinsona: well, E would have 5 spades from the start then|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|s6|nt|wilkinsona: he has only let go of one, so would then have 2@S tricks by ducking|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|hT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  I suppose, as he has led from a 4 card suit and has a singleton he is probably a 4414 shape|pg||

nt|cicus: good for another X?|pg||
nt|cicus: I don't think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: low level part scores only here i suspect that someone will declare and go negative here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|lestergold: without a spade lead/[layed by south it may make|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: might declarer read this and drop the king?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: It looks like 4 clubs, three spades and 1 trick in each other, but not easy timing|pg||
nt|cicus: I think 2@S or even 3 making|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Murdoch has correctly downvalued his two bacl Qx is|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: n/s have been playing together for around 40 years|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dohicky: :) They had 15 year break at one point|pg||
nt|jackthelad: stunningly beautiful Edinburgh|pg||
nt|barnets: probably one of the longest running partnerships in bridge|pg||
nt|barnets: ok|pg||
nt|barnets: i played against them as juniors|pg||
nt|lestergold: black doubleton qs neither of which are pulling their weight|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: yes i was expecting a further effort fromN/S but they are ta ufavouravle and south's hand was rightly devalued|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|cicus: good decisions by all|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pdjourdain: West switches a heart and then the hearts run, so declarer needed to play club ace at trick one|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: ducking this will ensure contract makes|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pdjourdain: Well done Pat Shields|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|dohicky: taken|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: Interesting hansd - right play in spades is somewhat dependant on how aggressive a multi is played|pg||
nt|dohicky: A fairly heavy defeat about 30-40 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: opps couldnt get at their 4 tricks single dummy|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: 3N makes 9 top tricks wikth the clubs breaking|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: so england are now in the lead ?|pg||
nt|dohicky: I would guess so, i don't know the other scores and the website hasn't been updated|pg||
nt|lestergold: but with a combined 23 game not that likely to be bid 5@d might run into difficulties with spades 4/2|pg||
nt|lestergold: will Greenwood back in here no!|pg||
nt|sheila a: EW look to be able to make game here, possibly|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dohicky: it wasnt a multi :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you 4@s loses 2@s and a club|pg||
nt|cicus: strange that E is not bidding his spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: east can show both suits like this|pg||
nt|cicus: spade length is concealed or strength overvalued later|pg||
nt|lestergold: was not a 3@d overfcall avaiolabkle to west|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pdjourdain: another Multi and N must bid his void!|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: N sitting there hoping opps will bid :)|pg||

pc|d2|nt|sheila a: W was obviously put off by the vulnerability|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h cold this may be expensve|pg||
nt|sheila a: Hoped that partner would be short in @c and able to re-open|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cicus: but it may well go in accordance with their agreements|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N also cold as south can establish but not menjpy his clubs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pdjourdain: Declarer should scramble 8 or 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sheila a: a @s lead causes more problems|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|barnets: the x  for the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: his hand in my opinion is too good to put that amolunt of pressure on his partner at unfaviourable|pg||
nt|lestergold: i predict this will cost them a lot of imps|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: well west has chanced game and they will egt an excellent result for their optimism|pg||
nt|cicus: not a particularly good game as both minors should break|pg||
nt|lestergold: west knows hia Ks in partner's two suits are working well however his er club stop four to the eight is perhaps not that robust|pg||
nt|cicus: by choosing X as his first call, E has practically endplayed his side into game|pg||
nt|lestergold: very robust wehn opps cl;ubs are breaking tho 4/4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i like that ides of being ebdplayed into game!!|pg||
nt|cicus: game is about 25 %|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s tho was much sounder as it makes even when clubs do not break as long as dims break and spades no worse than 4/2|pg||
nt|cicus: you need 38 % for vul games so it is not that poor|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pdjourdain: He can ruff all three spades|pg||
nt|barnets: i think it takes a club lead to beat 6@S|pg||
nt|dohicky: England beat NI 25/5|pg||
nt|barnets: interesting play in 6|pg||
nt|dohicky: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think west should have bid4@s if he was going to bid game|pg||

nt|barnets: east can win and play another club|pg||

nt|lestergold: lucky to find his partner with spades and a few meagre values if east had this instead he could be walking into penalty territory|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well he has done a lot of bidding ion his 16 count and bad spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: 11 imps to scotland|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@s the limit here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: what's the 1N range for NS?|pg||
nt|eamongall: as the kib says .. a quick 4@S might have done the job |pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: Greenwood will need to be cautious but experience has shown that these boys tend to bid any gamne they sniff|pg||
nt|cicus: E worth a game try though|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|eamongall: However Mesbur and Fitzgibbon have been around for many showers of rain ...so they know how to bid |pg||

nt|lestergold: if i was playing this id win in dummy and play a spade to start with not wanting to get an early diamnond switch from east|pg||

pc|c2|nt|lestergold: but 3N or 4@h both laydown|pg||

nt|eamongall: for results etc ...start at www.nibu.co.uk and navigate to Bangor Bridge Congress page |pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Hands seem to be transposed?|pg||
nt|lestergold: when you see both hands of course 3n is a better contract but unbiddable compared with the obvious 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Lead Jc|pg||
nt|lestergold: then certainly transposed|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless Liz u are already on the l.ocal tipple|pg||

nt|cicus: well it was a bit strange that E opened 1@H then rebid the suit...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|barnets: east must have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: now 4N from west|pg||
nt|eamongall: it will sort itself out eventually |pg||
nt|barnets: I hope you bought it :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: after ace of clubs id play spade perosnally but as dim is right no harm done|pg||
pc|cT|nt|barnets: well i think 6@H can be made|pg||
nt|barnets: if dec plays for 6@h tricks 2@C 1@s and 3@D|pg||
nt|eamongall: well I am not arguing with Barnet Shenkin ...I was reading a book recently about playing with experts by the same guy :) |pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: yes on both points -- but it would be too much to expect S to let them play 5@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm south on lead? this gets curiouser and curiouser|pg||
nt|cicus: board is shifted 180 degrees plus bid out of turn?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i doubt bid out of tuen more likely 180 degrees|pg||
nt|cicus: but dealer shifts as well|pg||
nt|cicus: or am I totally confused?|pg||

mb|4D|nt|dohicky:  maybe a more balanced version than 2@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: can they identify the fact that they are playibng with a thirty point pack in effect and they hold 27 of those 30 points!|pg||
nt|lestergold: its an aold and familiar story|pg||
nt|lestergold: Short will know his hand is great if south can be relied on for a stiff/void club|pg||
nt|lestergold: now short has a problem how can he show dim support and make a slam try as well?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: England 139 Ireland 126 Scotland 114 I think is the current top 3 after 7 matches |pg||
nt|lestergold: looks l.ike short sighneed off in 5@d and south couldnt move|pg||
mb|5D|nt|cicus: so it was West who opened 1NT and E transferred|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: I don't think it's their fault - misdealt by me I think?|pg||
nt|lestergold: or can south puntit with those lousy spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 4@D was another transfer to make the hand be played by West (I am writing this hanging from the ceiling)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: surely input error|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|lestergold: thx operator|pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|nt|wilkinsona: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  4S is a little pushy by South but it is close|pg||
nt|galadriel: NS playing Acol weak NT and multi|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: was bound to here something more from N though|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: EW playing 15-17 NT 5 CMajors weak 2s in majors|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: which is OK, now that S is playing it|pg||
mb|6D|nt|minimonkey:  Yep, they rightsided this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: 6@D 1 and a void I suppose|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  I would guess 6D is a diamond void and an odd number of keycards |pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: aggression by Campbell made it easy, but would imagine after 3@S it would be fairly bidable too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: N would bid 4@D, South, even with a void has lots of good cards in the other suits|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: would be worth 4@H I think|pg||

nt|lestergold: 6@s played by south of course infrangible|pg||
nt|lestergold: all other slams off|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: 1N?|pg||
nt|dohicky: 12-14 :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i can count 6 hcp|pg||
nt|dohicky: I think you missed a pass operator|pg||
nt|dohicky: EWs is 14-16|pg||
nt|dohicky:  1@c 11-13 bal or 16+ any|pg||
nt|eamongall: strong version of the Carrot Club|pg||
nt|lestergold: operator input check please!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|xenya: yes, pass missed here |pg||
nt|dohicky: 2@d from N is 4@s + longer other or 5+@s|pg||
nt|dohicky:  1@d is 0-7|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh it is right|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: NI did well to bid this slam in the open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: they will not be unhappy if the Scots miss this|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dohicky: oh this makes more sense|pg||
nt|xenya: that's even better|pg||
nt|dohicky: An extra pass operator|pg||
nt|dohicky:  1N is 17-19|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzdv: Yes but a couple ended up suited so had to be hand done, these seem to be the ones|pg||
nt|cicus: I am not familiar with the technicalities of BBO|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Carelessness on my part.  Sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: np, you do a fine job|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec points out that there are squeeze p;osibilities in 6H but it involves ruffing down the diamonds so west has rto guard both minors etc etc|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but did N really pass over 1N?|pg||
nt|dohicky: another pass missed?|pg||
nt|cicus: 10 tricks expected here with 1@S+3@H+2@D+4@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: this hand is aclassic hand of playing in the 4/4 fit to use the long suit fit for discards|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: Shields was planning a penalty pass of 2D so must bid 4H now|pg||
nt|xenya: seems unlikely|pg||
nt|dohicky: well he has 2@s as 5@s and a minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: not always correct as sometimes you need to play in the long suit for reasons of control|pg||
mb|4S|nt|qwikjanz: so this should catapult wales into the lead|pg||
nt|dohicky: I suppose this bidding makes some sense (except for N first pass)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: south has the club guard so has to bid it maybe is worried about trump quality presumably can enquire about that?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no he has chickened out and this will be very expensive for the scots|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 13 imps the price|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|dohicky: A spec points out that the 3@d showing a doubleton will take the only guess of the hand away|pg||
nt|dohicky: well one of the 2|pg||
nt|xenya: well 5@D is a nice contract -- and perhaps N did pass -- otherwise they would be in 4@S|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|eamongall: seems a decent contract 2@S ..although defence have big trumps but both hands 4333|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|xenya: or not|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe short is more to blame in this auction his hand after all is massive he should b enquiring about the club control|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dohicky: Down now I think he needed some @c ruffs|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|xenya: did 3@D really show exactly 2 cards in @D?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|qwikjanz: can play to KD - JH, AD, and 1c?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|lestergold: having right sided it he needs to make a bid to show that he has all the goodies if south can take care of the clubs|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|2C!|an|TRF|mb|p|nt|minimonkey:  2C is a transfer showing a good raise to 2D|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  the scots play transfers over 1m-(1M) unlike most people who only play them over the opponents double|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: South will be getting a chance to protect|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: not really what N wanted to here|pg||
nt|galadriel: There seems to have been an adjustment to the score|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: N should have looked at his @D holding before bidding 3@C|pg||

nt|lestergold: excellent lead here|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|pdjourdain: Well done!|pg||
nt|cicus: but in fact I thought the lead will be from the ace, managed to confuse myself again|pg||
nt|cicus: after 2 rounds of @Hs N wil have to switch so declarer will have time to develop his tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: he can even  play @Ds from the top|pg||
nt|cicus: if S has the ace he will go up anyway to lead a 3rd @H so declarer may place the ace behind the king|pg||
nt|cicus: so there is no way to lose this contract|pg||
nt|cicus: Liz, is S thinking?|pg||
nt|cicus: we are stuck, I believe|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|s3|nt|xenya: 4@H is obviously superior to the 3N in the other room -- but an imp lost i guess|pg||
pc|hT|pg||

nt|lestergold: 4@h really an overbid contract|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
