nt|rodal f: Drove for ures:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: he works it out, but HK is surprisingly with East, so declarer needs to formulate a new plan, which maybe a simple finesse of CQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit more problems now to find the @S since E tell zerro left|pg||
nt|rodal f: If @D10 comes|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: @D by E- can afford to duck 1 round to get squeeze timing if 4441 and QC. Club exit leaves no choice?|pg||
nt|gracelin: another sure play is to cash SA then spade to K, if East keeps 3-3 in minors, then 3-round of clubs to end-lay East.  If east only keeps 2D, then establish a D trick.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gracelin: he can play CJ now and follow the end-play line if CQ is with West.|pg||

nt|gracelin: SA then SK now|pg||
