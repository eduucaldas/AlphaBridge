mb|2C!|nt|justin c: straightforward 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Looks for all the world like a 1NT contrcat by west|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|chick: I suspect this will end in 3N, and make when the opening lead is a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: funny bidding by west but that's their system|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 4@h would be fair enough to buy |pg||
nt|chick: I can't see E finding a club lead|pg||
nt|jackthelad: nice part score....any dreams of the Moysian @s get killed real quick|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i think that was Walsh|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: too many tricks potential after partner opened|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: just 5 losers say partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: interesting point here as to whether 2@H shows extras|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|chick: 5@D has no chance, because W will lead a heart (maybe even cash a club first)|pg||
nt|chick: so they stop short of game and NS miss a big chance|pg||

nt|justin c: how many @S for east i wonder|pg||
mb|1D|nt|h_karluk: 23 vs 17 there|pg||
nt|chick: but 3N would have been lucky to make because there were ways to set it|pg||
mb|3S|nt|h_karluk: i feel myself a traveller in past - long years ago those were the stuff practice everyday|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you mean Blue Club?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe a destiny|pg||
nt|h_karluk: absolutely|pg||

mb|4S|nt|h_karluk: and later on TRS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i liked it much|pg||
nt|justin c: the 1@D opening promised 4@D i think, so 4@D not as odd as it would otherwise be|pg||
nt|justin c: 5@D and 4@S both failing|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: but the problem was to find studious partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: N doesn't have much to do now ... even NT with a singleton in partner's suit isn't appealing|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@H beatable with a @D ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: TRS - tony forrester, raymond brock, steve lodge invented a nice strong pass relay sys in that years|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what will murchan do, pass?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nowadays i guess allowed in level 5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i guess this is catch up time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|garnetts: 2@H a lot better than a 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|justin c: i see a couple of hearts, a spade and a club to lose here|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: if you play TRS your opps have no chance unless they start bidding|pg||
nt|garnetts: the Ax in spades tells you that even if it is a Moysian fit you have a ruffing value|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jackthelad: pass is the best bid on this hand...as soon as possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: so far 3N makeable|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 3NT clearly makes and is likely to be bid I think|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and there's a clear danger for overboard quickly|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H makes it almost inevitable |pg||
nt|justin c: Wests hand here appears in the MSC often|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|justin c: My opps always bid 1NT and land on their feet|pg||

nt|justin c: EW look close to 5@C here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: I think 3@S is a poor bid--he has already shown that suit--why not 3NT it could be as is the case here a desire to hear 3NT |pg||
nt|h_karluk: exactly|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|jackthelad: declarer should get out for one down|pg||
nt|chick: depending on how he plays the @Ds|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||

pc|s2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: why not Q@C  makes it easier for partner to see what is happening |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5 trumps out; 3/2 68%, 4/1 28%, 5/0 4%--probability of an honour card being: stiff 6 %, doubleton 27 %, trebleton 41 % |pg||

mb|1C!|nt|jackthelad: how tempting is a slam here ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|garnetts: This is another example where 2@S by EW is a reasonable contract |pg||
nt|chick: if NS find their way to 6@H, will make on anything except a spade lead|pg||
nt|justin c: should have forced dummy to ruff a C at the end there|pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: but the key card is with E...so doomed|pg||
mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: moysian fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: tho i disagree Ciara's 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Finally caught up - lost the connection|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chick: N opened on 9 HCP  (mind you, I agree with that), so he will discourage slam tries|pg||
nt|jackthelad: Iain squirming now :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|garnetts: 2@C  is just plain daft |pg||
pc|d8|nt|h_karluk: so 3N expected now|pg||
nt|jackthelad: 2@h works as well|pg||

nt|vugraphzdu: Yes!|pg||

pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: not much tough contract|pg||

nt|jackthelad: they should employ checkback then|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|garnetts: He has run into a real problem because I am sure that 2@S after this sequence would show extras--therefore bid 2@S initially|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 2@c rebid was natural - checkback after minor - major, then 1N sequence?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Cannot use checkback without a 1NT rebid can you?  There is a case for employing 2@C as an artificial ask though after the 1@S response|pg||

nt|h_karluk: as S sure|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no me neither|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like more stuffing in the suit for a vulnerable preempt|pg||
nt|jackthelad: but questions asked over the lead....Partner cant really have anything on this bidding...never mind @s A|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: yes, and I kinda think if you don't lead an A, you don't have an AK|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|justin c: Headed to 2@S i guess|pg||
nt|justin c: i read an article the other day, one of danny kleinman's many, that said five five in the blacks should open 1@C|pg||
nt|justin c: seemed quite convincing at the time|pg||

nt|h_karluk: slam @s time for South|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Murchan unhappy with his defence|pg||
mb|1N|nt|justin c: i am advised that 1@S is better by about half of you|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: multi from Ciara?|pg||
nt|chick: I want to know which dealing program was used for this session, it's like goulash :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: @d A and a small @d would not set with careful timing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a good weak 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in their system|pg||
nt|jackthelad: making 4@s is a tad tricky....but 4@h rolls in|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: it doesnt look that great to me  but  i suppose there are worse |pg||
pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: spades 2-2 , @d ace and @c K favorably placed|pg||
nt|garnetts: another 12 imps to Scotland after a verry poor piece of declarer play led to 4@S failing in this room--both the two swings could been avoided |pg||
nt|chick: EW will have two chances to attack S's entries|pg||
nt|chick: must knock out both before trumps are drawn to beat 4@H|pg||
nt|jackthelad: but cant touch 3NT|pg||
nt|chick: yep, that's the place to be|pg||
nt|jackthelad: as is pointed out...the unlikely @d lead beats it|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|garnetts: nasty hand for North now--what would a double be I wonder  |pg||
nt|jackthelad: really tuff.....cant support..cant double|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: i think N hand deserves a cue bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: both hands are rather good|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but South has a lot of @H to deal with|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just draw 2 rounds trump and switch @d ten towards table|pg||
nt|garnetts: Poor east has had a rough ride--maybe feeling the pressure a bit--it can make you do silly things --I know been there and got the scars to prove it|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yo_yo: and if it's ducked?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||

nt|h_karluk: *and - ans typo sorry|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|yo_yo: there was more bidding in the OR|pg||
nt|justin c: endplay north now|pg||
nt|justin c: then guess @H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|justin c: from my privileged vantage point, crossing to the @HQ and running the @CQ was a touch easier|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: East got to 4@H |pg||
nt|yo_yo: doubled and pulled by North|pg||
nt|justin c: bridge should be scored like ice skating|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: this is a very slow match |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|justin c: one score for technical merit, another for artistic interpretation|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d8|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|justin c: would be a shame to get to here then misguess the @H suit|pg||

Not getting too high when his partner had bid somewhat forwardly. He invited a slam but then passed the sign-off.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: EW have lots of points here - they might wander into 6@H.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: But when you have only 4-card suits, it's uphill work - you need aces and kings for every trick.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@S is 4th suit forcing because 1@S would be natural and forcing for one round on this sequence.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: West shows a good raise to 4@H since he did not go straight there on the previous round.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: What will Silverstone lead?  A trump is far too likely to pick up partner's promising four-card holding.|pg||
nt|athene: So there's no chance he will do that :) Haha|pg||
nt|brolucius: The slam has some play but it is not as good as '@SA onside' because you have a bit more to do and a 4-1 trump break might prove inconvenient.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|athene: It depends who is in the South seat - if it's someone who will lead an ace if he has it, you probably want to be in 6@H.|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d7|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: Since I rarely lead trumps myself, I tend to think that BBO commentators who commend an 'obvious trump lead' have always looked at the full diagram and seen that it happens to work ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: well.   |pg||

nt|brolucius: I see that I have been unfair in that respect because Silverstone and Dixon really do lead trumps all the time.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: One thing I noticed kibitzing Dano De Falco was how much he led trumps even from "ridiculous" holdings - and it usually worked.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Seven whole tricks seen...!|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|athene: e.g. he led from Kx but declarer didn't believe it of course and finessed into his singleton king anyway.|pg||

nt|vugraphzdu: Not too slow here - just the occasional board|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we dont like those :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|jackthelad: more action|pg||
nt|chick: spades will win, and could even make|pg||
nt|justin c: should take the @DA before playing a @H there, helps dec to get the @H wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: more of the same.....dealer is uninspired today|pg||
nt|jackthelad: 11 trix for E/W|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|chick: S is checking the backs of his cards to see if the same deck as partner |pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: a tad perplexed it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: W will act|pg||
nt|chick: W is Vul, 7 HCP, and may think partner has spade stack|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: i would begin with a heart |pg||
nt|chick: I would pass quietly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: I would have fancied 4NT by either e or w|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yo_yo: really?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 10 cards in M suits and a void|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that goes against the grain here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he will show his shape first|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: @c AJT tempting|pg||
nt|garnetts: why bid 1@H?|pg||
nt|justin c: dont like the looks of 6@H here|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|jackthelad: but all credit to the ballsy 4@s|pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: i think uncontested 1@h>2@d ; 2@s etc would also work well|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now South has a difficult bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say 3@c fsf appeared, still 3@s ok|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fsf = 4th suit forcing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i believe in that way South will easily would make better guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if south bids 3NT his partner might be short in @C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5-5 in M so not hard to guess rest possibilities|pg||
nt|jackthelad: put off a @h lead ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: North has just mentioned he has that suit --and I would have thought ti showed five clubs too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: God bless all commentators of BBO - what a busy day since 06.00 am USA EST|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|garnetts: The 1@H bid has led to a 1NT contract  which after this lead renders the west hand of little value--2@D is much better|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chick: too late now for the @D trick|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|garnetts: why not lead a spade back  |pg||
nt|justin c: guess you ruff a @S and squeeze S in the minors|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: absolutely 12 hours and 24 minutes passed in screen, wow|pg||
nt|garnetts: ressurected the west hand again|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h7|nt|jackthelad: agree.....completely lost tempo now|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yo_yo: what did we do before BBO came on our computers?|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: This is Blue Club |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|garnetts: 6@H is a fair contract here--but 6@C might be better on paper--hard to bid either and both might go off on the club suit split |pg||
nt|garnetts: 2nt LLOKS BEST TO ME |pg||
nt|jackthelad: my guess is that they will subside into 3nt....but |pg||
nt|garnetts: looks even |pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|jackthelad: Murphy's law of the unbalanced 2nt is that partner will always have your short suit|pg||
nt|justin c: dont like the looks of 6@H here either|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 2@H shows a 4 card major|pg||

mb|3H|nt|h_karluk: my syberian husky running for a record, again tangled up to another tree :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|yo_yo: and 2@S asks which it is|pg||
nt|h_karluk: back to game - - good auction but some misfit layout|pg||
nt|yo_yo: dont they pull sledges?  |pg||
nt|justin c: dont know the details of the bidding methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Ian, do you like the first double?   I would bid 1@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: but it looks better to me if north can show diamonds and get south to evaluate|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: i wonder why they just cant bid the major they have, would save a lot of time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mine german shepherd and syberian husky breed|pg||

pc|sT|nt|jackthelad: I like 1@s|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|garnetts: the jack of hearts dropping might lead to defeat by play a club to the queen |pg||
nt|garnetts: in 6NT I mean|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: likely a flat result unless a big slip on defense|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a cunning duck, hoping they continue @D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely South knows the count in @D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: aiming to cut connection on defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far not bad foresight|pg||
nt|yo_yo: still he has a difficult lead back|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but the real problem is about own communication between hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes, there is none :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and to find safe discards|pg||
nt|jackthelad: 10 trix...next|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jackthelad: Dave has obviously fallen in @h with this pile....BRAKES coming|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: David unsure about what the 4 diamonds is and has taken 3 goes at his final bid of 4 spades|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good morning to Joe Shair|pg||
