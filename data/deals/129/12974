mb|d|nt|pdjourdain: The singleton 9 of spades helps declarer in 4S|pg||
nt|eamongall: maybe 3@Ds can slip thru via @H ruff|pg||

nt|dohicky:  you might be able to get a an extra @C and @d eventually|pg||
nt|eamongall: but opps will be at least 6 tricks by then |pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|xenya: but still should make|pg||
nt|dohicky: yes if S ducks a @c finesse after drawing trumps|pg||
