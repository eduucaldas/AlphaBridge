nt|hawe45:  Frank - many people will be happy, when there is no connection to our table...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the heart length is surely with N, so if he has Qxxx (no nine) the heart ten on 1st round of suit works by brute force. even if he has Q9xx, he may not cover, and if perchance he ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: has Qx after all  it is almost sure he will not cover|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but.........|pg||

nt|rodal f: U have that great job so fare so I easely trust u Matias:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5@C makes for NS|pg||
nt|hedyg: i remember my 1st ever teamgame competition i was told: never double a partial except if you have enough SURE tricks to beat it in your hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: such as opps playing 3 M and you have AKQJ10 in the suit was the example i was given|pg||
nt|gulyas: slam only goes down cos of the 4-0 trumps in fact|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps a little extreme but sound enough principle|pg||
nt|sharkey: Krøjgaard upgrades with the playing strength|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easily 800|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: i suppose we don't know the systems here?|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: just a little extreme :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4-0 trumps is not enough to beatthe slam, also spades must be 5-1|pg||
nt|csabi: and if they go down in 6@C they still win 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|gulyas: makes no diff, u lose a @D and a trump (discard 4th @H on the @SK at end)|pg||
nt|yusufb: günaydýn herkese|pg||
nt|babydolldk: 2@C a kind of reverse drury|pg||
nt|xenya: probably 2@C was sort of relay (GF?) and 2@D showed a minimum hand|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm told EW play reverse drury over major-suit openings in all positions|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East was ready|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ok that N have 15HP and 4-3 in the unbidded colors. But are E or W limited?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: does W hand qualify for reverse?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes fielders choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if spades wre not 5-1 it would be an easy make with correct single-dummy handling of trump suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: why would they go to 6@c when N passed twice first?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Peter's 2@D timid a little I think....|pg||

nt|gambit: West trying to get a count on South's hi cards before playing spades |pg||

nt|marlowepi: tricks at NT u can make 10, so there is safety at the 4 level  (d) S would have been endplayed into bidding 3N on many hands|pg||

nt|babydolldk: uh you are right, let's see if he can lead a @H|pg||
nt|xenya: actually he preempted against partner -- perhaps N could bid 3N instaed of 3@S|pg||
nt|babydolldk: yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: when north ducks what next?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Could bring 1 IMP for Schaltz|pg||
nt|rodal f: 6@C or 5@S from W|pg||

mb|6C|nt|xenya: ?|pg||

nt|sharkey: But since West's stiff @S is the 9 shud be ok I think|pg||
nt|babydolldk: yes it's a friendly layout|pg||

nt|hawe45:  South shall lead against 6 @C...|pg||
nt|pelu: ?? Hans|pg||
nt|rodal f: And then we are back to my start. Waisted cards, seen from Dorte's side|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|marlowepi: though  either defender can make declarer guess by leading an honor on the first round|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: here declarer did the logical thing, hoping D king an entry|pg||

nt|rodal f: Peter for shure feel that some IMPs are needed and shot the gold bird this time.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sooner or later NS will have to break clubs, and they need to start by leading an honor|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer has another entry but not very useful|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W should not be fooled though, given the NS silence, with N known to have S Kxxxx and D ace and heart queen, |pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
nt|marlowepi: while S would likely have balanced with club KQ and H QJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS play multilandy and he didnt bid 2@s so basically should not be 5-4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry AJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|babydolldk: no, I don't think so, the clubs are a problem..|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he should be content with down one once spades were 5-1 and D king was not an entry|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: thx all|pg||

nt|rodal f: But can make some brain headack|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NO - I know PeterÂ´s leads|pg||
nt|Walddk9: Dorthe can't know if she can afford the safety play in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk9: ducking from dummy|pg||
nt|bessi2: I dismissed the hand as boring flat board in the open room, but seeing all 4 hands can cloud one's perspective, the play in the open room is perfectly correct seems to me|pg||
nt|pelu: if she duck - she has to play N for @dJ|pg||

nt|babydolldk: is it possible to ruff two @D and a @H in hand and then make 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|rodal f: X at 2@H is negative so Xat 4@H .......:)|pg||
nt|gambit: that is the proble, he can see they may have a heart fit, can't sell and do nothing, 3D helps partner too, especially in a competitive auction where it is so tough to judge |pg||
pc|d7|nt|yusufb: bi sonraki maç saat 14:00 de|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|hedyg: needs some luck in @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: if Harangozo ducks when he plays @c from dummy...|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer needs to play clubs every time he is in dummy - and get them right as well|pg||
nt|rodal f: It's captains I belive. Might it should have been alerted. 2@D=minimum for the opening|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard to find the lead making problems for W|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gambit: Over here, most play 2@C as Drury, asking about the quality of partner's 3rd or 4th seat opener |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|hedyg: when you overtake your pds K@D you have a plan...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzex: but im not saying i would do otherwise though|pg||
