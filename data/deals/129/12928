mb|p|mb|1C|nt|golfsquash: How did the bidding go?|pg||
nt|dburn: moreover, they actually conducted an auction that went 7@h - pass - pass - 7@s, which was doubled by the player with 13 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: no doubt for fear that his partner would regard pass as forcing and try 7NT|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|2N!|nt|golfsquash: and he wasn't even giving a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|roswolf: so the board was scrubbed?|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it was - there was probably no time for them to play the real board 12|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: yes, it was obviously misboarded in the Open Room.|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm north mixing it up|pg||
nt|dburn: unlucky for England, who had a decent result in the Open Room|pg||
nt|dburn: there is a separate set of boards at each table|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: luck of the irish!?|pg||
nt|dburn: and the dealing machine had demonstrated its whimsical side only on the Closed Room board 12|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this could be bloody|pg||
nt|golfsquash: If he passes, need to play trumps early.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the putative defenders can lead trumps and get a diamond, three clubs and two spades for 300|pg||
nt|dohicky: Any Idea what lead Ireland to go down in 3NT on board 2 David?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: Presumably a spade guess at trick 2 on bd 2.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yuk is 4@H PLAYABLE|pg||
nt|dburn: I am afraid I was not here for board 2, so I do not know what happened|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 3 down|pg||
nt|roswolf: on a diamond lead doom for ireland|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|h6|pc|d8|pg||

nt|athene: hi welcome back everyone|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ciaran: hi William|pg||
nt|athene: can declarer endplay south twice to make this?|pg||
nt|ciaran: I'm told that West is Whittaker, East is Liggins|pg||
nt|athene: duck two rounds of diamonds, then cash two rounds of clubs and play a major|pg||
nt|athene: maybe after the second diamond north has to play a spade to break up the endplays?|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks a thin game|pg||
nt|dburn: thin? not really - it's a pretty good game, and it is quite likely to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: a combined 22 count is not over endowed|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|dburn: may even make an overtrick, in fact - no doubt East at the other table took only nine tricks so that West would not realise they had missed a game|pg||

pc|d6|nt|golfsquash: It looks a good game to me. How did declarter manage to make 9 tricks at the other table?|pg||
nt|golfsquash: declarer|pg||
nt|dohicky: especially fter a @c lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dburn: unfortunately - or perhaps fortunately for Liggins, the play record at the other table goes only as far as trick one and a half|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|athene: quite a light 1@D if so|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ciaran: An interesting hand to start with anyway :)  Especially as E had the information he needed from the opening bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, something is different here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ciaran: I think a pass is missing - Carroll opened 1D|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ciaran: Now when Liggins balances, what does west do?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: he bids game :)|pg||
nt|athene: all the cards look very well placed|pg||
nt|ciaran: Would be right in this case..|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you have the minors over opener, and anything partner has is over the spades|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's a bit pushy - you don't want to discourage partner from getting in there|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|athene: maybe west will win the post-mortem with the argument that 3@D has to be a hand this good|pg||
nt|ciaran: migth be a little, but I support partner has a non-descript 8 count and 11 tricks are available|pg||
nt|athene: since partner passed for so many years before bidding|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: but in my experience, if a strong hand invites a weaker hand it's really hard for the weak hand to realise that the little it has is enough|pg||

mb|3C|nt|roswolf: dont|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|dburn: curious auction at the other table, where South appears to have made a game try for no very good reason, and North appears to have passed him  out in it for no reason at all|pg||
nt|dburn: although perhaps Carroll feared that if he rejected Garvey's game try by bidding over it, Garvey would next make a slam try in a fit of exasperation|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: pass for 500 works well|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ciaran: I think I'd double there as E even though light..  |pg||
nt|ciaran: If partner has clubs and a major, will be hard for him to bid again unless strong|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: north with good clubs might be thinking about 3nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but partner is limited for 1@D so it's hard to see 3nt making|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: no way to beat this - in fact west has to get a diamond ruff even to hold to nine, doesn't he?|pg||
nt|athene: of course that all depends on declarer dropping the @HJ, which isn't so easy|pg||
nt|ciaran: I suppose declarer could go off if getting everything wrong, but seems likely to make|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: very tough for west- playing clubs just looks like picking up partner's trumps under declarer's|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
mc|7|nt|athene: maybe you lead the @CQ and try to get a force with the @CJ even if it sets up the @C10|pg||

nt|dburn: restraint by South at the other table here - just as well, perhaps|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|dburn: facing a limited opening, Mesbur may just jump to 4@h, and South will find it very hard to pass that|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: hmm very pessimistic david|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 4@s is at least 3 down|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|roswolf: the axe falls|pg||
nt|dburn: pessimistic? not really - hard to see the auction developing otherwise|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok realistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: still, East has to sit for this - he should, but...|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: Mesbur thinking though|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i repeat if sitting birds are to be shot let them sit|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|golfsquash: better cash the spade now|pg||
nt|roswolf: now no imagination please victor|pg||
nt|dburn: I suppose it is possible that East is 0-8-1-4 for this bidding, in which case South may try to give North a club ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: had the @D detached fr while there Geoff|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|roswolf: that requires imagination just palooka bridge works -aaaahhhhhhh|pg||
nt|dburn: but provided Dixon has played the correct partnership cards from four small, chances are South will do the right thing|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: teasing it seems|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Hello David, Bill and Gad|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ciaran: Easy 4H here.  4S for N/S looks like it is 3 off|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H interesting :) i assume that's a strong jump shift :)|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose just responding 4@H might miss a slam occasionally|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: or 1@H ... 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Hi Bill, David|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like an Acol 2 opening :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a light 1@H opener but EW play strong club|pg||
nt|athene: so the top limit for 1@H is reduced, at least|pg||
nt|viren169: a light 1@H to start of with from Crouch to set the tone...|pg||
nt|dohicky: It will be interesting to see if Carroll will open as well in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: you certainly don't want to be playing forcing NT response if you open that west hand :)|pg||
nt|dohicky: Yes it may end badly if he does open it|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure Paterson has seen plenty of Crouch's light openings|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: if Liggins had responded 4@H the first time, Carrol would surely have been tempted to do something, which wouldn't have worked out well at all|pg||
nt|athene: but as it was he got his hand off his chest earlier and could pass 4@H in relative comfort|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes - he would certainly have to get involved|pg||

nt|dburn: undignified result from the Closed Room, but I suppose Liggins had a good hand|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|roswolf: anothe curiouser auction in the other rooom |pg||
nt|roswolf: the re-opening 2nt was quirky imo|pg||
nt|dburn: still, the auction might have warned him that West did not have a good hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|golfsquash: how many NT here?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this  is an ekren bid|pg||
nt|dohicky: at least 5/4|pg||
nt|roswolf: doble for penalties is good here|pg||
nt|dburn: generally, if your opponents volunteer to make 1NT, you should not yourself volunteer to make 2NT on the next tround of bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: sound david|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this wont play well|pg||
nt|golfsquash: The secret here is to get the opponents to play the hand.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|dburn: not clear what this double is, but Fitzgibbon probably will not pass it|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: quoi?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: lebensohl?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: presumably double iis t/o and 2NT is possibly LEB.|pg||
nt|roswolf: incroyable|pg||
nt|dburn: scrambling somehow, but not into a particularly attractive spot|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|dburn: still, he won't go down four, so Ireland will pick up a small swing|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|golfsquash: There were wworse places to play|pg||
nt|dburn: or a bigger one if he does not go down at all - but that is a good shift by Dixon|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup i suppose so|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|dburn: had he given South a heart ruff, declarer would have been in a position to make the contract|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|dburn: sure he would - dummy's diamond would be thrown on East's fourth heart while South ruffed with his natural trump trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like -2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||

nt|athene: but it was going to be OK for declarer i suspect|pg||
nt|viren169: Maybe we were just seeing things!|pg||
nt|athene: the defence probably would attack clubs which wouldn't worry him too much|pg||
nt|dohicky: A fairly normal 4@s here I'd guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|athene: east has a total maximum for 1@D, given he didn't open a strong club|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|athene: so he will do something interesting after 1@S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: maybe 2NT will show some splinter or something|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: i think it's normal to respond to 1@C with that west hand uncontested, but after the overcall it's not quite so clearcut|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C will be asking "what did 2nt mean?" :) crouch's systems need a lot of bids like this in them|pg||
nt|athene: because nothing means what it says|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: since you don't have the excuse of wanting to rescue partner from a non-fit in clubs |pg||
nt|ciaran: Might be hard to stop short of game now for E after the 1S |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|ciaran: With everything sitting so badly for E/W, still too high|pg||
nt|athene: east believes his partner rather than NS :) maybe he should believe the people who are vulnerable, instead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: the hearts are frozen so declarer has time to get one away on the long diamond, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: just losing a trump and a club|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: well this lead means he does have to guess hearts for the overtrick|pg||
nt|athene: i assumethat 3@H showed a club splinter, so north doesn't bother attacking clubs - he goes for the suit where his side is most likely to be able to set up tricks|pg||
nt|athene: now the roof comes in|pg||
nt|ciaran: Probably better long term to believe his partner :)|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess it's only little 50s|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: how will he play this? cross to the @SK and finesse the clubs?|pg||
nt|ciaran: ..and -150 is better than defending 1NX with vulnerable overtricks (though W might run)|pg||
nt|ciaran: Seems most likely - maybe one high club first?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the -150 or so they get from this isn't so very different from what they would have got passing out 2@D|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|dohicky: Even if Crouch guessed @h wrong he still has time to get rid of his @h before N-S get on lead again|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d3|nt|athene: yes, true, with the spade finesse on and diamonds breaking|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: south's diamond pitch announces to the world that he is holding on to some slow tricks in clubs or hearts, but i don't think that really helps declarer very much|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: this is interesting|pg||
nt|athene: south deliberately not winning the heart cheaply|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: since opener hasn't announced any suits|pg||
nt|athene: in 3nt on a club lead declarer faces an interesting problem of combining chances in various suits|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: do you bash out @SAK and three rounds of hearts ending in dummy and finesse diamonds if nothing friendly happened?|pg||
nt|athene: when the @SQ falls of course all is well|pg||
nt|ciaran: Trying for the drop in spades before finessing in diamonds looks right (certainly on this layout :))|pg||
nt|athene: then when you play two top hearts from dummy, you aren't tempted to finesse, playing south for @HJx (or @H10x) of course since you have enough tricks anyway|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: still, there doesn't seem to be any alert on 4@D, so maybe it was all natural|pg||
pc|c3|nt|viren169: nice slam that was destined to fail!|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|athene: not a bad slam at all|pg||
nt|athene: but it gets a lot worse after 3@C i guess|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: a parsimonious high-lower from Garvey there :)|pg||
nt|athene: high-low|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: more like a low-lower|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dohicky: yes I still wouldnt mind being in it though|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ciaran: They play upside-down count and attitude, so not sure what that would show|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d7|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: now he might lead the @DQ, trying to coax a cover|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well played|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|viren169: I bet Croach will be a lot happer when he finds out he has 2 trump losers!|pg||

pc|d9|pg||
nt|dohicky: Or not|pg||
nt|athene: make 6@S?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think so :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ciaran: On the board where E might have responded 4H over 1D, the Irish E did but then pulled partners double of 4S.  |pg||

nt|dohicky: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: I think the Irish will be in 6 on that one...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|dohicky: I would agree with that|pg||
nt|athene: @SK lead will be very helpful for declarer here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|athene: win the ace, bash out the @HAK, then play a spade back|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: not anymore...|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|dohicky: really?|pg||
nt|athene: they play 2@S as "I have five spades and only two hearts"?|pg||
nt|viren169: interesting auction...|pg||
nt|athene: i guess sometimes that might find a better fit but it seems insane|pg||
nt|athene: suppose partner has nothing with five hearts and no spades?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|viren169: pushy dble from Paterson|pg||
nt|athene: crouch won't leave this in will he? will surely bid diamonds or scramble somehow|pg||
nt|viren169: which may/will get left in... |pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|athene: partner might get sad if you make a habit of pulling his 800 doubles into 5-something one down|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: the more you play the warier you are about leaving in doubles of 2 of a major|pg||
nt|viren169: converted a plus score to a minus score...|pg||
nt|athene: with KQxx trumps and only small spot cards, and no shortage, it's just too risky|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dohicky: With better @s pips perhaps|pg||
nt|viren169: the two Qs are likely to be working...|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: if he had prospects of getting a ruff he might pass, since then @SKQxx is more likely to be three tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but bidding looks normal to me at imps|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ciaran: Someone will be sad alright :)|pg||
nt|athene: south goes for the immediate KO on lead|pg||
nt|athene: hoping to catch partner with some diamond length|pg||
nt|ciaran: Very friendly layout here for E/W - compensating for board 21|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the club was right though, especially bearing in mind 1@C openers can be anything|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ciaran: A club would have saved a trick or two, but this should speed up play|pg||
nt|athene: at least this line of defence has the merit of simplifying matters - either it works or it concedes the contract immediately, but you aren't usually going to be faced with lots of ...|pg||
nt|athene: teaxing problems thereafter|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt might not be quite so nice, though|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|mb|2S|nt|athene: now a 2@S raise and east probably won't move|pg||
mb|3C|nt|viren169: We'll see a lot of 1@D openings from these 2...|pg||
nt|athene: playing strong club with 14-16 NT, this sequence is almost always 11-13 balanced from opener, so you don't go wandering about at the 3-level with a ten count|pg||
nt|athene: if south bids stayman and then 3@D, north will realise there might be a club-shaped problem in 3nt|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, 3@C has sort of told him that anyway|pg||
nt|athene: no-one ever plays in a 6-4 minor fit when there's a perfectly good 4-3 major fit there|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ciaran: Had E/W nt competed in clubs, N/S would have done well to avoid 3N|pg||
nt|ciaran: not|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, we will never know if south was intending to rebid 3@D over 2@S if EW hadn't been quite so vigorous in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: he might have just bid 3nt|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: now declarer can make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|dohicky: The lead gives two tricks since even on a @h return declarer can get rid of his @h on a @d|pg||
nt|athene: he will be wondering if the lead could possibly be from @DQ1075|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i assume this is south's 4@H?|pg||
nt|athene: i thought they might do this|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|dohicky: persumably +2 now|pg||
nt|ciaran: they don't like playing in diamonds when they have any kind of heart fit :) |pg||
nt|ciaran: See board 19|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: ok, he was scared of a diamond ruff i suppose|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dohicky: or not now|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: but rising the king might get it ruffed the other way if the lead were a singleton :)|pg||
nt|dohicky: yes a choice between playing South for QT7 or just 7. Leading 7 from t& was slightly odd|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dohicky: *T7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: he will throw something on this trick|pg||
nt|athene: guarding against 4-2 trump break|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: so just making ten tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: the ruff-and-discard is the strongest defence for sure|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: if west had @HKxxx he would duck the first trump and hope to get a force on declarer's hand|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c8|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: even with trumps 3-3, this might work if east just had a slightly bigger heart|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good defense from whittaker|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|athene: but i think with weaker heart spots in hand, perhaps declarer would not have pitched at trick 1, because he would be able to anticipate that repeated ruff/discards would kill him ...|pg||
nt|athene: anyway|pg||
nt|athene: *pitched at trick 2 i mean|pg||
nt|ciaran: He wold have to use teh @HQJ to draw trumps in that case rather than ruffing with one|pg||
