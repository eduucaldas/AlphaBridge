mb|p|mb|1C|nt|golfsquash: How did the bidding go?|pg||
nt|dburn: moreover, they actually conducted an auction that went 7@h - pass - pass - 7@s, which was doubled by the player with 13 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: no doubt for fear that his partner would regard pass as forcing and try 7NT|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|2N!|nt|golfsquash: and he wasn't even giving a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|roswolf: so the board was scrubbed?|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it was - there was probably no time for them to play the real board 12|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: yes, it was obviously misboarded in the Open Room.|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm north mixing it up|pg||
nt|dburn: unlucky for England, who had a decent result in the Open Room|pg||
nt|dburn: there is a separate set of boards at each table|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: luck of the irish!?|pg||
nt|dburn: and the dealing machine had demonstrated its whimsical side only on the Closed Room board 12|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this could be bloody|pg||
nt|golfsquash: If he passes, need to play trumps early.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the putative defenders can lead trumps and get a diamond, three clubs and two spades for 300|pg||

nt|roswolf: yup |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: Presumably a spade guess at trick 2 on bd 2.|pg||
