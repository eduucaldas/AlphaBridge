nt|justin c: you prefer 5@H for east?|pg||

nt|justin c: nothing ideal really|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|pdjourdain: Hi from Patrick jourdain|pg||
nt|garnetts: Pull 5@C to 5@H |pg||

nt|jallerton: 2@c showed any 1-suited hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|justin c: 12 tricks for EW when both @S are right|pg||
nt|roswolf: the english are very aggressive|pg||
nt|justin c: was just wondering if S would make a second X|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jallerton: is 2NT natural from N here?|pg||
nt|justin c: but E got there first :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Good morning David, Justin and Patrick|pg||

pc|hA|nt|mcphee: hi folks|pg||
nt|chick: We are experiencing some difficulty with the vugraph hands, so please be patient, we'll get it fixed soon|pg||
nt|chick: hi Bob|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: will do well yo make this|pg||
nt|ady: best to play low in both hands|pg||
nt|jallerton: yes, there is still room for East to hold @cK (the EW CC does not specify a range)|pg||
nt|ady: west may be end played if winning KC if the first heart is ducked|pg||
nt|justin c: I guess if you want to play in slam , 6@C by W is as good as anything|pg||
nt|roswolf: crawling back under his stone!|pg||
nt|justin c: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwma/display.cgi?pid=display_page5&club=bangorholidaycongress&sessid=545753491721727  for current standings (scroll down)|pg||
nt|garnetts: It seems a little incongruous to me to make a marginal game try here and pass with the last hand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: west will be disappointed when he sees the full layout|pg||
nt|justin c: If you are going to ask for keycards with west, it doesnt make a lot of sense to then sign off when you have enough, does it?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning Roland|pg||
nt|justin c: buying a useful dummy for his efforts|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|vugraphzdt: Lost it|pg||
nt|justin c: likely to make 10 here, rising @SA on a trump switch and ruffing hearts|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not to worry viewgraph is really hard to manage and this happens from time to time--not sure if this will make but looks favourite to me |pg||
mc|10|nt|justin c: If you arent going to know what to do over the reply, 4NT not a good idea|pg||

mb|1S|nt|petepunt: Dennings 1@D is 0+ 11-16 |pg||
nt|ady: this could be another swing for Wales    |pg||

mb|1N|nt|eggy: wouldn't you say Peter? :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|petepunt: jones' cup is always half-full :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|eggy: I play in a team with Gary and he always believes suits will come|pg||
nt|eggy: come in|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2N pretty aggresive from East in O/R|pg||
nt|ady: Shields has found a better spot    think it very unlikely for e/w to play 3NT now|pg||
nt|petepunt: imposible for e/w to find 3n  now ?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|petepunt: may get to 4@S now|pg||
nt|eggy: Quite tough - on this auction N is very likely to hold 5 clubs  IiiI think|pg||
nt|ady: yes   might just    only 3 losers and diamonds running|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: 5@D makes too. with care.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|petepunt: big bid coming up for dixon|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzdq: the double was to show he doesn't want the heart lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|r|mb|p|nt|eggy: One problem is that if N is distributional, as is likely, neither pointed suit will break|pg||
nt|petepunt: load of extra bids,   but the same problem|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ady: pass the buck   if West had bid 3@S  I think East would pass   is still not sure of running second suit|pg||
nt|petepunt: slam try or @D game try ?|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: now should play 4 spades|pg||
mb|5D|nt|petepunt: or more likely choice of games for West to pick|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|petepunt: i thin he need to ruff 1@S early and ovid a trump promotion|pg||
nt|ady: now can make     with 4 heart tricks     tht Shields warned against heart lead|pg||
nt|petepunt: avoid :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|petepunt: May play N for Jxxxx @H's tho'|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Without the friendly lead he could afford to ruff one spade low and one high - losing only a club and an overruff |pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: if Dixon reads the heart position can make   will likely try to ruff spades out  and when this fails  can recover by taking 4 heart tricks after drawing trumps|pg||

nt|mcphee: it doesn't, but close|pg||
nt|mcphee: they must be taking a moment to hit the bar|pg||
nt|chick: may still be trying to get to the right set of hands|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is what we call teeter totter hands|pg||
nt|chick: teetering on the brink of disaster and then tottering back to normalcy?  :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: lets predict an auction|pg||
nt|petepunt: sorting boards out as we speak.  Players have right boards tho'|pg||
nt|chick: I'm starting to worry that the hands they are actually playing are not in the vugraph computer :-\|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: Thanks first time doing this|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|ady: likely to play 2H|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm now a real slam perhaps even a grand for the heroic|pg||
nt|justin c: 1NT 14-16|pg||
nt|roswolf: if they lock into hearts they may get into the grand|pg||
nt|justin c: should be able to find out the @DK missing|pg||
nt|roswolf: but diamonds is the likely trump suit = the 1nt opening should see to that|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pdjourdain: Good result for wales there and on board 15 at the other table we will see later|pg||
nt|justin c: nebulous precision type 1@D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|justin c: 3@C = 6@D i think|pg||
nt|garnetts: North will always bid almost whatever |pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: presumably transfer|pg||
nt|justin c: support X, (3@H)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: 3@H PROBE|pg||
nt|garnetts: rdble now catches NS |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: needs to shorten trumps as much as possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: Another nine!|pg||
nt|jallerton: there are some entries to hand in @d|pg||
nt|justin c: now 3@S = shortage (maybe)|pg||
nt|justin c: it does|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT will make EW with @C 4-4|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1NT has no advantage over redouble --in fact it rules out a penalty|pg||
nt|garnetts: However is East worth 3@D?  |pg||
nt|justin c: hard for him to judge|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: no splinter|pg||
nt|justin c: if there is a real @D suit in S, east's hand just falls apart|pg||
nt|garnetts: He was very aggressive on the last hand Non vul but not so here |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Normal to bid 2D|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: void splinter|pg||
nt|chick: The vugraph operator is getting caught up on some hands that have already been played, we'll get to live hands soon|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: they will play 6@D|pg||
nt|justin c: looking that way|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: nothing wrong with playing this in 2@S|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|justin c: game needs a @D break and a @C break|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Excellent try|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not so sure Patrick--depends on a number of systemic arrangements|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3N lucky to make|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|justin c: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: can take A@S   and 3 spade ruffs   2 diamond tricks and 1 club trick   then exit and wait for 8th trick|pg||
nt|justin c: wont take long|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: But well done the Jones!|pg||
nt|garnetts: The system NS were using almost forced this--No reason for EW to worry about a club lead on the auction|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: if north bids nt at any point south will raise to 3 when the defence will make hay|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: System card doesn't say but I think 2@S was an asking bid|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jallerton: a matter of partnership style whether East should bid 1@s or raise to 2@h|pg||
nt|justin c: declarer could make quite a bit of hay himself if east tries a heart lead|pg||

nt|roswolf: true|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: card lie very well indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: If so, 2N denied a high heart and 4@D was a splinter|pg||
nt|justin c: somebody applied the brakes in time|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4-4-4-1  have a tendancy not to live up to their billing often too much to do --especially with a 4-4 fit|pg||

pc|hA|nt|chick: club is best lead, but without any entries, E may never get to enjoy them|pg||

nt|roswolf: good result that for the english|pg||

nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|chick: all roads led to 10 tricks :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: board 18 is actual board 17|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Lokks a normal 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: we get to see the N/S system|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c includes all 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have around 8 tricks in spades|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jallerton: 1@d response is 4+ @h|pg||

mb|p|nt|jallerton: though West might intervene|pg||

mb|1H|nt|justin c: 4@H here I imagine|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@H or3NT is the choice|pg||
nt|chick: predictions?   1@H  2@H  4@H P, down 1 :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: now too high|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 5D is missing three aces and four hearts can be beaten with a ruff|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: This gives the free option of a double|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: but only one off|pg||
nt|justin c: good moment for a coffee|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|justin c: who is leading this event overall?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: rebid shows 15-17|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chick: although, E could save the diamond loser by setting up the @SQ for a pitch|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: agreed nothing to this |pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: difficult to blame east   2NT strong invote with 4 spades   but a simple cu at 2 level would have worked out better|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, I prefer to use 2@h as a good 4-card raise (2@c would be a good 3-card raise)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ireland on completed matches by 1 vp|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 2@C checkback|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: small swing as 5D is also one off|pg||
nt|chick: @SK|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: might be able to dump the @D loser on K@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: might be a nailbiter|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: East denied 3-card hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: vul game wins|pg||
nt|mcphee: and should make|pg||
nt|garnetts: But still not easy--might bid 3@C |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: I agree with 2@H (Acol)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 4@D splinter possible but unpopular with the ace|pg||
nt|garnetts: In fact that has to be the right choice--might bid 3@H if it was forcing --not keen on splinter as spades might be better than hearts |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Dafydd wondering what else?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2NT forcing might be OK too--bot esoteric |pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphzdt: Sorry if I can't keep up but multitasking is not my forte|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: on bd 18 the english bid 6@C for a useful swing|pg||
nt|mcphee: well passing seems a very deep postion here to me|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S can make, but he has to finesse the @S10 on the first spade trick|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jallerton: undo|pg||
nt|mcphee: or 10@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 4Nt forcing too --hadn't considered that |pg||
mb|5D|nt|jallerton: pass by South|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@h by West|pg||
nt|jallerton: Helen|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: I think Board 1 was flat not 15 to NI as the score was wrongly entered|pg||
nt|justin c: did he really rebid 4NT here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: E took quite a view here|pg||
nt|chick: yes, but I think 3N is equally dangerous ... W doesn't have to have nearly as good a hand as he actually has|pg||
nt|mcphee: so remove the Q@D and 3N is still a make|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would not expect my p[artner to dble 3@S facing a passed hand vul with a poor hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is no 1-4-4-4 12 count t/o dble|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the spade overcalll may have kept the irish out of trouble|pg||
nt|chick: yes, in the open room, EW did not make 4@S :)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: And Wales has stopped in game on board 3 when NI failed in  a slam|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: so once those two are in Wales has a lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: yip|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: The jones bid several thin making games and several thin non-making slams!|pg||
nt|justin c: this one might make|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@H will likely go off as there is no reason for West to play North for Qxx--can pick up Qxxx in the south hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: W might have passed 2@D here|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|chick: declarer has a lot of work to do, and the strong hand is exposed |pg||
nt|justin c: this auction is not sound|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 5@D asked for trump queen|pg||
nt|justin c: West would bid the same way with the @SK, for instance, when 6@H is a claimer|pg||
nt|justin c: as David said, no real reason to get the trumps right here|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: On Board 3 where Jones bid and made the thin 3N Eng are in a thin, but sounder 5@D|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Here Gary will be happy to make 11 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|jallerton: interesting double, which North may regret|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think S should have unblocked the J@D after seeing E play the 2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|chick: better for S to just bid the 2@H I think|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: thats the slam swing in but the scoring error on the first board has to be corrected|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|justin c: hard to analyze this one - potential endplays everywhere|pg||
nt|chick: good example of when a re-transfer bid is needed|pg||
nt|chick: yes, agree|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: would rather defend 4@S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|justin c: NS can win this, cash 2@C, put dec in with a @S|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: the first double by Dafydd was "poor diamonds" the second "good hearts"|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pg||
nt|mcphee: good play|pg||

pc|cK|pc|h2|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|justin c: crouch knows he can promote the @HQ here - but trying to cash a @C first to beat 5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: likely to play 4@S  e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 20 the irish didnt bid game|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1nt is a little obscure|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: It will surprise Dafydd when south runs to spades!|pg||

nt|roswolf: as is pass!!!|pg||
nt|justin c: not so obscure by west :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|chick: some might argue for opening the S hand with 1@S (not me, though)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ah sense at last|pg||
nt|mcphee: mackenzie taking a dm view of this hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: Problem is playing acol 4@H looks the bid here picture raise |pg||
nt|justin c: four rounds of @D would beat 4@S|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Overbid by Gary I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: it would I agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: slam possibilities are fair   but would fail on the lay out|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: i play penalty doubles after 1N overcall and rescue, not takeout|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is a squence where multi falls short a bit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chick: would you run to diamonds in N?|pg||
nt|mcphee: note also if declarer plays on @H he has difficulty discarding from hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: so @S is vastly superior|pg||
nt|garnetts: I disagree Patrick--4@H looks right to me|pg||
nt|justin c: tough to get to 3NT with these major suit fits|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chick: as do I|pg||
nt|chick: no need, W has rescued them|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Gary did not know the double was clearly for penalties|pg||
pc|cT|nt|justin c: spoke too soon ...|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: lack of aces is a problem for declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed justin|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: west  satisfied with game    diamonds are a a bit wesk to look for more|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: if the first X were for penalty, the 2nd one would certainly also be|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps S should take another bid|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Though his hand does suggest a NT contract|pg||
pc|hA|nt|justin c: somebody should put a red card on this|pg||
nt|petepunt: East may have been better passing and picking them up in 100's here|pg||
nt|chick: my thought also, Pete|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: quite a few play the same method as they do over a weak notrump, namely takeout doubles of any rescue|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jallerton: declarer might start with the @d finesse or maybe just lead @sQ out of hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mcphee: if 2@S shows a hand with interst in 4@H|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 4@H normal but East could be much weaker|pg||
pc|c3|nt|garnetts: One for a bidding challenge--but I cannot see how you can get to 3nt|pg||
pc|h5|nt|justin c: but not sure who|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah red cards are banned in bridge|pg||
nt|roswolf: on in football are they relevant|pg||
nt|roswolf: only|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|petepunt: we had the oppossite of this earier in the day where west had a penalty x of 2@S n the same auction and passed.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: same pair?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chick: perhaps N could bid 2N (15+), as a spec suggests :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: of course the problem is that S has no idea how many @S holds|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: dont like heart play|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Remember 2@H was Acol 9+ with 5@H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: declarer knows his fate|pg||
nt|petepunt: no damage though, avoided 4@H.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|petepunt: yes,  but GJones ahd the non-dbl choice|pg||
nt|mcphee: the N hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcphee: so opportunities for both sides on the first 2 boards|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jallerton: ...in fact neither.  This line leaves him vulnerable to forces if @s9 had not dropped|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|justin c: why not try for south for 4@S there?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|garnetts: depends how they play 2H---take the last hand for example if that is minimum then 4@H looks fine---I can hardly ever remember 3@H becoming the final contract when I played this ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: method|pg||

nt|petepunt: usually best to bid 1@S on these type of hand, even with 4points|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Fairly easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Wales has one good result to come at the other table on Board 15|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chick: NS play ACOL, so this is all natural bidding|pg||

pc|h9|nt|ady: some might try 2@C with south hand and go to 2@S if north does not show hearts   probably not right for their system|pg||

nt|vugraphzdt: lost it wrong discard recorded|pg||
nt|justin c: np|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes a good effort by Dixon who treated 10xxxx in hearts as a four card suit|pg||

mb|1N|nt|justin c: a 13 card @S fit defending 5@C |pg||
nt|roswolf: the open room auction looks very odd|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S looks like the limit to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: kib suggesting 4 hearts a make last hand   which look right|pg||
nt|ady: 109 hearts in north hand  and club holding of AJ  very good for a heart contract|pg||
nt|jallerton: Surely West does not have enough to protect here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: if he balanced with 3@D  surely east will try 3NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: probably just clarifying the NS methods: 2@h can be 5-4 either way round|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: double game swing here|pg||
nt|petepunt: top end for 3@S,  2n shows 4@S and inv|pg||
mb|2H|nt|justin c: straightforward 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: y, this needed a @D|pg||
nt|petepunt: 6@H has play,  but likely to fail|pg||
nt|chick: NS are getting high enough to X for penalty instead of a partscore|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|chick: I think we missed a Pass here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: that looks better :)|pg||

pc|h2|pc|d3|pg||

nt|chick: can make 4, with the hearts splitting|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petepunt: unless they get their @D ruff|pg||

pc|s6|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jallerton: but I don't see how the pause would demonstrably suggest any particular lead|pg||

nt|athene: 3@D opener in the open room on board 29 showed a pre-empt in either major|pg||
nt|petepunt: another slam !|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and south naturally enough assumed it was hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 6@c and 6@h both possible contracts here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 4@H suffers a club ruff|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: which led to the unusual spectacle of an 8-5 spade fit being lost|pg||
nt|justin c: the method seems rather prone to that|pg||
nt|justin c: the better your fit is, the less likely you are to believe you have it|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|roswolf: indeed the method is sub -optimal and prone to give up large minus swings|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree justin|pg||
nt|petepunt: will need care with @C posotion in 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: again, 2@D shows hearts|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pdjourdain: They play my invention of 14-16 NT in 3rd and 4th seat, weak 1st and 2nd|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ady: england extend lead   got 11 imps on hand 11 when ireland went down 2 in 4 hearts and england played 3NT making 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s control showing: an ace and a king, or three kings|pg||
nt|jallerton: presumably South can just bid 4@h now|pg||
nt|petepunt: may ruff 3@D in South and rev dummy|pg||
nt|chick: E is happy to defend @Ss|pg||
nt|petepunt: y and 2N a 4 card raise i @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: goig to be close|pg||
nt|justin c: @HA and another?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 3@D shows small doubleton with big heart support|pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe no club ruff now |pg||
pc|c8|nt|jallerton: Does 4@C agree @h?  Maybe it does, as South could have responded 2NT to show "any 6-card suit"|pg||
nt|roswolf: this also looks crazy bidding by the english but if you live by the sword occasionally you die by it|pg||
nt|chick: wonder what they play 5@S to show|pg||
nt|justin c: it is a pretty awful idea to break a @H transfer to 3@D unless you have a hand where responder shoulud declare|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|ady: 5@S?|pg||
nt|ady: Ireland got 12 imps back on hand 12   found 4@H  when england went down in 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: S believes 4n agreed clubs|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|roswolf: but you can also triumph|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chick: oh, never mind, @H is trump, not spades :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: think it needs a @D lead let through|pg||
nt|chick: so EW will get 2 hearts, and if E ducks a spade smoothly, maybe 3 @Ss|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|jallerton: to make 6@c he'll need to start with the Q from hand, then take another finesse on the 2nd round|pg||
nt|justin c: this would be a good time to play trumps|pg||
nt|garnetts: struck me that way too--|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petepunt: may lack 1 entry for dummy rev|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: should be -1 i think now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|justin c: for one of the stranger flat boards|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jallerton: looks like the natural line as he'll be in the North hand anyway: pay off to stiff K in West|pg||
nt|ady: looks like going down now|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: usually partner can re-transfer at the same level|pg||
nt|justin c: could always use a 2NT break to show a doubleton @D, if u are that way inclined|pg||

nt|petepunt: looks like 9, unless |pg||
nt|petepunt: n.s can false card to imply @S are 4-4|pg||
nt|ady: if east assumes spades likely 5-3  there will be no time to knock out both red aces so will have to play on hearts and hope for queen doubleton club to make|pg||

nt|chick: I'm sure E ruffed that last @D trick|pg||

nt|petepunt: E would have over ruffed if he had exited with a @C tho'|pg||

mb|2C|nt|roswolf: :|pg||
nt|justin c: 2NT leb, trying to play 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Seems to be helpful to the defence when they know about xx in a side suit |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|chick: I would imagine XX shows extras, inviting|pg||
nt|justin c: 'aces' hand, rather than positional values i guess|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jallerton: dbl shows a penalty double of @d|pg||
nt|jallerton: a matterof agreement what @s holding it promises|pg||
nt|ady: dixon double shows penalty pass of 2 diamonds and cards to compete|pg||
nt|ady: south likely 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: N might X when that comes back to him, or W might raise to 4@H regardless|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: a very conservative contract, especially vul|pg||

nt|chick: a hand of aces and small cards is not much use at 3N, despite the point count|pg||
