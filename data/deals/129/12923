nt|athene: but it was going to be OK for declarer i suspect|pg||
nt|viren169: Maybe we were just seeing things!|pg||
nt|athene: the defence probably would attack clubs which wouldn't worry him too much|pg||
nt|dohicky: A fairly normal 4@s here I'd guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|athene: east has a total maximum for 1@D, given he didn't open a strong club|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: so he will do something interesting after 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe 2NT will show some splinter or something|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|athene: 3@C will be asking "what did 2nt mean?" :) crouch's systems need a lot of bids like this in them|pg||
nt|athene: because nothing means what it says|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: the hearts are frozen so declarer has time to get one away on the long diamond, i guess|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|athene: well this lead means he does have to guess hearts for the overtrick|pg||
nt|athene: i assumethat 3@H showed a club splinter, so north doesn't bother attacking clubs - he goes for the suit where his side is most likely to be able to set up tricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: since opener hasn't announced any suits|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|athene: still, there doesn't seem to be any alert on 4@D, so maybe it was all natural|pg||

nt|athene: *possibly|pg||
nt|golfsquash: a chance here for N/S.|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c shows at least four hearts, assuming the Crouch system in operation|pg||
nt|athene: south is wondering what 2@H would mean now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|golfsquash: so is north?|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|golfsquash: and now wondering what is double.|pg||
nt|athene: north has lots of stuff but he still might find it hard to envisage a game|pg||
nt|golfsquash: normally doubling a 10 card fit at the 3 level is very bad news, but not here.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, EW have excellent law protection, and will feel bewildered and aggrieved as they pay out 500|pg||
nt|golfsquash: double is surely takeout but may get them to 4@s.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: very conservative by north|pg||

nt|athene: north imagines he is facing a singleton heart rather than a void|pg||
nt|athene: he can't see a game and just hoped to take this one or two down|pg||

nt|athene: board 12 was a spades vs. hearts battle|pg||
nt|athene: might well have ended in 4@SX, making luckily|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Is bd 12 going to be played?|pg||
nt|golfsquash: England did well to bid and make 4@s on 12. It can always be made, even on a diamond lead.|pg||
