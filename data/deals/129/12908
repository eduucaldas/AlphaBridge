mb|p|mb|2C|nt|rodal f: N to strong for 1NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Simple!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|gracelin: NS's best contract is 2D, but few could play that when inverted minor raise was dominaing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Full bupey given from S:)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Bill, did you notice that a trump lead is not good this time?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gracelin: 3D is still a better contract than 1NT, and maybe making except on a spade lead.|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: what would be the recommended auction to find the @D fit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: not the hand you want to hold when playing inv - very soft values|pg||
nt|Walddk3: You can't, full stop.|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Not starting with 2@c-2@s would help|pg||

nt|mrdct: this could be a good result for goren and 4@S looks to play a lot better|pg||

nt|mrdct: so the lesson is at favourable vul find any excuse you can to preempt|pg||
nt|patricck: If South bid 3@S he was worried that his partner wouldn't have the @H stop necessary to try 3NT. He couldn't bid 3@S and 3NT at the same time|pg||

pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: @H's were never even mentioned other room|pg||
nt|gracelin: East choice to repond 1D in other room is surprising, maybe it's a transfer to Heart.|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: But then there wasn't an opener in front of W either so easier to get to 3NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is not a good advertisement for strong club|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  Only if partner has @s10 and a trump sequence|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Lost Play... Sorry once again|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So the idea is to put partner in for a second trump play|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess that's fair enough, if a little unlikely|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think it is optimistic that you won't blow a trump trick doing that|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|gracelin: This is the last hand of the set on display.  Guess there wll be a dinner break before the next set starts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Yes, it was a lot more complicated than it looked ... even ruffing with the ace could be the right play|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Hans - Ware did bid this one at least|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: Next is last board of set- restart is 8.30 sydney time - Queensland don't observe daylight saving time or at least not the last time i was there :) |pg||
nt|bgn: yes - if W started with 3 to the K|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|bjacobs: This is another big opportunity for Goren ... if they can reach 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|bgn: there was a hand earlier where this EW pair found the wastage with AKJx opp a singleton after 1NT opening and stopped out of trouble|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can 5@C make perhaps?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  5@d may be ok as well|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good morning all from sunny London|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bgn: I think so - say @S lead, two @S pitches, @C (not 9) to ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is a very good result for the Hans team. 6NT can always make, 6@C can't on a diamond lead as Patrick Carter pointed out in the other room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so about 2 hours from now is restart time|pg||
nt|gracelin: South will get squeeze threw in at the end if declarer guess the position.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: board 20 actually made 12 tricks +640|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is also a heart finesse to take if he so wishes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They seem to be on a magical mystery tour here|pg||
mb|4S|an|!|nt|pelepele: 1hour and 45 mins till next session|pg||
nt|gracelin: Diamond lead will not hurt 6C either, the same squeeze throw in will come into play.|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: This may well give away the heart position|pg||
mb|p|nt|bgn: my first thought is 5@C better chance than 5@D after @S lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: David Greenwood suggests another Beatles hit ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Help!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or maybe "It's a hard day's night"?|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: Declarer could even duck the D lead to squeeze south in the majors.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|kiwibridge: 24 to go so Goren are still in the match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C can actually also make. South will be strip squeezed|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: intense bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I like that description|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And of course, 6@D is not a bad contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: I think it's splendid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Although, even if both minors are 3-2, it's a bit awkward on a spade lead|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Much better than mine|pg||
nt|bgn: If you get a @H lead and finesse, can you make? I fear not|pg||
nt|Walddk3: It's less than 30% mind you|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: Doesnt any bad minor break make this a difficult contract? Then .68 X .68?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: It's worse than those 34%, Julie|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes. .68 squared to get started.  But on a spade lead, you cannot draw trumps, so it's a bit rough|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: some conveying of words is going on|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: That is just the easy assessment |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bgn: ominous lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nabil doesn't know it, but he's playing for +3 or +5 imps by minimizing the damage|pg||
nt|bgn: Even if he can't make, Nabil has chance to pick up 3 or 5 IMPs just by going less off, so it's worth fighting on :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Two rounds of trumps and another club is ok for one down isn't it?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: Right now, he is focusing on making the damned thing|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: Which really requires a trick 1 duck|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|gracelin: bye all and thanks.|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer hopes the DQ be ducked, then he will shift  to spades for 4 tricks.|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: KS felling JS allows 4 spade tricks 2@H,2@C 2@D? and club likely onside|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some food left if decl find it. @SK and a @S|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer could actually establish some spade trucks and doesn't need the club finesse, but he didn't know and will probably take the finesse.|pg||
nt|gracelin: tricks|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: on going discussion in this household|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|gracelin: or he might come to hand with DK and play a Heart, trying for some squeeze position a the end|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: planning|pg||
nt|gracelin: in fact if declarer plays a Heart now and West is able to cash 3 tricks, then a double squeeze must work.|pg||
nt|gracelin: as long as West guards spade (from bidding) and East Diamond (from play).|pg||
nt|rodal f: U have a nice point:) And could have been so|pg||
nt|gracelin: anyway, all roads lead to making 3NT|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: stil in tank|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|h3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|rodal f: Drove for ures:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: he works it out, but HK is surprisingly with East, so declarer needs to formulate a new plan, which maybe a simple finesse of CQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit more problems now to find the @S since E tell zerro left|pg||
nt|rodal f: If @D10 comes|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: @D by E- can afford to duck 1 round to get squeeze timing if 4441 and QC. Club exit leaves no choice?|pg||
nt|gracelin: another sure play is to cash SA then spade to K, if East keeps 3-3 in minors, then 3-round of clubs to end-lay East.  If east only keeps 2D, then establish a D trick.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gracelin: he can play CJ now and follow the end-play line if CQ is with West.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|gracelin: SA then SK now|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I don't need a household, I don't even agree with myself|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bjacobs: My advice on trump leads is simple: if there's a good reason to lead a trump, then do so|pg||
pc|h4|nt|qwikjanz: lol :) Hard to see that an auction with no known fit would suggest an opening trump lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right.  The worst cliche in the entire bridge world is: "when in doubt, lead trumps"|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I am taking notes, Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk3: "If there's a good reason to lead a trump, then do so"|pg||
