mb|2S!|mb|3S|nt|minimonkey:  2S is the other major and a minor|pg||
nt|galadriel: EW have very good save|pg||
nt|scotty: The 2@s bid should make it easy for declarer to make 11 tricks via a deep finesse in clubs - once he shows up with doubleton spade, it is marked|pg||
nt|scotty: 6@d doubled down 1 is par|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|scotty: 3N asks for the minor|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  Should E show diamonds over 4S with this hand Michael?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|scotty: West will come again over 4@s, and N will have to decide|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: E should never bid again having bid 2@s|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  So it is up to W to force another bid from his partner|pg||
nt|scotty: 6@d down 2, not down 1, sorry|pg||
nt|galadriel: In the closed room W had a chance to make a fit jump of 3@D over @H overcall|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|galadriel: But he bid 3@C|pg||
mb|d|mb|5D|nt|galadriel: Wonder what that meant?|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimonkey:  As 4S need not be based on values Sime has X'd to show extras|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: North might have bid 4@c over 3N, to help his partner.  But this may also work - his partner's failure to double 5@d, makes bidding more attractive|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|minimonkey:  2 aces and a king are an opener in whatever seat you are in|pg||
mb|1H|nt|scotty: 2-suited bid was a double-edged sword there - it got a great result, but if N-S reached 5@s it gave them a road map to make it|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|minimonkey:  Matesons bid isnt clear over 1S by his partner|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  3S?|pg||
nt|scotty: The vulnerability saves West from getting into trouble here - a club contract would do poorly|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|scotty: 4@s is a lot with a light hand and a poor holding in their suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|scotty: Even with the friendly lie of the cards, I don't think you can make 12 tricks by force |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|galadriel: majors behaving nicely|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  on a 3-2 trump break this seems easy enough|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  but if W had 4 how could N safeguard the contract?|pg||
nt|scotty: 11 will be no problem - but that is another imp to Ireland|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  Seems right to play a heart here|pg||
nt|scotty: I guess E may duck the heart defending game - searching for a way to beat this|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  trying to get some ruffs with the bad trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: sorry lost the play|pg||
nt|scotty: Heart is 100% clear|pg||
nt|galadriel: np Ros|pg||
mc|12|nt|scotty: It's invariably correct to tackle the side suit before trumps - unless you can see a clear path to success by playing trump|pg||

nt|dohicky: taken|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: Interesting hansd - right play in spades is somewhat dependant on how aggressive a multi is played|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|barnets: so england are now in the lead ?|pg||

mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: another Multi and N must bid his void!|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|minimonkey:  (Even with the commentators curse I dont think they are landing elsewhere)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|minimonkey:  seems like 11 is possible , 3 hearts, 4 diamonds, 3 spades and a club|pg||
nt|galadriel: I'm guessing 10 tricks|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  but 10 seems reasonable|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  If this loses to the queen then Sime may play diamonds from the top|pg||
nt|scotty: Only 7 sure tricks here, in spite of the 29 HCP|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  as if E has the Qx of diamonds then he can drop it|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  similarly playing hearts towards the table and putting in the 9 if E plays low is also right|pg||
nt|scotty: If the lead is attitude, he probavly should have played @cJ - they might have AQ, and hopefully theu have at least one of them|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  Leads are 3/5th|pg||
nt|scotty: W will play a spade|pg||
nt|scotty: He knows there is no point in setting up clubs - partner cannot have @cA AND a side entry|pg||
pc|s3|nt|scotty: Ok, if 3rd/5th then trick 1 is just a guess|pg||

nt|minimonkey:  Kind of West to put up the queen there|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|scotty: No real reason to safety play in @d - if E gains the lead and declarer misguesses clubs, he knows fron the lead that West will not have any more clubs |pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|minimonkey:  Twalsh in play again|pg||
nt|scotty: Looks makeable - the pointed suits lie well for crossruffing|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|minimonkey:  So 1D shows hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimonkey:  3H is 15-17 Unbalanced 4H|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|minimonkey:  and now W must be pretty excited for slam with W probably having a diamond shortage|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|dburn: West unlikely to stop out of a slam now, and as Michael says, he may well make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimonkey:  Note: 4C denied a spade control so when E bids 4D he shows at least a 2NT round control in spades|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  the 4C and 4D bids were showing either 1st or 2nd round control of that suit, either an ace, a king,a singleton or a void|pg||
nt|dburn: or East may well make it, since he will end up as declarer|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  and I meant 2nd not 2NT|pg||
nt|dburn: she, sorry|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|minimonkey:  diamond lead seems normal enough from South|pg||
nt|dburn: but if Matheson can [a] lead a diamond, looking like a man short in the suit, and [b] somehow know to duck when a spade is played to the king, declarer might adopt a losing line|pg||
nt|scotty: On a @d lead, declarer will cross to dummy in trump, and lead a spade|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|scotty: This lead will make it much easier|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|minimonkey:  but apparently not, the ace of spades was not in my top many choices|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|dburn: still, Matheson has some experience of defending against Irish slams - you cash your ace, then you lead to partner's ace, then you wait for your trump tricks|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|scotty: In the Italian cuebidding style (which I have no idea that E-W play here), 4@c denies a spade control,  so 4@d promises one|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|galadriel: and we saw in the last match, it was the only lead to beat slam - leading your A|pg||
nt|dburn: obscure bidding at the other table - West never seemed to support hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: and I am inclined to have some sympathy with East's view that 4NT was natural on the actual auction|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  I think that shows that listening to the auction before leading against a slam is key...people explain it to me when I (frequently) let one through|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, West was rather crossed up by his partner's 3@s, which left him unable to support hearts at a convenient level below game|pg||
nt|scotty: More accurate was to cash @dK first, cross to a trump, ruff a @d, unblock trump, cross to @cA draw trump, claim|pg||

mb|p|nt|eamongall: I bought it ...in a bookstore in Boston some years ago |pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|minimonkey:  So David, will the irish defend the Scottish slam in the same way or do you only cash your ace and wait for your trump tricks|pg||
nt|scotty: Another good slam - which might fail becayuse of poor lie of rounded suits|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dburn: this one may be awkward, though - getting a club ruff in the North hand looks like the easiest way to go about it, but will fail|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|scotty: Dummy reversal can succeed if, and only if, a @d is led|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  So 2S by Matheson must show extras (if he had bid it)|pg||
nt|minimonkey:  this might dampen Simes enthusiasm enough|pg||
nt|dburn: alternative is a dummy reversal, ruffing three diamonds in the South hand, but entries for that are on the thin side|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: 3@h no doubt forcing - good method, that - and South might have tried 3@s, but his diamond void and his four low clubs incline him to caution|pg||
