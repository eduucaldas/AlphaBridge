nt|rodal f: 2@D non forcing it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: quite a reasonable opening -- unlikely to work well here though|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well practical if not scientific|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now all East has to do is make it.|pg||

nt|sharkey: Red suit lead cud easily cost and S knows how the @S suit is distributed|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|xenya: note the @CA lead -- normal tactics against the gambling 3N to cash an ace first in the hope to get a few quick tricks|pg||

pc|s4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: declarer should lead the ten of hearts from dummy at an early stage. this has the most ways to win.|pg||
nt|roswolf: it might come down to south doing a crocodile coup in diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: S can always overtake the Q@d|pg||
nt|begse: 6@d ya kör atagý lazýmdý batýrmaya ki zor|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: was thinking..lead the @D3...ten, ace then maybe six towards dummy - if S plays low, N wins Q and has to concede a ruff-sluff, if the hand had been eliminated. Not possible now of ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: course|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: Bülent güneyin antresinin ne olduðunu mu düþünüyor|pg||

pc|h7|nt|roswolf: the club jack is the pseudo threat|pg||

pc|h2|nt|yusufb: tersi tabii@c ve @d karýþtý:)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when S plays the ten od Ds on first round of suit, clear for N to unblock the queen|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then no crocodile necessary|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it will be most annoying for North in the other room if his team-mates come back with -100  |pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the heart length is surely with N, so if he has Qxxx (no nine) the heart ten on 1st round of suit works by brute force. even if he has Q9xx, he may not cover, and if perchance he ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: has Qx after all  it is almost sure he will not cover|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but.........|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think Hedy's reference to "@H 9x @@ S" was an endorsement of this play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if hearts are 33 it makes no difference which heart is led from dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe i should not have said it |pg||
nt|roswolf: i think if declarer had ducked a diamond earlier he might have pulled it off|pg||
nt|roswolf: i just dont see how the defenders can go wrong|pg||

nt|hedyg: i remember my 1st ever teamgame competition i was told: never double a partial except if you have enough SURE tricks to beat it in your hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: such as opps playing 3 M and you have AKQJ10 in the suit was the example i was given|pg||
nt|gulyas: slam only goes down cos of the 4-0 trumps in fact|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps a little extreme but sound enough principle|pg||
nt|sharkey: Krøjgaard upgrades with the playing strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: i suppose we don't know the systems here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: just a little extreme :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4-0 trumps is not enough to beatthe slam, also spades must be 5-1|pg||

nt|gulyas: makes no diff, u lose a @D and a trump (discard 4th @H on the @SK at end)|pg||
nt|yusufb: günaydýn herkese|pg||
nt|babydolldk: 2@C a kind of reverse drury|pg||
nt|xenya: probably 2@C was sort of relay (GF?) and 2@D showed a minimum hand|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm told EW play reverse drury over major-suit openings in all positions|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: does W hand qualify for reverse?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: yes fielders choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if spades wre not 5-1 it would be an easy make with correct single-dummy handling of trump suit|pg||
