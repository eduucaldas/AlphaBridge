nt|othered1: west has taken 4@C as showing @S fit?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Dafydd thought 3S was a slam try with hearts agreed but it was merely meant to show 4 spades|pg||
nt|scotty: Perhaps W was supposed to bid 3@s directly over 2N, and this sequence showed 4-5?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|othered1: new minor forcing auctions may require case-by-case agreements.  |pg||
nt|scotty: 3N over 3@h would typically show 5-card @h and Choice of Games|pg||
nt|othered1: Not necessarily all that different from what you need to agree to play 4th suit forcing successfully|pg||
