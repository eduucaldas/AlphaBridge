nt|finch: about as good as the previous one, but this one has the advantage of making on the normal single-dummy line|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not great by any means|pg||
nt|finch: clubs coming in plus the pointy finesse of your choice (when played by South)|pg||
nt|finch: it's slightly better by North as you have time to find out if the 10 of hearts is short before taking a spade finesse|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|d|an|4-5!h|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: And the eternal debate, whether to open 1@C or 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am a one clubber|pg||
mb|1S|an|Unbal|mb|p|nt|finch: I like the open the suit my partner has 5-card support for|pg||
nt|finch: double shows a normal 1H bid |pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|finch: double shows hearts, 1@H shows spades, and 1@S shows the 'impossible' hand - balanced but not suitable for NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3NT is premature I think|pg||
nt|finch: Slam would be even worse at this table with the spade finesse more likely to be wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has plenty of room below 3NT|pg||
pc|dT|nt|finch: 3@C is non-forcing - I'm not sure where else North thinks they could be going|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe north was afraid to go past 3N, as south might just prefer @C tothe 4-level.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North would normally have 5+ clubs on this auction. Perhaps the South hand is too good for an invite?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: What do you think, Frances and Ed?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|finch: To be honest I'd have roughly the same auction (except I'd open 1@D)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|finch: but the South hand looks normal for an invite.  And 3NT also looks to be the right contract|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd likely do the same.  I don't think south's hand is exceptional for the 31C call|pg||

nt|jallerton: a nice close match|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 1@d shows a natural 1@d opening - BUT it is not a balanced hand|pg||
mb|3C|nt|xenya: that was quick|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: no problem Jan, you are surely NOT to blame:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: if they need someone to blame then I am ready to be the one -- used to it -- my wife do it all the time|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 6@c is optimistic but is makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s is 4.th suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: Both 3NT and 5@c are sensible contracts.  6@c is indeed optimistic|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|ralfwil: But they are there:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: and 6@c is worse played by South|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: agree. Both jaws is on N|pg||
nt|jallerton: A spade lead looks most likely|pg||
nt|jallerton: forcing declarer to finesse at trick 1|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: and an equally quick 2 down i suppose|pg||
nt|ralfwil: too bad communications to aviod tge @s finess|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: EW leads are 1-3-5 against trumph and 2.4. against nt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @s finess|pg||
nt|jallerton: It's a shame Roland isn't playing in the Danish Teams.  I'm sure he'd be in this one!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: Ouch, 3nt by s is a lot easier.|pg||
nt|jbgood: and game in @h - one of the denominations available to get the gaqme bonus|pg||

nt|jbgood: 12 of the 14 imps difference was the starting point - as a carry over from a previous encounter|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|peacokk: EW better stay low on this one|pg||
nt|jbgood: the Blakset lead is a carry over from previous encounter|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: NS playing 5card major and 15-17nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: EW plays 5-card major and 14+-17 nt|pg||
nt|jbgood: if N can get to know that Auken has a 5 card @d suit - difficult if Fredin jumps in|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzey: 3@h = 10-12 and 3@s|pg||
nt|jallerton: EW play strong NT, NS play weak NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d = 5+@c and eighter invitational to game or invitational to slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|jallerton: maybe 2@h shows a weak NT type hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|vugraphzey: 4nt = 1430 |pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 5@c = one ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@h shows only 3-card @c ... and a weak nt-hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|vugraphzey: NS leads 1.3.5.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jbgood: was 4@c just a game force?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 4@c is explained as 2-suiter and GF |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jbgood: a likely 2 down..|pg||
nt|jbgood: the double by N was really a tough bid|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jallerton: maybe direct 3@c over 2@h would have been stronger and he has to go via 2@s to sign off|pg||

pc|h3|nt|jallerton: He might be able to make it double dummy with a red suit squeeze against South, but that must be worse odds|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|peacokk: I think it's too hard|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jbgood: i do too|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the final double may have warned about the bad trump split so much that declarer actually may bet out cheaper than with no opposition bidding|pg||

nt|finch: the non-trump lead at the other table was somewhat surprising, but 2@H looks untouchable|pg||
nt|finch: snap|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: It's one of the classic lead trumps positions|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: 2@S I don't quite understand|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder why the preference|pg||
nt|finch: North had a bit of a problem over 2@H which is typically played as forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: 2@h was forcing|pg||
nt|finch: I have quite a lot of sympathy for 2@S|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Indeed, and that's why 1NT is a better response than 2@D|pg||
nt|finch: the alternative was not to respond 2@D in the first place|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|othered1: Interesting that it's forcing opposite a potentially weak hand (for the 2/1 call)|pg||
nt|finch: Normal for this sort of style is 2@D is about 9+ - he's got a minimum|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If partner passes 1NT, which game will you have missed?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: But even with that agreement, most players promise a rebid when they bid 2/1.|pg||
nt|finch: 3NT when partner has a balanced 15-16|pg||
nt|finch: the choice of whether to make a 2/1 is on that premise - if partner passes 1NT with strong NT values, will we miss game|pg||

nt|vugraphzey: NS leads are 2.4.|pg||
nt|jbgood: second from top i mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: but later in the "game" they play 2.4. with attitude -- so then they play 2. from 4 bad ones|pg||

nt|jallerton: East has a decision to make now.  3@C?  3@S?  Force to game with 3@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  now 3@d as a game try by N?|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@d is a kind of "reversed Drury" ... 2@d shows that W has an opening hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: N awaits a high ! contract ..|pg||
nt|jbgood: @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 2@c is a kind of "reversed Drury" ... 2@d shows that W has an opening hand|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: 3 @h is by most players just a fight - strange action by N|pg||
nt|jallerton: With West haveing a light opening bid (Fredin passed in the other room) the low road works well|pg||

pc|c3|pg||

nt|finch: I wouldn't normally worry about a clashing event in Australia when I was setting my timetable in Denmark|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: http://viewsfromthebridgetable.blogspot.com/2007/03/canap-jump-overcall.html  for canapé jump overcalls|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Well, the thing is what the selectors are supposed to do when you choose to play in Australia rather in your national championships|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's a dilemma|pg||
nt|finch: Easier if the selectors just say they'll pick the winning team, but that's a long-standing debate|pg||
nt|finch: The English BU deliberately avoid clashing their premier league with the US Nationals, but I doubt would try and avoid anything else|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|finch: East can see the potential for a lot of tricks opposite, say, a 4=3=1=5 so will make a mild slam try|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|finch: Slam will make if declarer finds the king of diamonds, but it's not a great contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: Actually slam is better than that, once spades are 2-2 it makes with the king of clubs with south|pg||
pc|h5|nt|finch: This will take a bit of thought|pg||
nt|finch: Declarer can play for trumps 2-2 and something nice happening in the minors|pg||
nt|finch: which works, or he could try for the club finesse right followed by a cross-ruff|pg||
nt|finch: which doesn't|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|finch: this is the not working line|pg||
nt|finch: seems to me to be a complete guess where the king of clubs is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are at the DBF Headquarters in Asminderød, around 25 miles North of the capital Copenhagen|pg||
nt|finch: he's not off yet single dummy; with trumps 2-2 he still can choose between the ruffing diamond finesse and a short king|pg||
nt|finch: but neither works|pg||
nt|finch: South will spend quite a while trying to work out if it matter what he plays next|pg||
nt|finch: although he will suspect that it probably doesn't.  |pg||

nt|jallerton: This is the last board of the set. Thank-you to Jan Nielsen, our excellent vu-graph operator.|pg||
nt|jallerton: Thanks also to my co-commentator, Ralf Willquist|pg||
nt|jallerton: Thanks also to the DBF (Jacob Duschek and Matias Rohrberg) for arranging the broadcast, |pg||
nt|jallerton: ..finally thanks to BBO and Roland Wald for making this broadcast possible.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thank Jan for your nice work and Jeffrey for nice cooperation:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: We are a little behind schedule --- we are ready to start the last segment in about one hour and 5 minutes.|pg||
nt|jallerton: 6@s has a lot of work to do on this deal - went off in the other room even with @sQx onside|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|henryb:  I think it is better to use the intermediate step as the (artificial) game try, and double as a suggestion of penalty|pg||
nt|peacokk: Isn't it as playing with a junior - every game-try is a way to game|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Do you have time for dinner, Jan?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: If you know my weight you wouldnt be asking ... I look like one who ALWAYS have time for dinner :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: and today is no exception .... I promise :)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzey: 3@h is transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 3@s shows 3-card @s .. with only two North would bid 3nt|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|henryb:  that is a brave balance|pg||
nt|jbgood: Difficult for Konow to win this board - but may get a push|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H!|nt|jallerton: Well you have worked hard for it today.  Enjoy!|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: 5@h = 2 aces an no @sQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: a play problem to end with then|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: still.  South has to lead something|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: if this wins the match is all square|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|jbgood: the step - balance sure is breave:) |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jallerton: that lead helps declarer more than the @h selected in the other room|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|c3|nt|jallerton: he can now count 12 tricks if @s are 2-2, but can he make it on 3-1 spades?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jbgood: and the balance was not found at the other table|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jbgood: bye all - see you in an hour or so for the next 16|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzey: if the match ends "all square" after the last 16 boards tonight, then Konow will earn a place in tomorrows final |pg||
nt|jallerton: might try @c finesse now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jbgood: 9 imps with 2 sessions to go|pg||
