mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|janm: We get to start off with a slam hand, but probably not one that will generate a swing|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|janm: When you're the leading team, you want hands like this where there are enough extra values in the two hands ot make it likely that slam will be bid in both rooms - and an ace off ...|pg||
nt|janm: so unlikely anyone will get overboard|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|janm: And just in case someone makes a mistake and bids 6NT, the A of clubs is onside, so that won't generate a swing either|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: E in the tank |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|janm: Presumably trying to decide whether to lead an aggressive diamond into declarer's second suit or not - decided not |pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|janm: Hanlon-McGann play a sort of Polish-y club? Does it include hands with long clubs so that 1@d is always a real suit?|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: 1D can have longer c |pg||
nt|janm: West|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: but think it is real suit|pg||
mb|2S|mb|4D|nt|janm: Sorry - West's hand isn't really enough to want to raise anyway, but if he had a little more it would be relevant|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|qwikjanz: 5D is good save against major game although 11 tricks available in either major|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Tough for either E or W to save at equal vul. |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|an|!|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: a 3rd article added one more tweak to become ASPTRO|pg||
nt|ahollan1: basic was 2@C guarantees @H  2@D guarantees @S  -- the other changed depending upon which variation is used|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: It looks as if 2@c was a constructive raise if 1@c was clubs or a weak NT, and then 2@s showed that he had a strong club and primary spades, 3@d was also natural, 3@h was some sort ...|pg||
nt|janm: of 4th suit, looking for a heart stopper perhaps. 3NT and 6NT natural|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|d2|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|h5|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: actually has some communiocation problems if QC ducked|pg||

nt|janm: best because you don't need diamonds to split. If you think he doesn't, and will find the shift, then maybe best to play for diamonds 3-2|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|d2|pc|s8|pg||

nt|janm: I guess he's trying to get some sort of count on the hand to decide how to play the diamonds |pg||

mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: An aggressive bid by Hanlon that won't be successful on this hand unless he convinces NS to save|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: no play for 4H - but at least no X yet :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ..yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: paused, askd for an explination, then passed|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|janm: Hard for N to DBL; his partner might have made the initial TO DBL on a hand with less defense|pg||

pc|h7|nt|janm: Now they need to take the clubs to get the maximum, but will beat it in any case|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|janm: Hanlon needed the heart K onside to make his ambitious game, so took the finesse, event though it might give the opponents another chance to cash 3 clubs and beat him 2|pg||

nt|qwikjanz: run hearts and keep fingers crossed :)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|janm: He can't even try playing some trumps to see if they'll pitch enough spades, since he needs to ruff the diamond|pg||

nt|janm: Many people play the DBL after 1X-1Y-1Z as showing the fourth suit with moderate support for partner, but I'm surprised to see Hanlon doing it with only 4 hearts - I'd expect 5|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|mrnye: I guess he feels like he needs to do something with his good 12 count and that X is the most descriptive.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|janm: More often than not, when one side is way down and tries to pick things up, they end up just getting farther behind. Doesn't mean that it isn't the right strategy to bid aggressive ...|pg||
nt|janm: games, though - you need a lot of luck to come back from a big deficit, so it's right to bid as if you're going to get the luck|pg||
nt|janm: Is Makaruk really thinking about punishing his opponent for balancing by bidding a game? If he does he'll be disappointed to find that he has 3 quick losers|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: perhaps pressure of thinking opps are going to bid the aggressive game causing him to think?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|mc|10|nt|janm: Even with the disastrous slam off AK of hearts, though, NS have a pretty solid session and a very comfortable lead, so shouldn't need to push|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: 18 EW played 5C X -3 so 9 to hans  137-72|pg||
nt|janm: But it's an interesting question whether a team that's leading by a large margin should adopt the same aggressive tactics they're expecting from the trailing team|pg||
