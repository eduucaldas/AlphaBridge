nt|andreasw:  so E-W will take the points back here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Double was not particularly aggressive, was it? He has limited his hand with a 2@H bid and now wants to compete somewhere.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sorry, I mis-read your comment. Yes, you are right, the double was aggressive and the redouble a good move.|pg||
nt|april7: agiansst 4 trumps its not so easy to play but Q of @D will be found and W might lose only 1@H 1@C and perhaps a second @H|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: In my view it's quite charming when you're actually allowed to bid the suits you have. Having 57 conventions on your card does not automaticfally make you a better player|pg||
nt|brolucius: Unlucky board for North. He thought he could rely on his opponents' bidding (stopping in 2@H) and discovered too late that it was unreliable.|pg||
nt|april7: should play @C and then  trumps , but E might be shortened in trumps|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but playing transfer responses to 1NT should be one of the first 2 or 3 conventions that you insist on playing.|pg||

nt|andreasw:  by S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If I was told that I could only play one convention, I would choose negative doubles. The rest I can live without|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: A risky line of play, since a diamond misguess would have left declarer with no protection in spades. He might perhaps have tried diamonds before drawing trumps.|pg||
