nt|curtsolo: she asked for the @d back in case he could get an upper cut with his second ruff attempt|pg||
nt|daveharty: and another soft result for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzqq: Short break|pg||
nt|daveharty: 8 to go and stuck 71...we could be in for some wild actions, or perhaps EW have decided the best they can do is just not give away any more|pg||
nt|curtsolo: I would have liked to see the full auction at the other table - the last hand appeared to be a sacrifice by NS and EW let it go|pg||
nt|curtsolo: then again, with a large lead, no need for Pressly/Stewart to make a speculative double, right?|pg||
nt|daveharty: EW just haven't gotten the sort of hands they need|pg||
nt|daveharty: just a lot of "heads you win, tails we break even" sorts of hands|pg||
nt|curtsolo: while we're on the short break, I'd like to thank all the kibs for joining us, especially the contingent from my old stomping grounds of KC... many partners and teammates are in ...|pg||
nt|curtsolo: the gallery|pg||
nt|curtsolo: and your old stomping grounds as well, Dave|pg||
nt|daveharty: no way for EW to pick up anything on this one, unless Stack opens 1C and it gets passed out, which seems unlikely|pg||
nt|daveharty: yes true Curt|pg||
nt|curtsolo: I suspect 2NT might be Stack's choice here|pg||
nt|daveharty: yes looks like a 2NT hand to me|pg||
nt|curtsolo: I cannot stomach 2@c with Qx of diamonds|pg||
nt|daveharty: a kib asks if south might pass 2NT|pg||
nt|daveharty: it's possible I suppose|pg||
nt|curtsolo: with 4 points and a four card major, unlikely|pg||
nt|vugraphzqq: here we go|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello David and Vladimir|pg||
nt|ady: n/s need to find a way to 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Roland   hi all|pg||
nt|davidstern: We're back|pg||
mb|1H|nt|curtsolo: one thing you have to keep in mind is that players in your seats in the other room are down big and will press for games|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: with that opening  might get to 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|curtsolo: so you can't go conservative - you have to press right with them to keep parity|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|shevek: Jan Jansma and Gert-Jan Paulissen won this event the last couple of times|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: I need to shut down|pg||
nt|davidstern: @H to King and club back....|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daveharty: true, although with a huge lead it might be understandable not to press for nonvulnerable games|pg||
nt|curtsolo: standard Puppet Stayman sequence getting them to 4@h here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Diederik van Huijstee|pg||
nt|snowface: thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: EW play very light openings when white, with pass showing a 1D opening|pg||
pc|hT|nt|curtsolo: 3@s showing four card @h suit to get the contract right-sided|pg||
nt|sybarra2: what is Vongsvivut name,  does he have first name?|pg||
nt|daveharty: stack likes the sound of hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzqq: Arba|pg||
nt|curtsolo: first name is Arba (spelling uncertain)|pg||
nt|ady: this should make for the loss of 2 trump tricks  and A@D|pg||
nt|davidstern: This shouldn't be pretty but quite a reasonable contract|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|davidstern: Easy club now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|curtsolo: so much for having the strong hand declare it, eh?|pg||
nt|daveharty: so he makes an advance cuebid, in case partner has greater ambitions|pg||
nt|davidstern: But what then by north|pg||
pc|cT|nt|daveharty: good lead, will hold this to ten tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|curtsolo: all roads lead to 10 tricks... round suits breaking|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|davidstern: Low club best but....|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe a @s ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: I think @c6 is 2/4|pg||
nt|davidstern: Still trying to worth out club situation|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: so Paulissen knows that declarer has one other card above the 6|pg||
nt|davidstern: Whatever he plays I will guess not making only a metter of how many|pg||
nt|davidstern: Brave arent I|pg||
pc|cK|nt|curtsolo: yes, 11 tricks available on non-@d lead it appears|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: 4@H always makes but the natural @D lead made it somewhat easier for declarer|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|curtsolo: I like Arba's choice to attack here|pg||
nt|davidstern: Had to play @C in case the diamond and cluib honours were other way around|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|daveharty: again, this is NOT what EW need...nothing more discouraging when you are way down than for your opponents to get the cards!|pg||
nt|davidstern: Give declarer A*& QJ652 K75 10x and it would all be consitent|pg||
nt|davidstern: consisten|pg||
nt|davidstern: t|pg||
nt|shevek: :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: No harm though but the @HA will likely go MIA|pg||
nt|davidstern: = Missing in Actio|pg||
nt|davidstern: n|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: @c6 was indeed 2/4, de Wijs asking now|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|curtsolo: his efforts will only net him an imp, though|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|shevek: EW play Tarzan Precision: http://www.infobridge.it/Sistemi_CC_Muller-DeWijs.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: I think that the @cK was the right card by Paulissen|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: even if a low club saves a trick, it doesn't gain a tempo|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|curtsolo: a bit easier to attack leading through the big hand... normally when you have 2NT on your right, you would be inclined to defend passively and try not to give tricks away|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h3|nt|sybarra2: we have all been in this situation  (and try to smile all the way)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|ady: even without diamond lead   can ruff a spade   and play a diamond    better I than playing a trump |pg||

nt|jtr: 7 either doubleton or 973|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|snowface: 1@s = 5+ card, about 9-16 hcp|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|daveharty: a potentially profitable sac for EW here but very tough at these colors|pg||
nt|curtsolo: often in a KO where you are down huge going into the last quarter, you will see the trailing team withdraw... and in this case, they had to stick it out to the end because they ...|pg||
nt|curtsolo: knew their match was being covered here on BBO|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|snowface: 2@h GF|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Thanks for joining, Diederik|pg||
nt|snowface: very welcome|pg||
nt|ady: light opening at red from east     ok when partner has that hand  as long as they dont get too high|pg||
nt|xenya: now they will sniff at slam but should stop in 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|curtsolo: well, the stars are aligned for Stack here, because partner just hit him|pg||
mb|p|nt|daveharty: yes and another push likely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@S is 9-16, David|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: Maybe you did not not see that|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: 1NT was 12-15|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: I tht at white Roland|pg||
pc|hK|nt|curtsolo: I don't consider the N cards good enough to double and bid|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: this lead may work out very well|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|curtsolo: but perhaps Stack considered AQT of the other major adequate in case partner bid (or jumped in) @h|pg||
nt|ady: well in spite of their system they have got overboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: 1S still 9-16 at these colors|pg||
nt|snowface: Maybe after 4@d Danny had done enough with 4@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Danny: we open super-light|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: declarer will finesse twice in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: if Jansma continues hearts, it will be bloody|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: although declarer is marked with the queen of hearts, and Jan may decide there is more future in spades|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|ady: this is 25 percent  at best|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|daveharty: right, but 6-3 is a pretty big disparity!|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|curtsolo: presumably he had a plan in place for when partner bid 3@c, right?|pg||
nt|ady: seems west new of 2 aces   but had no idea if east had any firther strenth or the quality of spades   10 and 9 with the ace|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c5|nt|snowface: perhaps the confusion was caused by the fact that E could not have 6 spades in 6-11 range|pg||
nt|snowface: the system has two weak two openings for both majors|pg||
nt|snowface: direct 2@s is red about 6-8|pg||

nt|blum1956: certainly but the suggested line also works. South either ruffs the air or allows to score the @sA (two trumps scoring anyway)|pg||
nt|ady: play the 5 here will be a good start|pg||
nt|ady: 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzqg: BBO line-up for the next round: OR Verhees-van Prooijen vs Westra-Bertens|pg||
nt|vugraphzqg: CR Bas Drijver-Brink vs Muller-de Wijs|pg||
nt|ady: needs to get everything right   |pg||
nt|vugraphzqg: Drijver thinking, Verhees asked if it will take some more time|pg||
nt|ady: if the 6 is played north does well to play low|pg||
nt|blum1956: the play of @h6 brings the 9th trick if he then guesses to play spades from the top|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: very unlikely the 10 would be right from North if the 6 is played|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|blum1956: If N plays low it is still possible to win with the @hA and then catch both maior 10s|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzqg: Drijver asks what kind of discarding NS play now...|pg||
pc|cK|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzqh: it shows 9-11|pg||
nt|shevek: must show some Majors too|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: east could have asked a lot but with no slam in sight decided to bid a practical 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|curtsolo: a philosophy that I find very much worthwhile is the "stretch to invite, not to accept" approach|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: denied a 5-card major|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes not telling the opps very much is "practical"|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: quite a bit of work is needed for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|davidstern: Low heart will help|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: is Muller thinking about the @h9? that gives 3 heart tricks when it is right and still 2 when it is wrong|pg||
nt|shevek: results updated: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/|pg||
nt|shevek: Louk Verhees Jr. & Ricco van Prooijen way in front now|pg||
nt|davidstern: way in front is somewhat of an understatement my dear Nicoleta|pg||
nt|davidstern: Almost double all the other positive scores in total|pg||
nt|davidstern: Muller obviously adopting the "if I dont play a card I wont make a mistake" policy|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|curtsolo: Eakes has to protect her partner here, as he could have a very good hand that is not quite a jump-shift to 3@c|pg||
nt|ady: trump lead best     makes around 8 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: still likely to go down|pg||
nt|xenya: i think he can crossruff now for 10|pg||
pc|h4|nt|daveharty: extremely passive lead by east|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|curtsolo: so responder should stretch a bit if sniffing a game|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|shevek: 547 imps behind coming 2nd Gert-Jan Paulissen & Jan Jansma|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|curtsolo: auction and E cards did not call for a passive lead here|pg||
nt|xenya: pitch club on a diamond etc|pg||
nt|xenya: just losing 3 trump tricks eventually|pg||
nt|davidstern: Forced not to rely on spade finesse later|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|daveharty: not to mention the state of the match!|pg||
nt|xenya: this also works as spades are blocked|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|daveharty: although to be fair, an opening lead decision is not going to be nearly enough at this point|pg||
nt|ady: tes   can stop 2 heart ruffs     2 diamond tricks and 1 club trick  plus 2 trumps from hand 10 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: moment of truth|pg||
nt|xenya:  4-3 @D gives better odds than finesse? |pg||
nt|xenya: other things being equal of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: he knows W is 2-2 in the majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: which makes @d splitting less likely and the club finesse more likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: interesting decision|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D bid and  made in OR  on hand 12    no heart lead|pg||
nt|xenya: on the other hand, W is marked with long clubs...|pg||
nt|xenya: so not an obvious decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: If east has 2-2-1-3 distribution left with the club king|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: declarer would still make by going up|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|davidstern: This will likely fail now 1-1-0-3 losers|pg||

nt|curtsolo: no, and this final quarter has been chock full of partscores... hard for EW to feel very inspired by what they've been dealt|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: on another club play, dummy will be squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: he can't part with a diamond as there would be no route back to hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: he also can't part with a major suit card as that would give Jansma an extra undertrick to cash|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||

mb|p|nt|curtsolo: this looks beatable|pg||
nt|phil: 2N should be a range similar to an invite after a strong NT|pg||
nt|daveharty: 3NT looks unbreakable due to the extremely fortunate spade position|pg||
nt|snowface: no long major, not even 5(134) for example|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|curtsolo: well, Stack loses timing to knock out @dA, so he needs KJ of @s onside|pg||
