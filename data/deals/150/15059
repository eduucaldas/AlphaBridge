mb|3N|nt|desert: Kondoch will insist on playing diamonds with his 8 card suit.....|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes Roland, 6@D is a very good contract. Also because N has to find a lead :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|bernix: the question is how can east be persuaded to play a slam contract in diamonds ?|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|robinswr: this shows very good diamonds|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: hmmm|pg||

nt|bernix: another good result for the leading pair (after 1st session)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: What made Zimmermann think that Kondoch has hearts?|pg||
nt|jcmax: The question is whether 4@C is/should still be natural or whether it should be a cuebid based on very good @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D clearly says that he is not interested in hearts in my view|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcmax: After all if E had  a natural @C-bid he might have bid @C over 2@D|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Although the prize pool is very good|pg||
nt|jcmax: 160 euro is still less than the entry fee for the cavendish :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I dare say|pg||
nt|desert: and some substitute pairs who were asked were not availeble|pg||
nt|jcmax: In the US for the National events you pay 20$ a session per player. There are 2 sessions a day. How much does that add up to?|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jcmax: Some people might "accidentally" stumble into slam on this deal, because they are trying to show all their suits and there may be no stopping.|pg||

nt|robinswr: transfer to spades|pg||
nt|jcmax: 4NT for us would alsways be some kind of 2-suited t/o, often for the minors. Over a major first 4NT and then bidding 5 of partner's major is a slam try, butwe cannot ask for aces.|pg||
