mb|3C|nt|jaheim: runde 2 av det åpne norske mesterskapet i monrad lag|pg||
nt|sharkey: About as far North and South in Norway as possible|pg||
nt|sharkey: good morning Mike|pg||
nt|haans: with amurder|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H did the trick|pg||
nt|chick: pretty brave 3N with only Qxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and to u too Carl|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a tame defence may let this thru|pg||
nt|chick: ouch, and N rescues them|pg||
nt|haans: but ...|pg||
nt|jaheim: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@C of course, partner should have both minors|pg||
nt|pelu: but pass is not an option by N - 2@S?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: East elected to bid NV - not unexpected|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame south for making the obvious lead|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 1@D no 5 c M|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Certainly better than this|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S first time - but now N sh have 10+ |pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: i must admit that as south i would chance a double here i like to earn imps|pg||
nt|jaheim: NS  won the mixed pair chship this year|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and adopting the trend towards 5 rather than 6 card suit|pg||
nt|jaheim: lots of toppairs playing 2 @D as a weak muli   and 2 @H @S as a serious weak 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: presumably S cannot open 2H, but a more likely alternative would seem to be 1H. cant argue with success though:)|pg||
nt|chick: Pass by S is also an alternative :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very odd to bid 4H when 3N is virtually sure to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: I see 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|lestergold: nom heart ruff but an immediate diamond swirtch and force will be uncomfortabelm fro declarer|pg||
nt|haans: slam possible :)|pg||
nt|april7: very aggressive bid by E|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 @D   prob   1 major|pg||
nt|april7: @S lead would be good,then down|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@H Doubled would have been interesting|pg||

nt|npcjpn: This EW pair has been played together for a long time.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: i prefer 1@H to 3|pg||
nt|chick: with 2 aces and 3 hearts, N must know that 3N is doomed.   must be he thought 4@H was makeable|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case why wouldnt he bid it on the porevious round?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed. The system I tend to use is that the Double of 2@D indicates that I was going to transfer to @Hs|pg||
nt|jaheim: EW  currently 2.   NS 4. place|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S thinking, 2 shows an honour, so it has to be either A or Ten, |pg||

pc|sA|nt|npcjpn: The other pair in open room is relatively new partnership.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: certainly true that Pass is an option for S. my comment about 1H was based on the manifest intention of S to do something other than the textbook pass, so i whould have prefaced my ...|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: certainly there are hands where 3N could make and 4HX be a good save -- mostly they start with a longish minor lacking only the ace plus two heart stoppers and enough spade tricks ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to get to nine. but it is extremely pessimistic to save since there are zillions of hands where 3N fails, maybe by several tricks. so if you don;t try for that kind of good result ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when your preempt creates the opportunity, you ought to stop  preempoting|pg||

mb|1S|nt|sharkey: vi ligger litt foran :)|pg||

nt|april7: might end up in 4@S by NS or 5@H by EW|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but only 3 teams in womens, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or will we?|pg||
nt|haans: assume X is penalty|pg||
nt|haans: weak openings make it harder for opps to bid their cards|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jaheim: will end up in 4 @H|pg||

nt|april7: best is to cash 2 top @D and then playing @C ace and @C|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 3@H should make on the nose|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|haans: if they make 1NTx they do not get game |pg||

nt|mdgraham: we can see that spade intervention might make this tricky, but the chance for that has gone|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: technically 4@s is a vbiablem save but who is gonna bid it it could be heading for 800 not agood imnvestment unless you cansee al the cards|pg||

nt|baardolav: should make even if all the "quesses" goes wrong|pg||

nt|marlowepi: as a very active player, S must be disappointed to be in 4th shair with that hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: At least Helness eventually got a @C trick :)|pg||

mb|d|nt|sharkey: Spørs om NS kan få med seg @H stikkene her|pg||
nt|haans: no support x|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2D is the obvious call but it has the disadvantage of letting W bid hearts cheaply|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good hand for transfers faci ng overcalkls|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W passed?|pg||
nt|april7: W should have opened the bidding|pg||
nt|jaheim: My money is on "Filosofene"   any sidebets   ?  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: @C systems handle east's hand easily.  But if you're willing to open the correct 1@D, standard shouldn't have a huge problem, either.|pg||

nt|jaheim: 4 @D from Aabye ?|pg||
nt|april7: now 1NT pass pass pass |pg||
nt|davidstern: Not a fan of the pass by W - I would prefer to bid 2@C to let partner know I have values else I will be under pressure later|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Ø dukker en @S og NS må ta beiten på direkten|pg||
nt|chick: it looked same to me, but we trust our operator :)|pg||

nt|sharkey: Whar would you bid Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: west's pass verylazy in my view and suicidal in a teams game|pg||
nt|lestergold: im 61 this month and feel about 18 mentally- er physically notm quite that|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@d is a weak multi|pg||
nt|davidstern: Methinks too|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jaheim: K of cl and a claim?|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club at its best|pg||
nt|baardolav: this will make +2 or something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2@d is a Multi, South can respond 2@h (pass/correct) or 2@S (pass/3@h). His hearts are good, could easily have bid 2@s   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: South with long hearts assumes his partner has spades :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@s is natural not forcing in weak multi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can play it that way.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: wow! pass with void?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At least they can take it 1 down|pg||
nt|iceblue: N misunderstood the DBL|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like NS is not so experient|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: headed for game not making perhaps|pg||
nt|chick: this can make 4@H but not 5@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lesser evil and pass by E.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Pas probably limits the damage as any EW contract would be pretty expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @S slam can make, but unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: an aggressive lead which on this layout costs a trick|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|haans: i have stopped bidding 4@H 30 years ago|pg||
nt|haans: support x better than delayed support|pg||
nt|npcjpn: may be great score in matchpoint.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: i would bid something - choice between 4n and 5H not easy but i would fera missing slam to much not to make a try|pg||
nt|sharkey: @CJ Jan Arne - and claim :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally prefer to use a 2@C rebid after 1@D opening to show a good hand. Gives you room to explore below 3N, at a cost on some natural auctions on lesser hands.|pg||
nt|chick: wow, I would never sell out with S's hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud be off 1|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jaheim: mm  |pg||

nt|haans: was strong in KS|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C|pg||
nt|othered1: That's my preferred natural system :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: @H lead much better than low spade|pg||
nt|npcjpn: dbl by West show @H and some @s?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But can they make 5@C?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jaheim: mm   5 @D  -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@d can lose spade heart and @d 3n very vulnerable too|pg||
nt|sharkey: Agree - think he shud fight with 3@H|pg||
nt|april7: depends on the play,W might lose 1 @S,1@H 2@D and 1 @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D I mean|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|jaheim: ja   og ender opp med 2 bet |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|npcjpn: on a club guess, I think.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: perfectly reasonable as games make on dim finesse|pg||
nt|jaheim: needs a sp lead to win, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n can make dpending on defence 5@d no play at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: except on spade lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Would you x NT after first x by W and pass by E?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W showed the other two suits by x.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think I would find the Pass, but I also think being aggressive is a winner in the long term|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: very little info from auction west has opted for non commital 'safe' trump lead|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: spade switch obvious but doesnt matter spade loser cannot go|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mcarroll: AKx trumps lead would have made this a struggle for declarer|pg||
pc|s9|nt|davidstern: Four rounfs of hearts would have been best|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|othered1: At least it simplified the auction.  In standard, south's planned rebid after opening 1@D isn't easy.|pg||
nt|april7: @H switch might cause  aproblem|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jaheim: minst|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: may keep NS out of the cold @D slam|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 4@S with 10 or 11 tricks depending on the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 11 on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sharkey: Depends on what x of 2@D would mean|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1 nt 4 minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 1NT is 8-15 p and at least 4-4 in @c and @d|pg||
nt|april7: do they play strong pass?|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: EW will find 4@S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: well this slam wont be missed thats for sure|pg||
nt|othered1: South's double is interesting with that shape and not that many high cards|pg||
nt|haans: odd take out x|pg||
nt|henryb:  Going back to board one, where Lunna mysteriously took 12 tricks in 6N, shouldn't it be possible for big club players to reach 6@c?|pg||
nt|othered1: North has to act h ere and EW may find themselves defending a high @D contract|pg||
nt|haans: big clubs does anything :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: in board 1, Lunna got a diamond in the lead, and South was endplayed in spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose it depends on what you open 2@d on - if you can do it with 5@h, then yes, 2@S natural makes sense |pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade partial ERW and Hearts or clubs NS|pg||
nt|pelu: I would never open in East - would u?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Kvarngraven 1st to think were are all the cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: ja   hadde gått 2 bet jeg|pg||
nt|jaheim: minst  :)|pg||
nt|jaheim: another slam coming up|pg||
nt|sharkey: 18-19|pg||
nt|lestergold: whether they bid the grand tho is open to question|pg||
nt|othered1: I might rebid @H on south's hand and I think it wins over the long term.|pg||
nt|haans: with u|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some would use stayman as N|pg||
nt|april7: should S open and N passes then E will come in in @H and then  perhaps 1,2,3 NT???|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Obviously the dealing machine is saving the games and slams for later in the tournament ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade lead and heart off dummy would work well for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|pelu: give up: 4@s|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: hm that will tend to ruole out a heart contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib asked why not open weak 2@H with S hand on Bd 17.  Reason is weak 2 openings 3rd hand NV can be very weak at Expert level, and this was closer to an opening hand.  Also a ...|pg||
nt|sharkey: matter of agreement|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah this may get them to the bad game|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sharkey: tror de fleste av oss hadde det|pg||
nt|jaheim: Viego in trbl,  but 1400 in the "bank"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you open with a sub-minimum in 3rd seat, fair enough, at least have a decent suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: NS are playing in my local club|pg||
nt|lestergold: anymore and someone will be in tgrouble|pg||
nt|haans: ty Liv needed that info|pg||
nt|henryb:  Did South really have to act over 1@s Hans?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharkey: 7@C makes|pg||
nt|chick: I think that hand is much too strong for a preempt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dbl looks like DONT  - six card suit somewhere. Bit thin if it is|pg||
nt|npcjpn: there are many players who does not like pass in 3rd seat even vulnerable (in Japan).|pg||
mb|4S|nt|april7: I don't think W should pass 1@D, has 5 P!!! and then 4@H would have been reached making 5 if starts with @S finesse but 10 tricks for sure|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7N is technically better as well because if clubs broke badly you would have the spade position to fall back on|pg||
nt|sharkey: 7@S depending on the @S finesse|pg||
nt|april7: but after ruff S is endplayed|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: would have gone on if after 2nt invite|pg||
nt|haans: bridge not like all time|pg||
nt|haans: old|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The last thing Declarer will do is lead trumps, has to try for a semi-crossruff in the red suits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: important to know what these doubles are. After the redouble, penalty is a live possibility|pg||

nt|othered1: right, south has a quite sound opening|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|sharkey: The @S suit has not been mentioned so a mute point|pg||

nt|mdgraham: maybe West didn't believe East could have a penalty double of 2@H when he held @HKJ|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Declarer got a diamond lead in the other room|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sharkey: Wonder what wud happen if Jensen opened Multi 2@D here (ref previous board)|pg||

nt|lestergold: i gain a lot more than i lose by doubling|pg||
nt|lestergold: last hand was a stand on the chair double|pg||
nt|henryb:  Not the best result for E-W, as 4@s is easy|pg||
nt|haans: agree :)|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H might make, but I sure wouldn't be happy in it|pg||
nt|chick: of course I'm famous for detesting moysians :)|pg||

nt|haans: no good bid for E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1D seems fine to me|pg||
nt|chick: again, too good for a preempt|pg||
nt|haans: "Not for person below 100"|pg||
nt|mcarroll: now making all his small trumps with the crossruff - contract making|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H p  p  X  p 4@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sound reasonable to me|pg||
nt|april7: on @H lead then 5,on @D ace lead only 4,but bidding might develop differently|pg||
nt|chick: would you jump to game with N's hand over 3@H P P X?  partner is under pressure and doesn't have to have 20 pts for a X|pg||
nt|april7: you are right, but even over 3@S S will bid 4, but thats a different story|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It was somewhat dangerous cash that last trump and then @DA and king|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|april7: N might reopen with a X, then S might reach qa @H contract at 3 level, but EW might compete to 3 @S|pg||

mb|1H|nt|haans: do like 2@S|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Maybe they never break 4-1 in Taipei|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: form theirmn gross overbidding|pg||

nt|jaheim: men på 2 trinnet,   3 ru er 5 kort imo|pg||
nt|jaheim: D  =  3 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Surely 4@H is the bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Spørs hvilke krav meldinger de har til rådighet - hvis 2 NT krav viser farge|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N migh be best on this on NS cards alone, but @H more likely to be found.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: not 2|pg||
nt|chick: moot now as W elected to treat his hand as an opening bid|pg||
nt|npcjpn: it will be tough not leading a spade.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: Good bid by Kvangraven|pg||
nt|lestergold: no lead to beat|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N|pg||
nt|sharkey: S unsure about @C suit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south may be tempted to play this in hearts|pg||
nt|jaheim: or lucky, finding p with 10 of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: if so three rounds of spades with the 9@h ruffing in would not be nice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S seems makeable on trump coup|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: may be even 6...|pg||

nt|marlowepi: hi henry:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
nt|haans: Henry :)|pg||
nt|haans: no alert of 2nt?|pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s would seem to have the advantage that it leaves more room, and your hand is better than a weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was bid as good-bad, but W is not sure. TD at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was not alerted|pg||

nt|mrdct: this is a good auction to have a chat to your regular partner about re what we play after they double a natural 1NT overcall|pg||

nt|sater1957:  just guessing, but West passing 2@s is pretty wierd, if she really knew what was going on|pg||

nt|henryb:  what I thought|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they reach slam there is no real alternative to the @D finesse|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H by EW losing 2@C and 1 @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What would you bid now, guys?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jaheim: snei   = nei   :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS har god stamp i 5@H |pg||
nt|sharkey: or @D ruff before communications in @C cut off|pg||
nt|jaheim: right|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D by East had worked better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@H, 2@D, double?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What do you prefer?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: hmmay not necessartily be bid here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure - odds on to play for @C finesse on @H lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: too right|pg||
nt|haans: 3@D less likely suits are 4333|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S GF|pg||
mb|3H|nt|npcjpn: 4@s looks best.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: how about 2NT? any strong two suiter.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not easy|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: three card raise rarer and rarer|pg||
nt|chick: three card raise should be extinct|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: though this hand is not so strong.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: yes -on review think 5@C better|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not like east's double tend to get into troubole when u faikl to bid ur main asset namely clubs here|pg||
nt|april7: is N considering a X???|pg||
nt|mcarroll: That is a very sporting 2@S|pg||
nt|april7: thats why it will cost a lot|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@H by S - surely not|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Good score in the OR.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: identical auction so far|pg||
nt|jaheim: prob   2 @C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: OK not natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  West has, imo, a marginal game force.|pg||
nt|haans: OR in 5@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Mike, all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and with 3 tricks N expects something from pd - He will be disappointed!!|pg||
nt|jaheim: Viego in trbl  now|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2NT by South 3@S by North now |pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of bidding here - 60 HCP in this board? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No matter what, 2@H worked like a dream|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now will bid|pg||
nt|haans: yes if no agreement|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and they seem set to bid it the same way here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 9 of 14|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But  6@C seems like a leap in the dark|pg||
nt|april7: N really has not enough to X!!!!|pg||
nt|npcjpn: true.|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S down 1?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: and as u say it may well go off |pg||
nt|sharkey: @DA lead OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: Made it easy for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: is east that stromngb that a doubolem is needed before showing the clubs/|pg||
nt|haans: many play 2nt as invite or more|pg||
nt|haans: many scandinavians at least|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@D - 3 NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: OK Natural :)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: or 3@c by North and 3@s by South.|pg||
nt|davidstern: 6@C would be a good spot|pg||
nt|npcjpn: if you open light, you have to be lucky.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jaheim: 2 hj med 4 kortstøtte,  ja ja, ikke min melding|pg||
nt|sharkey: if East were ready to bid 4@C on 3@D he shud be able to do the same over 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Martin. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@d South African transfer to 4@S....|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcarroll: Hardly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South really playing with fire here. You suspect 3@s would have been passed out|pg||
nt|jaheim: D   is @H lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: It seems the NS style may be to support immediately with 3 spades but I suspect that the bidding is consistent with 3 spades and six clubs perhaps|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 24 points doesnt have to bid game|pg||
nt|jaheim: mm   1 nt opening in W|pg||
nt|chick: at least S didn't draw the fatal (to defenders) club lead by bidding them|pg||
nt|chick: now can N find a heart?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Well Leaped|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 11 easy tricks with hearts 3-2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb:  but woud you bid less than game opposite partner's opening 1@s?|pg||
nt|chick: booo|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good lead.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: For defence.|pg||
nt|chick: pretty skinny GF by S|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4@d splinter discourages.|pg||
nt|davidstern: North may be aiming for 6@C|pg||
nt|davidstern: which would be playable opposite nothing more than the @SK and @CAQ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: Vet ikke hvor N fant doblingen i Åpent Rom?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C makes - not 6...|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 4@d is forcing, I approve, otherwise 5@d seems indicated|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S was said to be GF\|pg||
nt|chick: if 2@S is GF....|pg||
nt|jaheim: so   10 points  is enough 4 a gf?   strange|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ino may have been better supporting clubs to allow South to better judge the hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: Fant den her og...|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think South's hand is NTish - wud have tried 3@D to make pd bid 3 NT with @D stopper|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, its frustrating when you find later that you pushed them to a  possibly making game |pg||
nt|april7: @S @S @S the W should discard ace of @C on 3d @D|pg||
nt|davidstern: South should now bid six with the @SK and a singleton heart|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|haans: xy Stayman in Sweden we belive that was invented in Denmark long time ago|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think S should bid 5C over 3D, then he is in position to pass 5D|pg||
nt|henryb:  Suth could not affort Blackwood|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: after the 3@D rebid, most players play 3@S as competitive only - they either double or bid 3@H as a game try|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D GF|pg||
nt|april7: only hope for E to get in if K or Q of @C|pg||
nt|april7: thats an interesting defence|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: as spec pointsn o9ut he has forced himnself to bid 4@c over 3@d by his pard whcih would be overdoing the hand|pg||
nt|april7: W must  pray S having another @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: some would claim|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no claim yet?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dQ|nt|mcarroll: But on the bidding W may play S for a singleton @S and |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sharkey: East got the clue he neede|pg||
nt|haans: i agree 5@D not 4@D best bid|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rnmalik: AK@S and @HK pitching 3@Ds and @D finesse and one @C loser.|pg||
nt|april7: 5 of @S = @C entry|pg||
nt|chick: the @S5 should show @C entry|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sharkey: Ingen overstikk her|pg||
nt|jaheim: ja ja,  NS   tror vel neppe de vinner  5 imps etter å ha betalt ut 750|pg||

nt|haans: 1@S-1n-3@S-p|pg||

mb|1D|nt|lestergold: ie let him make his own mistakes or no0t as the case may be|pg||
nt|baardolav: need two entries for the heart... |pg||
nt|jaheim: but only 1 entery  to E hand|pg||
nt|baardolav: yeah... |pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|lestergold: not provide him with a route map to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Rite - and discrading !K at the end position and keeping 3 x @C may have resulted in a set|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last board of this segment, interesting hands as reflected by the respective scores, no unwanted swings.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's written black on white|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But maybe she could not see that she had 11 tricks; that's an excuse|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: The challenge here is to bid game|pg||
nt|davidstern: South got a heart lead and carelessly ruffed a diamond losing all communication with dummy|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sharkey: @DK|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaheim: if   playing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or 6NT? with 12 tops?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A bit surprising nobody found the red card after 4@S in OR|pg||
nt|npcjpn: vulnerbale, second seat and bad suit...|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: as all others try for game|pg||
nt|sharkey: S bid 2@H OR|pg||
nt|henryb:  I remind kibitzers that while I deeply appreciate comments I will not respond to anyone who does not have the courtesy to put their full names in their profile|pg||
nt|april7: switchto @H is best|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/DisplayResultsT4?club_event_id=15508&header=pabf&fdc=TKFMSZTDG  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|davidstern: I took an oath never to bid 3N T with a void in partner's suit but that was in 1975|pg||
nt|davidstern: I should say I have stuck with it ever since|pg||
nt|pelu: borderline 2@D (Michael) in Red|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Amazing, EW sold out to 2@S on board 6 in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: as would I|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will get to game now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West doubled 1NT, then she doubled 2@D and then she passed 2@S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: 2NT Invitational Values min @S and 4 card support|pg||
nt|april7: but cross ruff is already open|pg||
nt|npcjpn: @dQ and @CK are great card for East.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jaheim: but needs to lead a @D, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of this session has been when you are dealt a double then double|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why didnt S bid 3 NT?|pg||
nt|haans: invite or not invite that is the question|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H prermpt in my book|pg||
nt|chick: after the X, 2@H shows 8+ in my book :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: last board in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2 matches to go|pg||
nt|mcarroll: After I predicted a flat board on 6 I hesitate to say anything here - But............|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1   i think   ,  Liv Marit|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: yes, you're right jaheim|pg||
nt|april7: I think losing at most 2 @S and 2 aces|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: one more match|pg||
pc|dK|nt|davidstern: And even then......|pg||
nt|npcjpn: @D to 9.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: East should have @CA instead of @CKJ to bid 3@D.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|haans: AKK is extra in it self|pg||
nt|henryb:  better case at matchpoints|pg||
nt|sharkey: We would all lead @HQ vs 3 NT and set it....|pg||
nt|chick: and I have a known double fit in the majors (assuming a normal takeout double)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 2@D to show both M and some points|pg||
nt|haans: yep good for 2@D instead of @H bid|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: im on Volls side|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Depends what 2NT showed|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: there has been a fair amountg of no trump avoidance too|pg||
nt|sharkey: May work out ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: im susrprised that 3n failed in open room|pg||
nt|haans: yes at IMP you seldom pass before game|pg||
nt|chick: that would also work if such agreed|pg||
nt|sharkey: This won't be easy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True Roland|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS wil be quite pleased to gain an imp after going four down vulnerable in a freely-bid game |pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: Solves trump problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ive checked play first took club the unatural way then after spade switch took a secons spade finesse rather than dim finesse when defenders had warned himn that spades were ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: both 'wrong'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, the cardinal sin, Mike. Declarer had his contract but went for overtricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Viego will suffer their first defeat |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|henryb:  if partner signs off the game may be less than 50%|pg||
nt|davidstern: South will switch to a spade at a million miles and hour if East plays another diamond |pg||
nt|pelu: yes KJ no value when pd 5-5 in major|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf  for results|pg||
nt|pelu: a major Q better than @cK|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: i see contract failed in open but surely playing on clubs declarer should make this|pg||
nt|haans: you need a good 50% to bid non vul games|pg||
nt|haans: better bidding than OR|pg||
nt|pelu: ??????????????|pg||
nt|npcjpn: East probably hoped miracle AQ in majors.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sophia is lucky that this does not cost the contract|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: play for split honours in clubs shoul lose a heart a club and a diamond at most|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: interesting method (4@H slam try). What would 4@C and 4@D have been, then?|pg||

mb|6H|mb|p|nt|npcjpn: i play 3@S over 3@h as slam try in @h.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: She will get !AKQ and 4@S shows an honour|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Should be Peter. Hearts are set after 4@C|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Don't you agree?|pg||
nt|pelu: not sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think it's pretty simple. You can sign-off in 4@H, you can't in 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Easy to remember|pg||
nt|npcjpn: so hard to forget|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR EW had a better action: 2@H - 3@H - 3@S - after 4NT - 5@S East bid 5NT - but West didnt accept|pg||
