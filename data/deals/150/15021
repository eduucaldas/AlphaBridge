nt|sharkey: Not everyone wud open East hand....|pg||
mb|d|mb|1S|nt|arunbapat: it is going to be a uphill task for Hooda ,,but I have seen them fighting out 34 imps lead of DSM yesterday|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: This is the final of the Finnish Cup - first of two segments - 16 boards each|pg||

nt|othered1: rehi, Mike and everybody|pg||
nt|mdgraham: close match - score after one set was 42-0 to the Formidables, but team Hooda has come back well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: hi all and wlc to the 1st quarter of the semis in the Poddar Nationals in Mumbai|pg||
nt|arunbapat: Demicoma is Prakash's baby |pg||
nt|panja: I was not aware they played demicoma|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: play slow as usual on this table|pg||
nt|arunbapat: I think they play Demicoma with some variations |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all. Strong come-back from the Hooda team, 42-0 down after the first set|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: will claim ....server problem ....sorry all|pg||

nt|panja: 1@D opening promising some 4-card Major, 1@H natural..|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: other s/f Texan Aces up by 30 imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: The West hand is an advertisement for having a bid to show a one-suiter over 1NT, as you can always rely on pd to be short in the suit you want him to lead in thi s auction|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Vijay|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Welcome All|pg||

nt|panja: 2Nt is a good spot..|pg||
nt|arunbapat: will Satya come out to 3D I guess he will.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Kista is not everyone and you can expect a few surprises from him all the time|pg||
nt|sharkey: :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharkey: N has undertsated his hand - works ok this time as S rather weak for t/o Dbl view pd's pass|pg||
mc|7|nt|panja: with this score, EW should be taking chances, and NS, playing safe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Mumbai|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: but here he is partnering the vetran Ashok|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S for NS in B14, 5@D sac for EW...could go down many though|pg||
nt|garnetts: employed a variation of the Kokish style relay |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that was fast|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: sorry play had started so claimed ...now back live|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Mahesh|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 4@S will be a good spot here|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: n/s playing 2/1 ...e/w demicoma|pg||
nt|panja: after the 1@H opening, it will be a struggle to find @S spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: waiting for the tray...now with n/e|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: still waiting|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|mdgraham: Cambridge Precision did that in the late 70's :) |pg||
nt|garnetts: Dates you Mike :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes :(|pg||
nt|garnetts: not alone :(|pg||
nt|garnetts: seems to be taking for ever --must be a technical problem I suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|coolvijay: JM has been playing with Ashok quite regularly prior to his joining Texanaces|pg||
nt|panja: 1@D promises a 4-card Major here|pg||
nt|panja: so E has bid 1@D because of his 4@H, not to show his long @D|pg||
nt|panja: ideally, he should have opened 2@D here to show Diamonds..|pg||
nt|arunbapat: may be they are not playing Demicoma or this may be the variation Panja|pg||
nt|panja: E had cannot see any advantage in playing in @H in preference to @D|pg||
nt|panja: well, with this hand, the opening is a matter of choice....|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: waiting for satya to bid|pg||
nt|panja: no alert on 1@D Mahesh?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Welcome Carl and Sunil|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: 1Nt 12-15...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: @H lead will set 3 NT - anything else it may make|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: not alertd by kaustabh|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: alerted|pg||
nt|panja: it does not show up here...|pg||
nt|panja: ok...then it must be natural...not demicoma|pg||
nt|panja: 1Nt F, 8+, but here E seems to have taken a liberty|pg||
nt|panja: he should not have a void for 1Nt bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Welcome Panja|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hawe45:  Set?|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - always a make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning Hans|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shud work ok as favorable lead; @D set up|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hawe45:  Morning - I just had a wake-up call - by Sharkey...|pg||
nt|sharkey: :)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: doubt if 4@s can stand repeated forces w/ @d / unless play for complete crossruff|pg||
nt|panja: good pass..this might solve a problem|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Panja|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|peachy: 3D will be quite enough|pg||
nt|panja: will make if @S is not led..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: here is an entry to dummy|pg||
nt|panja: S has 4-card @H here, but with a surfeit of Kings, 1Nt is preferred opening, not 1@D|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: "mislook"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: sorry ...will claim ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: missed the play....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S looks a bit of a punt, but the East hand fits well|pg||
nt|othered1: was 2@S constructive here?|pg||
nt|panja: I guess only @Sk lead will beat it|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraph814: Bonsoir nous voici au BCSH meilleur club de paris pour un duplicate en étoile tous les joueurs sont donc associés a nos 4 champions|pg||
nt|garnetts: I know that in France they employ a short club and rebid majors--but I agree with Mike it is dreadful--must show 5-4 in my view when you bid two suits|pg||
nt|garnetts: Bteer to rebid 1NT and employ checkback|pg||
nt|garnetts: better I mean |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there was some debate about this recently - two vociferous (and diametric) points of view|pg||
nt|panja: 2@S was const...|pg||
nt|othered1: That explains the simplified (and effective) auction.|pg||
nt|panja: I thought there would be a temptation to play in Nt, but Prabha has chosen not to opt for Nt|pg||
pc|cT|nt|coolvijay: oh thats a bold bid by Ashok|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sharkey: 12-15 range - cud he have opened something else?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why @C from dummy .....?|pg||
nt|panja: I wonder why he touched Clubs, rather than playing Diamonds|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well 15 and 2 tens is top of the pops|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - 4333 doesnt had too much value though|pg||
nt|panja: @SQ now...and South might be in trouble|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that is tough|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Venky shuffling between @s q n 10|pg||
nt|panja: could even go down 3 if he misguesses Diamonds|pg||
nt|vicky888:  maybe starting with clubs by S would stop the club shift by E|pg||
nt|sharkey: my aunt wud have claimed 7 tricks by now....|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|panja: both EW here are sharp players, Venky loves to tinker with demicoma...so you will see some imaginative bidding |pg||
nt|sharkey: often the KISS principle is superior though....|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peachy: this can make so bldness pays off|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i agree since a void in parners suit is not an asset and West cus have only 3@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: trump shift now|pg||
nt|peachy: Surprised that initial trump lead was not made, with those spades|pg||
nt|peachy: kibitzers scream that it was screaming for a trump lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Kayzad Thinking|pg||
nt|panja: but then, you could give @H open and still make|pg||
nt|panja: this shd be a make too...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|panja: this is a tricky game...|pg||
nt|panja: to avoid trump promotion...W must ensure S does not get in|pg||
nt|panja: so...it is essential to play !Q or J first time, not A|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|sharkey: for those not familiar with KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sunsamvar: south shd figure out that venky is short in @S and can take an avoidance play in @D |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|coolvijay: oh thats something different|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzpx: NS plays strong club, 1@c = 15+ from 1st/2nd and 19+ from 3rd/4th|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|panja: this is not a good approach...where are his 10 tricks going to come from?|pg||
nt|panja: best for W to exit with a @H now|pg||
nt|panja: leave the @D guess to Kaustubh|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c4|pc|h2|nt|vugraphzqe: decl thinking|pg||
nt|panja: not @SK? difficult to believe that|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|peachy: Doubledummy, we see of course it is makeable now, but declarer has some figuring out to do|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|othered1: Some might open a strong NT with west hand.  After the start, do they have a way to 3N?  Is 2N natural over the raise?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|coolvijay: now seems that JM has the tempo to cross ruff the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: croos ruffed and claimed 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: cross|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now Kista can kiss Venky for the great @Sq shift :)|pg||
nt|panja: this was an interesting situation, @HT would have squeezed E out of winning strategy...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: :)|pg||
nt|panja: and then losing @D guess would not have mattered|pg||
nt|vicky888:  also i wonder why would he finesse the risky way, if he loses the finese to W at least he is safe with clubs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panja: badly begun is half lost....|pg||
pc|d9|nt|panja: I don't know the details of EW methods|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|panja: this was the danger...this is why @CA first time was not a good idea|pg||
nt|panja: if he ruffs with @HT or J, two tricks to S with his !Q874|pg||
nt|panja: @HQ874|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c6|pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||

nt|vugraphzqe: back live ...ty all|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: played @s 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Venky saying sorry to p|pg||
nt|sharkey: I am not sure "wd" is deserved though...|pg||
nt|sharkey: by S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i think Venky had a count of the south hand.. probably thought declarer had @CQ and no @DK|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|peachy: EW will likely get to bid undisturbed this hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lets hope things are Ok now--very awkward for our operator when this happens |pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|sharkey: ty Pinja|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 1@C is 16+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice 4@S bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: E/W is playing precision|pg||
nt|panja: 3@C shows @D suit|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|vugraph814: le principe : tout le monde se compare aux champions de notre salle|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D asks for short suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in a 1 nt contract defence and dummy play has various alternatives... to go wrong too|pg||
nt|vicky888:  interesting thing here is venky is playing on the table and also kibbing though his BBO id "vinutha" :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: @H is that short suit|pg||
nt|othered1: well, it works here|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C was safe in any event - either S had @CQ or @DK.  If pd had @CQ @C return needed|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 3Nt not the best bid..|pg||
nt|panja: 3@S natural would have been fine...but now Thakral is likely to bid 4@D..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and with the hearts as friendly as could be, has the merit of being cold|pg||
nt|panja: 1@D promises some 4 card Major...dbl of 2@D neagative|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: doesnt look like this set will be boring...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzqe: play slow on this table|pg||
nt|panja: after winning this, N should shift to @H ....not immediately give ruffs..|pg||
pc|sA|nt|panja: this will survive because W's Clubs are good|pg||
nt|panja: but it is definitely not the best spot..|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the other semi is between Formidables and Hooda|pg||
nt|arunbapat: system Fix|pg||
nt|panja: no, nothing to do with system..|pg||
nt|panja: there were three mistakes here...1. W should not bid 3@D with only 1 Diamond|pg||
nt|panja: secondly, W should bid 3@S to get the 5-3 @S fit...either on 3@C or on 3@H|pg||
nt|arunbapat: holding AKJ in short suit of P 3NT is appealing..so he can not try 3S even if he want to else auction will cross 3nt if P has no S fit|pg||
nt|nkgupt: cud be a free 500 here|pg||
nt|nkgupt: infact 800 not ruled out on dd def|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sharkey: Duck a !"C into S here|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A @D-lead would have made this board INTERESTING|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW can make 6@C on this layout, but it's a bit lucky|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: indeed - like any ggod pd lead his suit...|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@C makes on any lead --but lucky needs 3-3 @D's |pg||
pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  Can only make by "C-finesse then|pg||
nt|arunbapat: he will survive this due to S position|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraph814: bonsoir je vous rappelle le principe : nous sommes au BCSH club de Paris pour un duplicate en étoile tous les E/O sont donc associés a Bompis Quantin et les N/S associés a ...|pg||
nt|vugraph814: BessisBessis|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: at this level shud be routine|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have to say I feel uncomfortable  about 3@C ---never shown a @D suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: think @H shift costs a trick Panja|pg||
nt|panja: no...will give a guess|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - assuming East guesses correctly|pg||
nt|panja: the trouble is...on every ruff, E can discard something..|pg||
nt|panja: if it were @HQx with E, @H shift is amndatory|pg||
nt|panja: mandatory even|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nkgupt: now 800 zone|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not after 4 @D-tricks to N/S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No routine at all|pg||
nt|sharkey: Sry Hans - Im looking at the actual hand  with @D lead need a peek to take the finesse|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: any opinion as to whether the West hand is worth a 2@D rebid?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not having a club lead only makes a little difference to 6@C as when @D are 4-2 they make you ruff the first one with the Q@C |pg||
pc|hK|nt|panja: there you go..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this is going down a packet now|pg||
nt|sharkey: you're ahead of me Panja :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sunsamvar: did Keyzad give count in @H?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: I think 2@D is just about OK because we have a really good club suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, and 6511 shape with aces in the long suits|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|panja: well...N my teammate for years...so know a little more about him|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i feel there was no hurry for the @H shift.. what if south had @Ckj ?|pg||
nt|panja: and now a @S...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nkgupt: dont really understand that 3rd seat...w/o even an urgency to be wanting a @h lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D intermediaries coming into play as well for a large set here - vs part score?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|panja: and there is one more issue..@D guess...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraph814: Pour plus d'informations : http://www.bcsh.fr/accueil/index.html|pg||
nt|sharkey: S run into some discard problems|pg||

mb|4H|nt|vugraphzqe: Welcome Arun|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Yes the entry situation is key, and if the lead takes one out then I think the only way to hold it to one loser is the first round deep finesse|pg||
nt|sharkey: Appears some misinfo here - Director may be called...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Director was called|pg||
nt|sharkey: From East's 3@C bid apparent he can't have @C & @S|pg||
nt|peachy: good play, to deny multiple entries to board|pg||
nt|garnetts: Give South the 10@H and 3NT becomes a real struggle|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H is a kind of default rebid - you can't really bid anything else|pg||
nt|panja: @C lead should defeat this, but not easy to overrule @H|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: Need to get trumps in play here|pg||

pc|sT|nt|vugraph814: for the english personnes this is not a official competition|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This looks like 300 against at least 650|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like off 2 - unless N can get a @H ruff |pg||
nt|sharkey: 500 or 800|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and continuing the good work|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well,  that means you don't have to remember the situations when it isn't|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is hard to play--lots of possible lines like winning and playing three rounds of D@s --|pg||

nt|mdgraham: ok|pg||
nt|panja: what else after the 3@S cue NK?|pg||
nt|sharkey: West 1 NT call in passout seat made this possible|pg||

nt|sharkey: if West overcalls 2@D believe very hard to get to 4@H|pg||
nt|panja: absolutely..|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: possible there that East assumed a six-card heart suit for the 2@H rebid - or at least a stronger heart suit. KJ looked good support |pg||
nt|panja: what do you think did he bid it for?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sunsamvar: 4 @S has chances here|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Unless W get ambitious and start looking for minor suit fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW getting to 4@S here|pg||
nt|panja: the perils of a wide range system|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Thin 3@H shows 5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe West might have bid 2NT instead of 2@H, as he did have a diamond stop, even though it was anti-positional|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, after bididng the 4th suit, 3NT would have shown the East hand quite well. Very difficult, in other words |pg||
nt|garnetts: True Mike but 2@H is a utility bid in my view--if not then 2@S was the better rebid--that is very likely to be a doubleton|pg||
nt|panja: this 1@S got passed out|pg||
nt|panja: N does not even have a maximum for his bid...4@S is almost cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: brave move, counting E to be relatively short in clubs|pg||

nt|mdgraham: likely 4@H here NS|pg||
nt|panja: S will open 1@D again, to promise 4 of some Major|pg||
nt|panja: N will respond 1@H...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: all back now|pg||
nt|panja: with 2 HCP, he could not have bid on...even a 1Nt bid requires about 5...|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT may make unless @S shift|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: ofcourse the 4@H on bd 32 was a great bid and shd score in double digits|pg||
nt|sharkey: previous hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Seems automatic if you ask me --you cannot aways have four of the other major |pg||
mb|1H|nt|sharkey: 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|panja: this hand will have trick defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 1@S shows 3 cards in @H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|panja: next bid likely to bd 4@H..|pg||
nt|panja: are NS playing weak 1Nt?|pg||
nt|panja: one top Spade, @S ruff and a Club..|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 1@d opening shows 9+?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wouldn't say anything at bridge is automatic, but I know what you mean|pg||
nt|panja: if not, this will end up in touch and go 3Nt|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Another auction that gives the opponents little information (but south has 4@S and 3@H)|pg||
nt|panja: should be clear once the dummy appears|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sunsamvar: why? Kista may have only 4@S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: if you double with that West hand at least pard knows you have some decent values|pg||

nt|panja: S has to figure this out|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: oops.. Venky is declrer|pg||
nt|panja: a good player unlikely to lead opp's suit with a doubleton|pg||

nt|nkgupt: if pd bids above 2@s score wise u will not be unsafe in the higher contract's...he will have his reason to cross 2@s|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Coffee-board 4 @H no swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: brb 2 mins|pg||
nt|garnetts: yet another EW game coming up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the OR seems to be stuck on board 28|pg||
nt|othered1: they did get to and score the better game|pg||
nt|garnetts: They had a rather better auction in my view |pg||
nt|garnetts: It was actually quite an interesting hand because in my view 2@S always shows a doubleton--3@S 5-4-3-1 with extra values--since a minimum 5-4-3-1 can always bid 2@S initially|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: back |pg||
nt|panja: 7@C or 7@S here..|pg||
nt|sharkey: Just bidding it remains...|pg||
nt|panja: @H ruff 13th trick in 7@S...and @D ruff 13th in 7@C|pg||
nt|panja: alas the hand is with EW...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mcarroll: 4@H looks good|pg||
nt|peachy: choice of strategy, splinter and set trumps or bid spades and subsequently force to game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: another 4441 hand|pg||
nt|panja: 1@D opening yet again for NS...if W allows N to open that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraph814: Pour plus d'informations : http://www.bcsh.fr/accueil/index.html|pg||
nt|vugraph814: BCSH : bridge club saint honoré : meilleur club de Paris pres de la porte dauphine|pg||
nt|panja: tricky hand, NS could easily go overboard...|pg||
nt|nkgupt: no bid 3@s....asured of being in a 9 card fit w/ 21 or pd having 5/5 w/ 8 cards and a second suit|pg||
nt|nkgupt: w/ min good 18+|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|panja: so 3@S with 18 BAL opposite 2...|pg||
nt|nkgupt: +9 card fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 1Nt, F, 8+ HCP|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mdgraham: EW will be going to at least 3@D|pg||
nt|panja: 2@D stiff or void Diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|nkgupt: is the original TNT to be there|pg||
nt|panja: and what do you do with 18, 5-card @S, or 16 5-card @D, always open 1Nt with 5 Spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: this splinter is unwelcome to Shah |pg||
nt|mdgraham: would pass by North here say "no preference, you choose?"|pg||
mb|3C|nt|peachy: AK opposite singleton weighs as much as an Ace alone, except for added protection|pg||
nt|othered1: Why did east keep his @D out of the auction?|pg||
nt|panja: 5-card @S rather|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I agree with your analysis of that hand, but it's not universally accepted.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: was 1@d natural? If so, odd that East didn't raise|pg||
nt|panja: with 5422...what could E do? 3@D could mean playing in 53 fit at 3 level|pg||
nt|vicky888:  hooda being a 4 member team is pretty exhausted by now; that makes the game tougher|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good bid by venky showing 5431|pg||
mb|4C|nt|tez: k of @s ..|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: ok, so 1@d can be short|pg||
nt|othered1: after west's double of 3@D?|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D r ather|pg||
nt|othered1: Didn't that show @D, either?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Prefer 2NT to 2@S initially|pg||
nt|garnetts: anyone for passing 3NT on the East hand?  |pg||
nt|panja: 1@D could be 3 Diamonds at shortest, could it not?|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess, and then the double of 2@D by west?|pg||
nt|panja: y vicky, they have come quite a distance ....it is a creditable performance...|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mdgraham: possible, but 4@S looks normal enough|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|tez: continue with ace..it shows doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: note Hooda team players' av age about 32..|pg||
nt|panja: Texan Aces, about 50|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6C|nt|garnetts: This a technical play problem--test D@s early |pg||
nt|othered1: I was thinking that after the double, east should be bidding 3@D over 2@S|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 16/17 i do ....18 i bid 3 card m...pd has to bid again to make the game a decent proposition|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: now..|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 4@S EW here|pg||

nt|nkgupt: panja pls rem...it is not the sys but the people using it who matter mainly for the results|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|sharkey: Not many IMPs being exchanged here - either dull hands, good bridge or combination ot the two....|pg||
nt|othered1: Others seem to do just fine, however.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in the final analysis it was a bold bid by KISTA|pg||
nt|panja: NS can make 4@H but there is a defence|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: looks like 5@D is three down, 5M making EW|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S on the East tickets ?   |pg||
nt|panja: @SA ruff, @C underlead, another ruff|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S will do much better...|pg||
nt|vicky888:  more probable to play in 4-4 fit|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: another coffee hand...|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s 11/14 here..but i thk better then 14:)|pg||
mb|3S|an|alerted|nt|garnetts: Why pass 1NT?  |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 4@S not so obvious to bid though|pg||
nt|sharkey: West's 2@S hand shows an opener - perhaps too much in the other suits I think|pg||
nt|othered1: Matter of style on overcall, but I would have tried to act, system willing.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agreed, looks odd|pg||
nt|panja: 1 more undo|pg||
mb|4C|nt|tez: 5 control..very good suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud have x and rebid @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: West was too good for 2@S imo|pg||
nt|tez: and sing @d|pg||
nt|panja: well.....it is the level too....below a certain level of competition...system is less important than players|pg||
nt|panja: 3@S by S, is it not?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: yes 3@s by east|pg||
nt|panja: ok thx|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: another Kista special|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: 3@s was alerted|pg||
nt|panja: must be for lead|pg||
nt|panja: it will muddy the waters too|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H from N, @SA lead will be difficult to find|pg||
mb|4H|nt|peachy: 2D might have been a fit-jump|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the opening psyche worked|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzqe: 1st board as decl for n/s|pg||
nt|panja: this is not all that easy to make...if E makes the mistake of going for @S finesse, he will go down|pg||
nt|othered1: I think it took @S lead, unlikely, to beat 1N|pg||
nt|panja: above a certain level.......system comes into picture|pg||
nt|panja: this is where understanding helps....|pg||
nt|panja: on the 3@S bid...what did South's P mean? what would other bids mean?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i guess south shd double the 3@S|pg||
nt|panja: very few are prepared for this|pg||
nt|panja: South is thinking now, the better time to think was after 3@S bid......|pg||
mb|5H|nt|peachy: both E and W have a little bit in reserve for what they have promised, I think I might make a second takeoutdouble with W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Even with a toy 2@S looks like it has a lot going for it|pg||
nt|panja: this is neither easy for defence, nor for E|pg||
nt|panja: 2!X should go down here..|pg||
nt|panja: 2@S even|pg||
nt|panja: Pass merely puts off the discomfirt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: this could head towards -500 for NS if N bids on|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|sunsamvar: no wonder South got impatient|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 500 - no big deal against 450|pg||
nt|garnetts: esay defence here cash two major winners in each suit and go to sleep |pg||
nt|othered1: if declarer goes after @H, thus can eschew @S finesse.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|peachy: the shape is pure and any suit is fine|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will the 3@S help him fin the @S J?|pg||
nt|panja: not a smart thing to do Venky...|pg||
nt|panja: @SJ position is not needed...a @D affords 1 discard|pg||
nt|panja: Kista is likely to shift to @SA and back...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: May mean more IMPs to Utter|pg||
nt|garnetts: even that lead makes no difference |pg||
nt|panja: 4 top tricks for EW, 2@C, @HA, a @S..and one more will accrue in the scrum|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|panja: @S next, will he finesse or not?|pg||
nt|othered1: was the @C2 the correct count card?  Should it matter?|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|tez: 10 imp|pg||
nt|panja: BTW on that 1@S hand, texans managed to get 7 IMPs ...played in 3@D, EW did|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: West of course hopes noth @S and @H placed "unfavorably" - no luck|pg||
nt|sharkey: *both|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|garnetts: unless they get the worng hand on lead in a bit--give a ruff and discard--but that won't happen|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h5|nt|panja: now on third @S, E will discard a @D|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||

nt|mdgraham: indeed....and some people say that overtricks don't count |pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: good observation Vikrant|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mdgraham: since board 27 the dealing machine has been stuck on the "EW game" setting|pg||

mb|4N|nt|othered1: North came to bid . . . |pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure why Norht bid over 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: to avoid this problem, S could have weak jumped to 3@D first time|pg||

nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|panja: NS have a good score in OR|pg||
nt|panja: TexanAces shd gain here..bad result for NS in OR|pg||
nt|nkgupt:  |pg||
nt|nkgupt: looks like a smoking break|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: brb smoke break|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2nd grand slam in 3 deals and the teaxans have aced it|pg||
nt|panja: was simple bidding in the end with 3 waiting bids to begin with|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this is a beautifully fitting hand..almost 12 tricks in @S with very few points|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: back|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: our vugraph commentator Roland is famous for bidding such slams :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: It has been a pleasure Sunil and Mahesh, past midnight. I have to call it a night.  Thanks kibitzers for your helpful comments!!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Tx Raija|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Bye |pg||
nt|panja: considering the difference between the two teams...this is a great performance for Hooda team..|pg||
nt|panja: Grand in @H..will test bidding|pg||
nt|panja: in fact,..N will simply bid it.....all he needs to know is the number of Aces, @H fit...S should not have 4 Diamonds...but not many will bother to check that|pg||
mb|1D|nt|othered1: 4@H is good, but easier if south opens |pg||
nt|othered1: I'd like any plus NS, as it's EW's hand in @S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: Keep us on our toes Pinja :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: what does the 1@H mean Mahesh|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzqe: 1@h alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: Formidables..3-time World QF...and dozens of international appearances..|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzqe: 1@h either @s or @c +@d |pg||
nt|panja: Hooda, the 4 playing here, 32 or so average age...|pg||
nt|panja: with the 4@D bid, no chance of checking anyway|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: I assume 1 NT shows 9-11?|pg||
nt|tez: NS playing artificial system|pg||
nt|othered1: now pretty much a matter of overtricks|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hooda also bid the grand on bd 36.. well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: this will be 5 IMps+ to formidables|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Yes - S doesnt have an opener and opens his 2nd weakest suit:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good bidding - but NOT exciting|pg||
nt|othered1: This isn't optimal for EW, but it will be a plus and should put formidables into the lead with 3 comparisons to go.|pg||
nt|panja: if South held 3343..4 cards in @D....with the same pictures....that slam would not make|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Worked - EW shut out|pg||
nt|tez: why not dbl to 2@d ?Arle|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 45 and 46 look plus positions|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: venky has all his points in @D and has no problem bidding game over the try|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzqe: will bid ...once partner denies @c K|pg||
nt|panja: or...a  2344 with @SAx....wasted values|pg||
nt|panja: the way the bidding began, no time or space to worry about South's distribution|pg||
nt|panja: bidding 2@C here was not the best idea|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panja: see what 3@C led to in the OR|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: Apparently Bd 9 more difficult than anticipated as OR failed to bid game as well|pg||
nt|psridhar: one useful technique is to win h ACE at trick 1 and then lay down h king-shows doubleton asking for SPS on the second trick|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphzqf: texas  leading 69 17|pg||
nt|panja: S should have shifted to @CQ..with 4 trumps..he is not interested in a ruff, is he?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|sunsamvar: JM might think north has @S|pg||
nt|panja: and the King asking was merely a ritual...|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume 2@C demands 2@D; N has either an invitational hand or out hand - agree Tez I wud Dbl|pg||

mb|1H|nt|panja: Day 3 bulletin is not yet out, it seems|pg||
nt|panja: Mahesh??|pg||
mb|3C|nt|panja: NS in OR overreached on this one|pg||
nt|panja: even with 33 @D, they are 1 trick short on 3nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: it will probably go 1@S if allowed, 3@D by N, and 4@S|pg||
nt|panja: 12-15 Nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: slam hand to finish - looks easy enough, but you never know|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: the Hooda team were down 42-0 after the first set|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzqe: bulletin is out Panja|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sandeep and Kaustabh must be thinking that they are more down on this table than they actually are and might take some chances|pg||
nt|panja: I was looking at CBA website..it is not there...and Arvind didn't sent report to Indianbridgecontacts either|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sunsamvar: Tx to our wonderful operator Mahesh in Mumbai and to the organisers for bringing us this broadcast|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Thanks Sunil |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|vicky888:  Sandip must have given more value to the hand due to 5 carder @c AK|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mcarroll: probably 1 off|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - lots of work|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and to Roland and bbo for teecasting this premier Indian event|pg||
nt|panja: 2Nt shows minimum|pg||
nt|panja: risky lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: 1NT is a shortness ask|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty Rajesh Tibrewala|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think that 6@S is automatic to find, but they're on their way . . .|pg||
nt|othered1: If west had a realistic entry, a @C back at trick 2 could lead declarer into a losing play.  But east won't underlead @DAK against slam.|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone know what 3@H and 4@C imply?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: guess controls|pg||
nt|othered1: Have @S been established as trumps?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told 3@H agreeed @S and cue-bid (I guess first round control?), 4@C cue, too.|pg||
nt|panja: so..board 46 will decide|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 46 is 2 imps - 3@C-1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so it looks like the Hooda team will win|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|panja: if the boys win, that will be first national level DEMICOMA triumph without me or Vivek playing....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that Hooda was 0-42 down after the first set|pg||
nt|othered1: they've played quite solidly after they got back into the match in the second quarter.|pg||
nt|panja: he must go for finessed in @D...|pg||
nt|panja: he is going by the theory S is likely to have 4M, if that is @S, he does not want to give a cheap trick|pg||
nt|nkgupt: venkatesh's 2nt looks better than 2@c other room....here dont know where S found the final raise|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Losing 1@H, 1@S 2@Cs, @Cruff and a trump so -2 |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sorry - no @H loser|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: this NS pair were instrumental in that|pg||

pc|s6|nt|sunsamvar: i think JM and Ashok had a good session|pg||
nt|panja: even with a first time @D finesse, E could have catered to a 3-3 break..|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
