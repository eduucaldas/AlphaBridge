mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|vugraphzqh: oh I missaw|pg||
mb|1H|an|spades, but not 5+ strong|mb|2D|nt|xenya: 3N is a poor contract on the last hand, but 5@C is not unreasonable|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|flash: Muiderberg is 2-suited opening bids, less than 1-bid strength?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzqh: 5+ majors, 4+ minor weak, but I missaw the hand, eyes getting tired I think ;)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|flash: 2@H for @Hs and another; 2@S for @Ss and a minor??|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: kibitzers claim 3 times hearts is natural|pg||
nt|flash: (the other room opened 2@H)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: so spades no longer count :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzqh: Wortel not fooled by kibitzers|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: this can make??  even with 3 rounds of @Ds?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|nt|flash: i'm afraid to see how the other room went down  :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: makeable with open cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: I think it makes after 3 rounds, play a heart to the 8|pg||
nt|flash: while this is playing out, let me get a head start on...    thnx to our operator, Han Peters, for a great job|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h8 is the key-card|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sT|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: she'll play Jansma for the @hA for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Gert Jan only bid 2@d|pg||
nt|flash: and special thnx to the tournament host and sponsor, Max Abraham - his generosity in support of bridge in the Netherlands over the years has been stupendous|pg||
nt|ralfwil: two rounds of @s , ruff a @c clean trumps and a @h to @h8|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: I can see Wortel going down after 4 rounds of clubs?|pg||
nt|flash: last 5 rounds of this event tomorrow; several other vugraph opportunities available today and tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: is that a reasonable line? I can't think anymore|pg||
nt|flash: pls check your bookmarked BBO Vugraph Schedule web page for events and local times|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: so the question is, what's more likely|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: 3rd spade with 4 clubs|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|h2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: or west holding the queen of hearts|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|h5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|flash: back at this hand, the lead of the @DT would have been far more threatening (and double-dummy); had declarer played low on the actual lead, the defense would have been hard-pressed ...|pg||
nt|flash: to give declarer a problem|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|h9|pc|c9|pg||
nt|flash: now declarer is headed down on any line?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: with diamonds 5-3, this line may have been best, hard to estimate|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|xenya: that @H5 discard was fatal -- now @Hs are blocked|pg||
