mb|2D|nt|lestergold: and to u too Carl|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a tame defence may let this thru|pg||
nt|chick: ouch, and N rescues them|pg||
nt|haans: but ...|pg||
nt|jaheim: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@C of course, partner should have both minors|pg||
nt|pelu: but pass is not an option by N - 2@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: East elected to bid NV - not unexpected|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame south for making the obvious lead|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 1@D no 5 c M|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Certainly better than this|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S first time - but now N sh have 10+ |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i must admit that as south i would chance a double here i like to earn imps|pg||
nt|jaheim: NS  won the mixed pair chship this year|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and adopting the trend towards 5 rather than 6 card suit|pg||
nt|jaheim: lots of toppairs playing 2 @D as a weak muli   and 2 @H @S as a serious weak 2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: presumably S cannot open 2H, but a more likely alternative would seem to be 1H. cant argue with success though:)|pg||
nt|chick: Pass by S is also an alternative :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very odd to bid 4H when 3N is virtually sure to go down|pg||
nt|frankaus: we are too lazy (or drunk) to look to see if the suns out :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: I see 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|lestergold: nom heart ruff but an immediate diamond swirtch and force will be uncomfortabelm fro declarer|pg||
nt|haans: slam possible :)|pg||
nt|april7: very aggressive bid by E|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 @D   prob   1 major|pg||
nt|april7: @S lead would be good,then down|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@H Doubled would have been interesting|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 4@C should lead to a rapid sign-off from East|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Kushari's splinter is limited, Laltu (East's nickname) did have couple of useful cards, but poor @s suit must have decided to lie low|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Nobu, please tell us about the Japanese ladies. Have they been regulars in the team for long?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: This EW pair has been played together for a long time.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: i prefer 1@H to 3|pg||
nt|chick: with 2 aces and 3 hearts, N must know that 3N is doomed.   must be he thought 4@H was makeable|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case why wouldnt he bid it on the porevious round?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surely E was not going to pass 3HX|pg||
nt|frankaus: fairly transparent singleton lead |pg||
nt|rv: He will hop with @DA, pitch @c on @CK, draw trumps and concede a @d|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: Results?|pg||

nt|haans: but may make Jt9 in @D = good|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed. The system I tend to use is that the Double of 2@D indicates that I was going to transfer to @Hs|pg||
nt|jaheim: EW  currently 2.   NS 4. place|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S thinking, 2 shows an honour, so it has to be either A or Ten, |pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|npcjpn: The other pair in open room is relatively new partnership.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: certainly true that Pass is an option for S. my comment about 1H was based on the manifest intention of S to do something other than the textbook pass, so i whould have prefaced my ...|pg||

nt|curtsolo: small pickup for Palestine on the first board, as 2@d made in the closed room|pg||
nt|peachy: it was makeable against best defense|pg||
nt|curtsolo: yes, looked like a trump coup would have worked out|pg||
nt|peachy: of course, we do it Dbldummy, she only with two hands visible:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: can make 6 @C here, can anyone bid it? |pg||
nt|curtsolo: often hard to recover on those deals unless you anticipate a poor trump break from the go|pg||
mb|p|nt|curtsolo: this will prove interesting... at favorable vul, EW may get in some major suit interference|pg||
nt|peachy: but when overtricks are not at stake in IMP scoring, it often pays to prepare for bad breaks|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: are you forcing to game with the N cards?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|curtsolo: doesn't seem like an outrageous stretch vul at imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|peachy: I would not, if playing 2/1. Standardish methods can bid the shape and bid 2C|pg||
nt|sybarra: if S just raises,  then what does N do |pg||
nt|curtsolo: jump to 3@d here suggests NS playing a SAYC-ish card|pg||
nt|peachy: agree|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: a bit unfortunate in that it really takes away a lot of critical exploration space|pg||
nt|curtsolo: hard for S to show decent @c support now|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: the priority is to get to 3nt|pg||
nt|curtsolo: from the right side|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: but not sure how S can do much differently given her hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: and certain wants to say "pard I have a good hand" |pg||
nt|curtsolo: 6@c may be the double dummy winner here, but the priority should be on finding the best game before a thin slam|pg||
nt|peachy: Perhaps 2D would be enough, to preserve bidding space, because responder cannot pass 2D after bidding 2C 1st rd|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: 6 @C makes with clubs 2/2 and @D hook on |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure its a great slam |pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|peachy: behind in a match or playing against much stronger team, I would try for it|pg||
pc|s5|nt|curtsolo: in my experience, with minor suits it is better to make what might be a slight underbid of 2 rather than jumping... it is easy to get caught up on those auctions|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: certainly there are hands where 3N could make and 4HX be a good save -- mostly they start with a longish minor lacking only the ace plus two heart stoppers and enough spade tricks ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to get to nine. but it is extremely pessimistic to save since there are zillions of hands where 3N fails, maybe by several tricks. so if you don;t try for that kind of good result ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when your preempt creates the opportunity, you ought to stop  preempoting|pg||

mb|2C|nt|haans: or will we?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I'll bet this double isn't penalty, though|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sharkey: 3@C nå fra N?|pg||

nt|lestergold: i dont really understand the defence the play for the ruff wsd pstently hopeless when a forcing game had obviousn prospects|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib points out @D9 a better lead with actual holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffee break hand 4 easy peasy @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|davidstern: He was the third from the right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C forcing 2@D, then 3@S? Invitational with 6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Probably not since East is thinking|pg||
nt|dslee: 3@H now|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Good morning, everybody, from overcast central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
nt|jaheim: D  is prob  3 @H|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bet it shows 13 cards, some of them pictures|pg||
nt|rv: NS not sure of their agreements here possibly, I presume North took South's X as responsive|pg||
nt|dslee: the hint N has to take is that his ptr might not have a 4 card M|pg||
nt|rv: in modern expert methods, I presume South should pass and collect undoubled if North can't double again|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sharkey: S ikely to try the 10 here |pg||
nt|haans: good bidding |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Tricky contract|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@S is a little unlucky oonb this hand with two diamond ruffs and the spade offside|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one possibility was to start with 2@H over 2@D, but you can understand the double  |pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: evt   2 nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: Det var vel alternativet|pg||
nt|jaheim: valgte kløvern, hadde fortjent å finne makker med omvendt minorfarger   imo|pg||
nt|sharkey: God strategi å sette press på motstanderne i gunstig sone|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 @H  prob  shoving 3 + @H|pg||
nt|april7: best is to cash 2 top @D and then playing @C ace and @C|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 3@H should make on the nose|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@H last making spot|pg||
nt|frankaus: real tough to find the right strain and level on this 1|pg||
nt|dslee: 2@H is better bid from N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now NS are swinging across the line|pg||
nt|rv: I will fault South's double here more than North's first double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to be fair, this is a very awkward hand for NS|pg||
nt|frankaus: my choice would bre 3NT after the X by N|pg||
mb|3N|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|haans: if they make 1NTx they do not get game |pg||
nt|chick: 4@H looks good superficially, but I think difficult to make.  3@S has no chance.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we can see that spade intervention might make this tricky, but the chance for that has gone|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: technically 4@s is a vbiablem save but who is gonna bid it it could be heading for 800 not agood imnvestment unless you cansee al the cards|pg||
nt|jaheim: S is prob. very tired,  a "old"  (59)  lady playing every day since last friday|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi everyone|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Carl|pg||
nt|pelu: u were right with 3@s :)|pg||
nt|rv: South should either pass (my choice) or bid 3n|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like they will get to 4@H|pg||
nt|frankaus: when in doubt ........... bid 3NT ......... Hamman|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: hi Cornelia|pg||

nt|rnmalik: indeed. @SJ would have been interesting.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Absolutely|pg||
nt|baardolav: should make even if all the "quesses" goes wrong|pg||

nt|pelu: I see a loser in 4 suits :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: no not a perfect |pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: a good thing to discuss in all of your partnerships:  how do we continue after a reverse?|pg||
nt|curtsolo: commonly, 2nt or repeating the major warn of weakness|pg||
mb|2S|nt|curtsolo: rebididng the major here only promises a 5 card suit, generally|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|peachy: also commonly, cheaper of 4th suit or 2NT warns of weakness|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|curtsolo: the key is that - since you are forced to bid for a round - you've got to tell partner whether you are bidding under duress or actually have values|pg||
nt|peachy: as curt said, the important thing is that you have agreements|pg||
nt|curtsolo: a popular choice on these auctions is a Lebensohl-style treatment|pg||
nt|curtsolo: in which case responder's preference of opener's minor suit is positive/forward going|pg||
nt|curtsolo: I suspect W sits for 3nt here... possibly contemplating 4@s on the good doubleton|pg||

nt|marlowepi: as a very active player, S must be disappointed to be in 4th shair with that hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: At least Helness eventually got a @C trick :)|pg||

nt|davidstern: Not a fan of the pass by W - I would prefer to bid 2@C to let partner know I have values else I will be under pressure later|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Kushari-Laltu play 1n here to show 16-18, hence Laltu Xed instead of 1@s on account of much better @c suit |pg||

nt|baardolav: 2@d is a weak multi|pg||

mb|3D|nt|jaheim: K of cl and a claim?|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club at its best|pg||
nt|baardolav: this will make +2 or something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2@d is a Multi, South can respond 2@h (pass/correct) or 2@S (pass/3@h). His hearts are good, could easily have bid 2@s   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: South with long hearts assumes his partner has spades :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@s is natural not forcing in weak multi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can play it that way.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: wow! pass with void?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At least they can take it 1 down|pg||

nt|pelu: looks like NS is not so experient|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 3@D from West?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: headed for game not making perhaps|pg||
nt|chick: this can make 4@H but not 5@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lesser evil and pass by E.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Pas probably limits the damage as any EW contract would be pretty expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @S slam can make, but unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: an aggressive lead which on this layout costs a trick|pg||
nt|rv: yes I agree Laltu should have 2 shown suits with more shape earlier with sandwitch NT or Mich or pass now|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: i have stopped bidding 4@H 30 years ago|pg||
nt|haans: support x better than delayed support|pg||
nt|npcjpn: may be great score in matchpoint.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, North|pg||
nt|frankaus: saved|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i would bid something - choice between 4n and 5H not easy but i would fera missing slam to much not to make a try|pg||
nt|sharkey: @CJ Jan Arne - and claim :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally prefer to use a 2@C rebid after 1@D opening to show a good hand. Gives you room to explore below 3N, at a cost on some natural auctions on lesser hands.|pg||
nt|chick: wow, I would never sell out with S's hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud be off 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Hamdi  welcome |pg||

pc|s6|nt|jaheim: mm  |pg||
nt|Walddk4: But 100 is not much compensation for a missed game|pg||

nt|npcjpn: dbl by West show @H and some @s?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But can they make 5@C?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jaheim: mm   5 @D  -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@d can lose spade heart and @d 3n very vulnerable too|pg||
nt|sharkey: Agree - think he shud fight with 3@H|pg||
nt|april7: depends on the play,W might lose 1 @S,1@H 2@D and 1 @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D I mean|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if South put the spades down first....|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|frankaus: they have agreed @H so X cant be t/o|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: perfectly reasonable as games make on dim finesse|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Would you x NT after first x by W and pass by E?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W showed the other two suits by x.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think I would find the Pass, but I also think being aggressive is a winner in the long term|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: very little info from auction west has opted for non commital 'safe' trump lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, they have also stopped at the two-level, so double is not needed as any sort of competitive effort|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade switch obvious but doesnt matter spade loser cannot go|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mcarroll: AKx trumps lead would have made this a struggle for declarer|pg||
pc|hT|nt|davidstern: Four rounfs of hearts would have been best|pg||

pc|s3|nt|haans: biggest problem with 4@H is that you need 10 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: 4441 hands often do not play well nor are they comfportable to bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|curtsolo: or perhaps 2@c doubled :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: often end up too high|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: 3NT much better spot as it happens|pg||

nt|curtsolo: 4@h is a unilateral call|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||

nt|Walddk4: How to gain 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|dslee: ahh|pg||
nt|frankaus: peter hall's book competative bidding at pairs has an excellent chapter on competative doubles - i highly recomend it|pg||
nt|bucheister: are they playing a club system?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not think so |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am not sure, just joined and 1st time working abt their teams, but i guess after a few boards we'll reach the truth|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphznb: weak multi or strong|pg||
nt|haans: Voll right thats a weak 2|pg||
nt|chick: we all know better than to bet with you, Jan :)|pg||
nt|jaheim: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: may keep NS out of the cold @D slam|pg||
nt|april7: just 11 tricks possible, but depends on the lead and continuation|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@S with 10 or 11 tricks depending on the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 11 on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: takes the guesswork out of these situation|pg||
nt|bucheister: the meckwell two heart response is very useful on this type of hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sharkey: Depends on what x of 2@D would mean|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1 nt 4 minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 1NT is 8-15 p and at least 4-4 in @c and @d|pg||
nt|april7: do they play strong pass?|pg||
nt|rv: Click http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/DisplayResultsT4?club_event_id=15508&header=pabf&fdc=EWDPRAUDG for latest results|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: EW will find 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: there are 15 teams participating in the event|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: well this slam wont be missed thats for sure|pg||
nt|othered1: South's double is interesting with that shape and not that many high cards|pg||
nt|haans: odd take out x|pg||
nt|henryb:  Going back to board one, where Lunna mysteriously took 12 tricks in 6N, shouldn't it be possible for big club players to reach 6@c?|pg||
nt|othered1: North has to act h ere and EW may find themselves defending a high @D contract|pg||
nt|haans: big clubs does anything :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: in board 1, Lunna got a diamond in the lead, and South was endplayed in spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose it depends on what you open 2@d on - if you can do it with 5@h, then yes, 2@S natural makes sense |pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade partial ERW and Hearts or clubs NS|pg||
nt|pelu: I would never open in East - would u?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Singapore currently in 6th place|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Kvarngraven 1st to think were are all the cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: at +17 imps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/MeckWellEscapes.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: Palestine, with -53 imps, is in 13th place, but there are several segments remaining and opportunities for plenty of movement in the standings|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jaheim: ja   hadde gått 2 bet jeg|pg||
nt|jaheim: minst  :)|pg||
nt|jaheim: another slam coming up|pg||
nt|sharkey: 18-19|pg||
nt|lestergold: whether they bid the grand tho is open to question|pg||
nt|othered1: I might rebid @H on south's hand and I think it wins over the long term.|pg||
nt|haans: with u|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some would use stayman as N|pg||
nt|april7: should S open and N passes then E will come in in @H and then  perhaps 1,2,3 NT???|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Obviously the dealing machine is saving the games and slams for later in the tournament ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade lead and heart off dummy would work well for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|pelu: give up: 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: E-W pair play rebid of 2M after 2/1 to be catch-all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT forcing - very sensible|pg||
nt|rv: they play 2/1 as GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm that will tend to ruole out a heart contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib asked why not open weak 2@H with S hand on Bd 17.  Reason is weak 2 openings 3rd hand NV can be very weak at Expert level, and this was closer to an opening hand.  Also a ...|pg||
nt|sharkey: matter of agreement|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah this may get them to the bad game|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: tror de fleste av oss hadde det|pg||
nt|jaheim: Viego in trbl,  but 1400 in the "bank"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you open with a sub-minimum in 3rd seat, fair enough, at least have a decent suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: NS are playing in my local club|pg||
nt|lestergold: anymore and someone will be in tgrouble|pg||
nt|haans: ty Liv needed that info|pg||
nt|henryb:  Did South really have to act over 1@s Hans?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think many of us would begin with 1@D as W dealer|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: 7@C makes|pg||
nt|chick: I think that hand is much too strong for a preempt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dbl looks like DONT  - six card suit somewhere. Bit thin if it is|pg||
nt|npcjpn: there are many players who does not like pass in 3rd seat even vulnerable (in Japan).|pg||
pc|d2|nt|april7: I don't think W should pass 1@D, has 5 P!!! and then 4@H would have been reached making 5 if starts with @S finesse but 10 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|april7: down from top on @S lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would rather open 1@H if you forced me to open|pg||
nt|npcjpn: me too.|pg||
nt|pelu: pest and colera :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sharkey: Gjetter spillet går ut|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|chick: If I get support for either suit, I don't play a 6-5 hand below game|pg||
nt|bucheister: 4H seems to be an impatient bid; don't you agree?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7N has 13 tops |pg||
nt|lestergold: n /s in trouble !|pg||
nt|haans: to good effect|pg||
nt|pelu: can West pass?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one of the legacies of the old Acol system was that 2NT here was not forcing|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari will sign-off in 3N to limit hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/25udavr  for running scores |pg||
nt|sybarra: seems so John |pg||
nt|h_karluk: absolutely, even i can tell misunderstanding of fast arrival concept|pg||
nt|bucheister: if E bids 2D, W will bid 3D and E can bid 3NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess A count, K attitude there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so the defenders would have no difficulty to cash 2@d, 1@c and a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but let's wait and see, who knows there may be a slip in defense|pg||
pc|dK|nt|frankaus: scoring looks to be done by martin wilcox cheif scorer for ABF |pg||
nt|dslee: now laltu might force a round?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jaheim: y   but no D   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, we don't want 1100|pg||
nt|baardolav: no one can ask for aces...|pg||
nt|pelu: plauge or colera, sorry :)|pg||
nt|pelu: plague - new keyboard :(:(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this was because when someone opened the bidding, you could never be certain that they had an opening bid|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jaheim: her måtte sp K ut|pg||
nt|jaheim: y   13 toptricks,  with 2 sptricks|pg||
nt|haans: dirty bridge|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I tend to agree|pg||
nt|rv: Laltu's 4N is Quant|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh my,  made 4 in other room |pg||
nt|h_karluk: unfortunately true|pg||
nt|sybarra: south cashed a @D, then led a hts |pg||
nt|h_karluk: why i do not have such defenders, i think i am a jealous guy :)|pg||
mc|9|nt|lestergold: 7N is technically better as well because if clubs broke badly you would have the spade position to fall back on|pg||
nt|sharkey: 7@S depending on the @S finesse|pg||
nt|april7: but after ruff S is endplayed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so you had to have lots of bids that acted as invites. Partner bid on if he really did have an opening bid, and passed otherwise|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari would have accepted Inv to slam with max (13-14) for his stated minimum (10-14)|pg||

nt|curtsolo: a definite head scratcher|pg||
nt|davidstern: 6@H here|pg||
nt|davidstern: 6NT making 3-3-4-2|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: or even 6@c... all sorts of possibilities|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think 6NT is slightly better as residual club chances if hearts are really filty|pg||
nt|davidstern: filthy|pg||
nt|peachy: and it is safer, can always get the tricks from clubs if hearts break badly|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|peachy: you type faster, David:)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Some people from the comedy channel are specing here - 7@D suggested by one of them|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: well, the old saying is that you need to count 14 tricks to bid a grand at imps|pg||
mb|5H|nt|curtsolo: and here, in spite of the abundance of power, you can't quite manage that|pg||
nt|davidstern: If they are playing 2/1 I dont like the jump to 4NT - With 2/1 I like slow auctions|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|peachy: Based on earlier auction, they do not play 2/1|pg||
mb|6D|nt|curtsolo: N will deny @cK and they likely stop at 6nt|pg||
nt|curtsolo: though I'm not sure what 6@d is|pg||
nt|davidstern: One king - already showsn the @H king perhaps|pg||
nt|peachy: it could be   of kings|pg||
nt|curtsolo: number of kings apparently|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: an inferior treatment to specific kings|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Yes but not @H king which was already shown|pg||
nt|davidstern: So 6@C = no kings 6@D=1 king|pg||
nt|curtsolo: though none of that matters much when your side has 34 hcp, right? :)|pg||
nt|peachy: we are having our guessing clubs here :)  System cards are not available, but we have heard EW play SAYC style natural and NS do not play 2/1 :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4NT:5@H showed two key cards without @HQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|davidstern: Seems to me anyways|pg||
nt|davidstern: 12 tricks and moving right along|pg||
nt|curtsolo: I am with David in that I don't see the rush to bid Blackwood, but S can get information keying off the @h suit looking at the @hQ|pg||

nt|chick: again, too good for a preempt|pg||
nt|haans: "Not for person below 100"|pg||

nt|april7: 3@H p  p  X  p 4@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sound reasonable to me|pg||
nt|april7: on @H lead then 5,on @D ace lead only 4,but bidding might develop differently|pg||
nt|chick: would you jump to game with N's hand over 3@H P P X?  partner is under pressure and doesn't have to have 20 pts for a X|pg||
nt|april7: you are right, but even over 3@S S will bid 4, but thats a different story|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It was somewhat dangerous cash that last trump and then @DA and king|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|april7: N might reopen with a X, then S might reach qa @H contract at 3 level, but EW might compete to 3 @S|pg||

nt|mdgraham: hmm 1NT|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: form theirmn gross overbidding|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 1NT = 8-12, at least 4-4 in @h and @s|pg||

nt|jaheim: men på 2 trinnet,   3 ru er 5 kort imo|pg||
nt|jaheim: D  =  3 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Surely 4@H is the bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a simple 2@h rebid expected |pg||
mb|4D|nt|sharkey: Spørs hvilke krav meldinger de har til rådighet - hvis 2 NT krav viser farge|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N migh be best on this on NS cards alone, but @H more likely to be found.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: not 2|pg||
nt|chick: moot now as W elected to treat his hand as an opening bid|pg||
nt|npcjpn: it will be tough not leading a spade.|pg||
nt|frankaus: some would open North hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but preferred a jump rebid, i guess was useless, slow approach would produce a better way to see what partner have|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Good bid by Kvangraven|pg||
nt|lestergold: no lead to beat|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N|pg||
nt|sharkey: S unsure about @C suit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south may be tempted to play this in hearts|pg||
nt|jaheim: or lucky, finding p with 10 of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: if so three rounds of spades with the 9@h ruffing in would not be nice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S seems makeable on trump coup|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: may be even 6...|pg||

nt|marlowepi: hi henry:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
nt|haans: Henry :)|pg||
nt|haans: no alert of 2nt?|pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s would seem to have the advantage that it leaves more room, and your hand is better than a weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was bid as good-bad, but W is not sure. TD at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was not alerted|pg||

nt|mdgraham: if 2@c asks for a four-card major, West should reply 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: on the  lead of @CA and a @C?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 500 if axed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 7|pg||
nt|rv: hand is too strong for 1n in my opiniom, I expect Rubens-Kaplan calculator to indicate atleast  18 hcp for West hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: off to the races is my guess |pg||
nt|bucheister: N really bid the spots off those cards|pg||

nt|baardolav: is this right?|pg||
nt|april7: tough game here!!!!|pg||
nt|baardolav: the biddings i mean?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ms Kobayashi likes to open light it seems|pg||

nt|rnmalik: favourable placement of cards for 4@S.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At least this resembles an opening hand|pg||
nt|pelu: strange lead when u know that pd has max 2 @hs|pg||
nt|npcjpn: I do not play against this pair so often, so I don't know their style.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 9 claimable immediate tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: In my view an awful convention - tell opps your distribution|pg||
nt|haans: no alert = good hand = 3@S good bid = missed game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not an easy grand decision but its there|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: men meds gammelmakkern som sitter på hjørnet hadde det nok blitt 2 kl|pg||
nt|frankaus: too stong 4 me |pg||
nt|mdgraham: imho, 1NT is a complete distortion|pg||

nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||

nt|lestergold: what?|pg||
nt|baardolav: this will be a disaster for NS|pg||

nt|sharkey: @C lead beats it I think|pg||
nt|chick: seems like a good way to tell the opponents your distribution|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: ten tricks then|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: @H8 and @C to K would be a very nice defense|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcarroll: Yes, the nightmare scenario for declarer is if the EW @Cs were reversed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even with diamonds coming in, North has only eight tricks, and entries are a problem|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: agree it seems pretty ugly to me|pg||

nt|davidstern: A slamming we will go a slamming we will go hi ho the dairyo a slamming we will go|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Have to avoid 6@C though|pg||
nt|davidstern: 6NT will make on the heart greak|pg||
nt|davidstern: Break|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|davidstern: 6NT by North is a sensational not so good by South|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: yes, need to keep that spade holding protected|pg||
nt|curtsolo: though more often than not, you'll strain to let the 2@c bidder delcare|pg||
nt|davidstern: As noted by a quick spec 7NT will make as East gets squeezed in blacks BUT why would declarer play for that versus a direct spade finesse|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|davidstern: Yawn - same spec - Because it's more fun?|pg||
mb|p|nt|curtsolo: 2@d could be waiting here or simply A or K or better hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|davidstern: No more fun is picking the opponent you like less before dciding|pg||
mb|p|nt|curtsolo: indeed|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am guessing 2@D is positive or negative|pg||
nt|curtsolo: 3@c some flavor of Stayman - regular or possibly Puppet|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|peachy: anybody'|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|peachy: s guess what 4NT is|pg||
nt|peachy: but apparently Blackwood or RKC|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am thinking 3@C was some sort of puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|curtsolo: this hand illustrates some of the cracks in the 2@c strong opener component of SAYC and 2/1|pg||
mb|5N|nt|curtsolo: bidding room really evaporates in a hurry|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|davidstern: I played Symetric Relay for many years where you could ask for Aces, Kings and Queens and you learn very quickly that slow bidding slams are the way to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: It is generally not the responder who uses RKC, if anybody, after 2C has been opened|pg||
nt|peachy: Plus 4NT should not even be RKC or blackwood|pg||
nt|davidstern: I like the responder Blackwooding if partner is a well defined hand like balanced 21-22 |pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: But where South is unknown slow bidding is better|pg||
mb|p|nt|curtsolo: one of my partners is fond of saying that bidding is like a romantic courtship... the best relationships go slowly :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, I suppose some could say S is balanced|pg||

nt|peachy: good technique, 3-2 club break more likely than 3-3 heart|pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice choice of words|pg||
nt|curtsolo: and one has to wonder... why are they in grand in an 8 card fit missing the Q?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|curtsolo: (not to mention the J and 9)|pg||
nt|peachy: and spade finesse as last resort, or a squeeze|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h8|nt|curtsolo: moreover, I would like to know how N could overrule partner in the closed room and raise to 7@c|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|curtsolo: that's a good way to lose partners|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|davidstern: Total Breach of discline. Put your mouse over the closed room result to see the auction|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|davidstern: Put your mouse over this room's contract to see the last trick|pg||
nt|peachy: Happened to me once, I was silly, Partner insisted to know how I could bid 3S.  I was tired and said:I just took the bidding cards out of the box and out them on the table, see, ...|pg||
nt|peachy: like this?"|pg||
nt|curtsolo: hang on to your Scotch, David... the Singapore south in the other room is going to be after it|pg||
nt|davidstern: If you want to watch both tables simply open another browser window (IE or Firefox) and go to www.bbotv.com and follow your way|pg||

nt|sharkey: In 7 board matches overtricks often significant in score|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@c avaialble as cards liem 3n no good|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@c is what i meant to type|pg||
nt|sharkey: or 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: that too but game unlikely to be bid in either back suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S may actually be a better contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: both comntractsb less than 50% no real reason to justify bidding game here|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Hard to see anything except a flat board here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Lots of bidding in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: snei    alle lagturneringene har vært trege fra begynnelsen i år|pg||
nt|lestergold: another frigid 3n thx to favourable layout of @d suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: On previous hand it took a @D lead to set 4@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or 6NT|pg||
nt|april7: same with 6NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tsukamoto knows what to expext by now; partner has 10-12 points when she opens|pg||
nt|pelu: good play for 4@h on small values|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphznb: 1 down in last board|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
nt|henryb:  what I thought|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they reach slam there is no real alternative to the @D finesse|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H by EW losing 2@C and 1 @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What would you bid now, guys?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: snei   = nei   :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS har god stamp i 5@H |pg||
nt|sharkey: or @D ruff before communications in @C cut off|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 2@H, 2@D, double?|pg||

nt|dslee: rather easy one for EW|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: hmmay not necessartily be bid here|pg||

nt|haans: 2@S GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: 4@s looks best.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: how about 2NT? any strong two suiter.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not easy|pg||
nt|frankaus: i like 3 card raise over 1@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: certainly now - the odds on @DK being right just went up|pg||

mb|2H|nt|haans: three card raise rarer and rarer|pg||

nt|chick: :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: now looks like a club system for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes -on review think 5@C better|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not like east's double tend to get into troubole when u faikl to bid ur main asset namely clubs here|pg||
nt|april7: is N considering a X???|pg||
nt|mcarroll: That is a very sporting 2@S|pg||
nt|april7: thats why it will cost a lot|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  West has, imo, a marginal game force.|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Hi Mike, all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and with 3 tricks N expects something from pd - He will be disappointed!!|pg||
nt|jaheim: Viego in trbl  now|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2NT by South 3@S by North now |pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of bidding here - 60 HCP in this board? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No matter what, 2@H worked like a dream|pg||
nt|rv: this event is played like erstwhile European Open Teams Champs, 18 rounds amongst 19 teams with winner of RR winning the event|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H's 3/3|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: now will bid|pg||
nt|haans: yes if no agreement|pg||

nt|pelu: 4@S down 1?|pg||

nt|bucheister: I am surprised that S did not bid 3C asking on this hand;  it is the key to a club slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: !K offside, seems either 3N by N or 4@h by S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @Sk|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and as u say it may well go off |pg||
nt|sharkey: @DA lead OR|pg||

nt|lestergold: is east that stromngb that a doubolem is needed before showing the clubs/|pg||
nt|haans: many play 2nt as invite or more|pg||
nt|haans: many scandinavians at least|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@D - 3 NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: OK Natural :)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: or 3@c by North and 3@s by South.|pg||
nt|davidstern: 6@C would be a good spot|pg||
nt|npcjpn: if you open light, you have to be lucky.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jaheim: 2 hj med 4 kortstøtte,  ja ja, ikke min melding|pg||
nt|sharkey: if East were ready to bid 4@C on 3@D he shud be able to do the same over 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Martin. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@d South African transfer to 4@S....|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Hardly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South really playing with fire here. You suspect 3@s would have been passed out|pg||
nt|jaheim: D   is @H lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: It seems the NS style may be to support immediately with 3 spades but I suspect that the bidding is consistent with 3 spades and six clubs perhaps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however slam, no heart losers, only a club loser|pg||
mb|4N|nt|lestergold: combined 24 points doesnt have to bid game|pg||
nt|jaheim: mm   1 nt opening in W|pg||
nt|chick: at least S didn't draw the fatal (to defenders) club lead by bidding them|pg||
nt|chick: now can N find a heart?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Well Leaped|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 11 easy tricks with hearts 3-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  but woud you bid less than game opposite partner's opening 1@s?|pg||
nt|chick: booo|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good lead.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: For defence.|pg||
nt|chick: pretty skinny GF by S|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4@d splinter discourages.|pg||
nt|davidstern: North may be aiming for 6@C|pg||
nt|davidstern: which would be playable opposite nothing more than the @SK and @CAQ|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sharkey: Vet ikke hvor N fant doblingen i Åpent Rom?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C makes - not 6...|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 4@d is forcing, I approve, otherwise 5@d seems indicated|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S was said to be GF\|pg||
nt|chick: if 2@S is GF....|pg||
nt|jaheim: so   10 points  is enough 4 a gf?   strange|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ino may have been better supporting clubs to allow South to better judge the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Fant den her og...|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think South's hand is NTish - wud have tried 3@D to make pd bid 3 NT with @D stopper|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, its frustrating when you find later that you pushed them to a  possibly making game |pg||
nt|april7: @S @S @S the W should discard ace of @C on 3d @D|pg||
nt|davidstern: South should now bid six with the @SK and a singleton heart|pg||
mb|6C|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|haans: xy Stayman in Sweden we belive that was invented in Denmark long time ago|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Miss Jane pulled most probably Miss Greta would respond|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think S should bid 5C over 3D, then he is in position to pass 5D|pg||
nt|henryb:  Suth could not affort Blackwood|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
mb|7C|nt|rv: this format is not favorite of many of the purists who prefer k/o matches to decide top placings since this format favors beating weak teams comprehensively|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: after the 3@D rebid, most players play 3@S as competitive only - they either double or bid 3@H as a game try|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|bucheister: oops|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is too high|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit too much |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2@D GF|pg||
nt|april7: only hope for E to get in if K or Q of @C|pg||
nt|april7: thats an interesting defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: as spec pointsn o9ut he has forced himnself to bid 4@c over 3@d by his pard whcih would be overdoing the hand|pg||
nt|april7: W must  pray S having another @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: some would claim|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no claim yet?|pg||
nt|sybarra: some imps back to palestine most likely |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think Miss Greta forgot who was the captain|pg||
nt|bucheister: 6C would be a great spot even though it does not make|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|mcarroll: But on the bidding W may play S for a singleton @S and |pg||
nt|frankaus: quite a good method IMO|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharkey: East got the clue he neede|pg||
nt|haans: i agree 5@D not 4@D best bid|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AK@S and @HK pitching 3@Ds and @D finesse and one @C loser.|pg||
nt|april7: 5 of @S = @C entry|pg||

mb|2H|mb|d|nt|curtsolo: wonder if 2@h here is accompanying the multi-style, showing the side suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|davidstern: I was too busy commentating to notice how declarer went down in 6NT - finessed spades before testing hearts???|pg||
mb|p|nt|curtsolo: practice finesse, apparently|pg||
nt|davidstern: The finesse would not yield enough tricks if it worked and nothing else did so was unnecessary had heart or club break to make and if both failed the spade finesse was useless|pg||
nt|curtsolo: another great (I would say almost critical) time to play Lebensohl - after 2x-double|pg||
mb|3H|nt|curtsolo: so that you can distinguish the "stop making me bid hand" from the hand with some values when partner doubles|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|peachy: W better Pass now|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Fine double by South telling partner to lead a heart|pg||
mb|4C|nt|curtsolo: the heart bidding may keep EW out of a bad 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Problem here is that East has NO idea whether West has any values at all|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: ...and... into a bad 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 5C n ot much better, 3NT at least had a chance|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3NT is of course cold on finessing both club honours|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: I guess we will assume that East showed values by bidding 3@C and NOT Lebensohl but very muddy waters|pg||
pc|hA|nt|curtsolo: without the 2@h call, we very might well have seen 1nt-3nt and a club lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: I admire South for not doubling - seems little point|pg||
nt|curtsolo: I concur... you are only helping declarer with the double, and if you beat it one trick, it nets you an extra 3 imps|pg||

nt|frankaus: one can still get a "flat pitch" V a weak tem and be disadvantaged though|pg||

nt|baardolav: yeah... |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not provide him with a route map to 9 tricks|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Last board of this segment, interesting hands as reflected by the respective scores, no unwanted swings.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's written black on white|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But maybe she could not see that she had 11 tricks; that's an excuse|pg||

nt|sybarra: yes still |pg||
mb|2H|nt|sharkey: The challenge here is to bid game|pg||
nt|davidstern: South got a heart lead and carelessly ruffed a diamond losing all communication with dummy|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Or 6NT? with 12 tops?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A bit surprising nobody found the red card after 4@S in OR|pg||

nt|davidstern: I should say I have stuck with it ever since|pg||
nt|pelu: borderline 2@D (Michael) in Red|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Amazing, EW sold out to 2@S on board 6 in the open room|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: as would I|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will get to game now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West doubled 1NT, then she doubled 2@D and then she passed 2@S|pg||
nt|rv: Laltu should pass here, not enough for raise to 3@d in my opinion|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sharkey: 2NT Invitational Values min @S and 4 card support|pg||
nt|april7: but cross ruff is already open|pg||
nt|npcjpn: @dQ and @CK are great card for East.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: but needs to lead a @D, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of this session has been when you are dealt a double then double|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why didnt S bid 3 NT?|pg||
nt|haans: invite or not invite that is the question|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H prermpt in my book|pg||

nt|jaheim: 1   i think   ,  Liv Marit|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: yes, you're right jaheim|pg||
nt|april7: I think losing at most 2 @S and 2 aces|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: one more match|pg||

mb|p|nt|davidstern: And even then......|pg||
nt|npcjpn: @D to 9.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: East should have @CA instead of @CKJ to bid 3@D.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, and a trump short as well|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks a too round for my liking|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as i inspected $23 each session for open pairs|pg||
nt|bucheister: philly is pricey; the large market next to the Marriott is just great; I could eat there everyday; fresh seafood; pastas; every type of food served in small booth areas at ...|pg||
nt|bucheister: reasonable prices|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i ve never been in Philly but heard there's a great Metro system|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: AKK is extra in it self|pg||
nt|henryb:  better case at matchpoints|pg||
nt|sharkey: We would all lead @HQ vs 3 NT and set it....|pg||
nt|chick: and I have a known double fit in the majors (assuming a normal takeout double)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 2@D to show both M and some points|pg||
nt|haans: yep good for 2@D instead of @H bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: im on Volls side|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Depends what 2NT showed|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: there has been a fair amountg of no trump avoidance too|pg||
nt|sharkey: May work out ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: im susrprised that 3n failed in open room|pg||
nt|haans: yes at IMP you seldom pass before game|pg||
nt|chick: that would also work if such agreed|pg||
nt|sharkey: This won't be easy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True Roland|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS wil be quite pleased to gain an imp after going four down vulnerable in a freely-bid game |pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: Solves trump problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ive checked play first took club the unatural way then after spade switch took a secons spade finesse rather than dim finesse when defenders had warned himn that spades were ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: both 'wrong'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, the cardinal sin, Mike. Declarer had his contract but went for overtricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Viego will suffer their first defeat |pg||
nt|h_karluk: I liked The Marriot, have been there in many sectionals, regionals|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  if partner signs off the game may be less than 50%|pg||
nt|davidstern: South will switch to a spade at a million miles and hour if East plays another diamond |pg||
nt|pelu: yes KJ no value when pd 5-5 in major|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf  for results|pg||
nt|pelu: a major Q better than @cK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: i see contract failed in open but surely playing on clubs declarer should make this|pg||
nt|haans: you need a good 50% to bid non vul games|pg||
nt|haans: better bidding than OR|pg||
nt|pelu: ??????????????|pg||
nt|npcjpn: East probably hoped miracle AQ in majors.|pg||

nt|iceblue: but got is not sitting behind him:)|pg||
