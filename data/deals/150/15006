nt|daveharty: if nothing good happens soon for EW, they may start swinging for the fences|pg||
nt|curtsolo: both pairs in the closed room playing 2/1 with strong NT|pg||
nt|curtsolo: in the closed room are Steve Stewart/Paul Pressly sitting EW for Kansas City; Mark Ehret and Lee Hastings NS for StL|pg||
nt|daveharty: lots of tricks in a diamond contract here for EW, if they can get into the auction|pg||
mb|1N|nt|curtsolo: Stack should open 1NT here, which might make that @d partial tough to find|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: you guys doubling back in with E hand here?|pg||

nt|curtsolo: they should be playing 16 boards|pg||
nt|phil: how many so far? |pg||
nt|daveharty: so there is some systemic swing potential|pg||
nt|curtsolo: I like to say that whenever partner gives you an unnecessary raise, it's a compliment to your ability to play the dummy... right?|pg||
nt|daveharty: not the start EW were hoping for|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|daveharty: sometimes hard to shake off a defensive error and concentrate on the task at hand|pg||
nt|curtsolo: EW will not only need swings, but they really can't even afford the nickels and dimes of overberries on those partscores|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|r|nt|curtsolo: pickup chance for StL on this deal|pg||
nt|daveharty: game missed in the other room, so a swing is there for EW if they can find it|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|phil: they might have defended 1N xx'd there for a moment|pg||

nt|daveharty: or are they still ongoing?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d8|nt|curtsolo: now this hand often poses a problem for the forcing NTers|pg||
nt|curtsolo: the other flights should be in their final quarters... maybe we can get some results as those come in|pg||
pc|dK|nt|phil: if you play Drury, you need some some agreements on how to show clubs by a passed hand - was 1N really forcing? |pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|curtsolo: may have been semi-forcing here, a common passed hand treatment|pg||
nt|daveharty: west has to be thrilled with this dummy|pg||
nt|daveharty: QTx is a great catch|pg||

nt|daveharty: right...we've all been in worse slams|pg||
mb|3C|an|alert|mb|p|nt|phil: hopefully WQ can show shortness|pg||
nt|curtsolo: now presumably 3@c is "I like it"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is E whpo could view it as an opportunity. too good for 1nT at the score|pg||
nt|phil: West|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|phil: on a hook and a little more|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: awfully prime cards for E - would you consider opening 1@c and jump rebidding 2NT on a hand like that?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daveharty: i doubt west will push on|pg||
nt|phil: I wouldnt|pg||
nt|sybarra2: treatments vary as to whether 3 @C= good clubs or the relay suit would shows good clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wouldnt consider it at all., would just do it|pg||
nt|phil: nice controls, but theres no intermediates|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|curtsolo: 3@d here by Arba apparently a cue, but many players show shortness at that point|pg||
nt|daveharty: right phil, plus there's the very likely possibility that partner responds in a major...what then?|pg||
nt|phil: however, if you are looking for a swing, you might get one if the auction starts 1@c - 1M - 3M, and the contract gets played by W|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the ppomt ios, if you need a swing it would come at a suit contract. E has more than a 1N opener if the ultimate denomination is a suit. intyermediates are more important for NT ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam, but that is usel;ess for swing purposes. at the score, assume any swing will be i n a suit and pave the way|pg||
nt|curtsolo: good thing for partnerships to discuss... when you play four suit transfers, what are your follow-ups?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: "the point is".....i am typing in the dark|pg||
mb|1N|an|Foricng|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|daveharty: this is a danger hand for EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|phil: shortness is usually what is played - perhaps not well discussed by EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daveharty: if they pick this hand to press, it could turn out badly indeed|pg||
nt|curtsolo: similar to earlier hand, but this time E is unpassed... 3@d can be somewhat wide-ranging|pg||

nt|curtsolo: the gallery|pg||
nt|curtsolo: and your old stomping grounds as well, Dave|pg||
nt|daveharty: no way for EW to pick up anything on this one, unless Stack opens 1C and it gets passed out, which seems unlikely|pg||
nt|daveharty: yes true Curt|pg||
nt|curtsolo: I suspect 2NT might be Stack's choice here|pg||
nt|daveharty: yes looks like a 2NT hand to me|pg||
nt|curtsolo: I cannot stomach 2@c with Qx of diamonds|pg||
nt|daveharty: a kib asks if south might pass 2NT|pg||

nt|curtsolo: with 4 points and a four card major, unlikely|pg||
nt|vugraphzqq: here we go|pg||
mb|2N|nt|curtsolo: one thing you have to keep in mind is that players in your seats in the other room are down big and will press for games|pg||

nt|curtsolo: standard Puppet Stayman sequence getting them to 4@h here|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: 3@s showing four card @h suit to get the contract right-sided|pg||
nt|sybarra2: what is Vongsvivut name,  does he have first name?|pg||
nt|daveharty: stack likes the sound of hearts|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: so much for having the strong hand declare it, eh?|pg||
