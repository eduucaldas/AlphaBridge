pc|c2|nt|rmb1: South has shown some values, and North has shown a NT range (?)|pg||

nt|vugraphzpu: N said they owned 4. level! But not 5.:)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3 NT might be he only way to not get x|pg||
nt|haans: yes 1@D may be perfect opening|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: may be defense error in  spades|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like 4NT RKCB, 5@S 2A+@SQ can this be right?|pg||
nt|haans: 4NT quant say many advanced playes|pg||
nt|bvdahl: looks like 2 + 2 + 3 + 1|pg||
nt|bvdahl: can there be some endplay in spades/diamonds against north for 9?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rmb1: So do I but what is 5@S|pg||

pc|d6|nt|haans: @D8 and you are off|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|blum1956: A huge gain while playing MP's|pg||
nt|blum1956: E should be satisfied with 12 tricks therefore he gets 13|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer will cash 4 @H and 4@D and South will have to establish @C5 or unguard @SK.  Declarer will just cash his winners for +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Something got wrong, dev took his trx in d odd h and at table in tr 12 had s4 to the king |pg||
nt|haans: is he claiming now?|pg||

nt|vugraphzpu: to meet! Jonny had wery good results from this year Festival at Lillehammer and among other has been winner tow years on row in Fredrikstad-tourneys together with Arve Farstad!|pg||
nt|haans: kibs say no slam I stabnd corrected|pg||
nt|rmb1: More example of 4-4 fit at the six level being better than 6-4.  As in the infamous Springold 0346 hand|pg||

pc|c5|pc|d9|pg||

nt|rmb1: If East resisted doubling and West lead a major that would be -400|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bvdahl: yes, but normal contract and probably normal lead|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|haans: not all will lead @H|pg||
pc|s9|nt|blum1956: E's double of 3NT looks too ambitious. If 3NT goes down the score should be perfect even undoubled.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|frankaus: lots of gr8 bridge - hope we see more |pg||
nt|blum1956: sometimes one doubles in such a position in order to make S run to 4@c while 3NT making. From E's point of view this time it should hardly be the case|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Knut Molander- Geir Andersen are probable the very best pair from our district today. Both have good results, Knut has been norw champ as senior several times. |pg||

nt|blum1956: You need to guess clubs if you bid 6@c|pg||
nt|haans: Michael weak or strong|pg||
nt|haans: Results: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1049f100828 |pg||
nt|haans: Top score is 140 in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Let us recall the board where EW made 6NT with an overtrick. There exists a good method to show the spade support and FG values after 2@c Stayman and 2@s responce. You just bid 3@h|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bvdahl: EW might have the highest contract in 2 spades|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: weak spade a killer|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Opps nr 8 now, NS leder pair|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bvdahl: only 110 I think NS with club lead|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|haans: Lunum not happy but good score|pg||
nt|haans: yep clubs lead the worse|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpu: 4 col forcing|pg||
nt|blum1956: Not easy to check for a @cQ using RKCB. Other method needed|pg||
nt|haans: EWE does not have 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or 3@C repeat Stayman |pg||
mb|3H|nt|blum1956: What kind of NT range do all these people have?|pg||
nt|haans: Repeat Stayman normal in Norway|pg||
nt|haans: mostly 15-17 or Big Clubs then 14-16|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but difficult to find now|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I would bid 3 h's on Norths hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpu: bt pairs ab -16 last rnd!|pg||
nt|frankaus: i have a view about 5 minor contracts at pairs...................... its like kissing ur own sister,.............. even if its right its hard to get excited by ur prospects|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: most will bid 4@H -1 but 2@D?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|blum1956: Why not 1NT then?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like a weak/mini opening NT and 1@C includes balanced 15+|pg||
nt|haans: some play it weaker|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|blum1956: I would risked 6@c havin S's hand|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||

pc|c7|nt|haans: weak nt standard in Denmark and south sweden |pg||
nt|bvdahl: now there is a chance to find the hearts|pg||
nt|haans: how to handle @H|pg||
nt|haans: must enter his hand for @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: NS har a fair lead now|pg||
nt|bvdahl: fairly safe 9 by rising to ace of hearts|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|frankaus: well done|pg||

nt|haans: 110 may be a TOP|pg||
nt|haans: yes but 100 better :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Sry no TL internet conn , so results are available first after finishing sessions|pg||
nt|haans: 110|pg||
pc|s7|nt|blum1956: will S believe the @c10 is a honest card?|pg||
nt|frankaus: is this a real restricted choice ??|pg||
nt|rmb1: No.  I think it would be right to play @C10 from 10x, so parnter can score his potential Q|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rmb1: @SJ was a good try (worth thinking about) but the spade pips are good enough for declarer|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: @SJ psyching play|pg||
pc|h4|nt|blum1956: Clearly he may deduce the @c10 is not a singleton as the defence should set the contract by the @sK in the 2nd trick. But it may be doubleton|pg||
nt|frankaus: at this level @Ct is mandatory|pg||
nt|frankaus: from Tx|pg||

nt|bvdahl: would be a good hand to play walsh. Then S could re bid 1 NT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|frankaus: 1H 4 me  -i never open weak with 2 aces|pg||
nt|bvdahl: in walsh 1D denies 4 card major if not strong enough to fore to game later|pg||
nt|bvdahl: force|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so with 12-14 and 4 card major, opener can re-bid 1 NT|pg||
