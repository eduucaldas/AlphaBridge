nt|garnetts: seems to be taking for ever --must be a technical problem I suppose|pg||
mb|1D|nt|coolvijay: JM has been playing with Ashok quite regularly prior to his joining Texanaces|pg||
nt|panja: 1@D promises a 4-card Major here|pg||
nt|panja: so E has bid 1@D because of his 4@H, not to show his long @D|pg||
nt|panja: ideally, he should have opened 2@D here to show Diamonds..|pg||
nt|arunbapat: may be they are not playing Demicoma or this may be the variation Panja|pg||
nt|panja: E had cannot see any advantage in playing in @H in preference to @D|pg||
nt|panja: well, with this hand, the opening is a matter of choice....|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: waiting for satya to bid|pg||
nt|panja: no alert on 1@D Mahesh?|pg||

nt|garnetts: I know that in France they employ a short club and rebid majors--but I agree with Mike it is dreadful--must show 5-4 in my view when you bid two suits|pg||
nt|garnetts: Bteer to rebid 1NT and employ checkback|pg||
nt|garnetts: better I mean |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there was some debate about this recently - two vociferous (and diametric) points of view|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|pelu: looking at EW-card I would like - @D3-3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a very good slam on a non-trump lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: u need dia 3-3 if defense plays trumps early|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then you can ruff 2 diamonds if they are 4-2|pg||
nt|ritong: mm|pg||
nt|pelu: let see in 2. segment Hooda bid and won on 2 against odds slams, so..?|pg||
nt|khaled_m: yes if @D 33 or North has 2 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: sorry, I saw a bigger club than the deuce in dummy|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Should have been the 9|pg||

nt|ritong: yes, the small trump in dummy is really small|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|khaled_m: does 2NT desscribe the hand properly or should he have bid 3@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: 2@H is only forcing for 1 round, so 3@C is also a bid|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|khaled_m: may duck a diamond for 11 tricks |pg||

nt|panja: 3@C shows @D suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|vugraph814: le principe : tout le monde se compare aux champions de notre salle|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D asks for short suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: @H is that short suit|pg||
mb|3C|nt|panja: 3Nt not the best bid..|pg||
nt|panja: 3@S natural would have been fine...but now Thakral is likely to bid 4@D..|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|panja: this will survive because W's Clubs are good|pg||
nt|panja: but it is definitely not the best spot..|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: the other semi is between Formidables and Hooda|pg||
nt|arunbapat: system Fix|pg||
nt|panja: no, nothing to do with system..|pg||
nt|panja: there were three mistakes here...1. W should not bid 3@D with only 1 Diamond|pg||
nt|panja: secondly, W should bid 3@S to get the 5-3 @S fit...either on 3@C or on 3@H|pg||
nt|arunbapat: holding AKJ in short suit of P 3NT is appealing..so he can not try 3S even if he want to else auction will cross 3nt if P has no S fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Duck a !"C into S here|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A @D-lead would have made this board INTERESTING|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW can make 6@C on this layout, but it's a bit lucky|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: indeed - like any ggod pd lead his suit...|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@C makes on any lead --but lucky needs 3-3 @D's |pg||
pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  Can only make by "C-finesse then|pg||
nt|arunbapat: he will survive this due to S position|pg||

nt|sharkey: at this level shud be routine|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have to say I feel uncomfortable  about 3@C ---never shown a @D suit|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|hawe45:  Not after 4 @D-tricks to N/S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No routine at all|pg||
nt|sharkey: Sry Hans - Im looking at the actual hand  with @D lead need a peek to take the finesse|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any opinion as to whether the West hand is worth a 2@D rebid?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not having a club lead only makes a little difference to 6@C as when @D are 4-2 they make you ruff the first one with the Q@C |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|sunsamvar: did Keyzad give count in @H?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|garnetts: I think 2@D is just about OK because we have a really good club suit|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Most of us would settle for 3NT|pg||
nt|ritong: a 1NT rebid by west can avoid problems|pg||
nt|psridhar: bidding over 4th suit confusion|pg||
nt|psridhar: E believed shape was priority but W didnt agree|pg||
nt|khaled_m: why not 2NT instead of 2@H (other room)|pg||
nt|ritong: admittedly, it can bury a possible @c fit|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|Walddk2: West has a normal 2NT now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't see the problem|pg||
nt|psridhar: the fall of h10 in 2 rds will help make 3nt|pg||
nt|ritong: completely clearcut imo|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: I have 5 hearts and 4 clubs, partner, and I also have a diamond stopper|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: How can you describe that better?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ritong: of course, one can prefer let pard declare, but it leads to dangerous distorsions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S is confusing, as is 2@H in the other room|pg||
nt|pelu: bridge is an easy game - just bid what u have and dont invent strange bids :):)|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 2s was not any more meritorious than the 2h in other room but they hv landed on their feet|pg||
nt|ritong: for strange reasons|pg||
nt|khaled_m: for some 2@S shows doubleton spade minimum or 3 spades with extras|pg||
nt|khaled_m: now over 2NT 3@S would show 5431 with extras|pg||
nt|ritong: doubleton @s mini and no @d stopper, naturally|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If only 2 it denies a diamond stopper in my view|pg||
nt|khaled_m: with 5431 minimum spades would be raised first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bridge is a difficult game, why make it more complicated than necessary?|pg||
nt|psridhar: semi finals of a major tourney and pairs have diff opinion on bidding over 4th suit auction !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, so let me ask this question: what would 2NT show?|pg||
nt|khaled_m: yes  i also dont agree with this bidding. was OK with doubleton @SK and no @D stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If partner is interested in my doubleton spade, he can bid 3@S next|pg||
nt|khaled_m: maybe singleton spade with D stopper|pg||
nt|psridhar: in my view 4th suit stresses on shape and stopper in 4th suit -a bid of 3d ( raising 4th suit) shd be = no descriptive bid avlble for me |pg||
mb|p|pc|dT|nt|ritong: overhere it shows extras and something like @dHxx|pg||
nt|psridhar: for eg 4th suit shd not be construed as asking for range of opener's hand|pg||
nt|ritong: necessary to do so, since 2@c is relatively nebulous|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ritong: so, opener s main preoccupation should be to " zone" his hand as accurately as possible with his third bid|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Director was called|pg||
nt|sharkey: From East's 3@C bid apparent he can't have @C & @S|pg||
nt|peachy: good play, to deny multiple entries to board|pg||
nt|garnetts: Give South the 10@H and 3NT becomes a real struggle|pg||

mb|4S|nt|sharkey: Thin 3@H shows 5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe West might have bid 2NT instead of 2@H, as he did have a diamond stop, even though it was anti-positional|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, after bididng the 4th suit, 3NT would have shown the East hand quite well. Very difficult, in other words |pg||
nt|garnetts: True Mike but 2@H is a utility bid in my view--if not then 2@S was the better rebid--that is very likely to be a doubleton|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 4@S EW here|pg||

nt|othered1: I play lots of weak NT openings, but have had no luck at all with 1N on this.|pg||
mb|3D|an|to play|nt|sharkey: Not many IMPs being exchanged here - either dull hands, good bridge or combination ot the two....|pg||
