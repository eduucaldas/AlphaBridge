mc|12|nt|twcho: the session score is 44:65|pg||
nt|twcho: this reflects the unpredictability of bridge|pg||
nt|twcho: Operator, many kibitzers asked how the 4@h can be made|pg||
nt|twcho: Would you please look it up for us?|pg||
nt|twcho: actually the lead is in some sense lucky for north in the last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: the hand should be lose 1@c , 1@d and 1@h|pg||
nt|twcho: his @s9 lead has given an extra entry to dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: so that there is a mistick on my operating |pg||
nt|twcho: but they have won @sA first|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: yes, lose 1@s instead of losing 1@c|pg||
nt|twcho: OK, operator has confirmed with the players that 4@h was actually made for bd 31 though the process is still a mystery for us|pg||
nt|twcho: The last segment will start in 1 hour time|pg||
nt|twcho: but not sure whether they will start it up earlier as this session has ended much ahead of the time allocated to it|pg||
nt|twcho: bye now|pg||
