nt|iceking: can he really pass |pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Maas is asking about the agreements, with which hands could north have 4 hearts?|pg||
nt|iceking: W isnt a passed hand could have some values |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: in my opinion yes. E cannot see any defence against a higher @c contract|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: I am told this is first time they have played,  so I am sure difficult |pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: maybe Bas thinks that 4D shows hearts|pg||

nt|vugraphzqh: all the alerts are guesses by me|pg||

nt|sybarra: just shooting it out which is extremely dangerous in this format |pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Bas certainly thought about it|pg||
nt|sybarra: it was clear he did consider it |pg||
nt|iceking: both S opened 1nt rather interesting|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s has taken a fairly solid 2nd place|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzqh: must admit I would open 1NT as well without thinking much about it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzqh: I wonder what options north has|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|iceking: hand was ntish alot of tens and 9s|pg||

nt|ralfwil: do you like this kind of nt-openings Magnus? I don´t|pg||
mb|3C|an|alerted|nt|iceking: not my style |pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont like the patter for 1 nt |pg||

mb|3D|an|alerted|nt|sybarra: with 1nt|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: If you succed it´s OK but when it´s wrong you can be blamed|pg||
nt|iceking: with 5422 hands i do if its 2-4-5-2, 2-4-2-5 shape hard hands to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: sorry that was after 3 rounds,  just the opposit after 4 rounds|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Magnus,  and sometimes just have to "hope for the best"  whatever you do |pg||
nt|iceking: rather dull hand here 9 top tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Brink has shown 2254 distribution and North only asked|pg||
nt|iceking: and on heart lead that should be it|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|xenya: some might open 1N as W -- would have worked well here|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe claim now?|pg||
nt|iceking: i know i would |pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: so far most pairs have been fighting for every IMP they can get|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you mean 9 tricks? yes!|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: regarding the previous hand, if you think it is not good to open 1NT, ok fair enough|pg||
nt|iceking: i understand but at this level of bridge i always find it just little bid insulting play hands like these |pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: but not opening 1NT because you can be blamed for it seems really badd avice|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: advice rather|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s2|pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||

pc|s9|pc|d7|nt|xenya: but the cards are very friendly for EW, so 2N should also make|pg||

nt|iceking: these NS are very tuff without a doubt one of best pairs in the world |pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Excellent 6@S now|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@s is certainly reasonable|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|joest: on this layout you might need mirrors to make it|pg||
nt|henryb:  too good for Roland, who would want to be in 7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I changed my approach and came up with Roland's Rule|pg||
nt|henryb:  Yes?|pg||
nt|blum1956: not that easy to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "Only bid the slams that make and remember to pick the right strain"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Feel free to add it to your CC|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think that Bob Hamman got to that one first|pg||
nt|blum1956: spades 4-1 and the @cJ fourth|pg||
nt|joest: Roland I believe you should also add "and ask the opponents to put their cards face up on the table"|pg||
nt|joest: that will permit you to hook the club ten on this board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is routine play|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: if you have the hand records|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Or if you are Deep Finesse|pg||
mb|2N!|an|short or long !cs|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3S|an|4342|mb|p|nt|joest: I think you can make it without hooking the club but it is also some 'good card reading'|pg||
nt|henryb:  Meanwhile E-W are busy relaying|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|henryb:  The yellow outlines on bids mean that the bid was alerted at the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are grey in the Win version|pg||
nt|joest: henry has long marched to his own drummer Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@S will take even longer to play than to bid|pg||
nt|joest: as has been pointed out to me, with hearts 33 you will make it on most normal lines|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Remember that West will be declarer here. How do you play on a diamond lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  and it becomes trivial after N leads the @dQ, as you pitch one of the @h losers immediately, the other later on the @dK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzqg: E said W showed 8-9PC|pg||
nt|blum1956: but declarer may try something in order not to depend on guessing the @sQ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can even make it if you ruff but it will be more complicated|pg||
nt|blum1956: and he does - which probably leads to the defeat|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: So why did he not let this run, Henry?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Verhees is a strong player|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|jcwla: Seemingly if there is any chance for another pair to win this event Verhees must fail in this slam.|pg||
nt|joest: now you need to take an anti% view it seems to me|pg||
nt|henryb:  Does anyone know how far ahead they are after match 10?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 697-342|pg||
nt|joest: way way ahed|pg||

nt|jcwla: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ for standings|pg||
nt|blum1956: It seems he needs a club finesse now|pg||

nt|sybarra: I am sure it shows spades |pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: they are not a regular partnership, but they've been doing well today|pg||
mb|4D|an|splinter|nt|sybarra: most playing transfer advances |pg||
nt|iceking: and over pd 4sp sygnoff one more try maybe|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzqh: The hand is the wrong way around|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@S looks aggressive...|pg||

nt|iceking: no|pg||
nt|sybarra: same theory as transfers over nt |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: stong hand playing |pg||
nt|sybarra: or in this case.....|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks like 12 tricks are makeable in @s|pg||
nt|iceking: only 4 spades but east might try again even i dont blame his pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: with the wasted diamond king, the west hand is about a minimum response|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: or close to it at least|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzqh: it was Ton that invited|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: and Bas is complaining that he has to take all the decisions|pg||
nt|sybarra: not to worry,  do your best,  and give results |pg||
nt|iceking: its a rather good slam though i would think|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: The east hand is an absolute maximum|pg||
nt|sybarra: with the singleton or void shown in @D by E,   have to consider 4 @H maybe|pg||
nt|iceking: 4h probably LT for those guys|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4/1 @S break is a bit pesky, but the @S q falls   |pg||
nt|sybarra: LT?|pg||
nt|iceking: last train|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wonder |pg||
nt|iceking: should be at least |pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: tell him to "stop whining"  ...(just kidding) |pg||
nt|othered1: some play very sound 1N overcalls and if so I'd raise with north's hand|pg||
