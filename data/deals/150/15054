pc|dQ|nt|blum1956: E's double of 3NT looks too ambitious. If 3NT goes down the score should be perfect even undoubled.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|frankaus: lots of gr8 bridge - hope we see more |pg||
nt|blum1956: sometimes one doubles in such a position in order to make S run to 4@c while 3NT making. From E's point of view this time it should hardly be the case|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Knut Molander- Geir Andersen are probable the very best pair from our district today. Both have good results, Knut has been norw champ as senior several times. |pg||

mb|1D|nt|blum1956: Let us recall the board where EW made 6NT with an overtrick. There exists a good method to show the spade support and FG values after 2@c Stayman and 2@s responce. You just bid 3@h|pg||
mb|d|mb|1H|nt|haans: weak spade a killer|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Opps nr 8 now, NS leder pair|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|haans: Lunum not happy but good score|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzpu: 4 col forcing|pg||
nt|blum1956: Not easy to check for a @cQ using RKCB. Other method needed|pg||
nt|haans: EWE does not have 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or 3@C repeat Stayman |pg||
mb|2D|nt|blum1956: What kind of NT range do all these people have?|pg||
nt|haans: Repeat Stayman normal in Norway|pg||
nt|haans: mostly 15-17 or Big Clubs then 14-16|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpu: bt pairs ab -16 last rnd!|pg||
nt|frankaus: i have a view about 5 minor contracts at pairs...................... its like kissing ur own sister,.............. even if its right its hard to get excited by ur prospects|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: most will bid 4@H -1 but 2@D?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|blum1956: Why not 1NT then?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like a weak/mini opening NT and 1@C includes balanced 15+|pg||

nt|vugraphzpu: Sry no TL internet conn , so results are available first after finishing sessions|pg||
nt|haans: 110|pg||
pc|d5|nt|blum1956: will S believe the @c10 is a honest card?|pg||
nt|frankaus: is this a real restricted choice ??|pg||
nt|rmb1: No.  I think it would be right to play @C10 from 10x, so parnter can score his potential Q|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rmb1: @SJ was a good try (worth thinking about) but the spade pips are good enough for declarer|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: @SJ psyching play|pg||
pc|d4|nt|blum1956: Clearly he may deduce the @c10 is not a singleton as the defence should set the contract by the @sK in the 2nd trick. But it may be doubleton|pg||
nt|frankaus: at this level @Ct is mandatory|pg||
nt|frankaus: from Tx|pg||
