nt|daveharty: if nothing good happens soon for EW, they may start swinging for the fences|pg||
nt|curtsolo: both pairs in the closed room playing 2/1 with strong NT|pg||
nt|curtsolo: in the closed room are Steve Stewart/Paul Pressly sitting EW for Kansas City; Mark Ehret and Lee Hastings NS for StL|pg||
nt|daveharty: lots of tricks in a diamond contract here for EW, if they can get into the auction|pg||
mb|1C|nt|curtsolo: Stack should open 1NT here, which might make that @d partial tough to find|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|georgia19: Good Morning everyone, no doubt some more fine bridge for us...|pg||
mb|d|nt|curtsolo: you guys doubling back in with E hand here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daveharty: no transfer, so it will be up to E to balance...tough|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|phil: well not now LOL|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: ah, immediate penalty raise from Stack... that's one way to keep those @d out of the auction :)|pg||

nt|daveharty: he has about the best possible hand though|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: hi Georgia, everyone :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|georgia19: Good Morning all, wow, swift bidding here|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: 4D was explained as a slam try in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Georgia, Gerben and Han|pg||
nt|georgia19: sensible contract for NS, no doubt W considering 2@s which would have been close|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: some comments on the quality of this dummy|pg||
nt|shevek: not a "classic" opening :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|curtsolo: looks like making the contract demands picking up the @hQ|pg||
nt|phil: with those spades, I honestly wouldnt raise - thats what you want to block out with the raise|pg||
nt|curtsolo: any reason Eakes should find the Q here?|pg||
nt|georgia19: Thanks, Han, well, it's a better spot than 6@s - just:)|pg||

nt|Gerben42: 4 juniors at the table here|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/  for standings after 48 of 88 boards|pg||
pc|c6|nt|daveharty: well that wasn't the killing defense|pg||
nt|Gerben42: discard problems for Hop here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Format is Cross IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators are Nicoleta Giura and Georgia Ray|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|curtsolo: well, if the @d switch was, in fact, ducked here... she doesn't need to|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|h7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|georgia19: well he can lose his diamonds for a start then he's discarding after dummy|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|cA|pc|s6|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzqh: At this point Schollaardt has about a complete count of the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: if he plays a diamond to the jack|pg||
nt|georgia19: so, 3rd plays 9th on current standings|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: east will win and give west a trump promotion by leading a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: but declarer can make +1 if he leads the diamond 8 and runs it|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: playing west for the 9|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|dT|nt|georgia19: next board:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: I think he will|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: it's cross imps, so this doesn't matter much|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: but he's clearly playing for every trick|pg||
nt|georgia19: the standard of play here is just tremendous, a great lesson in concentration and deduction for any aspiring player|pg||

nt|curtsolo: they should be playing 16 boards|pg||
nt|phil: how many so far? |pg||
nt|daveharty: so there is some systemic swing potential|pg||
nt|curtsolo: I like to say that whenever partner gives you an unnecessary raise, it's a compliment to your ability to play the dummy... right?|pg||
nt|daveharty: not the start EW were hoping for|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to P Sridhar (PS)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: the scoring is cross imps|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all thx Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6 tables in play|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 12 of the strongest pairs in the country playing here|pg||
nt|psridhar: is South Bas Drijver ?|pg||
nt|georgia19: yes, perhaps the light opening is best|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Gerben42: Bob Drijver|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bob|pg||
nt|Walddk4: brother|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Bas is playing at another table|pg||
nt|georgia19: that may be a lesson for having only 6 clubs, - and 4spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|daveharty: sometimes hard to shake off a defensive error and concentrate on the task at hand|pg||
nt|curtsolo: EW will not only need swings, but they really can't even afford the nickels and dimes of overberries on those partscores|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Gerben42: Bas playing with Sjoert Brink|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: actually, Bas is playing with Ton Bakkeren today|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: but tomorrow with Sjoert|pg||
nt|Gerben42: okay |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: pickup chance for StL on this deal|pg||
nt|daveharty: game missed in the other room, so a swing is there for EW if they can find it|pg||
nt|curtsolo: they will have to bid a game, because they won't be interested in defending 2@d here|pg||
nt|psridhar: very aggressive auction by EW -wd|pg||
nt|georgia19: 4@h has a shout here, but not expecting them to get there|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Brink thinking, can he really bid more with this hand?|pg||
nt|georgia19: hes hasn't shown his best feature yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: i like this 3@C better than the prev. one, better suit|pg||
nt|georgia19: 3 losers in 5@s, too much to commit to|pg||
nt|Gerben42: before it looked like A23456|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: it does pay to mix your preempts sure-only u need pd to stay with you on fig out which|pg||
nt|georgia19: yes, agree Gerben|pg||
nt|Gerben42: a tough decision for Tim Verbeek at red vs white|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Gerben42: 5@C is 300|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Drijver was wishing Brink would bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: he has a great hand|pg||
nt|georgia19: no doubt Brink unable to bid 2@c with this great suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Drijver asks for leads: low from odd to an honor or even without an honor|pg||
pc|cA|nt|phil: they might have defended 1N xx'd there for a moment|pg||
nt|daveharty: possibly stack's pass asked for redouble, as an escape mechanism?|pg||
nt|curtsolo: not sure what their runout method is... Stack has the worst possible hand for running out|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Gerben42: or maybe 500|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|phil: the double is odd|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|georgia19: they got there in the open room as E rebid 3@h|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|Gerben42: from his point of view|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|daveharty: well done by EW|pg||
pc|hK|nt|curtsolo: the weak NT appears to have actually helped EW on this deal|pg||
nt|daveharty: a nonvulnerable game swing, but it is a start|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|Gerben42: but 650 vs 300 is still a lot|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra2: every little bit helps |pg||
nt|Gerben42: but so is -100...|pg||
nt|georgia19: sometimes you just have to stay fixed and take what money there is|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes - better to take money in 5c ; bid 5s when there is bright chance of slam|pg||
nt|georgia19: or even vul game...|pg||

nt|curtsolo: red card hits the table|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c8|nt|daveharty: true curt|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|daveharty: but weak NT devotees are convinced that the good results outweigh the bad|pg||

nt|vugraphzqh: Schollaardt comments he should have played clubs when in with the diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: to put Drijver to the guess early|pg||
mb|p|nt|daveharty: not my personal favorite when the six card suit is that good|pg||
nt|phil: I like it only because the black Queens should be devalued|pg||
mb|p|nt|curtsolo: Phil makes a good point... if you are confident with how you play the hands, all the more reason to stay WITH the field at matchpoints|pg||

mb|2H|nt|curtsolo: show the 6th spade?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: perhaps, but 1@S could be 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|curtsolo: West's @h preference could be on 2-2 in the majors|pg||
nt|Gerben42: and its a quacky hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: you wouldnt want opponents to miss 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: 2NT would have been a bad hand, answered after question by Bob|pg||
nt|georgia19: another awkward misfitting hand, but 3NT should be fime|pg||
mb|3C|an|forcing|nt|psridhar: key point of the auction was the X of 1S on an ace only-but thats enuf for 3nt wd|pg||

nt|Gerben42: deadly effective bidding|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: I'll refrain going off on Capp - haven't had enough wine yet|pg||
nt|georgia19: even fine - 9 top tricks and chances for extras|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: The diamonds block.. NS can't pick up 4 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: While Wortel is thinking, the rest is discussion her strange pass in third seat, white against red|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: She must be 4333 with a few honors, they claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: right they are!!|pg||
nt|georgia19: I wonder what N will lead, something passive? a major?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra2: so was 2 @D capp?|pg||
nt|georgia19: why is it a strange pass, what could she possibly open? |pg||
nt|shevek: NS ventured into the auction in the other room...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: if Drijver plays ace and another club, he has to guess whether to play south for K10 or J10|pg||
nt|shevek: not cheap|pg||
nt|georgia19: and look what it cost:)|pg||
nt|georgia19: bricks and straw come to mind......|pg||

nt|georgia19: I am right there with very light 3rd seat openings, especially for the lead, but with nothing sensible to say it is just madness|pg||

nt|curtsolo: the other flights should be in their final quarters... maybe we can get some results as those come in|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: no explanations|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: but let me look up their system|pg||
mb|3S|an|alerted as well|nt|phil: if you play Drury, you need some some agreements on how to show clubs by a passed hand - was 1N really forcing? |pg||
nt|shevek: best to ask at the end of the auction indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|georgia19: 6NT without a spade lead looks good, nice heart break|pg||
nt|georgia19: entries will be awkward though|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: 2S showed 5+ spades, usually a minimum|pg||
nt|shevek: Brink will lead a @s for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: 3C showed 5+ spades and 4+ clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: so pretty natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: oh wait, it could have been 4 @d as well|pg||
nt|georgia19: maybe they'll give up on slam and settle for 3NT/4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: but 3@s showed 6-4 in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|shevek: probably alertable for what the bids deny, rather than show|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|georgia19: maybe I'll take up betting:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: 3NT looks like a good stop, useful that Wortel could immediately show a minimum|pg||
pc|h7|nt|curtsolo: may have been semi-forcing here, a common passed hand treatment|pg||
nt|daveharty: west has to be thrilled with this dummy|pg||
nt|daveharty: QTx is a great catch|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|psridhar: needs to ruff a dia high in dummy and make|pg||
nt|georgia19: or pitch a losing spade...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if a @C return declarer is forced to make it|pg||
nt|georgia19: I can't see how he can go off from here|pg||
nt|georgia19: whatever the return|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|curtsolo: so they land in a good spot, but EW know this deal is not going to aid the comeback|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|georgia19: but he'll be worried about the trump break|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||

pc|d9|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|daveharty: yes there are only 12 boards to go, and EW know they haven't made major gains yet|pg||
pc|h9|nt|phil: well, making up 70 IMPs in 16 boards is about a .......1 in 40 proposition? worse? |pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes but can worry about it more if @D comes back|pg||
pc|h2|nt|georgia19: claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Jacco has to decide how to play hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: he doesn't know all options are winning|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: inquiring about discards|pg||
nt|shevek: against slam though, Brink might have chosen the attacking lead of a @s|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|s3|nt|Gerben42: wow|pg||

pc|h8|nt|curtsolo: unless your name is Meckstroth or Rodwell :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|daveharty: flight C is a final, flight B after 3/4|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with @S stop?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Bob alerts 2NT as min with spade stop, no reaction from Tim of course|pg||
nt|psridhar: with AQXX E wont be fooled by that stopper showing 2nt !|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: over the past decade, KC has almost completely dominated the Flight A portion of this event... B/C/D have shown mixed results with overall slight edge to KC|pg||
nt|daveharty: disciplined pass by E|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: 2NT goes down but EW can do much better|pg||
nt|Gerben42: probably P = min without, XX max without|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Gerben42: prediction: this wont make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|georgia19: these colse contracts are never easy to play, there's the club finesse and the kind spade position will make 9 tricks easy before they get their @d tricks going|pg||
nt|georgia19: close|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psridhar: they will get only one more chance now|pg||

pc|sT|nt|georgia19: but E/W have had misinformation, who got it wrong?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but partner must have @SK for the X|pg||
pc|s5|nt|curtsolo: so in the first 5 boards, NS have had 4 weak NT openings|pg||

nt|shevek: results updated now:  http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: declarer is cold now I think, it seems an unlikely diamond lead from  KJx was needed to beat 3NT|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psridhar: Tim has decided to settle for 7 tricks now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: must let go of the @H in East|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: not clear if EW got misinformation, my guess is that N misbid, which is entirely legal|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes i guess so - i would understand 2N as stopper also|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|daveharty: especially if you include 11 pt hands, as Stack and Eakes apparently do|pg||
nt|curtsolo: if you open NT with 6322 and 5422 it comes up even more often :)|pg||
nt|phil: heh|pg||
nt|georgia19: 10 tricks if @d held up|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|shevek: another accident at the other table in bd 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: EW play 2/4 leads through declarer, common among Dutch top players|pg||
nt|georgia19: no sorry just the 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: but here he might have played the 10 for other reasons, for example if declarer had Kxx|pg||
nt|georgia19: had to take 2nd|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: he couldn't afford to play  low as Schollaardt could then duck the lead into the west hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Schollaardt might regret playing the queen of hearts at trick 1 |pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: the lead was attitude ("kleintje plaatje") so declarer knew west had the @hJ|pg||
nt|georgia19: he could have played 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: now he doesn't have two entries to dummy, if he leads a small one, west might play the jack!!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzqh: he has to commit at this point, if he chooses to pitch a spade, he goes down if E has the club king|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: while he could then make if spades are 3-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: I think EW both signalled honest count in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: but declarer doesn't know that and these opponents are certainly capable of both falsecarding|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d5|nt|Gerben42: still TD will be called if this makes|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: west might see this as an opportunity|pg||

nt|phil: West|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: on a hook and a little more|pg||
nt|Gerben42: min @S|pg||
nt|Gerben42: in NL almost always 3@D is min @S and 3@H is max @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: but in cross imps I would never say never|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: and Jansma Verhees were doing ok|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzqh: interesting that NS play 2NT shows hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: of course, hearts and a minor is twice as common as minors|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: and it's important to show hearts because you might have a 4H game sometimes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|curtsolo: awfully prime cards for E - would you consider opening 1@c and jump rebidding 2NT on a hand like that?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|daveharty: i doubt west will push on|pg||
nt|phil: I wouldnt|pg||
nt|sybarra2: treatments vary as to whether 3 @C= good clubs or the relay suit would shows good clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wouldnt consider it at all., would just do it|pg||
nt|phil: nice controls, but theres no intermediates|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: 3H and 3NT are not allerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: I don't have this agreement but I sure like it|pg||
nt|georgia19: I wonder what they do with the minors?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to David Stern|pg||

nt|vugraphzqh: with the minors they have to bid one of them  I think, that's the cost of this agreement|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe they bid 3@s?|pg||
nt|georgia19: morning David - at least it's morning here...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: well, usually they won't want to commit to the 4-level|pg||
nt|shevek: hi David :)|pg||

nt|curtsolo: 3@d here by Arba apparently a cue, but many players show shortness at that point|pg||
nt|daveharty: right phil, plus there's the very likely possibility that partner responds in a major...what then?|pg||
nt|phil: however, if you are looking for a swing, you might get one if the auction starts 1@c - 1M - 3M, and the contract gets played by W|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: E can be 17-19 when balanced, 1NT would be 14-16|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/  scores and standings will appear there eventually, hopefully after each round of 8 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Jansma-Paulissen are defending champions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: well 24 HCP and East has a good hand with controls|pg||
nt|davidstern: That lead wont figure in Bas' worst nightmare that's for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: if Bas reads this as a singleton, he will know Wortel is 5-6|pg||
nt|georgia19: just not biddable|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: and might play a spade to the 10?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: or at least, he might if he was in slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: in game it may be a needless risk|pg||
nt|davidstern: No real need to Unless North 0-5-2-6 in which case would need to find the @DK|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: at different colors, Drijver would probably double 2NT to see if they could get a juicy penalty|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Gerben42: good contract|pg||
nt|georgia19: a couple of options, clubs set up for a discard and can only play diamonds A and another|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @C set up with 4-2?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: at the score, i view intermediates as the bandido chief viewed badges in the tresaure of the sierra madre|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the ppomt ios, if you need a swing it would come at a suit contract. E has more than a 1N opener if the ultimate denomination is a suit. intyermediates are more important for NT ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam, but that is usel;ess for swing purposes. at the score, assume any swing will be i n a suit and pave the way|pg||
nt|curtsolo: good thing for partnerships to discuss... when you play four suit transfers, what are your follow-ups?|pg||
nt|georgia19: nice careful play, exploring all options:)|pg||

mb|d|nt|phil: shortness is usually what is played - perhaps not well discussed by EW|pg||
nt|georgia19: is it standard?|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzqh: well|pg||
nt|Gerben42: after the NZ national team player Lionel Wright, who unfortunately died a few years ago |pg||
nt|georgia19: he'll be pleased when he gets back|pg||
mb|p|nt|daveharty: if they pick this hand to press, it could turn out badly indeed|pg||
nt|curtsolo: similar to earlier hand, but this time E is unpassed... 3@d can be somewhat wide-ranging|pg||
nt|Gerben42: http://www.ebu.co.uk/general/biographies/obituaries/lionelwright.htm|pg||
nt|georgia19: Yes, I remember him, but not his system|pg||
nt|psridhar: why wd Drijver pass 2S X at imps with a 5 card suit?|pg||

mb|2H|nt|daveharty: south is probably liking this|pg||

pc|d4|nt|vugraphzqh: the best play in the suit is low to the king, and then low to the queen|pg||

nt|curtsolo: Linda did not have the world's best collection from which to lead|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: but then, just as now, declarer chose to play differently because of other concerns|pg||
nt|georgia19: he could have crossed to dummy to play 2nd heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: he might want to use those entries to take two finesses in clubs for example|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: right now he only has two entries, and he wants to use both to finesse in clubs|pg||
nt|georgia19: you shudda given him a nudge, Han:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzqh: I wish I could Georgia|pg||
pc|h7|nt|psridhar: Tim expects 4 card spd in pd's hand i guess thats why he is playing trumps|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|phil: ok dinner's on - enjoy all|pg||
nt|georgia19: you mean you have a fave pair?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|davidstern: That could lead to -1 if South had AJx hearts and one club honour and spades didnt break|pg||
pc|dT|nt|curtsolo: thanks Phil|pg||
nt|daveharty: thx phil|pg||
nt|davidstern: And the foresight to duck the heart|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h9|pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|georgia19: it's really hard to commentate whilst trying NOT to see what we can see. I've often tried watching just one player when browsing, so much better to get into their heads|pg||

nt|daveharty: East probably feels pretty good about this result, but no luck for them there|pg||
nt|curtsolo: when you are down big in a match and there are no pickup opportunities, I find it very hard to stay focused|pg||
nt|daveharty: here's an interesting hand|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: semiforcing in @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|curtsolo: there is temptation to try and create action... but you have to remember that you have teammates, and you should play as if you trust them fully|pg||
mb|p|nt|curtsolo: (whether you really do or not... lol)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but opps in the way again|pg||
nt|Gerben42: would YOU be on the same page about the meaning of X here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: with both red suits being guarded here with S, EW will end making the grand if they stumble into it|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: this is not semi-forcing Gerben :)|pg||
nt|georgia19: my brilliant husband has instantly seen a double red squeeze for 7@c/7NT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daveharty: suprised NS were allowed to played undoubled at the other table|pg||
nt|shevek: on a good day this might have worked...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|georgia19: Last night I was watching a match and one commentator always expected the players to do what would work, the others were screaming the odds at him and telling what the player would ...|pg||
nt|georgia19: actually do, just a bit like the heart situation on the last hand|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|curtsolo: yes, that is a surprise|pg||
nt|daveharty: NS need to find the club ruff to beat this I think|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|daveharty: well that should do it!  :)|pg||
nt|curtsolo: this will get wrapped up quickly at down one|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|vugraphzqh: explained that E either is strong with diamonds, or 24-25 NT|pg||
nt|davidstern: In the OR West opened 1NT and East simply transferred to 3@C and passed it out. My view is that if 3@C is better than 1NT then 3NT is probably worth a shot. No doubt East was ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: looking for a super-accept|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: if declarer ducks twice, north can switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: and still set the contract|pg||
nt|davidstern: If this heart gets ducked a diamond switch is essential|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: she knows there is no future in hearts|pg||
nt|davidstern: Else declarer will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: the heart 2 shows he has an even number left|pg||
nt|davidstern: Indeed no future in hearts but does anything else look attractive|pg||
nt|georgia19: what did the 9 say?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Sjoert thinking and asking about their count, she'll know the heart position for sure|pg||
nt|davidstern: Clearly spade is no good and club unnecessary so if he does switch it is likely to be a diamond but is it really that cleaer to switch|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Gerben42: for some interpretations of NT, he is|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|davidstern: There you go|pg||
pc|c5|nt|shevek: maybe it is a good day :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|georgia19: yes, I know many of the kibs had seen it too, it was the speed that impressed me...|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|sybarra2: should cash ace of spades first |pg||
nt|davidstern: Still needs diamond onside for ninth trick or spade finesse of course but knows diamond is right|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, but south is to play ...|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|sybarra2: will done|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||

pc|c7|pc|d8|pc|s5|nt|Gerben42: for those who have not seen it: North holds @S, South @H, so in the end, the 3rd @D will be promoted|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: time pressure, E didn't try to make 7|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes - besides long tournament|pg||
nt|Gerben42: dont waste too much on making +1|pg||
nt|georgia19: I think it is a very impressive standard overall|pg||
nt|Gerben42: we are waiting for the round change now - 11 rounds of 8 boards over 2 days|pg||
pc|c8|nt|shevek: Brink notices south is inconvenienced|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: declarer will play south for the diamond ace and pitch his two spades|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c9|pc|dT|nt|georgia19: but is he? surely he cannot think of dumping a spade?|pg||

mc|9|nt|davidstern: No crucial momentas South would have played a diamond if he didnt have the ace for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: @h9 was count, so probably @h2 was suit preference|pg||
