nt|psridhar: it also avoids the 4th suit auction which is cumbersome to an immd 2/1 gf|pg||

nt|vugraphzqe: other s/f Texan Aces up by 30 imps|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mcarroll: The West hand is an advertisement for having a bid to show a one-suiter over 1NT, as you can always rely on pd to be short in the suit you want him to lead in thi s auction|pg||

nt|arunbapat: will Satya come out to 3D I guess he will.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: with this score, EW should be taking chances, and NS, playing safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: if N leads to S, and S shifts to @D...this will go down many|pg||
pc|c5|nt|peachy: Good to see you all|pg||
pc|c2|nt|panja: but if @S are continued....it will be interesting|pg||

nt|panja: the @D shift will be difficult to find though|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: other s/f texanaces up by 19|pg||
nt|panja: the bidding does not suggest N could have 6 @D|pg||
nt|panja: so....Kiran is more likely to return a @S..??|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: waiting|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: shuffling between @s n @d|pg||

nt|panja: note how the system kept South in dark|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|peachy: This looks like Strong Club auction, surely is|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Other s/f Formidables vs Hooda|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panja: S should not have doubled, true, but having doubled, if S had a better idea of N shape, she would have found the right defence|pg||
nt|panja: deal is not over yet though....W needs to find @HA still, quite likely, he will|pg||
nt|arunbapat: I think satya should have played if safe by taking out to 3D.|pg||

nt|panja: after S plays @CK..there is little chance W will go wrong in @H|pg||

mb|2S|nt|coolvijay: JM has been playing with Ashok quite regularly prior to his joining Texanaces|pg||
nt|panja: 1@D promises a 4-card Major here|pg||
nt|panja: so E has bid 1@D because of his 4@H, not to show his long @D|pg||
nt|panja: ideally, he should have opened 2@D here to show Diamonds..|pg||
nt|arunbapat: may be they are not playing Demicoma or this may be the variation Panja|pg||
nt|panja: E had cannot see any advantage in playing in @H in preference to @D|pg||

nt|panja: no alert on 1@D Mahesh?|pg||

nt|garnetts: I know that in France they employ a short club and rebid majors--but I agree with Mike it is dreadful--must show 5-4 in my view when you bid two suits|pg||
nt|garnetts: Bteer to rebid 1NT and employ checkback|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: 3Nt not the best bid..|pg||

nt|mdgraham: and with the hearts as friendly as could be, has the merit of being cold|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzqe: play slow on this table|pg||

nt|arunbapat: system Fix|pg||
nt|panja: no, nothing to do with system..|pg||
nt|panja: there were three mistakes here...1. W should not bid 3@D with only 1 Diamond|pg||
nt|panja: secondly, W should bid 3@S to get the 5-3 @S fit...either on 3@C or on 3@H|pg||
nt|arunbapat: holding AKJ in short suit of P 3NT is appealing..so he can not try 3S even if he want to else auction will cross 3nt if P has no S fit|pg||

pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: any opinion as to whether the West hand is worth a 2@D rebid?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not having a club lead only makes a little difference to 6@C as when @D are 4-2 they make you ruff the first one with the Q@C |pg||

nt|panja: 2Nt Inv..|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzqe: Welcome Arun|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Yes the entry situation is key, and if the lead takes one out then I think the only way to hold it to one loser is the first round deep finesse|pg||
nt|sharkey: Appears some misinfo here - Director may be called...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Director was called|pg||
nt|sharkey: From East's 3@C bid apparent he can't have @C & @S|pg||
nt|peachy: good play, to deny multiple entries to board|pg||
nt|garnetts: Give South the 10@H and 3NT becomes a real struggle|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H is a kind of default rebid - you can't really bid anything else|pg||
nt|panja: @C lead should defeat this, but not easy to overrule @H|pg||
nt|arunbapat: Double has probably stopped S from bidding 3NT expecting clubs as weak suit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: Need to get trumps in play here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: E consulted him for a while|pg||
nt|panja: now a @C can be discarded on @HQ....and EW can get many trump tricks..|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraph814: for the english personnes this is not a official competition|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This looks like 300 against at least 650|pg||

nt|sharkey: 500 or 800|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and continuing the good work|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well,  that means you don't have to remember the situations when it isn't|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|d4|pc|cT|pg||

pc|sK|nt|mcarroll: Will get another chance for the @H ruff|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: will try and ruff a club now|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|panja: and the other question is to judge South's choice of play..with @CQx..would the line be right? ..|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: giving East a spade was possible, so that West does not have a chance to discard; but as against that @SQJ might have been doubleton|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: coming up...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sunsamvar: now easy make|pg||

nt|mcarroll: 1430 a bit anti- percentage?|pg||

nt|vugraphzqe: brb|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, we sort of gathered.....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: possible there that East assumed a six-card heart suit for the 2@H rebid - or at least a stronger heart suit. KJ looked good support |pg||
mb|1H|nt|sunsamvar: 4 @S has chances here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  And doÂ´nt forget - slam is less than 40 % or so|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|mdgraham: that's the sort of game you are happy to have made |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|sharkey: 3 NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: but south shd get aminor suit ruff/ promotion to put it down|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Unless W get ambitious and start looking for minor suit fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW getting to 4@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Thin 3@H shows 5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe West might have bid 2NT instead of 2@H, as he did have a diamond stop, even though it was anti-positional|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, after bididng the 4th suit, 3NT would have shown the East hand quite well. Very difficult, in other words |pg||
nt|garnetts: True Mike but 2@H is a utility bid in my view--if not then 2@S was the better rebid--that is very likely to be a doubleton|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: one point to note here is the trump support on a 4D opening is not a gr8 asset- Venkatesh might hv valued it in his slam expedition|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  But @D-finesse|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - @D finesse needed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But you do need the @D finesse and trumps 3-2, so a reasonable bet|pg||
nt|panja: 2@C is Clubs..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: gosh, yes; 10 imps on  39|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: natural up to 5@D bid...4@C ace asking...5@D shows a void|pg||

nt|khaled_m: lucky break |pg||

pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|sunsamvar: south does not know it but a @D now would have been a killer now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: declarer will have to take S finesse for his 12th trick, and since nothing else is available, he will|pg||

nt|garnetts: They had a rather better auction in my view |pg||
nt|garnetts: It was actually quite an interesting hand because in my view 2@S always shows a doubleton--3@S 5-4-3-1 with extra values--since a minimum 5-4-3-1 can always bid 2@S initially|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: back |pg||
mb|1H|nt|mcarroll: 4@H looks good|pg||
nt|peachy: choice of strategy, splinter and set trumps or bid spades and subsequently force to game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: another 4441 hand|pg||
nt|panja: 1@D opening yet again for NS...if W allows N to open that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraph814: Pour plus d'informations : http://www.bcsh.fr/accueil/index.html|pg||
nt|vugraph814: BCSH : bridge club saint honoré : meilleur club de Paris pres de la porte dauphine|pg||
nt|panja: tricky hand, NS could easily go overboard...|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|panja: 1Nt, F, 8+ HCP|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: EW will be going to at least 3@D|pg||
nt|panja: 2@D stiff or void Diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|peachy: this splinter is unwelcome to Shah |pg||
nt|mdgraham: would pass by North here say "no preference, you choose?"|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: AK opposite singleton weighs as much as an Ace alone, except for added protection|pg||
nt|othered1: Why did east keep his @D out of the auction?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I agree with your analysis of that hand, but it's not universally accepted.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: was 1@d natural? If so, odd that East didn't raise|pg||
nt|panja: with 5422...what could E do? 3@D could mean playing in 53 fit at 3 level|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tez: k of @s ..|pg||

pc|s3|pg||

nt|garnetts: anyone for passing 3NT on the East hand?  |pg||

nt|othered1: I guess, and then the double of 2@D by west?|pg||

pc|hA|nt|mcarroll: 4@S not so obvious to bid though|pg||

pc|c5|nt|peachy: both E and W have a little bit in reserve for what they have promised, I think I might make a second takeoutdouble with W hand|pg||

nt|sharkey: GF Stayman?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: staring at AJ9X IN DUMMY it is correct to play low from a KQ HOLDING and to put an honour up with  k10|pg||

nt|tez: udca=up side down count attitude|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: I assume 1 NT shows 9-11?|pg||

nt|othered1: now pretty much a matter of overtricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: Yes - S doesnt have an opener and opens his 2nd weakest suit:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good bidding - but NOT exciting|pg||
nt|othered1: This isn't optimal for EW, but it will be a plus and should put formidables into the lead with 3 comparisons to go.|pg||

nt|panja: the way the bidding began, no time or space to worry about South's distribution|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Apparently Bd 9 more difficult than anticipated as OR failed to bid game as well|pg||
nt|psridhar: one useful technique is to win h ACE at trick 1 and then lay down h king-shows doubleton asking for SPS on the second trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzqf: texas  leading 69 17|pg||
nt|panja: S should have shifted to @CQ..with 4 trumps..he is not interested in a ruff, is he?|pg||

nt|othered1: I don't think that 6@S is automatic to find, but they're on their way . . .|pg||
nt|othered1: If west had a realistic entry, a @C back at trick 2 could lead declarer into a losing play.  But east won't underlead @DAK against slam.|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone know what 3@H and 4@C imply?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: guess controls|pg||
nt|othered1: Have @S been established as trumps?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told 3@H agreeed @S and cue-bid (I guess first round control?), 4@C cue, too.|pg||
nt|panja: so..board 46 will decide|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 46 is 2 imps - 3@C-1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so it looks like the Hooda team will win|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|panja: if the boys win, that will be first national level DEMICOMA triumph without me or Vivek playing....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that Hooda was 0-42 down after the first set|pg||
nt|othered1: they've played quite solidly after they got back into the match in the second quarter.|pg||
