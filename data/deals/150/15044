nt|vugraphzpu: table 1 is the leaders table. Hope you will have much fun while watching us . |pg||
pc|h2|nt|rmb1: South has shown some values, and North has shown a NT range (?)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|blum1956: Even if you open 1NT the result will be the same|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk3: and the lead is weird|pg||

mb|5H|nt|blum1956: Do thay have methods to discover the @d fit?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|blum1956: 5@s will cost NS 500|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: N said they owned 4. level! But not 5.:)|pg||

nt|haans: 4NT quant say many advanced playes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: So do I but what is 5@S|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|haans: 2+Q|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|h4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|blum1956: Now 12 tricks are easy. More probable 13 as S is squeezed automatically|pg||

nt|blum1956: A huge gain while playing MP's|pg||
nt|blum1956: E should be satisfied with 12 tricks therefore he gets 13|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer will cash 4 @H and 4@D and South will have to establish @C5 or unguard @SK.  Declarer will just cash his winners for +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Something got wrong, dev took his trx in d odd h and at table in tr 12 had s4 to the king |pg||

pc|c4|pc|hK|pc|s3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|blum1956: E's double of 3NT looks too ambitious. If 3NT goes down the score should be perfect even undoubled.|pg||
mc|10|nt|frankaus: lots of gr8 bridge - hope we see more |pg||
nt|blum1956: sometimes one doubles in such a position in order to make S run to 4@c while 3NT making. From E's point of view this time it should hardly be the case|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Knut Molander- Geir Andersen are probable the very best pair from our district today. Both have good results, Knut has been norw champ as senior several times. |pg||

nt|blum1956: You need to guess clubs if you bid 6@c|pg||
mb|1C|nt|blum1956: Let us recall the board where EW made 6NT with an overtrick. There exists a good method to show the spade support and FG values after 2@c Stayman and 2@s responce. You just bid 3@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|vugraphzpu: 4 col forcing|pg||
nt|blum1956: Not easy to check for a @cQ using RKCB. Other method needed|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or 3@C repeat Stayman |pg||
mb|3D|nt|blum1956: What kind of NT range do all these people have?|pg||
nt|haans: Repeat Stayman normal in Norway|pg||
nt|haans: mostly 15-17 or Big Clubs then 14-16|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|vugraphzpu: bt pairs ab -16 last rnd!|pg||
nt|frankaus: i have a view about 5 minor contracts at pairs...................... its like kissing ur own sister,.............. even if its right its hard to get excited by ur prospects|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|blum1956: Why not 1NT then?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like a weak/mini opening NT and 1@C includes balanced 15+|pg||
nt|haans: some play it weaker|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: I would risked 6@c havin S's hand|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: weak nt standard in Denmark and south sweden |pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|blum1956: will S believe the @c10 is a honest card?|pg||
nt|frankaus: is this a real restricted choice ??|pg||
nt|rmb1: No.  I think it would be right to play @C10 from 10x, so parnter can score his potential Q|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|rmb1: @SJ was a good try (worth thinking about) but the spade pips are good enough for declarer|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: @SJ psyching play|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|blum1956: Clearly he may deduce the @c10 is not a singleton as the defence should set the contract by the @sK in the 2nd trick. But it may be doubleton|pg||
nt|frankaus: at this level @Ct is mandatory|pg||
nt|frankaus: from Tx|pg||

pc|h8|pc|dT|nt|blum1956: Siv Thoresen calculated E's hand. He has 4 hearts, 4 clubs as he played, probably 3+ diamonds (she has only one) hence 2 spades|pg||
