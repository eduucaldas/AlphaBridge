nt|sunsamvar: but here he is partnering the vetran Ashok|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S for NS in B14, 5@D sac for EW...could go down many though|pg||
nt|garnetts: employed a variation of the Kokish style relay |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Cambridge Precision did that in the late 70's :) |pg||
nt|garnetts: Dates you Mike :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes :(|pg||
nt|garnetts: not alone :(|pg||
nt|garnetts: seems to be taking for ever --must be a technical problem I suppose|pg||
mb|1S|nt|coolvijay: JM has been playing with Ashok quite regularly prior to his joining Texanaces|pg||
nt|panja: 1@D promises a 4-card Major here|pg||
nt|panja: so E has bid 1@D because of his 4@H, not to show his long @D|pg||
nt|panja: ideally, he should have opened 2@D here to show Diamonds..|pg||
nt|arunbapat: may be they are not playing Demicoma or this may be the variation Panja|pg||
nt|panja: E had cannot see any advantage in playing in @H in preference to @D|pg||

nt|mdgraham: hmm 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: sorry ...will claim ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: missed the play....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S looks a bit of a punt, but the East hand fits well|pg||
nt|othered1: was 2@S constructive here?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraph814: Bonsoir nous voici au BCSH meilleur club de paris pour un duplicate en étoile tous les joueurs sont donc associés a nos 4 champions|pg||
nt|garnetts: I know that in France they employ a short club and rebid majors--but I agree with Mike it is dreadful--must show 5-4 in my view when you bid two suits|pg||
nt|garnetts: Bteer to rebid 1NT and employ checkback|pg||
nt|garnetts: better I mean |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there was some debate about this recently - two vociferous (and diametric) points of view|pg||
nt|panja: 2@S was const...|pg||
nt|othered1: That explains the simplified (and effective) auction.|pg||
nt|panja: I thought there would be a temptation to play in Nt, but Prabha has chosen not to opt for Nt|pg||
pc|dK|nt|coolvijay: oh thats a bold bid by Ashok|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|peachy: this can make so bldness pays off|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i agree since a void in parners suit is not an asset and West cus have only 3@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: trump shift now|pg||
nt|peachy: Surprised that initial trump lead was not made, with those spades|pg||
nt|peachy: kibitzers scream that it was screaming for a trump lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Kayzad Thinking|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|s2|pc|c4|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|peachy: Doubledummy, we see of course it is makeable now, but declarer has some figuring out to do|pg||

nt|othered1: Some might open a strong NT with west hand.  After the start, do they have a way to 3N?  Is 2N natural over the raise?|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: ty Pinja|pg||
mb|4S|nt|panja: 1@C is 16+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice 4@S bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: E/W is playing precision|pg||
nt|panja: 3@C shows @D suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraph814: le principe : tout le monde se compare aux champions de notre salle|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D asks for short suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|panja: @H is that short suit|pg||
nt|othered1: well, it works here|pg||
pc|c9|nt|panja: 3Nt not the best bid..|pg||
nt|panja: 3@S natural would have been fine...but now Thakral is likely to bid 4@D..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and with the hearts as friendly as could be, has the merit of being cold|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|panja: this will survive because W's Clubs are good|pg||
nt|panja: but it is definitely not the best spot..|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sunsamvar: the other semi is between Formidables and Hooda|pg||
nt|arunbapat: system Fix|pg||
nt|panja: no, nothing to do with system..|pg||
nt|panja: there were three mistakes here...1. W should not bid 3@D with only 1 Diamond|pg||
nt|panja: secondly, W should bid 3@S to get the 5-3 @S fit...either on 3@C or on 3@H|pg||
nt|arunbapat: holding AKJ in short suit of P 3NT is appealing..so he can not try 3S even if he want to else auction will cross 3nt if P has no S fit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: Duck a !"C into S here|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A @D-lead would have made this board INTERESTING|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW can make 6@C on this layout, but it's a bit lucky|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed - like any ggod pd lead his suit...|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@C makes on any lead --but lucky needs 3-3 @D's |pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  Can only make by "C-finesse then|pg||
nt|arunbapat: he will survive this due to S position|pg||

nt|vugraph814: BessisBessis|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: at this level shud be routine|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have to say I feel uncomfortable  about 3@C ---never shown a @D suit|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  Not after 4 @D-tricks to N/S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No routine at all|pg||
nt|sharkey: Sry Hans - Im looking at the actual hand  with @D lead need a peek to take the finesse|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: any opinion as to whether the West hand is worth a 2@D rebid?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not having a club lead only makes a little difference to 6@C as when @D are 4-2 they make you ruff the first one with the Q@C |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
mc|10|nt|sunsamvar: did Keyzad give count in @H?|pg||

nt|garnetts: neeed to get the brakes on here--the hearts make 3NT easier |pg||
nt|panja: 2Nt Inv..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Yes the entry situation is key, and if the lead takes one out then I think the only way to hold it to one loser is the first round deep finesse|pg||
nt|sharkey: Appears some misinfo here - Director may be called...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Director was called|pg||
nt|sharkey: From East's 3@C bid apparent he can't have @C & @S|pg||
nt|peachy: good play, to deny multiple entries to board|pg||
nt|garnetts: Give South the 10@H and 3NT becomes a real struggle|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H is a kind of default rebid - you can't really bid anything else|pg||
nt|panja: @C lead should defeat this, but not easy to overrule @H|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sharkey: Need to get trumps in play here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: E consulted him for a while|pg||
nt|panja: now a @C can be discarded on @HQ....and EW can get many trump tricks..|pg||
nt|panja: oh..in fact, @H will defeat..|pg||
nt|panja: must win @HA and shift to @C|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|garnetts: I am not keen on the 3@H bid --2NT is better and see what west does-|pg||
nt|garnetts: East needs to quit right now |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT should be FG after the fourth-suit 2@D (if that was what it was)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mcarroll: Only 2 off I think?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|garnetts: Thats my view|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think it is best to play fsf as a game force in all situations --but thats a view |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraph814: for the english personnes this is not a official competition|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This looks like 300 against at least 650|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like off 2 - unless N can get a @H ruff |pg||
nt|sharkey: 500 or 800|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and continuing the good work|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well,  that means you don't have to remember the situations when it isn't|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is hard to play--lots of possible lines like winning and playing three rounds of D@s --|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not easy, this. May play @DA and another |pg||
nt|panja: @DA and small will do...|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|panja: and the other question is to judge South's choice of play..with @CQx..would the line be right? ..|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: giving East a spade was possible, so that West does not have a chance to discard; but as against that @SQJ might have been doubleton|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: possible there that East assumed a six-card heart suit for the 2@H rebid - or at least a stronger heart suit. KJ looked good support |pg||
mb|1C|nt|sunsamvar: 4 @S has chances here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  And doÂ´nt forget - slam is less than 40 % or so|pg||
nt|sharkey: Multi I assume|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: that's the sort of game you are happy to have made |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sharkey: 3 NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: but south shd get aminor suit ruff/ promotion to put it down|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Unless W get ambitious and start looking for minor suit fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW getting to 4@S here|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|sharkey: Thin 3@H shows 5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe West might have bid 2NT instead of 2@H, as he did have a diamond stop, even though it was anti-positional|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, after bididng the 4th suit, 3NT would have shown the East hand quite well. Very difficult, in other words |pg||
nt|garnetts: True Mike but 2@H is a utility bid in my view--if not then 2@S was the better rebid--that is very likely to be a doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: brave move, counting E to be relatively short in clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like they're on the way to 4@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  But @D-finesse|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - @D finesse needed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But you do need the @D finesse and trumps 3-2, so a reasonable bet|pg||

nt|othered1: they did get to and score the better game|pg||
nt|garnetts: They had a rather better auction in my view |pg||
nt|garnetts: It was actually quite an interesting hand because in my view 2@S always shows a doubleton--3@S 5-4-3-1 with extra values--since a minimum 5-4-3-1 can always bid 2@S initially|pg||

nt|othered1: What did happen?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: decl claimed minus 2|pg||
nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably his best shot...|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D vs 3@h or 3@S competition, touch and go...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: And EW accepted?|pg||
nt|garnetts: srry guys gotta go--enjoyed your company--bye for now |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: it really didnt matter much, when defending partscore while vulnerable game is on for their side|pg||
nt|othered1: bye David|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|hawe45:  With opener sitting NORTH???|pg||
nt|sharkey: Since N opened had to be with him|pg||
nt|tez: again 4@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: wont make this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: JM telling partner 4@h cold:) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: bye Dave|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|panja: not easy for N, dbl has the drawback that he does not have @D support|pg||
nt|othered1: Do the players realize just how close this is?  I'd think so.  That can change their attitude towards safety plays that can cost imps . . .|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tez: indeed 3@c+1@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: GF Stayman?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: staring at AJ9X IN DUMMY it is correct to play low from a KQ HOLDING and to put an honour up with  k10|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there may be a TD request on that board later|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed....and some people say that overtricks don't count |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: since board 27 the dealing machine has been stuck on the "EW game" setting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: North came to bid . . . |pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure why Norht bid over 3@D|pg||
pc|s6|nt|panja: to avoid this problem, S could have weak jumped to 3@D first time|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tez: its problem jt bare if you play udca|pg||
nt|tez: high card shows 3 card|pg||
nt|tez: udca=up side down count attitude|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - this case East will get a second chance when in on @HA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Even if W switches - seeing Qxx in dummy, he should get another chance for the ruff|pg||

nt|arunbapat: appears kaustubh has decided to wipe out the 42 imps lead in this set itself.Still Sandeep has to make it now, it depend upon the D view..declaere can play for DQ drop on 3 rd ...|pg||

nt|panja: NS have a good score in OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: It has been a pleasure Sunil and Mahesh, past midnight. I have to call it a night.  Thanks kibitzers for your helpful comments!!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Tx Raija|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Bye |pg||
nt|panja: considering the difference between the two teams...this is a great performance for Hooda team..|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 4@H is good, but easier if south opens |pg||
nt|othered1: I'd like any plus NS, as it's EW's hand in @S|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: Keep us on our toes Pinja :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: what does the 1@H mean Mahesh|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzqe: 1@h alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: Formidables..3-time World QF...and dozens of international appearances..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzqe: 1@h either @s or @c +@d |pg||
nt|panja: Hooda, the 4 playing here, 32 or so average age...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sharkey: I assume 1 NT shows 9-11?|pg||
nt|tez: NS playing artificial system|pg||
nt|othered1: now pretty much a matter of overtricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|panja: this will be 5 IMps+ to formidables|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: Yes - S doesnt have an opener and opens his 2nd weakest suit:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good bidding - but NOT exciting|pg||
nt|othered1: This isn't optimal for EW, but it will be a plus and should put formidables into the lead with 3 comparisons to go.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: Worked - EW shut out|pg||
nt|tez: why not dbl to 2@d ?Arle|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 45 and 46 look plus positions|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|sharkey: Apparently Bd 9 more difficult than anticipated as OR failed to bid game as well|pg||
nt|psridhar: one useful technique is to win h ACE at trick 1 and then lay down h king-shows doubleton asking for SPS on the second trick|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|vugraphzqf: texas  leading 69 17|pg||
nt|panja: S should have shifted to @CQ..with 4 trumps..he is not interested in a ruff, is he?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|sunsamvar: JM might think north has @S|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: the Hooda team were down 42-0 after the first set|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1NT is a shortness ask|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty Rajesh Tibrewala|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think that 6@S is automatic to find, but they're on their way . . .|pg||
nt|othered1: If west had a realistic entry, a @C back at trick 2 could lead declarer into a losing play.  But east won't underlead @DAK against slam.|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone know what 3@H and 4@C imply?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: guess controls|pg||
nt|othered1: Have @S been established as trumps?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told 3@H agreeed @S and cue-bid (I guess first round control?), 4@C cue, too.|pg||
nt|panja: so..board 46 will decide|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 46 is 2 imps - 3@C-1|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|panja: if the boys win, that will be first national level DEMICOMA triumph without me or Vivek playing....|pg||
