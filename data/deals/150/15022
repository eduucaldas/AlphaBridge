mb|p|mb|p|nt|arunbapat: it is going to be a uphill task for Hooda ,,but I have seen them fighting out 34 imps lead of DSM yesterday|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: This is the final of the Finnish Cup - first of two segments - 16 boards each|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|sunsamvar: hi all and wlc to the 1st quarter of the semis in the Poddar Nationals in Mumbai|pg||
nt|arunbapat: Demicoma is Prakash's baby |pg||
nt|panja: I was not aware they played demicoma|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: play slow as usual on this table|pg||
nt|arunbapat: I think they play Demicoma with some variations |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all. Strong come-back from the Hooda team, 42-0 down after the first set|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: will claim ....server problem ....sorry all|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, Mahesh and Panja|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: waititng for this board to finish ...play still on|pg||
nt|panja: 1@D opening promising some 4-card Major, 1@H natural..|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: other s/f Texan Aces up by 30 imps|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|mcarroll: The West hand is an advertisement for having a bid to show a one-suiter over 1NT, as you can always rely on pd to be short in the suit you want him to lead in thi s auction|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Vijay|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Welcome All|pg||
nt|coolvijay: Hi Sunil|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi colleagues, kibitzers and  our operator Mahesh|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Welcome Raija Davis|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Hi Raija|pg||
nt|coolvijay: Hi Raija|pg||
nt|panja: 2Nt is a good spot..|pg||
nt|arunbapat: will Satya come out to 3D I guess he will.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Kista is not everyone and you can expect a few surprises from him all the time|pg||
nt|sharkey: :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has undertsated his hand - works ok this time as S rather weak for t/o Dbl view pd's pass|pg||
pc|c4|nt|panja: with this score, EW should be taking chances, and NS, playing safe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Mumbai|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Mahesh|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and good morning to Panja|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Hello Roland Good Morning|pg||
nt|panja: Good Morning Roland, hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Welcome back Panja|pg||
nt|Walddk4: also welcome to NK Gupta|pg||
nt|nkgupt: hi mahesh/panja/ all|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Hi NK |pg||
pc|c3|nt|panja: if N leads to S, and S shifts to @D...this will go down many|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|peachy: Good to see you all|pg||
nt|nkgupt: hi roland|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|panja: but if @S are continued....it will be interesting|pg||
nt|panja: this will make 10 tricks for 630...what would 1D XX have been?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|panja: satya found a good lead|pg||
nt|panja: the @D shift will be difficult to find though|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: other s/f texanaces up by 19|pg||
nt|panja: the bidding does not suggest N could have 6 @D|pg||
nt|panja: so....Kiran is more likely to return a @S..??|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: waiting|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: shuffling between @s n @d|pg||
nt|panja: y, @H or @C unlikely, looking at the Dummy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panja: note how the system kept South in dark|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|peachy: This looks like Strong Club auction, surely is|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Other s/f Formidables vs Hooda|pg||
pc|s4|nt|panja: S should not have doubled, true, but having doubled, if S had a better idea of N shape, she would have found the right defence|pg||
nt|panja: deal is not over yet though....W needs to find @HA still, quite likely, he will|pg||
nt|arunbapat: I think satya should have played if safe by taking out to 3D.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panja: after S plays @CK..there is little chance W will go wrong in @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: +|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i suppose after the neg 1@D response it was too much for Ashok to push on to slam|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: declarer will play spades from top, no finesse even evailable|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: ND END UP WITH 11 TRICKS|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mcarroll: Good switch|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  50 - but E/W have an easy 90 in 2 @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed - so off 1 - didnt matter he missed the @H suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gd morn ing Martin|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sry for caps|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon from a cloudy London|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|panja: I dont quite like the discards...|pg||
nt|panja: the fourth @H in either hand is not very useful..|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: but here he is partnering the vetran Ashok|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S for NS in B14, 5@D sac for EW...could go down many though|pg||
nt|garnetts: employed a variation of the Kokish style relay |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that was fast|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: sorry play had started so claimed ...now back live|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Mahesh|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Welcome Vijay|pg||
nt|coolvijay: A remarkable show by team Hooda who were the underdogs|pg||
nt|coolvijay: Hi Mahesh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should have kept the @D7 for the last trick.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 4@S will be a good spot here|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: n/s playing 2/1 ...e/w demicoma|pg||
nt|panja: after the 1@H opening, it will be a struggle to find @S spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: waiting for the tray...now with n/e|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: still waiting|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Cambridge Precision did that in the late 70's :) |pg||
nt|garnetts: Dates you Mike :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes :(|pg||
nt|garnetts: not alone :(|pg||
nt|garnetts: seems to be taking for ever --must be a technical problem I suppose|pg||
mb|1N|nt|coolvijay: JM has been playing with Ashok quite regularly prior to his joining Texanaces|pg||
nt|panja: 1@D promises a 4-card Major here|pg||
nt|panja: so E has bid 1@D because of his 4@H, not to show his long @D|pg||
nt|panja: ideally, he should have opened 2@D here to show Diamonds..|pg||
nt|arunbapat: may be they are not playing Demicoma or this may be the variation Panja|pg||
nt|panja: E had cannot see any advantage in playing in @H in preference to @D|pg||
nt|panja: well, with this hand, the opening is a matter of choice....|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: waiting for satya to bid|pg||
nt|panja: no alert on 1@D Mahesh?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Welcome Carl and Sunil|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|panja: 1Nt 12-15...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: @H lead will set 3 NT - anything else it may make|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: not alertd by kaustabh|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: alerted|pg||
nt|panja: it does not show up here...|pg||
nt|panja: ok...then it must be natural...not demicoma|pg||
nt|panja: 1Nt F, 8+, but here E seems to have taken a liberty|pg||
nt|panja: he should not have a void for 1Nt bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Welcome Panja|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Set?|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - always a make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning Hans|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shud work ok as favorable lead; @D set up|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Morning - I just had a wake-up call - by Sharkey...|pg||
nt|sharkey: :)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: doubt if 4@s can stand repeated forces w/ @d / unless play for complete crossruff|pg||
nt|panja: good pass..this might solve a problem|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Panja|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they did extremely well yesyerday, winning their semi-final after losing the first set 0-42|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|peachy: 3D will be quite enough|pg||
nt|panja: will make if @S is not led..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: here is an entry to dummy|pg||
nt|panja: S has 4-card @H here, but with a surfeit of Kings, 1Nt is preferred opening, not 1@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this deal shows the power of aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Welcome T C Pant|pg||
nt|arunbapat: Remarkable show by Hooda's team it is only 4 member team   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: should be ok, though - win, knock out club ace, win second spade and knock out heart ace |pg||
nt|arunbapat: with Sandeep- Kaustubh and Sandeep-kaustubh as a pair in both room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will be afraid of 5-3 spades, but as we can see they are 4-4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: "mislook"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: sorry ...will claim ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: missed the play....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S looks a bit of a punt, but the East hand fits well|pg||
nt|othered1: was 2@S constructive here?|pg||
nt|panja: I guess only @Sk lead will beat it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraph814: Bonsoir nous voici au BCSH meilleur club de paris pour un duplicate en étoile tous les joueurs sont donc associés a nos 4 champions|pg||
nt|garnetts: I know that in France they employ a short club and rebid majors--but I agree with Mike it is dreadful--must show 5-4 in my view when you bid two suits|pg||
nt|garnetts: Bteer to rebid 1NT and employ checkback|pg||
nt|garnetts: better I mean |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there was some debate about this recently - two vociferous (and diametric) points of view|pg||
nt|panja: 2@S was const...|pg||
nt|othered1: That explains the simplified (and effective) auction.|pg||
nt|panja: I thought there would be a temptation to play in Nt, but Prabha has chosen not to opt for Nt|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|coolvijay: oh thats a bold bid by Ashok|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: 12-15 range - cud he have opened something else?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why @C from dummy .....?|pg||
nt|panja: I wonder why he touched Clubs, rather than playing Diamonds|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well 15 and 2 tens is top of the pops|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - 4333 doesnt had too much value though|pg||
nt|panja: @SQ now...and South might be in trouble|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that is tough|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Venky shuffling between @s q n 10|pg||
nt|panja: could even go down 3 if he misguesses Diamonds|pg||
nt|vicky888:  maybe starting with clubs by S would stop the club shift by E|pg||
nt|sharkey: my aunt wud have claimed 7 tricks by now....|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|panja: both EW here are sharp players, Venky loves to tinker with demicoma...so you will see some imaginative bidding |pg||
nt|sharkey: often the KISS principle is superior though....|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|peachy: this can make so bldness pays off|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i agree since a void in parners suit is not an asset and West cus have only 3@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: trump shift now|pg||
nt|peachy: Surprised that initial trump lead was not made, with those spades|pg||
nt|peachy: kibitzers scream that it was screaming for a trump lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Kayzad Thinking|pg||
nt|panja: but then, you could give @H open and still make|pg||
nt|panja: this shd be a make too...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|panja: this is a tricky game...|pg||
nt|panja: to avoid trump promotion...W must ensure S does not get in|pg||
nt|panja: so...it is essential to play !Q or J first time, not A|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|sharkey: for those not familiar with KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: south shd figure out that venky is short in @S and can take an avoidance play in @D |pg||
pc|s5|pc|c3|nt|coolvijay: oh thats something different|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzpx: NS plays strong club, 1@c = 15+ from 1st/2nd and 19+ from 3rd/4th|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c9|nt|panja: this is not a good approach...where are his 10 tricks going to come from?|pg||
nt|panja: best for W to exit with a @H now|pg||
nt|panja: leave the @D guess to Kaustubh|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: decl thinking|pg||
nt|panja: not @SK? difficult to believe that|pg||
nt|arunbapat: After S was ducked D shift(improbable) would take it down|pg||
pc|sT|nt|peachy: Doubledummy, we see of course it is makeable now, but declarer has some figuring out to do|pg||
pc|d6|nt|othered1: Some might open a strong NT with west hand.  After the start, do they have a way to 3N?  Is 2N natural over the raise?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d4|pg||
mc|9|nt|mdgraham: indeed, but the defence was never going to do anything other than lead another spade|pg||

nt|vugraphzqe: Venky saying sorry to p|pg||
nt|sharkey: I am not sure "wd" is deserved though...|pg||
nt|sharkey: by S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i think Venky had a count of the south hand.. probably thought declarer had @CQ and no @DK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: splendid North hand|pg||
nt|panja: 3Nt for EW?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|peachy: EW will likely get to bid undisturbed this hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lets hope things are Ok now--very awkward for our operator when this happens |pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: unbeatable if played byb East|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: ty Pinja|pg||
nt|panja: South is not going to like it...|pg||
nt|panja: I prefer a dbl on this South hand..1Nt is way too risky|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Now, have NS any wriggle methods....|pg||
nt|panja: I doubt that..|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 1@C is 16+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice 4@S bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: E/W is playing precision|pg||
nt|panja: 3@C shows @D suit|pg||
mb|r|nt|mdgraham: I like 1NT - you have a 17-count and two club stoppers|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraph814: le principe : tout le monde se compare aux champions de notre salle|pg||
nt|panja: 3@D asks for short suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: in a 1 nt contract defence and dummy play has various alternatives... to go wrong too|pg||
nt|vicky888:  interesting thing here is venky is playing on the table and also kibbing though his BBO id "vinutha" :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|panja: @H is that short suit|pg||
nt|othered1: well, it works here|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C was safe in any event - either S had @CQ or @DK.  If pd had @CQ @C return needed|pg||
mb|d|nt|panja: 3Nt not the best bid..|pg||
nt|panja: 3@S natural would have been fine...but now Thakral is likely to bid 4@D..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and with the hearts as friendly as could be, has the merit of being cold|pg||
nt|panja: 1@D promises some 4 card Major...dbl of 2@D neagative|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North's pass forced redouble, I am told (Rajesh Tibrewala, thanks)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: doesnt look like this set will be boring...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzqe: play slow on this table|pg||
nt|panja: after winning this, N should shift to @H ....not immediately give ruffs..|pg||
nt|panja: this should work...will go down two...a @D ruff will add one|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: this will survive because W's Clubs are good|pg||
nt|panja: but it is definitely not the best spot..|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sunsamvar: the other semi is between Formidables and Hooda|pg||
nt|arunbapat: system Fix|pg||
nt|panja: no, nothing to do with system..|pg||
nt|panja: there were three mistakes here...1. W should not bid 3@D with only 1 Diamond|pg||
nt|panja: secondly, W should bid 3@S to get the 5-3 @S fit...either on 3@C or on 3@H|pg||
nt|arunbapat: holding AKJ in short suit of P 3NT is appealing..so he can not try 3S even if he want to else auction will cross 3nt if P has no S fit|pg||
nt|nkgupt: cud be a free 500 here|pg||
nt|nkgupt: infact 800 not ruled out on dd def|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Special Thanks to Poddar Develeopers for sponsoring this tournament|pg||

nt|mdgraham: basically, you can write down "00" in the minus column and fill in the rest later|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: Duck a !"C into S here|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A @D-lead would have made this board INTERESTING|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW can make 6@C on this layout, but it's a bit lucky|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sharkey: indeed - like any ggod pd lead his suit...|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Can only make by "C-finesse then|pg||
nt|arunbapat: he will survive this due to S position|pg||

nt|sharkey: at this level shud be routine|pg||

nt|sharkey: think @H shift costs a trick Panja|pg||
nt|panja: no...will give a guess|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - assuming East guesses correctly|pg||
nt|panja: the trouble is...on every ruff, E can discard something..|pg||
nt|panja: if it were @HQx with E, @H shift is amndatory|pg||
nt|panja: mandatory even|pg||

nt|hawe45:  No routine at all|pg||
nt|sharkey: Sry Hans - Im looking at the actual hand  with @D lead need a peek to take the finesse|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: any opinion as to whether the West hand is worth a 2@D rebid?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not having a club lead only makes a little difference to 6@C as when @D are 4-2 they make you ruff the first one with the Q@C |pg||

nt|sunsamvar: did Keyzad give count in @H?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|panja: the problem with a @D play at trick two is that the hand transposes to Nt quickly..|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|mdgraham: yes, and 6511 shape with aces in the long suits|pg||

nt|panja: and now a @S...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|nkgupt: dont really understand that 3rd seat...w/o even an urgency to be wanting a @h lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: EW not on the same level here I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: How do they bid it?|pg||
nt|panja: venky could overcall 1Nt, strictly @S check not needed here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|panja: 1Nt F, 8+|pg||
nt|arunbapat: bold takeout double |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: on 8 HCP?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|panja: 2@S no stiff or void|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: i wd have led a @H too.. though it is not a succes here|pg||
nt|garnetts: neeed to get the brakes on here--the hearts make 3NT easier |pg||
nt|panja: 2Nt Inv..|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: why not just bid 2@D ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: that's my call|pg||
nt|panja: I would have doubled as E..|pg||
nt|panja: what more do you need? 4@H, 17 HCP... lots of Aces|pg||
nt|panja: quite likely, Kista overlooked an ace|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|vugraphzqe: Welcome Arun|pg||
nt|panja: well..this is not the first time 1Nt overcall has got chopped.....and it won't be the last time...without a source of tricks 1Nt overcall is like a naked call option|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Yes the entry situation is key, and if the lead takes one out then I think the only way to hold it to one loser is the first round deep finesse|pg||
nt|sharkey: Appears some misinfo here - Director may be called...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Director was called|pg||
nt|sharkey: From East's 3@C bid apparent he can't have @C & @S|pg||
nt|peachy: good play, to deny multiple entries to board|pg||
nt|garnetts: Give South the 10@H and 3NT becomes a real struggle|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H is a kind of default rebid - you can't really bid anything else|pg||
nt|panja: @C lead should defeat this, but not easy to overrule @H|pg||
nt|arunbapat: Double has probably stopped S from bidding 3NT expecting clubs as weak suit|pg||
nt|panja: needs to guess @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Need to get trumps in play here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: E consulted him for a while|pg||
nt|panja: now a @C can be discarded on @HQ....and EW can get many trump tricks..|pg||
nt|panja: oh..in fact, @H will defeat..|pg||
nt|panja: must win @HA and shift to @C|pg||
nt|panja: shd be cold|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Kista is Kista.. he comes in with a moth eaten suit on the last board and passes with 17 good points here.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|arunbapat: else I am sure Key would bid 3NT knowing 6 D and opening hand with P|pg||
nt|panja: should be easy after three rounds of Clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|panja: looks like NS are close to 9 tricks in Nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: let us agree to disagree - I think the 1NT overcall is fine. If you double, then after 1@H/@S 1NT is classically 19-20-ish  |pg||
nt|panja: agreed with last part|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|arunbapat: ??|pg||
nt|arunbapat: did he he CA ON CQ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: sorry|pg||
nt|panja: and trumps of course..|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D shift may be trouble|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am not keen on the 3@H bid --2NT is better and see what west does-|pg||
nt|garnetts: East needs to quit right now |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT should be FG after the fourth-suit 2@D (if that was what it was)|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Kista is a brilliant player but a difficult partner to understand :)|pg||
nt|panja: @D shift...he will win @DA. cash !AK, and play Diamonds..|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcarroll: Only 2 off I think?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|garnetts: Thats my view|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think it is best to play fsf as a game force in all situations --but thats a view |pg||
nt|panja: classically...that is the key phrase|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraph814: for the english personnes this is not a official competition|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This looks like 300 against at least 650|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like off 2 - unless N can get a @H ruff |pg||
nt|sharkey: 500 or 800|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and continuing the good work|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well,  that means you don't have to remember the situations when it isn't|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is hard to play--lots of possible lines like winning and playing three rounds of D@s --|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not easy, this. May play @DA and another |pg||
nt|panja: @DA and small will do...|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|panja: problem solved!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|cT|pg||

pc|c7|nt|sharkey: with actual hand that works |pg||
pc|d2|nt|garnetts: Not sure I can see a winning line to be honest--tempting to ruff a club --but doesn't work here|pg||

pc|cJ|pg||
nt|nkgupt: doubt if the bid it as a make :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharkey: S will get one more shot at giving N a @H ruff|pg||
pc|dK|nt|panja: with 16-18, you don't have to rebid on a 1 level takeout|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: good heart discard....now up to East|pg||
nt|panja: bidding makes this difficult for East|pg||
nt|panja: he does not know what S has|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Will get another chance for the @H ruff|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: will try and ruff a club now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panja: and the other question is to judge South's choice of play..with @CQx..would the line be right? ..|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: giving East a spade was possible, so that West does not have a chance to discard; but as against that @SQJ might have been doubleton|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sharkey: coming up...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sunsamvar: now easy make|pg||

nt|mdgraham: ok|pg||
nt|panja: what else after the 3@S cue NK?|pg||
nt|sharkey: West 1 NT call in passout seat made this possible|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - Dbl|pg||
nt|sharkey: if West overcalls 2@D believe very hard to get to 4@H|pg||
nt|panja: absolutely..|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: possible there that East assumed a six-card heart suit for the 2@H rebid - or at least a stronger heart suit. KJ looked good support |pg||
nt|panja: what do you think did he bid it for?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sunsamvar: 4 @S has chances here|pg||
nt|nkgupt: mb as a 2 way bid|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Unless W get ambitious and start looking for minor suit fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW getting to 4@S here|pg||
nt|panja: the perils of a wide range system|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: Thin 3@H shows 5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe West might have bid 2NT instead of 2@H, as he did have a diamond stop, even though it was anti-positional|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, after bididng the 4th suit, 3NT would have shown the East hand quite well. Very difficult, in other words |pg||
nt|garnetts: True Mike but 2@H is a utility bid in my view--if not then 2@S was the better rebid--that is very likely to be a doubleton|pg||
nt|panja: this 1@S got passed out|pg||
nt|panja: N does not even have a maximum for his bid...4@S is almost cold|pg||
nt|panja: 3N will make because of the interesting @S situation|pg||
nt|panja: on @SQ..if N covers, his @S8 can be pinned next..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - lead @SQ. If covered, win @SA and run the 9 - obvious, really :)|pg||
nt|panja: if he does not, @Sk drops next round...so E will get 3 Spade tricks..|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: brave move, counting E to be relatively short in clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like they're on the way to 4@S|pg||

nt|panja: nine tricks..every which way|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: playing in 4nt|pg||
nt|panja: except if the run of Spades squeezes South out of a Club trick|pg||

nt|vugraphzqe: hopefully will be ok now|pg||
nt|panja: oh, you mean without @H check, partner will have to bid 4 level minor to proceed..??|pg||
nt|sharkey: if S and W hands were reversed you wished you didnt bid 3@S...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: brb|pg||
nt|panja: Keyzad fighting for every IMP....that is the spirit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't let anyone tell you that overtricks aren't important at teams. There have been several matches recently where teams have won or lost by 1|pg||
nt|panja: and this one could be the next in the series....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: my personal record is -1, -1, and -1 on the last three boards of a 48-boarder to tie -  and we then lost in overtime |pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: back|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: this will lead to 1@D by S, and 2@H by North to show both M|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: will come back to bd 18/19 after this |pg||
nt|nkgupt: some either or interference by N?|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|panja: 1@D promises some 4 Major|pg||
nt|mdgraham: natural bidding: 1@D=singleton diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: chances are you would be in a 53+ fit....other possibilities have small probabilities|pg||
nt|panja: 1@C 16+|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 6@C a make I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have to admit I would dbl on the west hand |pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|khaled_m: does 2@C deny 3 Spades|pg||
nt|panja: we now have a new leader|pg||
nt|panja: 1@H BAL or @H suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Dont need @S finesse|pg||
nt|panja: limited to 21|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Very often hard to bid these minor suit slams|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: JM will drive on to slam here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose 2NT should show this--never really discussed it to be honest |pg||
nt|panja: 1@S 5-8 HCP|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  But @D-finesse|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - @D finesse needed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But you do need the @D finesse and trumps 3-2, so a reasonable bet|pg||
nt|panja: 2@C is Clubs..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: gosh, yes; 10 imps on  39|pg||
nt|panja: 1N 16-18 BAL|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panja: natural up to 5@D bid...4@C ace asking...5@D shows a void|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sharkey: Often ends up in 3 NT...|pg||
nt|khaled_m: lucky break |pg||
nt|panja: E hasn't asked which void|pg||
nt|panja: this should make..|pg||
nt|othered1: That 4@S bid on board 39 wasn't duplicated in the OR.|pg||
nt|panja: two Clubs, @DA and a trump loser..|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and will finally take the @S fin to make i suppose|pg||
nt|panja: 2@D @H suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|panja: I don't know whether 3@D was intermediate jump, does not look like a weak bid|pg||
nt|panja: Mahesh, what was 3@D? strong jump?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: was not laerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: alerted|pg||
nt|panja: ok thx..|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sunsamvar: comm problems|pg||
nt|panja: it could be any red suit|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|sharkey: so 11 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: West may get squeezed|pg||
nt|sharkey: for 12|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's a risky sort of bid, as North may have a decentish hand - but then again, so may partner |pg||
nt|mdgraham: is it really necessary to open the North hand? I guess I'm getting old - unless I was playing a 10-12 NT, I'd pass|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|nkgupt: will need to play for strip on N for 9th trick...cashing 3@d's|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|panja: at this Vul, won't lose much just now...but yes, this is a bit light|pg||
nt|panja: oh sorry|pg||
nt|panja: did not see the double|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sunsamvar: south does not know it but a @D now would have been a killer now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: declarer will have to take S finesse for his 12th trick, and since nothing else is available, he will|pg||
nt|othered1: Perhaps just being aggressive over an opponent's ambiguous bid, not a bad strategy|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sunsamvar: good stop by N/S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Standard bidding may get too high here|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: indeed - test their agreements|pg||
pc|c5|pc|dT|nt|sharkey: N had a chance to bid 3@C instead of 3 NT |pg||
nt|tez: 9 of @h is important|pg||
nt|khaled_m: inching in. !! imps |pg||
nt|khaled_m: 11|pg||
nt|panja: S , by bidding 2@H, further limited his hand..once 1@S showed 5+, South had the option of crossing 2@H if he had @H fit and a good hand|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|panja: exchange N and E hands, and that could have meant losing a Vul game|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: board 45 - same auction (1@C-1NT-dbl), but North bid 2@h.   |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: Sry S|pg||

nt|mdgraham: on that hand it worked well - but West could have taken action one feels|pg||
nt|mdgraham: likely 4@H here NS|pg||

nt|panja: N will respond 1@H...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: all back now|pg||
nt|panja: with 2 HCP, he could not have bid on...even a 1Nt bid requires about 5...|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT may make unless @S shift|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: this hand will have trick defence|pg||

pc|h7|nt|panja: next bid likely to bd 4@H..|pg||
nt|panja: are NS playing weak 1Nt?|pg||
nt|panja: one top Spade, @S ruff and a Club..|pg||
nt|panja: now, why would S not bid on?|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|othered1: Another auction that gives the opponents little information (but south has 4@S and 3@H)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: the OR seems to be stuck on board 28|pg||
nt|othered1: they did get to and score the better game|pg||
nt|garnetts: They had a rather better auction in my view |pg||
nt|garnetts: It was actually quite an interesting hand because in my view 2@S always shows a doubleton--3@S 5-4-3-1 with extra values--since a minimum 5-4-3-1 can always bid 2@S initially|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: back |pg||
nt|panja: 7@C or 7@S here..|pg||
nt|sharkey: Just bidding it remains...|pg||
nt|panja: @H ruff 13th trick in 7@S...and @D ruff 13th in 7@C|pg||
nt|panja: alas the hand is with EW...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 4@H looks good|pg||
nt|peachy: choice of strategy, splinter and set trumps or bid spades and subsequently force to game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: another 4441 hand|pg||
nt|panja: 1@D opening yet again for NS...if W allows N to open that is|pg||

nt|panja: tricky hand, NS could easily go overboard...|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: 1Nt, F, 8+ HCP|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: EW will be going to at least 3@D|pg||
nt|panja: 2@D stiff or void Diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nkgupt: is the original TNT to be there|pg||
nt|panja: and what do you do with 18, 5-card @S, or 16 5-card @D, always open 1Nt with 5 Spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: this splinter is unwelcome to Shah |pg||
nt|mdgraham: would pass by North here say "no preference, you choose?"|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: AK opposite singleton weighs as much as an Ace alone, except for added protection|pg||
nt|othered1: Why did east keep his @D out of the auction?|pg||
nt|panja: 5-card @S rather|pg||
nt|panja: N should have bid 3@C here...on 2@C..or without 2@C even..|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: I agree with your analysis of that hand, but it's not universally accepted.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: was 1@d natural? If so, odd that East didn't raise|pg||
nt|panja: with 5422...what could E do? 3@D could mean playing in 53 fit at 3 level|pg||
nt|vicky888:  hooda being a 4 member team is pretty exhausted by now; that makes the game tougher|pg||

nt|othered1: Didn't that show @D, either?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|garnetts: Prefer 2NT to 2@S initially|pg||
nt|garnetts: anyone for passing 3NT on the East hand?  |pg||
nt|panja: 1@D could be 3 Diamonds at shortest, could it not?|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess, and then the double of 2@D by west?|pg||
nt|panja: y vicky, they have come quite a distance ....it is a creditable performance...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: possible, but 4@S looks normal enough|pg||

nt|othered1: if declarer goes after @H, thus can eschew @S finesse.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s2|nt|peachy: the shape is pure and any suit is fine|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: will the 3@S help him fin the @S J?|pg||
nt|panja: not a smart thing to do Venky...|pg||
nt|panja: @SJ position is not needed...a @D affords 1 discard|pg||
nt|panja: Kista is likely to shift to @SA and back...|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sharkey: May mean more IMPs to Utter|pg||
nt|garnetts: even that lead makes no difference |pg||
nt|panja: 4 top tricks for EW, 2@C, @HA, a @S..and one more will accrue in the scrum|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|panja: @S next, will he finesse or not?|pg||
nt|othered1: was the @C2 the correct count card?  Should it matter?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|panja: good def..Thak didn't waste time in winning @HA..|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tez: 10 imp|pg||
nt|panja: BTW on that 1@S hand, texans managed to get 7 IMPs ...played in 3@D, EW did|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: West of course hopes noth @S and @H placed "unfavorably" - no luck|pg||
nt|sharkey: *both|pg||
pc|sK|nt|garnetts: unless they get the worng hand on lead in a bit--give a ruff and discard--but that won't happen|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|panja: now on third @S, E will discard a @D|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s9|nt|othered1: That 8 by south was an interestinig card.  9 to K, then see, looks right|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|peachy: this could be the first real swing in the match|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: East playing for @DA to be onside - or a possible endplay|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: shd get to the grand here|pg||

nt|vugraphzqe: JM telling partner 4@h cold:) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: bye Dave|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|panja: not easy for N, dbl has the drawback that he does not have @D support|pg||
nt|othered1: Do the players realize just how close this is?  I'd think so.  That can change their attitude towards safety plays that can cost imps . . .|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: indeed 3@c+1@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: GF Stayman?|pg||
nt|vicky888:  playing kokish relay will lead to 7d|pg||

nt|panja: 3@S rather|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: staring at AJ9X IN DUMMY it is correct to play low from a KQ HOLDING and to put an honour up with  k10|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there may be a TD request on that board later|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed....and some people say that overtricks don't count |pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: good observation Vikrant|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: since board 27 the dealing machine has been stuck on the "EW game" setting|pg||
pc|cA|nt|panja: ideally @S lead will be best|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: North came to bid . . . |pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure why Norht bid over 3@D|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|panja: to avoid this problem, S could have weak jumped to 3@D first time|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tez: its problem jt bare if you play udca|pg||
nt|tez: high card shows 3 card|pg||
nt|tez: udca=up side down count attitude|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - this case East will get a second chance when in on @HA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Even if W switches - seeing Qxx in dummy, he should get another chance for the ruff|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sunsamvar: here @Hq is the criticl card|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|othered1: Trump lead looked good :)|pg||

nt|nkgupt:  |pg||
nt|nkgupt: looks like a smoking break|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: brb smoke break|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2nd grand slam in 3 deals and the teaxans have aced it|pg||
nt|panja: was simple bidding in the end with 3 waiting bids to begin with|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: this is a beautifully fitting hand..almost 12 tricks in @S with very few points|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: back|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: our vugraph commentator Roland is famous for bidding such slams :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will North open this 11-count?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: It has been a pleasure Sunil and Mahesh, past midnight. I have to call it a night.  Thanks kibitzers for your helpful comments!!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Tx Raija|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Bye |pg||
nt|panja: considering the difference between the two teams...this is a great performance for Hooda team..|pg||
nt|panja: Grand in @H..will test bidding|pg||
nt|panja: in fact,..N will simply bid it.....all he needs to know is the number of Aces, @H fit...S should not have 4 Diamonds...but not many will bother to check that|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 4@H is good, but easier if south opens |pg||
nt|othered1: I'd like any plus NS, as it's EW's hand in @S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sharkey: Keep us on our toes Pinja :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: what does the 1@H mean Mahesh|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzqe: 1@h alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: Formidables..3-time World QF...and dozens of international appearances..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no - very wise at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|vugraphzqe: 1@h either @s or @c +@d |pg||
nt|panja: Hooda, the 4 playing here, 32 or so average age...|pg||
nt|panja: with the 4@D bid, no chance of checking anyway|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharkey: I assume 1 NT shows 9-11?|pg||
nt|tez: NS playing artificial system|pg||
nt|othered1: now pretty much a matter of overtricks|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hooda also bid the grand on bd 36.. well done|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|panja: this will be 5 IMps+ to formidables|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sharkey: Yes - S doesnt have an opener and opens his 2nd weakest suit:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good bidding - but NOT exciting|pg||
nt|othered1: This isn't optimal for EW, but it will be a plus and should put formidables into the lead with 3 comparisons to go.|pg||
nt|panja: if South held 3343..4 cards in @D....with the same pictures....that slam would not make|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharkey: Worked - EW shut out|pg||
nt|tez: why not dbl to 2@d ?Arle|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 45 and 46 look plus positions|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: venky has all his points in @D and has no problem bidding game over the try|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzqe: will bid ...once partner denies @c K|pg||
nt|panja: or...a  2344 with @SAx....wasted values|pg||
nt|panja: the way the bidding began, no time or space to worry about South's distribution|pg||
nt|panja: bidding 2@C here was not the best idea|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|panja: see what 3@C led to in the OR|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: Apparently Bd 9 more difficult than anticipated as OR failed to bid game as well|pg||
nt|psridhar: one useful technique is to win h ACE at trick 1 and then lay down h king-shows doubleton asking for SPS on the second trick|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzqf: texas  leading 69 17|pg||
nt|panja: S should have shifted to @CQ..with 4 trumps..he is not interested in a ruff, is he?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: JM might think north has @S|pg||
nt|panja: and the King asking was merely a ritual...|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|sharkey: I assume 2@C demands 2@D; N has either an invitational hand or out hand - agree Tez I wud Dbl|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzqe: bulletin is out Panja|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Sandeep and Kaustabh must be thinking that they are more down on this table than they actually are and might take some chances|pg||
nt|panja: I was looking at CBA website..it is not there...and Arvind didn't sent report to Indianbridgecontacts either|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sunsamvar: Tx to our wonderful operator Mahesh in Mumbai and to the organisers for bringing us this broadcast|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Thanks Sunil |pg||
mb|p|nt|vicky888:  Sandip must have given more value to the hand due to 5 carder @c AK|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: and to Roland and bbo for teecasting this premier Indian event|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1NT is a shortness ask|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ty Rajesh Tibrewala|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think that 6@S is automatic to find, but they're on their way . . .|pg||
nt|othered1: If west had a realistic entry, a @C back at trick 2 could lead declarer into a losing play.  But east won't underlead @DAK against slam.|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone know what 3@H and 4@C imply?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: guess controls|pg||
nt|othered1: Have @S been established as trumps?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told 3@H agreeed @S and cue-bid (I guess first round control?), 4@C cue, too.|pg||
nt|panja: so..board 46 will decide|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 46 is 2 imps - 3@C-1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so it looks like the Hooda team will win|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja: if the boys win, that will be first national level DEMICOMA triumph without me or Vivek playing....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that Hooda was 0-42 down after the first set|pg||
nt|othered1: they've played quite solidly after they got back into the match in the second quarter.|pg||
nt|panja: he must go for finessed in @D...|pg||
nt|panja: he is going by the theory S is likely to have 4M, if that is @S, he does not want to give a cheap trick|pg||
nt|nkgupt: venkatesh's 2nt looks better than 2@c other room....here dont know where S found the final raise|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mcarroll: I agree with the 1@S opening, I think it is a bit strong for 2, Butwith the N hand I would bid more than 2"@S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why not 5 @D instead of 5 @H?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: South's 1@S is systemic|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9-14|pg||
