nt|jaheim: må kanskje oppdateres|pg||
nt|jaheim: .........  om en stund, ikke kommet enda|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim swich does it because east is reduced to same trump length as north before aces are knocked out|pg||
nt|lestergold: the club loser couldnt disappear ruffing was misere in any case|pg||
nt|haans: no score in this match this far|pg||
nt|mdgraham: excellent 6@H here. Let us see if EW reach it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@C is playable too, but is an inferior slam|pg||
nt|april7: sorry miscounted|pg||

nt|marlowepi: certainly there are hands where 3N could make and 4HX be a good save -- mostly they start with a longish minor lacking only the ace plus two heart stoppers and enough spade tricks ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to get to nine. but it is extremely pessimistic to save since there are zillions of hands where 3N fails, maybe by several tricks. so if you don;t try for that kind of good result ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when your preempt creates the opportunity, you ought to stop  preempoting|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: vi ligger litt foran :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - problem was S was on lead - likely to favor declarer|pg||
nt|haans: we will not get abid fron West|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sorry, missed a few rounds as I had to get the phone|pg||
nt|april7: might end up in 4@S by NS or 5@H by EW|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: or will we?|pg||
nt|haans: assume X is penalty|pg||
nt|haans: weak openings make it harder for opps to bid their cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: will end up in 4 @H|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|haans: but alerted|pg||
nt|mcarroll: May have lost the @S suit now|pg||
nt|jaheim: so the winner of this match will win the tournament|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharkey: 3@C nå fra N?|pg||
nt|jaheim: to trekte runder av 7 spill først,   så nr 1 mot 2   osv    en rundes forsinkelse|pg||
nt|jaheim: results afer 2. round   http://bridgefestival.no/modules.php?name=NukeWrap&page=http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=Festival2010monlag|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont really understand the defence the play for the ruff wsd pstently hopeless when a forcing game had obviousn prospects|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib points out @D9 a better lead with actual holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffee break hand 4 easy peasy @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Good morning, everybody, from overcast central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
nt|jaheim: D  is prob  3 @H|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sharkey: S ikely to try the 10 here |pg||
nt|haans: good bidding |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Tricky contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: evt   2 nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: Det var vel alternativet|pg||
nt|jaheim: valgte kløvern, hadde fortjent å finne makker med omvendt minorfarger   imo|pg||
nt|sharkey: God strategi å sette press på motstanderne i gunstig sone|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 @H  prob  shoving 3 + @H|pg||
nt|april7: best is to cash 2 top @D and then playing @C ace and @C|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|haans: if they make 1NTx they do not get game |pg||
nt|chick: 4@H looks good superficially, but I think difficult to make.  3@S has no chance.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we can see that spade intervention might make this tricky, but the chance for that has gone|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: technically 4@s is a vbiablem save but who is gonna bid it it could be heading for 800 not agood imnvestment unless you cansee al the cards|pg||
nt|jaheim: S is prob. very tired,  a "old"  (59)  lady playing every day since last friday|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi everyone|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Carl|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: hi Cornelia|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting lead. With no entry to the @Ss and with a limited auction, trying to find partners strength|pg||
nt|rnmalik: indeed. @SJ would have been interesting.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Absolutely|pg||
nt|baardolav: should make even if all the "quesses" goes wrong|pg||
nt|april7: S has to play Q of @H or small @H from dummy to make this contract,because S will not guess stiff K of @C|pg||

nt|henryb:  Hello Hans, Ed|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Henry|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3@s is a better bid than 3@h|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: kib: GRASSHOPI: I'd have preferred X to 3@D me: and then what|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: looks like they are getitng there.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: easy plus for NS, even though you might score a bit more in @S|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps, but I don't like to bid a weak 2 in first seat with such a nice major holding spades here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: no not a perfect |pg||
nt|othered1: For my style, the @D suit is two higher honors short.|pg||
nt|chick: especially diamonds, which rarely has much preempt value|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: Looks like Mr. Voll has lots of work to do here|pg||

nt|chick: bingo|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting, N will probably play J @Cs to try to get an entry to dummy, if W ducks may be held to 8|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: old lady! excuse my wife is 59 in a few weeks and she is still in first flush of youth|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chick: N could have safely led a heart at trick 2, and saved one club ruff, but S is doing it for him|pg||
nt|sharkey: and S will ruff the potential @D trick|pg||
nt|baardolav: David Ueland west Daniel east|pg||
nt|april7: @D @D ruff|pg||

nt|lestergold: slam time|pg||
nt|lestergold: non excuses for ageism triedeness after long events accepted just drink more coffee|pg||
nt|lestergold: hamman won a world championship and he is about 97|pg||
nt|haans: may be hard to beat|pg||
nt|sharkey: N shud have taken @H10 and returned @H9|pg||
nt|sharkey: I thought he was down 1 as dummy provided two discards after @SA|pg||
nt|haans: sort of endplay|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as a very active player, S must be disappointed to be in 4th shair with that hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: At least Helness eventually got a @C trick :)|pg||
nt|april7: I think so too, either ruff in hand losing another 2 @H or ruffing in dummy and losing control|pg||
nt|baardolav: Forget it:) was if Aabye played a spade for the ace... after diamond ruff|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sorry thought the @SAAce had been taken out|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Hvis 15-17 ja|pg||
nt|jaheim: yes   prob 6 @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: give or take a few years that is|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, we're off|pg||
nt|jaheim: no,  4 sp was a walk in the park,   wasnt it?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sharkey: Unless NS jam the auction|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: shouldnt be difficul;t to bid slam here a more interesting hand at mps where 6N by east would be the best spot|pg||
nt|jaheim: stron cl|pg||
nt|jaheim: strong|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good grief, 2@d :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looked like a Muiderberg for S|pg||
nt|april7: S might bid NT over N's overcall of 1 @S and play there|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: Must be "GARBAGE Mulki"...|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 @D   very weaak multi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 5|pg||
nt|sharkey: Liv Marit our excellent operator confirms down 2|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sharkey: Spørs om NS kan få med seg @H stikkene her|pg||
nt|haans: no support x|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2D is the obvious call but it has the disadvantage of letting W bid hearts cheaply|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good hand for transfers faci ng overcalkls|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W passed?|pg||
nt|april7: W should have opened the bidding|pg||
nt|jaheim: My money is on "Filosofene"   any sidebets   ?  :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: @C systems handle east's hand easily.  But if you're willing to open the correct 1@D, standard shouldn't have a huge problem, either.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: *Multi|pg||
nt|lestergold: festering awful wouldnt do it myself at equal vul|pg||
nt|lestergold: here it might make e/w auction difficult|pg||
nt|sharkey: Can't be distributional values either....|pg||
nt|april7: then K of @S extracts last trum, should play @C to hand and the @H|pg||
nt|jaheim: 4 @D from Aabye ?|pg||
nt|april7: now 1NT pass pass pass |pg||
mb|5H|nt|sharkey: Ø dukker en @S og NS må ta beiten på direkten|pg||
nt|chick: it looked same to me, but we trust our operator :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E hates this hand!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but west has a monster over east's bidding so should go on|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well im really getti9ng a full dose of commentatr's curse today|pg||
nt|sharkey: Whar would you bid Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: west's pass verylazy in my view and suicidal in a teams game|pg||
nt|lestergold: im 61 this month and feel about 18 mentally- er physically notm quite that|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@d is a weak multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: K of cl and a claim?|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club at its best|pg||
nt|baardolav: this will make +2 or something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2@d is a Multi, South can respond 2@h (pass/correct) or 2@S (pass/3@h). His hearts are good, could easily have bid 2@s   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: South with long hearts assumes his partner has spades :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@s is natural not forcing in weak multi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can play it that way.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: headed for game not making perhaps|pg||
nt|chick: this can make 4@H but not 5@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lesser evil and pass by E.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Pas probably limits the damage as any EW contract would be pretty expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @S slam can make, but unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: an aggressive lead which on this layout costs a trick|pg||
pc|d9|nt|haans: i have stopped bidding 4@H 30 years ago|pg||
nt|haans: support x better than delayed support|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: i would bid something - choice between 4n and 5H not easy but i would fera missing slam to much not to make a try|pg||
nt|sharkey: @CJ Jan Arne - and claim :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally prefer to use a 2@C rebid after 1@D opening to show a good hand. Gives you room to explore below 3N, at a cost on some natural auctions on lesser hands.|pg||
nt|chick: wow, I would never sell out with S's hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud be off 1|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jaheim: mm  |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: Ø spiller @SK først - ofte "æerlig" fordeling da|pg||
nt|haans: was strong in KS|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C|pg||
nt|othered1: That's my preferred natural system :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: @H lead much better than low spade|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jaheim: mm   5 @D  -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@d can lose spade heart and @d 3n very vulnerable too|pg||
nt|sharkey: Agree - think he shud fight with 3@H|pg||
nt|april7: depends on the play,W might lose 1 @S,1@H 2@D and 1 @C|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jaheim: ja   og ender opp med 2 bet |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: perfectly reasonable as games make on dim finesse|pg||
nt|jaheim: needs a sp lead to win, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n can make dpending on defence 5@d no play at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: except on spade lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Would you x NT after first x by W and pass by E?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W showed the other two suits by x.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think I would find the Pass, but I also think being aggressive is a winner in the long term|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: very little info from auction west has opted for non commital 'safe' trump lead|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|lestergold: spade switch obvious but doesnt matter spade loser cannot go|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mcarroll: AKx trumps lead would have made this a struggle for declarer|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|othered1: At least it simplified the auction.  In standard, south's planned rebid after opening 1@D isn't easy.|pg||
nt|april7: @H switch might cause  aproblem|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jaheim: minst|pg||
pc|dK|nt|baardolav: you have to... else you will sit on 5-1 heart playing with 7-2 in spade|pg||

nt|brolucius: The Ugh team has a lead of 20 (and the +800 in 4@S doubled as a back-up).|pg||
nt|smoller: A spec tells me correctly that he could have cashed @D AK before playing clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: they all know EW to be ahead at this time|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: May try 4@hs liking his xxx@d|pg||

nt|davidstern: A club lead will put paid to 4@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, lots of work to do|pg||
nt|davidstern: Not enough values or fit to recommend 4@H|pg||
nt|jtr: He cant let them steal though|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzna: ugh needs 16 to win|pg||
nt|jtr: West wondering if partner is 4-5M|pg||
nt|jtr: Which would explain his bidding|pg||
nt|davidstern: West may be wondering a lot of things after he sees partner's hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: Pachtman may be wondering if he has been swindled here|pg||
nt|jtr: Like how to manage 10 tricks?:)|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|davidstern: It is hard to imagine where declarer can even start|pg||

nt|vugraphzqy: yes :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Still thinking|pg||
nt|davidstern: but i am prepared to bet where he will finish|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The team names were reversed, that's why we had to shut down and get it right|pg||

pc|h7|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jtr: @h to the 9 seems much better entry wise|pg||
nt|davidstern: Likely lose two heart and two spades from here|pg||
nt|davidstern: Heart to nine feels good but makes ruffing in dummy harder|pg||
nt|jtr: Only one ruff needed though maybe|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think plan was ruff one diamond and pitch one on a club if they are 3-3 and then hook heart back|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@cs, 4@hs @s and @d would work if things were better|pg||
nt|jtr: But tough to hadle things i guess|pg||
nt|jtr: once someone plays slowly it tends to be infectious|pg||
nt|davidstern: Its infected me  yawn|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|jtr: Is there a time limit for a set of 16 boards Gal  Two days maybe?:)|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|brolucius: Maybe it means something different in Norwegian - Roland will know.|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: no, it's the same|pg||
nt|brolucius: I recall that it was the most common word in the Beano comic, which I read for the first 21 years of my life. When I was a student I used to have to hide it inside a copy of the ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Times.|pg||
nt|smoller: He must know the position of @CA now|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: W should have opened a @C according to the system, but chose to show his honour cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: so if @D are to be 3-3, W really needs to be 4-4-3-2, not likely after E x'ed|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Hideous Hog preferred not to show his honour cards, opening in the 'weaker minor'.|pg||
nt|smoller: Best for him to leave @SK stranded in dummy|pg||
nt|smoller: That is in my country named "The notrump prepeared minor"|pg||
nt|vugraphzna: 13 min left, still 2 more boards|pg||
nt|smoller: The Hogs minor opening|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is one of the speedier 1NT contracts, being only 'very slow' instead of 'excruciatingly slow'. The players should be praised.|pg||

nt|lestergold: no game here for anyone|pg||
nt|haans: no simple enough|pg||

nt|jaheim: wow  sidebet from our operator   Thank you   Liv Marit  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznb: weak multi or strong|pg||
nt|haans: Voll right thats a weak 2|pg||
nt|chick: we all know better than to bet with you, Jan :)|pg||
nt|jaheim: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: may keep NS out of the cold @D slam|pg||
nt|april7: just 11 tricks possible, but depends on the lead and continuation|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Depends on what x of 2@D would mean|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1 nt 4 minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 1NT is 8-15 p and at least 4-4 in @c and @d|pg||
nt|april7: do they play strong pass?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|othered1: EW will find 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well this slam wont be missed thats for sure|pg||
nt|othered1: South's double is interesting with that shape and not that many high cards|pg||
nt|haans: odd take out x|pg||
nt|henryb:  Going back to board one, where Lunna mysteriously took 12 tricks in 6N, shouldn't it be possible for big club players to reach 6@c?|pg||
nt|othered1: North has to act h ere and EW may find themselves defending a high @D contract|pg||
nt|haans: big clubs does anything :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: in board 1, Lunna got a diamond in the lead, and South was endplayed in spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose it depends on what you open 2@d on - if you can do it with 5@h, then yes, 2@S natural makes sense |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Kvarngraven 1st to think were are all the cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: ja   hadde gått 2 bet jeg|pg||
nt|jaheim: minst  :)|pg||
nt|jaheim: another slam coming up|pg||
nt|sharkey: 18-19|pg||
nt|lestergold: whether they bid the grand tho is open to question|pg||
nt|othered1: I might rebid @H on south's hand and I think it wins over the long term.|pg||
nt|haans: with u|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some would use stayman as N|pg||
nt|april7: should S open and N passes then E will come in in @H and then  perhaps 1,2,3 NT???|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: hm that will tend to ruole out a heart contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib asked why not open weak 2@H with S hand on Bd 17.  Reason is weak 2 openings 3rd hand NV can be very weak at Expert level, and this was closer to an opening hand.  Also a ...|pg||
nt|sharkey: matter of agreement|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah this may get them to the bad game|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: tror de fleste av oss hadde det|pg||

nt|lestergold: anymore and someone will be in tgrouble|pg||
nt|haans: ty Liv needed that info|pg||
nt|henryb:  Did South really have to act over 1@s Hans?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sharkey: 7@C makes|pg||
nt|chick: I think that hand is much too strong for a preempt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dbl looks like DONT  - six card suit somewhere. Bit thin if it is|pg||
pc|c2|nt|april7: I don't think W should pass 1@D, has 5 P!!! and then 4@H would have been reached making 5 if starts with @S finesse but 10 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|april7: down from top on @S lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sharkey: Gjetter spillet går ut|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|chick: If I get support for either suit, I don't play a 6-5 hand below game|pg||

nt|jaheim: y   13 toptricks,  with 2 sptricks|pg||
nt|haans: dirty bridge|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcarroll: I tend to agree|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7N is technically better as well because if clubs broke badly you would have the spade position to fall back on|pg||
nt|sharkey: 7@S depending on the @S finesse|pg||
nt|april7: but after ruff S is endplayed|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: would have gone on if after 2nt invite|pg||
nt|haans: bridge not like all time|pg||
nt|haans: old|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The last thing Declarer will do is lead trumps, has to try for a semi-crossruff in the red suits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: important to know what these doubles are. After the redouble, penalty is a live possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: EW not agree about bidding|pg||

nt|baardolav: or south can not...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jaheim: tull   kl Q er jo inntak  :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: funnt south doubles and east can probably manage 3@s they bid on to hopeless 4@d and let off hook|pg||
nt|othered1: right, south has a quite sound opening|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|jaheim: y   think cl is trumph|pg||
nt|sharkey: The @S suit has not been mentioned so a mute point|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bid at any raTE ITS GOOD ENUF AT IMPS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe West didn't believe East could have a penalty double of 2@H when he held @HKJ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sharkey: Wonder what wud happen if Jensen opened Multi 2@D here (ref previous board)|pg||

nt|brolucius: Queens and jacks may not usually play full weight, but his @SD-x over the bidder was a useful value.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but West had not shown a sound raise to 2@H, with a cue-bid, and East still made a game try.|pg||
nt|smoller: Now they must take the spade ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: He wouldn't bid again with something like 14, would he?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, but Larsen did re-invite with 3@C|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not in my style but then I don't believe in standard balancing methods|pg||

nt|lestergold: i gain a lot more than i lose by doubling|pg||

nt|chick: of course I'm famous for detesting moysians :)|pg||

nt|haans: but IMP so who cares :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in a short match overtricks sometimes matter|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: it was 8 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: but went quite fast in the end, so don't know exactly how|pg||
nt|haans: no good bid for E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1D seems fine to me|pg||
nt|chick: again, too good for a preempt|pg||
nt|haans: "Not for person below 100"|pg||
nt|mcarroll: now making all his small trumps with the crossruff - contract making|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H p  p  X  p 4@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sound reasonable to me|pg||
nt|april7: on @H lead then 5,on @D ace lead only 4,but bidding might develop differently|pg||
nt|chick: would you jump to game with N's hand over 3@H P P X?  partner is under pressure and doesn't have to have 20 pts for a X|pg||
nt|april7: you are right, but even over 3@S S will bid 4, but thats a different story|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|april7: N might reopen with a X, then S might reach qa @H contract at 3 level, but EW might compete to 3 @S|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: do like 2@S|pg||
nt|jaheim: right|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: form theirmn gross overbidding|pg||

nt|haans: for first time ever(?) can we see that they have no sceens|pg||
nt|haans: Lunna right no opening|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib points out 5@C makes though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is it intermediate?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Hva gjør V?|pg||
nt|jaheim: spar eller ru tro   |pg||
nt|jaheim: hadde meldt rutern jeg|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@D mulig?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Plutselig har Ø et "monster" - så lenge pd ikke har meldt av 3 korts farge|pg||
nt|jaheim: men på 2 trinnet,   3 ru er 5 kort imo|pg||
nt|jaheim: D  =  3 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Surely 4@H is the bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: Spørs hvilke krav meldinger de har til rådighet - hvis 2 NT krav viser farge|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N migh be best on this on NS cards alone, but @H more likely to be found.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: not 2|pg||
nt|chick: moot now as W elected to treat his hand as an opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Good bid by Kvangraven|pg||
nt|lestergold: no lead to beat|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N|pg||
nt|sharkey: S unsure about @C suit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south may be tempted to play this in hearts|pg||
nt|jaheim: or lucky, finding p with 10 of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: if so three rounds of spades with the 9@h ruffing in would not be nice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S seems makeable on trump coup|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: may be even 6...|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would prefer 1@s, but ..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi henry:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
nt|haans: Henry :)|pg||
nt|haans: no alert of 2nt?|pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s would seem to have the advantage that it leaves more room, and your hand is better than a weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was bid as good-bad, but W is not sure. TD at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was not alerted|pg||
nt|haans: can be costly|pg||
nt|henryb:  on either side?|pg||
nt|haans: for EW|pg||
nt|henryb:  the alet I mean?|pg||
nt|baardolav: they did not play that hand...|pg||

nt|sharkey: In 7 board matches overtricks often significant in score|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@c avaialble as cards liem 3n no good|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@c is what i meant to type|pg||
nt|sharkey: or 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: that too but game unlikely to be bid in either back suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S may actually be a better contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: both comntractsb less than 50% no real reason to justify bidding game here|pg||
nt|henryb:  down 2?????????|pg||
nt|haans: will EW try slam|pg||
nt|haans: none at the table :)|pg||
nt|haans: so who are playing?|pg||
nt|henryb:  As a matter of pride now: @cQ to K, @c ruff, @h to Q, @c ruff, @h to A and claim|pg||
nt|haans: webcam off|pg||
nt|april7: 6@D possible if finding right play in @D|pg||
nt|april7: ace was @D was very wrong!!!|pg||

mb|1H|nt|jaheim: snei    alle lagturneringene har vært trege fra begynnelsen i år|pg||
nt|lestergold: another frigid 3n thx to favourable layout of @d suit|pg||

nt|mcarroll: or 6NT|pg||
nt|april7: same with 6NT|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphznb: 1 down in last board|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
nt|henryb:  what I thought|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they reach slam there is no real alternative to the @D finesse|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H by EW losing 2@C and 1 @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: snei   = nei   :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS har god stamp i 5@H |pg||
nt|sharkey: or @D ruff before communications in @C cut off|pg||
nt|jaheim: right|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: hmmay not necessartily be bid here|pg||

nt|haans: 3@D less likely suits are 4333|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S GF|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: three card raise rarer and rarer|pg||
nt|chick: three card raise should be extinct|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes -on review think 5@C better|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not like east's double tend to get into troubole when u faikl to bid ur main asset namely clubs here|pg||
nt|april7: is N considering a X???|pg||
nt|mcarroll: That is a very sporting 2@S|pg||
nt|april7: thats why it will cost a lot|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@H by S - surely not|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rnmalik: Good score in the OR.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: identical auction so far|pg||
nt|jaheim: prob   2 @C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: OK not natural|pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb:  West has, imo, a marginal game force.|pg||
nt|haans: OR in 5@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Mike, all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and with 3 tricks N expects something from pd - He will be disappointed!!|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 9 of 14|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But  6@C seems like a leap in the dark|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: and as u say it may well go off |pg||

nt|lestergold: is east that stromngb that a doubolem is needed before showing the clubs/|pg||
nt|haans: many play 2nt as invite or more|pg||

nt|sharkey: 3@D - 3 NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: OK Natural :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jaheim: 2 hj med 4 kortstøtte,  ja ja, ikke min melding|pg||
nt|sharkey: if East were ready to bid 4@C on 3@D he shud be able to do the same over 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Martin. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@d South African transfer to 4@S....|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcarroll: Hardly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South really playing with fire here. You suspect 3@s would have been passed out|pg||
nt|jaheim: D   is @H lead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: combined 24 points doesnt have to bid game|pg||
nt|jaheim: mm   1 nt opening in W|pg||
nt|chick: at least S didn't draw the fatal (to defenders) club lead by bidding them|pg||
nt|chick: now can N find a heart?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Well Leaped|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|henryb:  but woud you bid less than game opposite partner's opening 1@s?|pg||
nt|chick: booo|pg||

nt|rnmalik: For defence.|pg||
nt|chick: pretty skinny GF by S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: Vet ikke hvor N fant doblingen i Åpent Rom?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C makes - not 6...|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 4@d is forcing, I approve, otherwise 5@d seems indicated|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S was said to be GF\|pg||
nt|chick: if 2@S is GF....|pg||
nt|jaheim: so   10 points  is enough 4 a gf?   strange|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: Fant den her og...|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think South's hand is NTish - wud have tried 3@D to make pd bid 3 NT with @D stopper|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, its frustrating when you find later that you pushed them to a  possibly making game |pg||
nt|april7: @S @S @S the W should discard ace of @C on 3d @D|pg||
pc|h8|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|haans: xy Stayman in Sweden we belive that was invented in Denmark long time ago|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|chick: agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think S should bid 5C over 3D, then he is in position to pass 5D|pg||
nt|henryb:  Suth could not affort Blackwood|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: after the 3@D rebid, most players play 3@S as competitive only - they either double or bid 3@H as a game try|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: 2@D GF|pg||
nt|april7: only hope for E to get in if K or Q of @C|pg||
nt|april7: thats an interesting defence|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: as spec pointsn o9ut he has forced himnself to bid 4@c over 3@d by his pard whcih would be overdoing the hand|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|mcarroll: But on the bidding W may play S for a singleton @S and |pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: East got the clue he neede|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AK@S and @HK pitching 3@Ds and @D finesse and one @C loser.|pg||
nt|april7: 5 of @S = @C entry|pg||
nt|chick: the @S5 should show @C entry|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sharkey: Ingen overstikk her|pg||
