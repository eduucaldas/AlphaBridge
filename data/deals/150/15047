nt|jaheim: hi  all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lestergold: so my first prediction of the day therefore bound to be wrong|pg||

nt|april7: Hi Martin|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT by E now|pg||
nt|jaheim: hi  all   wery weak multi from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznb: NS won Norwegian mix pairs a few days ago|pg||
nt|lestergold: a fiendish layout here agaimnst e/w|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jaheim: runde 2 av det åpne norske mesterskapet i monrad lag|pg||
nt|sharkey: About as far North and South in Norway as possible|pg||
nt|sharkey: good morning Mike|pg||
nt|haans: with amurder|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H did the trick|pg||
nt|chick: pretty brave 3N with only Qxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and to u too Carl|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a tame defence may let this thru|pg||
nt|chick: ouch, and N rescues them|pg||
nt|haans: but ...|pg||
nt|jaheim: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: East elected to bid NV - not unexpected|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame south for making the obvious lead|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 1@D no 5 c M|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: hi all|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: i must admit that as south i would chance a double here i like to earn imps|pg||
nt|jaheim: NS  won the mixed pair chship this year|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and adopting the trend towards 5 rather than 6 card suit|pg||
nt|jaheim: lots of toppairs playing 2 @D as a weak muli   and 2 @H @S as a serious weak 2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: presumably S cannot open 2H, but a more likely alternative would seem to be 1H. cant argue with success though:)|pg||
nt|chick: Pass by S is also an alternative :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very odd to bid 4H when 3N is virtually sure to go down|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: I see 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|lestergold: nom heart ruff but an immediate diamond swirtch and force will be uncomfortabelm fro declarer|pg||
nt|haans: slam possible :)|pg||
nt|april7: very aggressive bid by E|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 @D   prob   1 major|pg||
nt|april7: @S lead would be good,then down|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@H Doubled would have been interesting|pg||
nt|jaheim: ............  and expensive|pg||

nt|lestergold: wehn the lord deals you jt9xx of trumps, he meant you to double|pg||
nt|othered1: 25 HCP and stopped at 2@S.  East's psyche had something to do with it.|pg||

pc|d3|nt|Walddk4: Velkommen tilbake|pg||
nt|haans: why 4@H?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: i prefer 1@H to 3|pg||
nt|chick: with 2 aces and 3 hearts, N must know that 3N is doomed.   must be he thought 4@H was makeable|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case why wouldnt he bid it on the porevious round?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surely E was not going to pass 3HX|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: Results?|pg||
nt|chick: 3@HX is better than 4@H|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Jan Arne, Carl og vores operatør, Liv-Marit|pg||
nt|lestergold: if they find the doubhkle in the other room you are in for a massive loss |pg||
nt|jaheim: and  bronze medals  in the mixed team |pg||
nt|haans: other matches?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk4: and Mike Graham|pg||
nt|april7: loks like only 1 down because of stiff Q of @S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: Needed a @H lead from S - hardly to be expected I think|pg||
nt|haans: but may make Jt9 in @D = good|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed. The system I tend to use is that the Double of 2@D indicates that I was going to transfer to @Hs|pg||
nt|jaheim: EW  currently 2.   NS 4. place|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S thinking, 2 shows an honour, so it has to be either A or Ten, |pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphznb: EW are brothers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this contract does not look to be in danger|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 10 of 14|pg||
nt|jaheim: hi   BOA|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: the play for a ruff iss too slow and north has no entry now to play diamonds so this will make after all|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1. of all    tks to our exelent operator Liv Marit Grude,    and congrat.   with silver medal in the Junior ( baby?)  chship|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: certainly true that Pass is an option for S. my comment about 1H was based on the manifest intention of S to do something other than the textbook pass, so i whould have prefaced my ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: remark with "given that S wanted to be active here...,"|pg||

nt|davidstern: N/S have to get to 3NT rather than 4@H although both will struggle|pg||
nt|jtr: NT would work well here for N/S|pg||
nt|davidstern: Tick|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: Hi everyone and wellcome to the israeli team national cup|pg||
nt|jtr: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Laydown slam, right Peter?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Website http://www.israbridge.com/home/results/2010/mcup10.pdf |pg||
nt|jtr: Hi Gal|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jtr: North may respond 1NT and get raised to 3nT|pg||
mb|4H|nt|davidstern: 3NT is probably all OK making 1-5-2-1 for nine tricks whereas 4@H will lose 2-1-0-1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: ah not easy to bid 1NT over 4@h:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 6@D is pretty good. You need to escape for one trump loser and set up a discard for the @C8.|pg||
nt|smoller: Yes, but must have a little luck in the red suits|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am not a big fan of 4@H as a bid here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jtr: East may have some problems in the discarding department|pg||
nt|davidstern: Too much upside with 19 count to give away|pg||
nt|Walddk5: N-S were members of the Israel open team that won the bronze medal at the European Championships in Belgium in June/July|pg||
nt|jtr: But South may risk all on the @h finesse|pg||
nt|davidstern: Which on the bidding is reasonable|pg||
nt|davidstern: Assuming East plays the @CK South will assume that West has the @CQ|pg||
nt|jtr: He is not the eggs-in-one-basket type of person though:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Diamonds 3-2 or singleton ace with North|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|davidstern: So eschewing the @DQ finesse and simply playing for the @HQ onside looks reasonable|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|davidstern: Hmmm|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|brolucius: You would like more entries to dummy, so that you could benefit from a 4-3 heart break.|pg||
nt|smoller: Need @HK third, or finesse|pg||
nt|davidstern: Undo for me pls|pg||
nt|jtr: Great lead if he reads it|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Or singleton 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: in diamonds that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The intermediates are very good|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|brolucius: A finesse and a good trump break means that the slam is not that good. Still, good enough today.|pg||
nt|davidstern: East can be strip squeezed and endplayed if declarer reads the position|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|jtr: East has pitched his lowest @ss|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|jtr: Not now i think  The @s ruff leaves him a trick short|pg||
nt|jtr: Assuming East plays a high @s|pg||
nt|davidstern: All good ruff next club and cash two trumps what does east pitch|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: the cards are open|pg||
nt|davidstern: Pitches 2 spades from dummy and then if East keeps @SKQ @DQ87 simply ducks a spae|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am backing South to make|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont see how after the @sA is ruffed away|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ah sorry I am alseep spade ruff now|pg||
nt|jtr: East can pitch his @ds|pg||
nt|davidstern: My excuse is that it is late here 22:30 well late for an old man|pg||
nt|jtr: You are hardly old!|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ruff is clear to my mother - if you dont lead partner's opening major you dont have one|pg||
nt|jtr: So no excuse on that part:)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well I feel old|pg||
nt|davidstern: Thats my story and Im sticking to it|pg||
nt|jtr: You are too far away for an argument:)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Anyway its so cold here that is my backup excuse|pg||
nt|jtr: Mid-winter:)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Is East still in the tank?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes around 13 degrees |pg||
nt|jtr: Probably warmer than here though|pg||
nt|davidstern: in the night that is|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jtr: about the same and this is summer!|pg||

pc|c8|pc|h4|pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|davidstern: Maybe the no high low in trumps and declarer's play of Ace King fooled him|pg||

nt|jtr: I play high low as just wanting a ruff|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think he 'reasonably' assumed declarer had 7 trumps the way he and West both played their trumps|pg||
nt|davidstern: N/S need to avoid spades here perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: But how can he beat it if that is the case?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|an|!H transfer|mb|p|mb|1S|an|0-2 !H|mb|p|nt|smoller: Souths hand is missing entries|pg||
mb|2C!|an|4!S|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Declarer may have had Axx AK10xxxxx x Ax was the way to beat it |pg||
nt|davidstern: But then declarer would have won the spade|pg||
nt|jtr: Another @s still beats it|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes ill-conceived defence|pg||
mb|3D|an|invite|nt|smoller: (on a spade elad, or switch)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you lead, guys? A heart or a spade?|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the last hand the heart finesse was a 50% shot. Playing to drop @HK-x-x or @HK-x in either hand must be less than that because you are playing for the king to be in the hand ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: with fewer than half the hearts.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jtr: May get too high here|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: This will still make if they stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Merrimac Coup?|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|jtr: Best lead sort of|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: Who knows the name of the coup: when you dislodge an ace? Ah, Roland does.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David will explain what that is|pg||
nt|smoller: This will be complicate4d|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: You sacrifice a king (maybe) to dislodge an ace that will be a vital entry for declarer. Names after some war-ship that was sacrificed to block the entry to a harbour.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  nice effort by west|pg||
nt|smoller: how to score the tird diamond trick?|pg||
nt|brolucius: The related Deschapelles Coup is where you sacrifice a king to set up a queen in partner's hand as an entry.|pg||

nt|brolucius: I remember the names because I spent a whole bridge career searching unsuccessfully for the opportunity to do one of them.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  @s nine might come into play here|pg||
nt|smoller: Now he can cash his red tricks and play any major|pg||
