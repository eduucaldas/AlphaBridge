mb|2D!|mb|d|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|jtr: Hello people|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Format is Cross IMPs among 12 pairs|pg||
nt|brolucius: East doubles to suggest a diamond lead.|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Puppet (5-card) Stayman auction to uncover the 4-4 spade fit.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: There's a danger of getting too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Nice stop|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brolucius: North has only a borderline slam try, particularly with those 9-high trumps, so he declines to cue-bid his singleton heart.|pg||
nt|finch: Make South's @HK the @SK and even 7@S has play, where here you really want to be in 3NT|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is perhaps surprising that South did not bid higher, since partner had made some sort of slam try and the South hand was pretty good.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|jtr: Maybe 2NT was unlimited?|pg||
nt|finch: The short @DAK are slightly off-putting, with length on your left these may be opposite shortage|pg||

nt|daveharty: if nothing good happens soon for EW, they may start swinging for the fences|pg||
nt|curtsolo: both pairs in the closed room playing 2/1 with strong NT|pg||
nt|curtsolo: in the closed room are Steve Stewart/Paul Pressly sitting EW for Kansas City; Mark Ehret and Lee Hastings NS for StL|pg||
nt|daveharty: lots of tricks in a diamond contract here for EW, if they can get into the auction|pg||
mb|3C|nt|curtsolo: Stack should open 1NT here, which might make that @d partial tough to find|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: you guys doubling back in with E hand here?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|daveharty: no transfer, so it will be up to E to balance...tough|pg||

mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|georgia19: Good Morning all, wow, swift bidding here|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: 4D was explained as a slam try in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Georgia, Gerben and Han|pg||
pc|sA|nt|curtsolo: looks like making the contract demands picking up the @hQ|pg||
nt|phil: with those spades, I honestly wouldnt raise - thats what you want to block out with the raise|pg||
nt|curtsolo: any reason Eakes should find the Q here?|pg||

nt|brolucius: There might have been a slam in clubs, with two losers in spades if that suit is trumps.|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|finch: you can't do everything, it's not always safe to go beyond 3NT with not such a strong hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Everyone is so obsessed with major-suit fits (quite rightly, in a way) that the minor suits get second-rate treatment.|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: 2@C natural, double for take-out of clubs.|pg||
nt|finch: EW here have a 500 save against the NS 4@S contract.  The trick will be for NS to avoid bidding 5@S|pg||
mb|r|mb|2S|nt|finch: 2@C natural and limited.  West might be trying to sow a little confusion |pg||
mb|3C|nt|jtr: 2@s seems a little wet|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@S is not very adventurous.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: wet is bridge slang for underbid|pg||
nt|finch: 2@S doesn't look adventurous, but if rdbl sets up a forcing pass then he knows he can bid hearts next round|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: because it's not going to be passed out|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|finch: but I do agree he was a bit wet on the next round... West's little amusement has worked well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least it's not wet in London, which is good for cricket|pg||
pc|h7|nt|brolucius: N/S managed to fight off the inclination to bid to 5@S that you mentioned, Frances.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|finch: True, at least they are going positive on the board|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Did you enjoy Trott and Broad yesterday?|pg||
nt|finch: The auction demonstrates how a psychic redouble can work extremely well if you pick your moment|pg||
nt|brolucius: One of the best days of Test cricket ever. We watched every ball.|pg||
nt|jtr: I am wondering if 3@c is too much by North though|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, and Pass would not have worked any better than 2@S.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d4|nt|finch: I see they got to 5@S at the other table being shown on BBO|pg||
nt|finch: (note this is a pairs event, so the running imps scores don't mean much)|pg||
nt|jtr: North was not 'wet' there:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, it's just one of five comparisons|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@S was a bit much on his hand. Still, West found a different way to present N/S with a problem.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|brolucius: Of course, you would like to have a singleton in your hand before going as high as 5@C.|pg||

nt|curtsolo: they should be playing 16 boards|pg||
nt|phil: how many so far? |pg||
nt|daveharty: so there is some systemic swing potential|pg||
nt|curtsolo: I like to say that whenever partner gives you an unnecessary raise, it's a compliment to your ability to play the dummy... right?|pg||
nt|daveharty: not the start EW were hoping for|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to P Sridhar (PS)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: the scoring is cross imps|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all thx Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6 tables in play|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 12 of the strongest pairs in the country playing here|pg||
nt|psridhar: is South Bas Drijver ?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Gerben42: Bob Drijver|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bob|pg||
nt|Walddk4: brother|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Bas is playing at another table|pg||
nt|georgia19: that may be a lesson for having only 6 clubs, - and 4spades|pg||
mb|d|nt|daveharty: sometimes hard to shake off a defensive error and concentrate on the task at hand|pg||
nt|curtsolo: EW will not only need swings, but they really can't even afford the nickels and dimes of overberries on those partscores|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Gerben42: Bas playing with Sjoert Brink|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: actually, Bas is playing with Ton Bakkeren today|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: but tomorrow with Sjoert|pg||
nt|Gerben42: okay |pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|curtsolo: pickup chance for StL on this deal|pg||
nt|daveharty: game missed in the other room, so a swing is there for EW if they can find it|pg||
nt|curtsolo: they will have to bid a game, because they won't be interested in defending 2@d here|pg||
nt|psridhar: very aggressive auction by EW -wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: i like this 3@C better than the prev. one, better suit|pg||
nt|georgia19: 3 losers in 5@s, too much to commit to|pg||
nt|Gerben42: before it looked like A23456|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psridhar: it does pay to mix your preempts sure-only u need pd to stay with you on fig out which|pg||
nt|georgia19: yes, agree Gerben|pg||
nt|Gerben42: a tough decision for Tim Verbeek at red vs white|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Gerben42: 5@C is 300|pg||
pc|c9|nt|phil: they might have defended 1N xx'd there for a moment|pg||
nt|daveharty: possibly stack's pass asked for redouble, as an escape mechanism?|pg||
nt|curtsolo: not sure what their runout method is... Stack has the worst possible hand for running out|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Gerben42: or maybe 500|pg||
pc|sK|nt|phil: the double is odd|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: from his point of view|pg||
pc|s4|nt|daveharty: well done by EW|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|curtsolo: the weak NT appears to have actually helped EW on this deal|pg||
nt|daveharty: a nonvulnerable game swing, but it is a start|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but 650 vs 300 is still a lot|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra2: every little bit helps |pg||
nt|Gerben42: but so is -100...|pg||
nt|georgia19: sometimes you just have to stay fixed and take what money there is|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes - better to take money in 5c ; bid 5s when there is bright chance of slam|pg||

nt|vugraphzqg: Paulissen is now saying that he should have alerted 3@d|pg||
mb|3H|nt|finch: It looks to me as if 3@D is intended as a transfer, but possibly the slowness of the auction shows West isn't certain|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|finch: You can see from East's perspective why he thinks 4@H might well play much better than 3NT|pg||
nt|finch: singleton spade, distributional hand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has two options now. (1) He goes down (2) He is the star entry in tomorrow's bulletin.  The former option seems to be favourite.|pg||
nt|jtr: yes, i have sympathy with 4@h|pg||
nt|finch: I can't see how declarer can avoid going down|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not sure i like South's double though|pg||
nt|finch: Possibly Jansma might have inferred that West didn't HAVE to bid 2NT over 2@S and should have the spades well stopped?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good point|pg||
nt|brolucius: South certainly didn't want North to bid 4@S.|pg||
nt|jtr: They might pull to 4NT or you might expose your trump holding|pg||
nt|finch: Declarer has to play somewhat carefully not to go two off, and he must be worried about 5 trumps with South|pg||

nt|finch: scoring up with a lot of 600s, there are 7 imps difference between -200 and -500|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W's problem in the bidding would be solved if they agreed that 3@D is forcing to game (in other words, East gives up the escape to 3@H on a worthless hand with long hearts). In ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: that case West would bid 3@H only with heart support.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|brolucius: But East could just as well have bid 3NT over 3@H.|pg||
nt|jtr: I think Frances' point is the most valid  West did not have to bid over 2@s so must be NT suitable|pg||

mb|p|nt|curtsolo: show the 6th spade?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: perhaps, but 1@S could be 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|curtsolo: West's @h preference could be on 2-2 in the majors|pg||
nt|Gerben42: and its a quacky hand|pg||

nt|curtsolo: she asked for the @d back in case he could get an upper cut with his second ruff attempt|pg||
nt|daveharty: and another soft result for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzqq: Short break|pg||
nt|daveharty: 8 to go and stuck 71...we could be in for some wild actions, or perhaps EW have decided the best they can do is just not give away any more|pg||
nt|curtsolo: I would have liked to see the full auction at the other table - the last hand appeared to be a sacrifice by NS and EW let it go|pg||
nt|curtsolo: then again, with a large lead, no need for Pressly/Stewart to make a speculative double, right?|pg||
nt|daveharty: EW just haven't gotten the sort of hands they need|pg||
nt|daveharty: just a lot of "heads you win, tails we break even" sorts of hands|pg||
nt|curtsolo: while we're on the short break, I'd like to thank all the kibs for joining us, especially the contingent from my old stomping grounds of KC... many partners and teammates are in ...|pg||
nt|curtsolo: the gallery|pg||
nt|curtsolo: and your old stomping grounds as well, Dave|pg||
nt|daveharty: no way for EW to pick up anything on this one, unless Stack opens 1C and it gets passed out, which seems unlikely|pg||
nt|daveharty: yes true Curt|pg||
nt|curtsolo: I suspect 2NT might be Stack's choice here|pg||
nt|daveharty: yes looks like a 2NT hand to me|pg||
nt|curtsolo: I cannot stomach 2@c with Qx of diamonds|pg||
nt|daveharty: a kib asks if south might pass 2NT|pg||
nt|daveharty: it's possible I suppose|pg||

nt|ady: n/s need to find a way to 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Roland   hi all|pg||
mb|3C|nt|curtsolo: one thing you have to keep in mind is that players in your seats in the other room are down big and will press for games|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: with that opening  might get to 6|pg||
mb|3H|nt|curtsolo: so you can't go conservative - you have to press right with them to keep parity|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daveharty: true, although with a huge lead it might be understandable not to press for nonvulnerable games|pg||
nt|curtsolo: standard Puppet Stayman sequence getting them to 4@h here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Diederik van Huijstee|pg||
nt|snowface: thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: EW play very light openings when white, with pass showing a 1D opening|pg||
pc|d2|nt|curtsolo: 3@s showing four card @h suit to get the contract right-sided|pg||
nt|sybarra2: what is Vongsvivut name,  does he have first name?|pg||
nt|daveharty: stack likes the sound of hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzqq: Arba|pg||
nt|curtsolo: first name is Arba (spelling uncertain)|pg||
nt|ady: this should make for the loss of 2 trump tricks  and A@D|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|curtsolo: so much for having the strong hand declare it, eh?|pg||
nt|daveharty: so he makes an advance cuebid, in case partner has greater ambitions|pg||
pc|h7|nt|daveharty: good lead, will hold this to ten tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|curtsolo: all roads lead to 10 tricks... round suits breaking|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|curtsolo: yes, 11 tricks available on non-@d lead it appears|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: 4@H always makes but the natural @D lead made it somewhat easier for declarer|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|curtsolo: I like Arba's choice to attack here|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|nt|daveharty: again, this is NOT what EW need...nothing more discouraging when you are way down than for your opponents to get the cards!|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|curtsolo: a bit easier to attack leading through the big hand... normally when you have 2NT on your right, you would be inclined to defend passively and try not to give tricks away|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h6|pc|d8|nt|sybarra2: we have all been in this situation  (and try to smile all the way)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: still shouldnt rely on partner to raise with the "right hand"|pg||

nt|ady: tes   can stop 2 heart ruffs     2 diamond tricks and 1 club trick  plus 2 trumps from hand 10 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: moment of truth|pg||
nt|xenya:  4-3 @D gives better odds than finesse? |pg||
nt|xenya: other things being equal of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: he knows W is 2-2 in the majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: which makes @d splitting less likely and the club finesse more likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: interesting decision|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D bid and  made in OR  on hand 12    no heart lead|pg||
nt|xenya: on the other hand, W is marked with long clubs...|pg||
nt|xenya: so not an obvious decision|pg||
