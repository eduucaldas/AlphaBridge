nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf  for all results|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|brolucius: Fair enough to open 1@S, rather than 1@D, with such a suit.|pg||
nt|athene: i am not a huge fan of opening the "wrong" suit with these awkward shapes (lower-ranking suit longer, not that strong) but it's reasonable enough i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not sure what problems 1@D can create|pg||
nt|athene: by far the most likely final contract is 4@S and it can help to conceal your side suit from the defenders|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sunit Chokshi|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|brolucius: I suppose that 4@D now would be the other half of a big two-suiter. Ah, he has bid that.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunit: hi all, hi Roland- thx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Swap East's hearts and clubs and he would have cue-bid 4@H over 4@D.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: He would be willing to cue bid under 4@S but not higher than that.|pg||

nt|chick: ouch, and N rescues them|pg||
nt|haans: but ...|pg||
nt|jaheim: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@C of course, partner should have both minors|pg||
nt|pelu: but pass is not an option by N - 2@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: East elected to bid NV - not unexpected|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame south for making the obvious lead|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: 1@D no 5 c M|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Certainly better than this|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S first time - but now N sh have 10+ |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i must admit that as south i would chance a double here i like to earn imps|pg||
nt|jaheim: NS  won the mixed pair chship this year|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and adopting the trend towards 5 rather than 6 card suit|pg||
nt|jaheim: lots of toppairs playing 2 @D as a weak muli   and 2 @H @S as a serious weak 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: presumably S cannot open 2H, but a more likely alternative would seem to be 1H. cant argue with success though:)|pg||
nt|chick: Pass by S is also an alternative :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very odd to bid 4H when 3N is virtually sure to go down|pg||
nt|frankaus: we are too lazy (or drunk) to look to see if the suns out :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: I see 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|lestergold: nom heart ruff but an immediate diamond swirtch and force will be uncomfortabelm fro declarer|pg||

nt|jaheim: 2 @D   prob   1 major|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 4@C should lead to a rapid sign-off from East|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Kushari's splinter is limited, Laltu (East's nickname) did have couple of useful cards, but poor @s suit must have decided to lie low|pg||

nt|npcjpn: This EW pair has been played together for a long time.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: i prefer 1@H to 3|pg||
nt|chick: with 2 aces and 3 hearts, N must know that 3N is doomed.   must be he thought 4@H was makeable|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case why wouldnt he bid it on the porevious round?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surely E was not going to pass 3HX|pg||
nt|frankaus: fairly transparent singleton lead |pg||
nt|rv: He will hop with @DA, pitch @c on @CK, draw trumps and concede a @d|pg||

nt|haans: but may make Jt9 in @D = good|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed. The system I tend to use is that the Double of 2@D indicates that I was going to transfer to @Hs|pg||
nt|jaheim: EW  currently 2.   NS 4. place|pg||

pc|cT|nt|npcjpn: The other pair in open room is relatively new partnership.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: certainly true that Pass is an option for S. my comment about 1H was based on the manifest intention of S to do something other than the textbook pass, so i whould have prefaced my ...|pg||

nt|athene: a suit with some body and a side entry - a diamond lead could be vital against either a suit contract or notrumps|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, or 2@D if that is natural and weak.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: 1@H much better than the old-fashioned take-out double on that North hand.|pg||

nt|sunit: i do not avocate the 1spade bid with a 4/3/3/3|pg||
nt|athene: north will have suspicions about 1@D now|pg||
nt|athene: he has a good 15 count, and his partner's 1nt bid should not be ridiculous|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT shows good values. He would not bid it on some 6/7 points.|pg||
nt|athene: when there appear to be about 60 hcp in the deck, a good rule is "trust the person who is vulnerable"|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, EW look suspicious at this vul :)|pg||

nt|sunit: 3nt should make here|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: you might have the auction 1@H - 1NT - pass for example|pg||

nt|marlowepi: certainly there are hands where 3N could make and 4HX be a good save -- mostly they start with a longish minor lacking only the ace plus two heart stoppers and enough spade tricks ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to get to nine. but it is extremely pessimistic to save since there are zillions of hands where 3N fails, maybe by several tricks. so if you don;t try for that kind of good result ...|pg||

nt|mdgraham: one possibility was to start with 2@H over 2@D, but you can understand the double  |pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: evt   2 nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: Det var vel alternativet|pg||
nt|jaheim: valgte kløvern, hadde fortjent å finne makker med omvendt minorfarger   imo|pg||
nt|sharkey: God strategi å sette press på motstanderne i gunstig sone|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 @H  prob  shoving 3 + @H|pg||
nt|april7: best is to cash 2 top @D and then playing @C ace and @C|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 3@H should make on the nose|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@H last making spot|pg||
nt|frankaus: real tough to find the right strain and level on this 1|pg||
nt|dslee: 2@H is better bid from N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now NS are swinging across the line|pg||
nt|rv: I will fault South's double here more than North's first double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to be fair, this is a very awkward hand for NS|pg||
nt|frankaus: my choice would bre 3NT after the X by N|pg||
mb|4D|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|haans: if they make 1NTx they do not get game |pg||
nt|chick: 4@H looks good superficially, but I think difficult to make.  3@S has no chance.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we can see that spade intervention might make this tricky, but the chance for that has gone|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: technically 4@s is a vbiablem save but who is gonna bid it it could be heading for 800 not agood imnvestment unless you cansee al the cards|pg||
nt|jaheim: S is prob. very tired,  a "old"  (59)  lady playing every day since last friday|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi everyone|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Carl|pg||
nt|pelu: u were right with 3@s :)|pg||
nt|rv: South should either pass (my choice) or bid 3n|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like they will get to 4@H|pg||
nt|frankaus: when in doubt ........... bid 3NT ......... Hamman|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: hi Cornelia|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting lead. With no entry to the @Ss and with a limited auction, trying to find partners strength|pg||
nt|rnmalik: indeed. @SJ would have been interesting.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Absolutely|pg||
nt|baardolav: should make even if all the "quesses" goes wrong|pg||
nt|april7: S has to play Q of @H or small @H from dummy to make this contract,because S will not guess stiff K of @C|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|othered1: easy plus for NS, even though you might score a bit more in @S|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps, but I don't like to bid a weak 2 in first seat with such a nice major holding spades here|pg||
nt|pelu: I see a loser in 4 suits :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, I was just thinking that. He would gain when East held the @D8.|pg||
nt|sunit: that does not help|pg||
nt|athene: but that doesn't work because south's @D8 scores - |pg||
nt|athene: a one-suit squeeze|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sunit: beacause declarer can cover the dia 7 with the 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: true, but we have to consider things that didn't actually happen to inject some interest into 1NT contracts for David|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This can get a bit ugly for someone|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: East will enter but finds partner with 1-1 in his suits|pg||
nt|brolucius: Very considerate, Bill. Thanks!|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Now the bad things are beginning to emerge|pg||
nt|athene: north might not want to double this ( i assume takeout)  in case his partner bids diamonds|pg||
nt|brolucius: Double by South would be take-out - not that he would consider it if the double were for penalties.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you suggest West bids?|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, North can double this|pg||

pc|c4|pc|s9|pc|d3|nt|brolucius: Sri Lanka bid and made 4@H on the 5-2 fit on the deal where we had to endure 1NT.|pg||

mc|10|nt|athene: That can often happen and that is why it's a bad idea to pre-empt with balanced hands - you push opponents into thin games which they then make.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: as a very active player, S must be disappointed to be in 4th shair with that hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: At least Helness eventually got a @C trick :)|pg||

mb|2H|nt|sharkey: Spørs om NS kan få med seg @H stikkene her|pg||

nt|april7: W should have opened the bidding|pg||
nt|jaheim: My money is on "Filosofene"   any sidebets   ?  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: @C systems handle east's hand easily.  But if you're willing to open the correct 1@D, standard shouldn't have a huge problem, either.|pg||

nt|jaheim: 4 @D from Aabye ?|pg||
nt|april7: now 1NT pass pass pass |pg||
nt|davidstern: Not a fan of the pass by W - I would prefer to bid 2@C to let partner know I have values else I will be under pressure later|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Kushari-Laltu play 1n here to show 16-18, hence Laltu Xed instead of 1@s on account of much better @c suit |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a school of thought that 1N sandwich should simply be a strong NT|pg||

nt|davidstern: 2@D by E???|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: will be by S|pg||
nt|pelu: oh - I didn't exp that|pg||
nt|rv: he should pass here, not enough to bid once more esp with some short suit values|pg||
nt|frankaus: red card will apper now|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: but west has a monster over east's bidding so should go on|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well im really getti9ng a full dose of commentatr's curse today|pg||
nt|sharkey: Whar would you bid Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: west's pass verylazy in my view and suicidal in a teams game|pg||
nt|lestergold: im 61 this month and feel about 18 mentally- er physically notm quite that|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@d is a weak multi|pg||
nt|davidstern: Methinks too|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East might bid agin, but if he has bid his hand with double then he has a clear pass chez moi|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: K of cl and a claim?|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club at its best|pg||
nt|baardolav: this will make +2 or something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2@d is a Multi, South can respond 2@h (pass/correct) or 2@S (pass/3@h). His hearts are good, could easily have bid 2@s   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: South with long hearts assumes his partner has spades :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@s is natural not forcing in weak multi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can play it that way.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: wow! pass with void?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At least they can take it 1 down|pg||
nt|iceblue: N misunderstood the DBL|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like NS is not so experient|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 3@D from West?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: headed for game not making perhaps|pg||
nt|chick: this can make 4@H but not 5@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lesser evil and pass by E.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Pas probably limits the damage as any EW contract would be pretty expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @S slam can make, but unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: an aggressive lead which on this layout costs a trick|pg||
nt|rv: yes I agree Laltu should have 2 shown suits with more shape earlier with sandwitch NT or Mich or pass now|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: i have stopped bidding 4@H 30 years ago|pg||
nt|haans: support x better than delayed support|pg||
nt|npcjpn: may be great score in matchpoint.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, North|pg||
nt|frankaus: saved|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i would bid something - choice between 4n and 5H not easy but i would fera missing slam to much not to make a try|pg||
nt|sharkey: @CJ Jan Arne - and claim :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally prefer to use a 2@C rebid after 1@D opening to show a good hand. Gives you room to explore below 3N, at a cost on some natural auctions on lesser hands.|pg||
nt|chick: wow, I would never sell out with S's hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud be off 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: mm  |pg||
nt|Walddk4: But 100 is not much compensation for a missed game|pg||

nt|othered1: That's my preferred natural system :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: @H lead much better than low spade|pg||
nt|npcjpn: dbl by West show @H and some @s?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But can they make 5@C?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jaheim: mm   5 @D  -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@d can lose spade heart and @d 3n very vulnerable too|pg||
nt|sharkey: Agree - think he shud fight with 3@H|pg||
nt|april7: depends on the play,W might lose 1 @S,1@H 2@D and 1 @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D I mean|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if South put the spades down first....|pg||

pc|s6|nt|lestergold: perfectly reasonable as games make on dim finesse|pg||
nt|jaheim: needs a sp lead to win, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n can make dpending on defence 5@d no play at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: except on spade lead|pg||
nt|rv: N-S not clear about their competitive methods, clearly evident from first 2 deals|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Would you x NT after first x by W and pass by E?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W showed the other two suits by x.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think I would find the Pass, but I also think being aggressive is a winner in the long term|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: very little info from auction west has opted for non commital 'safe' trump lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, they have also stopped at the two-level, so double is not needed as any sort of competitive effort|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: spade switch obvious but doesnt matter spade loser cannot go|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: AKx trumps lead would have made this a struggle for declarer|pg||
pc|dA|nt|davidstern: Four rounfs of hearts would have been best|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: At least it simplified the auction.  In standard, south's planned rebid after opening 1@D isn't easy.|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: may keep NS out of the cold @D slam|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: EW will find 4@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: well this slam wont be missed thats for sure|pg||
nt|othered1: South's double is interesting with that shape and not that many high cards|pg||
nt|haans: odd take out x|pg||
nt|henryb:  Going back to board one, where Lunna mysteriously took 12 tricks in 6N, shouldn't it be possible for big club players to reach 6@c?|pg||
nt|othered1: North has to act h ere and EW may find themselves defending a high @D contract|pg||
nt|haans: big clubs does anything :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: in board 1, Lunna got a diamond in the lead, and South was endplayed in spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose it depends on what you open 2@d on - if you can do it with 5@h, then yes, 2@S natural makes sense |pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade partial ERW and Hearts or clubs NS|pg||

nt|othered1: I might rebid @H on south's hand and I think it wins over the long term.|pg||
nt|haans: with u|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some would use stayman as N|pg||
nt|april7: should S open and N passes then E will come in in @H and then  perhaps 1,2,3 NT???|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Obviously the dealing machine is saving the games and slams for later in the tournament ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade lead and heart off dummy would work well for declarer|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 2NT forcing - very sensible|pg||
nt|rv: they play 2/1 as GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm that will tend to ruole out a heart contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib asked why not open weak 2@H with S hand on Bd 17.  Reason is weak 2 openings 3rd hand NV can be very weak at Expert level, and this was closer to an opening hand.  Also a ...|pg||
nt|sharkey: matter of agreement|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah this may get them to the bad game|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sharkey: tror de fleste av oss hadde det|pg||
nt|jaheim: Viego in trbl,  but 1400 in the "bank"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you open with a sub-minimum in 3rd seat, fair enough, at least have a decent suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: NS are playing in my local club|pg||
nt|lestergold: anymore and someone will be in tgrouble|pg||

nt|henryb:  Did South really have to act over 1@s Hans?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: 7@C makes|pg||
nt|chick: I think that hand is much too strong for a preempt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dbl looks like DONT  - six card suit somewhere. Bit thin if it is|pg||
nt|npcjpn: there are many players who does not like pass in 3rd seat even vulnerable (in Japan).|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: I don't think W should pass 1@D, has 5 P!!! and then 4@H would have been reached making 5 if starts with @S finesse but 10 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|april7: down from top on @S lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would rather open 1@H if you forced me to open|pg||

nt|haans: to good effect|pg||
nt|pelu: can West pass?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/25udavr  for running scores |pg||
mb|4N|nt|frankaus: scoring looks to be done by martin wilcox cheif scorer for ABF |pg||

nt|baardolav: no one can ask for aces...|pg||
nt|pelu: plauge or colera, sorry :)|pg||
nt|pelu: plague - new keyboard :(:(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this was because when someone opened the bidding, you could never be certain that they had an opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: her måtte sp K ut|pg||
nt|jaheim: y   13 toptricks,  with 2 sptricks|pg||
nt|haans: dirty bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: I tend to agree|pg||
nt|rv: Laltu's 4N is Quant|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: 7N is technically better as well because if clubs broke badly you would have the spade position to fall back on|pg||
nt|sharkey: 7@S depending on the @S finesse|pg||
nt|april7: but after ruff S is endplayed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so you had to have lots of bids that acted as invites. Partner bid on if he really did have an opening bid, and passed otherwise|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari would have accepted Inv to slam with max (13-14) for his stated minimum (10-14)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|haans: would have gone on if after 2nt invite|pg||
nt|haans: bridge not like all time|pg||
nt|haans: old|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The last thing Declarer will do is lead trumps, has to try for a semi-crossruff in the red suits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: important to know what these doubles are. After the redouble, penalty is a live possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: EW not agree about bidding|pg||

nt|othered1: right, south has a quite sound opening|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jaheim: y   think cl is trumph|pg||
nt|sharkey: The @S suit has not been mentioned so a mute point|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bid at any raTE ITS GOOD ENUF AT IMPS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe West didn't believe East could have a penalty double of 2@H when he held @HKJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now only 10, no entry to dummy to take the diamond finesse when spades are 3-1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Declarer got a diamond lead in the other room|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: Wonder what wud happen if Jensen opened Multi 2@D here (ref previous board)|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||

nt|sharkey: if East were ready to bid 4@C on 3@D he shud be able to do the same over 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Martin. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@d South African transfer to 4@S....|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mcarroll: Hardly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South really playing with fire here. You suspect 3@s would have been passed out|pg||
nt|jaheim: D   is @H lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: It seems the NS style may be to support immediately with 3 spades but I suspect that the bidding is consistent with 3 spades and six clubs perhaps|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: combined 24 points doesnt have to bid game|pg||
nt|jaheim: mm   1 nt opening in W|pg||
nt|chick: at least S didn't draw the fatal (to defenders) club lead by bidding them|pg||
nt|chick: now can N find a heart?|pg||

nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||

nt|rnmalik: For defence.|pg||
nt|chick: pretty skinny GF by S|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 2S was said to be GF\|pg||
nt|chick: if 2@S is GF....|pg||
nt|jaheim: so   10 points  is enough 4 a gf?   strange|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ino may have been better supporting clubs to allow South to better judge the hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: Fant den her og...|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think South's hand is NTish - wud have tried 3@D to make pd bid 3 NT with @D stopper|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, its frustrating when you find later that you pushed them to a  possibly making game |pg||
nt|april7: @S @S @S the W should discard ace of @C on 3d @D|pg||
nt|davidstern: South should now bid six with the @SK and a singleton heart|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|haans: xy Stayman in Sweden we belive that was invented in Denmark long time ago|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chick: agree|pg||

nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rv: this format is not favorite of many of the purists who prefer k/o matches to decide top placings since this format favors beating weak teams comprehensively|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: after the 3@D rebid, most players play 3@S as competitive only - they either double or bid 3@H as a game try|pg||
pc|hT|nt|haans: 2@D GF|pg||
nt|april7: only hope for E to get in if K or Q of @C|pg||
nt|april7: thats an interesting defence|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: as spec pointsn o9ut he has forced himnself to bid 4@c over 3@d by his pard whcih would be overdoing the hand|pg||
nt|april7: W must  pray S having another @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: some would claim|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no claim yet?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mcarroll: But on the bidding W may play S for a singleton @S and |pg||
nt|frankaus: quite a good method IMO|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: East got the clue he neede|pg||
nt|haans: i agree 5@D not 4@D best bid|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rnmalik: AK@S and @HK pitching 3@Ds and @D finesse and one @C loser.|pg||
nt|april7: 5 of @S = @C entry|pg||

nt|athene: Ducking the first round of trumps was a standard defensive move which is often neglected by newcomers|pg||
nt|athene: if you hold Axx or especially Axxx trumps, it's almost always right to hold off the first round|pg||
nt|athene: it just gives you more control over the play if declarer has work to do - i.e. ruffs to take, side suits to get going, as well as trumps to draw|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|brolucius: If instead you win, declarer can sometimes chose a line that depends on drawing exactly two rounds of trumps (leaving one out) before trying something else. |pg||

nt|vugraphznb: the winner of this match will win the ch.ship|pg||
nt|pelu: or to let opp belive that they have a trick|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It is of course against the laws to delay the game unneccessarily|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer ACBL format or initial RR followed by k/o like in World Series, not a big fan of this format|pg||
nt|frankaus: one can still get a "flat pitch" V a weak tem and be disadvantaged though|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ie let him make his own mistakes or no0t as the case may be|pg||
nt|baardolav: need two entries for the heart... |pg||
nt|jaheim: but only 1 entery  to E hand|pg||
nt|baardolav: yeah... |pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: not provide him with a route map to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Rite - and discrading !K at the end position and keeping 3 x @C may have resulted in a set|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last board of this segment, interesting hands as reflected by the respective scores, no unwanted swings.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's written black on white|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But maybe she could not see that she had 11 tricks; that's an excuse|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: The challenge here is to bid game|pg||
nt|davidstern: South got a heart lead and carelessly ruffed a diamond losing all communication with dummy|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: @DK|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 3@h is slamtry with @c|pg||
nt|jaheim: too lata again :(|pg||
nt|jaheim: late|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 7 stikk mulig her|pg||
nt|jaheim: no  3 nt looks ok it playing on @Ds|pg||
nt|henryb:  but would you with AKK and four trumps, a couple of extra jacks and a doubleton?|pg||

nt|mcarroll: a good 6 @D possible?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: if   playing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or 6NT? with 12 tops?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A bit surprising nobody found the red card after 4@S in OR|pg||
nt|npcjpn: vulnerbale, second seat and bad suit...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could cost a packet, of course |pg||
mb|3D|nt|haans: as all others try for game|pg||
nt|sharkey: S bid 2@H OR|pg||
nt|henryb:  I remind kibitzers that while I deeply appreciate comments I will not respond to anyone who does not have the courtesy to put their full names in their profile|pg||
nt|april7: switchto @H is best|pg||

nt|davidstern: I took an oath never to bid 3N T with a void in partner's suit but that was in 1975|pg||
nt|davidstern: I should say I have stuck with it ever since|pg||
nt|pelu: borderline 2@D (Michael) in Red|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Amazing, EW sold out to 2@S on board 6 in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: as would I|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will get to game now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West doubled 1NT, then she doubled 2@D and then she passed 2@S|pg||
nt|rv: Laltu should pass here, not enough for raise to 3@d in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2NT Invitational Values min @S and 4 card support|pg||
nt|april7: but cross ruff is already open|pg||
nt|npcjpn: @dQ and @CK are great card for East.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: but needs to lead a @D, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of this session has been when you are dealt a double then double|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why didnt S bid 3 NT?|pg||
nt|haans: invite or not invite that is the question|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H prermpt in my book|pg||
nt|chick: after the X, 2@H shows 8+ in my book :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: last board in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2 matches to go|pg||
nt|mcarroll: After I predicted a flat board on 6 I hesitate to say anything here - But............|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1   i think   ,  Liv Marit|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: yes, you're right jaheim|pg||
nt|april7: I think losing at most 2 @S and 2 aces|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: one more match|pg||
pc|h5|nt|davidstern: And even then......|pg||
nt|npcjpn: @D to 9.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: East should have @CA instead of @CKJ to bid 3@D.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, and a trump short as well|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks a too round for my liking|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: AKK is extra in it self|pg||
nt|henryb:  better case at matchpoints|pg||
nt|sharkey: We would all lead @HQ vs 3 NT and set it....|pg||
nt|chick: and I have a known double fit in the majors (assuming a normal takeout double)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 2@D to show both M and some points|pg||
nt|haans: yep good for 2@D instead of @H bid|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: im on Volls side|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Depends what 2NT showed|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: there has been a fair amountg of no trump avoidance too|pg||
nt|sharkey: May work out ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: im susrprised that 3n failed in open room|pg||
nt|haans: yes at IMP you seldom pass before game|pg||
nt|chick: that would also work if such agreed|pg||
nt|sharkey: This won't be easy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True Roland|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS wil be quite pleased to gain an imp after going four down vulnerable in a freely-bid game |pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: Solves trump problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ive checked play first took club the unatural way then after spade switch took a secons spade finesse rather than dim finesse when defenders had warned himn that spades were ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: both 'wrong'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, the cardinal sin, Mike. Declarer had his contract but went for overtricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Viego will suffer their first defeat |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  if partner signs off the game may be less than 50%|pg||
nt|davidstern: South will switch to a spade at a million miles and hour if East plays another diamond |pg||
nt|pelu: yes KJ no value when pd 5-5 in major|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf  for results|pg||
nt|pelu: a major Q better than @cK|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: i see contract failed in open but surely playing on clubs declarer should make this|pg||
nt|haans: you need a good 50% to bid non vul games|pg||
nt|haans: better bidding than OR|pg||
nt|pelu: ??????????????|pg||
nt|npcjpn: East probably hoped miracle AQ in majors.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sophia is lucky that this does not cost the contract|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: play for split honours in clubs shoul lose a heart a club and a diamond at most|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board for the match. Back in 10-15 mins|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: Had to lead @D9 for a set|pg||

pc|hT|nt|april7: now almost 4@H|pg||
nt|pelu: but she is almost endplayed |pg||
nt|npcjpn: the other 8 is better to shift.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: She had 3 to choose from :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South may have protected with 2@H, of course|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mcarroll: Extraordinary set, 53 imps in 6 boards - and more to come!!|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 20-22 maybe|pg||
nt|april7: 1@S and 2 aces, sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: "Set up your side suit first" is a good rule|pg||
nt|npcjpn: strange play. @HA then low and guess.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sharkey: Ø må spille på at N må ha begge Ess for å vinne kontrakten|pg||
nt|lestergold: it wasnt for overtrick played for split spade honours rather than dim finesse which a priori was better odds but suspicous on the dfence|pg||
nt|sharkey: First make your contract - THEN overtricks...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Liv Marit!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|haans: evry tim you do wrong Have a talk with p|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Winning the ace was strange for a start|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: 9 dimds would be a better card to play by east|pg||
nt|sharkey: killing lead - but nobody lead high from xxx??|pg||
nt|pelu: why not play @C8 - only chance is to find Q10x in C in N = discard for 3@Ss|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mike, BOA and Martin|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now North knows South has another spade, so the defense is not tough.|pg||

pc|d3|nt|lestergold: we are seeing a lot of card play shall we say less than perfect plays in this match|pg||

nt|jaheim: and it will be a pleasure tu buy   Liv M a beer next year   tx  all   and cong. to team   Ugh|pg||
nt|rv: East (Deb Majumder aka Laltu) is the youngest member of the team, he is in his early thirties and this is his first Intl tourney|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|brolucius: You might treat the West hand as a 15-17 1NT. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|athene: Yes, that would be fair enough.  Certainly it's a 13-15 or 14-16 NT, which I assume E-W are playing with their strong club.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps they play 14-16, since they are using a strong 1@C.|pg||
nt|sunit: only a spade lead could have possibly beaten it|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe not|pg||
nt|athene: South might have doubled for a spade lead if he was feeling in need of a swing board, but it would be very aggressive.|pg||
