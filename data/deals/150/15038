nt|andyv:  lead helps|pg||

nt|voldenuit: 3@c 3@d and 1@s it's seems |pg||
nt|andyv:  entries are the problem.... S needs to lead towards his @ds and @h (although opps may break @hs for him).|pg||
nt|psridhar: a h lead was best for defense and that was the only suit the leader held|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not shure by the system NS. Often best minor and then @D can be at 3 cards so 1NT stop is ok |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: but Rehder goes for the stronger suit |pg||

nt|andyv:  S might dbl here (responsive)|pg||
nt|psridhar:  S has a gud hand but no suit to bid and stuck for a bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed, double would be penalty I suspect|pg||
nt|psridhar: X seems the optimum action but with 3-3 in minors that has its own risks as well|pg||
