nt|rv: looks to be another and possibly easier 3n|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: can 6c make rv?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rv: not enough hcp or big fit for 6@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Can't make and should not be bid either|pg||
nt|rv: I can't see 12th trick in 6@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: doesn't seem like enuff power to get past 3n/t|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|psridhar: some respond 1s on kista's hand and if opener reverses into 2h liking his controls then they wd steam into slam in clubs|pg||
nt|mr murray: no 12|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|rv: here 2@s is 4th suit GF, possibly 1@s is nat NF in their methods here|pg||
nt|mr murray: getting a bit dangerous now :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rv: Kista's 3@d is adv cue for @cs?|pg||
nt|psridhar: EW in other room were warned by a take out X ( ? ) on N hand|pg||
nt|mr murray: yep|pg||
nt|mr murray: neither will like the others red suit bids|pg||
nt|rv: not sure why Kista is not bidding 3n after partner shows @d shortage|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would 2NT mean by Venky over 2@S 4th suit?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C is dangerous|pg||
nt|mr murray: I think 3 clubs sencible to bid out shape as he hasnt to this point shown any extras|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3NT next shows a dubious spade stopper in my book|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@c is the normal bid - and just give West @cK and not @hK - then a lot of play for slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as he did not bid 2NT before|pg||
nt|psridhar: if u r in the habit of bidding 1nt with a major over 1d response, then 2nt over 4th suit is ok -else 2nt can come on flat hands 3-4-3-3 shapes too|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mr murray: should make but cant get careless|pg||
nt|psridhar: even 5c is not a cakewalk|pg||
nt|rv: I agree with 3@c by KRV, don't like Kista's 3@d and 5@c|pg||
nt|mr murray: not by any means|pg||
nt|mr murray: I like the bridge God that said 3n/t ends all auctions:)|pg||
nt|rv: much prefer 3n to limit hand with good @d stops|pg||
nt|psridhar: as it is 5c is skating on thin ice; that diabolical spd jack lead makes it worse|pg||
nt|rv: Rusinow leads here|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Rusinow leads, J promises Q|pg||
nt|psridhar: oh jack from rusino? ok i thght false card|pg||
nt|rv: let us confirm with Buddy|pg||
nt|vugraphzqf: rusinow|pg||
nt|psridhar: ideal situation for false carding on lead- he has all the hcp and pd is not likely to play much role in defense|pg||

nt|vugraphzqe: play slow as usual on this table|pg||
nt|arunbapat: I think they play Demicoma with some variations |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all. Strong come-back from the Hooda team, 42-0 down after the first set|pg||

nt|vugraphzqe: waititng for this board to finish ...play still on|pg||
nt|panja: 1@D opening promising some 4-card Major, 1@H natural..|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: other s/f Texan Aces up by 30 imps|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: The West hand is an advertisement for having a bid to show a one-suiter over 1NT, as you can always rely on pd to be short in the suit you want him to lead in thi s auction|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Vijay|pg||

nt|arunbapat: will Satya come out to 3D I guess he will.|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|panja: with this score, EW should be taking chances, and NS, playing safe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Mumbai|pg||

nt|nkgupt: hi mahesh/panja/ all|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Hi NK |pg||
pc|d2|nt|panja: if N leads to S, and S shifts to @D...this will go down many|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: Good to see you all|pg||
nt|nkgupt: hi roland|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|panja: but if @S are continued....it will be interesting|pg||
nt|panja: this will make 10 tricks for 630...what would 1D XX have been?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panja: satya found a good lead|pg||
nt|panja: the @D shift will be difficult to find though|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: other s/f texanaces up by 19|pg||
nt|panja: the bidding does not suggest N could have 6 @D|pg||
nt|panja: so....Kiran is more likely to return a @S..??|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: waiting|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: shuffling between @s n @d|pg||
nt|panja: y, @H or @C unlikely, looking at the Dummy|pg||
pc|c3|nt|panja: note how the system kept South in dark|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|peachy: This looks like Strong Club auction, surely is|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Other s/f Formidables vs Hooda|pg||
pc|c4|nt|panja: S should not have doubled, true, but having doubled, if S had a better idea of N shape, she would have found the right defence|pg||
nt|panja: deal is not over yet though....W needs to find @HA still, quite likely, he will|pg||
nt|arunbapat: I think satya should have played if safe by taking out to 3D.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|panja: after S plays @CK..there is little chance W will go wrong in @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: +|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i suppose after the neg 1@D response it was too much for Ashok to push on to slam|pg||
pc|h4|nt|peachy: declarer will play spades from top, no finesse even evailable|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: ND END UP WITH 11 TRICKS|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mcarroll: Good switch|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hawe45:  50 - but E/W have an easy 90 in 2 @C|pg||

nt|psridhar: why no play? def can only get a h and a spd from here|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: but here he is partnering the vetran Ashok|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S for NS in B14, 5@D sac for EW...could go down many though|pg||
nt|garnetts: employed a variation of the Kokish style relay |pg||
mb|1H|nt|panja: 4@S will be a good spot here|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: n/s playing 2/1 ...e/w demicoma|pg||
nt|panja: after the 1@H opening, it will be a struggle to find @S spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: waiting for the tray...now with n/e|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: still waiting|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Cambridge Precision did that in the late 70's :) |pg||
nt|garnetts: Dates you Mike :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes :(|pg||
nt|garnetts: not alone :(|pg||
nt|garnetts: seems to be taking for ever --must be a technical problem I suppose|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|coolvijay: JM has been playing with Ashok quite regularly prior to his joining Texanaces|pg||
nt|panja: 1@D promises a 4-card Major here|pg||
nt|panja: so E has bid 1@D because of his 4@H, not to show his long @D|pg||
nt|panja: ideally, he should have opened 2@D here to show Diamonds..|pg||
nt|arunbapat: may be they are not playing Demicoma or this may be the variation Panja|pg||
nt|panja: E had cannot see any advantage in playing in @H in preference to @D|pg||
nt|panja: well, with this hand, the opening is a matter of choice....|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: waiting for satya to bid|pg||
nt|panja: no alert on 1@D Mahesh?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|d|nt|sharkey: @H lead will set 3 NT - anything else it may make|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: not alertd by kaustabh|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: alerted|pg||
nt|panja: it does not show up here...|pg||
nt|panja: ok...then it must be natural...not demicoma|pg||
nt|panja: 1Nt F, 8+, but here E seems to have taken a liberty|pg||
nt|panja: he should not have a void for 1Nt bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Set?|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - always a make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning Hans|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Morning - I just had a wake-up call - by Sharkey...|pg||
nt|sharkey: :)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: doubt if 4@s can stand repeated forces w/ @d / unless play for complete crossruff|pg||
nt|panja: good pass..this might solve a problem|pg||
mb|3S|nt|peachy: 3D will be quite enough|pg||
nt|panja: will make if @S is not led..|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: "mislook"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: sorry ...will claim ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: missed the play....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S looks a bit of a punt, but the East hand fits well|pg||
nt|othered1: was 2@S constructive here?|pg||
nt|panja: I guess only @Sk lead will beat it|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraph814: Bonsoir nous voici au BCSH meilleur club de paris pour un duplicate en étoile tous les joueurs sont donc associés a nos 4 champions|pg||
nt|garnetts: I know that in France they employ a short club and rebid majors--but I agree with Mike it is dreadful--must show 5-4 in my view when you bid two suits|pg||
nt|garnetts: Bteer to rebid 1NT and employ checkback|pg||
nt|garnetts: better I mean |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there was some debate about this recently - two vociferous (and diametric) points of view|pg||
nt|panja: 2@S was const...|pg||
nt|othered1: That explains the simplified (and effective) auction.|pg||
nt|panja: I thought there would be a temptation to play in Nt, but Prabha has chosen not to opt for Nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|coolvijay: oh thats a bold bid by Ashok|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: this can make so bldness pays off|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i agree since a void in parners suit is not an asset and West cus have only 3@D|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: trump shift now|pg||
nt|peachy: Surprised that initial trump lead was not made, with those spades|pg||
nt|peachy: kibitzers scream that it was screaming for a trump lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: Kayzad Thinking|pg||
nt|panja: but then, you could give @H open and still make|pg||
nt|panja: this shd be a make too...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|panja: this is a tricky game...|pg||
nt|panja: to avoid trump promotion...W must ensure S does not get in|pg||
nt|panja: so...it is essential to play !Q or J first time, not A|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|coolvijay: oh thats something different|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzpx: NS plays strong club, 1@c = 15+ from 1st/2nd and 19+ from 3rd/4th|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|panja: this is not a good approach...where are his 10 tricks going to come from?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: decl thinking|pg||
nt|panja: not @SK? difficult to believe that|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peachy: Doubledummy, we see of course it is makeable now, but declarer has some figuring out to do|pg||
pc|s9|nt|othered1: Some might open a strong NT with west hand.  After the start, do they have a way to 3N?  Is 2N natural over the raise?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|d3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|coolvijay: now seems that JM has the tempo to cross ruff the hand|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|panja: I don't know the details of EW methods|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|panja: this was the danger...this is why @CA first time was not a good idea|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Sehwag stranded on 99, how cruel. On the other hand, maybe you can live with it when you win|pg||
nt|psridhar: he hit a 6 and hoped his score wd be 105 but rules disallowed|pg||
nt|psridhar: it was a noball|pg||
nt|psridhar: 'deliberate' no ball per sehwag !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, so the no-ball comes first |pg||
nt|rv: it is a technicality, maybe once last ball is bowled, match should not end till that ball is dead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1 run|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's how the rules are|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The match is over once the no ball has been called|pg||

nt|panja: what else after the 3@S cue NK?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: possible there that East assumed a six-card heart suit for the 2@H rebid - or at least a stronger heart suit. KJ looked good support |pg||

nt|mdgraham: maybe West might have bid 2NT instead of 2@H, as he did have a diamond stop, even though it was anti-positional|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, after bididng the 4th suit, 3NT would have shown the East hand quite well. Very difficult, in other words |pg||
nt|garnetts: True Mike but 2@H is a utility bid in my view--if not then 2@S was the better rebid--that is very likely to be a doubleton|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  But @D-finesse|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - @D finesse needed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But you do need the @D finesse and trumps 3-2, so a reasonable bet|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer will have to take S finesse for his 12th trick, and since nothing else is available, he will|pg||

nt|mdgraham: the OR seems to be stuck on board 28|pg||
nt|othered1: they did get to and score the better game|pg||
nt|garnetts: They had a rather better auction in my view |pg||
nt|garnetts: It was actually quite an interesting hand because in my view 2@S always shows a doubleton--3@S 5-4-3-1 with extra values--since a minimum 5-4-3-1 can always bid 2@S initially|pg||
nt|vugraphzqe: back |pg||
mb|1N|nt|mcarroll: 4@H looks good|pg||
nt|peachy: choice of strategy, splinter and set trumps or bid spades and subsequently force to game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: another 4441 hand|pg||
nt|panja: 1@D opening yet again for NS...if W allows N to open that is|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraph814: Pour plus d'informations : http://www.bcsh.fr/accueil/index.html|pg||
nt|vugraph814: BCSH : bridge club saint honoré : meilleur club de Paris pres de la porte dauphine|pg||
nt|panja: tricky hand, NS could easily go overboard...|pg||
nt|nkgupt: no bid 3@s....asured of being in a 9 card fit w/ 21 or pd having 5/5 w/ 8 cards and a second suit|pg||
nt|nkgupt: w/ min good 18+|pg||
mb|2D|nt|panja: so 3@S with 18 BAL opposite 2...|pg||
nt|nkgupt: +9 card fit|pg||
mb|d|nt|panja: 1Nt, F, 8+ HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW will be going to at least 3@D|pg||
nt|panja: 2@D stiff or void Diamond|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|nkgupt: is the original TNT to be there|pg||
nt|panja: and what do you do with 18, 5-card @S, or 16 5-card @D, always open 1Nt with 5 Spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: this splinter is unwelcome to Shah |pg||
nt|mdgraham: would pass by North here say "no preference, you choose?"|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: AK opposite singleton weighs as much as an Ace alone, except for added protection|pg||
nt|othered1: Why did east keep his @D out of the auction?|pg||
nt|panja: 5-card @S rather|pg||
pc|cT|nt|othered1: I agree with your analysis of that hand, but it's not universally accepted.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: was 1@d natural? If so, odd that East didn't raise|pg||

pc|hA|nt|garnetts: Prefer 2NT to 2@S initially|pg||
nt|garnetts: anyone for passing 3NT on the East hand?  |pg||
nt|panja: 1@D could be 3 Diamonds at shortest, could it not?|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess, and then the double of 2@D by west?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: possible, but 4@S looks normal enough|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|panja: not easy for N, dbl has the drawback that he does not have @D support|pg||
nt|othered1: Do the players realize just how close this is?  I'd think so.  That can change their attitude towards safety plays that can cost imps . . .|pg||

nt|sharkey: GF Stayman?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|panja: 2@H shows 3@D, 4@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|sunsamvar: staring at AJ9X IN DUMMY it is correct to play low from a KQ HOLDING and to put an honour up with  k10|pg||

pc|hA|nt|panja: to avoid this problem, S could have weak jumped to 3@D first time|pg||

nt|tez: udca=up side down count attitude|pg||

nt|panja: considering the difference between the two teams...this is a great performance for Hooda team..|pg||
nt|panja: Grand in @H..will test bidding|pg||
nt|panja: in fact,..N will simply bid it.....all he needs to know is the number of Aces, @H fit...S should not have 4 Diamonds...but not many will bother to check that|pg||
mb|1D|nt|othered1: 4@H is good, but easier if south opens |pg||
nt|othered1: I'd like any plus NS, as it's EW's hand in @S|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sharkey: Keep us on our toes Pinja :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|sunsamvar: what does the 1@H mean Mahesh|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzqe: 1@h alerted|pg||
mb|3C|nt|panja: Formidables..3-time World QF...and dozens of international appearances..|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|vugraphzqe: 1@h either @s or @c +@d |pg||
nt|panja: Hooda, the 4 playing here, 32 or so average age...|pg||
nt|panja: with the 4@D bid, no chance of checking anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: I assume 1 NT shows 9-11?|pg||
nt|tez: NS playing artificial system|pg||
nt|othered1: now pretty much a matter of overtricks|pg||
mb|4H|nt|panja: this will be 5 IMps+ to formidables|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Yes - S doesnt have an opener and opens his 2nd weakest suit:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good bidding - but NOT exciting|pg||
nt|othered1: This isn't optimal for EW, but it will be a plus and should put formidables into the lead with 3 comparisons to go.|pg||
nt|panja: if South held 3343..4 cards in @D....with the same pictures....that slam would not make|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Worked - EW shut out|pg||
nt|tez: why not dbl to 2@d ?Arle|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: tx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 45 and 46 look plus positions|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzqe: will bid ...once partner denies @c K|pg||
nt|panja: or...a  2344 with @SAx....wasted values|pg||
nt|panja: the way the bidding began, no time or space to worry about South's distribution|pg||
nt|panja: bidding 2@C here was not the best idea|pg||
pc|c3|nt|panja: see what 3@C led to in the OR|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sharkey: Apparently Bd 9 more difficult than anticipated as OR failed to bid game as well|pg||
nt|psridhar: one useful technique is to win h ACE at trick 1 and then lay down h king-shows doubleton asking for SPS on the second trick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzqf: texas  leading 69 17|pg||
