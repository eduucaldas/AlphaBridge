mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Hi Bill|pg||
nt|athene: looks like canap√© for NS|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: they end in the same contract as everyone else, but just played the other way up|pg||
pc|hT|nt|benjent: I don't have a system card for either pair, so I'm going to fake it for a few boards and hope no one notices|pg||

nt|athene: west has the right idea - force the long trump hand in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: he knows his partner has four trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzqg: some name confusion, the table number lies wrong and all names are wrong at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzqg: Verhees is van Prooijen and Hop is de Pagter :)|pg||
nt|athene: however, if east returns a club here, declarer can simply throw a diamond from dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzqg: I will solve it asap|pg||
nt|athene: the @CJ would have been a more effective return|pg||
nt|benjent: West needed to return @cJ to retain the lead|pg||
nt|benjent: snap :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes, just to neutralise the @CQ|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|athene: now declarer draws trumps and bashes out @DAKx|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|benjent: @h return was like the opposite of what they wanted to do :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: ok small here, diamond to ace, draw trumps, then @DK, diamond|pg||

mb|p|nt|pamela: hi everyone|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzqh: fewer conventions but hopefully not less interesting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this avoids opening 1 @D with a horrible 3 bagger,  so a 1 @D openin promises 4 |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzqh: Drijver against Drijver means lots of table talk|pg||
nt|sybarra: pesky that the @s are 4/1|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Throw in Brink and you get even more|pg||
nt|pamela: are they using screens? |pg||

pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|h3|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@H now shows it well if that is constructive|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you might bid it even if it's weak - you will miss game occasionally but not that often|pg||
nt|psridhar: if 2H was pass or correct in maj, then S did well passing it|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psridhar: close to 4h actually, but only 9 tricks as cards are|pg||

mc|9|nt|athene: if you played a small club after the queen, and east had @CKx, he could return a spade and take the entry out of dummy whilst the clubs were still blocked|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: whew,  that one club would have been a bit much for me red !|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pamela: might look for game here if he finds a fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: n/s are fighting for second place,  after rd 8,  I do not have scores yet after round 9 |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4-5 in majors I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: weak both majors, never 5 spades and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: so south would not correct with equal length|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: in other words, south is 3-2 in the majors almost surely|pg||
nt|sybarra: looked like junk stayman to me |pg||
nt|sybarra: btw, Han,  West should be Bob Drijver right? |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Gosschalk ducks to remain in control|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: if they continue spades, he can ruff one, if trumps are pulled first, they won't be able to cash them|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of @S's to be 3/3 I guess |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pamela: always hard to know what to do on these hands   coz with the right cards games can make - I see games in every hand though :-))) |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|c8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I probably had ignored the 4-5 in majors and decided to play on 5-2+ as N|pg||
nt|sybarra: so you are an optimist (like me) |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|xenya: now he is down -- but could he make it at all on this defence?|pg||

pc|h9|pc|s7|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: i am beginning to get a handle on NS system - the only suit south is allowed to bid is diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|athene: not everyone would bid 4@S with that east hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: but it is going to make if he can guess the layout|pg||
nt|athene: even if you anticipate a friendly (i.e. non-heart) lead|pg||
nt|athene: he will surely go for the ruffing finesse in diamonds|pg||
nt|psridhar: finesse either dia OR club to make-only dont take ruff fin of dia :)|pg||
nt|benjent: @d finesse is the odds play through the opening bidder|pg||
nt|blum1956: What was a precise meaning of the 1@d opening?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
nt|psridhar: he has postponed the decn temporarily|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|blum1956: time to decide|pg||
nt|athene: south switches to the @HJ perhaps to try to conceal his holding, to make it look more likely he has the @DK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|hT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: but i think the queen had more chance of deceiving declarer|pg||
nt|henryb:  Sorry I'm Late. Gm All|pg||

nt|pamela: I know ( wink)|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|vugraphzqh: I wouldn't be surprised to see some pairs getting to 6@c here|pg||
nt|sybarra: typing same |pg||
nt|sybarra: but no place to put the extra @D from the N hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: say if N passes (which he wouldn't with this hand) should S bid 4NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: I would bid 4 N for the minors,  6/5 come alive  |pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: N was never able to show values so south didn't even consider bidding slam|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: all this takes to make 6 is @D's 2/2 really |pg||

mb|r!|an|3!h|nt|benjent: This is a novel hand - NS actually had @d when they opened 1@d :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably four?|pg||
nt|athene: might go straight to four, on the basis that opps are likely to be bidding 4@H anyway|pg||
nt|psridhar: focus also on how many hearts will NS bid|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|psridhar: 3s is a gud pressure bid but perhaps purists will like a 6th spd for that|pg||
nt|blum1956: West may see four tricks for the defence |pg||
nt|blum1956: but sometimes his side makes 4@s|pg||
mb|d|nt|psridhar: if declarer doesnt drop cl king offside in 4h, it can be beaten by 2 on trump leads|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: not an easy job|pg||
nt|athene: he has a pretty defensive hand, given that he doubled 1@D-1@H for takeout|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: so it would certainly be illogical to bid 4@S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|blum1956: poor lead|pg||
nt|benjent: Well, unsuccessful lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: disastrous for defense|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|blum1956: still the contract is far from being safe|pg||
nt|psridhar: that h10 talked him out of h lead...|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to find a rationale for not leading this - east should have five weak spades for his action (pass 1@D then jump) but still it's always easier when you see all the cards|pg||
nt|henryb:  The @h 10 will almost certainly take a trick now|pg||
nt|benjent: Some days you need to cash @sA before the mice get at it|pg||
nt|benjent: And maybe partner just has some @s suit like Kxxxxx and didn't feel like putting his head on the chopping block by opening a weak 2|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably the result depends on a club guess now|pg||

nt|vugraphzqg: CR Bas Drijver-Brink vs Danny Molenaar-Anton Maas (substitute for ill Merijn Groenenboom)|pg||
nt|benjent: yes ... but he STILL has work to do|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|psridhar: whats left? concede 2 trumps and a club?|pg||
nt|benjent: can he turn down the @c finesse now?|pg||
nt|benjent: If not, the @dQ is hitting the deck|pg||
nt|psridhar: take the club trick no problem|pg||
nt|blum1956: if the declarer plays small on the club return he is down|pg||
nt|psridhar: true|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psridhar: but if he says i dont need finesse if it works..|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|blum1956: but if he played the Ace, the King being onside he would be off in the laydown|pg||

mb|3H|nt|pamela: I will remember that rule.. goes with the never take a losing finesse.. but not sure who wrote that:-)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: probably Al Roth is my guess |pg||

nt|vugraphzqh: W's hand was not good enough to bid 2S directly|pg||
nt|xenya: this is a tad too high|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: unfortunately for her, E was slightly aggressive trying for game and they ended up one level higher than she hoped|pg||
nt|sybarra: West name should be Bob |pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: BBO corrects the first names automatically|pg||

nt|vugraphzqh: declarer can ruff a diamond and enter his hand with a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: what if he plays a club immediately?|pg||

nt|henryb:  This is presumably one of the reasons why N-S are so far ahead of the field|pg||
nt|athene: east obviously was trying to continue his partner's line of defence and force dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but whatever trumps west has, putting the @DQ through can't hurt|pg||
mb|2C|an|6!c/5+!s 4+!cs|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: 7-2 hearts is handy|pg||
nt|athene: it looks as though NS are playing a canap√© club system a bit like the one played by one of the top US pairs - Ekeblad i think?|pg||
nt|athene: so they open 1@D with possible canap√© into a major|pg||
mb|p|pc|h8|nt|benjent: Didn't this pair play on a few teams with Ekeblad in US Nationals over the last few years?|pg||
nt|blum1956: did West study the meaning od the 2@c opening? It seems he is not afraid of a spade lead|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he just hopes north won't find a spade lead even if it's killing|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|benjent: Verhees had a bit of a think before passing out 3NT. I wonder if he was thinking about Xing .... for a @s lead|pg||

pc|s4|nt|xenya: some danger of getting too high with the NS hands here -- not after W's overcall perhaps|pg||

nt|vugraphzqh: Bas played 6-8 in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: but they lead 1/3/5 in this situation|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: so Sjoert is certain about the layout|pg||
nt|pamela: second and 4ths is becoming more popular |pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: They do play 2/4 when leading through declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: pamela, do you lead same vs. nt as suits?|pg||
nt|pamela: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: I hear from kibitzers that they switch 2/4|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: but Bas was asked how they switch and he said 1/3/5|pg||
nt|pamela: we play 4ths in Nt 3/5 in suit|pg||
