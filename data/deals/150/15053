nt|yuval10: why bid 4@h then?|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|yuval10: 2NT - 3@c ( puppet ) - 3NT ( no majors ) 4@c - 4@d ( cue ) 4NT ( RKCB???? )  5@s - 6@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4NT was described as rkc by both E and W|pg||
nt|yuval10: still i think it's not a good bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzqy: Pachtman went to the toilet|pg||
nt|jtr: Same so far|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c way better, and East has an easy 6@c|pg||
nt|jtr: We dont need to know that Gal:)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|jtr: 6@c a little better than 6NT|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jtr: The latter might make with a @c loser|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: i like 5@c, he has made his effort and has no stoppers in Ms|pg||
nt|hedyg: W has all the controls to bid on|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: must bid 6@C now|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe 4NT hear should be a try not KC|pg||
nt|jtr: here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i was thinking 4@H last train..|pg||
nt|jtr: Stronger than 5@c|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes that too Hedy|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: very good bidding, but for no avail|pg||
nt|hedyg: but at both tables they landed on their feet :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yuval10: one mistake in board 12 sealed the match|pg||
