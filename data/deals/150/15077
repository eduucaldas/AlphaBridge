mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|djneill:  good point, South denied a @s control  so 4@c is not even possible without a @s control|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: so from there on maybe S had to make the decisions|pg||
nt|djneill:  here North is not 5-5 so starts with 2@s, not 3 of something|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@s is gf with 5+ cards|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|djneill:  3@s is 10-13 so South can cooperate with a cue for @s|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|djneill:  North is stretching already (@hQJ not so great) so tries to sign off after cooperating|pg||
nt|djneill:  South perhaps was not sure how strong North was since at this point both hands are minimum for their bidding|pg||
nt|djneill:  not much to do here, very mirror hands|pg||
nt|djneill:  what will East lead?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so then was 4@d forced or an overbid?|pg||

nt|djneill:  South is unlimited, North cannot fail to cue|pg||
nt|eleni: the lead 4@c??|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: ok so if he had more he would turbo over 4@H?|pg||

pc|hT|nt|djneill:  yep, South showed a good hand, and North could not take the reins, so South respects that|pg||

nt|hedyg: you usually lose a trick when leading from a long king in a suit contract|pg||
nt|djneill:  yeah and here N-S had a very strong auction so I agree it is more risky than normal|pg||
nt|djneill:  but against strong auctions you want to lead aggressive since they usually have some source of tricks to pitch quickly on|pg||

nt|djneill:  even 3@d with West is ok since he can't get out of hand with that|pg||
