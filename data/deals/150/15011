nt|twcho: with 9 easy tricks for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: but of course the jump to slam is just a wild gamble given the state of match|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: from the previous ending, north can escape for one down if he chose to ruff a @h instead|pg||
nt|twcho: of course, the double is also SOM action|pg||
mb|1C|nt|twcho: NS knows that they are trailing by a huge margin due to the heavy loss in the previous boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|twcho: because he can then ruff the 3rd round @c with @SA and then ruff his last @h with @s10|pg||
nt|gracelin:  a good 6S based on double fit.  doubt whether EW can reach this low points slam..  On the other hand, 6C is not there.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|twcho: what is 2@s?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|gracelin:  Shenzhen Topone has lost two slam swings so far.  Hope this will not become the third one for them.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: but actually you could never tell what happen at the other table|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|twcho: the 2 boards here doubled are also duplicated but at a higher level|pg||
pc|d5|nt|twcho: so both 54 fit but one has to know which red suit can be discarded for no losers|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@s=no majors, min, 8-11hcp|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|twcho: with a combined 23 points, it is not so clear that it can be reached with ease|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2@S is the default rebid with an unbalanced minimum hand without 3 hearts, so it did not guarantee six cards|pg||

nt|twcho: Would you please look it up for us?|pg||
nt|twcho: actually the lead is in some sense lucky for north in the last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: the hand should be lose 1@c , 1@d and 1@h|pg||
nt|twcho: his @s9 lead has given an extra entry to dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpe: so that there is a mistick on my operating |pg||

nt|vugraphzpe: yes, lose 1@s instead of losing 1@c|pg||
