mb|p|nt|ady: e/w managed 8 tricks in no-trumps  a good result    no doubt a diamond lead and spades breaking well helped|pg||

nt|ugis: I promised myself not to cririsize the players, but sometimes it is not that easy|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||

nt|ady: now can play a heart|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I can blame S |pg||

nt|lestergold: South had a relatively balanced hand with defensive Ks mucjh more likely to take 4 plus tricks in defence than 11 in offence|pg||
