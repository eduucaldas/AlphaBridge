nt|chick: ouch, and N rescues them|pg||
nt|haans: but ...|pg||
nt|jaheim: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@C of course, partner should have both minors|pg||
nt|pelu: but pass is not an option by N - 2@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: East elected to bid NV - not unexpected|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame south for making the obvious lead|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 1@D no 5 c M|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Certainly better than this|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S first time - but now N sh have 10+ |pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: i must admit that as south i would chance a double here i like to earn imps|pg||
nt|jaheim: NS  won the mixed pair chship this year|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and adopting the trend towards 5 rather than 6 card suit|pg||
nt|jaheim: lots of toppairs playing 2 @D as a weak muli   and 2 @H @S as a serious weak 2|pg||
nt|kastan88: fight for partscore, after club lead and spade switch would be -1, West will getting spade ruff. Now just made.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: presumably S cannot open 2H, but a more likely alternative would seem to be 1H. cant argue with success though:)|pg||
nt|chick: Pass by S is also an alternative :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very odd to bid 4H when 3N is virtually sure to go down|pg||
nt|frankaus: we are too lazy (or drunk) to look to see if the suns out :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharkey: I see 8 tricks?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 4@C should lead to a rapid sign-off from East|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Kushari's splinter is limited, Laltu (East's nickname) did have couple of useful cards, but poor @s suit must have decided to lie low|pg||

nt|npcjpn: This EW pair has been played together for a long time.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: i prefer 1@H to 3|pg||
nt|chick: with 2 aces and 3 hearts, N must know that 3N is doomed.   must be he thought 4@H was makeable|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case why wouldnt he bid it on the porevious round?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surely E was not going to pass 3HX|pg||
nt|frankaus: fairly transparent singleton lead |pg||
nt|rv: He will hop with @DA, pitch @c on @CK, draw trumps and concede a @d|pg||

nt|haans: but may make Jt9 in @D = good|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed. The system I tend to use is that the Double of 2@D indicates that I was going to transfer to @Hs|pg||
nt|jaheim: EW  currently 2.   NS 4. place|pg||

pc|c2|nt|npcjpn: The other pair in open room is relatively new partnership.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: certainly true that Pass is an option for S. my comment about 1H was based on the manifest intention of S to do something other than the textbook pass, so i whould have prefaced my ...|pg||

mb|1H|nt|kastan88: so good result for taipei +130 against possible -50|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: certainly there are hands where 3N could make and 4HX be a good save -- mostly they start with a longish minor lacking only the ace plus two heart stoppers and enough spade tricks ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to get to nine. but it is extremely pessimistic to save since there are zillions of hands where 3N fails, maybe by several tricks. so if you don;t try for that kind of good result ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when your preempt creates the opportunity, you ought to stop  preempoting|pg||
nt|davidstern: Irashaimase Nobu|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: vi ligger litt foran :)|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Sorry, missed a few rounds as I had to get the phone|pg||
nt|april7: might end up in 4@S by NS or 5@H by EW|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but only 3 teams in womens, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or will we?|pg||
nt|haans: assume X is penalty|pg||
nt|haans: weak openings make it harder for opps to bid their cards|pg||
nt|frankaus: we are resorting to betting on two flies here - no-one knows how to rigg that contest|pg||

nt|davidstern: 4@S is a little unlucky oonb this hand with two diamond ruffs and the spade offside|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one possibility was to start with 2@H over 2@D, but you can understand the double  |pg||
pc|c2|nt|jaheim: evt   2 nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: Det var vel alternativet|pg||
nt|jaheim: valgte kløvern, hadde fortjent å finne makker med omvendt minorfarger   imo|pg||
nt|sharkey: God strategi å sette press på motstanderne i gunstig sone|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 @H  prob  shoving 3 + @H|pg||
nt|april7: best is to cash 2 top @D and then playing @C ace and @C|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 3@H should make on the nose|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@H last making spot|pg||
nt|frankaus: real tough to find the right strain and level on this 1|pg||
nt|dslee: 2@H is better bid from N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now NS are swinging across the line|pg||
nt|rv: I will fault South's double here more than North's first double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to be fair, this is a very awkward hand for NS|pg||
nt|frankaus: my choice would bre 3NT after the X by N|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|haans: if they make 1NTx they do not get game |pg||
nt|chick: 4@H looks good superficially, but I think difficult to make.  3@S has no chance.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we can see that spade intervention might make this tricky, but the chance for that has gone|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: technically 4@s is a vbiablem save but who is gonna bid it it could be heading for 800 not agood imnvestment unless you cansee al the cards|pg||

nt|pelu: u were right with 3@s :)|pg||
nt|rv: South should either pass (my choice) or bid 3n|pg||

nt|rnmalik: indeed. @SJ would have been interesting.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Absolutely|pg||
nt|baardolav: should make even if all the "quesses" goes wrong|pg||

nt|davidstern: Not a fan of the pass by W - I would prefer to bid 2@C to let partner know I have values else I will be under pressure later|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Kushari-Laltu play 1n here to show 16-18, hence Laltu Xed instead of 1@s on account of much better @c suit |pg||

nt|baardolav: 2@d is a weak multi|pg||
nt|davidstern: Methinks too|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East might bid agin, but if he has bid his hand with double then he has a clear pass chez moi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: K of cl and a claim?|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club at its best|pg||
nt|baardolav: this will make +2 or something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2@d is a Multi, South can respond 2@h (pass/correct) or 2@S (pass/3@h). His hearts are good, could easily have bid 2@s   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: South with long hearts assumes his partner has spades :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@s is natural not forcing in weak multi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can play it that way.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: wow! pass with void?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At least they can take it 1 down|pg||
nt|iceblue: N misunderstood the DBL|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like NS is not so experient|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 3@D from West?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: headed for game not making perhaps|pg||
nt|chick: this can make 4@H but not 5@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lesser evil and pass by E.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Pas probably limits the damage as any EW contract would be pretty expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @S slam can make, but unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: an aggressive lead which on this layout costs a trick|pg||
nt|rv: yes I agree Laltu should have 2 shown suits with more shape earlier with sandwitch NT or Mich or pass now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: i have stopped bidding 4@H 30 years ago|pg||
nt|haans: support x better than delayed support|pg||
nt|npcjpn: may be great score in matchpoint.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, North|pg||
nt|frankaus: saved|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: i would bid something - choice between 4n and 5H not easy but i would fera missing slam to much not to make a try|pg||
nt|sharkey: @CJ Jan Arne - and claim :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally prefer to use a 2@C rebid after 1@D opening to show a good hand. Gives you room to explore below 3N, at a cost on some natural auctions on lesser hands.|pg||
nt|chick: wow, I would never sell out with S's hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud be off 1|pg||

pc|h2|nt|jaheim: mm   5 @D  -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@d can lose spade heart and @d 3n very vulnerable too|pg||
nt|sharkey: Agree - think he shud fight with 3@H|pg||
nt|april7: depends on the play,W might lose 1 @S,1@H 2@D and 1 @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D I mean|pg||

pc|s7|nt|lestergold: perfectly reasonable as games make on dim finesse|pg||

nt|rnmalik: W showed the other two suits by x.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think I would find the Pass, but I also think being aggressive is a winner in the long term|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: very little info from auction west has opted for non commital 'safe' trump lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, they have also stopped at the two-level, so double is not needed as any sort of competitive effort|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: spade switch obvious but doesnt matter spade loser cannot go|pg||

nt|Walddk4: How to gain 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|dslee: ahh|pg||
nt|frankaus: peter hall's book competative bidding at pairs has an excellent chapter on competative doubles - i highly recomend it|pg||
nt|bucheister: are they playing a club system?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not think so |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am not sure, just joined and 1st time working abt their teams, but i guess after a few boards we'll reach the truth|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphznb: weak multi or strong|pg||
nt|haans: Voll right thats a weak 2|pg||
nt|chick: we all know better than to bet with you, Jan :)|pg||
nt|jaheim: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: may keep NS out of the cold @D slam|pg||
nt|april7: just 11 tricks possible, but depends on the lead and continuation|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@S with 10 or 11 tricks depending on the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 11 on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: takes the guesswork out of these situation|pg||
nt|bucheister: the meckwell two heart response is very useful on this type of hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sharkey: Depends on what x of 2@D would mean|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1 nt 4 minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 1NT is 8-15 p and at least 4-4 in @c and @d|pg||
nt|april7: do they play strong pass?|pg||
nt|rv: Click http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/DisplayResultsT4?club_event_id=15508&header=pabf&fdc=EWDPRAUDG for latest results|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: EW will find 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: there are 15 teams participating in the event|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: well this slam wont be missed thats for sure|pg||
nt|othered1: South's double is interesting with that shape and not that many high cards|pg||
nt|haans: odd take out x|pg||
nt|henryb:  Going back to board one, where Lunna mysteriously took 12 tricks in 6N, shouldn't it be possible for big club players to reach 6@c?|pg||
nt|othered1: North has to act h ere and EW may find themselves defending a high @D contract|pg||
nt|haans: big clubs does anything :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: in board 1, Lunna got a diamond in the lead, and South was endplayed in spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose it depends on what you open 2@d on - if you can do it with 5@h, then yes, 2@S natural makes sense |pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade partial ERW and Hearts or clubs NS|pg||
nt|pelu: I would never open in East - would u?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Singapore currently in 6th place|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Kvarngraven 1st to think were are all the cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: at +17 imps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/MeckWellEscapes.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: Palestine, with -53 imps, is in 13th place, but there are several segments remaining and opportunities for plenty of movement in the standings|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jaheim: ja   hadde gått 2 bet jeg|pg||
nt|jaheim: minst  :)|pg||
nt|jaheim: another slam coming up|pg||
nt|sharkey: 18-19|pg||
nt|lestergold: whether they bid the grand tho is open to question|pg||
nt|othered1: I might rebid @H on south's hand and I think it wins over the long term.|pg||
nt|haans: with u|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some would use stayman as N|pg||
nt|april7: should S open and N passes then E will come in in @H and then  perhaps 1,2,3 NT???|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Obviously the dealing machine is saving the games and slams for later in the tournament ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade lead and heart off dummy would work well for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|pelu: give up: 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: E-W pair play rebid of 2M after 2/1 to be catch-all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT forcing - very sensible|pg||
nt|rv: they play 2/1 as GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm that will tend to ruole out a heart contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib asked why not open weak 2@H with S hand on Bd 17.  Reason is weak 2 openings 3rd hand NV can be very weak at Expert level, and this was closer to an opening hand.  Also a ...|pg||
nt|sharkey: matter of agreement|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah this may get them to the bad game|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sharkey: tror de fleste av oss hadde det|pg||
nt|jaheim: Viego in trbl,  but 1400 in the "bank"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you open with a sub-minimum in 3rd seat, fair enough, at least have a decent suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: NS are playing in my local club|pg||
nt|lestergold: anymore and someone will be in tgrouble|pg||
nt|haans: ty Liv needed that info|pg||
nt|henryb:  Did South really have to act over 1@s Hans?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think many of us would begin with 1@D as W dealer|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: 7@C makes|pg||
nt|chick: I think that hand is much too strong for a preempt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dbl looks like DONT  - six card suit somewhere. Bit thin if it is|pg||
nt|npcjpn: there are many players who does not like pass in 3rd seat even vulnerable (in Japan).|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: I don't think W should pass 1@D, has 5 P!!! and then 4@H would have been reached making 5 if starts with @S finesse but 10 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|april7: down from top on @S lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would rather open 1@H if you forced me to open|pg||
nt|npcjpn: me too.|pg||
nt|pelu: pest and colera :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: it's possible to win 6@D on EW-line, another is to bid that, and sure, need to find good break in trumps and right finesse in spades, too much key-cards off to bid that|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Gjetter spillet går ut|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|chick: If I get support for either suit, I don't play a 6-5 hand below game|pg||
nt|bucheister: 4H seems to be an impatient bid; don't you agree?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 7N has 13 tops |pg||
nt|lestergold: n /s in trouble !|pg||
nt|haans: to good effect|pg||
nt|pelu: can West pass?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one of the legacies of the old Acol system was that 2NT here was not forcing|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari will sign-off in 3N to limit hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/25udavr  for running scores |pg||
nt|sybarra: seems so John |pg||
nt|h_karluk: absolutely, even i can tell misunderstanding of fast arrival concept|pg||
nt|bucheister: if E bids 2D, W will bid 3D and E can bid 3NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess A count, K attitude there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so the defenders would have no difficulty to cash 2@d, 1@c and a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but let's wait and see, who knows there may be a slip in defense|pg||
pc|hT|nt|frankaus: scoring looks to be done by martin wilcox cheif scorer for ABF |pg||
nt|dslee: now laltu might force a round?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jaheim: y   but no D   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, we don't want 1100|pg||
nt|baardolav: no one can ask for aces...|pg||
nt|pelu: plauge or colera, sorry :)|pg||
nt|pelu: plague - new keyboard :(:(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this was because when someone opened the bidding, you could never be certain that they had an opening bid|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jaheim: her måtte sp K ut|pg||
nt|jaheim: y   13 toptricks,  with 2 sptricks|pg||
nt|haans: dirty bridge|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I tend to agree|pg||
nt|rv: Laltu's 4N is Quant|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh my,  made 4 in other room |pg||
nt|h_karluk: unfortunately true|pg||
nt|sybarra: south cashed a @D, then led a hts |pg||
nt|h_karluk: why i do not have such defenders, i think i am a jealous guy :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: 7N is technically better as well because if clubs broke badly you would have the spade position to fall back on|pg||
nt|sharkey: 7@S depending on the @S finesse|pg||
nt|april7: but after ruff S is endplayed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so you had to have lots of bids that acted as invites. Partner bid on if he really did have an opening bid, and passed otherwise|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari would have accepted Inv to slam with max (13-14) for his stated minimum (10-14)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: would have gone on if after 2nt invite|pg||
nt|haans: bridge not like all time|pg||
nt|haans: old|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The last thing Declarer will do is lead trumps, has to try for a semi-crossruff in the red suits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: important to know what these doubles are. After the redouble, penalty is a live possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: EW not agree about bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: back later .. bye all|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mcarroll: well stopped|pg||
nt|baardolav: or south can not...|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jaheim: tull   kl Q er jo inntak  :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: funnt south doubles and east can probably manage 3@s they bid on to hopeless 4@d and let off hook|pg||
nt|othered1: right, south has a quite sound opening|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jaheim: y   think cl is trumph|pg||
nt|sharkey: The @S suit has not been mentioned so a mute point|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bid at any raTE ITS GOOD ENUF AT IMPS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe West didn't believe East could have a penalty double of 2@H when he held @HKJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now only 10, no entry to dummy to take the diamond finesse when spades are 3-1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Declarer got a diamond lead in the other room|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: Wonder what wud happen if Jensen opened Multi 2@D here (ref previous board)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|henryb:  I thought this was perhaps a Scandinavian requirement: see 11HCP, Pass not allowed :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|haans: greast lover of T and 9|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H a make here?|pg||

pc|d4|nt|lestergold: i do not understand my pard vul opens bidding i sit over strong hand with that trump holding they at 4 level im sorry folks i wer bring out a red card pdq|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Sound reasonable to me|pg||
nt|april7: on @H lead then 5,on @D ace lead only 4,but bidding might develop differently|pg||

nt|npcjpn: it will be tough not leading a spade.|pg||
nt|frankaus: some would open North hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but preferred a jump rebid, i guess was useless, slow approach would produce a better way to see what partner have|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sharkey: Good bid by Kvangraven|pg||
nt|lestergold: no lead to beat|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N|pg||
nt|sharkey: S unsure about @C suit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south may be tempted to play this in hearts|pg||
nt|jaheim: or lucky, finding p with 10 of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: if so three rounds of spades with the 9@h ruffing in would not be nice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S seems makeable on trump coup|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: may be even 6...|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would prefer 1@s, but ..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi henry:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
nt|haans: Henry :)|pg||
nt|haans: no alert of 2nt?|pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s would seem to have the advantage that it leaves more room, and your hand is better than a weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was bid as good-bad, but W is not sure. TD at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was not alerted|pg||
nt|haans: can be costly|pg||
nt|henryb:  on either side?|pg||
nt|haans: for EW|pg||
nt|henryb:  the alet I mean?|pg||
nt|baardolav: they did not play that hand...|pg||
nt|april7: N did not reopen|pg||
nt|chick: now, S has shown his 20 with a X then cuebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2@c asks for a four-card major, West should reply 2@D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chick: on the  lead of @CA and a @C?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 7|pg||

nt|april7: tough game here!!!!|pg||
nt|baardolav: the biddings i mean?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ms Kobayashi likes to open light it seems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as he hasn't got a four-card major|pg||
nt|kastan88: 4@S for EW (and best is to play that from West hand). Now after @H lead just disaster|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: WebCam: http://tinyurl.com/2bj3dm or full adress : http://bridgefestival.no/modules.php?name=NukeWrap&page=http://bridgefestival.no/refresh.htm|pg||
nt|rnmalik: favourable placement of cards for 4@S.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At least this resembles an opening hand|pg||
nt|pelu: strange lead when u know that pd has max 2 @hs|pg||
nt|npcjpn: I do not play against this pair so often, so I don't know their style.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: 9 claimable immediate tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: In my view an awful convention - tell opps your distribution|pg||
nt|haans: no alert = good hand = 3@S good bid = missed game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not an easy grand decision but its there|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jaheim: men meds gammelmakkern som sitter på hjørnet hadde det nok blitt 2 kl|pg||
nt|frankaus: too stong 4 me |pg||
nt|mdgraham: imho, 1NT is a complete distortion|pg||

nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: grand doesnt make on the lay out |pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|h_karluk: kind of double dummy, @c K hook onside|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: a lot ofm tricks here for declarfer|pg||
nt|frankaus: 36 zars = 18 HCP|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: Med @S 3-3 ordner det seg i den fargen|pg||
nt|sharkey: Med @D og @C 3-2 funker det meste - V skal også gardere seg mot @C 4-1|pg||
nt|lestergold: what?|pg||
nt|baardolav: this will be a disaster for NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no- saved by hearts 3-3|pg||

nt|april7: 5 down|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1100  ?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|rv: yes I expected hand eval closer to 18 hcp |pg||
pc|h6|nt|jaheim: or 1400|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i suppose can afford it|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C lead beats it I think|pg||
nt|chick: seems like a good way to tell the opponents your distribution|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: ten tricks then|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: @H8 and @C to K would be a very nice defense|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, the nightmare scenario for declarer is if the EW @Cs were reversed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even with diamonds coming in, North has only eight tricks, and entries are a problem|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d5|nt|lestergold: agree it seems pretty ugly to me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would make own hand good|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: even more tricks goodbye ak @s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so close to LBW, but let off by the umpire|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sharkey: or 12|pg||
nt|haans: 2NT did for that reason say any 4 card m|pg||
nt|mdgraham: whether he will play for the actual club position ....|pg||
nt|frankaus: zars a sophisticad  hand anaalysis tool - link - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sharkey: next...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|baardolav: -5 it will be...?|pg||
nt|rv: India has still not agreed to TRDS|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|bucheister: time to claim 6;|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i am very sorry, right now checked again, @h 10xxx a barrier for grand|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|henryb:  So declarer now has 9 tricks. He started with 8. Will they give him 10? Stay tuned|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jaheim: mm   bra spilt|pg||

nt|lestergold: 5@c is what i meant to type|pg||

nt|lestergold: that too but game unlikely to be bid in either back suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S may actually be a better contract|pg||

mb|1C|nt|jaheim: snei    alle lagturneringene har vært trege fra begynnelsen i år|pg||
nt|lestergold: another frigid 3n thx to favourable layout of @d suit|pg||

nt|mcarroll: or 6NT|pg||
nt|april7: same with 6NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tsukamoto knows what to expext by now; partner has 10-12 points when she opens|pg||

mb|1H|nt|vugraphznb: 1 down in last board|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
nt|henryb:  what I thought|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they reach slam there is no real alternative to the @D finesse|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H by EW losing 2@C and 1 @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What would you bid now, guys?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: snei   = nei   :)|pg||

nt|dslee: rather easy one for EW|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Not easy|pg||
nt|frankaus: i like 3 card raise over 1@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: three card raise rarer and rarer|pg||
nt|chick: three card raise should be extinct|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: though this hand is not so strong.|pg||
nt|sybarra: now looks like a club system for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes -on review think 5@C better|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not like east's double tend to get into troubole when u faikl to bid ur main asset namely clubs here|pg||
nt|april7: is N considering a X???|pg||
nt|mcarroll: That is a very sporting 2@S|pg||
nt|april7: thats why it will cost a lot|pg||

nt|mcarroll: and with 3 tricks N expects something from pd - He will be disappointed!!|pg||

nt|davidstern: 2NT by South 3@S by North now |pg||

nt|Walddk4: No matter what, 2@H worked like a dream|pg||

nt|npcjpn: true.|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S down 1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: may land in 3 nt also |pg||
nt|bucheister: I am surprised that S did not bid 3C asking on this hand;  it is the key to a club slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: !K offside, seems either 3N by N or 4@h by S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @Sk|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: and as u say it may well go off |pg||
nt|sharkey: @DA lead OR|pg||

nt|lestergold: is east that stromngb that a doubolem is needed before showing the clubs/|pg||
nt|haans: many play 2nt as invite or more|pg||
nt|haans: many scandinavians at least|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@D - 3 NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: OK Natural :)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: or 3@c by North and 3@s by South.|pg||
nt|davidstern: 6@C would be a good spot|pg||
nt|npcjpn: if you open light, you have to be lucky.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 hj med 4 kortstøtte,  ja ja, ikke min melding|pg||
nt|sharkey: if East were ready to bid 4@C on 3@D he shud be able to do the same over 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Martin. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@d South African transfer to 4@S....|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcarroll: Hardly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South really playing with fire here. You suspect 3@s would have been passed out|pg||
nt|jaheim: D   is @H lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: It seems the NS style may be to support immediately with 3 spades but I suspect that the bidding is consistent with 3 spades and six clubs perhaps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however slam, no heart losers, only a club loser|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: combined 24 points doesnt have to bid game|pg||
nt|jaheim: mm   1 nt opening in W|pg||
nt|chick: at least S didn't draw the fatal (to defenders) club lead by bidding them|pg||
nt|chick: now can N find a heart?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Well Leaped|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 11 easy tricks with hearts 3-2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|henryb:  but woud you bid less than game opposite partner's opening 1@s?|pg||
nt|chick: booo|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good lead.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: For defence.|pg||
nt|chick: pretty skinny GF by S|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4@d splinter discourages.|pg||
nt|davidstern: North may be aiming for 6@C|pg||
nt|davidstern: which would be playable opposite nothing more than the @SK and @CAQ|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|sharkey: Vet ikke hvor N fant doblingen i Åpent Rom?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C makes - not 6...|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 4@d is forcing, I approve, otherwise 5@d seems indicated|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S was said to be GF\|pg||
nt|chick: if 2@S is GF....|pg||
nt|jaheim: so   10 points  is enough 4 a gf?   strange|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ino may have been better supporting clubs to allow South to better judge the hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: Fant den her og...|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think South's hand is NTish - wud have tried 3@D to make pd bid 3 NT with @D stopper|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, its frustrating when you find later that you pushed them to a  possibly making game |pg||
nt|april7: @S @S @S the W should discard ace of @C on 3d @D|pg||
nt|davidstern: South should now bid six with the @SK and a singleton heart|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|haans: xy Stayman in Sweden we belive that was invented in Denmark long time ago|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Miss Jane pulled most probably Miss Greta would respond|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chick: agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think S should bid 5C over 3D, then he is in position to pass 5D|pg||
nt|henryb:  Suth could not affort Blackwood|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rv: this format is not favorite of many of the purists who prefer k/o matches to decide top placings since this format favors beating weak teams comprehensively|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: after the 3@D rebid, most players play 3@S as competitive only - they either double or bid 3@H as a game try|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|bucheister: oops|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is too high|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit too much |pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: 2@D GF|pg||
nt|april7: only hope for E to get in if K or Q of @C|pg||
nt|april7: thats an interesting defence|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: as spec pointsn o9ut he has forced himnself to bid 4@c over 3@d by his pard whcih would be overdoing the hand|pg||
nt|april7: W must  pray S having another @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: some would claim|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no claim yet?|pg||
nt|sybarra: some imps back to palestine most likely |pg||

nt|frankaus: quite a good method IMO|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: East got the clue he neede|pg||

pc|c5|nt|rnmalik: AK@S and @HK pitching 3@Ds and @D finesse and one @C loser.|pg||

nt|vugraphznb: the winner of this match will win the ch.ship|pg||

nt|Walddk4: It is of course against the laws to delay the game unneccessarily|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer ACBL format or initial RR followed by k/o like in World Series, not a big fan of this format|pg||
nt|frankaus: one can still get a "flat pitch" V a weak tem and be disadvantaged though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 7@c kind of double a battery attitude|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Hello Jaak|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lestergold: not provide him with a route map to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Rite - and discrading !K at the end position and keeping 3 x @C may have resulted in a set|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last board of this segment, interesting hands as reflected by the respective scores, no unwanted swings.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's written black on white|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But maybe she could not see that she had 11 tricks; that's an excuse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but in 0314 4N>5@c 0-3. 5@d 1-4, 5@h 2 and 5@s 2+ trump Q is not it ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes still |pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: The challenge here is to bid game|pg||
nt|davidstern: South got a heart lead and carelessly ruffed a diamond losing all communication with dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe pulled wrong card out of bidding box|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sharkey: @DK|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 3@h is slamtry with @c|pg||
nt|jaheim: too lata again :(|pg||
nt|jaheim: late|pg||

nt|suketbombi: a close Match till now Phillippines doing well to Take the Might of Patrick and his Team|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 7 stikk mulig her|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaheim: if   playing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or 6NT? with 12 tops?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A bit surprising nobody found the red card after 4@S in OR|pg||
nt|npcjpn: vulnerbale, second seat and bad suit...|pg||

nt|davidstern: I took an oath never to bid 3N T with a void in partner's suit but that was in 1975|pg||
nt|davidstern: I should say I have stuck with it ever since|pg||
nt|pelu: borderline 2@D (Michael) in Red|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Amazing, EW sold out to 2@S on board 6 in the open room|pg||
nt|kastan88: till now closed, but last 2 boards may be good results for Taipei, as 5th board Philippines lost 4@S and in 6th is possible to bid and win 3NT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chick: as would I|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will get to game now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West doubled 1NT, then she doubled 2@D and then she passed 2@S|pg||
nt|rv: Laltu should pass here, not enough for raise to 3@d in my opinion|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sharkey: 2NT Invitational Values min @S and 4 card support|pg||
nt|april7: but cross ruff is already open|pg||
nt|npcjpn: @dQ and @CK are great card for East.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jaheim: but needs to lead a @D, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of this session has been when you are dealt a double then double|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why didnt S bid 3 NT?|pg||
nt|haans: invite or not invite that is the question|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H prermpt in my book|pg||
nt|chick: after the X, 2@H shows 8+ in my book :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: last board in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2 matches to go|pg||
nt|mcarroll: After I predicted a flat board on 6 I hesitate to say anything here - But............|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1   i think   ,  Liv Marit|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: yes, you're right jaheim|pg||
nt|april7: I think losing at most 2 @S and 2 aces|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: one more match|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you know people didn't much attend even to GNT finals|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is only site I have|pg||
pc|d7|nt|davidstern: And even then......|pg||
nt|npcjpn: @D to 9.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: East should have @CA instead of @CKJ to bid 3@D.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, and a trump short as well|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks a too round for my liking|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as i inspected $23 each session for open pairs|pg||
nt|bucheister: philly is pricey; the large market next to the Marriott is just great; I could eat there everyday; fresh seafood; pastas; every type of food served in small booth areas at ...|pg||
nt|bucheister: reasonable prices|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i ve never been in Philly but heard there's a great Metro system|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: AKK is extra in it self|pg||
nt|henryb:  better case at matchpoints|pg||
nt|sharkey: We would all lead @HQ vs 3 NT and set it....|pg||
nt|chick: and I have a known double fit in the majors (assuming a normal takeout double)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 2@D to show both M and some points|pg||
nt|haans: yep good for 2@D instead of @H bid|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: im on Volls side|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Depends what 2NT showed|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: there has been a fair amountg of no trump avoidance too|pg||
nt|sharkey: May work out ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: im susrprised that 3n failed in open room|pg||
nt|haans: yes at IMP you seldom pass before game|pg||
nt|chick: that would also work if such agreed|pg||
nt|sharkey: This won't be easy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True Roland|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS wil be quite pleased to gain an imp after going four down vulnerable in a freely-bid game |pg||
nt|sybarra: great city and hotel location is right down town, easy to get around|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: Solves trump problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ive checked play first took club the unatural way then after spade switch took a secons spade finesse rather than dim finesse when defenders had warned himn that spades were ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: both 'wrong'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, the cardinal sin, Mike. Declarer had his contract but went for overtricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Viego will suffer their first defeat |pg||
nt|h_karluk: I liked The Marriot, have been there in many sectionals, regionals|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classy|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb:  if partner signs off the game may be less than 50%|pg||
nt|davidstern: South will switch to a spade at a million miles and hour if East plays another diamond |pg||
nt|pelu: yes KJ no value when pd 5-5 in major|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf  for results|pg||
nt|pelu: a major Q better than @cK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: i see contract failed in open but surely playing on clubs declarer should make this|pg||
nt|haans: you need a good 50% to bid non vul games|pg||
nt|haans: better bidding than OR|pg||
nt|pelu: ??????????????|pg||
nt|npcjpn: East probably hoped miracle AQ in majors.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sophia is lucky that this does not cost the contract|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: play for split honours in clubs shoul lose a heart a club and a diamond at most|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board for the match. Back in 10-15 mins|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharkey: Had to lead @D9 for a set|pg||

nt|kastan88: *not lost 4@S, just didn't find right 4@S :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2@C should be fine here unless declerer looses 3 @HS 2@CS and @S unlikely|pg||
pc|h5|nt|april7: now almost 4@H|pg||
nt|pelu: but she is almost endplayed |pg||
nt|npcjpn: the other 8 is better to shift.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: She had 3 to choose from :)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 20-22 maybe|pg||

nt|Walddk4: "Set up your side suit first" is a good rule|pg||
nt|npcjpn: strange play. @HA then low and guess.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: Ø må spille på at N må ha begge Ess for å vinne kontrakten|pg||
nt|lestergold: it wasnt for overtrick played for split spade honours rather than dim finesse which a priori was better odds but suspicous on the dfence|pg||
nt|sharkey: First make your contract - THEN overtricks...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Liv Marit!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: evry tim you do wrong Have a talk with p|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Winning the ace was strange for a start|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: 9 dimds would be a better card to play by east|pg||
nt|sharkey: killing lead - but nobody lead high from xxx??|pg||
nt|pelu: why not play @C8 - only chance is to find Q10x in C in N = discard for 3@Ss|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mike, BOA and Martin|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now North knows South has another spade, so the defense is not tough.|pg||
nt|frankaus: i meant for N to X |pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: we are seeing a lot of card play shall we say less than perfect plays in this match|pg||
pc|c9|nt|suketbombi: wud duck the @H return i suppose while @C shift will make things easy for him|pg||
pc|cA|nt|april7: why not 3 of @D from N?|pg||
nt|jaheim: and it will be a pleasure tu buy   Liv M a beer next year   tx  all   and cong. to team   Ugh|pg||
nt|rv: East (Deb Majumder aka Laltu) is the youngest member of the team, he is in his early thirties and this is his first Intl tourney|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|iceblue: but got is not sitting behind him:)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2@S is obviously artificial (we don't get alerts) but I am not in love with 2@C for a start. You can safely open 1@D, it won't go all pass|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2@C opening is often misused. They are very rare and should be because they ruin all constructive bidding|pg||
