nt|henryb:  -1270 is not the sort of result that endears the system to teammates or produces converts among kibitzers|pg||
nt|snowface: that's the hardest thing with playing a new system. Logically you could think that 2@s would show a take out double type of hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|snowface: then X would be more defense orientated|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|snowface: yes, red no inversion of pass and 1@d|pg||
nt|iceking: S had open with a weak bid 0-9hcp i doubt you need to define bal dbls as defense orientated |pg||
nt|iceking: north really had to remove this dbl bid 2sp and hope they dont nail you there|pg||
nt|snowface: but if you have the luxury, why not differ between 4144 type of hands and 4234 types|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb:  perhaps having shown a pass you could remain quiet thereafter?|pg||
nt|henryb:  especially when playing imps?|pg||
nt|iceking: no he cant pass whith this shape when oops stopp in part score he knows pd has values so he needs to bid|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|h5|pc|s7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: I suggest he tries playing that way at rubber bridge for money    may need a large bank overdraft|pg||
nt|snowface: I agree. But when you then play something new, you need to know exactly which type of take out he might have.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|iceking: he just made a normal bridge bid as i see it got unlucky that does happen |pg||
nt|snowface: but do you think bidding 2@s would have been better?|pg||
nt|ady: if thats normal   wonder what its like if he is aggressive?|pg||
nt|iceking: yes i cant see why north thought 2h was going down |pg||
nt|henryb:  seems to me that the opponents have advertised approximately half the highcard points and have not shown a particularly strong fit. Your kings are under the 1N bidder, which is not a good sign|pg||
nt|snowface: no, i mean S bidding 2@s|pg||
nt|iceking: for me that is just natural |pg||
nt|iceking: not takeout|pg||
nt|henryb:  so discretion is the better part of valor|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I donÂ´t know their signals, but for me @s4 fromN1 had indicated an even number in @s|pg||
