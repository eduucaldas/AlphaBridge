pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|blum1956: according to the system he must bid 2NT or 3NT. He preferred 2NT thanks to two small clubs|pg||

nt|h_karluk: opener has at least 12 or 13 high-card points, partner has 11 or 12 with inverted minor (or more), if you are not very weak in majors there could be trouble, that's why i believe ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: some creativity needed|pg||
nt|blum1956: some of the pairs play that 2@h rebid may be not only strong with 5+ hearts but also weak (12-14) with values in hearts and without stopper in spades or diamonds. But the E's hand ...|pg||
