nt|sharkey: Not often slam is bid after opps open bidding - lacking two aces here|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I believe it's a new tournament today|pg||
nt|sharkey: hei Tore|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|blum1956: Even if you open 1NT the result will be the same|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Also 2 sessions of 32 boards|pg||
pc|s2|nt|olliebol: said i....|pg||
nt|olliebol: couldnt guess this contract|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk3: and the lead is weird|pg||

nt|haans: not wrong try|pg||
nt|haans: we all done worse|pg||
nt|haans: t/o x of 2@S would have been best|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d3|nt|Walddk1: Format is matchpointed pairs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzpu: Sry 3 d-4! |pg||
pc|h6|pg||

pc|h8|nt|Walddk1: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1049f100829|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|rmb1: EW have discovered their @H suit|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cuttysark: In which case going down in slam is only one of may ways to achieve a poor score|pg||
pc|d7|nt|blum1956: But that is MP's so one setting trick less may cost|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer has the rest for -1|pg||
nt|haans: claiming time|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And checking your Balckwood agreements is only one of many things you should do at the start of each session :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Yesterdays results are found here http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1049f100828|pg||

nt|blum1956: Smth went wrong? Why just made?|pg||
nt|blum1956: OK|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Operator error|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome back to Robin Barker|pg||
nt|frankaus: 9 wil be a great score|pg||
nt|haans: Operator any new about  scores from Oslo?|pg||
nt|haans: Results: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1049f100828  :(|pg||
nt|haans: may end with a double|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I was surprised they didn't use neg x's in that spot|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good afternoon from Manchester |pg||
nt|yo_yo: great save |pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello again Mike|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Nr 1 against nr 2: EW Leader|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bvdahl: this could get bad for whoever gets the contract|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk3: Do you know how to correct, Tore?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: wk 2s|pg||
nt|olliebol: hello Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: undo?|pg||
mb|r|mb|1N|nt|haans: FOSS Grand Tournament  2010 http://privat.bluezone.no/rayh/Bridge-filer/FBK/FredrikstadBK.htm|pg||
nt|haans: neg double after NT slowly (slowly) on its way up|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good morning haans et al|pg||
nt|bvdahl: very common in Norway|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: 1 N=n 8-11 HC!|pg||
nt|haans: just wait a hundred years :)|pg||
nt|haans: SCORE: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1049f100829 |pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharkey: View pd's pass not sure everyone wud Dbl with North's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: re Kath i expect north is rather relieved at these colours to be off the hook|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Updating only possible in the evening. Sry:(|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rmb1: West is enormous opposite a strong NT|pg||
nt|frankaus: south rather skinny for me at theses colours|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not clear to players who can make what, so keep bidding|pg||
nt|haans: easy 4@S now 2 again 1 tend to be easiest|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Do thay have methods to discover the @d fit?|pg||
nt|sharkey: S must be thinking slam...|pg||
nt|baardolav: here ns will reach...? 5 or 6?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|haans: neg double better than Lebesohl|pg||
pc|c5|nt|blum1956: 5@s will cost NS 500|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: N said they owned 4. level! But not 5.:)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3 NT might be he only way to not get x|pg||
nt|haans: yes 1@D may be perfect opening|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: may be defense error in  spades|pg||
nt|haans: that lead may cost|pg||
nt|haans: bye :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cuttysark: Needs a lot - 2 working aces and good trump splits - but hey...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1@S would be 4th suit forcing so difficult to find the 4-4 @S fit|pg||
nt|olliebol: guess ew play 1@s as fourth suit here so no @s bid from east|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like 4NT RKCB, 5@S 2A+@SQ can this be right?|pg||
nt|haans: 4NT quant say many advanced playes|pg||
nt|bvdahl: looks like 2 + 2 + 3 + 1|pg||
nt|bvdahl: can there be some endplay in spades/diamonds against north for 9?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1. round of the day - both pairs need to work on their slam bidding |pg||
nt|haans: not fast beridge here :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rmb1: So do I but what is 5@S|pg||
nt|blum1956: No they do not. At least E seems to have answered RKCB|pg||
nt|olliebol: rite:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: some say both neg x + lebesohl|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I actually play it as natural in this position|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: 2+Q|pg||
nt|baardolav: Not doubled... this slam will score more than the other EW slam one down|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim lead was probably tyhe only lead to threatebn the contract because it would have destrpyed the entry to the spades when established|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rmb1: South's skinny 2@S may not deliver the one trick North needs|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|olliebol: not a bad idea here at all|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: We are very gratefull for getting sponsors. That makes it easier to run a good tourney. This year Vognservice, Lislerud, Fredriksstad blad, sa (Sarpsborg arbeiderblad), COWI A/S, ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: AS Demokraten and Felleskjøpet are supporting us! |pg||
nt|jbgood: nice to see so many newspapers sponsoring bridge!|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|lestergold: spade better i think|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now 12 tricks are easy. More probable 13 as S is squeezed automatically|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: @D8 and you are off|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|blum1956: A huge gain while playing MP's|pg||
nt|blum1956: E should be satisfied with 12 tricks therefore he gets 13|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer will cash 4 @H and 4@D and South will have to establish @C5 or unguard @SK.  Declarer will just cash his winners for +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Something got wrong, dev took his trx in d odd h and at table in tr 12 had s4 to the king |pg||
nt|haans: is he claiming now?|pg||
nt|rmb1: But the duplication of shape in the minors should mean -1|pg||
nt|yo_yo: although some easts would respond 1@S to avoid confusion |pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Baard Hi Mike Hi Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Kath|pg||
nt|baardolav: Heyy|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|vugraphzpu: There turned ut endplay so N had to play spade.One down|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|haans: top score to Kopsta-Feness|pg||
pc|d6|nt|frankaus: looks like -1 none the less  what 50 scores is a real mystery 2 me but a + should br ok|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4@C is quite a clever bid - takes away opponents cuebid and invites penalties - but it should also have some defence to a major suit contract |pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Sry -2|pg||
mc|9|nt|rmb1: North must hope South has @DJ|pg||
pg||

nt|vugraphzpu: Now there is 52 pairs with eager bridge- players gathered in the "Music house" at Greaker, a village in Sarpsborg. Cloudy wether, perfect for sitting inside, warm and cosy and ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: compete. Not mud- bicycle as some other "crasy Norwegian" are running today, from Rena, crossing some mountan and ending at Lillehammer. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Hi, my name is Tore Farbrot. I m member of Fredrikstad BC, autoriced TL and fond of bridgeplaying. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Ready again, trouble with start sesj 3|pg||
nt|baardolav: 1-1 |pg||
nt|cuttysark: But who would trust an opponent?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i guess 4@H -1?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that wont be good , i think 2@S makes|pg||
nt|haans: some odds on 3@D|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|baardolav: never trust the opponents...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzpu: all col 1. rnd?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe get @C away  |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: and we have a psych :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N-1 also|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3 NT N, I would think, and E will need to find club shift when he gains entry in hearts...and W cant afford to pitch any clubs|pg||
mb|2N|nt|haans: :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: clear 4@h|pg||
nt|baardolav: but someone have agreements on 3x-- Double-- 3nt weak pre, raise more cards|pg||
nt|haans: part score i say|pg||
nt|olliebol: nice four @s here on the @s finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Prec NS|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with me that would be a good @C suit , 4 card @S support and game going hand|pg||
nt|haans: a new bid have entered|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yo_yo: undo|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah not here then|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: good 1nt opening i say|pg||
nt|blum1956: Is it time to pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 4@h may be a chance here|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Results: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1049f100828  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: S showed 14-16 HC|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This looks rather like another failinf contract in 3NT but it may be tougher to defend|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: 2d= forcing ch Back?|pg||
nt|olliebol: well it looks they agree with you|pg||
nt|haans: i say 1@S-2c-3d|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzpu: Hi, and welcome to follow the leaders table from the FOSS- tourneys. Each sessions last for ab 2 hours. There will be 4 sessions today. Its an open pair tourney with MP and Swiss, ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: table 1 is the leaders table. Hope you will have much fun while watching us . |pg||
nt|bvdahl: can east play D7 on the lead...?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: don't thnk that was prec|pg||
nt|haans: saw|pg||
pc|h4|nt|baardolav: So the 3opener can be part of the Decition to make a pre on 5level|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like it - South has made the most descriptve bid available|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 16+9 = game surely|pg||
nt|lestergold: 25 combined|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: 10 trx made|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 10 tricks that's good going|pg||
nt|lestergold: a good time to 'underbid'!|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|haans: not my bridge|pg||
nt|rmb1: What is double by East? @S+@C or just "values"|pg||
nt|haans: 3@D = one minor 3@H which 3@S clubs|pg||
nt|haans: we will soon find out|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not easy|pg||
nt|bvdahl: must continue d's now, I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Already endplayed!:)|pg||
nt|haans: again When will we sea an other score change?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rmb1: NT is where you want to play, judging the level is less clear (if in doubt 3NT :))|pg||
nt|frankaus: looking 4 the majic 200|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: NS is leading afte 4. rnd|pg||
pc|cT|nt|blum1956: No way to go down |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Many pairs would reach this contract in fewer bids....|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Will West be inspired to lead a club?|pg||
nt|baardolav: no one bid club and spade... it is down with spade lead too?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: EW examinds the bidding|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|frankaus: rewarded with 800 :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: Did N have just this idea when he passed 2@h? If yes - this is a magic bridge|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bvdahl: best way to avoid endplay is to duck :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: feness just needs to get to hand twice to finesse @S|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|baardolav: Q now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If he ducks @SQ East should switch; if he doesn't, they can clear spades|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|baardolav: Lomsdale forgot using the Q|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d2|nt|haans: more @D was easy|pg||

nt|vugraphzpu: EW ahead with  31 points over NS|pg||
nt|haans: Gjenstatt Stayman Geo BIR nr 2008|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Jorunn Feness- Kjell Ole Kopstad are very good players with many excelent mix- tourney results together. Have played steadily here, missing last year we regret! |pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: W is thinking!!!!!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But he then ducked the first heart, a good play that should compensate for not unblocking @SQ|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes... true|pg||
nt|olliebol: maybe east could have falsecarded the ten there|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good idea ollie|pg||
nt|olliebol: suggesting kx|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or in @C|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, if pd has stiff J.... ;)|pg||
nt|olliebol: can cost a trick of course|pg||
nt|yo_yo: feness keeping us in suspense here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: N thinking!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: which is more likely,  double @S or doubleton @C|pg||

nt|bvdahl: guessing 3 NT in easts hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 nice boards against the leaders for Jorunn |pg||
nt|bvdahl: some will treat W hand as 20-21 NT here|pg||
nt|bvdahl: which will induce h lead against 3 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Result update available first tonight, ab 21.00 Sry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:(|pg||
nt|haans: upgraded 2nt no 1 upgrade|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|rmb1: NS will probably bid to 5@C|pg||

nt|vugraphzpu: tr|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well predicted|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, no h lead now, probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: 3H=5|pg||
mb|3N|nt|blum1956: And now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: 3H= Max+ 4+h|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hard to make any contract today....|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even 2NT looks impossible here|pg||
nt|baardolav: Livgaard choose 1d instead of 1nt... so the NTbid will be on the strong hand... maybe not the lucky choise this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: finding anything more?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Doesn't feel right to bid 1NT with 3 suits unstopped - but it's all in the lead :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2 or 3 NT looks like the par contract here|pg||
nt|bvdahl: i think 3 NT makes in practice|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Land on a pin head in 4@C ?|pg||
nt|olliebol: highly agressive opposite a passed p the 1nt bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: yeah... true|pg||
nt|cuttysark: At pairs it is right to pass with the flat 6 count|pg||
nt|haans: hearts lead and soon doen|pg||
nt|haans: done|pg||
nt|sharkey: Now right to duck @H lead...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Alwasy easier to make 9 tricks in 2NT than 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 5th highest lead should give a clue|pg||

nt|yo_yo: 5@D = 0 or 3 KC  probably|pg||

nt|vugraphzpu: NS clever players from Moss BC.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|blum1956: Let us recall the board where EW made 6NT with an overtrick. There exists a good method to show the spade support and FG values after 2@c Stayman and 2@s responce. You just bid 3@h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: weak 2@S?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: EW might have the highest contract in 2 spades|pg||

nt|vugraphzpu: Opps nr 8 now, NS leder pair|pg||
nt|olliebol: unfortunately ns got the same singleton|pg||

nt|baardolav: well it is almost same as 2small|pg||
nt|bvdahl: strange spot for E, 5-5 in opps suits after pd bids 1 NT....|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpu: 4 col forcing|pg||
nt|blum1956: Not easy to check for a @cQ using RKCB. Other method needed|pg||
nt|haans: EWE does not have 4@H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: or 3@C repeat Stayman |pg||
pc|s4|nt|blum1956: What kind of NT range do all these people have?|pg||
nt|haans: Repeat Stayman normal in Norway|pg||
nt|haans: mostly 15-17 or Big Clubs then 14-16|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but difficult to find now|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I would bid 3 h's on Norths hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not easy to play |pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: bt pairs ab -16 last rnd!|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I do believe they can make this|pg||
nt|sharkey: underbid this time....|pg||
nt|baardolav: +1|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like the cuk|pg||
nt|yo_yo: duck|pg||

nt|olliebol: well bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hmm 5@C was overdoing it a bit imo|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: most will bid 4@H -1 but 2@D?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: :)|pg||
nt|haans: right track|pg||
nt|yo_yo: declarer is suspicious|pg||
pc|d5|nt|blum1956: Why not 1NT then?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like a weak/mini opening NT and 1@C includes balanced 15+|pg||
nt|haans: some play it weaker|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|blum1956: I would risked 6@c havin S's hand|pg||
nt|baardolav: or +2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Combined 23 count - not usually enough for 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: tghe mp fCTOR I SUPPOSE|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|haans: did hear you :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: north must of course attack the entries to dummy|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Tore i dont understand what that means|pg||
nt|lestergold: iu ,ight have expected a part score battle in the minors here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: ay the same toime putting declarer to a guess|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cuttysark: But North has excellent cards - maybe he should push|pg||
nt|haans: in mu book 4@D was a clear invite|pg||
nt|bvdahl: N must duck @d 3 times and the contract should be 1 off as long as S keeps all his clubs|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|bvdahl: if pd is void in spades, 6@d can't be far off....|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: most would bid 2@D MIchael and 4@H soon|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: weak nt standard in Denmark and south sweden |pg||
nt|bvdahl: now there is a chance to find the hearts|pg||
nt|haans: how to handle @H|pg||

nt|vugraphzpu: Sry no TL internet conn , so results are available first after finishing sessions|pg||
nt|haans: 110|pg||
pc|h5|nt|blum1956: will S believe the @c10 is a honest card?|pg||
nt|frankaus: is this a real restricted choice ??|pg||
nt|rmb1: No.  I think it would be right to play @C10 from 10x, so parnter can score his potential Q|pg||
nt|haans: asking to you have singel in their suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Could he not double to show a better hand?|pg||
nt|baardolav: in my book 4@d is a clear fight... for invite bid something else|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|rmb1: @SJ was a good try (worth thinking about) but the spade pips are good enough for declarer|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: @SJ psyching play|pg||
pc|sT|nt|blum1956: Clearly he may deduce the @c10 is not a singleton as the defence should set the contract by the @sK in the 2nd trick. But it may be doubleton|pg||
nt|frankaus: at this level @Ct is mandatory|pg||
nt|frankaus: from Tx|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|haans: and off you go :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would have preferred south to underlead @D too, return the compliment|pg||

pc|c9|nt|bvdahl: now 10, on a club lead probably 8|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|blum1956: bravo!|pg||
nt|frankaus: good "nose"|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h9|nt|cuttysark: I agree - rebidding your suit is usually the weakest option|pg||

nt|baardolav: 1spade - 2spade - 3spade... not invite ... same here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - the idea that bridge could be fun!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: results are to be updated after a short delay. |pg||

pc|c5|pc|hJ|nt|haans: NS the winners|pg||

pc|c4|pc|sJ|nt|blum1956: Siv Thoresen calculated E's hand. He has 4 hearts, 4 clubs as he played, probably 3+ diamonds (she has only one) hence 2 spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Wow - that looks a very cautious position|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would certainly bid some number of NT, partner would transfer, we would reach 4@H|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|blum1956: What is the correct opening by W 3rd in hand? 1@h which he chose or some kind of weak 2?|pg||
nt|haans: is that winning MP?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: would be a good hand to play walsh. Then S could re bid 1 NT|pg||
nt|olliebol: in fact give it one good try(4@s) and leave the rest to partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 1H 4 me  -i never open weak with 2 aces|pg||
nt|bvdahl: in walsh 1D denies 4 card major if not strong enough to fore to game later|pg||
nt|bvdahl: force|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so with 12-14 and 4 card major, opener can re-bid 1 NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the lady in the spotlight again|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: @sA is clearly the best lead|pg||

nt|lestergold: hard to reach on most bidding sequences|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|blum1956: even vulnerable 3rd hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N is also a better contract as it makes when hearts misbehave|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I am all for opening 1NT with 5 card major since it solves so many rebidding problems, but E's hand is not an 1NT opening bid in my opinion|pg||
pc|c4|nt|baardolav: yeah... and this time 3@d will not be a good score when 4@h makes easaly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: win & ruff @C?|pg||

nt|lestergold: 3 rounds of hearts can create a guess for declarer when the T@s ruffs in|pg||
pc|h6|nt|olliebol: not any more i guess|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|rmb1: At least North can make his clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Then they will avoid the ridiculous 3NT|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, in the end they found the right spot :)|pg||
nt|haans: halve pom|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: some may bid 4NT as Blackwood taken as invite|pg||
nt|haans: prom|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bvdahl: very descriptive since 2 clubs denies 4 card spades|pg||
nt|yo_yo: last chance Moen |pg||
pc|c3|nt|cuttysark: Yes - fortunately there is no diamond ruff|pg||
nt|haans: be a good boy say nthank you opps|pg||
nt|sharkey: I just can't see West has any extras... agree with Liz East shud probably take the plunge and bid it himself|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|blum1956: I'd probably bid 2@c majors on the previous board. The standard for S is to bid 2@d with majors equal in length or 3-2. Then N bids 2@h|pg||
nt|bvdahl: it could be, but he can finess the @s9|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|rmb1: When I was young, we called it "Crowhurst" "reverse Pottage" or even "Egattop"|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bet he wouldnt  but no story now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: passivity clearly incorrect|pg||

nt|bvdahl: yes, the 5th @S is big when you can assume pd has 4|pg||

nt|yo_yo: oooh a mini NT  that's exciting|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Wk Nt|pg||
mb|1S|nt|blum1956: It was possible to defend this 1NT - E should have played the @sQ in the 3rd trick|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3 NT with club lead...?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, I think there are not enough tricks on a h lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Multi|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|rmb1: EW want to play in NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|bvdahl: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: many xx or bid 5 carder|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a bit difficult now for Hjerkinn|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3NT or 3@S?|pg||

nt|vugraphzpu: Chicken, some told!:):(|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: nt good for 11 tricks with best play|pg||
nt|bvdahl: agree|pg||
nt|haans: very rare that x of 2@H is for penalty|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That QJ9 combination is tempting - but I prefer to elad from kings, just to be contrary|pg||
nt|olliebol: east promises both majors weak here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a form of stayman I dont know|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: wk Stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Does "good play" involve running @S7|pg||

nt|lestergold: 4@H with good prospects|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|haans: standard t/o in my book|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I would probably open 1 h's, but that might just be me...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bvdahl: after passing in opening?|pg||
nt|olliebol: but i guess 2@s after 2@d wasnt available|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3 @S 1 @H 1@D and 3@C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and the mini struck!|pg||
nt|haans: did not see 2@S as forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: is leading away from a K a good idea at mps even in n unbid suit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yo_yo: nor me|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: not any obvious lead choice tho|pg||
pc|d3|nt|blum1956: A small @S lead could be somewhat confusing for the declarer as the club switch looks dangerous|pg||
nt|rmb1: Could just play @HK from hand - but people accuse you of peeking if you do that :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|haans: not wrong to bid 3@H|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: :) who could they|pg||
nt|rmb1: Where is the ninth trick|pg||
nt|frankaus: need a help doubt if it will happen|pg||
nt|blum1956: Not enough entries to set up a club trick|pg||
nt|bvdahl: doesn't matter now, but isn't it better to play diamond to the T in case KJx is onside?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|haans: good 3@S was available|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's so annoying when the mini NT scores a victory :)|pg||
nt|haans: for South|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N makes a scards lie but only a combined 24 and no great fit i dont think bidding game was compulsory on these cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: may well not cost as a spade can be estgablished for a club discard|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: coteray is not MP|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cuttysark: Wise to go after clubs - he knew they would switch to hearts if he played diamonds|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|haans: i think Strand would be naked then|pg||
nt|bvdahl: if you are going to bod 2h's, you might as wll open  h|pg||

nt|bvdahl: bid 3h's|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bvdahl: a bit dyslectic all of a sudden|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|sharkey: running scores are not posted on the internet - unforunately|pg||
pc|h3|nt|blum1956: It must be clear for E that the las club is with N|pg||
nt|blum1956: So he probably will play diamonds wrong way|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: E is thinking heavily|pg||
nt|haans: odds for that|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H to rock the boat|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bvdahl: anyone for balancing 2@H on north's hand?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Balancing is good - but I really hate this 5332 shape and the cards are just wrong|pg||
nt|sharkey: not me - showing my age...|pg||
nt|baardolav: I am balancing|pg||
nt|sharkey: also - pd always shows up with x or xx in @H when I do|pg||
nt|haans: balancing should have a singelton or else pass|pg||
nt|baardolav: if partner have a single heart he would bid first round with his points:)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think I would balance. More variance, but I think you'll gain in the long run|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Balancing works here because you can escape for 1 down - but how luvky is it to find partner with 4trump and good fillers, and they cannot ruff a spade?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Johnny Moen- Olav Hjerkinn is a very experienced pair from Ski BC, both old friends of mine. Tough players as well|pg||
nt|haans: balance and go down what fun it that|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why not bid with S hand - showing Majors?|pg||
nt|haans: couse p would bid 2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Going down has to be fun - or we would not play :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: After all - pd has some points|pg||
nt|bvdahl: always fun the endplay at trick 11 to make only -500 :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: to find, I mean|pg||
nt|baardolav: if you will not go down... then you have to go home|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Odd-Roger Nielsen- Didrik Ueland is among the youngsters in "Tempoknektene", eager for play. Promising pair. |pg||
nt|sharkey: youth = overbidding sometimes...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|s3|pc|d6|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|s6|nt|haans: good play :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, but he might think it is too risky|pg||
nt|bvdahl: if North has Ax, they cash the last 4 tricks|pg||

nt|blum1956: Didn't he make 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|haans: Operator 10 tricks?|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|bvdahl: if he wants to pitch hearts on diamonds|pg||

pc|s4|nt|haans: only his second spade|pg||
nt|bvdahl: now it can be only -1|pg||
nt|haans: Swendsen|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: an argument for taking insurance an bidding the 'phantom' here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|blum1956: And that is a problem for E as he/she has  good hand but no aces. The problem was solved by answering some kind of Blackwood, I guess|pg||

pc|d8|nt|yo_yo: i think Uttisrud 100 % to blame for this debacle|pg||
nt|haans: if MP no insurance|pg||
nt|lestergold: I dont fully understand their biddin g methods but it seems that it wold be normnal here for south to bid 5@d|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s3|nt|sharkey: next...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely you cant bid 3@D which might be 0 points when you have a near opener|pg||

nt|bvdahl: I think with 5@c in north's hand it is possible to get -4 with a singleton @d lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite Baard|pg||
nt|lestergold: my experience here is that they probab;y make 4@s when you have so much in partner's long suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is alaso the arguiment is taht god gace you a singleton in order to lead it for a ruff|pg||

pc|s5|nt|blum1956: After W did not bid any number of diamonds E may lead a club wich gives declarer a chance|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: swinging the hammer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope he didnt bid it in annoyance at the last hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: no skweeze|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sharkey: sry - he has not|pg||
nt|bvdahl: You can consider bidding 4 NT over pd's x|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|olliebol: bidding is going out of hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bvdahl: ha can see a cl ruff for pd now|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @C ruff|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think the double was penalty suggestion|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: very unlucky this 4/1 spade break|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not take out|pg||
nt|olliebol: it was opening and clubs |pg||

pc|h2|nt|olliebol: but due to clubs 33 dec can come to 7 tricks if def doesnt find @d shift|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has Ingunn suggested @C the way she played @S?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bvdahl: the x cannot be based on spades. Seem likely that E has at least 4 card support in one minor|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, the result will probably be ok|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

mb|p|pc|sA|nt|haans: weak NT at its best in MP land|pg||

nt|bvdahl: hehe, not so hard, it seems|pg||
nt|haans: rite u r|pg||
nt|haans: not even Rekstad can understand he have 2 aces|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 4 cl makes EW|pg||
nt|olliebol: is this a mixed raise?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah they had a bid available|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rmb1: @S is a better 7 card "fit" because they break 3-3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: best lead for decl :)|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|haans: best MP contract|pg||
nt|olliebol: i think so a little bit preemptive plus some defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: 44@h seems very aggressive not even a trial bid|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bvdahl: yes|pg||
pc|s5|nt|blum1956: 3@c id not what N likes to hear from S. Still he bids a game which will go down|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Tore what was 3@D?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|haans: 60 hcp out|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not sure I agree|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think E has shown his hand after the x|pg||
nt|haans: was dynamic biddin|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely they will reach game, opening bid + opening bid = game|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h off probably|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|haans: last word: elektron78: lol...H ruff|pg||

pc|d5|nt|haans: and can enter with @H9|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, but presumably 3D showed a decent hand since he didn't use lebensohl|pg||
nt|bvdahl: amd then showed more with x|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|haans: still no spade trick to them|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yo_yo: Feness unlikely to lead @S when his partner bids @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i meant that 3n was a much better game here than 4H which will be bid quite often|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: c finess maked|pg||
nt|olliebol: no i dont but it looks good |pg||
pc|s6|pc|d3|nt|bvdahl: 8 loser hand and probably not more  than 9 trumps|pg||
