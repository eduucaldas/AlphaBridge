nt|peachy: Hello Michael, Janis and Marchall|pg||
pc|c6|nt|doks: Norway Line-up is very close to Bermuda Bowl team rooster|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: close decision, i think, on opening lead. the fact that S has passed 2N does not deny longish clubs|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: against 2N, often the goal is not to give tricks away. a heart lead is perhaps less likely  to do so than a club, and at the same time it might hit a jackpot|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|peachy: At IMP scoring, a faiely common approach is not to invite, either play 1NT or 3NT, but the invite and decline worked here|pg||

nt|henryb:  except that the auction will start with N, and 1@c|pg||
nt|daman: oh  gag    right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Remember that this is IMP Pairs, so overtricks are not that significant|pg||

nt|daman: only in parts near the NY border|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: Hi Ugis|pg||

nt|sybarra: think its a 4 @S you want to be in  dont you?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 5 @H  = insurance?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not much to say about this hand Salensmind very aggresice nt overcall and n/s quickly outbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Now 3NT is out of the question|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last chance was over 3@D|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S  makes life awkward for north    he cant bid 3NT  or ask for a heart stop|pg||
nt|henryb:  and a @c lead will beat 4@s|pg||
nt|ugis: they can go down in 6nt on board 10|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i wld disagree w 1N in case they play a natural sys, wld rather pick a Double, however that 1N range seems part of their  CC|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: nice play|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|henryb:  At the other table North saw no reason to bid immediately, allowing south to bid 2@s and then 3N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even that could be not enough|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 4H a dangerous call with such a great hand for clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, 4@H sounds as if it has "to play" ovetones|pg||
nt|doks: 4@H must be strong hand with @H and @S shortness :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S can envision a slam facing even less than a positive response, given the right honour location|pg||
nt|blum1956: Even with this disappointing S's bid Prokhorov has a problem|pg||
nt|doks: after 1@S-3@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: basically S has to bid 4H with any real onesuiter in hearts, lest further bidding by opps shut the suit out altogether. admittedly, this danger is not as great as if opps were NV|pg||
nt|blum1956: Kholomeev is a very practical player and he does not like to study marginal slam possibilities. Even not that marginal|pg||
nt|doks: not easy for N, S can hold like6@H-4@D @Sx|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: this is not marginal. slam is basically cold facing the right 2 kings, and N is a huge favorite to have club king at least|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: so @C support not necessary|pg||
nt|blum1956: ok, 6@c back in the picture|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S cant bid less than 6C now i think|pg||

nt|mr murray: hi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless Southt akes4@S as showing good heart support, but even then 6@C offers the choice|pg||
nt|blum1956: The only (real) danger is that Vadim prefers 6@h|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North reckons that if South does not have a club fit he must have very strong hearts|pg||

nt|mdgraham: It is interesting to see that the opening pass was a factor in this. After 1@S-p-3@s, South had to bid 4@H. 6@c never in the picture |pg||
nt|doks: here auditorium divided on Norvay or Russia supporters, like live action|pg||
nt|blum1956: The declarer may like to make a heart finess in the second trick - the losing line|pg||
nt|ritong: east is known to hold 4@ss, one of the red kings and likely a shortness somewhere|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is it certain that hs has a king?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: 3-2 trumps a better bet than heart finesse. declarer will think a long time about possibilities of combining chgances though|pg||

nt|marlowepi: well, but E needs shape for his jumpo raise|pg||
nt|marlowepi: where else would it be?|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably S should have taken the @sA, played the @hA, then AJ of clubs and a heart|pg||
nt|blum1956: the defence has then not enough time to knock out both the last trump and the @dA from S's hand|pg||

nt|marlowepi: geir knows a spade wont cash and that a forcing game is only likely to help declarer as there are entry problems|pg||

nt|blum1956: 1@s passed over - a huge plus instead of minus|pg||
nt|h_karluk: salensmind thought pass smart choice|pg||
nt|lestergold: mayeb they have an agreement that they must reopen otherwise west's action makes no sense at all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he had just 13, lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean 1N  in that aucrtion in natural bidding promises a mountain|pg||
nt|blum1956: With that kind of agreement Saelensminde's pass should have been alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: even a rose garden|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|ugis: well, I guess he could have made 3nt, 5h, 2d,1s,1c|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S looks normal|pg||
mb|d|mb|5C|nt|haans: 5@C a maybe|pg||
nt|ugis: 2cl agressive...would you overcall 2cl?|pg||
nt|ady: level vulnerability   e/w way over the top|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: yeah Ugis, still flits across my mind|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: good lead|pg||

nt|jcwla: Hmm... surprised did not look for an 8-card fit at 2 level.|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C not me|pg||
pc|cA|nt|blum1956: looks like 3 off|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w in kami kaze mode|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: n/s can make  6@S   but not guaranteed|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|lestergold: this could lead to a massive penalty 3 dims a club 5 hearts availabkle for defence|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sQ|nt|ady: I suppose could get diamond wrong|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ady: will have to get diamond right    instead of an easy 500 and a possible 800|pg||
pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: one of everything else etc etc :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: How does 2@C play for example?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzpr: not anymore|pg||
nt|henryb:  Its hard to see what else South should do, but South can make a major suit slam opposite either West or North|pg||
nt|ady: hand 7 played in 3NT here   CR reached 7@C     tried heart finesse to get spade loser away   ended up down 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  So maybe he should do something else: 5N? 6@c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: the last table finally finished this board. The round 3 will begin shortly|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: the results can be found http://bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/rig10/invitational/rig10invr.htm|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: hm i think the great norwegian has pushed his luck tioo far|pg||

nt|blum1956: Koistinen should have pointed out his heart values while playing diamond cards - Nyberg would not make a mistake of ducking the second club then|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of beer i would think|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe vodka out there|pg||
nt|blum1956: but the defens still has a last chance|pg||
nt|ugis: vodka only for commentators :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: *the defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzpr: well there is beer on the table. Norwegian brought it for his partner and the opponents :)|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||

pc|h8|nt|ugis: Q of clubs was a wrong card...|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s3|pc|h5|pg||

nt|h_karluk: supposedly LTC even not close :)|pg||
