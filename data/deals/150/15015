nt|Walddk2: Some play Smolen here in order to make the strong hand declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: EW play puppet over 2nt and hence that smollen hand is handled via trf and 3s|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|rv: hence West is only showing 54 in majors|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rv: 4@d shows @s fit, 4@c would have shown @h fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: that 4D is promising for W who has a stiff club and hence no wastage in clubs -but still he has inadequate values for slam|pg||
nt|rv: KRV signs-off since he has no slam interest|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right, but on a good day Kista could have had @SQ instead of @CQ and then the slam would be good|pg||
