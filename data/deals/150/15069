pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|benjent: 1@c was natural or balanced (12-14 or 18-20); 1@d was negative or various positive hands with @d's|pg||
nt|psridhar: Verhees's pass in 1st round seems to hv led to missing game in other room|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|snowface: with 9-13 Danny could also have opened 1NT. That explains merijn's thinking over 3NT|pg||
nt|snowface: explains more, i should say|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is practical but can be beaten|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: would he usually open 1NT with a 6322 distribution?|pg||
nt|snowface: not necessarily, but he could|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: ok|pg||

pc|d3|nt|sybarra: sort of like transfers over 1 nt |pg||

mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Welcome Bill|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Typical|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You try an off-shape 1NT overcall and partner takes out into your singleton|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: east won't be too happy about 2@S, given that his partner hasn't got a good enough suit to bid 1@S over 1@D - maybe he is wondering if 3@C will be taken as super-accept for spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Looks a little bit strange - first try 1@c redoubled on 3-2 and then treat doubles as take-out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure I would know what 3@C is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner could have bid 2@C if he has clubs|pg||
nt|psridhar: yeah tough to believe 1NTer is correcting the part score|pg||
nt|athene: West surely hasn't got anything to think about if he knows what is going on?|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe he is worried that his partner thought they played system on over the 1nt overcall so 2@S was transfer to clubs :) tangled webs...|pg||
nt|benjent: If East had @s support, he should just raise ... so 3@c raw should be au natural|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3@c goes less off than 2@s or 1NT do|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Their card says "cue" is forcing after this 1NT, so I expect they both know that 2@s is natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzqg: BBO line-up for the next round: OR Verhees-van Prooijen vs J. Hop-de Pagter|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Ben's point is valid. Muller had 3@D, 3@H and 3@S available to show a spade raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzqg: CR Bas Drijver-Brink vs Bob Drijver-T.Verbeek|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|sybarra: for those asking |pg||
mb|1N|nt|snowface: 1@d now shows any 0-9 hcp hand. |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/  Click on Competitie (top), then Uitslagen, and finally on Twaalfde Witte Huis Top Twaalf Toernooi for results|pg||
mb|2D!|an|4+ hearts or minors|nt|shevek: in the 1st board we watched (17) they bid and made 3N in the other room|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|snowface: 1@h is natural with about 10-20 hcp|pg||
nt|snowface: so 1Nt is natural with about 5-9|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: what would 1NT by N have been Diederik?|pg||
nt|snowface: ignore 1@d and we are bidding pretty standard|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was Brink and Drijver |pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: no punishment??|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: I am not sure what the 1NT shows, I expect 15-17|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzqh: so 15-17?|pg||
nt|snowface: 1NT would have been about 16-19 with no 4M|pg||

nt|vugraphzqh: so we are skipping it|pg||
nt|snowface: true, but they need all their attention for the system. :-)|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, W(estra) elected to balance over N's 1N opening, which was not a s success|pg||
nt|sybarra: but -200 is never a good score |pg||

mb|2H!|an|good hand with diamonds|mb|4H|nt|snowface: showing 9+ with clubs or 15+ NT|pg||
nt|snowface: or some strong hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Diederik,  any requirements from the tourney re permission to play the system or writing any defenses out? |pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: looks right to bid 3@c now|pg||

nt|snowface: but I don't know details|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: nah|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: hmm|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzqh: but the opponents asked for recommendations against the fert 1D and they gave some|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: nothing written down|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: looks like -1 XX |pg||
nt|snowface: 1@d is best treated as a precision 1@d opening when it shows practically an unknown distri in minors|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow, here we go again |pg||
nt|shevek: they haven't find their @s fit yet?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: 2H was explained by Westra as good hand with diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: however, E obviously intended it as 5+ or 6+ @s, which is fairly standard here|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, curious sacrifice against 3N|pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|sybarra: wonder if it meant spades? |pg||
nt|shevek: never mind 4@s not on|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Ricco: Do you have any alternative explanations besides good hand with diamonds?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Berry: No... well... I thought we only played it after 1C but it could be 6+ spades|pg||
nt|shevek: Ricco thinks "who has the @ss"  :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Berry has been sent to the bathroom and Huub explains: weak or strong with 6+ spades|pg||
nt|shevek: I like "has been sent to the bathroom"  lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: Ricco was asking questions to Westra and at some point Bertens said, wouldn't this all be easier if you just went to the bathroom?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||

pc|hK|nt|vugraphzqh: even though Molenaar has good support for diamonds and spades, I don't like the pass|pg||
nt|snowface: most work with playing as system like this is the agreements in situations like these|pg||
nt|vugraphzqh: it seems like a good opportunity to show your long clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont know the system but surprised red, he didnt bid 2 nt |pg||
nt|snowface: 1@c was natural and unbalanced and 9+ hcp|pg||
nt|snowface: rest was pretty normal|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 3 clubs from N agree, you might not take any club tricks given the XX |pg||
nt|snowface: give |pg||

nt|blum1956: Does this lead save a trick for the declarer?|pg||
