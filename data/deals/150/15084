nt|haans: but ...|pg||
nt|jaheim: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: East elected to bid NV - not unexpected|pg||

nt|haans: or not|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: hi all|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: i must admit that as south i would chance a double here i like to earn imps|pg||
nt|jaheim: NS  won the mixed pair chship this year|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and adopting the trend towards 5 rather than 6 card suit|pg||
nt|jaheim: lots of toppairs playing 2 @D as a weak muli   and 2 @H @S as a serious weak 2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: presumably S cannot open 2H, but a more likely alternative would seem to be 1H. cant argue with success though:)|pg||
nt|chick: Pass by S is also an alternative :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very odd to bid 4H when 3N is virtually sure to go down|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: I see 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|lestergold: nom heart ruff but an immediate diamond swirtch and force will be uncomfortabelm fro declarer|pg||
nt|haans: slam possible :)|pg||
nt|april7: very aggressive bid by E|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 @D   prob   1 major|pg||

nt|haans: why 4@H?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: i prefer 1@H to 3|pg||
nt|chick: with 2 aces and 3 hearts, N must know that 3N is doomed.   must be he thought 4@H was makeable|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case why wouldnt he bid it on the porevious round?|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: certainly true that Pass is an option for S. my comment about 1H was based on the manifest intention of S to do something other than the textbook pass, so i whould have prefaced my ...|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: certainly there are hands where 3N could make and 4HX be a good save -- mostly they start with a longish minor lacking only the ace plus two heart stoppers and enough spade tricks ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to get to nine. but it is extremely pessimistic to save since there are zillions of hands where 3N fails, maybe by several tricks. so if you don;t try for that kind of good result ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when your preempt creates the opportunity, you ought to stop  preempoting|pg||
nt|davidstern: Irashaimase Nobu|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: vi ligger litt foran :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - problem was S was on lead - likely to favor declarer|pg||
nt|haans: we will not get abid fron West|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sorry, missed a few rounds as I had to get the phone|pg||
nt|april7: might end up in 4@S by NS or 5@H by EW|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: or will we?|pg||
nt|haans: assume X is penalty|pg||
nt|haans: weak openings make it harder for opps to bid their cards|pg||
mb|r|nt|jaheim: will end up in 4 @H|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Aha! I was at the Hamliton closing ceremony. No doubt you will remember the Maori dancers :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaheim: evt   2 nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: Det var vel alternativet|pg||

nt|sharkey: God strategi å sette press på motstanderne i gunstig sone|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|haans: if they make 1NTx they do not get game |pg||

nt|mdgraham: we can see that spade intervention might make this tricky, but the chance for that has gone|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: technically 4@s is a vbiablem save but who is gonna bid it it could be heading for 800 not agood imnvestment unless you cansee al the cards|pg||

nt|marlowepi: as a very active player, S must be disappointed to be in 4th shair with that hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: At least Helness eventually got a @C trick :)|pg||

nt|april7: S might bid NT over N's overcall of 1 @S and play there|pg||

mb|d|nt|sharkey: Spørs om NS kan få med seg @H stikkene her|pg||
nt|haans: no support x|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2D is the obvious call but it has the disadvantage of letting W bid hearts cheaply|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good hand for transfers faci ng overcalkls|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W passed?|pg||
nt|april7: W should have opened the bidding|pg||
nt|jaheim: My money is on "Filosofene"   any sidebets   ?  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: @C systems handle east's hand easily.  But if you're willing to open the correct 1@D, standard shouldn't have a huge problem, either.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sharkey: *Multi|pg||
nt|lestergold: festering awful wouldnt do it myself at equal vul|pg||
nt|lestergold: here it might make e/w auction difficult|pg||
nt|sharkey: Can't be distributional values either....|pg||
nt|april7: then K of @S extracts last trum, should play @C to hand and the @H|pg||
nt|jaheim: 4 @D from Aabye ?|pg||
nt|april7: now 1NT pass pass pass |pg||
nt|davidstern: Not a fan of the pass by W - I would prefer to bid 2@C to let partner know I have values else I will be under pressure later|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Ø dukker en @S og NS må ta beiten på direkten|pg||
nt|chick: it looked same to me, but we trust our operator :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E hates this hand!!|pg||
nt|davidstern: We likely have 50% + of the points and partner doesnt know it|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2@D by E???|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: will be by S|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: but west has a monster over east's bidding so should go on|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well im really getti9ng a full dose of commentatr's curse today|pg||
nt|sharkey: Whar would you bid Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: west's pass verylazy in my view and suicidal in a teams game|pg||
nt|lestergold: im 61 this month and feel about 18 mentally- er physically notm quite that|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@d is a weak multi|pg||
nt|davidstern: Methinks too|pg||
mb|d|nt|jaheim: K of cl and a claim?|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club at its best|pg||
nt|baardolav: this will make +2 or something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2@d is a Multi, South can respond 2@h (pass/correct) or 2@S (pass/3@h). His hearts are good, could easily have bid 2@s   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: South with long hearts assumes his partner has spades :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@s is natural not forcing in weak multi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can play it that way.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: headed for game not making perhaps|pg||
nt|chick: this can make 4@H but not 5@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lesser evil and pass by E.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Pas probably limits the damage as any EW contract would be pretty expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @S slam can make, but unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: an aggressive lead which on this layout costs a trick|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: i have stopped bidding 4@H 30 years ago|pg||
nt|haans: support x better than delayed support|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: i would bid something - choice between 4n and 5H not easy but i would fera missing slam to much not to make a try|pg||
nt|sharkey: @CJ Jan Arne - and claim :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally prefer to use a 2@C rebid after 1@D opening to show a good hand. Gives you room to explore below 3N, at a cost on some natural auctions on lesser hands.|pg||
nt|chick: wow, I would never sell out with S's hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud be off 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: mm  |pg||

nt|npcjpn: dbl by West show @H and some @s?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jaheim: mm   5 @D  -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@d can lose spade heart and @d 3n very vulnerable too|pg||
nt|sharkey: Agree - think he shud fight with 3@H|pg||
nt|april7: depends on the play,W might lose 1 @S,1@H 2@D and 1 @C|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|jaheim: ja   og ender opp med 2 bet |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: perfectly reasonable as games make on dim finesse|pg||
nt|jaheim: needs a sp lead to win, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n can make dpending on defence 5@d no play at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: except on spade lead|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Would you x NT after first x by W and pass by E?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W showed the other two suits by x.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think I would find the Pass, but I also think being aggressive is a winner in the long term|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: very little info from auction west has opted for non commital 'safe' trump lead|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: spade switch obvious but doesnt matter spade loser cannot go|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcarroll: AKx trumps lead would have made this a struggle for declarer|pg||
pc|d5|nt|davidstern: Four rounfs of hearts would have been best|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|othered1: At least it simplified the auction.  In standard, south's planned rebid after opening 1@D isn't easy.|pg||

nt|chick: we all know better than to bet with you, Jan :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: may keep NS out of the cold @D slam|pg||
nt|april7: just 11 tricks possible, but depends on the lead and continuation|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Depends on what x of 2@D would mean|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1 nt 4 minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 1NT is 8-15 p and at least 4-4 in @c and @d|pg||
nt|april7: do they play strong pass?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|othered1: EW will find 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well this slam wont be missed thats for sure|pg||
nt|othered1: South's double is interesting with that shape and not that many high cards|pg||
nt|haans: odd take out x|pg||
nt|henryb:  Going back to board one, where Lunna mysteriously took 12 tricks in 6N, shouldn't it be possible for big club players to reach 6@c?|pg||
nt|othered1: North has to act h ere and EW may find themselves defending a high @D contract|pg||
nt|haans: big clubs does anything :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: in board 1, Lunna got a diamond in the lead, and South was endplayed in spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose it depends on what you open 2@d on - if you can do it with 5@h, then yes, 2@S natural makes sense |pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade partial ERW and Hearts or clubs NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Kvarngraven 1st to think were are all the cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: ja   hadde gått 2 bet jeg|pg||

nt|jaheim: another slam coming up|pg||
nt|sharkey: 18-19|pg||
nt|lestergold: whether they bid the grand tho is open to question|pg||
nt|othered1: I might rebid @H on south's hand and I think it wins over the long term.|pg||
nt|haans: with u|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some would use stayman as N|pg||
nt|april7: should S open and N passes then E will come in in @H and then  perhaps 1,2,3 NT???|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Obviously the dealing machine is saving the games and slams for later in the tournament ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade lead and heart off dummy would work well for declarer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: hm that will tend to ruole out a heart contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib asked why not open weak 2@H with S hand on Bd 17.  Reason is weak 2 openings 3rd hand NV can be very weak at Expert level, and this was closer to an opening hand.  Also a ...|pg||
nt|sharkey: matter of agreement|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah this may get them to the bad game|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: tror de fleste av oss hadde det|pg||

nt|henryb:  Did South really have to act over 1@s Hans?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sharkey: 7@C makes|pg||
nt|chick: I think that hand is much too strong for a preempt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dbl looks like DONT  - six card suit somewhere. Bit thin if it is|pg||
pc|hT|nt|april7: I don't think W should pass 1@D, has 5 P!!! and then 4@H would have been reached making 5 if starts with @S finesse but 10 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|april7: down from top on @S lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: Gjetter spillet går ut|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|chick: If I get support for either suit, I don't play a 6-5 hand below game|pg||

nt|haans: dirty bridge|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcarroll: I tend to agree|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7N is technically better as well because if clubs broke badly you would have the spade position to fall back on|pg||
nt|sharkey: 7@S depending on the @S finesse|pg||
nt|april7: but after ruff S is endplayed|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: would have gone on if after 2nt invite|pg||
nt|haans: bridge not like all time|pg||
nt|haans: old|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The last thing Declarer will do is lead trumps, has to try for a semi-crossruff in the red suits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: important to know what these doubles are. After the redouble, penalty is a live possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: EW not agree about bidding|pg||

pc|s8|nt|jaheim: tull   kl Q er jo inntak  :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: funnt south doubles and east can probably manage 3@s they bid on to hopeless 4@d and let off hook|pg||
nt|othered1: right, south has a quite sound opening|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jaheim: y   think cl is trumph|pg||
nt|sharkey: The @S suit has not been mentioned so a mute point|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bid at any raTE ITS GOOD ENUF AT IMPS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe West didn't believe East could have a penalty double of 2@H when he held @HKJ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharkey: Wonder what wud happen if Jensen opened Multi 2@D here (ref previous board)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb:  I thought this was perhaps a Scandinavian requirement: see 11HCP, Pass not allowed :)|pg||

nt|lestergold: 3n N/S makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually i doubole intournament events too|pg||
nt|sharkey: dont think they've been at the rubber bridge table too often :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i gain a lot more than i lose by doubling|pg||
nt|lestergold: last hand was a stand on the chair double|pg||
nt|henryb:  Not the best result for E-W, as 4@s is easy|pg||
nt|haans: agree :)|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H might make, but I sure wouldn't be happy in it|pg||
nt|chick: of course I'm famous for detesting moysians :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: :) - dont think 4@H makes either - tapped in @S |pg||
nt|haans: but IMP so who cares :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in a short match overtricks sometimes matter|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: it was 8 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: but went quite fast in the end, so don't know exactly how|pg||
nt|haans: no good bid for E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1D seems fine to me|pg||
nt|chick: again, too good for a preempt|pg||
nt|haans: "Not for person below 100"|pg||
nt|mcarroll: now making all his small trumps with the crossruff - contract making|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H p  p  X  p 4@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sound reasonable to me|pg||
nt|april7: on @H lead then 5,on @D ace lead only 4,but bidding might develop differently|pg||
nt|chick: would you jump to game with N's hand over 3@H P P X?  partner is under pressure and doesn't have to have 20 pts for a X|pg||
nt|april7: you are right, but even over 3@S S will bid 4, but thats a different story|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: N might reopen with a X, then S might reach qa @H contract at 3 level, but EW might compete to 3 @S|pg||
nt|jaheim: i   wouldnt|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jaheim: and board 22|pg||
nt|lestergold: jsut swop around theK@d and K@c situation on last hand and u have forgone 800|pg||
nt|sharkey: 10-12 I presume|pg||
nt|lestergold: lucky last habnd was only a mere 300|pg||
nt|haans: kib: ihj: Koppang - Olsen are both seniors|pg||
nt|april7: now perhaps 2@H nonforcing?|pg||
nt|chick: sure, I would have guessed   3@H P P X P 3@S P 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: do like 2@S|pg||
nt|jaheim: right|pg||
nt|npcjpn: strong notrump again.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: form theirmn gross overbidding|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 1NT = 8-12, at least 4-4 in @h and @s|pg||
nt|jaheim: weak with majors, if i dont remember wrong|pg||
nt|haans: for first time ever(?) can we see that they have no sceens|pg||
nt|haans: Lunna right no opening|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib points out 5@C makes though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is it intermediate?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Hva gjør V?|pg||

nt|sharkey: 6@D mulig?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Plutselig har Ø et "monster" - så lenge pd ikke har meldt av 3 korts farge|pg||
nt|jaheim: men på 2 trinnet,   3 ru er 5 kort imo|pg||
nt|jaheim: D  =  3 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Surely 4@H is the bid|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: Spørs hvilke krav meldinger de har til rådighet - hvis 2 NT krav viser farge|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N migh be best on this on NS cards alone, but @H more likely to be found.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: not 2|pg||
nt|chick: moot now as W elected to treat his hand as an opening bid|pg||
nt|npcjpn: it will be tough not leading a spade.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: Good bid by Kvangraven|pg||
nt|lestergold: no lead to beat|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N|pg||
nt|sharkey: S unsure about @C suit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south may be tempted to play this in hearts|pg||
nt|jaheim: or lucky, finding p with 10 of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: if so three rounds of spades with the 9@h ruffing in would not be nice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S seems makeable on trump coup|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: may be even 6...|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would prefer 1@s, but ..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi henry:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
nt|haans: Henry :)|pg||
nt|haans: no alert of 2nt?|pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s would seem to have the advantage that it leaves more room, and your hand is better than a weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was bid as good-bad, but W is not sure. TD at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was not alerted|pg||
nt|haans: can be costly|pg||
nt|henryb:  on either side?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 4@d South African transfer to 4@S....|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Hardly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South really playing with fire here. You suspect 3@s would have been passed out|pg||
nt|jaheim: D   is @H lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: It seems the NS style may be to support immediately with 3 spades but I suspect that the bidding is consistent with 3 spades and six clubs perhaps|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: combined 24 points doesnt have to bid game|pg||

mb|5S|nt|sharkey: Vet ikke hvor N fant doblingen i Åpent Rom?|pg||

nt|chick: if 2@S is GF....|pg||
nt|jaheim: so   10 points  is enough 4 a gf?   strange|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ino may have been better supporting clubs to allow South to better judge the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Fant den her og...|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think South's hand is NTish - wud have tried 3@D to make pd bid 3 NT with @D stopper|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, its frustrating when you find later that you pushed them to a  possibly making game |pg||
nt|april7: @S @S @S the W should discard ace of @C on 3d @D|pg||
nt|davidstern: South should now bid six with the @SK and a singleton heart|pg||

nt|haans: xy Stayman in Sweden we belive that was invented in Denmark long time ago|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: agree|pg||

nt|henryb:  Suth could not affort Blackwood|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: after the 3@D rebid, most players play 3@S as competitive only - they either double or bid 3@H as a game try|pg||

nt|npcjpn: @D to 9.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: AKK is extra in it self|pg||
nt|henryb:  better case at matchpoints|pg||
nt|sharkey: We would all lead @HQ vs 3 NT and set it....|pg||
nt|chick: and I have a known double fit in the majors (assuming a normal takeout double)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 2@D to show both M and some points|pg||

nt|lestergold: both 'wrong'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, the cardinal sin, Mike. Declarer had his contract but went for overtricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Viego will suffer their first defeat |pg||
pc|d4|nt|henryb:  if partner signs off the game may be less than 50%|pg||
nt|davidstern: South will switch to a spade at a million miles and hour if East plays another diamond |pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: i see contract failed in open but surely playing on clubs declarer should make this|pg||

nt|qing: instead, Ino switched to @D and let the slam through|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|qing: so both slam hands swung Indonesia's way, the 2 swings total 47imps!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|twcho: but it is interesting to note that Indonesia declarer give up the legitimate chance of finessing in @d but rather opt for the misdefense|pg||
nt|qing: finessing @D wouldn't help|pg||
