nt|hedyg: good hand for weak 2 suiter in N but usually in Poland that is 5 5...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda4.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt they can find the slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: NV they may skimp a little?|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: sorry, but we have some problems here|pg||
nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: wrong cards?|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: redeal to 19|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: we're closing, sorry|pg||
nt|hedyg: shame, this is a very interesting hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: try again :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Third time lucky I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Both pairs play Polish @C Marcin?|pg||
nt|baldjean: I was just about to post the same :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: obserwujemy mecz dwóch pierwszych druzyn w klasyfikacji - prowadzi Henclik przed Mr¹gowi¹|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am afraid EW might try 4@s here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have Polish commentary in the closed room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome back|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2 top team on 145 or so, but bottom is closely bunched; so we expect tough fight for QF spots|pg||
nt|andyv:  that was a quick 5 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There will be a major break after segment 1 anyway|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: this is the last round and its a danish 1, so team number 1 is playing team nr 2- thats here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, 5 mins only last 2 in Poland|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  multi by E|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 13.00 and 17.00 Polish time (Paris) QF, 19.30 segment 1 of the semi-finals|pg||
nt|psridhar: danish? |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 1-2  3-4 5-6|pg||
nt|psridhar: no 1 playing no 2 is a danish design?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: this will be a 4@s|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: J.H. Monrad 1928|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|janhamhurg: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda9.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@h should be p/c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have no info, but I suspect that EW also play Polish Club|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|h_karluk: one of the best known Polish Junior pairs, Piotr Wiankowski & Michal Nowosadzki, who had also represented their country in Jesolo|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He also invented the pastry|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@S could be very wrong but you've got to bid it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this indeed really tough table, both sides established partnerships|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All Danish|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: practical bid here|pg||
nt|psridhar: friendly lead|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i would take the 10 i thk|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but the ace is best for sure|pg||
nt|psridhar: has to guess right -the queen|pg||
nt|psridhar: ace will do too|pg||
mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: yes sir, agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Boguslaw PAZUR is a famous WIM in Poland, active in International field since 1994|pg||
nt|othered1: east's first pass looks normal, though some might double 2@H as takout of @S, wh ich prevents being boosted out of the auction if dummy is weak and opener superaccepts to 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jan Lammerich|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi, welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda9.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think this should stop the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the penultimate round of 6 boards today|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Irwin Boris|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: leading team meets third place|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Two strong pairs at this table|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C probably artificial game-force|pg||
mb|3N|nt|baldjean: I doubt West will bid 5@c in this vulnerability situation|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Piotr Gawrys and Piotr Tuszynski are big boys|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi Irwin|pg||
nt|psridhar: with jack of cl coming down in 3 rounds he needs to preserve the 10|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: breaks are terrible here  so he must find a lucky way to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4-0 trump break is a little annoying. 10% risk but it happens|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: it would be great to cash 3 heart winner-- but|pg||
mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda10.html|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club switch will doom it|pg||
nt|psridhar: thats a bold 3s but his last chance to get into the auction, 4s may be right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree, don't leave partner in 3@S with a fit and a singleton|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Jan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is a sensible spot|pg||
mb|4H|nt|janhamhurg: a club switch will defeat this|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  10 tricks easy in @d... finding the 11th might have been difficult on a @d lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopteamrunda12.html  running scores|pg||
nt|psridhar: East's 1S slowed the auction down for NS-left to themselves NS might hv climbed to 4S, but cant blame E|pg||
nt|psridhar: i would read that X of 1S by South as " if my rho had passed i wd hv bid 2s pd" |pg||
nt|psridhar: the 6-1 h break makes it worse-else he can cash 3 h and cross ruff hoping for 8 trump tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Marek is an old gun, since 1978 active|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: the latest version!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@S I think|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  looks like N read it as @ss|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On a normal day 3NT would also make, but it won't here on an unlikely club lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|othered1: and double of 2@H for takout of @S isn't all that dangerous, since it implies some @H length and partner can pass with a crumby hand and a few @H.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: since the 2 heart bid limits the hand to 10 points, west 3 hearts seem optimistic|pg||
nt|h_karluk: here is a Polish bridge joke : You know that an overcall of 3Sp over 1Sp means, partner, I have a solid minor, if you have a spade stopper, please bid 3NT. But do you know the ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Polish version of that convention?:) Partner, I have a spade stopper, if you have a solid minor, please bid 3NT. :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now a dummy reversal- that works|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|baldjean: double was a bit keen, in my opinion, but it works|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think it matters actually|pg||
pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: just eleven tricks there for NS pairs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Shows 4 spades wheras 2@S would show 5, in case East has psyched|pg||
pc|h9|nt|othered1: Double on this auction was far more dangerous.|pg||
nt|psridhar: i dare say the multi let North in- if the auction were to go 2h-3d-4h-? i doubt he will bid 4s|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|baldjean: interestingly the other table landed in 3@s only|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I agree with the final contrace and will use an inviting sequence as N instead of a direct 4@s|pg||
nt|baldjean: are there any problems, operator? or is West thinkin?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unpexted to have a trump loser, but you have 22% of the time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2-1  78%|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Declarer would have been unable to untangle the trump suit anyway|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: and could have been hammered for 500, a large pick-up "out of thin air."|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: many will wonder about that 2 club bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good treatment|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Shows 18+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C is ambiguous|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: and too many losers on S for 4@s|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psridhar: this is heading towards down 1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: wouldn't keep the carpet clean|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is just cleaner|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: outch|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: unlucky id say|pg||
nt|Walddk2: why not 2, trump return?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psridhar: yes d2 now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: It's an open book to Pazur|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Never had a chance, really. May drift 2 off|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: this time he read in it|pg||
nt|psridhar: today the Polish 2 openings havent fetched|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so 3 imps here- the nice thing in Poland is- when you go down in a good slam bec of bad breaks- it doesnt cost a lot- the other pair will be down as well|pg||
nt|psridhar: we saw a wrong sided 4h last match|pg||
nt|psridhar: but this slam is a reasonable spot |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: west was thinkinh|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Let it hold and a H switch for down 2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: worst fears confirmed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a baby psyche, particularly NV, and should not work|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that was popular here as well. but today they dont psych anymore:)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: *thinking|pg||
pc|c9|pc|sJ|nt|psridhar: true, my point was that X of 1s shd show not only 4 spds but also some values|pg||
pc|cT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|baldjean: well, the thinking paid :)|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: I'm really sorry, but I missed one of former tricks :/|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: since most play a 2 cl opener as 12-16, a rebid shows 17-19|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: yes, cards are ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@D puts pressure on S |pg||
nt|hedyg: double would work well here|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that does not describe the S hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't get it (CR result)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: slam NT for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5 IMPs but still significant in a 6-board match|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as far as i remember for 220|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: normally both minors 6-9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: gotcha, thanks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT = weak with both minors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't beat it|pg||
nt|andyv:  opening lead of Q@c allowed E to claim at trick one.|pg||
nt|psridhar: the 1s o/c isnt meek either !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: devised by Pazur|pg||
nt|psridhar: we start with a misfit hand -North's minors facing South's majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: That's what N wants to hear....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even with a wasted @SQ|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hedyg: pass or 3NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda6.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C is a fine contract, even 7 has play|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ok i hear: 2club opener shows 11-14, so the 2 cl rebid shows 15+|pg||
nt|andyv:  another 4@s contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The EW hands fitting nicely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have no info regarding 2@S|pg||
mb|4D|nt|baldjean: nice slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: everyday slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he likes to attend regionals in Georgia, Atlanta, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Polish Club    1@C   1. 12-14 balanced - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. Any 18+|pg||
nt|irwinbo: many fearless folk would have opened 3 diamonds if system allowed|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 no is limited to 18, since no 1 cl opener|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't want to guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Matches of 6 boards in the qualifying|pg||
nt|othered1: south has an interesting rebid.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: must find the queen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Your guess is as good as mine|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hedyg: i must admit i would pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: me too - South's hand likely to be unbalanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: in CR it was pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@S is on as it is, but they took the money|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2007BermudaBowlShanghai/bermuda-bowl/Poland/Gierulski-Skrzypczak.pdf|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda4.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9@H just became huge|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classic 5/3 or 4/4 case|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: I have just been told that there will be a longer break than scheduled. Restart at 16.30 local time|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: next session starts 16.30|pg||
nt|baldjean: And settled for the 4/4.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's true|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Best lead for the defence, but declarer can prevail with spades 3-2 (ace on side) and hearts 3-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a great game, but makeable|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2D must be a trf to 2h -so that opener has another chance to bid|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so this is how to treat an invitational 6-3 hand- i like it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: is this gazilli?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It shows 18+ with at least 3 spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Game-forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 or 3 down this is, depending on club guess|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 300 here is a good result for east west|pg||
nt|psridhar: will|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: you got us in- you play the hand:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: @CA, spade|pg||
nt|h_karluk: undo?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Pazur supposed to pass|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: knowing 4 spades make easily, 5 clubs might be a good idea, but it will dost a fortune here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the link is for NS pair|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: close to making i thk- may be - 1 |pg||
nt|psridhar: i think it is a poor strategy to pass 2nt- with meagre values it is better to hope to make tricks with trumps|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: Bye to East's hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: West will be endplayed at some stage for minimum 9 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 2@c|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: cost|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 500 not really much of a compensation|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not my cup of tea sir, besides i am a married man, if i would open it 3@d i would be a dead meat :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 18-- wait -let me count...|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Add VAT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Tez Sen|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Diamond lead would have been more annoying|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: thanks|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: sry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would it not be 500?|pg||
nt|psridhar: gierulski must valued his 6 hcp outside spades for his overcall, he will find they hv no role to play in 4s X|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: No other line seems attractive|pg||
nt|othered1: But NS have handled this well.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think the club suit disappeared|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, it did in the 50's I suppose|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far yes|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now not even 5 level is safe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Going up all the time|pg||
nt|psridhar: and if oppo are in a mood to Double, passing 2nt tells them u r in a misfit |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|h_karluk: no worries , its okay Marcin :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Well, declarer does not agree|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: bec of 2 potential dia loser|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hearts very friendly for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could go for a zillion if clubs had been 3-1 and hearts less friendly|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: only -2 ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then you you are in danger of losing 2 spades, 1 diamond and 1 club|pg||
pc|c4|nt|janhamhurg: and a possible spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh sorry, I thought South opened 1@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  only problem with 3N is finding tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D shows an extra heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  1@S  ;  2@D   is how I thought it went|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: because theire declarer play is perfect-lol:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all :)|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: local time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has got to play a spade from dummy anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could have, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club to the king and a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he can't any more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think it well may be 1100|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there should be a good side to every situation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was an error not to cover the 8, but easier for us|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now the heart suit is dead, it is expensive|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but that's life, for every force, there is a counter force, for every negative there is a positive and for every action there is a reaction. In other words for every cause there is ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: an effect |pg||
nt|psridhar: the reason why S suggested 3nt with 6-3 in Maj is bcos he doesnt know yet about the 5 card spd with N ? |pg||
nt|andyv:  I can't imagine  S really wanted to play 3N.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: to bad- i liked the sequense so far, but passing 3 no with 2 small dia with a known spade fit is strange|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This contract has a major flaw  .... and a minor|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: and if not then E will be endplayed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Shirley|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Disappointing that clubs not were mentioned in either room|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-7|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be , cause of the 4-1 heart break, there will be a trump trick extra - so looses eventually 3 spades and a heart|pg||
mb|d!|nt|sybarra: not always recommended to underlead aces in suit contracts but this one worked well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is the easiest game now with @HA onside|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No info regarding the double, sorry|pg||
nt|athene: if you normally use double of 1nt as penalties, it's worth while having some other meaning as a passed hand of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No point in guessing|pg||
mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: likely 3n FOR EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ouch, sorry for  caps lock, my bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H both majors at the other table|pg||
nt|athene: the NS convention card says X of 1nt is 4+@S 4+ other (Lionel)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not sure what he would do if he got a 2@S response. Maybe 2NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless 2@C is Puppet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Gawrys also partner of Lesniewski |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: a 2 heart bid shows 11 +, 2 spade minimum|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: pass now would show "touch"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if you would like to see convention cards of Polish pros check this please : |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C is the best part score, but as usual clubs are lost|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://bridgefiles.net/VAR2/Vugraph/Vugraph-Poland.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Here we have it   2@D  any 18+|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Cheap penalty card - only 1 or 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing much has changed here. Cichocki would also have bid if Henclik had passed 1NT|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: well judged|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No-one had a double of 4@H|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: 6@c...:(|pg||
nt|hedyg: okok i am ambitious!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C can actually be defeated, but it takes a double dummy defence|pg||
nt|andyv:  whatever the case, 4@s certainly would have been a superior contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C serves as 4th suit forcing|pg||
nt|athene: Lionel is a good defence to 1nt if you are prepared to give up the penalty double, but it's not well-known, mainly because the inventor was from Australia i think (maybe New ...|pg||
nt|athene: Zealand)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NZ I think|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: :) - @S9 and @S10 makes the difference...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c opening is usually reserved to show a limited hand with long clubs and possibly 4-card major, similar to Precision 2@copening|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: E said: 4441 without @D or 5440 w/o @D|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so the polish handgenerator serves us a lot of highly interesting games-|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I suspect 1@H shows spades and that 4@H is a splinter for spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: rt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's pretty common to play transfer responses after a take-out double|pg||

pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: Slawek HENCLIK was partner of Boguslaw GIERULSKI between 97-99|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: thats a coffee game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ice tea rather, it's very hot here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing compared to India I guess|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: all we can have- trumps 3-2 a dia finess on, sometimes the cards are friendly-sometimes not- 28 here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: 6 NT as well|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so now he will make 5 easily|pg||
nt|psridhar: helps enormously in this deal for W to find the slam|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|h_karluk: Hey Ed, good to see you|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6NT seems to make too without the @H lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The two international teams, Svindahl (Norway) and De Botton (England/Norway) need to play very well in the last two rounds to qualify for the quarter-finals|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopteamrunda12.html|pg||

nt|andyv:  4@h=rkc?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|baldjean: 4@s is a bit too high|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NS did well to push EW one level higher|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: They would have done even better if Wejknis had led a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@d response  relay, forcing to 3@c. Opener shows a 4-card suit (3@d shows extras) or makes a choice between 2NT and 3@c with long clubs.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but we see, now he would be able to pitch 2nd @d loser to established @h K|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if they find it i won't get surprised|pg||
nt|psridhar: Hamman's rule obeyed !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Over a 1@D response it is even stronger than that I think. 20+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: game-forcing I am told, 23 or more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: starting with 1 club can be an unlimited hand, i believe after 1 dia response 2 dia is gameforcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will produce the 9th trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  and give S time to set up @hs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This sequence is pretty normal in Poland I am told. It's called PRO|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or at least 4 after this dia play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I will be, cos they are not in 3@C|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 spades is a nice contract doomed by the 5-1 split|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean you know they are card sharks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Clubs are not friendly, spades and diamonds are|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A reasonable line will see him home|pg||
nt|athene: knowing that south has both majors, declarer certainly won't imagine the diamonds play for four tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, and he also fears that @SK is offside|pg||
nt|athene: a kibitzer suggests exiting a heart now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A remedy is often to let the opponents have the tricks they are entitled to|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he can be certain that hearts are 5-3|pg||
nt|athene: with the spade finesse there are eight tricks, and declarer might hope for a minor-suit squeeze on north if south cashes the hearts out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It would look silly if South has 4 winners now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Which I think is mandatory on this auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I suppose he can make this if he did not get a heart back|pg||
nt|psridhar: with spds 3-3 , 12 tricks|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: since spades are 3-3 no problem anyway|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: That is very impressive by Skrz!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he can't because he must play a spade honour when overruffed|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: agree, heart was nessesary to prevent a low spade from table|pg||
nt|andyv:  they got there.... so 4@h just a cue|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that makes the rest cuebidding!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think Kickback is mainstream in Poland|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i like this 3 club bid! will take it into my convention list!|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess not judging from the spec responses:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Jan, you have to take the whole thing!|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sure! most of it is brilliant the rest just fine|pg||
nt|psridhar: gierulski still in the tanl for the lead?|pg||
nt|psridhar: tank|pg||
nt|psridhar: he does put in plenty of energy on opening leads !|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: he is still thinking|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i see 11 top tricks, and a small problem if a club is ducked|pg||
nt|andyv:  j@s a huge card in dummy|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: club 8 is fine as well|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: We had that theme before|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When Nowosadzki did|pg||

nt|othered1: I agree, especially on an auction where you know you have the balance of power|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some have never led one in their lives|pg||

nt|h_karluk: way eleven|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: exactly- a rare bird comes as a couple|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: But it is a very popular lead among the great Italian players|pg||
pc|d7|nt|h_karluk: I guess Boguslaw would never stop his inventions, each year hard to reach it as a VG commentator remember him since 2007|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: 2@h/2@s response to 2@c not forcing, good 5-card suit (711 HCP)|pg||

nt|psridhar: If W had passed , E opens 1N and right sides 4H via trf|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: a dia lead is worse|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sorry, a  club is best|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: "You will get it back with interest"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it was like lunar eclipse for Michal|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: east west missed their heart game, but 3 no was making as well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  1. 12-14 balanced - 2. 15+ w clubs - 3. Any 18+|pg||
nt|psridhar: undo|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|Walddk2: They won the Vanderbilt 2008|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: sandra landy http://www.ebu.co.uk/general/biographies/players/sandralandy.htm|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like north is choosing to bid his hand out, rather than the simple raise to 3N in the CR|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: to make 4 hearts now you need to have a look into opponents cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Marcin?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure it was feasible the way hearts were played|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|janhamhurg: 2 heart now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: double obviously shows the 18+ hand|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d showing 8+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you need to be at the table and know their agreements|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: does East move to game?  I do |pg||
nt|sybarra: however the jxx of clubs doesnt look great |pg||
nt|baldjean: aftr what West shows he must be short in @c|pg||
nt|othered1: Wasn't ther a Garozzo tip on the same theme as well, especially against part score contracts|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: nice bidding here, 2 no is nearly always forcing in Poland|pg||
nt|psridhar: S will hv to cash spd ace in a hurry now|pg||
nt|psridhar: he has time till he wins h ace, but cant wait to kill the spd honor in dummy|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: isnt there a discard?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: he must cash now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sopot is a seaside town in Eastern Pomerania on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea in northern Poland, with a population of approximately 40,000. Home of the annual International ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: International Baltic Bridge Congress|pg||
nt|psridhar: if only S knew his pd has the h 8....|pg||

nt|andyv:  any chance S is thinking 4@c may be stiff?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 heart is less than 7points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe this can make on raw power|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: ty Hedy|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree |pg||
nt|sybarra: should be minimum 6/4 |pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would just open 4@S as Jassem did in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doubled part score contracts mostly|pg||
nt|othered1: Pretty much "Have a reason not to lead a trump."  And then double-check it.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: In general the Polish Club 2C opening shows 12-15 points and six or more clubs or five clubs, a four card major.|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting the W hand is hard pressed to make 2@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT was without arms and legs|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 24 points 3 no is sometimes fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: South with no @C fit and a relative minimum puts the brakes on.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ok may be he can wait , bec part has a heart, and del no second entree to table|pg||
nt|tez: 3@d is natural and strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: live scores: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda4.html|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 7-4 with a rotten 4-carder is not a two-suiter in my view|pg||
nt|baldjean: what is 4@c here? a transfer to @d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or noise?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or bid 4@s after 2nt from E|pg||
nt|baldjean: I agree, Roland|pg||
nt|baldjean: especially not with those few HCP|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What do you call AK109863?|pg||
nt|sybarra: TRUMPS |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Trumps!|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: E is 9+HCP|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: W 15-17 balanced w/o 4@S with 4-5@H|pg||
nt|athene: you might make 6@D on a crossruff perhaps? throw two clubs on hearts, just lose a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/soptqrunda1.html  for running scores in all four matches|pg||
nt|athene: but EW don't get too aggressive with only a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D it is in the other room|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: These matches are played on a 20 VP scale'|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  (Balanced hands in this range with five clubs, i.e. 2335, 3235 and 3325, are opened 1C.)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1 spade, 3 hearts, 2 diamonds, 2 clubs|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: sorry|pg||
nt|psridhar: good slam|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 11 trick in 3 no, 12 in dia|pg||
nt|Walddk2: np|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 heart is a cue bid i hope|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: declarer ducked, cause he was afraid of E ruffing|pg||
nt|psridhar: Pikus did well to bid 4D, now they shd reach 6D easily|pg||
nt|Walddk2: scored now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Declarer has 8 tricks if he plays spades from the right hand, low from dummy. He may go down if he doesn't|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But first Skrz needs to duck this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They lead low from a doubleton in Poland, middle from three|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: he can take and return a dia i thk|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so ten obv in N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The auction screams for a trump lead, even from Qx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandra Landy again|pg||
nt|h_karluk: same theme :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: id prefer to get my queen home and lead a spade|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.ebu.co.uk/general/biographies/players/sandralandy.htm |pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but lacking a good suit, it wont work to often|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he'll make it|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 8 tricks as long as low @h is lead off dummy|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cool defense|pg||
nt|tez: it is logical that to lead the first suit of the declarer|pg||
pc|s6|nt|janhamhurg: they play 30 41 i guess|pg||
nt|psridhar: danger is they reach 7D...|pg||
nt|psridhar: they will find out they hold all keys and trump queen  b ut the h suit is not fetching|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: the queen of dia is not sure to be there so far|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: with hearts 4-2 grand is fine|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: tell them that the other table bid 3 no only|pg||
nt|athene: south had a tough trick 1 decision against 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: north led a small club and he had to decide whether to put in the @C8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: Here, too, declarer likely will take his 9 tricks, but running @D may make play for an overtrick possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has the 10, or the 8 is a singleton|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psridhar: it happens too often when u go down in a grand u find other tbl languished in game -cruel|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1 NT 1517 HCP, 2@s response  transfer for clubs. Opener may choose between a positive 2NT, and a negative 3@c. Responder may continue by showing shortage.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mahy shoot the moon now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he did not lead @C8 with his left hand, so it's not a singleton|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *may|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: Do you all play that convention?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The 2C opening generally promises fewer than four diamonds, but with a concentrated xx46 or xx47 2C will often be a better tactical call.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|c7|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@C may just have pushed EW one too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Henri!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, maybe uncontested 1@d>@h xfer|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 5 spades was asking for kings i thk|pg||
nt|psridhar: all is well that ends well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They were never going to find 6@D next door after North opened 1NT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|janhamhurg: they dont play puppet stayman for 6 card minor suits?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopteamrunda13.html  running scores|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Top 8 after this round qualify for the quarter-finals in (in theory) 15 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That will obviously not happen|pg||
pc|h3|nt|baldjean: declarer will have to work for this one but will be lucky because of @sQx in North|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes|pg||
pc|h9|nt|janhamhurg: and now?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: Well done by declarer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but not with random partners|pg||
pc|sT|nt|h_karluk: 2D shows either five or more hearts or exactly four spades or invitational strength 44xx or a strong supporting hand that wants to ask for keycards on the next round|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: good work|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Useful 9 IMPs in such a short match|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 26 is a big win|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda6.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A>fter 13 rounds of 6 boards the top 8 will advance to the quarter-finals later today. This is a match from round 11|pg||
nt|psridhar: the light opening of 1h in the other room sent EW on a slam hunt and ended -200|pg||
pc|c8|nt|psridhar: yes but here it is only adding to the fat :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: rich getting richer|pg||
nt|psridhar: of course it is not the problem of the rich|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5-6 is a significant swing in a 6-board match, 9 is huge|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: South is a favourite to have @SA, and you just improve your chances by leading low from dummy|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: That caters to stiff ace with South|pg||
pc|h4|nt|h_karluk:  Opener always rebids 2H with two or more hearts, otherwise he prefers 2S with four spades, otherwise 2NT or 3C, |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 imps to east west, playing the better contract only 1 off|pg||
pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: claims|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: N is thinking...|pg||
nt|psridhar: N will be surely disappointed at that 3 imp loss after finding the brilliant lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  another opening the ACBL has decided to get involved in... they won't allow a weak 2 bid if it's 5-5 in the majors.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Excellent technique|pg||
nt|h_karluk: indeed|pg||
pc|h7|nt|janhamhurg: so he deserves the 5 imps|pg||

mb|1N|nt|h_karluk: well, as its a trick taking potential game better to absorb card combinations|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A fine slam missed in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: aggressive system|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in both M|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: EW never got into the auction on board 4 at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For some reason, West passed as dealer|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so now the strong 1 club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@H or 6@S by North best|pg||
nt|tez: i prefer to open 1 nt with N hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: That's really strange.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the alternative to trying to grab your tricks at once is to sit back and let the declarer to do his own work. This policy may be indicated (a) when you've no attactive attacking ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lead and (b)) when it appears likely from the bidding that the contract will be a close affair|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @dA favorably placed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But with @DA onside it does not matter|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1S= gf artificial?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|psridhar: slam zone|pg||
nt|psridhar: or bal GF|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: great 1 sp, positiv without a major?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Less experienced players will almost always miss that inference|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: with the weak dia(0-7)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: bal 9-13 i hear|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Phantom save as 4@H won't make....|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone know what EW are playing?  They do open 2@C with long @C and a minumum (b6y their standards) opening.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: only @h a lead good|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 no about 22-23 i thk, or something special|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match and our broadcast from Poland today|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So you can't open 2@H to show both majors, but you can open 2@H to show hearts and a minor?|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i thk thats the way to treat a 6-4 hand- rebid your major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crazy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are they trying to kill bridge?|pg||
nt|tez: bad 6 card suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: I thought it unlikely there would be ace of @H lead but oh well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: and lead low to the jack|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: the 2 dia is part of multilandy|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ugly for east west now|pg||

pc|s2|nt|othered1: 1@S m ight be an Animal Blue Team opening.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting point abt their sys : 1N> 2Transfer to hearts (2@d) does not deny five spades. Responders new suit at the 3-level forces to game. Also: 1NT - 2@d; 2@h - 2@s forces to ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@h (8+ HCP)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 cl- both maj|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2dia- 1maj|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Marcin, our excellent operator in Sopot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to all our commentators throughout the day|pg||
nt|irwinbo: one try for slam?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a pleasure as always|pg||
nt|andyv:  apparently they recently voted on that... not sure what the reasoning for it as it's a mid-chart convention.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|janhamhurg: 5  cl would be a wonderfull hit|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: If @D were 3-1 this would make so EW unlucky here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jean|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: balanced wout major must be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C 15+ with less than 4 hearts|pg||
nt|tez: polish players use 2/4 lead usualy|pg||
nt|athene: if and when declarer has to guess clubs, he might get it right on the basis that east might have led a club initially if holding the queen rather than the ace|pg||
pc|h4|nt|baldjean: interesting lead; I would not have done that|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2hearts-h+min|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am pretty sure the best way to improve is just hire a pro and study the lessons|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2c denies  4 spd /5h|pg||
pc|h7|nt|h_karluk: 1@h/1@s openings in general 5 cards, 1217 HCP, 1NT response NF|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told 1@S showed: 10-14 unbalanced with 4+ @S or 10-11 5332|pg||
nt|othered1: And majors are opened in preference to a longer minor.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be a style, ie different approaches depends vulnerability|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm also told that west is a system inventor and that this is his new system.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: each year Bogo is on VG|pg||

nt|psridhar: spd 3-3|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 30 is the last board of the match and session. Restart at 16:30 local time, in 2½ hours|pg||
nt|baldjean: @c switch necessary now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: redouble = bid your major|pg||
nt|h_karluk: In Polish club, 1@c opening bid is forcing for one round but it does not necessarily show a strong hand, in most versions of this system it shows either a weak balanced hand (about ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 12-14HCP), natural 1@c opening or any strong hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On behalf of BBO, Slawek Latala has been instrumental in setting up a fine show. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|irwinbo: again well done and right sided|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If spades are 3-2, you can't go down. Rise with the ace and pull trumps. Then @HA and 10|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: easy defence-for us! cash 3 cl and play a spade-  -2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@d response has three meanings : |pg||

nt|h_karluk: 1. 1.negative: 08 HCP. In the 78 HCP range, Responder should not have a 4-card major (the response of one of a major is 7+HCP, the 1NT response is 911 HCP).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another strong result by EW at the other table|pg||
nt|athene: they will lose a couple of imps at least, though|pg||
nt|tez: but they will lose 2 imp..2@h looks like down 2|pg||
nt|athene: declarer is going to have to ruff a spade with his @HQ here so he is losing lots of trump tricks|pg||

pc|d2|nt|janhamhurg: count would be the 5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: tho i play A att K count|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|baldjean: unfortunate split for declarer in this one|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is going to get real messy (Potentially) |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2.911 unbalanced; either both minors (5-4), or one poor minor. (The hand does not qualify for any of the responses: 1NT, 2 in a minor, 3 in a minor).|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: In any case, 2@C wouldn't be my choice of contracts.  But Ew areNV so it won't be disasterous.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no offense intended, in USA std nick for such nice players is "mad scientist" :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now the 9|pg||
pc|c4|nt|janhamhurg: 5 no- sorry no queen|pg||
nt|andyv:  good spot even though 7 makes|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: with open cards - easy- i think he will setlle for 110|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|sybarra: like -2 now? |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3/5 here (throughout)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: The @H10 is a very good card|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ok i am told it shows a 4 card spade suit 9-13|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: 7@H is against the odds, roughly 53&|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that the way to do it!|pg||
nt|psridhar: Cichocki will need to hold on to those lovely spades to stop the 11th trick|pg||
pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: i guess will plahy a @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nice try|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: %|pg||
nt|andyv:  nothing fancy... N will take his tricks and stumble into making 3|pg||
nt|athene: that club shift looks odd and was of course costly|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sharkey: indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also fine|pg||
nt|tez: pitch a @c now|pg||
nt|athene: but my guess is, east hoped to put his partner in with the @CK to play another trump|pg||
nt|athene: and stop declarer ruffing a spade in his hand|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *play|pg||
nt|psridhar: if u do gamble a grand the absence of trump lead can cause u to finesse-depends on how u rate the calibre of the opg leader|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|janhamhurg: this is a better position to have in 6 i believe|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: thx mr. orlowski|pg||
pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: loser and loser|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: yes after that fine loser on loser play|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: he is under squeeze in pointed suits anyway|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|othered1: this can make now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: We assume  1-8  2-7  3-6  and 4-5  in the quarter-finals|pg||
nt|psridhar: thats 'un-danish' Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will be showing one of them, 32 boards|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: can they choose their opponents in the quarterfinals?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: read positional factor|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: West could unblock hearts high|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: Safe heart finesse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: rt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My format is a pure guess|pg||

nt|h_karluk: but that's me he's Michal :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 1 dia shows 5 dia(or good 4) remember they are juniors|pg||
nt|psridhar: 20 min..arent u sticking your neck out Jan? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: A 6@D that never will be bid...|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N and 4@H are good spots, but west has to put the brakes on.  @SA position, howeer, will let them play at the 5-level|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ultra light overcall at 2nd seat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do they play Dwururka?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes , Pazur's sys|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess so|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i respect, for sure they are experienced and have ideas|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: west might try for a slam|pg||
nt|psridhar: the descriptive value ( describes 10 cards ! )  sways in favor of 2h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can understand that you bar a 2-opening where no suit is known (Wilkosz 2@D), but as soon as one is known I can't see the problem. If you know *both* suits (like both majors), ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the problem is non-existent|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: I think Pazur's sys named as Dwururka, after Winning Polish open trial for 08 EC might update|pg||
nt|psridhar: even Roland is not sure !|pg||
nt|janhamhurg:  a bid, might be 30|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 21 minutes 38.87219 seconds approximately|pg||
pc|hA|nt|janhamhurg: x+ 1no= stronger than direct 1 no- so 19-20|pg||
nt|andyv:  worse than that|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: exiting bridge in Poland all week here, i like it a lot!|pg||
nt|andyv:  same auction at other table except E raised to game|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now it looks like a drama|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3s will result in embarassing overtrick/s|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: this 2 no is an underbid i thk|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or the pass|pg||
nt|athene: 4-4-1-4 shape is a bit awkward in Polish Club, as 4441s are in most systems; you open 1@C and often end up treating it sort of as a balanced hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|othered1: dEclarer on last hand pitched the wrong suit -- @D on @HK, @H ruff, then @S ruff with dummy's last trump would have worked|pg||
nt|andyv:  opening hand opp. opening hand with 9 card fit belong in game... no exceptions|pg||
pc|h7|nt|baldjean: or 6@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: Also  we thank Slwaek Lataia,  the organizer of this tourney.  Much appreciated by all BBO vugraph fans! |pg||
nt|othered1: How do you play 4N?  If control asking, why not immediately?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but i am afraid he changes it too much |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a new system I am told|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 cl is key card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure anyone in the ACBL can convince me|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 dia  1|pg||
nt|andyv:  does W have enough opp a typical 2@h opener to continue?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx spec,  love the insight and comments |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in 07 1@H was = 4+C, 11+, various shapes, no 4M unless 17+ with 5+C :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hey guys, i do not know today's format, but yesterday we commented along the day as swiss, 6 boards|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: back in about 2 1/2 hours |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The system is named Nail|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's true, seems latest update there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wow, cool name|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pazur is a system freak|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@h 5 cm 12-17|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: W: 18-20|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: thats a very lucky game with 24 points only, well done in closed room, so the gap will widen up|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sth funny here!|pg||
nt|tez: mrb hamdi:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: agreed, in USA we call such nice personalities as mad scientist :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.com.pl/|pg||
nt|h_karluk: one of the Pazur's sys card here : http://www.archiviobridge.it/Pazur-Zawislak.pdf|pg||
nt|psridhar: i guess 5D= accepts slam opp quanti 4nt and shows 1 ace|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: 3@c instead of 2nt resulted in 3nt on W and a @h lead from N - and down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure why Gierulski chose his weaker minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hearts are friendly, diamonds are not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So if he plays on hearts and drops @CJ he will make it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 + 3 + 2 + 4|pg||
nt|psridhar: didnt N take a chance not showing that gud dia suit opp an unltd opening? i wd thk so, 6d cd hv been right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is a losing option though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ducking now|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exactly. Then 2@S was waste of time|pg||
nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as passed hand i prefer 11 points for any action <including take out double>|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 8 of dia was count showing odd number(5)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopteamrunda11.html  running scores|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: if 4 cl is BW 4 dia is the wrong answer, if 4 cl ask for cue bid, 4 dia is  a conrol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: merhaba :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|h_karluk: maybe tried to leave space for partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe hoping that partner had more there than in diamonds|pg||
nt|psridhar: if we know what wd 3c/3d/3h by opener over 2nt mean , then we can judge better as to how auction shd hv gone|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  3@h looks like minimum hand with no shortness|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, 3@s|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: Indeed, half an hour later than scheduled on our vugraph page|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure 6@S makes...|pg||
nt|othered1: Lots and lots of cue-bids, but this isn't a very elegant contract.  Wonder if either North or South thought partner had a first round control, particularly the second @H bid by ...|pg||
nt|othered1: north (if 4@C was natural)|pg||
nt|ritong: for south, sounded like north had @h void, i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match|pg||

nt|h_karluk: last but not least, stay with us please :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: looks like W signed off due to poor quality of trumps|pg||
nt|athene: now @CA, club ruff, ace and a trump looks normal|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Interesting system, 1@C = I don't have hearts     1@S response = I don't have spades :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and thanks all, esp Marcin, i know long day there for you :) another nice biz|pg||
nt|tez: my choice is @d|pg||
pc|c5|nt|othered1: The @S bidding did give west an idea that partner had his cards elsewhere, which is a good thing|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|janhamhurg: since west ows the 9 of dia, no difference i thk|pg||

nt|h_karluk: he knows where the hearts are|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Back in Poland in 13 hours and a bit|pg||
nt|psridhar: otherwise he has a controllish hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|baldjean: 1@h loser only|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: that was the end of the match - we'll be back shortly|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, my mistake. apparently there is no wy to drop the @h|pg||
nt|baldjean: no way*|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 16.30 local time|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: thanks all, bye|pg||
nt|andyv:  they can't be playing 1430?|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer has some issues with trump control|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sir, i think that's an aggressive system|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopteamrunda12.html|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back soon with a match from the last round today|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yup|pg||
nt|h_karluk: subsequently would feel the pressure|pg||
nt|andyv:  E just needs to bid 4@s.... very little excuse to missing this game.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Back with the last round of the qualifying in 10-15 minutes|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: In the other room, Kwiecien played for East to have @CJxxx|pg||
nt|athene: east wins @SK and pins him on table with a heart|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: Nastepna sesja  zaczyna sie o 16:30   for our Polish viewers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, he has 2 keycards for clubs|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So it can't be ace asking|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: exactly 2 keycards|pg||
nt|psridhar: he can draw trumps now|pg||
nt|psridhar: making 11|pg||
nt|andyv:  i have a feeling 4@d must have shown that... otherwise is there reason for W to stop?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told 4@D is a cue bid|pg||
nt|psridhar: CR decl fell for that losing option in clubs-tho the seq of dia plays by E there showed he had the jack in 2 card ending|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bye for now|pg||
nt|baldjean: The 3nt were a shot in the dark and hit the blue.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thanks all and bye for now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say 1@h<1@s>2@s (A) p 3@d|pg||
nt|psridhar: let us keep in mind they open light|pg||
nt|tez: 10 of @c is big card now|pg||
nt|athene: now if he plays diamonds he suffers a ruff but he can't ruff another club to get back to hand to draw east's @S8|pg||
nt|tez: need right guess|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: because then he is running out of trumps|pg||
pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: likely 9 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|athene: sneaking the @S9 through gains him a tempo though!|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|janhamhurg: 6 more to mragowia- a big win for them, but i am sure we will see both teams in the quarterfinals|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10:00 Paris time, 1:00 am Los Angeles, 4:00 am New York, 9:00 am London, 6:00 pm Sydney|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the big picture appeared 90 %|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then it's a little pessimistic by West to just sign off|pg||
nt|andyv:  then why didn't W bid 4@s?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Thanks all and bye for now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will shut down and return shortly after they have made the pairings for the next round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's Swiss format now, 1st against 2nd, 3rd vs 4th, and so on|pg||
nt|othered1: are replays allowed?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Teams can't meet any other team twice in Swiss|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They can if the format is Danish (Monrad)|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  A Monrad format pairs winners vs. winners and losers vs. losers. The better known name "Swiss" system  |pg||
nt|baldjean: That's like the difference between Swiss and Danish cheese.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: J.H. Monrad, a Danish engineer, devised the movement in 1928, but for the Chess Olympics|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It was adopted by bridge soon afterwards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Monrad is a variation of Swiss format, but the Swiss system has rather specific rules for pairings|pg||
nt|othered1: Out here in rural Pennsylvania (the state with the largest rural population), Swiss is exotic enough and I hadn't heard of Danish until recently on BBO.   It's just Swiss with ...|pg||
nt|othered1: replays allowed (especially on the last round.)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another way of putting it, yes, but Monrad came first|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ie qualifier -- Results from a number of monrad rounds determine qualifier placement in the next phase, usually a cup format (either knockout or with consolation).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Danish is this context is not a pastry|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: it was the last deal of this round. We will continue in a few minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think the Americans use Danish for all of it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sometimes the final is progressive, meaning that losers will also "devance" to consolation.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operators need to reload and will shut down|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Americans mostly like k/o teams in Regionals, in Sectionals they like Swiss teams -- but in general both in the flyer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: zip k/o "loose and snooze" format another fun of Regionals:)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|janhamhurg: so the team pietraszek will be in 6 th place only- with still a good chance to finish in the top 8, while  mragowina is leading this event by a lot|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Why did he not just bid 5@C over 3 then?|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|tez: why ducked @s i dont understand|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  probably to drive the commentators crazy.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so how they call that convention 2 hearts- i have votes for tartan and muilderberg|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match it was. Thanks all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 2 more matches of 6 boards today|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that would be nice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or 3?|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: 2 more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, rounds 9 and 10|pg||
nt|h_karluk: our appreciation to sponsors, organizators, Roland Wald. Kibitzers proudly welcomed, keep track of VG schedule please, enjoy:)|pg||
