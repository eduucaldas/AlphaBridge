nt|hedyg: good hand for weak 2 suiter in N but usually in Poland that is 5 5...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda4.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt they can find the slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: NV they may skimp a little?|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: sorry, but we have some problems here|pg||
nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: wrong cards?|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: redeal to 19|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: we're closing, sorry|pg||
nt|hedyg: shame, this is a very interesting hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: try again :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Third time lucky I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Both pairs play Polish @C Marcin?|pg||
nt|baldjean: I was just about to post the same :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: obserwujemy mecz dwóch pierwszych druzyn w klasyfikacji - prowadzi Henclik przed Mr¹gowi¹|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am afraid EW might try 4@s here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have Polish commentary in the closed room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome back|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2 top team on 145 or so, but bottom is closely bunched; so we expect tough fight for QF spots|pg||
nt|andyv:  that was a quick 5 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, 5 mins only last 2 in Poland|pg||
mb|1D|nt|andyv:  multi by E|pg||
mb|d|an|may be weaker|nt|baldjean: this will be a 4@s|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi again|pg||
mb|1S|nt|janhamhurg: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda9.html|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  3@h should be p/c|pg||
mb|2D|nt|h_karluk: one of the best known Polish Junior pairs, Piotr Wiankowski & Michal Nowosadzki, who had also represented their country in Jesolo|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: 4@S could be very wrong but you've got to bid it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this indeed really tough table, both sides established partnerships|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: yes sir, agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Boguslaw PAZUR is a famous WIM in Poland, active in International field since 1994|pg||
nt|othered1: east's first pass looks normal, though some might double 2@H as takout of @S, wh ich prevents being boosted out of the auction if dummy is weak and opener superaccepts to 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jan Lammerich|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi, welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda9.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think this should stop the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the penultimate round of 6 boards today|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Irwin Boris|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: leading team meets third place|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Two strong pairs at this table|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi again|pg||
mb|3D|nt|baldjean: I doubt West will bid 5@c in this vulnerability situation|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Piotr Gawrys and Piotr Tuszynski are big boys|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi Irwin|pg||
mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda10.html|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club switch will doom it|pg||
nt|psridhar: thats a bold 3s but his last chance to get into the auction, 4s may be right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree, don't leave partner in 3@S with a fit and a singleton|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Jan|pg||
mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: a club switch will defeat this|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  10 tricks easy in @d... finding the 11th might have been difficult on a @d lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopteamrunda12.html  running scores|pg||
nt|psridhar: East's 1S slowed the auction down for NS-left to themselves NS might hv climbed to 4S, but cant blame E|pg||
nt|psridhar: i would read that X of 1S by South as " if my rho had passed i wd hv bid 2s pd" |pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: Marek is an old gun, since 1978 active|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: the latest version!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: 1@S I think|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  looks like N read it as @ss|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|othered1: and double of 2@H for takout of @S isn't all that dangerous, since it implies some @H length and partner can pass with a crumby hand and a few @H.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: since the 2 heart bid limits the hand to 10 points, west 3 hearts seem optimistic|pg||
nt|h_karluk: here is a Polish bridge joke : You know that an overcall of 3Sp over 1Sp means, partner, I have a solid minor, if you have a spade stopper, please bid 3NT. But do you know the ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Polish version of that convention?:) Partner, I have a spade stopper, if you have a solid minor, please bid 3NT. :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|baldjean: double was a bit keen, in my opinion, but it works|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think it matters actually|pg||
pc|h9|nt|h_karluk: just eleven tricks there for NS pairs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Shows 4 spades wheras 2@S would show 5, in case East has psyched|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|othered1: Double on this auction was far more dangerous.|pg||
nt|psridhar: i dare say the multi let North in- if the auction were to go 2h-3d-4h-? i doubt he will bid 4s|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|baldjean: interestingly the other table landed in 3@s only|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I agree with the final contrace and will use an inviting sequence as N instead of a direct 4@s|pg||
nt|baldjean: are there any problems, operator? or is West thinkin?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Declarer would have been unable to untangle the trump suit anyway|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|othered1: and could have been hammered for 500, a large pick-up "out of thin air."|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: many will wonder about that 2 club bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good treatment|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Shows 18+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C is ambiguous|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: and too many losers on S for 4@s|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h8|nt|h_karluk: wouldn't keep the carpet clean|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is just cleaner|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|dQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Never had a chance, really. May drift 2 off|pg||
pc|s3|nt|VugraphP1: west was thinkinh|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: Let it hold and a H switch for down 2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: worst fears confirmed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a baby psyche, particularly NV, and should not work|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that was popular here as well. but today they dont psych anymore:)|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: since most play a 2 cl opener as 12-16, a rebid shows 17-19|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Often 12-14 balanced but when he bids again after pass from partner, he has the strong version|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am surprised to see Tuszynski there without Jacek Pszcola, but maybe he is still in neigbor state North Carolina USA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *neighbor|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: not so sure, but probably right|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: cleaner is a nice word in this context andy|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sharkey: Are these cards ok Hedy?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pepsi plays with Jassem in this event|pg||

nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: i hope so!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this 4@s would work, maybe the matter how to reach there|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Lucky 4@H|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: yes, cards are ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@D puts pressure on S |pg||
nt|hedyg: double would work well here|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that does not describe the S hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't get it (CR result)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: slam NT for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5 IMPs but still significant in a 6-board match|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as far as i remember for 220|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: normally both minors 6-9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: gotcha, thanks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT = weak with both minors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't beat it|pg||
nt|andyv:  opening lead of Q@c allowed E to claim at trick one.|pg||
nt|psridhar: the 1s o/c isnt meek either !|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: That's what N wants to hear....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even with a wasted @SQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: pass or 3NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda6.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C is a fine contract, even 7 has play|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ok i hear: 2club opener shows 11-14, so the 2 cl rebid shows 15+|pg||
nt|andyv:  another 4@s contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|baldjean: nice slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: everyday slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he likes to attend regionals in Georgia, Atlanta, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Polish Club    1@C   1. 12-14 balanced - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. Any 18+|pg||
nt|irwinbo: many fearless folk would have opened 3 diamonds if system allowed|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 no is limited to 18, since no 1 cl opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Matches of 6 boards in the qualifying|pg||
nt|othered1: south has an interesting rebid.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: must find the queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i must admit i would pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: me too - South's hand likely to be unbalanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: in CR it was pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@S is on as it is, but they took the money|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2007BermudaBowlShanghai/bermuda-bowl/Poland/Gierulski-Skrzypczak.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Take the money, he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda4.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9@H just became huge|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classic 5/3 or 4/4 case|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk4: I have just been told that there will be a longer break than scheduled. Restart at 16.30 local time|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: next session starts 16.30|pg||
nt|baldjean: And settled for the 4/4.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's true|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Best lead for the defence, but declarer can prevail with spades 3-2 (ace on side) and hearts 3-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a great game, but makeable|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2D must be a trf to 2h -so that opener has another chance to bid|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so this is how to treat an invitational 6-3 hand- i like it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: is this gazilli?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It shows 18+ with at least 3 spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Game-forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 or 3 down this is, depending on club guess|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 300 here is a good result for east west|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: @CA, spade|pg||
nt|h_karluk: undo?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Pazur supposed to pass|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: knowing 4 spades make easily, 5 clubs might be a good idea, but it will dost a fortune here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the link is for NS pair|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: Bye to East's hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: West will be endplayed at some stage for minimum 9 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 2@c|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: cost|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 500 not really much of a compensation|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not my cup of tea sir, besides i am a married man, if i would open it 3@d i would be a dead meat :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 18-- wait -let me count...|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Add VAT|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: sry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would it not be 500?|pg||
nt|psridhar: gierulski must valued his 6 hcp outside spades for his overcall, he will find they hv no role to play in 4s X|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: No other line seems attractive|pg||
nt|othered1: But NS have handled this well.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think the club suit disappeared|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, it did in the 50's I suppose|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far yes|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now not even 5 level is safe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Going up all the time|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: no worries , its okay Marcin :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, declarer does not agree|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: bec of 2 potential dia loser|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Hearts very friendly for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could go for a zillion if clubs had been 3-1 and hearts less friendly|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: only -2 ?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|janhamhurg: and a possible spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh sorry, I thought South opened 1@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  only problem with 3N is finding tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D shows an extra heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  1@S  ;  2@D   is how I thought it went|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: because theire declarer play is perfect-lol:)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all :)|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: local time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has got to play a spade from dummy anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could have, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club to the king and a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he can't any more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think it well may be 1100|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there should be a good side to every situation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was an error not to cover the 8, but easier for us|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now the heart suit is dead, it is expensive|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but that's life, for every force, there is a counter force, for every negative there is a positive and for every action there is a reaction. In other words for every cause there is ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: an effect |pg||
nt|psridhar: the reason why S suggested 3nt with 6-3 in Maj is bcos he doesnt know yet about the 5 card spd with N ? |pg||
nt|andyv:  I can't imagine  S really wanted to play 3N.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: to bad- i liked the sequense so far, but passing 3 no with 2 small dia with a known spade fit is strange|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This contract has a major flaw  .... and a minor|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: and if not then E will be endplayed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Shirley|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess would draw @d 10|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Mich as well have done it at trick 2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting, didn't hook|pg||
pc|dK|nt|janhamhurg: so instead of nice 620  we will have - 200 or so|pg||
nt|andyv:  not only was the surgery not a success but the patient died too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are you sure 4M would always make?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sharkey: Rite :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and pitch a @s|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@H doesn't make... not sure if 4@s has a play or not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They don't have the hand records|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: he can disc a @c now and play small @H|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: sorry, i missed the play. E played  A @D out of the order, and had to discard it to spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhh wow!|pg||
nt|psridhar: identical auction in CR|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|h_karluk: oh done|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: *Might|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The defence did all the hard work for declarer|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Nastepna sesja  zaczyna sie o 16:30   for our Polish viewers|pg||
nt|sybarra: will N get the ruff? |pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: Another auction where a trump lead looks pretty normal, and weste answered the call . . . |pg||
nt|h_karluk: defenders see the table, if E hekld A likely would cash|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West hasn't shown much so far, has he?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|sK|nt|psridhar: cards do not lie well-but 4M plays a lot better than this hopeless 3nt slated to go down3|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *held|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he is bound to go wrong|pg||
pc|c4|nt|janhamhurg: i must say i dont like the 4 spade bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still  Gawrys, Krzysztof Jassem, Apolinary Kowalsky, Szymanowski, Piotr Tuszynski saga in Polish Bridge,|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Disappointing that clubs not were mentioned in either room|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i try to give a piece of advice: play in your 8 card major fit, if you know you have one:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: remember to start with a top @h :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I think 4@S will go down too|pg||
nt|psridhar: 17 imps in first 2 bds is a gr8 start for the leading team|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Winning the ace could be right if North had 12 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this certainly in the slam zone|pg||
mb|1C|nt|h_karluk: EW22, NS18 points|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I wonder when a puzzle deal, preferably a bloody one will occur :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: i guess they believe get paid to impact the bridge world, not be impacted by it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C   1. 12-14 balanced - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. Any 18+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-7|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be , cause of the 4-1 heart break, there will be a trump trick extra - so looses eventually 3 spades and a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not always recommended to underlead aces in suit contracts but this one worked well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is the easiest game now with @HA onside|pg||
mb|1N|nt|h_karluk: likely 3n FOR EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ouch, sorry for  caps lock, my bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not sure what he would do if he got a 2@S response. Maybe 2NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless 2@C is Puppet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Gawrys also partner of Lesniewski |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: a 2 heart bid shows 11 +, 2 spade minimum|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: pass now would show "touch"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if you would like to see convention cards of Polish pros check this please : |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C is the best part score, but as usual clubs are lost|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://bridgefiles.net/VAR2/Vugraph/Vugraph-Poland.htm|pg||
mb|2C!|an|pro|nt|Walddk2: Here we have it   2@D  any 18+|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Cheap penalty card - only 1 or 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing much has changed here. Cichocki would also have bid if Henclik had passed 1NT|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: well judged|pg||
mb|3C|an|14HCP, fit|nt|hedyg: 6@c...:(|pg||
nt|hedyg: okok i am ambitious!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C can actually be defeated, but it takes a double dummy defence|pg||
nt|andyv:  whatever the case, 4@s certainly would have been a superior contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: :) - @S9 and @S10 makes the difference...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c opening is usually reserved to show a limited hand with long clubs and possibly 4-card major, similar to Precision 2@copening|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: E said: 4441 without @D or 5440 w/o @D|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so the polish handgenerator serves us a lot of highly interesting games-|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I suspect 1@H shows spades and that 4@H is a splinter for spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: rt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's pretty common to play transfer responses after a take-out double|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: nearly lay down 6 spades|pg||

mb|3D|nt|jutek: prawdopodobnie po wiscie kierowym 11 lew|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well can ruff and pull @s A|pg||
mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: Slawek HENCLIK was partner of Boguslaw GIERULSKI between 97-99|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 6 NT as well|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so now he will make 5 easily|pg||
nt|psridhar: helps enormously in this deal for W to find the slam|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 club is 5 card 13 -14|pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: Hey Ed, good to see you|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 6NT seems to make too without the @H lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The two international teams, Svindahl (Norway) and De Botton (England/Norway) need to play very well in the last two rounds to qualify for the quarter-finals|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopteamrunda12.html|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sorry 3 club is showing 3 spades and maximum as i hear from mr von berg|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h=rkc?|pg||
mb|5S|an|trump inv|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|baldjean: 4@s is a bit too high|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NS did well to push EW one level higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They would have done even better if Wejknis had led a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@d response  relay, forcing to 3@c. Opener shows a 4-card suit (3@d shows extras) or makes a choice between 2NT and 3@c with long clubs.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but we see, now he would be able to pitch 2nd @d loser to established @h K|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if they find it i won't get surprised|pg||
nt|psridhar: Hamman's rule obeyed !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Over a 1@D response it is even stronger than that I think. 20+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: game-forcing I am told, 23 or more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: starting with 1 club can be an unlimited hand, i believe after 1 dia response 2 dia is gameforcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will produce the 9th trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  and give S time to set up @hs|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: or at least 4 after this dia play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I will be, cos they are not in 3@C|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 spades is a nice contract doomed by the 5-1 split|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean you know they are card sharks|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Which I think is mandatory on this auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I suppose he can make this if he did not get a heart back|pg||
nt|psridhar: with spds 3-3 , 12 tricks|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: since spades are 3-3 no problem anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That is very impressive by Skrz!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he can't because he must play a spade honour when overruffed|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: agree, heart was nessesary to prevent a low spade from table|pg||
nt|andyv:  they got there.... so 4@h just a cue|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that makes the rest cuebidding!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think Kickback is mainstream in Poland|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i like this 3 club bid! will take it into my convention list!|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess not judging from the spec responses:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Jan, you have to take the whole thing!|pg||

nt|psridhar: gierulski still in the tanl for the lead?|pg||

nt|psridhar: he does put in plenty of energy on opening leads !|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: he is still thinking|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i see 11 top tricks, and a small problem if a club is ducked|pg||

pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: We had that theme before|pg||

pc|h2|nt|othered1: Preferably the high one, but that isn't easy to find|pg||

nt|Walddk2: "Whenever the auction calls for a trump lead, lead one, regardless of holding, even from Kx or Qxx"|pg||
mb|1D|nt|othered1: Two boards in a row with 1-level contract in one room and game bid in the other.  Price EW paid for the lightish opening 2@C|pg||

nt|othered1: Pretty much "Have a reason not to lead a trump."  And then double-check it.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 3NT was without arms and legs|pg||

nt|h_karluk:  (Balanced hands in this range with five clubs, i.e. 2335, 3235 and 3325, are opened 1C.)|pg||

pc|h6|nt|h_karluk: cool defense|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: Here, too, declarer likely will take his 9 tricks, but running @D may make play for an overtrick possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has the 10, or the 8 is a singleton|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|h_karluk: 1 NT 1517 HCP, 2@s response  transfer for clubs. Opener may choose between a positive 2NT, and a negative 3@c. Responder may continue by showing shortage.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mahy shoot the moon now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he did not lead @C8 with his left hand, so it's not a singleton|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *may|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you all play that convention?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The 2C opening generally promises fewer than four diamonds, but with a concentrated xx46 or xx47 2C will often be a better tactical call.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d3|pc|h8|nt|sharkey: 3@C may just have pushed EW one too high|pg||

nt|psridhar: rich getting richer|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 5-6 is a significant swing in a 6-board match, 9 is huge|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: South is a favourite to have @SA, and you just improve your chances by leading low from dummy|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That caters to stiff ace with South|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk:  Opener always rebids 2H with two or more hearts, otherwise he prefers 2S with four spades, otherwise 2NT or 3C, |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 imps to east west, playing the better contract only 1 off|pg||
pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: claims|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: N is thinking...|pg||
nt|psridhar: N will be surely disappointed at that 3 imp loss after finding the brilliant lead|pg||

nt|h_karluk: the alternative to trying to grab your tricks at once is to sit back and let the declarer to do his own work. This policy may be indicated (a) when you've no attactive attacking ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lead and (b)) when it appears likely from the bidding that the contract will be a close affair|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @dA favorably placed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But with @DA onside it does not matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: slam zone|pg||
mb|2C!|an|weaker, show your suit|nt|Walddk2: Less experienced players will almost always miss that inference|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: with the weak dia(0-7)|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D|nt|sharkey: Phantom save as 4@H won't make....|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone know what EW are playing?  They do open 2@C with long @C and a minumum (b6y their standards) opening.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: only @h a lead good|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 no about 22-23 i thk, or something special|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match and our broadcast from Poland today|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So you can't open 2@H to show both majors, but you can open 2@H to show hearts and a minor?|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i thk thats the way to treat a 6-4 hand- rebid your major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crazy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are they trying to kill bridge?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I thought it unlikely there would be ace of @H lead but oh well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: and lead low to the jack|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: the 2 dia is part of multilandy|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ugly for east west now|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 1@S m ight be an Animal Blue Team opening.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting point abt their sys : 1N> 2Transfer to hearts (2@d) does not deny five spades. Responders new suit at the 3-level forces to game. Also: 1NT - 2@d; 2@h - 2@s forces to ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@h (8+ HCP)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 cl- both maj|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2dia- 1maj|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Marcin, our excellent operator in Sopot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to all our commentators throughout the day|pg||
nt|irwinbo: one try for slam?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a pleasure as always|pg||
nt|andyv:  apparently they recently voted on that... not sure what the reasoning for it as it's a mid-chart convention.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|janhamhurg: 5  cl would be a wonderfull hit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: If @D were 3-1 this would make so EW unlucky here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jean|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: interesting lead; I would not have done that|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2hearts-h+min|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am pretty sure the best way to improve is just hire a pro and study the lessons|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 1@h/1@s openings in general 5 cards, 1217 HCP, 1NT response NF|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told 1@S showed: 10-14 unbalanced with 4+ @S or 10-11 5332|pg||
nt|othered1: And majors are opened in preference to a longer minor.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be a style, ie different approaches depends vulnerability|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm also told that west is a system inventor and that this is his new system.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: each year Bogo is on VG|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d not at all bad for EW|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|janhamhurg: 2 dia just ok as 2 spade is for n s|pg||
nt|psridhar: that X of 1s steered NS from their normal 1n into a 7 card fit 2s|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2s also shd make|pg||
nt|psridhar: spd 3-3|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: since spades 3-3 -  no problem, i think even better|pg||
pc|dA|nt|baldjean: Hello all.|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Jean|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks to go -1 now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 30 is the last board of the match and session. Restart at 16:30 local time, in 2½ hours|pg||
nt|baldjean: @c switch necessary now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: redouble = bid your major|pg||
nt|h_karluk: In Polish club, 1@c opening bid is forcing for one round but it does not necessarily show a strong hand, in most versions of this system it shows either a weak balanced hand (about ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 12-14HCP), natural 1@c opening or any strong hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On behalf of BBO, Slawek Latala has been instrumental in setting up a fine show. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|irwinbo: again well done and right sided|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play resumes tomorrow at 10:00 local time|pg||
pc|d4|nt|baldjean: well done|pg||
nt|sybarra: does the j promise the q? |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda5.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|baldjean: I'm sure it does with them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If spades are 3-2, you can't go down. Rise with the ace and pull trumps. Then @HA and 10|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: easy defence-for us! cash 3 cl and play a spade-  -2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@d response has three meanings : |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 12 or 13 depends on the lead- 13 now|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 more rounds of Swiss before the top 8 advance to the quarter-finals|pg||
nt|andyv:  should make 3@s|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: pass would show diamonds if they double a Multi, bid = own suit|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: the 4 is positive|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seemed count to me|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda10.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1. 1.negative: 08 HCP. In the 78 HCP range, Responder should not have a 4-card major (the response of one of a major is 7+HCP, the 1NT response is 911 HCP).|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to all spectators for watching|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 5 spade the queen ask i thk|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5S=we hv all keys, do u hv the trump queen?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|janhamhurg: count would be the 5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: tho i play A att K count|pg||
pc|d2|nt|baldjean: unfortunate split for declarer in this one|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is going to get real messy (Potentially) |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2.911 unbalanced; either both minors (5-4), or one poor minor. (The hand does not qualify for any of the responses: 1NT, 2 in a minor, 3 in a minor).|pg||
pc|d9|nt|othered1: In any case, 2@C wouldn't be my choice of contracts.  But Ew areNV so it won't be disasterous.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no offense intended, in USA std nick for such nice players is "mad scientist" :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now the 9|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 5 no- sorry no queen|pg||
nt|andyv:  good spot even though 7 makes|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: with open cards - easy- i think he will setlle for 110|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|sybarra: like -2 now? |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3/5 here (throughout)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: The @H10 is a very good card|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7@H is against the odds, roughly 53&|pg||

pc|c8|nt|sharkey: indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also fine|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: *play|pg||
nt|psridhar: if u do gamble a grand the absence of trump lead can cause u to finesse-depends on how u rate the calibre of the opg leader|pg||

nt|andyv:  last board of this set.  Thank you everyone for joining us|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Thanks to Marcin Golinski, our wonderful operator.  Great job! |pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|baldjean: slam possible here, but I doubt they will reach it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am unsure abt this overcall|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean i would rather feel myself well to pass it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but that's me he's Michal :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 1 dia shows 5 dia(or good 4) remember they are juniors|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: A 6@D that never will be bid...|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N and 4@H are good spots, but west has to put the brakes on.  @SA position, howeer, will let them play at the 5-level|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ultra light overcall at 2nd seat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do they play Dwururka?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes , Pazur's sys|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess so|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i respect, for sure they are experienced and have ideas|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: west might try for a slam|pg||
nt|psridhar: the descriptive value ( describes 10 cards ! )  sways in favor of 2h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can understand that you bar a 2-opening where no suit is known (Wilkosz 2@D), but as soon as one is known I can't see the problem. If you know *both* suits (like both majors), ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the problem is non-existent|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: I think Pazur's sys named as Dwururka, after Winning Polish open trial for 08 EC might update|pg||
mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: x+ 1no= stronger than direct 1 no- so 19-20|pg||
nt|andyv:  worse than that|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: exiting bridge in Poland all week here, i like it a lot!|pg||
nt|andyv:  same auction at other table except E raised to game|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now it looks like a drama|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3s will result in embarassing overtrick/s|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: this 2 no is an underbid i thk|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or the pass|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1: dEclarer on last hand pitched the wrong suit -- @D on @HK, @H ruff, then @S ruff with dummy's last trump would have worked|pg||
nt|andyv:  opening hand opp. opening hand with 9 card fit belong in game... no exceptions|pg||
pc|h5|nt|baldjean: or 6@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: Also  we thank Slwaek Lataia,  the organizer of this tourney.  Much appreciated by all BBO vugraph fans! |pg||
nt|othered1: How do you play 4N?  If control asking, why not immediately?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but i am afraid he changes it too much |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a new system I am told|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 cl is key card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure anyone in the ACBL can convince me|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 dia  1|pg||
nt|andyv:  does W have enough opp a typical 2@h opener to continue?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: thx spec,  love the insight and comments |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in 07 1@H was = 4+C, 11+, various shapes, no 4M unless 17+ with 5+C :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sybarra: back in about 2 1/2 hours |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The system is named Nail|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's true, seems latest update there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wow, cool name|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pazur is a system freak|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@h 5 cm 12-17|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: W: 18-20|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: thats a very lucky game with 24 points only, well done in closed room, so the gap will widen up|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sth funny here!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: agreed, in USA we call such nice personalities as mad scientist :)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: one of the Pazur's sys card here : http://www.archiviobridge.it/Pazur-Zawislak.pdf|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: 3@c instead of 2nt resulted in 3nt on W and a @h lead from N - and down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure why Gierulski chose his weaker minor|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Exactly. Then 2@S was waste of time|pg||
nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as passed hand i prefer 11 points for any action <including take out double>|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: if 4 cl is BW 4 dia is the wrong answer, if 4 cl ask for cue bid, 4 dia is  a conrol|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe tried to leave space for partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe hoping that partner had more there than in diamonds|pg||
nt|psridhar: if we know what wd 3c/3d/3h by opener over 2nt mean , then we can judge better as to how auction shd hv gone|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  3@h looks like minimum hand with no shortness|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, 3@s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: Indeed, half an hour later than scheduled on our vugraph page|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sharkey: Not sure 6@S makes...|pg||
nt|othered1: Lots and lots of cue-bids, but this isn't a very elegant contract.  Wonder if either North or South thought partner had a first round control, particularly the second @H bid by ...|pg||
nt|othered1: north (if 4@C was natural)|pg||
nt|ritong: for south, sounded like north had @h void, i guess|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Interesting system, 1@C = I don't have hearts     1@S response = I don't have spades :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and thanks all, esp Marcin, i know long day there for you :) another nice biz|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|Walddk4: Nastepna sesja  zaczyna sie o 16:30   for our Polish viewers|pg||

nt|Walddk2: So it can't be ace asking|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: exactly 2 keycards|pg||
nt|psridhar: he can draw trumps now|pg||
nt|psridhar: making 11|pg||
nt|andyv:  i have a feeling 4@d must have shown that... otherwise is there reason for W to stop?|pg||

nt|h_karluk: the big picture appeared 90 %|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then it's a little pessimistic by West to just sign off|pg||
nt|andyv:  then why didn't W bid 4@s?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: Thanks all and bye for now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: We will shut down and return shortly after they have made the pairings for the next round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's Swiss format now, 1st against 2nd, 3rd vs 4th, and so on|pg||
nt|othered1: are replays allowed?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Teams can't meet any other team twice in Swiss|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They can if the format is Danish (Monrad)|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  A Monrad format pairs winners vs. winners and losers vs. losers. The better known name "Swiss" system  |pg||
nt|baldjean: That's like the difference between Swiss and Danish cheese.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: J.H. Monrad, a Danish engineer, devised the movement in 1928, but for the Chess Olympics|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It was adopted by bridge soon afterwards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Monrad is a variation of Swiss format, but the Swiss system has rather specific rules for pairings|pg||
nt|othered1: Out here in rural Pennsylvania (the state with the largest rural population), Swiss is exotic enough and I hadn't heard of Danish until recently on BBO.   It's just Swiss with ...|pg||
nt|othered1: replays allowed (especially on the last round.)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another way of putting it, yes, but Monrad came first|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ie qualifier -- Results from a number of monrad rounds determine qualifier placement in the next phase, usually a cup format (either knockout or with consolation).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Danish is this context is not a pastry|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: it was the last deal of this round. We will continue in a few minutes|pg||
