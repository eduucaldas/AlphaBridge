mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: east west have 2 adventages . they have the major major and the cards lie well for them|pg||

nt|buffytvs: especially if Ross takes a bid here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|buffytvs: presumably that's a txfr|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure it is|pg||
nt|guppy: well - 3N is even better than than 5m and Piotr found the winning initial action (1N vs. X) to steer them there|pg||
nt|lml: 5@H is a decent save or 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 5@D|pg||
nt|lml: either|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tough call for East now|pg||
nt|lml: With those trump I bet he bids on|pg||
nt|lml: if partner has diamonds it looks like he only has 2.5 losers|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a full 18 with a diamond fit, but does he want to commit to 11 tricks?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lml: well that will be a steal then|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thgouht he might dbl|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: I think he should bid|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lml: if partner has nothing else he has good diamonds|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|buffytvs: avoiding the Elvis Coup in diamonds, which as it happens, doesn't cost|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he didnt think clubs was a transfer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he had even better clubs|pg||
nt|lml: otherwise that is sort of a strange lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: what would you have led from his hand?|pg||
nt|lml: the elvis coup|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: keith is looking for some high cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: me too|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|buffytvs: there's a 10 :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lml: fortunately he doesnt need to get to dummy|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c7|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lml: 2@H over 1NT doesnt have to show much but Taylor's hand was less than not much|pg||

nt|bridge_one: so may be a swing for E/W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if in open room the contract will be 4@S DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Ostergaardv tells he nearly lead ac - but still it was only nearly :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: sry some tech pb|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well i think east'shand may qualify for an opener even by my standards|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now e/w need a certain convention called blackwood to avois another plausible slam|pg||
nt|haans: you very rarely can lead nearly|pg||
nt|shevek: guess it was ok both previous hands to open 10 hcp unbalanced|pg||
nt|shevek: as long as pd knows (part of the sys)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i thought tyne one spade opener was a little unbalanced in a different sense|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: I have a screen here and cant see NE biddin before both bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|roswolf: indeed carl|pg||
nt|haans: long way to slamn here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: here 4@H down because the ruff in @d is obliged to find|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: well the heart interfernce will give the auction momentum|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|haans: but no spade support = down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now can be 2 down because for North it easy the lead with A@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like an easy 3N|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: previous hand I think the line Geoff pointed out previous hand is the most pragmatic - if not the best. Attempt ruff out @CQ - then try @S finesse |pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: 4@C IS STANDOUT - how can west pass - momma mia|pg||
nt|shevek: it's ok Peter, you're doing a wonderful job :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: and did Clemmensen have full control of the bidding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A@D 3@D to the return @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: after umpteen roujnds of bidding of course|pg||
nt|shevek: as operator you are supposed to wait for both screenmates to bid|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Or raise to 4@S Vul - cant afford to miss this kond of games|pg||
nt|haans: Hansen may have seen p bid before|pg||
nt|sharkey: *kind|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|shevek: because they can hear the keyboard, and can tell who's taking time|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: this hand is a sample about a big rule: never give informations at opps :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|shevek: please don't ask :)|pg||
nt|haans: EW are doing the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: did 3@S really show good hand?|pg||
nt|haans: not easy to play low clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: He didnt have to bid over 3@H?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|shevek: ok, now we understand the auction|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bridge_one: only bec IMP,,,|pg||
nt|haans: In my book Sörensen had a balanced hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: @CA and down|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||

nt|lml: that reaffirms my view that Piotrk may have thought it was clubs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|buffytvs: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Piotr|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: I can see no reason for any penalty... they got it all..|pg||
nt|guppy: his choice of opening lead (@cA) also strongly suggested same|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes we discussed that a while ago|pg||
nt|lml: but welcome :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|lml: I guess 2NT shows a heart raise of some sort|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lml: thanks !|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: the C!A is a disappointment to declarer -- it's a trick, but he'd far rather have the @DK for example|pg||
nt|buffytvs: @CA|pg||
nt|lml: true but there is enough to work with in dummy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: oh yes|pg||
nt|lml: this may take a while though|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|buffytvs: he could play this as a dummy reversal|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|lml: I think he will just set up diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: probably about now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: seems simplest|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|lml: definitely about now!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he might well guess the diamond position seeing the 9 fall|pg||
nt|lml: I am certain he will guess the position but I am usually wrong|pg||
nt|lml: he knows the spade honors are likely split and Piotr has 0-6 so there isnt much room for diamond honors|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- good point about the spades|pg||

nt|lml: I claim!|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|buffytvs: ruff the diamond high, return with a trump, give up the last two spades|pg||

nt|roswolf: nowhere close to bidding the thin game|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3NT is at 50%|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: original bidding |pg||

pc|d6|nt|sharkey: was @SQ a wise move?|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd 1 was flat in 3nt -2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bridge_one: so 2@S was more ortodoxe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: giving the chance to bid a interesting hand at East|pg||

mb|1N|nt|lml: Piotr has a nice hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: you know how I feel about aces|pg||
nt|buffytvs: going to behard to avoid 3NT, but not sure you can get to 9 tricks|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|lml: yeah I think they can make 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but the spades are friendly, as long as you don't play Restricted Choice|pg||
nt|lml: as long as they guess spades|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|lml: the key is to cash the ace first|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you don[t guess spades, you may be struggling|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: now will these two 4-3-3-3 hands avoid the spade fit|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|buffytvs: he's oging to get a diamond lead, and will take the inference that North is likely to have longer spades, and play a spade to the king (I think)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|buffytvs: then he may well go wrong|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lml: guess you cant|pg||
nt|buffytvs: neitehr deterred by the 4333 shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: he is going to need some help from his friends|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but 10 tricks in spades are even more difficult than 9 in NT on this deal|pg||
nt|lml: well the heart lead didnt hurt him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- Keith avoided the club lead|pg||
nt|lml: if he guesses spades there might be some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|buffytvs: which would blow a trick|pg||
nt|lml: so how can you make it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: strip hearts, draw trumps, and play a diamond, hoping North ducks?|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|buffytvs: then he has to give a ruff-sluff or play clubs, which would be enough|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|buffytvs: I think Keith is too good a player to be caught that way though|pg||
nt|lml: well he is doing the strip hearts part|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: that always shows the Q|pg||
nt|lml: I learned that a long time ago from Mary Paul|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes i think he'll figure out the spade position|pg||
nt|lml: nobody would lead the jack in that situation unless they had the queen|pg||
nt|lml: it is an oldie|pg||

nt|roswolf: what is double!?|pg||
nt|sharkey: penalty....:(|pg||
nt|sharkey: ?|pg||

mb|4H|nt|haans: if you have good spade support :)|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: once again they are starting 8 boards apart.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I'm starting to think the CBF only has one set of boards...|pg||
mb|d|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: redbl is alerted, but i cant see what it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: support, less than limit raise...|pg||
nt|guppy: presumably Nick's passed hand XX = a raise in @s's with one of the top two honours...now the question is how many @c's will Balcombe pull out of the bidding box...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: balcombe bid quick...the delay was the scribbling of the description of the redbl...|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzjq: more scribbling by taylor...it looks like he is writing out their entire system regarding this bid...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: 4c showed 6+ clubs and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|buffytvs: maybe someone can suggest that tomorrow they do it the usual way so we can get comparisons much faster|pg||
mb|4S|nt|guppy: hmmmm....I wonder if they were on the same wavelength on this one?  Did Balcombe also alert? |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: i think they have different meanings for the 4c bid|pg||
nt|guppy: It's a rather common treatment when the opponents are silent, but quite another thing in a competitive auction...|pg||
nt|lml: so every hand in 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: well 2 out of 2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: never have to say you're sorry,. right?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: taylor now saying that 4c is huge hand without 4 heaRTS...4C was 100% forcing|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|guppy: Taylor bravely takes an action predicated on the possibility that he MIGHT have erred in his interpretation of 4@c |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lml: cool lead|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: judy might lead a heart back...the dbl may have been lightner'|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: ish|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: plus the 9s at trick one may be pionting to hearts|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|lml: does he have to say he is sorry now|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: or not|pg||
pc|h8|nt|guppy: Not much too the play on this one....NS got past the last safe landing spot of 4@c thru a bidding misunderstanding....the nuances of when agreements are on or off in competition ...|pg||
nt|guppy: are tough to all cover even for a well-practiced partnership|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: on slow trumps play 4M not 3NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|dannymiles: Agree Nic. Side aces, kings and doubletons call for suit play|pg||
mb|p|nt|czyzyk: actually 11imps|pg||
pc|hA|nt|caitlin: Mike Yuen...........|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C would have been easy (this time)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|flash: good start...|pg||
nt|caitlin: hold on.....|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@c precision-style, but after 3@c (not inviting) the S hand is very good - he could bid 3@h over the X|pg||
nt|shevek: last board coming up|pg||
nt|shevek: thanks to my excellent fellow commentators Peter and Haans|pg||
nt|shevek: thanks to our capable operator Peter Skafte, good work|pg||

nt|lml: I told you yesterday I am going to hire Gord to lead for me|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yesterday it was Piotr finding all the double dummy leads|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well you can have Piotr and I will take Gord|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: fair enough|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|buffytvs: anyone outside Canada will probably not have heard of the EW pair, but these guys are seriously good players|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lml: once I went through a lot of world championship books to look at what won and lost the most imps ... and it was opening leads|pg||
mb|4H|nt|buffytvs: they were on the team that won the IOC Grand Prix in 2000, and also the Commonwealth Games title|pg||
nt|lml: okay we are going to send some of those Yanks some of these boards!|pg||
mb|5D|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: gartaganis play a strong c...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: not surprised West passed 2nt|pg||
mb|d|nt|buffytvs: West is not 'SDoubler' but Gord Campbell, by the way|pg||
nt|lml: playing under alias|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: no his bbo name|pg||
nt|lml: ah|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: like Fred Lerner -- idblu|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: on the ladies side I want one for Izzy and Sondra Blank.  They are very aggressive penalty doublers|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this is makeable, without cheating what is the line?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|buffytvs: sorry, IOC was 2002 -- not wearing my Salt Lake shirt right now|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|lml: the double nickname|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes, but they double partscores that make -- you can have them on your team|pg||
nt|lml: idblu ... doubler... and how about gotcha|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lml: no they get lots of numbers from nowhere|pg||
nt|buffytvs: meanwhile, back at the table... looks like a routine 4@H|pg||
nt|lml: the lead is helpful|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|guppy: Playing their strong 1@c methods, Judy's choice of opening bid essentially valued her solitary @d as an x rather than a K.  Some players wouldn't hesitate to have opened 1N (15-17) ...|pg||
nt|guppy: with her hand as a least of bad alternatives - which would have led to 3N declared from her side - possibly making on a normalish @s x opening lead|pg||
