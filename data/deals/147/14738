nt|vugraphzpj: only 4 minutes break|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to all of the commentators.  We appreciate your time, insights and humor.    |pg||
nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the Danish Bridge Federation (Torsten Orhoj) for binging this tourney to BBO.  We have enjoyed being here. |pg||

nt|robbg: We do, and I appreciate being corrected. Just realize that when you are correcting me, so are about 500 of your colleagues and we can't respond to each.|pg||
nt|sybarra: but for example, I asked the "blonde questions" on the sequence after the opening nt,  I personally appreciated all the answers from you guys|pg||
