mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|othered1: At matchpoints, if 1N by passed hand wasn't forcing, there's an excellent case for passing 2@D (safest partial).|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Do you all pass on W after 2@d? 2@d is for me one round forcing, so 3@d for me on W|pg||
nt|caitlin: At one table I saw W raise to 3@D and E bid 3N.....I don't condone it but works|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|othered1: As implied above, I'd bid 2@S.  But my 1N never has 3-card @S support unless it's 10+ points.|pg||

nt|caitlin: However, this is partnership agreement|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it is. I will not jump to 3@d on a hand like easts|pg||

mb|2C|nt|othered1: another Precision 1@D?  I think 3N will be where they wind up, regardless, but if thwy try for slam, they better stop at 5@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|othered1: I guess it's 2@C in their style.  Not sure that would be choice of all Precision experts|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|othered1: 2@S after the 2@D inquiry is game forcing inmost styles.)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|othered1: 2N?|pg||

nt|othered1: But now, can south stop in NT?  does hye want to?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: agree Ed! Somtimes system distroy the best contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Can north possibly think about bidding again in a relay-style auction?  |pg||
