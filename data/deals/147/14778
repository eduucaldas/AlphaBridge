nt|Walddk2: One team conceded after the first 16|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Off we are with an interesting deal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not often you are dealt such a nice 6-6 hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: deal 1 and W has an 8 card suit -good start !|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 heart makes, 4 spade down 1 on a ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Final, 4 segments of 12 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|othered1: Hi, everyone from overcast central Pennsylvania,  USA|pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: Do we know what the running score is here?|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c p 1@s 4@h p p dbl p 4@s all pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Partner has enough for slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8221 is 0.19%|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Oh, our operator forgot to carry forward|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes one sec|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If @CA had been @HA a grand slam even|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Always difficult to bid a slam when the opponents open|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H is a two-suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Unia  40-23|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If the players were hoping for a nice and quiet start, they now need to rethink. This is explosive|pg||
nt|psridhar: and all those low % hands coming to west alone -what wd be odds ?|pg||
nt|tez: down 1 if they find @d ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good aftenoon all.|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome back|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: 2@H Michaels    2@S  sound raise in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H   Good cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They all seem to have wonderful cards on this auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What about a save in 7@H? Profitable yes but I doubt they will take it IF they bid slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1100 on best defence, but 800 more likely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Short and not so sweet in the closed room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We were told yesterday that the ACBL has barred a 2-level opening that shows both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't see the wisdom I must confess|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: Interesting actions EW, since south's 3@H implies some @S length, I think -- assuming 2@D is multi.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Semi-finals, 3 segments of 12 boards. One tonight, two tomorrow|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: how would you defend 4 spades seing the west hand?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Mike Graham|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good evening all.|pg||
nt|othered1: Rehi, everyone|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS Polish Club with a veritable host of gadgets|pg||
nt|psridhar: i dont understd the auction-how did S find 4S on his own on a 5 bagger?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can open 2@H to show hearts and a minor, but not 2@H to show hearts and spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Makes absolutely no sense to me|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: N-S have a 3.1 IMP carryover, but our software can't accept fractions so we made it 4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At this level it's guessing really. No-one knows who can make what|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: OK, a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As East I would pause for 1 minute, then follow with the 9|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: udca they play- so the 8 will come|pg||
nt|Walddk2: to show I don't have a singleton and want a diamond|pg||
nt|tez: if pikus has 2 card in @h he cant bid 4@s bye self|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't you all play that convention?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i thk they play 1 cl 1 sp 4x pass as forcing|pg||
nt|psridhar: lol|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: We can't have a tie, that's the issue|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Mike Amos|pg||
nt|mamos:  Hello|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Was a challenging deal first up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It worked|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TGhe other semi-final is between Svindahl and Goraco|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|mamos:  East in an uncomfortable spot here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry, other semi-final between Svindahl and Consus|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Goraco playing here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Both pairs are at this table are known at the international stage. N-S won the Vanderbilt 2008, E-W have strong results as juniors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And South's name earns you 2 million points in Scrabble, just not in Poland where you get 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to PS and Tez|pg||

pc|dT|pg||
nt|othered1: Unia has started this second half with a 17 imp lead, that won't be reflected in the running score here.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: classically South's 3@H would imply that he can stand a contract of 3@s or 4@H  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, 3@H|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: so could be based only only three spades |pg||
nt|tez: all lines down 1|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|psridhar: I thought Svindahl was an outside team , but all Poland players here|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: one down - next|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: real score is 44.1-23, some carryover included - we can ignore the .1 for a bit (unless it ends in a tie)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The team captain Frank Svindahl is from Norway|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: so- did you all find the obvious dia ?:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes ably guided by boss|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Must be disappointing for Wiankowski to have been dealt only 6-5 now|pg||
nt|tez: sure we are comandating with open cards|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: BA crew demanding pay rise, you too Mike and Ed?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Anything goes in 3rd at favourable|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos:  here|pg||
nt|mamos:  no games here|pg||
nt|tez: 1@h 1nt shows long minor and 4 card @s in polish style|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hands up everyone who would respond 1@s at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I remember the last BBO pay rise - it was identical to the previous one  |pg||
nt|othered1: No, we raise rates only once/yr.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But another slam is on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7 is on a heart finesse|pg||
nt|psridhar: normally polish 1D opg shows 5+ dia and unbal hand ..but 3rd seat here and fav vul|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|othered1: me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just as well they set hearts, then they will know they are off 1 keycard and will not bid a grand slam|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s inv+ @d supp|pg||
nt|tomi2: thats not right|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D is either 5+@D but maybe bal 12-14 OR 4+ unbal|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to P Sridhar (PS)|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all Ty Roland|pg||
nt|psridhar: looks like an explosive start :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: with 10 hcp S had no bid - i wd hv bid 1nt to express my values |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: very moderat 2 spades here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Assuming a standard opening.  Opposite a limited opening, responding is a matter of partership philosophy|pg||
nt|mamos:  EW playing some limited 1@h|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt|pg||
nt|tez: coming|pg||
nt|psridhar: and a quick pass from W|pg||
nt|tomi2: so this is the normal systematic opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 3@h asks @h stoper for 3 nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H by North is presumably showing a solid suit and asking for a heart stop - which South does not have |pg||
nt|psridhar: i prefer 3c fit jump with E hand over 1s-descriptive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I thought you open 1@C with a 12-14 balanced hand|pg||
nt|tomi2: if she had one card in major less and one club more she would open 1@C|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psridhar: as Roland wd put it :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, passing quickly means that I don't have what I promised and that partner should not double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Vary good convention too|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: effective :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes thats the popular treatment of polish 1c-most of the time weak nt opg|pg||
nt|tomi2: not if you have 5@d, @H or @S, then you open your suit and rebid 1NT to show 122-14 bal with 5 of this suit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|janhamhurg: since i am watching this i havent seen a lot of unethical things, poles dont have the best fame, but it has improved i thk|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: I am not familiar with the 6@C response. Are you, PS?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes but what about 4342 for example?|pg||
nt|tomi2: to open 1@C on 5@D seems to be some Swedish sytlye|pg||
nt|tomi2: that is 1@C|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, so 1@D is often 5+|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tez: 4@s is 2 down..with normal defence.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psridhar: over 4nt, normally jump to 6c shows odd no of keys + useful void, here i dont know what it meant|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5nt to show even no of keys + useful void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To me that is an odd number of keycards and a useful void (5NT even number)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos:  looks like quite a big pick up for NS|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice tool to have available (and fairly standard) and it certainly showed well here.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and they did respond 1@S at the othe table, and North bid 3@H too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe not the most exciting contracts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They get extras for commentating on difficult slams|pg||
nt|othered1: no, but east will make plenty of tricks.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Flat 8, against the odds to move with the West cards|pg||
nt|othered1: Might EW find game in the other room?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And the lead was also quite helpful|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree with not acting on west's hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They did not, West also passed in the CR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much point pressing non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|psridhar: we were only joking -not insinuating at all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Come on, it should be pretty easy to spot that I was kidding|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ok for me!:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I'll remember :)  :)  :)  :)  next time|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: there were times when we werent kidding------:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: Pikus doesnt know h jack is falling doubleton so will hv an ancient moment or two|pg||
nt|psridhar: sry anxious |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|janhamhurg: but 4 hearts is off- so they will win a lot here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|psridhar: S wd like to play h twice towards tbl...but only one entry|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it's all a matter of agreement|pg||
pc|h7|nt|janhamhurg: so will he play a finess or try to drop the ace doubleton|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room N-S sold out to 2@S|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Only 4 with a 4441 pattern|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, 4441 1444 xx45 are the cases when you often have only 4 cards|pg||
nt|psridhar: in any case 3d is a par contract here|pg||
nt|psridhar: shd make|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4144 some prefere to open 1@C and rebid 1@S after partners 1@H bid, dont know what is standard there, I open the better suit in that case|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: but then it seems that a certain amount of confusion arose, as they tried 3NT with no heart stopper - after a double, too |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|janhamhurg: now the moment of truth|pg||
nt|psridhar: unless S finds a way to show values over his pd's 1h, selling out to 2s is likely|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d7|nt|mamos:  yes good bidding here   game explored and rejected wisely|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Katich out, lbw|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tez: danger line..if they play 1 more @c|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: great!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 20-1|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d2|pc|h8|pg||

nt|tez: :)|pg||
mc|9|nt|tomi2: but you always can raise 1@D with 3 card support if you have no other bid available, because you have either a fit or pd is unbal, so 4-3 may play well|pg||

nt|tez: 2nt my choise nonevuln|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk he will make it , finessing dia 2nd round after jack falls on his left|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think 2nt-3nt does not depend on your actual hand. It depends more on parters style of opening bids, his declarer skills and your opps defending skills|pg||
nt|tomi2: say if you partner opens every 11 bal count non vuln you cant push to game with this hand but if he sometimes passes bad 12, you can do|pg||
nt|psridhar: for starters it is tempting to hope the lead is from qj|pg||
nt|tez: he afraids @s shift|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Making on the nose|pg||
nt|psridhar: a club ruff may hv beaten it -dia lead wont do any harm|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3s is a mild overbid, he has a nice min..but that stiff dia worries me|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 6 is down- so will they stopp?|pg||

nt|tez: 1@s overcall worked|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|psridhar: and S had no clue which minor will fetch|pg||
nt|tez: and singleton @d is not so nice|pg||
nt|psridhar: thats why that 3s was an overbid, since it commits him tocross 4h over 4d|pg||

nt|VugraphP1: TD summoned...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Certainly, East has been damaged by the missing alert|pg||

nt|tomi2: would somebody open N's cards differently than Gierulski?|pg||

mb|3H!|nt|Walddk2: This is not particularly breathtaking either. Just as well, Mike can confirm that it's incredibly hot in London atm|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: lots of modern players will overcall at 1-level with a long suit, strength irrelevant.|pg||
nt|psridhar: at times the TD consults experts also b4 ruling|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Back to normal, 6-6 for West :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7420 = 0.36%|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: unlucky game, but makes on a spade|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: Worked on the previous hand, too.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's a bidders game these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that's not wrong, Roland|pg||
nt|dimi: E-W can play some in majors, NS can play some in minor - no game available|pg||
nt|Walddk2: (Look at 13 and 14)|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4s shd make even losing 3 trump tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: West might have raised to 3@C there, with those majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but now NS have found their heart fit|pg||
nt|tez: 3@h for me|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: four-card trump support not to be sneezed at|pg||
nt|tez: 3@h good 2@s opening|pg||
nt|tomi2: can S now imagine an At9x sidefit and a void? I think 6@C is a decent spot|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psridhar: nice natural auction i like it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Something is wrong with that dealing programme it seems|pg||
nt|psridhar: S doesnt know abt the h void opposite -hence thinks his h is not a weak spot in 3nt|pg||
nt|tomi2: K&R (KJ9832 --- Txx AT9x) = 12.35   Kapland/Rubens treats this as an opening bid. opening 1@S will work out well verytime partner will not bid 2@H|pg||
nt|psridhar: now a spade guess shd see him thru|pg||
pc|c9|nt|psridhar: but dia break is bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a mighty good lead and should doom the contract|pg||
nt|tez: this is real 3@h opening..lesson hand:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: if West does raise to 3@C, Norht is kinda stuck|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer can't get to dummy in time|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes 2 minor tricks will be lost in addn|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|tomi2: leading middle from tree small is not only systematic, its also very popular in Poland. I do not liks those leads vs 3NT in IMPs|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tomi2: these Championships are part of the very nice Bridge Festival in Sopot (close to Gdansk at the Baltic Sea). I already hadd my flight tickets and an offer from Wiankowski to stay in ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: his home, but for several reasons I had to cancel my trip :(  nice that I can participate via BBO anyway :)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|othered1: True|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East's double usually just shows a decent hand, as opposed to what you might overcall with |pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: although double would be a good option, if that shows what North has got - some small spade support plus a few hearts|pg||
nt|tomi2: but I think this style coms from all those MP tourneys that are played in Poland all the time. In those festivals (exept of this one / this year) you usualy play 8 days MP and one ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: day IMP|pg||
nt|tez: @c lead give chanse for down..if @h lead..he will put k of @s..because @h shift kills to declarer|pg||
pc|c5|nt|janhamhurg: do you really think that the programms represent the statistics?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: This one doesn't|pg||

nt|tomi2: wests @S7 was a try to show that she wanted him to switch so some other suit|pg||

pc|c2|nt|psridhar: in other room declarer lost trump control when he cashed h ace too soon to prevent a dia ruff|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psridhar: if they find the dia lead other tbl thi match will tighten|pg||
pc|h2|nt|janhamhurg: most dont- the problem is, that dull 1 notrump hand noone likes to play and see- so they just manipulate the programm same in bbo for sure:)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: obviously the heart length is unclear, as otherwise West might have tried 2@H. But he has three spades, so 2@S is ok |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also a spade lead against the same contract in the CR|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3rd 6-6 in a row but perhaps the first failure ( in making a contract out of those 3 deals)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West really should complain now. He is dealt a boring 5431|pg||
nt|tomi2: Skrzypczak hates to claim for -1 he seems to play every card and hope some of his sportcard will become an ace :)|pg||

nt|mamos:  hmmm  not exactly text book 3@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|othered1: Easy game in NT or either minor, as cards lie.|pg||
nt|dimi: 3nt by E-W|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as to whether it shows any strength, that is a different question |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is a great contract, 5 of either mi also makes|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C over 1@C is natural while 2@D after 11C is used as some artifical overcall|pg||
mb|2D|nt|othered1: I guess their 3 bids in minors are very sound, suit-wise|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: nice 3@s opening:)he has sequence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My partners never have those suits when they pre-empt, more like Jxxxxx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or Jxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: it's a pretty solid suit, if you ignore the AKQJ|pg||
nt|tez: semi solid..if he has 7 of @s he will get canasta:)|pg||
nt|othered1: EW are now > 30 imps behind in the match.  That may have something to do with the preempt, if they are judging the state of the match correctly|pg||
nt|mamos:  worked out well for East|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 62.1-31, according to the web site|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but will pick up 6 imps here|pg||
nt|mamos:  no one bid over 3s at the other table|pg||
nt|tez: olech says to declarer..i opened 3@s..doesnt matter..put any @s from dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Surprising. Looks a normal-ish raise to 4@S|pg||
nt|mamos:  well 4@H looks good foe NS so EW may have thought they had good score|pg||
nt|mamos:  in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The most common hand pattern (by far) is 4432, around 21% of the time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Goraco back in the match. 11 IMPs on 4|pg||
nt|psridhar: the m/c heard u sadistically jan :)|pg||

nt|othered1: Matter of style to me.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, pre-empt in 2nd should have full value|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos:  ah game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, he knows that the grand slam is no worse than on a finesse through the hand with more black cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Pass may show three keys|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most pairs play some variant of DOPI/ROPI|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Odd number og keycards I presume|pg||
nt|dimi: NS made life really hard to explore the grand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But can't that be 1?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's see|pg||
nt|tez: they know now minus 11 imp lost on board 4|pg||
nt|psridhar: wd|pg||
pc|d8|nt|othered1: 1N should keep north from having any thoughts of slam|pg||
nt|tomi2: the winner of this match will play against team Svindahl. Their opps already withdraw after 2 segments|pg||
nt|tez: she sry|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: South's hand is rather good for play in a black suit to open 1N, unless needed to keep the system together.  In natural approaches, it would be a pro-am bid.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 4NT is RKCB, it makes sense to use pass as step 3 - two keys without|pg||
nt|othered1: Is 4N guaranteed to have @S key?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however if pass/double are steps 1 and 2, you need to differentiate between the 0/3 and 4/1 options|pg||
nt|othered1: If not, east might now think he has extras to go on.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My thoughts too, Ed. Can East know that spades are set?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which may not be too easy - so credit to NS for this barrage|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, he knows *now*|pg||
nt|othered1: *Now* he can.|pg||

nt|psridhar: bold bidding by N|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|othered1: These considerations come up at committees after west takes a while to bid 6@S.  But they are considerations.|pg||
nt|othered1: Do  you have agreements for handling RKC in the midst of preemption?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe a GF 2NT response (Jacoby-like) is the answer with that hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then there is no ambiguity later|pg||
nt|psridhar: what happened Pepsi? he had a strong team?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|baardolav: Gierrulski is working really hard for this hand... |pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, some strong teams did not make it to the 1/4 finales or lost there|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wd hv put my money on pepsi at start of the tourney|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psridhar: bidding 2c on an aceless hand and a moderate suit VUL in an auction where no fit was found by oppo was bold enuf-he followed it by a X of 2d also|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: This N-S pair is good. You do not win the Vanderbilt if you aren't. They did in 2008|pg||

nt|tomi2: dbl in Poland in 4th position is often some Kind of "I think this hand belongs slightly to us, lets increase the stacks"|pg||
nt|psridhar: aggressive balancing entry into the auction, no maj fit exists, can get clobbered now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@d=option 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D artificial game force with 3+ spades|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: missing 2 aces - so no slam here|pg||
nt|tez: nice 6@s only 2 aces left:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: most pairs do not play direct penalty doubles, so if partner has some 14 or 15 points he/she can easily pass. with a week hand they often find a spot to play themselves|pg||
nt|tez: will be end 2@c dbl|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk N will sit for this 1nt X-make overtrick hopefully |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: this will h ide north's @S support.  East may bid anyway.|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4 dia and club ace is all EW can get - 380 is likely|pg||
nt|tomi2: this is also a stlye that works out nicely in MP tourneys, 200 will give you a huge top if you time your double well and defend correctly while -180 will be bad of course, but if ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: you make it right more then 50% of the time you will score well|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: there are some players who would NEVER pass now in the East seat...|pg||
nt|tez: Ewa again found best lead:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: and for that matter, after 1@S-2@s with the West hand|pg||
nt|mamos:  making 2@S looks good from CR|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree on both auctions -- action needed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S  5 cards (I think)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: we will hear the breaks -|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|othered1: their auction has given them lots of room here for exploration.  Impressive so far.|pg||
nt|tez: all pass now|pg||
nt|psridhar: and if you combine all those odds in the 4 bds, we may hv a micronic probability event-but it happened now|pg||
nt|tez: 3@d is not my style|pg||
nt|psridhar: flattish 650 i expect|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|psridhar: however declarer has to find 3 pitches from dummy..if he retains all clubs , then he may lose a trick-he shd keep 2 spd for 2 finesses|pg||
nt|tomi2: other room had the same start but W escaped and found himself in a not confortable spot|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: and seeing that EW have a decent play for 4@H, perhaps they are right|pg||
nt|kubusiu: running scores: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/soptsrunda1.html|pg||
nt|othered1: I gues their methods require up the line control showing.  At one time, many experts didn't approve of first cue-bids being made on voids, but times have changed considerably|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: You shrug and pass 2@S, Tez?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3@d should indicate a much stronger hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: I'm told 3@S asks for void.  Perhaps there were other implications to the earlier @S calls.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I see from the web site that there is a 4.1 imp carryover |pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting that South has bypassed 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: if north showed a void, that's a lot of duplication.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did 2@S imply a minimum for the 1@S response, 8+?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8-9 maybe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: do we know if 2@S showed anyhting particular?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 7-9 hcp, thanks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and five spades.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks all :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a little better than 7-9, isn't it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would also pass 2@S|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D is an attempt to get to a better spot, but the hand should be stronger for it in my opinion|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: stoppp|pg||
nt|tez: all cards are right place|pg||
nt|tez: except @d T|pg||
nt|psridhar: u make a bal X of 1nt-find pd with 10 hcp ;a dia suit in an 8 card fit, and in 2D u go for 800-thats the E hand for u :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: When 2@D promises a fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: pd heard the take out X on his right , i bid red suits; he still chose 2s, i respect his decision|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: I'm told, now, that 4@C was just shortness, while 3N would  have denied shortness anywhere|pg||
nt|dimi: well done|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tez: 3@d is invitation hand imo 5/5|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The other room stopped in 2@S, but by N-S :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: with @HK instead of @HA he is trying to get correct count signals|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: this is also the sort of thing you get on Appeal Committees, when North goes on over a slow 4@S. Not that that was the case here, we presume|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: East is not too unhappy|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|tomi2: both, E and W might thimk their partner has the ace so I must show him the cound to make him duck correctly|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|tomi2: he might know the total count of the hand. @S3 suggested 4spades, hearts seem to be 4 as well and after @D3 lead but no continuation @D seem to be 4-4 also|pg||

nt|dimi: anyway good lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|janhamhurg: id prefer to overbid in my 9 card spade suit than to defend a game that might make|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or a spade lead??|pg||
pc|dT|nt|othered1: no, but from south's POV, major Js, not really biddable, may be the key.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: From bad to worse, Aus 29-4, Ponting out lbw|pg||
nt|tez: np with @d lead..allways 9 trick|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|othered1: and the @Hsuit may well run opposite xx|pg||

pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: @H8 must mean I have good spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that may do it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East knows partner has three cards to choose from|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but sometimes that will cost 200 instead of 100- so you must be right sometimes|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|othered1: But, as cards lie, I can't see any play with reasonable defense for 6N.  6@H would have been another story, but why should south assume north is off-shape?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: Ditto, 6@S.  |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|d4|pg||

nt|Walddk2: And now confirmed as he did not overtake|pg||
nt|othered1: east took the sure beat.  Not ridiculous.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: I think this is a brilliant defence|pg||

nt|psridhar: a sensible stop in 2nt after tht light opening-shd make on the nose|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but no entree to the spades|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|othered1: This is about as friendly a layout for NS as  you can imagine|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in one of his books Martin Hoffman speculated that Poland has, not the srongest national team, but probably the strongest 50 pairs, on a per country basis|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Zia once said: "No-one can spell their names, but they sure can play"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'm told there are 2 million bridge players in Poland - is that correct? It seems rather a lot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 20,000. Still a large number|pg||
nt|Walddk2: More than 20,000 surely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 20,000 registered players I'm told. May be more than that who play |pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: Can @H plays beat it on an uppercut?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denmark has 250,000 with a population of 5.5 million. 25,000 in the DBF|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even if South doesn't find the club switch there aren't enough tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently you don't have to be a registered player to play at a club.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the Polish bridge magazine sells only 5000 copies a month|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe South is reading the magazine....|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: no, he is is thinking...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: :) it's so easy for us. We can see all the hands|pg||
nt|psridhar: hard to argue with a person of such linguistic skills as Roland :)|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: I mean, would any women say she is semi-pregnant? Either she is or she is not|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos:  big swing in the context of the match if 4@s beaten it would have been very close|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: see http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/soptq1t2-2.htm for running scores|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tez: very hard to bid 6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4NT?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: convert 5@C to 5@D to show diamonds and hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (which is what happened at the other table)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Nice to have 4N mean that and maybe it clearly should be a 2-suiter.  Depends on what double would mean here.  For me, it's clearly for takeout.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C is often 12-14 balanced|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@H = spades after interference|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: it does show two places to play for an immense majority|pg||
nt|othered1: Why was 5@C alerted?|pg||
nt|tez: 5@c pass or correct|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a great game, but on a good day it makes. Club lead will help|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: gosh|pg||
nt|tez: now 5@h means @d and @h..|pg||
nt|tez: brave @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @SK to A, @HQ back - West had better convert this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or even @S10, as pointed out....  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: @HQ back is not so fanciful if 4NT is two-suited, but does need a certain amount of bottle|pg||
nt|mamos:  maybe hard for West to believe Hearts|pg||
nt|othered1: this goes down'on funny @S lead to urge @H shift.  Can they work it out?|pg||
nt|tez: west thking whats 6@d..2 suiter or not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: also West may be thinking that 4NT was meant as ace-asking - if 5@C shows one, then maybe 6@D is to play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a comfortable position|pg||
nt|othered1: Why would 5@C show one with no key suit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, agreed, but you never know|pg||
nt|othered1: true, but that method would make 4N less safe, if ace-asking|pg||
nt|tez: i dont belive 4nt is asking aces|pg||
nt|ritong: no way|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West is taking an awfully long time here - I don't blame her|pg||
nt|othered1: Nor I.  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 6@D seems a gamble|pg||
nt|ritong: she is carressing grand|pg||
nt|othered1: But if they don't have a takeout bid over 4@S other than 4N, how do you handle a great hand?  OTOH, east could bid 6@D directly in that case.|pg||
nt|ritong: west has no doubt about the suits|pg||
nt|ritong: she has a doubt about the level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a lot of correspondence about East's sequence - I'm afraid I don't get it either. Sorry if I can't reply to all|pg||
nt|tez: probably just thinking about 6 or 7 hearts |pg||
nt|othered1: If no firm agreement here, as it looks like there isn't, I don't envy west his problem.|pg||
nt|mamos:  its hard not to fear a disaster|pg||
nt|othered1: Sorry her problem.|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: everybody left the table for a while|pg||
nt|ritong: one of the elements is, even if 7@h is cold, probably 7@s is cheap|pg||
nt|tez: what do you lead from west..2 of @s or q or t?|pg||
nt|ritong: @s Q|pg||
nt|tez: south sry|pg||
nt|othered1: Had east bid a simple, ultrasound 5@D over 5@C, this would have been over quite a while ago.|pg||
nt|tez: against to 6@d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: http://www.msc.com.pl/cezar/    here you can find all bridge players registered in Poland.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Increasingly popular to play transfer responses after intervention|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Some do it all the time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: after 1@C|pg||
nt|baardolav: Have done it for 15 years now...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it won't get that now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Probably a heart|pg||
nt|tez: @h6 ithk|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psridhar: i thought they dont raise on 3 cards that 2s !|pg||
nt|tomi2: the invit did not improve his contract but made club lead unlikely. how often has west qxxx and partner ax and you get a trick / tempo without giving this information|pg||
nt|tez: i m learning polish style leads:)|pg||
nt|tez: they lead 2/4|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, @H6 shows a holdings similar to a stright flush in poker :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: good decision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I believe the 6 could also be from 7643  or  76x|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: very reasonable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done West|pg||
nt|ritong: 1) east has not cued @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: 2) maybe the par is 7@s doubled|pg||
nt|mdgraham: she took a long time there, and justifiably so |pg||
nt|mamos:  :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder what she will think about her partners' bidding.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So they worked for you|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i wouldnt recomend a double with the north hand, but here in poland they can follow with a natural 2 clubs if necessary, since 1 club doesnt show clubs|pg||
nt|psridhar: a popular auction is 1nt-2d-2h all pass; the trf auction here has catapulted them into a perilious 3h..|pg||
nt|psridhar: Boss said prison if u do that :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|ritong: she already did:)|pg||

nt|tomi2: or H6x ot 76 or 86 or 96, but Olech will know bec. S did not bid 3@H|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|tomi2: prison is only in France. In Poland you get to prison if you lead high from a doubleton :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dimi: 4@c can be made if you drop K of @c|pg||
nt|psridhar: west had to bid 3h to invite -like in 1nt-2d-3h super accept|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and ns might make 3 clubs- so all fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No need to really if you play 1@H as a one-round force|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Usually with 3 hearts, but can be 4 with an invitational hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk they play 1h as 2/3 cards and 2h as 4 cards and 3h as 4 card invitnal|pg||
nt|psridhar: otherwise no expln for that 3h|pg||
nt|tez: All the good players will play xfer of the responder's suits in the future.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: it works well here since they always open 1 club...|pg||
nt|tez: ace of @c and q from skr..|pg||
nt|baardolav: the day will come that natural rebids will be alerted... And xferbids not...?|pg||
