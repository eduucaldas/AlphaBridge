mb|p|mb|3D|nt|vugraphzpb: 2D=GF check back|pg||

nt|buffytvs: especially if Ross takes a bid here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|buffytvs: presumably that's a txfr|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure it is|pg||
nt|guppy: well - 3N is even better than than 5m and Piotr found the winning initial action (1N vs. X) to steer them there|pg||
nt|lml: 5@H is a decent save or 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 5@D|pg||
nt|lml: either|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tough call for East now|pg||
nt|lml: With those trump I bet he bids on|pg||
nt|lml: if partner has diamonds it looks like he only has 2.5 losers|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a full 18 with a diamond fit, but does he want to commit to 11 tricks?|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|lml: well that will be a steal then|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thgouht he might dbl|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lml: I think he should bid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: if partner has nothing else he has good diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: avoiding the Elvis Coup in diamonds, which as it happens, doesn't cost|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he didnt think clubs was a transfer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he had even better clubs|pg||
nt|lml: otherwise that is sort of a strange lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: what would you have led from his hand?|pg||
nt|lml: the elvis coup|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: keith is looking for some high cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: me too|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|buffytvs: there's a 10 :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lml: fortunately he doesnt need to get to dummy|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s3|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lml: 2@H over 1NT doesnt have to show much but Taylor's hand was less than not much|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|s5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lml: now Piotrk nows the diamond position|pg||
nt|lml: and the club position and the heart position....|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lml: so this is a potential pickup for Korbel |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|d8|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|buffytvs: yes - but it wouldn't shock me if they pushed the board|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think it's hard to bid 5@D EW|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lml: I was asked if it was common to bid with zero points... no|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lml: but with the notrump bid he wasn't showing more than a few|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but South is limtied since he didn't double the 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I thought he might even bid 3@H|pg||
nt|lml: yes and the diamond singleton and four trump count as dummy points|pg||
nt|lml: 3@H would have been my choice|pg||
nt|lml: that for sure shows nothing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: director call  one side was not alerted to the transfer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: however he has to be careful -- he doesn't want to push the opponents into something like a slam when he has no defence|pg||
nt|guppy: N/S will be delighted with that result....|pg||
nt|lml: there can be no redress for north south they already got blood|pg||
nt|buffytvs: don't see that a non-alert affected anything|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: now e/w need a certain convention called blackwood to avois another plausible slam|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|roswolf: indeed carl|pg||
nt|haans: long way to slamn here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d!|nt|roswolf: well the heart interfernce will give the auction momentum|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|haans: but no spade support = down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: previous hand I think the line Geoff pointed out previous hand is the most pragmatic - if not the best. Attempt ruff out @CQ - then try @S finesse |pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: 4@C IS STANDOUT - how can west pass - momma mia|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|sharkey: Or raise to 4@S Vul - cant afford to miss this kond of games|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|haans: did 3@S really show good hand?|pg||

pc|s3|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|sharkey: West must have more than minimum values to make a neg Dbl forcing bidding to 3 level|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|c9|pg||
mc|12|nt|roswolf: yes as the auction went 3@C rather than double might have been better|pg||
nt|roswolf: embarrassing number of tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: East knew pd had max 1@H so probably shud just bid game and hope for a couple of @S in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Hansen tells x is good raise in S  0 somethg like 9+ ma 3-card support. X is that when he cant bid opps suit under level|pg||
nt|roswolf: certainly practical being at red - big upside|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: thanks !|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|buffytvs: the C!A is a disappointment to declarer -- it's a trick, but he'd far rather have the @DK for example|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||

nt|buffytvs: he might well guess the diamond position seeing the 9 fall|pg||
nt|lml: I am certain he will guess the position but I am usually wrong|pg||
nt|lml: he knows the spade honors are likely split and Piotr has 0-6 so there isnt much room for diamond honors|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lml: yeah I think they can make 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but the spades are friendly, as long as you don't play Restricted Choice|pg||
nt|lml: as long as they guess spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the key is to cash the ace first|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you don[t guess spades, you may be struggling|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lml: now will these two 4-3-3-3 hands avoid the spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he's oging to get a diamond lead, and will take the inference that North is likely to have longer spades, and play a spade to the king (I think)|pg||

nt|buffytvs: but 10 tricks in spades are even more difficult than 9 in NT on this deal|pg||
nt|lml: well the heart lead didnt hurt him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- Keith avoided the club lead|pg||
nt|lml: if he guesses spades there might be some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|buffytvs: which would blow a trick|pg||
nt|lml: so how can you make it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: strip hearts, draw trumps, and play a diamond, hoping North ducks?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|buffytvs: then he has to give a ruff-sluff or play clubs, which would be enough|pg||

nt|buffytvs: how would 3@H have fared -- I didn't have time to look|pg||

nt|buffytvs: a heart now gest ruffed, declarer can cash the @SQ, but then has to play a club from dummy himself|pg||

nt|sharkey: Some may PASS Geoff:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: What's 2@H?|pg||
nt|haans: maybe 2@H was reverse (strong)|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 14 points incl stiff @CQ?|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: SOUTH HAD BETTER SIGN OFF QUICKLY|pg||

nt|roswolf: north appears still to be|pg||
nt|roswolf: interested i mean|pg||
nt|haans: still why 2@H?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it was alerted maybe peter can tell us?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: at last -|pg||

nt|snoraa: dicey little hand..noone wants to play it|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|lml: a couple of imps came back on the hand in 4@S where Taylor went 3 down after he didnt finesse the diamond|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|mb|d|nt|lml: do you think north south will buy this in spades?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not undoubled anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: in the OR Wolpert the West hand had a chance to raise diamonds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as did West here|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but declined to|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: now he will I think|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to Paul Thurston|pg||
nt|thurston:  jc might scramble 7 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think he has to raise now... dont you?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: although I like dbl better on east's hand|pg||
nt|lml: or do you think ... my partner is playing me for this|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this just sounds like lots of diamonds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: exactly|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I would be thikning, if all partner needs is third jack of diamonds and an ace, he should have done something stronger|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: gords head is in his hands|pg||
nt|thurston:  ugly hand to lead from|pg||
nt|snoraa: good shot on lead|pg||
nt|thurston:  most effective start a low heart and that was probably Maurice's last choice|pg||
nt|flash: red suit best for the defense - @D8 would have been reasonable?   (but anything might've worked)|pg||
nt|flash: i love the Ten from that holding (if one is going to lead the suit)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|buffytvs: on the other hand, playing in 4 of a minor is like kissing your sister|pg||
nt|flash: starts to unblock and should preserve any honor(s) in partner's hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|d4|pc|h6|pg||
