nt|hedyg: good hand for weak 2 suiter in N but usually in Poland that is 5 5...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda4.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt they can find the slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: NV they may skimp a little?|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: sorry, but we have some problems here|pg||
nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: wrong cards?|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: yes|pg||

nt|VugraphP1: we're closing, sorry|pg||
nt|hedyg: shame, this is a very interesting hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: try again :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Third time lucky I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Both pairs play Polish @C Marcin?|pg||
nt|baldjean: I was just about to post the same :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: obserwujemy mecz dwóch pierwszych druzyn w klasyfikacji - prowadzi Henclik przed Mr¹gowi¹|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am afraid EW might try 4@s here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have Polish commentary in the closed room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome back|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|nt|baldjean: this will be a 4@s|pg||
mb|1H!|an|Spades 4+ 6+HCP|mb|p|mb|1N|an|w/o 3/4!S|nt|h_karluk: one of the best known Polish Junior pairs, Piotr Wiankowski & Michal Nowosadzki, who had also represented their country in Jesolo|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: 4@S could be very wrong but you've got to bid it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this indeed really tough table, both sides established partnerships|pg||
mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: yes sir, agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Boguslaw PAZUR is a famous WIM in Poland, active in International field since 1994|pg||
nt|othered1: east's first pass looks normal, though some might double 2@H as takout of @S, wh ich prevents being boosted out of the auction if dummy is weak and opener superaccepts to 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jan Lammerich|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi, welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda9.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think this should stop the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the penultimate round of 6 boards today|pg||
mb|3H|nt|baldjean: I doubt West will bid 5@c in this vulnerability situation|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: Marek is an old gun, since 1978 active|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|othered1: and double of 2@H for takout of @S isn't all that dangerous, since it implies some @H length and partner can pass with a crumby hand and a few @H.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: since the 2 heart bid limits the hand to 10 points, west 3 hearts seem optimistic|pg||
nt|h_karluk: here is a Polish bridge joke : You know that an overcall of 3Sp over 1Sp means, partner, I have a solid minor, if you have a spade stopper, please bid 3NT. But do you know the ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Polish version of that convention?:) Partner, I have a spade stopper, if you have a solid minor, please bid 3NT. :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|baldjean: double was a bit keen, in my opinion, but it works|pg||
pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: just eleven tricks there for NS pairs|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|othered1: Double on this auction was far more dangerous.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|baldjean: interestingly the other table landed in 3@s only|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I agree with the final contrace and will use an inviting sequence as N instead of a direct 4@s|pg||
nt|baldjean: are there any problems, operator? or is West thinkin?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|othered1: and could have been hammered for 500, a large pick-up "out of thin air."|pg||

nt|h_karluk: classic 5/3 or 4/4 case|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk4: I have just been told that there will be a longer break than scheduled. Restart at 16.30 local time|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: next session starts 16.30|pg||
nt|baldjean: And settled for the 4/4.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's true|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Best lead for the defence, but declarer can prevail with spades 3-2 (ace on side) and hearts 3-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a great game, but makeable|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @CA, spade|pg||
nt|h_karluk: undo?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Pazur supposed to pass|pg||

nt|h_karluk: the link is for NS pair|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sharkey: Bye to East's hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: West will be endplayed at some stage for minimum 9 tricks|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: i think it well may be 1100|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there should be a good side to every situation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was an error not to cover the 8, but easier for us|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now the heart suit is dead, it is expensive|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but that's life, for every force, there is a counter force, for every negative there is a positive and for every action there is a reaction. In other words for every cause there is ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: an effect |pg||

mb|d|mb|1H|an|4+!S|nt|h_karluk: i guess they believe get paid to impact the bridge world, not be impacted by it|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: not always recommended to underlead aces in suit contracts but this one worked well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is the easiest game now with @HA onside|pg||
mb|4H|an|Splinter, possibly !C|nt|h_karluk: likely 3n FOR EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ouch, sorry for  caps lock, my bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not sure what he would do if he got a 2@S response. Maybe 2NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless 2@C is Puppet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Cheap penalty card - only 1 or 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing much has changed here. Cichocki would also have bid if Henclik had passed 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 6@c...:(|pg||
nt|hedyg: okok i am ambitious!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: :) - @S9 and @S10 makes the difference...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c opening is usually reserved to show a limited hand with long clubs and possibly 4-card major, similar to Precision 2@copening|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: E said: 4441 without @D or 5440 w/o @D|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so the polish handgenerator serves us a lot of highly interesting games-|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I suspect 1@H shows spades and that 4@H is a splinter for spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: rt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's pretty common to play transfer responses after a take-out double|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jutek: prawdopodobnie po wiscie kierowym 11 lew|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well can ruff and pull @s A|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: Slawek HENCLIK was partner of Boguslaw GIERULSKI between 97-99|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6 NT as well|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so now he will make 5 easily|pg||
pc|d7|nt|h_karluk: Hey Ed, good to see you|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hedyg: 6NT seems to make too without the @H lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|baldjean: 4@s is a bit too high|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NS did well to push EW one level higher|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They would have done even better if Wejknis had led a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@d response  relay, forcing to 3@c. Opener shows a 4-card suit (3@d shows extras) or makes a choice between 2NT and 3@c with long clubs.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but we see, now he would be able to pitch 2nd @d loser to established @h K|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|janhamhurg: or at least 4 after this dia play|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Which I think is mandatory on this auction|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|othered1: I agree, especially on an auction where you know you have the balance of power|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some have never led one in their lives|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe thehy recognize it as passive defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: way eleven|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: But it is a very popular lead among the great Italian players|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I guess Boguslaw would never stop his inventions, each year hard to reach it as a VG commentator remember him since 2007|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: 2@h/2@s response to 2@c not forcing, good 5-card suit (711 HCP)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: not so easy to see, but a @h discard had been better for W|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: sandra landy http://www.ebu.co.uk/general/biographies/players/sandralandy.htm|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like north is choosing to bid his hand out, rather than the simple raise to 3N in the CR|pg||
mb|d|an|Something more|mb|p|nt|sybarra: does East move to game?  I do |pg||
nt|sybarra: however the jxx of clubs doesnt look great |pg||

mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: ty Hedy|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree |pg||
nt|sybarra: should be minimum 6/4 |pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would just open 4@S as Jassem did in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doubled part score contracts mostly|pg||
nt|othered1: Pretty much "Have a reason not to lead a trump."  And then double-check it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: South with no @C fit and a relative minimum puts the brakes on.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 7-4 with a rotten 4-carder is not a two-suiter in my view|pg||
nt|baldjean: what is 4@c here? a transfer to @d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or noise?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or bid 4@s after 2nt from E|pg||
nt|baldjean: I agree, Roland|pg||
nt|baldjean: especially not with those few HCP|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What do you call AK109863?|pg||
nt|sybarra: TRUMPS |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Trumps!|pg||

pc|c8|nt|sharkey: These matches are played on a 20 VP scale'|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Declarer has 8 tricks if he plays spades from the right hand, low from dummy. He may go down if he doesn't|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But first Skrz needs to duck this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They lead low from a doubleton in Poland, middle from three|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|othered1: Here, too, declarer likely will take his 9 tricks, but running @D may make play for an overtrick possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has the 10, or the 8 is a singleton|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1 NT 1517 HCP, 2@s response  transfer for clubs. Opener may choose between a positive 2NT, and a negative 3@c. Responder may continue by showing shortage.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mahy shoot the moon now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he did not lead @C8 with his left hand, so it's not a singleton|pg||

nt|h_karluk: lead and (b)) when it appears likely from the bidding that the contract will be a close affair|pg||

nt|othered1: Anyone know what EW are playing?  They do open 2@C with long @C and a minumum (b6y their standards) opening.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: only @h a lead good|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: the 2 dia is part of multilandy|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 1@S m ight be an Animal Blue Team opening.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting point abt their sys : 1N> 2Transfer to hearts (2@d) does not deny five spades. Responders new suit at the 3-level forces to game. Also: 1NT - 2@d; 2@h - 2@s forces to ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@h (8+ HCP)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 cl- both maj|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2dia- 1maj|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|sharkey: If @D were 3-1 this would make so EW unlucky here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jean|pg||
mb|3N|nt|baldjean: interesting lead; I would not have done that|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2hearts-h+min|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am pretty sure the best way to improve is just hire a pro and study the lessons|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 1@h/1@s openings in general 5 cards, 1217 HCP, 1NT response NF|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told 1@S showed: 10-14 unbalanced with 4+ @S or 10-11 5332|pg||
nt|othered1: And majors are opened in preference to a longer minor.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be a style, ie different approaches depends vulnerability|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If spades are 3-2, you can't go down. Rise with the ace and pull trumps. Then @HA and 10|pg||

nt|othered1: 3N and 4@H are good spots, but west has to put the brakes on.  @SA position, howeer, will let them play at the 5-level|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ultra light overcall at 2nd seat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do they play Dwururka?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes , Pazur's sys|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess so|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i respect, for sure they are experienced and have ideas|pg||
mb|3D|nt|h_karluk: I think Pazur's sys named as Dwururka, after Winning Polish open trial for 08 EC might update|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|othered1: dEclarer on last hand pitched the wrong suit -- @D on @HK, @H ruff, then @S ruff with dummy's last trump would have worked|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: or 6@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: Also  we thank Slwaek Lataia,  the organizer of this tourney.  Much appreciated by all BBO vugraph fans! |pg||
nt|othered1: How do you play 4N?  If control asking, why not immediately?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but i am afraid he changes it too much |pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx spec,  love the insight and comments |pg||

nt|h_karluk: one of the Pazur's sys card here : http://www.archiviobridge.it/Pazur-Zawislak.pdf|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ralfwil: 3@c instead of 2nt resulted in 3nt on W and a @h lead from N - and down|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Exactly. Then 2@S was waste of time|pg||

nt|othered1: Lots and lots of cue-bids, but this isn't a very elegant contract.  Wonder if either North or South thought partner had a first round control, particularly the second @H bid by ...|pg||
nt|othered1: north (if 4@C was natural)|pg||
