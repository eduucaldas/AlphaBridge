nt|hedyg: good hand for weak 2 suiter in N but usually in Poland that is 5 5...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda4.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt they can find the slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: NV they may skimp a little?|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: sorry, but we have some problems here|pg||
nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: wrong cards?|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: redeal to 19|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: we're closing, sorry|pg||
nt|hedyg: shame, this is a very interesting hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: try again :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Third time lucky I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Both pairs play Polish @C Marcin?|pg||
nt|baldjean: I was just about to post the same :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: obserwujemy mecz dwóch pierwszych druzyn w klasyfikacji - prowadzi Henclik przed Mr¹gowi¹|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am afraid EW might try 4@s here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have Polish commentary in the closed room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome back|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2 top team on 145 or so, but bottom is closely bunched; so we expect tough fight for QF spots|pg||
nt|andyv:  that was a quick 5 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, 5 mins only last 2 in Poland|pg||
mb|2D|an|multi|nt|andyv:  multi by E|pg||
mb|3D|nt|baldjean: this will be a 4@s|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi again|pg||
mb|3H|an| |nt|janhamhurg: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda9.html|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  3@h should be p/c|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: one of the best known Polish Junior pairs, Piotr Wiankowski & Michal Nowosadzki, who had also represented their country in Jesolo|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: 4@S could be very wrong but you've got to bid it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this indeed really tough table, both sides established partnerships|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: yes sir, agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Boguslaw PAZUR is a famous WIM in Poland, active in International field since 1994|pg||
nt|othered1: east's first pass looks normal, though some might double 2@H as takout of @S, wh ich prevents being boosted out of the auction if dummy is weak and opener superaccepts to 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jan Lammerich|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi, welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda9.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think this should stop the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the penultimate round of 6 boards today|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Irwin Boris|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: leading team meets third place|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Two strong pairs at this table|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: I doubt West will bid 5@c in this vulnerability situation|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Piotr Gawrys and Piotr Tuszynski are big boys|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi Irwin|pg||
pc|hA|nt|janhamhurg: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda10.html|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club switch will doom it|pg||
nt|psridhar: thats a bold 3s but his last chance to get into the auction, 4s may be right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree, don't leave partner in 3@S with a fit and a singleton|pg||
pc|h3|nt|janhamhurg: a club switch will defeat this|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Marek is an old gun, since 1978 active|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: the latest version!|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|othered1: and double of 2@H for takout of @S isn't all that dangerous, since it implies some @H length and partner can pass with a crumby hand and a few @H.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: since the 2 heart bid limits the hand to 10 points, west 3 hearts seem optimistic|pg||
nt|h_karluk: here is a Polish bridge joke : You know that an overcall of 3Sp over 1Sp means, partner, I have a solid minor, if you have a spade stopper, please bid 3NT. But do you know the ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Polish version of that convention?:) Partner, I have a spade stopper, if you have a solid minor, please bid 3NT. :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|baldjean: double was a bit keen, in my opinion, but it works|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think it matters actually|pg||
pc|c9|nt|h_karluk: just eleven tricks there for NS pairs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: Double on this auction was far more dangerous.|pg||
nt|psridhar: i dare say the multi let North in- if the auction were to go 2h-3d-4h-? i doubt he will bid 4s|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|baldjean: interestingly the other table landed in 3@s only|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I agree with the final contrace and will use an inviting sequence as N instead of a direct 4@s|pg||
nt|baldjean: are there any problems, operator? or is West thinkin?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Declarer would have been unable to untangle the trump suit anyway|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: and could have been hammered for 500, a large pick-up "out of thin air."|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: many will wonder about that 2 club bid|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Shows 18+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C is ambiguous|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|ralfwil: and too many losers on S for 4@s|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wouldn't keep the carpet clean|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: since most play a 2 cl opener as 12-16, a rebid shows 17-19|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Often 12-14 balanced but when he bids again after pass from partner, he has the strong version|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am surprised to see Tuszynski there without Jacek Pszcola, but maybe he is still in neigbor state North Carolina USA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *neighbor|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: yes, cards are ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@D puts pressure on S |pg||
nt|hedyg: double would work well here|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that does not describe the S hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't get it (CR result)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: slam NT for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5 IMPs but still significant in a 6-board match|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as far as i remember for 220|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: normally both minors 6-9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: gotcha, thanks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT = weak with both minors|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: That's what N wants to hear....|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: pass or 3NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda6.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C is a fine contract, even 7 has play|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ok i hear: 2club opener shows 11-14, so the 2 cl rebid shows 15+|pg||
nt|andyv:  another 4@s contract|pg||
mb|2D|an|6+ !H, undefined force|mb|p|nt|baldjean: nice slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: everyday slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he likes to attend regionals in Georgia, Atlanta, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Polish Club    1@C   1. 12-14 balanced - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. Any 18+|pg||
nt|irwinbo: many fearless folk would have opened 3 diamonds if system allowed|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 no is limited to 18, since no 1 cl opener|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: Matches of 6 boards in the qualifying|pg||
nt|othered1: south has an interesting rebid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i must admit i would pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: me too - South's hand likely to be unbalanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: in CR it was pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@S is on as it is, but they took the money|pg||

nt|hedyg: 9@H just became huge|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classic 5/3 or 4/4 case|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: I have just been told that there will be a longer break than scheduled. Restart at 16.30 local time|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: next session starts 16.30|pg||
nt|baldjean: And settled for the 4/4.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's true|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Best lead for the defence, but declarer can prevail with spades 3-2 (ace on side) and hearts 3-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a great game, but makeable|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2D must be a trf to 2h -so that opener has another chance to bid|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so this is how to treat an invitational 6-3 hand- i like it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: is this gazilli?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It shows 18+ with at least 3 spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Game-forcing|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: @CA, spade|pg||
nt|h_karluk: undo?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Pazur supposed to pass|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: knowing 4 spades make easily, 5 clubs might be a good idea, but it will dost a fortune here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the link is for NS pair|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Bye to East's hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: West will be endplayed at some stage for minimum 9 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 2@c|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: cost|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 500 not really much of a compensation|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not my cup of tea sir, besides i am a married man, if i would open it 3@d i would be a dead meat :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 18-- wait -let me count...|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Add VAT|pg||
mb|3D|an|"something" in !D|nt|h_karluk: thanks|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No other line seems attractive|pg||
nt|othered1: But NS have handled this well.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think the club suit disappeared|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, it did in the 50's I suppose|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far yes|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now not even 5 level is safe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Going up all the time|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: no worries , its okay Marcin :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Well, declarer does not agree|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: bec of 2 potential dia loser|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hearts very friendly for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could go for a zillion if clubs had been 3-1 and hearts less friendly|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: only -2 ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: and a possible spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh sorry, I thought South opened 1@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  only problem with 3N is finding tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D shows an extra heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  1@S  ;  2@D   is how I thought it went|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all :)|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: local time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has got to play a spade from dummy anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could have, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club to the king and a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he can't any more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think it well may be 1100|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there should be a good side to every situation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was an error not to cover the 8, but easier for us|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now the heart suit is dead, it is expensive|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but that's life, for every force, there is a counter force, for every negative there is a positive and for every action there is a reaction. In other words for every cause there is ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: an effect |pg||
nt|psridhar: the reason why S suggested 3nt with 6-3 in Maj is bcos he doesnt know yet about the 5 card spd with N ? |pg||
nt|andyv:  I can't imagine  S really wanted to play 3N.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: to bad- i liked the sequense so far, but passing 3 no with 2 small dia with a known spade fit is strange|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This contract has a major flaw  .... and a minor|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: and if not then E will be endplayed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Shirley|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess would draw @d 10|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: Mich as well have done it at trick 2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting, didn't hook|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so instead of nice 620  we will have - 200 or so|pg||
nt|andyv:  not only was the surgery not a success but the patient died too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are you sure 4M would always make?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: Rite :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and pitch a @s|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@H doesn't make... not sure if 4@s has a play or not|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: he can disc a @c now and play small @H|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: sorry, i missed the play. E played  A @D out of the order, and had to discard it to spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhh wow!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: oh done|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *Might|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Back to only 500|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: oh! 300 back|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @cK, @d ruff and enjoy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The defence did all the hard work for declarer|pg||
pc|d3|nt|baldjean: 4 aces for North/South. almost sounds like the title of a Western :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nastepna sesja  zaczyna sie o 16:30   for our Polish viewers|pg||
nt|sybarra: will N get the ruff? |pg||
pc|d9|nt|othered1: Another auction where a trump lead looks pretty normal, and weste answered the call . . . |pg||
nt|h_karluk: defenders see the table, if E hekld A likely would cash|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|psridhar: cards do not lie well-but 4M plays a lot better than this hopeless 3nt slated to go down3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: *held|pg||
pc|s2|nt|janhamhurg: i must say i dont like the 4 spade bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still  Gawrys, Krzysztof Jassem, Apolinary Kowalsky, Szymanowski, Piotr Tuszynski saga in Polish Bridge,|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Disappointing that clubs not were mentioned in either room|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i try to give a piece of advice: play in your 8 card major fit, if you know you have one:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: remember to start with a top @h :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: one should bid but who case|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: i felt wants to use AK later for this ending|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not any better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But they have two|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Now he can't afford to ruff in his hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: even a pitch|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 spade is easy, by the way|pg||
pc|cT|nt|h_karluk: push next please :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes done|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: So instead of tossing a coin they went for notrump|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but this line was a very complicated one|pg||
pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: sorry, could draw trumps and concede a @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will no doubt survive because everything is so friendly|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl dummy, declarer in 4@s may be able to pull one trump, get rid of @d on @cs and ruff hand down, losing only 3 trumps|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s7|pc|c7|nt|janhamhurg: i think that is the single dummy line as well andy|pg||
nt|psridhar: a h loser cannot be avoided in 4s|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 1 heart 2 spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is more complex than that|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4s might hv ended down 1|pg||

nt|h_karluk: ouch, sorry for  caps lock, my bad|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|Walddk2: Not sure what he would do if he got a 2@S response. Maybe 2NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless 2@C is Puppet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Gawrys also partner of Lesniewski |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: a 2 heart bid shows 11 +, 2 spade minimum|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: pass now would show "touch"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if you would like to see convention cards of Polish pros check this please : |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C is the best part score, but as usual clubs are lost|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://bridgefiles.net/VAR2/Vugraph/Vugraph-Poland.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Here we have it   2@D  any 18+|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharkey: Cheap penalty card - only 1 or 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing much has changed here. Cichocki would also have bid if Henclik had passed 1NT|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: well judged|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 6@c...:(|pg||
nt|hedyg: okok i am ambitious!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C can actually be defeated, but it takes a double dummy defence|pg||
nt|andyv:  whatever the case, 4@s certainly would have been a superior contract|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sharkey: :) - @S9 and @S10 makes the difference...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c opening is usually reserved to show a limited hand with long clubs and possibly 4-card major, similar to Precision 2@copening|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: E said: 4441 without @D or 5440 w/o @D|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so the polish handgenerator serves us a lot of highly interesting games-|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I suspect 1@H shows spades and that 4@H is a splinter for spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: rt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's pretty common to play transfer responses after a take-out double|pg||
mb|p|nt|jutek: prawdopodobnie po wiscie kierowym 11 lew|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes old business|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: anf og course 4 spades denying any slam interest|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: discarding a dia is ok here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fast arrival|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well can ruff and pull @s A|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Slawek HENCLIK was partner of Boguslaw GIERULSKI between 97-99|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: 6 NT as well|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so now he will make 5 easily|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Hey Ed, good to see you|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 6NT seems to make too without the @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|baldjean: 4@s is a bit too high|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NS did well to push EW one level higher|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: They would have done even better if Wejknis had led a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@d response  relay, forcing to 3@c. Opener shows a 4-card suit (3@d shows extras) or makes a choice between 2NT and 3@c with long clubs.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but we see, now he would be able to pitch 2nd @d loser to established @h K|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if they find it i won't get surprised|pg||
nt|psridhar: Hamman's rule obeyed !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Over a 1@D response it is even stronger than that I think. 20+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: game-forcing I am told, 23 or more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: starting with 1 club can be an unlimited hand, i believe after 1 dia response 2 dia is gameforcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will produce the 9th trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  and give S time to set up @hs|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|janhamhurg: or at least 4 after this dia play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I will be, cos they are not in 3@C|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 spades is a nice contract doomed by the 5-1 split|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean you know they are card sharks|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which I think is mandatory on this auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I suppose he can make this if he did not get a heart back|pg||
nt|psridhar: with spds 3-3 , 12 tricks|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: since spades are 3-3 no problem anyway|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: That is very impressive by Skrz!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he can't because he must play a spade honour when overruffed|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: agree, heart was nessesary to prevent a low spade from table|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: We had that theme before|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When Nowosadzki did|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1: Preferably the high one, but that isn't easy to find|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am afraid i must go now :( ty all and enjoy!|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like it... 3N right sided|pg||
pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: and low @s to A|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: People do not lead trumps often enough in my opinion|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes, ace and another|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: I agree, especially on an auction where you know you have the balance of power|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some have never led one in their lives|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe thehy recognize it as passive defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: way eleven|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: exactly- a rare bird comes as a couple|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|othered1: But it is a very popular lead among the great Italian players|pg||
pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: I guess Boguslaw would never stop his inventions, each year hard to reach it as a VG commentator remember him since 2007|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: 2@h/2@s response to 2@c not forcing, good 5-card suit (711 HCP)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: just ten, if he ducks the king of spades|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: i don't believe|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: see- now makes|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, another heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North must come to 2 tricks|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so after all -1, an exiting 3 imp gain|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: On his way down now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just play a red card|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|h_karluk: nice seven cards ending, good sample for bright defense|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: interchange @s 6 with @s 7 :)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|sybarra: cash the club and history for declarer |pg||
pc|h6|pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: N-S won a major championship in USA a couple of years ago. Can't remember which. I am sure a spectator will tell me|pg||
pc|hT|nt|irwinbo: nice defense|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|janhamhurg: thats pretty surprising, bad play after the ace of spades, not often seen in Poland|pg||
pc|d6|nt|h_karluk: off one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: after 1 cl opener and a positive answer of 1 heart or 1 spade, 2 dia is 18+ and asking|pg||

nt|Walddk2: "Whenever the auction calls for a trump lead, lead one, regardless of holding, even from Kx or Qxx"|pg||
mb|4H|nt|othered1: Two boards in a row with 1-level contract in one room and game bid in the other.  Price EW paid for the lightish opening 2@C|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|othered1: Here, too, declarer likely will take his 9 tricks, but running @D may make play for an overtrick possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has the 10, or the 8 is a singleton|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1 NT 1517 HCP, 2@s response  transfer for clubs. Opener may choose between a positive 2NT, and a negative 3@c. Responder may continue by showing shortage.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mahy shoot the moon now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he did not lead @C8 with his left hand, so it's not a singleton|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *may|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Do you all play that convention?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The 2C opening generally promises fewer than four diamonds, but with a concentrated xx46 or xx47 2C will often be a better tactical call.|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: the 2 dia is part of multilandy|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 1@S m ight be an Animal Blue Team opening.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting point abt their sys : 1N> 2Transfer to hearts (2@d) does not deny five spades. Responders new suit at the 3-level forces to game. Also: 1NT - 2@d; 2@h - 2@s forces to ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@h (8+ HCP)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: a pleasure as always|pg||

mb|4C|nt|janhamhurg: 5  cl would be a wonderfull hit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: If @D were 3-1 this would make so EW unlucky here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jean|pg||
mb|4D|nt|baldjean: interesting lead; I would not have done that|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2hearts-h+min|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am pretty sure the best way to improve is just hire a pro and study the lessons|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 1@h/1@s openings in general 5 cards, 1217 HCP, 1NT response NF|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told 1@S showed: 10-14 unbalanced with 4+ @S or 10-11 5332|pg||
nt|othered1: And majors are opened in preference to a longer minor.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be a style, ie different approaches depends vulnerability|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm also told that west is a system inventor and that this is his new system.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: each year Bogo is on VG|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|baldjean: Hello all.|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Jean|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks to go -1 now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 30 is the last board of the match and session. Restart at 16:30 local time, in 2½ hours|pg||
nt|baldjean: @c switch necessary now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: redouble = bid your major|pg||
nt|h_karluk: In Polish club, 1@c opening bid is forcing for one round but it does not necessarily show a strong hand, in most versions of this system it shows either a weak balanced hand (about ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 12-14HCP), natural 1@c opening or any strong hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On behalf of BBO, Slawek Latala has been instrumental in setting up a fine show. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|irwinbo: again well done and right sided|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play resumes tomorrow at 10:00 local time|pg||

nt|baldjean: I'm sure it does with them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If spades are 3-2, you can't go down. Rise with the ace and pull trumps. Then @HA and 10|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: easy defence-for us! cash 3 cl and play a spade-  -2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@d response has three meanings : |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 12 or 13 depends on the lead- 13 now|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3 more rounds of Swiss before the top 8 advance to the quarter-finals|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: pass would show diamonds if they double a Multi, bid = own suit|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: the 4 is positive|pg||

mb|5N|an|no  trump Q|nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda10.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1. 1.negative: 08 HCP. In the 78 HCP range, Responder should not have a 4-card major (the response of one of a major is 7+HCP, the 1NT response is 911 HCP).|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Thanks to all spectators for watching|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 5 spade the queen ask i thk|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5S=we hv all keys, do u hv the trump queen?|pg||
mb|6H|nt|janhamhurg: count would be the 5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: tho i play A att K count|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: unfortunate split for declarer in this one|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is going to get real messy (Potentially) |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2.911 unbalanced; either both minors (5-4), or one poor minor. (The hand does not qualify for any of the responses: 1NT, 2 in a minor, 3 in a minor).|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: In any case, 2@C wouldn't be my choice of contracts.  But Ew areNV so it won't be disasterous.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no offense intended, in USA std nick for such nice players is "mad scientist" :)|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: 1 dia shows 5 dia(or good 4) remember they are juniors|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: A 6@D that never will be bid...|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N and 4@H are good spots, but west has to put the brakes on.  @SA position, howeer, will let them play at the 5-level|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ultra light overcall at 2nd seat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do they play Dwururka?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes , Pazur's sys|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess so|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i respect, for sure they are experienced and have ideas|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: west might try for a slam|pg||
nt|psridhar: the descriptive value ( describes 10 cards ! )  sways in favor of 2h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can understand that you bar a 2-opening where no suit is known (Wilkosz 2@D), but as soon as one is known I can't see the problem. If you know *both* suits (like both majors), ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the problem is non-existent|pg||
mb|4C|nt|h_karluk: I think Pazur's sys named as Dwururka, after Winning Polish open trial for 08 EC might update|pg||
mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: x+ 1no= stronger than direct 1 no- so 19-20|pg||
mb|4D|nt|othered1: dEclarer on last hand pitched the wrong suit -- @D on @HK, @H ruff, then @S ruff with dummy's last trump would have worked|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: or 6@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: Also  we thank Slwaek Lataia,  the organizer of this tourney.  Much appreciated by all BBO vugraph fans! |pg||
nt|othered1: How do you play 4N?  If control asking, why not immediately?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but i am afraid he changes it too much |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a new system I am told|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 cl is key card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure anyone in the ACBL can convince me|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 dia  1|pg||
nt|andyv:  does W have enough opp a typical 2@h opener to continue?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sybarra: thx spec,  love the insight and comments |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in 07 1@H was = 4+C, 11+, various shapes, no 4M unless 17+ with 5+C :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: back in about 2 1/2 hours |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The system is named Nail|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's true, seems latest update there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wow, cool name|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pazur is a system freak|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@h 5 cm 12-17|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: W: 18-20|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: thats a very lucky game with 24 points only, well done in closed room, so the gap will widen up|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sth funny here!|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: agreed, in USA we call such nice personalities as mad scientist :)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: one of the Pazur's sys card here : http://www.archiviobridge.it/Pazur-Zawislak.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 3@c instead of 2nt resulted in 3nt on W and a @h lead from N - and down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure why Gierulski chose his weaker minor|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: Exactly. Then 2@S was waste of time|pg||
nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as passed hand i prefer 11 points for any action <including take out double>|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: if 4 cl is BW 4 dia is the wrong answer, if 4 cl ask for cue bid, 4 dia is  a conrol|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: maybe tried to leave space for partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe hoping that partner had more there than in diamonds|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed, half an hour later than scheduled on our vugraph page|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: Not sure 6@S makes...|pg||
nt|othered1: Lots and lots of cue-bids, but this isn't a very elegant contract.  Wonder if either North or South thought partner had a first round control, particularly the second @H bid by ...|pg||
nt|othered1: north (if 4@C was natural)|pg||
nt|ritong: for south, sounded like north had @h void, i guess|pg||

nt|h_karluk: and thanks all, esp Marcin, i know long day there for you :) another nice biz|pg||

nt|h_karluk: the big picture appeared 90 %|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then it's a little pessimistic by West to just sign off|pg||
nt|andyv:  then why didn't W bid 4@s?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Thanks all and bye for now|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: We will shut down and return shortly after they have made the pairings for the next round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's Swiss format now, 1st against 2nd, 3rd vs 4th, and so on|pg||
nt|othered1: are replays allowed?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Teams can't meet any other team twice in Swiss|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They can if the format is Danish (Monrad)|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  A Monrad format pairs winners vs. winners and losers vs. losers. The better known name "Swiss" system  |pg||
nt|baldjean: That's like the difference between Swiss and Danish cheese.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: J.H. Monrad, a Danish engineer, devised the movement in 1928, but for the Chess Olympics|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It was adopted by bridge soon afterwards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Monrad is a variation of Swiss format, but the Swiss system has rather specific rules for pairings|pg||
nt|othered1: Out here in rural Pennsylvania (the state with the largest rural population), Swiss is exotic enough and I hadn't heard of Danish until recently on BBO.   It's just Swiss with ...|pg||
nt|othered1: replays allowed (especially on the last round.)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another way of putting it, yes, but Monrad came first|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ie qualifier -- Results from a number of monrad rounds determine qualifier placement in the next phase, usually a cup format (either knockout or with consolation).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Danish is this context is not a pastry|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: it was the last deal of this round. We will continue in a few minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think the Americans use Danish for all of it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sometimes the final is progressive, meaning that losers will also "devance" to consolation.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operators need to reload and will shut down|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Americans mostly like k/o teams in Regionals, in Sectionals they like Swiss teams -- but in general both in the flyer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: zip k/o "loose and snooze" format another fun of Regionals:)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did he not just bid 5@C over 3 then?|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|andyv:  probably to drive the commentators crazy.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so how they call that convention 2 hearts- i have votes for tartan and muilderberg|pg||
