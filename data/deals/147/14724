mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: they probably won't reach 6@S - even relay precision methods aren't usually geared to finding a 4-2 fit at the 6-level  |pg||

nt|andyv:  as a spec points out, perhaps E should have described his 6 bagger in @ds instead of the 2N inquiry, but I don't know if that's a problem for them in their relay system.|pg||

nt|bridge_one: always with smile !|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D after passed hand - i agree|pg||
nt|haans: me 2 but will EW find spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems normal yes|pg||
mb|2C|nt|haans: one wonder what Naesten Juniors had deceided |pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 3nt to start with|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 5@C looks likely which should be ok|pg||
nt|haans: weak nT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 6 @C West prefere to play @C (also because the hand is weak)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|haans: nothing|pg||
nt|jcwla: A potential swing board here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|roswolf: n/s use the weak nt it seems|pg||
nt|sharkey: weak NT...|pg||
nt|haans: popular im Denmark have i been told|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: should end up in 21S|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: appears South lucked out with 2@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: YUP|pg||
nt|sharkey: finding pd with 4 card fit|pg||
nt|haans: money on 2nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: my pd usually has two cards in the suit...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Both partnerships play nat 5-card MI best MI  (11)12-14|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Both pairs play natural 5MA best MI   (11)12-14NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i suppose 3nt is possible too if east bids|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by East is natural strong hand|pg||
nt|haans: East bidding 2@S im sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: usual light opener misfit hand overboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Bridgeministeriet means The Ministery of Bridge. The minister himself is the Danish national team player Gregers Bjarnasson, who do not play. But he is happy with his team and sent ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yesterday a sms after his boys won the semifinal. You declared and defended very well the minister wrote. Normally nice words like these do not come out of his mouth. |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|haans: accept that bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: i will also:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: thx for the info peter|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for just 2|pg||
nt|sharkey: Problem here may be E is "too strong" - has to do it all himself|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry Hans|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzpb: 5 Ma oc|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: So 2NT is as yoy see15-17 |pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: I ssume that north did not come in with 2@s as shown|pg||
nt|lestergold: it must have been East's rebid|pg||
nt|haans: yep but no hard done|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D had been possible|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the rule here is to bid for new suit only with interesting hand - perfect 3@C (and not DBL, by West) - only finding a interesting hand in West became usefull to bid the @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probablyh 4@D by North would work better, but not in this layout (4@s the same)|pg||
nt|haans: other rules if MP:)|pg||
nt|haans: but most slams in m stay in 3nt|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|vugraphzpb: sry 2s in east of corse|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if declarer found first round finesse of ten hearts its off|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: correct way to play against Q10xx in South|pg||
nt|haans: playing safe|pg||
nt|lestergold: no harm done by operator only harm done by e/w|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have played 4 rounds of spades ending in dummy|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|c3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s5|pc|c4|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: my book east didnt have an opener|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sharkey: agree Geoff - need help here - make them start discarding -|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D better bid than 2@D by W|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S better than "@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: very much so|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: Lars Moller is a very experienced player in the International field. Tenerife 2005 , Jesolo 2007, Beijing 2008 and Brasov 2009. Represented his country in Juniors category.|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|sharkey: i think most of us wud have ended up in game on this hand - likely to be duplicated OR I think|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h3|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|c5|nt|ralfwil: It´s always difficult to bid a minor slam on 6-2 and with max 30points|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|haans: good dicard by N = not hearts|pg||
nt|sharkey: N denies @HA|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they had a chance here to stay low|pg||
nt|sharkey: hard to stay low with East's power house|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but west has screamed weakness with 2@D|pg||
nt|haans: here weak nt was the winner|pg||

nt|andyv:  ok|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|r|nt|mdgraham: not sure if that is the case here, obviously|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree, David...not a great slam but to not even sniff it out seems conservative|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think the slam is a decent proposition. they might well lead a suit that resolves the guess for you|pg||

nt|ady: with the 3-3 spade break declarer can afford the safety play of K@C   and club to the ace and be rewarded with an overtrick|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzpa: with @h ace shown in N... then @c Q must be in S for the DBL ..or?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||

nt|haans: soon will bidding start at 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w need to be a little careful here|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i was born in the 19th century|pg||
nt|haans: openings nowdays are light|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Konow-Hagen play releay precision  system card here http://www2.bridge.dk/Default.aspx?ID=375|pg||
nt|lestergold: light is ok that was featherlight bad hand bad suit not my idea|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: slam possible here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|roswolf: and may well make it|pg||
nt|haans: will try clubs before spades so slam a make|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm an aggressive opening ny east|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyone X the 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: precisely|pg||
nt|roswolf: west should now recognise the duplication in the red suits|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S suprise|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad tencount not mandatory even today|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: this is the first of two segments in the semi final - total of 24 boards|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D gf|pg||
nt|roswolf: artificial gf i think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 points but A A and the Q in the long suit - today many pair open with that cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 4@S LOOKS MORE CHALLENGING|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: X=Inviting to game in H or better|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D here lighter|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Jepsen-Sørensen play nat 5 card MA best mi (11)12-14 NT|pg||
nt|haans: but precision need not 11-15 anymore|pg||
nt|lestergold: well lets see where this opener gets them|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: artificial|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|haans: accept x  if non vul|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: well it looks like south may be allowed to catch up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 3@s instead dbl by west would be possible|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here the problem is to call 4@H giving the idea to make a overbid :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzpb: 2D=GF check back|pg||
nt|sharkey: common to play 2@C as invitational - also in Denmark I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Peter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: otherwise too easy the defence at 4@S|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|lestergold: might scrape this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: His partner Emil Jepsen in same frequency. Prague 2004 Denmark Schools team,  Tenerife 2005, Riccione 2005, Jesolo 2007, Beijing 2008, Brasov 2009 with Denmark Juniors team. That's ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: supposed to be a good partnership.|pg||
nt|haans: Q8 in clubs looks like three :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|roswolf: east's hand is good for cuebidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but a slow bid may produce an ethical problem for his pard - this is fine though|pg||
nt|haans: only thing wrong with that is no make :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably a misunderstand by E/W - West think to find only 3@h in East|pg||
nt|lestergold: theoretically 2 dims club and spade to lose|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: as is west's|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed the wrong game|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: 5@D made with a endplay|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: but the club force will make this hard to handle|pg||
nt|lestergold: note tjhat here the tens and nines are working!|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|roswolf: i fancy 6@D will be the final contract|pg||
nt|haans: many have no good bids after strong nt opening|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|bridge_one: would need the lead @C to beat|pg||

pc|d4|nt|lestergold: evening in Denmark?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

nt|andyv:  5@d may gain 3 imps|pg||
nt|ady: would look silly if A@s was onside and 3NT makes|pg||

nt|andyv:  3N is the most practical|pg||

nt|mdgraham: won't be easy...North will win the spade and might play clubs|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in which case East might figure that West needs either @SQ or @hA to beat this|pg||
nt|andyv:  I have parteners who like to see if I can make one more too.|pg||
nt|andyv:  N has to guess now to play @cs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry for silly remark above. i was multi-tasking and has spade ten and jack interchanged|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and from East's point of view, he might not be able to afford to duck the club |pg||
nt|ady: how can west have Q@S   would have surely played it at trick 1|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: spec thinks N should bid only 2N. perhaps so, but 3N puts more pressure on opps and is less revealing|pg||

mb|1D|nt|lestergold: well i think east'shand may qualify for an opener even by my standards|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now e/w need a certain convention called blackwood to avois another plausible slam|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Unsound bidding by North I think it's fair to say|pg||
nt|andyv:  ah, my type of bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think N realizes that they are way behind... only reason for that bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: Østergaard did not alert 3@c ... and I guess he might have taken it for a @c suit inviting to 3nt .... I am sure Mads meant it to be something else|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: But as you might know .... NS is not a regular partnership !|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the last few boards have all gone wrong :(|pg||
nt|ady: Q@D  instead of Q@S   then good contract      even J@D  would give play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all the more reason to keep methods simple|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6N would be cold if E had the diamond length|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: I guess Østergaard might move it to 6nt ...... but he takes his time before deciding what to do.|pg||

nt|shevek: a spec says" change N and S and 3NT is laydown"|pg||
nt|shevek: let's be fair this is not an atrocious contract to bid|pg||

nt|jcwla: Well, too often the option will be green in color.|pg||

nt|andyv:  @s vs. @d battle|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: 39 and 40 first, followed by comparisons from the other room when we roll over to board 21|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  S hand looks perfect for support dbl or take out|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S  with 3 card support   does 1@S response show 5+ cards?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They don't play support doubles|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: NS does not play support dbl |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S would be an unpopular choice in western hemisphere|pg||
nt|andyv:  so dbl is strictly penalty for them or takeout there?|pg||
nt|ady: may well work well here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wonder what D would be...penalty io presume|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: No, 1@S dooes not promise five cards, but it often is when you don't play Walsh and bid 4-card suits up the line|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes esp after 1C|pg||
nt|andyv:  auction sounded like it called for trump leads|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  1@S    only 4 if responder is 4333   or   4(32)4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s8|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|andyv:  favorable location of @h suit should make this easy|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|ady: spade return now    there are problems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think a trump lead is clearly indicated. NS might have nine spades, Ds might be 22, the spade ten might be a potential trick, etc. Club 8 is a tempting possibility|pg||
nt|andyv:  not really...N can afford to lose either 2@s and @d or 2@d and @s... I think he has to assume @h hook is on.|pg||
nt|ady: have to overtake spade queen  |pg||
