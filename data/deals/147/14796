mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: I would hazard a guess that your wife gave them a hard time :)|pg||
nt|nickf: could easily have gone 4H P P X from East|pg||
mb|1N|nt|babs59: then 4S or 5C and NS took a phantom|pg||
mb|2C|nt|nickf: An other hand for the philosophers - what to open the West cards?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nickf: N should make a t/o X now|pg||
nt|nickf: if X is takeout of course|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|babs59: of course, she might expect more values with West and fewer with South.  South is near max for balancing 1NT|pg||

nt|nickf: in 4H next door|pg||

nt|babs59: and hoping West has more to say!|pg||
nt|nickf: in 3NT in the other room|pg||
nt|nickf: I wouldnt have thought West has much to think about here|pg||
nt|babs59: I thought you'd run away because you couldn't stand the suspense of this hand|pg||
nt|babs59: you were just checking the other room's contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: and why didnt East double 2NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: I assumed you'd help me out there with your wife's defence to the 2NT bid|pg||
nt|babs59: I thought she must be lurking |pg||
pc|h6|nt|nickf: this hand will take 10 mins to play|pg||
nt|babs59: I guess she didn't want to encourage Kim Neale to bid?|pg||
nt|babs59: only 10|pg||
nt|nickf: well it warrants more|pg||
nt|babs59: one New Zealand opponent once took 25 minutes to play to trick 1 against me|pg||
nt|babs59: then played the wrong card|pg||
nt|babs59: so trick 2 only took 10 minutes|pg||
nt|nickf: needs to win T1 with the Ace|pg||
pc|h2|nt|babs59: the only way I could stay awake was to watch the clock - the analysing had been done in the first 5 minutes|pg||
nt|babs59: I just got asked the best question by a kib...|pg||
nt|nickf: your phone number?|pg||
nt|babs59: no - are you John Gill's sister?|pg||
nt|nickf: ha!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nickf: priceless|pg||
nt|babs59: soon it'll be - are you Lauren's mother?|pg||

nt|babs59: I suspect the club lead in the other room made life a bit tougher|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|s8|pc|hT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|nickf: needs to claim rather than play to be 100% safe|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|nickf: I'd be putting that one in the memory bank for tomorrow|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|babs59: I remember doing so against some opponents in a Semi Final of the National Women's Teams - and it happened again about 6 hands later for 1400 :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|beauch:  i hope i make a few of those this week in Hobart|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|babs59: Nick made a special trip to Tasmania to help train the VG team for this event.|pg||
nt|beauch:  pele rankin south usually in tune with north, but expect she is not 2 fond of her pds bids on this and previous hand|pg||
nt|babs59: Those who play tourneys on BBO - Maude1338 is the organiser of this VG in Tasmania|pg||
mb|2H|nt|nickf: I think Rankin wants to pass 2D|pg||
mb|p|nt|beauch:  maybe i am old but a 2Nt opener to me shows 20plus balanced :)|pg||
nt|nickf: but 2D shows 6+ either major|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|beauch:  wow 3h - just what south wanted to hear!|pg||
nt|babs59: at least the 2NT opening bid got you (David) to come out of hiding and do some commentary|pg||
nt|nickf: might go down on a trump lead|pg||
nt|nickf: but Neale will lead a club probably|pg||
nt|babs59: perhaps North overlooked that South was a passed hand too|pg||
pc|d8|nt|beauch:  i only play 2NT for minors at gunpoint|pg||

mb|p|nt|babs59: This looks like 6C makes for EW, so perhaps 4HX was a good save|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|babs59: what do you think of passing 3H?|pg||
nt|nickf: 9 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|babs59: sure Nick, and 12 in clubs|pg||
nt|mamos:  East may fear double shows Spades but I think should just be values|pg||
nt|babs59: not necessarily I guess - I was giving North the HA lead - or West a heart - sorry|pg||
nt|babs59: I overlooked the @H void :(|pg||

nt|nickf: NV, its a fast pass|pg||
nt|babs59: of course all our Acol players love to over-value their 8 counts|pg||
mb|2N|nt|babs59: let's see what Linda does|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: oh Nick - you do need to re-train her :)|pg||
nt|beauch:  wow see what you mean|pg||
mb|3N|nt|beauch:  thats a kiddies bid with that beautiful shape :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: one problem in Australia is that most people rebid 1NT with 15-18 which is simply too wide-range|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: still arent there 9 tricks taking the nexessary H finesse?|pg||
nt|babs59: how do you get to dummy twice Nick?|pg||
nt|nickf: ah|pg||
nt|babs59: once for the finesse and once to cash the long heart?|pg||
nt|beauch:  i reckon east has an auto pass of 1NT- hate raise to 2Nt with a passion!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|babs59: oh there's a way :)|pg||
nt|nickf: i believe it but I dont see it|pg||
nt|beauch:  now its gin!|pg||
nt|babs59: North thinks "East didn't use Stayman"|pg||
nt|babs59: hence:  lead a major|pg||
nt|nickf: its not gin... need to play spades right|pg||
pc|h2|nt|beauch:  ill bet on 9 tricks now - |pg||
nt|nickf: I wont lay|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|babs59: I've learnt not to predict when doing commentary|pg||

pc|hK|nt|beauch:  therese - will be hating her lead now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s8|nt|nickf: once hearts are cleared isnt it certain North doesnt have 4 spades?|pg||
nt|babs59: I have some sympathy for her lead though - a major certainly has more appeal than a minor|pg||
nt|babs59: once North has 3 hearts it is possible that she only had 2 spades to choose that lead|pg||
nt|beauch:  my pommie mate would say auto 4th best|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nickf: spade pitch is the end|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|babs59: my daughter would never lead a @D from North - her captain of her Australian U21 team says NEVER lead from Axxx v. NT contraccts|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|babs59: and so far, for her, it's paid huge dividends|pg||

nt|tez: so pass is ok for me|pg||
mb|2C|nt|tez: nonevulln|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|babs59: 5D failed in the other room when North failed to establish the club suit before tackling the trumps|pg||
nt|babs59: hence she lost control when the trumps were 4-1|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|babs59: however, I believe if you first lead the @DA then finesse the clubs, 5@D should make|pg||
nt|babs59: South's 2@s bid was just GF - either agreeing a minor or looking for 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: board 8  the possible double game swing hand (though EW went -1 in 4H) was the swing, with NS making 4S|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: well the response is DKC, but I wouldn't bank on South's 4D being that for sure on this auction|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes my parts and i agree to pass all 4333 eight counts opposite 15-17 (or almost all :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|babs59: so this hand is a potential big gain for NSW, if played correctly|pg||
nt|babs59: and our last hand of this set too|pg||
nt|nickf: I'd be bidding 6D now|pg||
nt|babs59: thanks Mike and Nick - and what time do we re-start?|pg||
nt|nickf: oh sorry 4D was KC|pg||
nt|nickf: let me check|pg||
nt|mamos:  are NS on same page?|pg||
nt|babs59: this doesn't strike me as a 4D key card auction though?|pg||
nt|nickf: in 25 mins|pg||
nt|nickf: aah double keycard|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tez: 2 alone jack|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|davidstern: East took a rosey view of her hand bidding 1@S and 2@C and after forced preference trying 3@C|pg||
nt|davidstern: In the CR|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|beauch:  not as rosy as our east here|pg||
nt|nickf: 3C is an overbid imo|pg||
nt|nickf: no|pg||
nt|beauch:  yes but when on a roll!|pg||
nt|davidstern: I hate 3@C such soft values (but don't tell Linda|pg||
nt|beauch:  me 2 !|pg||
nt|nickf: 3N has no chance|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|beauch:  4@S looks gin|pg||
nt|beauch:  lol|pg||
nt|nickf: well it certainly looks gin double dummy|pg||
nt|babs59: isn't 3C game forcing then?|pg||
nt|nickf: but I think she got an attack of the guilts|pg||
nt|nickf: cos 3C should be game forcing|pg||
nt|beauch:  a jump shift f.g. and then pass?|pg||
nt|babs59: however Neale is a passed hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|davidstern: East obviously realised she had overbid so pulled back|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|davidstern: And well done|pg||
nt|nickf: Passing 3@S = I am sorry about 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe she took the 3@C by mistake, should have been 2|pg||
nt|beauch:  seems like a contradiction!!|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|davidstern: Roland obviously hasnt met Linda - 3@C was meant to be 3@C|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s7|nt|nickf: yup|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|babs59: anyhow, I prefer the Closed Room rosy view of hand to the 3C bid here|pg||
nt|Walddk3: OK then, and it's game-forcing?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|davidstern: Not any more|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|babs59: she'll wish it was shortly|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@S does have a very negative ring about it|pg||
nt|beauch:  they will still be talking to each other tomorrow- but made me laugh!|pg||
nt|babs59: however 1@S could have been a 4 card suit, couldn't it Nick?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: It's like being semi-pregnant (they tell me). Either it's game-forcing or it is not|pg||
nt|davidstern: Knows West likely has doubleton spade as with weak hand may have supported with three initially|pg||
nt|davidstern: On even days isn't GF and on odd days it is|pg||
nt|babs59: Roland objects to 1NT being described as 'semi forcing'|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|babs59: either forcing or not forcing, right?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: of course|pg||
nt|nickf: no I dont think 1S can ever be 4|pg||
mc|9|nt|nickf: that would be a 1C opener|pg||
nt|babs59: though surely it's way up the ladder of sins ahead of that F word?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: yes|pg||
nt|nickf: see you back here in 11.5 hrs|pg||

nt|mamos:  Well odd defence IMHO  |pg||
nt|mamos:  last hand of the set     fantastic run for NSW|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oliverc: EW could get too high here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|nickf: A good hand for the 1NT with a 5 card Major discussion|pg||
nt|nickf: EW play 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|babs59: now she's left herself with a 'tricky' rebid problem then|pg||
mb|1N|nt|nickf: yep|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|mamos:  EW i prefer 1NT if 15-17|pg||
nt|babs59: so now East has to bid 2NT|pg||
nt|nickf: still fixed|pg||
mb|2S|nt|babs59: which is an overbid|pg||
nt|babs59: but she created her own problem|pg||
nt|nickf: 2NT is horrible opposite a non fitting 6 count|pg||
nt|mamos:  difficult rebid for East|pg||
nt|mamos:  2.5 @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: sound bidding here|pg||
nt|babs59: agree - that's why she created the problem not opening 1NT |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|mamos:  and so is unhappy to pass 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: still, 3NT looks a struggle|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos:  cards lie well for EW|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|oliverc: 3NT a bridge too far|pg||
