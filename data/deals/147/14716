nt|h_karluk: would any bid anything except 2N? ie 2@s or 3@d by S?|pg||
nt|haans: i prefer 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not an easy rebid for SÃ¸rensen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not suited for 2NT, 3@D is an overbid, and 2@S with 5 lousy is not appealing either|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: not happy to put that hand down|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcwla: 2NT on a void not my preference, as Mike Lawrence says, if you cannot rebid 2@S on such hands as a default bid, you will have to make some truly ugly bids.|pg||

pc|h4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes , a vumate prefers 1@d and described it as "foresight problems"|pg||
mc|12|nt|Walddk2: You can't be serious, opening 1@D with 5-5|pg||
nt|haans: seeing spades as 4 carder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner's don't respond 2@H every time|pg||
nt|jcwla: You will never convince partner this is your hand; also, the @S's are not bad in combination with a slight catch from pd.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So use 2@S as a default rebid|pg||
nt|haans: some play that 2@S is a spades rebid :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: I'm with Roland, however, it is tougher when your system makes you worry about three or four other things just so you can miss a vulnerable game.|pg||
nt|haans: that was a common problem with precision|pg||

mc|7|nt|Walddk2: I think pass followed by 2@C shows clubs and a major. 2@D would ask for the major|pg||
