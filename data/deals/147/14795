nt|mdgraham: looks like EW are playing some kind of strong club system |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Wu-Peake playing Strong Club|pg||
mb|2H|nt|garnetts: EW can make 3@H but NS saved over 4@H |pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: hmm another judgment hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: did well to get out for one off too|pg||
nt|sybarra: and real action to start |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Any questions, let me know:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: Thanks John|pg||

nt|mdgraham: what are next Saturday's winning lottery numbers? |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  3 @D looks fine as did 3 @H E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3C a very questionable action in 2nd seat with a likely running suit, unless of course partner expects this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quiet hand to start with|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Mike|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: I think a lot of folks would bid 3 @C  rightly or wrongly  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparentl every E at this table would:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6H also doubtful -- S has a lot of losers and reasonable defense, though not enough to be happy if opps go on to 6S as there may be freakish distribution|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: hi there; sorry, but they started early|pg||
mc|11|nt|mdgraham: not so sure about 2@d though - but South sure bought a fit |pg||

nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|psridhar: oh the Frocing Pass system here for EW?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I believe so|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D likely 0-7|pg||
mb|3D|an|Alerted|nt|psridhar: 3D possibly fit bid =red 2 suits|pg||

pc|cA|nt|psridhar: ok|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|kiwibridge: are we stuck now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think Lazer is thinking about winning the ace|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Lazer in the tank...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@H other room so they just need to make this for another good plus|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Summary of the EW system:  Pass=13+, 1D=8-12 4H, 1H=S, 1H= one minor or both minors, 1S=0-8|pg||
nt|psridhar: other room missed game when S decided to 'wait' with such a good hand|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: NSW vs WA|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: though a low diamond would probably beat 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: if he has time to pitch the @H |pg||
nt|marlowepi: six spades i mean of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an aggressive North might double 2@S, but here, vulnerable against not and with a passed partner - no thanks|pg||
nt|ady: needs to avoid losing 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|april7: S might reach here a @H contract going down without a @S lead losing 1@H 1@C and 2 @S tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If 2@c showed a genuine suit, 3@C by East makes life more difficult |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sunsamvar: 4@H is a decent contract|pg||
nt|april7: I meant a 4@H contract, but now S is safe|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: N/S playing a Polish Club|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: E/W playing a Strong Club|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: Not in favour of this type of bidding --as mentioned previously I think this should show 5-4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but a low D lead misguessed would hurt his entry situation|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: N loves those clubs in dummy, temporarily|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: got that right    should just make|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|sybarra: he may lead it back and he did|pg||
nt|april7: S should have bid 2 @H first round of bidding,but better this way,fortunately for her|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: right but even a few moments' anxiety can help contribute to an accumulated psychological toll later|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||

mb|2N|an|6-11, 5+5+ Minors|mb|p|nt|ady: started ok    then fell by the wayside|pg||

nt|mdgraham: looks a normal lead though|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - thatÂ´s the problem|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: if N and E were partners it would be a cold grand slam in either minor :)|pg||
nt|april7: N might open 2NT for minors, otherwise E will reach a 3NT contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South may pass....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: on the basis that they have not been doubled yet|pg||
nt|april7: S will chose the igher card,@D|pg||

mb|3C|an|To Play|mb|3S|nt|april7: E 3NT and probably 7-8 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: If south opens  here and west gets involved they can concede a penalty |pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: the defence should prevail here|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is the upside of opening 11 counts --but this one is actually better than the last one I grumbled about |pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: has to guess trumps though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what are the percentages with two missing?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzkm: this is the last board of the tournament|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: thx all spectators for watching the last 5 days|pg||
nt|ady: thats true   may go down 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I certainly see no point in bidding 1@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: Fabulous job by Paul|pg||
nt|ady: just to play for 1-1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: something like 54-46 for doing one thing or the other|pg||
nt|ady: especially with opps silent|pg||
nt|april7: still 1 dion on @H lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Is there such a thing as a bad 21-count?|pg||
nt|april7: :):):)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: According to their system card there is...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzkm: Israel seems to have taken the lead now|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|garnetts: How else do you show 5-4?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And with this dummy, the ZIA-rule is not for use (If they doÂ´nt cover, they doÂ´nt have it)|pg||
nt|ady: if 4@H makes then n/s have a decetnt save in spade or diamonds|pg||
pc|s4|nt|garnetts: this is a really poor contract as a result of the opening bid and also the rebid |pg||
nt|garnetts: I was just looking --and David Greenwood got there first---the @D finesse will squeeze South |pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not that it makes 3NT a good contract |pg||
nt|ady: noone would cover with 5 trumps showing in dummy|pg||
nt|ady: noone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, I know a few|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 3 imps to WA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I once saw a pair with a bid described as 25-bad 28|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|garnetts: That j@S is an error as South can now throw them |pg||
nt|roswolf: i can only see 8 tricks |pg||
nt|garnetts: duck this and North will lead the 9@S lol|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
mc|11|nt|garnetts: same thing maybe but South can use a suit preference signal |pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe the 2@S |pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: S had the @s10 in hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: to suggest a club|pg||
nt|april7: its a rebid after 2@C opening|pg||
nt|april7: a bid of 3NT|pg||

mb|1D|an|Alerted|nt|kiwibridge: another "easy to beat" contract makes with ease...|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: if S knew lho has h suit and rho has a balanced hand he will certainly lead h ace|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2NT must be forcing|pg||
nt|jstnstrk: they can reverse the relay in a strong auction.  For relays that show the other suit (H=S), they can reverse the relays if they hold length too!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: as 1@S reached in the oother room a swing to someon|pg||
nt|jstnstrk: Paul and Warren include 11-13 balanced in thier 1D opening.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|psridhar: with 3 aces out and no long suit to run , 3nt is a doubtful starter|pg||
