mb|1N|nt|babs59: This looks like 6C makes for EW, so perhaps 4HX was a good save|pg||

mb|d!|an|spade|nt|tez: nonevulln|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|babs59: 5D failed in the other room when North failed to establish the club suit before tackling the trumps|pg||
nt|babs59: hence she lost control when the trumps were 4-1|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|babs59: however, I believe if you first lead the @DA then finesse the clubs, 5@D should make|pg||
nt|babs59: South's 2@s bid was just GF - either agreeing a minor or looking for 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|babs59: board 8  the possible double game swing hand (though EW went -1 in 4H) was the swing, with NS making 4S|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: well the response is DKC, but I wouldn't bank on South's 4D being that for sure on this auction|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes my parts and i agree to pass all 4333 eight counts opposite 15-17 (or almost all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: so this hand is a potential big gain for NSW, if played correctly|pg||
nt|babs59: and our last hand of this set too|pg||
nt|nickf: I'd be bidding 6D now|pg||
nt|babs59: thanks Mike and Nick - and what time do we re-start?|pg||
nt|nickf: oh sorry 4D was KC|pg||
nt|nickf: let me check|pg||
nt|mamos:  are NS on same page?|pg||
nt|babs59: this doesn't strike me as a 4D key card auction though?|pg||
nt|nickf: in 25 mins|pg||
nt|nickf: aah double keycard|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 2 alone jack|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|babs59: so North has shown 2 key cards and both queens|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|nickf: now its up to Ichilik to show the right technique|pg||
nt|mamos:  now she has to make|pg||

pc|hA|pg||

nt|nickf: need some system here|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|nickf: now Kalmin will need to act over 4H|pg||
nt|babs59: though the 2D was not alerted, it was a multi 2 - showing a weak 2 in hearts or spades (maybe a strong 2NT option)|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: thus 2S says Pass if 2S, correct if you have hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nickf: operator|pg||
nt|oliverc: that doesn't look right|pg||
nt|nickf: is this auction right?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|oliverc: I must confess, With the West hand I'd have been bidding 4@H rather than 3|pg||
nt|mamos:  home now|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|oliverc: Since 2@S normally shows game interest in @H|pg||
nt|babs59: I'd also be bidding 4H with East, at the very least to stop NS coming in easily|pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|oliverc: but they've got away with it  -  just need to take the right view in @H|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mamos:  well North South didnt fight back much|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|oliverc: potential for a big swing here, since it looks like 4@S will be making the other way|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|d3|nt|nickf: could be a double game swing|pg||

nt|babs59: I certainly hope they do, given that, with different partners, they are part of our Australian Women's team|pg||
nt|mamos:  lots of potential here|pg||
nt|babs59: (and I'm their captain)|pg||
nt|nickf: probably only an opening preempt from North will keep EW out of slam|pg||
nt|oliverc: 4NT, anyone?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|babs59: not me|pg||

nt|mamos:  Well odd defence IMHO  |pg||
nt|mamos:  last hand of the set     fantastic run for NSW|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|oliverc: EW could get too high here|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|nickf: A good hand for the 1NT with a 5 card Major discussion|pg||
nt|nickf: EW play 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|babs59: now she's left herself with a 'tricky' rebid problem then|pg||
mb|2N|nt|nickf: yep|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mamos:  EW i prefer 1NT if 15-17|pg||
nt|babs59: so now East has to bid 2NT|pg||
nt|nickf: still fixed|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: which is an overbid|pg||
nt|babs59: but she created her own problem|pg||
nt|nickf: 2NT is horrible opposite a non fitting 6 count|pg||
nt|mamos:  difficult rebid for East|pg||
nt|mamos:  2.5 @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: sound bidding here|pg||
nt|babs59: agree - that's why she created the problem not opening 1NT |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|mamos:  and so is unhappy to pass 2@S|pg||
