nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|henryb:  back to 17|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2S|nt|sybarra: this may be first ones to one nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Al Hollander|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: another set with the "fun" systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect a LOT of alerts for NS system   Forcing 1@C, Transfer Openers [aka submarine]|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|henryb:  A partscore battle, with N-S aboe to make 4@c and E-W 2@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: And this time, it's also probbaly the battle for 2ndplace as well|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I would expect the auction to start P-P-1@s-some bid showing @h& a minor |pg||
nt|henryb:  wrond again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=NF, ART, 8-11 HCP, 3@H  [maybe min, 4@H]|pg||
nt|sybarra: al,  are e/w playing precision? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shi-Hou are playing Precision -- i was just typing that Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: for those watching,  this will be a lot of artificial bidding,  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi everyone welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: hi|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: both pairs at other table also playing Precision variant|pg||
nt|sybarra: only used with experienced partnerships and 400 pages of system notes|pg||
nt|henryb:  The Australian pair clearly do not play strong club|pg||
nt|rodal f: N for the first take out.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ok maybe only 385 pages|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards -- and some supplementary notes - online under http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Open.aspx|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|sybarra: might N sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is he bidding  1 nt |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this seems rather high|pg||
nt|rodal f: Teyssier was cold:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: must say I am not a fan of sitting at imps|pg||
nt|jcwla: D/K if this is the dummy N is expecting, but it's not enough.  This is down a couple.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  clearly 1N was forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid's 2@D bid doesn't seem to fit the explanation I gave -- but i got if from their notes |pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|vugraphzkt: good morning all|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rv: Hi all, gm from sunny bangalore in South India|pg||
nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Good morning|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rv: Hi Rodal|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|janm: EW will probably end in 4@s on this one, and should make it unless NS get 2 club ruffs - I guess 5@c is actually better, let's see if West will show his club support to get there|pg||
nt|janm: This auction might get them to 3NT, which would not be a success|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Open Room starts play with board  29 -- so they will see results from us|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure who do bet on here,  defense if @H start I think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  the two-step probably shows constructive values|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mwigor: hi all|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like a save v 5@H|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: we can only peek at their [and any other vugraph table] using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|henryb:  We do not have an auction, but at the other table West over reached to 4@s and caught a vey bad dummy|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Hyper-agressive bidding by the NZ  north-south in the other room propelled the auction very high, very quick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6@d in the 4-3 fit looks OK to me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6NT you can make with the right guesses as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think by Tony|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|janm: Perhaps if W bid 3@c here, E might retreat to 5@c, but West decided his suit was good enough to play in, and with the @h A lead, he'll be right, I think|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this match is 1st China-Taipei vs 5th Japan|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|tejjyid: The auction looks a bit murky, Nunn calrifies it for us|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: ..and in the end they got the outcome they wanted (opps made the last mistake!)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a passive @S lead & East will be very happy|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tejjyid: Thanks for coming...|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|barnets: @DK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
pc|c4|nt|barnets: may have worked|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: likely 300 for NS -- i'd feel good bringing that score back to the table|pg||
nt|barnets: as if east had rufffed with the 9 dec would crash the spade honours|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|henryb:  Nasty breaks on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is the 1st of 12 matches for Round Robin  2 -- results aren't posted yet from RR1, but the rotation for RR2 is based upon final tally|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: 1nt had been a nice contract - but prob forcing - but even then I would have passed in S (pd is a passed hand)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|henryb:  I do not know why East wanted a club; a heart would have been more useful|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: results site is http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not much fun discarding from the N hand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: the Juniors are playing this in 4@CN|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: part score battles are worth a suprising number of imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Sorry was away from table :(  Will record a claim shortly|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6-8 for a double part score swing mounts up real quick|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: 13th @H might have worked well there|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|henryb:  this will drift down one, but slowly. As I have observed before, no one ever goed dowd wuickly|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|jcwla: The OR is starting with 29 and 30 so we'll feed them comparisons when they circle back to 17.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry fast play i may have missed something here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|janm: NS have a heart, a spade and a club and EW have 5 or 6 spades (depending whether N's spade trick is taken by a ruff or not), 3 diamonds and at least 2 clubs|pg||
mc|10|nt|kiwi_joker: dummy's diamonds an alluring target - but unreachable|pg||
pg||

nt|ahollan1: i should say if you RESPOND to 1@H|pg||
nt|geot: I@S, but really stuch if pd bids 2@D|pg||
nt|geot: stuck|pg||
nt|geot: I will pass 2@D in that case|pg||
nt|geot: But I would pass 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe    i was typing   "easiest to PASS"|pg||
nt|geot: yes:)....but if you bid on hands similar to this, I think bidding the major is the best. Might work even if partner bid 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but make @C2  @CK then it really is a problem|pg||

nt|geot: South tried 2@C at the other table, probably NF :).... but then North went to 4@H, naturally|pg||
nt|ritong: hi chaps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bon jour Henri|pg||
nt|geot: Hi Henri|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||

nt|frankaus: just 3 here|pg||
nt|sybarra: -1 not the end of the world here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: missed opportunity, but any plus may be good on that board|pg||
nt|barnets: would hav been a nice try|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi RV:) And welcome. Long time ago.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A easy 3NT?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-15 HCP, a) 5+@H  b) 4441@D |pg||
mb|d|nt|rv: this tourney is played in double round robin format with no subsequent play-offs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: feel free anyone to commentate|pg||
mb|1D!|an|5-7 h|nt|sybarra: can W stay in his seat |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes seems so |pg||
nt|sybarra: "stay in his seat" as in pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  6@h is a reasonable contract, needing 2-2 hearts or stiff queen|pg||
nt|henryb:  and no club ruff on lead|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Miller-Stout play precision.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It's irrational, but I bet Nunn & Hans feel a warm fuzzy feeling inside after the good start|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: wow  last hand Chinese Taipei Juniors 4@C made 5 |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: interesting choices for Shi over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N, trap pass, 3@C [@H raise], 2@D all seem to have merit|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe tryingn to get the @D suit in before the ht raise |pg||
nt|henryb:  with various conventions of their own, such as this 3@d bid to show a gf raise|pg||
mb|1S|nt|frankaus: green V red usually a go signal :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes thought he might come in  but suit is a bit tacky |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is we are in game force sequence here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and protecting against opener having the 4441@D hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Hou pulled out the 4 @s card then changed his mind|pg||
nt|tejjyid: BTW, anyone who wants to jump in and advise me I'm an idiot, do feel free|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
nt|jcwla: N's negative double showed the minors.  Now you see the problems with 2@S:|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jcwla: One, it gives the opponents two levels of room; two,|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: Not sure about 4@H, as Miller still apparently had the K@S to cue|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N is probably a "serious slam try, while minor suit cues would be "courtesy"|pg||
nt|rv: yes cold, @h8 ensures a stopper and only 4-0 @d break offside can trouble this contract|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'll feel like I'm back at the bridge table|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: the more the merrier|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: i expect this will fail|pg||
nt|janm: Looks as if NS can make about 3 hearts (maybe 4) and EW can make about 3 clubs.|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have an easy partscore in clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: Basis system: NS: Precision @c and EW: 5 card major with weak and strong NT (green-red)|pg||
nt|jcwla: it now gives E something to think about when a huge chunk of the strength of E's hand is a @S void that's of no use in defense to 4@SX.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: needs the spade lead,   should be -1 |pg||
nt|janm: Let's see if EW can get the spade ruff to beat this. If W leads a high club, E can overtake to lead a spade back|pg||
nt|janm: But on the trump lead I think NS are going to make 4 hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D is a mystery|pg||
pc|s8|nt|tejjyid: what a nice system - pay in 8 card @D fit at 2 level |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no warm fuzzy things running around the table (yet)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb:  I recently saw a study suggesting that with 4-3-3-3 opposite 4-4-3-2  you should not try for the 4-4 major suit fit|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Other room just started to bid Bd 18|pg||
nt|henryb:  Oh? I thought they went back to play 29 and 30|pg||
pc|s6|nt|frankaus: has a chance but its really tough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Safe for a try by 10 tricks now.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|rv: now 10 tricks possibly|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: would have to magically read the club suit I think |pg||
nt|janm: So we've had two hands in a row where the best defence would be to take ruffs.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if i would have been any better off with 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: well it both sounds like they have an ace the DO NOT have |pg||
nt|barnets: i think south should x and north bid 3@C|pg||
nt|pelu: very nice contract if @Hs was running - or even 4-1|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: (imho)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: E figures to be short so playing 9@S there would have been a decent shot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Nobuyuki Hayashi|pg||
nt|tejjyid: probably a bit early for the warm fuzzy things|pg||
nt|jcwla: E has made the trusting decision and will be rewarded.  @H's E/W have three losers off the top.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|frankaus: now @C was req|pg||
nt|pelu: I see the point - but how do u know that ps has 4-4-3-2 :)?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am however convinced that it is losing bridge in general to bid game with two balanced hands and 24 HCP|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Wang Zhi-ge|pg||
nt|tejjyid: they like to sleep in|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: Reid checks to see if 2 tricks is enough to beat 6@H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: might he be concerned spade is cashing?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Hello from Hamilton.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: @H lead is bad idea now however |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: Reid might have also been checking backs of cards to see if they match |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: N and E starting taking the bidding cards away before Reid had a chance to X|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told neither NS player is known for being pessimisstic -- @SA not cashing would be way beyond that description|pg||
pc|h5|nt|janm: Of course S doesn't know for certain that the spade A is onside |pg||
nt|pzpp: E-W here just bid to an unlucky game in NT, with almost every card placed badly for them|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: ? 9 u have. By the @Shook u still have 9 if it loose.|pg||
nt|rv: Check this url http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html for all the latest standings|pg||
nt|pelu: now 8 - but "no way" to the 9. trick|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: best play @D and try yo set up a squeeze against West|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: Yes he dont want S in - but if he still not 9 tricks even with @SK right|pg||
pc|d5|nt|janm: My typing is slower than the players' play! So on to the next hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi welcome Nobuyuki, you too Roland, good luck with your move to the UK|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anything but @Sx works  --  but i would have thought @SA and go to next hand|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Both Ino and Teramoto are bridge professional in Japan.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: wd|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu: pressure on N|pg||
nt|henryb:  it would be nice to stop in 1NT,  -- oh oh, North just gave the contract|pg||
nt|pelu: and N just discard the wrong card: @s2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: for sure not @h9|pg||

nt|sybarra: but alas a push|pg||

nt|rv: Chinese Taipei, Indonesia, Aus and China are occupying top 4 slots|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Rashed Nabi Malik|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I confess I'd also open 2@s with the S hand - everything is right - vulnerability, position, spades being the highest suit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Ino won the senior teams in Bejing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice to have RV here. All info comes:) Local time here is 0530 but free today:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|janm: Of course now that 2@s has been alerted, it probably showed 5 spades and a 4 or 5 card minor, so wasn't even wrong on suit length, but I think it would be right to open it even if ...|pg||
nt|janm: it was just a weak 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same 1@H explanation as last board|pg||
nt|npcjpn: This year, he plays in open.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Great result there for Indonesia.|pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: a heavy 2N|pg||
nt|barnets: with 22 hcp and good 5 card suit|pg||
nt|barnets: n./s would be s well to bid 7N as 6 |pg||
nt|barnets: 13  tricks without club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ok now can e/w find and make slam? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: notes say Newell has 6@S --- i believe the notes|pg||
nt|sybarra: or can they really make 6 @D without help?|pg||
nt|henryb:  we changed boards all of a sudden|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: the match to watch|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@H was Mm 2-suiter, weak (youcouldguess, right?)|pg||
nt|jcwla: 20/20 hand here - always want to post the plus on these.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|barnets: east is marginal for a 4N raise|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cards are nicely placed for NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like "single suited"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is W can tell which suit |pg||
nt|frankaus: sys on  here is normal these days with X replacing 21C|pg||
nt|janm: N probably has a good idea that his partner's second suit is clubs and so won't be useful, but it's certainly possible to envision game anyway.|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT on @dQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  2N clearly a @s raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes and systems on= transfer in this case |pg||
nt|ahollan1: interference will slow down EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: with bidding opps suits |pg||
nt|rv: Hi Barnet and all specs|pg||
nt|barnets: hi|pg||
nt|rv: it is 9 AM IST here in India which is 4.30 hrs ahead of London time at this time of the year.|pg||
nt|pelu: A problem for E - this bidding could in precision be on 11+5|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hard to believe both red suits behaving favorably -- and will probably misguess both Qs anyway|pg||
pc|hK|nt|frankaus: olmost certainly its @H now that S trans to @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and wrong colors to be stepping in with 3 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry with 3 @C I meant|pg||
pc|h6|nt|janm: I don't know what options he had to invite over the DBL (surely 3@s was not invitational). I think S is going to come to 10 tricks, and he'd probably have accepted most ...|pg||
nt|janm: invitations, with maximum values and good spots in both suits|pg||
nt|tejjyid: nothing very frightening about this contract, orindeed 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: The stakes are raised here, though not into game.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|frankaus: looks to be a playable spot |pg||
nt|friggi: sure it does|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually 3 nt will work for e/w |pg||
nt|rv: my apologies for the delay, signing in from sunny Bangalore in South India|pg||
nt|barnets: i thnk north will lead a @H|pg||
nt|rv: after 6@d, can North consider an attacking lead?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not much to the play here worst he can lose 3@S 1@D|pg||
nt|pzpp: yes, and the lead helps declarer ahead in the race for tricks|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|pelu: same strat as the bidding in Board 1|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@d is apparently a transfer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now makes many|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 10 tricks, next board.|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@c is a non-standard rebid -- and since I do not have the CC handy, I cannot tell you what it shows|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb:  but this time I think S whould bid 2N|pg||

nt|friggi: Hi Syirley|pg||
nt|janm: Miller knows  that the DBL was a little light, so expects W to have only one spade, and takes the spade finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: some kibber (or you Al)  I am still triying to figure out if e/w can handle 6 @D|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5 imps to NS here|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has not spades from 6@D bid|pg||
nt|rv: if opps don't have source of tricks and just enough values it pays to passive, after 6@h there was a chance for North to consider @c lead|pg||
nt|rv: N-S are close to making 10 tricks in @h strain|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb:  ah. I misread the opening bid: a strong club, and 2N probably 11-13 with no 5 card major|pg||

pc|hT|pc|d9|pg||

mb|p|nt|friggi: ye sbut regardless, why give it away without fighting√ê|pg||
nt|friggi: ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this looks precision-ish |pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT is likely here|pg||
nt|cascade: does this meet your standard for 2NT Jan?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not meet my standard, but i might do it anyway|pg||
mb|1N|nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||
nt|janm: I probably wouldn't do it vul, but it's certainly close - I can't imagine bidding anything except 2NT or P|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c will be invitational with hearts|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably 3@c shows some sort of heart raise|pg||
nt|cascade: and Miller finds himself with a surprisingly good hand for all of the bidding so far|pg||
nt|janm: Everyone has different approaches to Unusual, but as far as I know everyone plays that the cue bids show partner's suit and the 4th suit (although some of us use one and some the ...|pg||
nt|janm: other for those meanings)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may be too hard to find|pg||
nt|rv: French Polynesia is doing a lot better than New Caledonia in this tourney|pg||
mb|2C|an|majors|nt|cascade: yes there are various ways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure about 4@C|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, especially with partner bidding 2NT vulnerable, Miller must wonder if his side has a game|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c tied to hearts and 3@d tied to spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a transfer over the transfer|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looks like Michaels.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and it is precision  (just not sure which variety) |pg||
nt|frankaus: communications wont be easy |pg||
nt|cascade: personally i play the lower cue agrees partner's suit and the higher is the other suit|pg||
nt|janm: As it is, it's pretty unlucky that 4@c goes down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=FG, 8+ HCP, 5+@D|pg||
nt|npcjpn: dbl = 3-card support?|pg||
nt|henryb:  the black kings are well placed foe N-S|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 3@H/@S available for EW.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a vey SOUND 2@H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: Nt for NS = 12-15|pg||
mb|3D|nt|friggi: but np for 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is not why i am not sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry wrong cc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=FG, 10+ HCP, 3+ CNTRL [A=2, K=1], 1-suit, 6+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H RELAY|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have good save in 5@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd suit or repeating the transfer?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: i bet second suit.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H is preemptive.  2@C is truly moth-eaten on a quacky min and a 5-bagger.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Are those 15HP wourth 1NT?  Ok. I use to do the same:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: transfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: the good news is E (or W) will have to lead something |pg||
nt|friggi: thne 3H then 3NT|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl tr|pg||
nt|frankaus: first 9 is on top then it gets difficult|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it might get you way too high and also misdirect the lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not agree with 3N: I think that should show tricks, and 2N should show 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|henryb:  that assumes you open 1N with all balanced 15-17|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT here is 6-10, so Why bid 2NT?|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is the only lead to beat 6N|pg||
nt|pelu: No they play 11-14 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell has extra King for his 1st seat 1@C -- but can't imagine anything other than 3N now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N is discouraging, but since Reid unlimited it is not pure signoff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Liu still has chance to splinter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: EW have ended in 5@H on  18|pg||
nt|rv: FP is lying 8th and NC is lying 13th out of 13 teams with 3/4th of tourney over|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@s easy slam to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good afternoon from partly cloudy vancouver|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: nice of @D's to break |pg||
nt|barnets: but never bid|pg||
nt|barnets: only -200|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S0single and force til min 4@H|pg||
nt|rv: I might have opened 1@d and rebid 1n with north hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: Jan tells me she plays the cues the exact opposite way to me|pg||
nt|cascade: the most important thing is that you have an agreement with your partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 3c for hearts, 3d for spades is the most common|pg||
nt|janm: This time we have a game where the declaring side will need ruffs (diamonds) to make it, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S asks controls   A=2 K=1|pg||
nt|rv: North could have chanced 3@c with enough distribution though suit is not good at these colors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: slam chances looking rather slim|pg||
nt|npcjpn: yes, that's I am afraid of.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he's done it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Chung now has a Powerhouse|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: twin 50's on 18 to Japan for 3 imps|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4@s, just splinter? or exclusion RKCB?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I hate the pass of 2NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: and the defense have ruffs to beat it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the hand with void gets to declare?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: contemplating 5@C opposite @SK and @HA?|pg||
nt|barnets: he also may have tried 3@C over 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 2@h alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: laughing :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|janm: Although if he takes the club finesse he's been offered (right you are that the club bid got them off to the wrong lead), he can pitch the diamond losers and then just needs to ...|pg||
nt|janm: avoid a spade ruff (or S needs to figure things out and give his partner one, which may be hard)|pg||
nt|janm: So that will be a third hand that could have been defeated by a defensive ruff |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if so then pass =3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 for @H switch, is it?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|frankaus: a not so obvious @D lead/switch can couse lots of communications problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead gets a bit messy |pg||
nt|rv: West opening is post-modern, I like his raise to 2@s with 3 card fit instead of 2@d|pg||
nt|pelu: Wellcome to Martin Johnson from Canada|pg||
pc|h3|nt|friggi: no problem. play for @D 3-3 |pg||
nt|pelu: so 2Nt would be 16-17 (18)|pg||
nt|rv: all of us like to upgrade the hand more often than downgrade, here North hand is clear candidate to downgrade|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think in new zealand would be simpler to alert natural bids|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: interesting -- could only do that because of @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: glad i'm not at the table -- as declarer i'd go into long tank because of too many possible lines|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nice bidding.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should be a formality to make it now, wd|pg||
nt|pelu: agree - 2NT is a bid u dont play - either 3Nt or 3@c|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: How may HP would u have shoved me by that sequense RV?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  because I think you need 3N to show a very different hand: say Ax, xxx, AKQxxxx, Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a) @S ruff  b) @SQ @CAK float @DQ c) @SK then ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5@CX on its way down three - would be even from S.  Was all set to praise S's discretion.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: where grant showed four spades is unclear|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 rounds of bidding - just to miss a laydown slam :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: bids being explained|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in my methods north bids 2@S over the tranfer advance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so we can focus on slam bidding rather than game|pg||
nt|pzpp: I think that they play UDCA, just discourage|pg||
pc|s4|nt|janm: Declarer going after those diamond ruffs - but that will probably make it easier for S to realize he needs his partner to have a spade ruff coming, won't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but as he did not discard a diamond i dont see how defense can go wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told: 1@S = asking bid in @s, 2@D = 5 card !, (2 top) 2@H asking in @h - 2@S no @h-control|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: but 3@c would prob be X - so...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Thanks PEter, you have precisely expressed my view NT isinv/forc|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jcwla: Turns out, eleven tricks is a lot.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Less that 15-17?|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@d ask in @d - 4@C = A x(x)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|janm: I think S has to play A and a spade here, doesn't he? |pg||
nt|cascade: he doesnt have many options|pg||
nt|cascade: he would have been better to not overruff but he didnt know that his @hK was always a winner|pg||
nt|rodal f: tan*|pg||
nt|rv: I presume South would have invited even after 1@d-1@h-1n and N-S would have reached game|pg||
nt|rodal f: than*|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: even heart heart beats it|pg||
nt|janm: I don't know, it might be tempting to assume that West was doing the right thing and so it's necessary to play trumps to stop the second diamond ruff|pg||
nt|cascade: that works too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh maybe not south will be endplayed|pg||
nt|janm: I think he can make after heart & a heart, can't he - lead a spade to the K, which either gets him to dummy or endplays S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile there has been way too much of this "pass and come in later" in this event -- bid it up NOW and give them uncomfortable decisions, not fielder's choices.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: as long as club ace still in dummy|pg||
nt|janm: If N leads a club now, declarer has to ruff, not win the A, which may not be clear|pg||
nt|rv: With West hand, I prefer to rebid 2@d and subsequently bid 2@s or 3@s with extras (14+)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d7|nt|pelu: tx Al|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this leaves a whole lot of strength issues in doubt|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|pzpp: ?|pg||

nt|pelu: u also need 2NT to show 16-17|pg||

nt|pelu: I dont like that a ballanced 16 HCP-hand take command|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: better take @cK now|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|frankaus: trouble brewing|pg||
nt|henryb:  now declarer should draw trump and play a @d to the 9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north hand too flat and too minimum for asking bids to be effective|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: he had to overtake|pg||
nt|cascade: if he guesses the spade|pg||
nt|janm: No, maybe that won't work - on a clulb at this point, he can ruff, but then has to cross to the heart J and won't have a way back to his hand. But on this return, he can ruff the ...|pg||
nt|janm: low club to pull trump - oops, |pg||

nt|rodal f: One thing is to precume if u show less than u have. An other thing is to show ure pard what u have.|pg||
nt|pelu: I play Cue bids grom a ballanced hand, and asking bids from the other hand  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: either that or initial control responses of some kind|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry they got a bit fast then !|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@d - bit not 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: unfav 1st/2nd = 131-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: or 13-15|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|rv: North's hand is close to an upgarde for 15-17 nt range|pg||
nt|barnets: north has a super max and 4@S will make|pg||
nt|rv: some might open 1@c and rebid 2n|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so the asking bids are in a range context|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: 1m - 1M - 3NT is the hand u show|pg||
nt|ahollan1: TRF |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Looks like Norths diamonds vs the opps respective hearts and spades in this one|pg||
nt|pzpp: agree, players just think for a long time, then play like zip,zip, zip|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: they do not always show their cards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: np-look what a hand anything beyond 5@C by NS, the trouble starts.|pg||
mb|d|nt|friggi: play E for High @S |pg||
nt|friggi: let opps play @H|pg||
nt|barnets: i prefer that yes|pg||
nt|barnets: too strong for 1N|pg||
nt|henryb:  North's diamonds do not win the battle|pg||
nt|tejjyid: may be tough to decide though|pg||
mb|r|nt|fabsayc: what system for new zealand|pg||
nt|janm: Also hard for N to realize that he needed to play the second club to cut declarer's communications :) (I'm not sure why declarer had played the heart ten though - if he hadn't he'd ...|pg||
nt|janm: have been able to overtake the heart J)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 4@S by E has chances but the bad break should scuttle it|pg||
nt|pelu: no - I am old Acol-player, so distribution forst - that can improve a hand - and then cue/asking|pg||
mb|2C|nt|friggi: @C lead not enough|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you ever super accept with weaker nts?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont play them, so just asking |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just going to say that Newell COULD have bid 3@H as SSGT super-accept  [short suit game try]|pg||
nt|sybarra: for an older person such as me,  I would have to do too much "re-thnking" of system |pg||
nt|henryb:  Is 2@d a transfer or an amorphous force?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S ok by 100% hit by the guesses. Might 3NT is better. But....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT an easy make.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rv: South will pass here in all likelihood, if he had Inv strength he would have Xed 2@c to set up forcing auction till 2n|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Can't tell from the auction, can we? 1@c was alerted, as was 1@d. I'd have said we still didn't know from the alert to 1@c, but probably now it was a strong club and negative ...|pg||
nt|janm: diamond - still not certain|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am told precision|pg||
nt|janm: And what was 2@c by East?|pg||
nt|henryb:  West now emerges with 3N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i started old -- thinking systems has helped me regress|pg||
nt|sybarra: One Kib suggested bidding  3@H over 2@H (4 crd support, xx in @H)|pg||
nt|barnets: so n/s miss a decent game patly as a rsult|pg||
nt|rv: South chose to pass 2@c and subsequently 2@h since he suspected misfit|pg||
nt|rv: at MPs, many of us would act with South hand|pg||
nt|barnets: cant see why south did not bid 2@S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kiwi_joker: the latter i believe|pg||
nt|rv: not my choice for 2@c opening if it shows strong hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: still, perhaps theywill explore for 6@D and stop in !5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Uncomfortable decision now for S -- has alerady seen a much better 6-card suit than this go for 800 a level lower.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: certainly gave S, someproblems |pg||
nt|npcjpn: Facing passed partner?|pg||
nt|pelu: here my "favorit" convention (when opp play): 1NT F1 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: the mistake was made by N leading @H after overtaking|pg||
nt|sybarra: N was dummy |pg||
nt|friggi: sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: just "followed suit" |pg||
nt|friggi: dec|pg||
nt|pelu: almost 8 playing trick - and good gamble here|pg||
nt|barnets: at any scoring|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|nt|janm: After a strong club and negative diamond, I'd have thought 2@c would be natural|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not forcing, was passed hand|pg||
nt|pelu: are u sure -they have some support-hands in 1NT|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: and another challenging hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: easier for us than at the table|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, sure it is|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, this won't make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well i am just saying i dont play it forcing in this auction|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: apparently natual is passe|pg||
nt|pelu: here pd had the cards he need: @S-stopper, help in @H and 3 card @d so the suit is running|pg||
nt|tejjyid: to Nunn, the @H & @C valuesall look wated|pg||
nt|tejjyid: wasted|pg||
nt|pelu: Its a real top-match, Australia no 2 and Indonesia No 3, Taipie No 1|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: natural|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have the balance of points and the spade suit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: at least undoubled:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't like a system where West can't show the @D support on this hand though|pg||
nt|pelu: results: http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html |pg||
pc|d2|nt|rv: good lead giving nothing away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is one 10 in hearts from a decent game|pg||
pc|d3|nt|friggi: that is nice:)|pg||
nt|janm: The bidding is more interesting than the play on this hand. It's out of our "ruffs to beat" set of hands, just a boring 10 top tricks, 3 losers |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no emotion shown !|pg||
nt|pzpp: facing 3NT, Lin had a big decision to make, his hand appears to be sourceful of tricks, just need a good @c suit and @s control to envisage slam|pg||
nt|pzpp: not sure of their agreement here, is 4NT just a general interest and natural invitation?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: ask about the 3@s bid|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: playing J to see if he can get accurate count |pg||
nt|pelu: yes missing @H10 not so bad - need a @c-lead to defeat|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pzpp: 3@s could be just a cuebid for @s stopper for NT purpose|pg||
nt|rnmalik: all cards badly placed, other than missing 2Aces, the Q@H.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes opps were asking|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|friggi: this line is better the play for 3-3 @C|pg||
nt|friggi: then|pg||
nt|janm: I'm told that 2@c showed either diamonds or the Majors|pg||
nt|rv: declarer can still mis-guess all suits, generally trump lead is worthwhile if 1 hand is known to be very strong|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IMO, 3@D is mandatory aafter 2@S - assuming it's GF|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rv: if South doubles 2@C and subsequently bids 2@S it is likely to be forcing, passing 2@c and bidding 2@s should be NF|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|rv: South took conservative route since he suspected misfit/bad breaks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cascade: suction|pg||
nt|pelu: I play 2@S FG, and then 3@D id the obvius bid over 2NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: me to|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, 17 and 18 have come in -- 17 just 2 to Indonesia for staying a level lower in @H's, but 18 the big one: 14 to Indonesia for 800 here and 100 in OR against 5@HX.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Those are the type of boards that decide IMPs matches.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 10@s played in error, penalty card|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that has the unattractive name of suction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- i think that's what I said Shirley -- but it is not obligatory [especially with min]|pg||

nt|ritong: mm|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: Danny -- you aren't the only one who mentioned Steve there|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but here we're in context of precision  where 1@D=1+|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: and it seems to work well here, catching 4 card support|pg||
nt|geot: South has a huge hand, and in the CR he bid 5@C over 4@S in the second bidding round. No success.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when i open 1@S -- partner's pointed suits are flip-flopped|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: I'd start with 2@C then double later.  More flexible to END with double :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|ritong: claro que si|pg||
nt|geot: 3@S pre-emptive. Huang hopes for an ace with partner, but anyway 4@S is ok.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s5|nt|geot: same auction. Most likely push, but there are only three top losers. |pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|3for3: when declarer tries to draw trump, his heart ruff in the dummy disappears.  can still guess hearts for 1 loser though|pg||
nt|geot: I am counting one in trumps, not practical to solve that one....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since this is public forum i don't think i'll admit i would NOT open 1@S|pg||
nt|ritong: mm...say you draw two trumps|pg||
nt|geot: We will win 5@C:) seeing all the cards.|pg||
nt|ritong: then a top @h|pg||
nt|ritong: after that, a @h to the 8 caters with all, seems|pg||
nt|ritong: but declarer might go for @h Qj bare|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|geot: which would have made him make the contract|pg||

nt|geot: to solve trumps. Then he will solve hearts too|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: digression:  in the U26 match  after 4 comparisons Australia 15  Singapore 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they began the match with Austalia leading by 1.33 VPs|pg||

nt|ritong: home and dry now|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: Huang known to be on minimum, so must be distributional for @S.  since Wu 3@S bid show 4, Asbi may actually be able to read  5161 or 5251|pg||
nt|geot: He will pull the trumps now, and then low heart from dummy. When the Q comes he is practically safe by playing a low to the nine. Unless West has played the ! from Q-9.......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- Henri did already say that|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|ritong: always good to see we agree|pg||

pc|dT|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: and relatives|pg||
pc|cT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|geot: Playing the Q from Q-9 in this situation is the only defence to make declarer go wrong. If the nine comes he will bang down the other honor and concede only one heart. |pg||

nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@s or 1?|pg||

nt|rv: have the rains stopped in South Island?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: bidding it more of a challenge now |pg||
nt|friggi: not good bid at all|pg||
nt|janm: New Zealand's IMPs came from board 2, where EW were allowed to play in 4@c and didn't make it (so that was a chance for a Hong Kong pickup if they'd gotten the spade ruff to beat ...|pg||
nt|janm: 4@h)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||
nt|rv: 2@c is possibly single suiter here|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: The Hong Kong IMPs are from board 3, where the HK N bid game over his partner's 2@s opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it gets stronger in 3rd/4th|pg||

mb|3N|nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|henryb:  So did East: 4@d shows a good 4@s.|pg||
nt|pelu: also my bid - the hand is too weak to 4@D (namyats)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C takes them out of relay mode -- i think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: meanwhile closed room seems to have gone to sleep|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Hans must have missorted his cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think Namyats should be a better hand than that|pg||
nt|pelu: CC: just a solid suit - but I agree with u|pg||
nt|pelu: and not "solid" :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  My rules (back when I played it) was no 3-loser suit, and not two suits with two fast losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe DBL is relay -- i'm just not sure :(|pg||
nt|rv: at any other colors, West will gleefully doube 2@d, he is likely to bid 3n at these colors|pg||
nt|pelu: Grant like to bid - but he has no bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: is this a slam that is biddable?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is very possible that 3@H=exact shape|pg||
nt|rodal f: The lead at match and team is? not @C but thrumph.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|sybarra: 3 @D bid not recommended at home |pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe only at home LOL|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: helps W to count that hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe "we" are on our way |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so YES Shirley|pg||
nt|tejjyid: itsvery disciplined to take 2 passes on that hand; mabe he will balance over 3@H?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|janm: 3@s presumably Smolen, showing a game force with 4 spades and 5 hearts, so that partner can play the hand in hearts; they know they don't have an 8 card fit in spades already|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what to lead|pg||
nt|janm: 3NT is going to be very difficult to make here|pg||
nt|rv: E-W playing negative doubles and forcing pass till 2n after double by West to set up forcing auction|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2 Key Cards + @HQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: but when I bid these,  hts are always 4/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lucky -- mine 5-0|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: seen the hand maybe !|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: i might lead spades as the least destructive|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rv: I like this treatment as well, prefer positive doubles if we have bid a 4+ card suit naturally and on a similar forcing auction|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nice lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: another long think|pg||
nt|tejjyid: There's some serious underbidding going on here|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rv: East-West should time such defenses very well, need to combine punching declarer and remove his trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: if e/w tap dec he will make 4 @D tricks and a club|pg||
nt|pelu: why didn't S bid 3@D ?|pg||

pc|c7|nt|sybarra: pity the trumps dont break (just a joke) |pg||

nt|rodal f: But always 110EW|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|janm: Hard to know what to lead, I agree; although leading a 5 card suit is often right, when it's a bad suit and dummy has 4 of them... So I think he's probably right to try to find ...|pg||
nt|janm: partner's suit, just unlucky that he chose the wrong minor|pg||
nt|barnets: if they dont tap he makes 3@D tricks and 2 clubs|pg||

nt|pzpp: precision 2@c|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: not sure|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nice 4@S for the NZers here (even 3NT makes)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and naturally interesting to watch-no play:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: i think so|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NP, these guys are prety quick, I imagine|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: battle of spades and hts, |pg||
nt|barnets: 3N and 4@S both make here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and 4 @H's always "transfers" to 4 @S (for opps) |pg||
nt|cascade: i just checked double dummy and GIB thinks Miller needed to find the @c8 to defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|janm: Defense might get endplayed out of one trick, but 2? Hard to tell. And of course it isn't easy to lead the club Q either, just easier than leading low|pg||
nt|janm: But GIB lets declarer play double dummy too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EHAA was never this creative|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 9 tricks plaing \s by NS, 8 tricks playing \D by EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 2@s seems a gross under-bid here|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: ooops|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kiwi_joker: they really needed to find out about the nice secondary fit in @Ds to bid this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes very|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If that tempo reflected the table, I don't think much of it|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
pc|h2|nt|friggi: should do|pg||
nt|friggi: ??|pg||
nt|sybarra: well indeed that is true!|pg||
nt|rv: it is normally played as Invitational strength 8-9/10 hcp even with 4@s|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|janm: Ah, here we see science in action (not!)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well if 2s is minimum is quite reasonable|pg||
nt|sybarra: I only played it in midnight swisses|pg||
nt|barnets: you put the hex on australia|pg||
nt|rv: interesting contract to play and defend, I expect defense to prevail here|pg||
nt|rodal f: -1 and next? but normal bidding.|pg||
nt|pelu: In my book the N hand is too strong to splinter|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North should KNOW what he is doing over a 4@H cue when he bids 4@D|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|cascade: 2@s will be minimum|pg||
nt|janm: They got to the right spot of course, but does N really know that his partner can't have enough for 7? Make the diamond Q the club Q for instance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might gain by not helping defense to lead|pg||
nt|cascade: i am pretty sure they dont play 2/1 FG|pg||
nt|fabsayc: remember is precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry there is no commentary here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: so 2s is definitely limited|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 3@s is not invitational, so pass looks automatic.|pg||
nt|rv: @h ruff or 2@s tricks in addition to 2 tricks each in @hs and @cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes precision 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 11-15|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rv: with 5@s and super-max for passed hand, I would have started with 2@h with West hand|pg||
nt|rv: lol|pg||
nt|barnets: as they miss a good game especially on th e bidding|pg||
pc|s6|nt|janm: Even if 2/1 isn't FG, couldn't he at least bid 2@c and then blackwood and tell his partner they had all the keycards and adequate trumps - S would know that AQx of clubs was golden|pg||
nt|rv: commentator's curse as Barnet rightly put it:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if lead is fourth best, start looking elsewhere|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rv: can even be 2 down now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|tejjyid: and SOuth does not have enough to bid over a signoff, IMO|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is no elsewhere but you do look|pg||
pc|sA|nt|janm: Of course he doesn't have that, but he could have|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my last Regional event on East Coast I came in 2nd in Masters Pair with one of the Authors of EHAA -- Eric Landau|pg||
pc|s4|nt|janm: Or a sixth spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: were you playing that system?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: better J to kill @HK as entry for the 4. @d|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|pelu: I would never lead @D against 3NT - normal a @H and have @DA as entry or a shot in @S|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all true but sometimes no science is better|pg||
nt|rodal f: @H10 drop auto. Can't miss 7 tr.|pg||

nt|geot: A club lead will set 3NT on this one. And declarer must finesse the ten in diamonds to win. Strong 630 in the CR.|pg||
nt|geot: Spade lead is normal.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: 2@D WAS game force -- i wonder why 2@H on that terrible 5 card suit instead of natural 2@S |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S must still show extra ala reverse|pg||

nt|pelu: 4@D or 4@s by West?|pg||
nt|rv: I intend to drive to game in any case and in my opinion 2@h gives more flexibility|pg||
nt|pelu: @HA was the gift decl need|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually the heart return was the gift|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: toilet break :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: back|pg||
nt|pelu: 26 HCP |pg||
nt|jcwla: Nicely done by Liu with that @DT and score it up.  Meanwhile, 5 more to Indonesia as Chinese Taipei made 4@H in the OR but went for 800 in 5@CX here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: anyone wanting to commentate please feel free|pg||
mb|1N|an|maybe 5 cards major 14-16|nt|ahollan1: hmmm will other room get to game after West open's strong 1@C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: partner is a huge favorite for exactly two hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another partial.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 2@D = Multi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3h is not my choice|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless specifically agreed as a weak jump|pg||
nt|pelu: agree - bidding direct on Multi sh show a better hand|pg||
mb|4C|nt|janm: I suppose there could be QJ in front of the K and A over it, but I don't think bidding scientifically will make it any easier for them to find that|pg||
nt|cascade: they have another chance to showcase their slam bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: see NSs problem after 4@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  somewhat difficult to get to 6@h-- maybe less difficult when West chooses not to open a large number of spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can blame the layout for EW at this board.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 12-13 tricks on @Dq|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: both directions have hands that fit together beautifully.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|janm: This time S has a positive response to 1@c|pg||
nt|janm: Can they find diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@S, 0-3@H, maybe longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|kaz08833: its highly likely NS will play 2NT which will go down|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N must pass surely|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 3rd bidding box landed on the floor in this session|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: I like 4@s here, max pre-emptive effect and tough for NS to get in|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Looks like each side can make 11 tricks in their best fit|pg||
nt|pelu: here a very popular convention X pd pass if u have the suit - In my opinion the convention dont work well - u can never X for penalty if u have a good penalty pd|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: whimp|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: oops|pg||
nt|jcwla: Uh oh.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Or is 6@c okay too?|pg||
nt|cascade: do they need to|pg||
nt|henryb:  North MUST bid here; pass is not acceptable with that good a hand and heart support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=ART, 5+@D|pg||
nt|barnets: not best|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: rescued|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D usually 2/3@D but ....|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@h = 4+ HCP|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|sybarra: but can W lead a @D easily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6c is better|pg||
nt|pelu: ok a bidding: 4@s P P 4NT - then 5@C (or 6@C) by N and 5/6@D by S = 2 siuter in red|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not be best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell had option to bid 3@C showing MAX with longer @C|pg||
nt|barnets: Q|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rv: South's action is surely too timid though it is hardly clearcut to bid at 5 level|pg||
nt|barnets: would show  the @HA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cascade: anyway the answer was yes easily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D likely down if diamonds 4-1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C would still have chances|pg||
nt|kaz08833: with other Q N shd pass it's unfortunate judge by N|pg||
nt|rodal f: Auto @S hook and a 50% @D hook for 10in @S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps but they have bid my multi suit a few times, and i am still spending the winnings|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the slam was NOT found so 13 well earned imps to CT|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I kinda blame Stout a bit here .. he has chance to bid 3@C, which would have pushed pd's buttons (and they would never defend 5@Dx then)|pg||
nt|rv: I would pass 2@s with West hand, no Invite with 7 hcp, bid game only if partner super-accepts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i was wondering how that 3@H bid would backfire|pg||
nt|pelu: in US and ? canada - the defense against Multi is not so commen as in Europe|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: might see china gain some imps here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: slams all make with @S Qx in North|pg||
nt|jcwla: You might say...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: with the opening bid,  not easily |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that brings up point of extreme trivia - i was given URL that explains origin of "schneid"  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061024124644AA8yaYF|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|janm: I assume all of this was natural after 1@c and 1@d, and 3@s is some sort of attempt to find NT|pg||
nt|janm: 6NT won't be a success|pg||
nt|henryb:  Would North's pass be forcing? I do not think so. And North could have much less, say AKJxxx in clubs and out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: where do we locate BBO|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh is this blackwood|pg||
nt|rodal f: At the -edge for W but...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|janm: Surely if N jumps to 6@c, S should let him play there |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have bid 4@C over 3nt|pg||
nt|janm: I think 4NT is just a quantitative slam try, not Blackwood|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club queen has to be a big card|pg||
nt|cascade: south did well to move with no aces|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, but S seems to be thinking along NT lines, also if he bid 4@c wouldn't that make it sound as if 3@s was a cue bid?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Took it out.|pg||
nt|rv: West should surely pass 3@s after his invite|pg||
nt|jcwla: Always max pressure from the Indonesian pair -- no free space -- a winning style.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|barnets: well done|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure Herr exp a better hand by partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have to fight everytime to play it live, mostly recently last weekend|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if theat 4 HCP is 2 Q's, East can stop here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: i liked the unscientific auction better|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, N has a minimum and a void in partner's suit, so even with that nice 6-card suit and 3 aces, it's not unreasonable for him to pass|pg||
nt|pelu: here in denmark even "the old ladies" play Multi :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the final ruling was the event strength of the weakest team was over 8000 master points so multi allowable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i swear this is true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as opposed to my usual embellishments|pg||
nt|pelu: I trust u - and here we find that atitude vert strange (mild expression :))|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think and sigh|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|cascade: Stout does have spade stoppers but the @sAK and the rest of his hand are also suitable for slam|pg||
nt|janm: This one wasn't really very scientific either :)|pg||
nt|rv: he has bid his hand to the hilt by showing 5@s and 8-9 hcp|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 4NT quantative, I assume, so Nunn can cue@C |pg||

nt|ritong: north is supposed to hold 4@hs|pg||

nt|ahollan1: south is supposed to hold east's hand|pg||

nt|janm: The reason I think the strong club might hurt on this hand is more psychological than real - N starts out thinking he has a minimum and doesn't revise that idea|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the vague 3s and 4nt did them in|pg||
nt|janm: Another void opposite partner's long Major!|pg||
nt|cascade: he is minimum until he finds a fit|pg||
nt|cascade: then he has a very slam suitable hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: My guess is N/S feel good about their game, but not as good as it  will score up |pg||
nt|rodal f: So after the board: That was not as I would have done it. If E goes dow. And WD if home:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: internet connection a bit slow here|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: on @d lead, declarer pitches a @h, draws a round of trumps and plays a @c out|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: wow - some interesting deals today|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I know, but I just think that it's easier to recognize that if you start out thinking you have a lot in reserve for your opening bid :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: maybe defense is just bid your longest suit |pg||

nt|pelu: yes - not my style - but on the other hand - I dont like to see a long relay-bidding by opp|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rv: this should get beaten|pg||
nt|babs59: of course, I've just noticed his name showing as Paul Gill, but it's Peter Gill, and he's my brother|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: probably thinking S lead from kxxx|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe he should duck the @D|pg||
nt|barnets: another @D|pg||
nt|barnets: knocks out the ace|pg||
nt|rv: yes that would be a good deceptive play especially at trick 1|pg||
nt|barnets: and if east plays a third @D dec is home|pg||
nt|barnets: and in the newspaper too|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cascade: Michael Lawrence had some advice for 6=4s which i read many years ago|pg||
nt|janm: I think it's automatic to rebid the 6 card major with a relatively weak hand, but I've been told that's old fashioned :). Glad to hear some support|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|henryb:  Not the Acol I know. that is weak throughout|pg||
nt|rv: has a very good chance of working especially if West returns @D3 which may be difficult to read|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: welcome to Pat Anderson, USA|pg||
nt|fifee: ty Shirley :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not enough trumps to take the rest|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: maybe down under= upside down  |pg||
pc|s4|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does that mean in NZ i'd be a morning person?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|cascade: his advice was with 6=4 rebid the suit with the most high card points|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe |pg||
nt|babs59: board 7 where Gill and Gosney missed game, OR  West opened 1S and passed partner's 1NT response (surely forcing?)|pg||
nt|babs59: so it was a flat board|pg||
nt|rv: declarer should have possibly cashed 4@cs instead of playing 3rd @d|pg||
nt|rv: that would have forced West to make 2 pitches and he might have got it wrong|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any are long at @H it's W. Play @H for the Q|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jcwla: But this has been their style throughout -- "maybe if we wish and hope and pray it might come true" -- that Indonesia will stay out -- but they don't, so get where you're going ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: asap.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: perish the thought|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzkt: got em|pg||

pc|c6|pg||

pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: AJxxxx   KQ109 i rebid clubs|pg||
nt|cascade: with QJT98x i would definitely rebid my six bagger|pg||
nt|janm: Where did the second diamond loser go?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry, only made 11 tricks|pg||

nt|babs59: I just don't want to see it ALL go away|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes pass|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pelu: 11 tricks in @h/@d for EW - 5@C would be expensive for NS|pg||

nt|pelu: I hope not :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: pulled out the cards and put them back|pg||

nt|pelu: yes no problem for me - @sK better now and 4¬Ω loser|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I agree the 6-4 is worth an extra K & the @SK is worth an extra Q - so I call this a 19 |pg||
mb|p|nt|fifee: @S lead is a killer|pg||

pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html  for standings after 12 of the 13 rounds in RR1|pg||

nt|sybarra: did it mean specially wk @D's?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *specifically |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 25 starts with Precision 2@C on previous board -- it gets scary from there|pg||
nt|jcwla: 22 and 23 pushes in 2@S making 3 and 3NT making 4, respectively.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|barnets: how does this tourney work ?|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|janm: He knows he probably has the best hand at the table, but that doesn't necessarily translate into the ability to take 8 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Amanda, Henry, Peter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes @D preempt|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: swing both ways on 19 4 more CT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you did not accept|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: tight match so far|pg||
pc|d6|nt|janm: Well, he pushed them one higher, so I guess he was right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe double|pg||
nt|barnets: do the top 8 play off or top 4?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you can guess I play few partscores|pg||
pc|d2|nt|janm: But DBL should surely suggest some club length, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2d suggests better diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double allows for 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D/@H are Transfer Preempts -- only 3@C is nat pre|pg||
nt|babs59: Paul Gosney has also qualified for the Australian Under 26 team - which meant that for NZ PABF he has been replaced in the team|pg||
pc|dK|nt|janm: True, but I'm afraid the doubleton club would keep me from doubling - I think I'd end up being a chicken and passing - maybe bid 1NT?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 21 it was|pg||
nt|davidstern: They may have right sided this to avoid a heart lead|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 25  China in 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: glaned at conv. cards, and were more than I could deal with at this time of night |pg||

nt|fabsayc: but since i dont drink coke, is ok|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess the lackof@C Q hurt them|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|janm: However, pushing the opponents up a level was certainly a good thing, because it looks as if 2@s will be very difficult to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: partner will only bid clubs with 5, then the support is adequate|pg||
nt|barnets: tks |pg||
nt|barnets: nick|pg||
nt|babs59: I understand that this year it's a double RR and then the leading team wins|pg||

pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: get a new partner jan :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if i had say 2524 i would rebid 2c|pg||
nt|janm: Once upon a time, I doubled 1@d with 4441 (in that order). My partner waited until the 4 level to bid his 4 card club suit!! Taught me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so i think here double suggests some diamond length|pg||
nt|janm: I would be more likely to DBL with 2524, and certainly with 1534, but I think you're convincing me to bid 1NT|pg||
nt|rv: Official tourney url is http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/|pg||
