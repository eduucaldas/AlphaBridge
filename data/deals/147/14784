nt|Walddk2: One team conceded after the first 16|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Off we are with an interesting deal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not often you are dealt such a nice 6-6 hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: deal 1 and W has an 8 card suit -good start !|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 heart makes, 4 spade down 1 on a ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Final, 4 segments of 12 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
mb|3C|nt|othered1: Hi, everyone from overcast central Pennsylvania,  USA|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Do we know what the running score is here?|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c p 1@s 4@h p p dbl p 4@s all pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Partner has enough for slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8221 is 0.19%|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: Oh, our operator forgot to carry forward|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes one sec|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If @CA had been @HA a grand slam even|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Always difficult to bid a slam when the opponents open|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H is a two-suiter|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Unia  40-23|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: If the players were hoping for a nice and quiet start, they now need to rethink. This is explosive|pg||
nt|psridhar: and all those low % hands coming to west alone -what wd be odds ?|pg||
nt|tez: down 1 if they find @d ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C Precision-like|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good aftenoon all.|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome back|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@H Michaels    2@S  sound raise in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H   Good cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They all seem to have wonderful cards on this auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What about a save in 7@H? Profitable yes but I doubt they will take it IF they bid slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1100 on best defence, but 800 more likely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Short and not so sweet in the closed room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We were told yesterday that the ACBL has barred a 2-level opening that shows both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't see the wisdom I must confess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D asking for a 4-card major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Interesting actions EW, since south's 3@H implies some @S length, I think -- assuming 2@D is multi.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Semi-finals, 3 segments of 12 boards. One tonight, two tomorrow|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: how would you defend 4 spades seing the west hand?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Mike Graham|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good evening all.|pg||
nt|othered1: Rehi, everyone|pg||
nt|othered1: North has decision here, with a possible vul game |pg||
nt|VugraphP1: due to technical problems, we could not record play, so i'll just make claim|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
mc|9|nt|mdgraham: NS Polish Club with a veritable host of gadgets|pg||
nt|psridhar: i dont understd the auction-how did S find 4S on his own on a 5 bagger?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can open 2@H to show hearts and a minor, but not 2@H to show hearts and spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Makes absolutely no sense to me|pg||
nt|othered1: But they went right|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: so- did you all find the obvious dia ?:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes ably guided by boss|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Spade part score most likely|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know EW's system?  Or NS's for that matter.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Must be disappointing for Wiankowski to have been dealt only 6-5 now|pg||
nt|tez: sure we are comandating with open cards|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: BA crew demanding pay rise, you too Mike and Ed?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Anything goes in 3rd at favourable|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mamos:  here|pg||
nt|mamos:  no games here|pg||
nt|tez: 1@h 1nt shows long minor and 4 card @s in polish style|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hands up everyone who would respond 1@s at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I remember the last BBO pay rise - it was identical to the previous one  |pg||
nt|othered1: No, we raise rates only once/yr.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But another slam is on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7 is on a heart finesse|pg||
nt|psridhar: normally polish 1D opg shows 5+ dia and unbal hand ..but 3rd seat here and fav vul|pg||
nt|othered1: I was afraid of 1N . . . |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|othered1: me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just as well they set hearts, then they will know they are off 1 keycard and will not bid a grand slam|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s inv+ @d supp|pg||
nt|tomi2: thats not right|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D is either 5+@D but maybe bal 12-14 OR 4+ unbal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Tez|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This may well make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hearts are very friendly|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to P Sridhar (PS)|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all Ty Roland|pg||
nt|psridhar: looks like an explosive start :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: with 10 hcp S had no bid - i wd hv bid 1nt to express my values |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: very moderat 2 spades here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Well, at least it made them stay out of a hopeless game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree with you, Ed, I don't like 1NT one bit|pg||
pc|sT|nt|othered1: Assuming a standard opening.  Opposite a limited opening, responding is a matter of partership philosophy|pg||
nt|mamos:  EW playing some limited 1@h|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt|pg||
nt|tez: coming|pg||
nt|psridhar: and a quick pass from W|pg||
nt|tomi2: so this is the normal systematic opening bid|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks easy with that stiff @hK|pg||
nt|othered1: hopeless as the cards lie, but 4@H is not without play on EW cards alone.  They just can't make any useful reevaluations after the 1N opening.|pg||
nt|othered1: Here both Qx holdings are useful.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tez: 3@h asks @h stoper for 3 nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H by North is presumably showing a solid suit and asking for a heart stop - which South does not have |pg||
nt|psridhar: i prefer 3c fit jump with E hand over 1s-descriptive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I thought you open 1@C with a 12-14 balanced hand|pg||
nt|tomi2: if she had one card in major less and one club more she would open 1@C|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psridhar: as Roland wd put it :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, passing quickly means that I don't have what I promised and that partner should not double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Vary good convention too|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: effective :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes thats the popular treatment of polish 1c-most of the time weak nt opg|pg||
nt|tomi2: not if you have 5@d, @H or @S, then you open your suit and rebid 1NT to show 122-14 bal with 5 of this suit|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: since i am watching this i havent seen a lot of unethical things, poles dont have the best fame, but it has improved i thk|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: I am not familiar with the 6@C response. Are you, PS?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes but what about 4342 for example?|pg||
nt|tomi2: to open 1@C on 5@D seems to be some Swedish sytlye|pg||
nt|tomi2: that is 1@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he has 7 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: this will be quick|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: OK, so 1@D is often 5+|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tez: 4@s is 2 down..with normal defence.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|psridhar: over 4nt, normally jump to 6c shows odd no of keys + useful void, here i dont know what it meant|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5nt to show even no of keys + useful void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To me that is an odd number of keycards and a useful void (5NT even number)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Personally, I think it's losing bridge to pass 1NT with that West hand|pg||
nt|tez: nice card play tecnique..cash ace..may be droping king:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hej Peter!|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Tez; hi, Peter!|pg||
nt|tez: double finesse is right play in @h..but entry problems|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Someone once told me that one should not let a good player declare 1NT|pg||
nt|tez: welcome Peter /Ed|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos:  looks like quite a big pick up for NS|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice tool to have available (and fairly standard) and it certainly showed well here.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and they did respond 1@S at the othe table, and North bid 3@H too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe not the most exciting contracts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They get extras for commentating on difficult slams|pg||
nt|othered1: no, but east will make plenty of tricks.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Flat 8, against the odds to move with the West cards|pg||
nt|othered1: Might EW find game in the other room?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And the lead was also quite helpful|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree with not acting on west's hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They did not, West also passed in the CR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much point pressing non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|psridhar: we were only joking -not insinuating at all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Come on, it should be pretty easy to spot that I was kidding|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ok for me!:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I'll remember :)  :)  :)  :)  next time|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: there were times when we werent kidding------:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: Pikus doesnt know h jack is falling doubleton so will hv an ancient moment or two|pg||
nt|psridhar: sry anxious |pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Tez|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|janhamhurg: but 4 hearts is off- so they will win a lot here|pg||
nt|tez: and Ralf sure.sry |pg||
nt|tez: hi:)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|psridhar: S wd like to play h twice towards tbl...but only one entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Until the 50's we had a club suit, and until the 80's we had 1NT openings with balanced hand only. Those were the days|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Can't cost to let East in|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: But it's all a matter of agreement|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|janhamhurg: so will he play a finess or try to drop the ace doubleton|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room N-S sold out to 2@S|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Only 4 with a 4441 pattern|pg||
nt|othered1: It just so often underevaluates hands for suit play.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tomi2: yes, 4441 1444 xx45 are the cases when you often have only 4 cards|pg||
nt|psridhar: in any case 3d is a par contract here|pg||
nt|psridhar: shd make|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4144 some prefere to open 1@C and rebid 1@S after partners 1@H bid, dont know what is standard there, I open the better suit in that case|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: If he has another spade they can only take five tricks at best|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: but then it seems that a certain amount of confusion arose, as they tried 3NT with no heart stopper - after a double, too |pg||
pc|c8|pc|h4|nt|janhamhurg: now the moment of truth|pg||
nt|psridhar: unless S finds a way to show values over his pd's 1h, selling out to 2s is likely|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos:  yes good bidding here   game explored and rejected wisely|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: Katich out, lbw|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Jan Lammerich|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tez: danger line..if they play 1 more @c|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: great!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 20-1|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|janhamhurg: no more club |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi all|pg||
pc|d2|nt|janhamhurg: he got his entry|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Jan|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|janhamhurg: hi ed hi roland , how is it?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|dQ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Previous set was not particularly well played I think it's fair to say|pg||
pc|d6|mc|8|nt|othered1: of course, the other room bid the same way, so I guess in this match, 1N is the normal bid and anything else swingy.|pg||

nt|psridhar: landed in their par and made it-wd|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: deserved imps well done|pg||
nt|psridhar: huge reward for that 1s-X by N wd|pg||
nt|othered1: I think the not letting a good player declare 1N has much more impact at pairs, especially in heterogenous fields.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s on E looks better than on W|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I use that word about 14 times a day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: heterogenous|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i guess its hot in poland as well and they have been playing a lot of hands the last days|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: Pikus has to find the lead against 4@s - @c or 2x @h and @c|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|othered1: transfer response?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if this is Polish Club, 1@C is the 12-14 balanced variety|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Really disappointing, no 6-6 or 6-5 now|pg||
nt|pelu: oh I exp that West would open 1@s :(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Probably a good idea not to open the West hand. 4@S can be set, but it requires a double dummy defence if East is declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He must lead a heart|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|tez: 3@h and 4@h (estimate)|pg||
nt|pelu: both hand has a naturel @d-lead|pg||
nt|tez: qt9x against axxx  right play is cash ace..then play to ten..its %69.2174 |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: however for 2@H by South, 1@D must be hearts  |pg||
nt|othered1: south likely showed 4-card support for north's @H suit.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we're not sure what systems are being played here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 12+12=....|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 9 card spd fit shd win the auction|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 heart is forcing here i hope:)|pg||
nt|tez: 2nt or 3 nt?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like redouble at all with 5-card support|pg||
nt|othered1: I like west's sound non-opening, even if it has been falling out of favor.|pg||
nt|tez: for 3 or 4 trick |pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yeah, this is the end|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d gf|pg||
nt|tomi2: and note that in Poland you don't have to alert 1@C. Only if you play that as 4+@C and nonforcing, you need to alert :)|pg||
nt|tez: nice points bad distribution|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3nt will be an interesting struggle for the declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bid 2NT as Truscott/Jordan|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=8502  Piotr Wiankowski|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: he has 9 tricks but has to play carefully|pg||
nt|tez: 2nt my choise nonevuln|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk he will make it , finessing dia 2nd round after jack falls on his left|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think 2nt-3nt does not depend on your actual hand. It depends more on parters style of opening bids, his declarer skills and your opps defending skills|pg||
nt|tomi2: say if you partner opens every 11 bal count non vuln you cant push to game with this hand but if he sometimes passes bad 12, you can do|pg||
nt|psridhar: for starters it is tempting to hope the lead is from qj|pg||
nt|tez: he afraids @s shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Making on the nose|pg||
nt|psridhar: a club ruff may hv beaten it -dia lead wont do any harm|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3s is a mild overbid, he has a nice min..but that stiff dia worries me|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 6 is down- so will they stopp?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: another partscore here, no chance to make game|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pelu: I dont understand the RD from W - only a way to let opp find the defense - why not 2NT or just 4@S?? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now she has given South the chance to find the killing lead|pg||
nt|othered1: I once played redouble with support was game-forcing.  west's hand might meet that standard . . . |pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 1@s overcall worked|pg||
nt|tez: they have all controls but not enuf pover..|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i thk 3 is fine but south is min|pg||
nt|psridhar: now S cannot sign off 4h -bcos that wd show no control in club|pg||
nt|pelu: he know he will bid 4@S - why not bid that - It's practical bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There you go|pg||
nt|othered1: north is minimum for his actions (except for good @S)?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|pelu: west only has himself to blame|pg||
nt|othered1: what would 3m by north mean?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yes - this looks eminently makeable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Daisy-picking (as Kelsey would have named it) cost|pg||
nt|othered1: As a matter of tactics, I agree with an immediate 4@S.  Was looking for a rationale for west's action.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: and S had no clue which minor will fetch|pg||
nt|tez: and singleton @d is not so nice|pg||
nt|psridhar: thats why that 3s was an overbid, since it commits him tocross 4h over 4d|pg||
nt|tez: are they playing udca?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Baard Olav Aasan|pg||
nt|psridhar: it was a pure guess|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but  a lot of queens of  doubtfull value|pg||
pc|hT|nt|baardolav: Good moorning all|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 m would be GF|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psridhar: gud morning Baard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What's wrong with 2NT, Ed?|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry herself - sorry-sorry|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|psridhar: N shd remember his pd bid 4s ; did not use 4nt why?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Watson out, lbw, 20-2|pg||
nt|tomi2: they might play smith peter|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: I don't understand this line. He is only in 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he could go down|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 6 will be down 1- hard to find the problem in the bidding, i think south schould sign off....but who knows|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hihi|pg||
nt|tez: hi Thomas:)|pg||

nt|tez: udca=up side count attitude|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i thk, about 7 with 5-4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: nice @CK|pg||
pc|cK|nt|othered1: A quiet 140 EW for a nice 2-way partial pick-up, 6 imps|pg||
nt|tomi2: N/S should have an agreement about 4@D (or 3NT) asking for club control only while the other bid askes about the quality of the hand|pg||
nt|tomi2: udca is quite sure. |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|psridhar: cant afford to duck this 2nd h|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tez: partscore swing |pg||
nt|othered1: When the @D finesse comes home|pg||
nt|othered1: brb|pg||

nt|psridhar: yes- he cd hv pitched his losing dia on dummy's club ater|pg||
nt|psridhar: later|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I suspect the TD will be summoned|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D is neg dbl with 5+@H in the N-S methods but it was not alerted on East's side of the screen|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: TD summoned...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Certainly, East has been damaged by the missing alert|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: I am pretty sure the TD will come to the same conclusion|pg||

nt|pelu: after the D in S west dont exp slam - so I prefer 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Certainly better than redouble|pg||
nt|tez: i like Ewa's play and bidding in this tournament.except this hand|pg||
nt|tez: brb|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: another 18 point hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Sure, the TD will give a ruling after he has had a closer look. That is normal procedure|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|psridhar: back to wild west -this time with a 7-4|pg||
nt|tomi2: would somebody open N's cards differently than Gierulski?|pg||
nt|tez: me|pg||
nt|tez: i would open 2@s:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: and treat the hand as a 2-suiter?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: He does not have to decide anything at the table right now|pg||
nt|tez: 9/12|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder what double implies.  @D?  General strength in a flat hand?|pg||
nt|pelu: here I play: RD = bid your suit,l and 2@H - my suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ed, we were told yesterday that the ACBL has barred any 2-openings that show both majors, 2@H for example. Can you explain the logic behind that decision?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H  hearts and a minor allowed, 2@H both majors barred|pg||
nt|othered1: No.  Protecting the field from invisible menaces.|pg||
nt|othered1: Does that include the 4@S - 5@H F-word convention?  Or Reverse F-word?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is not particularly breathtaking either. Just as well, Mike can confirm that it's incredibly hot in London atm|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: here 4 spade makes- 1 point less though|pg||
mb|2N|nt|othered1: lots of modern players will overcall at 1-level with a long suit, strength irrelevant.|pg||
nt|psridhar: at times the TD consults experts also b4 ruling|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Back to normal, 6-6 for West :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7420 = 0.36%|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: unlucky game, but makes on a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think so, just the weak version|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They don't bar American conventions|pg||
nt|pelu: the most common use of X = balanced 13-15 or 16|pg||
nt|pelu: 16+ 1 suited|pg||
nt|othered1: There is no chance whatever that they'd apply it to something Hamman-Zia, Weinstein-Levin and Martel-Stansby play, so it will continue to be safe.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Worked on the previous hand, too.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's a bidders game these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that's not wrong, Roland|pg||
nt|dimi: E-W can play some in majors, NS can play some in minor - no game available|pg||
nt|Walddk2: (Look at 13 and 14)|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4s shd make even losing 3 trump tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I was pointed to this card for NS:  http://www.polbridge.pl/_stara/kadra/2007/open/supermecz3/cc/gierulski_skrzypczak.pdf|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: West might have raised to 3@C there, with those majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but now NS have found their heart fit|pg||
nt|tez: 3@h for me|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: four-card trump support not to be sneezed at|pg||
nt|tez: 3@h good 2@s opening|pg||
nt|tomi2: can S now imagine an At9x sidefit and a void? I think 6@C is a decent spot|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psridhar: nice natural auction i like it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Something is wrong with that dealing programme it seems|pg||
nt|psridhar: S doesnt know abt the h void opposite -hence thinks his h is not a weak spot in 3nt|pg||
nt|tomi2: K&R (KJ9832 --- Txx AT9x) = 12.35   Kapland/Rubens treats this as an opening bid. opening 1@S will work out well verytime partner will not bid 2@H|pg||
nt|psridhar: now a spade guess shd see him thru|pg||
pc|c8|nt|psridhar: but dia break is bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a mighty good lead and should doom the contract|pg||
nt|tez: this is real 3@h opening..lesson hand:)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if West does raise to 3@C, Norht is kinda stuck|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer can't get to dummy in time|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes 2 minor tricks will be lost in addn|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tomi2: leading middle from tree small is not only systematic, its also very popular in Poland. I do not liks those leads vs 3NT in IMPs|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tomi2: these Championships are part of the very nice Bridge Festival in Sopot (close to Gdansk at the Baltic Sea). I already hadd my flight tickets and an offer from Wiankowski to stay in ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: his home, but for several reasons I had to cancel my trip :(  nice that I can participate via BBO anyway :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: True|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East's double usually just shows a decent hand, as opposed to what you might overcall with |pg||
nt|pelu: will US just go back to the conventions played in the 50'es?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: although double would be a good option, if that shows what North has got - some small spade support plus a few hearts|pg||
nt|tomi2: but I think this style coms from all those MP tourneys that are played in Poland all the time. In those festivals (exept of this one / this year) you usualy play 8 days MP and one ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: day IMP|pg||
nt|tez: @c lead give chanse for down..if @h lead..he will put k of @s..because @h shift kills to declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No wonder that bridge is declining on that side of the pond. They chase the youngsters away with all the restrictions|pg||
pc|s7|nt|janhamhurg: do you really think that the programms represent the statistics?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This one doesn't|pg||
nt|tomi2: teams eleminated in the previous rounds have lots of other pairs tournaments available, after sunday there will be a total classification. Last yeat Nowosadzki won this event|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 8 easy tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|tez: why not @s before?|pg||
nt|psridhar: can 3nt make? that 10 of spd is useful but i fancy it will go down too|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|dimi: will easily make|pg||
nt|tez: ''chance''|pg||
nt|tomi2: wests @S7 was a try to show that she wanted him to switch so some other suit|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|psridhar: in other room declarer lost trump control when he cashed h ace too soon to prevent a dia ruff|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psridhar: if they find the dia lead other tbl thi match will tighten|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: most dont- the problem is, that dull 1 notrump hand noone likes to play and see- so they just manipulate the programm same in bbo for sure:)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: "Welcome to our world, but you can't play A, B,C, D, X, Y and Z"|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tez: It's strange for me to play trump before playing long side suit|pg||
nt|tomi2: her MUD play in clubs was not systematic, so I guess she wanted to signal values in hearts that way. Olech now can hold his @D and score a beer in the end :)|pg||
nt|tez: with close cards super defence|pg||
nt|othered1: OKJ, let's go back to the 50's.  Roth-Stone and Kaplan-Sheinwold would still be available.   And KS remains quite playable.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: obviously the heart length is unclear, as otherwise West might have tried 2@H. But he has three spades, so 2@S is ok |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also a spade lead against the same contract in the CR|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3rd 6-6 in a row but perhaps the first failure ( in making a contract out of those 3 deals)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West really should complain now. He is dealt a boring 5431|pg||
nt|tomi2: Skrzypczak hates to claim for -1 he seems to play every card and hope some of his sportcard will become an ace :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did he not have 9 tricks?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maybe I missed something|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|tez: he was desperate at @S K trick|pg||
nt|baardolav: More normal hands now... seems like a 3nt ew|pg||
nt|psridhar: deals 13/14/16 -all massive to suiters; only 15 was an exception|pg||
nt|psridhar: two suiters|pg||
nt|psridhar: there is the Roland example of 1c opg with 4 dia |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@h 1@c 1 @c ruff and @sA =9|pg||
nt|othered1: May be unlucky if NS find their @H game.  Will EW give them reason to avoid it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West's approach on board 15 cost 10 IMPs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks in nt on N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D is Multi, weak with one major|pg||
nt|othered1: Or either minor from north|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: 4@S-5@C?|pg||
nt|mamos:  hmmm  not exactly text book 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: if S X - the West could bid 3@h - pass/correct or even 3@S|pg||
nt|othered1: There's a clear warning that bad things could happen in a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: easier to make than to bid|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|othered1: Easy game in NT or either minor, as cards lie.|pg||
nt|dimi: 3nt by E-W|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as to whether it shows any strength, that is a different question |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is a great contract, 5 of either mi also makes|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C over 1@C is natural while 2@D after 11C is used as some artifical overcall|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D - 4@D (with no X) for me is : bid your suit, 4@C = bid belove yout suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I play like you Peter|pg||
mb|3S|nt|othered1: I guess their 3 bids in minors are very sound, suit-wise|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: nice 3@s opening:)he has sequence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My partners never have those suits when they pre-empt, more like Jxxxxx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or Jxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: it's a pretty solid suit, if you ignore the AKQJ|pg||
nt|tez: semi solid..if he has 7 of @s he will get canasta:)|pg||
nt|othered1: EW are now > 30 imps behind in the match.  That may have something to do with the preempt, if they are judging the state of the match correctly|pg||
nt|mamos:  worked out well for East|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 62.1-31, according to the web site|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but will pick up 6 imps here|pg||
nt|mamos:  no one bid over 3s at the other table|pg||
nt|tez: olech says to declarer..i opened 3@s..doesnt matter..put any @s from dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Surprising. Looks a normal-ish raise to 4@S|pg||
nt|mamos:  well 4@H looks good foe NS so EW may have thought they had good score|pg||
nt|mamos:  in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The most common hand pattern (by far) is 4432, around 21% of the time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Goraco back in the match. 11 IMPs on 4|pg||
nt|psridhar: the m/c heard u sadistically jan :)|pg||
nt|tez: dbl is T/O to @c:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Slam can make from North's chair, just not 6@H. 6@D and 6NT are OK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not so good with 5@c on S|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 1 ace and 3 jacks--pass|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psridhar: oh 4-4-3-2 is more freq than 5-3-3-2?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh yes, by a county mile|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me see if I can find a link|pg||
nt|psridhar: rare to see 2nt on 25 hcp|pg||
nt|pelu: NS landed on their feet - the slam is almost impossible to bid|pg||
nt|othered1: NS have avoided the @H trap, which can be apick-up in itself.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|baardolav: Yes... both east and west downsized their hands...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_Hand_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|psridhar: on h lead 3nt may not make so EW may be right dbl dummy|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dimi: true :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Matter of style to me.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, pre-empt in 2nd should have full value|pg||
nt|kubusiu: yes, 3m should be with a good suit|pg||
nt|othered1: KQJ10xxx enough?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, stiff ace|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2@C game-forcing relay I think. Doesn't promise clubs|pg||
nt|dimi: specs told me7 ...true :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6-6 is not even listed|pg||
nt|tez: neck n neck macht .i love it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 no is fine|pg||
nt|tez: 5@d coming|pg||
nt|psridhar: Can make 5h -but will they settle for 500 in 5d X?|pg||
nt|pelu: in NT, @S and even in @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 6nt is best|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because Frank Svindahl is non-Polish|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Norwegian rather|pg||
nt|jtr: But his partner.....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Walddk2: Whether they can find the grand slam is a different issue|pg||
nt|dimi: will they make their way to 7@S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C can be 18+ any|pg||
mb|6H|nt|mdgraham: 4@H would be a nice barrage|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wiankowski needs to find aout about 3 keycards, trump queen and a club control|pg||
nt|othered1: west's isn't an easy hand to bid in any system.  Maybe a strong jump-shift would work.  You'd at least get to whatever slam if partner showed @CK.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now they are all talking, because they get extra for commentating on difficult slams|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And we have two of those and one 6-5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: we had|pg||
nt|tez: i belive he will bid 5@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I am sure Polish players can play other systems too|pg||
nt|jtr: So they could play Standard by West and Polish @c by East:)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so there were about 100 poles and 1 norwegian- and the later won...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Let's see how she shows that now|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@h??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Positive hand with both majors is my guess|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told - tx = 5@s+4@h 5-8 HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  14-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wian will discover the three keycards and @SQ, but what about the C control?|pg||
nt|dimi: grand slam with 26 points always a great achievement!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 13, 14, 16|pg||
nt|tez: 2@c p p 2@d?|pg||
nt|psridhar: once again N is up against it- values that he cannot show opp an o/c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: uh oh, both majors again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He won't win this board I think|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: for sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Possible big swing for Mragowia|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless Gierulski takes the "save"|pg||
nt|jtr: Not teh thing to do when far behind|pg||
nt|jtr: the|pg||
nt|jtr: You forced them to guess with 5@c so why let them off when they guess wrong?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: the problem was the 3 heart bid, east thought more of that than west- noone shoul correct himself after preemting|pg||
nt|jtr: I think Suwik should pass 5@c  6@h is playing poker|pg||
nt|jtr: Which is fair enough maybe|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|mamos:  splinter?|pg||
nt|psridhar: bd17- we missed an opportunity for an interesting defense to 3nt- h lead and DUCKED outright |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6-6 is 0.07%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Bryd%C5%BCowe_tablice_prawdopodobie%C5%84stwa|pg||
nt|othered1: has |pg||
nt|Walddk2: On 17 they found the heart fit in the other room, but they stopped in 4|pg||
nt|pelu: its called Reversed (F)?|pg||
nt|othered1: Can't 4@H be a swing, too?|pg||
nt|tez: 5/3 better than 4/4 here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes Ed, but South is playing it well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he will prevail|pg||
nt|othered1: What was 3@C?|pg||
nt|pelu: a bet? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Search me|pg||
nt|jtr: 3.2345% i am told Roland  Right up your street?:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mamos:  ah game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, he knows that the grand slam is no worse than on a finesse through the hand with more black cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Pass may show three keys|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most pairs play some variant of DOPI/ROPI|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Odd number og keycards I presume|pg||
nt|dimi: NS made life really hard to explore the grand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But can't that be 1?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's see|pg||
nt|tez: they know now minus 11 imp lost on board 4|pg||
nt|psridhar: wd|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: 1N should keep north from having any thoughts of slam|pg||
nt|tomi2: the winner of this match will play against team Svindahl. Their opps already withdraw after 2 segments|pg||
nt|tez: she sry|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|othered1: South's hand is rather good for play in a black suit to open 1N, unless needed to keep the system together.  In natural approaches, it would be a pro-am bid.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 4NT is RKCB, it makes sense to use pass as step 3 - two keys without|pg||
nt|othered1: Is 4N guaranteed to have @S key?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however if pass/double are steps 1 and 2, you need to differentiate between the 0/3 and 4/1 options|pg||
nt|othered1: If not, east might now think he has extras to go on.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My thoughts too, Ed. Can East know that spades are set?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which may not be too easy - so credit to NS for this barrage|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, he knows *now*|pg||
nt|othered1: *Now* he can.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tez: 1nt 2@c 2@s 3@h(any shortness) 3@s/asks) 4@c 4@h 4nt..|pg||
nt|psridhar: bold bidding by N|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N is best (by a lot) isn't it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West is thinking, South is not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You mean 6NT?|pg||
nt|tez: they are playing with screen|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: E: max 9HCP, 5-4 @s-@h, should be str with @C|pg||
nt|pelu: now I see how 4@Hs was making - trick 1; @S lead to J and K - defense didnt get the @SA|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: oh, sry it's W who should be str w @C|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: These considerations come up at committees after west takes a while to bid 6@S.  But they are considerations.|pg||
nt|othered1: Do  you have agreements for handling RKC in the midst of preemption?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe a GF 2NT response (Jacoby-like) is the answer with that hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then there is no ambiguity later|pg||
nt|psridhar: what happened Pepsi? he had a strong team?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|baardolav: Gierrulski is working really hard for this hand... |pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, some strong teams did not make it to the 1/4 finales or lost there|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wd hv put my money on pepsi at start of the tourney|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|psridhar: bidding 2c on an aceless hand and a moderate suit VUL in an auction where no fit was found by oppo was bold enuf-he followed it by a X of 2d also|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: he was sure about shortness in clubs- and he was right- he was sure west to have a good suit- and he was wrong:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: This N-S pair is good. You do not win the Vanderbilt if you aren't. They did in 2008|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|psridhar: yes-they will beat this by one|pg||
nt|tez: pass is ok for you to dbl?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|tez: Ewa is in form this tournament|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The lead was not important as some specs suggest. North could have led his right shoe and still beat it|pg||

nt|mdgraham: you would certainly hope to get there on a free run, but NS made it very hard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Amazing really. Now West has had 6-6 (2), 6-5 and 5-5 in just 7 boards|pg||
nt|tomi2: Gierulski / Skrzypczack alreay won Polish Open Pairs some weeks ago|pg||
nt|jtr: You can get jailed for it|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: only if you throw it|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|psridhar: wild west :)|pg||

nt|tomi2: dbl in Poland in 4th position is often some Kind of "I think this hand belongs slightly to us, lets increase the stacks"|pg||
nt|psridhar: aggressive balancing entry into the auction, no maj fit exists, can get clobbered now|pg||
nt|tez: cash 1 more @s..if t of @s drops..cash @h's..play q of @d.pitch k of @s from dummy |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|mdgraham: 2@d=option 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D artificial game force with 3+ spades|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: missing 2 aces - so no slam here|pg||
nt|tez: nice 6@s only 2 aces left:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: most pairs do not play direct penalty doubles, so if partner has some 14 or 15 points he/she can easily pass. with a week hand they often find a spot to play themselves|pg||
nt|tez: will be end 2@c dbl|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk N will sit for this 1nt X-make overtrick hopefully |pg||
nt|othered1: You were right, south did play 4@H on 17 very well in CR, with a little help from the auction.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: this will h ide north's @S support.  East may bid anyway.|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4 dia and club ace is all EW can get - 380 is likely|pg||
nt|tomi2: this is also a stlye that works out nicely in MP tourneys, 200 will give you a huge top if you time your double well and defend correctly while -180 will be bad of course, but if ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: you make it right more then 50% of the time you will score well|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: there are some players who would NEVER pass now in the East seat...|pg||
nt|tez: Ewa again found best lead:)|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@Cs would make if @DQ drop - 5@D no chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and for that matter, after 1@S-2@s with the West hand|pg||
nt|mamos:  making 2@S looks good from CR|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree on both auctions -- action needed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S  5 cards (I think)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: we will hear the breaks -|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: their auction has given them lots of room here for exploration.  Impressive so far.|pg||
nt|tez: all pass now|pg||
nt|psridhar: and if you combine all those odds in the 4 bds, we may hv a micronic probability event-but it happened now|pg||
nt|tez: 3@d is not my style|pg||
nt|psridhar: flattish 650 i expect|pg||
nt|othered1: and on 17, as has been ponted out, with help from EW, who took no @S trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry have to leave now! thx all and have a nice evening:)|pg||
nt|tez: ty ralf|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S X -1 (100) if the par-score|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: however declarer has to find 3 pitches from dummy..if he retains all clubs , then he may lose a trick-he shd keep 2 spd for 2 finesses|pg||
nt|tomi2: other room had the same start but W escaped and found himself in a not confortable spot|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: and seeing that EW have a decent play for 4@H, perhaps they are right|pg||
nt|kubusiu: running scores: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/soptsrunda1.html|pg||
nt|othered1: I gues their methods require up the line control showing.  At one time, many experts didn't approve of first cue-bids being made on voids, but times have changed considerably|pg||
nt|pelu: if 4NT is a try to get @C in play = a very nice bid, but...?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: You shrug and pass 2@S, Tez?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3@d should indicate a much stronger hand|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: open dards after the opening lead|pg||
nt|jtr: On the last hand, maybe 5@d was right by East?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: I'm told 3@S asks for void.  Perhaps there were other implications to the earlier @S calls.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I see from the web site that there is a 4.1 imp carryover |pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting that South has bypassed 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: if north showed a void, that's a lot of duplication.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did 2@S imply a minimum for the 1@S response, 8+?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8-9 maybe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: do we know if 2@S showed anyhting particular?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 7-9 hcp, thanks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and five spades.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks all :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a little better than 7-9, isn't it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would also pass 2@S|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D is an attempt to get to a better spot, but the hand should be stronger for it in my opinion|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: stoppp|pg||
nt|tez: all cards are right place|pg||
nt|tez: except @d T|pg||
nt|psridhar: u make a bal X of 1nt-find pd with 10 hcp ;a dia suit in an 8 card fit, and in 2D u go for 800-thats the E hand for u :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: When 2@D promises a fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: pd heard the take out X on his right , i bid red suits; he still chose 2s, i respect his decision|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: I'm told, now, that 4@C was just shortness, while 3N would  have denied shortness anywhere|pg||
nt|dimi: well done|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tez: 3@d is invitation hand imo 5/5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT made at the other table on 18|pg||
nt|pelu: so 4NT was just to play - very diff to bid 5@C (and with @DQ10 x in S - same result|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The other room stopped in 2@S, but by N-S :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: with @HK instead of @HA he is trying to get correct count signals|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: this is also the sort of thing you get on Appeal Committees, when North goes on over a slow 4@S. Not that that was the case here, we presume|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: East is not too unhappy|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|tomi2: both, E and W might thimk their partner has the ace so I must show him the cound to make him duck correctly|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|tomi2: he might know the total count of the hand. @S3 suggested 4spades, hearts seem to be 4 as well and after @D3 lead but no continuation @D seem to be 4-4 also|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dimi: will be a fast claim after @d situation is clear|pg||

pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Svindahl, sry|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be but there was a heart fit for sure- so i prefer 5 hearts or a forcing pass|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c6|nt|tomi2: @CQ now by west could make S not finessing spades|pg||
nt|pelu: by 5@C from Olechy sh be naturel and here W could pass|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: possible diamond plays: (1) 2-2. Doesn't matter. (2) 3-1. Cash the ace, or lead the queen to pin the singleton 10 or jack  |pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jtr: Surely 5@d implies a @h fit?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jan Lammerich|pg||
nt|psridhar: the modern theory is the person with values and shortness in oppo suit enters the auction even at some risk|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi all|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S|an| |nt|tez: with open cards yes..what do you put with qjx?|pg||
nt|tez: need partnership agrements|pg||
nt|mamos:  NS open 1NT on quite a fe w off centre hands|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT=15-17|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: cant make game here- 3 club or 3 spades|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt has 8 trick|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: they need 9, or?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D down 2 was worth 7 IMPs for E-W. It got doubled in the other room|pg||
nt|tez: 4@h from Ewa|pg||
nt|jtr: Some action here maybe|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 hearts make|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@h good raise?|pg||
nt|athene: i would imagine this will end in 4@S - these auctions usually do|pg||
nt|athene: it might be hard for anyone to know who is sacrificing|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: doubled or not?|pg||
mb|d!|nt|othered1: Can NS stop in time here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi jan :) |pg||
nt|tez: if 3@s shows @h fit..why not 4@s with west hand..he knows partner has shortness in @h|pg||
mb|r!|nt|psridhar: yes defense is not easy for S to realise declarer has KQ doubleton dia-when a h is played towards tbl, he has rise and lay down dia ACE|pg||
nt|tez: but S has alot of entry..s will be sqz|pg||
nt|pelu: even with @cs 4-1 there are 11 tricks in @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  14-17|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tez: hi Jan|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: x is 4 card major 5 card minor - my guess|pg||
nt|tez: 6 times @c|pg||
nt|psridhar: one chance is all S will get-with 8 toppies E will sneak a h thru|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She's hoping that hearts are running on defence|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Goodbye contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Instant Doom|pg||
nt|othered1: This likely will go quietly, assuming @H9 implies 10|pg||
nt|dimi: unlucky ... 3nt by S is cold|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oh well|pg||
nt|tez: she hopes @h's 2/2|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: west might double, knowing it's a misfit in the minors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@s looks like Smolen|pg||
nt|othered1: showing 4@S and 5+@H, forcing.|pg||
nt|mamos:  North's hand does not fit well with majors|pg||
nt|dimi: anyway good lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now declarer would even get away with Qx|pg||
nt|jtr: South may double this|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so may be a direct spade bid might have been better by south|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you have an angreement about redouble in this auction?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think many have|pg||
nt|athene: i guess if west didn't have the room to find out his partner's minor he would just go with the odds and assume it was diamonds anyway|pg||
nt|othered1: shows @D on my auction|pg||
nt|jtr: "I want to defend"|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: x is interest in doubling them for me|pg||
nt|jtr: Dont bid in front of me|pg||
nt|othered1: but you don't  have that choice to defend yet, they can just sit 2@SX.|pg||
nt|athene: south not at all sure 4@H is making - he does have two aces facing an opening bid|pg||
nt|othered1: My redouble in 2-suited auctions, show the non-promised suit playable opposite, say, xx.|pg||
nt|othered1: or most awkward suit|pg||
mb|4S|nt|janhamhurg: id prefer to overbid in my 9 card spade suit than to defend a game that might make|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or a spade lead??|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: no, but from south's POV, major Js, not really biddable, may be the key.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: From bad to worse, Aus 29-4, Ponting out lbw|pg||
nt|tez: np with @d lead..allways 9 trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: and the @Hsuit may well run opposite xx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only q now is can West make a serious statement about spades|pg||
nt|othered1: will west wonder why east didn't drop 10?  But does it matter?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: @H8 must mean I have good spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that may do it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East knows partner has three cards to choose from|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but sometimes that will cost 200 instead of 100- so you must be right sometimes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jtr: Made the right choice|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be an endplay for only - 1|pg||
nt|jtr: If he gets the @s right he is only down one|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: But, as cards lie, I can't see any play with reasonable defense for 6N.  6@H would have been another story, but why should south assume north is off-shape?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: good news: @hQ was a stopper, bad news @Cs 4-0, good news @DQ drop!|pg||
nt|othered1: bottom line is it winds up being only a matter of overtricks|pg||
nt|tez: king of !k was right..if east has jtxx..you cant get all tricks..but west has jtxx..you can take dbl finesse|pg||
nt|pelu: still I prefer 5@c|pg||
nt|tez: king of @c|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|othered1: Ditto, 6@S.  |pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|pelu: only 4 @ds by opp now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: interesting. The margin at this point is 23 - if 6N makes, it goes up to 34 - if it goes down, it is 12|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And now confirmed as he did not overtake|pg||
nt|othered1: east took the sure beat.  Not ridiculous.|pg||
nt|pelu: 3!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think this is a brilliant defence|pg||
nt|othered1: but west ensured the extra undertrick|pg||
nt|psridhar: a sensible stop in 2nt after tht light opening-shd make on the nose|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but no entree to the spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT as a one-round force has its advantages, but also disadvantages. 1NT sometimes the right contract|pg||
nt|baardolav: think it is one down with correct defence...|pg||
nt|psridhar: wd|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: he should get the spades right|pg||
pc|sT|nt|janhamhurg: spades will be found|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: I like 5@C, too -- shooting fish in a barrel isn't a bad strategy now and then.|pg||
nt|athene: east known to have at least 11 red cards|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d2|nt|psridhar: that defense deserves 12 imps !|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tez: very unlucky for NS..h'S ARE 4/2..@C K OFFSÝDE|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: 1NT is the catch-all response when you play 2/1 and don't have enough to force to game|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East knows that West could have overtaken the heart for a sure one down, so West must have a very good reaosn for leaving him on lead  |pg||
nt|tez: if he cash 6 times @c..it was cold|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos:  not sure ird very unlucky Spades are 3-3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psridhar: i dont see the 2nt making now|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree this is unlucky, but I think, on the NS cards alone, it's third best slam|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|mamos:  sorry it's very unlucky|pg||
pc|d4|nt|janhamhurg: no|pg||
nt|athene: the defence can't get two diamonds and two clubs as well|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|tez: yes|pg||
nt|athene: maybe an initial club lead would have been better, but hard to find unless west specifically showed clubs|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 possible endings with the same result|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: it's funny how these off-shape 1NT openings never quite seem to work out|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|d5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|tez: endplay|pg||
nt|psridhar: he had to start clubs w/o touching dia|pg||
nt|athene: duck the club here endplays west, but declarer could equally well just win the @CA, come to hand with the @S9 and play another diamond - east is known to be out of clubs|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: -100 is good, may be they win some|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|othered1: Plenty of time for EW to find @S fit.|pg||
nt|psridhar: as it happens S had both KQ of spds and was under squeeze-but if spd q was in N, then this test was the best option|pg||
nt|othered1: Perhaps east has extras in their style?  Preempts work against whomever has the balance of strength.  Here it's partner.|pg||
nt|tez: may be east has 2 small @d..not 2 small @s|pg||
nt|athene: the hands fit well, so even the bad trump break shouldn't cause too much of a problem|pg||

mb|4H|nt|tez: give @h..its 9th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: She has tricks opposite a partner who opened at the 5-level vulnerable. If that is not enough for a raise I don't know what is|pg||
nt|othered1: do y ou push them into slam then save?  Not a position that wins over the long run|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: ace of @h lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She has 3 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pikus could kick himself now|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: then it's not semi-forcing, it's forcing|pg||

pc|d6|nt|tez: to 3 nt|pg||

nt|Walddk2: One would expect nothing less when we are in Poland|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|janhamhurg: small to 10|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer gains a tempo - it might have been better for north to split the honours|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he decided the only chance was that declarer would get careless and play the king|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Aren't we just taking about overtrick or not if he gets clubs right?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: exactly- splitting is giving up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @S10 falls|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: This is about as friendly a layout for NS as  you can imagine|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in one of his books Martin Hoffman speculated that Poland has, not the srongest national team, but probably the strongest 50 pairs, on a per country basis|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Zia once said: "No-one can spell their names, but they sure can play"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'm told there are 2 million bridge players in Poland - is that correct? It seems rather a lot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 20,000. Still a large number|pg||
nt|Walddk2: More than 20,000 surely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 20,000 registered players I'm told. May be more than that who play |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|othered1: Can @H plays beat it on an uppercut?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denmark has 250,000 with a population of 5.5 million. 25,000 in the DBF|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even if South doesn't find the club switch there aren't enough tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently you don't have to be a registered player to play at a club.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the Polish bridge magazine sells only 5000 copies a month|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not a great game, but on a good day it makes. Club lead will help|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: nice stop|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bridge is a very difficult game. No-one ever learns it to perfection, just ask Hamman. "Experts are bad, the rest even worse"|pg||
nt|athene: @SQ lead possible; east not likely to have much in spades|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mamos:  wow|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: gosh|pg||
nt|tez: now 5@h means @d and @h..|pg||
nt|tez: brave @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @SK to A, @HQ back - West had better convert this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or even @S10, as pointed out....  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: @HQ back is not so fanciful if 4NT is two-suited, but does need a certain amount of bottle|pg||
nt|mamos:  maybe hard for West to believe Hearts|pg||
nt|othered1: this goes down'on funny @S lead to urge @H shift.  Can they work it out?|pg||
nt|tez: west thking whats 6@d..2 suiter or not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: also West may be thinking that 4NT was meant as ace-asking - if 5@C shows one, then maybe 6@D is to play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a comfortable position|pg||
nt|othered1: Why would 5@C show one with no key suit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, agreed, but you never know|pg||
nt|othered1: true, but that method would make 4N less safe, if ace-asking|pg||
nt|tez: i dont belive 4nt is asking aces|pg||
nt|ritong: no way|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West is taking an awfully long time here - I don't blame her|pg||
nt|othered1: Nor I.  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 6@D seems a gamble|pg||
nt|ritong: she is carressing grand|pg||
nt|othered1: But if they don't have a takeout bid over 4@S other than 4N, how do you handle a great hand?  OTOH, east could bid 6@D directly in that case.|pg||
nt|ritong: west has no doubt about the suits|pg||
nt|ritong: she has a doubt about the level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a lot of correspondence about East's sequence - I'm afraid I don't get it either. Sorry if I can't reply to all|pg||
nt|tez: probably just thinking about 6 or 7 hearts |pg||
nt|othered1: If no firm agreement here, as it looks like there isn't, I don't envy west his problem.|pg||
nt|mamos:  its hard not to fear a disaster|pg||
nt|othered1: Sorry her problem.|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: everybody left the table for a while|pg||
nt|ritong: one of the elements is, even if 7@h is cold, probably 7@s is cheap|pg||
nt|tez: what do you lead from west..2 of @s or q or t?|pg||
nt|ritong: @s Q|pg||
nt|tez: south sry|pg||
nt|othered1: Had east bid a simple, ultrasound 5@D over 5@C, this would have been over quite a while ago.|pg||
nt|tez: against to 6@d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: http://www.msc.com.pl/cezar/    here you can find all bridge players registered in Poland.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Increasingly popular to play transfer responses after intervention|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Some do it all the time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: after 1@C|pg||
nt|baardolav: Have done it for 15 years now...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it won't get that now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Probably a heart|pg||
nt|tez: @h6 ithk|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thought they dont raise on 3 cards that 2s !|pg||
nt|tomi2: the invit did not improve his contract but made club lead unlikely. how often has west qxxx and partner ax and you get a trick / tempo without giving this information|pg||
nt|tez: i m learning polish style leads:)|pg||
nt|tez: they lead 2/4|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, @H6 shows a holdings similar to a stright flush in poker :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: making 3- nothing terrible will happen here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: good decision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I believe the 6 could also be from 7643  or  76x|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trumps 4-0 should not cause problems|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: very reasonable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done West|pg||
nt|ritong: 1) east has not cued @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: 2) maybe the par is 7@s doubled|pg||
nt|mdgraham: she took a long time there, and justifiably so |pg||
nt|mamos:  :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: I wonder what she will think about her partners' bidding.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So they worked for you|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i wouldnt recomend a double with the north hand, but here in poland they can follow with a natural 2 clubs if necessary, since 1 club doesnt show clubs|pg||
nt|psridhar: a popular auction is 1nt-2d-2h all pass; the trf auction here has catapulted them into a perilious 3h..|pg||
nt|psridhar: Boss said prison if u do that :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|tez: @d 7 is suit preferance..that means continue @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She can even afford to cash the ace|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: she already did:)|pg||
nt|ritong: a lot|pg||
nt|othered1: I must tend to some business.  Back next set.  Thanks,e veryone.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: when clubs come in|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos:  she wont care  |pg||
nt|mamos:  just relieved|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now that she can see his hand |pg||
nt|tez: middle if has not honor|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: and 73.1-62|pg||
nt|tomi2: or H6x ot 76 or 86 or 96, but Olech will know bec. S did not bid 3@H|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tomi2: prison is only in France. In Poland you get to prison if you lead high from a doubleton :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dimi: 4@c can be made if you drop K of @c|pg||
nt|psridhar: west had to bid 3h to invite -like in 1nt-2d-3h super accept|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and ns might make 3 clubs- so all fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No need to really if you play 1@H as a one-round force|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Usually with 3 hearts, but can be 4 with an invitational hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk they play 1h as 2/3 cards and 2h as 4 cards and 3h as 4 card invitnal|pg||
nt|psridhar: otherwise no expln for that 3h|pg||
nt|tez: All the good players will play xfer of the responder's suits in the future.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: it works well here since they always open 1 club...|pg||
nt|tez: ace of @c and q from skr..|pg||
nt|baardolav: the day will come that natural rebids will be alerted... And xferbids not...?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Gierulski is a deep thinker, takes time over it-we hv been seeing last 2 days|pg||
nt|tez: doesnt matter here but ..|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|tez: it means leading usually 6|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|athene: sensible play, not rushing for the club ruff - south can't really jump in with the @HA and lead a trump|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tomi2: only danger for east 6 small cards was not possible this time because the 5 was in dummy, so the 2nd would be not the 6 in this case|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: well, if he does, declarer is happy anyway|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: But North could have as few as 2 clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 IMPs to Mragowia|pg||
pc|hT|nt|tez: he will try j of @c i thk later.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: run the @C9 is possible now, even|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|tez: She played safety |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|psridhar: i personally like that 2s, but got scared off by roland that day'|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tomi2: she could claim now|pg||
pc|h9|nt|VugraphP1: she did|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|d2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: south would like to throw the @SJ so his trumps get promoted, but the problem is, that sets up dummy's spades as winners and he can just lead the @S9 and throw his losing club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last set of 12 boards to be played after a short(ish) break. They are on 10 in the closed room|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: *declarer can just lead the @S9, that is|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tez: nice play|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: They are playing rather skowly, so the final has been postponed. 13.30 instead of 13.00, in about 40 minutes|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 9 of spd costs a trick|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Play will resume after a short(ish) break|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the last board of segment 3 |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2sp vs 3 dia here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Almost the end now, so time for a few words of thanks: to our excellent operator Marcin Golinski, and to the Polski Zwiazek Brydza Sportowego. Also to Slawek Latala for helping BBO ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to put on this broadcast.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks also to Roland Wald (Denmark) and Ed Shapiro (USA) for commentary. I am Mike Graham (England). Also thanks to all spectators for some useful and perceptive comments. |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 6 dia is the last chance here:)|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like partscores in major, but ...:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: looks like MRAGOWIA has this match in their pocket now -congrats and good luck in finals|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  includes 18-20 bal|pg||
nt|othered1: NS needs to find the OK slam here to keep their lead.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: We think that tomorrow will start at 9:30 am Paris time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to Marcin, Tez, Thomas and PS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And to the PZBS and Slawek Latala for organising this broadcast|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are still on 22 in the other room|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|tez: cograts to MRAGOWIA team|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mamos:  GF relay|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Yes, 30 mins earlier than scheduled on our VG page|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Oops, and Dimitri Markaris (Germany)|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: This is the last board of this segment. Next in about 10-15mins|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6D will be a gr8 effort but wont fetch 16 imps|pg||
nt|tez: this set was not exciting..but we will see  wilder set coming:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: my- that may end it|pg||
nt|othered1: You should get to this one, unless you count Work points strictly and can find you're a point short.|pg||
nt|tez: ''congrats''|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 tricks a very good effort|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dimi: np :)|pg||
nt|tez: When playing trumps, partner shld be signalled abt preference.|pg||
nt|psridhar: cruel deal for NS - 24 hcp and even 1nt cannot make|pg||
nt|tomi2: what do you think of norths double, vuln?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: style|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: on spec  3 no is great, but will you bid it? seeing 13 cards only??|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt south has any interest in game, facing a passed partner|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so i thk 3 dia is just fine|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tomi2: but svindahl made lots of medium swings, converting a negative carry over to some 30 imps lead|pg||
mb|3S|nt|janhamhurg: 1no is 18-19- will he act with6? yes|pg||
nt|tez: do you bid again with Cich hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: North showing maximum - South declines!|pg||
nt|othered1: That .1 imp is looking increasingly important here :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have just been aksed if QPR will ever get back into the Premier League. If they do, I hope I am alive at the time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this will be 13 - 73.1-75|pg||
nt|ritong: slam is far from cold, here it works ok|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1h-X seems ugly to me|pg||
nt|tez: @d's lost|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: as long as you have 4 spades and  3+ 3+ in the minors its ok|pg||
nt|tomi2: had some conversation with my dad after he doubled on a simila hand (with only 3 spades but non vul, MP)|pg||
nt|psridhar: not in line with the traditional meaning of a take out X|pg||
nt|tez: if you find 6@d..its easy right?|pg||
nt|pelu: sh push with 2@S - can defeat 3@H by a @D-ruff|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: brave- 2 passed hands !|pg||
pc|d8|nt|janhamhurg: 4 spades are very important i thk, otherwise partnership loses faith|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some hands are difficult to handle, like  Qx  AKxx  xxx  AKxx    RHO opens 1@D, what's your bid?|pg||
nt|athene: might hold this to two down perhaps, so -100 instead of -110/130 :) not sure it was worth the effort|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|psridhar: passive lead -works for EW- and a struggle for gierulski|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think 6 with 4333 isnt worth an invitation, but obviously they think differently--|pg||
nt|psridhar: i agree with u jan|pg||
nt|tez: 1@h|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|mdgraham: I'm hoping for another 50 years or so|pg||

nt|mdgraham: this was perhaps not the most exciting set of boards, but it does mean that there is all to play for tomorrow|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1h a lot better than X|pg||
nt|tez: i meant 2@s|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i hear the 1 no rebid is  18-19  or  18 20  or 18 21  all say, i am sure :=|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sorry id prefer to pass|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1NT. It is not modern to lead partnes suits anymore|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tez: spectators  want to see blood:)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|janhamhurg: we will find out in the break!|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I pass|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tez: nice jack|pg||
nt|psridhar: both NS hands 4-3-3-3 ! means no source of tricks|pg||
