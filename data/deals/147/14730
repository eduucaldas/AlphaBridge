nt|babs59: they are Zone 6, RV :)|pg||
nt|barnets: tks babs|pg||
nt|babs59: that's why it's beneficial for Zone 7 to compete.  We are a small zone and very isolated|pg||
nt|rodal f: To drop Q@H ain't as good as A@C in front, BUT tecnical right play. If u drop the QX@H ure home. If not back to the @C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i left the other table since i could not decipher the opening bids|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Bid what you think you can make|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: discussion|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i must admit i did not think of this bid|pg||
nt|cascade: not sure i like it|pg||
nt|babs59: Zone 6 is what I'd tend to call 'south-east Asia'|pg||
nt|davidstern: N/S will have to avoid getting too high in spades here|pg||
nt|rodal f: No much meat at NS here. Even @C is of 4-1 = 35.5%|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: nice 4 @S for n/s here|pg||
nt|henryb:  hard for N-S to get to @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 5@H + 5 minor|pg||
nt|henryb:  not so hard, I guess|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: pass or correct i think|pg||
mb|1N|nt|friggi: should be easy to reach|pg||
nt|cascade: but NZers like to preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 3+@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: but didnt S have exact count on W hand  so @C play was auto?|pg||
nt|babs59: in politically correct terms - Pacific Asia Bridge Federation :)|pg||
nt|kaz08833: what's the point is if EW can make 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: worried about time left|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: brave|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Except for one 2@S by EW on board 24, all contracts have failed.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: here the 2-opening-style worked perfect|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Australia (3rd) are about 35 VPs ahead of NZ (6th) here in the Open competition.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: liu had a tough hand, but this is not an attempt to solve it|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IF you take too long to pass here you make it hard for partner to reopen|pg||
nt|tejjyid: plusthe @S Q is unattractive|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: they all love their hands|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: I dont play 3/2 well with no high cards LOL|pg||
nt|cascade: Stout is on the way to 4@s|pg||
nt|janm: 2@h is 5 hearts and a 4+ minor, I guess - I confess I wouldn't have made this one |pg||
nt|janm: Hopefully 3@d showed both diamonds and a minimum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N would have been 13-15 unless partnership doesn't allow 5422|pg||
nt|babs59: in 2011 the PABF will be held in Macau|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh, i thought he passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: 5-4-2-2 equal minimum - you have to have some standards|pg||
nt|henryb:  although 2@s would certainly work out just fine as a contract|pg||
nt|pelu: @c-lead - normal here - dont work - there are 5 @S-tricks|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cascade: that is what is commonly played|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c/@d = minimums|pg||
nt|janm: Now is 3@s forcing?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not to me|pg||
nt|cascade: and 3@h/@s = maximums with @c/@d respectively|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but then i dont open this crap|pg||
nt|cascade: lets hope not and they have discussed it|pg||
nt|janm: So Miller has shown a minimum, will he decide it's good enough to raise if 3@s isn't forcing?|pg||
nt|cascade: he does have an ace and a fit|pg||
nt|babs59: I have a suspicion that both Zone 6 and Zone 7 will use it for selection purposes for the World Championships|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oops operator |pg||
nt|pelu: now Liu would have prefer to bid 2@s first time - but that risk pass round - do he had to X first|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: he did think|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzkt: sorry a bit sleepy after lunch :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Probably N could have bid 3@s over 2@h to invite in spades, so maybe this should be forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know I do not play their system since that is not a neg X for m |pg||
nt|sybarra: for mi|pg||
nt|rv: Double of 2@c by West is t/o and need not have extras|pg||
nt|pelu: 480|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: need some coffee or tea |pg||
nt|janm: The 2@h bid did keep EW from getting to too many hearts :)|pg||
nt|cascade: there are lots of ways to bid spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shirley -- you mean Hou's DBL?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I would not X with that hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: many experts play this treatment below 2M level after 1M-1N-(2X by opps)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: generally, of course, thinking is a good idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: (or a beer) |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: negative dbl with 4+@H -- what's wrong with that?|pg||
nt|rv: double above 2M level on 1M-1N-(2/3X by opps) is still t/o with extras (15+)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: There are about 8 rounds left; it all finishes on Sunday afternoon (NZ time)|pg||
nt|pzpp: another successful contract is 3NT on board 26, with 3 overtricks:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep-overlooked.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: or rather that was being played at the time of my observation:)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cascade: Lau was undeterred by the hearts sitting over him|pg||
nt|janm: Now, can he make this? Or rather, will he? I'm sure he can double dummy|pg||
nt|jcwla: The one thing they didn't want to do was give up 450 - so instead 500.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: in OR - where NZ has a very strange system - they never found the @s-suit and they sold out to 5@c - NO X in board 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H showed spades i believe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on board 10 open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: that was helpful|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|janm: Or maybe he can't if E puts the diamond K up on a lead towards dummy |pg||
nt|cascade: i think he has to lose at least one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: first off, it is only a 7 count,  pard never knows I have 5 hts.  and never knows to bid them |pg||
nt|rv: North should have surely competed to 3@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. As a spec told me 1-4     4-1=28.3%|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: the problem was they had no idea whose hand it was|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a common problem when you open very light|pg||
pc|h3|nt|friggi: do you agree?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can handle any minor suit rebid from partner too|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|janm: Of course N doesn't know he has spade losers, so is just trying to lose a trick in each side suit and ruff the second club loser|pg||
nt|pelu: playing with screens I dont see that there were a "Break Of Tempo)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|cascade: Chan can Grosvenor now with the @s7|pg||
nt|pelu: EW signals: HL = odd Number|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree with that |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|sybarra: declarer knows well that the club was singleton |pg||
nt|rv: North-South pair not very experienced and probably over-awed by occasion|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Bd 24 very costly to NZ - the dreaded double game swing, when NZ allowed Aus to play in 5C in the other room ..14 IMPs out|pg||
pc|h7|nt|friggi: has to play E for @DK|pg||
nt|alchilds: right pay |pg||
pc|c6|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd hate to pass|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|tejjyid: with screens, probbaly not|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|janm: Now for the bad news|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|pelu: here the 2@H opening = 6 card suit or good 5 card suit|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: If u like % and odds for hook by the %: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm Bookmark this site.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: prefer playing neg free's here, but few folks do....that means under 8/9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: china in trouble again -- on previous hand where 4@H was down 1 --  China in 5@H|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|janm: Those of us who wouldn't have opened 2@h with the S hand can now explain that it would have prevented our side from going down in 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I will say,  I do not strongly object to the neg X,  with single spade,  and the minor holdings   (just dont like the point count )|pg||
nt|ahollan1: get shape across -- let partner worry about points :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Newell has 7@H on table as major pen card|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Amanda|pg||
nt|sybarra: so does that help declarer?  not sure |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: does anybody see a 9th trick?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 3@H ASK stopper for NT|pg||
nt|3for3: Looks like par in the CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and let black suits take care of themselves :)|pg||
nt|3for3: That doesn't feel like the right bid with that hand, but I understand the upside|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: maybe they have an agreement i shows 7+ solid minor and out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Danny -- 2@D just doesn't seem like enough and 5@D too much?|pg||
nt|ritong: why not after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: well, you do need more than just a heart stopper|pg||
nt|ritong: if pard is aware, is no big deal|pg||
mb|3S|nt|geot: 6@H makeable |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: when will that book be available ---  The Science of Bidding 8 & 9-card Suits|pg||
nt|ritong: as soon as written  might take some time, though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i first mentioned it in college -- when i was supposed to be studying a different science|pg||
nt|3for3: are there enough entries to pick up the clubs?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|geot: diamond lead take an entry to N early|pg||
nt|3for3: right|pg||
nt|geot: will get problems to bring in the clubs then, you are right.|pg||
nt|3for3: the 8 of clubs lives to stop the slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: exactly|pg||
nt|3for3: in 6, west might underlead, and south would have to guess to duck it to his Ten!!|pg||

nt|rodal f: @H at top.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: still all smiling|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They dont have any choice:)|pg||
nt|pzpp: EW has a @h game here, but on a non @d lead, they have 13 tricks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I can spel, I just can't type|pg||
mb|1D|nt|janm: DBL or 1@h with the N hand?|pg||
nt|barnets: 6-8 weeks from end feb|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the ill bid and fated 3N brings a welcom 7 to Japan|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the north hand on 11 could justify since attempt to deceive, as with a 2nt response|pg||
nt|jcwla: The @S ruff went bye bye - meanwhile 24 a push at 4@SX making.|pg||
mb|d|nt|janm: I'm a 1@h bidder, but I can see the appeal of DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL [16+ BAL unfav]|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes there are screens and was not a long think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: its the nebulous 1 @D in the precision system |pg||
nt|cascade: me too|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry|pg||
nt|babs59: np :)|pg||
nt|rv: some form of Bergen raise by Peter here?|pg||
nt|babs59: yes|pg||
nt|npcjpn: pass, double or 2@c?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree-@D lead difficult but not impossible.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: P=0-9 or less than 3 controls|pg||
mb|r|nt|janm: I'd think Miller would want to bid 2@h to keep West from an easy 2@d bid; wonder why it took him so long?|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d is certainly a reasonable contract: needs no @d loser or the club finesse and decent breaks|pg||
nt|babs59: Peter's bidding is very straight forward.  I managed to play a tournament with him last year - our first game together in more than 30 years!|pg||
nt|pelu: here a better overcall against 1@c - and in green|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: i would x as south|pg||
nt|rv: I would have Xed from South hand|pg||
nt|babs59: we would all have doubled as South|pg||
nt|kaz08833: EW can make 4@h here but can they bid it?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pass for me or 2c|pg||
nt|rodal f: But by 21NS = 19EW and open from EW.......|pg||
nt|pzpp: 2@d must be waiting, with 2@h as double negative|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|nt|friggi: 11-14|pg||
nt|alchilds: low =1|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be scramble but should be able to find 7 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: playing clubs from the top |pg||
nt|friggi: yes low and play @C for 2-3|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes you just have to hope for the best|pg||
nt|friggi: if dec do so % is very much in his favour|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  but their best result is to double 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Lui hesitated|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Liu|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwi_joker: 2H might be hearts and a minor, 3H now showing a "good" weak hand with hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|pzpp: now, 3@d transfers to @h, wrong place to play the @h contract for more than 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: deep think|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time for another coffee|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: 5@d is an awfully big bid! I know he has a stiff heart, but surely his partner knows it too, since he's heard the opponents bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Jeff may duck a round of spades here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be a easy play.|pg||
nt|pelu: small @c will defeat|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oops-wrong sided.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with winning heart guess|pg||
nt|pelu: the the winning lead - for declarer :(|pg||
nt|pelu: I am glad I dont have do bid 1NT on the East hand - a naturel (F!) 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: was just going to say  not sure if Puppet :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|janm: And even though 2@c was in competition, it should show something, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|cascade: considering he already stretched to 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator alerted for me!!!|pg||
nt|barnets: and all gone minus in 4@C|pg||
nt|rv: inexperience/fatigue showing in Macau's game, it happens to all if you are playing long matches and superior opposition for the first time|pg||
nt|barnets: but thats not the point|pg||
nt|babs59: I feel more like Peng is remembering his 800 - which should have been put aside the moment it happened|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: Thanks Amanda!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so no winning defense, both games depend on hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: but even on a small @C decl can have 9 tricks finding @HQ = 8 in Major|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzkt: np ... 1st time I knew what they were doing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H9 might have been Rusinow -- promising @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way -- my $$$ on defense|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|pelu: bad luck for W - but with @Ds 2-2 or 3-1 4@S X = 500-800|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he thought about ducking might have been best |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C will be very successful choice here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CAce that is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and actually -- then there are 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no @H duck because didn't want @S shift|pg||
nt|sybarra: well its the 5/3 suit |pg||
nt|tejjyid: some reason to downgade (singleton @H) - IMO offset by good intermediates|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kiwi_joker: LOL ..and gets a reward with his 8 scoring!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: oops|pg||
nt|pzpp: 5@h must deny control in @d, with which West will have a convenient cuebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: do i lead my ace ?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rv: Macau is doing reasonably well, 8th place |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cascade: perhaps 3@d was forcing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sigh of relief.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: S not happy|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bravo|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kaz08833: to make 4@h E must play @s now but playing 3@h trump is reasonable|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: think|pg||
pc|sA|nt|janm: Surely not? after the 2@h bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@D would have been a lot better opposite at least one club|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: the winning heart play is both correct initially and on the bidding|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: Liu's 2@H was an underbid|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: since it handles a 4-1 break|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: If he's got 'count' in clubs from Tony, Sartaj should know to take this trick|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: we almost missed it seeing all hands -- Peter Newell found the play single dummy AT THE TABLE|pg||
nt|babs59: they also defeated that 3NT that got thru at this table|pg||
nt|pelu: u are 100% correct - this time :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dJ|nt|janm: The clubs could still be offside|pg||
nt|pelu: better play @cJ|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|henryb:  indeed|pg||

nt|henryb:  maybe|pg||

nt|cascade: the play showed declarer leading trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: in Board 8: taipei in 7@h - and lost @DQ - West had also open only 1@S - with a 4@S-opening more easy to find @DQ - but diff to bid 7 :)|pg||
nt|rv: traditionally Chinese Taipei and Indonesia were top teams in Zone 6, now it is very competitive with China, Japan etc making rapid strides in world bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: risky|pg||
nt|jcwla: That @ST would keep Lord Yarborough from having to pay off 1000-1.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|rv: China is arguably the strongest team in whole of Asia (Zone 4-BFAME, 6-Far East) now|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: This is a real blind spot by Jeff... he should just have continued @Ds ..after that good fortune in the spade suit, he had 5@Ds, 3@Ss and a club for a certain 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 2 tricks in the play and 7 back to CT on 23|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good situation for transfer advances|pg||
mb|2D!|an|3!d+|nt|janm: Well, apparently he somehow made it and now we get to see the Precision 2@c in action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=F1 , 4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=a) 5@H(332)  b) 4441@S c) 2452 d) 1453|pg||
nt|barnets: multi 21D|pg||
nt|rv: some play lebensohl from North hand on 2@h by West|pg||
nt|barnets: south better not pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and we see them, 2@H a constructive spade raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: good pre-empt !|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and not wasted values here |pg||
nt|sybarra: well maybe the q of @D's|pg||
nt|friggi: right, freindly layout and lead as well|pg||
nt|cascade: a subdued Miller and Stout here should win back some IMPs|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, some pressure from N/S.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|janm: Yes, surely he'll make at least 3 :)|pg||
nt|cascade: or rather too much aggression at the other table to wind up to 5@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we may play it here also |pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: now 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well maybe, could simply be a cue raise also|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: he should expect a @s bid after a X|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: friendly|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well forget that statement|pg||
nt|kaz08833: i guess the score is almost tie because Japan will gain another 8 on bd 25|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same bidding so fare|pg||
nt|pzpp: seems that NS plays negative free bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @D Q now, for fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: I like 4@H - 5@S|pg||
nt|pelu: best defense against 2@S is to lead @S4 - but in CR East - absolut normal - played @S A K 4 ( and stole his pds @SQ)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|henryb:  6@s looks like a much better contract|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S|pg||
nt|npcjpn: on this hand, NS can make 3NT, but no way to reach..|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D was different|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: 3@H confirming 5@H along the way to showing max 1N|pg||
nt|rv: yes good auction|pg||
nt|rv: is Peng's 4N quant here?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: hopefully no one leads trumps too soon |pg||
nt|janm: I think a 3@c rebid with the N hand was what pushed them too high - it just has too much in the short suits and too many quacks|pg||
nt|babs59: the other table started with North bidding 2@H - both majors, weak|pg||
nt|pelu: almost for first time EW stepped wrong - down 200/300|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the old surround play|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in college we defined  Down 1 = Good Bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- i was enrolled in college   no - i didn't go to class as often as i went to bridge table|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but we made it thru right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after a mere 16 years|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i made LM in decent time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, Chinese Taipei has cut the deficit by 10 by getting to the @D game on 26 - also making 7.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodal f: Normaly trumh would been the best lead, but E want W to lead that color.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: sorry-some connection.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: some of us "dashed" thru faster than that,  but my father who often was nice enough to pick my up from school always knew where to find me |pg||
nt|rv: I suspect not though it could be for many other partnerships since fit is not found|pg||
nt|barnets: ok well done|pg||
nt|rv: as Barnet suggested, Peng should bid 4@h to show good @s fit, mild slam try|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rv: and his direct 4n should possibly be quant?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|barnets: try and give a ruff|pg||
pc|c6|nt|barnets: looking at dummys diamonds|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb:  @h by E-W should work out well, but you had better correct that|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pelu: hi Amando undo - 61H by N|pg||
nt|pelu: Amanda|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: in OR West bid 3@d|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|nt|barnets: only chance|pg||
nt|rv: as score stands with 1 deal to go, Aus winning match by 21-9|pg||
nt|rv: with only 5 VPs behind leaders Taipei before this round, this win could even more them to first place|pg||
nt|pelu: Yes as Martin say: @DQ is not unly fun - Its the way to pick up @Dj in S|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: Lead @DK to A and now @HA made the play easy|pg||
nt|henryb:  he may go down now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tejjyid: would have been better with the @D 9 tho|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: (student union bridge and euche room)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think only 8tricks - 2D, 2@H & a @S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the srround play looks good, but it eneded up simplifying the hand for declarer|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|henryb:  a lot, in fact|pg||
nt|pelu: need to finess in @s to make|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just follow the highway to the doubblescore|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: *euchre |pg||
pc|s3|nt|rv: sry 22-8 as score stands now|pg||

nt|cascade: well there have been plenty of 8s and 9s the first two days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are occuring too often|pg||

nt|davidstern: But no easy road to get there|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: and of course great thx to our specs, for the helpful (and sometimes humorous comments |pg||
nt|janm: Lau chose the latter course (when I'm playing that 4 of a minor is natural, I love to be able to open it)|pg||
nt|davidstern: North will make a move and South has a max perhaps they will find it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the real problem was a substandard neg double|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  another ambitious 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remaining matches for the day are posted now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next will be Open: Australia v China Macau   Senior: Indonesia v New Zealand (Cornell)|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: 2 matches tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thx :)|pg||
nt|pzpp: 2 matches tomorrow? I think that they have 3 left|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thought there were only 2 could be wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: ah, the hand that needs the heart shift|pg||
nt|cascade: an interesting point is that I think that dealing programs need to have published their algorithms to allay suspicion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing 2@C = weak @C + another|pg||
nt|davidstern: There you go|pg||
mb|2C|nt|henryb:  on 24HC with no particular source of tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still a few boards to be played and scored in the open room|pg||
nt|davidstern: So this should be 7 imps to Indonesia assuming 0-1-4-5|pg||
nt|davidstern: For ten tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: A sac at 5@C but 5@H also on|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: overtake and heart seems right|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: i am booked to do 2 :)|pg||
mb|2D|an|5!h|nt|friggi: my guess was 3@C 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: quick shot of something then for you....(what ever that is) |pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 to Indonesia on 27 when Liu failed to lead A and a @S at T2 against 5@DX.|pg||
mb|p|nt|alchilds: my too may go set|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, and maybe the spade 10 should suggest shifting to a heart?|pg||
nt|pelu: again the 1NT 6-12 created the problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid -- 1st DBL = PEN  2nd DBL = Takeout [i think]|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Dont understand, if cant x 3@C bid 3@S:)|pg||
mb|2H|an|2/3 !h 12-14|nt|fabsayc: this event is really too long, we have to realize how long everybody has already been playing|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Guess not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think any spade but ace is really wrong|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, they're not going to beat 4 whatever they do|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did Caledonia steel candy from the opps?:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Me or your lying eyes?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: last board and some laughter here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|friggi: needs @H play from Dec, diff to find|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is will play @D up from hand |pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was 13-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S shift is killer|pg||
nt|sybarra: can China make a profit here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  this one needs 3@c tricks, a reasonable shot, and either 4@h and 2@s or lots of spade tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: in normal system u would pass 2@S|pg||
nt|rv: this should make 9 tricks even with likley @s finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: best lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  My stomach is growling, so I will leave you. Have fun, and thanks, Peter|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: long explanations|pg||

pc|c3|nt|cascade: For those kibitzers who are interested in chess|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: absolutely -- i was thinking best defense 300|pg||
nt|rodal f: 22-19 after this board. Then OR left to change the result|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|rv: my thanks to excellent Vu graph operator and wonderful co-commentators Barnet Shenkin and Barbara Travis|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|rv: also a word of appreciation to Roland Wald who organises all these Vu graph broadcats and BBO management for telecasting it live|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: good match|pg||
nt|jcwla: NZB even.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: maybe 500 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: E could have got a ruff|pg||
nt|rnmalik: By play small @S-guts:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no after Q@d|pg||
nt|pzpp: the double of 2NT normally shows interest in penalty on at least one of the minors contract, since he does not want to double 3@c, 3@s sounds much more reasonable than pass|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: they are all packing up here instead of playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: now E thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: motionless|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|janm: Interesting how many people are good at both games|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: there is a dealing program written by a norwegian|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which produces a lot of wild hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like that program|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is used by some of the dealing equipment|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so wherever the equipment goes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and i am totally convinced the hands are not random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the technical term is pseudo random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in a run of say a million hands it should converge on the theoretical odds |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: romm will stay open unti scores are finalised|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H10 would have been very trusting - an maybe worthy of write-up|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting position now however |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D best|pg||
