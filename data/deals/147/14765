nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|henryb:  back to 17|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: this may be first ones to one nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Al Hollander|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: another set with the "fun" systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect a LOT of alerts for NS system   Forcing 1@C, Transfer Openers [aka submarine]|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|henryb:  A partscore battle, with N-S aboe to make 4@c and E-W 2@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: And this time, it's also probbaly the battle for 2ndplace as well|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|henryb:  I would expect the auction to start P-P-1@s-some bid showing @h& a minor |pg||
nt|henryb:  wrond again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=NF, ART, 8-11 HCP, 3@H  [maybe min, 4@H]|pg||
nt|sybarra: al,  are e/w playing precision? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shi-Hou are playing Precision -- i was just typing that Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: for those watching,  this will be a lot of artificial bidding,  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi everyone welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: hi|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: both pairs at other table also playing Precision variant|pg||
nt|sybarra: only used with experienced partnerships and 400 pages of system notes|pg||
nt|henryb:  The Australian pair clearly do not play strong club|pg||
nt|rodal f: N for the first take out.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: ok maybe only 385 pages|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards -- and some supplementary notes - online under http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Open.aspx|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|sybarra: might N sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is he bidding  1 nt |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this seems rather high|pg||
nt|rodal f: Teyssier was cold:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: must say I am not a fan of sitting at imps|pg||
nt|jcwla: D/K if this is the dummy N is expecting, but it's not enough.  This is down a couple.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  clearly 1N was forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid's 2@D bid doesn't seem to fit the explanation I gave -- but i got if from their notes |pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|vugraphzkt: good morning all|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rv: Hi all, gm from sunny bangalore in South India|pg||
nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Good morning|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rv: Hi Rodal|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|janm: EW will probably end in 4@s on this one, and should make it unless NS get 2 club ruffs - I guess 5@c is actually better, let's see if West will show his club support to get there|pg||
nt|janm: This auction might get them to 3NT, which would not be a success|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Open Room starts play with board  29 -- so they will see results from us|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure who do bet on here,  defense if @H start I think|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb:  the two-step probably shows constructive values|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mwigor: hi all|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like a save v 5@H|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: we can only peek at their [and any other vugraph table] using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|henryb:  We do not have an auction, but at the other table West over reached to 4@s and caught a vey bad dummy|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Hyper-agressive bidding by the NZ  north-south in the other room propelled the auction very high, very quick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6@d in the 4-3 fit looks OK to me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6NT you can make with the right guesses as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think by Tony|pg||
pc|s4|nt|janm: Perhaps if W bid 3@c here, E might retreat to 5@c, but West decided his suit was good enough to play in, and with the @h A lead, he'll be right, I think|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this match is 1st China-Taipei vs 5th Japan|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|tejjyid: The auction looks a bit murky, Nunn calrifies it for us|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: ..and in the end they got the outcome they wanted (opps made the last mistake!)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a passive @S lead & East will be very happy|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tejjyid: Thanks for coming...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|d5|pg||
nt|barnets: @DK|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|barnets: may have worked|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: likely 300 for NS -- i'd feel good bringing that score back to the table|pg||
nt|barnets: as if east had rufffed with the 9 dec would crash the spade honours|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|henryb:  Nasty breaks on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is the 1st of 12 matches for Round Robin  2 -- results aren't posted yet from RR1, but the rotation for RR2 is based upon final tally|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: 1nt had been a nice contract - but prob forcing - but even then I would have passed in S (pd is a passed hand)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|henryb:  I do not know why East wanted a club; a heart would have been more useful|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: results site is http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not much fun discarding from the N hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: the Juniors are playing this in 4@CN|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: part score battles are worth a suprising number of imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Sorry was away from table :(  Will record a claim shortly|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6-8 for a double part score swing mounts up real quick|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c6|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: 13th @H might have worked well there|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|henryb:  this will drift down one, but slowly. As I have observed before, no one ever goed dowd wuickly|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i should say if you RESPOND to 1@H|pg||
nt|geot: I@S, but really stuch if pd bids 2@D|pg||
nt|geot: stuck|pg||
nt|geot: I will pass 2@D in that case|pg||
nt|geot: But I would pass 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe    i was typing   "easiest to PASS"|pg||
nt|geot: yes:)....but if you bid on hands similar to this, I think bidding the major is the best. Might work even if partner bid 4@S|pg||

nt|sybarra: -1 not the end of the world here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: missed opportunity, but any plus may be good on that board|pg||
nt|barnets: would hav been a nice try|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi RV:) And welcome. Long time ago.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A easy 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-15 HCP, a) 5+@H  b) 4441@D |pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: this tourney is played in double round robin format with no subsequent play-offs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: feel free anyone to commentate|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: can W stay in his seat |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes seems so |pg||
nt|sybarra: "stay in his seat" as in pass|pg||
mb|2H|nt|henryb:  6@h is a reasonable contract, needing 2-2 hearts or stiff queen|pg||
nt|henryb:  and no club ruff on lead|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Miller-Stout play precision.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It's irrational, but I bet Nunn & Hans feel a warm fuzzy feeling inside after the good start|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: wow  last hand Chinese Taipei Juniors 4@C made 5 |pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: interesting choices for Shi over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N, trap pass, 3@C [@H raise], 2@D all seem to have merit|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe tryingn to get the @D suit in before the ht raise |pg||
nt|henryb:  with various conventions of their own, such as this 3@d bid to show a gf raise|pg||
mb|4S|nt|frankaus: green V red usually a go signal :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes thought he might come in  but suit is a bit tacky |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is we are in game force sequence here|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: and protecting against opener having the 4441@D hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Hou pulled out the 4 @s card then changed his mind|pg||
nt|tejjyid: BTW, anyone who wants to jump in and advise me I'm an idiot, do feel free|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
nt|jcwla: N's negative double showed the minors.  Now you see the problems with 2@S:|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: One, it gives the opponents two levels of room; two,|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: Not sure about 4@H, as Miller still apparently had the K@S to cue|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N is probably a "serious slam try, while minor suit cues would be "courtesy"|pg||
nt|rv: yes cold, @h8 ensures a stopper and only 4-0 @d break offside can trouble this contract|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'll feel like I'm back at the bridge table|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: the more the merrier|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: i expect this will fail|pg||
nt|janm: Looks as if NS can make about 3 hearts (maybe 4) and EW can make about 3 clubs.|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have an easy partscore in clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: Basis system: NS: Precision @c and EW: 5 card major with weak and strong NT (green-red)|pg||
nt|jcwla: it now gives E something to think about when a huge chunk of the strength of E's hand is a @S void that's of no use in defense to 4@SX.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: needs the spade lead,   should be -1 |pg||
nt|janm: Let's see if EW can get the spade ruff to beat this. If W leads a high club, E can overtake to lead a spade back|pg||
nt|janm: But on the trump lead I think NS are going to make 4 hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D is a mystery|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tejjyid: what a nice system - pay in 8 card @D fit at 2 level |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no warm fuzzy things running around the table (yet)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|henryb:  I recently saw a study suggesting that with 4-3-3-3 opposite 4-4-3-2  you should not try for the 4-4 major suit fit|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Other room just started to bid Bd 18|pg||
nt|henryb:  Oh? I thought they went back to play 29 and 30|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|frankaus: has a chance but its really tough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Safe for a try by 10 tricks now.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rv: now 10 tricks possibly|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: would have to magically read the club suit I think |pg||
nt|janm: So we've had two hands in a row where the best defence would be to take ruffs.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if i would have been any better off with 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: well it both sounds like they have an ace the DO NOT have |pg||
nt|barnets: i think south should x and north bid 3@C|pg||
nt|pelu: very nice contract if @Hs was running - or even 4-1|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: (imho)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E figures to be short so playing 9@S there would have been a decent shot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Nobuyuki Hayashi|pg||
nt|tejjyid: probably a bit early for the warm fuzzy things|pg||
nt|jcwla: E has made the trusting decision and will be rewarded.  @H's E/W have three losers off the top.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|frankaus: now @C was req|pg||
nt|pelu: I see the point - but how do u know that ps has 4-4-3-2 :)?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am however convinced that it is losing bridge in general to bid game with two balanced hands and 24 HCP|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Wang Zhi-ge|pg||
nt|tejjyid: they like to sleep in|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: Reid checks to see if 2 tricks is enough to beat 6@H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: might he be concerned spade is cashing?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Hello from Hamilton.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H lead is bad idea now however |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|sybarra: Reid might have also been checking backs of cards to see if they match |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: N and E starting taking the bidding cards away before Reid had a chance to X|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told neither NS player is known for being pessimisstic -- @SA not cashing would be way beyond that description|pg||
pc|d3|nt|janm: Of course S doesn't know for certain that the spade A is onside |pg||
nt|pzpp: E-W here just bid to an unlucky game in NT, with almost every card placed badly for them|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rodal f: ? 9 u have. By the @Shook u still have 9 if it loose.|pg||
nt|rv: Check this url http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html for all the latest standings|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Rashed Nabi Malik|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I confess I'd also open 2@s with the S hand - everything is right - vulnerability, position, spades being the highest suit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Ino won the senior teams in Bejing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice to have RV here. All info comes:) Local time here is 0530 but free today:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Of course now that 2@s has been alerted, it probably showed 5 spades and a 4 or 5 card minor, so wasn't even wrong on suit length, but I think it would be right to open it even if ...|pg||
nt|janm: it was just a weak 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same 1@H explanation as last board|pg||
nt|npcjpn: This year, he plays in open.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Great result there for Indonesia.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|barnets: a heavy 2N|pg||
nt|barnets: with 22 hcp and good 5 card suit|pg||

nt|barnets: 13  tricks without club lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: ok now can e/w find and make slam? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: notes say Newell has 6@S --- i believe the notes|pg||
nt|sybarra: or can they really make 6 @D without help?|pg||
nt|henryb:  we changed boards all of a sudden|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: the match to watch|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@H was Mm 2-suiter, weak (youcouldguess, right?)|pg||
nt|jcwla: 20/20 hand here - always want to post the plus on these.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|barnets: east is marginal for a 4N raise|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cards are nicely placed for NT.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like "single suited"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is W can tell which suit |pg||
nt|frankaus: sys on  here is normal these days with X replacing 21C|pg||
nt|janm: N probably has a good idea that his partner's second suit is clubs and so won't be useful, but it's certainly possible to envision game anyway.|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT on @dQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  2N clearly a @s raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes and systems on= transfer in this case |pg||
nt|ahollan1: interference will slow down EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: with bidding opps suits |pg||
nt|rv: Hi Barnet and all specs|pg||
nt|barnets: hi|pg||
nt|rv: it is 9 AM IST here in India which is 4.30 hrs ahead of London time at this time of the year.|pg||
nt|pelu: A problem for E - this bidding could in precision be on 11+5|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: hard to believe both red suits behaving favorably -- and will probably misguess both Qs anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: olmost certainly its @H now that S trans to @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and wrong colors to be stepping in with 3 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry with 3 @C I meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I don't know what options he had to invite over the DBL (surely 3@s was not invitational). I think S is going to come to 10 tricks, and he'd probably have accepted most ...|pg||
nt|janm: invitations, with maximum values and good spots in both suits|pg||
nt|tejjyid: nothing very frightening about this contract, orindeed 4@H|pg||

nt|rv: after 6@d, can North consider an attacking lead?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not much to the play here worst he can lose 3@S 1@D|pg||
nt|pzpp: yes, and the lead helps declarer ahead in the race for tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: same strat as the bidding in Board 1|pg||

nt|henryb:  3@c is a non-standard rebid -- and since I do not have the CC handy, I cannot tell you what it shows|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|frankaus: 5 imps to NS here|pg||

nt|rv: N-S are close to making 10 tricks in @h strain|pg||

nt|fabsayc: does not meet my standard, but i might do it anyway|pg||
mb|1S|nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||

nt|cascade: 3@c will be invitational with hearts|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably 3@c shows some sort of heart raise|pg||
nt|cascade: and Miller finds himself with a surprisingly good hand for all of the bidding so far|pg||
nt|janm: Everyone has different approaches to Unusual, but as far as I know everyone plays that the cue bids show partner's suit and the 4th suit (although some of us use one and some the ...|pg||
nt|janm: other for those meanings)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may be too hard to find|pg||
nt|rv: French Polynesia is doing a lot better than New Caledonia in this tourney|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: yes there are various ways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure about 4@C|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, especially with partner bidding 2NT vulnerable, Miller must wonder if his side has a game|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c tied to hearts and 3@d tied to spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a transfer over the transfer|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looks like Michaels.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: and it is precision  (just not sure which variety) |pg||
nt|frankaus: communications wont be easy |pg||
nt|cascade: personally i play the lower cue agrees partner's suit and the higher is the other suit|pg||
nt|janm: As it is, it's pretty unlucky that 4@c goes down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=FG, 8+ HCP, 5+@D|pg||
nt|npcjpn: dbl = 3-card support?|pg||
nt|henryb:  the black kings are well placed foe N-S|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@H = @s - and 7+|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@H/@S available for EW.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a vey SOUND 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Nt for NS = 12-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: but np for 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is not why i am not sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry wrong cc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=FG, 10+ HCP, 3+ CNTRL [A=2, K=1], 1-suit, 6+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H RELAY|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have good save in 5@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd suit or repeating the transfer?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: i bet second suit.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H is preemptive.  2@C is truly moth-eaten on a quacky min and a 5-bagger.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H=7@D 0@C 33  [or (23)80, 2290]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just what Newell wanted to hear :(|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are those 15HP wourth 1NT?  Ok. I use to do the same:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|friggi: transfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: the good news is E (or W) will have to lead something |pg||
nt|friggi: thne 3H then 3NT|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl tr|pg||
nt|frankaus: first 9 is on top then it gets difficult|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it might get you way too high and also misdirect the lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not agree with 3N: I think that should show tricks, and 2N should show 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|henryb:  that assumes you open 1N with all balanced 15-17|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT here is 6-10, so Why bid 2NT?|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is the only lead to beat 6N|pg||
nt|pelu: No they play 11-14 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell has extra King for his 1st seat 1@C -- but can't imagine anything other than 3N now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N is discouraging, but since Reid unlimited it is not pure signoff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Liu still has chance to splinter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: EW have ended in 5@H on  18|pg||
nt|rv: FP is lying 8th and NC is lying 13th out of 13 teams with 3/4th of tourney over|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@s easy slam to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good afternoon from partly cloudy vancouver|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: nice of @D's to break |pg||
nt|barnets: but never bid|pg||
nt|barnets: only -200|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S0single and force til min 4@H|pg||
nt|rv: I might have opened 1@d and rebid 1n with north hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cascade: Jan tells me she plays the cues the exact opposite way to me|pg||
nt|cascade: the most important thing is that you have an agreement with your partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 3c for hearts, 3d for spades is the most common|pg||
nt|janm: This time we have a game where the declaring side will need ruffs (diamonds) to make it, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S asks controls   A=2 K=1|pg||
nt|rv: North could have chanced 3@c with enough distribution though suit is not good at these colors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: slam chances looking rather slim|pg||
nt|npcjpn: yes, that's I am afraid of.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he's done it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Chung now has a Powerhouse|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: twin 50's on 18 to Japan for 3 imps|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4@s, just splinter? or exclusion RKCB?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I hate the pass of 2NT here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cascade: and the defense have ruffs to beat it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the hand with void gets to declare?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: contemplating 5@C opposite @SK and @HA?|pg||
nt|barnets: he also may have tried 3@C over 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 2@h alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: laughing :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|janm: Although if he takes the club finesse he's been offered (right you are that the club bid got them off to the wrong lead), he can pitch the diamond losers and then just needs to ...|pg||
nt|janm: avoid a spade ruff (or S needs to figure things out and give his partner one, which may be hard)|pg||
nt|janm: So that will be a third hand that could have been defeated by a defensive ruff |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if so then pass =3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 for @H switch, is it?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|frankaus: a not so obvious @D lead/switch can couse lots of communications problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead gets a bit messy |pg||
nt|rv: West opening is post-modern, I like his raise to 2@s with 3 card fit instead of 2@d|pg||
nt|pelu: Wellcome to Martin Johnson from Canada|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|friggi: no problem. play for @D 3-3 |pg||
nt|pelu: so 2Nt would be 16-17 (18)|pg||
nt|rv: all of us like to upgrade the hand more often than downgrade, here North hand is clear candidate to downgrade|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: i think in new zealand would be simpler to alert natural bids|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: interesting -- could only do that because of @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: glad i'm not at the table -- as declarer i'd go into long tank because of too many possible lines|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nice bidding.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should be a formality to make it now, wd|pg||
nt|pelu: agree - 2NT is a bid u dont play - either 3Nt or 3@c|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: How may HP would u have shoved me by that sequense RV?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|henryb:  because I think you need 3N to show a very different hand: say Ax, xxx, AKQxxxx, Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a) @S ruff  b) @SQ @CAK float @DQ c) @SK then ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5@CX on its way down three - would be even from S.  Was all set to praise S's discretion.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: where grant showed four spades is unclear|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 rounds of bidding - just to miss a laydown slam :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: bids being explained|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in my methods north bids 2@S over the tranfer advance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so we can focus on slam bidding rather than game|pg||
nt|pzpp: I think that they play UDCA, just discourage|pg||
pc|hK|nt|janm: Declarer going after those diamond ruffs - but that will probably make it easier for S to realize he needs his partner to have a spade ruff coming, won't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but as he did not discard a diamond i dont see how defense can go wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told: 1@S = asking bid in @s, 2@D = 5 card !, (2 top) 2@H asking in @h - 2@S no @h-control|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu: but 3@c would prob be X - so...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Thanks PEter, you have precisely expressed my view NT isinv/forc|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jcwla: Turns out, eleven tricks is a lot.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Less that 15-17?|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@d ask in @d - 4@C = A x(x)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|janm: I think S has to play A and a spade here, doesn't he? |pg||
nt|cascade: he doesnt have many options|pg||
nt|cascade: he would have been better to not overruff but he didnt know that his @hK was always a winner|pg||
nt|rodal f: tan*|pg||
nt|rv: I presume South would have invited even after 1@d-1@h-1n and N-S would have reached game|pg||
nt|rodal f: than*|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: even heart heart beats it|pg||
nt|janm: I don't know, it might be tempting to assume that West was doing the right thing and so it's necessary to play trumps to stop the second diamond ruff|pg||
nt|cascade: that works too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh maybe not south will be endplayed|pg||
nt|janm: I think he can make after heart & a heart, can't he - lead a spade to the K, which either gets him to dummy or endplays S|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile there has been way too much of this "pass and come in later" in this event -- bid it up NOW and give them uncomfortable decisions, not fielder's choices.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: as long as club ace still in dummy|pg||
nt|janm: If N leads a club now, declarer has to ruff, not win the A, which may not be clear|pg||
nt|rv: With West hand, I prefer to rebid 2@d and subsequently bid 2@s or 3@s with extras (14+)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Al|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this leaves a whole lot of strength issues in doubt|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pzpp: ?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cascade: a heart gets him home|pg||
nt|pelu: u also need 2NT to show 16-17|pg||
pc|d3|nt|friggi: wrong line|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like that a ballanced 16 HCP-hand take command|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|pelu: better take @cK now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|frankaus: trouble brewing|pg||
nt|henryb:  now declarer should draw trump and play a @d to the 9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north hand too flat and too minimum for asking bids to be effective|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: he had to overtake|pg||
nt|cascade: if he guesses the spade|pg||
nt|janm: No, maybe that won't work - on a clulb at this point, he can ruff, but then has to cross to the heart J and won't have a way back to his hand. But on this return, he can ruff the ...|pg||

nt|fabsayc: so the asking bids are in a range context|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 1m - 1M - 3NT is the hand u show|pg||
nt|ahollan1: TRF |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Looks like Norths diamonds vs the opps respective hearts and spades in this one|pg||
nt|pzpp: agree, players just think for a long time, then play like zip,zip, zip|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: they do not always show their cards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: np-look what a hand anything beyond 5@C by NS, the trouble starts.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|friggi: play E for High @S |pg||
nt|friggi: let opps play @H|pg||
nt|barnets: i prefer that yes|pg||
nt|barnets: too strong for 1N|pg||
nt|henryb:  North's diamonds do not win the battle|pg||
nt|tejjyid: may be tough to decide though|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what system for new zealand|pg||
nt|janm: Also hard for N to realize that he needed to play the second club to cut declarer's communications :) (I'm not sure why declarer had played the heart ten though - if he hadn't he'd ...|pg||
nt|janm: have been able to overtake the heart J)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 4@S by E has chances but the bad break should scuttle it|pg||
nt|pelu: no - I am old Acol-player, so distribution forst - that can improve a hand - and then cue/asking|pg||
mb|3C|nt|friggi: @C lead not enough|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you ever super accept with weaker nts?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont play them, so just asking |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just going to say that Newell COULD have bid 3@H as SSGT super-accept  [short suit game try]|pg||
nt|sybarra: for an older person such as me,  I would have to do too much "re-thnking" of system |pg||
nt|henryb:  Is 2@d a transfer or an amorphous force?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S ok by 100% hit by the guesses. Might 3NT is better. But....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT an easy make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: South will pass here in all likelihood, if he had Inv strength he would have Xed 2@c to set up forcing auction till 2n|pg||
mb|3D|nt|janm: Can't tell from the auction, can we? 1@c was alerted, as was 1@d. I'd have said we still didn't know from the alert to 1@c, but probably now it was a strong club and negative ...|pg||
nt|janm: diamond - still not certain|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am told precision|pg||
nt|janm: And what was 2@c by East?|pg||
nt|henryb:  West now emerges with 3N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i started old -- thinking systems has helped me regress|pg||
nt|sybarra: One Kib suggested bidding  3@H over 2@H (4 crd support, xx in @H)|pg||
nt|barnets: so n/s miss a decent game patly as a rsult|pg||
nt|rv: South chose to pass 2@c and subsequently 2@h since he suspected misfit|pg||
nt|rv: at MPs, many of us would act with South hand|pg||
nt|barnets: cant see why south did not bid 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: the latter i believe|pg||
nt|rv: not my choice for 2@c opening if it shows strong hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: still, perhaps theywill explore for 6@D and stop in !5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Uncomfortable decision now for S -- has alerady seen a much better 6-card suit than this go for 800 a level lower.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: certainly gave S, someproblems |pg||
nt|npcjpn: Facing passed partner?|pg||
nt|pelu: here my "favorit" convention (when opp play): 1NT F1 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: the mistake was made by N leading @H after overtaking|pg||
nt|sybarra: N was dummy |pg||
nt|friggi: sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: just "followed suit" |pg||
nt|friggi: dec|pg||
nt|pelu: almost 8 playing trick - and good gamble here|pg||
nt|barnets: at any scoring|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|janm: After a strong club and negative diamond, I'd have thought 2@c would be natural|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not forcing, was passed hand|pg||
nt|pelu: are u sure -they have some support-hands in 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and another challenging hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: easier for us than at the table|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, sure it is|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, this won't make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well i am just saying i dont play it forcing in this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: apparently natual is passe|pg||
nt|pelu: here pd had the cards he need: @S-stopper, help in @H and 3 card @d so the suit is running|pg||
nt|tejjyid: to Nunn, the @H & @C valuesall look wated|pg||
nt|tejjyid: wasted|pg||
nt|pelu: Its a real top-match, Australia no 2 and Indonesia No 3, Taipie No 1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: natural|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have the balance of points and the spade suit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: at least undoubled:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't like a system where West can't show the @D support on this hand though|pg||
nt|pelu: results: http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html |pg||
pc|s7|nt|rv: good lead giving nothing away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is one 10 in hearts from a decent game|pg||
pc|s5|nt|friggi: that is nice:)|pg||
nt|janm: The bidding is more interesting than the play on this hand. It's out of our "ruffs to beat" set of hands, just a boring 10 top tricks, 3 losers |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no emotion shown !|pg||
nt|pzpp: facing 3NT, Lin had a big decision to make, his hand appears to be sourceful of tricks, just need a good @c suit and @s control to envisage slam|pg||
nt|pzpp: not sure of their agreement here, is 4NT just a general interest and natural invitation?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: ask about the 3@s bid|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: playing J to see if he can get accurate count |pg||
nt|pelu: yes missing @H10 not so bad - need a @c-lead to defeat|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pzpp: 3@s could be just a cuebid for @s stopper for NT purpose|pg||
nt|rnmalik: all cards badly placed, other than missing 2Aces, the Q@H.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes opps were asking|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s4|nt|friggi: this line is better the play for 3-3 @C|pg||
nt|friggi: then|pg||
nt|janm: I'm told that 2@c showed either diamonds or the Majors|pg||
nt|rv: declarer can still mis-guess all suits, generally trump lead is worthwhile if 1 hand is known to be very strong|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IMO, 3@D is mandatory aafter 2@S - assuming it's GF|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|rv: if South doubles 2@C and subsequently bids 2@S it is likely to be forcing, passing 2@c and bidding 2@s should be NF|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rv: South took conservative route since he suspected misfit/bad breaks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cascade: suction|pg||
nt|pelu: I play 2@S FG, and then 3@D id the obvius bid over 2NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: me to|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, 17 and 18 have come in -- 17 just 2 to Indonesia for staying a level lower in @H's, but 18 the big one: 14 to Indonesia for 800 here and 100 in OR against 5@HX.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Those are the type of boards that decide IMPs matches.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 10@s played in error, penalty card|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: that has the unattractive name of suction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- i think that's what I said Shirley -- but it is not obligatory [especially with min]|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|frankaus: g2g tu all|pg||
nt|pelu: @s3 is not the system card: 1. signal Low-High = even|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: buti once played fit-showing jumps as well, so I couldstart with 2@H|pg||
pc|s9|nt|tejjyid: That's a good method, but it doesn't happen often enough to take up a whole bid|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: Taipei bid the slam and found their 6 trick against 3@H = 8 + 13 IMP|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|pzpp: to make the hand, declarer may have to take @h finesse to dispose his 1d duece|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pzpp: @d2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The squeeze may come handy-all three vital cards are in one hand that is W.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h9|pc|c8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|friggi: good def|pg||

nt|ritong: mm|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: Danny -- you aren't the only one who mentioned Steve there|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: but here we're in context of precision  where 1@D=1+|pg||
mb|r|an|3 crd !h|nt|3for3: and it seems to work well here, catching 4 card support|pg||
nt|geot: South has a huge hand, and in the CR he bid 5@C over 4@S in the second bidding round. No success.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when i open 1@S -- partner's pointed suits are flip-flopped|pg||
mb|2S|nt|3for3: I'd start with 2@C then double later.  More flexible to END with double :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: claro que si|pg||
nt|geot: 3@S pre-emptive. Huang hopes for an ace with partner, but anyway 4@S is ok.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: same auction. Most likely push, but there are only three top losers. |pg||
mb|3S|mb|4C|nt|3for3: when declarer tries to draw trump, his heart ruff in the dummy disappears.  can still guess hearts for 1 loser though|pg||
nt|geot: I am counting one in trumps, not practical to solve that one....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since this is public forum i don't think i'll admit i would NOT open 1@S|pg||
nt|ritong: mm...say you draw two trumps|pg||
nt|geot: We will win 5@C:) seeing all the cards.|pg||
nt|ritong: then a top @h|pg||
nt|ritong: after that, a @h to the 8 caters with all, seems|pg||
nt|ritong: but declarer might go for @h Qj bare|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: which would have made him make the contract|pg||
nt|ritong: he does not know for sure, east could be just 5/5|pg||
nt|geot: ooops.....closer now|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: to solve trumps. Then he will solve hearts too|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: digression:  in the U26 match  after 4 comparisons Australia 15  Singapore 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they began the match with Austalia leading by 1.33 VPs|pg||

nt|ritong: home and dry now|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: Huang known to be on minimum, so must be distributional for @S.  since Wu 3@S bid show 4, Asbi may actually be able to read  5161 or 5251|pg||
nt|geot: He will pull the trumps now, and then low heart from dummy. When the Q comes he is practically safe by playing a low to the nine. Unless West has played the ! from Q-9.......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- Henri did already say that|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|ritong: always good to see we agree|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: and relatives|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|geot: Playing the Q from Q-9 in this situation is the only defence to make declarer go wrong. If the nine comes he will bang down the other honor and concede only one heart. |pg||

nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@s or 1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I think S put his queen of hts in his pocket, even without the @H bid by W |pg||

mb|1C|nt|henryb:  I would bid 4|pg||
nt|rv: have the rains stopped in South Island?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: bidding it more of a challenge now |pg||
nt|friggi: not good bid at all|pg||
nt|janm: New Zealand's IMPs came from board 2, where EW were allowed to play in 4@c and didn't make it (so that was a chance for a Hong Kong pickup if they'd gotten the spade ruff to beat ...|pg||
nt|janm: 4@h)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||
nt|rv: 2@c is possibly single suiter here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|janm: The Hong Kong IMPs are from board 3, where the HK N bid game over his partner's 2@s opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it gets stronger in 3rd/4th|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N makes for 600 against 2@DX for 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: 3@D helps opps more the p|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=6-9 HCP|pg||
nt|pelu: partscore hand in @s or @h|pg||
nt|pzpp: NS may reach another doomed 3NT|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: and E  does not have a good cue here   qx of @H's not easy |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh good E bid 5 @C |pg||
nt|pelu: U can find CC's on: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Open/Australia.aspx|pg||
mb|3H|nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|henryb:  So did East: 4@d shows a good 4@s.|pg||
nt|pelu: also my bid - the hand is too weak to 4@D (namyats)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C takes them out of relay mode -- i think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: meanwhile closed room seems to have gone to sleep|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Hans must have missorted his cards|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb:  I think Namyats should be a better hand than that|pg||
nt|pelu: CC: just a solid suit - but I agree with u|pg||
nt|pelu: and not "solid" :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  My rules (back when I played it) was no 3-loser suit, and not two suits with two fast losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe DBL is relay -- i'm just not sure :(|pg||
nt|rv: at any other colors, West will gleefully doube 2@d, he is likely to bid 3n at these colors|pg||
nt|pelu: Grant like to bid - but he has no bid|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sybarra: is this a slam that is biddable?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is very possible that 3@H=exact shape|pg||
nt|rodal f: The lead at match and team is? not @C but thrumph.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the all seasons double comes to his rescue|pg||
nt|pelu: a slow X = pd my distribution is not OK :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now should pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkt: nope :(|pg||
nt|pzpp: I think that Mr. Lin had a misunderstanding of this 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 @D bid not recommended at home |pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe only at home LOL|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: helps W to count that hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe "we" are on our way |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so YES Shirley|pg||
nt|tejjyid: itsvery disciplined to take 2 passes on that hand; mabe he will balance over 3@H?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|janm: 3@s presumably Smolen, showing a game force with 4 spades and 5 hearts, so that partner can play the hand in hearts; they know they don't have an 8 card fit in spades already|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what to lead|pg||
nt|janm: 3NT is going to be very difficult to make here|pg||
nt|rv: E-W playing negative doubles and forcing pass till 2n after double by West to set up forcing auction|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kaz Yamada|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now the lead is very important.|pg||
nt|rodal f: How many have missed how many times there:)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cascade: what do you lead from Miller's hand knowing that declarer is probably 4=3 in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 Key Cards + @HQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: but when I bid these,  hts are always 4/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lucky -- mine 5-0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: AND @S king offside|pg||
nt|kaz08833: hi all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are toungue in cheek with our comments, folks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: LOL |pg||
nt|barnets: can south be stopped from scoring a second club trick ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Kaz welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no emotion !|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: someone's tummy is rumbling here !|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: seen the hand maybe !|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i might lead spades as the least destructive|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rv: I like this treatment as well, prefer positive doubles if we have bid a 4+ card suit naturally and on a similar forcing auction|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nice lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: another long think|pg||
nt|tejjyid: There's some serious underbidding going on here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: East-West should time such defenses very well, need to combine punching declarer and remove his trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: if e/w tap dec he will make 4 @D tricks and a club|pg||
nt|pelu: why didn't S bid 3@D ?|pg||
nt|pelu: ven here its a make|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: pity the trumps dont break (just a joke) |pg||
nt|sybarra: yep k off,  I will let you play the 5/0 breaks, and count my blessings|pg||
nt|rodal f: But always 110EW|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c4|nt|janm: Hard to know what to lead, I agree; although leading a 5 card suit is often right, when it's a bad suit and dummy has 4 of them... So I think he's probably right to try to find ...|pg||
nt|janm: partner's suit, just unlucky that he chose the wrong minor|pg||
nt|barnets: if they dont tap he makes 3@D tricks and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|rv: b|pg||
nt|rodal f: y better|pg||
nt|pelu: I am not sure I would have bid on the East-hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: this seems to need 3-2 trump and nothing awful in @S|pg||
nt|kaz08833: it will go down 3 at least if E misguesss d|pg||
pc|c9|nt|henryb:  He can make this, I think. @h to Q, @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Great Shuffler on declarer's side this hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Only the Vul would make me think twice|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: @SJ and|pg||
nt|rv: strange play by both West and North|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might vug maded wrong at the @S. |pg||
nt|rv: low @h from dummy could even lead to 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|rodal f: But he/she will come with a correct result.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gambit: cl already 6 or 7|pg||
nt|rv: min of 9 tricks for E-W|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: DD u can make 4@S by playing @D in trick 2 - but then u need to see all 52 cards|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you can rely on double promising hearts he made the normal bid|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h2|nt|sybarra: one sigh of relief so far |pg||
nt|pelu: NS's NT 1. and 2 : (11)12-14 - 3. and 4. : 14-17|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|rv: here even double dummy, South can't be stopped from making 5 tricks as rightly pointed by Barnet|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c5|nt|sybarra: hold breath now for spade |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NZ has won imps on every board so far -- this another likely swing|pg||
nt|sybarra: (that is spades breaking favorably) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: well -- wouldn't be surprised if swing, but 'likely' is an overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra: China seems to be pushing very hard at other table |pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|janm: So 3NT will make - it was important to lead clubs, not to start setting up N's 5-card suit, but to take the entry out of dummy|pg||
nt|rv: now 4 down|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: should be -2 now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: it sort of shows hearts and clubs actually|pg||
nt|fabsayc: since with hearts and diamonds you act over 1@S|pg||

nt|pelu: or 2-3-3-5|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

pc|d9|nt|henryb:  No, He needed to keep that. Now South can rise @dA, cash the @sJ and exit|pg||

mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: but defense does not have enough tricks then|pg||
nt|janm: Declarer has 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds (if he uses the club and heart aces for diamond finesses), 1 club, he really can't find 2 more tricks, can he?|pg||
nt|rv: no one likes to finish last and lose too many matches, pride of every bridge player|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: sorry missed a bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ehaa......for the S bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  2-8 HCP  --  i should copy/paste instead of trying to use recall|pg||

mb|3N!|an|Fit|nt|fabsayc: not sure|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nice 4@S for the NZers here (even 3NT makes)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and naturally interesting to watch-no play:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: i think so|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NP, these guys are prety quick, I imagine|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: battle of spades and hts, |pg||
nt|barnets: 3N and 4@S both make here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: and 4 @H's always "transfers" to 4 @S (for opps) |pg||
nt|cascade: i just checked double dummy and GIB thinks Miller needed to find the @c8 to defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|janm: Defense might get endplayed out of one trick, but 2? Hard to tell. And of course it isn't easy to lead the club Q either, just easier than leading low|pg||
nt|janm: But GIB lets declarer play double dummy too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EHAA was never this creative|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 9 tricks plaing \s by NS, 8 tricks playing \D by EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 2@s seems a gross under-bid here|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: ooops|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: they really needed to find out about the nice secondary fit in @Ds to bid this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes very|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If that tempo reflected the table, I don't think much of it|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: should do|pg||
nt|friggi: ??|pg||
nt|sybarra: well indeed that is true!|pg||
nt|rv: it is normally played as Invitational strength 8-9/10 hcp even with 4@s|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|janm: Ah, here we see science in action (not!)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well if 2s is minimum is quite reasonable|pg||
nt|sybarra: I only played it in midnight swisses|pg||
nt|barnets: you put the hex on australia|pg||
nt|rv: interesting contract to play and defend, I expect defense to prevail here|pg||
nt|rodal f: -1 and next? but normal bidding.|pg||
nt|pelu: In my book the N hand is too strong to splinter|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North should KNOW what he is doing over a 4@H cue when he bids 4@D|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cascade: 2@s will be minimum|pg||
nt|janm: They got to the right spot of course, but does N really know that his partner can't have enough for 7? Make the diamond Q the club Q for instance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might gain by not helping defense to lead|pg||
nt|cascade: i am pretty sure they dont play 2/1 FG|pg||
nt|fabsayc: remember is precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry there is no commentary here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: so 2s is definitely limited|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 3@s is not invitational, so pass looks automatic.|pg||
nt|rv: @h ruff or 2@s tricks in addition to 2 tricks each in @hs and @cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes precision 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 11-15|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|rv: with 5@s and super-max for passed hand, I would have started with 2@h with West hand|pg||
nt|rv: lol|pg||
nt|barnets: as they miss a good game especially on th e bidding|pg||
pc|h2|nt|janm: Even if 2/1 isn't FG, couldn't he at least bid 2@c and then blackwood and tell his partner they had all the keycards and adequate trumps - S would know that AQx of clubs was golden|pg||
nt|rv: commentator's curse as Barnet rightly put it:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if lead is fourth best, start looking elsewhere|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|rv: can even be 2 down now|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and SOuth does not have enough to bid over a signoff, IMO|pg||

nt|geot: A club lead will set 3NT on this one. And declarer must finesse the ten in diamonds to win. Strong 630 in the CR.|pg||
nt|geot: Spade lead is normal.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D WAS game force -- i wonder why 2@H on that terrible 5 card suit instead of natural 2@S |pg||

nt|pelu: 4@D or 4@s by West?|pg||
nt|rv: I intend to drive to game in any case and in my opinion 2@h gives more flexibility|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 3h is not my choice|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless specifically agreed as a weak jump|pg||
nt|pelu: agree - bidding direct on Multi sh show a better hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|janm: I suppose there could be QJ in front of the K and A over it, but I don't think bidding scientifically will make it any easier for them to find that|pg||
nt|cascade: they have another chance to showcase their slam bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: see NSs problem after 4@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  somewhat difficult to get to 6@h-- maybe less difficult when West chooses not to open a large number of spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can blame the layout for EW at this board.|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: 12-13 tricks on @Dq|pg||

mb|p|nt|janm: This time S has a positive response to 1@c|pg||
nt|janm: Can they find diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@S, 0-3@H, maybe longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|kaz08833: its highly likely NS will play 2NT which will go down|pg||

mb|4H|nt|rv: I like 4@s here, max pre-emptive effect and tough for NS to get in|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Looks like each side can make 11 tricks in their best fit|pg||

nt|jcwla: Uh oh.|pg||
mb|d|nt|janm: Or is 6@c okay too?|pg||
nt|cascade: do they need to|pg||
nt|henryb:  North MUST bid here; pass is not acceptable with that good a hand and heart support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=ART, 5+@D|pg||
nt|barnets: not best|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: rescued|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D usually 2/3@D but ....|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|sybarra: but can W lead a @D easily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6c is better|pg||
nt|pelu: ok a bidding: 4@s P P 4NT - then 5@C (or 6@C) by N and 5/6@D by S = 2 siuter in red|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not be best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell had option to bid 3@C showing MAX with longer @C|pg||
nt|barnets: Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: South's action is surely too timid though it is hardly clearcut to bid at 5 level|pg||
nt|barnets: would show  the @HA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cascade: anyway the answer was yes easily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D likely down if diamonds 4-1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C would still have chances|pg||
nt|kaz08833: with other Q N shd pass it's unfortunate judge by N|pg||
nt|rodal f: Auto @S hook and a 50% @D hook for 10in @S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps but they have bid my multi suit a few times, and i am still spending the winnings|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kiwibridge: the slam was NOT found so 13 well earned imps to CT|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I kinda blame Stout a bit here .. he has chance to bid 3@C, which would have pushed pd's buttons (and they would never defend 5@Dx then)|pg||
nt|rv: I would pass 2@s with West hand, no Invite with 7 hcp, bid game only if partner super-accepts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i was wondering how that 3@H bid would backfire|pg||
nt|pelu: in US and ? canada - the defense against Multi is not so commen as in Europe|pg||

pc|d4|nt|janm: I assume all of this was natural after 1@c and 1@d, and 3@s is some sort of attempt to find NT|pg||
nt|janm: 6NT won't be a success|pg||
nt|henryb:  Would North's pass be forcing? I do not think so. And North could have much less, say AKJxxx in clubs and out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: where do we locate BBO|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: oh is this blackwood|pg||
nt|rodal f: At the -edge for W but...|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|janm: Surely if N jumps to 6@c, S should let him play there |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have bid 4@C over 3nt|pg||
nt|janm: I think 4NT is just a quantitative slam try, not Blackwood|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club queen has to be a big card|pg||
nt|cascade: south did well to move with no aces|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, but S seems to be thinking along NT lines, also if he bid 4@c wouldn't that make it sound as if 3@s was a cue bid?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Took it out.|pg||
nt|rv: West should surely pass 3@s after his invite|pg||
nt|jcwla: Always max pressure from the Indonesian pair -- no free space -- a winning style.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|barnets: well done|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure Herr exp a better hand by partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have to fight everytime to play it live, mostly recently last weekend|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if theat 4 HCP is 2 Q's, East can stop here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: i liked the unscientific auction better|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, N has a minimum and a void in partner's suit, so even with that nice 6-card suit and 3 aces, it's not unreasonable for him to pass|pg||
nt|pelu: here in denmark even "the old ladies" play Multi :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the final ruling was the event strength of the weakest team was over 8000 master points so multi allowable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i swear this is true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as opposed to my usual embellishments|pg||
nt|pelu: I trust u - and here we find that atitude vert strange (mild expression :))|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think and sigh|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cascade: Stout does have spade stoppers but the @sAK and the rest of his hand are also suitable for slam|pg||
nt|janm: This one wasn't really very scientific either :)|pg||
nt|rv: he has bid his hand to the hilt by showing 5@s and 8-9 hcp|pg||

nt|rv: he can make this contract if he guesses everything correctly though|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT might a bit hard from Brison, but his pards problem.|pg||
nt|rv: needs to avoid double finesse in @s which he has successfully negotiated, next needs to play @cs twice towards dummy and then guess @d diamonds as well|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hmmph|pg||
pc|h4|nt|janm: This is actually probably a hand that would be easier to bid in a natural system - N would start with 1@c and later be able to show a good hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China began RR2 in 4th, NZ 7th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grant-Ker did get to 4@H on previous hand|pg||
nt|pelu: but the 5@d bid I have no expl - even a guees|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|barnets: intersting on a diamond lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cascade: well they get to a similar situation after 1@c 1@h; 2@d 3@d ...|pg||
nt|janm: So making 5 or 6 depending on whether they cash the heart A now|pg||
nt|henryb:  in which case South might go down at the five level when the opponents were down in 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: well defended, still could be a loss since 5@d makes for NS|pg||
nt|barnets: to see if dc could make it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tejjyid: I canot fathom 5@D - 0 Aces in 1430?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|janm: Somewhat similar I suppose, but the S hand would have shown a better hand at that point and N could then bid 3@s to pattern out. I don't know, I just hear comments about how much ...|pg||
nt|janm: easier some hand would be in a strong club system so often, I can't resist when it doesn't help at all and might even hurt|pg||

nt|geot: May be tempting to play South for ie. 9-x, ten from hand. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: south is supposed to hold east's hand|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: but when he will appear to hold 2 @ss, this idea of 4 cards in @hs will decrease|pg||

nt|janm: The reason I think the strong club might hurt on this hand is more psychological than real - N starts out thinking he has a minimum and doesn't revise that idea|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the vague 3s and 4nt did them in|pg||
nt|janm: Another void opposite partner's long Major!|pg||
nt|cascade: he is minimum until he finds a fit|pg||
nt|cascade: then he has a very slam suitable hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: My guess is N/S feel good about their game, but not as good as it  will score up |pg||
nt|rodal f: So after the board: That was not as I would have done it. If E goes dow. And WD if home:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: internet connection a bit slow here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so slam is at best 50%|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rv: on @d lead, declarer pitches a @h, draws a round of trumps and plays a @c out|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ino need to pass I feel, it usually goes wrong when you bid with that and Q@S was a good trump|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: wow - some interesting deals today|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I know, but I just think that it's easier to recognize that if you start out thinking you have a lot in reserve for your opening bid :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Li-Liu in 10@C on  24|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 1 @S is transfer opening again |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=ART, 9-13 HCP, unbal, 4+@D, not 4+@H/@S a) 6+@D  b) @D & @C [maybe longer @C]|pg||
nt|pzpp: an easy 4@s?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: On the face of it 4@S for EW, can go overboard.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: S is thinking !|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: still counting his pts !|pg||
nt|pzpp: S thinking? they play Precision, partner's 1@d bid may have no great length to boast about|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: yes he is rewarded with another 6430 - what are the card gods saying?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=@S    go figure|pg||
nt|barnets: e can pitch a heart from dummy and protect against a ruff|pg||
nt|pelu: before this match: Taipie No 1 and NZ No6 - oout of 13|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: perhaps you are right|pg||
nt|janm: After 1@h-1@s-2@h will S let partner play the hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: geesh,  a real bid of a suit!! |pg||
nt|barnets: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: late alert|pg||
nt|fabsayc: really 1@D by west?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with so many tricks or points, why is he thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yikes|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rv: precision auction here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: playing with house money|pg||
pc|d3|nt|janm: I think we had a discussion in another match about rebidding 2@h vs 2@c on hands like N's - what do you both think (you know what I think)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H-4@H|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rv: is 2@c right bid? is strong hand transferring here?|pg||
nt|barnets: australia running away now|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D = CRS = Colors, Rank, Shape|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT = 11-14. Lead: right suit - wrong catd :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|janm: I think you're about to get the prediction prize for the match!|pg||
nt|pelu: on Board 3 NS in OR missed the 3NT - bad range for 1NT opening 13-15 and pd had 9 good points|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4 down?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: NS havent bothered with their 6-5 heart fit  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: v late alert 1@h|pg||

nt|rnmalik: only @D lead can solve declarers problems |pg||

nt|pzpp: no one will be happy in West's shoes|pg||

nt|rnmalik: For discussion sake why did W not DBL 5@D?|pg||
nt|pzpp: anything there, I mean, in your sky?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: down to the floor !|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: rain|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: up to the sky again|pg||
nt|pzpp: rain, great, German says rain brings luck|pg||
nt|jcwla: This can't be the right M.O.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|henryb:  apparently E-W play a variable NT; weak nv and sound(er) vul|pg||
nt|babs59: Hi.  Please don't jinx them Barnet|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Stout will be waiting for his heart ruff at trick 2.   Bad news, Graeme  :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: 10 and next|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 tricks in 1@H - so not so bad|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time for a quick coffee. On that lead, this will make buckets|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cascade: NZ gained another 11 IMPs on  5 when Grant Ker found a good 4@s dive which went undoubled!!!|pg||
nt|rv: ah this makes more sense|pg||
nt|kaz08833: NS only have to take 6 tricks or even 7 because EW can make 4@s|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a std. @S lead |pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends a lot on spots, here i totally agree with 2@H rebid|pg||
nt|pelu: yes 11-14 and 15-17|pg||
nt|pelu: good Acol-style|pg||
nt|rv: wlc Barbara, as neutrals we would like a much closer match:)|pg||

nt|jaheim: t|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cascade: well i dont know what you think|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Sartaj may ruff this and run 10@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: If you're willing to go there later, go there now with 2@S over 2@D.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: any reasone to cover? |pg||
nt|rodal f: By RV if u have to leave|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Rodal and specs, need to leave now, enjoy the game|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sad|pg||
nt|pelu: 500/430|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kind of like paying to see the hidden cards in poker|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzkt: brief flurry of action|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|cascade: but i typically bid the six card suit unless there is a major disparity in the suit strength|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually defense could slip and allow down 1|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|sybarra: n/s system should not be tried for novices....  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and isn't even almost allowed in ACBL|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I do not know a defense to it|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe defense is just bid your longest suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Hou is examining the system card|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the "down unders"  (Aus and NZ) have always been "creative"  |pg||
nt|pelu: yes - not my style - but on the other hand - I dont like to see a long relay-bidding by opp|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rv: this should get beaten|pg||
nt|babs59: of course, I've just noticed his name showing as Paul Gill, but it's Peter Gill, and he's my brother|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably thinking S lead from kxxx|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe he should duck the @D|pg||
nt|barnets: another @D|pg||
nt|barnets: knocks out the ace|pg||
nt|rv: yes that would be a good deceptive play especially at trick 1|pg||
nt|barnets: and if east plays a third @D dec is home|pg||
nt|barnets: and in the newspaper too|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cascade: Michael Lawrence had some advice for 6=4s which i read many years ago|pg||
nt|janm: I think it's automatic to rebid the 6 card major with a relatively weak hand, but I've been told that's old fashioned :). Glad to hear some support|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb:  Not the Acol I know. that is weak throughout|pg||
nt|rv: has a very good chance of working especially if West returns @D3 which may be difficult to read|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: welcome to Pat Anderson, USA|pg||
nt|fifee: ty Shirley :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not enough trumps to take the rest|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe down under= upside down  |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: does that mean in NZ i'd be a morning person?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|cascade: his advice was with 6=4 rebid the suit with the most high card points|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe |pg||
nt|babs59: board 7 where Gill and Gosney missed game, OR  West opened 1S and passed partner's 1NT response (surely forcing?)|pg||
nt|babs59: so it was a flat board|pg||
nt|rv: declarer should have possibly cashed 4@cs instead of playing 3rd @d|pg||
nt|rv: that would have forced West to make 2 pitches and he might have got it wrong|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any are long at @H it's W. Play @H for the Q|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcwla: But this has been their style throughout -- "maybe if we wish and hope and pray it might come true" -- that Indonesia will stay out -- but they don't, so get where you're going ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: asap.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: perish the thought|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzkt: got em|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: or an all night person?|pg||
nt|rv: now if North cashes 4@s, West will be in some discomfort|pg||
nt|rv: 4@cs|pg||
mc|9|nt|fabsayc: here lau might have thought of not covering|pg||

nt|fifee: hi Friggi :)|pg||
nt|pelu: spec in teams|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry babs|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 3NT likely for East-West here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is a bigger downside when the shape shown allows opponents contract to make with double dummy play|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: all very pleasant to each other :)|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|ahollan1: 2N=PRE, 3-10 HCP, @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: and even on 24  imps again for n/s |pg||
nt|rv: we didn't get full play, but looks like tale of missed opportunities from both sides and last mistake turned out to be costly one|pg||
nt|babs59: I just don't want to see it ALL go away|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 11 tricks in @h/@d for EW - 5@C would be expensive for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Thanks, Alister :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: A contract wich is easy to fail at for EW|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict will be expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: need to stay low here |pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: eveything off  |pg||
nt|pelu: they play 5 card major, but the @s-suit is almost 5 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Asbi thinking about bidding 3@c ...|pg||
nt|pelu: I hope not :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: pulled out the cards and put them back|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Amanda - nice to have u as operator|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@h - all pass?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only 10 if lau had not covered|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thank you|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or kill the cat for a safe score|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like the aggressive reverse|pg||
nt|pelu: not so bad 6@c - u just need @cs 2-2 or singleton Q|pg||
nt|pelu: yes no problem for me - @sK better now and 4½ loser|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I agree the 6-4 is worth an extra K & the @SK is worth an extra Q - so I call this a 19 |pg||
pc|cT|nt|fifee: @S lead is a killer|pg||
nt|janm: Would you bid again as N?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok 2 nt is some minor bid,  Al,  need your help |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html  for standings after 12 of the 13 rounds in RR1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: did it mean specially wk @D's?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *specifically |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 25 starts with Precision 2@C on previous board -- it gets scary from there|pg||
nt|jcwla: 22 and 23 pushes in 2@S making 3 and 3NT making 4, respectively.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|barnets: how does this tourney work ?|pg||
nt|itinerant: 2S = 4+clubs, 5+ spades|pg||
pc|sA|nt|alchilds: no low =2|pg||
nt|pelu: u owe me a coke, Martin :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|janm: He knows he probably has the best hand at the table, but that doesn't necessarily translate into the ability to take 8 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Amanda, Henry, Peter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes @D preempt|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: swing both ways on 19 4 more CT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you did not accept|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: tight match so far|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|janm: Well, he pushed them one higher, so I guess he was right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe double|pg||
nt|barnets: do the top 8 play off or top 4?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you can guess I play few partscores|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|janm: But DBL should surely suggest some club length, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2d suggests better diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double allows for 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D/@H are Transfer Preempts -- only 3@C is nat pre|pg||
nt|babs59: Paul Gosney has also qualified for the Australian Under 26 team - which meant that for NZ PABF he has been replaced in the team|pg||
pc|d3|nt|janm: True, but I'm afraid the doubleton club would keep me from doubling - I think I'd end up being a chicken and passing - maybe bid 1NT?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 21 it was|pg||
nt|davidstern: They may have right sided this to avoid a heart lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: on 25  China in 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: glaned at conv. cards, and were more than I could deal with at this time of night |pg||
nt|sybarra: *glanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've been studying newell-reid system for a while in preparation of this PABF|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|babs59: but he will be representing Australia in the World Youth Series in Philadelphia in October|pg||
nt|davidstern: So 9 top tricks now 1-1-2-5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pelu: EW play Low as come on (and even)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Roland!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry all we went down for a moment|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: welcome Al |pg||
nt|barnets: i am told its a double round robin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but since i dont drink coke, is ok|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess the lackof@C Q hurt them|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|janm: However, pushing the opponents up a level was certainly a good thing, because it looks as if 2@s will be very difficult to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: partner will only bid clubs with 5, then the support is adequate|pg||
nt|barnets: tks |pg||
nt|barnets: nick|pg||
nt|babs59: I understand that this year it's a double RR and then the leading team wins|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|janm: Your partner, maybe :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 232 VP - 223 - 218|pg||
nt|kaz08833: now 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: get a new partner jan :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if i had say 2524 i would rebid 2c|pg||
nt|janm: Once upon a time, I doubled 1@d with 4441 (in that order). My partner waited until the 4 level to bid his 4 card club suit!! Taught me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so i think here double suggests some diamond length|pg||
nt|janm: I would be more likely to DBL with 2524, and certainly with 1534, but I think you're convincing me to bid 1NT|pg||
nt|rv: Official tourney url is http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/|pg||
nt|jcwla: Surprising pass -- that dummy is just so trick-taking in @D's on this auction.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|davidstern: 10 now|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2-1-2-5|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|friggi: not the best line:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: over reverses Iplay Blackout (o a variety) so I Can set @C with 3@C imediately|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no space filing 3@D bids|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pelu: I would bid 6 on the East hand - and make 6@c on an endplay on S :):)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fifee: great defense though|pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb:  You cant take enough ruffs, so might as well play the @hQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indonesia currently 2nd, Chinese Taipei first|pg||
nt|babs59: however in other years this is the Zonal selection event for the Bermuda Bowl (and Venice Cup / Seniors) - in which case there are SF and Finals|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sQ|nt|fifee: down 2 now|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East has doneenough bidding|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|janm: Best now is for N to lead a club and get his ruff |pg||
nt|cascade: but a diamond works too|pg||
nt|cascade: since declarer also needs to ruff a club|pg||
nt|janm: Interesting that a diamond will have the same good effect as the club ruff|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|babs59: the Pacific Asia Bridge Federation is Zone 6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|barnets: i like semi finals and finals|pg||
nt|babs59: however the Zone 7 countries are also members - Australia, New Zealand, French Polynesia, New Caledonia|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: this is 1st match of Round Robin  2    Open is playing 2 full round robins, 13 teams so 1 sitout each|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not exactly sure what they did with the other events where not enough entries, so RR1 combined Seniors/Ladies   and  U26/U21 for better movement|pg||
nt|sybarra: j of @C and stuffs W in |pg||
nt|ahollan1: turnout and maybe team strength affected because this is NOT a year where PABF qualifies country for World Championships|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 2010 event in Philadelphia is an open event -- i.e. not country-specific|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|h8|nt|babs59: so in the Zonal selection years, though many of the Zone 7 countries play, the Semi Finalists are drawn from the top 4 teams, discounting ALL matches v. Zone 7 countries|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|janm: I was wondering whether N would decide a ruff/sluff was best at this point, and whether it will gain a trick - I think E's spade spots are just a little too good for it to do so|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well,  was easy for us to see,  not so easy at the table|pg||

nt|babs59: that's why it's beneficial for Zone 7 to compete.  We are a small zone and very isolated|pg||

mb|d|nt|sybarra: I dont play 3/2 well with no high cards LOL|pg||
nt|cascade: Stout is on the way to 4@s|pg||
nt|janm: 2@h is 5 hearts and a 4+ minor, I guess - I confess I wouldn't have made this one |pg||
nt|janm: Hopefully 3@d showed both diamonds and a minimum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N would have been 13-15 unless partnership doesn't allow 5422|pg||
nt|babs59: in 2011 the PABF will be held in Macau|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh, i thought he passed|pg||
mb|2D|nt|cascade: 5-4-2-2 equal minimum - you have to have some standards|pg||
nt|henryb:  although 2@s would certainly work out just fine as a contract|pg||
nt|pelu: @c-lead - normal here - dont work - there are 5 @S-tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: that is what is commonly played|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c/@d = minimums|pg||
nt|janm: Now is 3@s forcing?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not to me|pg||
nt|cascade: and 3@h/@s = maximums with @c/@d respectively|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but then i dont open this crap|pg||
nt|cascade: lets hope not and they have discussed it|pg||
nt|janm: So Miller has shown a minimum, will he decide it's good enough to raise if 3@s isn't forcing?|pg||
nt|cascade: he does have an ace and a fit|pg||
nt|babs59: I have a suspicion that both Zone 6 and Zone 7 will use it for selection purposes for the World Championships|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: oops operator |pg||
nt|pelu: now Liu would have prefer to bid 2@s first time - but that risk pass round - do he had to X first|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: he did think|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkt: sorry a bit sleepy after lunch :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|janm: Probably N could have bid 3@s over 2@h to invite in spades, so maybe this should be forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know I do not play their system since that is not a neg X for m |pg||
nt|sybarra: for mi|pg||
nt|rv: Double of 2@c by West is t/o and need not have extras|pg||
nt|pelu: 480|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: need some coffee or tea |pg||
nt|janm: The 2@h bid did keep EW from getting to too many hearts :)|pg||
nt|cascade: there are lots of ways to bid spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shirley -- you mean Hou's DBL?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I would not X with that hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: many experts play this treatment below 2M level after 1M-1N-(2X by opps)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: generally, of course, thinking is a good idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: (or a beer) |pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: negative dbl with 4+@H -- what's wrong with that?|pg||
nt|rv: double above 2M level on 1M-1N-(2/3X by opps) is still t/o with extras (15+)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: There are about 8 rounds left; it all finishes on Sunday afternoon (NZ time)|pg||
nt|pzpp: another successful contract is 3NT on board 26, with 3 overtricks:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep-overlooked.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: or rather that was being played at the time of my observation:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cascade: Lau was undeterred by the hearts sitting over him|pg||
nt|janm: Now, can he make this? Or rather, will he? I'm sure he can double dummy|pg||
nt|jcwla: The one thing they didn't want to do was give up 450 - so instead 500.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: in OR - where NZ has a very strange system - they never found the @s-suit and they sold out to 5@c - NO X in board 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H showed spades i believe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on board 10 open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: that was helpful|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|janm: Or maybe he can't if E puts the diamond K up on a lead towards dummy |pg||
nt|cascade: i think he has to lose at least one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: first off, it is only a 7 count,  pard never knows I have 5 hts.  and never knows to bid them |pg||
nt|rv: North should have surely competed to 3@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. As a spec told me 1-4     4-1=28.3%|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: the problem was they had no idea whose hand it was|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a common problem when you open very light|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|friggi: do you agree?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can handle any minor suit rebid from partner too|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|janm: Of course N doesn't know he has spade losers, so is just trying to lose a trick in each side suit and ruff the second club loser|pg||
nt|pelu: playing with screens I dont see that there were a "Break Of Tempo)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|cascade: Chan can Grosvenor now with the @s7|pg||
nt|pelu: EW signals: HL = odd Number|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree with that |pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: declarer knows well that the club was singleton |pg||
nt|rv: North-South pair not very experienced and probably over-awed by occasion|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Bd 24 very costly to NZ - the dreaded double game swing, when NZ allowed Aus to play in 5C in the other room ..14 IMPs out|pg||
pc|dT|nt|friggi: has to play E for @DK|pg||
nt|alchilds: right pay |pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|rodal f: @H at top.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: still all smiling|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They dont have any choice:)|pg||
nt|pzpp: EW has a @h game here, but on a non @d lead, they have 13 tricks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I can spel, I just can't type|pg||
mb|1H|nt|janm: DBL or 1@h with the N hand?|pg||
nt|barnets: 6-8 weeks from end feb|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the ill bid and fated 3N brings a welcom 7 to Japan|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the north hand on 11 could justify since attempt to deceive, as with a 2nt response|pg||
nt|jcwla: The @S ruff went bye bye - meanwhile 24 a push at 4@SX making.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I'm a 1@h bidder, but I can see the appeal of DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL [16+ BAL unfav]|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes there are screens and was not a long think|pg||
mb|3D!|an|fit|nt|sybarra: its the nebulous 1 @D in the precision system |pg||
nt|cascade: me too|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry|pg||
nt|babs59: np :)|pg||
nt|rv: some form of Bergen raise by Peter here?|pg||
nt|babs59: yes|pg||
nt|npcjpn: pass, double or 2@c?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree-@D lead difficult but not impossible.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: P=0-9 or less than 3 controls|pg||
mb|4H|nt|janm: I'd think Miller would want to bid 2@h to keep West from an easy 2@d bid; wonder why it took him so long?|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d is certainly a reasonable contract: needs no @d loser or the club finesse and decent breaks|pg||
nt|babs59: Peter's bidding is very straight forward.  I managed to play a tournament with him last year - our first game together in more than 30 years!|pg||
nt|pelu: here a better overcall against 1@c - and in green|pg||
mb|5C|nt|barnets: i would x as south|pg||
nt|rv: I would have Xed from South hand|pg||
nt|babs59: we would all have doubled as South|pg||
nt|kaz08833: EW can make 4@h here but can they bid it?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pass for me or 2c|pg||
nt|rodal f: But by 21NS = 19EW and open from EW.......|pg||
nt|pzpp: 2@d must be waiting, with 2@h as double negative|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|friggi: 11-14|pg||
nt|alchilds: low =1|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be scramble but should be able to find 7 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: playing clubs from the top |pg||
nt|friggi: yes low and play @C for 2-3|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes you just have to hope for the best|pg||
nt|friggi: if dec do so % is very much in his favour|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  but their best result is to double 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Lui hesitated|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Liu|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: 2H might be hearts and a minor, 3H now showing a "good" weak hand with hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|pzpp: now, 3@d transfers to @h, wrong place to play the @h contract for more than 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: deep think|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time for another coffee|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: 5@d is an awfully big bid! I know he has a stiff heart, but surely his partner knows it too, since he's heard the opponents bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Jeff may duck a round of spades here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be a easy play.|pg||
nt|pelu: small @c will defeat|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oops-wrong sided.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with winning heart guess|pg||
nt|pelu: the the winning lead - for declarer :(|pg||
nt|pelu: I am glad I dont have do bid 1NT on the East hand - a naturel (F!) 2@c|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: was just going to say  not sure if Puppet :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|janm: And even though 2@c was in competition, it should show something, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|cascade: considering he already stretched to 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator alerted for me!!!|pg||
nt|barnets: and all gone minus in 4@C|pg||
nt|rv: inexperience/fatigue showing in Macau's game, it happens to all if you are playing long matches and superior opposition for the first time|pg||
nt|barnets: but thats not the point|pg||
nt|babs59: I feel more like Peng is remembering his 800 - which should have been put aside the moment it happened|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: Thanks Amanda!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so no winning defense, both games depend on hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: but even on a small @C decl can have 9 tricks finding @HQ = 8 in Major|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: np ... 1st time I knew what they were doing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H9 might have been Rusinow -- promising @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way -- my $$$ on defense|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: bad luck for W - but with @Ds 2-2 or 3-1 4@S X = 500-800|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he thought about ducking might have been best |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C will be very successful choice here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CAce that is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and actually -- then there are 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no @H duck because didn't want @S shift|pg||
nt|sybarra: well its the 5/3 suit |pg||
nt|tejjyid: some reason to downgade (singleton @H) - IMO offset by good intermediates|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kiwi_joker: LOL ..and gets a reward with his 8 scoring!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: oops|pg||
nt|pzpp: 5@h must deny control in @d, with which West will have a convenient cuebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: do i lead my ace ?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rv: Macau is doing reasonably well, 8th place |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|cascade: perhaps 3@d was forcing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sigh of relief.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: S not happy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: bravo|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kaz08833: to make 4@h E must play @s now but playing 3@h trump is reasonable|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzkt: think|pg||
pc|h9|nt|janm: Surely not? after the 2@h bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@D would have been a lot better opposite at least one club|pg||
mc|11|nt|fabsayc: the winning heart play is both correct initially and on the bidding|pg||
pg||

nt|fabsayc: i missed that magic|pg||
nt|janm: I don't think that really made|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: it did|pg||
nt|janm: How?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to say Newell-Reid have had a good set is quite an underbid|pg||
nt|kaz08833: dbl then 2@s or 3@h shows E's hand precisely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however declarer should have made an overtrick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh he did so low club saves the overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: that was lucky|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very lucky indeed.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: possible if defense never lead trumps|pg||
mb|3S|nt|alchilds: yes|pg||
nt|friggi: 2@S pass out|pg||
nt|cascade: the play showed declarer leading trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: in Board 8: taipei in 7@h - and lost @DQ - West had also open only 1@S - with a 4@S-opening more easy to find @DQ - but diff to bid 7 :)|pg||
nt|rv: traditionally Chinese Taipei and Indonesia were top teams in Zone 6, now it is very competitive with China, Japan etc making rapid strides in world bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: risky|pg||
nt|jcwla: That @ST would keep Lord Yarborough from having to pay off 1000-1.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|rv: China is arguably the strongest team in whole of Asia (Zone 4-BFAME, 6-Far East) now|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: This is a real blind spot by Jeff... he should just have continued @Ds ..after that good fortune in the spade suit, he had 5@Ds, 3@Ss and a club for a certain 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 2 tricks in the play and 7 back to CT on 23|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good situation for transfer advances|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Well, apparently he somehow made it and now we get to see the Precision 2@c in action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=F1 , 4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=a) 5@H(332)  b) 4441@S c) 2452 d) 1453|pg||
nt|barnets: multi 21D|pg||
nt|rv: some play lebensohl from North hand on 2@h by West|pg||
nt|barnets: south better not pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and we see them, 2@H a constructive spade raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: good pre-empt !|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and not wasted values here |pg||
nt|sybarra: well maybe the q of @D's|pg||
nt|friggi: right, freindly layout and lead as well|pg||
nt|cascade: a subdued Miller and Stout here should win back some IMPs|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, some pressure from N/S.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|janm: Yes, surely he'll make at least 3 :)|pg||
nt|cascade: or rather too much aggression at the other table to wind up to 5@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we may play it here also |pg||
pc|c7|nt|barnets: now 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well maybe, could simply be a cue raise also|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: he should expect a @s bid after a X|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|friggi: friendly|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well forget that statement|pg||
nt|kaz08833: i guess the score is almost tie because Japan will gain another 8 on bd 25|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same bidding so fare|pg||
nt|pzpp: seems that NS plays negative free bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @D Q now, for fun|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|barnets: I like 4@H - 5@S|pg||
nt|pelu: best defense against 2@S is to lead @S4 - but in CR East - absolut normal - played @S A K 4 ( and stole his pds @SQ)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|henryb:  6@s looks like a much better contract|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S|pg||
nt|npcjpn: on this hand, NS can make 3NT, but no way to reach..|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D was different|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: 3@H confirming 5@H along the way to showing max 1N|pg||
nt|rv: yes good auction|pg||
nt|rv: is Peng's 4N quant here?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: hopefully no one leads trumps too soon |pg||
nt|janm: I think a 3@c rebid with the N hand was what pushed them too high - it just has too much in the short suits and too many quacks|pg||
nt|babs59: the other table started with North bidding 2@H - both majors, weak|pg||
nt|pelu: almost for first time EW stepped wrong - down 200/300|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the old surround play|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in college we defined  Down 1 = Good Bridge|pg||

nt|sybarra: but we made it thru right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after a mere 16 years|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i made LM in decent time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, Chinese Taipei has cut the deficit by 10 by getting to the @D game on 26 - also making 7.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: Normaly trumh would been the best lead, but E want W to lead that color.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rnmalik: sorry-some connection.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: some of us "dashed" thru faster than that,  but my father who often was nice enough to pick my up from school always knew where to find me |pg||
nt|rv: I suspect not though it could be for many other partnerships since fit is not found|pg||
nt|barnets: ok well done|pg||

nt|barnets: after the wk two bid|pg||
nt|davidstern: Strange declarer is pitching diamonds which can be ruffed rather than clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last board is up and last for me to.|pg||
nt|rodal f: THX spec. Was nice.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: last one all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another good result for Indonesia here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: And what would you do with this one? Pass and hope to bid later? Open 1, or open a bunch?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China on the board!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and our last bd of this set |pg||
nt|barnets: they like the multi|pg||
nt|barnets: so do I|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: last board to the match now, thanks very much to Nobuyuki and Kaz for their great comments, thz Amanda on the vugraph, great job, and thx all specs for your feedback|pg||
nt|npcjpn: thanks all.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: join us agin tomorrow|pg||
nt|kaz08833: thanks all too|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3NT N/S here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx to the exelent vug operator. Well done:)|pg||
nt|pelu: last board - 25 VP for Taipie|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx to out wonderful operator,   great job as always |pg||
nt|alchilds: easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Friggi, and Al,  and Frank and Pat, who were here earlier |pg||
nt|friggi: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thank you. back in  a bit oveer 30 minutes- lets hope I am more awake then :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: But no easy road to get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and of course great thx to our specs, for the helpful (and sometimes humorous comments |pg||
nt|janm: Lau chose the latter course (when I'm playing that 4 of a minor is natural, I love to be able to open it)|pg||
nt|davidstern: North will make a move and South has a max perhaps they will find it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the real problem was a substandard neg double|pg||
mb|2C!|an|Fort à Coeur ou faibleà Pique|nt|henryb:  another ambitious 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remaining matches for the day are posted now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next will be Open: Australia v China Macau   Senior: Indonesia v New Zealand (Cornell)|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: In the other room, East also opened 4@c but his partner judged to raise |pg||
nt|kaz08833: this one shd be push|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks K1W1 great job.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 2 matches tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thx :)|pg||
nt|pzpp: 2 matches tomorrow? I think that they have 3 left|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thought there were only 2 could be wrong|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: ah, the hand that needs the heart shift|pg||
nt|cascade: an interesting point is that I think that dealing programs need to have published their algorithms to allay suspicion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing 2@C = weak @C + another|pg||
nt|davidstern: There you go|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  on 24HC with no particular source of tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still a few boards to be played and scored in the open room|pg||
nt|davidstern: So this should be 7 imps to Indonesia assuming 0-1-4-5|pg||
nt|davidstern: For ten tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: A sac at 5@C but 5@H also on|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: overtake and heart seems right|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: i am booked to do 2 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: my guess was 3@C 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: quick shot of something then for you....(what ever that is) |pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 to Indonesia on 27 when Liu failed to lead A and a @S at T2 against 5@DX.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|alchilds: my too may go set|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, and maybe the spade 10 should suggest shifting to a heart?|pg||
nt|pelu: again the 1NT 6-12 created the problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid -- 1st DBL = PEN  2nd DBL = Takeout [i think]|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Dont understand, if cant x 3@C bid 3@S:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this event is really too long, we have to realize how long everybody has already been playing|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Guess not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think any spade but ace is really wrong|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, they're not going to beat 4 whatever they do|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did Caledonia steel candy from the opps?:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Me or your lying eyes?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: last board and some laughter here|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: needs @H play from Dec, diff to find|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is will play @D up from hand |pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was 13-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S shift is killer|pg||
nt|sybarra: can China make a profit here?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|henryb:  this one needs 3@c tricks, a reasonable shot, and either 4@h and 2@s or lots of spade tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: in normal system u would pass 2@S|pg||
nt|rv: this should make 9 tricks even with likley @s finesse|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: best lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  My stomach is growling, so I will leave you. Have fun, and thanks, Peter|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: long explanations|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: haha sorry |pg||
pc|sA|nt|rv: we are playing last board of this match|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|pelu: see u again - here it is bedtime almost 2 O'clock in night|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cascade: For those kibitzers who are interested in chess|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: absolutely -- i was thinking best defense 300|pg||
nt|rodal f: 22-19 after this board. Then OR left to change the result|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rv: my thanks to excellent Vu graph operator and wonderful co-commentators Barnet Shenkin and Barbara Travis|pg||
nt|babs59: and thank you RV and Barnet, for not jinxing Australia too much|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no so maybe here a bit more excusable|pg||
nt|barnets: well tks all specs and fellow commentators I am retiring for the night |pg||
pc|h6|nt|cascade: Ker at the other table is a many time NZ Chess champion|pg||
nt|fabsayc: imagine playing a football match or basketball game every day for two weeks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: agree|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rv: also a word of appreciation to Roland Wald who organises all these Vu graph broadcats and BBO management for telecasting it live|pg||
nt|rv: finally to all specs for listening to us patiently|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|cascade: about 8 or 9 times i have lost count|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks to our excellent operator, PABF, NBZ, all specs - it's been fun.|pg||
nt|jcwla: For now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thx :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: good match|pg||
nt|jcwla: NZB even.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 500 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: E could have got a ruff|pg||
nt|rnmalik: By play small @S-guts:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no after Q@d|pg||
nt|pzpp: the double of 2NT normally shows interest in penalty on at least one of the minors contract, since he does not want to double 3@c, 3@s sounds much more reasonable than pass|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: they are all packing up here instead of playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: now E thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: motionless|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|janm: Interesting how many people are good at both games|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is a dealing program written by a norwegian|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which produces a lot of wild hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like that program|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is used by some of the dealing equipment|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so wherever the equipment goes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and i am totally convinced the hands are not random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the technical term is pseudo random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in a run of say a million hands it should converge on the theoretical odds |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: romm will stay open unti scores are finalised|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H10 would have been very trusting - an maybe worthy of write-up|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting position now however |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D best|pg||
nt|rv: this is last round for the day, please join us tomorrow for more exciting matches in RR2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One more round today|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In 40 minutes|pg||

nt|babs59: what treat is in store?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Chinese Taipei vs Japan  open |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can't remember the other one|pg||
nt|babs59: Under 26 Australia v Japan|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One from the U21 I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh, thx|pg||
nt|babs59: and Open  Chinese Taipei v Japan|pg||
nt|babs59: U21 is what I WANT Roland :)|pg||
nt|babs59: specifically Australia U21 :)|pg||
nt|babs59: of course, I know that that will happen when I have to work!!|pg||
nt|rv: Aus win this match 25-5 if this score stands|pg||
nt|rv: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: scores correct closing the room now |pg||
