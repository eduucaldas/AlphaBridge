pc|c6|nt|lml: this has been a tight well played match from the beginning |pg||

nt|haans: www.vingstedcentret.dk|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: do we know the systems?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone !|pg||

nt|bridge_one: Hello Hans :)|pg||

nt|bridge_one: :)|pg||
nt|haans: and Hi Goeffrey|pg||
nt|bridge_one: always with smile !|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D after passed hand - i agree|pg||
nt|haans: me 2 but will EW find spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems normal yes|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|roswolf: 5@C looks likely which should be ok|pg||
nt|haans: weak nT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 6 @C West prefere to play @C (also because the hand is weak)|pg||
mb|d!|nt|haans: nothing|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|roswolf: n/s use the weak nt it seems|pg||
nt|sharkey: weak NT...|pg||
nt|haans: popular im Denmark have i been told|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: should end up in 21S|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: appears South lucked out with 2@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: YUP|pg||
nt|sharkey: finding pd with 4 card fit|pg||
nt|haans: money on 2nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: my pd usually has two cards in the suit...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Both partnerships play nat 5-card MI best MI  (11)12-14|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i suppose 3nt is possible too if east bids|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by East is natural strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|haans: accept that bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: i will also:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: thx for the info peter|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for just 2|pg||
nt|sharkey: Problem here may be E is "too strong" - has to do it all himself|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry Hans|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzpb: 5 Ma oc|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the rule here is to bid for new suit only with interesting hand - perfect 3@C (and not DBL, by West) - only finding a interesting hand in West became usefull to bid the @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probablyh 4@D by North would work better, but not in this layout (4@s the same)|pg||
nt|haans: other rules if MP:)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|bridge_one: correct way to play against Q10xx in South|pg||
nt|haans: playing safe|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: agree Geoff - need help here - make them start discarding -|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D better bid than 2@D by W|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S better than "@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: very much so|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|lml: east west have 2 adventages . they have the major major and the cards lie well for them|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: oh and one more ... among their advantages is the vulnerability|pg||

nt|haans: soon will bidding start at 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w need to be a little careful here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: slam possible here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|roswolf: and may well make it|pg||
nt|haans: will try clubs before spades so slam a make|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm an aggressive opening ny east|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|roswolf: precisely|pg||
nt|roswolf: west should now recognise the duplication in the red suits|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S suprise|pg||
mb|d!|nt|sharkey: this is the first of two segments in the semi final - total of 24 boards|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D gf|pg||
nt|roswolf: artificial gf i think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 points but A A and the Q in the long suit - today many pair open with that cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 4@S LOOKS MORE CHALLENGING|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: X=Inviting to game in H or better|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: artificial|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well it looks like south may be allowed to catch up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 3@s instead dbl by west would be possible|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here the problem is to call 4@H giving the idea to make a overbid :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vugraphzpb: 2D=GF check back|pg||
nt|sharkey: common to play 2@C as invitational - also in Denmark I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Peter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: otherwise too easy the defence at 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: east's hand is good for cuebidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but a slow bid may produce an ethical problem for his pard - this is fine though|pg||
nt|haans: only thing wrong with that is no make :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably a misunderstand by E/W - West think to find only 3@h in East|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: as is west's|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed the wrong game|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D made with a endplay|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|roswolf: i fancy 6@D will be the final contract|pg||
nt|haans: many have no good bids after strong nt opening|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bridge_one: would need the lead @C to beat|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looking at the map Vingsted appears to be located close to Århus... - kibs will surely correct me if this is incorrect|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Vejle rather|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sharkey: Ty Roland|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d3|nt|sharkey: Easy for us to see @CQ will drop - let's see if Mr. Hansen is in agreement|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer should test the clubs by ruffing the third round and then play the spades/squeeze |pg||

nt|buffytvs: especially if Ross takes a bid here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|buffytvs: presumably that's a txfr|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure it is|pg||
nt|guppy: well - 3N is even better than than 5m and Piotr found the winning initial action (1N vs. X) to steer them there|pg||
nt|lml: 5@H is a decent save or 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 5@D|pg||
nt|lml: either|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tough call for East now|pg||
nt|lml: With those trump I bet he bids on|pg||
nt|lml: if partner has diamonds it looks like he only has 2.5 losers|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a full 18 with a diamond fit, but does he want to commit to 11 tricks?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: well that will be a steal then|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thgouht he might dbl|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|lml: I think he should bid|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: if partner has nothing else he has good diamonds|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|buffytvs: avoiding the Elvis Coup in diamonds, which as it happens, doesn't cost|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he didnt think clubs was a transfer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he had even better clubs|pg||
nt|lml: otherwise that is sort of a strange lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: what would you have led from his hand?|pg||
nt|lml: the elvis coup|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: keith is looking for some high cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: me too|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|buffytvs: there's a 10 :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h2|nt|lml: fortunately he doesnt need to get to dummy|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|lml: 2@H over 1NT doesnt have to show much but Taylor's hand was less than not much|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|lml: now Piotrk nows the diamond position|pg||
nt|lml: and the club position and the heart position....|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h8|mc|9|nt|lml: so this is a potential pickup for Korbel |pg||
pg||

nt|bridge_one: so may be a swing for E/W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if in open room the contract will be 4@S DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Ostergaardv tells he nearly lead ac - but still it was only nearly :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|roswolf: now e/w need a certain convention called blackwood to avois another plausible slam|pg||
nt|haans: you very rarely can lead nearly|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|roswolf: indeed carl|pg||
nt|haans: long way to slamn here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: here 4@H down because the ruff in @d is obliged to find|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: well the heart interfernce will give the auction momentum|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|haans: but no spade support = down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now can be 2 down because for North it easy the lead with A@D|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sharkey: previous hand I think the line Geoff pointed out previous hand is the most pragmatic - if not the best. Attempt ruff out @CQ - then try @S finesse |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@C IS STANDOUT - how can west pass - momma mia|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: and did Clemmensen have full control of the bidding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A@D 3@D to the return @C|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|sharkey: Or raise to 4@S Vul - cant afford to miss this kond of games|pg||
nt|haans: Hansen may have seen p bid before|pg||
nt|sharkey: *kind|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|bridge_one: this hand is a sample about a big rule: never give informations at opps :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|haans: did 3@S really show good hand?|pg||
nt|haans: not easy to play low clubs|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||

nt|lml: that reaffirms my view that Piotrk may have thought it was clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Piotr|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: I can see no reason for any penalty... they got it all..|pg||
nt|guppy: his choice of opening lead (@cA) also strongly suggested same|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes we discussed that a while ago|pg||
nt|lml: but welcome :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|lml: I guess 2NT shows a heart raise of some sort|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lml: thanks !|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: the C!A is a disappointment to declarer -- it's a trick, but he'd far rather have the @DK for example|pg||
nt|buffytvs: @CA|pg||
nt|lml: true but there is enough to work with in dummy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: oh yes|pg||
nt|lml: this may take a while though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|buffytvs: he could play this as a dummy reversal|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: I think he will just set up diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: probably about now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: seems simplest|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: definitely about now!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he might well guess the diamond position seeing the 9 fall|pg||
nt|lml: I am certain he will guess the position but I am usually wrong|pg||
nt|lml: he knows the spade honors are likely split and Piotr has 0-6 so there isnt much room for diamond honors|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: Piotr has a nice hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: you know how I feel about aces|pg||
nt|buffytvs: going to behard to avoid 3NT, but not sure you can get to 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|lml: yeah I think they can make 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but the spades are friendly, as long as you don't play Restricted Choice|pg||
nt|lml: as long as they guess spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the key is to cash the ace first|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you don[t guess spades, you may be struggling|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|lml: now will these two 4-3-3-3 hands avoid the spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he's oging to get a diamond lead, and will take the inference that North is likely to have longer spades, and play a spade to the king (I think)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: then he may well go wrong|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: guess you cant|pg||
nt|buffytvs: neitehr deterred by the 4333 shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: he is going to need some help from his friends|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but 10 tricks in spades are even more difficult than 9 in NT on this deal|pg||
nt|lml: well the heart lead didnt hurt him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- Keith avoided the club lead|pg||
nt|lml: if he guesses spades there might be some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|buffytvs: which would blow a trick|pg||
nt|lml: so how can you make it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: strip hearts, draw trumps, and play a diamond, hoping North ducks?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|buffytvs: then he has to give a ruff-sluff or play clubs, which would be enough|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|buffytvs: I think Keith is too good a player to be caught that way though|pg||

nt|lml: I learned that a long time ago from Mary Paul|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes i think he'll figure out the spade position|pg||

mb|1C|nt|lml: hands like these I like the opponents to lead a count card against 3NT|pg||

mb|d|nt|lml: especially if South is on lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|lml: well they got the right player on lead for the count card|pg||
nt|buffytvs: when clubs break 3-3, declarer has nine tricks without having to guess where the @DQ is|pg||
nt|lml: if they play that of course|pg||
nt|flash: it'll be a while before they catch up to our starting point and we see changes on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|flash: and we won't have comparisons up until we roll over to Board 1|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: I love the @S2|pg||
nt|flash: i seem to have talked through Board 9 - which looks as though there might be an opportunity for the Flock team|pg||
pc|d7|nt|buffytvs: might be attitude -- do you know what they play?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|lml: I hate it when they play attitude.  Thats why I play attitude|pg||
nt|buffytvs: it's the @S4 that gives him the count in that case|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: but the 2 followed by the 4 coming back do suggest 4-4|pg||
nt|lml: yes!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: South's not likely to have six spades having never bid|pg||

nt|buffytvs: although I like dbl better on east's hand|pg||
nt|lml: or do you think ... my partner is playing me for this|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this just sounds like lots of diamonds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: exactly|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I would be thikning, if all partner needs is third jack of diamonds and an ace, he should have done something stronger|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: gords head is in his hands|pg||
nt|thurston:  ugly hand to lead from|pg||
nt|snoraa: good shot on lead|pg||
nt|thurston:  most effective start a low heart and that was probably Maurice's last choice|pg||
nt|flash: red suit best for the defense - @D8 would have been reasonable?   (but anything might've worked)|pg||
nt|flash: i love the Ten from that holding (if one is going to lead the suit)|pg||
