pc|s7|nt|hawe45:  3 @D looks fine as did 3 @H E/W|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: 3C a very questionable action in 2nd seat with a likely running suit, unless of course partner expects this|pg||

nt|brolucius: West has his 6@H bid, with those cards in the majors. |pg||
nt|psridhar: in 6H after a dia ruff on lead, he may decide ona first round hook |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, but I've changed my mind twice on whether it can make ... I think even dropping @HQ is not enough|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Might change my mind once more :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: dia, dia ruff, h to ace, h to 10, h9, spd to hand draw trumps claim -5sp+4h+diaruff+2c=12|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yep|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So Burke has to save it - how many does 7 minor go down?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: But Roland will say thats the 'hand-records' play, first round h finesse caters to either 9 or 8 stiff in N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: I would go down|pg||
nt|psridhar: % play leads to d1|pg||
nt|brolucius: If South wants to force the dummy, he should overtake the lead and play a diamond back.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wonder if South's big thought over 6@H is relevant|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He wouldn't consider saving with @HQ9xx or @HQ8xx would he?|pg||
