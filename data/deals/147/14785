nt|Walddk2: One team conceded after the first 16|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Off we are with an interesting deal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not often you are dealt such a nice 6-6 hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: deal 1 and W has an 8 card suit -good start !|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 heart makes, 4 spade down 1 on a ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Final, 4 segments of 12 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Team Mragowia has quite a task ahead of them, picking up 53 imps in 12 boards.  Perhaps we can learn something about the tactics for playing from way behind.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|othered1: Hi, everyone from overcast central Pennsylvania,  USA|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Do we know what the running score is here?|pg||
nt|tez: 1@c p 1@s 4@h p p dbl p 4@s all pass?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Partner has enough for slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8221 is 0.19%|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh, our operator forgot to carry forward|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes one sec|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If @CA had been @HA a grand slam even|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Always difficult to bid a slam when the opponents open|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H is a two-suiter|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Unia  40-23|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If the players were hoping for a nice and quiet start, they now need to rethink. This is explosive|pg||
nt|psridhar: and all those low % hands coming to west alone -what wd be odds ?|pg||
nt|tez: down 1 if they find @d ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C Precision-like|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi and welcome to the last set|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good aftenoon all.|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome back|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@H Michaels    2@S  sound raise in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H   Good cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They all seem to have wonderful cards on this auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What about a save in 7@H? Profitable yes but I doubt they will take it IF they bid slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1100 on best defence, but 800 more likely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Short and not so sweet in the closed room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We were told yesterday that the ACBL has barred a 2-level opening that shows both majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't see the wisdom I must confess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D asking for a 4-card major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back|pg||
pc|s8|nt|othered1: Interesting actions EW, since south's 3@H implies some @S length, I think -- assuming 2@D is multi.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Semi-finals, 3 segments of 12 boards. One tonight, two tomorrow|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: how would you defend 4 spades seing the west hand?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Mike Graham|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good evening all.|pg||
nt|othered1: Rehi, everyone|pg||
nt|othered1: North has decision here, with a possible vul game |pg||
nt|VugraphP1: due to technical problems, we could not record play, so i'll just make claim|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: NS Polish Club with a veritable host of gadgets|pg||
nt|psridhar: i dont understd the auction-how did S find 4S on his own on a 5 bagger?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can open 2@H to show hearts and a minor, but not 2@H to show hearts and spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Makes absolutely no sense to me|pg||
nt|othered1: But they went right|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i hope for some action here since the trailing team has to win 54 imps|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi william|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: N-S have a 3.1 IMP carryover, but our software can't accept fractions so we made it 4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At this level it's guessing really. No-one knows who can make what|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: OK, a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As East I would pause for 1 minute, then follow with the 9|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: udca they play- so the 8 will come|pg||
nt|Walddk2: to show I don't have a singleton and want a diamond|pg||
nt|tez: if pikus has 2 card in @h he cant bid 4@s bye self|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't you all play that convention?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i thk they play 1 cl 1 sp 4x pass as forcing|pg||
nt|psridhar: lol|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We can't have a tie, that's the issue|pg||
nt|othered1: Might south's 3@C bid have denied more than one side stopper?|pg||
nt|athene: 54 imps in 12 boards is a very tall order but not outside the realms of possibility, certainly|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Mike Amos|pg||
nt|mamos:  Hello|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Was a challenging deal first up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It worked|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Ralf Willquist|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: but quiet 1nt contracts won't be what the trailing team are hoping for :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TGhe other semi-final is between Svindahl and Goraco|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ralfwil: Hello Roland and Ed|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|othered1: hi, Ralf|pg||
nt|othered1: You need to play well and luckily, especially to find hands amenable to large swings|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: they wont beat this i thk|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos:  East in an uncomfortable spot here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry, other semi-final between Svindahl and Consus|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Goraco playing here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Both pairs are at this table are known at the international stage. N-S won the Vanderbilt 2008, E-W have strong results as juniors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And South's name earns you 2 million points in Scrabble, just not in Poland where you get 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to PS and Tez|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i thk west could have played a heart instead of a club- but difficult to judge|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tez: nice!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psridhar: hi all thx roland|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i thk he will cash out and will be positivley surprised--|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: Hi Tez|pg||

pc|c8|pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/soptqrunda1.html  for running scores|pg||
pc|d9|nt|othered1: Unia has started this second half with a 17 imp lead, that won't be reflected in the running score here.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: classically South's 3@H would imply that he can stand a contract of 3@s or 4@H  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, 3@H|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: that diamond discard suggests things are going to fall for him|pg||
nt|athene: (east's discard i mean)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: so could be based only only three spades |pg||
nt|tez: all lines down 1|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h8|nt|psridhar: I thought Svindahl was an outside team , but all Poland players here|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: one down - next|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sQ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: real score is 44.1-23, some carryover included - we can ignore the .1 for a bit (unless it ends in a tie)|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: so- did you all find the obvious dia ?:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes ably guided by boss|pg||
nt|athene: yes, one of those every board might be enough|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 hearts is fine here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Spade part score most likely|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know EW's system?  Or NS's for that matter.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Must be disappointing for Wiankowski to have been dealt only 6-5 now|pg||
nt|tez: sure we are comandating with open cards|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: BA crew demanding pay rise, you too Mike and Ed?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Anything goes in 3rd at favourable|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  here|pg||
nt|mamos:  no games here|pg||
nt|tez: 1@h 1nt shows long minor and 4 card @s in polish style|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hands up everyone who would respond 1@s at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I remember the last BBO pay rise - it was identical to the previous one  |pg||
nt|othered1: No, we raise rates only once/yr.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But another slam is on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7 is on a heart finesse|pg||
nt|psridhar: normally polish 1D opg shows 5+ dia and unbal hand ..but 3rd seat here and fav vul|pg||
nt|othered1: I was afraid of 1N . . . |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|othered1: me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just as well they set hearts, then they will know they are off 1 keycard and will not bid a grand slam|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s inv+ @d supp|pg||
nt|tomi2: thats not right|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D is either 5+@D but maybe bal 12-14 OR 4+ unbal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 no even better|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Tez|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This may well make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hearts are very friendly|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to P Sridhar (PS)|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all Ty Roland|pg||
nt|psridhar: looks like an explosive start :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: with 10 hcp S had no bid - i wd hv bid 1nt to express my values |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: very moderat 2 spades here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Well, at least it made them stay out of a hopeless game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree with you, Ed, I don't like 1NT one bit|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Assuming a standard opening.  Opposite a limited opening, responding is a matter of partership philosophy|pg||
nt|mamos:  EW playing some limited 1@h|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt|pg||
nt|tez: coming|pg||
nt|psridhar: and a quick pass from W|pg||
nt|tomi2: so this is the normal systematic opening bid|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks easy with that stiff @hK|pg||
nt|othered1: hopeless as the cards lie, but 4@H is not without play on EW cards alone.  They just can't make any useful reevaluations after the 1N opening.|pg||
nt|othered1: Here both Qx holdings are useful.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|tez: 3@h asks @h stoper for 3 nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H by North is presumably showing a solid suit and asking for a heart stop - which South does not have |pg||
nt|psridhar: i prefer 3c fit jump with E hand over 1s-descriptive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I thought you open 1@C with a 12-14 balanced hand|pg||
nt|tomi2: if she had one card in major less and one club more she would open 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: as Roland wd put it :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, passing quickly means that I don't have what I promised and that partner should not double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Vary good convention too|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: effective :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes thats the popular treatment of polish 1c-most of the time weak nt opg|pg||
nt|tomi2: not if you have 5@d, @H or @S, then you open your suit and rebid 1NT to show 122-14 bal with 5 of this suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: since i am watching this i havent seen a lot of unethical things, poles dont have the best fame, but it has improved i thk|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I am not familiar with the 6@C response. Are you, PS?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes but what about 4342 for example?|pg||
nt|tomi2: to open 1@C on 5@D seems to be some Swedish sytlye|pg||
nt|tomi2: that is 1@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he has 7 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: this will be quick|pg||
nt|athene: north might try and guess what contract they will choose in the other room, and go the other way, looking for a swing|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: OK, so 1@D is often 5+|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tez: 4@s is 2 down..with normal defence.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 11|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|psridhar: over 4nt, normally jump to 6c shows odd no of keys + useful void, here i dont know what it meant|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5nt to show even no of keys + useful void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To me that is an odd number of keycards and a useful void (5NT even number)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Personally, I think it's losing bridge to pass 1NT with that West hand|pg||
nt|tez: nice card play tecnique..cash ace..may be droping king:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hej Peter!|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Tez; hi, Peter!|pg||
nt|tez: double finesse is right play in @h..but entry problems|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Someone once told me that one should not let a good player declare 1NT|pg||
nt|tez: welcome Peter /Ed|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mamos:  looks like quite a big pick up for NS|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice tool to have available (and fairly standard) and it certainly showed well here.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and they did respond 1@S at the othe table, and North bid 3@H too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe not the most exciting contracts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They get extras for commentating on difficult slams|pg||
nt|othered1: no, but east will make plenty of tricks.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Flat 8, against the odds to move with the West cards|pg||
nt|othered1: Might EW find game in the other room?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And the lead was also quite helpful|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree with not acting on west's hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They did not, West also passed in the CR|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much point pressing non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|psridhar: we were only joking -not insinuating at all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Come on, it should be pretty easy to spot that I was kidding|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ok for me!:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I'll remember :)  :)  :)  :)  next time|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: there were times when we werent kidding------:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: Pikus doesnt know h jack is falling doubleton so will hv an ancient moment or two|pg||
nt|psridhar: sry anxious |pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Tez|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt/4major guesses are borderline anyway so it's a good way to get a possible swing without being in a greatly inferior spot|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|janhamhurg: but 4 hearts is off- so they will win a lot here|pg||
nt|tez: and Ralf sure.sry |pg||
nt|tez: hi:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psridhar: S wd like to play h twice towards tbl...but only one entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Until the 50's we had a club suit, and until the 80's we had 1NT openings with balanced hand only. Those were the days|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't cost to let East in|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: But it's all a matter of agreement|pg||
pc|h7|nt|janhamhurg: so will he play a finess or try to drop the ace doubleton|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room N-S sold out to 2@S|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 4 with a 4441 pattern|pg||
nt|othered1: It just so often underevaluates hands for suit play.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tomi2: yes, 4441 1444 xx45 are the cases when you often have only 4 cards|pg||
nt|psridhar: in any case 3d is a par contract here|pg||
nt|psridhar: shd make|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4144 some prefere to open 1@C and rebid 1@S after partners 1@H bid, dont know what is standard there, I open the better suit in that case|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: If he has another spade they can only take five tricks at best|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then it seems that a certain amount of confusion arose, as they tried 3NT with no heart stopper - after a double, too |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|janhamhurg: now the moment of truth|pg||
nt|psridhar: unless S finds a way to show values over his pd's 1h, selling out to 2s is likely|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes good bidding here   game explored and rejected wisely|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Katich out, lbw|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Jan Lammerich|pg||
pc|c8|nt|tez: danger line..if they play 1 more @c|pg||

pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: Previous set was not particularly well played I think it's fair to say|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|othered1: of course, the other room bid the same way, so I guess in this match, 1N is the normal bid and anything else swingy.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tez: :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tomi2: but you always can raise 1@D with 3 card support if you have no other bid available, because you have either a fit or pd is unbal, so 4-3 may play well|pg||

nt|othered1: I think the not letting a good player declare 1N has much more impact at pairs, especially in heterogenous fields.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s on E looks better than on W|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I use that word about 14 times a day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: heterogenous|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i guess its hot in poland as well and they have been playing a lot of hands the last days|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|pelu: Pikus has to find the lead against 4@s - @c or 2x @h and @c|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 heart here possible, but they wont bid it|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|othered1: transfer response?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if this is Polish Club, 1@C is the 12-14 balanced variety|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Really disappointing, no 6-6 or 6-5 now|pg||
nt|pelu: oh I exp that West would open 1@s :(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Probably a good idea not to open the West hand. 4@S can be set, but it requires a double dummy defence if East is declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He must lead a heart|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|tez: 3@h and 4@h (estimate)|pg||
nt|pelu: both hand has a naturel @d-lead|pg||
nt|tez: qt9x against axxx  right play is cash ace..then play to ten..its %69.2174 |pg||
nt|athene: north might view to pass 2@C|pg||
mb|2H|an| |mb|p|nt|mdgraham: however for 2@H by South, 1@D must be hearts  |pg||
nt|othered1: south likely showed 4-card support for north's @H suit.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we're not sure what systems are being played here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 12+12=....|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 9 card spd fit shd win the auction|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 heart is forcing here i hope:)|pg||
nt|tez: 2nt or 3 nt?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like redouble at all with 5-card support|pg||
nt|othered1: I like west's sound non-opening, even if it has been falling out of favor.|pg||
nt|tez: for 3 or 4 trick |pg||
nt|athene: looks like a huge misfit so you might be able to earn a small swing when they are going down in the other room|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: pass is normal action i thk|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yeah, this is the end|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d gf|pg||
nt|tomi2: and note that in Poland you don't have to alert 1@C. Only if you play that as 4+@C and nonforcing, you need to alert :)|pg||
nt|tez: nice points bad distribution|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3nt will be an interesting struggle for the declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bid 2NT as Truscott/Jordan|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=8502  Piotr Wiankowski|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: he has 9 tricks but has to play carefully|pg||
nt|tez: 2nt my choise nonevuln|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk he will make it , finessing dia 2nd round after jack falls on his left|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think 2nt-3nt does not depend on your actual hand. It depends more on parters style of opening bids, his declarer skills and your opps defending skills|pg||
nt|tomi2: say if you partner opens every 11 bal count non vuln you cant push to game with this hand but if he sometimes passes bad 12, you can do|pg||
nt|psridhar: for starters it is tempting to hope the lead is from qj|pg||
nt|tez: he afraids @s shift|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: playing safe you make 8 tricks only |pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Making on the nose|pg||
nt|psridhar: a club ruff may hv beaten it -dia lead wont do any harm|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3s is a mild overbid, he has a nice min..but that stiff dia worries me|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 6 is down- so will they stopp?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: another partscore here, no chance to make game|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to make a decision early whether to grab a couple of ruffs in hand along with the aces and a club ruff|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: I dont understand the RD from W - only a way to let opp find the defense - why not 2NT or just 4@S?? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now she has given South the chance to find the killing lead|pg||
nt|othered1: I once played redouble with support was game-forcing.  west's hand might meet that standard . . . |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|tez: 1@s overcall worked|pg||
nt|tez: they have all controls but not enuf pover..|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i thk 3 is fine but south is min|pg||
nt|psridhar: now S cannot sign off 4h -bcos that wd show no control in club|pg||
nt|pelu: he know he will bid 4@S - why not bid that - It's practical bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There you go|pg||
nt|othered1: north is minimum for his actions (except for good @S)?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|pelu: west only has himself to blame|pg||
nt|othered1: what would 3m by north mean?|pg||
nt|athene: or whether to try and keep trump control and actually get the long clubs going|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: yes - this looks eminently makeable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Daisy-picking (as Kelsey would have named it) cost|pg||
nt|othered1: As a matter of tactics, I agree with an immediate 4@S.  Was looking for a rationale for west's action.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|psridhar: and S had no clue which minor will fetch|pg||
nt|tez: and singleton @d is not so nice|pg||
nt|psridhar: thats why that 3s was an overbid, since it commits him tocross 4h over 4d|pg||
nt|tez: are they playing udca?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Baard Olav Aasan|pg||
nt|psridhar: it was a pure guess|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but  a lot of queens of  doubtfull value|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: he shouldnt ruff with the quenn:)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: queen|pg||
nt|athene: you end up having to ruff in hand twice anyway, so i think this has to be more of a crossruff/elopement|pg||
pc|h4|nt|baardolav: Good moorning all|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 m would be GF|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psridhar: gud morning Baard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What's wrong with 2NT, Ed?|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry herself - sorry-sorry|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: N shd remember his pd bid 4s ; did not use 4nt why?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Watson out, lbw, 20-2|pg||
nt|tomi2: they might play smith peter|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: I don't understand this line. He is only in 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he could go down|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 6 will be down 1- hard to find the problem in the bidding, i think south schould sign off....but who knows|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hihi|pg||
nt|tez: hi Thomas:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi Thomas|pg||
nt|tez: udca=up side count attitude|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i thk, about 7 with 5-4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: nice @CK|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: A quiet 140 EW for a nice 2-way partial pick-up, 6 imps|pg||
nt|tomi2: N/S should have an agreement about 4@D (or 3NT) asking for club control only while the other bid askes about the quality of the hand|pg||
nt|tomi2: udca is quite sure. |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|psridhar: cant afford to duck this 2nd h|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tez: partscore swing |pg||
nt|othered1: When the @D finesse comes home|pg||
nt|othered1: brb|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and will|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes- he cd hv pitched his losing dia on dummy's club ater|pg||
nt|psridhar: later|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: 2@d was tr, but N didn't alert|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh I see|pg||
nt|psridhar: or even finessed for it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Alert missing then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So declarer thought South would follow to the 3rd diamond|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: That changes things|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3NT after 3@S should not be a suggestion to play this|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: Is 2NT not a high card spade raise?|pg||
nt|othered1: Lets north get in at 3-level or double of 2N to get defense right, as here.  But here north might not act|pg||
nt|othered1: By north over 2N, I meant|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I suspect the TD will be summoned|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D is neg dbl with 5+@H in the N-S methods but it was not alerted on East's side of the screen|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: TD summoned...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Certainly, East has been damaged by the missing alert|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: I am pretty sure the TD will come to the same conclusion|pg||
nt|psridhar: E can contend that dia ruff was a safe entry to tbl for trump play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed he can|pg||
nt|psridhar: he was kind f ruffing a winner- i am sure it was to play trump off the tbl|pg||

nt|pelu: after the D in S west dont exp slam - so I prefer 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Certainly better than redouble|pg||
nt|tez: i like Ewa's play and bidding in this tournament.except this hand|pg||
nt|tez: brb|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: another 18 point hand|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: here we have a critical 3 no|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Sure, the TD will give a ruling after he has had a closer look. That is normal procedure|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|an| |nt|psridhar: back to wild west -this time with a 7-4|pg||
nt|tomi2: would somebody open N's cards differently than Gierulski?|pg||
nt|tez: me|pg||
nt|tez: i would open 2@s:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: and treat the hand as a 2-suiter?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: He does not have to decide anything at the table right now|pg||
nt|tez: 9/12|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder what double implies.  @D?  General strength in a flat hand?|pg||
nt|pelu: here I play: RD = bid your suit,l and 2@H - my suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ed, we were told yesterday that the ACBL has barred any 2-openings that show both majors, 2@H for example. Can you explain the logic behind that decision?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H  hearts and a minor allowed, 2@H both majors barred|pg||
nt|othered1: No.  Protecting the field from invisible menaces.|pg||
nt|othered1: Does that include the 4@S - 5@H F-word convention?  Or Reverse F-word?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is not particularly breathtaking either. Just as well, Mike can confirm that it's incredibly hot in London atm|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: here 4 spade makes- 1 point less though|pg||
mb|2N|nt|othered1: lots of modern players will overcall at 1-level with a long suit, strength irrelevant.|pg||
nt|psridhar: at times the TD consults experts also b4 ruling|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Back to normal, 6-6 for West :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7420 = 0.36%|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: unlucky game, but makes on a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think so, just the weak version|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They don't bar American conventions|pg||
nt|pelu: the most common use of X = balanced 13-15 or 16|pg||
nt|pelu: 16+ 1 suited|pg||
nt|othered1: There is no chance whatever that they'd apply it to something Hamman-Zia, Weinstein-Levin and Martel-Stansby play, so it will continue to be safe.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Worked on the previous hand, too.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's a bidders game these days|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: that's not wrong, Roland|pg||
nt|dimi: E-W can play some in majors, NS can play some in minor - no game available|pg||
nt|Walddk2: (Look at 13 and 14)|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4s shd make even losing 3 trump tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I was pointed to this card for NS:  http://www.polbridge.pl/_stara/kadra/2007/open/supermecz3/cc/gierulski_skrzypczak.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: West might have raised to 3@C there, with those majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but now NS have found their heart fit|pg||
nt|tez: 3@h for me|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: four-card trump support not to be sneezed at|pg||
nt|tez: 3@h good 2@s opening|pg||
nt|tomi2: can S now imagine an At9x sidefit and a void? I think 6@C is a decent spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: nice natural auction i like it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Something is wrong with that dealing programme it seems|pg||
nt|psridhar: S doesnt know abt the h void opposite -hence thinks his h is not a weak spot in 3nt|pg||
nt|tomi2: K&R (KJ9832 --- Txx AT9x) = 12.35   Kapland/Rubens treats this as an opening bid. opening 1@S will work out well verytime partner will not bid 2@H|pg||
nt|psridhar: now a spade guess shd see him thru|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: one of the worst bids for me, an invitational stayman without 4 card major suit|pg||
nt|athene: yes, it can't be a good idea to tell opps that partner has 4 spades and not 4 hearts, just for nothing|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psridhar: but dia break is bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a mighty good lead and should doom the contract|pg||
nt|tez: this is real 3@h opening..lesson hand:)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so now will make i thk, declarer will find the queen|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: if West does raise to 3@C, Norht is kinda stuck|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer can't get to dummy in time|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes 2 minor tricks will be lost in addn|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tomi2: leading middle from tree small is not only systematic, its also very popular in Poland. I do not liks those leads vs 3NT in IMPs|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|tomi2: these Championships are part of the very nice Bridge Festival in Sopot (close to Gdansk at the Baltic Sea). I already hadd my flight tickets and an offer from Wiankowski to stay in ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: his home, but for several reasons I had to cancel my trip :(  nice that I can participate via BBO anyway :)|pg||
nt|athene: declarer knows the defence are going to attack hearts as soon as they get in, so he probably won't be able to hunt for the @DQ *and* duck a spade for a 3-3 break|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's first thought has to be that south, with fewer clubs, is more likely to have the @DQ, surely?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: you can argue that the queen is with south bec of the club distribution|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: y were quicker|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|othered1: True|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East's double usually just shows a decent hand, as opposed to what you might overcall with |pg||
nt|pelu: will US just go back to the conventions played in the 50'es?|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that if south does have something like @DQ9xx it's not really possible to untangle four diamond tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although double would be a good option, if that shows what North has got - some small spade support plus a few hearts|pg||
nt|tomi2: but I think this style coms from all those MP tourneys that are played in Poland all the time. In those festivals (exept of this one / this year) you usualy play 8 days MP and one ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: day IMP|pg||
nt|tez: @c lead give chanse for down..if @h lead..he will put k of @s..because @h shift kills to declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No wonder that bridge is declining on that side of the pond. They chase the youngsters away with all the restrictions|pg||
pc|d7|nt|janhamhurg: do you really think that the programms represent the statistics?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: This one doesn't|pg||
nt|tomi2: teams eleminated in the previous rounds have lots of other pairs tournaments available, after sunday there will be a total classification. Last yeat Nowosadzki won this event|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 8 easy tricks|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer's aim might be to grab three diamond tricks and then duck a spade |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tez: why not @s before?|pg||
nt|psridhar: can 3nt make? that 10 of spd is useful but i fancy it will go down too|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dimi: will easily make|pg||
nt|tez: ''chance''|pg||
nt|tomi2: wests @S7 was a try to show that she wanted him to switch so some other suit|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|psridhar: in other room declarer lost trump control when he cashed h ace too soon to prevent a dia ruff|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psridhar: if they find the dia lead other tbl thi match will tighten|pg||
pc|h4|nt|janhamhurg: most dont- the problem is, that dull 1 notrump hand noone likes to play and see- so they just manipulate the programm same in bbo for sure:)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|janhamhurg: so here the first(much needed ) swing to north/ south|pg||
nt|athene: north must be careful not to get thrown in to lead a club|pg||
pc|c5|pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: "Welcome to our world, but you can't play A, B,C, D, X, Y and Z"|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|tez: It's strange for me to play trump before playing long side suit|pg||
nt|tomi2: her MUD play in clubs was not systematic, so I guess she wanted to signal values in hearts that way. Olech now can hold his @D and score a beer in the end :)|pg||
nt|tez: with close cards super defence|pg||
nt|othered1: OKJ, let's go back to the 50's.  Roth-Stone and Kaplan-Sheinwold would still be available.   And KS remains quite playable.|pg||

nt|pelu: tes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe I missed something|pg||
nt|pelu: then I missed it also :):)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: finally a possible game to bid and make|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i thk gierulski is exhausted- normally a player like that see s the danger|pg||
nt|athene: north should get that right perhaps - if declarer had the @SJ too she would have 18 hcp - isn't that too much for 1nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: strictly forbidden with 18|pg||
mb|1C|nt|tez: he was desperate at @S K trick|pg||
nt|baardolav: More normal hands now... seems like a 3nt ew|pg||
nt|psridhar: deals 13/14/16 -all massive to suiters; only 15 was an exception|pg||
nt|psridhar: two suiters|pg||
nt|psridhar: there is the Roland example of 1c opg with 4 dia |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@h 1@c 1 @c ruff and @sA =9|pg||
nt|othered1: May be unlucky if NS find their @H game.  Will EW give them reason to avoid it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West's approach on board 15 cost 10 IMPs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks in nt on N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D is Multi, weak with one major|pg||
nt|othered1: Or either minor from north|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: 4@S-5@C?|pg||
nt|mamos:  hmmm  not exactly text book 3@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: if S X - the West could bid 3@h - pass/correct or even 3@S|pg||
nt|othered1: There's a clear warning that bad things could happen in a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: easier to make than to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|othered1: Easy game in NT or either minor, as cards lie.|pg||
nt|dimi: 3nt by E-W|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as to whether it shows any strength, that is a different question |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is a great contract, 5 of either mi also makes|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C over 1@C is natural while 2@D after 11C is used as some artifical overcall|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D - 4@D (with no X) for me is : bid your suit, 4@C = bid belove yout suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I play like you Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I guess their 3 bids in minors are very sound, suit-wise|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: nice 3@s opening:)he has sequence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My partners never have those suits when they pre-empt, more like Jxxxxx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or Jxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: it's a pretty solid suit, if you ignore the AKQJ|pg||
nt|tez: semi solid..if he has 7 of @s he will get canasta:)|pg||
nt|othered1: EW are now > 30 imps behind in the match.  That may have something to do with the preempt, if they are judging the state of the match correctly|pg||
nt|mamos:  worked out well for East|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 62.1-31, according to the web site|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but will pick up 6 imps here|pg||
nt|mamos:  no one bid over 3s at the other table|pg||
nt|tez: olech says to declarer..i opened 3@s..doesnt matter..put any @s from dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Surprising. Looks a normal-ish raise to 4@S|pg||
nt|mamos:  well 4@H looks good foe NS so EW may have thought they had good score|pg||
nt|mamos:  in CR|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: The most common hand pattern (by far) is 4432, around 21% of the time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Goraco back in the match. 11 IMPs on 4|pg||
nt|psridhar: the m/c heard u sadistically jan :)|pg||
nt|tez: dbl is T/O to @c:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Slam can make from North's chair, just not 6@H. 6@D and 6NT are OK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not so good with 5@c on S|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 1 ace and 3 jacks--pass|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psridhar: oh 4-4-3-2 is more freq than 5-3-3-2?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh yes, by a county mile|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me see if I can find a link|pg||
nt|psridhar: rare to see 2nt on 25 hcp|pg||
nt|pelu: NS landed on their feet - the slam is almost impossible to bid|pg||
nt|othered1: NS have avoided the @H trap, which can be apick-up in itself.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|baardolav: Yes... both east and west downsized their hands...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_Hand_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|psridhar: on h lead 3nt may not make so EW may be right dbl dummy|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|dimi: true :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Matter of style to me.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, pre-empt in 2nd should have full value|pg||
nt|kubusiu: yes, 3m should be with a good suit|pg||
nt|othered1: KQJ10xxx enough?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, stiff ace|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|dimi: in second hand the preempt should be reasonable |pg||
nt|tez: they didnt find @h fit:)NS|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: duck a dia is safe|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: was fooled by the 1 no bid without stop|pg||

nt|baardolav: good morning Tez|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi Tez|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's worth noting that the most balanced of them all, 4333, is way down the list in 5th place. I am not sure many realise that|pg||
nt|psridhar: a nice evaluation of his 7-4|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|janhamhurg: 7-4 is almost everywhere treated as 8 card preemt- only the suit quality is more  important. since you have only 7|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: slamtime!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|tez: CR stoped in 4@s|pg||
nt|tez: hard for me:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Normal 4@S in CR, but 6 isn't the worst contract ever seen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I suspect that 2@D would not be natural for E-W|pg||
nt|baardolav: many playes for 4333 at the first place...|pg||
nt|psridhar: this Bd can lead to a 5 level decision for EW if N saves 5D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here is another slam|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: a very agressiv 4 spade bid at the other table gave 10 more to the leaders|pg||
nt|jtr: Non-Polish|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this is more like it|pg||
nt|othered1: They're in the large majority|pg||
nt|dimi: great slam, 6@s |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C game-forcing relay I think. Doesn't promise clubs|pg||
nt|dimi: specs told me7 ...true :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6-6 is not even listed|pg||
nt|tez: neck n neck macht .i love it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 no is fine|pg||
nt|tez: 5@d coming|pg||
nt|psridhar: Can make 5h -but will they settle for 500 in 5d X?|pg||
nt|pelu: in NT, @S and even in @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 6nt is best|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because Frank Svindahl is non-Polish|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Norwegian rather|pg||
nt|jtr: But his partner.....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|othered1: 5 boards gone, a total of 2 imps scored.  Just what Svindahl ordered.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 190 is a poor result|pg||
nt|athene: ouch! bad judgement in the other room|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: Whether they can find the grand slam is a different issue|pg||
nt|dimi: will they make their way to 7@S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C can be 18+ any|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: 4@H would be a nice barrage|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wiankowski needs to find aout about 3 keycards, trump queen and a club control|pg||
nt|othered1: west's isn't an easy hand to bid in any system.  Maybe a strong jump-shift would work.  You'd at least get to whatever slam if partner showed @CK.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now they are all talking, because they get extra for commentating on difficult slams|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And we have two of those and one 6-5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: we had|pg||
nt|tez: i belive he will bid 5@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I am sure Polish players can play other systems too|pg||
nt|jtr: So they could play Standard by West and Polish @c by East:)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so there were about 100 poles and 1 norwegian- and the later won...|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: my guess is 4 hearts or 4 spades|pg||
nt|athene: west will be a bit worried about his partner getting forced in spades, i a 5-3 heart fit|pg||
nt|athene: her partner sorry|pg||
nt|athene: so she might go for 5@C|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Let's see how she shows that now|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@h??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Positive hand with both majors is my guess|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told - tx = 5@s+4@h 5-8 HCP|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mamos:  14-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wian will discover the three keycards and @SQ, but what about the C control?|pg||
nt|dimi: grand slam with 26 points always a great achievement!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 13, 14, 16|pg||
nt|tez: 2@c p p 2@d?|pg||
nt|psridhar: once again N is up against it- values that he cannot show opp an o/c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: uh oh, both majors again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He won't win this board I think|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: for sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Possible big swing for Mragowia|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless Gierulski takes the "save"|pg||
nt|jtr: Not teh thing to do when far behind|pg||
nt|jtr: the|pg||
nt|jtr: You forced them to guess with 5@c so why let them off when they guess wrong?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: the problem was the 3 heart bid, east thought more of that than west- noone shoul correct himself after preemting|pg||
nt|jtr: I think Suwik should pass 5@c  6@h is playing poker|pg||
nt|jtr: Which is fair enough maybe|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone understand the auction in the CR?|pg||
nt|athene: of coure, when opps bid 4@S, that solves the problem of whether to play 4@H or 5@C :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mamos:  splinter?|pg||
nt|psridhar: bd17- we missed an opportunity for an interesting defense to 3nt- h lead and DUCKED outright |pg||

nt|pelu: its called Reversed (F)?|pg||
nt|othered1: Can't 4@H be a swing, too?|pg||
nt|tez: 5/3 better than 4/4 here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes Ed, but South is playing it well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he will prevail|pg||
nt|othered1: What was 3@C?|pg||
nt|pelu: a bet? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Search me|pg||
nt|jtr: 3.2345% i am told Roland  Right up your street?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  ah game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, he knows that the grand slam is no worse than on a finesse through the hand with more black cards|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Pass may show three keys|pg||
nt|mdgraham: most pairs play some variant of DOPI/ROPI|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Odd number og keycards I presume|pg||
nt|dimi: NS made life really hard to explore the grand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But can't that be 1?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's see|pg||
nt|tez: they know now minus 11 imp lost on board 4|pg||
nt|psridhar: wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 1N should keep north from having any thoughts of slam|pg||
nt|tomi2: the winner of this match will play against team Svindahl. Their opps already withdraw after 2 segments|pg||
nt|tez: she sry|pg||
nt|athene: the CR auction was natural :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: South's hand is rather good for play in a black suit to open 1N, unless needed to keep the system together.  In natural approaches, it would be a pro-am bid.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 4NT is RKCB, it makes sense to use pass as step 3 - two keys without|pg||
nt|othered1: Is 4N guaranteed to have @S key?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however if pass/double are steps 1 and 2, you need to differentiate between the 0/3 and 4/1 options|pg||
nt|othered1: If not, east might now think he has extras to go on.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My thoughts too, Ed. Can East know that spades are set?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which may not be too easy - so credit to NS for this barrage|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, he knows *now*|pg||
nt|othered1: *Now* he can.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tez: 1nt 2@c 2@s 3@h(any shortness) 3@s/asks) 4@c 4@h 4nt..|pg||
nt|psridhar: bold bidding by N|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N is best (by a lot) isn't it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West is thinking, South is not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You mean 6NT?|pg||
nt|tez: they are playing with screen|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: E: max 9HCP, 5-4 @s-@h, should be str with @C|pg||
nt|pelu: now I see how 4@Hs was making - trick 1; @S lead to J and K - defense didnt get the @SA|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: oh, sry it's W who should be str w @C|pg||
nt|athene: west decided he didn't have a very good hand, and he thought 3@C was quite high enough|pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1: These considerations come up at committees after west takes a while to bid 6@S.  But they are considerations.|pg||
nt|othered1: Do  you have agreements for handling RKC in the midst of preemption?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe a GF 2NT response (Jacoby-like) is the answer with that hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then there is no ambiguity later|pg||
nt|psridhar: what happened Pepsi? he had a strong team?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|baardolav: Gierrulski is working really hard for this hand... |pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, some strong teams did not make it to the 1/4 finales or lost there|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wd hv put my money on pepsi at start of the tourney|pg||
nt|othered1: This will pretty much end Mragowia's chances.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psridhar: bidding 2c on an aceless hand and a moderate suit VUL in an auction where no fit was found by oppo was bold enuf-he followed it by a X of 2d also|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: he was sure about shortness in clubs- and he was right- he was sure west to have a good suit- and he was wrong:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: This N-S pair is good. You do not win the Vanderbilt if you aren't. They did in 2008|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes-they will beat this by one|pg||
nt|tez: pass is ok for you to dbl?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tez: Ewa is in form this tournament|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The lead was not important as some specs suggest. North could have led his right shoe and still beat it|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jtr: Throwing shoes can be dangerous in certain countries|pg||
pc|c3|nt|janhamhurg: by now the north south here and the east west in the other room are frustrated, they just dont play good bridge anymore|pg||

nt|othered1: That would be a fine method here|pg||
nt|psridhar: i would hv defended 1N...but then i hv not won vandy :)|pg||

pc|h5|nt|tomi2: "Pepsi" was playing with Jassem, Buras and Narkiewicz, they were among the favorites for sure. Lots of the players involved will travel to New Orleans son to play the nationals ...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 3 segments of 12 boards in the finals, this is the second. 4 segments of 12 boards in the final later today|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 x 12 in the SFs I meant to say|pg||
nt|tez: The partner who could not bid 2 @c over 1 @h might have less points.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We think that 15 might be a push as there is a TD ruling pending|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  1.12-14 balanced - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. Any 18+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5-5-3-0  is 0.90%|pg||
nt|psridhar: clubs dont run in 1N but they present usefull entries for spd finesses|pg||
nt|tez: dbl=majors i thk|pg||
nt|tomi2: dbl in Poland in 4th position is often some Kind of "I think this hand belongs slightly to us, lets increase the stacks"|pg||
nt|psridhar: aggressive balancing entry into the auction, no maj fit exists, can get clobbered now|pg||
nt|tez: cash 1 more @s..if t of @s drops..cash @h's..play q of @d.pitch k of @s from dummy |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: 2@d=option 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D artificial game force with 3+ spades|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: missing 2 aces - so no slam here|pg||
nt|tez: nice 6@s only 2 aces left:)|pg||
nt|tomi2: most pairs do not play direct penalty doubles, so if partner has some 14 or 15 points he/she can easily pass. with a week hand they often find a spot to play themselves|pg||
nt|tez: will be end 2@c dbl|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk N will sit for this 1nt X-make overtrick hopefully |pg||
nt|othered1: You were right, south did play 4@H on 17 very well in CR, with a little help from the auction.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|othered1: this will h ide north's @S support.  East may bid anyway.|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4 dia and club ace is all EW can get - 380 is likely|pg||
nt|tomi2: this is also a stlye that works out nicely in MP tourneys, 200 will give you a huge top if you time your double well and defend correctly while -180 will be bad of course, but if ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: you make it right more then 50% of the time you will score well|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: there are some players who would NEVER pass now in the East seat...|pg||
nt|tez: Ewa again found best lead:)|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@Cs would make if @DQ drop - 5@D no chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and for that matter, after 1@S-2@s with the West hand|pg||
nt|mamos:  making 2@S looks good from CR|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree on both auctions -- action needed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S  5 cards (I think)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: we will hear the breaks -|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: their auction has given them lots of room here for exploration.  Impressive so far.|pg||
nt|tez: all pass now|pg||
nt|psridhar: and if you combine all those odds in the 4 bds, we may hv a micronic probability event-but it happened now|pg||
nt|tez: 3@d is not my style|pg||
nt|psridhar: flattish 650 i expect|pg||
nt|othered1: and on 17, as has been ponted out, with help from EW, who took no @S trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry have to leave now! thx all and have a nice evening:)|pg||
nt|tez: ty ralf|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S X -1 (100) if the par-score|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psridhar: however declarer has to find 3 pitches from dummy..if he retains all clubs , then he may lose a trick-he shd keep 2 spd for 2 finesses|pg||
nt|tomi2: other room had the same start but W escaped and found himself in a not confortable spot|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: and seeing that EW have a decent play for 4@H, perhaps they are right|pg||
nt|kubusiu: running scores: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/soptsrunda1.html|pg||
nt|othered1: I gues their methods require up the line control showing.  At one time, many experts didn't approve of first cue-bids being made on voids, but times have changed considerably|pg||
nt|pelu: if 4NT is a try to get @C in play = a very nice bid, but...?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: You shrug and pass 2@S, Tez?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3@d should indicate a much stronger hand|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: open dards after the opening lead|pg||
nt|jtr: On the last hand, maybe 5@d was right by East?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told 3@S asks for void.  Perhaps there were other implications to the earlier @S calls.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I see from the web site that there is a 4.1 imp carryover |pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting that South has bypassed 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: if north showed a void, that's a lot of duplication.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did 2@S imply a minimum for the 1@S response, 8+?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8-9 maybe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: do we know if 2@S showed anyhting particular?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 7-9 hcp, thanks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and five spades.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks all :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a little better than 7-9, isn't it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would also pass 2@S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: 3@D is an attempt to get to a better spot, but the hand should be stronger for it in my opinion|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: stoppp|pg||
nt|tez: all cards are right place|pg||
nt|tez: except @d T|pg||
nt|psridhar: u make a bal X of 1nt-find pd with 10 hcp ;a dia suit in an 8 card fit, and in 2D u go for 800-thats the E hand for u :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: When 2@D promises a fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: pd heard the take out X on his right , i bid red suits; he still chose 2s, i respect his decision|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|othered1: I'm told, now, that 4@C was just shortness, while 3N would  have denied shortness anywhere|pg||
nt|dimi: well done|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|tez: 3@d is invitation hand imo 5/5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT made at the other table on 18|pg||
nt|pelu: so 4NT was just to play - very diff to bid 5@C (and with @DQ10 x in S - same result|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: The other room stopped in 2@S, but by N-S :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: with @HK instead of @HA he is trying to get correct count signals|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: this is also the sort of thing you get on Appeal Committees, when North goes on over a slow 4@S. Not that that was the case here, we presume|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: East is not too unhappy|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tomi2: both, E and W might thimk their partner has the ace so I must show him the cound to make him duck correctly|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|tomi2: he might know the total count of the hand. @S3 suggested 4spades, hearts seem to be 4 as well and after @D3 lead but no continuation @D seem to be 4-4 also|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|dimi: will be a fast claim after @d situation is clear|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psridhar: this bd will see a new leader in the match-even accounting for the diro ruling|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/krets/medlem_detalj.asp?Spillernummer=11617   Frank Svindal, Norwegian Grand Master|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: Svindahl, sry|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be but there was a heart fit for sure- so i prefer 5 hearts or a forcing pass|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|tomi2: @CQ now by west could make S not finessing spades|pg||
nt|pelu: by 5@C from Olechy sh be naturel and here W could pass|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: possible diamond plays: (1) 2-2. Doesn't matter. (2) 3-1. Cash the ace, or lead the queen to pin the singleton 10 or jack  |pg||
pc|c7|nt|psridhar: +200 in both rooms for the same team|pg||
nt|psridhar: 9 imps|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: Leading the queen here would be a Bad Idea.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: Sadly, 5@D would also have been down if the diamond finesse had been on|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|jtr: Surely 5@d implies a @h fit?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: 26-17 but perhaps 21-17 if EW get the 5 IMPs back to board 15|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

nt|h_karluk: hi all|pg||
nt|pelu: in board 18 EW bid to 6NT - they found the @H-fit but bid 6NT = +11 IMP|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and what do you do with 7 solid dia?|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose you might bid 3nt NS here if you really needed imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Then 5 IMPs will be subtracted from NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tez: dbl|pg||

mb|p|nt|tez: dbl |pg||
nt|Walddk2: done, thank you|pg||
nt|tez: do you bid 2@h with S'S HAND? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unlikely to happen here|pg||
nt|psridhar: questionable 2c o/c , but it has led to the spd fit for NS|pg||
nt|athene: the hearts might get blocked so it might come home but all a bit unlikely|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: even @DQ works - East would be endplayed. Oh well :)|pg||
nt|dimi: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 3@s goes 1 down i thk|pg||
nt|othered1: The opening bid may keep them out|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: who would balance?|pg||
nt|othered1: north may optimistically think of good 6-card @C suit and a trick somewhere else and try to get lucky|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: SN will defend this 3h|pg||
nt|othered1: but if south bids 2N, they'll be there.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: finally a try!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|tomi2: trump lead now?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos:  1@S denied majors I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just 40 IMPs exchanged over 19 boards. Often a sign of good bridge and it has been, last night and this morning|pg||
nt|psridhar: i think NS will reach 4H even if Gierulski passed 1s|pg||
nt|tez: 3 of @s is suit preferance for@c|pg||
nt|psridhar: the question is should EW have found the 4s save|pg||
nt|psridhar: NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 27-3  Clarke bowled|pg||
nt|pelu: 22-1 to Mragowia on 6 boards|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Ball swinging and seaming around|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening|pg||
nt|jtr: Hi Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe a disappointment for Skrz, but this will make with an overtrick|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N, scrambling?|pg||
nt|dimi: 1 down i think|pg||
nt|psridhar: this wont make|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: best lead here|pg||
nt|psridhar: -100 likely|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psridhar: 4s can be beaten by a trump lead|pg||
nt|tez: or trump shift|pg||
nt|psridhar: if 3s X by W showed xtra length -6 cards here- then E can compete 4s|pg||
nt|othered1: And none of it looks undeserved.|pg||
nt|athene: there's no way declarer can know to rise @HK on the second round, though|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|othered1: Was that a "I thought seriously about bidding" huddle before the pass?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 9 tricks... not a good idea to bid 2 clubs and pass the x|pg||
nt|Walddk2: His baby trumps are worth nothing|pg||
nt|athene: he's hoping to get his partner in for a few club ruffs, but it's askin quite a bit of a passed hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: a tad unlucky - finesse for @DK through the opening bidder|pg||
nt|dimi: true|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still 1-1 at point-a-board|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S never got into the auction next door. That 2@H overcall is not obvious, is it?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: *asking|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not needed still blocks so 9 tricks sure|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i agree unless they play strictly 2.4th|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h3|nt|othered1: Mragowia made some good decisions|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|psridhar: S might hv Xed 3S in the other room -only way to reach that 4h|pg||
nt|athene: ah yes sorry they still block because east can't get rid of the eight|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|tez: nice duck|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be only 50 we will see- but correct not to bid 3 spades, only 8 trumps sugest a pass|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but passing with the north hand is scary|pg||
nt|jtr: Dummy had a couple of useful cards|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|psridhar: time running out for Goraco -now just 4 bds to catch up 15 imps|pg||

pc|h8|pc|s8|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and there will be a smile on his face|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: he won't smile yet; not until both follow to the @DK :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a pity whilst earlier this week NS played so extremely well imo|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: did he really throw a dia?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he had given up, assuming he was one down at least|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|othered1: 8 tricks for NS and if east had had @DQJ, there would have been a squeeze, but nothing going here|pg||
nt|othered1: or @D length|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't th ink a @D split and black squeeze is possible, so north has to make a decision on @C position.  Lack of 9 sort of forced his hand|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: 4 hearts make|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: Can NS stop in time here?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Do you have an angreement about redouble in this auction?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think many have|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: but sometimes that will cost 200 instead of 100- so you must be right sometimes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jtr: Made the right choice|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be an endplay for only - 1|pg||
nt|jtr: If he gets the @s right he is only down one|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|othered1: But, as cards lie, I can't see any play with reasonable defense for 6N.  6@H would have been another story, but why should south assume north is off-shape?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: good news: @hQ was a stopper, bad news @Cs 4-0, good news @DQ drop!|pg||
nt|othered1: bottom line is it winds up being only a matter of overtricks|pg||
nt|tez: king of !k was right..if east has jtxx..you cant get all tricks..but west has jtxx..you can take dbl finesse|pg||
nt|pelu: still I prefer 5@c|pg||
nt|tez: king of @c|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: Ditto, 6@S.  |pg||
pc|h7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|pelu: only 4 @ds by opp now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: interesting. The margin at this point is 23 - if 6N makes, it goes up to 34 - if it goes down, it is 12|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And now confirmed as he did not overtake|pg||
nt|othered1: east took the sure beat.  Not ridiculous.|pg||
nt|pelu: 3!|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: I think this is a brilliant defence|pg||
nt|othered1: but west ensured the extra undertrick|pg||
nt|psridhar: a sensible stop in 2nt after tht light opening-shd make on the nose|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but no entree to the spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT as a one-round force has its advantages, but also disadvantages. 1NT sometimes the right contract|pg||
nt|baardolav: think it is one down with correct defence...|pg||
nt|psridhar: wd|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: he should get the spades right|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: spades will be found|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: I like 5@C, too -- shooting fish in a barrel isn't a bad strategy now and then.|pg||
nt|athene: east known to have at least 11 red cards|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|psridhar: that defense deserves 12 imps !|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tez: very unlucky for NS..h'S ARE 4/2..@C K OFFSÝDE|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: diamond to the ace and a club ruff, but then south is endplayed|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: 1NT is the catch-all response when you play 2/1 and don't have enough to force to game|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: this is much better|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: does anyone know if this tourament still takes place in the university?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: East knows that West could have overtaken the heart for a sure one down, so West must have a very good reaosn for leaving him on lead  |pg||
nt|tez: if he cash 6 times @c..it was cold|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos:  not sure ird very unlucky Spades are 3-3|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|psridhar: i dont see the 2nt making now|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|othered1: Agree this is unlucky, but I think, on the NS cards alone, it's third best slam|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mamos:  sorry it's very unlucky|pg||
pc|hA|nt|janhamhurg: no|pg||
nt|athene: the defence can't get two diamonds and two clubs as well|pg||
pc|h9|nt|tez: yes|pg||
nt|athene: maybe an initial club lead would have been better, but hard to find unless west specifically showed clubs|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 possible endings with the same result|pg||
pc|s6|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: it's funny how these off-shape 1NT openings never quite seem to work out|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s5|nt|tez: endplay|pg||
nt|psridhar: he had to start clubs w/o touching dia|pg||
nt|athene: duck the club here endplays west, but declarer could equally well just win the @CA, come to hand with the @S9 and play another diamond - east is known to be out of clubs|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: -100 is good, may be they win some|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s8|pc|dT|nt|janhamhurg: but north endplayed himself- just - 1|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what is an university:)?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: West has a raise to 6|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H possible here|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: because some years ago it was there and the beer was so cheep, that most players were drunck by the end of the play|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Should be a pretty straightforward 6@H to bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C vulnerable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do I know|pg||
nt|pelu: pass from West???|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|othered1: Plenty of time for EW to find @S fit.|pg||
nt|psridhar: as it happens S had both KQ of spds and was under squeeze-but if spd q was in N, then this test was the best option|pg||
nt|othered1: Perhaps east has extras in their style?  Preempts work against whomever has the balance of strength.  Here it's partner.|pg||
nt|tez: may be east has 2 small @d..not 2 small @s|pg||
nt|athene: the hands fit well, so even the bad trump break shouldn't cause too much of a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: And east did so directly|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tez: keep 6 card in S..Last 6 card..s has @skq @ha !atx|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: we are playing semiforcing 1nt but we cant bid pass to 1 nt:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|tez: give @h..its 9th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: She has tricks opposite a partner who opened at the 5-level vulnerable. If that is not enough for a raise I don't know what is|pg||
nt|othered1: do y ou push them into slam then save?  Not a position that wins over the long run|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: ace of @h lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She has 3 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pikus could kick himself now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: that explains it all Jan:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Making 6@H on these hands is pretty tricky. did south lead from a red queen?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: then it's not semi-forcing, it's forcing|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: another 1 down coming|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: any way there is a safty play|pg||
pc|c8|nt|tez: to 3 nt|pg||
nt|psridhar: S didnt know for certain tht decl had a 6th club |pg||
nt|tez: Ewa gave up easily|pg||
nt|athene: actually maybe it won't be completely trivial, as he gets forced in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you throw a diamond from dummy on a spade, and ruff the diamonds good|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sopot sport arena i hear- so good times are over|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: Cichocki will kick him first a kibitzer suggests|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi jaap|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent bridge|pg||
nt|othered1: This is a good enough vul game, even though it fails.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One would expect nothing less when we are in Poland|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|janhamhurg: small to 10|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer gains a tempo - it might have been better for north to split the honours|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he decided the only chance was that declarer would get careless and play the king|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Aren't we just taking about overtrick or not if he gets clubs right?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: exactly- splitting is giving up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @S10 falls|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: This is about as friendly a layout for NS as  you can imagine|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in one of his books Martin Hoffman speculated that Poland has, not the srongest national team, but probably the strongest 50 pairs, on a per country basis|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Zia once said: "No-one can spell their names, but they sure can play"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'm told there are 2 million bridge players in Poland - is that correct? It seems rather a lot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 20,000. Still a large number|pg||
nt|Walddk2: More than 20,000 surely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 20,000 registered players I'm told. May be more than that who play |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|othered1: Can @H plays beat it on an uppercut?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denmark has 250,000 with a population of 5.5 million. 25,000 in the DBF|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even if South doesn't find the club switch there aren't enough tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apparently you don't have to be a registered player to play at a club.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the Polish bridge magazine sells only 5000 copies a month|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe South is reading the magazine....|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: no, he is is thinking...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: :) it's so easy for us. We can see all the hands|pg||
nt|psridhar: hard to argue with a person of such linguistic skills as Roland :)|pg||
nt|tez: if you have KQ doubleton ..you must take with Q to lead|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: I mean, would any women say she is semi-pregnant? Either she is or she is not|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: interesting: the north south pair is signalling udca here, but was using standard count in spades the board before|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: or @C shift, as has been pointed out to  me|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: here the pass over 1 no was excellent-east didnt thk that south had all points|pg||
nt|tez: shuffling the cards:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am wondering what made it more attractive to bid 6@C over 5@H than after 5@C, but hard to argue with success|pg||
nt|pelu: remember the 3NT - 1, in CR S ducked the @s 2 times then @S8 to 10, and S played on @D - and west didnt see that his pd's !8 was the lowest @S and played @H back??|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: so 73.1-51|pg||
nt|tez: dream hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  big swing in the context of the match if 4@s beaten it would have been very close|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: see http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/soptq1t2-2.htm for running scores|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bridge isn't easy|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tez: very hard to bid 6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4NT?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: convert 5@C to 5@D to show diamonds and hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (which is what happened at the other table)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Nice to have 4N mean that and maybe it clearly should be a 2-suiter.  Depends on what double would mean here.  For me, it's clearly for takeout.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C is often 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|othered1: But he was making 3N anyway with the right @D guess|pg||
nt|othered1: on 18|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He had 5 losers, why is she upset?|pg||
nt|othered1: rather, on 200|pg||
nt|othered1: 20|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "Too strong" she said|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt losers: 2x@s, 1x@d + @CAK|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@H = spades after interference|pg||
nt|othered1: right :)|pg||
mb|2C!|an|w/o 4!H|nt|ritong: it does show two places to play for an immense majority|pg||
nt|othered1: Why was 5@C alerted?|pg||
nt|tez: 5@c pass or correct|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a great game, but on a good day it makes. Club lead will help|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: nice stop|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bridge is a very difficult game. No-one ever learns it to perfection, just ask Hamman. "Experts are bad, the rest even worse"|pg||
nt|athene: @SQ lead possible; east not likely to have much in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  wow|pg||
nt|athene: nice layout for spades here means you might come to five spades, @CK, @HAQ, and two diamonds|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mdgraham: gosh|pg||
nt|tez: now 5@h means @d and @h..|pg||
nt|tez: brave @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @SK to A, @HQ back - West had better convert this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or even @S10, as pointed out....  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: @HQ back is not so fanciful if 4NT is two-suited, but does need a certain amount of bottle|pg||
nt|mamos:  maybe hard for West to believe Hearts|pg||
nt|othered1: this goes down'on funny @S lead to urge @H shift.  Can they work it out?|pg||
nt|tez: west thking whats 6@d..2 suiter or not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: also West may be thinking that 4NT was meant as ace-asking - if 5@C shows one, then maybe 6@D is to play|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not a comfortable position|pg||
nt|othered1: Why would 5@C show one with no key suit?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, agreed, but you never know|pg||
nt|othered1: true, but that method would make 4N less safe, if ace-asking|pg||
nt|tez: i dont belive 4nt is asking aces|pg||
nt|ritong: no way|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West is taking an awfully long time here - I don't blame her|pg||
nt|othered1: Nor I.  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 6@D seems a gamble|pg||
nt|ritong: she is carressing grand|pg||
nt|othered1: But if they don't have a takeout bid over 4@S other than 4N, how do you handle a great hand?  OTOH, east could bid 6@D directly in that case.|pg||
nt|ritong: west has no doubt about the suits|pg||
nt|ritong: she has a doubt about the level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a lot of correspondence about East's sequence - I'm afraid I don't get it either. Sorry if I can't reply to all|pg||
nt|tez: probably just thinking about 6 or 7 hearts |pg||
nt|othered1: If no firm agreement here, as it looks like there isn't, I don't envy west his problem.|pg||
nt|mamos:  its hard not to fear a disaster|pg||
nt|othered1: Sorry her problem.|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: everybody left the table for a while|pg||
nt|ritong: one of the elements is, even if 7@h is cold, probably 7@s is cheap|pg||
nt|tez: what do you lead from west..2 of @s or q or t?|pg||
nt|ritong: @s Q|pg||
nt|tez: south sry|pg||
nt|othered1: Had east bid a simple, ultrasound 5@D over 5@C, this would have been over quite a while ago.|pg||
nt|tez: against to 6@d|pg||
nt|mdgraham: http://www.msc.com.pl/cezar/    here you can find all bridge players registered in Poland.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Increasingly popular to play transfer responses after intervention|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Some do it all the time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: after 1@C|pg||
nt|baardolav: Have done it for 15 years now...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Probably a heart|pg||
nt|tez: @h6 ithk|pg||
mb|2H!|an|3|nt|psridhar: i thought they dont raise on 3 cards that 2s !|pg||
nt|tomi2: the invit did not improve his contract but made club lead unlikely. how often has west qxxx and partner ax and you get a trick / tempo without giving this information|pg||
nt|tez: i m learning polish style leads:)|pg||
nt|tez: they lead 2/4|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, @H6 shows a holdings similar to a stright flush in poker :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: making 3- nothing terrible will happen here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: good decision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I believe the 6 could also be from 7643  or  76x|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trumps 4-0 should not cause problems|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: very reasonable|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done West|pg||
nt|ritong: 1) east has not cued @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: 2) maybe the par is 7@s doubled|pg||
nt|mdgraham: she took a long time there, and justifiably so |pg||
nt|mamos:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I wonder what she will think about her partners' bidding.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So they worked for you|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i wouldnt recomend a double with the north hand, but here in poland they can follow with a natural 2 clubs if necessary, since 1 club doesnt show clubs|pg||
nt|psridhar: a popular auction is 1nt-2d-2h all pass; the trf auction here has catapulted them into a perilious 3h..|pg||
nt|psridhar: Boss said prison if u do that :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 spade is fine|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tez: @d 7 is suit preferance..that means continue @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She can even afford to cash the ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: she already did:)|pg||
nt|ritong: a lot|pg||
nt|othered1: I must tend to some business.  Back next set.  Thanks,e veryone.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: when clubs come in|pg||
nt|othered1: you have to get all of them, but the opponents do have to lead . . . |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 dia now is nuts|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mamos:  she wont care  |pg||
nt|mamos:  just relieved|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now that she can see his hand |pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and 73.1-62|pg||
nt|tomi2: or H6x ot 76 or 86 or 96, but Olech will know bec. S did not bid 3@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2: prison is only in France. In Poland you get to prison if you lead high from a doubleton :)|pg||
nt|athene: now south knows his @CK is facing a singleton or void so he can't like prospects that much, however nice his spades are|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dimi: 4@c can be made if you drop K of @c|pg||
nt|psridhar: west had to bid 3h to invite -like in 1nt-2d-3h super accept|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and ns might make 3 clubs- so all fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No need to really if you play 1@H as a one-round force|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Usually with 3 hearts, but can be 4 with an invitational hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk they play 1h as 2/3 cards and 2h as 4 cards and 3h as 4 card invitnal|pg||
nt|psridhar: otherwise no expln for that 3h|pg||
nt|tez: All the good players will play xfer of the responder's suits in the future.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: it works well here since they always open 1 club...|pg||
nt|tez: ace of @c and q from skr..|pg||
nt|baardolav: the day will come that natural rebids will be alerted... And xferbids not...?|pg||
nt|psridhar: Gierulski is a deep thinker, takes time over it-we hv been seeing last 2 days|pg||
nt|tez: doesnt matter here but ..|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|tez: it means leading usually 6|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: sensible play, not rushing for the club ruff - south can't really jump in with the @HA and lead a trump|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tomi2: only danger for east 6 small cards was not possible this time because the 5 was in dummy, so the 2nd would be not the 6 in this case|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: well, if he does, declarer is happy anyway|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i saw only 1/3 of the final   Is it that EW outplayed NS over these 64 boards??|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: But North could have as few as 2 clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 IMPs to Mragowia|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tez: he will try j of @c i thk later.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: run the @C9 is possible now, even|pg||

pc|cK|nt|VugraphP1: she did|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in bidding you mean?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h5|pc|c8|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|athene: south would like to throw the @SJ so his trumps get promoted, but the problem is, that sets up dummy's spades as winners and he can just lead the @S9 and throw his losing club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last set of 12 boards to be played after a short(ish) break. They are on 10 in the closed room|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: *declarer can just lead the @S9, that is|pg||
nt|othered1: and play|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tez: nice play|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: They are playing rather skowly, so the final has been postponed. 13.30 instead of 13.00, in about 40 minutes|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 9 of spd costs a trick|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: first third was low scoring rest was for svindhal|pg||
