nt|hedyg: but that does not describe the S hand|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Did he ruff this?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Seems normal to pitch a heart and another on @C10|pg||
nt|psridhar: of course he needs to shorten his trumps-he knows h ace is right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ahhh, he did|pg||
pc|hT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|psridhar: he had to ruff to escape 500, now his trump length is a liability , i fancy 800|pg||

nt|Walddk2: On 20. North decided to pull|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here is a pretty straightforward 3NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: in a close decision between defending and declaring , many prefer the latter-the N in other room did|pg||
