nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|oleberg: Another hand, where a thrumph lead is the winner|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Peter Schaltz does not have much but he has enough for 4@H to make (2 trumps and a doubleton diamond)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thrumph lead will not help|pg||
nt|oleberg: 2@C can contain 20-21 bal, in which case 2@S is to play|pg||

nt|mcarroll: If he doese it can make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Nielsen's problem was that he had no suit to cue bid to show a sound raise|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|oleberg: I play that 1NT by East would have been a sound raise. I've never had the hand for it|pg||
