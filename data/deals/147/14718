mb|1N|mb|d|mb|p!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: Last board could be a huge swing|pg||
nt|peachy: Pass alerted, common style is that it requires Rdbl.  I don't know what this pair's agreements are though|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|othered1: Interesting, but also lets the defense work things out pretty quickly\|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: Right. Other common style with weak NT is to Rdbl as responder if weak hand, to begin runout immediately|pg||
nt|peachy: However, Dbl of Weak Nt is often played as penalty|pg||
nt|peachy: so defenders really dont have much to work out|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: I play lots of weak NT and, against knowledgable opponents, natural bidding over double works for me.  Initial redouble is penalty, later is rescue.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|sJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|peachy: I also play weak NT and whn do, Pass over Dbl wants opener to Rdbl.|pg||
nt|othered1: And it may be right to sit on all balanced hands opposite a double, but not all opponents see it that way and the more natural methods force a decision at once.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: E is endplayed and has to give away a trick -- still down 1 it seems|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|peachy: Meanwhile, declarer seems to get 6 tricks here. Initially, defenders had a chance for 2 down|pg||

nt|othered1: even knowing what declarer has in general, not all that easy for west to shift to @H, rather than @C early on.  I think that would have produced more.|pg||
