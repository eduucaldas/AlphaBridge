nt|hedyg: good hand for weak 2 suiter in N but usually in Poland that is 5 5...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda4.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt they can find the slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: NV they may skimp a little?|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: sorry, but we have some problems here|pg||
nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: wrong cards?|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: redeal to 19|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: we're closing, sorry|pg||
nt|hedyg: shame, this is a very interesting hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: try again :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Third time lucky I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Both pairs play Polish @C Marcin?|pg||
nt|baldjean: I was just about to post the same :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: obserwujemy mecz dwóch pierwszych druzyn w klasyfikacji - prowadzi Henclik przed Mr¹gowi¹|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am afraid EW might try 4@s here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have Polish commentary in the closed room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome back|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|baldjean: this will be a 4@s|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi again|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: one of the best known Polish Junior pairs, Piotr Wiankowski & Michal Nowosadzki, who had also represented their country in Jesolo|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: 4@S could be very wrong but you've got to bid it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this indeed really tough table, both sides established partnerships|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back|pg||
mb|3D|nt|h_karluk: yes sir, agreed|pg||
mb|3S|an|stoper !s, maybe 4!s|nt|h_karluk: Boguslaw PAZUR is a famous WIM in Poland, active in International field since 1994|pg||
nt|othered1: east's first pass looks normal, though some might double 2@H as takout of @S, wh ich prevents being boosted out of the auction if dummy is weak and opener superaccepts to 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jan Lammerich|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi, welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda9.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think this should stop the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the penultimate round of 6 boards today|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Irwin Boris|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: leading team meets third place|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Two strong pairs at this table|pg||
mb|d|nt|baldjean: I doubt West will bid 5@c in this vulnerability situation|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Piotr Gawrys and Piotr Tuszynski are big boys|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi Irwin|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Marek is an old gun, since 1978 active|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: the latest version!|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|othered1: and double of 2@H for takout of @S isn't all that dangerous, since it implies some @H length and partner can pass with a crumby hand and a few @H.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: since the 2 heart bid limits the hand to 10 points, west 3 hearts seem optimistic|pg||
nt|h_karluk: here is a Polish bridge joke : You know that an overcall of 3Sp over 1Sp means, partner, I have a solid minor, if you have a spade stopper, please bid 3NT. But do you know the ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Polish version of that convention?:) Partner, I have a spade stopper, if you have a solid minor, please bid 3NT. :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|baldjean: double was a bit keen, in my opinion, but it works|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: just eleven tricks there for NS pairs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: Double on this auction was far more dangerous.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|baldjean: interestingly the other table landed in 3@s only|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I agree with the final contrace and will use an inviting sequence as N instead of a direct 4@s|pg||
nt|baldjean: are there any problems, operator? or is West thinkin?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|othered1: and could have been hammered for 500, a large pick-up "out of thin air."|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: many will wonder about that 2 club bid|pg||
mc|11|nt|Walddk2: Shows 18+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C is ambiguous|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: since most play a 2 cl opener as 12-16, a rebid shows 17-19|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Often 12-14 balanced but when he bids again after pass from partner, he has the strong version|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am surprised to see Tuszynski there without Jacek Pszcola, but maybe he is still in neigbor state North Carolina USA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *neighbor|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Are these cards ok Hedy?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pepsi plays with Jassem in this event|pg||

mb|1H|nt|hedyg: i hope so!|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: yes, cards are ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@D puts pressure on S |pg||
nt|hedyg: double would work well here|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that does not describe the S hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't get it (CR result)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: slam NT for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5 IMPs but still significant in a 6-board match|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as far as i remember for 220|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: normally both minors 6-9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: gotcha, thanks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT = weak with both minors|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: That's what N wants to hear....|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: pass or 3NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/sopot/sopotteamrunda6.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C is a fine contract, even 7 has play|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ok i hear: 2club opener shows 11-14, so the 2 cl rebid shows 15+|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|baldjean: nice slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: everyday slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he likes to attend regionals in Georgia, Atlanta, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Polish Club    1@C   1. 12-14 balanced - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. Any 18+|pg||
nt|irwinbo: many fearless folk would have opened 3 diamonds if system allowed|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 no is limited to 18, since no 1 cl opener|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Matches of 6 boards in the qualifying|pg||
nt|othered1: south has an interesting rebid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i must admit i would pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: me too - South's hand likely to be unbalanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: in CR it was pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@S is on as it is, but they took the money|pg||

nt|hedyg: 9@H just became huge|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classic 5/3 or 4/4 case|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: I have just been told that there will be a longer break than scheduled. Restart at 16.30 local time|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: next session starts 16.30|pg||
nt|baldjean: And settled for the 4/4.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's true|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Best lead for the defence, but declarer can prevail with spades 3-2 (ace on side) and hearts 3-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a great game, but makeable|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: @CA, spade|pg||
nt|h_karluk: undo?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Pazur supposed to pass|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: knowing 4 spades make easily, 5 clubs might be a good idea, but it will dost a fortune here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the link is for NS pair|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Bye to East's hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: West will be endplayed at some stage for minimum 9 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 2@c|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: cost|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 500 not really much of a compensation|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not my cup of tea sir, besides i am a married man, if i would open it 3@d i would be a dead meat :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|h_karluk: thanks|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No other line seems attractive|pg||
nt|othered1: But NS have handled this well.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think the club suit disappeared|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, it did in the 50's I suppose|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far yes|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now not even 5 level is safe|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: no worries , its okay Marcin :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: Well, declarer does not agree|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: bec of 2 potential dia loser|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Hearts very friendly for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could go for a zillion if clubs had been 3-1 and hearts less friendly|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: only -2 ?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and a possible spade|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all :)|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: local time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has got to play a spade from dummy anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could have, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club to the king and a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he can't any more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think it well may be 1100|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there should be a good side to every situation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was an error not to cover the 8, but easier for us|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now the heart suit is dead, it is expensive|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but that's life, for every force, there is a counter force, for every negative there is a positive and for every action there is a reaction. In other words for every cause there is ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: an effect |pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: and if not then E will be endplayed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Shirley|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess would draw @d 10|pg||

nt|h_karluk: and pitch a @s|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: he can disc a @c now and play small @H|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: sorry, i missed the play. E played  A @D out of the order, and had to discard it to spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhh wow!|pg||

nt|h_karluk: @cK, @d ruff and enjoy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The defence did all the hard work for declarer|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|baldjean: 4 aces for North/South. almost sounds like the title of a Western :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nastepna sesja  zaczyna sie o 16:30   for our Polish viewers|pg||
nt|sybarra: will N get the ruff? |pg||
pc|sT|nt|othered1: Another auction where a trump lead looks pretty normal, and weste answered the call . . . |pg||

pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: *held|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Disappointing that clubs not were mentioned in either room|pg||

nt|h_karluk: ouch, sorry for  caps lock, my bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not sure what he would do if he got a 2@S response. Maybe 2NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless 2@C is Puppet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Gawrys also partner of Lesniewski |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: a 2 heart bid shows 11 +, 2 spade minimum|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: pass now would show "touch"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if you would like to see convention cards of Polish pros check this please : |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C is the best part score, but as usual clubs are lost|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://bridgefiles.net/VAR2/Vugraph/Vugraph-Poland.htm|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Cheap penalty card - only 1 or 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing much has changed here. Cichocki would also have bid if Henclik had passed 1NT|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: well judged|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: 6@c...:(|pg||
nt|hedyg: okok i am ambitious!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C can actually be defeated, but it takes a double dummy defence|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: :) - @S9 and @S10 makes the difference...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c opening is usually reserved to show a limited hand with long clubs and possibly 4-card major, similar to Precision 2@copening|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: E said: 4441 without @D or 5440 w/o @D|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so the polish handgenerator serves us a lot of highly interesting games-|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I suspect 1@H shows spades and that 4@H is a splinter for spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: rt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's pretty common to play transfer responses after a take-out double|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jutek: prawdopodobnie po wiscie kierowym 11 lew|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes old business|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: anf og course 4 spades denying any slam interest|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well can ruff and pull @s A|pg||
pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: Slawek HENCLIK was partner of Boguslaw GIERULSKI between 97-99|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sharkey: 6 NT as well|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so now he will make 5 easily|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: Hey Ed, good to see you|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6NT seems to make too without the @H lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|baldjean: 4@s is a bit too high|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NS did well to push EW one level higher|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: They would have done even better if Wejknis had led a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@d response  relay, forcing to 3@c. Opener shows a 4-card suit (3@d shows extras) or makes a choice between 2NT and 3@c with long clubs.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but we see, now he would be able to pitch 2nd @d loser to established @h K|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if they find it i won't get surprised|pg||
pc|dT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or at least 4 after this dia play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I will be, cos they are not in 3@C|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 spades is a nice contract doomed by the 5-1 split|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean you know they are card sharks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: Which I think is mandatory on this auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I suppose he can make this if he did not get a heart back|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: That is very impressive by Skrz!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he can't because he must play a spade honour when overruffed|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: agree, heart was nessesary to prevent a low spade from table|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: We had that theme before|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When Nowosadzki did|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|othered1: Preferably the high one, but that isn't easy to find|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: i am afraid i must go now :( ty all and enjoy!|pg||
pc|c9|nt|h_karluk: and low @s to A|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: People do not lead trumps often enough in my opinion|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes, ace and another|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree, especially on an auction where you know you have the balance of power|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some have never led one in their lives|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe thehy recognize it as passive defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: way eleven|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: exactly- a rare bird comes as a couple|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: But it is a very popular lead among the great Italian players|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: I guess Boguslaw would never stop his inventions, each year hard to reach it as a VG commentator remember him since 2007|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: 2@h/2@s response to 2@c not forcing, good 5-card suit (711 HCP)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: just ten, if he ducks the king of spades|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't believe|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: see- now makes|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: No, another heart|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North must come to 2 tricks|pg||

pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: On his way down now|pg||

nt|othered1: 2@C has a lot more going for it than 1@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "Whenever the auction calls for a trump lead, lead one, regardless of holding, even from Kx or Qxx"|pg||
mb|2D|nt|othered1: Two boards in a row with 1-level contract in one room and game bid in the other.  Price EW paid for the lightish opening 2@C|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Doubled part score contracts mostly|pg||
nt|othered1: Pretty much "Have a reason not to lead a trump."  And then double-check it.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: In general the Polish Club 2C opening shows 12-15 points and six or more clubs or five clubs, a four card major.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|othered1: South with no @C fit and a relative minimum puts the brakes on.|pg||

nt|h_karluk:  (Balanced hands in this range with five clubs, i.e. 2335, 3235 and 3325, are opened 1C.)|pg||

nt|othered1: Here, too, declarer likely will take his 9 tricks, but running @D may make play for an overtrick possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has the 10, or the 8 is a singleton|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: 1 NT 1517 HCP, 2@s response  transfer for clubs. Opener may choose between a positive 2NT, and a negative 3@c. Responder may continue by showing shortage.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mahy shoot the moon now|pg||

nt|h_karluk: *may|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Do you all play that convention?|pg||

nt|h_karluk: as passed hand i prefer 11 points for any action <including take out double>|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 8 of dia was count showing odd number(5)|pg||

pc|s4|nt|sharkey: Not sure 6@S makes...|pg||
nt|othered1: Lots and lots of cue-bids, but this isn't a very elegant contract.  Wonder if either North or South thought partner had a first round control, particularly the second @H bid by ...|pg||
nt|othered1: north (if 4@C was natural)|pg||
nt|ritong: for south, sounded like north had @h void, i guess|pg||

nt|h_karluk: and thanks all, esp Marcin, i know long day there for you :) another nice biz|pg||
pc|s9|nt|othered1: The @S bidding did give west an idea that partner had his cards elsewhere, which is a good thing|pg||
