nt|sybarra: I think possible at the club level |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||

nt|oleberg: Yeah, just ran a simulation at www.resultmerchant.com. Clearly 3nt is correct.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: You don't have to go that far, just ask GIB|pg||
nt|Walddk2: GIB always bids to the best spot, plays the contract perfectly and defends it briliantly too if "he" has to|pg||

nt|oleberg: - You have an ace|pg||

nt|jtr: Depending on how many reach 4@h on board 5|pg||
nt|oleberg: You have support for the other major|pg||
nt|milton_se: and too good def|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a lot to be said, even single dummy, for starting trumps on this hand by leading the jack from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgefestival.dk/Intro_Velkommen.aspx?ID=1138  for the festival website, in Danish only I'm afraid. Ask David Greenwood for a translation|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S will probably cover from H98x, and it also wins if N has stiff 8 or 9. |pg||
nt|jtr: Errrrmmmmm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it does have several losing cases of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzpj: EW are in 6th place at the moment|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it also is likely to winm, though, when S has H9x or H8x. If S could defend double-dummy i dont think the jack would be the percenmtage play, but in real life i think it is|pg||
nt|jtr: I would prefer to save my entries to dummy and lead low from hand|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If he does not, South must bid something legal|pg||
nt|vugraphzpj: I cant make that kind of bids !! :)|pg||
nt|jtr: And North must pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he bids 2NT, there is no penalty as such, unless 2NT is conventional|pg||
nt|jtr: So can he double?|pg||
nt|oleberg: hadn't seen the second 1NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: bbo program does not permit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he bids anything else, his partner must pass for the duration of this auction|pg||

nt|oleberg: South has two options in my opinion, 3NT or double everything|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i cant see 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he is permitted to double is he?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is MPs, 2N could be fine|pg||
nt|jtr: I would think it unfair if he can|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 2NT is surely conventional|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so could 2H, or even 2D. maybe the opps will back in with 2H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And then North must act accordingly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is not allowed to take advantage of the UI|pg||
nt|Walddk2: UI = Unauthorized Information|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what i meant was, he could bid 2H showing H and a minor, and if N bids 2S, bid 2n|pg||
nt|oleberg: He cannot double, just checked the rules|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i meant that a final contract of 2N could be fine, and he might get there if he bids 2R|pg||
