mb|p|nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D 1@H 2@C 3@D should end it i would think|pg||
mb|2C|nt|garnetts: should end up in 3@D  if South rebids 2@C |pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|athene: the defence have two spades, @CA, @DK - and they might get a second club if declarer plays trumps too enthusiastically and runs out of club ruffs in dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer shouldn't be leading trumps here|pg||

nt|garnetts: Rather than a spade |pg||

nt|nickf: doesnt matter for now.|pg||
nt|nickf: On Friday it wont say Team 1 - it will say TAS   or NSW etc|pg||
nt|nickf: tell me when you are back - I ahve worked out how to change the Team names|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHA3: im here|pg||
nt|nickf: click on F9 on your keyboard - then you can change any or all of the initial parameters you input|pg||
nt|nickf: but you only need to make the HOME team ACT and the Away team VIC|pg||
nt|nickf: well done :)|pg||
nt|nickf: but Fred warns me against using the F9 key - he thinks it is a bit unstable|pg||
nt|nickf: can change now if you have time (or wan to )|pg||

nt|athene: north might consider doubling for takeout on the second round, but 1nt rebid is strong, so she feels it's not worth sticking her head over the parapet|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, a fairly boring 4@S now|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am told there is |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2N|nt|athene: declarer looks short of entries for a trump coup so this should lose two spades and the @CA|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: might bid 2NT non vul lol not here though |pg||
nt|tez: what do your rebid..1 nt or 2@d with rankin's hand?|pg||
nt|athene: @DQ lead gives declarer a third diamond trick but two club pitches don't help her anyway|pg||
nt|tez: not now sure|pg||
nt|garnetts: west might just pass here|pg||
nt|athene: west contemplates her minor suits, but doesn't find one that she wants to bid at the 3-level, vulnerable|pg||
nt|garnetts: Double solves dec probelms for NS :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|garnetts: North should double now in my view|pg||
nt|athene: might be hard for NS to double this, with their 3-3 club split|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|garnetts: 3@S is not an option in my view --it can surely not be forcing |pg||
nt|garnetts: stiff heart, three trumps and vul opps--double is surely the right action --partner can pull if unsuitable |pg||
nt|athene: you might bid 1nt with east's hand, if you play that as showing the unbid suits|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 2nt looks a bit enthusiastic at these colours|pg||

nt|athene: so there was no harm in blocking the clubs |pg||
nt|athene: declarer could never have enough entries for a trump coup|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree playing for a two trick defeat |pg||
mb|1C|nt|garnetts: But that 2NT was to say the least very racy|pg||

nt|athene: awkward problem for east here - i think you double|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: dbl and 4@s and what?|pg||
nt|garnetts: well I wouldn't pass |pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: pass is not my choise|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|garnetts: west will double and east will pass --|pg||

nt|athene: sure, you are happy with a safe 500, even if there was an exciting 600/650 available in a black suit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: 6@C makes only on the @HA lead, i think?|pg||

nt|athene: sets up the @HK for a diamond pitch from west's hand|pg||
nt|tez: yes.only @h lead|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|garnetts: I think 6@C is one off because east has four diamonds --but it might be hard to avoid given a free run|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|nt|babs59: what do you think of passing 3H?|pg||
nt|nickf: 9 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|babs59: sure Nick, and 12 in clubs|pg||
nt|mamos:  East may fear double shows Spades but I think should just be values|pg||

nt|tez: 3@s now|pg||
nt|athene: you want a club honour to go for slam with south, i think|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S, then 4@C from north, now south might jump to 5@D if she isn't sure what is forcing|pg||
nt|athene: if she is confident 3@S forced to game she might just bid a quiet 4@D|pg||
mb|4D|nt|garnetts: I would be reasonably happy to bid a slam on the last hand because the @D position is quite hard to guage in any auction--and it only matters when North doesn't lead a heart--would ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: ok - no-one knows if *this* 4@D bid is forcing|pg||

nt|garnetts: Right to play clubs first and if they break --is it realistic to play @D to be 4-1?  |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: if she makes this she will certainly have done well|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: she has to pick the exact position before seeing the trump break|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|athene: and basically run the clubs through east to weaken her trumps|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|s6|pg||

nt|athene: you might play the clubs before drawing a second round of trumps - that can't really hurt because you need the clubs to come in anyway|pg||
nt|athene: but even if you did that, you still would draw trumps before trying to run the clubs|pg||

mb|4C|an|key card|mb|p|nt|babs59: however, I believe if you first lead the @DA then finesse the clubs, 5@D should make|pg||
nt|babs59: South's 2@s bid was just GF - either agreeing a minor or looking for 3NT|pg||
mb|4D|an|key card|mb|p|nt|babs59: board 8  the possible double game swing hand (though EW went -1 in 4H) was the swing, with NS making 4S|pg||
mb|5C|nt|babs59: well the response is DKC, but I wouldn't bank on South's 4D being that for sure on this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: so this hand is a potential big gain for NSW, if played correctly|pg||

nt|garnetts: What would South have bid over 4@H?  |pg||
nt|athene: 4@S :)|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps east didn't bid 4@H because that has a tendency to push opps into bidding 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: which she didn't want to do|pg||
pc|s3|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: but it was asking a lot for 3@H to shut them out|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room the multi-2@D auction gave NS a problem - i think south might bid 4@H over 3@H on that sequence|pg||

nt|nickf: need some system here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|nickf: now Kalmin will need to act over 4H|pg||
nt|babs59: though the 2D was not alerted, it was a multi 2 - showing a weak 2 in hearts or spades (maybe a strong 2NT option)|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: thus 2S says Pass if 2S, correct if you have hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|nickf: operator|pg||

mb|4H|nt|oliverc: I must confess, With the West hand I'd have been bidding 4@H rather than 3|pg||
