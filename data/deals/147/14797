nt|nickf: The NS ystem card can be found here: http://www.abf.com.au/events/anc/2010/systems/nswopen.pdf|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|royhughes: and diamonds split|pg||
nt|royhughes: Fuller has made a good duck of the club.|pg||
nt|royhughes: Declarer has to take a view now, whether the club king is right or the heart ace|pg||
nt|beauch:  btw the last time i played against the ew pair - they used to play a forcing pass system|pg||
nt|jstnstrk: they still do david|pg||
nt|nickf: if Peake assumes West has the @CK then East will almost certainly hold the @HA|pg||

mb|3N|nt|hawe45:  3 @D looks fine as did 3 @H E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3C a very questionable action in 2nd seat with a likely running suit, unless of course partner expects this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quiet hand to start with|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think a lot of folks would bid 3 @C  rightly or wrongly  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparentl every E at this table would:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6H also doubtful -- S has a lot of losers and reasonable defense, though not enough to be happy if opps go on to 6S as there may be freakish distribution|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: hi there; sorry, but they started early|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not so sure about 2@d though - but South sure bought a fit |pg||
pc|sT|nt|garnetts: The double of 2@D seems pointless to me--I would have bid 3@D and used to double to show a decent hand |pg||

nt|mdgraham: not best to try that at home, overcalling on Q9632 - partner will have a singleton and you will go for 1100   |pg||

nt|beauch:  yes  looks like he has 3 def tricks and pd might have some heart tricks|pg||
pc|hT|nt|royhughes: Fuller is asking for a diamond return with the suit preference 10 of hearts, I think|pg||
nt|royhughes: If Peake ruffs with the 10 or J, Allen scores 2 trumps with the 97|pg||
nt|beauch:  the other table went down in 3nt- so peake did well to end play east|pg||
nt|royhughes: unless maybe declarer can ruff himself down and achieve an endplay|pg||
nt|beauch:  yes looks like 1 or 2 down from here|pg||
nt|royhughes: If entries to dummy are required, Allen can keep declarer to 1 in clubs by ducking the queen or popping the king on a low one|pg||

pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: though a low diamond would probably beat 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: if he has time to pitch the @H |pg||
nt|marlowepi: six spades i mean of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an aggressive North might double 2@S, but here, vulnerable against not and with a passed partner - no thanks|pg||
nt|ady: needs to avoid losing 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|april7: S might reach here a @H contract going down without a @S lead losing 1@H 1@C and 2 @S tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If 2@c showed a genuine suit, 3@C by East makes life more difficult |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sunsamvar: 4@H is a decent contract|pg||
nt|april7: I meant a 4@H contract, but now S is safe|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: N/S playing a Polish Club|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: E/W playing a Strong Club|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|garnetts: Not in favour of this type of bidding --as mentioned previously I think this should show 5-4|pg||

pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: N loves those clubs in dummy, temporarily|pg||
nt|irwinbo: unblock|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ady: got that right    should just make|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: W rightly plays the king to get under N's skin....make him think for a while that the suit was guessed correctly|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: he may lead it back and he did|pg||
nt|april7: S should have bid 2 @H first round of bidding,but better this way,fortunately for her|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: right but even a few moments' anxiety can help contribute to an accumulated psychological toll later|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d7|pg||

nt|rodal f: A @C or a @H looser to come?|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: Debating tricks|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Because Brayshaw didn't say anything about pitching in misclaim,cannot pitch|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Debating between -1 and -2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Correct by the book but also common sence by the playing are inside that law.|pg||

nt|garnetts: This needs sorting in serious partnerships |pg||
nt|roswolf: the bidding may have helped though a spade lead is likely from east|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4nt should be an attempt to play there i think|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree Geoff--a spade seems obvious|pg||
nt|garnetts: three potential bids 4NT  5@C  5@D  |pg||
nt|garnetts: Not 4@H |pg||
nt|mdgraham: gosh, 3NT - who needs a heart stop?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|garnetts: Hadn't considered that |pg||
nt|roswolf: trying to be objective as possible i think 5@D was better|pg||
nt|roswolf: no and i think too aggressive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow, how did the defense miss its way?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, despite East having a heart stop, this can go a lot off |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: led ace and club,  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: West won't be pleased to see the ten from East.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: partners duty to provide the @H stop|pg||

pc|sA|nt|garnetts: North will be first happy then sad |pg||
nt|roswolf: but while there is hope|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't maen to be rude, but this bidding is crazy. How can West bid 3NT, which might be the right contract, with two small hearts? |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|garnetts: needcs the heart finesse to make now |pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: yes the heart finesse is perhaps all that is necessary|pg||
nt|garnetts: might play three rounds but no entry |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard for W to see how good his cards is at defence, BUT where is the 3rd @D at E?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 16 mins remaining|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: 3@S backfired - but very tough to find the club lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: strange example of a pre-empt doing exactly the opposite of what was intended|pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: Dummy is reading a magazine|pg||
nt|roswolf: the israelis seem to have fortune on their side|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe there is a case for west doubling --or for east to consider the implications of the 4@S bid--note west passed|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: Fabulous job by Paul|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: How else do you show 5-4?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  And with this dummy, the ZIA-rule is not for use (If they do√Ç¬¥nt cover, they do√Ç¬¥nt have it)|pg||
nt|ady: if 4@H makes then n/s have a decetnt save in spade or diamonds|pg||
nt|irwinbo: good stop  6 is not bad contract  spades 2-2 ospades 3-1 and the diamond finess works|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: this is a really poor contract as a result of the opening bid and also the rebid |pg||
nt|garnetts: I was just looking --and David Greenwood got there first---the @D finesse will squeeze South |pg||
nt|rodal f: Any idea at the % for 6@S Irwin? Often a good contract.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||

pc|sA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S 3-1 and @HJXX also enough.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|garnetts: same thing maybe but South can use a suit preference signal |pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe the 2@S |pg||
nt|vugraphzkm: S had the @s10 in hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: to suggest a club|pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am told that NS play normal lavinthal so the 10@S must have asked for a heart |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why 13-13 at one side - and 13-11 at the other in this match?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d6|nt|irwinbo: 40 percent for the 2-2 plus half of the 3-1's equal 25 per cent so it is about 65 per cent|pg||
