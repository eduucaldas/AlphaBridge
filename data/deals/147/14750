mb|2C|nt|h_karluk: I did not yet|pg||

nt|sybarra: Also  we thank Slwaek Lataia,  the organizer of this tourney.  Much appreciated by all BBO vugraph fans! |pg||
nt|othered1: How do you play 4N?  If control asking, why not immediately?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|sybarra: thx spec,  love the insight and comments |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: back in about 2 1/2 hours |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 3@c instead of 2nt resulted in 3nt on W and a @h lead from N - and down|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Exactly. Then 2@S was waste of time|pg||
pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: maybe tried to leave space for partner|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Indeed, half an hour later than scheduled on our vugraph page|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sharkey: Not sure 6@S makes...|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|othered1: The @S bidding did give west an idea that partner had his cards elsewhere, which is a good thing|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|baldjean: 1@h loser only|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sharkey: that was the end of the match - we'll be back shortly|pg||
nt|baldjean: yes, my mistake. apparently there is no wy to drop the @h|pg||
nt|baldjean: no way*|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 16.30 local time|pg||

nt|ralfwil: thanks all and bye for now|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match|pg||
mc|11|nt|Walddk2: We will shut down and return shortly after they have made the pairings for the next round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's Swiss format now, 1st against 2nd, 3rd vs 4th, and so on|pg||
nt|othered1: are replays allowed?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Teams can't meet any other team twice in Swiss|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They can if the format is Danish (Monrad)|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  A Monrad format pairs winners vs. winners and losers vs. losers. The better known name "Swiss" system  |pg||
nt|baldjean: That's like the difference between Swiss and Danish cheese.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: J.H. Monrad, a Danish engineer, devised the movement in 1928, but for the Chess Olympics|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It was adopted by bridge soon afterwards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Monrad is a variation of Swiss format, but the Swiss system has rather specific rules for pairings|pg||
nt|othered1: Out here in rural Pennsylvania (the state with the largest rural population), Swiss is exotic enough and I hadn't heard of Danish until recently on BBO.   It's just Swiss with ...|pg||
nt|othered1: replays allowed (especially on the last round.)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another way of putting it, yes, but Monrad came first|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ie qualifier -- Results from a number of monrad rounds determine qualifier placement in the next phase, usually a cup format (either knockout or with consolation).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Danish is this context is not a pastry|pg||
nt|VugraphP1: it was the last deal of this round. We will continue in a few minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think the Americans use Danish for all of it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sometimes the final is progressive, meaning that losers will also "devance" to consolation.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operators need to reload and will shut down|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Americans mostly like k/o teams in Regionals, in Sectionals they like Swiss teams -- but in general both in the flyer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: zip k/o "loose and snooze" format another fun of Regionals:)|pg||
