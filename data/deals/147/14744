nt|Walddk4: Correct I am told|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||

nt|Walddk4: How do you invite game when hearts are trumps? Double as a general try?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|psridhar: i guess the concept of X to sub the 'stolen bid' is gaining popularity|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Yes, I agree that 3@H should be nothing more than competitive|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: and 3@S here if Tosh had bid it|pg||
nt|psridhar: with lack of entries to tbl, declarer might hv finessed H and relied on E to hold Kx/Qx in club so that suit can be played from hand |pg||
