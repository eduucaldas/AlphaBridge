mb|3S!|nt|athene: welcome back everyone|pg||
mb|d|nt|jtr: Start with a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north has a huge hand for a Precision 1@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Tough to bid though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: They have put together some massive sets over the years - I remember a 76-0 demolition in one of the Venice Cup matches|pg||
nt|athene: south will be thinking of 6@H now|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: so is North, by the look of it|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: hi Peter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@H may well be doubled for a spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the normal way to show a void in response to RKCB was to bid 5NT with an even number of keycards|pg||
nt|jtr: Not so tough for these ladies it seems|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Strong Club|pg||
nt|petergill: hence 3@H, since 1@H was 11-15|pg||
nt|athene: i thought 6@D would show a diamond void and an ODD number of keycards|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which will not, unfortunately, do any good |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|athene: well, i am sure they know what they are doing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I'd have doubled for a spade lead, and would be -1210|pg||
nt|athene: even without a spade fit, north has the most she can possibly have for 1@H, so as soon as her partner shows any slam interest, she is going there|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid, 4NT RKCB, 6@D two key cards plus @D void. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: the @CQ is a bonus|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: 6@d = @d void with 2 or 3 keycards.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: thirteen tricks now if she wants them|pg||
nt|jtr: 2 OR 3 seems odd|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that seems a bit silly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doesn't seem a bit silly - seems totally unplayable|pg||
nt|athene: you might easily be missing a grand slam with south showing 2 or 3 keycards|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: i think so too, but that's what explained.|pg||
nt|petergill: Without @CQ in her side suit (source of tricks), South would not have encouraged a slam - she would have bid 4@h instead of 4@D. |pg||
nt|athene: if you are ever going to have ambiguous responses they have to be widely differentiated so partner knows what you have|pg||
nt|athene: hence 0 or 3 keycards, 1 or 4|pg||
nt|jtr: Sensible lead in a way|pg||
nt|jtr: East knows South is likely to have only 2 or 3 trumps and the ruff may be important|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if there was any significance in west's failure to double diamond bids|pg||
nt|athene: forcing dummy might well be right to prevent the establishment of a black suit|pg||
nt|jtr: South responded 2@c next door and they were much better placed|pg||
nt|athene: i try to persuade my partners not to lead trumps against small slams|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: the only excuse for so doing is it's right :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|petergill: Both teams of six not surprisingly have their top four players in action for this vital last 16 boards of the grand final|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jtr: Concerned about 4-1 @cs|pg||
nt|jtr: and 3-1@hs|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jtr: yes i thought she might do that|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|jtr: Leaves options open and may be important for a squeeze|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: you have to choose your overcalls with care - best to make them when partner has 5-card support |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: ref page 22 of http://www.worldbridge.org/publications/WBNews/WBFNews09.pdf |pg||
mb|4D!|nt|athene: west had a choice of cue-bids here to show diamond support - 2@H or 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: some people would always cue in the suit they hold strength|pg||
nt|athene: (so @SA means 2@S)|pg||
nt|athene: but another consideration is that you want to make the cue which can't be natural|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. west can't have a great hand with spades (no 1@S overcall)|pg||
nt|athene: but she MIGHT have a great hand with hearts|pg||
nt|athene: probably showing hearts naturally isn't an issue so much over a 5-card major|pg||
