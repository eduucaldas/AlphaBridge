mc|11|nt|ahollan1: wow - that was 8th and last board of the set|pg||

nt|ahollan1: WARNING: names of players in 2nd set may not appear correctly in browser - or table listing :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we'll have 8 boards right away, a break and then 16 more boards in 2-8 board heats|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winner of the 3-way [aka triangle] will meet Netherlands in the final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: The undefeated Netherlands will begin with 6.5 imp carryover - but if they lose, will be the only team that doesn't get to try again|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it may be a while becuase 1 tabel have a few boards to play|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry -- i mentioned Brogeland-Lindqvist before, but they're on Bridge i Norge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we'll get Nystrom Bertheau|pg||
nt|ahollan1: The undefeated Netherlands team gets to sit out tonight - only 3 teams playing now for the right to play for the Cup - and $$$|pg||
nt|xenya: i find this format quite intersesting -- we can instantly compare different partnership styles|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but the 2 losers from this 3-way match play again tomorrow in playoff for 3rd/4th prize money|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes Vladimir - but commenting also gets skewed because we've already seen the hands :(|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: ok the last table is on their last board|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so 10 5-7 mins away|pg||
nt|xenya: true, Al, but i think these 8 boards are quite interseting in respect to players' style|pg||
