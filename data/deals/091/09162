nt|vugrapha1: the team with 2 wins goes through to the final or if all three teams have one win it goes to VPs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I assume normally, it's a wet Bath ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|d!|an|4 or 5 !S|nt|chessmaste: Or an early bath|pg||
nt|xenya: but, of course, there are the other 8 boards, of which we know nothing|pg||
mb|2D!|an|good !H raise|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=2+ 11-15  [EW play a form of Precision]|pg||
mb|d!|an|3!S|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: the final 8|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 1 of 3 teams will meet the undefeated Netherlands team for all the glory and cash|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the other 2 playoff for 3rd/4th prize money|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: Brogeland-Lindqvuist will show us many transfers and relays|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I can hardly wait|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: buckle up bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Much more sedate than the first time round|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: NEWS FLASH -- Meckwell stay lower than opponents|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: So far they have got to a hopeless 4@H without a single transfer or relay.  Maybe that was the problem|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: 2@D was transfer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W. who need imps in a hurry, are unlikely to hold back.  Hence the double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok, it shows good raise -- but partner did bid 2@H :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well MAYBE it was a transfer Al, or maybe it was a cue-bid.   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that still isn't as big a headliner as Italy-Lavazza fails to qualify for KO|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Might this go 2 down on trump plays?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if trump played -- lose @D trick -- if @D played - setup @D for declarer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What about 3 rounds of trumps?  Does not declarer then lose 3 diamonds?|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H is ill-advised i think, S's 3@H being no more than a competitive bid... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh --- small trump LEAD|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like N has sold his hand twice -- at least|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe with the big lead, Espen trying to duplicate Meckwell bidding all games?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Could be.  His values did look "prime"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There just weren't enough of them|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: back to -2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Thanks Curtis - we tested my theory about the trump switch.  |pg||
nt|xenya: this is one of the 2 boards for Norway from the previous "set"|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 bad boards*|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's still unclear to me how declarer can go one down after that switch.  But GIB has a way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Boye didn't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think using @S ruff to get to @C -- down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Eric's line showing that 9 tricks were available|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: maybe @H6 better than @H9  for 4th round of @C|pg||
mc|8|nt|chessmaste: I think I see it - declarer must use the club entries to ruff spades - and possibly has to ruff a winning club - then he can make all his trumps for one down|pg||

mb|1H|nt|hedyg: i think our operator is Krisztina|pg||
nt|cicus: szia Hedy, hello Vladimir|pg||
nt|pelu: X or bid 3@h?|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: variable NT in NS|pg||
mb|2D|an|decent !H support|mb|p|nt|cicus: X may not be penalties anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H -- letting NS off the hook|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Against the odds to make a move with the East cards in my opinion|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzkc: Guedes won the round robin and on yesterday 16-14 |pg||
nt|santyclz: An ugly 1nt with @cqj tight and no spots.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: if pd X 1NT - then X by u sh be penalty|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hedyg: would be a bloodbath|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Gad Chadha from England|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|cicus: I have a different agreement with my regular partner|pg||
nt|athene: not sure what east is planning to do if west unsportingly bids 2@D or 2@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|viren169: Hi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and William FRisby, also from England|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: think 2@d 1 @c and 1 @h for 1 down|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he has a way to sign off in 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Soucasaux is unstoppable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if that were  puppet.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: well even if penalty, it's not exactly clear-cut|pg||
nt|pelu: so we can bid free against u?|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol Peter|pg||
nt|cicus: no, we reopen with a X|pg||
nt|cicus: bid your shortest suit and you are saved|pg||
nt|pelu: u are forced to X gain? - then S can bid 2@S on a big hand!|pg||
nt|hedyg: if NT is 12-14 N must have A@c and K@H|pg||
nt|cicus: no we are not in a forcing situation after 1NT X|pg||
nt|cicus: rule is: don't pass if we may have game|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim 10?|pg||
nt|pelu: but then West has to take some action - he cant just wait and "hope" that pd we X again|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: not a hand for the next encyclopedia Mark|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H!|an|NF|nt|chessmaste: It could go into the section on overbidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good pinochle meld gets Grue to open|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Speaking of overbidding - "state of the match" opening by Grue?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|bjacobs: I mean, it's all very well to like queens, but there are limits|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: no - typical Grue|pg||
nt|bjacobs: ok - first I've seen him|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This table has a penchant for hopeless 4@H contracts it seems|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: grue says i have a good poker hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|chessmaste: If you play Precision style you quickly become addicted to opening 1@D at every opportunity|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: "4 aces, partner?" asks Cheek, hopefully|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CK lead lets it make -- but Lindqvist not onto the joke|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sweden leading Norway by 7,  US leading Sweden by 11, Norway leading US by 20|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A testing contract. |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: if all matches ended now -- tiebreaker of Total VPs determines the finalist|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Probably one down, but there are ways the defenders can go wrong - as always|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: Joe opened everything with his Junior partners too -- without the safety valve|pg||
nt|xenya: right|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: that is close to what we do|pg||
nt|hedyg: as takeout of course|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT wouldn't be all that unreasonable with east but 1@D is ok|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Terrible 6@d with 1 redeaming feature: it can make|pg||
nt|athene: west will just bid 3nt i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good morning from Vancouver|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Hi|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|viren169: then I am a simple soul!|pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't bother looking for a 5-3 major fit with that west hand|pg||
nt|athene: N-S are likely to power into 4@H here|pg||
nt|santyclz: N's @ss are more valuable on offense than he anticipates.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4333 and plenty of hcp|pg||
nt|athene: well, there are ways 4@H might make|pg||
mb|2D!|an|4!H 8-11hcp|nt|athene: after @SA lead, though, west can see the necessity of a fast diamond switch|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|pelu: when u X before the suit: X is values - when u X after the suit more penalty|pg||
mb|3S|nt|viren169: I agree|pg||
nt|athene: even if you find partner with a 5-card major there's no guarantee it will be better than 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3 @c asks for majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3nt No 5 card no 4 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 2@D=any game force|pg||
nt|viren169: although if pd has 5233 shape 4@S may be better...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i don't see much downside to 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@D = 2-3-5-3 - no 3 card @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now @DA and @D10 should fall out of his hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: declarer will surely play the clubs the right way, to protect the @SQx|pg||
nt|athene: lead @CA then @CJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: He will protect the @s Q so will guess @c|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|cicus: one way of two-way checkback|pg||
nt|xenya: may be an exact tie after this board|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|hedyg: easy @c lead and 10 tricks or will he shift to @H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would 2NT be 3343, Peter?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|viren169: nice play|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cicus: not now, S encouraged clubs|pg||
nt|athene: now @DK then diamond to the ace|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: just in case south has a singleton @DJ/@D10|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: three discards are no use; the club finesse can't be avoided|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pelu: no - 2Nt is also 2-3-5-3 - but a bad @D-suit|pg||
nt|athene: then the layout is revealed and you can take the finesse|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: Depends on agreement|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|hedyg: what about 2 3 4 4 ?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|s2|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: You open 1@C'|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s9|nt|pelu: for sure: with 3 card @S u bid 2@S - so 2NT = 2-3 i major|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|xenya: a normal 2@S -- perhaps he can come to 10 tricks here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: a sound opening bid -- is that allowed at this table?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Lindqvist plays the odds.  The previous heart contracts didn't make - why should this?|pg||

pc|cT|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|viren169: nice competitive hand now|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C P 1@H now east should bid 2@D i think|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cicus: 14 board match is starting|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: when it comes to overcalling, a good suit compensates for anything|pg||
nt|viren169: or 3@D... not for the faint-hearted!|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|santyclz: X or 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: of course if north just bids 3nt that might shut east out :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: No chance...|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S looks normal to me|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: if you are 2-3-4-4  you open 1@C and rebid 3@D over 2@D to show that shape|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1@C - then u bid 3@D on 2-3-4-4, and 2NT on 2-3-3-5 and bad suit, 3@C on an good suit|pg||
nt|viren169: North saw it coming!|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT Jordan, showing a sound raise to 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sensible bid from west|pg||
nt|athene: with 5-loser hand|pg||
nt|athene: nothing to the play:- one trick to lose in each major|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how anyone can be considering doing anything over 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the thing about bashing 3nt in here is, you don't especially want to shut out east from mentioning a long suit|pg||
nt|athene: because he is on lead anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: small diamond|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzkc: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Sry for the delay (connection problems)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: this is the north final championship, final 4 3 matches 20 boards each|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|hedyg: so cannot differentiate between 2 3 4 4 and 2 2 4 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2245 is not a balanced hand|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@C then 3@D looks 2245 to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's semi-balanced|pg||
nt|pelu: no I dont like to open 1NT with 2-2 i major|pg||
nt|hedyg: you would not bid 1NT after 1@C-1@s?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: interesting that both north players doubled|pg||
nt|santyclz: N could be considering a x on the empirical unlikelihood of 1 side making 11 tricks on any given hand.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: yes, small diamond was definitely preferable with no entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: agree not the best lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a different auction perhaps top diamond correct|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here next to zero chance north has only 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: true, 11 tricks is a lot|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: 3nt shows a very balanced hand for most people so East knows it's overwhelmingly unlikely N-S have 2-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: now declarer can succeed by playing on hearts.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: declarer is likely to put east with a top heart though|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: since otherwise why not a small diamond lead? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: think he will play for @c...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: so he might decide to pin his hopes on the clubs behaving|pg||
nt|viren169: normal to play on clubs and d1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: yes - and have to tell "a story" after 2@D - but no system get 100%|pg||
nt|cicus: @D6 was Smith - don't like clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: N considering a @S switch?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt like any switch|pg||
nt|xenya: which might save a trick if S has AK|pg||
nt|xenya: as it is, it gives an overtrick it seems |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't hurt to cash some spades and see what they do|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: impossible to tell that S has 8@D which would maybe ask for @S and 6 asked for @H|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: In case of a tie, they will play 2 extra boards, and then 2 again if  ....   until one team has won|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This is the sort of slammy hand E/W need|pg||

mb|4S!|an|RKCB|nt|xenya: Grue bid 4@D at this point|pg||
nt|xenya: as E i mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: The play in hearts might be interesting|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No hawkeye the camera in the cricket and tennis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D non-serious?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a fine slam, and I think it should make.  (Hey, I'm not even using GIB)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Tom Grue says 4@D=Redwood|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Redwood the tree?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ace ask in @H|pg||

nt|xenya: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C!|an|!SK no !CK|nt|bjacobs: It's their carry-over head-to-head.  So it's a critical score|pg||
mb|p|mb|7H|nt|ahollan1: we'll see this group play 8 boards then their teammates will come to table for next 8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because the winner is determined, firstly, on win-loss|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: it's neither of those|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: it's the score from the 1st half of this match that finished about an hour ago|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Right ... their carry over head-to-head|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 7@H is not a fine slam, I'm sure GIB will tell us|pg||
nt|xenya: now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@C asking for 3rd round control?|pg||
nt|xenya: isn't W worth 7?|pg||
nt|cicus: unless this get passed they'll bid 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: How about a spade lead now?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: duh -- this is 2nd set of 8 boards for the match|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh for the heart jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but we won't see any changes until teammates come to table to play these 8 boards|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't see how that follows|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||

nt|chessmaste: As in divorce|pg||
mc|12|nt|ahollan1: well - the big money,   playoff for 3rd/4th isn't chump change|pg||

nt|cicus: chance for a swing hewre|pg||
nt|viren169: slam hand... off to the races here|pg||
nt|athene: north hand is hard to express in most systems|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: but when a side actually bids 5 of something that might change the a priori odds somewhat|pg||
nt|athene: however little respect you have for their bidding|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: both ways perhaps|pg||
nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: too good for weak 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: 2@S might show a weak 2-suiter but this might lose the important sixth spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 2 @s is @s and a minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well that simplifies things, matos will ace ask|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure S with still push to the 5 level...|pg||
nt|viren169: great...|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't have a bid, really|pg||
nt|athene: so he will choose between double and 1@S i guess :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps MacskÃ¡sy could have bid 5@H en route rather than punt 6@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW bidding @Hs helps S|pg||
nt|cicus: after 2@H here @CQ is a favourite to score|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It did not in the CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: careful pass by W|pg||
nt|xenya: but you don't really bid grand missing the trump Q?|pg||
nt|cicus: no but if the auction is crowded you can't pay attentiom to nuances|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Vladimir, but N could have had it but with no chance to raise when partner jumps to 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS not a regular partnership, is 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|xenya: true, Roland|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S is forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: without agreements 2@S is surely forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a method for showing this hand after 2@S opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|pelu: diff bid in N - has to bid 3@C - but pd will take is as a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need an agreement if it's not|pg||
nt|viren169: now 6 will be easy when (if) diamonds is found as second suit|pg||
nt|athene: now south has to do something|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south assumes he is facing only five spades, so will probably ask for the @SQ |pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like S is just going to bash it out...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes 4nt aces for @s and 5 @h asks @s Q|pg||
nt|santyclz: Make a @s a @h and he has a textbook Bramley x.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pelu: 3@H by S|pg||
nt|hedyg: time to cuebid|pg||
nt|hedyg: prefer 3@H|pg||
nt|cicus: is this not risky?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C won't lead anywhere|pg||
nt|cicus: I mean 4@C|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure 3@H agrees clubs|pg||
nt|cicus: Szalay will convert to 4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c normally orkc...|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@D from N (reverse) sh promise 1 bid more|pg||
nt|athene: does that get him into a Bramley Jam?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|hedyg: but in this sequence..|pg||
nt|cicus: ORKC idf forcing...|pg||
nt|xenya: hope they know what they are doing...|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S reached in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with the @SQ and nothing else, north would just bid 6@S, so 6@H shows extras|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|pelu: a jump to 6@C (in my system) = 2 Aces plus a void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know what ORKC is, but you had better explain. Many in the audience don't know I'm sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: orkc= option roman keycard|pg||
nt|cicus: Optional Roman Key.Card asking for aces|pg||
nt|cicus: optional, because it also asks about strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT....|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1st step agrees to slam, if other bid than 1st step then dont want slam but show number of keycards|pg||
nt|cicus: 1st step usually weak hand and other responses show aces|pg||
nt|pelu: on 4Nt I jump in the void-suit if lover that trumfp - and jump to 6 in your suit if higher|pg||
nt|viren169: whay 6@H and not 6@C?|pg||
nt|athene: but south, not being able to see all the hands and knowing there's a keycard missing, has no grand slam ambitions|pg||
nt|athene: south can't have been happy about passing throughout|pg||
nt|athene: but he didn't have any convenient bid|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps north is worried that 6@C might be taken as his second suit|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: i would probably risk 3@D over 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: Sousa Guedes won the round Robein|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Robin|pg||
mb|6C|nt|cicus: maybe Hedy's version is more popular|pg||
nt|athene: showing extra length/strength there|pg||
nt|viren169: North passed at the other table, and drove to slame via RKCB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps 6 of a minor would offer a choice of slams|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: time to claim|pg||
mb|6H|nt|vugraphzkc: they all play pretty natural in this room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I don't think many play it|pg||

pc|s4|nt|vugraphzkc: Ribeiro is a "new team" on these finals|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: but usually without special agreement, if you pass over a suit then later double, partner is going to assume it's penalties|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: i would certainly bid 2@S with west's hand over 1@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nobody seems to assume x's are penalty any more.|pg||

nt|xenya: 4@H problematic here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Budapest a great city. Buda on one side, Pest on the other side of the river Donau|pg||
nt|cicus: or vice versa|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt keeps things simple|pg||
nt|athene: south has a stopper in the unbid suit|pg||
nt|athene: but it's one of the BID suits which will be the problem|pg||
mb|2N!|an|relay|nt|vugraphzkc: and now what?|pg||

nt|santyclz: Or else a great vul vs not psyche.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@SX in CR, E overcalled...2@s|pg||
nt|athene: when you have one suit with an ace and one without, it's normal to lead the non-ace suit, but it's also normal to prefer a 5-card suit, so east had a close decision there i think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond shift now|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... I would have lead a @S... |pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: key question -- would NS have bid 6@D?|pg||

mb|5C|nt|cicus: Szalay trying to slow down the bidding biut can't|pg||
nt|santyclz: Did you consider the reverse even borderline with that honor structure?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: it wasn't completely bonkers|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I think it was natural|pg||
nt|xenya: has to bid 5@H now|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D was natural|pg||
nt|hedyg: showing 10+|pg||
nt|xenya: danger now|pg||
nt|cicus: S has a good hand but worthless 5 points in spades|pg||
nt|pelu: need a @C-lead to defeat 5@H - impossible to find|pg||
nt|cicus: so shouldn't be tempted|pg||
nt|xenya: didn't N show something stronger than he has?|pg||
nt|hedyg: well...beauty is in the eye of the beholder|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has a great hand on pds 1@h opening|pg||
nt|xenya: sure -- but not too many high cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: points shmoints|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree that he is too good for 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: This shouldn't be very eventful and the lead of either long suit can cost a trick|pg||
nt|mmmakela: small S? or dias?|pg||
nt|othered1: if dec larer can read the position|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh well.  Was expecting a low @s from n, low @d from dmy and a test on how smoothly n could duck.|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I prefer 3@H here|pg||
nt|viren169: by West|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C seems better than that delayed double|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: can S count on the @HA, for example?|pg||
nt|pelu: Is S looking for 2Aces or 1S-void by pd?|pg||
nt|athene: the key to the hand is the club void facing no strength |pg||
nt|viren169: all too late she cried!|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: well they got it there in a different way|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: you can never count on an ace|pg||
nt|cicus: a club lead was required to set this|pg||
nt|pelu: S has to play @S in trick 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't bother with 3@H|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: it would have been raised to 4, i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: silva is not happy with previous board|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H would make, i suppose, if declarer picked things right|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@SX in CR|pg||
nt|viren169: I'm sure E/W are not on solid ground... but they landed on their feet!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: no wasted points in @c....|pg||
nt|athene: given time, declarer can set up the long spade for a diamond pitch|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|athene: but he won't get time|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|pelu: best now is @HA and @H 2, but a ruffing finess in @C will bring 5@H home|pg||
nt|pelu: will or can :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: when after A@H and @H ruff he starts xruffing and W shows out on @D the srop of K@C will be clear|pg||
nt|hedyg: drop even|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzkc: re|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d2|nt|viren169: all routes lead to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: south won't imagine that declarer has only @CAxx|pg||
nt|santyclz: He would have 10 tricks, but ...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: 4@H would be interesting - the trick is to draw trumps and keep control of clubs|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c3|pc|d7|nt|athene: i'm not sure if it would make in practice on a club lead|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|viren169: ...and...|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c7|pg||

nt|athene: diamond guess to make 6@S here|pg||

nt|viren169: better than a guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 1@H-1NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if Szalay passes|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H 1@S 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: now west might just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: with 7 running tricks|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cicus: I guess a discussion is taking place right now|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: N/S might be in trouble here|pg||
nt|santyclz: The usual Ghestem result.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|santyclz: Pass before the x'ing starts.|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, EW have some points and fit, but not much anything makes, not even stop on a dime 2@H in open room|pg||
nt|athene: the auction is likely to start 1@C 1@S (2@H) X support and north can conceal the diamond side-suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: E does not want to pass nor does he want to encourage, goes the middle road|pg||
nt|pelu: why 1NT????? - do they play 1@S/1NT reversed?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s was an option as well?|pg||
nt|pelu: the middle road ? 1Nt = no road :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, they play 1NT f1 and he doesnt want to show @s, just a weak @H fit|pg||
nt|xenya: i would have seriously considered a pass as E|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6 losers, 2@d is enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: x means 3 @s support|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps exclusion now|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|athene: facing two non-heart keycards you are happy to have a shot at 7@S|pg||
nt|athene: exclusion keycard is usually a jump to something above 4nt|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting lead coming up for East...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: here, N-S have the room to employ it at a lower level - IF they have agree this sort of thing|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: *agreed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H splinter for me, but can continue with 5@H void|pg||
nt|athene: this is interesting|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: north wins @SK and switches to a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: east has to duck but now south can switch back to a club|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: playing artificial reverses?|pg||
nt|othered1: this can be a very large swing 12 imps or more.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: seems good lead by W (for them...)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cicus: 2@S prpbably game forcing without spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: i don't think this auction is really getting to grips with the hand|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we know what 4@S showed?|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence come to diamond, 2 clubs, and 2 spades|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S must be artificial game force?|pg||
nt|cicus: not sure about that|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cicus: one of my advisors says it is 17-18 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was just natural i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S was signoff, i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: he assumed 4@H was a splinter, either singleton or void|pg||
nt|viren169: I think N is living dangerously!|pg||

nt|bjacobs: but the failed grand is a killer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it will be interesting to see how they replay with Meckwell NS and whichever Bridge i Norge pair is on the way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the real killer -- if replay doesn't get to 6|pg||
nt|xenya: oh they will i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think so too |pg||
nt|xenya: there's even a chance they'll bid to 7 too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with that type of early result -- have any of you ever started the comparison with teammates with the LAST board?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 29 imp lead -- bidding 7 without being able to count 14 tricks -- nah|pg||
nt|xenya: a very slight chance, admittedly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@HX -300 won't help the Hampson cause either|pg||
nt|xenya: well NS can make a game on that hand -- in theory|pg||
nt|xenya: but on the whole, yes, i doubt EW's performance has been good enough to win backs 30 imps|pg||

nt|athene: north might double 2@S|pg||
nt|viren169: it may have taken a bit longer in the play without the 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's the least unappealing option :)|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer 3@D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|viren169: better to pass...|pg||
nt|athene: we saw he doubled 2@H on the 6430 earlier|pg||
nt|athene: after 1nt pass 2@D pass 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think it's close between pass, double and 3@D|pg||
mb|1N|nt|viren169: depends on style and partnership trust...|pg||
nt|athene: if you are ever going to open a weak-2 with a 7-card suit, that north hand is when you should do it, i think|pg||
nt|athene: an empty suit but an ace, so you have some defence|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|athene: east can't really have slam interest can he?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: how did they get to 2@S in CR? -- oh N just bid it|pg||
