pc|cT|nt|royhughes: Campanile had extra high-card strength and went to game|pg||
nt|royhughes: but the South hand is not powerful and it may be difficult to take 10 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: very lucky @D position|pg||
nt|henryb: I think she has to guess both pointed suits (@s &@d) to make this|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes -- you mean all the low diamonds in west|pg||
nt|othered1: But it's not impossible to do both on the auction|pg||
nt|royhughes: Maybe declarer can take 3 rounds of trumps and eventually a ruffing finesse in diamonds|pg||
nt|royhughes: which is I think what you meant, but it took me longer to see|pg||
nt|royhughes: I wonder if Hampson took some time over 2@s|pg||
nt|henryb: I suspect, however, that she will play for @s 2-2 sicne that makes the hand simple|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: still ok if she gets everything right|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think 2 rounds of clubs beats it|pg||
nt|henryb: no. the third club uppercuts a trump trick|pg||
nt|royhughes: declarer could ruff with the 10 and still pick up trumps but he is short an entry to dummy|pg||

nt|royhughes: It's complicated -- I just don't see how to make after another club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It can't on a club continuation|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: rodwell is still thinking though|pg||
nt|henryb: Rodwell is wondering whether to try for the uppercut, which depends on partner holding the @s9 or 10, or playing passive|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|c3|pg||
