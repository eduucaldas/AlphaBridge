mb|p|mb|3N|an| |mb|p|nt|mmmakela: of course no dbl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kit: the reason I think low to 9 is right play in slam is that it will be tough for East to duck from King-doubleton|pg||
mb|4D|an| |mb|p|nt|Walddk4: so if 9 loses to jack, I would then take finesse on way back|pg||
nt|santyclz: Isn't the normal play leading the 9 from dmy?|pg||

mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: suitplay says low to 9 and if it loses to J, cash A|pg||
