mb|4S|nt|athene: i worried for years about why that system was called "carrot club" - i believe it's because the inventer had very orange hair|pg||

nt|athene: save your strength for when you need it|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: variable NT in NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: X may not be penalties anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H -- letting NS off the hook|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|cicus: I have a different agreement with my regular partner|pg||

pc|cA|nt|viren169: Hi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and William FRisby, also from England|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: think 2@d 1 @c and 1 @h for 1 down|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Soucasaux is unstoppable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if that were  puppet.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: well even if penalty, it's not exactly clear-cut|pg||
nt|pelu: so we can bid free against u?|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol Peter|pg||
nt|cicus: no, we reopen with a X|pg||
nt|cicus: bid your shortest suit and you are saved|pg||
nt|pelu: u are forced to X gain? - then S can bid 2@S on a big hand!|pg||
nt|hedyg: if NT is 12-14 N must have A@c and K@H|pg||
nt|cicus: no we are not in a forcing situation after 1NT X|pg||
nt|cicus: rule is: don't pass if we may have game|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim 10?|pg||
nt|pelu: but then West has to take some action - he cant just wait and "hope" that pd we X again|pg||

mb|2C!|an|!d|nt|Walddk2: Swan|pg||
nt|athene: knowing that one opponent has 7-12 balanced might help a lot if you get to play it|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so if you can overcome the pre-emptive effect plus the unfamiliarity hurdle you should be ok|pg||
mb|2D!|an|nothing to say|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Or doesn't have that -- some of these precise actions give thoughtful declarers and defenders useful information|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: this looks as though north thought 2@C was a 2@C opener (i.e. strong)?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Genc overbid in the other room. He had a clear pass over the 2@D rebid|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry 2@C was diamonds|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|olson: transfer overcalls  |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: in the other room, north's 2@H pushed them way too high - that sort of problem is why some people play specialised responses to 1minor to show weakish 5@S-4@H hands|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|sQ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|athene: after (for example) 1@D 1@S 2@D, opener might have four hearts without strength to reverse, so responder feels obliged to mention the suit...|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|olson: some play 2h NF after rebid, jumps invite and 3c is art. GF|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: yes, 2@H was definitely an overbid anyway|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
mc|7|nt|othered1: do they play transfer overcalls against opponents who play standardish, natural methods, too?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|olson: y  diamonds is likely a 7 or 8 card fit and partner will bid over 2h  as expected|pg||
pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: that is close to what we do|pg||
nt|hedyg: as takeout of course|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT wouldn't be all that unreasonable with east but 1@D is ok|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Terrible 6@d with 1 redeaming feature: it can make|pg||
nt|athene: west will just bid 3nt i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good morning from Vancouver|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Hi|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|viren169: then I am a simple soul!|pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't bother looking for a 5-3 major fit with that west hand|pg||
nt|athene: N-S are likely to power into 4@H here|pg||
nt|santyclz: N's @ss are more valuable on offense than he anticipates.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: 4333 and plenty of hcp|pg||
nt|athene: well, there are ways 4@H might make|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: after @SA lead, though, west can see the necessity of a fast diamond switch|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|pelu: when u X before the suit: X is values - when u X after the suit more penalty|pg||
mb|2H|nt|viren169: I agree|pg||
nt|athene: even if you find partner with a 5-card major there's no guarantee it will be better than 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3 @c asks for majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3nt No 5 card no 4 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 2@D=any game force|pg||
nt|viren169: although if pd has 5233 shape 4@S may be better...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i don't see much downside to 3@C|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: 3@D = 2-3-5-3 - no 3 card @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now @DA and @D10 should fall out of his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer will surely play the clubs the right way, to protect the @SQx|pg||
nt|athene: lead @CA then @CJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: He will protect the @s Q so will guess @c|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|cicus: one way of two-way checkback|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: easy @c lead and 10 tricks or will he shift to @H?|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|athene: just in case south has a singleton @DJ/@D10|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: three discards are no use; the club finesse can't be avoided|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|pelu: no - 2Nt is also 2-3-5-3 - but a bad @D-suit|pg||
nt|athene: then the layout is revealed and you can take the finesse|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: nicoleta has opened a forcing pass out of turn|pg||
nt|olson: y  depends on style and agreement,  some raise with 3 and ruffing values  or a weak 6 card minor|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: it didnt go through the screen so its back to hugh but he has authorised information|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They not playing with screens I take it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh they are|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: :) forcing pass systems keep directors on their toes|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|athene: E-W are playing pass = 13+?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: McGann was probably intending to bid 5@C over 4@S from opps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have 500 against this|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: this is 500 if NS can double|pg||
nt|athene: but 5@D gives him something of a problem|pg||
mb|5H|nt|vugrapha1: not unreasonably mcgann bids one more though|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, 5@H is reasonable enough|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: And 650 is better than 500|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 650 is better than 500 anyway|pg||
nt|olson: not sure about doubling 5h  when you hold  5d  of the suit partner  bid  |pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure i would double that with West's hand - @DAK are waste paper surely|pg||
nt|othered1: It wasn't getting more than 500 until the double|pg||
nt|othered1: and bid at the 5-level.|pg||
nt|olson: passing 5h  seems a better choice and let partner  participate in the auction   |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: yes nicoleta had no real extras for her first double|pg||
nt|olson: E  will act with values  in passout chair|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: mcgann will take his time but will lose only 2 @c|pg||
nt|athene: if the @SK were the @SA, then maybe you want to double 5@H|pg||
nt|othered1: Offensive extras, now, after partner's @D bid, but that's another contraindication for the double|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|olson: the 5h bidding is obviously not 2722  to bid again infront of his partner  denying N a chance to double 5D|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 5@H is either a 7-5 or a 9-card suit usually|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: now low @C?|pg||
nt|athene: something exciting anyway|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|olson: should S lead a low club  from KQXXX  catering to singleton A |pg||
mc|11|nt|olson: the K only wins if someone has J10 doubleton  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But unlikely that doubler has a singleton club|pg||
nt|othered1: but his objective was to lose only 2@C|pg||
nt|athene: he is happy against stiff @CJ/@C10|pg||
nt|olson: lead low  first time ,   K second round|pg||
nt|olson: y|pg||
nt|olson: he also could lead towards  KQ of clubs when he wins H ace|pg||
nt|athene: east might have a singleton @CJ/@C10, so lead a big one looks right|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: i think J10 doubleton with E more likely that stiff Ace with W|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: by a long way|pg||
pg||

nt|viren169: nice competitive hand now|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C P 1@H now east should bid 2@D i think|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cicus: 14 board match is starting|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: when it comes to overcalling, a good suit compensates for anything|pg||
nt|viren169: or 3@D... not for the faint-hearted!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|santyclz: X or 1@s?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: of course if north just bids 3nt that might shut east out :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: No chance...|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S looks normal to me|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: if you are 2-3-4-4  you open 1@C and rebid 3@D over 2@D to show that shape|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1@C - then u bid 3@D on 2-3-4-4, and 2NT on 2-3-3-5 and bad suit, 3@C on an good suit|pg||
nt|viren169: North saw it coming!|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT Jordan, showing a sound raise to 3@D|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: sensible bid from west|pg||
nt|athene: with 5-loser hand|pg||
nt|athene: nothing to the play:- one trick to lose in each major|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how anyone can be considering doing anything over 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D sorry|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: the thing about bashing 3nt in here is, you don't especially want to shut out east from mentioning a long suit|pg||
nt|athene: because he is on lead anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: small diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|vugraphzkc: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Sry for the delay (connection problems)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: this is the north final championship, final 4 3 matches 20 boards each|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: so cannot differentiate between 2 3 4 4 and 2 2 4 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2245 is not a balanced hand|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@C then 3@D looks 2245 to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's semi-balanced|pg||
nt|pelu: no I dont like to open 1NT with 2-2 i major|pg||
nt|hedyg: you would not bid 1NT after 1@C-1@s?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: interesting that both north players doubled|pg||
nt|santyclz: N could be considering a x on the empirical unlikelihood of 1 side making 11 tricks on any given hand.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: yes, small diamond was definitely preferable with no entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: agree not the best lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a different auction perhaps top diamond correct|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here next to zero chance north has only 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: true, 11 tricks is a lot|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: 3nt shows a very balanced hand for most people so East knows it's overwhelmingly unlikely N-S have 2-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: now declarer can succeed by playing on hearts.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: declarer is likely to put east with a top heart though|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: since otherwise why not a small diamond lead? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: think he will play for @c...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: so he might decide to pin his hopes on the clubs behaving|pg||
nt|viren169: normal to play on clubs and d1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: yes - and have to tell "a story" after 2@D - but no system get 100%|pg||
nt|cicus: @D6 was Smith - don't like clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: N considering a @S switch?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt like any switch|pg||
nt|xenya: which might save a trick if S has AK|pg||
nt|xenya: as it is, it gives an overtrick it seems |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't hurt to cash some spades and see what they do|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: impossible to tell that S has 8@D which would maybe ask for @S and 6 asked for @H|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: In case of a tie, they will play 2 extra boards, and then 2 again if  ....   until one team has won|pg||

nt|dburn: hello|pg||
nt|othered1: Pardon me, set a suit as their trumps|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I really can't tell what they assume on this auction|pg||
nt|othered1: I like that approach.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So it's unassuming :)|pg||
nt|athene: one of the biggest problems when dealing with this sort of bid is the lack of a cue-bid|pg||
nt|olson: it shows a good hand this time  :)|pg||
nt|dburn: interesting treatment, though - North-South may or may not have done their homework|pg||
nt|athene: this is why weak bids with no anchor suit are considered fundamentally more evil than those without|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|othered1: danger!|pg||
nt|dburn: we shall soon see - if North passes, then maybe the dog ate his homework|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poor Hanlon being tortured|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i am surprised he didn't bid 3@D there|pg||
nt|dburn: if on the other hand he bids, then... well, maybe 3@s is a grope in this kind of auction|pg||
nt|athene: it's cheaper and it's where he lives (if that north hand can be said to live anywhere)|pg||
nt|othered1: me, too.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unassuming grope perhaps|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly North cannot have spades - would have passed 1@s doubled|pg||
nt|othered1: Now, do they have an agreement about a second cue-bid?|pg||
nt|athene: south might just bid 6@H in frustration|pg||
nt|dburn: but whether or not 3@s is an overstatement of his values is yet to be discovered|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If nothing else, this is entertaining|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: that contract hasnt gone down yet either - can you hold it to just the @c loser?|pg||
nt|dburn: but certainly North should not bid 3@d - that would be faintly ridiculous|pg||
nt|othered1: If 3@C is a *very* strong call, north has values justifying forcing game (by 3@S)|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|olson: you only have 1 dummy entry and need to finesee both H and spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You have plenty of dummy entries, only one to your hand :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|olson: I meant to the weak hand ,  |pg||
nt|olson: y|pg||
nt|olson: I predict d 1  even with guessing H |pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: I guess he can make it - whether or not he will...|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: well unless there are undertones in the auction we don't know, i think this must count as a moral victory for the 1@S opener, whether or not it makes|pg||
nt|athene: because 6@H looks like a bit of a wild punt|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|olson: he can lead club J and hope opps win this  after drawing 4 rounds of trumps|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

nt|athene: well we don't know for sure what 3@S implied, i agree|pg||

nt|cicus: chance for a swing hewre|pg||
nt|viren169: slam hand... off to the races here|pg||
nt|athene: north hand is hard to express in most systems|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: but when a side actually bids 5 of something that might change the a priori odds somewhat|pg||
nt|athene: however little respect you have for their bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: both ways perhaps|pg||
nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: too good for weak 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@S might show a weak 2-suiter but this might lose the important sixth spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 2 @s is @s and a minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well that simplifies things, matos will ace ask|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure S with still push to the 5 level...|pg||
nt|viren169: great...|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't have a bid, really|pg||
nt|athene: so he will choose between double and 1@S i guess :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps Macsk√°sy could have bid 5@H en route rather than punt 6@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW bidding @Hs helps S|pg||
nt|cicus: after 2@H here @CQ is a favourite to score|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It did not in the CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: careful pass by W|pg||
nt|xenya: but you don't really bid grand missing the trump Q?|pg||
nt|cicus: no but if the auction is crowded you can't pay attentiom to nuances|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Vladimir, but N could have had it but with no chance to raise when partner jumps to 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS not a regular partnership, is 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|xenya: true, Roland|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S is forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: without agreements 2@S is surely forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a method for showing this hand after 2@S opening|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|pelu: diff bid in N - has to bid 3@C - but pd will take is as a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need an agreement if it's not|pg||
nt|viren169: now 6 will be easy when (if) diamonds is found as second suit|pg||
nt|athene: now south has to do something|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: south assumes he is facing only five spades, so will probably ask for the @SQ |pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like S is just going to bash it out...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes 4nt aces for @s and 5 @h asks @s Q|pg||
nt|santyclz: Make a @s a @h and he has a textbook Bramley x.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@H by S|pg||
nt|hedyg: time to cuebid|pg||
nt|hedyg: prefer 3@H|pg||
nt|cicus: is this not risky?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C won't lead anywhere|pg||
nt|cicus: I mean 4@C|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure 3@H agrees clubs|pg||
nt|cicus: Szalay will convert to 4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c normally orkc...|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@D from N (reverse) sh promise 1 bid more|pg||
nt|athene: does that get him into a Bramley Jam?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: but in this sequence..|pg||
nt|cicus: ORKC idf forcing...|pg||
nt|xenya: hope they know what they are doing...|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S reached in the open room|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: with the @SQ and nothing else, north would just bid 6@S, so 6@H shows extras|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|pelu: a jump to 6@C (in my system) = 2 Aces plus a void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know what ORKC is, but you had better explain. Many in the audience don't know I'm sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: orkc= option roman keycard|pg||
nt|cicus: Optional Roman Key.Card asking for aces|pg||
nt|cicus: optional, because it also asks about strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT....|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: 1st step agrees to slam, if other bid than 1st step then dont want slam but show number of keycards|pg||
nt|cicus: 1st step usually weak hand and other responses show aces|pg||
nt|pelu: on 4Nt I jump in the void-suit if lover that trumfp - and jump to 6 in your suit if higher|pg||
nt|viren169: whay 6@H and not 6@C?|pg||
nt|athene: but south, not being able to see all the hands and knowing there's a keycard missing, has no grand slam ambitions|pg||
nt|athene: south can't have been happy about passing throughout|pg||
nt|athene: but he didn't have any convenient bid|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: perhaps north is worried that 6@C might be taken as his second suit|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: i would probably risk 3@D over 2@S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzkc: Sousa Guedes won the round Robein|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Robin|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe Hedy's version is more popular|pg||
nt|athene: showing extra length/strength there|pg||
nt|viren169: North passed at the other table, and drove to slame via RKCB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps 6 of a minor would offer a choice of slams|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: time to claim|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzkc: they all play pretty natural in this room|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Ribeiro is a "new team" on these finals|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: but usually without special agreement, if you pass over a suit then later double, partner is going to assume it's penalties|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h6|nt|athene: as with a t/o double you could have acted the first time|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: if their methods allowed hugh to pass the double (ie play mcgann's X as at least @s tolerance) then hughes would have had to run|pg||
nt|othered1: you can look at the other room's result and say "ti wasn't game," but it could lose a decent size swing|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: i would certainly bid 2@S with west's hand over 1@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nobody seems to assume x's are penalty any more.|pg||
nt|athene: it worries opps when you bid their suits|pg||
nt|athene: and it usually works out just fine|pg||
nt|athene: as long as you have a decent suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: in theory south has more room now but that might not be a bonus if he hasn't discussed these sequences|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: X for penalty, but I dont exp that S will accept - 4@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H problematic here?|pg||

nt|santyclz: Or else a great vul vs not psyche.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: 4@SX in CR, E overcalled...2@s|pg||
nt|athene: when you have one suit with an ace and one without, it's normal to lead the non-ace suit, but it's also normal to prefer a 5-card suit, so east had a close decision there i think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond shift now|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... I would have lead a @S... |pg||

mb|5D|nt|athene: it wasn't completely bonkers|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I think it was natural|pg||
nt|xenya: has to bid 5@H now|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D was natural|pg||
nt|hedyg: showing 10+|pg||
nt|xenya: danger now|pg||
nt|cicus: S has a good hand but worthless 5 points in spades|pg||
nt|pelu: need a @C-lead to defeat 5@H - impossible to find|pg||
nt|cicus: so shouldn't be tempted|pg||
nt|xenya: didn't N show something stronger than he has?|pg||
nt|hedyg: well...beauty is in the eye of the beholder|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has a great hand on pds 1@h opening|pg||
nt|xenya: sure -- but not too many high cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: points shmoints|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree that he is too good for 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: This shouldn't be very eventful and the lead of either long suit can cost a trick|pg||
nt|mmmakela: small S? or dias?|pg||
nt|othered1: if dec larer can read the position|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh well.  Was expecting a low @s from n, low @d from dmy and a test on how smoothly n could duck.|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I prefer 3@H here|pg||
nt|viren169: by West|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C seems better than that delayed double|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: can S count on the @HA, for example?|pg||
nt|pelu: Is S looking for 2Aces or 1S-void by pd?|pg||
nt|athene: the key to the hand is the club void facing no strength |pg||
nt|viren169: all too late she cried!|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: well they got it there in a different way|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: you can never count on an ace|pg||

pc|h4|nt|athene: it would have been raised to 4, i guess|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@SX in CR|pg||
nt|viren169: I'm sure E/W are not on solid ground... but they landed on their feet!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: no wasted points in @c....|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|athene: but he won't get time|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|pelu: best now is @HA and @H 2, but a ruffing finess in @C will bring 5@H home|pg||
nt|pelu: will or can :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|olson: maybe he wants partner to stop bidding when he has a 1 count ?|pg||

nt|dburn: what in the name of reason would compel anyone to intervene with those cards?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: OK, a good reason not to double|pg||
nt|olson: maybe passing 1N shows a good and and they must bid ?  :)|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: he will probably take the @h finesse even though its into the danger hand in case hughes has @cA|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, at least West in this room started with 2@c - West at the other table bid two *hearts*, if you please|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H on that West hand seems Lemmingesque|pg||
nt|athene: do you really want to go to the 3-level?|pg||
nt|olson: 2h seems bold  hoping  for  110  when opps  are  trying to make 90|pg||
nt|othered1: but she didn't bid 2@H, only 2@C|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|olson: 2c  lets you play  2 of a minor ,   2h  gets  higher  |pg||

nt|vugrapha1: mcgann is taking a short break|pg||
nt|bigtrain: especially when the intervention is natural -- artificial bids allow cardX which is the usually way of obtaining larger paenalty|pg||

mb|2H|an|4H and 5+m|nt|cicus: I guess a discussion is taking place right now|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzkc: N/S might be in trouble here|pg||
nt|santyclz: The usual Ghestem result.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Pass before the x'ing starts.|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, EW have some points and fit, but not much anything makes, not even stop on a dime 2@H in open room|pg||
nt|athene: the auction is likely to start 1@C 1@S (2@H) X support and north can conceal the diamond side-suit|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cicus: E does not want to pass nor does he want to encourage, goes the middle road|pg||
nt|pelu: why 1NT????? - do they play 1@S/1NT reversed?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s was an option as well?|pg||
nt|pelu: the middle road ? 1Nt = no road :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, they play 1NT f1 and he doesnt want to show @s, just a weak @H fit|pg||
nt|xenya: i would have seriously considered a pass as E|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6 losers, 2@d is enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: x means 3 @s support|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps exclusion now|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: facing two non-heart keycards you are happy to have a shot at 7@S|pg||
nt|athene: exclusion keycard is usually a jump to something above 4nt|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting lead coming up for East...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: here, N-S have the room to employ it at a lower level - IF they have agree this sort of thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: *agreed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H splinter for me, but can continue with 5@H void|pg||
nt|athene: this is interesting|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: north wins @SK and switches to a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: east has to duck but now south can switch back to a club|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: playing artificial reverses?|pg||
nt|othered1: this can be a very large swing 12 imps or more.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: seems good lead by W (for them...)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cicus: 2@S prpbably game forcing without spades|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think this auction is really getting to grips with the hand|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we know what 4@S showed?|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence come to diamond, 2 clubs, and 2 spades|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: 2@S must be artificial game force?|pg||
nt|cicus: not sure about that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cicus: one of my advisors says it is 17-18 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was just natural i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S was signoff, i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: he assumed 4@H was a splinter, either singleton or void|pg||
nt|viren169: I think N is living dangerously!|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't have anything|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: abot what W actually has|pg||
pc|c3|nt|santyclz: N didn't keep a low @d?|pg||
nt|viren169: .either red suit will allow Declarer to claim quickly|pg||
nt|athene: north would have been better-off just bidding 5@H over 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart lead 12 with no guess|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I agree|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have heart void, great hand, but neither minor-suit ace"|pg||
nt|athene: and hence must have solid trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: they got it there anyway ...|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|cicus: but then I can't understand 3@D - why not pass 2NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so E could have pulled the brakes in 3@H|pg||
nt|viren169: anyone for stone age 2@S over 1@C?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: unfortunately this should go 2 off|pg||
nt|athene: east did well to lead a trump, i think|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to just hope his partner has the @DA|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzkc: yes sry|pg||
nt|athene: he knows a heart lead might well give declarer a free @HAQ finesse|pg||
nt|athene: (west didn't double 5@H to show an honour, and north is void)|pg||
nt|athene: and if north is void in hearts he has length in one or other minor so a minor-suit lead could solve his side-suit problems|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is a 2@S bid, will wait awhile to use that bid again|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer should get it right in the end... considering East bid 2@H |pg||
nt|athene: i don't mind a strong jump shift response with north's hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C - 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes. Declarer as to guess but he will|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't supposed to use the bid on a 2-suiter but north can happily just treat that hand as a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|athene: but probably they don't play strong jump shifts - no-one seems to, these days|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... bets to treat it as single (solid) suiter|pg||
nt|viren169: works v nicely on this hand!|pg||

nt|athene: well cashing the @HA finds the second spade loser :)|pg||

nt|athene: diamond lead will make things easy|pg||
nt|athene: you look at the @D9 and claim 12 :)|pg||

nt|othered1: The @SK in partner's long suit usually is worth it weight in gold.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: I think the key is to find KQ in front of all those cards...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: it will not work for N/S...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzkc: probably 4 @d would help more...|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|hedyg: trump lead looked automatic with those @ss|pg||
nt|viren169: it was a hasty dble... would probably had a chance to dble 3N or 4@S!!!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|athene: two rounds of hearts, then spade to hand, @HK|pg||
nt|athene: even if east didn't have the @S10 you could probably strip-squeeze north in the blacks|pg||
nt|athene: to lead up to the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead wld have led to 12 tricks i think|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|othered1: I don't think north did anything but show @D of some type and a bunch of points of some sort.   |pg||
nt|Walddk5: flat, 6@H in the OR|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|athene: a top heart and it's easy; a low heart and that gives declarer 11 fast tricks with several options for 12|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|xenya: now the plan looks clearcut -- 2@Hs, 4@S (including 2 ruffs), 2@D (including a ruff) and a natural trump ytick|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs asking re 4@hs, there is a slight @d problem |pg||
nt|athene: east, holding all three side-suits, is still going to get minced on the clubs|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d7|nt|viren169: North needs to be careful not to concede an overtrick...|pg||
nt|santyclz: I would make an early @d pitch, hoping declarer has the j.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: if he throws a diamond, he will have to give a trick to the @CK for +1|pg||
nt|viren169: I think North is wondering why he dbled in the 1st place!|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: no reason not to throw club jack however|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: as a spectator points out, west could throw the @DJ to tell his partner what he has|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|viren169: 1 over trick!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s3|pc|h8|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: also quickly gets tapped in @H|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|cicus: now if he can take one more trick...|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: declarer can play for the overtrick perfectly safely since he has eight in the bank|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: getting rid of the extra @s loser an illusion|pg||

mb|1S!|an|0-7 any|nt|Walddk2: oh 1@S, even better|pg||
mb|p|nt|olson: it is easier since we knew trumps 3/3  and they could ruff with the 109 of H|pg||
mb|3C|an|natural, 10-18|nt|olson: it seems more fun to play this system than to comment on it   |pg||
nt|Walddk2: In Australia most anything is allowed (I like that approach, by the way)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: it comes as a surprise to our foreign visitors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't kill bridge by imposing restriction upon restriction |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: but most australian pairs cope fine with artificial methods becuase they see them more frequently|pg||

nt|othered1: Are unrestricted conventions allowed in 2-board plair games?  At what levels?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you think you can attract youngsters when you tell them that you can't play this and not that either?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: pair games|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's no fun for them|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: you cant play this system in open pairs|pg||

nt|viren169: Nicely done by declarer!|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt E-W here, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C 1@H X Pass 1NT should end it, i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Stopping in 6 is good evaluation if you're going to play @hs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: N doubled in CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: and they stopped in 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: upgrade to 1nt opener is reasonable enough|pg||
mb|1C|nt|cicus: bold|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that's true|pg||
nt|othered1: With a student it could start 2@C - 3@D (6-card suit with at least an honor trick in it) plus side K or more.  Gets relatively easy after that, though the @CQ might be hard to ...|pg||
nt|othered1: find.  This for play in @D or NT on slam hand|pg||
nt|athene: majors or spades from south now|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... 1N-3N for me|pg||
nt|athene: unless he passes, sulking, after the previous board|pg||
nt|viren169: assuming South passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: west not sulking|pg||
nt|athene: well, whatever south does, west will probably just bid the same 3nt he was going to anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C=majors or single suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: single suit|pg||
nt|viren169: West may find out 1st before bidding 3N... as South is on lead|pg||
nt|athene: so both pairs playing Capp|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double by west?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|hedyg: 2NT is not jacoby, it is invite +|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: If South has hearts he can bid 3@H to avoid losing 5 heart tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: prefer pass and see what happens|pg||
nt|athene: win in dummy, diamond to the @D8 perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: win in dummy and low to diamond nine?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@c was minimum|pg||
nt|cicus: and he accepted...|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes he accepted his own invitation|pg||
nt|pelu: and when pd sh minimum with 3@C - where did he find values for game??|pg||
nt|cicus: exactly :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: thinks he needs imps..|pg||
nt|viren169: duck a diamonds seems like a good play?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cicus: yes, after this board|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: I must leave for a bit.  Thanks all and bye!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Thanks, bye|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is, the hearts aren't quite so secure that you are happy about esoteric safety plays in diamonds|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|xenya: well it makes now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cicus: great lead|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead the defence have four hearts and @CAQ to cash |pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: now north can kill the diamonds however|pg||
nt|athene: no chance now|pg||
nt|viren169: this may go poorly now...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: declarer was hoping to snag a stiff diamond honour with south|pg||
nt|athene: but probably, on balance, small diamond to the @D8 was best - it's very unlikely they can cash four hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@H dbled went 2-off on the last in the other room...|pg||
nt|viren169: the T and 9 seems like hugh cards... |pg||
nt|athene: assuming declarer plays three rounds of diamonds|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|cicus: now @HQ is sure to score|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm how do you beat it now?|pg||
nt|xenya: a mundane would have beaten it easily|pg||
nt|cicus: (famous last words)|pg||
nt|cicus: of course he could not lead a diamond in front of the eyes of 1500 spectators :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Homannay knows Szalay..|pg||
nt|xenya: a mundane @D i meant|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|ady: 3@H ok here    3@s   looks like down 1|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|hedyg: now forcing declarer to play K@H|pg||
nt|cicus: now show a high @D as well|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cicus: the problem is that if his @H was single, why did he not X 1@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: what happened?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|athene: finesse @S10 and throw @SA on @D is a flashy sort of play|pg||
nt|athene: but it doesn't really help very much|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cute|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzkc: probably Pinto should have bid it...|pg||
nt|ady: I think east might have competed with 3@H    |pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
nt|viren169: I think declarer played South for singleton honor or 2-2|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: it just means south can't play spades|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: but there are plenty of other things for the defence to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: no he can't|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: now|pg||
nt|athene: right :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|viren169: noone has any spades to play!|pg||
nt|athene: south discards the @SJ as a safety play against accidentally pulling the wrong card later in the hand and giving declarer entry to dummy|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|viren169: 6@H could become a trick!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Pass of 2@d was the winner.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: 2@C was puppet stayman, so 2@D didn't deny a 4-card major, so east had to press on|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H in other room so looks like flat|pg||
