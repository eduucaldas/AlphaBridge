nt|kit: North should compete to 3@H over 2@S if they only knew partner had a doubleton spade also|pg||
nt|janm: Zhuang did well by bidding slowly - bought the hand for 2@s when NS can probably make 4@h|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|janm: I guess 2@s is going down 1 - 1 spade, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds and a club to lose. The defenders have done well to set up the diamond tricks while maintaining an entry in N|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||

pc|d2|pc|s4|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
mc|10|nt|kit: I guess East was playing partner for something like AQ10x (or A10xx and a side entry) in diamonds, and was afraid ducking the spade would cost a key tempo|pg||
