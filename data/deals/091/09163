nt|jtr: Good morning people|pg||
nt|jtr: Happy St David's Day|pg||
nt|jtr: So, the action replays commence|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: yes they were such interesting boards that we wish to play them again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: lol|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: So, not particularly low-scoring.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 19 imps in 8 boards is quite low-scoring where I come from|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is some sort of three-way match, which some sort of scoring method to see who wins. (I thought I would share that with you).|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|jtr: Very sharp this morning David|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Scoring: if you win both your matches, you go through|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: if each team wins a match, the scores are converted to VPs|pg||
nt|jtr: Not an appertising choice for East|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jtr: I much prefer Fredin's action|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: Even after a diamond lead, in the other room, I was told by a learned kibitzer that 2@S could have gone two down with best defence.|pg||
mb|d|nt|jtr: He is happier now though|pg||
nt|jtr: I read somewhere that you should lead trumps against a doubled partscore|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: In one of your books maybe David?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I read that in "The Pairs Game"|pg||
nt|jtr: Hehe|pg||
nt|brolucius: I never lead trumps, so you are asking the wrong person.|pg||
nt|jtr: Must have been one of my books then|pg||
nt|brolucius: "I could hardly lead a trump when I had @DK-10-7-2 as an alternative."|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can't say I like the 2@D overcall - I prefer to get majors into the game|pg||
nt|jtr: Yep, said that myself Liz|pg||
nt|jtr: Much as i hate agreeing with you|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Must hurt a lot, David|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful: will he find @c lead, unlikely|pg||
nt|pitiful: sorry private|pg||
nt|jtr: What else?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing a strong 1@C system, North had the option of passing 1@H.|pg||
nt|jtr: Other than a trump|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he is touching a diamond|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, a lively board to open the session. That is what we like.|pg||
nt|jtr: @d would not work well|pg||
nt|jtr: I am half asleep so it doesnt hurt that much|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|brolucius: When two BBO commentators agree, they are almost certain to be wrong.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's decision to double on the third round, suggests that he does not hold primary club support and may therefore be good in diamonds.|pg||
nt|jtr: Maximum one down now i would say|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hopes to shorten his trump - but a club would be better|pg||
nt|brolucius: We can see that a club lead would work well, but I would not have fancied it when holding those East cards. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe a trump is best from his point of view|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Bird's Law|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|jtr: Other than a @c maybe the @hJ was an option  Partner has shown length there|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not that anyone ever agrees with what I say.|pg||
nt|jtr: Thelma?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So had South!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jtr: noooo|pg||
nt|jtr: I just cannot understand that|pg||
nt|dburn: it may not have happened|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it did |pg||
nt|jtr: Exactly|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would not have bid 1@S with three-card support. So, he was marked with @HK-x. |pg||
nt|jtr: Can you see the logic DB?|pg||
nt|dburn: in that case, I don't understand it either|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|sQ|nt|cuttysark: I guess he did not want to establish dummy's hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he succeeded in that objective at least|pg||
nt|jtr: Suggested that East may have a singleton @h  But i dont think that is possible on the bidding|pg||
nt|jtr: Although the @h6 may have confused Fredin|pg||
nt|jtr: I am sure it wont be Fredin's fault anyway.....|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I believe they play reverse count|pg||
nt|dburn: I am pretty certain they do|pg||
nt|brolucius: North is more or less marked with only four spades by East's pass of 2@S doubled. He would not have bid 1@S with four spades and three-card heart support. Nor would he have passed ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: the first double (rather than bidding 2@H then).|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or Upside Down to the nonBrits|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, I have to agree with her. |pg||
pc|sA|nt|jtr: So 1IMP for Sweden|pg||
nt|brolucius: The defence is going well.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unexpected gain - -470 is not normally a winning score|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jtr: After this result we are going to have a very close match|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|jtr: Well, had he played the @hJ i dont think the second low @h would cost|pg||
nt|cuttysark: As do all Scandinavians, I am informed|pg||
nt|jtr: I have seen some play standard count|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thought you would have, David :)|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|jtr: Not home yet anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: they weren't actually playing it, but his eyesight isn't what it used to be|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: MEck says sorry for taking so long|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am also informed that Norwegians play standard count. Does that mean they are not Scandinavian?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he needs to think about this - but I expect he'll pitch a club eventually|pg||
nt|jtr: If he ruffs it gives East trump control i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer must know, from the bidding, almost exactly how the remaining cards lie.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: still thinking|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps, but a while ago it seemed that no one had the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|jtr: So maybe he has to pitch a @c?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dburn: well done|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice play|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can't understand why Fredin covered this one - should he not duck?|pg||
nt|jtr: he has maybe played the game before?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: It has been a limbo competition between the two West players, both trying to duck under the other one's score.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks as if NS have got themselves endplayed|pg||
nt|jtr: South must duck the @c when North plays one|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|cuttysark: OK, nearly!|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps he has only just discovered that he had the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: and wanted to reassure everyone that it was still in the deck|pg||
nt|dburn: but ducking would not have made much difference to the result, only to the order of play by which it was obtained|pg||
nt|brolucius: West heard the mutterings from kibitzers when he ducked the @HA the first two times and decided he had better not do it again.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|jtr: Yes he just pitches a @c on the @h and another on the @hA|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jtr: Oh|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d4|nt|jtr: hmmm|pg||

nt|Walddk2: after a few other bids|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I like an optimist - he added a few points for luck|pg||
nt|henryb: yes. East could not resist bidding Stayman, and West with his 16 carried on over 2N I bet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not quite|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: East bid 2@C  Puppet, and over 2@D forced, East bid 2@H to show spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|an|11-15 3 suited, short !d|nt|jtr: 2@d is short @ds|pg||
nt|brolucius: Easy to be wise after the event, but perhaps West's second double was a little bold? He was perhaps worried that Rodwell had opened very light in 3rd seat and they were being ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: talked out of a contract their way.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jtr: 4-4-4-1 or 3-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|dburn: if South had raised 1@s to 2@s, West would have doubled|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jtr: Could be 4-4-0-5 too thanks to a spec for that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: not sure what shapes Rodwell can have for this, but Meckstroth knows he has a fit in one of the majors|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|dburn: and perhaps he wants to play in spades even facing 3=4=1=5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like they might beat this one|pg||
nt|jtr: I am sure he only guarantees 3@ss|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Still it is a guaranteed 8-card fit, quite likely 9, with a secondary heart fit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West's play should be suit preference here, since he must know this is a singlelton|pg||
nt|brolucius: He does now, anyway...|pg||
nt|jtr: wow nice 2NT bid to have available|pg||
nt|brolucius: Any kibitzers who are confused about the scoring for this stage of the event would be well advised not to ask me about it.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dburn: must he? would East not lead @hA from a doubleton?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: When dummy has shown hearts?|pg||
nt|jtr: Based on the last hand, he may lead it before it runs away:)|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|brolucius: Hah!|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not the best defence so likely only 1|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ralfwil: Is it usual to put on the highest from a sequence, when partner plays the suit. I normally play the lowest. Here @dJ from J10xx|pg||
mb|1N|nt|henryb: 170 and 140 is also an imp: 5 or 4|pg||
nt|ady: think they might get overboard here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Quite hard to hold it to 7 tricks, I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|an|minors|mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|mdgraham: 2@H seems a bit windy|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: thinking of catching up?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: still, he caught up|pg||
nt|henryb: seems to me it shows proper appreciation of the lack of value of quacks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: but even so, this is rather trappy bidding|pg||
nt|ady: only need club finesse and hearts behaving|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|henryb: or a @s lead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Is 3@H invitational for any of you? It isn't for me. You have lots of other bids available for an invite|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, competitive|pg||
nt|ady: have to get diamonds soon|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Purely competing - looks as if North revalued his collection|pg||
nt|henryb: yes all those quacks suddenly became 6 high card points!|pg||
nt|henryb: (quacks are queens and jacks)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Manaca should know declarer has the singleton @SK|pg||
nt|ady: was  this the 2@C lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did partner not lead a spade? Because he doesn't have both top honours|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2D!|an|inverted|nt|jtr: How many @ss?|pg||
nt|jtr: Just 4 probably :)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he may bid some number of clubs|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dburn: in an attempt to secure the right lead against diamonds, should the opponents bid a lot of those|pg||
nt|brolucius: They are using screens, so Lindqvist might not know that he has turned up for the wrong match.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He may fondly imagine that his correct partner is the other side.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: David Burn has such a story|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: thanks for waking me up|pg||
nt|jtr: it did happen once to my knowledge|pg||
nt|jtr: A player used the bathroom and went back to the wrong table|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 4@c may be @cs|pg||
nt|brolucius: Did he change a losing score into a winning one?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: North is not sure that's their agreement and now Nystrom is explaining, a bit unsure too|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: and @ss of course|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Would be Fit for many|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, the correct player returned too quickly|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|jtr: Needs to sneak a @h then cross-ruff|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most players would have thought for longer, what to do on the North cards. He had already shown the value of his hand in diamonds, though, and could judge from South's pass that he ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: probably held a weak NT type.|pg||
nt|jtr: But if North rises then he has the @h suit|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|brolucius: Well, this will be interesting. They have found the sacrifice and we will see how much it costs them, with that club break. |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jtr: Might be 300 only|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He needs somehow to organise club ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|jtr: I must say North took a bit of a gamble|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cuttysark: To gain 3, or lose 2 if he is three down|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jtr: I would prefer the @sJ to ask for a @h|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or deny holding @SK?|pg||
nt|jtr: Suit preference usually applies when dummy has a singleton|pg||
nt|brolucius: A club switch will not make much difference, as it happens.|pg||
nt|jtr: Possibly he wanted another @s|pg||
nt|jtr: to shorten dummy|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jtr: High asks @h, low asks @c middle is encouraging|pg||
nt|jtr: Surely he will pitch a @h?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|jtr: But maybe he hopes the @cs will behave and he can set up discards|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Looks a good idea, since he cannot really expect to avoid a heart loser. No, he has ruffed.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Don't call you Shirley|pg||
nt|jtr: Elizabeth Shirley McGowan?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I predict a club|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|s7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to wait and see what he does, Liz, before making any predictions. |pg||
nt|jtr: @cs 3-2 with the K onside and trumps breaking he would make this|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, not many VG operators find the time to put in bidding explanations. We are lucky today.|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Both Wests have bid Michaels over the transfer|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is a great fit for N-S. Meckstroth-Rodwell did well to bid 4@H, even though West had indicated spades (with a Michaels bid) over South's @SK-x.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brolucius: A clever understanding by the Swedes, which leaves more room for South to express his hand - if East passes - than 3@H would.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|jtr: See Liz, i really dont need to look at the bidding:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2@H some form of Michaels, spades + a minor|pg||

nt|odysseus69: though not certain- and 2NT may not be making- passing 2Nt is a reasonable option|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess South could have made himself declarer|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems that the ranges are 12-14 and 14-16, so South has not bid so boldly at this table. |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some South players would justify stopping low with: 'I did not like my @SK-x under the Michaels bid'. It is amazing how often that is not the case and partner has something good in ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: spades. |pg||
nt|jtr: I really see no reason that 2@h was Michaels  other than he has the right shape|pg||
nt|cuttysark: When you have the club in your bag, you just gotta use it|pg||
nt|dburn: it is possible to play that double is takeout of hearts, and 2@h is Michaels|pg||
nt|dburn: but some prefer double to be just diamonds|pg||

mb|1N|nt|brolucius: Yes, it was a fine defence. West had every reason to think that North would hold the @CK but could see that he needed East to hold it to give the defence a chance.|pg||

mb|3N|nt|brolucius: Quite rightly, neither West player has thought it worthwhile to look for a 4-4 heart fit (on their 4-3-3-3 shape).|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some might use five-card Stayman in case there was a 5-4 heart fit, but that is statistically unlikely and you would give information away.|pg||

nt|dburn: with each team having won one match|pg||
nt|brolucius: Although I preferred Meckstroth's action to Bertheau's, the tempo of the two auctions resulted in a big swing to Sweden - albeit after excellent play by the Swedish declarer in 5@C ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: doubled.|pg||
mb|2D!|an|multi|nt|brolucius: I don;t mind a board being slow when so much is at stake and the eventual play is worthwhile.|pg||
nt|jtr: Results should soon appear on|pg||

nt|jtr: Only one team goes through to the final|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|jtr: fabulous website|pg||
mb|3H!|an|correctible|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I guess Par is 6@H doubled-1|pg||
nt|jtr: 5@h coming i guess|pg||
nt|dburn: you might beat it two, on a good day|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Sorry, everybody - I forgot that the ace of trump takes a trick|pg||
nt|brolucius: That seems to finish the action. Many thanks to our excellent VG operator (clap, clap!) and to my fellow commentators, who fought a fine and entertaining battle.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: can't believe Bertheau passed 2@H!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he didnt|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry, Nick!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|brolucius: The @HA does not always take a trick.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That must have been what confused me :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: Blame it on Fredin.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jtr: Nick was revelling in the acolade:)|pg||
nt|dburn: will East take a swing at this?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Some sort of fizzy drink for British players?|pg||

nt|jtr: So, it looks like well done to Sweden to reach the final|pg||
nt|dburn: so that (assuming no accidents) Sweden will move 5 IMPs closer, and play tomorrow's final|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugrapha3: claimed at Trick 1|pg||
nt|dburn: best play of the tournament|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|brolucius: East hopes to find his partner with a 'glint of steel' (as Reese used to call it) for his vulnerable weak two. I hope he can find it.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|jtr: You have to blame Fredin as he never blames himself:)|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugrapha3: back almost immediately|pg||
nt|jtr: oh we have another 8!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Fredin is very self-critical. Or he would be if the need ever arose. |pg||
nt|jtr: So we will see these boards played by these pair's teammates|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it would help to play another eight boards, otherwise these matches will not be easy to score|pg||
nt|brolucius: An interesting set of boards.|pg||
nt|jtr: I am glad i gave you some ammunition at last; must have been a frustrating set of boards:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that the next session will involve exactly the same boards being played again. I hope the players have not been watching BBO.|pg||
