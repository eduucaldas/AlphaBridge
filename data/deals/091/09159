nt|mariner1: Dave Thompson has been our superb operator.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 6@S can make 7 hard to bid off a key though|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|mariner1: S opened 1@D in other match too|pg||
nt|swanson: We get to see the same 8 boards as we say previously - the good news is that they are exciting hands.|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D!|nt|mariner1: hi John!|pg||
nt|swanson: One would rather open a weak 2@D, but that is not coventionally allowed.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mariner1: slam makes, how many they bid is the issue......|pg||
nt|swanson: I'm surprised Mechstroth didn't try something over the double - why give the opponents a free ride?|pg||
nt|swanson: He is an inexperience played and doesn't understand these things.|pg||
nt|swanson: player|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs lessons? :)|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|swanson: Can't very well stay out.  West can bid it on his own now.|pg||
nt|mariner1: W will try for the grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: As he did.|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|mariner1: Grue free bidding 3@H gave Curtis all the info he needed|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kareno: Hello from Las Vegas :)|pg||
nt|swanson: Double, I believe says DON'T lead the suit.  Strange, or maybe because diamonds can be a non-suit in Precision it doesn't count.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Welcome Karen Allison|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Karen|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mariner1: well we got a grand|pg||
nt|kareno: What a choice of contract!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|swanson: West is assuming )with justification) that the spade finesse is on if needed.|pg||
nt|kareno: Happily hearts break and if declarer is careful and draws all the trump he will make it.|pg||
nt|mariner1: this makes though and puts them up in the match|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|kareno: Makes IF east draws trumps after first spade finesse.  Spades much better if you're going to play a grand.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|swanson: Would East have bid a grand with @SK and @HAQ?  probably not off this auction.|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|hedyg: i think our operator is Krisztina|pg||

nt|pelu: X or bid 3@h?|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: variable NT in NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|cicus: X may not be penalties anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H -- letting NS off the hook|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D!|nt|Walddk4: Against the odds to make a move with the East cards in my opinion|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzkc: Guedes won the round robin and on yesterday 16-14 |pg||
nt|santyclz: An ugly 1nt with @cqj tight and no spots.|pg||

mb|p|mb|7H|nt|cicus: I have a different agreement with my regular partner|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: Hi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and William FRisby, also from England|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: think 2@d 1 @c and 1 @h for 1 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps he has a way to sign off in 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Soucasaux is unstoppable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if that were  puppet.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: well even if penalty, it's not exactly clear-cut|pg||
nt|pelu: so we can bid free against u?|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol Peter|pg||
nt|cicus: no, we reopen with a X|pg||
nt|cicus: bid your shortest suit and you are saved|pg||
nt|pelu: u are forced to X gain? - then S can bid 2@S on a big hand!|pg||
nt|hedyg: if NT is 12-14 N must have A@c and K@H|pg||
nt|cicus: no we are not in a forcing situation after 1NT X|pg||
nt|cicus: rule is: don't pass if we may have game|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim 10?|pg||
nt|pelu: but then West has to take some action - he cant just wait and "hope" that pd we X again|pg||

nt|mariner1: names...... its a glitch on the BBO side|pg||
mb|1H|nt|swanson: West didn't know partner how many spades partner held so couldn't afford to bid the grand in spades.|pg||
nt|mariner1: enter a room and the names will be correct|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|swanson: This is a close game, but my guess is that N-S will bid it.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mariner1: that is they kind of hand you worry the opponents get needing good score.....|pg||
nt|mariner1: fortunately it is at the beginning and not the end|pg||
nt|swanson: Needs spade guess plus something else.|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Meckwell use 2@D as the standard Precision (4441) hand.  Still, a system minus.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mariner1: this looks flat however requires help or a @S guess|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: @S on, @D on so a lot working as John said|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: 5-4 I would accept for sure.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|kareno: With their light opening style, their invitations are pretty sound.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|swanson: We say Norway bid this game also.  North responded 1@S, then invited in hearts.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|swanson: I suggested that South would not have accepted at that table with 1-3 in blacks rather than 2-2.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's a decent (though aceless) eleven with good hearts. |pg||
nt|mariner1: if you open light your tools need to be well oiled and sharp,,, Meckwell's are pristine|pg||
nt|mariner1: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Very likely not.  Misfit does not improve a hand.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|swanson: The contract needs to not have two spade losers plus a little something else.  About right vulnerable.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mariner1: well that was an interesting cover in @c|pg||
nt|kareno: Could trick declarer.  Fortunately the diamond ruffs out and he cannot misguess spades.|pg||
nt|swanson: East played his partner for KQ doubleton of clubs.  West shoud lead a low club a trick two.|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, really, west should lead K, 5.  K, Q indicates a doubleton.|pg||
nt|kareno: GMTA John :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kareno: Rodwell risks that the lead actually was a doubleton.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|kareno: He is very close to a high cross ruff.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|swanson: South had a close choice to bid or pass - the vulnerable game is so enticing and he does have good diamond honors.|pg||

nt|mariner1: the winner of this triangle plays Netherlands for the Yeh Cup, however the|pg||
nt|mariner1: Netherlands get a bye here and a 6.5 imp carryover in the final...|pg||
nt|swanson: He woun't have bid it with three clubs and a singleton spade.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|swanson: This didn't hurt the defense - just gave Rodwell a problem he could go wrong on.|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: that is close to what we do|pg||
nt|hedyg: as takeout of course|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT wouldn't be all that unreasonable with east but 1@D is ok|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Terrible 6@d with 1 redeaming feature: it can make|pg||
nt|athene: west will just bid 3nt i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good morning from Vancouver|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Hi|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|viren169: then I am a simple soul!|pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't bother looking for a 5-3 major fit with that west hand|pg||
nt|athene: N-S are likely to power into 4@H here|pg||
nt|santyclz: N's @ss are more valuable on offense than he anticipates.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: 4333 and plenty of hcp|pg||
nt|athene: well, there are ways 4@H might make|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: after @SA lead, though, west can see the necessity of a fast diamond switch|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|pelu: when u X before the suit: X is values - when u X after the suit more penalty|pg||
mb|3H|nt|viren169: I agree|pg||
nt|athene: even if you find partner with a 5-card major there's no guarantee it will be better than 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3 @c asks for majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3nt No 5 card no 4 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 2@D=any game force|pg||
nt|viren169: although if pd has 5233 shape 4@S may be better...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i don't see much downside to 3@C|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: 3@D = 2-3-5-3 - no 3 card @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now @DA and @D10 should fall out of his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer will surely play the clubs the right way, to protect the @SQx|pg||
nt|athene: lead @CA then @CJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: He will protect the @s Q so will guess @c|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|cicus: one way of two-way checkback|pg||
nt|xenya: may be an exact tie after this board|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: easy @c lead and 10 tricks or will he shift to @H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would 2NT be 3343, Peter?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|viren169: nice play|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cicus: not now, S encouraged clubs|pg||
nt|athene: now @DK then diamond to the ace|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c5|nt|athene: just in case south has a singleton @DJ/@D10|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: three discards are no use; the club finesse can't be avoided|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|pelu: no - 2Nt is also 2-3-5-3 - but a bad @D-suit|pg||
nt|athene: then the layout is revealed and you can take the finesse|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: Depends on agreement|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: what about 2 3 4 4 ?|pg||

nt|swanson: East invited game with his shaky 9 HCP opposite a opening 14-16 1NT opening at the other table.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kareno: I would say normal to bid it with nine and a five-card suit.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: The 14-16 should have kept them out at the other table I believe.  This contract has no chance.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: S in other play gave W a couple of chances to duck a @S,,,,,, will Rodwell?|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like the defense get their five before declarer gets his nine.  |pg||
nt|mariner1: they need to get 6 though|pg||

nt|mariner1: yes and he knows N has the 4th @H|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer can hope for the @DJ falling now and then maybe something else good happening.|pg||
nt|mariner1: he has entries to dummy (though he does not know yet about @S) however I doubt S|pg||

nt|athene: 1@C P 1@H now east should bid 2@D i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 14 board match is starting|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: when it comes to overcalling, a good suit compensates for anything|pg||
nt|viren169: or 3@D... not for the faint-hearted!|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: X or 1@s?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: of course if north just bids 3nt that might shut east out :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: No chance...|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S looks normal to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: if you are 2-3-4-4  you open 1@C and rebid 3@D over 2@D to show that shape|pg||

nt|viren169: North saw it coming!|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT Jordan, showing a sound raise to 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sensible bid from west|pg||
nt|athene: with 5-loser hand|pg||
nt|athene: nothing to the play:- one trick to lose in each major|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how anyone can be considering doing anything over 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the thing about bashing 3nt in here is, you don't especially want to shut out east from mentioning a long suit|pg||
nt|athene: because he is on lead anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: small diamond|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzkc: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Sry for the delay (connection problems)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: this is the north final championship, final 4 3 matches 20 boards each|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: so cannot differentiate between 2 3 4 4 and 2 2 4 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2245 is not a balanced hand|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@C then 3@D looks 2245 to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's semi-balanced|pg||
nt|pelu: no I dont like to open 1NT with 2-2 i major|pg||
nt|hedyg: you would not bid 1NT after 1@C-1@s?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: interesting that both north players doubled|pg||
nt|santyclz: N could be considering a x on the empirical unlikelihood of 1 side making 11 tricks on any given hand.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: yes, small diamond was definitely preferable with no entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: agree not the best lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a different auction perhaps top diamond correct|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here next to zero chance north has only 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: true, 11 tricks is a lot|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt shows a very balanced hand for most people so East knows it's overwhelmingly unlikely N-S have 2-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: now declarer can succeed by playing on hearts.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: declarer is likely to put east with a top heart though|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: since otherwise why not a small diamond lead? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: think he will play for @c...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: so he might decide to pin his hopes on the clubs behaving|pg||
nt|viren169: normal to play on clubs and d1|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|pelu: yes - and have to tell "a story" after 2@D - but no system get 100%|pg||
nt|cicus: @D6 was Smith - don't like clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: N considering a @S switch?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt like any switch|pg||
nt|xenya: which might save a trick if S has AK|pg||
nt|xenya: as it is, it gives an overtrick it seems |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: it doesn't hurt to cash some spades and see what they do|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hedyg: impossible to tell that S has 8@D which would maybe ask for @S and 6 asked for @H|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||

nt|mariner1: this can make 5 too|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 6 without a @D lead|pg||
mb|3C!|an|inv with !h|nt|mariner1: 4@H nice, makes 6 with no @D lead..... will get one|pg||
nt|swanson: Slam is worth a shot here - needs a spade finesse or a lucky non-diamond lead (plus a bit more).|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|kareno: 6@h is on the dread finesse - a contract that Benito Garozzo hates.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|swanson: THe danger is that they will get to slam now - it is quite reasonable.  It gets really good if the defense doesn't lead a diamond.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: 3nt makes by a fluke.|pg||
nt|kareno: And it looks like e/w do not play Smolen, a useful tool for a hand like west's.|pg||
nt|swanson: East likes his tricks here.  Maybe 6@H is the right bid now.|pg||
nt|mariner1: if they bid slam anyone want to bet on @D lead? :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, west has one too many spades for Smolen :)|pg||
nt|swanson: Smolen is a transfer after Stayman.  Usually 5-4 in majors, but it can be 6-4.|pg||
nt|kareno: Ahh, good information for me, John.  I thought it had to be 5-4.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|swanson: Cheek  - Grue seem to have some useful conventions but they don't seem to be getting the max from them.|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: EW have had a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: west thought 3@C showed @C|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kareno: Well, they stopped nicely in four and that will be a push.|pg||
nt|swanson: Looking at the West hand it appears than 4@D was a splinter - but then why would East bid more?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: I lost connect,, so an imp up for grabs here|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|swanson: West will cash the spade ace, then enter dummy and lead to the Q, making just 10 tricks.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|swanson: Declarer should cash the @SA then lead towards the @SQ.|pg||

nt|cicus: chance for a swing hewre|pg||
nt|viren169: slam hand... off to the races here|pg||
nt|athene: north hand is hard to express in most systems|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: but when a side actually bids 5 of something that might change the a priori odds somewhat|pg||
nt|athene: however little respect you have for their bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: both ways perhaps|pg||
nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: too good for weak 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|athene: 2@S might show a weak 2-suiter but this might lose the important sixth spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 2 @s is @s and a minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well that simplifies things, matos will ace ask|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure S with still push to the 5 level...|pg||
nt|viren169: great...|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't have a bid, really|pg||
nt|athene: so he will choose between double and 1@S i guess :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps MacskÃ¡sy could have bid 5@H en route rather than punt 6@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW bidding @Hs helps S|pg||
nt|cicus: after 2@H here @CQ is a favourite to score|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It did not in the CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: careful pass by W|pg||
nt|xenya: but you don't really bid grand missing the trump Q?|pg||
nt|cicus: no but if the auction is crowded you can't pay attentiom to nuances|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Vladimir, but N could have had it but with no chance to raise when partner jumps to 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS not a regular partnership, is 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|xenya: true, Roland|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S is forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: without agreements 2@S is surely forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a method for showing this hand after 2@S opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|pelu: diff bid in N - has to bid 3@C - but pd will take is as a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need an agreement if it's not|pg||
nt|viren169: now 6 will be easy when (if) diamonds is found as second suit|pg||
nt|athene: now south has to do something|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south assumes he is facing only five spades, so will probably ask for the @SQ |pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like S is just going to bash it out...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes 4nt aces for @s and 5 @h asks @s Q|pg||
nt|santyclz: Make a @s a @h and he has a textbook Bramley x.|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|pelu: 3@H by S|pg||
nt|hedyg: time to cuebid|pg||
nt|hedyg: prefer 3@H|pg||
nt|cicus: is this not risky?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C won't lead anywhere|pg||
nt|cicus: I mean 4@C|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure 3@H agrees clubs|pg||
nt|cicus: Szalay will convert to 4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c normally orkc...|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@D from N (reverse) sh promise 1 bid more|pg||
nt|athene: does that get him into a Bramley Jam?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|hedyg: but in this sequence..|pg||
nt|cicus: ORKC idf forcing...|pg||
nt|xenya: hope they know what they are doing...|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S reached in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with the @SQ and nothing else, north would just bid 6@S, so 6@H shows extras|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|pelu: a jump to 6@C (in my system) = 2 Aces plus a void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know what ORKC is, but you had better explain. Many in the audience don't know I'm sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: orkc= option roman keycard|pg||
nt|cicus: Optional Roman Key.Card asking for aces|pg||
nt|cicus: optional, because it also asks about strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT....|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: 1st step agrees to slam, if other bid than 1st step then dont want slam but show number of keycards|pg||
nt|cicus: 1st step usually weak hand and other responses show aces|pg||
nt|pelu: on 4Nt I jump in the void-suit if lover that trumfp - and jump to 6 in your suit if higher|pg||
nt|viren169: whay 6@H and not 6@C?|pg||
nt|athene: but south, not being able to see all the hands and knowing there's a keycard missing, has no grand slam ambitions|pg||
nt|athene: south can't have been happy about passing throughout|pg||
nt|athene: but he didn't have any convenient bid|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|athene: perhaps north is worried that 6@C might be taken as his second suit|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: i would probably risk 3@D over 2@S|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Sousa Guedes won the round Robein|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Robin|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cicus: maybe Hedy's version is more popular|pg||
nt|athene: showing extra length/strength there|pg||
nt|viren169: North passed at the other table, and drove to slame via RKCB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps 6 of a minor would offer a choice of slams|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: time to claim|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzkc: they all play pretty natural in this room|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: well NS could get too high here.......|pg||
nt|swanson: Easy grand here - just a question of how many bids it will take to get there.|pg||
nt|rogerclee: maybe i'm stupid, i didn't want to do that to john and leo|pg||
nt|rogerclee: sorry, private|pg||
nt|mariner1: 13+ tricks IF @c run|pg||
nt|swanson: THis is an excellent 7NT and should make despite the awful club split.|pg||
nt|mariner1: this one has chance for NS,,,,,, 7 on a squeeze|pg||
mb|2N|nt|swanson: After West shows with long clubs, declarer will finesse spades the winning way.|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, let's watch the auction first - this pair spends hours daily discussing the finer points of their system.|pg||
nt|kareno: I sat near them on a long plane ride to California once and they were doing just that the whole trip.|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers suggesting that results on board 1 will encourage them to bid the grand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: we can see @c do not co-perate,,,,, saving grace is all have the same breaks|pg||
nt|swanson: Has a shot even with the awful club break.  Spade finesse the winning way seems logical after the club break is discovered.|pg||
mb|5N|an|pick a slam|nt|kareno: If they can avoid playing in 7@c they will do fine.|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: 5NT is forcing|pg||
nt|mariner1: choice of slams or request for 7?|pg||
nt|swanson: It's not clear to me what North intends to discover with the call.|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems asking for 7 to me...... not sure either|pg||
mb|6N|nt|swanson: Declarer took only 12 tricks at the other table because he claimed 13 when dummy came down and wasn't allowed to finesse.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: It is usually choice of slam.|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers who know NS say 5N is pick a slam|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|swanson: But not a grand invitation (unless possibly North pulls a 6@C call to 6NT).|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugrapha1: he's claimed 13|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: now learns that @C dont break|pg||
nt|mariner1: good point John, could easily have carried the dual meaning|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: players discussing if there is a show up double squeeze|pg||
nt|swanson: North will be pleased to find clubs 5-1 but I still think his team will be in danger of losing to a grand at the other table.|pg||
mc|12|nt|vugrapha1: 12 tricks agreed|pg||
nt|swanson: The black suit stoppers were in the wrong hands for a squeeze to operate.|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: i would certainly bid 2@S with west's hand over 1@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nobody seems to assume x's are penalty any more.|pg||
nt|athene: it worries opps when you bid their suits|pg||
nt|athene: and it usually works out just fine|pg||
nt|athene: as long as you have a decent suit|pg||
mb|3C!|an|3 way bid|nt|athene: in theory south has more room now but that might not be a bonus if he hasn't discussed these sequences|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: X for penalty, but I dont exp that S will accept - 4@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H problematic here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Budapest a great city. Buda on one side, Pest on the other side of the river Donau|pg||
nt|cicus: or vice versa|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt keeps things simple|pg||
nt|athene: south has a stopper in the unbid suit|pg||
nt|athene: but it's one of the BID suits which will be the problem|pg||
mb|3D!|an|relay|nt|vugraphzkc: and now what?|pg||

nt|santyclz: Marrku.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 1 @s is 0-4 @s forcing one round|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or else a great vul vs not psyche.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@SX in CR, E overcalled...2@s|pg||
nt|athene: when you have one suit with an ace and one without, it's normal to lead the non-ace suit, but it's also normal to prefer a 5-card suit, so east had a close decision there i think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond shift now|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... I would have lead a @S... |pg||

pc|sT|nt|pelu: best now is @HA and @H 2, but a ruffing finess in @C will bring 5@H home|pg||

nt|santyclz: He would have 10 tricks, but ...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: 4@H would be interesting - the trick is to draw trumps and keep control of clubs|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure if it would make in practice on a club lead|pg||

mb|d|mb|3H|nt|kareno: Won't be bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: The notrump range is 14-16 so there was no way South would even try.|pg||
nt|mariner1: will the 2@D DBL help in some way|pg||
nt|frankaus: 21S ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Minimum doesn't begin to describe the weakness of the South hand.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|mariner1: well he was in his 3 - 7 range :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Sweden 17-5 vs. Bridge Norge (5 boards)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am told 2 of Major is 8 - 11|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kareno: West has now shown spades and diamonds, competing for a partscore.  And pushes n/s to 3 (but never 4) hearts.|pg||
nt|swanson: Enterprising bidding by West and, I think well justified on the auction.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|kareno: North did show three hearts.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|swanson: Seems like they should beef it up to 4-8 vulnerable.|pg||
nt|swanson: South doesn't get in to lead a club through, so there is no way to defeat this contract.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kareno: This is a good example for the specs of how experts fight for partscores.  |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kareno: In short matches they may not make the difference but in long matches, the team that has the better of the part scores generally will win.  They add up surprisingly quickly.|pg||

nt|athene: diamond guess to make 6@S here|pg||
nt|athene: east might lead the @DA though if north doesn't show the suit|pg||
nt|viren169: better than a guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 1@H-1NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if Szalay passes|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H 1@S 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: now west might just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: with 7 running tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I guess a discussion is taking place right now|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzkc: N/S might be in trouble here|pg||
nt|santyclz: The usual Ghestem result.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Pass before the x'ing starts.|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, EW have some points and fit, but not much anything makes, not even stop on a dime 2@H in open room|pg||
nt|athene: the auction is likely to start 1@C 1@S (2@H) X support and north can conceal the diamond side-suit|pg||
mb|2D!|an|tfer to !h|nt|cicus: E does not want to pass nor does he want to encourage, goes the middle road|pg||
nt|pelu: why 1NT????? - do they play 1@S/1NT reversed?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s was an option as well?|pg||
nt|pelu: the middle road ? 1Nt = no road :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, they play 1NT f1 and he doesnt want to show @s, just a weak @H fit|pg||
nt|xenya: i would have seriously considered a pass as E|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6 losers, 2@d is enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: x means 3 @s support|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: perhaps exclusion now|pg||
mb|2H!|an|3+ !h|mb|p|nt|athene: facing two non-heart keycards you are happy to have a shot at 7@S|pg||
nt|athene: exclusion keycard is usually a jump to something above 4nt|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting lead coming up for East...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: here, N-S have the room to employ it at a lower level - IF they have agree this sort of thing|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: *agreed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H splinter for me, but can continue with 5@H void|pg||
nt|athene: this is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north wins @SK and switches to a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: east has to duck but now south can switch back to a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: playing artificial reverses?|pg||
nt|othered1: this can be a very large swing 12 imps or more.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: seems good lead by W (for them...)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cicus: 2@S prpbably game forcing without spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i don't think this auction is really getting to grips with the hand|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we know what 4@S showed?|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence come to diamond, 2 clubs, and 2 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2@S must be artificial game force?|pg||
nt|cicus: not sure about that|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cicus: one of my advisors says it is 17-18 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was just natural i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S was signoff, i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: he assumed 4@H was a splinter, either singleton or void|pg||
nt|viren169: I think N is living dangerously!|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't have anything|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: abot what W actually has|pg||
pc|hT|nt|santyclz: N didn't keep a low @d?|pg||
nt|viren169: .either red suit will allow Declarer to claim quickly|pg||
nt|athene: north would have been better-off just bidding 5@H over 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart lead 12 with no guess|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I agree|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have heart void, great hand, but neither minor-suit ace"|pg||
nt|athene: and hence must have solid trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: they got it there anyway ...|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|cicus: but then I can't understand 3@D - why not pass 2NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so E could have pulled the brakes in 3@H|pg||
nt|viren169: anyone for stone age 2@S over 1@C?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|xenya: unfortunately this should go 2 off|pg||
nt|athene: east did well to lead a trump, i think|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to just hope his partner has the @DA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzkc: yes sry|pg||
nt|athene: he knows a heart lead might well give declarer a free @HAQ finesse|pg||
nt|athene: (west didn't double 5@H to show an honour, and north is void)|pg||
nt|athene: and if north is void in hearts he has length in one or other minor so a minor-suit lead could solve his side-suit problems|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is a 2@S bid, will wait awhile to use that bid again|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer should get it right in the end... considering East bid 2@H |pg||
nt|athene: i don't mind a strong jump shift response with north's hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C - 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes. Declarer as to guess but he will|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't supposed to use the bid on a 2-suiter but north can happily just treat that hand as a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|athene: but probably they don't play strong jump shifts - no-one seems to, these days|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... bets to treat it as single (solid) suiter|pg||
nt|viren169: works v nicely on this hand!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Neves is thinking|pg||
nt|viren169: also 6@S in the open room... but A@D lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: ok mhere we go|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cT|pc|h2|pg||

nt|viren169: and I can feel Lencastre smiling!|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: and ducks, giving declarer the @SQ for the 9th trick|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|viren169: especially as he had no opposition bidding!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: hoping for miracle @HK coming down, then there's no need for the guess|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cK|pg||

nt|santyclz: No problem.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|cicus: over 1@H|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|swanson: This hand does show the advantage of getting the partner of the weak 2-bidder as declarer.  But wouldn't that be more likely to be important on game going hands (when the opening ...|pg||

nt|swanson: West might have chosen 1NT (as a passed hand) for takeout rather than double.  And it had caused his partner to take a losing agressive view.|pg||
