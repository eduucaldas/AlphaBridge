nt|lestergold: club trial bid of some sort?|pg||
nt|royhughes: In my old 'Goren' book the bid was 1@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed but those days are over i fear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even older ACOL books opened 1C|pg||
nt|royhughes: South has wonderful clubs opposite length, but bad trumps and possibly wasted heart strength|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed u are right and i was brougt up on those books |pg||
nt|ahollan1: in examing convention cards for players in this event - and from Beijing, i actually am seeing some [non-north american] pairs go back to 1@C with SOME 5@S&5@C hands|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard not to bid game on these cards|pg||
nt|royhughes: Is it safe to say that the commentating staff is considerably older than the players?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: probably on average because commentators are people who have spare time like the retired or semi reired|pg||
nt|Walddk3: R3: Australia Youth v Bridge i Norge and New Zealand v India National|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Maybe 3@h was a return try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: certainly players using relays - and transfers over 1@C - are better able show different 55 ranges|pg||
nt|royhughes: This looks like sensible bidding to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they have managed to stop short and need to play carefully to make three|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, I think making 3 will be a challenge|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: i see 4 is two off in close|pg||
nt|royhughes: EW can beat 3 by force on a club lead, I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: easier to make 9 tricks in 3s than 9 tricks in 4 spades|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|royhughes: and maybe on any lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: win play trumps quickly give two up|pg||
nt|royhughes: West can hop up on a spade and score the 9 overruffing dummy in clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for realtime running totals -- scope out http://tinyurl.com/yeh-2009-running-score|pg||
nt|royhughes: If declarer plays trumps from hand maybe he gets forced in diamonds and shut out of long club|pg||
nt|royhughes: but it's too tough for me to figure out|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes as long as north plays safely to make 3h tricks 3 spade tricks 2 clubns and a diamond now should make|pg||
nt|royhughes: That's probably right|pg||
nt|lestergold: match points this would be a tuffie|pg||

nt|ahollan1: wow - an 11 card fit opposite a 12 card fit|pg||
mb|2H|mb|4C!|nt|lestergold: jump fit from west|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C = fit showing   @S support + source of tricks in @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course its e/w hand but north wont sell out cheaply|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 11 card fit takes more tricks than the 12 bagger -- just coincidence that it is @S|pg||

nt|lestergold: 6h too expensive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially if Fu takes the push to 6@S [and guesses @C correctly]|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho may save a trick if he can eliminate and endplay east|pg||
nt|lestergold: guessing that club al will be impressive i wouldnt want to be on that rack!|pg||

mb|6H|mb|d|nt|lestergold: yep 6h doubled likely conceded 800|pg||

nt|santyclz: No problem, for some reason the players frequently seem to have other things on their minds than ensuring the vg oper can see all their plays.|pg||

mc|11|nt|robinswr: he can make it if north has a singleton honor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: It may seem odd that N did not try to cash heart with only stiuff in dummy. N is reasoning that: (a) EW would not bid a slam off 2 aces, and (b) S would have led hearts unless he ...|pg||
