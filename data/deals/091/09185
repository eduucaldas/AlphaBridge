nt|lestergold: a thinish 4 spades availble here for N/S|pg||
nt|stewball: lots of chances|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard work with the r4/1 break|pg||
nt|dburn: sporting weak two bid at the other table, but North-South dealt with it easily enough|pg||
nt|drg: KQ@H doubleton helps a bit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C a fine spot although 3NT also makes on this layout|pg||
nt|jwit: I have never played bridge with Fredin, but did have the pleasure of playing golf with him.  For somebody who doesn't get out on the golf course very often, he is a terrific ...|pg||
nt|jwit: golfer.|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure seems like 4@H has play here......|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@S was a brave move by Ólafur in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: should be worth a few imps to e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c or indeed 3N on for NS|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lestergold: those heart pips in fredin's hand work quite hard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The N-S heart spots are just good enough to stop the suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps one should open 2@S instead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Like here|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially with a passed partner|pg||
mb|5C|nt|robbg: This 1@s overcall I don't understand at all! (I like the other one better!)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: however maybe 2@s would show a 2suiter in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: was 2nd best     suppose they play attitude|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 3NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: North will make sure they get to 4@H (at least) now.|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|jwit: This could be a nice swing for NS.  Heart to 10 now and will do quite well.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jwit: Although he isn't crazy about his spade holding on the auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: declarer finessed for the Q@H in Closed and went off|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Oh my|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     can make 9 tricks in spades  with fortunate lie of the black soft cards|pg||
nt|thegarve: If the hand was pure - opening 2@s is not a good idea -  2@S is ideal here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What does 2NT show since Ingimundur drove all the way to game|pg||
nt|drg: may well need to guess clubs if west can hold up the ace on the first round|pg||
nt|robbg: The 1@s overcall might have that effect.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: very optimistic by east on those values|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2NT would have been down too |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It most likely would|pg||
nt|hedyg: no direct entry to dummy for any finesse|pg||
nt|ady: I cant see that is a reason for east to bid  anything|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has played before that man|pg||
nt|dburn: here, though, North has done pretty well to respond to 1NT at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: superfially only three losers but ten winners are not that obvious|pg||
nt|stewball: i dont think its 100% to bid with that N hand n/v|pg||
nt|daman: Jon would have bid 3NT     Bob Hamman as well|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers suggesting 3N|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is not unreasonable when there is at least a three-card difference in the spade length.|pg||
nt|jwit: Kendrick can't afford to duck this.  He needs to give declarer an entry to dummy.|pg||
nt|jwit: Entry to hand I meant|pg||
nt|robbg: Won't be useful unless he wins and switches, unless Schifko is partial to a 1st round finesse.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree i tend to pass a 15-17 nt with a poor 8 count|pg||
nt|lestergold: trump lead best here|pg||
nt|drg: reasonable to take a call holding spades and a couple of tens|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brgpro: 5@h was lucky to make because the @h10 drops doubleton|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you know tarzan this can be fun but there are not many (rob helle for example does)|pg||
nt|brgpro: and, @dA was with doubleton|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - to make 5 @H need Ax in @D and 10x in @H|pg||
nt|brgpro: Axx was ok with 3 trumps, but the doubleton must be 10x|pg||
nt|bobholl: they will reach 4@H i 'm sure|pg||
nt|bridge_one: or Axx in @D with xxx in @H in the same hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: of cours in practice 3N makes ten tricks|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: @SQ at trick 1 was obviously the only realistic chance|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: the heart position is very friendly indeed |pg||
nt|lestergold: what?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, it's very unsual to pull from game to a partscore|pg||
nt|daman: really weird|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Fredin fearing three small hearts opposite I suppose|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt know that at this level you can come out of an undoubled game into a pat score|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobholl: no 1 @C is 16+ 1@D 8-(i guess)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this kind of auction can do many IMP in long distance|pg||
nt|hedyg: are we sure 3@c is a stayman?|pg||
nt|daman: hard to believe that could happen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to David Burn|pg||
nt|dburn: hello|pg||
nt|daman: Hi David|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: what would he do if W did not have 4@Hs?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: might gain though as n/s +140     should only go down2|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Disa passed twice on the last board with 16 Miltons - she isn't the sort to pass four times running|pg||
nt|mariner1: pretty straight forward line needed...... and she is using it|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|c6|nt|dburn: the trouble is that, not knowing she can use a heart to pitch a diamond, she may try to establish a diamond to pitch a heart|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: I aassume would have had to go to 3NT   unless they had an arrangement that 3@C  was some soret of bail out of 2NT and west forgot|pg||
nt|jwit: Nevertheless by ducking, forced declarer to go right in trumps|pg||
nt|robbg: Schifko was less impressed with the 1@s overcall here.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jwit: So should be 5 imps to NS|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: oh not the most succesful shot|pg||
nt|dburn: ...she may play a low diamond to the eight|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not clear that West should simply play spades. He might perhaps have used the fact that he was on lead to play one of the minor suits through. Not that it would be productive.|pg||
nt|bobh1: the last 2 hands illustrate that 1n is the most difficult contract to defend|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|hedyg: that is why i think maybe 3@c was not a stayman, how can he go to 3NT with that hand?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: now she definitely needs the heart for the dim but another trump lead wont help her|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly not a ridiculous line, but unsuccessful on this occasion|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
mc|11|nt|brgpro: yesssssssssssss. how is willam? what does he do nowadays?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3744  Erik Sælensminde (known as "Silla" among friends)|pg||
nt|bobh1: best defense beats both|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think the ten of diamonds was a better shot in that suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: i hope im not being a results merchant|pg||
nt|drg: certainly works with the K9 doubleton|pg||
nt|lestergold: Fredin needs to learn to upgrade the powerful 876 sequence!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When did you last see that, David? Pulling from 3NT (undoubled) to 4@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi David u up early for a Sunday|pg||
nt|jwit: EW got awfully high on this one in the closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Declarer can pick up the clubs without a ruff.|pg||
nt|ady: 4S  for n/s|pg||
nt|drg: since west cannot afford to cover|pg||
nt|dburn: somewhat vexing for West at the other table to discover that leading from KQ in his partner's weak two bid allowed the contract to make|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hedyg: multi 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: only a part score hand    but the other room did not think so|pg||
nt|thegarve: the weak two classically pushed the opens to stretch , first with 2NT then 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s or 1@c?|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, but EW have a good save at 5 diamonds even with the bad trump break|pg||
nt|mariner1: tartan showing 5M and 4+ minor less than opening count|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thats one ofthe penalties of bidding with garbage|pg||
nt|stewball: sometimes called suicide 2 bids|pg||
nt|lestergold: the trump attack here was excellent|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that the heart game was made at every table but 1.|pg||
nt|jwit: I would pass over 1NT with the West hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: it is a style issue|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed it is|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D  a save for e/w|pg||
nt|brolucius: But he does not know that, so if the defenders cash their hearts (which they will) he may begin with two rounds of trumps followed by two rounds of clubs.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Muiderberg is very similar to Tartan|pg||
nt|mariner1: 17opposite a weak 8 here.....|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: without itmost linbes would have suceeded|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://icelandairopen.com/index.php?m=D3&id=M_OPENTEAMS2009&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2009  for leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: 2@D Multi, weak with one major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the garbage type|pg||
nt|bobh1: N has something in reserve for his 2@s bid|pg||
nt|dburn: didn't really see the auction - maybe it was supposed to be forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You saw the constructive weak 2 before|pg||
nt|drg: not much hope except for divining the spade position|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I would too,,,, looks more like 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 1@S and all pass|pg||
nt|jwit: Rather aggressive 4D bid by South|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has nothing in reserve for his 4@D bid.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bridge_one: i don't agree the pass by south with 12 hcp and good figures|pg||
nt|robbg: A kibitzer asks why the duck at trick 1... It is often good technique to foil what declarer is trying to do. Here Schifko, basically known to hold Qx in @s was trying to force an ...|pg||
nt|robbg: entry to his hand, so Kendrick naturally (and unfortunately) refused to accomodate.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: nice swing for n/s here|pg||
nt|bobh1: can N stnd it?|pg||
nt|hedyg: not at all interested in A@D in pds hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has denied a heart control, on the face of it, so North should not advance.|pg||
nt|hedyg: and no 4@H bid|pg||
nt|jwit: If 4D was a stiff rather than a void, North has a powerhouse of a hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: i thing maybe he should have bid 2n or something to show a 3-card limit raise to begin with|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brgpro: send my greetings to him|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: lol|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult when playing precision like with 13-15 NT|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would open the south hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: without an  impossible double dummy spade view this looks unmanageable|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ady: now too high     |pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@C should show a @H stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The double of 4@D must encourage a sacrifice because he will be on lead himself|pg||
nt|bobh1: altho 4 by 3 his hand is prime|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to blame North, though, with that massive hand (for a single raise) opposite a slam try. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 4@D overbid caused this|pg||
nt|bobh1: i blame him for making only a single raise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't|pg||
nt|ady: I think 4@D  looking for a slam optimistic  opposite a 2@S raise|pg||
nt|jwit: I agree David, especially if 4D was a singleton.  Obviously, not nearly as good opposite a void|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@C?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I blame 4@D, that is a wild overbid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes|pg||
nt|jwit: Agree totally Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The auction is in MOVIE|pg||
nt|robbg: This contract at least has a bit of play, but not on today's distribution.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mariner1: however they might hooks @S to make it........|pg||
nt|drg: can get 8 tricks for a push though|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: E had a chance to switch to @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: Fredin reasoning that S must have trumps and he has 3 tricks in hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: a hard work contract here|pg||
nt|dburn: I imagine it was intended as forcing, but it was a rather odd thing to do|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, an excellent double.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|brgpro: but they play 12-15NT, so he will have to open 1NT and he is lack of controls|pg||
nt|bridge_one: QJ9  Q9xx A10x QJ10   medium cards  in all suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can make such doubles only when the auction makes it clear that the other side have limited values. If West had rebid 4@S, you might be more circumspect.|pg||
nt|jwit: Best defense might beat this 3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brolucius: An awful sequence.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jwit: Good point David|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|hedyg: so did W.........|pg||
nt|hedyg: did he really duck the Q@H?|pg||
nt|jwit: From North's point of view, partner could easily have something like  AKJxxx  Ax x KQJx.  Surely that wouldn't be asking for too much for a 4D bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: much too much work to do with the hearts being established next time opps are in|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably get home by way of 4hearts two dims 2 clubs and a ruff in the short heart hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: however 2s was due for a few off|pg||
nt|daman: yes    should reel this one in|pg||
pc|cK|nt|drg: actually, a club up now and then diamonds|pg||
nt|drg: the minors lay very friendly|pg||
nt|dburn: this is cold, isn't it?|pg||
nt|drg: south can't afford to rise because of the Qx@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: another @S pressures S|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: this looks like a lucky position indeed|pg||
nt|drg: not cold anymore|pg||
nt|dburn: that may not have been best, though|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he finds it |pg||
nt|lestergold: but not much else to try|pg||
nt|drg: it was his only legit shot|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: How you can envisage slam with that hand opposite a single raise is simply unbelievable|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer needed to pitch a club and keep that diamond|pg||
pc|c7|nt|brgpro: this defence wont hurt|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bobholl: claim for 3 made|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobh1: change N's heart and diamond holdings and you are getting there|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, 6@C was not the best. He must have said to himself: 'I denied a heart control, so partner must have one.' |pg||
nt|bobh1: good reasonin|pg||
nt|bobh1: g|pg||
nt|hedyg: imo 5@C MUST be @H control|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he didnt keep his dim|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jwit: Defense has extracted full juice here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: with*|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|lestergold: in practice two ruffs in the short trump hand and 3 trumps in the dummy|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bobh1: as good as N's hand was he had a pass over 4@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is difficult for North, who presumably knows that his partner's bidding may not be classical.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it  wont make very often|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mariner1: if this makes 4 the DBL costs 2 imps,,, if set one it gains 1 imp... the payoff is -300|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mariner1: or -500 which are 5 and 7 imp gains|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: south should just have bid 4@s   and reckon sometimes even that might be too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: so now off 2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: no a wheel came off|pg||
nt|jwit: Will actually be 800 now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: The point that Jon and Rob made earlier (that West - with a QJ bare and a Q-x-x - was not worth a game try) has been proved to be a good one. |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|jwit: I agree David|pg||
nt|lestergold: now 2 off for a small gain |pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: you think S would not show @H control over XX if he had it?|pg||

nt|bobh1: he has to . . . otherwise cue-bidding serves no purpose|pg||
nt|jwit: I don't blame North for bidding over 4S.  There are just too many hands partner could have for a 4D bid, that slam will be cold|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if he can bid 4@D with that hand, he might also bypass a heart cue next because he overbid|pg||
nt|brolucius: The correct way to play the clubs is king and then the ace, exposing the need for a finesse when West has a singleton honour.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|drg: E/W seem to have overbid a bit in the other room here|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North had been too unaware to find the double, it would have been only 2 IMPs.|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 1Nt = controls ?|pg||

nt|drg: I agree|pg||
nt|stewball: I've never seen much point in opening Jxxxx in a balanced 9 count in 3rd chair|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: West hopes that his diamond tolerance will see him through if East doesn't have spade support|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: An off-shape 1NT by South bought it in the closed room|pg||
nt|daman: I wonder if EW can buy this in a @S partscore?|pg||

nt|dburn: but if partner is in the habit of overcalling 2@d on this kind of thing, that's a risky strategy|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is becoming ugly|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S might not get DBL'd|pg||

pc|c5|nt|bobh1: he should be able to hold this to -500, no great disaster|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://icelandairopen.com/index.php?m=D3&id=M_OPENTEAMS2009&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2009  for leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the bid removes very little space. Nothing much going for it.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i would not dream of overcalling at the two level vulnerable with k empty to 5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brgpro: telling u guys a secret, i dont like to play against de wijs muller....they are too fast for me|pg||
nt|ady: might make an overtrick |pg||
nt|dburn: I imagine South will double it, if it gets bid|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: need to play 9@H  for best result|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont see how 9@H can cost|pg||
nt|ady: can still make 10 tricks on the spade lay|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bridge_one: N/S are playing  TARZAN PRECISION (note by a kibitz) - played also by jansma/verhees |pg||
nt|drg: double based on the sound of the auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: im a beliebver in good suits for this bid never mind the point couint|pg||
nt|drg: west shown weakness and east doesn't have spade support|pg||
nt|dburn: still, declarer may escape for down one|pg||
nt|lestergold: but they cant double|pg||
nt|robbg: Now a @d underlead is necessary|pg||
nt|brolucius: A kibitzer suggests that 4@H might make. So, an inexperienced player who doubled on the East hand and found his partner jumping to 4@H might have been rewarded.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|stewball: i wonder why S dbld 4@s but not 3nt|pg||
nt|drg: seems the most likely result|pg||
nt|mariner1: there is a "SLIM" chance of making...........|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the root of the eveil was that oveercall- when 1nt just about expresses the hand|pg||
nt|dburn: North-South may not realise, on this bidding, that they should be attacking diamonds of all things|pg||
nt|mariner1: the small @H probably ends it though|pg||
nt|lestergold: i c that they got away with a making nt in the closed room|pg||
pc|s6|pc|cT|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 500     a small loss for e/w|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, @H10 was an unlucky lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzgq: Don't be too sarcastic Jack :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: jansma verhees play more like polish :) not tarzan .|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 800|pg||
nt|jwit: Might hold it to 500 Roland.  Might get to ruff a heart in hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think their diamonds will run away|pg||
nt|lestergold: must lose 2h dim and 2 spades|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dburn: of course they will - West has a pitch on a heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: ??|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c back tests declarer|pg||
nt|drg: south doesn't have an easy play to trick 2 after the duck|pg||
nt|mariner1: not my lead back though'|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a club might run away now|pg||
nt|drg: and the ruffing heart finesse along the way to deal with a diamond|pg||
nt|drg: ruff the other club|pg||
nt|mariner1: true S has no great return to be honest|pg||
nt|drg: and 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobholl: good lead when strong hand in S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, but in TARZAN can find also sequence by jansma/verhees |pg||
nt|drg: when spades break and A@D onside along with the K@C|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: How will you score @D6?|pg||
nt|jwit: Or a club|pg||
nt|ady: now might be more    should have played a c lub before the diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: might as well put the queen on it - can't really help to duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: chance for west to steal a horrible contract but missed it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: would have to guess the heart position though in South wins first sspade and plays a 2nd heart|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brgpro: claim and NEXT|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: need a @c back now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it's 500 again, Hauge should have won|pg||
nt|ady: play a clun immediately    then make the low trump by ruffing a club|pg||
nt|drg: ducking gives no hope|pg||
nt|stewball: to say nothing of it being pointless|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: now an easy 10|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: How do you get to dummy to ruff a club?|pg||
nt|lestergold: ducking seemed misere|pg||
nt|lestergold: and need to be allowed to ruff 4th heart in dummy but hes drawing trumops so likely 2 off|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: once we played muller 4boards in 22  minutes almost a record :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: with a ladder|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: I don't understand this line at all|pg||
nt|mariner1: counting your losers leads to playing the Q@C, only way to remove a loser is if it wins|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the dims have not run away surprisingly enuf!|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|daman: @H|pg||

nt|jwit: It will be hard for defense not to give declarer a heart ruff or club ruff or set up a spade trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but they can manage|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's probably worth looking at that one again, with DF or GIB, to see how the defenders can force 800.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2 IMPs is a cheap price for what seemed to be a very dubious 3@D from East.|pg||

nt|mariner1: http://icelandairopen.com/index.php?m=D3&id=M_OPENTEAMS2009&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2009|pg||
nt|mariner1: for leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|drg: an odd push|pg||
nt|lestergold: card play by west on  this one below par|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N certainly has play here.........|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4 being played in the closed room. West is in 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After North showed 5-5 in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N might be better than 4@H here,,,, though 4@H has play|pg||
mb|1H|nt|thegarve: Forget honour cards, its 9s that count|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: sometimes :)|pg||
nt|thegarve: might buy it in 3@c|pg||
nt|dburn: the same might be said of East at the other table on this one - how do you go down in 3NT?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4S a reasonable conmtract to reach unfortunat lie of cards|pg||
nt|jwit: 4H most likely contract.  Should fail|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: many would make that bid  |pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobh1: dont see this as a weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|jwit: This board rates to be a push|pg||
nt|mariner1: hard to dbl hook @H twice|pg||
nt|lestergold: over ruffs abound|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H is a sound spade raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: pass?|pg||
nt|lestergold: with the favourable lie of the hearts it is difficult to see|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 23 pt 3N in other room   may well fail   even on a club lead through difficult communication    would need to play a low diamond from hand |pg||
nt|thegarve: Pass was clearcut|pg||
nt|drg: play for A@S onside instead of J@H?|pg||
nt|drg: this auction doesn't seem possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is this?|pg||
nt|mariner1: one way to avoid 3N :)|pg||
nt|dburn: this may or may not be a strong club based auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: playing precision so at most 15 in E|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobh1: isnt it NS's hand in @s's?|pg||
nt|jwit: Don't think they will be able to compete high enough Bob|pg||
nt|bobh1: double now|pg||
nt|stewball: according to the play record N pitched down to dbl KJ@h |pg||
nt|stewball: and then the record stops|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well it will ceertainly gain imps today!|pg||
nt|jwit: Don't like that double at all with subminimum values, length in opponents suit, and shortness in partner's suit.|pg||
nt|robbg: Which top honor? Schifko was on a different page or improvising.|pg||
nt|mariner1: and a very weak @S suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North was close to 1NT over the double. That would have allowed South to bid 2@S.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hedyg: 3 level t/o doubles are not 7 HCPs, partner should have 10+ so pass looked fine|pg||
nt|ady: dangerous 3@C bid vuln|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps, but there seems to be some doubt as to the actual result at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: will he guess this|pg||
nt|lestergold: i doubt it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jón will never guess it|pg||
mb|p|nt|robbg: I don't like the neg x either but find it less odious than the 1@s overcalls we have seen.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would not double either, but many players seem to like to show the spades when they hold them (as we have already seen in this set).|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes J is not usually considered a top honor........|pg||
mb|3S|nt|daman: quite a lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: hes short of side suit tricks sohe has to play with the odds|pg||
nt|jwit: Great conservative judgement by Schifko, at least on this actual hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that 3NT has been bid three times and always made. Everyone has failed who bid the heart game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: the other doubleton best lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: duck...................|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Expected the unexpected from Fredin|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lestergold: hes going to lose a heart two dims and at least one overruff surelt|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i see it made in t'other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Made in the other room on @HK lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah|pg||
nt|lestergold: on eup for Fredin he needs one this session|pg||
nt|lestergold: one up i mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: On a very sunny day N-S might make 4@S.|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he takes the double hook now, 11 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thos contract aint easy double dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: S might have rebid 2@D to show more|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jwit: I agree Rob|pg||
nt|robbg: I think what happened here is that Schifko thought he was showing values with the xx, so he thought 2@h was fully descriptive.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1 reason to duck the lead is not having a good exit card|pg||
nt|hedyg: if S knew that N has the 2 red queens..|pg||
nt|lestergold: send it to darwin David?|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, at double dummy the play is fairly straightforward - declarer can even recover from his misguess at trick one|pg||
nt|dburn: but at the table, I'd be pretty surprised if he makes it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: yes but even in a thunderstorm they will make 3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobholl: east is placed again i think :) but not easy to play|pg||
nt|brolucius: You might redouble and then say 2@H when you held only two hearts. That's the problem.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jwit: Though conservatism was right here as long as they were going to play hearts rather than no trump, and no trump was extremely unlikely on this auction|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: no dbl now|pg||
nt|daman: @C spots are favo(u)rable if he playes it properly|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: well there is a club pin for tyhe double dummy enthusiasts|pg||
nt|lestergold: and carefully draw two rounds of truimps with the ace and queen but surely taht is hugh darwin territory|pg||
nt|dburn: that will not work|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to get back to hand so doesnt work|pg||
nt|dburn: he needs at some point to run both @s10 and @cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: in any case this chicken isnt going to fight for  Jon|pg||
nt|dburn: which is why I will be rather surprised if he makes it|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume this is a serious tank|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he does, he is too good to play against|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although a few BBO'ers would do it in their sleep, sadly|pg||

nt|brolucius: I wonder what an immediate 2@S by South would have meant.|pg||
nt|lestergold: a perfetly reasonable way to playa 1 heart contract|pg||

nt|mariner1: 4@S makes, 5@D makes|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: double?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double is fine if you play ELC|pg||
nt|brolucius: Redouble is normal on the South cards and then West can say 2@S.|pg||
nt|hedyg: double OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Equal Level Conversion|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most of the field played in 4@H. I suppose we should congratulate N-S here for staying low, but I don;t think South quite showed his hand in support of hearts.|pg||
nt|jwit: This should be a flat 4H|pg||
nt|mariner1: possible slam here with no @D lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: not that they should be in slam|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dburn: better play 6@d by East, though|pg||
nt|stewball: chunky prempt|pg||
nt|mariner1: forget 6@D off an entry|pg||
nt|lestergold: he needs enuf entries to ruff out the spade k and enjoy the spades to make 56d playe by East of course |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 1 entry short of 6@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think he has them|pg||
nt|dburn: at this rate, he'll be doing well to get to game|pg||
nt|drg: must be something to 3@S, that can't be a w/r preempt|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: seems to be a forcing NT|pg||
nt|ady: pzrft score again    n/s should make 1NT   but e/w managed to buy the contract in 1NT in other room  a save |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They could well end up in a 4-2 fit here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like double much|pg||
nt|hedyg: W's partners never bid @d on his t/o doubles?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double is a take-out of hearts|pg||
nt|jwit: Double ok if you play same level conversions.  Will actually work well here.|pg||
nt|jwit: Diamond lead stands out however|pg||
mb|2S|nt|thegarve: Double is better against a strong NT than a weak NT base|pg||
nt|ady: aggressive by west  if eastg is going to take out to diamonds with a  weak hand|pg||
nt|ady: east ereally has enough to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: 4@s is a lucky make with no entry in dummy to take the trump finesse and both @h honors on side|pg||
nt|thegarve: some pairs like to defend and take a plus - West on the last hand showed that he preferred to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not promising extras when you pull clubs to diamonds to show S + D|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s= 1NT?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes its a trappy hand David|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he had a clue from the auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: so does not bidding it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this will be bad for e/w  especcially on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|thegarve: the double should help to find a @s lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: what does 3s mean surely notm a standard preempt much too good a hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: West will lead a top spade I suppose|pg||
nt|ady: at what level if there is a 2 or 3@H bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: way too strong for 3@S for me....... W must have seen them before :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4s isthe sensible spot on these cards|pg||
nt|dburn: it is possible that 3@s was part of the system, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: so he did|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzgq: That could prove to be a major swing to 't Onstein, if Muller passes|pg||
nt|brgpro: i remember once in a big tournament in NED. years ago....someone led a trump from xxx when the opps reached 7@s. the book say so what can go wrong? pd had Kx and dummy was void..|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Or not, sorry, thinking error :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: no big deal, 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I was thinking 500+420|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont see how they beat this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe both of you thought East was on lead|pg||
nt|robbg: Schifko has to carry on, I would think.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: Still should apply Ady|pg||
nt|lestergold: a nice easy one for us not much to say infrangible 4S|pg||
nt|daman: this is a piano hand   time to refill my coffee|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South has a huge hand in general, but is worried about the x-x-x in diamonds.|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is a very strong 2@H call,,,,,,|pg||
nt|robbg: I hope I do better with my Super Bowl pick!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now that they have stopped in 3@H it will be good tactics for West to avoid the diamond lead.|pg||
nt|mariner1: and that is?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: Got to be Arizona, since he lives there|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: pick the q for an overtrick|pg||
nt|robbg: I can't conceive of pass with Schifko's hand, given that 2NT is an invitation!|pg||
nt|robbg: Go Cards!|pg||
nt|jwit: I agree with you on not passing Robb, not on Arizona lol|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: north ant givepartner a dim ruff and cash two hearts she  can only do one or the other|pg||
pc|sT|nt|brgpro: what is E thinking about? 5@s?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If West knew that South's 1@S was artificial then perhaps he should have bid 2@S instead of doubling. |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    contract played by west|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: do we know if NS play transfer bids over double?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4 if need be. If partner really bids 4@C over 3@H, he must have some values|pg||

pc|h8|nt|ady: I understand   but they may be in some difficulty at the 4 levedl if west has just got 6 clubs |pg||

nt|hedyg: short discussion?|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe not in Sussex|pg||
nt|hedyg: only when they have the other major and @ds :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: hot tea for me please :)|pg||
nt|dburn: remarkable effort to get to 3NT on these cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart lead on the last hand against a suit contract i cant remember seeing anytghing like it but it sure fmurdered a giant|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brolucius: Is there a Chandlers Ford in Sussex now?|pg||
nt|ady: many would bid 2@S with the west hand   as natural   and double with only 4 spades|pg||
nt|jwit: This board should surely be flat, though they may play 4S making 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, but I don't think they play ELC in Sussex either|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, it is an instructive mistake - to look only at the diamonds when the rest of his hand was shouting 'Bid game!'|pg||
nt|robbg: Of all the unlikely things that happened in 2008, the Cards winning the NFC is possibly the unlikliest!|pg||
nt|mariner1: now a classic 3N NS|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: I know Chandler's Ford is in Hampshire|pg||
nt|lestergold: and even more remarkeable to make it|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzgq: If NS manage to stay out of slam here, the match will be all but sealed|pg||
nt|dburn: and if the sequence in the Open room is correct, the bidding was indeed remarkable|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D showing multi or a weak major|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|brgpro: but the problem is that 6@h doesnt make....|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yup, @DK offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: And the @DT missing :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 5@S |pg||
nt|hedyg: on their way to @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well the more expected contract|pg||
nt|dburn: Grue no doubt in experimental mode having put a cold game on the floor earllier in proceedings|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: Btw, for all those who don't know, there's a screen dividing SW and NE. That forces me to wait for the tray to go through to enter biddings.|pg||
nt|mariner1: so this will be good for Shell since they missed their game EW|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: 1@C strong, 1@D not strong|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: This is the only table of 38 where game was not reached!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|thegarve: West has a 2.5@s rebid|pg||
nt|drg: managed to create his swing|pg||
nt|drg: this time in his favour|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bobh1: wonder how they held 3n to 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Closed played very fast and are finished|pg||
nt|dburn: not to argue with success, but I am not sure of the need for doing that sort of thing - sure, Grue is havign a shocker of a set, but he has team-mates|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jwit: 3NT is actually a superior contract on these cards.  |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2 aces out and @d lead?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: off to the best lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Closed S opened a more reasonable (to me) 1@H on last board|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: will have to guess heart position    |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|hedyg: can make, but likely wont|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|jwit: How did we get past 3NT here?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|brgpro: they play reversed, pass=ask pd to X and X would have asked pd to act|pg||
nt|lestergold: will probably now just make 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless north opens clubs|pg||
nt|robbg: Obviously 2NT was forcing. Not everybody plays it that way. But there is something wrong (IMO) with a system that requires you to get beyond 3NT to describe a balanced 16.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|bobh1: yep that would do it . . . so 4@s is the better contract|pg||
nt|jwit: 4S could be beaten with some outlandish distributions.  Can't touch 3NT with a crowbar|pg||
nt|lestergold: will probably make this by picking the dims up along with favourable position of the heart ace|pg||
nt|mariner1: this one getting away some|pg||
nt|brolucius: North is being very ambitious (to use a polite word) with his 4-3-3-3 shape opposite a weak NT.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|nt|jwit: Agree 100% David|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree he is being polite :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing the weak 1NT, it would go 1NT - 3NT. You would then have more energy left for the play.|pg||
nt|robbg: It seems to me that you should either play a direct 3NT as 16-17 or so, or an inverted raise followed by a jump to 3NT as 16-17.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzgq: Bertens: "Another sad display"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q in @D would be more clear|pg||
nt|thegarve: it is worth discussing whteher to use 2@C as a potential 2.5@s rebid|pg||
nt|ady: about 50-50 Hedy     guess heart will make|pg||
nt|lestergold: well south musnt continue clubs|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: best|pg||
nt|robbg: but they haven't made 4@s yet.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they ended in a tough Moysian Fit|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|s3|nt|hedyg: can guess @s as well|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: yes     as it happens  in 3NT  it must be right to play clubs first as that might bring in enough tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://icelandairopen.com/index.php?m=D3&id=M_OPENTEAMS2009&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2009|pg||
nt|mariner1: for leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|mariner1: and the 4@H was bid on 5 in Closed so the skunk is over|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bobh1: that's true; 4@s is better at mps but 3n at imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Federer-Nadal: 5-7 6-3 6-6 |pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: There you go again; the spectacular|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DQ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many players, probably most, would raise 1NT to 3NT with North's 4-3-3-3 shape. As happened at the other table.|pg||
nt|daman: Go Roger|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It doesn't always work for him|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|brolucius: That's what they would do in Sussex.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|hedyg: no need to guess @H anymore|pg||
nt|brolucius: They seem to have introduced spades only on the 9th bid of the auction. Very strange.|pg||
nt|robbg: No justice on board 4. Fredin took 7 tricks in @h and won 3 IMPS from a counterpart who took 9 tricksin @h!|pg||

nt|hedyg: 10 imps|pg||
nt|thegarve: Ace doubleton leads give a lot of clues|pg||
nt|ady: last hand  heart guess is superior   as if ggetgting it wrong  you can still make if not losing a spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: some have a system where after stayman and a major by pd 3 OM shows fit in a 4 3 3 3 hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: and he can decide|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  better than 3NT    if the A@C and A@H  rerversed and you play clubs first you might go down if clubs dont break|pg||
nt|jwit: I usually raise 1NT to 3NT when I have a flat hand with a lot of secondary cards, but bid Stayman with primaries.  These cards seem a little more prime than secondary, so I don't ...|pg||
nt|jwit: fault Stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: waiting for the board|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Times newspaper reported last week that many local councils were abolishing the apostrophe in street names. They are replacing existing signs with new ones at great expense. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Apparently they abolished such apostrophes in the USA in 1890 (really) and there are only five exceptions there, including Martha's Vineyard.|pg||
nt|jwit: How could West not play the last diamond when in with the club queen?|pg||
nt|mariner1: now the penultimate board of this session|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well evenly divided points a part score battle maybe here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bridge_one: ok|pg||
nt|mariner1: beating 4@H was good here,,,,,,,, @c lead needed|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: 3@H or pass, panel?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Svendsen passed|pg||
nt|ady: that should stir east to a slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: i like 3@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: David Greenwood will approve, but for those of us who understand the apostrophe...|pg||
nt|ady: pass for me|pg||
nt|jwit: I would pass as well with weak suit|pg||
nt|bobh1: not so sure i like 3@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's really strange that apostrophe has no apostrophé|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would pass on the West cards, but it is tempting to bid. They say you should not bid 'weak over weak'.|pg||
nt|hedyg: partner has the right to expect more|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6NT from East?!|pg||
nt|daman: we'll see if EW can stop below game|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzgq: Interesting 3NT with a meager @H stop|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this 3Nt is to play (gambling with K singleton in @h)|pg||
nt|brgpro: ok guys, i am sure we will know muller's decision by tomorrow morning|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Haha, but he has to bring his average speed down, he's played extraordinary fast the first couple of boards.|pg||
nt|drg: another remarkable auction in the other room|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: I dobt it, and you know, sometimes @SK is onside after the opening|pg||
mb|2S!|an|4 spades|nt|Walddk2: *doubt|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to |pg||
nt|daman: put on the brakes|pg||
nt|robbg: Definitely a mental mistake.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: to me voids are values, especially in their known suit|pg||
nt|jwit: 3H vulnerable is asking for trouble in my opinion on that suit and no source of tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h looks the limit in a suit contract but N//S can make about 3 C|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers were asking about 9@D after Q@C win,,, to set the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@C is daisy-picking. What did he expect to get in return?|pg||
nt|brolucius: perhaps this auction will persuade us all not to bid on a hand like West's in the future.|pg||
nt|jwit: Of course when partner has 20HCPs lol|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6-4 is nice, having 4@s's is nice; lot's of reasons to bid|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT a very poor contract    if in a slam  should be in a red suit    thought diamonds split badly|pg||
nt|jwit: If you like going for big numbers from time to time Bob|pg||
pc|h2|nt|thegarve: East is worth a raise with a singleton @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: kickback?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart bid ensures the killing lead against 4|pg||
nt|daman: bravo|pg||
nt|lestergold: but east has respected his partners minimum response tohis nenquiry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't it a lucky rather than a good stop, George?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bridge_one: in this situation A in @H is obliged ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Very unlucky @C break here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cue bid I assume|pg||
nt|hedyg: guess not|pg||
nt|brolucius: West wisely decides not to cue-bid the club void on his sub-sub-minimum hand.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: West's 3@S did not do justice to his support. He should have bid 3@H.|pg||
nt|robbg: As well they should, a mental error as I said.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|c9|nt|brgpro: well. the first sight of dummy huub thought his gambling worked.....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: odd-ur|pg||
nt|bobh1: wisely . . . except slam is cold|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What if a club control is all partner needs?|pg||
nt|ady: what does east expect pard to do with no diamond control  if he has got a bit more?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could well have K@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: on board 6 the Closed are in 3N, a much easier spot|pg||
nt|robbg: I agree completely David.|pg||
nt|jwit: Good contract here.  Trump lead would have been best, but with diamonds behaving, contract is cold.|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: De Wijs: "I won't signal too enthusiastically :)"|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky for them he didnt|pg||
nt|drg: needed a red suit lead to set this|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 15 points with tenace acesless combos in the minors is not a mandatory raise to game of a min weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|daman: you can look at it 2 ways     lucky or clever|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|ady: but will still sign off with no diamond control|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brolucius: You can't expect the red-suit breaks that you need after a 3@C opening. |pg||

nt|brolucius: Again Kendrick is determined to let partner know of the good spades.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S   makes    but hard to reach unless north decides to transfer with 3@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: HI Al :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes its a wondeful service to all bridge fanatics|pg||
nt|drg: not my choice|pg||
nt|jwit: FLOL|pg||
pc|hK|nt|wollies: ok |pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set|pg||
nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://icelandairopen.com/  - Tournament site|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wollies: hi folks |pg||
nt|hedyg: only bid 7+ card suits?|pg||
nt|robbg: Is there any nation in the world that has more good bridge per capita than Iceland?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mariner1: so NS should pickup a few more here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s looks like no problem with lie of dims friendly|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: striped-tailed ape, since East-West can in fact make a slam, but...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brgpro: hoi mart|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hello Mart|pg||
nt|wollies: Hi Jack |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: EW seem to have copied the NS bidding system here :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: It looks like a relay auction|pg||
nt|brgpro: well...this is not an easy 6NT to reach...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but this 3NT can be a dangerous bid - now need 4@C by west to no lose the slam|pg||
nt|brgpro: westra made a very aggressive 3@c jump bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Today it seems you can make 12 tricks with two aces missing, and 13 with one ace missing :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would prefere 3@D by west over 2@H|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes, we can often finesse one of the Aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I would've bid 3@C too, but I'm a junior :) Nice distr. imo|pg||
nt|brgpro: but 3@c is GF....not my choice though|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@D by East, you mean?|pg||
nt|wollies: hard to reach now I think |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: If they do indeed miss it, the match is locked|pg||
nt|brgpro: is it open now??|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@S is the more probable slam to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Hardly :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT showing fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s would deny|pg||
nt|bobh1: i like S's 3n bid--a source of tricks and secure @c stopper|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it was interesting, and we end on a strong point with both N-S pairs bidding and making 3NT after an opposing opening bid. They did well.|pg||
nt|lestergold: in fact pobably make 3|pg||
nt|drg: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This result will make the tournament all the more exciting|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont like to use the bonkers word in this exalted company but with the square root of no defence what is he doing?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: north was likely to pass if South just bid 3@S after the transfer|pg||
nt|mariner1: Last but not least, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Sharon Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|wollies: I think they will reach  6 @S easier than 6 NT |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 5@D seems like voidwood|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Asking for P|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: to show his aces, but not the @DA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D is sure void|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Or maybe just telling p to bid the final contract|pg||
nt|ady: this looks pretty flat      cherio all|pg||
nt|mariner1: broadcasts. Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: lovers worldwide!|pg||
pc|s8|nt|thegarve: He did not get any credit for discovering the good ol' U S of A - like Stayman he did not discover the method e publicized it|pg||
nt|jwit: Bad lead for the defense|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brgpro: well, bridge players are funny...they bid a suit on the 5 level and everyone is saying he has NONE!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: lol|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D (void) in this situation is for sure  2 - 6 - 5 and it is a choose for the partner to bid the best final contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I hope 6@C is not meant as such...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would bid 4@C, leaving more space at my p to continue the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Who would then bid 4@D, which is of no use, I think|pg||
nt|wollies: maybe it will end here ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: It doesn't seem worse than 6@S to me|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West don't know the stong of the partner - he can have the same cards without Q in @C for example ...|pg||
nt|wollies: Cant be true  that Muller is  also thinking here ?? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: He's not, but there's a screen separating SW from NE|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: So I can't enter anything untill the tray has passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1 trick lost in each suit|pg||
nt|drg: likely 3 more imps to win by 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: al right one maybe trick|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|bridge_one: it seem a exploration run rather than a bridge auction|pg||
nt|bobh1: dont think ducking the @h was such a great idea|pg||
nt|brolucius: And completing 10 boards inside one hour gets a nod of approval from me.|pg||
nt|lestergold: will Jon drop the stiffy K?|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I knew it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bridge_one: this 6@S is a invention - 5@D give at the partner the option to take the decision, so need to pass at 6@C now - East could have KQxxx in @S, so 6@C was OK, and 6@S nedd 3/3 ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem started with the choose of 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: But if 6@C missed the QJ(T), it's a disaster|pg||
nt|brgpro: no, pd rebid 2@s after 4th suit, has to be a good 5 card or 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Now Muller is thinking :)|pg||
nt|wollies: :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: over 5@D with xxx in @C East could bid 5@S, so 6 @C is a choose, isn't a forced bid|pg||
nt|brgpro: oh no!!!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, Muller is thinkink :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: tell him to lead the 4th card from his left hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Jack, do you play "GO" (weiqi in chinese) ?|pg||
nt|brgpro: little bit|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: That would be the nel (trump-9)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this auction remember me a waste tesuji of go :)|pg||
nt|wollies: what I thought  good C |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 9 hours for each player in go challenge - similar at this match ...|pg||
nt|brgpro: it takes 5 minutes to lead and 5 seconds( maybe even less) to finish the hand|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|hedyg: claim 10|pg||
nt|ady: 7 imps to n/s|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
nt|lestergold: no he was folled by the doubel so no overtrik|pg||
nt|daman: you have to be kidding|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: perhaps a little fortunate   many would have passed 2NT opening|pg||
nt|thegarve: must transfer - you may even have a 55@s fit|pg||
nt|ady: found partner with a monster   and still 4@S  not guaranteed|pg||

nt|hedyg: some of the first names are quite long too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rune Hauge is a football (soccer) agent and lives in Guernsey (among other places)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mr. Bird will tell you where Guernsey is located|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the sea.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|mariner1: now EW have the 4@S game|pg||
nt|daman: maximum result for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me predict 4@S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: could be a pass out|pg||
nt|hedyg: S can open|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  can make 3!|pg||
nt|ady: 3 spades|pg||
nt|jwit: If they play strong no trumps it should go 1NT all pass|pg||
nt|dburn: not much in the way of high cards, mind|pg||
nt|lestergold: but this one less exciting because itb cant go off|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS could save in 5@C|pg||
nt|robbg: Now a much tamer deal.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a small profit available in 5c 2 off|pg||
nt|mariner1: it may be difficult for N to think save.........|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a big percentage in vulnerable saves at imps because they are an unmitigated disaster when phantom|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D Multi, weak with one major|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bridge_one: 4@S is down if N/S find the ruff in @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yet it's a hard pass for E with @SKQ98 support|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in this hand 4@S work better that grand texas at 4@D)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Although he has to pass, having already shown 15-17 HCP|pg||
nt|drg: not easy for them to get into the auction|pg||
nt|brolucius: As usual, we are playing the last two boards of the set (9 and 10) first, so we will have comparisons with the Closed Room by the time we reach 1/2/3.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this might depend on the lead      good chances on heart lead|pg||
nt|jwit: They will have to scramble to try to find a seventh trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Sveinn got his debut with the national team in China last year|pg||
nt|dburn: this may let North into the auction cheaply, depending on methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW can make 4@H if they get there...... NS can save in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|wollies: hard  to underlead  your  A here |pg||
nt|dburn: but either she didn't have a method or she didn't want to use it|pg||

pc|d3|nt|ady: sorry only 2@S|pg||
nt|dburn: but now she may feel she's being talked out of something...|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL may be penalty, if so 4N is takeout|pg||
nt|lestergold: a 19/21 hand here|pg||
nt|daman: probably a @S partscore for NS on this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like it with a 7-card suit, but ...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: hrrrrmm      neother do I|pg||
nt|brolucius: A free bid of 2@C is enough now on the West cards.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: N hand isnt worth more than a 2@s bid imo|pg||
nt|hedyg: bad suit and queens and jacks|pg||
nt|ady: n ow too high unless e/w dont cash their clubs|pg||
nt|robbg: Can they really make @h with a spade tap?|pg||

nt|ady: hi Martin|pg||
nt|hedyg: wish he had the 7@H still|pg||
pc|d4|nt|thegarve: some Siberian front is going to freeze us|pg||
nt|thegarve: hi David|pg||
nt|lestergold: North will be very dissapointed to find how littlevalue his good looking hand has|pg||
nt|lestergold: in defence that is|pg||
nt|dburn: she would be even more disappointed to be referred to as "he"|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: well right the @S tap and the @H break would prevent a make|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: Can you make game on any lead?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: now can make|pg||
nt|lestergold: just 1 trick in each side suit basically|pg||
pc|sA|nt|thegarve: and Hi Hedy (who types far too fast for me)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|robbg: Fredin should get out for -100 here|pg||

pc|d5|nt|mariner1: this may reverse the gain from last board|pg||
nt|lestergold: well david how am i meant to know these things|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|jwit: Spade shift was costly.  Would have still beaten it with a diamond shift.|pg||
nt|bobh1: or a @c shift|pg||
nt|ady: can stiil establish  7th trick |pg||
nt|jwit: Yes the heart|pg||
nt|bobh1: @s shift gave up the tempo|pg||
nt|drg: can claim now|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|brolucius: It may make little difference but I certainly would have led a heart rather than a trump from the East hand.|pg||
nt|jwit: Which should be ok since EW can make 4C|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h5|nt|brolucius: Declarer did not risk the club finesse because he has noted that he can set up a trick in hearts.|pg||
nt|daman: looks like you can|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did not play @H!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: another cblown it   had to play hearts first|pg||
nt|hedyg: now if E covers the Q@H he is down|pg||
nt|lestergold: A and another spade gives u a problem about thye heart losers|pg||
nt|daman: but the Qx of @Cs is onside to offset that defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://icelandairopen.com/index.php?m=D3&id=M_OPENTEAMS2009&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2009  for leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the dims can be picked to|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but what if West inserts @CQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That gives declarer a losing option|pg||
nt|robbg: I have to admit I don't like a vul 1@s overcall with Fredin's hand, but it works out ok.|pg||
nt|jwit: I'm usually pretty conservative, but I don't mind it with the sixth spade.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|ady: even if he does not cover    still down|pg||
nt|daman: I win the Ace and play the Jack|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: assuming does not cover the 2nd heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: she may of course be a tom boy in which caase shed be flattered|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: well if he covered just the 2nd @H..|pg||
nt|hedyg: gave him the contract twice|pg||
nt|dburn: well, may as well try for a diamond break and an overtrick|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: admittedly not easy for W to switch to @c any time|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my|pg||
nt|ady: this is the problem of 3rd & 5th leads|pg||
pc|c8|nt|daman: and pitch a @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s not that comfortable a looking contract- very hard to reach|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jwit: Overtrick now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think a diamond lead is the most troublesome|pg||
nt|daman: have 2 entries to set the rest of them up if need be|pg||
