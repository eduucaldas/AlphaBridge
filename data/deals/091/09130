nt|janm: That's always interesting - trying to get the stronger hand to declare and in a relay system trying to get the hand that's been shown to be dummy. Sometimes tricky to achieve ...|pg||
nt|janm: though|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c2|nt|bigtrain: it's not so much declaring consideration as space saving and low level suit agreements|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bigtrain: it's fairly random as to who plays the hand frequently|pg||
nt|kit: of course if West had 4 hearts instead of 4 spades, they would have wrong-sided it|pg||
nt|janm: Certainly on this hand it was good to have N on opening lead - it was tough for him not to give something away|pg||

nt|xenya: N considering a @S switch?|pg||

nt|xenya: but you don't really bid grand missing the trump Q?|pg||
nt|cicus: no but if the auction is crowded you can't pay attentiom to nuances|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Vladimir, but N could have had it but with no chance to raise when partner jumps to 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS not a regular partnership, is 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|xenya: true, Roland|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S is forcing|pg||

nt|hedyg: orkc= option roman keycard|pg||
nt|cicus: Optional Roman Key.Card asking for aces|pg||
nt|cicus: optional, because it also asks about strength|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: 1st step agrees to slam, if other bid than 1st step then dont want slam but show number of keycards|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: not clear how to play this hand|pg||
nt|janm: We'll soon see whether he can manage 12 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: without club lead, declarer could have ducked a heart, then pitched a club from dummy, and taken a couple of club ruffs|pg||
nt|kit: but club lead and continuation if he tries this prevents the club discards|pg||
nt|kit: if he takes a diamond finesse, that will get him to 12 tricks by then ducking a heart, but if diamond finesse is off then he has problems|pg||
nt|janm: Certainly not at all clear where to go and also what bad things to try to guard against|pg||
nt|janm: Notice that Curtis Cheek sort of prevented EW from bidding a slam in the other room by opening 1@h in third seat with the South hand :)|pg||
nt|kit: but I do think diamond finesse is best, since if it wins he can count 12 tricks (assuming trumps split) and if it loses he still has chances|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kit: key to this sort of hand is you have to count winners|pg||
nt|janm: Notice that S had a chance to DBL 5@d. I've heard discussions of maybe doing that with a hand like S's where you know that finesses are actually on - try to convince the opponents ...|pg||
nt|janm: that the diamond finesse is off to keep them out of slam (or in this case maybe get them off the best line of play)|pg||
nt|kit: I guess testing the trumps is okay -- not sure though|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|janm: He's not looking to ruffing 2 clubs for his 12 tricks|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: if he is then he's seriously mistimed the play|pg||
nt|kit: I think he just takes diamond finesse now|pg||
nt|janm: Just playing for the diamond finesse to be on? |pg||
nt|mrdct: The official website is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ which has live scores from all matches, a webcam and other goodies.|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: he can finesse both red suits in either direction|pg||
nt|kit: basically makes if diamond king on or diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: seems normal to get the @hs wrong|pg||
nt|janm: Diamond to the Q and if that loses then try for 3-3 diamonds and if that doesn't work then take the heart finesse?|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|kit: uh oh|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h2|pc|dK|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: marston must play a @c now|pg||
nt|kit: but his play has the advantage that on a different club layout North would be end-played|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
