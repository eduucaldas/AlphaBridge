nt|ahollan1: Meck gets the official credit|pg||
nt|irwinbo: joey grue grew up in minneapolis. he came into his own at the ripe old age of 17 or so he has a real feel for the game|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: in the head to head match for a spot in the final sweden lead netherlands 22-5|pg||

pc|h8|nt|frankaus: NS play transfer advances  - will be new to many of our kibs|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: so far identical to when we saw this board earlier|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: we don't have Walter Johnson here for confident translations of EW actions, but i'll make educated guesses from notes|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: Eric devised rebids that aren't even close to standard Precision 1@D-2@D auctions -- no surprise there:)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this should be quick push|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|vugrapha3: this hand took a lot longer when fruewirth was north|pg||

nt|frankaus: BBO, ABF and QBA should be congratulated we have all 5 tables in play covered by vugraph|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not the best defence so likely only 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Is it usual to put on the highest from a sequence, when partner plays the suit. I normally play the lowest. Here @dJ from J10xx|pg||
mb|1D|nt|henryb: 170 and 140 is also an imp: 5 or 4|pg||
nt|ady: think they might get overboard here|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||

pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: Is 3@H invitational for any of you? It isn't for me. You have lots of other bids available for an invite|pg||

nt|ralfwil: no! |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Purely competing - looks as if North revalued his collection|pg||

nt|henryb: (quacks are queens and jacks)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Manaca should know declarer has the singleton @SK|pg||
nt|ady: was  this the 2@C lead?|pg||

nt|frankaus: has some defence as well |pg||
nt|janm: sorry, meant to send that privately - forget I'm here!!|pg||
nt|bbramley: again, grue has extra values for his opening, but a more typical @D holding|pg||

nt|frankaus: lets see if Hans can lkand this|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|bbramley: ish has done well on lead - the "normal" heart lead would have given up the 9th trick immediately|pg||
nt|irwinbo: north will feel the pressureof 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|frankaus: Fruewirth still cant be certian which M del'monte has|pg||
nt|irwinbo: easy nine tricks|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @S6 sure looks like high from junk|pg||
nt|bbramley: now north will be squeezed on the run of @Ds - if rodwell can figure out north's hand, he can make on an endplay|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i reckon both fruewirth and rodwell have worked out which suit ish has|pg||
nt|bbramley: if north pitches 2 hearts, rod can cash @HAK and lead a spade|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: although has seems a bit too strong a word|pg||
nt|bbramley: if north saves 3 hearts, he must blank one of the black suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting question from spec -- what are single-dummy merits of @SQ at trick 1|pg||
nt|bbramley: eric can be confident of the spade honors, but he doesn't have the count yet, and he must worry that south has a high club|pg||
nt|bbramley: while south avoided the @H lead, he also avoided the killing @CJ lead, which would have given his the first 5|pg||
nt|frankaus: results can be accessed via - http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but results for today are not available yet|pg||
nt|frankaus: and tommorrows is comming soon :)|pg||
nt|bbramley: another bad hand for 4th from longest and strongest|pg||
nt|bbramley: still, i'm not going to give up on that theory just yet|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: in 80s Paul Marston wrong an article "Canape Leads" - where 54 hands do better leading from 4-card suit|pg||

pc|h3|pc|dT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 teams of 1-time losers are competing here for a spot in the next 3-way|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|bbramley: possibly N/S are playing 3/5 vs. NT, but even so 3rd from 5 would be unusual|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|bbramley: 1@H = artificial, 8-11 any shape EXCEPT denies 5+ spades|pg||

nt|frankaus: jxxx is not usually a recommended lead|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: nunn-hans can cash out for an IMP now|pg||

mb|2S|nt|frankaus: X t/o here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|vugrapha3: for those who werent here earlier we are playing a triangle|pg||
nt|bbramley: this is another bad hand for 4th from longest/strongest - annoying|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: and so ends the streak of 3N contracts|pg||
nt|frankaus: not 4 me after a XX all X = penalty|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i should have trusted my first guess  2@C=2+  preserves 1@S-2@D with 5+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: -2 looks very doable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: so this room will remain open and you'll get to watch their teammates play the same 8 boards straight afterwards|pg||
nt|bbramley: and 2 down looks most likely - declarer should manage his AK, A and 3 trump tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: not sure if 2@S just a waiting bid but it sures looks that way|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: so delayed 3N shows doubt about @D suit|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|bbramley: here's a big chance for N/S - slam is cold and seemingly easy to bid, although the other room flunked the test|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: does the big club include arsenal for reaching the cold slam?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|vugrapha3: K9xx @s makes a @s game a real possibility|pg||

nt|ahollan1: some use 1@H as 4@H possible 5+minor -- others 1@H=artificial stronger hand|pg||
nt|bbramley: 1@H is natural, showing 4!+ @Hs and is forcing one round|pg||

mb|4C|an|cue|nt|ahollan1: so here 1@H was @H & possible canape|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4@D Last Train - but operator got there first|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|bbramley: 4@S = RKC and 4NT = 0/3|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|irwinbo: wd|pg||

nt|ahollan1: easy stuff|pg||

nt|bbramley: well done - a simple auction to the top spot, even with a few conventions along the way|pg||
nt|henryb: on the previous hand can Grue hold it by cashing the @h and playing a Qs before the third @h|pg||
