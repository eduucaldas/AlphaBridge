nt|santyclz: Most common players of all playing here.|pg||
nt|hedyg: the operator will enter their names as soon as they sit|pg||
nt|hedyg: usually we are not shown the boards before the players arrive for security reasons|pg||
nt|hedyg: our operator is Carlos Araujo, ola Carlos :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if this will be a fun board, though.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: hi,welcome to Porto|pg||

nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hedy will sing for us while we wait.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: 6 imp carryover to Miguel Sousa Guedes|pg||
nt|hedyg: you dont really want that|pg||
nt|hedyg: that explains the score|pg||
nt|santyclz: Dance on the table?|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice weather in Porto?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: i guess we opened the table too early,sry for that :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: np|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: yes,nice as usual :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Joao :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe you can tell us about the players|pg||
nt|jfaria: hello Hedy|pg||
nt|jfaria: and everybody |pg||
nt|hedyg: our "local expert" :)|pg||
nt|jfaria: if 200 miles counts as local :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, same country!|pg||
nt|jfaria: of coursae|pg||
nt|santyclz: For information on Porto, you could start at:  http://www.portugalvirtual.pt/_tourism/costaverde/porto/index.html|pg||
nt|jfaria: course|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: olá,João,boa noite :)|pg||
nt|jfaria: boa noite Carlos|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is João then !|pg||
nt|jfaria: we can start guessing about the auction :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am showing off my accents!|pg||
nt|jfaria: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: N will open a weak 2suiter?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they play it|pg||
nt|jfaria: iff|pg||
nt|jfaria: they play 2 suiters...|pg||
nt|hedyg: if not E will open 1@c and S will Ghestem that|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: players arriving|pg||
nt|jfaria: otherwise pass i guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: E has 4 losers, maybe open something strong|pg||
nt|jfaria: maybe 1@s in that case?|pg||
nt|hedyg: S should overcall anyhow|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: some problems in closed room,will start when connection avaiable|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then nobody can stop N|pg||
nt|jfaria: no doubt|pg||
nt|hedyg: so we will wait for them, Carlos?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We don't use initials, only last names|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and pls insert flags|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Carlos|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets start!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: yes :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hedyg: yeah!!!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: now Ghestem|pg||
nt|jfaria: if they play michaels no 2 suiter available|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|jfaria: lol|pg||
nt|santyclz: for some meanings of "on"|pg||
nt|hedyg: popular convention in Portugal|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jfaria: but I think 1 @s does it|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: here it does|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Playing Ghestem is the certain way of conceding 2300, because at least one always forgets|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: no Ghestem,sry :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: np to bid 4@s in S|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: lol i see Carlos|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jfaria: a litle coward W pass...|pg||
nt|hedyg: but most top players do play Ghestem in Portugal as we have seen in former broadcasts|pg||
nt|jfaria: Castro must do all...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: 5@s still makes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: Ghestem is number 11 on my list of "25 Conventions you do not Want to Learn"|pg||
nt|jfaria: now Castro musr guess @h ?|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||

nt|mmmakela: where's Poconos at Joe(and hi!)|pg||
nt|mrdct: hi everyone|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks, hi Dave.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: hi everyone|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi|pg||
nt|pbundy: hi everyone .....|pg||
nt|mildredb: hi everyone|pg||
nt|gowdy: Hi |pg||
nt|woozle: This should be a good match - the strong Global team has come off a big loss to play the leaders USA Hampson|pg||
nt|mariner1: are they Global, or just merely confused? :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all - |pg||
nt|mariner1: top 15 advance + Yeh Bros team as sponsors|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: top 16 go through so both of these teams are comfortable, but top 7 get a 2nd chance|pg||
mb|1H|nt|santyclz: Northeast Pennsylvania (our local excuse for mountains.)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: hi Al and welcome all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hello again Sunil|pg||
nt|gowdy: soft 1st hand  4 @S looks easy|pg||
nt|woozle: Easy 4S for NS to begin...hard to imagine what else they might do with it|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mrdct: probably a @c partscore for EW here|pg||
nt|mrdct: west thinking of passing this in|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H instead of DBL is interesting choice|pg||
nt|pbundy: well; i haven't seen this for a while! natural to play bid over 1NT|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes A Y   are in tenth place  and the face quiet a good team   Beware*|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Looks like an uneventful 3nt to get everybody settled in.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: veteran Indonesian pair facing a lot younger Dutch pair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks, hi Steve.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: West took a while to open that hand- was he going to pass ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's often not a good idea to open in 4th seat without a @S suit|pg||
nt|salokin: Hi All|pg||
nt|pbundy: is 2@S appropriate?  hard to know|pg||
nt|mariner1: the top 8 enter next session with NO LOSSES , next 8 with ONE LOSS and its|pg||
nt|mariner1: double elimination, two losses and you are out|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bjacobs: A well known husband wife combo here|pg||
nt|mildredb: perhaps they play wk NT |pg||
nt|pbundy: possibly - reasonable supposition|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|mrdct: as more often than not you write down -110 defending 2@S|pg||
nt|pbundy: manoppo wisely passes|pg||
nt|gowdy: may get to the 5 level   but no harm there|pg||
nt|woozle: Bold 4H from McGann, escapes for 800 if he guesses trumps|pg||
nt|woozle: Even a slam move from Curtis will escape unscathed as long as he counts his aces correctly|pg||
nt|gowdy: yes  even todat's game 4NT should be blackwood|pg||
nt|woozle: presumably NS have the mechanism to show a better 4S bid, like pass-then-pull|pg||
mb|3D|nt|othered1: I assume 3@His a summary auction |pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: garbage stayman|pg||
nt|santyclz: Struck gold.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: so both these teams have a shot at being in the top 8 which is a big advantage|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: american style raise by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: sunny 81f or 25c at the venue|pg||
nt|frankaus: still time to catch a flight to one of autralias national events :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: pairs start Sunday - teams Tues|pg||
nt|mrdct: a problem for EW here is that 1@C doesn't show a @C suit so they could lose their fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doubleton @SQ will help - but can east maintain control?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Al bbl might have got them to the great 6@D contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Have to confess I'd spend all my time scuba diving on your reefs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hi Steve, Joe and Marshall|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 3rd and final @h?|pg||
nt|mrdct: lindqvist might play his partner for 5@h here and compete to 3@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: but I would suggest he's already fully described his hand and should leave it up to south to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|jbgood: n still thinking - not good|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Joanna and Lew Stansby against the best of British|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Bill Jacobs and Jan van Cleeff|pg||
nt|imp_jan: folks good morning (it's europe here)|pg||
nt|salokin: very popular now to play TRF over a (semi)nat 1@C opening 1@S is then a TRF to 1N or sometimes @D's |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: declarer will have no problem to collect at least 8 tricks probably 9|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: hi Roland, steve, Joe and specs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|woozle: He'll still be fine unless he duplicates the other table's line of play - I don't know which additional loser they found|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: or even ten with the nice position of cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Michael Askgaard|pg||
pc|cK|nt|santyclz: He did only have 7 hcp for his x, but who's counting?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this contract looks quite safe|pg||
nt|mildredb: this can go dn 3 w/ best def|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|robinswr: club lead is to be able to cross ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: E showed hearts - so what? Hi all|pg||
nt|mrdct: he is a passed hand though so a shapely 7 count looks fair enough to me|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: oops, balanced them in to a game that may make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Brad Coles from Australia|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: just go for 3 round of @d  cash the Qof @c and finesse trump   easy seeing all 52 cards!|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Brad|pg||
nt|redgrover: hi all -- i'm very excited to see our kids on vugraph at this stage of the event|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, brilliant effort|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: how old are they Brad ?|pg||
nt|redgrover: nabil is about 16, andy early 20s|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sunsamvar: dbl|pg||
nt|bjacobs: N/S were right the first time with 2@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even with that lead - no entry to North!|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4 losers in 4h!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pbundy: yes; needs an immediate diamond shift|pg||
nt|mildredb: shdn't be hard to find - |pg||
pc|c6|nt|santyclz: It would be an impressive system that could get to 4@h on this hand.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not arguing with the x, but thinking over 3@c is an overbid.|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes i agree he has a clear pass over 3@c|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mrdct: but some players do like to think everything through twice|pg||
nt|mildredb: or @S|pg||
nt|askgaard: Hi|pg||
nt|othered1: @H split here isn't great, but friendly and guessable @D position may salvage this for NS|pg||
pc|s7|nt|salokin: other table ended up in 3@C after a precicion 2@D opening (short@D I think) |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Nikolas Bausback, Germany, and Martin Carroll, Ireland|pg||
pc|s5|nt|salokin: Hi All|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes; i guess if you lead back a spade and declarer goes up to lead a club - no dummy entries.|pg||
nt|pbundy: hard for the defense to go wrong|pg||
nt|pbundy: manoppo had to find another round of restraint.  not so easy on the auction.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: 6@D - yikes  i hadn't even considered that|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Best option is to lead a top spade from hand at trick 2, and catch East napping|pg||
nt|mildredb: @C now , the south need to ret low @H, otherwise might get endplayed|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: very young chaps  then good show |pg||
pc|d3|nt|mmmakela: Here in Finnish Lappland we got a meter of snow|pg||
nt|frankaus: reef is some distance from the venue (600-800 km) - but a fine surfing beach virtually accross the road|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Marshall Lewis from USA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi All|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N was not that far from an invitation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just wondering if they could find making game :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Team name Bridge i Norge means (as I am sure you have guessed) Bridge in Norway, the official bridge magazine there. Boye Brogeland is the editor|pg||
nt|pbundy: i think that this is ok IF north overtakes|pg||
nt|mildredb: sure|pg||
nt|pbundy: tough play to find tho|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: rehi|pg||
nt|pbundy: still - even 300 will be a nice pickup|pg||
pc|d4|nt|imp_jan: defenders cash out already|pg||
nt|pbundy: perhaps south should have anticipated and led low in any case.  even if south could have smothered the ten - a heart pitch is likely irrelevant|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, but more sharks at the bridge table.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Nicoleta Giura|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Hi Martin and Marshall|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|santyclz: Nicely done for an overtrick.  |pg||

pc|h7|nt|mmmakela: 10 and next|pg||
nt|frankaus: nany of the Yeh players staying for next weeks event - will be one of the finest gathering of bridge tallent ever assembled on AUS soil|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|santyclz: S had a complete count.  @h play was only right if n passed a10xxx akxxx x jx.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I never understood why you must open 1NT on 5422 when you have no rebid problem after 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: @s lead vs 3NT|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: when the bidding goes 1@c-1@H-1@s-1NT do you raise to 2NT with the S hand Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|hedyg: so i guess that is a reason to open 1NT, also trying to protect the red kings|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: If partner can't bid 2NT, he can forget it. I already showed 5-4 with 1@C followed by 1@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 10 HCPs as N would you bid 2NT over 1@s?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: certain 10 counts, sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and 16 opposite 9 with no fit is no bargain|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk4: Responder knows if we have a fit or not|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Hi Marrku|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mmmakela: four for me nonvul|pg||
nt|frankaus: poll for final contract & result ? 4@S NS 4 me|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5@hx would be my guess.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5@Hdbld|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://www.yehcup09.com.au/index.php is website with all kinds of info|pg||
nt|woozle: This deal is a free-for-all - whoever wins the bidding is free to struggle in a contract of their choice|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ok for 10 tricks then   I woudl have prefered to throw a@h on the 3rd round of @d|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: as it is on this one...|pg||
nt|othered1: Cayne jumps off to a 7-imp lead by making an overtrick in 4@H on board 1|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Anyone for 5@s by s?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not with this bidding tempo, S might bid on|pg||
nt|imp_jan: that's what i mean: 3nt|pg||
nt|gowdy: transfer here    yes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can make 4@H on a Motsian fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: EW using the increasingly popular treatment of transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|pbundy: mildred - assuming stnd methods, do you prefer 1@C or 1@D with this hand?|pg||
nt|mildredb: i open 1D w/ 4-4|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moysian|pg||
nt|redgrover: 3NT also likely to make|pg||
nt|askgaard: Sensible bidding by NS here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|santyclz: The 4@h opening at the other table got them to our expected contract.|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like i have a winning ticket :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I blame Lasut!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@H looks makable here for EW|pg||
nt|mrdct: and NS playing transfers also i believe|pg||
nt|woozle: If West transfers to spades he'll surprise North a bit, and then keep him quiet|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mrdct: EW have the chance to get the singleton @C not on lkead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South checks the backs of the cards ... partner has overcalled vul, they've bid to 3NT, and I've got THAT hand?|pg||
nt|woozle: 2S might be a chance to make, particularly if the DQ doesn't appear now|pg||
nt|woozle: 2S, 2D, 1H,3C will do|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3rd and 5th  is the Q rite ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moysian = 4 3|pg||
pc|s3|nt|redgrover: if north plays it|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 5 @c  seems more probable but difficult to make|pg||
nt|frankaus: $US70,000 first prize would make a nice filler for thir budgets|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am told Andy is 21,,, still excellent play for his age|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I'd bid 3 @H without the club ace|pg||
nt|santyclz: Markku and I each owe you a coke.  (No you can't make it a beer.)|pg||
nt|jbgood: after a @c opening - yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: but not now|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: the backs are blue|pg||
nt|imp_jan: previous brds the hackeds avoided 4@H indeed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: what pattern?|pg||
nt|redgrover: these guys are all very experienced -- they were in the finals of our nationals 2 years ago, and have some international experience too|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mmmakela: rosenkranz type maybe, promising 1/3 high honors in spades|pg||
nt|salokin: Hi Marrku|pg||
nt|mildredb: obviously n/s is playing stg @C system|pg||

pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: Fast Arrival|pg||
nt|santyclz: Transfers over a 1@c bid seem to work particularly well with Polish @c.|pg||
nt|mrdct: @C lead looks pretty clear-cut here|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess 1 down|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think if you are going to play transfers over 1@C it definately makes sense to broaden the range of hands that open 1@c|pg||

nt|imp_jan: here, in 4!x there 4 top losers|pg||
nt|imp_jan: in 4@c|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same bidding in Open|pg||
nt|marlowepi: IMO it is not obvious for W to pass this out in 2S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably 2H showed 4|pg||
nt|salokin: or some kind of snapdragon, promising semifit and 5-c in 4th suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Round 7:  Yeh Bros v USA Hampson and India Venkatesh v India National|pg||
nt|salokin: same bidding in OR|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 4 @c sounds like a cue|pg||
nt|askgaard: Not nice to have a hidden 5 card heart suit, but 2@h is too ugly with these cards|pg||
nt|askgaard: So I like his double|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|robinswr: i like weak fast arrivals|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was 2H something special? or did 1H not show 5?|pg||

nt|woozle:  If the next card is a low heart, Hanlon will probably get it right|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: very well done good judgement by South|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|sunsamvar: the pleasant surprises continue :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: effective bidding by curtis and joe has lead to a poor 3nt|pg||
nt|redgrover: is this one of those hands where you duck a heart? or is that too risky with 2 possible spade losers?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: hung toying between @S5 and @D9|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open it has gone P P 1@D DBL - 4@D - DBL - P - 4@S - P P P  so wrong spot there|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: well a difficult hand to bid with opponents silent  but @d opening stillmore difficult I do not like south double 2@c seems more appropriate|pg||

pc|h8|nt|mrdct: the official site is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ which has links to lots of useful info|pg||
nt|jbgood: double dummy to take it 2 down - needs a small heart |pg||
nt|jbgood: but the rest is also double dummy - so...|pg||

nt|imp_jan: amazingly Lavazza is last in the rankings for the moment|pg||
nt|rogerclee: i wouldn't really call a 1@H overcall at these colors "fairly orutine", but it is normal in NS's style|pg||
nt|gowdy: 4@S here  play or defend ?|pg||
nt|woozle: routine 4S for EW, and Curtis probably won't try to disrupt their auction at this vul|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S should be off 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: so loses a club and 2 spades |pg||
nt|marlowepi: this should be fun|pg||
nt|woozle: or I could be wrong|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|robinswr: maybe grue should have opened 1heart|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes it is very dangerous to open strong club when very distributional and short in spades|pg||
nt|mrdct: very good slam for EW here in @H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: no.. but will still make 12 cause @D split|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: correct|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: hello btw :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: No problem, for some reason the players frequently seem to have other things on their minds than ensuring the vg oper can see all their plays.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if NS are playing Precision or not - and 1@S doesn't resolve that issue |pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have major game and EW can't save due to VUL position I think|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|marlowepi: in general the same is true when two-suited, but on previous board N held spades, so the danger was greatly reduced|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a remarkable field - full of quality |pg||
nt|imp_jan: might be a slam in clubs here|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: R3: Australia Youth v Bridge i Norge and New Zealand v India National|pg||
nt|robinswr: 5clubs should show spade support|pg||
nt|mildredb: interesting X|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes; i wouldn't find it myself|pg||
nt|woozle: one club ruff in hand is ten tricks, losing a heart, diamond and the club ace|pg||
nt|woozle: McGann will always get to game here, but how he proceeds will perhaps give us an insight into his style|pg||
mb|r|nt|santyclz: On the @hk lead, e will probably make 6.|pg||
nt|robinswr: no he'll probably lose a club and a diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Joe means, because E can place the high cards|pg||
nt|mrdct: with 3@H showing a strong @H raise east is sure to make a move towards slam now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Easier for those who play any rebid other than 2@s shows extras, either in hcp or distribution.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice practical 4@S rebid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the Chinese are supposed to be precise :)|pg||
nt|redgrover: i think 5@D by east requires a heart lead to get 500|pg||
nt|mariner1: of course NS have to bid the game to play it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: u all agree with 2 clubs? |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: incidentally, tempo altered on purpose|pg||
nt|mildredb: I'm w/ you|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3 h  is my choice|pg||
nt|woozle: Hanlon can't bid 3S now, since that's what he would bid with a yarborough|pg||
nt|gowdy: could rite side it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: lots of playing strength so some might bid 3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same 3nt at other table on board 2|pg||

nt|othered1: pretty aggressive double, wonder if he planned a conversion to @D over 3@C|pg||
nt|askgaard: It's a good idea to have firm agreements about passes like north's here|pg||
nt|askgaard: Some play that it is a penalty pass. I do for instance.|pg||
nt|shevek: since EW can make game, not so dangerous...|pg||
nt|othered1: You could argue it's a penalty pass, but south fortunately has a doubleton @H , making a stack in north's hand very  unlikely|pg||
nt|askgaard: yes :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: and north has only one Jack that isn't working -- wow talk about cover cards|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hard to predict the fin contract on this one unless W opens 1 NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Which they did in OR|pg||
nt|woozle: 9xxx doesn't look much like a stopper, maybe 4H is the best bid|pg||
nt|gowdy: pass here|pg||
nt|woozle: 3NT makes anyway in comfort|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: who is the boss     sort of hand  here!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Søren Christiansen|pg||
nt|askgaard: It's a VERY expensive misunderstanding to have|pg||
mb|d!|an|game try|nt|santyclz: I do, bad honor structure.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3@d not alerted, kind of waiting bid i suppose|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think 3@D is natural, which South will turn into a cue with 4@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a difficult area for natural bidding|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: well it may have been alerted, casually|pg||
nt|pbundy: manoppo may wish that he had found pass, too|pg||
nt|gowdy: it is a stop however :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|woozle: I wouldn't be too confident against a vul weak two|pg||

nt|mariner1: syandings after 9 rounds|pg||
nt|shevek: hi Søren|pg||
nt|askgaard: Hi teammate!|pg||
nt|othered1: is double by west simply extras, even on this auction?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rogerclee: i am surprised at this non-diamond lead|pg||
nt|pbundy: not good when they play the same suit at both tables by the same team|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 4@C is low anyway|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: fall from grace here for NS but I do not know to whom the blame should go|pg||
nt|shevek: aha|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: I do too, was just asking|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm not quite sure what "serious 3NT bid" means - but it's got them on the right track for slam now|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Serious means he is very keen to go to slam.|pg||
nt|jbgood: apart from being a world champ - brogeland is the editor (and owner) of Bridge i Norge. His prd made his debut on the Nor Open Team last year by winning the European Teams Chship|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This auction will not make their highlight reel ... but they may escape with a game|pg||
nt|imp_jan: anyhow, the heart lead doesn't paralyze declarer|pg||
nt|gowdy: good to make the opps work for a push or lose 1 hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: good lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a vital tempo for defense lost|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: brogeland has been a frequent visitor to Australia in recent years to play in our major national events|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - and with Erichsen and for Stern|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: Looking at the N/S hands, 3NT is a dreadful spot|pg||
nt|pbundy: i hope children are not watching; this will not be pretty|pg||
nt|mildredb: hard to even know what to do @@ trick 2 :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: anyone for 2@C originally with the east hand?  not that 2@C would meet a particularly nice fate, either|pg||
nt|pbundy: medic|pg||
nt|mildredb: I don't understand east's pass, myself|pg||
nt|pbundy: i once was playing against a top lady professional with a client in a mixed pairs.  she put down a less than exquisite dummy, and her partner said "ms. x - i need to go to the ...|pg||
nt|pbundy: bathroom.  YOU play it" and left!|pg||
nt|mildredb: but 2@C looks better than 2@D|pg||
nt|pbundy: i would be tempted to do that on this hand - except - it was declarer who emerged the partnership in this |pg||
nt|pbundy: yes it does, mildred|pg||
nt|othered1: Why was 2@H alerted?  Anyone confident about it?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The losing team disappears from the main event and heads into the Swiss Plate|pg||
nt|sac: Better to lead Diamond Q this time but smal is normal|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: lauria said something to north about the 2@h bid but didn't write it down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Let me find the CC|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: versace didnt alert it only lauria|pg||
pc|d9|nt|frankaus: make will bid 2@C - if pd passes its likely to be the best spot|pg||
nt|mrdct: hopefully EW have a mechanism to work out they are off the trump A|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: not obvious why S is doubling. could N pass be forcing?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|frankaus: *many|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sunsamvar: only needs @Dk from p to take it down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on @D return, @CA @C ruff, trump, claim losing @HA|pg||
nt|imp_jan: this time a big club migth do the job|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and this is just setting up tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Single raise not mentioned|pg||
nt|askgaard: 4@h in the other room. Hard to decide which game is the better|pg||
nt|othered1: 9 easy tricks, even though south's distribution might not be clear to east|pg||

pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: which is going to make a massive number of tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gowdy: better to play this  one in w with a @D lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|robinswr: north is shows his hcps so that the clubs will be misguessed|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H play works, but only because West has !AH|pg||
nt|redgrover: i think given that North was given the chance to double 3@H, he's probably done his part|pg||
nt|frankaus: i like to let pd know that we have 8 major fit but, here - 1@S over 1@H would have placed NS in a better position|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in 4@S here in Open|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mmmakela: the lead was strange imo|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mmmakela: club seemed obvious|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: claiming now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|robinswr: so does he play for qj onsides or singleton honor offsides or QJ offsides|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h6|nt|robinswr: he can make it if north has a singleton honor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: It may seem odd that N did not try to cash heart with only stiuff in dummy. N is reasoning that: (a) EW would not bid a slam off 2 aces, and (b) S would have led hearts unless he ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: had so many that a void was probable. both assumptions less than guaranteed|pg||
nt|robinswr: is north 7-5 in the reds|pg||
nt|santyclz: S followed to 3 @ds.|pg||
nt|robinswr: easy looking at all four hands tough at the table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@H  5-9  3-card support|pg||
pc|s4|nt|woozle: He tangled the play a little, but was never really in trouble|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|robinswr: south never support hearts so north could have 9 of them|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: at this point Grue claimed 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|santyclz: Magic @c position.  The normal @c lead would have worked out much better.|pg||
nt|mariner1: so -200 will score imps for EW here|pg||

nt|mildredb: nor I|pg||
nt|pbundy: on the other hand.... i am somewhat fond of "barts" - 4/3/3/3 takeout doubles|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh they were Not DBL'd  I looked wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: sorry I for sure thought I saw a DBL :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: so somem yougsters still play ordinary weak twos|pg||
nt|redgrover: 3NT possibly off on a diamond lead here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: a frienfly hand for 3NT|pg||
nt|mittmouse: in the 1st match there was a trump suit of q9x opposite a10xxxx a great canadian player percy sheardown taught me that as long as righty wouldnt duck with kx u should play low to ...|pg||
nt|mittmouse: the q 9x  u only lose to a stiff j and u pick up all other holdings|pg||
nt|salokin: X shows ?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: @hs|pg||
nt|salokin: Ah thx now i see|pg||
nt|pbundy: still - this one is awfully minimum.  i think i might skip this one|pg||
nt|gowdy: is this a "good weak 2 with 2@D showing a poor one ?|pg||
nt|woozle: Interesting weak two from Grue, with more flaws than I can count|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is my 5th session is my excuse|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: hearts better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if 3@C is fit-showing or just some artificial 4card @S raise|pg||
nt|gowdy: Looks like it |pg||
nt|woozle: Nothing bad happening to him though, unless you're afraid to miss a playable featherweight game|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: how to stay out of game on this one?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not easy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@D - 3@H - Pass?  Seems a bit double dummy|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i think he'll punt 3NT, but he is thinking|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3@c not anybody's choice, some would have opted for 3@h i.s.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: like me :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: not me unless they are full value|pg||
nt|pbundy: curious pass by lasut|pg||
nt|woozle: Interesting lead...will McGann pick it?|pg||
mb|d|an|!|nt|ahollan1: did sheardown play with bruce elliot?|pg||
nt|redgrover: but might get a heart lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: 8-11, they have 2@D for weak, weak 2 i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I guess e was wondering what s had for his x.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wow, tom townsend is taking a view|pg||
nt|imp_jan: by passing|pg||
nt|mmmakela: they shd find on the way that 4 @S is the spot|pg||
nt|mcarroll: May not be so easy with NS so active|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @D lead needed ....... a @S or @H makes it    @c is nuetral|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: no the right guess  difficult let us admit|pg||
nt|redgrover: would have still been time to find @D switch after a top heart lead, but too late now of course|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: declarer   will pick the@c suit with no entry in the dummy|pg||
nt|redgrover: yes, would go down if he was able to finesse|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrdct: west will soon know he has a 9 card @H fit and a nice side suit of his own so slam ought to be bid here i expect|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The operation is a success, but the patient (3@C) is not going to live|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, it's not clear that 3@H would have made either|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and in breaking news, Lavazza are on course to win a match|pg||
nt|gowdy: notpossible|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: grue just asked hanlon if he ever undleads aces, after he won the trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|mittmouse: y|pg||
nt|pbundy: you'd be hard pressed to call this one "full value" mildred!|pg||
nt|mariner1: W was figuring a @H would give up a trick here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mmmakela: brb cig br|pg||
nt|frankaus: my beer stock is rising - all my other stock are falling :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wondered it too. am i talking too loud?|pg||
nt|mrdct: not to mention his stiff @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N serious slam try?  4@S reject ??|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well 3@c 'feels' stronger'|pg||
nt|mrdct: official website is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ for live scores from all tables, a webcam and other goodies.|pg||
nt|woozle: My experience with Ace underleads is that quite often the lead looks technically great, but partner doesn't read the position and hands back whatever the lead gained and then some|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: iwhat is 3 @C ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i met bruce elliot Toronto in 79 or 80 at one of the most impressive bridge clubs i've ever seen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he was impressive too|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I don't think there was a plus score on this deal for E/W.  Even defending 2@S won't work - that contract makes|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|shevek: http://www.yehcup09.com.au/  for results, web cam, bulletins, etc...|pg||
mb|p|nt|askgaard: I wonder if Lauria is proping for 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|robinswr: he doubled on his partner's 1club opener|pg||
nt|mmmakela: active as a dbl on 1-level, not that disturbing|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: at the end   South will thank North to have a weak hand !|pg||
nt|askgaard: Not so hot to blast 4@s and find partner with @hJxx|pg||
nt|sac: worried about a heartlead and a ruff in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1M-(DBL)-2N would have been Limit Raise +   -- just not sure about 3@C :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: S is in 3@C here in Open so more to Global|pg||
nt|othered1: They've wrong-sided @S, but only may cost an overtrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: none of the NS actions took up any bidding space, so it seems that their activity could only help EW to bid to right spot and to make what theyt bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Well, they got to 6@S in OR with no opposotion bidding!|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 100% agr|pg||
nt|salokin: I think W was more scared to miss a slam here|pg||
nt|salokin: without bidding slam is not that bad, just needing Qx in @H or QJ bare in @D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so a perf Roland 6|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Cheek wishes he played the 10 :)|pg||
nt|salokin: after the bidding here EW know that @H and @D are not braking in a favourable way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks for the OR report, Martin, which confirms my remark that the NS bidding was more likely to help EW than hurt them. W could tell E had a doubletoin spade and did not bid any ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: suit over 1S, so the likelihood of a heart loser was very high, hence no slam even if E has a maximum|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Broge thinking|pg||
nt|shevek: fair comment by a spec: 1@s by east would have rightsided 4@s|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes, it would, but they likely find they do well by staying within their system|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|mittmouse: probably fit showing|pg||
nt|mildredb: no, I consider 13 full value  :)  |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugrapha3: fsj|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: probably|pg||
pc|h4|nt|santyclz: This should stem the Netherlands tide.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, that same partner bypassed the chance to double. i reckon N was in a better position than S to know if his 1C opener contained adequate defense against 6S|pg||
nt|mrdct: sensible auction to a pretty good contract|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i think 3S there was a serious slam try as well|pg||
nt|imp_jan: Gold stole a diamond trick|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mildredb: perhaps the @D Q akes it iffy|pg||
nt|pbundy: i don't like having the Q in the @D suit.  would prefer it elsewhere|pg||
nt|askgaard: Once spades are wrongsided, I think that 3NT is actually better than 4@h|pg||

nt|mildredb: now all that remains is to cash @H & guess @D - will he or won't he?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|redgrover: it's polite to take at least one trick with dummy's cards, even if the entry was of no use|pg||
nt|askgaard: If North has a doubleton heart, 4@s is down with a trump promotion|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||

nt|fabsayc: hmm|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: this is not a fault but will cost and increase the margin|pg||

nt|mildredb: Yeh Bros now on score board for this round|pg||
nt|woozle: Tough hand for EW to bid....strong 4441s are never simple|pg||
nt|gowdy: now some action here|pg||
nt|woozle: If East opens something the spade fit will probably be lost, but 3NT will still make|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: another comfy 3NT that may not be that easy to reach|pg||

nt|woozle: third seat special from curtis|pg||
nt|askgaard: 2@c for hearts and 2@h for clubs|pg||

nt|askgaard: As far as I remember|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: as far as i can se north did not ask about he 2@h bid!|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: there goes 3nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am sure you are right, but as far as i am concerned S should just bid 3NT. after all, opps have bid two suits, so even if one of them is right to lead for the defense, they still ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have to find it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west would have to return a diamond to hold to 5|pg||
nt|woozle: Will Hanlon rip 3NT?|pg||
nt|gowdy: after P's free bid ?|pg||
nt|askgaard: Hmm|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk4: Our matches in round 2 are: China A vs Norway and USA Hampson (Meckwell) vs Chinese Taipei|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3nt might have denied a spade stopper|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: we had a lot of interesting hands in the last set..|pg||
nt|mildredb: yep, 6 badly needed imps |pg||
nt|gowdy: he knows  but what to do|pg||
nt|woozle: McGann doesn't really have anywhere to go except 3NT|pg||
nt|gowdy: I'm glam I'm here and not sitting W|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: this board has been played 4 times so far twice in 4@S twice in 6@S|pg||
nt|gowdy: glad|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=9&B=25&T=O|pg||
nt|othered1: or maybe it's a cue-bid in support of partner's overcall?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: south says 3@C is a @S raise to his screenmate (west)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mmmakela: surprised Erik(saelesminde) resting in this key match|pg||
nt|woozle: 6D can be made, if that's where they finish|pg||
nt|othered1: or perhaps a fit-showing bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: sounds a 50 point deck|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so? if N calmly passes they might lead clubs. these methods that give so much info to opps are of dubious practical value when you have 25 HCP and two balanced hands.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 sp is 1 nt without a heart stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the set  2 was a rollercoaster|pg||
nt|woozle: lots of dummy entries for the trump coup|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Hanlon thinking now|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@h might suggest @d shortage?|pg||
nt|askgaard: The 1@s overcall might look thin, but I think it would be standard for most players at this level|pg||
nt|sac: hard to pass for Lauria now|pg||
nt|shevek: other room W is playing 5@c dbled I'm told|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: is this going to play any better by south?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: suppose ew play 2/1, that explains the 3@c by east|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: No but North knew what was going on after the D was ducked|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lack of action by W a bit surprising, facing Nonvul foes|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good contract|pg||
nt|mmmakela: a few down ok|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on this auction E is unlikely to have only five clubs, so W can act|pg||
nt|salokin: here the precision NAT 2@C opening left the @S-fit in the dark. Which was found in th OR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, it wasn;t just the opening bid that left spades unmentioned. W had 2 chances to bid the suit|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 2@S bal was obvious|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our Round 7 matches in about 55 mins are: Yeh Bros v USA Hampson and India Venkatesh v India National|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 2S directly would be inappropriate, a balance would be in order, i;d say|pg||
nt|salokin: true, and he possible knows that either ther is a 8-c @C fit or a 9-c @S -fit|pg||
nt|salokin: in 2@H N could save a trick with a intrafinesse in @D|pg||
nt|salokin: If getting in time in hand|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no entries I guess|pg||
nt|salokin: to play the 2nd @D round (1st smal to 8) Q@D to pin the doubleton J|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S now puts his suits in proper perspective|pg||
nt|mariner1: and are in trouble here now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: NS pair nicknamed "Drinkdriver", has nothing to do with the actual meaning of the word :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oper, pls check that.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nico is teasing us.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: getting better by the minute|pg||
nt|mrdct: will score an extra @H trick at the very least|pg||
nt|jbgood: any better is also a way of putting it..|pg||
nt|mrdct: but doesnt have an obvious source of tricks|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: McGann sighed when he saw the four spades in dummy|pg||
nt|gowdy: but is it realy a 4 card spade suit or some @D try with a @S card  I don't know|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sunsamvar: so the law of probability dictates flat hands here i suppose|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugrapha3: curtis didn't realise was his turn!|pg||
nt|redgrover: a nice little convention to have there, especially if partner is prone to being 2-2 in the majors|pg||
nt|sac: well done. The only game with a chance in this layout I think. But a long way to go|pg||
pc|sA|nt|robinswr: 4clubs would have gone down at least one probably two|pg||
nt|mrdct: he's surely going to go after @C here|pg||
nt|mrdct: west needs to be careful not to get endplayed|pg||
nt|jbgood: he will|pg||
nt|jbgood: go for clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: so they have another call to invite in @H|pg||

nt|shevek: only 50's|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mmmakela: their system is called Drink|pg||
nt|frankaus: gib makes it will Manoppo?|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect he will|pg||
nt|santyclz: GIB looks at all 4 hands.  Gives it a slight advantage.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bjacobs: A sensitive auction|pg||
nt|imp_jan: nothing against 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W established the the heart position was a bit shaky|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: i would bid    with w   cards  2@d and then 2@s   to show a weak major 2 suiter but I am much older|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jbgood: but you never can tell with boye|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That duck is a good expert tactic - threatening to ruff the losing heart, whilst maintaining control of the suit|pg||
nt|woozle: I think if you're going to skip the spades to get the excellent diamonds in, you should be  planning to bid the spades later|pg||
nt|shevek: declarer knows south is void in @cs|pg||
nt|askgaard: I don't like declarer's chances here|pg||
nt|sac: neither do I|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: .|pg||
nt|askgaard: Some magic is needed|pg||
nt|sac: but I like it better than 5clucs doubled|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mrdct: boye hoping to get the opps to open up the side suits for him|pg||

nt|redgrover: which may have been more appropriate on this hand|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6 shd make but the grand they bid in OR won't I suppose|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess it takes a trump lead to beat it.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@CX was down on ly one.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|robinswr: this is what happens when you operate and overcall 1nt with that hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OR:  ....this is what happens when you make a great bid but you are stuck with systemic agreements that gum up the works|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not as if 1D was more likely to get NS to 3NT than a 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|robinswr: maybe he should have run 6 diamonds before leading a spade|pg||
nt|shevek: west was told 3@C a @S raise, i c|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: W is playing 2@S here in Open|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm going to jump into the operating chair now - so i'll see you all on the other side shortly|pg||
nt|askgaard: Well done to escape for down one in 5@cX|pg||
pc|d6|nt|redgrover: of course if nabil had found a fit here, game could have been easy -- his partner's major suit holding was a disappointment|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mmmakela: now 3xspades must stand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sounds like we need another Buller/Culbertson match.|pg||
nt|sac: only one down in 5clubs, and this could go more than 2 down now I think, so maybe I was wrong (not the first time)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: was probably worried about squeezing dummy|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: good play by Huang to not cover the 9. that made N think that W's remaining spade was the 8 or ten|pg||
nt|robinswr: tse is counting points and doesn't think his partner has any|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure why N played the ten of diamonds on the first round. that gave away a lot of information|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm told the other table is in 6S...I assume that suggests a big swing to USA Hampson|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: youngster in deep trouble in danger not to be in the first 16|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mildredb: now for the @S plays|pg||
pc|dT|nt|robinswr: but he has to lead a heart or a club and a club will defenently give up a trick|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|rogerclee: going for a penalty at the 3-level at this vulnerability cannot be the percentage action|pg||

nt|askgaard: Signal for clubs apparently at trick 1|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|vugrapha3: they whispered something, couldn't hear ,sry|pg||
nt|robinswr: but at least he could have stripped the diamonds so the opponents would have to give up a trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North can't guess wrong in @D -- for me E would hold @DAQ or split honors and I wouldn't be able to guess right|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sunsamvar: he will find out as much as he can abt the E/W distribution before tackling @D..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer will give himself an extra chance in @C, but when Jack doesn't fall - @D from dummy then worry, then glee|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but u r right Al i will get it wrong too if the @D honours were split|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|bjacobs: 3 tricks to go - I think Jan might play on diamonds now|pg||
nt|redgrover: maybe you could argue that east is likely to have values outside spades, so a minor ace is best -- against that, there could be a spade ruff|pg||
nt|askgaard: Nice defense|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: She will then look to play 2 rounds of trumps - ducking one round, and then playing the ace.  THEN she can play her good heart|pg||

pc|d7|nt|Walddk4: R5: England v Stansby and Lavazza v Shanghai Pudong|pg||

pc|s2|nt|santyclz: NEXT!|pg||
nt|woozle: West under pressure here...an overtrick is available unless he pitches the diamond ace|pg||
pc|sT|nt|woozle: Did Joe really claim 10?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Grue is entertaining to watch, he commentates on the hand during the play and provides lengthy post mortems|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he claimed 4 only after asking to look at McGann's hand|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h7|pg||

nt|marlowepi: so far these deals would be better fare for a Board-a-Match event|pg||
nt|mildredb: yes the 21 hcp slams are not usually bid|pg||
nt|woozle: 5S safe for EW, but how much bidding will Joe do with his 6/5?|pg||
nt|woozle: I assume that 2NT is some kind of good raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in a part score here|pg||
nt|askgaard: Every hand is suitable for a NT opening these days :)|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|sunsamvar: but here the precision 1 nt may apply the brakes|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: difficult to grasp this for a youngster as Espen Lindqvist..|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Surely yes|pg||
nt|salokin: 3@D I mean|pg||
nt|shevek: who cares abt range with that @c suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: but here we are|pg||
nt|mildredb: nothing to the play on this hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|mmmakela: six dias great contract but this time....|pg||

pc|s4|nt|mmmakela: now a danger|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not to cash out I mean|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They need to get their tricks fast or lose them|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Yes - on bidding unlikely that EW have a 4-4 @S fit|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he knows it's his turn :)|pg||
nt|askgaard: Here it made things simple|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: Should it not make?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the open room Kit Woolsey says that the percentage play in diamond is low to the 9 spot|pg||
nt|jbgood: not only what he is doing - but what he and prd are doing together:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: even more important|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not many losers ... but are there 10 winners?|pg||
nt|pbundy: yep|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mmmakela:  6 dias might, at least dbld it will|pg||
pc|sK|pg||

nt|woozle: not hard to place the hearts on the auction|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Grue: "I cant blame you"|pg||
nt|woozle: win the heart, two spades ending in dummy, heart up...if ducked, another spade across and another heart up|pg||
nt|askgaard: Had N shown a gameforce singlesuiter (@c) they might have gone overboard|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|mmmakela: of course no dbl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kit: the reason I think low to 9 is right play in slam is that it will be tough for East to duck from King-doubleton|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so if 9 loses to jack, I would then take finesse on way back|pg||
nt|santyclz: Isn't the normal play leading the 9 from dmy?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so not pecentage play but best play?|pg||
nt|rogerclee: even if yeh knew his partner had a doubleton diamond, ducking seems wrong|pg||
nt|mwigor: indeed that happened in the other room and they are playing 5@c|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: overtake and play @D to show @S reentry|pg||
nt|shevek: if north opens a @c EW might finet their @s fit...|pg||

nt|Walddk4: We will not necessarily continue with the same matches on vugraph in the second half. Organisers will decide when they see all first half scores|pg||

pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: that reopening double puzzles me|pg||
nt|robinswr: not sure why hampson reopened with a double|pg||
nt|robinswr: it is a takeout double but when does he expect to make a game|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: an imp here for aussie youth if this makes|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: And indeed, 3NT makes easily on this layout|pg||
nt|mariner1: 43 VP not possible|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|imp_jan: what else could south bid over the 1@h response?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@D is a massive underbid ... but what alternative is there?  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: danger|pg||
nt|gowdy: down  got to get light in this room eh|pg||
nt|woozle: diamond lead leaves this with 6 losers|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: 1N transfer to @C?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: y |pg||
nt|redgrover: true, hence their being in serious trouble|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mariner1: lead here helps|pg||
nt|mariner1: found 7, looking for 8 and 9 now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West will duck the first @h and some homework for declarer|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mcarroll: OR bid to 4@H|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10 tricks was impressive|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe a heart switch now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|askgaard: But Versace is probably right that it isn't worth it with his bad distribution and soft values|pg||
nt|askgaard: Same evaluation in the other room|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: 3NT suggested, and it certainly has some merit|pg||
nt|salokin: OR ended up in 4@H when W after the same bids jumped to 4@H|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nice shift.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wonder if 3S denied 5H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suspect you are right|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: interesting choice of leads rather than @D for a look|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lol. west does not lead from @D ak and east leads from his q into a dangerous looking jtx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 4nt was not the tool here, aces not the issue|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a general invite of 5@S would be my choice|pg||
nt|mariner1: Youth currently tied with Australian Open for 15th|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: i guess that as long as bids like this double keep getting opps to do the wrong thing, NS will continue to make such bids|pg||
nt|rogerclee: if east showed exactly 4-4 in the majors i think west should not accept a slam try, he knows his hand is quite bad opposite a 44(32) slam try|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: It's complicated by the 3-card heart support.  How about a wacky 2NT?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it does make sense - if North held KJx and East AQ10 - then need extra entry for 2nd @H through|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seamon did indeed switched to a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk4: switch|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lebridgeur: 2 @s tricks  2@h tricks and a @d will do the job|pg||
nt|mariner1: N in 3N here in Open too, @D lead|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mildredb: 2 more rounds  to Q - top 8 teams Q, unless Yeh Bros not in top 8, then the top 7 + Yeh Bros. team|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bjacobs: Others might manufacture a jump shift.  2@S or 3@C, but that just postpones the crisis|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @SK to the ace, spade to the jack, @SQ and a heart|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|woozle: 2H will be claimed soon|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: :)  Sunil I hadn't even noticed dummy's @D10  --  sorry partner, I couldn't get a count on DUMMY|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mrdct: official website is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ for live scores from all tables, a webcam and other goodies.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: perhaps a little bizar, but i would opt for 3@c|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sac: nice jack of diamonds|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|redgrover: i can't see a winning line on a diamond lead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: here's a shortcut  http://tinyurl.com/yeh-2009-results|pg||
nt|mariner1: not an obvious one for sure......... would need help|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|santyclz: It look as if they're off the Schnieder.|pg||
nt|pbundy: different options for what declarer might do on this hand|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think 3@C is a lot better than 2@S ... you can always keep going back to diamonds over clubs|pg||
nt|askgaard: Right. North discarded the @h7 Roland, perhaps not so helpfull|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|pbundy: better win the ace!|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i agree that the key is the dull shape of the W hand|pg||
nt|rogerclee: yes i think 5c is the correct bid|pg||
nt|pbundy: penultimate hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lebridgeur: another good result for NS  this board 8|pg||
nt|redgrover: have to hope justin makes this at the other table, or the kids are gone|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: that's what i mean and over 4@C you correct to 4@H|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S makeable if NS are amazingly aggressive|pg||

mb|2D!|an|tfer to !H|nt|fabsayc: i can accept 5@C also, but would bid 6 with marshall's example|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: what shouid west do tough ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S is a good spot|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: well, my concern was that W might look first and foremost at his spades over 5S|pg||
nt|woozle: more likely one or two overtricks in 2S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: he should not (since we have KCB)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the ancient idea was that asks for good trumps, not really necessary these days|pg||
nt|rogerclee: east offering up a huge number here|pg||
nt|woozle: Hmm...reverse flannery in action?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4S|nt|robinswr: 4spades is rkc|pg||
nt|redgrover: should be duplicated at the other table, this might come down to the last board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D was a phantom, but difficult to know|pg||
nt|sac: phanton save in open room|pg||
mb|5D|nt|imp_jan: i will suggest the hand for the bidding panel of my magazine (IMP)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was more than slam :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E bid according to the Lore of Total Tricks. The 2S raise was perhaps a bit adventurous at the colors. partner might easily end up bidding 4S to make and going down 500|pg||
mb|d|nt|santyclz: I'm told: he's been upgrading since he was 8. They say he missed his 1st slam at 16 :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 5 minutes of session time left|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a good one.  It's actually a version of what's called the Bridge World Nightmare Hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In the BWNH, you open 1@D on a strong hand, and partner responds in your 3-card major|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6 spades best?|pg||
nt|mildredb: at this point Yeh Bros stand 3 & China Long Ahu are tied for 8th|pg||
nt|gowdy: as we shall  see here 2@H is 54 10 hcp|pg||
nt|gowdy: better than passing it out !|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: McGann might have thrown this one in, for all the right reasons|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: nice treatment here 2NT ask for short suit trial  - i expect|pg||
nt|imp_jan: meanwhile another bidding problem here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Over 2 decades, it's never been solved|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3n = good|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but how to reach it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6 looks good|pg||
nt|salokin: yep or 6N with the @HK in the leaders hand :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: 4nt - 5nt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wow|pg||
nt|askgaard: Impossible not to bid 5@d here too with 5 card support|pg||
pc|cK|nt|robinswr: i play that 5nt shows the spade king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know entire structure, but  something like  15 teams qualify + Yeh Bros, then 2 brackets and sort of a double elimination|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Difficult from here|pg||
nt|rogerclee: yeah, i disagree with 2@S, though it is a good strategy to raise aggressively over an opponent's negative double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: vulnerability is for grownups|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that strategy pays off best, though, when there are TWO unbid majors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as in 1D-2C-D-3C|pg||
nt|shevek: since quite a few specs asked, I'll explain the format:|pg||
nt|shevek: Top 16 go through to the 32-board knockout stage, with the top 8 getting a double shot|pg||
nt|shevek: The 48-board final is on Monday|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: N is looking for D ki8ng now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|santyclz: A chance for Netherlands.|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect this will make|pg||
nt|redgrover: 3NT appears to be making on bd 8 at the other table, so the youth are still alive|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: just made   par for Ns again|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|frankaus: mannopo finds the killing lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well that lead certainly gives declarer a chance to go down.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gowdy: nice @s guess :)|pg||
nt|woozle: It was going to be guessed later anyway|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gowdy: and may come back if S thinks stiff Q|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: this could be interesting|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|santyclz: No winning options.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our matches in round 2 in about half an hour are: China B vs Norway and USA Hampson (Meckwell) vs Chinese Taipei|pg||
nt|shevek: 1st stage was a 10 round delayed Swiss of 10-board matches|pg||
nt|askgaard: He knows he is dead. Just hoping for a heart endplay at the end.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|robinswr: in an IMP match one should discuss what bids mean|pg||
nt|mittmouse: are the italians really last wow|pg||
pc|s2|nt|robinswr: in slam auctions|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What's the coroner say about this "dead" contract|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mmmakela: needs to guess clubs I suppose in 3rd trick?|pg||
nt|frankaus: cant draw trumps - cant not draw trumps - no winning options|pg||
nt|mildredb: now a little to-ing & fro-ing :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true, but even so, on what basis would S accept ANY grand slam try? could he have less?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Meckwell in 6@S, flirted with the grand|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|santyclz: I'm willing to make a prediction here.  This hand won't be finished before time is up.|pg||

pc|h5|nt|santyclz: Has to draw trumps and play for the @ckxx onside.|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe Lasut will duck 2 @C LOL|pg||
pc|h2|nt|santyclz: Needs the @d finesse or 5@ss and the @dk in the same hand.|pg||
nt|mildredb: or not :)|pg||
nt|askgaard: But in this layout it won't be there.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i think declarer needed to play top @S then 2nd round finesse|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: not exactly. it is not like you can preserve both possibilities. you will play for the diamond finesse, so it is 50% i think|pg||
nt|pbundy: well - with the club spots this might be safer route, actually|pg||
pc|dA|nt|frankaus: was a joke :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: true|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|robinswr: you would take the diamond finesse since anything else is anti percenage|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: but with 4-1 @C, not sure if that that works|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: 5@C has a better play, and would in fact have made (I think)|pg||

mb|4N!|an|quant|nt|imp_jan: 3n was in danger after the (unlikely) diamond lead|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but always made|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You'd think North would unleash a 5-card major probe, if South tends to open with a 6-card major :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The play is awkward for South.  He HAS to win a spade in dummy to take the heart finesse.  So what spade does he insert here?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: declarers problem is that if east comes in with @hk he might get diamonds through|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Great slam|pg||

pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: i think there is something to be said for 2D in response to 2C. it gives S a chance to make 2 natural rebids, and if you end of bidding diamonds twice naturally, that will take you ...|pg||

nt|Walddk4: I am pretty confident that Versace's pass is forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: this illustrates the problems with doubling an opening 1NT with a distributional hand -- you don't know what to do after that.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|askgaard: Right|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|askgaard: If they play takeout'ish doubles, east might have doubled because of the vulnerability|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kit: He might -- but he knows his partner will be expecting a second diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: and for all he knows they have a 9-card heart fit|pg||

nt|askgaard: A lot of work to do here.|pg||
nt|kit: even on actual hand, if East had doubled is it so clear for West to pass?  Why couldn't East's hearts and spades have been reversed?|pg||
nt|sac: you got a point Kit|pg||
nt|kit: Can he handle this -- 1 club trick, 1 spade trick, 2 diamond tricks, so he needs 6 trump tricks|pg||

pc|h6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, JoAnna could have pitched a club|pg||
nt|kit: joanna did well to pitch a spade it seems to me|pg||
nt|kit: But if he had led a spade, North can win, play ace and a heart, and declarer is a trick short|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But a diamond ruff now will see him home|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Because North must follow to the next club too|pg||
nt|sac: he is home now if he plays diamond and then ruff clubs|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: That's why a club pitch had been better before|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then JoAnna could have overruffed the last club|pg||
nt|kit: will overruffing the last club defeat the contract?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, then exit in trump and declarer must lose 2 spades|pg||
nt|kit: but can play a spade after second club ruff I believe|pg||
nt|sac: if you guess hearts you coul make 4 hearts by playing a spade from dummy instead of a diamond|pg||
nt|sac: early on|pg||
nt|kit: so I think declarer can succeed -- if North pitches a spade, do what he is doing.  If North pitches a club, then ruff another club and play a spade up?|pg||
