mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: just in time, Gabor|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: this is the final (4 teams) 3 matches 20 boards each|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: i think our operator is Krisztina|pg||
nt|cicus: szia Hedy, hello Vladimir|pg||
nt|pelu: X or bid 3@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: variable NT in NS|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|cicus: X may not be penalties anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H -- letting NS off the hook|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: Against the odds to make a move with the East cards in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: Guedes won the round robin and on yesterday 16-14 |pg||
nt|santyclz: An ugly 1nt with @cqj tight and no spots.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: if pd X 1NT - then X by u sh be penalty|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hedyg: would be a bloodbath|pg||
nt|athene: pushy 2@C here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Gad Chadha from England|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: I have a different agreement with my regular partner|pg||
nt|athene: not sure what east is planning to do if west unsportingly bids 2@D or 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Hi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and William FRisby, also from England|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: think 2@d 1 @c and 1 @h for 1 down|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: perhaps he has a way to sign off in 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Soucasaux is unstoppable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if that were  puppet.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: well even if penalty, it's not exactly clear-cut|pg||
nt|pelu: so we can bid free against u?|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol Peter|pg||
nt|cicus: no, we reopen with a X|pg||
nt|cicus: bid your shortest suit and you are saved|pg||
nt|pelu: u are forced to X gain? - then S can bid 2@S on a big hand!|pg||
nt|hedyg: if NT is 12-14 N must have A@c and K@H|pg||
nt|cicus: no we are not in a forcing situation after 1NT X|pg||
nt|cicus: rule is: don't pass if we may have game|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim 10?|pg||
nt|pelu: but then West has to take some action - he cant just wait and "hope" that pd we X again|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|nt|viren169: then I am a simple soul!|pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't bother looking for a 5-3 major fit with that west hand|pg||
nt|athene: N-S are likely to power into 4@H here|pg||
nt|santyclz: N's @ss are more valuable on offense than he anticipates.|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: 4333 and plenty of hcp|pg||
nt|athene: well, there are ways 4@H might make|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: after @SA lead, though, west can see the necessity of a fast diamond switch|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: when u X before the suit: X is values - when u X after the suit more penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: I agree|pg||
nt|athene: even if you find partner with a 5-card major there's no guarantee it will be better than 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3 @c asks for majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3nt No 5 card no 4 card major|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cicus: 2@D=any game force|pg||
nt|viren169: although if pd has 5233 shape 4@S may be better...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i don't see much downside to 3@C|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: 3@D = 2-3-5-3 - no 3 card @S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: now @DA and @D10 should fall out of his hand|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will surely play the clubs the right way, to protect the @SQx|pg||
nt|athene: lead @CA then @CJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: He will protect the @s Q so will guess @c|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|cicus: one way of two-way checkback|pg||
nt|xenya: may be an exact tie after this board|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|hedyg: easy @c lead and 10 tricks or will he shift to @H?|pg||

pc|s5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|viren169: nice play|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cicus: not now, S encouraged clubs|pg||

pc|s6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: just in case south has a singleton @DJ/@D10|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: three discards are no use; the club finesse can't be avoided|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|pelu: no - 2Nt is also 2-3-5-3 - but a bad @D-suit|pg||
nt|athene: then the layout is revealed and you can take the finesse|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: Depends on agreement|pg||

nt|viren169: if 5@S was making... 5@C would have gone for 800!|pg||
nt|irwinbo: these are four top notch international players|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bobdrijver: will it end here or is it still forcing?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

pc|s2|nt|bobdrijver: Operator?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ht blockag her theyve been waned off playing in spades |pg||
nt|lestergold: well ican see a route to 8 gtricks|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: NT might be as bad as spades though|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 9th looks elusive from here|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: 8 tricks/|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: ?|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: south has an entry for the @H , so making 4@H , 1@C and 1@S ?|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: 1@D that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: well for sure this is not making question is 1 or two off|pg||
nt|salokin: The swedes use a interesting handevaluation methodes. They counted ZZ points where A=3 K=2 Q=1|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: first board a push, e/w netherlands balanced to 3@C for down 2 and -100|pg||
nt|salokin: in there relay methodes 1@H promise a hand with 5+ ZZ and no shortage|pg||
nt|lestergold: but th hearts have to be unravelled which we can see is possible because south does have two entries|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: i played chinese taipei using that as well, they called it RP :)|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|c8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: because he went for @H after the SOS RDBL|pg||

nt|viren169: nice competitive hand now|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C P 1@H now east should bid 2@D i think|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cicus: 14 board match is starting|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: when it comes to overcalling, a good suit compensates for anything|pg||
nt|viren169: or 3@D... not for the faint-hearted!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|santyclz: X or 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: of course if north just bids 3nt that might shut east out :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: No chance...|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S looks normal to me|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: if you are 2-3-4-4  you open 1@C and rebid 3@D over 2@D to show that shape|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1@C - then u bid 3@D on 2-3-4-4, and 2NT on 2-3-3-5 and bad suit, 3@C on an good suit|pg||
nt|viren169: North saw it coming!|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT Jordan, showing a sound raise to 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sensible bid from west|pg||
nt|athene: with 5-loser hand|pg||
nt|athene: nothing to the play:- one trick to lose in each major|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how anyone can be considering doing anything over 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D sorry|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|athene: the thing about bashing 3nt in here is, you don't especially want to shut out east from mentioning a long suit|pg||
nt|athene: because he is on lead anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: small diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|vugraphzkc: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Sry for the delay (connection problems)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: this is the north final championship, final 4 3 matches 20 boards each|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: so cannot differentiate between 2 3 4 4 and 2 2 4 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2245 is not a balanced hand|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@C then 3@D looks 2245 to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's semi-balanced|pg||
nt|pelu: no I dont like to open 1NT with 2-2 i major|pg||
nt|hedyg: you would not bid 1NT after 1@C-1@s?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: interesting that both north players doubled|pg||
nt|santyclz: N could be considering a x on the empirical unlikelihood of 1 side making 11 tricks on any given hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, small diamond was definitely preferable with no entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: agree not the best lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a different auction perhaps top diamond correct|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here next to zero chance north has only 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: true, 11 tricks is a lot|pg||
mb|6H|nt|athene: 3nt shows a very balanced hand for most people so East knows it's overwhelmingly unlikely N-S have 2-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: now declarer can succeed by playing on hearts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer is likely to put east with a top heart though|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: since otherwise why not a small diamond lead? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: think he will play for @c...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so he might decide to pin his hopes on the clubs behaving|pg||
nt|viren169: normal to play on clubs and d1|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: yes - and have to tell "a story" after 2@D - but no system get 100%|pg||
nt|cicus: @D6 was Smith - don't like clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: N considering a @S switch?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt like any switch|pg||
nt|xenya: which might save a trick if S has AK|pg||
nt|xenya: as it is, it gives an overtrick it seems |pg||

mb|p|nt|chip: 2D is the normal response with hearts, but could be a weak hand I think.|pg||

nt|viren169: looks like E/W have been brushed aside |pg||
mb|5C!|an|exclusion|mb|p|mb|5S!|mb|p|nt|bobdrijver: Drijver-Brink use a weak NT 1st/2nd hand NV  10-12|pg||
nt|chip: Would guess 5C is exclusion blackwood, seems an OK gamble, but not a success if South's minors were reversed.|pg||
mb|5N!|mb|p|nt|viren169: in hearts?|pg||
nt|chip: So 5S shows 2 keycards outside clubs, no trump Q (5N looking for kings I would guess)|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|7H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: club switch needed immediately|pg||
nt|salokin: the swedes do the same|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and hes fouind it of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobdrijver: @C switch in time|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs to duck this|pg||
nt|chip: If 5N promises all controls and heart Q, S can bid 7 with source of tricks in spades (maybe 6S suggests this?)|pg||
nt|irwinbo: vwd|pg||
nt|viren169: well done...|pg||
nt|chip: So a successful conclusion.|pg||

nt|athene: so he will choose between double and 1@S i guess :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps Macskásy could have bid 5@H en route rather than punt 6@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW bidding @Hs helps S|pg||
nt|cicus: after 2@H here @CQ is a favourite to score|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It did not in the CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: careful pass by W|pg||
nt|xenya: but you don't really bid grand missing the trump Q?|pg||
nt|cicus: no but if the auction is crowded you can't pay attentiom to nuances|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Vladimir, but N could have had it but with no chance to raise when partner jumps to 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS not a regular partnership, is 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|xenya: true, Roland|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S is forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: without agreements 2@S is surely forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a method for showing this hand after 2@S opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|pelu: diff bid in N - has to bid 3@C - but pd will take is as a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need an agreement if it's not|pg||
nt|viren169: now 6 will be easy when (if) diamonds is found as second suit|pg||
nt|athene: now south has to do something|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south assumes he is facing only five spades, so will probably ask for the @SQ |pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like S is just going to bash it out...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes 4nt aces for @s and 5 @h asks @s Q|pg||
nt|santyclz: Make a @s a @h and he has a textbook Bramley x.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pelu: 3@H by S|pg||
nt|hedyg: time to cuebid|pg||
nt|hedyg: prefer 3@H|pg||
nt|cicus: is this not risky?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C won't lead anywhere|pg||
nt|cicus: I mean 4@C|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure 3@H agrees clubs|pg||
nt|cicus: Szalay will convert to 4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c normally orkc...|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@D from N (reverse) sh promise 1 bid more|pg||
nt|athene: does that get him into a Bramley Jam?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|hedyg: but in this sequence..|pg||
nt|cicus: ORKC idf forcing...|pg||
nt|xenya: hope they know what they are doing...|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S reached in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with the @SQ and nothing else, north would just bid 6@S, so 6@H shows extras|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|pelu: a jump to 6@C (in my system) = 2 Aces plus a void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know what ORKC is, but you had better explain. Many in the audience don't know I'm sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: orkc= option roman keycard|pg||
nt|cicus: Optional Roman Key.Card asking for aces|pg||
nt|cicus: optional, because it also asks about strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT....|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: 1st step agrees to slam, if other bid than 1st step then dont want slam but show number of keycards|pg||
nt|cicus: 1st step usually weak hand and other responses show aces|pg||
nt|pelu: on 4Nt I jump in the void-suit if lover that trumfp - and jump to 6 in your suit if higher|pg||
nt|viren169: whay 6@H and not 6@C?|pg||
nt|athene: but south, not being able to see all the hands and knowing there's a keycard missing, has no grand slam ambitions|pg||
nt|athene: south can't have been happy about passing throughout|pg||
nt|athene: but he didn't have any convenient bid|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|athene: perhaps north is worried that 6@C might be taken as his second suit|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: i would probably risk 3@D over 2@S|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Sousa Guedes won the round Robein|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Robin|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cicus: maybe Hedy's version is more popular|pg||
nt|athene: showing extra length/strength there|pg||
nt|viren169: North passed at the other table, and drove to slame via RKCB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps 6 of a minor would offer a choice of slams|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: time to claim|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzkc: they all play pretty natural in this room|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: I don't think many play it|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: in Hungary they do|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: double was also possible if t/o|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzkc: Ribeiro is a "new team" on these finals|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: but usually without special agreement, if you pass over a suit then later double, partner is going to assume it's penalties|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: as with a t/o double you could have acted the first time|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: On 21 the Dutch bid to the superior grand slam, 7@C, but lost 2 IMPs as a result. Bridge isn't fair|pg||
nt|viren169: not sure about the 1@D bid|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: the natural lead here will see this contract quickly defeated|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Possibly Hedy, but there is a world outside Hungary :)|pg||

nt|athene: lol east in the other room doubled :)|pg||
nt|athene: no-one was prepared to grit his teeth and pass with an opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if i held the south hand and partner opened a 15-17 nt i would bid 3nt and wish him lots of luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Hi |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt|pg||

nt|fabsayc: less clear now|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|viren169: a little pushy but it is imps after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would certainly bid 2@S with west's hand over 1@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nobody seems to assume x's are penalty any more.|pg||
nt|athene: it worries opps when you bid their suits|pg||
nt|athene: and it usually works out just fine|pg||
nt|athene: as long as you have a decent suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: in theory south has more room now but that might not be a bonus if he hasn't discussed these sequences|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: X for penalty, but I dont exp that S will accept - 4@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H problematic here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Budapest a great city. Buda on one side, Pest on the other side of the river Donau|pg||
nt|cicus: or vice versa|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt keeps things simple|pg||
nt|athene: south has a stopper in the unbid suit|pg||
nt|athene: but it's one of the BID suits which will be the problem|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzkc: and now what?|pg||
nt|athene: if you start with double, you have to know what all your follow-up actions are|pg||
nt|viren169: good lead|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: hehe|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Ed.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: howdy all!|pg||
nt|othered1: Assume the 1@S bid is essentially a forcing NT response|pg||
nt|santyclz: Marrku.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 1 @s is 0-4 @s forcing one round|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or else a great vul vs not psyche.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: 4@SX in CR, E overcalled...2@s|pg||
nt|athene: when you have one suit with an ace and one without, it's normal to lead the non-ace suit, but it's also normal to prefer a 5-card suit, so east had a close decision there i think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond shift now|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... I would have lead a @S... |pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes and declearer has to go for ! s first I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: @s I mean|pg||
pc|c2|nt|viren169: although the 9@H is great card to have in that holding|pg||
nt|viren169: not a good switch|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: u have 4 toptrick and need 6 tricks on cross-ruff - not a big problem|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|othered1: north's rebid says no psyche, even if we didn't have an accurate explanation given to us :)|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer cant be ducking with AKTx? Can (s)he|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: he|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: was there an upside in that duck?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: part score hand now|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|salokin: @H lead or switsch after @C A seems to beat 4@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobdrijver: if declarer had A10 and an @D entry|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: but hard to tell if that all was worth it|pg||
nt|lestergold: arguably brink should have got out of the way with his ace of clubs immediately|pg||
nt|salokin: or S not grapping his @C A|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: same auction both rooms.|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 1NT = 15-16|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: 1n the most difficult of all contracts to defend in my experience|pg||
nt|viren169: 9 tricks on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|chip: likely to be a push.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bobdrijver: all eyes on west now|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs to grab that dim ace and switch to that heart at the speed of light|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bobdrijver: very hard though|pg||
nt|lestergold: should lose a trick in each suit if defence get it righjt|pg||
nt|salokin: ducking would let it thru|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: could be costly in a lot of ways, could be giving up a @D ruff or a @H trick|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: though the @C seem dangerous anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed not easy not obvious|pg||
nt|salokin: no because there is no fast entrie to dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: but on balance with theodds i think with that threatening club holding in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: north is likely to be short in clubs a heart trick is surely best hope of  a setting trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: a better bet than playing north for 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|shevek: ducking still ok|pg||
nt|salokin: even @D A and @D will not let it thru|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bobdrijver: 1@C showing 15+ ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|salokin: 16+ I think but shapely lower counts are allowed|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: Bertens let 4@S make in the other room|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: leading @C ace and another|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh unexpected|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: so another 12 heading to sweden|pg||
nt|salokin: tried for a ruff ...|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|bobdrijver: they go off to a good start|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: High standard game when both sides bid the grand on those values.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|salokin: most difficult part of the game is to know when to active and when passive ... aspecially in defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: releasing unsupported ace at trick 1 blind not always best|pg||
nt|chip: unfortunately for Sweeden winning 1's and 2's but losing 10,11,12 is not a good trade.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: usually a panic lead|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|salokin: here probably a normal "overboarding"|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: Bertens also one of the more creative though very accurate most of the time|pg||
nt|chip: Some work to do for NS even with 3-3 clubs. good start for the defense (despite the 2H bid).|pg||
nt|viren169: good lead...|pg||
nt|chip: likely declarer needs to guess the diamonds (lead low towards the JT and then finesse if W pops Q).|pg||
nt|chip: They did play diamonds as suggested in the other room (after the same lead).|pg||
nt|viren169: 4 round of clubs is probably best|pg||
pc|h6|nt|salokin: without the 2@C bid they would be able to stop in 2@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w not surprisingly too high here|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|chip: Well started diamonds correctly, but with a good duck by W might go wrong (deciding to play for something else).|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: helped by brink's intyerference|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: Open room Bertens opening a 20-21NT and super accepting the transfer, so will most likely be another 3 imps to sweden|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1 off on top could be more maybe|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u if south plays a club now...it could go wrong for defence|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: brink is in tank for good reason|pg||

nt|athene: diamond guess to make 6@S here|pg||

nt|viren169: better than a guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 1@H-1NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if Szalay passes|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H 1@S 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: now west might just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: with 7 running tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I guess a discussion is taking place right now|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: N/S might be in trouble here|pg||
nt|santyclz: The usual Ghestem result.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|santyclz: Pass before the x'ing starts.|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, EW have some points and fit, but not much anything makes, not even stop on a dime 2@H in open room|pg||
nt|athene: the auction is likely to start 1@C 1@S (2@H) X support and north can conceal the diamond side-suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: E does not want to pass nor does he want to encourage, goes the middle road|pg||
nt|pelu: why 1NT????? - do they play 1@S/1NT reversed?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s was an option as well?|pg||
nt|pelu: the middle road ? 1Nt = no road :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, they play 1NT f1 and he doesnt want to show @s, just a weak @H fit|pg||
nt|xenya: i would have seriously considered a pass as E|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6 losers, 2@d is enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: x means 3 @s support|pg||
mb|2C|an|drury|nt|athene: perhaps exclusion now|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: facing two non-heart keycards you are happy to have a shot at 7@S|pg||
nt|athene: exclusion keycard is usually a jump to something above 4nt|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting lead coming up for East...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: here, N-S have the room to employ it at a lower level - IF they have agree this sort of thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: *agreed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H splinter for me, but can continue with 5@H void|pg||
nt|athene: this is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north wins @SK and switches to a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: east has to duck but now south can switch back to a club|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: playing artificial reverses?|pg||
nt|othered1: this can be a very large swing 12 imps or more.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: seems good lead by W (for them...)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cicus: 2@S prpbably game forcing without spades|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: i don't think this auction is really getting to grips with the hand|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we know what 4@S showed?|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence come to diamond, 2 clubs, and 2 spades|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S must be artificial game force?|pg||
nt|cicus: not sure about that|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cicus: one of my advisors says it is 17-18 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was just natural i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S was signoff, i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: he assumed 4@H was a splinter, either singleton or void|pg||
nt|viren169: I think N is living dangerously!|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't have anything|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|xenya: abot what W actually has|pg||
pc|sK|nt|santyclz: N didn't keep a low @d?|pg||
nt|viren169: .either red suit will allow Declarer to claim quickly|pg||
nt|athene: north would have been better-off just bidding 5@H over 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart lead 12 with no guess|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I agree|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have heart void, great hand, but neither minor-suit ace"|pg||
nt|athene: and hence must have solid trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: they got it there anyway ...|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|cicus: but then I can't understand 3@D - why not pass 2NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so E could have pulled the brakes in 3@H|pg||
nt|viren169: anyone for stone age 2@S over 1@C?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: unfortunately this should go 2 off|pg||
nt|athene: east did well to lead a trump, i think|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to just hope his partner has the @DA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzkc: yes sry|pg||
nt|athene: he knows a heart lead might well give declarer a free @HAQ finesse|pg||
nt|athene: (west didn't double 5@H to show an honour, and north is void)|pg||
nt|athene: and if north is void in hearts he has length in one or other minor so a minor-suit lead could solve his side-suit problems|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is a 2@S bid, will wait awhile to use that bid again|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer should get it right in the end... considering East bid 2@H |pg||
nt|athene: i don't mind a strong jump shift response with north's hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C - 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes. Declarer as to guess but he will|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't supposed to use the bid on a 2-suiter but north can happily just treat that hand as a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|athene: but probably they don't play strong jump shifts - no-one seems to, these days|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... bets to treat it as single (solid) suiter|pg||
nt|viren169: works v nicely on this hand!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Neves is thinking|pg||
nt|viren169: also 6@S in the open room... but A@D lead.|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|viren169: especially as he had no opposition bidding!|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|lestergold: he cant double with two small hearts he cnt raise clubs with 3 and he cant bid a 4 card dim suit at 2 level he could pass of course but then a lot of pressure on partner|pg||
nt|chip: yes, normal and they got there. Cards friendly so hard to go down, but not obvious to declarer.|pg||

nt|chip: not so easy for declarer now. maybe ruff a club, heart up.|pg||
nt|irwinbo: he can make it hook the ten of hearts|pg||
nt|chip: also, club ruff, heart to king, two spades to throw a club, heart up.|pg||
nt|irwinbo: yes even better|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: switching between a spade and a club at the top of his hand|pg||
nt|chip: Well, better when spades aren't two on your left.|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe 3 rounds of spades earlier wasnt so bad pitching a diamond even if 3rd round gets ruffed!|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|viren169: now it's getting a little uncomfortable for declarer.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i must admit that is what i would have done|pg||
nt|viren169: now a heart to the K|pg||
nt|chip: I think declarer's line was reasonable. If N had the club ace it would have been much better.|pg||
nt|chip: To lead a club up.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|salokin: the @D opening from fredin in OR get them to 3@D|pg||

mb|1N|nt|athene: i think it's close between pass, double and 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: depends on style and partnership trust...|pg||
nt|athene: if you are ever going to open a weak-2 with a 7-card suit, that north hand is when you should do it, i think|pg||

nt|athene: well cashing the @HA finds the second spade loser :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|cicus: with 5 weak hearts and 4 clubs they overcall 1NT  I think|pg||

nt|athene: you knock out the @DA then you have 3-3 in either minor or various squeezes|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: yes...|pg||
mb|3C!|an|puppet|nt|othered1: west just might go right here.  East's 4@C bid shows decent length, I'd assume|pg||
nt|ady: 1 diamond and 1 spade loser in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk5: N-S never bid in the other room|pg||
nt|othered1: a cautious 5@C, perhaps fearing 4@S would be 5=5 black?|pg||

nt|hedyg: was waiting for opps to play in @s or rebid @d|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unless you pitch a @s on the @ds.|pg||
nt|athene: you don't open 1@C with 55 in the minors, just so you can reverse :)|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead will make things easy|pg||
nt|athene: you look at the @D9 and claim 12 :)|pg||
nt|athene: west might reason as follows:- 1) declarer has spades |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: and then he went from dreaming to the real world :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2) dummy has hearts|pg||
nt|athene: 3) partner didn't double 3@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: You called it.|pg||
nt|athene: 4) i'll lead a diamond!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: i see it is usual to open 1@d with 4-4 minors in Hungary|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: suicide is not painless|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south has no excuse for 5 over 5|pg||
nt|viren169: you dont open 5-5 in the minors even if you have a reverse!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: where is Roland?|pg||
nt|pelu: is that normal, Gabor?|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, that is standard|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|ady: was south worried about 6 clubs   otherwise should surely go to 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: For a start I think South has an opener|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|pelu: even with a bad @D and good @C - no lead-directing?|pg||
nt|viren169: this could be a telephone number!|pg||

nt|Walddk5: No South opened|pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1: Open room looks like confusion over rebids after a reverse|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: hardest for declarer would be a major-suit lead, and the @DQ then @D to the @DK both ducked|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||

nt|jtr: and a passed partner|pg||
nt|jtr: The lure of being vulnerable|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Close decision for Paul.|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: But with @ss bid on his left he should pass|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good point|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|bobdrijver: south did not open at the other table which resulted in west opening 1@C and rebidding 3@C and he gets to play that|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|chip: further relays.|pg||

mb|3N!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: What, in 'po-s'?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and these disciplined oppos didnt provide the help|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: ns upside down carding|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: spec is correct|pg||

nt|viren169: Nicely done by declarer!|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt E-W here, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C 1@H X Pass 1NT should end it, i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Stopping in 6 is good evaluation if you're going to play @hs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: N doubled in CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: and they stopped in 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: upgrade to 1nt opener is reasonable enough|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cicus: bold|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that's true|pg||
nt|othered1: With a student it could start 2@C - 3@D (6-card suit with at least an honor trick in it) plus side K or more.  Gets relatively easy after that, though the @CQ might be hard to ...|pg||
nt|othered1: find.  This for play in @D or NT on slam hand|pg||
nt|athene: majors or spades from south now|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... 1N-3N for me|pg||
nt|athene: unless he passes, sulking, after the previous board|pg||
nt|viren169: assuming South passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: west not sulking|pg||
nt|athene: well, whatever south does, west will probably just bid the same 3nt he was going to anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C=majors or single suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: single suit|pg||
nt|viren169: West may find out 1st before bidding 3N... as South is on lead|pg||
nt|athene: so both pairs playing Capp|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double by west?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|hedyg: 2NT is not jacoby, it is invite +|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: If South has hearts he can bid 3@H to avoid losing 5 heart tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: prefer pass and see what happens|pg||
nt|athene: win in dummy, diamond to the @D8 perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: win in dummy and low to diamond nine?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@c was minimum|pg||
nt|cicus: and he accepted...|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes he accepted his own invitation|pg||
nt|pelu: and when pd sh minimum with 3@C - where did he find values for game??|pg||
nt|cicus: exactly :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: thinks he needs imps..|pg||
nt|viren169: duck a diamonds seems like a good play?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cicus: yes, after this board|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|othered1: I must leave for a bit.  Thanks all and bye!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Thanks, bye|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is, the hearts aren't quite so secure that you are happy about esoteric safety plays in diamonds|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|xenya: well it makes now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cicus: great lead|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead the defence have four hearts and @CAQ to cash |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: now north can kill the diamonds however|pg||
nt|athene: no chance now|pg||
nt|viren169: this may go poorly now...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: declarer was hoping to snag a stiff diamond honour with south|pg||
nt|athene: but probably, on balance, small diamond to the @D8 was best - it's very unlikely they can cash four hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@H dbled went 2-off on the last in the other room...|pg||
nt|viren169: the T and 9 seems like hugh cards... |pg||
nt|athene: assuming declarer plays three rounds of diamonds|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|cicus: now @HQ is sure to score|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm how do you beat it now?|pg||
nt|xenya: a mundane would have beaten it easily|pg||
nt|cicus: (famous last words)|pg||
nt|cicus: of course he could not lead a diamond in front of the eyes of 1500 spectators :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: Homannay knows Szalay..|pg||
nt|xenya: a mundane @D i meant|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|ady: 3@H ok here    3@s   looks like down 1|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|hedyg: now forcing declarer to play K@H|pg||
nt|cicus: now show a high @D as well|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cicus: the problem is that if his @H was single, why did he not X 1@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: what happened?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h6|nt|athene: finesse @S10 and throw @SA on @D is a flashy sort of play|pg||
nt|athene: but it doesn't really help very much|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cute|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzkc: probably Pinto should have bid it...|pg||
nt|ady: I think east might have competed with 3@H    |pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
nt|viren169: I think declarer played South for singleton honor or 2-2|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: it just means south can't play spades|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: but there are plenty of other things for the defence to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: no he can't|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: now|pg||
nt|athene: right :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|viren169: noone has any spades to play!|pg||
nt|athene: south discards the @SJ as a safety play against accidentally pulling the wrong card later in the hand and giving declarer entry to dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|viren169: 6@H could become a trick!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Pass of 2@d was the winner.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: 2@C was puppet stayman, so 2@D didn't deny a 4-card major, so east had to press on|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H in other room so looks like flat|pg||

nt|chip: And this board won't change that.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|shevek: promising values|pg||
pc|c6|nt|brolucius: 3NT makes with the heart position.|pg||

nt|shevek: still.... hmmm|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: and well defended for 500|pg||
nt|salokin: agressive 3@H probably 3@D was a positive (using a kind of lebensohl)|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: first major gain for the netherlands it seems|pg||
nt|shevek: good chance to make it though|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: lead "thirds/fifths"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: major gain? I think he will score 400|pg||
nt|shevek: I'm with you Roland :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: if west's reopening double shows extra values i wouldc want to defend at this vulnerabilitywith the east hand rather than struggle in a dodgy 3N|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: ah maybe yes, not counting many tricks but playing 5 times @S makes life harder for defense|pg||
nt|salokin: not easy to play |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jtr: well timed 3@d bid by Bertens|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://members.optusnet.com.au/ yeh2009/  for webcam with autorefresh every 45 seconds. The camera is in this room|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chip: spade shift would put this in some danger.|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|po-s: what counts is when board is finished (see Roland slams)|pg||
nt|jtr: Not easy even in 3@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: That webcam picture is good.|pg||
nt|jtr: Will pitch @hs on the @ds|pg||
nt|jtr: But how to play the @cs|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer is awkwardly placed now|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: 1@D = no major?? - or is E just bluffing?|pg||

nt|cicus: they have checkback for majors|pg||
nt|hedyg: walsh type 1NT bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H or @s by E would show a distributional hand|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told Walsh - so West bid an 4 card major before @D - but then 1@D sh be alerted|pg||
nt|cicus: tough lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: they all play it...|pg||
nt|ady: this should be 1 down    |pg||
nt|mmmakela: like in poker, the 1st better has the advantage|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cicus: if you don't play wash in Hungary you'll be not allowed in high society|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|athene: 3NT by north would be the best chance for game|pg||
nt|athene: this looks pretty hopeless|pg||

pc|c6|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|hedyg: lol Gabor|pg||
nt|athene: only two obvious losers (@CK @HA) but nothing like 11 winners|pg||
nt|athene: just @D @D @H to lose|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: if you ruff enough hearts the @C10 grows up for the defence's third trick|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe the operator missed it|pg||
nt|cicus: sometimes they get sloppy with their alerts|pg||
nt|hedyg: or maybe they have done so earlier and now opps know so no need to keep alerting the same bid|pg||
nt|santyclz: I have to confess I don't understand the 3@s bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: pessanha is thinking... (can I have any chance on winning....) does´t seems so|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cicus: best return|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s3|nt|athene: a trump back now and declarer has to just concede two heart tricks|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Was @H2 systemic? I thought they play 4th|pg||

nt|patricck: declarer has to pick the spades right first to even get that far of course|pg||
nt|jtr: maybe 3&5 in bid suits?|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: all trying to work out how to get to 7 !|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: drijver went to toilet |pg||
mb|1D!|nt|brolucius: No great lengths required to prove me wrong, usually. |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobdrijver: need exclusion at low level so the other hand can do it as well :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|irwinbo: 3nt should come home if they bid it|pg||

nt|patricck: sent to his room without any supper to "think about what he did? "  :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean 4 dims to the k offside might not be very easy to handle|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|lestergold: defence here not that easy to cash their 4 tricks has to be a dim lea i think|pg||

nt|salokin: 4 Tricks costing lead :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: push|pg||
nt|cicus: 9 IMPs for 2 boards|pg||
nt|ady: would haved mazde the contract if he had run 9@H  when notg covered|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes it seems so|pg||
nt|ady: could not be closer|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 to go?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3NT by N/S here I think|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D, double, pass - now what will West do?|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|hedyg: CR in 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but this seems like a pretty dull 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is better than 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: what would they say is the bid by N?|pg||
nt|athene: N-S might get to 4@S here|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|santyclz: 2@c if playing inverted.|pg||
nt|ady: 28 ots   and 3NT in jeopardy on a spade lead    can make with hearts well played and breaking|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 2 @c is inverted minors|pg||
nt|ady: placed|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: bingo|pg||
nt|viren169: redbl|pg||
nt|athene: probably 2@S |pg||
nt|athene: if west passed the double, then north might redouble yes|pg||
nt|athene: of course east has to actually double for any of this to become relevant :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: come on, east!|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt shows that north is going to rebid 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: showing a 3-card limit raise|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|athene: west is a few diamond spots short of a pass, i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: results after 1sr match: Henriques - 19; Guedes - 16;  Ribeiro - 14; Matos - 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: matos - 11|pg||
nt|viren169: I think West will bid 2/3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: much better|pg||
nt|hedyg: most of all because it makes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so can 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: and with a 14 count south will bid game over that|pg||
nt|santyclz: Probably a 3@s rebid.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|viren169: dont like the diamond pips|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oops, too slow.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: interesting rebid, 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: light, very light 2 @s by Pinto|pg||
nt|santyclz: Please check that, Pedro.|pg||
nt|ady: gone wrong|pg||
nt|viren169: 3N is an interesting contract!|pg||
nt|athene: lovely lead problem for north now|pg||
nt|athene: clearly he can't lead spades, hearts, diamonds or clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: @C lead?|pg||
nt|athene: i like this :) not a bad choice|pg||
nt|viren169: great lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: he went out of table:)|pg||
nt|viren169: will South put the Q or the T in?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: vs 4@H i meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: is correct|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: some work to do here for sure|pg||
nt|santyclz: Don't lead trump.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: No problem|pg||
nt|athene: well played Von hafe|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think declarer has time to do everything|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: You win the second club, cash 1 high heart and play 3 rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: wow... West did well!|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: he wants to finesse spades and set up diamonds|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think only on a trump lead.|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence will be able to get two hearts and a club going|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: W thinks...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: maybe the lead was so long in coming....|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: now not only did he get that right but he knows north's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: not that much|pg||
nt|athene: better not to waste the dummy entry on playing a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: you can lead diamonds from either hand, but spades only from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: ducking at trick 1 had to be better|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: got a @s lead|pg||
nt|athene: it's a hand with no appealing suit to lead from - so an unsupported honour in every suit|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|athene: to preserve the options in clubs - club ruff or use @CA as entry to winning diamonds|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: east can't attack hearts - if he leads the @HK you duck|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|ady: mayh go wrong|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: so an imp to the trailing team|pg||
nt|cicus: it all boils down to Gamax needing a big swing in the last board to save the match|pg||
nt|hedyg: and it is a swingy board|pg||
pc|d2|nt|viren169: If I were North I would hold my cards up!|pg||
nt|santyclz: -2 now.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ady: still can make|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: it will guess wrong due to the "s bid I think|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: north has to drop the @CA (the card he is known to hold) so that west doesn't know he can ruff another club with impunity|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: they are on different sides of the cortine|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Don't ask the English cricketers to take the N-S seats|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: That will vost 17 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: cost even|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: is "cortine"?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: correct?|pg||
nt|athene: errr not a word i have heard before :)|pg||
nt|athene: curtain? partition? screen?|pg||
nt|viren169: In that case I would put them in my pocket!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: you that think put in the middle of the tble so pds don't see each other|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: ah right usually called "screen" i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: screen thats it sory|pg||
nt|athene: no worries|pg||
nt|viren169: I've heard of a lot of stories... but one I heard the other day made me laugh!|pg||

nt|jtr: should help|pg||
nt|salokin: yep with long @S known to be in dummy for discards it is a case for an aktive lead|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: short break for the moment|pg||
nt|sybarra: trying |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: game on|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|chip: again a 2 IMP swing to sweeden, but they need more.|pg||
mb|1S|an|alerted|mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|brolucius: The Hacketts have not enjoyed an inspired session and will count themselves lucky if they (somehow) manage to survive. |pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: making 4@S would be a serious blow to England, going down would leave the match hanging very much in the balance|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont think he can go down|pg||
nt|salokin: a 10! - 12 NT here this allways seems only need 9 nowadays|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lestergold: 2c for the majors i assume|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: What was 1S? looks natural.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|Walddk2: But the consolation is that the loser will get another chance tomorrow|pg||
nt|brolucius: Do you promise that?|pg||
nt|lestergold: wil they find the heart fit?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: he pointed to it-not sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: could have 5+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: can misguess the clubs|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk4: It is now safe to congratulate the Netherlands on reaching the Yeh Bros Cup final. The Swedes will get another chance in a triangle to be played in 55 minutes (32 boards)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 6@c Roland?|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: brink will not accept this i expect|pg||
nt|chip: odd to alert that.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: yes 3h played by north not vulnerable to a club lead which would finish 4h straight away if played by south|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: assuming that they bid game on everything, accepting invite in their style is hardcore|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: well bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h should not present a challenge|pg||
nt|lestergold: but they have the vlues to be in 4 not laydown but should be in it|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: and with 17 boards to go its almost tied again|pg||
nt|salokin: without EW bidding it is probably normal to reach the doomed @H game|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho it went off in open|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jtr: of course:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Silly question really|pg||
nt|jtr: Bit good for you?|pg||
nt|lestergold: is it necessarily doomed?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The Dutch will get the afternoon off|pg||
nt|chip: I'm told it might be a 3 card suit.|pg||
nt|irwinbo: in the old days wedidn't open 4333 aceless 12 counts  now!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry typo  4+  but they specifically mark it in their convention card|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobdrijver: yes|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C is laydown and very good (by my standards)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: Did they not bid that??|pg||
nt|jtr: Very odd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Great opportunity for England|pg||
nt|imp_jan: lay down?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jtr: But you have to play the squeeze not the finesse|pg||
nt|chip: They might bid 1S on 3 to rightside NT I hear.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|salokin: at least with a @S lead and @C switch|pg||
nt|chip: declarer can make 3 now. Club shift or lead would put even 2 in danger.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Yes Jan, a contract that can make is laydown|pg||
nt|jtr: But on VG you always play the squeeze|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: @D lead also still|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: definitely in that case|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: not anymore though i think|pg||
nt|salokin: but also with @S to the A and @S back fredin couldnt make|pg||
nt|lestergold: but spade lead wasnt particularly marked|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: indeed|pg||
pc|c3|nt|imp_jan: well if u put it that way, yes :)|pg||
nt|po-s: what other way is there Jan?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: a contract that only requires one misdefence is sound?|pg||
nt|salokin: probably missguessing the @H situation|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|chip: guess he still needs to take the correct pointed suit finesse for his 8th trick.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|imp_jan: i am content that bertens-bakkeren reached game|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: I think it has 9.14% of making. That's not too bad. Just ask Geoffrey Wolfarth whose 7@C rolled in some years ago. It was a 1.5% shot|pg||
nt|po-s: 3NT on the other hand....|pg||
nt|jtr: yes, 3NT was hardly perfect|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Geoffrey's grand required 3 finesses, a break and @HQ doubleton|pg||
nt|jtr: But maybe better than 5@c?|pg||
nt|brolucius: There has not been much luck involved in the 33-3 scoreline. The Dutch have played well.|pg||
nt|mwigor: that sounds worse than 1.5%|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: well ten trickslooking likely on this defence|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobdrijver: both team made a come back in the previous round|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: netherlands doing it within the 16 boards here again|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Was roughly 1.5% according to David Burn|pg||
nt|jtr: hmmmm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S rolled in on 28|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Uphill struggle now for England|pg||
nt|po-s: anyway, 3NT will go down - sorry, looks like it will...|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|chip: declarer is throwing diamonds, that is good for him.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: thank you all for joining and for your comments. we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|athene: east has a solid double of 1@H|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|xenya: swingy hand indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H is some decision at this point|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@C is easy as the cards lie|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North in the CR did the same|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt E-W here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well at the 3/4 mark it's till anyone's game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: E in CR bd 6@c over 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jackpot|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the last board of this session.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: no 20 boards|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: (still)|pg||
mb|1N!|an|relay |nt|viren169: 3N or 4@S E/W way anyone?|pg||
nt|athene: now west will probably go 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|athene: or, of course, 3nt :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: Pinto bid is that: just bid what think u can make |pg||
nt|athene: most likely it will make four spades, two hearts, @CAK , @DA|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|hedyg: now might get too high|pg||
nt|cicus: what is 4NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't matter; they need to bid 7 anyway to overtake|pg||
nt|santyclz: I fearlessly predict a @c lead.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|Walddk2: whether it makes or not is irrelevant when they are in 6 next door|pg||
nt|athene: well, @CA lead beat 4@S as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 3@S by West to show 3?|pg||
nt|athene: heart lead to @HK, another heart...declarer comes to the @CA and leads @SQ, covered|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ady: can escape down 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|Walddk2: So 7@C is the right call|pg||
nt|Walddk2: given the SOTM|pg||
nt|xenya: can it be made?|pg||
nt|viren169: now 3N...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|xenya: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: or yes?|pg||
nt|cicus: no only 11 tricks without giving up a diamond|pg||
nt|xenya: reverse dummy plus squeeze against S dfoesn't works as there are no entries to the W hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to my excellent co-commentators, David Edwin, Markku Mekela and the dear departed Ed Shapiro.|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|4S!|nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|athene: north knows his partner doesn't have great hearts (no 1@H overcall) but the heart lead still looks natural enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: good choice!|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|viren169: and a club switch looks in order!|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D!|nt|Walddk2: But, you have seen wrong discards before|pg||
