pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|h3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: cash KC   looks like 7 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There are in game next door would you believe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East thought his hand was worth 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: after a few other bids|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I like an optimist - he added a few points for luck|pg||
nt|henryb: yes. East could not resist bidding Stayman, and West with his 16 carried on over 2N I bet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not quite|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: East bid 2@C  Puppet, and over 2@D forced, East bid 2@H to show spades|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then 2NT  3NT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cuttysark: Anyway, it rather makes the overtrick here irrelevant|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
mc|10|nt|ady: why no play a 2nd spade ?|pg||
nt|henryb: 220 and 190 is an imp difference|pg||

nt|jtr: Good morning people|pg||
nt|jtr: Happy St David's Day|pg||
nt|jtr: So, the action replays commence|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: yes they were such interesting boards that we wish to play them again|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Carryforward is actually 6.5 IMPs but we can't do fractions|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jtr: lol|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: So, not particularly low-scoring.|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 19 imps in 8 boards is quite low-scoring where I come from|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is some sort of three-way match, which some sort of scoring method to see who wins. (I thought I would share that with you).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play a lot of transfers and relays|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Al Hollander, Mike Gold, Martin Johnson and David Burn|pg||
nt|dburn: might be better to show it as 7, then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=5-11|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jtr: Very sharp this morning David|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Scoring: if you win both your matches, you go through|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: if each team wins a match, the scores are converted to VPs|pg||
nt|jtr: Not an appertising choice for East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@S in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: I much prefer Fredin's action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 16+ HCP Fallenius would have bid artificial 2@C|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: Even after a diamond lead, in the other room, I was told by a learned kibitzer that 2@S could have gone two down with best defence.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so east is limited to 15 HCP|pg||
nt|lestergold: mike fromEngland back hi all|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jtr: He is happier now though|pg||
nt|jtr: I read somewhere that you should lead trumps against a doubled partscore|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Nick Fahrer. Good morning to you|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jtr: In one of your books maybe David?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I read that in "The Pairs Game"|pg||
nt|jtr: Hehe|pg||
nt|brolucius: I never lead trumps, so you are asking the wrong person.|pg||
nt|jtr: Must have been one of my books then|pg||
nt|brolucius: "I could hardly lead a trump when I had @DK-10-7-2 as an alternative."|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can't say I like the 2@D overcall - I prefer to get majors into the game|pg||
nt|jtr: Yep, said that myself Liz|pg||
nt|jtr: Much as i hate agreeing with you|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Must hurt a lot, David|pg||
nt|fabsayc: rehi, this should make|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pitiful: will he find @c lead, unlikely|pg||
nt|pitiful: sorry private|pg||
nt|jtr: What else?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing a strong 1@C system, North had the option of passing 1@H.|pg||
nt|jtr: Other than a trump|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he is touching a diamond|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, a lively board to open the session. That is what we like.|pg||
nt|jtr: @d would not work well|pg||
nt|jtr: I am half asleep so it doesnt hurt that much|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|vugrapha3: hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the auction strongly suggests leading trump -- Brink didn't let his holding talk him out of the lead|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|brolucius: When two BBO commentators agree, they are almost certain to be wrong.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well now with an overtrick|pg||
pc|h5|nt|brolucius: West's decision to double on the third round, suggests that he does not hold primary club support and may therefore be good in diamonds.|pg||
nt|jtr: Maximum one down now i would say|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hopes to shorten his trump - but a club would be better|pg||
nt|brolucius: We can see that a club lead would work well, but I would not have fancied it when holding those East cards. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe a trump is best from his point of view|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Bird's Law|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jtr: Other than a @c maybe the @hJ was an option  Partner has shown length there|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not that anyone ever agrees with what I say.|pg||
nt|jtr: Thelma?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cuttysark: So had South!|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: EW cards just fit too well|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello David, Mike, Martin and Henry|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Roland and all|pg||
nt|dburn: good evening|pg||
nt|henryb: good evening David|pg||
nt|henryb: Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: Yo Henry!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|hT|pc|d4|pg||
mc|11|nt|jtr: noooo|pg||
nt|jtr: I just cannot understand that|pg||
nt|dburn: it may not have happened|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it did |pg||
nt|jtr: Exactly|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would not have bid 1@S with three-card support. So, he was marked with @HK-x. |pg||
nt|jtr: Can you see the logic DB?|pg||
nt|dburn: in that case, I don't understand it either|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however this has done most of the work for declarer|pg||
pg||

mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Not the best defence so likely only 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Is it usual to put on the highest from a sequence, when partner plays the suit. I normally play the lowest. Here @dJ from J10xx|pg||
mb|1H|nt|henryb: 170 and 140 is also an imp: 5 or 4|pg||
nt|ady: think they might get overboard here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Quite hard to hold it to 7 tricks, I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: 2@H seems a bit windy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as in wet?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: British weather|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thinking of catching up?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: still, he caught up|pg||
nt|henryb: seems to me it shows proper appreciation of the lack of value of quacks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: but even so, this is rather trappy bidding|pg||
nt|ady: only need club finesse and hearts behaving|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|henryb: or a @s lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Is 3@H invitational for any of you? It isn't for me. You have lots of other bids available for an invite|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, competitive|pg||
nt|ady: have to get diamonds soon|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Purely competing - looks as if North revalued his collection|pg||
nt|henryb: yes all those quacks suddenly became 6 high card points!|pg||
nt|henryb: (quacks are queens and jacks)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Manaca should know declarer has the singleton @SK|pg||
nt|ady: was  this the 2@C lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did partner not lead a spade? Because he doesn't have both top honours|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb: yes. a sensible person who does not play MUD|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cuttysark: Yes - @C2, 3rd & 5th|pg||
nt|ady: next a@D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It cannot be difficult to see where the 4 tricks in defence will come from|pg||

nt|jtr: It happens|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Norway do not score up with Sweden|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lead now only 5.5 :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = WEAK @H or @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 2@d is short @ds|pg||
nt|brolucius: Easy to be wise after the event, but perhaps West's second double was a little bold? He was perhaps worried that Rodwell had opened very light in 3rd seat and they were being ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: talked out of a contract their way.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jtr: 4-4-4-1 or 3-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|dburn: if South had raised 1@s to 2@s, West would have doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: with the excellent fit, 4s by n/s has chances especially played by south|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|jtr: Could be 4-4-0-5 too thanks to a spec for that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble means what?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|dburn: not sure what shapes Rodwell can have for this, but Meckstroth knows he has a fit in one of the majors|pg||
nt|dburn: bid your major|pg||
nt|dburn: pass might be diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: wow, was 2@C meaning "just kidding"|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: that is some stop with Fredin's hand opposite an opening bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: an unexciting and untaxing 2h|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dburn: and perhaps he wants to play in spades even facing 3=4=1=5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like they might beat this one|pg||
nt|jtr: I am sure he only guarantees 3@ss|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Still it is a guaranteed 8-card fit, quite likely 9, with a secondary heart fit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West's play should be suit preference here, since he must know this is a singlelton|pg||
nt|brolucius: He does now, anyway...|pg||
nt|jtr: wow nice 2NT bid to have available|pg||
nt|brolucius: Any kibitzers who are confused about the scoring for this stage of the event would be well advised not to ask me about it.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no probs in spades at the 2 level|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so does that imply fredin could have bid his own major if he had one?|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, some play that 2@h shows preparedness to compete facing spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: David is right  2@D-DBL-P=@D|pg||
nt|dburn: and others that 2@h means "I have my own hearts"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 2@H not forcing, why the alert|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very good stop|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: must he? would East not lead @hA from a doubleton?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: When dummy has shown hearts?|pg||
nt|jtr: Based on the last hand, he may lead it before it runs away:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this an advert against 2@D opener?  nat bidding may have gone 2@H-DBL-P-2@S;3@S|pg||
nt|dburn: well, South had the option of raising spades in this auction also|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jtr: One team goes through out of the three|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same thing applies if they are not using this redouble treatment|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: probably still not 4@S but defending 3@S always better than defending 2@S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: Hah!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn: not much to do with the 2@d opening as far as I can see|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jtr: Either by winning both matches or by a better IMP-VP score|pg||
nt|brolucius: I gathered that much.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: south understandably devalued his qx hts- he was not ton know that it was gold dust |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink was concerned about black suit tenaces in the auction too|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Ah - had not considered their new defesive strategy|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|henryb: presumably it carried some strength message that is abnormal|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently 2@C denies 3 hearts, and 2@H is invite|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jtr: Hmm very trusting not cashing the @d|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|jtr: Surely Rod has 5@ss|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hopes to give a second ruff|pg||
nt|jtr: Meck rather|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: Drijver probably would not have played like this in four|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as things going -- defending 3@S would have been much better @HK @H ruff for the beat|pg||
nt|dburn: or even in three|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but declarer could still ruff high and guess trump|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: but fredin asked for a diamond, not sure why|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: showed a better hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: ironically if 4 was bid and a spade led he would be forced to make it|pg||
nt|henryb: this recovers the trick that the opening lead lost -- if S leads the thirteenth club|pg||

nt|cuttysark: That would be artistic!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 5@D  ok here     |pg||
nt|henryb: well below. 20% is less than 38%|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 20 less than 38|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|henryb: I would overcall 1@s because of the overwhelming suit quality|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mdgraham: agree|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thank you Henry - did you compute the singletong @HQ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: yes. picking up hearts is 52% and the club finesse is 50%.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What is East going to do over a 1@H response?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: put down dummy?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I see, 1NT, but that shows a much stronger hand in my book|pg||
nt|cuttysark: just shows opening strength over a club - I guess the alternative is Pass, but who does that?|pg||
nt|henryb: bid 1NT to show 18-20 balanced of course|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: West is taking it as that....|pg||

mb|d|mb|4S|nt|dslee: Sry, wrong msg, private intended|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = WEAK 2@D  or  ART 20+ [not 22-24 bal = 2N]|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jtr: I was wondering:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So this is the closest match|pg||
nt|brolucius: Rodwell chose to advance on the South cards, facing a 21-23 point balanced hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: crikey|pg||
nt|dburn: double may be defined as takeout of spades, rather than just "lead a diamond"|pg||
nt|lestergold: is this correct?|pg||
nt|henryb: wow. apparently the double of 4@d was takeout of @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but David is that their understanding?|pg||
nt|dburn: a somewhat unusual treatment, but it may not work too badly here|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: it makes lots of sense at this vuls|pg||
nt|henryb: as in one down or beat 5@s|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it seems to be North's understanding at any rate, unless he has suddenly gone raving mad|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|jtr: How many is the 2NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Puppet Stayman, showing four spades.|pg||
nt|dburn: 21-23 or so|pg||
nt|jtr: 21-23?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: At the moment I think Sweden will go through|pg||
nt|jtr: So it seems very close|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This should be a nice 7/8 imp pick-up for the Swedes, then|pg||
nt|brolucius: A US kibitzer suggested to me that Meckstroth would follow exactly the same sequence used by Bertheau here, but he rebid 2NT instead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 1@h was Kokish i guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, they have done brilliantly to stop in 1NT and will deserve a swing.|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: 21-23, the operator told you :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: hmaltho 11 tricks maid in the open room, a dim lead and ht switch looks like curtains|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dburn: but if it is their understanding, he won't know to lead a diamond, but...|pg||
nt|lestergold: or a ht from south wheneevr?|pg||
nt|dburn: at least he has avoided leading a heart|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dburn: so that Rodwell had to try for game in case North had four spades|pg||
nt|jtr: Sorry Liz, but he didnt tell me|pg||
nt|jtr: Forced 1@s then 1NT showed more than an immediate 1NT|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Both Wests have bid Michaels over the transfer|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is a great fit for N-S. Meckstroth-Rodwell did well to bid 4@H, even though West had indicated spades (with a Michaels bid) over South's @SK-x.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A clever understanding by the Swedes, which leaves more room for South to express his hand - if East passes - than 3@H would.|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: if minors reversed, would Drijver rebid 1N or 2@S?|pg||

nt|cuttysark: 2@H some form of Michaels, spades + a minor|pg||

nt|jtr: Maybe just take-out of @hs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: though not certain- and 2NT may not be making- passing 2Nt is a reasonable option|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess South could have made himself declarer|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems that the ranges are 12-14 and 14-16, so South has not bid so boldly at this table. |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h not the greatest contract in the world here but with thefavourable lie of the reds it will roll in for a push|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well he has a pitch now so comes out the same|pg||

nt|lestergold: a shot to nothing of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: and brink has no objetion to east being on lead either|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|brolucius: Some South players would justify stopping low with: 'I did not like my @SK-x under the Michaels bid'. It is amazing how often that is not the case and partner has something good in ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: spades. |pg||
nt|jtr: I really see no reason that 2@h was Michaels  other than he has the right shape|pg||
nt|cuttysark: When you have the club in your bag, you just gotta use it|pg||
nt|dburn: it is possible to play that double is takeout of hearts, and 2@h is Michaels|pg||
nt|dburn: but some prefer double to be just diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: and others that double is "I would have doubled 1NT", depending on the range of the opening bid|pg||
nt|jtr: Three rounds of @cs would annoy Meck|pg||

nt|dburn: the trouble is, though, that if 2@h really was Michaels, declarer knows to ruff this high|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, it was a fine defence. West had every reason to think that North would hold the @CK but could see that he needed East to hold it to give the defence a chance.|pg||

nt|lestergold: thx to kindly 3/3 spade break 4h is cold|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|brolucius: Quite rightly, neither West player has thought it worthwhile to look for a 4-4 heart fit (on their 4-3-3-3 shape).|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some might use five-card Stayman in case there was a 5-4 heart fit, but that is statistically unlikely and you would give information away.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Fallenius hoping to hear another suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: ...he may think that South will be better placed to reject or accept an invitation if he knows of spades opposite|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wish granted|pg||

pc|hK|nt|jtr: Well, in effect no Stayman anyway|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Sorry, everybody - I forgot that the ace of trump takes a trick|pg||

pc|d9|nt|vugrapha3: claimed at Trick 1|pg||
nt|dburn: best play of the tournament|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|brolucius: East hopes to find his partner with a 'glint of steel' (as Reese used to call it) for his vulnerable weak two. I hope he can find it.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good bid from Brink put Fredin under pressure -- doubleton @S bad, but difficult to pass|pg||

nt|jtr: oh we have another 8!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Fredin is very self-critical. Or he would be if the need ever arose. |pg||
nt|jtr: So we will see these boards played by these pair's teammates|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it would help to play another eight boards, otherwise these matches will not be easy to score|pg||
nt|brolucius: An interesting set of boards.|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|lestergold: hm i wouldnt want to let fredin an easy entry into the aucion with this hand which does not have immense defensive strength|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: with 7 card support -- spade king is actually superfluous|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the three doubletons do not make the hand look very slammish|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Mike|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: was wondering if West would bid 5@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would have wanted a high spade number on the table a round ealier|pg||
nt|dburn: he may regret not doing so, if he gets a heart lead against 5@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other non-preemptive action was 2N=INV+|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Drijver doubled in a similar sort of position yesterday when his trumps were a modest AKQ9|pg||
nt|dburn: but Brink for some reason took it out|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: your 2@H i bet has more muscle henry|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: anybody for double of 5@H with north hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well even fredin at this vulnerability would have thought twice about competing over an immediate 4s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: long ago Ed Manfield explained -- don't bid 5-over-5, the 5 level belongs to the opponents|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|dburn: double would, I think, be "I want to bid on"|pg||
nt|henryb: not necessarily. a little more usually|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|dburn: pass invited partner to double|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|dburn: maintining the progression - four down, three down, two down... they have just enough boards left to make a contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: brink's perception of nothing and urs probably differ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: an ace different|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|lestergold: oh shucks spades didnt break|pg||
nt|lestergold: hah|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hT|nt|henryb: at least a queen different|pg||
nt|dburn: in the meantime, though, Sweden are picking up a significant number of IMPs from these ventures|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: vulnerability doesnt seem to bother these boys|pg||
nt|dburn: and will move to within three of their opponents approaching half way in the match|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|dburn: in fact, 6 of the Dutch IMPs you can see on the scoreboard are from carry-over|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|henryb: two or three down depending on thether he picks up the @d?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: by not hoing up with the ace and ruffing a spade he has also losty theopportunity to pin that pesky curse of scotland|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can he even do that, i think not|pg||
nt|lestergold: nine of dims by the way if u arent from thios part of the world|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|henryb: this whole auction is a mystery after 3N which I assume was a non-serious slam try|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: no diamond king, so they stopped, perhaps 4@S asked partner to ask for aces|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: the auction is being explained|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: by both pairs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond lead seems likely but perhaps a trump|pg||
nt|henryb: perhaps they play transfer cue bids: 3N = club cue, 4@c = diamond cue, 4@h = spade cue ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Fredin thinking|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: the only lead to put brink to the immediate test|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: the only problem will be if Brink believes this to be a cunning Fredin manoeuvre to deflect him from the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: brink knows it is prob a singleton but also knows what fredin is capable of|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|3D!|nt|fabsayc: d=hearts?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Candace -- have the bids been passed to other side of table?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: he changed his bid to pass|pg||
