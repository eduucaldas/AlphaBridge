nt|bjacobs: Anyway, the defence mistimed their club ruff, and handed declarer 4@D ... and that's the last board of the match in the CR.  Will it come down to that board?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|brgpro: we can make 6@c |pg||
nt|brgpro: but the players....does that mean we are much better?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It must |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: this week i went down in 3@c three times when deep finesse would have made it|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry 6@c|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Proving that Deep Finesse is better than you.  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: But Balicki is not thinking about 6@C ... he is wondering about 4@H and 5@D|pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door North, having shown his hearts could pass happily. Here South could still have 3 hearts hence North is a little nervous about passing|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|sA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, Michael, the more key holding is Qxx onside|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: if he suspects the distribution he has no choice|pg||
nt|brgpro: he will finesse...|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: if east is 4234 then only the drop can work|pg||
