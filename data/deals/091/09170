nt|athene: i wouldn't bother looking for a 5-3 major fit with that west hand|pg||
nt|athene: N-S are likely to power into 4@H here|pg||
nt|santyclz: N's @ss are more valuable on offense than he anticipates.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4333 and plenty of hcp|pg||

mb|2H|nt|athene: after @SA lead, though, west can see the necessity of a fast diamond switch|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|pelu: when u X before the suit: X is values - when u X after the suit more penalty|pg||
mb|2S|nt|viren169: I agree|pg||
nt|athene: even if you find partner with a 5-card major there's no guarantee it will be better than 3nt|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: 3nt No 5 card no 4 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 2@D=any game force|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@D = 2-3-5-3 - no 3 card @S|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|athene: interesting choice from north here - you might bid 1@H, 2@H, or 3@H|pg||
mb|2C!|an|!D suit|nt|athene: (or pass of course, but let's not consider that) :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|athene: east needs to play slam|pg||
nt|askgaard: My style would have been to preempt, but let's see how 1@h works|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S or 6NT|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4H|an|cue|mb|p|nt|mwigor: they have now wrongsided @c and @s only NT left|pg||
nt|mwigor: bertens may think the @hA is likely to be onside|pg||
nt|athene: from east's point of view, it's no clear to bid 6NT to protect the @HK, as the clubs might need to be ruffed good|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: pulled the pass card put it back and then pulled it out again|pg||
mb|5C|an|cue|nt|othered1: of course, east would think it likely the @HK is a control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is no problem when playing with screens|pg||

mb|5S|nt|athene: Bertens really needs to know how good the clubs are to bid 6NT confidently|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Nyström is to your right; then you can guess the rest|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|askgaard: Note that 4@h might easily not guarantee a heart control for this pair - it seems to be the only way to make a slam try in spades|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||

nt|viren169: nice competitive hand now|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C P 1@H now east should bid 2@D i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 14 board match is starting|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: when it comes to overcalling, a good suit compensates for anything|pg||
nt|viren169: or 3@D... not for the faint-hearted!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|santyclz: X or 1@s?|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: of course if north just bids 3nt that might shut east out :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: No chance...|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S looks normal to me|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: if you are 2-3-4-4  you open 1@C and rebid 3@D over 2@D to show that shape|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1@C - then u bid 3@D on 2-3-4-4, and 2NT on 2-3-3-5 and bad suit, 3@C on an good suit|pg||
nt|viren169: North saw it coming!|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT Jordan, showing a sound raise to 3@D|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: sensible bid from west|pg||
nt|athene: with 5-loser hand|pg||
nt|athene: nothing to the play:- one trick to lose in each major|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how anyone can be considering doing anything over 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the thing about bashing 3nt in here is, you don't especially want to shut out east from mentioning a long suit|pg||
nt|athene: because he is on lead anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: small diamond|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Sry for the delay (connection problems)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: this is the north final championship, final 4 3 matches 20 boards each|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|6S|nt|hedyg: so cannot differentiate between 2 3 4 4 and 2 2 4 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2245 is not a balanced hand|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@C then 3@D looks 2245 to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's semi-balanced|pg||
nt|pelu: no I dont like to open 1NT with 2-2 i major|pg||
nt|hedyg: you would not bid 1NT after 1@C-1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: interesting that both north players doubled|pg||
nt|santyclz: N could be considering a x on the empirical unlikelihood of 1 side making 11 tricks on any given hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, small diamond was definitely preferable with no entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: agree not the best lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a different auction perhaps top diamond correct|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here next to zero chance north has only 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: true, 11 tricks is a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt shows a very balanced hand for most people so East knows it's overwhelmingly unlikely N-S have 2-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: now declarer can succeed by playing on hearts.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: declarer is likely to put east with a top heart though|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: since otherwise why not a small diamond lead? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: think he will play for @c...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: so he might decide to pin his hopes on the clubs behaving|pg||
nt|viren169: normal to play on clubs and d1|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|pelu: yes - and have to tell "a story" after 2@D - but no system get 100%|pg||
nt|cicus: @D6 was Smith - don't like clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: N considering a @S switch?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt like any switch|pg||
nt|xenya: which might save a trick if S has AK|pg||
nt|xenya: as it is, it gives an overtrick it seems |pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: it doesn't hurt to cash some spades and see what they do|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: impossible to tell that S has 8@D which would maybe ask for @S and 6 asked for @H|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D can be a two-suited game-force, like here|pg||
nt|athene: this is the sort of hand where west really wants to know whether his partner is showing nothing with THREE spades, or nothing with FOUR spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It also has other meanings|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|askgaard: Wd Bakkeren to stop here|pg||

nt|cicus: chance for a swing hewre|pg||
nt|viren169: slam hand... off to the races here|pg||
nt|athene: north hand is hard to express in most systems|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: but when a side actually bids 5 of something that might change the a priori odds somewhat|pg||
nt|athene: however little respect you have for their bidding|pg||
mb|2C|nt|xenya: both ways perhaps|pg||
nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: too good for weak 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: 2@S might show a weak 2-suiter but this might lose the important sixth spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 2 @s is @s and a minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well that simplifies things, matos will ace ask|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure S with still push to the 5 level...|pg||
nt|viren169: great...|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't have a bid, really|pg||
nt|athene: so he will choose between double and 1@S i guess :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps Macskásy could have bid 5@H en route rather than punt 6@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW bidding @Hs helps S|pg||
nt|cicus: after 2@H here @CQ is a favourite to score|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It did not in the CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: careful pass by W|pg||
nt|xenya: but you don't really bid grand missing the trump Q?|pg||
nt|cicus: no but if the auction is crowded you can't pay attentiom to nuances|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Vladimir, but N could have had it but with no chance to raise when partner jumps to 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS not a regular partnership, is 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|xenya: true, Roland|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S is forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: without agreements 2@S is surely forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a method for showing this hand after 2@S opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|pelu: diff bid in N - has to bid 3@C - but pd will take is as a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need an agreement if it's not|pg||
nt|viren169: now 6 will be easy when (if) diamonds is found as second suit|pg||
nt|athene: now south has to do something|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south assumes he is facing only five spades, so will probably ask for the @SQ |pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like S is just going to bash it out...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes 4nt aces for @s and 5 @h asks @s Q|pg||
nt|santyclz: Make a @s a @h and he has a textbook Bramley x.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pelu: 3@H by S|pg||
nt|hedyg: time to cuebid|pg||
nt|hedyg: prefer 3@H|pg||
nt|cicus: is this not risky?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C won't lead anywhere|pg||
nt|cicus: I mean 4@C|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure 3@H agrees clubs|pg||
nt|cicus: Szalay will convert to 4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c normally orkc...|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@D from N (reverse) sh promise 1 bid more|pg||
nt|athene: does that get him into a Bramley Jam?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|hedyg: but in this sequence..|pg||
nt|cicus: ORKC idf forcing...|pg||
nt|xenya: hope they know what they are doing...|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S reached in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with the @SQ and nothing else, north would just bid 6@S, so 6@H shows extras|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|pelu: a jump to 6@C (in my system) = 2 Aces plus a void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know what ORKC is, but you had better explain. Many in the audience don't know I'm sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: orkc= option roman keycard|pg||
nt|cicus: Optional Roman Key.Card asking for aces|pg||
nt|cicus: optional, because it also asks about strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT....|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: 1st step agrees to slam, if other bid than 1st step then dont want slam but show number of keycards|pg||
nt|cicus: 1st step usually weak hand and other responses show aces|pg||
nt|pelu: on 4Nt I jump in the void-suit if lover that trumfp - and jump to 6 in your suit if higher|pg||
nt|viren169: whay 6@H and not 6@C?|pg||
nt|athene: but south, not being able to see all the hands and knowing there's a keycard missing, has no grand slam ambitions|pg||
nt|athene: south can't have been happy about passing throughout|pg||
nt|athene: but he didn't have any convenient bid|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|athene: perhaps north is worried that 6@C might be taken as his second suit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: i would probably risk 3@D over 2@S|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Sousa Guedes won the round Robein|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Robin|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cicus: maybe Hedy's version is more popular|pg||
nt|athene: showing extra length/strength there|pg||
nt|viren169: North passed at the other table, and drove to slame via RKCB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps 6 of a minor would offer a choice of slams|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: time to claim|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzkc: they all play pretty natural in this room|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: I don't think many play it|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: in Hungary they do|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: double was also possible if t/o|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzkc: Ribeiro is a "new team" on these finals|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: but usually without special agreement, if you pass over a suit then later double, partner is going to assume it's penalties|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: as with a t/o double you could have acted the first time|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: playing 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|athene: north was at the top of his range, so they stay low|pg||
nt|wygbe1: conservative decision, not to invite vul|pg||
nt|othered1: OK, that's reasonable with 11-13 range|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The playoff match between USA Hampson and Bridge i Norge won't start until later. The two teams agreed to sleep in and will only play 36 boards|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|viren169: a little pushy but it is imps after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would certainly bid 2@S with west's hand over 1@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nobody seems to assume x's are penalty any more.|pg||
nt|athene: it worries opps when you bid their suits|pg||
nt|athene: and it usually works out just fine|pg||
nt|athene: as long as you have a decent suit|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: in theory south has more room now but that might not be a bonus if he hasn't discussed these sequences|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: X for penalty, but I dont exp that S will accept - 4@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H problematic here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Budapest a great city. Buda on one side, Pest on the other side of the river Donau|pg||
nt|cicus: or vice versa|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt keeps things simple|pg||
nt|athene: south has a stopper in the unbid suit|pg||
nt|athene: but it's one of the BID suits which will be the problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: and now what?|pg||
nt|athene: if you start with double, you have to know what all your follow-up actions are|pg||

pc|d5|nt|hedyg: hehe|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Ed.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: howdy all!|pg||
nt|othered1: Assume the 1@S bid is essentially a forcing NT response|pg||
nt|santyclz: Marrku.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 1 @s is 0-4 @s forcing one round|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or else a great vul vs not psyche.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: 4@SX in CR, E overcalled...2@s|pg||
nt|athene: when you have one suit with an ace and one without, it's normal to lead the non-ace suit, but it's also normal to prefer a 5-card suit, so east had a close decision there i think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond shift now|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... I would have lead a @S... |pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes and declearer has to go for ! s first I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: @s I mean|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|viren169: although the 9@H is great card to have in that holding|pg||
nt|viren169: not a good switch|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|pelu: u have 4 toptrick and need 6 tricks on cross-ruff - not a big problem|pg||

mb|4H|nt|xenya: can S count on the @HA, for example?|pg||
nt|pelu: Is S looking for 2Aces or 1S-void by pd?|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|askgaard: Not easy for west to analyze, but I don't see a losing option for him right now|pg||
nt|athene: bakkeren has stops in both of dummy's suits so he might just try to be as passive as possible but it's not easy|pg||
nt|athene: and he must be worried about the possibility of being squeezed or endplayed|pg||
nt|othered1: passive might be low @S|pg||
nt|athene: if partner has any less than what he actually has in clubs, attacking clubs isn't going to knock out the @CA anyway and may just give tricks away|pg||

nt|hedyg: if Szalay passes|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H 1@S 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: now west might just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: with 7 running tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I guess a discussion is taking place right now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzkc: N/S might be in trouble here|pg||
nt|santyclz: The usual Ghestem result.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Pass before the x'ing starts.|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, EW have some points and fit, but not much anything makes, not even stop on a dime 2@H in open room|pg||
nt|athene: the auction is likely to start 1@C 1@S (2@H) X support and north can conceal the diamond side-suit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cicus: E does not want to pass nor does he want to encourage, goes the middle road|pg||
nt|pelu: why 1NT????? - do they play 1@S/1NT reversed?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s was an option as well?|pg||
nt|pelu: the middle road ? 1Nt = no road :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, they play 1NT f1 and he doesnt want to show @s, just a weak @H fit|pg||
nt|xenya: i would have seriously considered a pass as E|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6 losers, 2@d is enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: x means 3 @s support|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps exclusion now|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: facing two non-heart keycards you are happy to have a shot at 7@S|pg||
nt|athene: exclusion keycard is usually a jump to something above 4nt|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting lead coming up for East...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: here, N-S have the room to employ it at a lower level - IF they have agree this sort of thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: *agreed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H splinter for me, but can continue with 5@H void|pg||
nt|athene: this is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north wins @SK and switches to a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: east has to duck but now south can switch back to a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: playing artificial reverses?|pg||
nt|othered1: this can be a very large swing 12 imps or more.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: seems good lead by W (for them...)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cicus: 2@S prpbably game forcing without spades|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: i don't think this auction is really getting to grips with the hand|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we know what 4@S showed?|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence come to diamond, 2 clubs, and 2 spades|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: 2@S must be artificial game force?|pg||
nt|cicus: not sure about that|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cicus: one of my advisors says it is 17-18 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was just natural i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S was signoff, i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: he assumed 4@H was a splinter, either singleton or void|pg||
nt|viren169: I think N is living dangerously!|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't have anything|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|xenya: abot what W actually has|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|santyclz: N didn't keep a low @d?|pg||
nt|viren169: .either red suit will allow Declarer to claim quickly|pg||
nt|athene: north would have been better-off just bidding 5@H over 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart lead 12 with no guess|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I agree|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have heart void, great hand, but neither minor-suit ace"|pg||
nt|athene: and hence must have solid trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: they got it there anyway ...|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|cicus: but then I can't understand 3@D - why not pass 2NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so E could have pulled the brakes in 3@H|pg||
nt|viren169: anyone for stone age 2@S over 1@C?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: unfortunately this should go 2 off|pg||
nt|athene: east did well to lead a trump, i think|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to just hope his partner has the @DA|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes sry|pg||
nt|athene: he knows a heart lead might well give declarer a free @HAQ finesse|pg||
nt|athene: (west didn't double 5@H to show an honour, and north is void)|pg||
nt|athene: and if north is void in hearts he has length in one or other minor so a minor-suit lead could solve his side-suit problems|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is a 2@S bid, will wait awhile to use that bid again|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer should get it right in the end... considering East bid 2@H |pg||
nt|athene: i don't mind a strong jump shift response with north's hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C - 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes. Declarer as to guess but he will|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't supposed to use the bid on a 2-suiter but north can happily just treat that hand as a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|athene: but probably they don't play strong jump shifts - no-one seems to, these days|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... bets to treat it as single (solid) suiter|pg||
nt|viren169: works v nicely on this hand!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Neves is thinking|pg||
nt|viren169: also 6@S in the open room... but A@D lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: ok mhere we go|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||

nt|viren169: and I can feel Lencastre smiling!|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: and ducks, giving declarer the @SQ for the 9th trick|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|viren169: especially as he had no opposition bidding!|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: hoping for miracle @HK coming down, then there's no need for the guess|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|h3|nt|cicus: the best method to slow down the bidding is perhaps: pass|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@s? , difficult|pg||
nt|santyclz: No problem.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|cicus: over 1@H|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: at least the most radical one|pg||
nt|pelu: against 2@H: @C to Q- @HA and @H7 to 8 10 and J|pg||

pc|h6|pg||

mb|2S|mb|d|nt|athene: no way south is defending 4@H now, after the jump|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: my guess is east will double again and that will end it|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: hard for west; if his partner has a singleton spade it will almost always be right to bid|pg||
nt|askgaard: West can't really bid bid this flat shape, can he?|pg||
nt|mwigor: fredin bid 5@h in the other room when fallenius bid 3@h rather than the X chosen by bertens - hard for bakkeren to do anything other than pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|othered1: @D will set up in time for pitches, so trump lead won't save a trick|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: this is quite a delicate hand|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to get the diamonds going and leave a trump or two in dummy to control hearts|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|mwigor: the defence may need to switch to a @c now . . .|pg||
nt|askgaard: Right, but a nice lead|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|askgaard: Give west some meat in his @d suit and the lead would have gained a trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is there a chance that the defence can go wrong now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another trump is not a good idea|pg||
nt|athene: i think the danger of the diamonds must be apparent|pg||
nt|athene: even though declarer did best by concealing the @D10|pg||
nt|askgaard: @d+@d or club shift|pg||
nt|athene: club switch now looks very reasonable|pg||
nt|mwigor: yes bertens can ruff one of declarer's discards on @d @d - only another trump is fatal now|pg||
nt|askgaard: He won't play a trump, I'm willing to bet on that.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|othered1: low from even return|pg||
nt|athene: small diamond off dummy|pg||
nt|athene: but west has seen his partner's count card|pg||
nt|askgaard: Right, in this particular situation, partner's count card will always be honest|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Nyström just closed the screen to ask about what card gets led back|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|askgaard: Perhaps west really should have played @d+@d. What if partner were 4@h+5@c instead of the other way around?|pg||
nt|mwigor: good point michael|pg||
nt|askgaard: In that case it seems like a club won't do the trick, if declarer pulls a second round of trumps and plays @d|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: a Grosvenor|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

pc|c7|nt|athene: her can ruff the clubs good but wld have to waste a third trump to get there fast|pg||
nt|athene: he can|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s3|nt|othered1: A true Grosvenor, since it could have cost a critical trick, as shown|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Grosvenor. When an opponent makes a play that allows the declarer to make the contract, but the declarer does not believe the opponent to make such an obvious mistake, so the ...|pg||

nt|athene: north might double 2@S|pg||
nt|viren169: it may have taken a bit longer in the play without the 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's the least unappealing option :)|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer 3@D|pg||
mb|1D|nt|viren169: better to pass...|pg||
nt|athene: we saw he doubled 2@H on the 6430 earlier|pg||
nt|athene: after 1nt pass 2@D pass 2@H|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: i think it's close between pass, double and 3@D|pg||
mb|3H|nt|viren169: depends on style and partnership trust...|pg||
nt|athene: if you are ever going to open a weak-2 with a 7-card suit, that north hand is when you should do it, i think|pg||
nt|athene: an empty suit but an ace, so you have some defence|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|athene: east can't really have slam interest can he?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: how did they get to 2@S in CR? -- oh N just bid it|pg||

nt|athene: this lead gives declarer time to play on clubs, but it doesn't really help him|pg||
nt|viren169: North has bid 3@D over the multi in the open room|pg||
nt|athene: south might now be wishing he had bid 4@D over the double|pg||

mb|1C|nt|viren169: great hand here...|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H or 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S looks like 500 on diamond lead, ruff, heart back, another diamond ruffed with @SJ|pg||
nt|athene: 6nt for N-S now|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|cicus: with 5 weak hearts and 4 clubs they overcall 1NT  I think|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: Doesn't 6@c make?|pg||
nt|viren169: I think E/S will take the push to the 5 level|pg||
nt|athene: south will definitely sac now|pg||
nt|athene: you knock out the @DA then you have 3-3 in either minor or various squeezes|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1NT or 2@c?|pg||
nt|ady: will it go higher than the 5 level?|pg||
nt|athene: E-W aren't playing a strong club are they?|pg||
nt|viren169: was 2@H F or NF?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cicus: not sure this pair plays that, though|pg||
nt|athene: best is for the defence to hold up the @DA|pg||
nt|athene: then you have to commit yourself|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: east's 1@C is a bit strange|pg||
nt|viren169: interesting choice!|pg||
nt|athene: always 1@D with that shape|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: west just might go right here.  East's 4@C bid shows decent length, I'd assume|pg||
nt|ady: 1 diamond and 1 spade loser in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk5: N-S never bid in the other room|pg||
nt|othered1: a cautious 5@C, perhaps fearing 4@S would be 5=5 black?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|viren169: wow!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: @d lead wont be good|pg||
nt|pelu: better bid 2@H in 1. round - in moders bridge u need to take space from opp|pg||
nt|hedyg: was waiting for opps to play in @s or rebid @d|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unless you pitch a @s on the @ds.|pg||
nt|athene: you don't open 1@C with 55 in the minors, just so you can reverse :)|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead will make things easy|pg||
nt|athene: you look at the @D9 and claim 12 :)|pg||
nt|athene: west might reason as follows:- 1) declarer has spades |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: and then he went from dreaming to the real world :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2) dummy has hearts|pg||
nt|athene: 3) partner didn't double 3@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: You called it.|pg||
nt|athene: 4) i'll lead a diamond!|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: suicide is not painless|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: south has no excuse for 5 over 5|pg||

nt|pelu: is that normal, Gabor?|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, that is standard|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: was south worried about 6 clubs   otherwise should surely go to 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: For a start I think South has an opener|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|pelu: even with a bad @D and good @C - no lead-directing?|pg||

nt|Walddk5: No South opened|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|othered1: Open room looks like confusion over rebids after a reverse|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: hardest for declarer would be a major-suit lead, and the @DQ then @D to the @DK both ducked|pg||

nt|cicus: probably, I know no standard interpretation for that|pg||

nt|othered1: 13 top tricks and lots of high cards.  Still, many don't like to bid 7 unless they can count 13 tricks.|pg||
nt|viren169: they say leave the 5 level for the opps!|pg||
nt|athene: left to their own devices, E-W will play 4@S|pg||

nt|xenya: N should pass, unhappily?|pg||
nt|cicus: that would be a violation of system|pg||
nt|xenya: or is it not allowed?|pg||
nt|hedyg: desperately looking for a bid|pg||
nt|cicus: would not be surprised if N passed, though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i pass 2@D|pg||
nt|viren169: I think East should protect over weak 2@H more difficult over multi|pg||
nt|athene: north might just settle for 3NT over that but it's a bit wet|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@c could be artificial?|pg||
nt|othered1: A relay system should handle this trivially in about 12 rounds of bidding|pg||
nt|santyclz: By next Tuesday.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if it had gone 2@H P P east might well have doubled, in the passout seat|pg||
nt|athene: but the multi changes the tempo|pg||
nt|athene: passing the multi was also worth considering and might have worked out well|pg||
nt|santyclz: How about 3@h xx?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: no, it is 5-5 GF|pg||
nt|pelu: the close match - same good - and bad - bids in both room|pg||

nt|fabsayc: what is north thinking|pg||
nt|athene: that wld be lots of fun|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: north's double of 2NT is very strange|pg||
nt|viren169: careful play will bring in 2N|pg||
nt|athene: to double 2NT, you should have reasonable hopes they can't make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a little care required but always 8  tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: good match, good bridge|pg||
nt|athene: boo|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: south for the time being assumed a weak hand opposite|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT...|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N is amazingly conservative|pg||
nt|ady: 4 diamonds a better choise|pg||
nt|othered1: The @SK in partner's long suit usually is worth it weight in gold.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: I think the key is to find KQ in front of all those cards...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: it will not work for N/S...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzkc: probably 4 @d would help more...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: trump lead looked automatic with those @ss|pg||
nt|viren169: it was a hasty dble... would probably had a chance to dble 3N or 4@S!!!|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: two rounds of hearts, then spade to hand, @HK|pg||
nt|athene: even if east didn't have the @S10 you could probably strip-squeeze north in the blacks|pg||
nt|athene: to lead up to the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead wld have led to 12 tricks i think|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think north did anything but show @D of some type and a bunch of points of some sort.   |pg||
nt|Walddk5: flat, 6@H in the OR|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: a top heart and it's easy; a low heart and that gives declarer 11 fast tricks with several options for 12|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|xenya: now the plan looks clearcut -- 2@Hs, 4@S (including 2 ruffs), 2@D (including a ruff) and a natural trump ytick|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs asking re 4@hs, there is a slight @d problem |pg||
nt|athene: east, holding all three side-suits, is still going to get minced on the clubs|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|viren169: North needs to be careful not to concede an overtrick...|pg||
nt|santyclz: I would make an early @d pitch, hoping declarer has the j.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: if he throws a diamond, he will have to give a trick to the @CK for +1|pg||
nt|viren169: I think North is wondering why he dbled in the 1st place!|pg||
pc|s3|pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: no reason not to throw club jack however|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: as a spectator points out, west could throw the @DJ to tell his partner what he has|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|viren169: 1 over trick!|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||

pc|d7|pg||

nt|athene: upgrade to 1nt opener is reasonable enough|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cicus: bold|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that's true|pg||

nt|othered1: find.  This for play in @D or NT on slam hand|pg||
nt|athene: majors or spades from south now|pg||

nt|viren169: 2@C=majors or single suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: single suit|pg||
nt|viren169: West may find out 1st before bidding 3N... as South is on lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|3D|nt|hedyg: 2NT is not jacoby, it is invite +|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: prefer pass and see what happens|pg||
nt|athene: win in dummy, diamond to the @D8 perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: win in dummy and low to diamond nine?|pg||

pc|d4|nt|cicus: great lead|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead the defence have four hearts and @CAQ to cash |pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: now north can kill the diamonds however|pg||
nt|athene: no chance now|pg||
nt|viren169: this may go poorly now...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: declarer was hoping to snag a stiff diamond honour with south|pg||
nt|athene: but probably, on balance, small diamond to the @D8 was best - it's very unlikely they can cash four hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@H dbled went 2-off on the last in the other room...|pg||
nt|viren169: the T and 9 seems like hugh cards... |pg||

nt|ady: 4@H in other room so looks like flat|pg||
