mb|p|mb|1S|nt|bjacobs: That's a spectacularly strong showing from the Youth team - if they can hold it for this final round|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ickool: the youth are 5vps from bieng in the top 8 but i suspect they will have their work cut out -|pg||
nt|swanson: North had a difficult rebid over 1@S.   2@H is a bit of a push with the unknown value of the @CK.|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: they will need a 22 at least to finish in the top 7 (remember mr yeh's team is seeded 1st automatically)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: The cards seem super friendly - maybe game actually makes, but they sensibly stop in a partscore|pg||
nt|swanson: 4@S can make with 3-3 diamonds and the @SK onside if you go for it.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bjacobs: Are we allowed to call that a "Roland game"?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
