nt|ahollan1: 16 teams will be in KO,  1-8  assumed no loss,  9-16 = 1 loss  then double elimination KO|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: of course , they were right up there but currently 1th|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 15th|pg||

mb|2S|nt|gowdy: not my 1st choice but may work here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this seems to be a trend|pg||
mb|d!|nt|ahollan1: what is your plan if you begin with 1@D?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|kiwibridge: to reverse into @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gowdy: well if P bids a @H  then :0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S should guarantee 3@S support|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|gowdy: cute lead :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as expected various plans - some raise to 2@S, some reverse to 2@H, hence 1N opening in picture too :)|pg||

nt|mmmakela: where's Poconos at Joe(and hi!)|pg||
nt|mrdct: hi everyone|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks, hi Dave.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: hi everyone|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi|pg||
nt|pbundy: hi everyone .....|pg||
nt|mildredb: hi everyone|pg||
nt|gowdy: Hi |pg||
nt|woozle: This should be a good match - the strong Global team has come off a big loss to play the leaders USA Hampson|pg||
nt|mariner1: are they Global, or just merely confused? :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all - |pg||
nt|mariner1: top 15 advance + Yeh Bros team as sponsors|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: top 16 go through so both of these teams are comfortable, but top 7 get a 2nd chance|pg||
mb|1D|nt|santyclz: Northeast Pennsylvania (our local excuse for mountains.)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: hi Al and welcome all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hello again Sunil|pg||
nt|gowdy: soft 1st hand  4 @S looks easy|pg||
nt|woozle: Easy 4S for NS to begin...hard to imagine what else they might do with it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrdct: probably a @c partscore for EW here|pg||
nt|mrdct: west thinking of passing this in|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H instead of DBL is interesting choice|pg||
nt|pbundy: well; i haven't seen this for a while! natural to play bid over 1NT|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes A Y   are in tenth place  and the face quiet a good team   Beware*|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Looks like an uneventful 3nt to get everybody settled in.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: veteran Indonesian pair facing a lot younger Dutch pair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks, hi Steve.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: West took a while to open that hand- was he going to pass ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's often not a good idea to open in 4th seat without a @S suit|pg||
nt|salokin: Hi All|pg||
nt|pbundy: is 2@S appropriate?  hard to know|pg||
nt|mariner1: the top 8 enter next session with NO LOSSES , next 8 with ONE LOSS and its|pg||
nt|mariner1: double elimination, two losses and you are out|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bjacobs: A well known husband wife combo here|pg||
nt|mildredb: perhaps they play wk NT |pg||
nt|pbundy: possibly - reasonable supposition|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|mrdct: as more often than not you write down -110 defending 2@S|pg||
nt|pbundy: manoppo wisely passes|pg||
nt|gowdy: may get to the 5 level   but no harm there|pg||
nt|woozle: Bold 4H from McGann, escapes for 800 if he guesses trumps|pg||
nt|woozle: Even a slam move from Curtis will escape unscathed as long as he counts his aces correctly|pg||
nt|gowdy: yes  even todat's game 4NT should be blackwood|pg||
nt|woozle: presumably NS have the mechanism to show a better 4S bid, like pass-then-pull|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|robinswr: garbage stayman|pg||
nt|santyclz: Struck gold.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mariner1: so both these teams have a shot at being in the top 8 which is a big advantage|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: american style raise by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: sunny 81f or 25c at the venue|pg||
nt|frankaus: still time to catch a flight to one of autralias national events :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: pairs start Sunday - teams Tues|pg||
nt|mrdct: a problem for EW here is that 1@C doesn't show a @C suit so they could lose their fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doubleton @SQ will help - but can east maintain control?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Al bbl might have got them to the great 6@D contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Have to confess I'd spend all my time scuba diving on your reefs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hi Steve, Joe and Marshall|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 3rd and final @h?|pg||
nt|mrdct: lindqvist might play his partner for 5@h here and compete to 3@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: but I would suggest he's already fully described his hand and should leave it up to south to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|jbgood: n still thinking - not good|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Joanna and Lew Stansby against the best of British|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Bill Jacobs and Jan van Cleeff|pg||
nt|imp_jan: folks good morning (it's europe here)|pg||
nt|salokin: very popular now to play TRF over a (semi)nat 1@C opening 1@S is then a TRF to 1N or sometimes @D's |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: declarer will have no problem to collect at least 8 tricks probably 9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: hi Roland, steve, Joe and specs|pg||
pc|cK|nt|woozle: He'll still be fine unless he duplicates the other table's line of play - I don't know which additional loser they found|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: or even ten with the nice position of cards|pg||
pc|cA|nt|santyclz: He did only have 7 hcp for his x, but who's counting?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this contract looks quite safe|pg||
nt|mildredb: this can go dn 3 w/ best def|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|robinswr: club lead is to be able to cross ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: E showed hearts - so what? Hi all|pg||
nt|mrdct: he is a passed hand though so a shapely 7 count looks fair enough to me|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: oops, balanced them in to a game that may make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Brad Coles from Australia|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: just go for 3 round of @d  cash the Qof @c and finesse trump   easy seeing all 52 cards!|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Brad|pg||
nt|redgrover: hi all -- i'm very excited to see our kids on vugraph at this stage of the event|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, brilliant effort|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: how old are they Brad ?|pg||
nt|redgrover: nabil is about 16, andy early 20s|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sunsamvar: dbl|pg||
nt|bjacobs: N/S were right the first time with 2@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even with that lead - no entry to North!|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4 losers in 4h!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pbundy: yes; needs an immediate diamond shift|pg||
nt|mildredb: shdn't be hard to find - |pg||
pc|s3|nt|santyclz: It would be an impressive system that could get to 4@h on this hand.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not arguing with the x, but thinking over 3@c is an overbid.|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes i agree he has a clear pass over 3@c|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mrdct: but some players do like to think everything through twice|pg||
nt|mildredb: or @S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|salokin: other table ended up in 3@C after a precicion 2@D opening (short@D I think) |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Nikolas Bausback, Germany, and Martin Carroll, Ireland|pg||
pc|d3|nt|salokin: Hi All|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes; i guess if you lead back a spade and declarer goes up to lead a club - no dummy entries.|pg||
nt|pbundy: hard for the defense to go wrong|pg||
nt|pbundy: manoppo had to find another round of restraint.  not so easy on the auction.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: 6@D - yikes  i hadn't even considered that|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Best option is to lead a top spade from hand at trick 2, and catch East napping|pg||
nt|mildredb: @C now , the south need to ret low @H, otherwise might get endplayed|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: very young chaps  then good show |pg||
pc|dA|nt|mmmakela: Here in Finnish Lappland we got a meter of snow|pg||
nt|frankaus: reef is some distance from the venue (600-800 km) - but a fine surfing beach virtually accross the road|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Marshall Lewis from USA|pg||

nt|marlowepi: N was not that far from an invitation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just wondering if they could find making game :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Team name Bridge i Norge means (as I am sure you have guessed) Bridge in Norway, the official bridge magazine there. Boye Brogeland is the editor|pg||
nt|pbundy: i think that this is ok IF north overtakes|pg||
nt|mildredb: sure|pg||

nt|pbundy: still - even 300 will be a nice pickup|pg||
pc|s9|nt|imp_jan: defenders cash out already|pg||
nt|pbundy: perhaps south should have anticipated and led low in any case.  even if south could have smothered the ten - a heart pitch is likely irrelevant|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, but more sharks at the bridge table.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: Hi Martin and Marshall|pg||

nt|redgrover: adam 17, ally 24, peter 20 and justin 19 (all approximate ages)|pg||

nt|mmmakela: 5@Hdbld|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://www.yehcup09.com.au/index.php is website with all kinds of info|pg||
nt|woozle: This deal is a free-for-all - whoever wins the bidding is free to struggle in a contract of their choice|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ok for 10 tricks then   I woudl have prefered to throw a@h on the 3rd round of @d|pg||
mb|2C|an| |mb|p|nt|imp_jan: as it is on this one...|pg||
mb|2D|an| |mb|p|nt|santyclz: Anyone for 5@s by s?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not with this bidding tempo, S might bid on|pg||
nt|imp_jan: that's what i mean: 3nt|pg||
nt|gowdy: transfer here    yes :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can make 4@H on a Motsian fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: EW using the increasingly popular treatment of transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|pbundy: mildred - assuming stnd methods, do you prefer 1@C or 1@D with this hand?|pg||
nt|mildredb: i open 1D w/ 4-4|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moysian|pg||
nt|redgrover: 3NT also likely to make|pg||
mb|3D|an| |nt|santyclz: The 4@h opening at the other table got them to our expected contract.|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like i have a winning ticket :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I blame Lasut!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@H looks makable here for EW|pg||
nt|mrdct: and NS playing transfers also i believe|pg||
nt|woozle: If West transfers to spades he'll surprise North a bit, and then keep him quiet|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: EW have the chance to get the singleton @C not on lkead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South checks the backs of the cards ... partner has overcalled vul, they've bid to 3NT, and I've got THAT hand?|pg||
nt|woozle: 2S might be a chance to make, particularly if the DQ doesn't appear now|pg||
nt|woozle: 2S, 2D, 1H,3C will do|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3rd and 5th  is the Q rite ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moysian = 4 3|pg||
mb|3H|an|3 cards|nt|redgrover: if north plays it|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 5 @c  seems more probable but difficult to make|pg||
nt|frankaus: $US70,000 first prize would make a nice filler for thir budgets|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am told Andy is 21,,, still excellent play for his age|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: I'd bid 3 @H without the club ace|pg||
nt|santyclz: Markku and I each owe you a coke.  (No you can't make it a beer.)|pg||
nt|jbgood: after a @c opening - yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: but not now|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: the backs are blue|pg||
nt|imp_jan: previous brds the hackeds avoided 4@H indeed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: what pattern?|pg||
nt|redgrover: these guys are all very experienced -- they were in the finals of our nationals 2 years ago, and have some international experience too|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mmmakela: rosenkranz type maybe, promising 1/3 high honors in spades|pg||
nt|salokin: Hi Marrku|pg||
nt|mildredb: obviously n/s is playing stg @C system|pg||
nt|woozle: Declarer now does best to try for a diamond ruff in hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: Fast Arrival|pg||
nt|santyclz: Transfers over a 1@c bid seem to work particularly well with Polish @c.|pg||
nt|mrdct: @C lead looks pretty clear-cut here|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess 1 down|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think if you are going to play transfers over 1@C it definately makes sense to broaden the range of hands that open 1@c|pg||
nt|jbgood: corrected by kibs: 2 down|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North sweats ...|pg||
nt|imp_jan: here, in 4!x there 4 top losers|pg||
nt|imp_jan: in 4@c|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same bidding in Open|pg||
nt|marlowepi: IMO it is not obvious for W to pass this out in 2S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably 2H showed 4|pg||
nt|salokin: or some kind of snapdragon, promising semifit and 5-c in 4th suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Round 7:  Yeh Bros v USA Hampson and India Venkatesh v India National|pg||
nt|salokin: same bidding in OR|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 4 @c sounds like a cue|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: i like weak fast arrivals|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was 2H something special? or did 1H not show 5?|pg||
nt|robinswr: i think 1heart was artificial|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spec copnfirms it, yes thx|pg||
nt|imp_jan: good save against 3@h :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 @H seemed automatic|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|frankaus: beer is a little early 10:45 am here|pg||

nt|gowdy: only loses to this  and he may lead the j from thst|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mildredb: interesting - having to rebid 2NT w/o stopper in either suit :)|pg||
nt|woozle:  If the next card is a low heart, Hanlon will probably get it right|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: very well done good judgement by South|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to stay low though 5@C has a little play|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H is the spot, now to make|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lebridgeur: that shoud not be much of problem  with EW distribution|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|santyclz: Really oper?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: low club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here's another "making slam" :)|pg||
nt|salokin: but not "lawfull" :) |pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open it has gone P P 1@D DBL - 4@D so far|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h3|nt|sunsamvar: the pleasant surprises continue :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: effective bidding by curtis and joe has lead to a poor 3nt|pg||
nt|redgrover: is this one of those hands where you duck a heart? or is that too risky with 2 possible spade losers?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: hung toying between @S5 and @D9|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open it has gone P P 1@D DBL - 4@D - DBL - P - 4@S - P P P  so wrong spot there|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: well a difficult hand to bid with opponents silent  but @d opening stillmore difficult I do not like south double 2@c seems more appropriate|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: now he's moved the @D5 to the end of his hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mmmakela: if supp dbls and E promises 4|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes the Lore of Total Tricks is not all there is to it|pg||

pc|h4|nt|mrdct: the official site is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ which has links to lots of useful info|pg||
nt|jbgood: double dummy to take it 2 down - needs a small heart |pg||
nt|jbgood: but the rest is also double dummy - so...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: yes, W has an 8-loser hand with all cards working. should be safe at 3 level, and NS arent going to double anywya|pg||

nt|pbundy: interesting|pg||
nt|mildredb: played by south in open room|pg||
pc|d5|nt|woozle: A good player knows that it's fairly safe to underlead the heart ace here, but risky to lead from the queen|pg||
pc|hT|nt|redgrover: losing the heart to the right hand|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Yes, remarkably, this might be the par result - if reached a bit unorthodox|pg||
nt|imp_jan: england is in 17th postion, usa stansby in 20th (out of 24 teams)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: amazingly Lavazza is last in the rankings for the moment|pg||
nt|rogerclee: i wouldn't really call a 1@H overcall at these colors "fairly orutine", but it is normal in NS's style|pg||
nt|gowdy: 4@S here  play or defend ?|pg||
nt|woozle: routine 4S for EW, and Curtis probably won't try to disrupt their auction at this vul|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S should be off 1|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mmmakela: so loses a club and 2 spades |pg||
nt|marlowepi: this should be fun|pg||
nt|woozle: or I could be wrong|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: maybe grue should have opened 1heart|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes it is very dangerous to open strong club when very distributional and short in spades|pg||
nt|mrdct: very good slam for EW here in @H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: no.. but will still make 12 cause @D split|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugrapha3: correct|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: hello btw :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: No problem, for some reason the players frequently seem to have other things on their minds than ensuring the vg oper can see all their plays.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if NS are playing Precision or not - and 1@S doesn't resolve that issue |pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have major game and EW can't save due to VUL position I think|pg||
mb|3C|nt|marlowepi: in general the same is true when two-suited, but on previous board N held spades, so the danger was greatly reduced|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a remarkable field - full of quality |pg||
nt|imp_jan: might be a slam in clubs here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: R3: Australia Youth v Bridge i Norge and New Zealand v India National|pg||
nt|robinswr: 5clubs should show spade support|pg||
nt|mildredb: interesting X|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes; i wouldn't find it myself|pg||
nt|woozle: one club ruff in hand is ten tricks, losing a heart, diamond and the club ace|pg||
nt|woozle: McGann will always get to game here, but how he proceeds will perhaps give us an insight into his style|pg||
mb|3N|nt|santyclz: On the @hk lead, e will probably make 6.|pg||
nt|robinswr: no he'll probably lose a club and a diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Joe means, because E can place the high cards|pg||
nt|mrdct: with 3@H showing a strong @H raise east is sure to make a move towards slam now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Easier for those who play any rebid other than 2@s shows extras, either in hcp or distribution.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice practical 4@S rebid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the Chinese are supposed to be precise :)|pg||
nt|redgrover: i think 5@D by east requires a heart lead to get 500|pg||
nt|mariner1: of course NS have to bid the game to play it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: u all agree with 2 clubs? |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: incidentally, tempo altered on purpose|pg||
nt|mildredb: I'm w/ you|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3 h  is my choice|pg||
nt|woozle: Hanlon can't bid 3S now, since that's what he would bid with a yarborough|pg||
nt|gowdy: could rite side it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: lots of playing strength so some might bid 3|pg||

nt|mmmakela: hard to predict the fin contract on this one unless W opens 1 NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Which they did in OR|pg||
nt|woozle: 9xxx doesn't look much like a stopper, maybe 4H is the best bid|pg||
nt|gowdy: pass here|pg||
nt|woozle: 3NT makes anyway in comfort|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: who is the boss     sort of hand  here!|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|santyclz: I do, bad honor structure.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3@d not alerted, kind of waiting bid i suppose|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think 3@D is natural, which South will turn into a cue with 4@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a difficult area for natural bidding|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: well it may have been alerted, casually|pg||
nt|pbundy: manoppo may wish that he had found pass, too|pg||
nt|gowdy: it is a stop however :)|pg||

nt|mariner1: syandings after 9 rounds|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rogerclee: i am surprised at this non-diamond lead|pg||
nt|pbundy: not good when they play the same suit at both tables by the same team|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 4@C is low anyway|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: fall from grace here for NS but I do not know to whom the blame should go|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I do too, was just asking|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm not quite sure what "serious 3NT bid" means - but it's got them on the right track for slam now|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Serious means he is very keen to go to slam.|pg||
nt|jbgood: apart from being a world champ - brogeland is the editor (and owner) of Bridge i Norge. His prd made his debut on the Nor Open Team last year by winning the European Teams Chship|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This auction will not make their highlight reel ... but they may escape with a game|pg||
nt|imp_jan: anyhow, the heart lead doesn't paralyze declarer|pg||
nt|gowdy: good to make the opps work for a push or lose 1 hand|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sunsamvar: good lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a vital tempo for defense lost|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mrdct: brogeland has been a frequent visitor to Australia in recent years to play in our major national events|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - and with Erichsen and for Stern|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: Looking at the N/S hands, 3NT is a dreadful spot|pg||
nt|pbundy: i hope children are not watching; this will not be pretty|pg||
nt|mildredb: hard to even know what to do @@ trick 2 :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: anyone for 2@C originally with the east hand?  not that 2@C would meet a particularly nice fate, either|pg||
nt|pbundy: medic|pg||
nt|mildredb: I don't understand east's pass, myself|pg||
nt|pbundy: i once was playing against a top lady professional with a client in a mixed pairs.  she put down a less than exquisite dummy, and her partner said "ms. x - i need to go to the ...|pg||
nt|pbundy: bathroom.  YOU play it" and left!|pg||
nt|mildredb: but 2@C looks better than 2@D|pg||
nt|pbundy: i would be tempted to do that on this hand - except - it was declarer who emerged the partnership in this |pg||
nt|pbundy: yes it does, mildred|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|frankaus: make will bid 2@C - if pd passes its likely to be the best spot|pg||
nt|mrdct: hopefully EW have a mechanism to work out they are off the trump A|pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: not obvious why S is doubling. could N pass be forcing?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|frankaus: *many|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sunsamvar: only needs @Dk from p to take it down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on @D return, @CA @C ruff, trump, claim losing @HA|pg||
nt|imp_jan: this time a big club migth do the job|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and this is just setting up tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mrdct: most recently on Nick Irens' team|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NEXT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jbgood: y|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: which is going to make a massive number of tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|gowdy: better to play this  one in w with a @D lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|robinswr: north is shows his hcps so that the clubs will be misguessed|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: @H play works, but only because West has !AH|pg||
nt|redgrover: i think given that North was given the chance to double 3@H, he's probably done his part|pg||
nt|frankaus: i like to let pd know that we have 8 major fit but, here - 1@S over 1@H would have placed NS in a better position|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in 4@S here in Open|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mmmakela: the lead was strange imo|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|mmmakela: club seemed obvious|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mrdct: claiming now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|robinswr: so does he play for qj onsides or singleton honor offsides or QJ offsides|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|robinswr: he can make it if north has a singleton honor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: It may seem odd that N did not try to cash heart with only stiuff in dummy. N is reasoning that: (a) EW would not bid a slam off 2 aces, and (b) S would have led hearts unless he ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: had so many that a void was probable. both assumptions less than guaranteed|pg||
nt|robinswr: is north 7-5 in the reds|pg||
nt|santyclz: S followed to 3 @ds.|pg||
nt|robinswr: easy looking at all four hands tough at the table|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|woozle: He tangled the play a little, but was never really in trouble|pg||
pc|d9|nt|robinswr: south never support hearts so north could have 9 of them|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: at this point Grue claimed 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dQ|nt|santyclz: Magic @c position.  The normal @c lead would have worked out much better.|pg||
nt|mariner1: so -200 will score imps for EW here|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: so that will level the match|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

nt|mariner1: this is my 5th session is my excuse|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: hearts better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if 3@C is fit-showing or just some artificial 4card @S raise|pg||

mb|p|nt|imp_jan: how to stay out of game on this one?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not easy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@D - 3@H - Pass?  Seems a bit double dummy|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: did sheardown play with bruce elliot?|pg||
nt|redgrover: but might get a heart lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: 8-11, they have 2@D for weak, weak 2 i think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz: I guess e was wondering what s had for his x.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wow, tom townsend is taking a view|pg||
nt|imp_jan: by passing|pg||
nt|mmmakela: they shd find on the way that 4 @S is the spot|pg||
nt|mcarroll: May not be so easy with NS so active|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @D lead needed ....... a @S or @H makes it    @c is nuetral|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: no the right guess  difficult let us admit|pg||
nt|redgrover: would have still been time to find @D switch after a top heart lead, but too late now of course|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: declarer   will pick the@c suit with no entry in the dummy|pg||
nt|redgrover: yes, would go down if he was able to finesse|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrdct: west will soon know he has a 9 card @H fit and a nice side suit of his own so slam ought to be bid here i expect|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The operation is a success, but the patient (3@C) is not going to live|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, it's not clear that 3@H would have made either|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and in breaking news, Lavazza are on course to win a match|pg||
nt|gowdy: notpossible|pg||

pc|h7|nt|mittmouse: y|pg||

nt|mrdct: official website is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ for live scores from all tables, a webcam and other goodies.|pg||

pc|c6|nt|sunsamvar: iwhat is 3 @C ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i met bruce elliot Toronto in 79 or 80 at one of the most impressive bridge clubs i've ever seen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he was impressive too|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I don't think there was a plus score on this deal for E/W.  Even defending 2@S won't work - that contract makes|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|robinswr: he doubled on his partner's 1club opener|pg||

nt|lebridgeur: at the end   South will thank North to have a weak hand !|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: 1M-(DBL)-2N would have been Limit Raise +   -- just not sure about 3@C :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: S is in 3@C here in Open so more to Global|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: none of the NS actions took up any bidding space, so it seems that their activity could only help EW to bid to right spot and to make what theyt bid|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcarroll: Well, they got to 6@S in OR with no opposotion bidding!|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 100% agr|pg||
nt|salokin: I think W was more scared to miss a slam here|pg||
nt|salokin: without bidding slam is not that bad, just needing Qx in @H or QJ bare in @D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so a perf Roland 6|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Cheek wishes he played the 10 :)|pg||
nt|salokin: after the bidding here EW know that @H and @D are not braking in a favourable way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks for the OR report, Martin, which confirms my remark that the NS bidding was more likely to help EW than hurt them. W could tell E had a doubletoin spade and did not bid any ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: suit over 1S, so the likelihood of a heart loser was very high, hence no slam even if E has a maximum|pg||

nt|frankaus: slamm fail on this 1  - can they stay out ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't remember -- how low did spotcards go in pinochle deck -- East hand sure looked close to coming from one|pg||
nt|mildredb: Yeh Bros now on score board for this round|pg||
nt|woozle: Tough hand for EW to bid....strong 4441s are never simple|pg||
nt|gowdy: now some action here|pg||
nt|woozle: If East opens something the spade fit will probably be lost, but 3NT will still make|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: another comfy 3NT that may not be that easy to reach|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mrdct: back down to earth wiht a partscore hand now|pg||
nt|santyclz: And barely that.|pg||

mb|p|nt|redgrover: was a real shame that they were maxed in the 9th round after so many big wins against good teams|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: well, now it will be easy|pg||
nt|mrdct: north possibly not compelled to bid here|pg||
nt|pbundy: if they reach game, they'll add a bit more|pg||
nt|gowdy: wow|pg||
nt|woozle: third seat special from curtis|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: probably showing a spade stopper (Slow Lebensohl)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 and probably 2+@D  -- Precision catchall|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Did South do something wrong?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|robinswr: there goes 3nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am sure you are right, but as far as i am concerned S should just bid 3NT. after all, opps have bid two suits, so even if one of them is right to lead for the defense, they still ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have to find it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west would have to return a diamond to hold to 5|pg||
nt|woozle: Will Hanlon rip 3NT?|pg||
nt|gowdy: after P's free bid ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Our matches in round 2 are: China A vs Norway and USA Hampson (Meckwell) vs Chinese Taipei|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3nt might have denied a spade stopper|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: we had a lot of interesting hands in the last set..|pg||
nt|mildredb: yep, 6 badly needed imps |pg||
nt|gowdy: he knows  but what to do|pg||
nt|woozle: McGann doesn't really have anywhere to go except 3NT|pg||
nt|gowdy: I'm glam I'm here and not sitting W|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: this board has been played 4 times so far twice in 4@S twice in 6@S|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=9&B=25&T=O|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mmmakela: surprised Erik(saelesminde) resting in this key match|pg||
nt|woozle: 6D can be made, if that's where they finish|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: sounds a 50 point deck|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so? if N calmly passes they might lead clubs. these methods that give so much info to opps are of dubious practical value when you have 25 HCP and two balanced hands.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 sp is 1 nt without a heart stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the set  2 was a rollercoaster|pg||
nt|woozle: lots of dummy entries for the trump coup|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Hanlon thinking now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: is this going to play any better by south?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: suppose ew play 2/1, that explains the 3@c by east|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: No but North knew what was going on after the D was ducked|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lack of action by W a bit surprising, facing Nonvul foes|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good contract|pg||
nt|mmmakela: a few down ok|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on this auction E is unlikely to have only five clubs, so W can act|pg||
nt|salokin: here the precision NAT 2@C opening left the @S-fit in the dark. Which was found in th OR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, it wasn;t just the opening bid that left spades unmentioned. W had 2 chances to bid the suit|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 2@S bal was obvious|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our Round 7 matches in about 55 mins are: Yeh Bros v USA Hampson and India Venkatesh v India National|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 2S directly would be inappropriate, a balance would be in order, i;d say|pg||
nt|salokin: true, and he possible knows that either ther is a 8-c @C fit or a 9-c @S -fit|pg||
nt|salokin: in 2@H N could save a trick with a intrafinesse in @D|pg||
nt|salokin: If getting in time in hand|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no entries I guess|pg||
nt|salokin: to play the 2nd @D round (1st smal to 8) Q@D to pin the doubleton J|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S now puts his suits in proper perspective|pg||
nt|mariner1: and are in trouble here now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: NS pair nicknamed "Drinkdriver", has nothing to do with the actual meaning of the word :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oper, pls check that.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nico is teasing us.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: getting better by the minute|pg||
nt|mrdct: will score an extra @H trick at the very least|pg||
nt|jbgood: any better is also a way of putting it..|pg||
nt|mrdct: but doesnt have an obvious source of tricks|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: McGann sighed when he saw the four spades in dummy|pg||
nt|gowdy: but is it realy a 4 card spade suit or some @D try with a @S card  I don't know|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sunsamvar: so the law of probability dictates flat hands here i suppose|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugrapha3: curtis didn't realise was his turn!|pg||
nt|redgrover: a nice little convention to have there, especially if partner is prone to being 2-2 in the majors|pg||
pc|d3|nt|robinswr: 4clubs would have gone down at least one probably two|pg||
nt|mrdct: he's surely going to go after @C here|pg||
nt|mrdct: west needs to be careful not to get endplayed|pg||
nt|jbgood: he will|pg||
nt|jbgood: go for clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: so they have another call to invite in @H|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|nickf: Progressive scores in all matches are up: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=1&T=R|pg||
nt|mrdct: if south leads a @C up now and west winsm west might feel in necessary to switch to @S to get rid of the @SA entry|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mmmakela: their system is called Drink|pg||
nt|frankaus: gib makes it will Manoppo?|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect he will|pg||
nt|santyclz: GIB looks at all 4 hands.  Gives it a slight advantage.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bjacobs: A sensitive auction|pg||
nt|imp_jan: nothing against 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W established the the heart position was a bit shaky|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: i would bid    with w   cards  2@d and then 2@s   to show a weak major 2 suiter but I am much older|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbgood: but you never can tell with boye|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That duck is a good expert tactic - threatening to ruff the losing heart, whilst maintaining control of the suit|pg||
nt|woozle: I think if you're going to skip the spades to get the excellent diamonds in, you should be  planning to bid the spades later|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|mrdct: boye hoping to get the opps to open up the side suits for him|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|frankaus: not only looks but has repeated attemps if it finds a failing line :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: which wont work today|pg||
nt|mittmouse: did i really stay up for this|pg||
nt|redgrover: which may have been more appropriate on this hand|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6 shd make but the grand they bid in OR won't I suppose|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess it takes a trump lead to beat it.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
pc|h2|nt|robinswr: this is what happens when you operate and overcall 1nt with that hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OR:  ....this is what happens when you make a great bid but you are stuck with systemic agreements that gum up the works|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not as if 1D was more likely to get NS to 3NT than a 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|robinswr: maybe he should have run 6 diamonds before leading a spade|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: W is playing 2@S here in Open|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm going to jump into the operating chair now - so i'll see you all on the other side shortly|pg||
pc|s4|nt|redgrover: of course if nabil had found a fit here, game could have been easy -- his partner's major suit holding was a disappointment|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mmmakela: now 3xspades must stand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sounds like we need another Buller/Culbertson match.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: was probably worried about squeezing dummy|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: good play by Huang to not cover the 9. that made N think that W's remaining spade was the 8 or ten|pg||
nt|robinswr: tse is counting points and doesn't think his partner has any|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure why N played the ten of diamonds on the first round. that gave away a lot of information|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm told the other table is in 6S...I assume that suggests a big swing to USA Hampson|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: youngster in deep trouble in danger not to be in the first 16|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mildredb: now for the @S plays|pg||
pc|h4|nt|robinswr: but he has to lead a heart or a club and a club will defenently give up a trick|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|gowdy: well done by south in setting a very hard auction |pg||
pc|dT|nt|sunsamvar: the next few hands will wake u up George :)|pg||

nt|robinswr: i agree|pg||
nt|imp_jan: partscore battle on this one|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Might not even be a partscore battle|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: West flew the white flag ... as would I|pg||
nt|imp_jan: peace full person: tom townsend|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are in 6@H on board 4, focus now on the lead|pg||

mb|3C|nt|santyclz: 5 loser hand.  Many places that's a 2@c bid, but frequently not in the USA.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=any 16+ ,  1N=8+ BAL, game force|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@D might have pushed N/S overboard - but it might also have resulted in -200, in 2@DX|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@H looks natural but may be asking bid|pg||

nt|redgrover: what to lead from three aces and the trump queen?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: one road leads to + one:)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: club ace, so slam will make|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|vugrapha3: they whispered something, couldn't hear ,sry|pg||
nt|robinswr: but at least he could have stripped the diamonds so the opponents would have to give up a trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North can't guess wrong in @D -- for me E would hold @DAQ or split honors and I wouldn't be able to guess right|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he will find out as much as he can abt the E/W distribution before tackling @D..|pg||

pc|c4|nt|sunsamvar: but u r right Al i will get it wrong too if the @D honours were split|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|bjacobs: 3 tricks to go - I think Jan might play on diamonds now|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|bjacobs: She will then look to play 2 rounds of trumps - ducking one round, and then playing the ace.  THEN she can play her good heart|pg||

nt|ahollan1: well played -- and @D position reveals itself because West couldn't hold onto @Dspot card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: freely bid 3N down 5 vul -- that's one you don't see every day - if you're lucky|pg||
nt|mildredb: i think he could have made 12 had he pitched @H & not @S|pg||
nt|mildredb: the JT of @S came down|pg||
nt|pbundy: you may be correct, mildred|pg||
nt|mariner1: E in 1N there in Open|pg||
mb|p|nt|mittmouse: a little high at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: then can navigate to the next board by selecting next board|pg||
nt|jbgood: big business|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Looks like it|pg||

nt|mildredb: yes the 21 hcp slams are not usually bid|pg||
nt|woozle: 5S safe for EW, but how much bidding will Joe do with his 6/5?|pg||
nt|woozle: I assume that 2NT is some kind of good raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in a part score here|pg||
mb|1S|an| |nt|sunsamvar: but here the precision 1 nt may apply the brakes|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: brogeland just made a belated alert of 4@S and is talking in sigh language to west|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: *sign|pg||
nt|jbgood: no good supp in minors - still good in spades - interested if prd has a good minor suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: i am not sure if 2@h is f...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Grue just said "Contract"|pg||
nt|woozle: Redouble won't turn West on particularly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: difficult to grasp this for a youngster as Espen Lindqvist..|pg||

nt|salokin: 3@D I mean|pg||
pc|hK|nt|imp_jan: but here we are|pg||
nt|mildredb: nothing to the play on this hand|pg||

pc|h5|nt|mmmakela: six dias great contract but this time....|pg||
nt|jbgood: what did i know:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: May get a @c lead now.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: lindqvist looks like he knows what he,s doing|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i understand all of the PASSes|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i guess u cant stop short of 3nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well maybe not, but this duck makes no sense|pg||
nt|mariner1: the youth needs some swing boards there way........|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mmmakela: now a danger|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not to cash out I mean|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They need to get their tricks fast or lose them|pg||
nt|salokin: S will proably duck the lead|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Should it not make?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the open room Kit Woolsey says that the percentage play in diamond is low to the 9 spot|pg||
nt|jbgood: not only what he is doing - but what he and prd are doing together:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: even more important|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not many losers ... but are there 10 winners?|pg||
nt|pbundy: yep|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mmmakela:  6 dias might, at least dbld it will|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: the blackwood defense would have worked great, cash all your aces|pg||
nt|woozle: not hard to place the hearts on the auction|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Grue: "I cant blame you"|pg||
nt|woozle: win the heart, two spades ending in dummy, heart up...if ducked, another spade across and another heart up|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: of course no dbl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kit: the reason I think low to 9 is right play in slam is that it will be tough for East to duck from King-doubleton|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: so if 9 loses to jack, I would then take finesse on way back|pg||
nt|santyclz: Isn't the normal play leading the 9 from dmy?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so not pecentage play but best play?|pg||
nt|rogerclee: even if yeh knew his partner had a doubleton diamond, ducking seems wrong|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: overtake and play @D to show @S reentry|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|imp_jan: sure|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jbgood: bye all - enjoy the show from Down Under:) |pg||
nt|marlowepi: what was the double of 3D? would 3H be invitational?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk4: suitplay says low to 9 and if it loses to J, cash A|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok believe, dbl finesse close 2nd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: East should know not to duck any @C|pg||
pc|c9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|redgrover: a couple of hours ago the youth were dreaming of a spot in the top bracket, how quickly things change|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mittmouse: if he cashes his hearts he wins the board or 3 imps|pg||
nt|gowdy: and so it shall be|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: Kit: suitplay thinks that East will always duck from Kx -- in real life, that ain't so|pg||
nt|santyclz: Bye Jon, thanks.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it is more common to play that dbl would be an invitation and 3H purely competitive|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Grue discussing with dummy now, quietly, that this contract is cold|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Cheek didnt play a card but McGann claimed|pg||
nt|redgrover: still a 5-VP buffer at the moment though|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 1 down|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|santyclz: Normal play in 7 is the Q from dmy.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So there is a psychological factor to be considered too|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|imp_jan: in the crossruff|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: oops|pg||

mb|1C|nt|santyclz: Speaking of @ds...|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i think it is practical to just transfer to 3c opposite a 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 boards to go in this match|pg||
mb|1N|nt|santyclz: Wild match, 7 imps in 7 boards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: especially if transfer is 2@S so opener can show/deny @C support|pg||
nt|woozle: NS can make 3C, EW might make 2H|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|bjacobs: Not many deals to stir the blood on this set|pg||
nt|pbundy: perhaps they play varying NT ranges with either seat and/or vulnerability|pg||
nt|woozle: 1C opening probably ends any thoughts of NS playing clubs|pg||
nt|redgrover: one team that is in serious trouble is italy-lavazza, needing 43 VPs from this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: it is always annoying to have more points crammed into two suits that total 3 cards than in the ten cards of the other two suits. but W will cope with the disappointment|pg||

nt|mmmakela: check the 109's in N hand|pg||
mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: that reopening double puzzles me|pg||
nt|robinswr: not sure why hampson reopened with a double|pg||
nt|robinswr: it is a takeout double but when does he expect to make a game|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: an imp here for aussie youth if this makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: And indeed, 3NT makes easily on this layout|pg||
nt|mariner1: 43 VP not possible|pg||
mb|3N|nt|imp_jan: what else could south bid over the 1@h response?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@D is a massive underbid ... but what alternative is there?  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: danger|pg||
nt|gowdy: down  got to get light in this room eh|pg||
nt|woozle: diamond lead leaves this with 6 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N transfer to @C?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: y |pg||
nt|redgrover: true, hence their being in serious trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: lead here helps|pg||
nt|mariner1: found 7, looking for 8 and 9 now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West will duck the first @h and some homework for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: OR bid to 4@H|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: 3NT suggested, and it certainly has some merit|pg||
nt|salokin: OR ended up in 4@H when W after the same bids jumped to 4@H|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|santyclz: Nice shift.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wonder if 3S denied 5H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suspect you are right|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: interesting choice of leads rather than @D for a look|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lol. west does not lead from @D ak and east leads from his q into a dangerous looking jtx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 4nt was not the tool here, aces not the issue|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a general invite of 5@S would be my choice|pg||
nt|mariner1: Youth currently tied with Australian Open for 15th|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: i guess that as long as bids like this double keep getting opps to do the wrong thing, NS will continue to make such bids|pg||
nt|rogerclee: if east showed exactly 4-4 in the majors i think west should not accept a slam try, he knows his hand is quite bad opposite a 44(32) slam try|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's complicated by the 3-card heart support.  How about a wacky 2NT?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: but it does make sense - if North held KJx and East AQ10 - then need extra entry for 2nd @H through|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lebridgeur: 2 @s tricks  2@h tricks and a @d will do the job|pg||
nt|mariner1: N in 3N here in Open too, @D lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mildredb: 2 more rounds  to Q - top 8 teams Q, unless Yeh Bros not in top 8, then the top 7 + Yeh Bros. team|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Others might manufacture a jump shift.  2@S or 3@C, but that just postpones the crisis|pg||
pc|h4|nt|woozle: 2H will be claimed soon|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: :)  Sunil I hadn't even noticed dummy's @D10  --  sorry partner, I couldn't get a count on DUMMY|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrdct: official website is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ for live scores from all tables, a webcam and other goodies.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: perhaps a little bizar, but i would opt for 3@c|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

nt|santyclz: It look as if they're off the Schnieder.|pg||
nt|pbundy: different options for what declarer might do on this hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: I think 3@C is a lot better than 2@S ... you can always keep going back to diamonds over clubs|pg||

mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: but i don't know if that means North CAN bid again|pg||

mb|p|nt|gowdy: I don't care who he is I X|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3 or more Red cards = Penalty|pg||

nt|woozle: Hmm...reverse flannery in action?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: 4spades is rkc|pg||
nt|redgrover: should be duplicated at the other table, this might come down to the last board|pg||
pc|cA|nt|imp_jan: i will suggest the hand for the bidding panel of my magazine (IMP)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was more than slam :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E bid according to the Lore of Total Tricks. The 2S raise was perhaps a bit adventurous at the colors. partner might easily end up bidding 4S to make and going down 500|pg||
pc|c8|nt|santyclz: I'm told: he's been upgrading since he was 8. They say he missed his 1st slam at 16 :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 5 minutes of session time left|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a good one.  It's actually a version of what's called the Bridge World Nightmare Hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In the BWNH, you open 1@D on a strong hand, and partner responds in your 3-card major|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6 spades best?|pg||
nt|mildredb: at this point Yeh Bros stand 3 & China Long Ahu are tied for 8th|pg||
nt|gowdy: as we shall  see here 2@H is 54 10 hcp|pg||
nt|gowdy: better than passing it out !|pg||
pc|c2|nt|woozle: McGann might have thrown this one in, for all the right reasons|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|frankaus: nice treatment here 2NT ask for short suit trial  - i expect|pg||
nt|imp_jan: meanwhile another bidding problem here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Over 2 decades, it's never been solved|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3n = good|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but how to reach it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6 looks good|pg||
nt|salokin: yep or 6N with the @HK in the leaders hand :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|robinswr: 4nt - 5nt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wow|pg||
pc|cK|nt|robinswr: i play that 5nt shows the spade king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know entire structure, but  something like  15 teams qualify + Yeh Bros, then 2 brackets and sort of a double elimination|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Difficult from here|pg||
nt|rogerclee: yeah, i disagree with 2@S, though it is a good strategy to raise aggressively over an opponent's negative double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: vulnerability is for grownups|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that strategy pays off best, though, when there are TWO unbid majors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as in 1D-2C-D-3C|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: N is looking for D ki8ng now|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|santyclz: A chance for Netherlands.|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect this will make|pg||
nt|redgrover: 3NT appears to be making on bd 8 at the other table, so the youth are still alive|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: just made   par for Ns again|pg||
pc|hK|nt|frankaus: mannopo finds the killing lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well that lead certainly gives declarer a chance to go down.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gowdy: nice @s guess :)|pg||
nt|woozle: It was going to be guessed later anyway|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gowdy: and may come back if S thinks stiff Q|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this could be interesting|pg||
pc|dA|nt|santyclz: No winning options.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our matches in round 2 in about half an hour are: China B vs Norway and USA Hampson (Meckwell) vs Chinese Taipei|pg||
pc|d4|nt|robinswr: in an IMP match one should discuss what bids mean|pg||
nt|mittmouse: are the italians really last wow|pg||
pc|d9|nt|robinswr: in slam auctions|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What's the coroner say about this "dead" contract|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needs to guess clubs I suppose in 3rd trick?|pg||
nt|frankaus: cant draw trumps - cant not draw trumps - no winning options|pg||
nt|mildredb: now a little to-ing & fro-ing :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: true, but even so, on what basis would S accept ANY grand slam try? could he have less?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Meckwell in 6@S, flirted with the grand|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|santyclz: I'm willing to make a prediction here.  This hand won't be finished before time is up.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mmmakela: right -1|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|santyclz: Has to draw trumps and play for the @ckxx onside.|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe Lasut will duck 2 @C LOL|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|santyclz: Needs the @d finesse or 5@ss and the @dk in the same hand.|pg||
nt|mildredb: or not :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think declarer needed to play top @S then 2nd round finesse|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: not exactly. it is not like you can preserve both possibilities. you will play for the diamond finesse, so it is 50% i think|pg||
nt|pbundy: well - with the club spots this might be safer route, actually|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|frankaus: was a joke :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: true|pg||
mc|8|nt|robinswr: you would take the diamond finesse since anything else is anti percenage|pg||
pg||

mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|kareno: 5@c is a fine contract here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last board :( |pg||
mb|3C|nt|kareno: Six isn't so fine off an ace and the king of clubs, specs :)|pg||
nt|gowdy: and 6 is so bad ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: It's counter to the advice of Benito Garozzo who says not to bid slams on a finesse.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lest we forget -- Fiona Brown once again great job as our vugraph operator|pg||
mb|4D|nt|gowdy: who would have the @C K   the guy with the points|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Oh, he would NEVER overcall without that card :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|gowdy: perhaps |pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gowdy: but 2 contols off rule|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: we are now in the grace period|pg||
nt|imp_jan: here 4@h is the place to be|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with a really bad hand and a fit, the best policy is often to keep quiet, lest you allow an opp to diagnose shortness in your suit in his pd's hand|pg||
nt|mildredb: always bad to go back dn in a cold game|pg||
nt|pbundy: for sure, mildred!|pg||

nt|imp_jan: no results so far|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well Boye had 20 and pd opened, so maybe 1 more move....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree totally|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: that doesn;t happen to me too often :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: last board - more to come, Specs, so stay around for the next Qing rounds|pg||
nt|woozle: Probably a NT partial for NS|pg||
nt|mariner1: we have more Yeh Cup, Bulgaria and Portugal on the schedule in a few hours|pg||

nt|salokin: meckwell found an artificial way to 6@S they found the 6-2 @S fit early and could cuebid to investigate slam|pg||

nt|mariner1: excellent job!!!|pg||
mb|4N|nt|santyclz: This is the last bd of this segment.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW card says they almost always open 1@D when 4@D & 4@C|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i agree with that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even in the context of weak NT?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 'moder ' 2n opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Many thanks to our lovely and talented vg oper, Nicolette.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: restart in 1h 45|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but oddly enough, when everyone does agree with me, it is usually when i have recommended a Pass|pg||

nt|mariner1: Association and Australian Bridge Federation for allowing us to broadcast from this|pg||
nt|mariner1: prestigious event. Therese Tully, David Stern, and Patrick Huang have been|pg||

nt|mariner1: Last but not least, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Sharon Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no|pg||

nt|mariner1: lovers worldwide!|pg||
nt|mariner1: also many thanks to the specs for their tips and comments which really do help!|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S also in Open on 9|pg||
nt|redgrover: i hope andy isn't thinking about passing this...|pg||
nt|mariner1: can they bid 6@C?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I am afraid  h e  might but  4@h might make !   as 6 @c|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: andy making morse code signals on his head|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Youth are back into 14th with 2 boards to score!|pg||
nt|redgrover: the 4@H doesn't exactly improve his hand|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I must admit it is difficult to find acll with west hand after 4 @d|pg||
nt|mariner1: Yeh is 16th so that does not help as there are now only 15 spots|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it's always a bit dodgey cueing shortage in partner's suit|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: * find a call|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: right dave|pg||
nt|redgrover: this will be one of the most important bids andy has had to make, a lot of pressure here|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open  1@H - P - 1N - 2@C - P - 2@S so far|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: the team coming 17th hasnt scored up this board yet either|pg||
mb|5D|nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation to the Queensland Bridge Association and Australian Bridge Federation for allowing us to broadcast from this prestigious event. Therese Tully, David Stern ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and Patrick Huang have been instrumental in making all this possible.  And Mr Yeh of course.|pg||
nt|mildredb: looks that way|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the overcall  makes the differnce|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: 3n was in danger after the (unlikely) diamond lead|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but always made|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You'd think North would unleash a 5-card major probe, if South tends to open with a 6-card major :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The play is awkward for South.  He HAS to win a spade in dummy to take the heart finesse.  So what spade does he insert here?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: declarers problem is that if east comes in with @hk he might get diamonds through|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am dazzling the kibitzers here with my analysis|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open  1@H - P - 1N - 2@C - P - 2@S - P - 5@C P - 6@C in Open!|pg||
mb|6C|nt|Walddk4: 6@D can make|pg||
nt|frankaus: wd nic - roland, markku, Joe kibs tu 4 ur company |pg||
nt|santyclz: Last chance for Netherlands this set.|pg||
nt|woozle: Might make 3|pg||
nt|redgrover: the chinese in 17th place have drifted down, so there is more breathing space now -- as long as the irish pair doesn't bid 6@C|pg||
nt|mwigor: which they have|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: may be   he gets it right     but @d is the best lead by far|pg||
nt|redgrover: darn|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: next matches Japan vs China HubeiDongFeng and Australian Selected vs Global|pg||
mb|p|nt|yeh2009: And a great team of helpers and volunteers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Also, do you lead the @H10 from dummy or low?  It's not trivial|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: the Spec have been very quiet tonight :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mmmakela: guess 6 dias is makeable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not even bad enough to be a Roland slam.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Great slam|pg||
nt|yeh2009: Spade lead allows you to make 9 trums and a trump lead allows for ruffing heart finesse|pg||
pc|s5|nt|santyclz: This is the last bd of this match.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: most partnerships i know would not be able to get to this comfortable 2C contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1nt was pretty comfortable also|pg||
nt|mariner1: only a 1 VP edge,,,, so................|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: If only the Dutch could have avoided the 7-level, they would have had a fine match|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well he takes his 75 % chance|pg||
nt|salokin: another slamish hand 12 tricks on 2 of 3 finesses ... except a bad @H break|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: well that will cost a lot to australian young tema      NS  played perfectly as Hanlan and Mc Gann ireland in OR|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: 7@D down twice |pg||
pc|s2|nt|imp_jan: @hk left or ace of diamonds rigth|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fair enough|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was just so messy to take the heart finesse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, he's still only got 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So the whole hand is messier than my son's bedroom.  And that's saying something|pg||
nt|imp_jan: lol|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but decl is still in control due to the fav lay out|pg||
nt|imp_jan: ah england took over|pg||
nt|imp_jan: north did bid 3n after 1d-1h-3d on brd 18|pg||
nt|imp_jan: have to leave you now (heading for the dentist, no no the coup, but the real stuff i am afraid), cu soon|pg||
nt|pbundy: in shock after 2@DX earlier on.........  that was a spectacular hand|pg||
nt|pbundy: 16 imp swings not terrifically common|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry play went too quickly for me :S|pg||
nt|mildredb: np, Fiona - you've done a great job tonight - thank you!|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes; for sure Fiona!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: :) thanks|pg||
nt|mildredb: Bye - come back for next sets|pg||
nt|pbundy: bye all - thanks, mildred!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: norway now in 17th and like to win at least a game swing on this board as their opps stopped in 3@C|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|santyclz: Thanks to my excellent fellow commentators, Marshall and Steve.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the unblocking in diamonds was not just showing off. N has organized the play so that E would have to make 2 discards while seeing only one card from E|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to the Yeh brothers for organizing this trny and bbo for providing us the platform on which to view it.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: enjoy :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I do not undersatnd East line of play shortening in hand when he suffers from trump length|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: true enough. in most partnerships i know, though, W would not pass 1NT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mittmouse: y definitely if 1 club denies 4d in a balanced hand it makes your checkback sequences easier|pg||
