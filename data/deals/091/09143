nt|hedyg: if it is a start|pg||
nt|hedyg: we seem to be waiting for the players|pg||
nt|santyclz: Most common players of all playing here.|pg||
nt|hedyg: the operator will enter their names as soon as they sit|pg||
nt|hedyg: usually we are not shown the boards before the players arrive for security reasons|pg||
nt|hedyg: our operator is Carlos Araujo, ola Carlos :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if this will be a fun board, though.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: hi,welcome to Porto|pg||

nt|hedyg: that explains the score|pg||
nt|santyclz: Dance on the table?|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice weather in Porto?|pg||

nt|hedyg: welcome Joao :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe you can tell us about the players|pg||

nt|hedyg: well, same country!|pg||
nt|jfaria: of coursae|pg||
nt|santyclz: For information on Porto, you could start at:  http://www.portugalvirtual.pt/_tourism/costaverde/porto/index.html|pg||
nt|jfaria: course|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: olá,João,boa noite :)|pg||
nt|jfaria: boa noite Carlos|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is João then !|pg||
nt|jfaria: we can start guessing about the auction :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am showing off my accents!|pg||
nt|jfaria: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: N will open a weak 2suiter?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they play it|pg||
nt|jfaria: iff|pg||
nt|jfaria: they play 2 suiters...|pg||
nt|hedyg: if not E will open 1@c and S will Ghestem that|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: players arriving|pg||
nt|jfaria: otherwise pass i guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: E has 4 losers, maybe open something strong|pg||
nt|jfaria: maybe 1@s in that case?|pg||
nt|hedyg: S should overcall anyhow|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: some problems in closed room,will start when connection avaiable|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then nobody can stop N|pg||
nt|jfaria: no doubt|pg||
nt|hedyg: so we will wait for them, Carlos?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We don't use initials, only last names|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and pls insert flags|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Carlos|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets start!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: yes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: yeah!!!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: now Ghestem|pg||
nt|jfaria: if they play michaels no 2 suiter available|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|jfaria: lol|pg||
nt|santyclz: for some meanings of "on"|pg||
nt|hedyg: popular convention in Portugal|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria: but I think 1 @s does it|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: here it does|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Playing Ghestem is the certain way of conceding 2300, because at least one always forgets|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: no Ghestem,sry :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: np to bid 4@s in S|pg||

nt|jfaria: 3x 6?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Where do you think partner's values are for a quant 4NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria: a balance between the 15 count and the fifth @d..|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jfaria: the 15 won |pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think this is a maximum|pg||

nt|Walddk4: We have a closed room now|pg||

nt|hedyg: surely|pg||

nt|marlowepi: not too often you go down 500 in 4NT when you would probably be +600 in 3NT. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: George - getting back to the former greats from Canada - have you read the book about Murray-Kehela?|pg||
nt|woozle: Now some game for NS - 4H or 3NT will likely make|pg||
nt|redgrover: australian open team has just dropped out of the 16, but the youth are still fine at this point|pg||
nt|othered1: just another push|pg||
nt|me argent: en fin|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I see|pg||
nt|lestergold: a few extra keys came into play|pg||
nt|dburn: it doesn't - it's just the operators trying to catch up with events since the power cut|pg||
mb|p|nt|mittmouse: y a very good book|pg||
mb|3N|nt|robinswr: he he had stripped the diamonds, he would have gone down only one|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the old adage is "when id doubt, run the long suit". amazing things can happen|pg||
nt|robinswr: i agree|pg||
nt|imp_jan: partscore battle on this one|pg||
nt|woozle: something like 3 passes, 1H:1NT then North's best guess...or maybe a 2NT opening|pg||
nt|gowdy: and now    can we find 4 @H|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like another 2-suited raise|pg||
nt|shevek: 16+16|pg||
mb|p|nt|mittmouse: two great characters|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is where the all purpose strong hand double is handy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing team out, winning team one more chance. In fact, teams from the lower must win all of it from now on to win the event|pg||
nt|mariner1: big 5 imps there|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i was hoping you'd say otherwise -- every time i try to buy it the dealer is sold out :(|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Might not even be a partscore battle|pg||
nt|woozle: 2NT probably kills thoughts of 4H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is a 1@C opener then my point on last hand was right|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open W bid 2 @H here......|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland its 9 a.m. and i a havent had my ugly sleep yet|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Repeating, I believe the score is Netherlands 42 - England 43|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: West flew the white flag ... as would I|pg||
nt|imp_jan: peace full person: tom townsend|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are in 6@H on board 4, focus now on the lead|pg||
mc|10|nt|redgrover: semi forcing means you can pass with a 5332 12-count|pg||
nt|mariner1: the youth are now in 15th spot however Yeh is 14 so they have a one spot cushion|pg||
nt|mariner1: left|pg||
nt|sac: 2spades was a bit timid I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Total prize fund  US$ 168,000  (winners 70 K)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: These two teams are in the undefeated pool and the losers will get one more chance tomorrow|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can make 3 of a minor|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is a roland favourite a 20/20 hand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: well played -- and @D position reveals itself because West couldn't hold onto @Dspot card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: freely bid 3N down 5 vul -- that's one you don't see every day - if you're lucky|pg||
nt|mildredb: i think he could have made 12 had he pitched @H & not @S|pg||
nt|mildredb: the JT of @S came down|pg||
nt|pbundy: you may be correct, mildred|pg||
nt|mariner1: E in 1N there in Open|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down 4?|pg||
nt|lestergold: certi but am clumsy on a keyboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|mittmouse: a little high at the other table|pg||
mb|1C|nt|frankaus: then can navigate to the next board by selecting next board|pg||
nt|jbgood: big business|pg||
nt|mittmouse: it may be a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if this 1N is 13-15, 14-16 or 15-17  :(|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with a 15-17 1nt opening by south north may be tempted to bid the vul game|pg||
nt|pbundy: here's a very lucky slam that i surely would not expect anyone to reach|pg||
nt|mildredb: lucky slam|pg||
nt|gowdy: to watch perhaps  that would bug me|pg||
nt|mrdct: The official website is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ which has live scores from all matches, a webcam and other goodies.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: but i did miss a trick and a half|pg||
nt|sac: NS was not on the same trck here it seems about the lenghts of North´s suits|pg||
nt|mariner1: in other match Netherlands 27  Australia 7 after 5 boards|pg||
nt|lestergold: i thought down 5|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6h plus 5 spades|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: will check|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mmmakela: 3 dias the winner here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i didnt see tom discard any winners|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: no partscore hands lately|pg||
nt|jbgood: minor slam interest - not what S can handle|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: boye's hand poised over his bidding box|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4@h seems the place to be|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: nope|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so far these deals would be better fare for a Board-a-Match event|pg||
nt|mildredb: yes the 21 hcp slams are not usually bid|pg||
nt|woozle: 5S safe for EW, but how much bidding will Joe do with his 6/5?|pg||
nt|woozle: I assume that 2NT is some kind of good raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in a part score here|pg||
nt|askgaard: Every hand is suitable for a NT opening these days :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sunsamvar: but here the precision 1 nt may apply the brakes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs a 10 bagger to make this|pg||
nt|sac: Interesting 2nt What is the range supposed to be?|pg||
nt|shevek: I like 2N a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: nice solution to the bid problem|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: brogeland just made a belated alert of 4@S and is talking in sigh language to west|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: *sign|pg||
nt|jbgood: no good supp in minors - still good in spades - interested if prd has a good minor suit|pg||
nt|imp_jan: interesting rebid: 2@c, some would rebid 1n|pg||
mb|p|nt|salokin: not needed :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: was -5|pg||
nt|mariner1: will E pop 3@H now?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|imp_jan: i am not sure if 2@h is f...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Grue just said "Contract"|pg||
nt|woozle: Redouble won't turn West on particularly|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D is an interesting treatment here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jbgood: difficult to grasp this for a youngster as Espen Lindqvist..|pg||
nt|mittmouse: as long as 3c is not forcing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Surely yes|pg||
nt|salokin: 3@D I mean|pg||
nt|shevek: who cares abt range with that @c suit|pg||
pc|c6|nt|imp_jan: but here we are|pg||
nt|mildredb: nothing to the play on this hand|pg||
nt|woozle: Although I notice that 6S makes easily on a heart lead|pg||
nt|gowdy: easily is an overbid :0|pg||
nt|askgaard: Don't know the range, but probably 20-21|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: six dias great contract but this time....|pg||
nt|jbgood: what did i know:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: May get a @c lead now.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: lindqvist looks like he knows what he,s doing|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: haha|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i understand all of the PASSes|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i guess u cant stop short of 3nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well maybe not, but this duck makes no sense|pg||
nt|mariner1: the youth needs some swing boards there way........|pg||
nt|fabsayc: italian mexican :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: where are they going to play?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mmmakela: now a danger|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not to cash out I mean|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They need to get their tricks fast or lose them|pg||
nt|salokin: S will proably duck the lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes - on bidding unlikely that EW have a 4-4 @S fit|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he knows it's his turn :)|pg||
nt|askgaard: Here it made things simple|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: Should it not make?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the open room Kit Woolsey says that the percentage play in diamond is low to the 9 spot|pg||
nt|jbgood: not only what he is doing - but what he and prd are doing together:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: even more important|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not many losers ... but are there 10 winners?|pg||
nt|pbundy: yep|pg||
nt|me argent: carefull defence should nip 4@Ss if EW get there|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mmmakela:  6 dias might, at least dbld it will|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: - Running Scores refresh as needed|pg||
nt|me argent: @HJ would b a good start|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the blackwood defense would have worked great, cash all your aces|pg||
nt|woozle: not hard to place the hearts on the auction|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Grue: "I cant blame you"|pg||
nt|woozle: win the heart, two spades ending in dummy, heart up...if ducked, another spade across and another heart up|pg||
nt|askgaard: Had N shown a gameforce singlesuiter (@c) they might have gone overboard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt looks like a scramble bid|pg||
nt|dburn: he may not get the chance|pg||
nt|mariner1: I thought 3 @H, maybe not|pg||
pc|hA|nt|me argent: @C9|pg||
nt|dburn: but he may not need it|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is an ugly looking spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes not a lot of winners|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hard to analyze, i will guess 2 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: why 4/3 fit insted of 6/2 fit |pg||
nt|dburn: doubtless South intended this sequence to show three diamonds and five or six hearts|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mmmakela: of course no dbl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kit: the reason I think low to 9 is right play in slam is that it will be tough for East to duck from King-doubleton|pg||
nt|me argent: or 6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: one objective of the treatment is to rightside contracts|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so if 9 loses to jack, I would then take finesse on way back|pg||
nt|santyclz: Isn't the normal play leading the 9 from dmy?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so not pecentage play but best play?|pg||
nt|rogerclee: even if yeh knew his partner had a doubleton diamond, ducking seems wrong|pg||
nt|mwigor: indeed that happened in the other room and they are playing 5@c|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: overtake and play @D to show @S reentry|pg||
nt|shevek: if north opens a @c EW might finet their @s fit...|pg||
nt|mwigor: 1@c 1@h (X) 3@c (4@s) 5@c|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: players taking a short break now|pg||
nt|shevek: Very clever bid .. and got the lead she deserved! (from a spec)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We will not necessarily continue with the same matches on vugraph in the second half. Organisers will decide when they see all first half scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: From the upper bracket: Yeh vs Sweden 8-1 after 5 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Unfortunately we have no running scores from other matches at this point|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are working on it|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: players back now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|imp_jan: sure|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer needs to draw trumps ending in dummy.  This hand is a bit trickier than it looks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jbgood: bye all - enjoy the show from Down Under:) |pg||
nt|marlowepi: what was the double of 3D? would 3H be invitational?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: suitplay says low to 9 and if it loses to J, cash A|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok believe, dbl finesse close 2nd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: East should know not to duck any @C|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: That play works as well|pg||
pc|sA|nt|redgrover: a couple of hours ago the youth were dreaming of a spot in the top bracket, how quickly things change|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mittmouse: if he cashes his hearts he wins the board or 3 imps|pg||
nt|gowdy: and so it shall be|pg||
nt|me argent: good start for NA|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kit: suitplay thinks that East will always duck from Kx -- in real life, that ain't so|pg||
nt|santyclz: Bye Jon, thanks.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it is more common to play that dbl would be an invitation and 3H purely competitive|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Grue discussing with dummy now, quietly, that this contract is cold|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Cheek didnt play a card but McGann claimed|pg||
nt|redgrover: still a 5-VP buffer at the moment though|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 1 down|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 now|pg||
nt|dburn: but North may have interpreted 2NT followed by 3@d as a "bad 3@d bid" wheres a direct 3@d would have been a "good 3@d bid"|pg||
nt|dburn: very thoughtful play, in truth|pg||
pc|cT|nt|santyclz: Normal play in 7 is the Q from dmy.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So there is a psychological factor to be considered too|pg||
nt|lestergold: david obviously doesnt believe that there are 6 hearts in the south hand!|pg||
nt|dburn: I know how many hearts South has|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: scores finally up http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=3&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is another david around |pg||
nt|dburn: but you asked why 3@d instead of 3@h, and I am trying to tell you|pg||
nt|lestergold: the one who is sitting in theeast seat|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh crossed wires david|pg||
pc|c8|nt|imp_jan: in the crossruff|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oops|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gib says diamond 2 for down 3 now, fascinating|pg||
nt|dburn: and don't believe the results anyway|pg||
nt|mariner1: scoreboard has scores different from ours|pg||
pc|s7|nt|robinswr: this time he's runing the diamonds|pg||
pc|s8|pc|hT|nt|imp_jan: cash diamonds first of course (just happened)|pg||
nt|me argent: should be tough 2 make from here|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to hold Qx Jxx @S to no losers|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Stansby got to set up @D's for @C pitches other room it seems|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: official score is not up to the minute and youth are in big trouble|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the scoreboard believes that on board 3 England gained 500 on a board where they in fact lost 500|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bravo|pg||

nt|ahollan1: did i miss something?  maybe @SJ was NOT discarded|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6 was dual part score swing so 6 more imps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: -1 probably|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: room has been told a little behind the over rate |pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Speaking of @ds...|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i think it is practical to just transfer to 3c opposite a 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 boards to go in this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Wild match, 7 imps in 7 boards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: especially if transfer is 2@S so opener can show/deny @C support|pg||
nt|woozle: NS can make 3C, EW might make 2H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that's a big 13 bad def other room good here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H on the Moysian played well in Open|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bjacobs: Not many deals to stir the blood on this set|pg||
nt|pbundy: perhaps they play varying NT ranges with either seat and/or vulnerability|pg||
nt|woozle: 1C opening probably ends any thoughts of NS playing clubs|pg||
nt|redgrover: one team that is in serious trouble is italy-lavazza, needing 43 VPs from this match|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D off in Open was good defense|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: it is always annoying to have more points crammed into two suits that total 3 cards than in the ten cards of the other two suits. but W will cope with the disappointment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ah -- confirmation that @SJ did win a trick -- not discarded|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What's the rebid here?|pg||
nt|gowdy: and Mec went domn in 6 @S  whata swing  on 25|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=10&T=I|pg||
nt|mariner1: live results (almost up to date)|pg||
mb|d|nt|imp_jan: shaken not stirred|pg||
nt|dburn: that was a 14-16 no trump at the other table|pg||
mb|2H|nt|frankaus: today is not the day to bid 7@D - so far :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: When this gets passed out, South will be aghast|pg||
nt|mmmakela: check the 109's in N hand|pg||
nt|askgaard: Some might be tempted to invite game opposite the 15-17NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: that reopening double puzzles me|pg||
nt|robinswr: not sure why hampson reopened with a double|pg||
nt|robinswr: it is a takeout double but when does he expect to make a game|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: an imp here for aussie youth if this makes|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S sure seems easier|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 3@S not the spot|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3 will be a breeze and more out|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like it takes a @H lead to beat 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: And indeed, 3NT makes easily on this layout|pg||
nt|mariner1: 43 VP not possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5d needs a heart lead to defeat it surely|pg||
nt|dburn: and it wasn't obvious to pass it with the North cards, but no great harm done|pg||
mb|2S|nt|imp_jan: what else could south bid over the 1@h response?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@D is a massive underbid ... but what alternative is there?  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: danger|pg||
nt|gowdy: down  got to get light in this room eh|pg||
nt|woozle: diamond lead leaves this with 6 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N transfer to @C?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: y |pg||
nt|redgrover: true, hence their being in serious trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: lead here helps|pg||
nt|mariner1: found 7, looking for 8 and 9 now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West will duck the first @h and some homework for declarer|pg||
nt|me argent: thats an impressive OR result 4 the stanbys|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: OR bid to 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: tom says lead a heart|pg||
nt|mariner1: might have been better to pass 3N|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe, but...|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1 prefer 1s over a heart becuase now he has to guess|pg||
nt|dburn: here, double shows 4-5 spades and double of 2@h shows three spades|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk4: 10 tricks was impressive|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe a heart switch now|pg||
nt|lestergold: landed on feet of course|pg||
nt|dburn: so no one actually had to guess anything|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A nice support double.  Everyone loves them, don't they?|pg||
nt|lestergold: apologies dabvid i suspected|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@s over 1@h would have denied spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2s better spot than a no trump|pg||
nt|lestergold: understand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|askgaard: But Versace is probably right that it isn't worth it with his bad distribution and soft values|pg||
nt|askgaard: Same evaluation in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes if n/s are warned off but it will be a heart lead whatever they play in now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: 3NT suggested, and it certainly has some merit|pg||
nt|salokin: OR ended up in 4@H when W after the same bids jumped to 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a game of chicken|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: much better|pg||
pc|h2|nt|santyclz: Nice shift.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wonder if 3S denied 5H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suspect you are right|pg||
nt|lestergold: very good judgement by n/s |pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: interesting choice of leads rather than @D for a look|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lol. west does not lead from @D ak and east leads from his q into a dangerous looking jtx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 4nt was not the tool here, aces not the issue|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a general invite of 5@S would be my choice|pg||
nt|mariner1: Youth currently tied with Australian Open for 15th|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: i guess that as long as bids like this double keep getting opps to do the wrong thing, NS will continue to make such bids|pg||
nt|rogerclee: if east showed exactly 4-4 in the majors i think west should not accept a slam try, he knows his hand is quite bad opposite a 44(32) slam try|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Pete is telling me good play by Stansby last hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: a good time to go chicken tho|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's complicated by the 3-card heart support.  How about a wacky 2NT?|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is the practical correct play|pg||
nt|mariner1: sorry was telling a kibber how to make 4@S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: but it does make sense - if North held KJx and East AQ10 - then need extra entry for 2nd @H through|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seamon did indeed switched to a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk4: switch|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lebridgeur: 2 @s tricks  2@h tricks and a @d will do the job|pg||
nt|mariner1: N in 3N here in Open too, @D lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mildredb: 2 more rounds  to Q - top 8 teams Q, unless Yeh Bros not in top 8, then the top 7 + Yeh Bros. team|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Others might manufacture a jump shift.  2@S or 3@C, but that just postpones the crisis|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @SK to the ace, spade to the jack, @SQ and a heart|pg||
pc|cT|nt|woozle: 2H will be claimed soon|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the actual layout is one of the few where no spade loser possible|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: :)  Sunil I hadn't even noticed dummy's @D10  --  sorry partner, I couldn't get a count on DUMMY|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mrdct: official website is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ for live scores from all tables, a webcam and other goodies.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: perhaps a little bizar, but i would opt for 3@c|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i think two finesses is the % play|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sac: nice jack of diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2 imps better.  And 2 imps could be gold|pg||
pc|s5|nt|redgrover: i can't see a winning line on a diamond lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: here's a shortcut  http://tinyurl.com/yeh-2009-results|pg||
nt|mariner1: not an obvious one for sure......... would need help|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: did he really play A+Q@H on last trick?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|santyclz: It look as if they're off the Schnieder.|pg||
nt|pbundy: different options for what declarer might do on this hand|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bjacobs: I think 3@C is a lot better than 2@S ... you can always keep going back to diamonds over clubs|pg||
nt|askgaard: Right. North discarded the @h7 Roland, perhaps not so helpfull|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s9|nt|pbundy: better win the ace!|pg||
nt|mariner1: why with  3 2 split favored hook twice?|pg||
nt|me argent: not with wests entry problems|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: yes, no cost|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: saves one entire click :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mittmouse: are the scores posted for the 3rd round yet|pg||
nt|ahollan1: George - not only that but also running totals of THIS set!|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|cQ|pg||
mc|9|nt|ahollan1: biggest surprise -- at very bottom of the list  Italy - Lavazza|pg||
nt|ahollan1: surprise is an underbid -- that's more of a SHOCK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is this a knockout match, or part of a round-robin?|pg||
nt|dburn: both, in a sense|pg||
nt|bjacobs: gee, you think you ask a simple question ... :)|pg||
pg||

pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: XX= 3 cards @H or a strong hand|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i agree that the key is the dull shape of the W hand|pg||
nt|rogerclee: yes i think 5c is the correct bid|pg||
nt|pbundy: penultimate hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: the 4th heart in dummy was only good to throw his master diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a knockout match, but the losers will not be eliminated from the main competition|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lebridgeur: another good result for NS  this board 8|pg||
nt|redgrover: have to hope justin makes this at the other table, or the kids are gone|pg||
mb|d|nt|imp_jan: that's what i mean and over 4@C you correct to 4@H|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S makeable if NS are amazingly aggressive|pg||
nt|mariner1: (I am pulling for the youth because I remember what it was like to be a young player|pg||
nt|mariner1: back before we had electricity :) )|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: another 7 to Standby who bid the 3 card @H suit and was raised|pg||
nt|mariner1: 68% vs 28% in favor of one hook no matter how often you can get to dummy|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: i can accept 5@C also, but would bid 6 with marshall's example|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: what shouid west do tough ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S is a good spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, my concern was that W might look first and foremost at his spades over 5S|pg||
nt|woozle: more likely one or two overtricks in 2S|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 boards to go and neck and neck my nerves cant take it|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: he should not (since we have KCB)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the ancient idea was that asks for good trumps, not really necessary these days|pg||
nt|rogerclee: east offering up a huge number here|pg||
nt|woozle: Hmm...reverse flannery in action?|pg||
nt|me argent: @S J loses and a @H ruff 4 down1|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: US|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: USA on a roll now.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh wow this is a steal it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: highway robbery, 401 style|pg||
nt|mariner1: in the other match Yeh 26  i Norge 13 after 10 so I Norge has halved the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: the same contract being played in both rooms well i never|pg||
mb|4C|nt|robinswr: 4spades is rkc|pg||
nt|redgrover: should be duplicated at the other table, this might come down to the last board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D was a phantom, but difficult to know|pg||
nt|sac: phanton save in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: i will suggest the hand for the bidding panel of my magazine (IMP)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was more than slam :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E bid according to the Lore of Total Tricks. The 2S raise was perhaps a bit adventurous at the colors. partner might easily end up bidding 4S to make and going down 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I'm told: he's been upgrading since he was 8. They say he missed his 1st slam at 16 :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 5 minutes of session time left|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a good one.  It's actually a version of what's called the Bridge World Nightmare Hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In the BWNH, you open 1@D on a strong hand, and partner responds in your 3-card major|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6 spades best?|pg||
nt|mildredb: at this point Yeh Bros stand 3 & China Long Ahu are tied for 8th|pg||
nt|gowdy: as we shall  see here 2@H is 54 10 hcp|pg||
nt|gowdy: better than passing it out !|pg||
nt|mariner1: same contract and the same way|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4c not quite what david was hoping for|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: McGann might have thrown this one in, for all the right reasons|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK, thanks. The winners are in good shape for some loot.  The losers will have to play the winner of Stansby - Norge|pg||
nt|lestergold: well nmo double no trouble or at least mot too much trouble|pg||
pc|dA|nt|frankaus: nice treatment here 2NT ask for short suit trial  - i expect|pg||
nt|imp_jan: meanwhile another bidding problem here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Over 2 decades, it's never been solved|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3n = good|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but how to reach it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6 looks good|pg||
nt|salokin: yep or 6N with the @HK in the leaders hand :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|robinswr: 4nt - 5nt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wow|pg||
nt|askgaard: Impossible not to bid 5@d here too with 5 card support|pg||
pc|d2|nt|robinswr: i play that 5nt shows the spade king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know entire structure, but  something like  15 teams qualify + Yeh Bros, then 2 brackets and sort of a double elimination|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Difficult from here|pg||
nt|rogerclee: yeah, i disagree with 2@S, though it is a good strategy to raise aggressively over an opponent's negative double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: vulnerability is for grownups|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that strategy pays off best, though, when there are TWO unbid majors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as in 1D-2C-D-3C|pg||
nt|shevek: since quite a few specs asked, I'll explain the format:|pg||
nt|shevek: Top 16 go through to the 32-board knockout stage, with the top 8 getting a double shot|pg||
nt|shevek: The 48-board final is on Monday|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N is looking for D ki8ng now|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffee hand folks well im off to make one|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, that was a mini no trump, a penalty double, a pre-emptive 3@d, a second takeout double, and a natural 4@c|pg||
nt|dburn: that's 21st century bridge, mister|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is likely togo a couple off|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Makes you pine for the 20th Century|pg||
nt|lestergold: and another few imps to the dutch|pg||
pc|d9|nt|santyclz: A chance for Netherlands.|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect this will make|pg||
nt|redgrover: 3NT appears to be making on bd 8 at the other table, so the youth are still alive|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: just made   par for Ns again|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|frankaus: mannopo finds the killing lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well that lead certainly gives declarer a chance to go down.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gowdy: nice @s guess :)|pg||
nt|woozle: It was going to be guessed later anyway|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and credit Stansby for playing 4@S well too|pg||
nt|me argent: it should prove difficult for EW to get sufficent 50s to score well here|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|gowdy: and may come back if S thinks stiff Q|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: this could be interesting|pg||
pc|sT|nt|santyclz: No winning options.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our matches in round 2 in about half an hour are: China B vs Norway and USA Hampson (Meckwell) vs Chinese Taipei|pg||
nt|shevek: 1st stage was a 10 round delayed Swiss of 10-board matches|pg||
nt|askgaard: He knows he is dead. Just hoping for a heart endplay at the end.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a grosvenor|pg||
pc|s2|nt|robinswr: in an IMP match one should discuss what bids mean|pg||
nt|mittmouse: are the italians really last wow|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I wonder at what point in the hand they realise "we wuz robbed"|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|robinswr: in slam auctions|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What's the coroner say about this "dead" contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe three off even certainly not too pretty for england|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, but for the power cut we would have known how North-South in the other room came to play in 2NT|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mmmakela: needs to guess clubs I suppose in 3rd trick?|pg||
nt|frankaus: cant draw trumps - cant not draw trumps - no winning options|pg||
nt|mildredb: now a little to-ing & fro-ing :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: true, but even so, on what basis would S accept ANY grand slam try? could he have less?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Meckwell in 6@S, flirted with the grand|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes|pg||
pc|c5|nt|santyclz: I'm willing to make a prediction here.  This hand won't be finished before time is up.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mmmakela: right -1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R  for running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|me argent: im guessing 11 imps to NS|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|santyclz: Has to draw trumps and play for the @ckxx onside.|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe Lasut will duck 2 @C LOL|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needs the @d finesse or 5@ss and the @dk in the same hand.|pg||
nt|mildredb: or not :)|pg||
nt|askgaard: But in this layout it won't be there.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: i think declarer needed to play top @S then 2nd round finesse|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn: but for the moment, we will assume that they were playing 22nd century bridge|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not exactly. it is not like you can preserve both possibilities. you will play for the diamond finesse, so it is 50% i think|pg||
nt|pbundy: well - with the club spots this might be safer route, actually|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u ruffs with his omeny now|pg||
nt|lestergold: money|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 off after all then|pg||
pc|d6|nt|frankaus: was a joke :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: true|pg||
pc|c7|nt|robinswr: you would take the diamond finesse since anything else is anti percenage|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: but with 4-1 @C, not sure if that that works|pg||

nt|mariner1: 2@S also in Open on 9|pg||
nt|redgrover: i hope andy isn't thinking about passing this...|pg||
nt|mariner1: can they bid 6@C?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I am afraid  h e  might but  4@h might make !   as 6 @c|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: andy making morse code signals on his head|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Youth are back into 14th with 2 boards to score!|pg||
nt|redgrover: the 4@H doesn't exactly improve his hand|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I must admit it is difficult to find acll with west hand after 4 @d|pg||
nt|mariner1: Yeh is 16th so that does not help as there are now only 15 spots|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it's always a bit dodgey cueing shortage in partner's suit|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: * find a call|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: right dave|pg||
nt|redgrover: this will be one of the most important bids andy has had to make, a lot of pressure here|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open  1@H - P - 1N - 2@C - P - 2@S so far|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: the team coming 17th hasnt scored up this board yet either|pg||
nt|othered1: everyone seems to have their own structure over an inverted raise.  Not sure what their's is.|pg||

nt|bjacobs: and Patrick Huang have been instrumental in making all this possible.  And Mr Yeh of course.|pg||
nt|mildredb: looks that way|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the overcall  makes the differnce|pg||
nt|askgaard: Me neither.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|imp_jan: 3n was in danger after the (unlikely) diamond lead|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but always made|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You'd think North would unleash a 5-card major probe, if South tends to open with a 6-card major :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The play is awkward for South.  He HAS to win a spade in dummy to take the heart finesse.  So what spade does he insert here?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: declarers problem is that if east comes in with @hk he might get diamonds through|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am dazzling the kibitzers here with my analysis|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open  1@H - P - 1N - 2@C - P - 2@S - P - 5@C P - 6@C in Open!|pg||
nt|askgaard: Time to stop now...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 9 imps back|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 9 imps or so back to I/C|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S certainly has play here|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6@D can make|pg||
nt|frankaus: wd nic - roland, markku, Joe kibs tu 4 ur company |pg||
nt|santyclz: Last chance for Netherlands this set.|pg||
nt|woozle: Might make 3|pg||
nt|redgrover: the chinese in 17th place have drifted down, so there is more breathing space now -- as long as the irish pair doesn't bid 6@C|pg||
nt|mwigor: which they have|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: may be   he gets it right     but @d is the best lead by far|pg||
nt|redgrover: darn|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nickf: next matches Japan vs China HubeiDongFeng and Australian Selected vs Global|pg||
nt|me argent: now 10imps for EW|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yeh2009: And a great team of helpers and volunteers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Also, do you lead the @H10 from dummy or low?  It's not trivial|pg||
nt|othered1: Chip Martel advises: 2H is 15+ GF, asking, 2N is 12+ notrumpy|pg||
nt|lestergold: well im not sure how 4h came to be doubled in the open room altho it happens to be 1 off|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mildredb: the Spec have been very quiet tonight :)|pg||
nt|askgaard: Ok, so a sensible auction, I think|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mmmakela: guess 6 dias is makeable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not even bad enough to be a Roland slam.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Great slam|pg||
nt|yeh2009: Spade lead allows you to make 9 trums and a trump lead allows for ruffing heart finesse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This hand is a case in point.  E/W allowed N/S to push them around.  Look at what happens to 5@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm not saying East should have bid it ... but he must have been at least a bit tempted|pg||
pc|dA|nt|santyclz: This is the last bd of this match.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: most partnerships i know would not be able to get to this comfortable 2C contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1nt was pretty comfortable also|pg||
nt|mariner1: only a 1 VP edge,,,, so................|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: If only the Dutch could have avoided the 7-level, they would have had a fine match|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well he takes his 75 % chance|pg||
nt|salokin: another slamish hand 12 tricks on 2 of 3 finesses ... except a bad @H break|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lebridgeur: well that will cost a lot to australian young tema      NS  played perfectly as Hanlan and Mc Gann ireland in OR|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: 7@D down twice |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|imp_jan: @hk left or ace of diamonds rigth|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fair enough|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was just so messy to take the heart finesse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, he's still only got 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So the whole hand is messier than my son's bedroom.  And that's saying something|pg||
nt|imp_jan: lol|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but decl is still in control due to the fav lay out|pg||
nt|imp_jan: ah england took over|pg||
nt|imp_jan: north did bid 3n after 1d-1h-3d on brd 18|pg||
nt|imp_jan: have to leave you now (heading for the dentist, no no the coup, but the real stuff i am afraid), cu soon|pg||
nt|pbundy: in shock after 2@DX earlier on.........  that was a spectacular hand|pg||
nt|pbundy: 16 imp swings not terrifically common|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry play went too quickly for me :S|pg||
nt|mildredb: np, Fiona - you've done a great job tonight - thank you!|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pbundy: yes; for sure Fiona!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: :) thanks|pg||
nt|mildredb: Bye - come back for next sets|pg||
nt|pbundy: bye all - thanks, mildred!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: norway now in 17th and like to win at least a game swing on this board as their opps stopped in 3@C|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C asking for @D back|pg||
nt|lestergold: in spite of the high card majority in the e/w hands not clear what they would have pl;ayed in if they had come into the auction|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear that it does - a diamond to the ace and @cQ ruffed may be enough for the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: well england now desperately in need of a couple of good boards|pg||

pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: yes, it is S who knows the Ds are solid. even if 4H is a Q in their methods, does S need TWO honors to cue for a rebid suit?|pg||

nt|hedyg: same here, claim :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: i think there is something to be said for 2D in response to 2C. it gives S a chance to make 2 natural rebids, and if you end of bidding diamonds twice naturally, that will take you ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: past 3NT and so S will have a pretty good idea of your strength|pg||

nt|bjacobs: 6 boards to go.  PLENTY of time Mike :)|pg||

nt|dburn: but that was then, and this is now...|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if we are to be philosophical now will very soon become then|pg||
mb|1C|nt|dburn: well, there are six more in this segment|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S play better than 1N here NS|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dburn: and sixteen in the next|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S NS play better I meant than 1N EW|pg||
mb|d|nt|askgaard: Very close match. The players have mostly taken similar actions in the two rooms so far.|pg||
nt|dburn: not if no one bids at all, it won't|pg||
mb|p|nt|askgaard: Hi Kit|pg||
nt|mariner1: not a lot makes now NS (nada)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S as in Open reasonable spot|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S much better than 2nt however|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south hand has potential in poker|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would not consider passing 1N with N hand|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|dburn: again, double shows 4 or 5 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|askgaard: Lauria has never been shy to overcall on very minimal values|pg||
nt|kit: likely to get to 3NT one way or another|pg||
nt|kit: probably 3@C by North, 3NT by South|pg||
nt|dburn: and 1NT is alerted because it does not necessarily show a heart stop|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: light 2@C, only the void makes it attractive|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think we learned the bid david|pg||
mb|p|nt|askgaard: Versace knows their style of course, so he won't hang him|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c may be for the majors, and 2@d may be the prelude to a game try in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes however the void is there|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: and  for garbage stayman|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w have the high card points but n/s have better prosects in their spade fit that e/w in their dim fit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|me argent: but i think JC chose the correct route|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I have a friend (in the audience) who claims that a final contract of 2NT is not in his system.  2NT Is ALWAYS forcing|pg||
nt|dburn: and 2NT shows optimism, and pass shows pessimism|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the spade suit is what s working well for declarer here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sac: maybe 3 hearts is a better call now than 3nt|pg||
nt|kit: they didn't exactly right-side this, but difficult to do when hearts, not diamonds, is the worry suit|pg||
nt|askgaard: Trying to get partner to bid 3NT on @hQx, Søren?|pg||
nt|kit: problem with bidding 3@H is that if pard has nothing in hearts she won't bid 3NT, and 3NT is gone forever|pg||
nt|sac: yes|pg||
nt|sac: not after 3 spades which should be waiting|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: live scoring is now up on the website|pg||
nt|kit: why should it be waiting when partner has bid spades?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R  for running scores in all matches|pg||

nt|fabsayc: yikes|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S has a tough road though|pg||
nt|dburn: and North, with all those extra values...|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 4s looks a bit too much work to do|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that lead didnt exactly hur|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mariner1: S needed to pay attention to the 1N behind him|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kit: Versace decided a heart lead would be futile, so he led a diamond hoping his partner had 5 of them I guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: three diamond leads will promote a trump trick|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes S has a good high/low split pot hand|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: - Running Scores refresh as needed - most of the matches are still very close|pg||
nt|me argent: reversing dummy looks rgt|pg||
nt|mariner1: he only holds 3 king and big hand behind|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|lestergold: so this board will not produce much honey for anyone|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: well establishing the heart suit is one thing- enjoying it may be another thing|pg||
nt|mariner1: Fudd's Law teaches position is everything :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: tom needs to continue punching dummy with diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i thought location was everything, but maybe that no longer applies|pg||
nt|dburn: it was perfectly normal for South, with kings in both his partner's suits, to issue a game invitation|pg||
nt|mariner1: Push something hard enough and it will fall over. - Sir Sidney Fudd's First Law of|pg||
nt|mariner1: Opposition|pg||
pc|h8|nt|askgaard: It was not realistic to find partner with a good enough suit AND and entry to the hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: newton thought of it first|pg||
nt|dburn: it was close to ridiculous for North to accept it, but in these recessionary times one bids game on every hand and hopes that there will be a play for it|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep this must be the winning defence|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wish 2NT was all they could make.  Then I could wheel out a comment that I have in reserve ...|pg||

nt|jfaria: the others just dont :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass ok with me|pg||

nt|cindy: i prefer to play you must take a preference but i think im in the minority|pg||
nt|reisig: South should get better hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right, cindy, that is why i am thinking that maybe a delayed 2C should show 4-5 in minors|pg||
nt|cindy: and pass is for penalty|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think you can agree that 2@c always shows both minors|pg||
nt|cindy: huh|pg||
nt|reisig: Pass = penalty ???|pg||
nt|hedyg: a delayed 2@c yes i agree|pg||
nt|hedyg: so pass first|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think you can, once S has passed and N bids 1S, which is what i was asking about|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes then 2@c should be for minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe even 4@c and 5@d|pg||
nt|reisig: what would 1N mean?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think maybe specifically with longer clubs. a delayed 1NT can be = length in minors|pg||

nt|imp_jan: still some excellent hands to go|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS got enthused here some how in Open|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1@H = spades.  As you can see, the Dutch don't call a spade a spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: well n/s could easily bid game here and im not convinced that 4s cant be made |pg||
mb|3D!|an|!s supp|mb|4D|nt|Walddk4: It can be made with open cards, but it may not|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: maybe it can, as could 3NT, at double dummy, but...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: david using the power of the boss suit to create as much havoc as possible at favourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|dburn: what?|pg||
nt|po-s: I wonder  - if North´s double was penalty what is he supposed to bid now when South passed 2S?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike's David is East|pg||
nt|imp_jan: north may try 2nt..|pg||
nt|imp_jan: or dbl or pass...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do not think david would be bidding on his tram tickets at any other vulnerability|pg||
nt|dburn: he bid spades because he had them, and he bid them again because he still had them|pg||
nt|imp_jan: did 1n promised 3@s?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all doubles after penalty double should be penalty (somebody's law)|pg||
nt|dburn: yes|pg||

mb|4S|nt|othered1: are Ew in a forcing auction?|pg||

mb|p|nt|sac: no|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am pretty confident that Versace's pass is forcing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that may help|pg||
nt|fabsayc: very scarey|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another unreadable lead|pg||
nt|me argent: dangerous lead 4 the defence|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike your son bids what he has :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: this illustrates the problems with doubling an opening 1NT with a distributional hand -- you don't know what to do after that.|pg||
nt|dburn: ..well, we shall see|pg||
mb|p|nt|askgaard: Right|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is going to be a nailbiter|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: not that it will do him a power of good - surely even Brink will pass this double|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this could be interesting|pg||
nt|lestergold: disaster for england in open room so this looks like a fair sized swing to the dutch|pg||
nt|dburn: if declarer does make it, that might be too much for England to recover|pg||
nt|dburn: and this lead will help|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed david which is why its a nailbiter for those of us who may be a little biassed|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|askgaard: If they play takeout'ish doubles, east might have doubled because of the vulnerability|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kit: He might -- but he knows his partner will be expecting a second diamond|pg||
nt|imp_jan: after the lead, will north work out that south had a stiff heart?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can beat this two, but probably wont|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S play means a lot here|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think outh will be fooled by tom's mandatory false card|pg||
nt|lestergold: i meant north|pg||
nt|dburn: well, there are one or two Dutch spectators here also (among them the mother of the current declarer) but it is up to us ruthlessly to suppress partisan feelings and to commentate ...|pg||
nt|dburn: dispassionately upon the play|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an easy hand to manage|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|kit: and for all he knows they have a 9-card heart fit|pg||
nt|mariner1: will cash out for off 1 now.......... or should|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: while versace was thinking what card to play North sort of claimed down 1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1 IMP difference between setting it one or two tricks. 12-13|pg||
nt|dburn: that's a pretty dispassionate effort, Mike - well done|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|askgaard: yes. If both players are overreaching to penalize it will sometimes be disastrous|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Versace said "I never seen in my life", I think referring to the lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 boards, 11 imps, still close|pg||
nt|imp_jan: next brd seems good for england|pg||
nt|lestergold: my commentary is designed to be dispassionate my feelings about the desired outcome are not|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess East will play a trump here - nothing else looks remotely attractive|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: mind you, this line of defence...|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|nt|askgaard: A lot of work to do here.|pg||
nt|kit: even on actual hand, if East had doubled is it so clear for West to pass?  Why couldn't East's hearts and spades have been reversed?|pg||
nt|sac: you got a point Kit|pg||
nt|kit: Can he handle this -- 1 club trick, 1 spade trick, 2 diamond tricks, so he needs 6 trump tricks|pg||
nt|askgaard: Vul vs Not it would be automatic to pass a takeout double in west (although it work badly of course)|pg||
nt|askgaard: (might work)|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|kit: I believe a spade to king was necessary there|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: Yes, JoAnna could have pitched a club|pg||
nt|kit: joanna did well to pitch a spade it seems to me|pg||
nt|kit: But if he had led a spade, North can win, play ace and a heart, and declarer is a trick short|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But a diamond ruff now will see him home|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Because North must follow to the next club too|pg||
nt|sac: he is home now if he plays diamond and then ruff clubs|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's why a club pitch had been better before|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then JoAnna could have overruffed the last club|pg||
nt|kit: will overruffing the last club defeat the contract?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, then exit in trump and declarer must lose 2 spades|pg||
nt|kit: but can play a spade after second club ruff I believe|pg||
nt|sac: if you guess hearts you coul make 4 hearts by playing a spade from dummy instead of a diamond|pg||
nt|sac: early on|pg||
nt|kit: so I think declarer can succeed -- if North pitches a spade, do what he is doing.  If North pitches a club, then ruff another club and play a spade up?|pg||
nt|askgaard: I agree with 10 tricks no matter what, if declarer guesses the position|pg||

nt|cindy: 2S is ewww|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: this S hand also met S's rerquirements for an opening bid. we are zeroing in on the threshold|pg||

nt|patricck: finessing for 10@D after South dropped the Q@D on 2nd round|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open was off 1 in 3N and got a @D lead|pg||
nt|dburn: well now...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This was a necessary contract |pg||
nt|dburn: there is a case for leading a spade|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: and there is a case for leading a heart|pg||

pc|h5|nt|lestergold: but hes not on our team david so he led a hearty|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Something fairly disappointing is going to happen here for the Dutch|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but which heart?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And declarer will find himself seeking out either spade queen or diamond king for the contract|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kit: Looks like declarer will just have to hope that both red suit finesses are on -- I don't see anything else|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mariner1: well I am assuming N would rise 1st @H too and he might not|pg||
nt|me argent: @H lead beats it also|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: hm it looks like the favourabkle dim position should mean 9 tricks available|pg||
nt|patricck: actually was @D lead, but play could go as suggested on a different lead as well|pg||
nt|dburn: what favourable diamond position?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south off to the best lead for teh defence|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||

pc|h2|nt|lestergold: tom will be forced to play for the only position which makes namely the dim position|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a kelsey twist, will likely make on this more normal lead|pg||
nt|dburn: again - what diamond position?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If declarer had played a lower club, it might have been all over|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What will Townsend pitch on the 4th heart I wonder?  What a hand!|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d2|nt|mariner1: win this in hand , lead @H|pg||
nt|dburn: that thought before playing @hQ was because Brink recognised that his partner might have led from @hAJ93|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3/3 break with q onside|pg||
nt|imp_jan: south inserted the queen, though double dummy the ten was better..|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d3|nt|dburn: in which case...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: I thing he should have led jack of clubs from hand -- the way he played it, he might have had entry problems to dummy if North had A9xx of clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: no he will run @D 1st it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: hell pitch a dim cash the clubs and then take as informed a view as he can abou the spades|pg||
mc|9|nt|dburn: yes, I know, but after you have led to the jack and cashed the king on which South plays the queen - what diamond position?|pg||

nt|bjacobs: But I will make a prediction now that the score will be 1 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: it would have to be if tom made a premature claim unless he announced which way he was taking the spades|pg||
nt|po-s: guess he said "the rest is mine"|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: bd 29 to be reviewed by the TD|pg||
nt|po-s: so clearly one down|pg||
mb|1H|nt|me argent: however if NS use same def that i play with JC i predict north bids 2@Ss over 1nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: the train defense?|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: VOILA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Notice Justin's 1NT overcall in the other room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: David made a comment earlier about someone being thrown to the sharks tomorrow ... might be a good prediction|pg||
nt|po-s: not allowed any finesses unless stated in claim|pg||
nt|Walddk4: However, that did not stop the Dutch from bidding game|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I'll come back to that one|pg||
nt|imp_jan: in the open room south overcalled 1nt over 1@h opening|pg||
mb|4H|nt|askgaard: The point should be that *everybody* play the @hT from @hTx, so when south plays the 9...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: nice call!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: e/w want to not get too high here|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|askgaard: But it is not wise to overthink these things I guess|pg||
nt|sac: people tends to falsecard with the ten from 10x so the nine could be a dobblefalsecard, Lauria knowing it is 109 or Q9|pg||
nt|kit: That is too deep for me.  I just go with 5 to 2 odds, so it won't matter what opponents do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Undo please|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I suppose he might think that South with 109 doubleton could play the ten, whereas with Q9 doubleton he had no choice|pg||
nt|po-s: he won´t be holding the last heart|pg||
nt|dburn: not an absurd thing to do|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The losing team will get one more chance tomorrow|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The winning team will play a semi-final against the winner of Sweden vs USA Hampson|pg||
nt|po-s: are we not in for 3way matches now?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tomorrow yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But not the winners of the two matches in the top bracket|pg||
nt|po-s: they play a "final"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R  for running scores in all matches|pg||
mc|9|nt|Walddk4: but he knew that North started with five hearts and South with two, which is sufficient to override any restricted choice considerations|pg||
nt|imp_jan: same bidding as in the open room|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: how?|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: Yes it is too early for him|pg||
nt|po-s: but during that match I thought the others played 3way stuff|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: no idea, very fast|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh well, now England need to bid the cold slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: looked like a ht a club and a dim to lose|pg||
mb|r|nt|fabsayc: however this is only first segment|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H on the Moysian fit played well in Open|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: http://www.yehcup09.com.au/  - Tournament site|pg||
nt|po-s: what about their minutes?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: haha roland very funny|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe played the @dQ from dummy with South contributing the 7|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kit: E-W could well get to slam here, and the cards are very friendly|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=5&T=I|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 12 extremely lucky tricks are there|pg||

nt|fabsayc: now what?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Weinstein thinking|pg||
nt|me argent: blackwood?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i'm not a mind reader :)|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: - Running Scores refresh as needed|pg||
nt|me argent: im kidding but 4nt seems rgt|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think that's the only possibility - he must have misguessed how the diamonds were|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not a nice hand to have to lead from poor tom found the worst as it happens|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: correct|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not that easy for E-W to get to 6@C now I must confess|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm still trying to come to grips with Roland's cold slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6@C is cold. Squeeze|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's not cold after 2 cans of beer, I can guarantee you that|pg||
nt|mwigor: a finesse a break and a squeeze (plus finding the @cJ)|pg||
nt|dburn: 3NT seems to have had some chances also, but...|pg||
nt|lestergold: how did 3N go off in open?|pg||
nt|mwigor: paul ducked the @c twice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Try MOVIE, Mike|pg||
nt|po-s: heart lead|pg||
nt|mwigor: after a @h lead had removed dummy's entry|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 6@C is on, but if you take yr 50% chance you go down|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mariner1: kibbers saying 6@D makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: in open room they are in a relay auction, north still thinking|pg||
nt|lestergold: i see ht lead double club duck no entry very slow tis morning|pg||
nt|po-s: two rounds of clubs, spade finesse but only 8 tricks|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahalim: of course, just ruff a @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mariner1: 6n might have a play on  squeeze|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: on heart lead you must finesse and draw spades before tackling clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes we have 2nd segment of 16 boards after a short break|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Since PO never was in time trouble, he doesn't know what that means|pg||
nt|imp_jan: still 1 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes indeed still cant make|pg||
nt|dburn: the Hacketts, with their loose four-card major style, have become among the best in the world at playing shaky 4-3 fits|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: It's much more spectacular to play on the squeeze rather than the finesse when you are on vugraph|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: so another few imps on the way for england|pg||
nt|lestergold: trouble is what if spade is wrong and clubs break 2/2 then u go off by playing on s[pades first|pg||
nt|po-s: I didn´t say you should, only you must|pg||
nt|dburn: well, maybe North "should" have @sK for his opening bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Besides, if you really are in 6@C, I think you will make it. North is a favourite to have both red kings after his opening|pg||
nt|imp_jan: i would say 'must '|pg||
nt|mwigor: and Axx of @c with N isnt so unlikely|pg||
nt|dburn: so it's not all that silly to play on spades before clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree david l|pg||
nt|lestergold: wasnt suggesting it was silly|pg||
nt|po-s: yes you were|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would definitely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Gentlemen, please|pg||
nt|brolucius: North is not likely to hold only two clubs after the 1@C opening, it seems.|pg||
nt|lestergold: u reading my mind if so wrong|pg||
nt|po-s: sadly I don´t know how to make smileys|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: nor do i per|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I can teach you in 30 minutes|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|po-s: don´t show off David|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That is how long it takes to teach a Swede :)|pg||
nt|po-s: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he hasnt taken our advice|pg||
nt|dburn: and yet, however silly it may not have been...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|me argent: with such good @Ds not suprising north didnt find a fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: squeeze will materialize now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and perhaps more on 16 ....|pg||
pc|s9|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: why david do u think that david did not play spadesw first?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's your son, you should know|pg||
nt|po-s: strange 2NT bid by East - couldn´t West just have a bunch of clubs?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did you not teach him this game?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm... we are not telepathic|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I was surprised by the 2NT as well. West might choose to pass on a weak hand with long clubs, surely?|pg||
nt|jtr: South could just have the @sK and North AJ@cs doubleton|pg||
nt|lestergold: er i might have...|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps he thought you found it silly|pg||
nt|lestergold: the game|pg||
nt|jtr: Playing @ss would not be so clever then|pg||
nt|lestergold: we all agree that the finesse had to be right so why not play them first|pg||
nt|lestergold: as precaution |pg||
nt|jtr: Leave me out of the 'we' please|pg||
nt|lestergold: so how would u have played this david?|pg||
nt|lestergold: lot of dav ids aound|pg||
nt|jtr: The way your son has|pg||
nt|mwigor: on board 29 the directors are ruling 50% of 3NT making and 50% of 3NT down one|pg||
nt|mwigor: so the end result is 2 IMPs to England rather than the 10 being shown at the moment|pg||
nt|bjacobs: mimicking King Solomon?|pg||
nt|mwigor: we can't enter this in BBO|pg||
nt|po-s: really?|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats kind to tom he cant complain about that|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: when their trumps are as good as J109 seventh, you should expect them to make whatever they bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A spectacular lead in the open room|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that ruling is illegal, but if everyone accepts it, then it is so|pg||
nt|mwigor: it sounds like tom wasnt entirely to blame|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mwigor: he asked a question and either it or the answer was misunderstood|pg||
nt|mwigor: why is it illegal david?|pg||
nt|po-s: you can´t let a clamer make a finesse |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|imp_jan: well i am afraid the dutch found their waterloo at the gold coast (so far)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|mwigor: he asked if they were cashing a @h|pg||
nt|po-s: unless he says so or has found someone to be void|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: Zmud still thinking in Open..... this could win the match depending|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mwigor: and believed he was told they were so was claiming down one|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mwigor: except of course they were not|pg||
nt|dburn: the laws relating to claims are relatively clear - that is, they are only about as clear as pre-stressed concrete|pg||
nt|po-s: why was it registered as making 3 then?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't award split scores after a claim. Either the contract makes or goes down, depending on what line declarer suggested|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you can award split scores after absolutely anything nowadays|pg||
nt|dburn: directors just love splitting scores - they think it keeps everyone happy|pg||
nt|lestergold: i may be very stupid but on this occasion i do not understand why david didnt play on spades first|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s7|nt|po-s: didn´t West lead a spade against 2H? Spectacular??|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=3&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: - Running Scores refresh as needed|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|patricck: no, spectacular lead on board 16|pg||
nt|po-s: but you can´t award a finesse, not even half a finesse|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|d7|pc|hK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|brolucius: On this deal, it seems that North would open 1@C with a doubleton club only when his shape was 4-4-3-2. In that case, with four spades and having opened the bidding, he would be a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: big favourite to hold the @SK.|pg||
nt|dburn: as jtr says, North might have had @cAJ and South @sK|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: one final hurdle for the defence|pg||
mc|8|nt|bjacobs: jumped ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: when i originally suggested that (as a remote possibility) i was told i was stupid becauase of north's opening bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: TD here now|pg||
nt|dburn: but the truth is that playing clubs first is the normal thing to do at the end of a long day|pg||
nt|po-s: nobody said you were stupid|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: split score in 29|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: will be back with that|pg||
