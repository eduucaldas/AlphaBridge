mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mariner1: this is an absolutely gorgeous site..... Roland should have sent us!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Right.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.  Welcome from the beautiful Poconos where it's -10c and snowing hard.|pg||
nt|swanson: N-S could afford to bid spades up to the 3-level, but they haven't found a way to enter the auction.|pg||

mb|p|nt|janm: 2@d had a very wide range here and East, with nice shape and a little extra in terms of values invited something higher - I think they'd better stop here though|pg||

mb|1N|nt|mariner1: this is Open Pairs so we will not have scores shown......|pg||

nt|swanson: I would have preferred to pass with the South hand with the plan of making a takeout double of hearts if E-W try to play at the two level.|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @H lead works for defense for taps|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: Fiona was also an excellent Vugraph Operator during the Yeh Cup!|pg||

mc|9|nt|janm: EW certainly got the better of this round, but it's not clear how much|pg||
nt|swanson: I think they won by a bunch.  TOugher this round, they have to play against themselves.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Are we watching leaders or random draw?|pg||
nt|nickf: to be expected. MAtheson is the current Australian Open Pairs Champ - he's about 20 and Jan Cormack has been a leading international for about 30 years|pg||
nt|nickf: 1 table from the 7 table final|pg||
nt|mariner1: my guess is leaders,,,,, Nick probably knows|pg||
nt|swanson: I would think random. Too tough to set up to watch only the leaders.|pg||

nt|swanson: N-S are on for game here but it will not be asy to bid.|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||

nt|nickf: I suppose EW will move to NS here|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|janm: Weak NT and 3NT on the strength of the good diamond suit|pg||

nt|mariner1: interestingly any card from dummy works here|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|janm: Assuming S goes right in diamonds, which seems likely, this will be a great result for NS - not only bidding & making 3NT but an overtrick because of the lead|pg||

mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|swanson: 3NT was anti-field - I believe one should just take their best shot to make the contract in that situation.|pg||

mc|10|nt|vugrapha3: He could have hooked to the T@d, I spose :)|pg||

nt|janm: I think declarer had a complete count on West's hand, so knew that if the @d Q was on, it was dropping|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not really after e showed out on the 4th @s.|pg||
nt|mariner1: right John, and he should not have cashed the last @H|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 6@H has play but does not make|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mrnye: I would have bid 2H on the north cards here - with two working doubletons, good sidesuit and good aces on the outside|pg||
mb|3H|nt|davidstern: Welcome to Nye Griffiths|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Nye|pg||
nt|davidstern: Who BTW is sitting at the venue commentating|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|davidstern: He may be able to get more up to date information during this round|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|davidstern: This is the final round of a 3 session final|pg||
mb|6H|nt|mrnye: looks like N-S are headed too high now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrnye: luckily for them they have only one trump loser, but unfortunately there is nothing they can do about the diamond loser|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: no real making like........  not a bad slam, just will not make|pg||
nt|davidstern: I dont want to be in this slam wthout the heart ten|pg||
pc|h2|nt|santyclz: Unless getting that lead.|pg||
nt|mrnye: yeah it's not a good slam to be in|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mrnye: will go down on a lot of bad trump breaks and requires the diamond finesse as well|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wish trick.|pg||
mc|11|nt|mrnye: but late in the event, pairs will often try for big scores to have any chance of making a decent finish|pg||

nt|mrnye: even if they do it at great risk|pg||
nt|mariner1: Tania is on the ball! :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Peter Cox on my left is wondering if you're all complaining about the A@h lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am sitting at the mezzanine above the playing area which is sensational - great light, windows down one wall and  spaciously spaced tables|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: 4@H EW best spot here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|santyclz: No because it really didn't matter this time and we're too tired to.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Just because it is Peter just say YES|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|mariner1: well I expected 4@H W|pg||
nt|mrnye: this auction should show 5/5 or 6/4 I think, not 5/4 since you would go via stayman with 5/4 and then jump to 3M over 2D|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ally, you can tell Peter that he bid well until he passed 3NT. On this auction Edelstein must be 2-3 in the majors|pg||
nt|davidstern: I hate this auction. I would bid 4@H and hope partner has one 3 card major|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|mrnye: agreed, david|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|mrnye: even a 5-2 fit rates to play better than 3NT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|davidstern: Oh yes|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|davidstern: As we are about to see|pg||
nt|mrnye: a good rule is to avoid playing in 3NT on highly distributional hands - it's very rarely correct|pg||
nt|santyclz: A perfect example of why a 6322 nt should have a 3 card major.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|davidstern: In the bulletin I noted that 3NT should be avoided with the possibility of a doubleton opposite a doubleton I guess the same applies for doubleton opp void|pg||

nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Ally Morris (Australia), our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: many thanks to the the Queensland Bridge Association, Charles Page, and the ABF|pg||
nt|mariner1: for helping BBO bring us the vugraphs!|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators Jan Martel, Joe Shair,|pg||
nt|mariner1: and John Swanson (USA), Nick Fahrer. Nye Griffiths, and David Stern (Australia),|pg||
nt|mariner1: and Roland Wald (Denmark).....I am Rob Brown (USA)........|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mrnye: 4S by west is the best contract here since you can pitch two clubs from dummy and avoid having to take teh club finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: Last but not least, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates,|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mrnye: but the extra trick would be the difference between a 50% board and a 90% board on a hand like this, since you would expect most pairs to play 4H or 4S by east|pg||
