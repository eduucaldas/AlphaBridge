nt|ralfwil: lie.. sry|pg||
nt|snorris: 6 @c is a good contract|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Martin, Hans|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No Tony, but I heard about it. Wrong explanation by South to West that made him remove 2@SXX|pg||
nt|idblu: i understand we have the 11th and 12th place team playing each other...it is swiss teams format|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure but hopefully thee|pg||

nt|mariner1: both rooms are starting with board 1 so we will see results as we go|pg||
nt|snorris: not likely|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well lets hope for more excitment this match|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So the score was adjusted to 2@SXX down 4 = 2200|pg||
nt|snorris: hi all|pg||
nt|idblu: S is Brazilian internationalist Diego Brenner|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: This is Part 1 of a semifinal match|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S might be reached|pg||
nt|athene: and should go down, losing @SAQ @DA @HA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hello - Fred, Joe, Michael|pg||
nt|idblu: Looks like the Chineses Women are the cinderella team at the tourney :)|pg||
nt|idblu: And they have also played stupendous ..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for convention cards of players - check out:  http://tinyurl.com/Japan-Open-2007  and http://tinyurl.com/Chinese-Women-2008|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good hand for garbage stayman.|pg||
nt|idblu: pass anything :)|pg||
nt|xenya: Japan Open have a substantial lead China Women, but there are 32 boards ahead|pg||
nt|eccone: alert ne acep?|pg||
nt|eccone: hmm|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mcarroll: Morning Hans, Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: The other 2 teams are Australia and Chinese Women|pg||
nt|xenya: strong @C from E|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: we will get names as soon as operator has time to put them in |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Unfortunately Ian is trying to be with us, but "gagged" at the moment|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D suit may "disappear"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Had anyone of you opened on N?|pg||
nt|werge: Yoy have problems in 3 NT - East is somehow endplayed...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so the Hacket team came back to win from 40-0 down|pg||
nt|xenya: Hello Martin|pg||
nt|athene: but i think even with 13 imps to make up, bidding game wld be aggressive|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H will be a 3-card limit raise, i guess|pg||
nt|shevek: fit showing jump maybe?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a strong Australian team  Klinger and Delmonte are very well known|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I dont know the other 2  but surely well known also|pg||
nt|sharkey: Would anyone open the East hand 1@C?|pg||
nt|athene: east has the sort of hand that can be very aggressive facing 4-card spade support but less so facing only 3|pg||
nt|athene: weak trumps and possibility of getting forced in hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: clubs are where my points are, yes i would|pg||
nt|shevek: absolutely an opening hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but EW weren't part of the team in 2008, so we'll have to guess what they're doing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Your commentators are Geoffrey Wolfarth, Jos Jacobs, Mark Horton and Kath Nelson|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: par 11|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now thats what I call a heavyweight overcall - after a featherlight opening!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: strong club to start|pg||
nt|cindy: @h lead i think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Yokohama in Japan for the 14th NEC Cup. Quarter-finals, two segments of 16 boards. This is the first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome to first set of knockout phase of 2009 NEC|pg||
nt|b_eymen: selamlar|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not an ideal start, but shouldnt matter|pg||
nt|barbyh: normal sequence|pg||
nt|snorris: if n shows life then not|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi folks|pg||
nt|cindy: i just see 6 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi cindy |pg||
nt|cindy: hi shirley :)|pg||
nt|bg: normal contract probably off one  two tricks in three suits plus spade ace|pg||
nt|thommos: assume X is for Takeout|pg||
nt|mpny: Hackett will open 1H which will make reaching 4H routine|pg||
nt|idblu: I think S and E would like to be somewhere else at this moment in time:)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: Operator,  I have told E name is WangWenfei |pg||
nt|Walddk5: But since they started 5 mins early, they are not all here yet|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: Izmir Buyuksehir Belediyesi Beyaz takimi grubun seribasi takimi, Nafiz Zorlu, Salvador Assael, Ozgur Bakan, Mert Bilgen, Bulent Aslan, Ibrahim Mumcuoglu kadrodaki oyuncular|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: contract in Open is 5@S DBL|pg||
nt|snorris: no 3 nt now I guess|pg||
nt|sharkey: gd morning Mike|pg||
nt|mpny: good morning|pg||
nt|mpny: or late nite here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H makeable here?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators are Al, Ed, Joe and Martin'|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|werge: 3@c look surprising?|pg||
nt|idblu: re all :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sharkey: 2@S rather timid?|pg||
nt|snorris: in my system I open 2 nt|pg||
nt|snorris: give it 3..the law..|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @s|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Martin|pg||
nt|idblu: W recently won a North Ameruican championship at the recent nationals playing with Steve Katz I believe|pg||
nt|idblu: I see The Netherlands was in 1st prior to the last match...so these 2 must be the leaders or very close to the top of the standings|pg||
nt|sharkey: real late mike?|pg||
nt|mpny: yes it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF EW using same convention card as 2007 Bermuda Bowl -- we'll see some 10-13 NT openers [fav 1/2/3]|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi folks:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone|pg||
nt|caitlin: hi Ed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: according to CC west's balancing NT was supposed to be (12)13-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: evening Ed, Joe, Caitlin|pg||
nt|caitlin: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html  is homepage|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Martin!|pg||
nt|othered1: west may not play south for the 6-count|pg||
nt|caitlin: hi Joe and Al:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: and Martin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well, there's 6 count and there's the South hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know if north's 1@S is a limited opening?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SJ looks like normal play -- then either @D or @H  [probably @D]|pg||
nt|caitlin: 8 teams have qualified for quarter finals these teams 4th-5th respectively and between 4th-8 teams only 5 VP difference|pg||
nt|athene: opening 1@C with 5-5 in the blacks can certainly lead to a much smoother auction if partner has a good hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Fearless.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  1N=10-12 1/2/3 not-vul   otherwise  (14)15-17|pg||
nt|sybarra2: when operator gets a chance,  will make changes I am sure |pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s might bid the slam herehere but|pg||
nt|eccone: güneyin agresif 4@h basýna iþ açtý gibi|pg||
nt|eccone: 3@h denilse rakip 4@s zor der heralde|pg||
nt|eccone: batý demesse demezþler|pg||
nt|eccone: þimdi mecbur kaldý|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wilkinsona: strangley, south sold out to 3 spades OR|pg||
nt|othered1: So west will bid her hand out in natural order, rather than @H first|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I am looking for which Hackett this is|pg||
nt|mpny: the auction also made it likely to guess D|pg||
nt|athene: but most people these days prefer to get their major in|pg||
nt|yo_yo: for those who like to picture the players  here is a link for delmonte: http://www.worldbridge.org/TOURN/Bermuda.00/vugraph/players/profiles/0162.html|pg||
nt|shevek: at this vulnerability they're not very keen|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: That's a popular Scandinavian convention - 2 NT = 55 in minors < opening|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @h showing 5|pg||
nt|idblu: Hi Cindy, Tony|pg||
nt|idblu: change that to Ralph Katz :)|pg||
nt|irwinbo: it looks like no game makes|pg||
nt|cindy: W wont let pd off the hook|pg||
nt|mdgraham: err...|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: Diyarbakir Diski elimdeki bilgilere gore Diyarbakir 3.su olarak katilma hakki elde etmis. M. Serif Camci, Ekrem Ozcikan, Baki Demirhan, Tahir Demirhan, Zana Akay ve Besir ...|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: Ekinci'den olusuyor kadrolari|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|frankaus: the play will not be challenging|pg||
nt|snorris: 5 @c then|pg||
nt|mcarroll: hard to see what else |pg||
nt|snorris: no 3nt|pg||
nt|snorris: I presime|pg||
nt|snorris: presume|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like the D from E|pg||
nt|sharkey: ouch|pg||
nt|caitlin: does anyone know what happened with the appeal?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I don't have CC for any of the China Evertrust partnerships :( but a good bet that they're part of the Precision throng|pg||
nt|caitlin: would think so and I have yet to find cc's|pg||
nt|santyclz: Rather a surprise on trick 1.|pg||
nt|othered1: might be right to bid with the south hand, then, as Ew could have game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi all, not sure why he did not play spade jack|pg||
nt|caitlin: will cost|pg||
nt|santyclz: I can only guess he didn't read it as 4th best.  Many people would lead the 10 from that holding.|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe playing north for A109xx(x)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if North's lead conventionally from A109xx or Q109xx -- when is it wrong to play !J?|pg||
nt|othered1: Depending on what NS lead from that holding|pg||
nt|idblu: @D10 makes a nice entry to the @C's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over weak NT  --- DBL of Stayman = GOOD HAND [vs Strong NT - better to show @C or something conventional]|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: heard the screach of brakes |pg||
nt|marlowepi: S needs to bid 4S here|pg||
nt|snorris: well done|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello again!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT I mean|pg||
nt|werge: 10 of @C now,pls!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: doubtless game forcing now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: which resulted in a fair punishment|pg||
nt|thommos: lucky South didn't X for t/o|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: Morning Snorri and Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes an amazing set - 2 grand slams in a row and lots of swing boards|pg||
nt|sybarra: Paul H. I am told|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and if 4th best [ugh] then Rule of 11 would make J automatic|pg||
nt|sharkey: sensible stop NV - E may have bid game VUL due to potential payoff|pg||
nt|shevek: not sure he'll make this|pg||
nt|sharkey: u read my mind Nicoleta:)|pg||
nt|athene: @HK now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other Chinese Women were playing Precision - so until proven otherwise, let's assume EW also big @Cers|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: even though 3S is forcing, N might think that it suggests alternatives to the eventual 4S that S would bid|pg||
nt|cindy: hi :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: My bid on E is 4@s|pg||
nt|werge: But the best board in this tournament was by far 6 @d one down - and 7 @D making at the other table. And declarer in 6 @D played perfectly...|pg||
nt|werge: Yesterday|pg||
nt|marlowepi: buddy?|pg||
nt|werge: @S-lead = expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The 1@S opening and aggressive auction by NS keeps EW out of a making 4@S?|pg||
nt|roswolf: definitely bid the slam|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Jos Jacobs|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi jos|pg||
nt|josj: hi Roland and Geoffrey :)|pg||
nt|josj: good to see a probably tense final session coming up|pg||

nt|sharkey: The "Happy Tea" off to a flyinf start as 5@D likely to make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Ralf|pg||
nt|cindy: S getting nervous about being endplayed i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: thinking of unblocking to avoid it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: GF hands usually7 don;t|pg||
nt|idblu: appears to off 2@D 1@H and 1@C|pg||
nt|cindy: welcome marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: tricky lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E has a minimum for 1nt|pg||
nt|thommos: 2@S was making, but how many down is is 3@H|pg||
nt|caitlin: 5@CX will yield a nice score for N-S a half Canadian/half U.S. team|pg||
nt|caitlin: Mori is originally from Tokyo so has advantage of speaking language |pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S is easy -- NS had a profitable save available  |pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hoþgeldiniz|pg||
pc|c3|nt|snorris: dont know about 2 nt in Scandinavia but in my version it is a kind of multi, covering some strong versions|pg||
nt|sharkey: In Norway usually weak 55 hand |pg||
nt|snorris: ok|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: even 12 tricks possible..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and a good choice it seems|pg||
nt|sharkey: ok - undo|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: missed that one...Rolands got me on split shifts|pg||
nt|snorris: where south fell asleep? |pg||
nt|idblu: safe lead, gives nothing away|pg||
nt|santyclz: The other table had a normal 2/1 auction to the unenviable 2@s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but ed -- which holding can north have where it is EVER right to play small from dummy?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11 IMPs here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i wonder what 3@H meant|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: a nice auction to a sound contract then|pg||
nt|cindy: another decision|pg||
nt|cindy: to duck or not to duck   that is the question|pg||
nt|ralfwil: how many of you should double on E?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good morning from a frosty Manchester|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting hand -- 4@S looks very close for EW|pg||
nt|werge: They sacrifice against their olwn 4 @s...|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now W can make 5@c if N continues with @d|pg||

nt|vugraphzhn: 1st and 3rd position here, we will try to get scores from Sjöberg-Bergström who is second placed.....|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But why not a @s lead? a @h lead is missing a tempo|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: a couple of clubs can be ruffed for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: Yes|pg||
nt|othered1: a109xxx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: A109xx playing small, suit blocked|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes go to www.bbotv.com/vugraph to see open room|pg||
nt|caitlin: has to set up hearts but W will play spades|pg||
nt|caitlin: down one|pg||
pc|d9|nt|thommos: and 9@H switch|pg||
nt|othered1: or Q109xxx|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Kath Nelson|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Now they are all here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|snorris: awful lead|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps 4@S can be defeated by repeated @D leads though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Fred already said that :(|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N looks a reasonable contract here -- actually an easy make|pg||
nt|sybarra: tough to time all the finesses you need here|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The au pair has just opened the Krug Rosé|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good morning from Manchester|pg||

nt|snorris: more luck|pg||

nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Panja|pg||
nt|mcarroll: hi|pg||
nt|snorris: south thinking about the J of @hs?|pg||
nt|snorris: might be right against another layout|pg||
nt|panja: a small @H and then @S shift by North would lead to some interesting situation|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Agree with a small @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Q109xx possible, but pass from south holding @SA very unlikely -- so maybe playing for stiff or doubleton @SQ is right|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@S also down one on @D lead but likely get club lead|pg||
nt|athene: so it wld be a strange complicated sort of scissors coup|pg||

nt|marlowepi: slam is a reasonable gamble. 5S is the safe bid of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: personally i think the game would be greatly improved if bidding and making 5M paid more than 4M with an overtrick|pg||
nt|snorris: very strange, n opened 1 @d!!|pg||

nt|werge: One more 7 NT...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well Im not sure about that..... but we hoped for more action|pg||
nt|snorris: another weakness is the inability of not being able to inviting slam in minor|pg||
nt|idblu: a push as suggested|pg||
nt|thommos: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me a D from W is for penalty and 2nt is forcing for one round|pg||

nt|ralfwil: only 1@s on a 7-card suit?|pg||
nt|snorris: so how many? 3 @h ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: its forcing|pg||

nt|mpny: no, 2D would almost certainly not be forcing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 3nt|pg||

nt|bg: 4 spades tough with heart lead 3nt also tough with heart lead|pg||
nt|cindy: @h lead unlikely vs 4@s though|pg||
nt|bg: declarer has to duck first round rule of 7 with six cards subtract from 7 and get one therefore duck first round|pg||
nt|cindy: yes   should find it|pg||
nt|sybarra: is it rule of 7 or 11?|pg||
nt|bg: can get 3 spades 3 dia two clubs and one heart|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..judges well to pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not much for E to do with such limited stoppage in ajors and no diamond honor|pg||

nt|sharkey: gd morning Ralf|pg||
nt|werge: Morning|pg||
nt|sharkey: and Hans|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right -- the power of limited opening 1@H, saves East from a painful guess|pg||

pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: 3nt looks very conservative|pg||
nt|othered1: fMust b e 13-15 and north knows there's no long suit fit.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ah, possibly|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no nead to sac |pg||
nt|snorris: 3 sp is too little|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a 7-card suit after partners opening and also a support?|pg||
nt|snorris: sounds like just figthing for a partscore|pg||
nt|werge: The @C Q shoyld lead to the right bid = 4 @S|pg||
nt|mpny: yes, 3D rather than 3H would be F, but he got to the right strain|pg||
nt|santyclz: Overall in the matches I've seen the players have been remarkably conservative for juniors.|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't love opening the north hand with 1N, but it's worked out fine.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This should be flat - same contract next door|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the game is missed|pg||
nt|josj: it might have been time for a polite raise by S with 2 aces|pg||
nt|roswolf: i fancy in the other room game will be bid|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Maybe North should have doubled to show a good overcall, although in my book he had already promised a decent hand with 1@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but has North show 15 with a 6 card suit,  i dont think so|pg||
nt|josj: wanna bet Geoffrey?:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|werge: RD...!!!|pg||
nt|cindy: i agree|pg||
nt|sharkey: Normal 3 NT here - off a couple|pg||
nt|athene: it looks natural to begin diamonds with small to the @DJ, which won't work|pg||
nt|athene: oh - declarer doesn't really have time to play on diamonds anyway|pg||
nt|athene: but there's no possible way to get three spade tricks|pg||
nt|idblu: they aren't playing the game that got them here|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sybarra: even now |pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|sharkey: E probably doesnt want to open 2@S with 2 aces thus 1@S second choice?|pg||
nt|snorris: I HAVE to bid something in south|pg||
nt|snorris: it might be my last chanse to bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes but, not 1@s for me |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I double on such a hand|pg||
nt|thommos: pass from west would be a min hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Any regular pair would have their own agreements on what sets up a force and what doesn't - not all pairs play the same  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: this looks a hairy contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the important thing is to be on the same wavelength - and South was on long wave there while North was on medium|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - lol - perhaps 3@D followed by 3@S and 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: !a and a @c continuation will break the contract|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sA|pg||
nt|sharkey: Problems here with trumps 4-2 I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: E will refuse 1st @S perhaps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is it Paul Hackett  here or one of his twins?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 8 tricks if Declarer starts with low @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS using standard honor leads;  3rd even/lo odd spot leads -- upside-down count & attitude signals |pg||
nt|idblu: the China Women have been VERY impressive....in all facets of the game.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the ladies bid everything|pg||
nt|eccone: 1@s yapar heralde|pg||
nt|akgun: +1 gibi duruyor|pg||

pc|d8|nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks with a @s finess|pg||
nt|roswolf: 9 tricks sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: Fallenius: small barp, Fredin: So thats what you think? He probably likes the dummy......|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @s10 was essential|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure you try the @S too early,  could go down |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but N can have a 6-card suit in @h, so...|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx all lots of suggestions,    |pg||
nt|sybarra: and all realistic,  at the table I would be worried (I think) about taking spade finesse too early |pg||
nt|snorris: probably|pg||
nt|snorris: and if they play strong @c system its almost ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: NV not to unreasonable I think|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..turns out ok, as this can make..|pg||
nt|snorris: of course you will win 7 but...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North's opening strenthens our guess that they're playing precision [but even that hand seems too weak for 1N]|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps unless you know!|pg||
nt|josj: :) sure bets are the best|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: with 3 cards in both unbid suits and opps vul, 2D was a dubious choice|pg||
nt|athene: even if you pick @SAx that only gives you two spades|pg||
nt|mcarroll: very delicate|pg||
nt|xenya: might require a very careful play by declarer |pg||
nt|mcarroll: can make but not easy|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer's prime objective is to establish clubs keeping N off lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mariner1: EW did have a save here if they found it|pg||
nt|werge: The problem is, that if you bid all henads, where hou "must" bid . you loose|pg||
nt|snorris: no win|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hard to disagree with success, and I hate the final double |pg||
nt|othered1: 2@S likely denying @H (if they're playing standardish 2-way Stayman)|pg||
nt|snorris: getting there..|pg||
nt|snorris: maybe|pg||
nt|mpny: paul|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and perhaps more after @c a heart continuation|pg||
nt|yo_yo: for those who dont know  Paul (the father)  has twin sons, both champions|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i prefer to save when their game makes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they do play strong club, not sure of details, they were on vugraph before|pg||
nt|caitlin: I prefer the 1NT than East opening 1@H at other table which did work but surprising no spade balance|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ty operator |pg||
pc|h4|nt|cindy: doesntlook like 3N or 5D so no problem |pg||
nt|athene: perhaps lead a spade from dummy and hope south jumps in with @SAxx|pg||
nt|athene: to return a club|pg||
nt|shevek: same contract, same lead in OR|pg||

nt|ralfwil: no thougtts about a grand?|pg||
nt|werge: Is this play right: @d to the Ace - and let the 9 run...?|pg||
nt|sharkey: much easier to bid seeing all hands :)|pg||
nt|mpny: they will pick up another 3 IMPs here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we all bid 1NT with that east hand over the overcall?|pg||

pc|s6|nt|wilkinsona: declarer miss timed things in OR it seems..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me 5nt in this sequence is a grand trial|pg||
nt|idblu: blocking|pg||
nt|athene: whatever she chooses to discard will work out ok|pg||

nt|josj: opps can't beat it as they have no running suits threatening|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so terrific start for Hayate, making 7NT NS board 1, 6NT EW board 2|pg||
nt|irwinbo: that's what i think|pg||
nt|idblu: any other bid would be fed going|pg||
nt|cindy: i think it depends on your agreement|pg||
nt|marlowepi: makes best sense to play it that way, as other bids are available to show strength|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed - maybe a mild upset to get to finals, but were Seeded in the Top 4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: that is why he is playing and I am in the rafters |pg||
nt|yo_yo: I cant think of a game here even seeing all hands|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now 11|pg||
nt|xenya: another good idea -- set up a spade trick while discarding losers from hand|pg||
nt|b_eymen: -1|pg||
pc|d6|nt|idblu: forward|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Ed |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Caitlin!|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Shirley!|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes 6 IMP to Juice|pg||
nt|othered1: juice will get 5 back here, sooner or later.|pg||
nt|caitlin: 5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|frankaus: this could make if Fushida ellect to finess @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - do you agree with Paul's Dbl?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i sympathize with it |pg||
nt|mpny: no, I do not, but it is not an easy hand|pg||
nt|idblu: from the get-go?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in fact -- the top 4 seeds ALL advanced to the semi-finals|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes a real opportunityt here as they stopped in 3@H in OR|pg||

nt|marlowepi: though not as ducious as the double|pg||
nt|snorris: misguessed @ds maybe|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud be|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: played to ruff clubs in hand and lost control it seems..|pg||
nt|snorris: this was not a pleasing sight this king of @s for north|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But no use of it|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes only 3 spades othe table too...cant see why north doesnt try for the max here|pg||
nt|idblu: I want the handicapper betting for me :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: I have played many worse games|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @s bid might win or might push oponents to a sac|pg||
nt|fabsayc: NEX|pg||
nt|josj: it also has the virtue of making life more difficult for the opps, as was proved here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sharkey: Double finesse in @D odds on|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no they didnt bid it, good job we didnt bet :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: 3 rounds of clubs is the defense|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the bad break hurts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perfect defence so far|pg||
nt|ahollan1: key info fred: if i'm betting -- ignore handicapper -- just bet opposite of what i do|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ve bizler naklen izliyoruz|pg||

nt|snorris: well done|pg||
nt|bg: another 13 for Japan|pg||

nt|b_eymen: pik býrakýlýnca herþey cakýlsa|pg||

pc|sA|nt|snorris: might be difficult to find out about the @d queen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thoughtful @HA cash before going back to @D -- encourages partner to play 13th @D, but just doesn't matter here |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|snorris: 10 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: So the Chinese Women strike back|pg||

pc|hK|nt|thommos: they can make their trumps separately|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the ladies crowded the auction|pg||
nt|sharkey: perhaps the downside looms larger than the upside vie Vul vs NV on this hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a good case for having four spades, otherwise partner may find it difficult to judge, particularly if the oppo bid 4@H|pg||

nt|snorris: now we will know if n-s play strong @c|pg||
nt|werge: Listen - he has an Ace, a trump trick (aganins GOOD bidders - and partner has promised an opening bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 6NT other room..|pg||
nt|snorris: 3-3 @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I ask fro the @dQ by bidding 6@c. The suit below the trumph|pg||
nt|snorris: me too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well 2 spades is available for forward move|pg||
nt|cindy: i wouldnt assume it was blocking with a pickup partner|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2NT not weak either, nor 3C|pg||
nt|idblu: new suit would show extras and interest|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: sry 3D 3make|pg||
nt|thommos: at  this speed we will be finshed in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of like doing vugraph from Brazil |pg||
nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then the alternative is 3N, and nay 5-3 spade fit goes out the window |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if EW playing 10-13 NT at this vul, then East knew partner did NOT hold @SQ|pg||
nt|caitlin: Joey is playing:)|pg||
nt|shevek: I hear that the real score is 47-29|pg||

nt|athene: some people might pass that south hand|pg||
nt|shevek: following an appeal|pg||

nt|mariner1: can EW make a Moysian 4@S here?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E does not rise on first heart lead from dummy, 3NT makes|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|othered1: 13-15 NT range has some funny results, when it's 15.|pg||

nt|idblu: tell 'em to slow down... we get paid by the hour :)|pg||

nt|athene: you have an open-ended straight flush draw, so it's a clear opener for me|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: In OR west failed to raise hearts with 5 it seems...|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15-17 NT at these colors|pg||
nt|caitlin: could this be a DONT type bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  @C + Major  or   DONT  @C + another|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: Buna benzer eller ozellikle elemelerin ilk turlarinda problem yaratabilir, oyuncularin daha tam olarak isinmadigini dusunuyorum:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ralfwil: my bid too on E|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|panja: 1@H for Spade suit...|pg||
nt|cindy: who likes 3@h here ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I like this 3@h!|pg||
nt|snorris: auto...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although South may have overcalled 1@S if he had five and some values |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if South gets a chance to bid 2@H -- we'll know more about 2@C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c with a @h lead|pg||
nt|shevek: values in the short suits not good|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C strong, double is clubs?|pg||
nt|idblu: think they'll play @H's here?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kuzeyin 3@c deklaresi karo tututþu ve davet eli gösteriyor muhtemelen|pg||
nt|MolvaM: genellikle 5li karo ve 10-12 puan|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok 9-11 miþ|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: hmm...|pg||
nt|snorris: undo|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S is a better spot than 3Nt, it seems, but it might not be easy to get there..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But you will only earn 100 if it is -1 and loose 170 if made?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 4@h is laydown|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can we put superchargers on EW please|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D  means "System On" over DBL or 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|santyclz: If DONT it improves e's hand.|pg||
nt|caitlin: for any conventions one may not be familiar with the new home for bridge guys is http://www.bridgeguys.com/|pg||
nt|caitlin: mark it off-- a reasonably good site|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah i am blind 3 losers in 5@D|pg||
nt|josj: unluckily yes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: i can't imagine passing the N hand, in third chair at these colors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but 3D will probably be the contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be the contract |pg||
nt|marlowepi: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: except N will fear S has clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard sometimes plays a 4/3 |pg||
nt|snorris: e-w can 3 @h|pg||
nt|sharkey: Don't understand why W would fail to raise to 3@H in OR when pd bid VUL|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s maybe 4 @c|pg||
nt|bg: 3h ok if partnership understanding that it can be that good|pg||
nt|sybarra: would you bid 4 first time?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East will take some stopping now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H is the best practical bid on W hand even if playing 5-card majors|pg||
nt|idblu: once W can't cue @S, they should stop in 5@C or 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lack of any spade cuebid ought to stop everybody|pg||
nt|cindy: as soon as she finds out they have no @s control the brakes will be put on|pg||
nt|idblu: 5@D|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Never predict a flat board they will always find a way to outwit the commentator!!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me - no opening on S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tournament homepage is http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html  --  i believe the finals are 4 sets of 16 boards|pg||
nt|xenya: i think 2nd trump was a mistake but no doubt she was playing for some other distribution|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: eymen 4sp oynanicak degil mi|pg||
nt|eccone: acýnca otomatik|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: all the same with 32 hcp and 3 tens its worth a look perhaps|pg||
nt|cindy: no  would never bid 4|pg||
nt|snorris: how do you like this nt Hans?|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 2@d bekleme|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzhn: Efraimsson: You promise 3 trick?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: P - P - 1H - 1NT -3H and now EW do not have an easy time|pg||
nt|barbyh: d1 with a d lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes N could have bid 1@H or more to take advantage of the NV vs VUL 3rd seat|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: some saying 2@H and some 3@H with N here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: back again..|pg||
nt|cindy: i just dont like the fact 3@h takes up so much room|pg||
nt|bg:   clubs great contract|pg||
nt|bg: 6|pg||
nt|cindy: not fond of preempting our side|pg||
nt|snorris: now can s double?|pg||
nt|cindy: sorry marshall|pg||
nt|cindy: im slow typist|pg||
nt|werge: South will not ask for aces in this board....|pg||
nt|sharkey: seems so|pg||
nt|shevek: I believe you Will|pg||
nt|idblu: 3@H here would sound like a cue bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession time --- playing Precision, i would open 1@H in 1st seat|pg||
nt|roswolf: HARD TO RESIST BIDDING GAME|pg||
nt|MolvaM: makul 1 kontrat|pg||
mb|p|nt|mpny: EW can make 3 of either round suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like a tad high|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@S sure looks like super accept|pg||
nt|MolvaM: turnuvanýn baþlarýnda genellikle makul ve mantýklý kontratlar oynanýr|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ama özellikle akþam yemeði sonrasý kontratlar biraz daha yaratýcý olmaya baþlar|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: eighth time's the charm! welcome|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Cindy|pg||
nt|frankaus: many here will open 2@H or equivalent with N hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: happy ending|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surely West had a 3 heart bid here..|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S now..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: take the money by a D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that's cuz u worry about typosezb|pg||
nt|cindy: yes :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm with you Ralf|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Me too|pg||
nt|werge: In their system it is probably a reasonable minimum opening|pg||
nt|athene: south, having passed, can make aggressive forward-going moves|pg||
nt|athene: she can't have any more than this|pg||
nt|shevek: Mullamphy opened 1@c with south's|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's not that great a slam |pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice suit, easy rebids and most important -- strength limited by failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: As would I.  But I'd pass here.|pg||
nt|idblu: N will never P here|pg||
nt|santyclz: No, I would have passed with s.|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S may just run the fiamonds and lead a club,hoping to read position|pg||
nt|snorris: the law..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..or there|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - The "LAW" shud compel W to fight to at least 3@H I think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also from the beginning. 5-card support!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4hearts looks ok on a cross ruff play|pg||
nt|othered1: In contemporary bidding 2@H on this auction is pretty much not invitational|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely a push|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: some saying 8H too|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @s showing a better hand than weak shift jump|pg||
nt|panja: play should be interesting....|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Nobuyuki Hayashi, NPC of the Japan Open team on many occasions|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I dislike it intensely|pg||
nt|werge: Better than any other opening with that hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lucky layout for NS given  that they will get a clib lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: 3NT by Hackett|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Although it seems to have worked|pg||
nt|sharkey: % no - but makes :)|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D is aggressive facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 2@d nin 0-8 oldugu yazmakta konvansiyon kartinda|pg||
pc|c6|nt|npcjpn: Hi, everyone.|pg||
nt|bg: 6 spades goes for 1100 better than 6 cubs|pg||
nt|cindy: was 4N supposed to be keycard there or just general slam try ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting if it was |pg||
nt|npcjpn: I am not sure, but some kind of slam try with direct 5@c shows just competing.|pg||
nt|cindy: well keycard is sorta futile with that void|pg||
nt|cindy: hi nobuyuki :)|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @c - pass 1 @H - pass - ???|pg||
nt|snorris: not the killing lead...|pg||
nt|snorris: I agree Hans|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I have seen so many nt-openings with a singleton major, and I don´t like it|pg||
nt|irwinbo: wd|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure well done|pg||
nt|bg: declarer may get nevous here but cannot go wrong|pg||
nt|bg: nervous|pg||
nt|xenya: only a @S lead beats slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now he must support @c|pg||
pc|c2|nt|barbyh: what is 2nt here can possibly be a raise|pg||
nt|snorris: agree|pg||
nt|cindy: so if general try what should E's bid be ?|pg||
nt|cindy: 5@s i think|pg||
nt|npcjpn: I think so too.|pg||
nt|werge: North had the double! - diamonds behind |pg||
nt|snorris: not much defence in s s hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If you cannot open 1@C it is difficult, but I would open 1@D in that case|pg||
nt|werge: Neither do I, but I was asked about THIS hand |pg||
nt|idblu: he will be nervous after the lead...but all's well that end's well|pg||
nt|thommos: yes, but once Spade Finese works it will be very quick|pg||
nt|thommos: duck QC |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i never remember name of convention where 2m = m + Major :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: notice how DONT effectively preempted NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not a fan of superaccept with 3 card support --- especially when North has said things not breaking well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has 4 al|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is for hearts--four card support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opps wrong glasses|pg||
nt|caitlin: lol:))|pg||
nt|santyclz: The ones full of scotch?|pg||
nt|athene: if you play sensible control-bids, 4@D denies a club control so 4@H confirms one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough call for South on 2nd bid -- RDBL and 2@H both reasonable|pg||
nt|idblu: very nice...catered to the 3@H not being natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done Ino!|pg||
nt|idblu: impressive|pg||
nt|vulkan: 1KC ve koz Dam dýþarda, 6 demezler|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mariner1: Marlow do they have a card for that :)|pg||
nt|cindy: how about 1H|pg||
nt|mariner1: Marshall|pg||
nt|panja: if declarer removes trumps early, and then loses @D finesse....he would go down..so he might think of getting Clubs in|pg||
nt|snorris: thats another way to cope yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: Al I had to look twice...thought it was my glasses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S as superaccept may mean they're using the old Walsh Relays  ---  where 2@D is @H OR slam going minor 1-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still has to make it --- @C lead will help a lot|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess that's why I'm watching, not playing.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Efraimsson will soon realise that this was a phantom, but I would have done the same I must confess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E sequence showed a good hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 1@H looked more normal to me,,,,,,,, some kibbers very aggressive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no but it is on a par with 2H or 3H|pg||
nt|barbyh: then he has to make 2 pitches|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yesd he has an Ace - in partner's suit,  Probably a trump trick - and we have seen some really unconvincing opening bids|pg||
nt|panja: difficult for West too..he does not have Club guard..so removing trumps isnt attractive..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think Hackett should have doubled with his @dKJx|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: difficult lead for west though|pg||
nt|sybarra: and @D come crashing down, bridge is easy game |pg||
nt|thommos: a partscore win to N/S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well it's natural for Hanlon to try for game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - almost mirrored shapes, which never play too well|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW would probably not have entered into the bidding on this hand.  3@S by S is normal in many partnerships I believe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no comprende scotch ---  i'm into fermented grapejuice like Zin|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Best line is to win in hand and test clubs|pg||
nt|vulkan: kör pasý geçiyo fakat karo kupuna batýyor|pg||
pc|h3|nt|panja: nothing else seems promising|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 times @h to lock him on the table|pg||
nt|snorris: and hope for 2-2 in minors in n|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as the cards lie win on hand an play a @c to the Q|pg||
nt|panja: my sense is...this will now go @CA, @C ruff, another trumps, and a Club...let us see...declarer, not knowing @D finesse is in...will have to think hard about his options|pg||
nt|cindy: im thinking they werent on same page but it worked out great|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To see if you can afford the safety play in hearts later (small to the ace)|pg||
nt|werge: If they land this slam, it has been quite a start|pg||
nt|athene: but south might now fear that 5@S is askin for good trumps (which she hasn't got) rather than a club control (which she has)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: Or perhaps they have seen pd's overcalls VUL before....|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he heard me!|pg||
nt|idblu: the hesitation indicates no @s K|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this opens up for a @s lead|pg||
nt|idblu: u and me both Joe|pg||
nt|b_eymen: @d sorunsuz|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 6karo sorunsuzdu|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|cindy: i mean   dont ya want a heart lead ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: always a problem! isn´t it?|pg||
nt|sharkey: S pushed OR as well|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Another delicate contract - the 4-1 trump break makes it difficult|pg||
nt|xenya: feels it can be made but, again, a delicate handling is needed here |pg||
nt|b_eymen: artifisyel oynayanlarýn rahatlýkla diyebilecegi bir 6@d|pg||
nt|vulkan: evet 6@d sorunsuz, fakat bu saatten sonra denmez|pg||
nt|b_eymen: diger masada nasýl oynuyolar övünç|pg||
nt|eccone: köre batardý heralde|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: 4@H looks pushy to me, but it did fine partner with a near-perfect 11 count|pg||
nt|snorris: agree|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I suppose Hackett and Hanlon are off to the gold coast congress in Australia|pg||
nt|othered1: Interesting plays at tricks 1 & 2.  This hand has gotten lots less complex|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably doesn't matter -- but can it hurt to play @C9?|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 2@c kuvvetli oynaniyor diger masada da|pg||
nt|akgun: cakip as karoyu cikarirsa yapardi sanirim|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: hala cok net degil bence|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: :)|pg||
nt|eccone: suan net |pg||
nt|akgun: 2. elde karo oynamazsa batabilirdi sanirim|pg||
nt|eccone: A @c atagýna batarý kalmadýda|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: right. that is why he has to read the position|pg||
nt|bg: should play heart now if he draws trump could get in trouble|pg||
nt|cindy: yes   he has all the club spots |pg||
nt|npcjpn: I will tell the operater to catch up the meaning of alerted bid later.|pg||
nt|cindy: ty|pg||
nt|npcjpn: so far we have no clue of 3@h and 5@d.|pg||
nt|cindy: dare we suggest next ?|pg||
nt|idblu: @S can't be wrong|pg||
nt|caitlin: they hear you Roland|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wilkinsona: on the other hand a psychic cue from East may have stood a chance|pg||
nt|idblu: Migr saves time :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok well done|pg||
nt|shevek: problem with opening south's hand is that you'll pull the breaks (like south did in the OR)...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would you say that if K@D was with East?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: T think W should have bid 3@h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The same should happen here|pg||
nt|athene: well - as has been remarked, it's not that great a slam|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or the spades didnt behave?|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the double, showing clubs, makes it slightly better than 50% that the @DK is right|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 2@c 3@d diyebilirdi güney ama pek begenmedi elini galiba|pg||
nt|vulkan: zorlu 2 kör +1 yapýyor, 1 imp izmire|pg||
nt|fahir: herkese Ýzmir'den merhabalar, umarým keyifli bir 4lü olur ve katýlamayanlarda rahatça izleyip burayý yaþayabilirler|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: heart back |pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt S will be alone in this contract|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Will the one suit squeeze work here?|pg||
nt|xenya: sure -- both 4@S and 5@C look obvious|pg||
nt|snorris: now all is well|pg||
nt|bg: 5dia probably 3 key cards in clubs|pg||
nt|werge: @D now...|pg||
nt|idblu: as well as the @D switch :)|pg||
nt|mpny: this is a very normal result|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: guneyin elindeki QJXXXX karo ile agresif tutum alinmasi gerekiyor bu slemi bulmak icin|pg||
nt|b_eymen: veya sistem geregi|pg||
pc|s3|nt|snorris: the best yes|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I think thats asking a bit|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@h IN THE or|pg||
nt|ahollan1: partner just needs stiff @HJ for @D tap to work -- but no luck today|pg||
nt|othered1: I was away and missed the semifinals, but every time I've seen them, the China Women team has just sat there and taken their tricks, occasionally with aggressive initial actions.  ...|pg||
nt|othered1: I'll be interested in seeing if they can keep this style up.|pg||
nt|idblu: why change when it works|pg||
nt|ahollan1: quoting Barry Rigal "strongest national team"|pg||
nt|idblu: as long as they don't "tilt"|pg||
nt|idblu: and I don't see them doing that|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mariner1: and you know E is very likely to have an opening bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like he is trying to read the position now|pg||
nt|thommos: agreed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and perhaps also E could have bid 3@d instead of 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Strong players indeed|pg||
nt|athene: but against that there are the chances of club ruff, or the @SQ scoring|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wilkinsona: 11 tricks, NP|pg||
nt|arigun: sabah maclarida ozellikle afyonun gec patlamasindan dolayi bayagi eglenceli gecer |pg||
nt|MolvaM: özyuva takýmý kocaeli'den|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jaap Frijling|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wilkinsona: for EW not to fight seems strange (though I may go -200 in 4Hx, I admit)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and stop off conveniently for this congress|pg||
nt|sharkey: S trying to create an endplay - but in vain on the actual layout|pg||
nt|sharkey: also need @S to break|pg||
nt|sharkey: but - no guts - no glory :)|pg||
nt|athene: i would say slam probably comes out at about 50%, so the expectation from bidding or not bidding it is about the same in the long run|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while we wait -- I just checked NS CC -- they do use 2@H opening as weak @H + minor -- but require 55|pg||
nt|jaapfr: gm all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Roland all specs|pg||
nt|xenya: i think the natural line of taking a double finesse in trumps is doomed|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi vlad|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi martin|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|roswolf: now west must hang on to his diamonds|pg||
nt|bg: next|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: which major to finesse....cant go wrong|pg||
nt|panja: still..what if @S were 4-1?|pg||
nt|snorris: not sure if this is the best play , like yours betterPanja|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nice life|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cindy: that sounds right|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Should south hop with @hA?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: mersin bþb takýmýnýn hangi ilden olduðunu ise daha sonra açýklayacaðýz. :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ralfwil: Not now, burt if Fredin had played @hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he has nothing elsed to hang onto|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PO Sundelin says he has treatment where 2@D can also be a signoff in @S|pg||
nt|athene: but bidding it is more exciting :) and is certainly consistent with these players' style|pg||
nt|sharkey: can only admire the Chinese ladies|pg||
nt|athene: if you are playing against Chinese ladies and you score +680, you can just write down -13 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: S opened OR - didn't come out|pg||
nt|shevek: this is not vul, but still....|pg||
nt|idblu: I don't think S can handle this|pg||
nt|santyclz: Going to have to take the @c finesse.|pg||
nt|idblu: unless hook @C|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense slipped after a good opening lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: So it seems |pg||
pc|dK|nt|frankaus: looks like 12 imps to EW here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: years ago I went off in a grand slam - I had a singleton, and could count 13 tricks if partner could take a ruff in my hand. However, he held singleton ace and there were only 12 ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: tricks |pg||
nt|vulkan: 2H tam oldu|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|cindy: sorry   i came in the middle of the hand|pg||
nt|snorris: nowadays a 3@h bid is difficult to punish anyway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d from the table!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: use @S to pull trump|pg||
nt|idblu: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: right|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sharkey: but hard to Dbl 3@H when you have 10 trumps - so risk minimal|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good play of heart 10|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sorry 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mirror shapes|pg||
nt|vulkan: im alýþveriþi yok|pg||

nt|marlowepi: that is one beefy NT|pg||
nt|cindy: yes meaty|pg||
nt|idblu: 17 prime + 10's galore|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i'd be tempted to open a minor and rebid 2NT. then i would succumb to temptation|pg||
nt|ralfwil: black and no sugar Hans?|pg||
nt|thommos: me too|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6 on for EW but NS will cloud the auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump underlead might have beat it|pg||

nt|sybarra: hello Martin,  welcome|pg||
nt|othered1: Is 7 good enough on, say, @H lead?  |pg||
nt|caitlin: going to slam in other room|pg||
nt|caitlin: friendly clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely not 1NT on that hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neg dbl then @H or some immediate @H raise|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@S-2@H looks normal, nowadays (nobody doubles with north)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: in fact the most reasonable line - but unfortunately it didn't work|pg||

nt|ralfwil: @hJ on S had solved a lot of problems for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NV 1NT would appeal. red is another story. tough call for N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With a singleton? this time minor!|pg||
nt|werge: Here North has no re-bid problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you're on form Carl|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am with you on that guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: both wrong|pg||
nt|sharkey: Sry - S didnt follow up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no - surprising|pg||
nt|xenya: with a less revealing auction, board 3 might produce a swing for the Dutch|pg||
nt|athene: really 1@S?|pg||
nt|athene: the rationale is, you are stuck after 1@H - 1NT|pg||

mb|d|nt|Walddk2: without the @D10 the defence could still have prevailed|pg||

nt|cindy: cant imagine trying to get to game with S hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: N in 3@H here in Open|pg||

nt|snorris: singelton and all..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3rd in hand... anything goes|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..but turns up with 13 imps in|pg||
nt|cindy: too good for 1N imo|pg||
nt|cindy: probably work out well though since @h10 looks like the lead|pg||
nt|bg: flat 7 should bring pass unless NS starting already to push abit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i have great respect for Hanlon, he must have some cunning scheme|pg||
nt|werge: agree|pg||
nt|athene: for example, 1@H - 1NT; 2@D - 2@H|pg||
nt|idblu: lets try again Al :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my ?  referred to East's bid|pg||
nt|santyclz: I x with n.  That's because my pd declares better than I do.|pg||
nt|idblu: so did I....he wasn't ;istening|pg||
nt|josj: except if there are 2 of them|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pairs or teams?|pg||
nt|akgun: sanirim 1h i gormedi guney|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: after a look at the S hand, I's open 1D as N|pg||
nt|mpny: i do not think 5 would keep EW out of slam anyway|pg||
nt|josj: teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does anyone have a link to some photos?   Nice to see what they look like|pg||
nt|yo_yo: are there any hunks for example :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: same auction to 3@H in both rooms|pg||
nt|cindy: dont want to discourage them from maybe bidding spades|pg||
nt|frankaus: the red game is tempting|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1NT seems straightforward now by S|pg||
nt|sharkey: E not done yet...|pg||
nt|snorris: this is getting exiting|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a clear P on S|pg||
nt|snorris: will w pass?|pg||
nt|snorris: might loose it rigth away if 3 times @h after a loosing @c finesse|pg||
nt|cindy: oops  now what|pg||
nt|bg: sproty balance|pg||
nt|bg: sporty|pg||
nt|snorris: a good contract|pg||
nt|snorris: presuming @d is 3-2|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this auction may get there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like this bidding. With this strong hand 1@d must be the right bid. How can he now show 45 in @h/@d?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bidding 5@C makes it awkward for EW to use Blackwood|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes 7 is quite good, but seems unbiddable|pg||
nt|caitlin: they off to the races now|pg||
nt|othered1: And isn't bidding 7 saying that they are almost certain to be in small slam in the other room?|pg||
nt|bg: good sequence 2nt asks for feature probably|pg||
nt|caitlin: no way they know about 5@CX swing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But they stopped in 3NT|pg||

nt|caitlin: won't envision Joey underleading Ace|pg||
nt|caitlin: will they risk it?|pg||
nt|caitlin: :) we are always very proud to say Bruce is Canadian:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is another potential slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If I not will stand up for my opening I should have passed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree Ralf|pg||
nt|athene: now you are a bit good to pass and a bit weak for 2NT|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Dream on|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: will S stop here?|pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lets hope you open diamonds as you may be passed out|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we dont use BW with a void Mike now :)|pg||
nt|othered1: How do you find you 8-card @S fits on part score hands?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 1nt must be 14-16 or e would have invited.|pg||
nt|xenya: @S lead looks best|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: by leading a heart |pg||
nt|ralfwil: And N did!|pg||
nt|snorris: brave north|pg||
nt|sharkey: will he make it?|pg||
nt|snorris: is sveating I suppose a bit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: they didn´use any methods. Stright forward|pg||
nt|caitlin: keep playing another 25 years Al it will happen:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jim Tritt|pg||
nt|wygbe1: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: cutting the communication|pg||
nt|sybarra: flopping in to 3nt |pg||
nt|roswolf: cutting communications|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: 5Cl -1 not doubled at Sjöberg-Bergström table, they are N/S|pg||
nt|mariner1: our S a little more aggressive|pg||
nt|cindy: might make with @d lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NonVul i would pass with S hand. Vul S is worried about N having e.g. AKxxxx and J of diamonds & stiff spade|pg||
nt|sharkey: not too many entries in N....|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and will probably smile when seeing the table|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep...sneaks home I think|pg||
nt|panja: y, this was based on 32 trumps AND @CK onside|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes if @s10 doesn´t drop|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure i like 3@H|pg||
nt|snorris: after this "reverse" in north they will bid it...I think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: even if they play strong @c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may well, south may think partner has a singleton spade for example|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only after 1nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ms West made a pragmatic bid - crude but effective this time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: take the finesse for free|pg||
nt|caitlin: or is it: I have to take this finesse|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hey Bruce Gowdy:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: and 3@C max with King|pg||
nt|bg: Hi Caitlin/Martin/Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Bruce!|pg||
nt|bg: nice to see our  guys in the fight|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Even a Grand if guesses the @C|pg||
nt|werge: 4 NT = sign off?|pg||
nt|werge: For the grand, he must finess twice in @c...|pg||
nt|geller: Hi all, Bob Geller from Japan|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hi Bob|pg||
nt|geller: I predict Chen will bid 6nt now.  he waas just fishing for 7|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True Hans, |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Bob|pg||
nt|xenya: actually board 3 turned out to be another huge gain for Japan, when the Dutch in OR landed in 3N -- no chance on a @H lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In 7nt he probably will go down as the percentage is for finessing over E|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi jim|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kendisi ABD takýmýna karþý oynanan sürkontrlu board ile büyük bir þöhret yapmýþtýr :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ralfwil: best lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html|pg||
nt|werge: Close to slam here... - without a @h-lead!|pg||
nt|panja: in the meantime, NS seem to have missed a game on B20|pg||
nt|othered1: Not my style|pg||
nt|snorris: 11 tricks easy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that's a lot of cloud to line|pg||
nt|thommos: needed to lead a @H to beat it - I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. I like 6@H|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes at other table Joey Silver from Montreal and John Carruthers from Toronto|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry I don't know the China Women's team but if anyone does, tell us please|pg||
nt|b_eymen: ahaha|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this is website I have|pg||
nt|sharkey: E may have to duck @H lead from N|pg||
nt|snorris: the only problem is north might move 6 @d to 6 nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is usually my partners who pass out|pg||
nt|cindy: have you been drinking marshall ?|pg||
nt|idblu: thats a live possibility|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since about the age of 18, but not tonight|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this can go off it seems|pg||
nt|idblu: about 1@D being passed|pg||
nt|idblu: it prob shld go down|pg||
nt|irwinbo: a spade may beat it|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: if the defence set up a spade before the club is knocked out|pg||
nt|idblu: need the @S return tho|pg||
nt|bg: 4s 3nt both ok just need double hook inspades|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all   |pg||
nt|fabsayc: something like that|pg||
nt|werge: will he make 6 @c?|pg||
nt|geller: Furuta may pass but will probably bid 6nt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The Dutch team have to tighten up the leak|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Fred -- as a Canadian -- home of Kokish -- DBL would be BLASHPHEMY|pg||
nt|idblu: I think E hand evaluates to 11+ with the doubleton @S and @C honors well placed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Jim|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: guney 1@Hyi gordu mu kenan sence?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: looks like best lead|pg||
nt|snorris: thats auto...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would try to buy for 2|pg||
nt|caitlin: ooppps|pg||
nt|athene: same after 1@H - 1@S; 2@D - 2@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: wud bid 2@H with E hand - too weak for 2 bids I think?|pg||
nt|shevek: this might make but I have my doubts....|pg||
nt|athene: i think it might be pushing things a bit far to open 1nt with it but it's not outrageous|pg||
nt|chessmaste: China on Nelson!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: Lead out of turn is accepted|pg||
nt|josj: not a good omen, Mark :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: N leads @sk|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhn: Fallenius asked Morath if he showed count or attitude|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but it is important to play @s  from the hand before any other suit|pg||
nt|snorris: how can they not bid game here?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mercifully undoubled|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can cash a few hearts first if they want|pg||
nt|werge: North  should have bid 4 @C - not East...|pg||
nt|sybarra: its just sort of pesky that @S's 3/1 but does not matter here at the end of the day |pg||
nt|b_eymen: 2@c @d ya transfer olsa gerek|pg||
nt|nafiz: http://clubs.vugraph.com/tbricfed/teams_event.php?event=172&stage=368 sonuçlarla ilgili adres /link/url|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 110|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: diger masada kritik 4@s boardu oynaniyor ve olacak gibi|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: ve oldu:)|pg||
nt|akgun: 4s ye geldiler ama cok sancýlý oldu:)|pg||
nt|eccone: 3 nt çok kabak|pg||
nt|akgun: 1nt nin f1 olmasi ilginc|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: evet gördü iki tarafta alert etti|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: specs entitled to a partial refund when a 1-level contract is played|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this my be -1, but ok with spades the other way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi cindy|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello cindy,  welcome |pg||
nt|thommos: On @H lead and continuation 3@Hs and 2@Ss|pg||
nt|athene: yes, with east's actual hand, he would just raise hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but i mean those auctions are what west had in mind when he rejected the 1@H opener|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 10 tricks looks very difficult to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think you could push to 2 NT after 2@H if you opened the hand 1@H Will|pg||
nt|Walddk4: China has 5 IMPs more than shown on the scoreboard. They won an appeal|pg||
nt|athene: there's certainly a lot of work to do here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: her maç 16 board sürüyor|pg||
nt|eccone: 1 nt denileek ellerle ne yapýlor?|pg||
nt|eccone: 4@s -1|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: oo kuzey guneyin sistemine baktim da|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: cidden enteresan seyler var|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 1nt: 5+@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: eymen senin için soracaðým oyundan sonra:)|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 1@h: dengeli|pg||
pc|h6|nt|idblu: same def in the OR|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: club loses the tempo|pg||
nt|idblu: I would rather play the @H K than a @C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as it happens, but i think the real issue is how W expects to get in enough times. maybe lead a high one to indicate that you are just trying to get PD off possible later endplay, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then E would not be so afraid that W has a stiff spoade|pg||
nt|irwinbo: if i played a club, i would play the 6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: we see the hands of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: leading a heart stakes everything on position of heart ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club is worth considering but must lead a higher one|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like a @h lead is best for the defence|pg||
nt|geller: In the qfinal Japan open was losing 36-0 to China (same 4 members as now) before recovering for an easy win|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s lead for me|pg||
nt|geller: "tighten up the leak", "plug the dikes".....   Let's not go there.  :-)|pg||
nt|idblu: true...bid your 5carders|pg||
nt|othered1: I woudn't criticize taking invitational action on east's hand, I just wouldn't do it.|pg||
nt|xenya: but the @Cs are so favourable for declarer that he will have no trouble making it i think|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Jim|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 11-19puan|pg||
pc|hK|nt|snorris: wrong black suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: more @C |pg||
nt|panja: 2@S rebid, holding three Aces..and Jack in partner's suit..is on the conservative side..I dont know what else was available for South though|pg||
nt|cindy: yes luckily neither have the hand to dbl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But as the cards lie declarer may get out for 1 down|pg||
nt|snorris: this is awful bidding|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: North does not want to play in diamonds it seems|pg||
nt|snorris: thinks s has 5 @h and 4 @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now they have missed the best contract. I cannot see how they will make this without a favourable lead|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems harder for East to lead hearts though|pg||
nt|thommos: hi cindy|pg||
nt|caitlin: didnt expect that finesse|pg||
nt|athene: now a diamond i think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now  to count 10 tricks...hmm|pg||
nt|yo_yo: spade?|pg||
nt|athene: you want to set up some diamond ruffs, with the possibility of throwing @S3 on a club later on, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: west in the other room thought it was a 1nt opener as well|pg||
nt|athene: this must be the norm these days|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|snorris: that was a grave mistake|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: safe club exit..|pg||
nt|snorris: not playing @s|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess it's a "mixed raise"?|pg||
nt|cindy: still -7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W's chickens now come home to roost. he got what he asked for|pg||
nt|geller: The other semi is Oz vs. China ladies.    |pg||
nt|fahir: iyi yayýnlar iyi seyirler:)|pg||
nt|b_eymen: zor batardý|pg||
nt|vulkan: 2.bordda açýk odada Zorlu körle baþladý ve bir trefi @HRuaya deos ederek tam yaptý|pg||
nt|eccone: merak içindeyim|pg||

pc|h3|nt|werge: Because they have seen too many bad opening bids...!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ASnd the beginning of this was the first 1@h|pg||
nt|snorris: reverse dummy maybe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ??????|pg||
nt|snorris: well this will surely not win|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think NS will not tell anyone about this board|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so we will never know Hanlon's cunning plan unfortunately|pg||
nt|idblu: 7 losers opposite an opening bid|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: nice|pg||
nt|snorris: sneaky..|pg||
nt|werge: Best way to avoid the overtrick, seems to be to lead the @C 9...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's where i was going Fred -- was East too good for 2@H or not -- i think very close -- especially since @C location only presumptive|pg||
nt|sybarra2: spots work well for declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: oh yes, and @Hs, too, are nice|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wilkinsona: but tough guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perfect!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could get messy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It took 6 rounds of bidding in OPen to get to the same contract|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 10 grup var ve her grupta 8 er takým var|pg||
nt|b_eymen: pik partaj yada j@s tek e hep oluyodu|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I like the 3 heart call.. why let th oppo bid spades|pg||
nt|thommos: the Club lead is normal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Most of players will lead a @c, Yes|pg||
nt|thommos: Still some work for Declarer - @H now and has to find the endplay|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - in my coffee I see 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no a @h lead and you have 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Are you a soothsayer Hans?|pg||
nt|thommos: a @C also lead in the Open room|pg||
nt|werge: I also like 6 @H for sure|pg||
nt|geller: The official score still hasn't been updated  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest09/necj.html|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@H then double isn't bad at all for a description of east, if you can accept making a limit bid and bidding again.|pg||
nt|idblu: presumptive but odds on they fit with pard's @C or were over the overcaller|pg||
nt|arigun: @dK uygun yerde 3nt yapilabiliyor|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: konvansyon kartlarý bu linkte var her takýmýn|pg||
nt|eccone: Q@d A@d|pg||
nt|eccone: SANIRIM SÖLE YAPIYOR|pg||
nt|aruf: slm arkadaþlar|pg||
nt|akgun: slm|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: konvansiyon kartlarina baktigimda artifisyel oynayan takimlar ust turlara kalirlarsa enteresan maclar izleyebiliriz:)|pg||
nt|eccone: selam|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: slm faruk|pg||
pc|d6|nt|snorris: take @c and then @h|pg||
nt|thommos: This will now make 11|pg||
nt|idblu: usually worth a try|pg||
nt|idblu: 14 losers = game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yani herkes grubunda 7 maç yapacak ve ilk 3e giren takýmlar knockout aþamasýna kalacak|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bg: interesting play decision go allout with club split or ruff a dia and settle for six|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes 3@H 2@S and 2@C, while becaus they split 4-4 only loses 4@Ds|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzhn: and it showed attitude|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Misguessed spades. Now at least 2 down|pg||
nt|cindy: didnt clear that hurdle|pg||
nt|snorris: reverse dummy and a sqezze ?|pg||
nt|snorris: squezze|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|snorris: only 12|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will not do, but in 6@h it had worker with a reverse dummy|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer knows the @SK is right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult to lead out of turn with screens|pg||
nt|yo_yo: presumably they have screens?|pg||
nt|eccone: 1 NT DENÝLECEK ELLERLE DBL DÝYOLAR|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|arigun: defans icin @s baslangici, sonrasinda boslanirsa @c devami kontrati zorlayabilir ancak dagilim dekleranin lehine|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: skorlar yavas yavas girilmeye basladi|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: bu sene cok hizli bir sekilde bilgilere ulasabilmemiz guzel:)|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: :)|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: o nasil oluyor?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: if you look at NEC teams and players,  you will see many international stars are in this tourney |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well we can see this will not make looking at the cards, but Hanlon will be trying to make it|pg||
nt|eccone: baska bi çözüm yok|pg||
nt|eccone: :)|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 1nt oynamiyorlardir bence|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 1nt forsing tum eller|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 2c/2d oynamaya olabilir belki|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 2h de keser sorusu mesela:)|pg||
nt|akgun: karo V 3 lu olsa olabilirdi oyun|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: worked.. just witn a @h lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after 1nt there can be a problem if partner not has a @d suit (not bidden)|pg||
nt|athene: the defence could never cash the spade then play a club through|pg||
nt|athene: a very delicate hand, trying to set up winners everywhere and avoid 4 losers along the way|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to draw two rounds of trumps to enjoy a club trick|pg||
nt|athene: and that means only one diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: he must be hoping for one diamond ruff, one pitch on the @SQ and one on the @CK|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|akgun: yok yinede olmuyor|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|xenya: small slam is as cold as it can be -- a grand would require some inspired play in @Cs|pg||
nt|athene: but south can ruff the @SQ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: doðunun 5-5 majörü olmasý ilginç|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: I think a mere 4@D from W is better - 7@H could easily be on|pg||
nt|sharkey: makes now|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Easy - but hard to get accepted!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: yeah|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Nothing to the play here|pg||
nt|arigun: dogu 2 tur @c oynamak icin el tutamiyor|pg||
nt|MolvaM: baþka masalarda deklarasyon farklý geliþebilir eðer doðunun böyle eli gösterecek 1 konvansiyonu olur ise|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: WOW i missed the last bid. i guess S thought he had a slam try|pg||
nt|athene: no, can't make i don't think|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ama bu masada kuzey 1 kör dedikten sonra doðudaki oyuncunun bütün heyecaný kaçtý|pg||
nt|arigun: o durumda 2@d oynanmayacagi kesin :)|pg||
nt|b_eymen: bu tip elleri direkt açmak genelde pozitif sonuç veriyor|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: now he has to play @Ss from top|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: 630 at other table|pg||
nt|eccone: maalesef ele antre yok|pg||
pc|cK|nt|geller: 6nt would have been described as "safe as houses" but in the current financial climate SAFER than houses is a better description|pg||
pc|c6|nt|shevek: cold now?|pg||
nt|athene: on a trump back|pg||
nt|sharkey: no|pg||
nt|athene: declarer couldn't make on a trump back because he couldn't cash either black winner|pg||
nt|athene: but now he can do it|pg||
nt|sharkey: @SQ will be trumped|pg||
nt|athene: just crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: and trump coup south|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff, diamond ruff, @SQ|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|cindy: its -3 now, right ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|santyclz: Really?|pg||
nt|othered1: playing west for 109 or 108, not unreasonable.|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: board 3te diger masada cuebidlesmeler tamamlandi|pg||
nt|akgun: yere antre kalmiyor|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: i don't think they have spade game, so see no need to preempt|pg||
nt|xenya: CR is in 6N too|pg||
nt|othered1: only 1?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mcarroll: They are in 3NT in Open |pg||
nt|snorris: awful chashing 12 tricks in 2 @s|pg||
nt|petergill: Or 10 tricks as the play is going|pg||
nt|werge: They play better than they bid!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a rebis of 2@s on 16 high and a 6-card suit!|pg||
nt|petergill: Earlier, declarer could have safely set up the long club trick.|pg||
nt|snorris: throws @h 12 tricks|pg||
nt|bg: 2 down |pg||
pc|s9|nt|snorris: north has recovered well|pg||
nt|arigun: bu el degil belki cunki rakip gaza gelip zon diyor|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: ok, ping-pong here :) but of course it's an impossibly hard hand without sight of all the cards|pg||
pc|s3|nt|MolvaM: beklendiði gibi 2nolu boarddan mersin 9 kazandý|pg||
pc|s8|nt|cindy: right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with a throw in. now W can keep @sK9 and @d Q108|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cindy: couldnt see good :-)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest09/nec_bulj.html|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult even seeing all 4 hands for me|pg||
nt|shevek: 6 imps to China|pg||
nt|sharkey: S have both high @H so no promotion for N|pg||
nt|sharkey: IMPs to Oz players :)|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 4@H uzerine dusunuyor Kuzey|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 2@c 2@d mu basladý|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 6@d degil de 6@h oynarlarsa bu pek iyi olmayacak|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As declarer I like everyone to cooperate with me,,,,,,|pg||
nt|sharkey: Making now - 7 IMPs to the Korean team|pg||
nt|npcjpn: the 5th match data up.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|c8|nt|shevek: @h5 promoted|pg||
nt|athene: north's @H5 gets promoted|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bg: result not unexpectes when balancing withshaky values vul|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: last board now|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Johan Wahlberg. Great Job! Many thanks and our appreciation to the Swedish Bridge Federation and Jan ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: Kamras for allowing us to broadcast from this event. Thanks to my very learned fellow commentators Shirley, George, Vladimir, Roland and Ralf for their wit and perceptive comments ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes!|pg||

nt|marlowepi: can't the hearts wait?|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: potential for slam here|pg||

nt|Walddk2: This concludes our second official broadcast from Sweden. We are hopeful that we get many more. It's a treat for our many spectators to see Sweden's leading players in action. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sweden is a world class bridge nation|pg||
nt|roswolf: and another possible slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thanks all. Nice to work with you. I wish you a nice sunday afternoon|pg||
nt|sybarra: I believe we talked yesterday about the club "we" are seeing with 2200+ members |pg||
nt|roswolf: why didnt south show spades as well?|pg||
nt|sybarra: quite a large contingent |pg||
nt|mariner1: guilty by proximity|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - they earned it|pg||
nt|snorris: will n-s go to 2nt?|pg||
nt|snorris: 1 @s-1nt, 2nt?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 15 vs 7 - dont think so...|pg||
nt|snorris: 16|pg||
nt|sharkey: excuse me 16|pg||

nt|snorris: 4 in a M|pg||
nt|snorris: 5 @c or 4@hs?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: always longest suit|pg||
nt|cindy: ty :)|pg||
nt|werge: Quiet boards this morning|pg||
nt|mpny: SA is not a grand|pg||
nt|caitlin: this one harder to get to|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if their suits are agreed to be very good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after winning with @c10 he had all 13|pg||
nt|yo_yo: interesting that the Chinese ladies didnt try for game|pg||
nt|wygbe1: well 4h will probably make |pg||
nt|b_eymen: sanmam paþam|pg||
nt|b_eymen: hýzlýca 3 nt oynayacaklar|pg||
mb|1S|nt|panja: NS dont make 4@S here..because of @C ruff..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but be bid?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: They are off Nelson!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yep|pg||
nt|josj: once again N holds QJx in a vital suit, this time to beat a slam|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 19-20  i am informed ty Al|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so they might not get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: could get murky now|pg||
nt|xenya: are we sure 3@D is not a 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 @S - 1 NT - 2@C - 2@S?|pg||
nt|snorris: then there might be a fight|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 1@s - 1nt - 2@c -2@s?|pg||
nt|snorris: west will bid on though|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, 4@D splinter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: mind you, my openings are sounder than this one|pg||
nt|snorris: might be hard to reach|pg||
nt|cindy: looks like 3N this time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a good case for opening 1S. 1C is clear second choice for me|pg||
nt|idblu: the same 1/2 imp?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hard now to stop|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: aksamki incelemelerime gore ciftlerin en az %60-70i multi oynuyor, ve bu multide genelde 2nt elleri de var|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 5li majorlu ya da majorsuz|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: eglenceli eller izleyebiliriz|pg||
mb|2C|nt|frankaus: green so can afford to be conservative |pg||
nt|irwinbo: is looks right to me|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be tricky to defend 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think they will get there|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont like to distort my distribution with a full opening bid|pg||
nt|josj: they should, however, as slam is well over 75%|pg||
nt|josj: board should be a push at 6@C-1|pg||
nt|akgun: 4. board muhtemel egale olacak 3 nt kabak ancak demek cok kolay degil|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in the US the green party is NOT conservative|pg||
nt|snorris: 5 @h on|pg||
nt|panja: I dont like E's pass....|pg||
nt|werge: Then 5 @h is lay-down, South has given the solution for palying @d-suit|pg||
nt|cindy: next :-)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: does anyone of you know what 2@d opening means?|pg||
nt|snorris: think w has to bid it himself|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @d on a nt seems to be majors|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west likely to bid it, though missed in the other room|pg||
nt|idblu: 3rd chair allows a 4 card major opening...especially with a suit as good as this|pg||
nt|cindy: dont play in a womens event|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good principle cindy. but i don;t really see what bad can happen after 1S|pg||
nt|cindy: they will rake you across the coals for doing that|pg||
nt|sybarra: jamming the auction perhaps to no avail |pg||
nt|thommos: hard to bid 7S now|pg||
nt|sharkey: in @D it is - but dont think they'll end up in 7@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you want to check out EW Convention Card from 2007, try [sorry, i still don't know how to make smaller URLs]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2007BermudaBowlShanghai/bermuda-bowl/Japan/TeramotoTakayama.pdf|pg||
nt|caitlin: they likely have another way to show weaker preempts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might make if you just blast to slam|pg||
nt|athene: well it was an interesting bidding decision for east, facing a strong notrump - perhaps the australian's 1NT is a point stronger than the Chinese?|pg||
nt|sharkey: In OR W didnt inquire with Stayman - just blasted into 4@H via transfer.  Cud have missed 4-4 @S fit|pg||
nt|wygbe1: impossible to bid, especially after 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|b_eymen: elemelerde genelede bu tip elller|pg||
nt|b_eymen: batýnýn 1nt agresif|pg||
nt|vulkan: genellikle direk 2nt de 5li M yok, multide 5li M var|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|sybarra: wonder if they had a 2 suited call |pg||
nt|caitlin: at other table @D lead from North but did take @SQ finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now 2@S|pg||
nt|josj: 6nt is down a lot :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: they could have had 800 in 3@D x|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I dont know their defence bidding, but this can be a 2-suiter with @s and @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: I believe there were no alert on 3D|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS may play 2/1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I´m not quite sure of 4@d. It looks like E has red cards and it could help them to find the @d split|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @c|pg||
nt|idblu: pards a passed hand...you expect to get to a game?|pg||
nt|cindy: well  i want to have a chance to get to game if its right|pg||
nt|sharkey: guess it proves that science not always better :)|pg||
nt|athene: i like that action|pg||
nt|athene: it's pretty rare that you want to play in spades with west's hand facing 1nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think the Chines Women use a 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nothing showing on web page about carryover, but haven't read conditions of contest|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2 karo: 3 renk ile soruyor|pg||
nt|b_eymen: evet|pg||
nt|b_eymen: minör elleri sorun oluyo|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: evet ama emin olun cok enteresan 2@d ler gordum:)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|othered1: I wonder how ambiguous east's hand is in their style|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which made the chosen line clearly a swing line|pg||
nt|xenya: easy 4@H for NS. There is a cheap @D save for EW but they are ublikely to find it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: had anyone of you bid 2@d on E? I had|pg||
nt|roswolf: this isnt|pg||
nt|josj: very well bid btw|pg||
nt|roswolf: east offering a choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: in these superfit situations it pays to bid one more...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but, then only 9 tricks were made|pg||
nt|snorris: then 3@h and ..|pg||
nt|bg: same auction as before N had a feature here none will settle in game|pg||
nt|othered1: AS the cards lie, east isn't a favorite at all to find @S lead|pg||
nt|idblu: the teams that finished ahead of the team they were playing had a 1/2 imp c/o|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if  3@D-3@H 4@H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes |pg||
nt|josj: the quanti raise often suggests a minor|pg||
nt|josj: (or two)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: doðuda 3lü pik araþtýrmasý |pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: 2@S forcing?|pg||
nt|sybarra: W might have found it |pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|werge: Passive E/W - 5 @D...|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice lead, but declarer can pitch dummy's third @D on @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but if half imp comes into play in 64 board match we're in for a great time tonight|pg||
nt|idblu: in the 1/4's and semis|pg||
nt|idblu: good bid 2@H|pg||
nt|sybarra2: waiting for next X?|pg||
nt|idblu: might inspire S to bid more|pg||
nt|akgun: evet 3nt de duracaklar artik|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: is this conventional or a psych|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if club system?|pg||
nt|snorris: thinking about 2nt?|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer got the clubs right to score 9 tricks OR, even after a heart lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When playing 1nt forcing, there always is problems with hands like S|pg||
nt|snorris: well done west|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thought it was 3 clubs last time|pg||
nt|cindy: N was sorta fixed for a bid|pg||
nt|idblu: keycarding with a void hard to work out|pg||
nt|cindy: what could he do ?|pg||
nt|idblu: he was strapped...on a guess|pg||
nt|bg: 7 spades would make provided S cashes AK dia before 3 rd club|pg||
nt|mpny: apparently|pg||
nt|idblu: almost came into play last night against JUICE|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 rounds of @C to discard dummy's @D -- but great try|pg||
nt|arigun: 3@c makul kontrat, hicbir zon'un sansi yok|pg||
nt|MolvaM: doðu ise 2 kör ile 3lü pik yok ama 4lü kör var dedi|pg||
nt|arigun: Batinin 2@d su 3. renk, ileri dagilim soruyor|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: once again the Chinese woman win the auction|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Tony, 2@c was a little bit weak|pg||
nt|snorris: east knows south has 4 @h so didnt dear bid more|pg||
nt|thommos: this lead will be well received by declarer|pg||
nt|werge: With this lead = 3 NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if they play weak jump shifts it's forcing yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW are using upside-down count & attitude, so 8@H = frown|pg||
nt|othered1: And, indeed, at other table south is declarer after a multi and transfer auction|pg||
nt|yo_yo: smolen in action :)|pg||
nt|athene: @SAK and a trump to lose here|pg||
nt|vulkan: 1NT den sonra 2@c de durmak da çok enteresan|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: ozellikle burdur maclarindan birine denk gelirsek tum bbo'yu aydogdularin masasinda gorebiliriz|pg||
nt|b_eymen: dogunun 1 nt ye 2@c |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Yes - If 1 NT forcing 2@S shud show a mere preference or weak @S raise|pg||
nt|snorris: @d lead?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -2!|pg||
nt|snorris: might get it undoubled'|pg||
nt|panja: no point in defending against superfit..you never know what will get ruffed..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: however steals the contract... perhaps as south has shown hearts|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: its not really right though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1S hardly prevents me from getting to game|pg||
nt|idblu: well they got to game...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may have to drop that spade Q to stand a chance..|pg||
nt|irwinbo: they rate to go down on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|idblu: that he won't do|pg||
nt|idblu: maybe they play Roth-Stone?|pg||
nt|idblu: N passes 12+ hands frequently|pg||
nt|werge: They are too happy with their double-stopper in @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: some play it constructive I believe|pg||
nt|werge: Run to 4 @H|pg||
nt|mpny: 4H is making|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt instead of a better 4@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: S doesnt know pd has 6@H|pg||
nt|mpny: I hate the dbl. the opponents are unlimited, your Spades are not that great. why should partner have a trick|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud bid 4@D|pg||
nt|caitlin: same auction open room|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tinyurl for cc: http://tinyurl.com/boohrd|pg||
nt|caitlin: Joe, we know why Roland 'hired' you:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now @H7 = current count [odd]|pg||
nt|santyclz: For my comedy relief?|pg||
nt|caitlin: that too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think heart 7 was actually spade signal|pg||
nt|yo_yo: frue will be glad to be dummy, to recover from that last one|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like the double indicated @Ds -- good use of opponents' transfers |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yesterday the slams I saw them bid were all making|pg||
nt|arigun: 3lu @s vey 4lu @h|pg||
nt|eccone: 2 nt 5-5 mi oldu|pg||
nt|aruf: bastan 1 @S e 3 @c tercih ederdim|pg||
nt|akgun: 5431 gibi|pg||
nt|eccone: 1@d 15+ imiþ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cindy: i think the pass is curious|pg||
nt|snorris: still should win 8 tricks|pg||
nt|caitlin: also in 4 in open room|pg||
nt|shevek: real score is 64-29 due to an appeal|pg||
nt|aruf: ok ama 5-5 el gözükmüyor hala|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barbyh: oops|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 9 with a right guess in @c|pg||
nt|snorris: the @cs are the key|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: once again 9 tricks pos if declare gets the clubs|pg||
nt|snorris: small @h from west to show @c|pg||
nt|panja: how does W show that he wants @C now?|pg||
nt|snorris: interest|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same bidding next door|pg||
nt|irwinbo: for all of its 11 points, the north hand is only worth 1nt over 1 diamond|pg||
nt|cindy: hard to bid 7 without knowing about trump Q|pg||
nt|thommos: it is not a good 7, |pg||
nt|sybarra: at the moment,  S probably just as happy to be in 6 |pg||
nt|cindy: and they dont have it even|pg||
nt|sharkey: @S lead @C shift|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not show this over 2@s with 3@h instead of 2nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Mike - cud have been overtricks too|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in evaluating S hand it could help too|pg||
nt|wygbe1: it gave n a chance to upgrade his stiff d, if s elected to show a superaccept|pg||
nt|xenya: sure|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but it should be a flat board|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/press/pdf/2007_sekai_3.pdf|pg||
nt|josj: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: photo of JAPAN OPEN Team at the top|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panja: not a pause and small @H though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10 tricks after that lead and only 7 with a @s lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very aggressive double - why should a spade lead be best anyway?|pg||
nt|mpny: the C shift should still be easy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
nt|b_eymen: demesini hala cözemedim|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|werge: Look at dummy,pls|pg||
nt|idblu: @S to A @D down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: diamonds need to be led twice from dummy so..|pg||
nt|cindy: no it isnt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iþe 22 puanlýk bir 3NT kontratý|pg||
nt|eccone: 3@c diyince gözükürdü|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: hmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: so who leads a @H on this auction?|pg||
nt|barbyh: whoever is on lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: so a push |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so the landslide continues|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the lead solves the problem of how to play trumps|pg||
nt|b_eymen: tref partaj olsa bu dagýlýma 5@c yaparrdý|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: sistemsel bir problem oldu galiba|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cindy: thing universal heart lead|pg||
nt|cindy: think|pg||
nt|snorris: semms like it|pg||
nt|arigun: sanirim 3. renk sonraasi 3@c zon forcingi anlasildi, aksi takdirde dogunun pass demesi lazim minimum eli var|pg||
nt|b_eymen: gerçi onauda yapamazdý tref atagýna|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 3nt denmesi gerekiyodu|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: NS could have competed here, too, but can't make much if EW find the @C ruffs|pg||
nt|othered1: But opening lead there was also @D|pg||
nt|shevek: 64 - 29.5 actually (Oz has 0.5 carryover)  from Elmer|pg||
nt|athene: now you could throw either spades or clubs on the diamonds|pg||
nt|b_eymen: sistemlik biþiy yok onu diyorum|pg||
nt|vulkan: ben 3NT erdim|pg||
nt|eccone: belki ondada 5li@s 5li@h vardiye cok sýkýstýrmamak lazým|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: curious or timid. like the 60's film "i am curious yellow"|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may need to 'splain  this one  |pg||
nt|snorris: a good jack.. will it help+|pg||
nt|snorris: ?|pg||
nt|panja: y, no need to show any interest...a look at dummy tells you it must be Clubs|pg||
nt|panja: still, I wonder why none of EW doubled....|pg||
nt|snorris: Harada pondering|pg||
nt|snorris: seems|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why?|pg||
nt|eccone: yane 2@c 2@h 3@c 3@h gibi|pg||
nt|eccone: veya 2@c 3@h|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzhn: "Take a chance with the 9|pg||
nt|caitlin: by West|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: but he found @cK|pg||
nt|idblu: all conjecture now|pg||
nt|idblu: if he cashes a 2nd @D he will be happier|pg||
nt|thommos: qC next is ok|pg||
nt|idblu: but @DK before pitching is better technique|pg||
nt|sharkey: woman intuition may apply :) - looks like down 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you can't argue with that|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as I play - with a weak hand I bid 2 @h over 1@s showing a 6-card suit and 2@d with a stronger hand, so 3@h is my bid after 2@s |pg||
nt|sharkey: never tried....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not worth it|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: Agree Ralf - but you mave a a problem getting to 3NT then|pg||
nt|idblu: was a great lead...once again|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cindy: heh|pg||
nt|cindy: i am curious green|pg||
nt|frankaus: i use green as NV  no doubt u have worked it out|pg||

nt|idblu: @D10 looks right..|pg||

nt|b_eymen: en minumumu var zaten|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: a finess in @c for safe|pg||
pc|d5|nt|barbyh: hope so|pg||
nt|cindy: well    they have 24 hcp|pg||
nt|werge: But East should havr cashed his other red Ace|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: claim coming |pg||
nt|ahollan1: as advertised -- well done on both sides|pg||
nt|idblu: that certainly won't|pg||

nt|cindy: probably makes 5C but tuff to bid that|pg||
nt|snorris: running home?|pg||
nt|panja: small @D is risky|pg||
nt|panja: had this been a doubled contract..on the @C3 return..E might have been tempted to play a small @D...|pg||
nt|bg: 1 imp to Japan|pg||
nt|sharkey: unexpected - but dont think it matters|pg||
nt|athene: just a question now of how to play trumps|pg||
nt|athene: probably @HA and another|pg||
nt|MolvaM: biraz zorlama bir kontrat ve batacak gibi duruyor|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: need your guessing shoes on for 5 @C but sure close to it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @hA and all is over|pg||
nt|arigun: sayet batinin 3@c i zon forcingi ise, davet eli ile ne yapmak lazim |pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: i hate more hands than that. there must be at least 5000 hands i hate|pg||
nt|santyclz: In a fair world, w would ruff the 3rd @c.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bg: sry|pg||
nt|thommos: A high @C was lead in the OR|pg||
nt|athene: or not :)|pg||
nt|athene: i was thinking Del'Monte might have been worried about a spade over-ruff now|pg||
nt|athene: but probably he trusts that if the defence had a spade ruff, they would have taken it|pg||
nt|athene: so playing for them to have misdefended is just a grosvenor coup|pg||
nt|santyclz: Simplifying the play.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|cindy: just have to find @dQ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is the women's team the finalists at Beijing?|pg||
nt|bg: should have drawn trump before second dia doesnt matter here but it could have with hearts 4-1|pg||
nt|shevek: good point raised by Roland, maybe 32 bds in the semi-final not enough?|pg||

nt|arigun: bence 2@c uzerine 3. renk yapmadan 3@c demek iyi bir fikir, neticede 5li @s var ama ortagi daveti kabul eden 3lu @s fiti olan ellerle zaten 3@s der ve 4@s kacmaz|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|snorris: if s has 4 @s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if so they know what they are doing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Teramoto having hard time believing partner has the perfect @S holdin|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Delmonte should finesse a second time so he needs to return to hand|pg||
nt|idblu: who said life was fair|pg||
nt|eccone: ama sistemleri ne bilmiyoruz tabe|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wilkinsona: can be -3 now...|pg||

nt|cindy: would always make it if u didnt have that tricky 10|pg||
nt|snorris: jep|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Not even trying for 9?|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud be down if @C AJ behand and @H5-3?|pg||

nt|bg: good guess  opps too busy signaling;))|pg||
nt|snorris: 40-0!!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Im not sure I follow wests pass of 1 spade x...|pg||
nt|snorris: well.. no not enough|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well done to the ladies|pg||
nt|sharkey: difference in style - NS only got to 2@D other room...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very much so - the final pass looks rather pessimistic|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is becoming embarassing|pg||
nt|xenya: even 6@D would have been profitable for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fred -- i'm sure that was me|pg||
nt|idblu: I thought so|pg||
nt|xenya: still it's hard to see S bid 4@H all on his own -- N had an opportunity to insert 3@H over 3@D |pg||
nt|mcarroll: same contract in OR|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu vugraf yayýnlarýndaki 1 baþka sorunumuz da þu|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: the Seniors are taking a big lead early here|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|cindy: 3N could be a struggle |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 40-0 after 6 boards! unbelieveable!|pg||
nt|irwinbo: the problem with i diamond is that when partner bids one spade you have to bid 2nt|pg||
nt|idblu: 1N n/s a good spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: Micry fends kisses  by E|pg||
nt|werge: Ah - some fun - bad @s-break|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|sharkey: 1@D = 1+ @D?|pg||

nt|irwinbo: ca't be|pg||
nt|xenya: anyone know what 2@C is?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ralfwil: but no use of that with only singleton @s|pg||
nt|snorris: redouble might mean something special|pg||
nt|cindy: this cant be right|pg||
nt|idblu: THATS  a weak NT|pg||
nt|bg: 1430 may lose an imp should make 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i once lost a 7 board set to Meckwell by over 60 -- everyone on their team won a christmas tree|pg||
nt|bg: somwe kind of part score here- as Joey Silver would say--next|pg||
nt|othered1: north might bid some NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: will never guess the @H  |pg||
nt|caitlin: I will be very surprised if Mori bids 2N; it is his least favourite bid |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a bad split in @h and a @c lead will make it difficult in 4@h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: dbl!|pg||
nt|idblu: yea...but living in Arizona slants your views on life :)|pg||
nt|othered1: game isn't particularly goo dhere|pg||

nt|eccone: evet|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Compare this hand with the last east opened -- that's a pretty good range in a limited opening system.|pg||
nt|snorris: like an honor in @s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a lot of matches have had wild swings of momentum|pg||
nt|athene: south has a good hand for a non-forcing 2@D bid but not many people play that outside Poland|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: roses are saying "we've senior big lead and are not scared"|pg||
nt|cindy: harhar|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok folks,  I am going to leave you, breakfast meeting are not my thing, but have an early one tomorrow |pg||
nt|sharkey: and almost opening hand?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but we didn´t see what EW discarded on @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But W had made 5@h after the 4@d bid!|pg||
nt|snorris: better pass..|pg||
nt|snorris: south|pg||
nt|idblu: yes...I am surprised he didn't make 7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: miss a vulnerable game. Gain 12 imps. Too easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: there you go |pg||
nt|fabsayc: lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: but he had no other bid:)|pg||
nt|othered1: That, invitational, feels about what it is worth.  But maybe 2@D forces to far|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe showing 0-7 :)|pg||
nt|athene: sorry WEST has a good hand...|pg||
nt|wygbe1: tough bid for s here|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i think 3h would be my choice|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu 3 karo açýþý biraz insiyatifli oldu|pg||
nt|b_eymen: @d ya transfer|pg||
nt|aruf: dogu batý en son 2 @C deklaresi yapacak gibi gözüküyor ama sonrasý ilginç|pg||

mb|2H|nt|mariner1: only part scores here|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @s a fit bid it seems|pg||
nt|ralfwil: One of my principles. Dont tell too mych in a competitive bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: much....|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: suppose so..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: rather strange to land in only 2@d in OR|pg||
nt|josj: this time it seems to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: you're welcome|pg||
nt|yo_yo: all happy and smiling except for the ladies captain :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: g'night shirley|pg||
nt|barbyh: bye shirl|pg||
nt|sybarra: gl with all the rest,  g'night all |pg||
nt|sharkey: claimed before we cud Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only to help partner|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: has to get the spades right here|pg||
nt|snorris: arrgg..|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|werge: 2@C should include a weak minor-2|pg||
nt|xenya: there have been several suggestions from the kibitzers as to the meaning of the 2@C bid|pg||
nt|werge: D = do not lead @D?|pg||
nt|idblu: yes...7@D once they find the fit|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the @H Q falling makes 4@H but not an obvious play |pg||
nt|eccone: @c bulurlar|pg||
nt|akgun: 2c guneye kadar geri gelir|pg||
nt|akgun: undo?|pg||
nt|aruf: normal sartlarda öyle olmasý gerek ama masada her sey farklý oluyor psikoloji hava vs...|pg||
nt|eccone: buda ilginc bi declere oldu|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ralfwil: In this position I play D showing a 4-card suit and 1@s shows a 5-card suit. Do youplay like that?|pg||
nt|irwinbo: can't|pg||
nt|caitlin: he often says...now watch them run hearts at me or whatever|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if south could have bid a non-invitational 3@C?|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: takimlar oldukca agresif:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: another advers sacrifice|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 4@D bid is a strong clue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may well do so |pg||
nt|snorris: the woes will never end|pg||
nt|snorris: I do|pg||
nt|thommos: what do you all play the pass from South as?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@c checkback|pg||
nt|xenya: all very different|pg||
nt|idblu: try Canada....|pg||
nt|santyclz: Mirror distribution.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i had skewed perspective in other states too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now 4@D, ace asking?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=BAL 8+ game force|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does he know something.....|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be murder|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: no:)|pg||
nt|eccone: hava iyiymis izmirde faruk|pg||

nt|eccone: oh oh|pg||
mb|3D|nt|snorris: 5 @h only -1|pg||
nt|snorris: but no|pg||
nt|ralfwil: often difficult in reversed vulnerable|pg||
nt|panja: neither the 1@C opening not this pass of 4@S by W bid are easy to understand...I mean the ratinale behind either|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 2NT is a puppet to 3@c, then 3NT shows 3@s and 4@h.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: or cue all the way |pg||
nt|idblu: 3@S Q|pg||
nt|idblu: cue|pg||
nt|josj: 2@D is safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: sensible run out|pg||
nt|MolvaM: gene de makul kontrata gelindi|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 3@d 4@h daha iyi bi dec|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H could be the contract which has tough chances|pg||
nt|marlowepi: deepfinesse makes 4H i bet|pg||
nt|snorris: 3nt is difficult |pg||
nt|snorris: with @d lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was first push bd |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe righting the ship for Israel |pg||
nt|bg: not sure what those bids meant but contact is right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if NS play 2 way Stayman [part of original Precision]   I like 2@C rather than 2@D - because East will never make a lead directing DBL|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 4@h mantýklý|pg||

nt|aruf: kenan sen kagýtlarý takip et kardeþim|pg||
nt|eccone: pas gfmi?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|wilkinsona: easy now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: important to play E for the right A with a @d lead, but now....|pg||
nt|snorris: well west doesnt know if east has @ds|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree with @S lead?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no!|pg||
nt|othered1: agree on @S play, but it's not guaranteed|pg||
nt|snorris: can he slip this home+|pg||
nt|snorris: ?|pg||
nt|werge: Yes|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, most would bid 1 spade by west|pg||
nt|cindy: at the 1 level i usually play no preference|pg||
nt|cindy: only at 1 level though|pg||
nt|thommos: above one level as penalty?|pg||
nt|cindy: yes|pg||
nt|thommos: 3NT likely to make 11|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H invitational values I assume|pg||
nt|athene: this looks to be down only one?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Wang has a good hand for 2@S dont you think?|pg||
nt|othered1: even 3@S needs some racing luck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 1N=14-16, i think hand might be too good, if 15-17, just right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: x@D lead:)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: was one spade like a forcing nt?|pg||
nt|xenya: this will probably fail|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with this super lead|pg||
nt|akgun: pas pas:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: NS in Open are in 2@D only|pg||
nt|cindy: the are fluctuating between conservative and aggressive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wish they would let ME do that when i lead|pg||
nt|idblu: tuff dummy to lead into|pg||
nt|cindy: nothing good to do here it seems      another spade ?|pg||
nt|idblu: whtas his is his|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D unlikely to cost|pg||
nt|cindy: i would like to play it penalty at 1 level too but cant get any of my partners to play it that way :)|pg||
nt|athene: for two down, the defence have to get a diamond ruff AND stop the spade ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another good lead|pg||
nt|othered1: How would you play this, needing lots of good things to happen?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dolayýsý ile güney ders almadý. ileride gene açar bu elle 3@d|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 3@s 4@h|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ta ki zon kaçýrana kadar|pg||
nt|arigun: 5@d major ataklara batiyor, 5! in sansi yok, iyi yerde durdu kocaeli takimi|pg||
nt|b_eymen: HERSEY UYGUN|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: this could be a push also|pg||
nt|npcjpn: it is a kind of puppet stayman, in case opener has 5@s.|pg||
nt|thommos: I do play it as penalties|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and extremely unlucky mirroring it is Joe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Liu is out for blood|pg||
nt|vulkan: benim baðlantýda sorun var galiba yazdýklarým takriben 15 dkka sonra düþüyo|pg||
nt|b_eymen: bendede oluyor hocam|pg||

nt|b_eymen: @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: "congressive"--good description|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 times @h maby?|pg||
nt|snorris: maybe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only if EW not take their 2@h and 3@s tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well defence has 5 on top now|pg||
nt|cindy: well then  you could be my partner|pg||
nt|idblu: obviously they have never played rubber bridge|pg||
nt|idblu: @D's have been set|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cindy: yes !!|pg||
nt|cindy: excellent|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: spade does not look unreasonable really|pg||
nt|sharkey: always good in the post-mortem to lead pd's suit - unless you have a very good reason to do otherwise|pg||
nt|mpny: that was a very good stop|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we like that opening bid?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@h is better than 2@s but how stop there?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this may make, if West can hold the trump losers to two|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - only 8 tricks with best defence I think|pg||
nt|xenya: to quote a kibitzer: their CC say "w2 in @D or GF one-suiter or 20-21 bal"  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for spectators -- mirroring is when both hands of partnerhip have exact same distribution|pg||
pc|s3|nt|panja: down now|pg||
nt|cindy: E wishes he could have S lead again|pg||
nt|bg: double dummy low cub to 9 low spade to queen this could be made|pg||
nt|cindy: poor Levin   always in a potential endplay situation |pg||
nt|bg: drop spade king great play if he finds it|pg||
nt|cindy: he is thinking about it|pg||
nt|sybarra: best if in tempo|pg||
nt|sybarra: or closer tempo than this |pg||
nt|cindy: cant use the phone excuse in live bridge|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence need to find a diamond ruff it seems|pg||
nt|werge: WHICH trump will North lead?|pg||
nt|santyclz: On a trump lead, I'd pull, take the @c finesse eliminate and exit in @hs.  As I said, my pd declares better than I.|pg||
nt|santyclz: If the get to 6@ss, I hope e doesn't x.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: they missed their 4-4 fit in @s and found the best contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so no discards or ruffs available for extra tricks|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: (they)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is now a messy auction|pg||
nt|josj: slam seems far away|pg||
nt|b_eymen: @d yu býrakmassa -1|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|snorris: so now is the time..|pg||
nt|bg: safer to play it as no preference frequency of having right cards for a penalty is too low|pg||
nt|chessmaste: North was lucky his side had an escape from 2@C redoubled|pg||
nt|akgun: simdi kucuk kormu oynayacak?|pg||
nt|eccone: elde kalmak icin 10@s deniyebilirdi|pg||
nt|eccone: ama baska bi planý var galiba|pg||
nt|akgun: eelde kalmasi iyi olmus aslinda|pg||
nt|eccone: en iyi @s oynamasý lazým |pg||
nt|eccone: Q@S|pg||
nt|aruf: baya uzun sürecek bu el :) pike dvm mantýklý gözüküyor|pg||
nt|akgun: 3s 2h 2c 2d yapmayi becerebilirse olacak 3nt|pg||
nt|eccone: baska secenek yok galiba|pg||
nt|eccone: :)|pg||
nt|eccone: 2@h aldýrmazlar|pg||
nt|eccone: 3@s te|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|snorris: the weakness of the strong @c systems is the 1 @d bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be tricky to cash these spades though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If I open with 1@d ny next bid would be 2@C|pg||
nt|athene: whether the @D9 can be read depends on what sort of count signals the Chinese ladies play|pg||
nt|athene: if they play upside down, it has to be a singleton|pg||
nt|shevek: note Ish played the 8 not the 6|pg||
nt|idblu: needs @C hook now|pg||
nt|josj: the X was optimistic, too|pg||
pc|sK|nt|idblu: the expert duck|pg||
nt|yo_yo: suicidal more like it|pg||
nt|b_eymen: acaba gördüklerim dogrumu|pg||
nt|eccone: en iyi oyun dam @s|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: club to the eight to make 4|pg||
nt|mariner1: aggresserrvative?|pg||
nt|bg: how many open S with 1 club? How is pard supposed to know what is going on?|pg||
nt|othered1: you might be able to strip the hand of back suits then @HAx and hope something really good happens|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north knows enough now|pg||
nt|eccone: @h|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|snorris: when it doesnt promise the suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now it´s important to play @h|pg||
nt|sharkey: In this case I think E has length in @D as for sure short in @C - thus I thin @D lead stands out|pg||
nt|snorris: agree but might be 11-13 flat and no d|pg||
nt|snorris: suit|pg||
nt|idblu: your line looks right Joe|pg||
pc|h6|nt|snorris: still 10 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no finesse now|pg||
nt|athene: yes, Del'Monte does his best to confuse the issue|pg||
nt|shevek: but that didn't help|pg||
nt|athene: but to no avail|pg||
nt|athene: when you play upside down count you like your singletons to be large|pg||
nt|eccone: @s|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: gesundheit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What was that! playing @h?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that. if S has AQ they are not likely to beat 1NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what will happen on OR?|pg||
nt|athene: as then partner can tell you don't have a doubleton|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cindy: think think think|pg||
nt|santyclz: A (slight) chance for Japan Open.|pg||
nt|caitlin: and they didn't in open room|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't open those, but it is a popular style today to get in on stuff like this.|pg||
nt|idblu: and she heard you|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer has all the entries to dummy he wants for a @H finesse...|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|snorris: moment of truth..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: need the spades now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Not that way!|pg||
nt|idblu: the duck  of the KC! cost a trick|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: could be +2 now for a small swing |pg||
nt|idblu: tournament players like to play almost all 2 level and lower doubles are takeout |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for spectators -- in 2-way Stayman,  1N-2@D = Game Force  and opener will not only show/deny 4 card major, but will also bid 3@C/@D with 5/6 card suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but ruff sluff doesn't help here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wd!|pg||
nt|xenya: we can expect a push on this board|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes withno entries would be forced to play @HAK which works on this layout|pg||
nt|MolvaM: öyle gibi|pg||
nt|eccone: simdi @s|pg||
pc|s8|nt|panja: W must go up with trump Ace next|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: oops|pg||
nt|fabsayc: right play, has pitch|pg||
nt|fabsayc: about 70% slam, but after reverse surely at least 6 at other table, so odds are enough|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|snorris: no sorry|pg||
nt|snorris: c|pg||
nt|snorris: @c ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: still OK, if she reads the hand corrextly|pg||
nt|snorris: this seems all wrong..|pg||
nt|cindy: whats rubber bridge|pg||
nt|santyclz: That's the problem, Al.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: henüz tekzip yayýnlanmadý|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: and single and return!!|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|idblu: money bridge|pg||
nt|yo_yo: malinowsky in 3@H next door|pg||
nt|eccone: @C e A|pg||
nt|eccone: @D YA j|pg||
nt|eccone: 400|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|sharkey: disagree Snorri - W has 5 @C and N has bid them...|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: made!|pg||
nt|snorris: at last some imps|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so the fightback begins..|pg||
pc|c6|nt|idblu: lots of outs now|pg||
nt|santyclz: But maybe they won't realize that and play @ds for you.|pg||
nt|eccone: mecburen as|pg||
nt|aruf: baska caresi yok |pg||
nt|eccone: karoyu tercih etmeyince bu planý yapmýs|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: thus max 1 @C in pd's hand I think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: curious that he didnt finesse the spade--leaves a much more flexible position|pg||
nt|irwinbo: certainly is|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cindy: down 1 now i think|pg||
nt|cindy: and next question   whats money|pg||
nt|b_eymen: tref uygun yerde degilis sorry|pg||

pc|h2|nt|athene: ok, well done|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|idblu: :)  OK...I give|pg||
nt|ahollan1: true -- but expect this level of partnership to correctly show count|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cindy: lolol|pg||
nt|eccone: A karoda yeter mi?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: winning 2 imps|pg||
nt|idblu: @S can get out a small @D if thrown in|pg||
nt|idblu: South|pg||
nt|vulkan: elden Valeye baþlarsa olur :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|wilkinsona: weel, I think its not unreasonable to try 3N on these cards and NS are rewarded..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@D=1430 response, 5@H= queen ask 6@C=yes and club king|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...there are 2 diamond stops, and Im not sure there is not a play for it even after the diamond lead|pg||
nt|bg: aks the World Bank what's money?|pg||
nt|xenya: NS did very well to avoid playing in a 4-4 fit -- might be another swing for them?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: will be pleased to see @D breaking |pg||
nt|eccone: yetez|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cindy: right !|pg||
nt|idblu: for sure they don't know|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|wilkinsona: Q for +3|pg||
nt|idblu: 2 trick swing here possible|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 8 li gelince kritik|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sybarra: you mean that bank WE support?|pg||
nt|idblu: if S wins, small @D, if N @C|pg||
nt|idblu: or @H from either|pg||
nt|othered1: north has exact count on the hand, no?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sharkey: Problems now|pg||
nt|sharkey: @SA and @S best|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another 11 count opener bites the dust|pg||
nt|mpny: just A and a trump|pg||
nt|mpny: lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - down|pg||
nt|mpny: I know|pg||
nt|mpny: no way to make from here|pg||
nt|mpny: still a small pick up for the good stop|pg||
nt|sharkey: I had sympathy for this 11 point opener Kath - at least she wanted a lead in the suit|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: What do you think of the bidding in OR - 21S by S must show extra values?|pg||
nt|idblu: win 3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well read....now I may forget that 8 is good but south ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spec says life is too short to spend 10 minutes on a 1NT contract at IMPs|pg||
nt|idblu: someone tell him the 8@D is good|pg||
nt|cindy: money is so yesterday|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|idblu: money is the new wallpaper|pg||
nt|cindy: lolol|pg||
nt|bg: btub you need plaenty of it to get master points|pg||
nt|bg: plenty|pg||
nt|cindy: maybe we can start using masterpoints for money|pg||
nt|idblu: my bank gives credit for gold points|pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|aruf: Yaþar abi çift bilgisayrdanmý oynuyor yoksa :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|yo_yo: i am conducting a survey on 11 count openers :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like North's overtake and continue|pg||
nt|b_eymen: :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|werge: If you open the East hand, I would rebid @D - - 10 7 6 5 is not a suit for bidding|pg||

nt|ralfwil: I don´t pass on N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and still -1!!!!!|pg||
nt|snorris: strange @h play there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: through the whole play|pg||
nt|werge: 7 NT - to avoid any ruffs...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sorry, yes well done|pg||
nt|othered1: west likely won't get to open 1@C here|pg||
nt|cindy: he could have endplayed S for down 1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Harada has seen 2@d and 2@h tricks and that partner only has 3 @c, so how can he break the contract without 3 @s tricks?|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT with 11 + 11|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i say life is too short for anything|pg||
nt|bg: i need typing lessons|pg||
nt|thommos: you masterpoints may have more regulation than your banks :)|pg||

nt|idblu: MP's are so inflated anyways|pg||
nt|ralfwil: aha 6@sX!|pg||
nt|thommos: they got to high and needed spades breaking with K onside|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 20 was an 11-point opener as well ;)|pg||
nt|sharkey: i surmise odds against based on your comment?|pg||
nt|mpny: It is just style, not right or wrong. I would not open, but very few would not|pg||
nt|yo_yo: true Mike but it had a few more things going for it|pg||
nt|sharkey: true - think 11 pts ok with shape and suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: stemming the tide --- a push|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and i am betting at least one pair using it in this event|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could have drawn trumps and gone only one down but reasonably enough he tried to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if declarer held 3@H -- it is right, if only 2@H then 4@D and ruff-sluff doesn't help declarer -- well done|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes.  If you know what to do, letting partner who may not choose is a mistake.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Makes on 12.5% of the 4-1 @d breaks too (I think) so maybe better than 70%.|pg||

mb|1H!|an|4+|nt|ralfwil: As in the previous session I can recommend Kesleys books about defence...|pg||
nt|snorris: a lucky position in @cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Multi 2@D in OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: Appears EW in OR didnt have a defence prepared for Multi 2@D opening|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on W is OK|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|thommos: bank stocks, no longer inflated|pg||
nt|cindy: a beer costs 1/2 masterpoint|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@H doubled in open room|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C on any balanced hand outside 1nt range|pg||
nt|othered1: That's what I meant about north having count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to really learn the lesson about preventing partner from going wrong.  Hugh Kelsey's  "Killing Defense at Bridge"|pg||
nt|idblu: is E worth a call at this vul?|pg||
nt|santyclz: No, if @ds 4-1 needs 3-3@hs so only  6%.|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|panja: this should not be a difficult hand to bid...S shows his long suit, North asks Aces sometime...and that is all that is needed to bid 7|pg||
nt|snorris: dont think they will bid it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 11 point balanced then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually Joey Silver may still be playing it [with John Carruthers]|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: multi seems popular in the East|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @h for me|pg||
nt|snorris: but how to find it+|pg||
nt|snorris: ?|pg||
nt|panja: now...the self preempting effect of the big 2Nt bid comes into picture|pg||
nt|snorris: south will try to show @ds and slammish hand|pg||
nt|athene: double = 4+@S|pg||
nt|shevek: dbl shows 5@s I think|pg||
nt|xenya: at last an excellenet slam|pg||
nt|jaapfr: last 10 boards of nec 2009?|pg||

mb|2C!|an|15 17|nt|othered1: looks very normal so far|pg||
nt|othered1: But not optimal|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks as though 6 diamonds unlucky for EW here|pg||
nt|snorris: if n had the q of @s instead of q of @d this was the right defence|pg||
nt|sharkey: Precision here?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does that dbl show @S?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 3 spades might gum up the works|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@H and 6@C both make|pg||
nt|b_eymen: iki renkli|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: ki orda 12-14 acilmis 1nt galiba|pg||
nt|akgun: 1h 11-19 dengeli 4441|pg||
nt|akgun: 1s 6+ any|pg||
nt|akgun: 2c 15-17 dengeli|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: on 2 @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me - 2@s on S|pg||
nt|snorris: I mean instead of double|pg||
nt|sharkey: W's Dbl may get EW to 4@H perhaps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The reason is that if P has @h 3@h or even 4@h is OK|pg||
nt|sharkey: s's 2@H Pass or Correct?|pg||
nt|werge: After South passed his opening hand...|pg||
nt|panja: they may not have enough space to explore and rule out 3Nt, then ask for Aces|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It´s rather easy if S can find the @d 4-card support|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S just barely has a response....maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 10,5 losers.....|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: that doesnt have the appearance of an optimal OR result though|pg||
nt|cindy: im wondering when we can just send money to the acbl and they will credit our accounts with masterpoints|pg||
nt|sybarra: not with @d7|pg||
nt|idblu: a good call by Hackett|pg||
nt|xenya: however 4@H looks makeable too -- not as easy as 4@S of course|pg||
nt|athene: oh right - ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@S = 3@S |pg||
nt|wygbe1: if south had shot out 4h, they would surely be in slam - but after this start it could be difficult to reach|pg||
nt|xenya: no, Japp -- there will be another 16-board session i think|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ic tx|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think i would go straight to 3NT too|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 5-5|pg||
nt|akgun: 2s 2nt ye xfer|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|cindy: thats an ugly 1N   |pg||

nt|idblu: MP's are now attendance points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is who i meant|pg||
nt|fabsayc: after this is ducked, club queen next|pg||
nt|othered1: Don't knock 2-way Stayman (my preferred method).|pg||
nt|caitlin: night all:) enjoy|pg||
nt|othered1: bigtrain points out that more imps were available for making 3@C (my choice, too.)|pg||
nt|caitlin: early morning appt.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: in Open W rebid 2N here and E bid 3@D|pg||
nt|cindy: matter of style|pg||
nt|marlowepi: possibly system difference. i like 2S with 100 honors and no aces & suit-oriented hand|pg||
nt|snorris: seems so|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @d maybe orck?|pg||
nt|panja: looks like 4@D is interpreted as transfer by N|pg||
nt|snorris: then 4 @h is accept|pg||
nt|snorris: and 4 @s now a rkcb|pg||
nt|panja: South will try a precipitate jump to 6@D perhaps..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4nt will now solve all problems|pg||
nt|panja: seems like this is a misunderstanding issue..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well declarer may duck this|pg||
nt|snorris: trying...|pg||
nt|cindy: but hate to pass too|pg||
nt|mpny: looks to be|pg||
nt|sybarra: gn Caitlin:)|pg||
nt|shevek: minisplinter|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kibs advise 1@S = 0-3 @S|pg||
nt|athene: a splinter in diamonds won't excite west|pg||
nt|shevek: I don't like it much with stiff ace...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H is balanced raise|pg||
nt|othered1: nice for them to let east get her suit in without risk (3@S, limit, would be a different story)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In the other room North was given a chance to make 2NT - but 3NT looks hard on a heart lead|pg||

mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: even if i played 2S showed 6 i would still bid 2S|pg||
nt|bg: should have endplayed south  he had already showed five dia  4 hearts and two spades he club finesse was a waste of time|pg||
nt|snorris: the didnt rise to those hights|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11 pts balanced you know Kath - = 3 NT down:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup i would too but maybe be unlucky this time|pg||
nt|akgun: 3c stm olucak|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: whats wrong with 3@d|pg||
nt|cindy: N passed 2N in open room|pg||
nt|cindy: not sure why|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if that encourages @C shift?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south can give suit preference actually|pg||
nt|othered1: Ithought south might have played @H3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and perhaps NS had to find a club switch|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure W can handle it here either|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont hate to pass|pg||
nt|thommos: yes, looking at 7 clubs and 2 aces, hoping @D are ok|pg||
nt|cindy: my partner always has AJxxxxx|pg||
nt|idblu: however vulnerable you can expect this type of hand|pg||
nt|bg: see on slam they did lose an imp:))|pg||
nt|sharkey: This plays well view S has @CAx|pg||
nt|caitlin: hard to believe over 3N West bid 4@H on own AFTER telling partner once prior he had hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ME?  i've played 2-way Stayman -- and Montreal Relay for further distributional info - since mid 70s|pg||
nt|caitlin: I used to play 2 way stayman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but only when 1N=weak|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: with weak NT|pg||
nt|othered1: So you've had 30 years of good results with it?|pg||
nt|caitlin: moi?|pg||
nt|othered1: Meanwhile, declarer has his work cut out here.|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry not that old:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: I mean I am 30+ but not 30 years of bridge:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the good news for declarer - is that West holds SIX @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: -- and East has no entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who said @HJ and @CJ weren't worth a full 2 points :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and declarer has no tricks, so tell me how to make|pg||
nt|caitlin: 7 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CQ gets ducked -- then what does West do?|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't see any way for declarer to score this.|pg||
nt|santyclz: 8 tricks I think.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if ducked he can play ace and another if he wants|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at some point West making uncomfortable discard AND giving away another round [@C/@H] trick|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe a low @C would give declarer some chances, or maybe not.|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes 8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will delmonte be thinking of a @C slam?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the auction @HJ lead makes a lot of sense too|pg||
nt|othered1: 9 looks right, especially if they play odd-ranked leads|pg||
nt|idblu: all roads lead to 4 making|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which is why i prefer @HJ lead|pg||
nt|idblu: might lead to a pseudo uppercut on occasions|pg||
nt|wygbe1: tough bid by n, who can visualize slam opposite ak of h and 3 small clubs|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Defence will have to be careful|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer might get out for -1 but -2 is likely|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we all lead from Jxxx?|pg||
nt|josj: J9 is just acceptable|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope unless it works|pg||
nt|josj: J9xx|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: diger masada KG 12-14 ve 15-17 nt yi degisik oynuyor|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cindy: cant be missing vulnerable games|pg||
nt|werge: 1 NT is not my cup of tee - pass or 2 @c|pg||
nt|thommos: yes passing 1@S was an option|pg||
nt|ralfwil: on N, agree Hans|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming @HQ lead asks for unblock or count, there is small chance that East hold doubleton -- so my guess @HK continue|pg||
nt|b_eymen: hmm,|pg||
nt|akgun: 4h guneyden izliycez|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: maybe they stumble inti it|pg||
nt|snorris: into it|pg||
nt|bg: your first question Ed is valid how does south get to bid a nf 3clubs?|pg||
nt|othered1: I might lead J if I had supported.  Otherwise, count seems best since dummy's hand isn't at all specific, is it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not -- could be just as hard to read declarer's heart length|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 3 nt sorunsuz dogu batý için|pg||
mb|3H!|an|4lü|nt|wilkinsona: wests x here seems an improvement on the 3 clubs in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tada|pg||
nt|fabsayc: something wrong with this auction|pg||
nt|idblu: not really,  minimum w/long @S wants to play game|pg||
nt|josj: well, there we are|pg||
nt|roswolf: this can make i think|pg||
nt|b_eymen: cogu expert dbl la baslardý|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Yes - EW will be duly rewarded for their bidding|pg||
nt|snorris: getting some imps back|pg||
nt|snorris: 13 in fact|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S unblocks and N shifts to @D - still make?|pg||
nt|panja: operator, could you pl clarify the meanings of bids?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Can S have better cards? rise to 7|pg||
nt|snorris: easier if south opens 3 @d|pg||
nt|snorris: then it should be easy|pg||
nt|snorris: well done|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would pass with slight misgivings|pg||
nt|idblu: are they playing 2/1 or somehing else|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but looks like lack of intermediate spots will be the doom of declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: south has pointed suit pressure on east, but can't get the count right for a squeeze|pg||
nt|wygbe1: he went for the guess with the biggest payoff|pg||
nt|jaapfr: impressive gambling:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: educated quess |pg||
nt|akgun: diger masada tersten oynanacak|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cindy: it kinda describes your hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all's well that ends well|pg||
nt|mariner1: different routes however both rooms in 4@H here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: kinda|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree snorri. The only thing to find 7 is for N to check aces|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|werge: Because of the @S-bid, Souths hand was growing|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: every chance of beating -4 however|pg||
nt|idblu: other room did not do well either|pg||
nt|shevek: mainly because partner will construct hands with the ace somewhere else|pg||
nt|chessmaste: That looks like a fatal play - now declarer has a second spade trick |pg||
nt|b_eymen: en iyi atak|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: two suits  @s and @d  hmm|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am with Marshall here, prefer the slowing of 2@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as you say, matter of style. xom would rather emphasize major with 100 honors than a very broken minor. both approahes will have their successes|pg||
nt|snorris: but still lucky|pg||
nt|snorris: not loosing 3 @c tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: norths raise bold all the same|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..may have a tough decision yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club K seems like a better shot than small|pg||
nt|shevek: yet another flat board, just what Oz needs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so -- length showing probably IS best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep Ed - i'm convinced|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 9 tricks on top|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks without @s|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - miscounted :(|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and NOT @sJ?|pg||
nt|snorris: king for count?|pg||
nt|snorris: ace for unblock|pg||
nt|snorris: ?|pg||
nt|snorris: -2 at least|pg||
nt|b_eymen: gelene nt demek için|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: If S had bid 2@s W must bid 2nt  not D as partner then will go to 2@h|pg||
nt|irwinbo: spades plays better he will go down at least two|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: on the heart switch care needed I suppose|pg||
nt|idblu: @H now and a duck is a 2 undertrick  diff |pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like China going minus at both tables -- nice way for Japan to get off the schneid|pg||
nt|athene: ok - so N-S do indeed play upside down carding|pg||
nt|aruf: naturel oynayanlar 4 deklarede 4 @H oynayacaklar :) ama istem olunca böyle cilveleri oluyor|pg||
nt|eccone: ikilide yi olmazdý|pg||
nt|akgun: evet 4h std ancak yon fark edecek|pg||
nt|eccone: gerci natüreldede güney oynuyor|pg||
pc|cK|nt|b_eymen: @c|pg||
nt|b_eymen: yada k@h|pg||
nt|b_eymen: dbl þiddetine baglý :)|pg||
nt|eccone: 1 nt 2@c|pg||
nt|aruf: evet|pg||
nt|akgun: evet bu elde 15-17 oldugu icin sorun yok|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: hearts is declarer's second suit. W will let declarer look after them|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lets see, s has to lead a @c up for his 8th trick, I think that deprives him of a late @d entry.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder why Wang played A?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: did he lead 7?|pg||
nt|mpny: Paul need to play a D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: needs a @d switch|pg||
nt|idblu: has to hook|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: tam onu diyecektim ben de:)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|cindy: he can now|pg||
nt|mpny: well done|pg||
nt|shevek: real score again is 64 - 29|pg||
nt|ahollan1: overtake with @CK might have been interesting -- but south must always fall back upon @D finesse |pg||
nt|roswolf: with @D 3-3 japan have scored a real goal|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet. deklaran yeri gördüðünde "iyiki alttan almýþým" demiþtir|pg||
nt|b_eymen: :)|pg||
nt|akgun: ancak guney 4441 olsada yine guneyden olucakti|pg||
nt|eccone: sistemde dikkat edilmesi gereken  en önemli sey belli olan elin yere acýlmasý|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: East holds @C and West squeezed down to winners|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ralfwil: So I mean that 2@s is a better bid than 2@h|pg||
nt|santyclz: Low @c opening lead would have been fun.|pg||
nt|b_eymen: cakýlmassa 800|pg||
nt|b_eymen: bu plana göre cakýlacak|pg||
pc|dK|nt|idblu: but can get 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|idblu: better declarer play :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They found 4@S on 6 in OR|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sounds like a close your eyes and hope for the best - but with @C sa s trump a bit difficult to investigat scientifically|pg||
nt|wygbe1: he knew south would not be able to cooperate if slam were making|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 500de anlasirlar:)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|snorris: but that is good if he takes 5 tricks|pg||
nt|eccone: 4441 ilan edip o elin sahibi oynayýnca defansýn iþi baya kolay|pg||
nt|aruf: 2 fazlaya geldi|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: west might cash @SA now|pg||
nt|athene: south can't really have the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: but would north play a third heart with the singleton @SK, revealing the position?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chessmaste: 12 goals you will find|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 18 puan ama iþe yaramýyor|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wilkinsona: in OR EW could have passed out 2 spades xx|pg||
nt|b_eymen: @h 4-0 degilse batýda onör 2 li @c oluyo|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|othered1: rectifying the count for a squeeze that isn't there|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: just drifting one off it seems|pg||
nt|snorris: east will continue sp and hope for no q of @h in south|pg||
nt|snorris: ah... 7 of @c |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes could well do|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|idblu: ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope -- declarer going for the quick loss|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: ???|pg||
nt|snorris: natural |pg||
nt|idblu: not only that...it would beat the contract|pg||
pc|h9|nt|wilkinsona: so boldness pays|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she must have had a reason   |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|idblu: ?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: good evening cindy, spectators|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|snorris: that would be carnage..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: which may have been 1600 approx|pg||
nt|thommos: the A@S was a good play by West, ensures they take their tricks|pg||
nt|chessmaste: As a general rule aces should be used for bashing kings|pg||
nt|akgun: 4441 oldugunu acandan baska bilen yok ancak:)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sharkey: 13 IMPs to the Chinese Ladies - Match tied|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W cannot see the layout. down 1 will suit him just fine|pg||

pc|dT|nt|sybarra: yes|pg||

nt|cindy: hi :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, we dont know about the 2 diamonds, but if it shows either major, 2 spades is normal|pg||
nt|werge: 3 @d is stupid - a brave man opens 1 D|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|mariner1: EW can beat 4@S here....|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes though|pg||
nt|frankaus: poll for final contract & result - 4@S S +1 for me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fast pass and on to 25, which is more interesting|pg||
nt|cindy: looks like a pass out here too|pg||
nt|othered1: this they may be able to make.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But N found a nice endplay on W, so perhaps -1 IMP for the dutch|pg||
nt|athene: a good board here for australia|pg||
nt|idblu: tight bridge so far|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D-(2@C)-X?P|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: once again 3NT bites the dust in OR|pg||

nt|snorris: merry|pg||
nt|ralfwil: on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or 3NT|pg||
nt|snorris: thats better|pg||
nt|mpny: Kath, do you know what 1H is|pg||
nt|sharkey: @H to crowd the forcing @C action|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Paul wants to disrupt them |pg||
nt|mpny: it was alerted|pg||
nt|sharkey: think 3NT by E has chances|pg||
nt|werge: Might show red OR black suits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what price this ends in something doubled?|pg||
nt|sybarra: at least equal stealing |pg||
nt|athene: if north didn't open, you might miss game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finally -- confirmation of Precision|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have to go, enjoy all|pg||

mb|1S|nt|sharkey: may stop at part score here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west bound to upgrade after the 4 diamond splinter|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @h ?|pg||
nt|snorris: showing intermediate strength|pg||
nt|snorris: it seems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would not pass the N hand|pg||
nt|cindy: thats ugly 1@h|pg||
nt|idblu: love those 4 card majors...remind me of my younger days|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: of course that was never a danger :)|pg||
nt|idblu: see ya Martin, gn |pg||

mb|p|nt|snorris: they are going there too|pg||
nt|cindy: is this the real bidding ?|pg||
nt|cindy: im getting dizzy :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: better |pg||
nt|bg: good idea not to try for six maybe at match points and you are not playing with your spouse|pg||
nt|thommos: not for the lead!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you were right mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: trump lead...|pg||
mb|2C|nt|barbyh: do they play support dbls?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here 1D could be a winner though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it looks like it from that 2NT bid, barb|pg||
nt|barbyh: yes but hard to imagine 3nt with the south hand|pg||
nt|snorris: no good bid in north|pg||
nt|bg: thats better 2 clubs by East some system not yet written|pg||
nt|sybarra: now how they are not in 6 is beyond me |pg||
nt|cindy: how about keycard now |pg||
nt|sybarra: was some form of experimental ghestem maybe |pg||
nt|sybarra: meaning 6340 |pg||
nt|npcjpn: but south does not know about @d shortness...|pg||
nt|sybarra: or as a spec said,  an exclusion 2 suiter|pg||
nt|cindy: no but he knows N has 5 hearts and 4 clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: come on, bruce,  be creative|pg||
nt|bg: ok keycard then go for it:))|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was still talking about the (misentered) 2 @C bid|pg||
nt|snorris: flushed with sucsess north moves on|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you wont be able to overcall with this shape, so bid right away|pg||
nt|othered1: south stops to investigate, but now what?|pg||
nt|athene: playing Precision, south's 2@H response would be natural and constructive but non-forcing|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@H - 3 NT?|pg||
nt|athene: so she has to bid the artificial 2@D relay first then 3@H is forcing|pg||
nt|santyclz: Gn Martin.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|chessmaste: We should have a new leader soon|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i have sympathy with the 2@S bid in the other room, it's not a great suit|pg||
nt|eccone: 2@c davet olsa gerek|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: good lead it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not at all sure about 4|pg||
nt|snorris: what??|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, dont really follow the x|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how many down|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S opened 1@H in OR|pg||
nt|wygbe1: he was in a tough position, too strong for 4c, 5c would end the auction, and over 4s, how would south know how to continue?|pg||
nt|josj: N bid only 2 @S, thus S did not know about the extra trick coming from the 7th spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: not good |pg||
nt|irwinbo: no opening 2 diamond bid and no bid over two clubs|pg||
nt|santyclz: Bob Hamman has no problem with his rebid.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet most partnerships haven't discussed North's 3@C bid -- Natural and big hand without better bid both understandable interpretations|pg||
nt|santyclz: If 3nt is an option, bid it.|pg||
nt|othered1: I would not play it as natural|pg||
nt|othered1: but it's certainly reasonable to do so.|pg||
nt|caitlin: but I would still pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe not natural but surely something in suit, has many other options|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well -- especially with increase use of 1@C as 2+, i think Natural is very reasonable use|pg||
nt|othered1: North is worried about missing slam or a better minor suit game.  @S void is a concern.|pg||
nt|caitlin: oh I hate short club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have short diamond|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what were the results of the Dutch team?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: club shift needed?|pg||
nt|sharkey: well - dont think this was one of the alternatives we had in mind :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i never know what to do with East hand -- DBL is only way to play 33 @S fit|pg||
nt|josj: well, the suit is quite bad but that's not so interesting when you preempt|pg||
nt|chessmaste: True, but 3@S still looks an underbid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this time the K of trumps falls|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: which is not to be interpreted as approval of 2NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am told they do play support DBL's|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: is 4 spades not there..?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2D?|pg||
nt|idblu: declarer will have a lot to worry about here|pg||
nt|sybarra: but is the lead N got |pg||
nt|thommos: looks like a @D, @C and one in the wash to loose - making 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: make that hate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the more I see 1@C=2+ and transfer responses, the more i like it|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok - doesn't bother with showing hearts|pg||
nt|othered1: if I bid east's hand that way, partner would correct to 2@S with 3-1-6-3|pg||
nt|idblu: win @C and @S switch kills this hand|pg||
nt|eccone: iyi durdular :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: I think Frank will owe us a beer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S is a very conservative action|pg||
nt|frankaus: first leg in but looks unlikely to make +1|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 imps if south cashes out|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer can gain an imp by taking 7 tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes 4 hearts not a bad contract really|pg||
nt|othered1: and 5@D isn't a bad spot at all|pg||
nt|athene: easy to make ten tricks here without the clubs|pg||
nt|shevek:  China Women's Team lost the World Championship Final 222-223 to England last year|pg||
nt|athene: @D9 and @h10 both work hard for you|pg||
nt|sharkey: and EW can only cash 2 @C tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra2: where are "we" headed,  5 @C?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @HJ:)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: it has been pointed out by kibitzer that if you are going to bid 6c, you might as well bid 4nt on the way to confirm you are not off two aces - if 4nt is blackwood|pg||
nt|xenya: concealing the @H suit has worked out quite well for declarer -- she gets a very helpful lead|pg||
pc|d8|nt|snorris: 2 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some may have bid 3@S with East's hand|pg||
nt|cindy: i cant see em staying out of at least a small slam here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not even a try!|pg||
nt|santyclz: If pd's 1@d showed @ds, I'd pass with e.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good kib:)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S cold if S reads this as singleton|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence requires care..|pg||
nt|othered1: That may have been a helpful lead.  Now NS need to be careful|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I think north has done fine so far|pg||
nt|othered1: Do NS lead A from AK?|pg||
nt|idblu: is worrying about @H ruffs|pg||
nt|cindy: looks that way to me too|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's that defence called?  to the strong club?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The Unsuccessful Defence|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this is not a good advert for it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Suicide defence?|pg||
nt|caitlin: same score|pg||
nt|othered1: Stayman auction touted west away from her @D.|pg||
nt|geller: looks like 3nt is an easy make here.  should be flat.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely she will win in North & finesse @H|pg||
nt|sybarra2: suggested it will be 6 @D|pg||
nt|idblu: can anyone explain the auction :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: it actually looks like a puppet minor suit auction |pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: redble|pg||
nt|bg: 3nt N ? how about 3 hearts or 4 dia isnt it cue bid time?|pg||
nt|snorris: 10 tricks withright wivev in @cs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: as kib says just make 2 clubs|pg||
nt|snorris: not trying to play on @ss|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t know their system, but couldn´t W have bis 3@h after the transfer?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then 1@D=4+ and some say guarantees unbal -- huge advantage in later and competitive auctions|pg||
nt|caitlin: maybe not|pg||
nt|caitlin: if 1@D promises unbalanced then I understand short club|pg||
nt|caitlin: but many play it to play it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why would length of opener's @D affect your choice?|pg||
nt|othered1: Isn't pass possible on east's hand?  And mightn't north double 2@H?  East is lucky this hasn't become a disaster|pg||
nt|santyclz: I believe in letting the opps play misfits.  I have nothing against letting them play in @cs, and can bid 2@h if pd x's.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: bingo|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|h6|nt|snorris: this is not more than 3 down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4 down after a @d ruff and trumpd return|pg||
nt|snorris: well yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart ruff is hard to find|pg||
nt|werge: 30 years ago in Denmark it was called Robinson|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a good name yes :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play a new convention because it's sexy -- bah    MUST understand the ramifications on other auctions to adopt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: Not the lead, West expexted - but hoped for|pg||
nt|athene: there might even be 11 tricks if east gets squeezed|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 1nt 2 nt gibi partskorlara pasif atatklar en ideali|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: ooo|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: should be in 7 shortly at this table |pg||
nt|cindy: do you start slam cue bidding at the 3 level ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree and that was sexy Al:)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, easy 10 tricks it seems|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: diger masadan sok bir el daha geldi|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|snorris: 8 tricks|pg||
nt|irwinbo: yes or 1 diamond if that is to your taste|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be some form of CRASH - this time the did...|pg||
nt|werge: 500...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Ed -- Pass probably best -- but so tempting to DBL and hope 2@S finds a 7 card fit|pg||
nt|sybarra2: so it is 6 @c |pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharkey: 3 IOMPs now|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: IMPs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: anyone for a x on the west hand?|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 5@c?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lots of cards right for declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: This is a pretty friendly hand for NS, despite the @DQ in the weaker hand|pg||
nt|idblu: only has to find the @DJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Didn't find the @h lead.|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 2@s pass pass pass gitti|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: board 7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: win in hand, hook heart, discard club, then scissors in hearts|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: In OR East only raised to 3 hearts, so didnt look near six, but after the 4d west looks ideal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer thinking -- those pesky minor suit quacks |pg||
nt|werge: Claim, pls|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bg: I play 2c is GF therefor e3 dia starts a cue bid series aces-kings- N is not cooperating singletons|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if you play a strong club you just love boards like this |pg||
nt|xenya: a@S lead, for exampple/ would have defeated the contract easily |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but twop trump lsoers anyway|pg||
nt|thommos: maybe should of played A the Q@D|pg||
nt|idblu: has @D's to ruff, @S's to finesse....|pg||
nt|cindy: can he do it all ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: lot of work |pg||
nt|thommos: only 3 trumps, not always right|pg||
nt|othered1: this will present no problems at all, when @D break revealed.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mariner1: now a couple of ruffs|pg||
nt|snorris: ok if he can manage 6 tricks as e-w have 3 @d|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: but now, with a well placed @sK and 3@d from P|pg||
nt|sybarra2: same contract other table with W as declarer and @H lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cindy: i play 3@d is just forcing and could be trying to get to 3N or could be slam interest|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 nt  grandslam force or josephine as it used to be called|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, sorry|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|snorris: agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: shou;d mark the @C  finesse also |pg||
pc|h2|nt|b_eymen: ilginç|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|wilkinsona: your partners wjo must be as bad as mine..|pg||
nt|othered1: west may be considering that the @DK is onside|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I would love defending this|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: J109XX - J108XX AKX ile 2sp acisi da riskli|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: nafiz abilerin bazen bunlarla 1sp actiklarini biliyorum|pg||
nt|b_eymen: sisteme baglý kalmak lazým|pg||
nt|b_eymen: bukadar cýkmaz|pg||
pc|hA|nt|snorris: but he wont|pg||
nt|sybarra: terrible trump split here (just kidding)|pg||
nt|cindy: way to go Israel   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: is smooth duck any better?|pg||
nt|othered1: it's opposite a limited opening -- partner will act again if it's your hand most of the time.|pg||
nt|eccone: 130|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib suggests Lobotomy Defence...|pg||
nt|xenya: not that she is going to make it now it seems|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mariner1: in Open NS ended in 5@D|pg||
nt|snorris: do it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes would explain this line|pg||

nt|barbyh: best result wd be 2 cl dbld|pg||
nt|barbyh: support dbls have their disadvantages|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right--but how many times do we get to execute a scissors coup?|pg||
nt|barbyh: there is a trend nothing makes|pg||
nt|frankaus: my father was a tailor he had coups with scissors all the time :)|pg||
nt|barbyh: this looks good for 4 sp|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D was also -50 so board 8 was a push|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will S make a TO double?|pg||
nt|barbyh: doesnt matter|pg||

nt|marlowepi: but it matters to me. i have a huge bet in vegas|pg||
nt|mariner1: Marshall planning to buy a trip to the moon? :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a big debate as to which suit north should open|pg||
nt|cindy: this looks a little more interesting|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can be a blind spot not to think of that|pg||
nt|othered1: count was known by show-out|pg||
nt|cindy: they needed that|pg||
nt|snorris: more imps..|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Mike - sometimes it backfires|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so the Chinese ladies are teaching the men a lesson here :)|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H (all pass)?|pg||
nt|shevek: EW certainly found the best spot in the OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: she listened Nicoleta|pg||
nt|shevek: :)|pg||
nt|athene: the australian N-S pair made things hard for the Chinese in the other room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a weak 2 in 3rd seat  or do the ladies play multi?|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can sacrifice in 5@H|pg||
nt|idblu: silence is golden occasionally|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and didnt in the other room it appears|pg||
nt|josj: 1 overtrick in spite of misguessing @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: the australians might well bid slam here hoping to recoup some losses|pg||

nt|cindy: true|pg||
nt|snorris: 5 @hs sacrifice on adverse vuln|pg||
nt|snorris: predicting 4 @s -1 on this one|pg||
nt|snorris: no not after 2 @ds|pg||
nt|panja: this is an interesting hand...4@S could make if played carefully..|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @c or 3@d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and even with 3-1 in @h you will make 10 tricks. (no entry on N)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another 3nt on EW?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal, either 17+ or 18+ bal depending upon 1N range|pg||
nt|othered1: @C systems sometimes have problems with 3-suiters|pg||

nt|ahollan1: my bet RDBL=5-8 bal|pg||
nt|idblu: n/s going to bid @H's all the way up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe ANY 5-18|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5-8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've never seen DBL of strong @C used to show single-suited hand|pg||
nt|idblu: this looks like the place|pg||
nt|othered1: I have, but not a specific suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: SuperCRaSh can, some reverse the x and 1nt bids.|pg||
nt|idblu: in 6@S will have to guess the doubleton A@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't get it -- doesn't help partner compete, doesn't have ANY preemptive value|pg||
nt|sybarra2: yes|pg||

nt|akgun: 2h 4+any|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|thommos: but not if @S were 6-1|pg||
nt|othered1: I like this pass less than the earlier all Q 6-c ount|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another 5530 hand -- just like the god of probability to tease us this way|pg||
nt|bg: Club ace is best holding nat trump trick|pg||
nt|othered1: this will work out for EW, as west will win and play @C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i agree, spade is shot in dark also|pg||
nt|othered1: If this were presented as "what was the one card you could lead to let them make it?" @CA might get lots of votes|pg||

nt|werge: 1 @S...???|pg||
nt|mpny: Malinowski - Bakshi probably think they are ahead|pg||
nt|athene: hard to bid 5 over 5 when neither player has a stiff in opps' suit|pg||

nt|mcarroll: yes|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: pretty good books as well|pg||
nt|snorris: very good|pg||
nt|snorris: no double.. well|pg||
nt|cindy: 3@s there would ask for @h stop right ?|pg||
nt|cindy: but thats dangerous because gives them a chance to dbl for spade lead|pg||
nt|idblu: S doesn't want to push them to 6@S|pg||
nt|sybarra2: if the play is accurate|pg||
nt|chessmaste: If declarer makes this we will have a tie|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: why did he give em fielders choice|pg||
nt|idblu: I like 1@H|pg||
nt|cindy: i just cant stand to distort shape   im a broken record|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there are no 58 foot snakes in this game|pg||
nt|snorris: now!!|pg||
nt|sharkey: only has 7 of them :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: NV|pg||
nt|cindy: chance for small gain here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he is one of my favourites|pg||
nt|snorris: with 5 tricks in @s + ace..|pg||
nt|werge: I  repeat - what is 1 @S?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, with this shape and poor spade spots|pg||
nt|irwinbo: is that a three spade bid  for all of you?|pg||
nt|thommos: I tend to bid my stoppers|pg||
nt|idblu: I would assume...bid the one u have|pg||
nt|othered1: Mustn't east overtake?|pg||
nt|othered1: no, guess it's safe|pg||
nt|bg: he should K cannot be a tripeton|pg||
nt|bg: ripleton|pg||
nt|bg: tripleton:))|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3rd time's a charm|pg||
nt|bg: starting typing course next wek|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I like ripleton|pg||
nt|bg: week|pg||
nt|othered1: west is thinking that east might be the one void in @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: well - the fast lane|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if 3@H-DBL  would have been takeout or balanced hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Gn Shirley.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: gn Santy and all |pg||
nt|sybarra2: these long days are killing me |pg||
nt|b_eymen: oyun gücleri yok|pg||
nt|b_eymen: minör gelirse önüne onu uyandýrýrdý|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: ben katilmiyorum buna|pg||
mb|3N|nt|snorris: not a bid of your liking.. mine neither|pg||
nt|idblu: not I...2 1/2 @S here|pg||
nt|cindy: 1/2 trick short for me   but i dont hate it|pg||
nt|idblu: don't hate it...but NV I go for the 2@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am heading out (actually to bed)  breakfast meeting not my thing,  so early day tomorrow |pg||
nt|cindy: i right behind you shirley|pg||
nt|cindy: that didnt sound right|pg||
nt|sybarra: Ed can do the job for both of us :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Bye Shirley!|pg||
nt|othered1: Bye, Cindy!|pg||
nt|sybarra: gn guys,  cu tomorrow |pg||
nt|cindy: night shirley :)|pg||
nt|thommos: Bye Shirley and Cindy|pg||
nt|idblu: gn Shirley :) sleep well|pg||
nt|cindy: night everyone :)    |pg||
nt|bg: nite Shirley|pg||
nt|idblu: gn Cindy :)|pg||
nt|thommos: Only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: View pd's 15-17 NT think west's pass too conservative|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thats pardonable - jet lag|pg||
nt|werge: Depends on the @s-suit behaving|pg||
nt|athene: it does look a bit aggressive :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: exciting|pg||
nt|josj: with @H 3-3, she might|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder why no 1NT rebid bye east|pg||
nt|b_eymen: :)|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: :)|pg||
nt|b_eymen: zon durumu tehlikeli|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: http://clubs.vugraph.com/tbricfed/teams_event.php?event=172&stage=368 sonuçlarla ilgili adres /link/url|pg||
nt|b_eymen: bence katýl|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: depends whose side youre on|pg||
nt|idblu: and no time to find a 9th|pg||
nt|thommos: a light opener by S Fav in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agree -- Precision players do Pass many more 6 counts than others, but this hand has so much potential if partner has @H -- and 2@S rebid is easy otherwise|pg||
nt|othered1: nice non-double by south|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess I missed that.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c needs a 3-3- split in @s but it is so|pg||
nt|wygbe1: strange to have a bidding misunderstanding on this rather common sequence|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N will not be pleased|pg||
nt|xenya: some misunderstanding no doubt|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: farkindayim ama gencim iste cok:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: ya gotta bid @d b4 they bid 4@s|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like international dialling |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: maybe has some spades mixed up with his hearts|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well 4 hearts may be close|pg||
nt|snorris: -2 at least|pg||
nt|snorris: so why not double in south|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @d is -2 too|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT could easily be a make and |pg||
nt|ralfwil: low @h pls|pg||
nt|santyclz: Undid, to x.|pg||
nt|othered1: Doesn't this make?|pg||
nt|caitlin: with KQTx in a major, I see no reason for S to pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: uppercut to beat still|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Caitlan -- even playing precision we think 1N is automatic|pg||
nt|othered1: really?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I must be missing something, I don't see how to beat it.|pg||
nt|othered1: nor do I|pg||
nt|fabsayc: three rounds of clubs, then what?|pg||
nt|othered1: low @D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course, 1N will probably kill the chance for South to enter  -790|pg||
nt|othered1: you do want to start @H low from hand, no?|pg||
nt|othered1: given the double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so low diamond to king?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fly @SA, 3 rounds of @C, @D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't pull trump at all|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D at most for me, given the vul :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: big number|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is what i call "justice being served in an unjust way". when you make a bid like 2NT, you are BEGGING the universe to find a creative way to punish you|pg||
nt|sharkey: it was a mundane 4@S but I hadn't counted on N not bidding...|pg||
nt|snorris: or as I sometimes do divide them in two stacks!!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the turn of NS to win the auction|pg||
nt|akgun: 9 love kolay|pg||
nt|eccone: EWET|pg||
nt|eccone: güneyde 5 li@s olmadýgý biliniyormu?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|chessmaste: You often find on a 4-3 fit that leaving trumps alone is best|pg||
nt|josj: yes, let the opps do your work|pg||
nt|josj: good idea by all means...|pg||
nt|b_eymen: farkýndayým |pg||
nt|akgun: bilinmiyor|pg||
nt|eccone: iyi atak|pg||
nt|eccone: pik|pg||
nt|eccone: ortaga cýkma mantýklý batýnýn eliyle|pg||
nt|akgun: 5s 2h olsa 3s derdi sanirim|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cindy: i like it better than dbl|pg||
nt|frankaus: 1100 our access numbet for intrnational calls|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb: for whom?|pg||
nt|bg: 9 tricks next|pg||
nt|sharkey: I must admit I wud have raised on the W hand|pg||
nt|eccone: öyle olmalý tabi|pg||
nt|eccone: kuzzeyin körü 6 lýysa|pg||
nt|eccone: 4@d mu dder bidaha|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|othered1: push.  7 to go|pg||
nt|werge: Show-up squeeze against Souht now |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@D is pushing it for me|pg||
nt|akgun: orasi ufo:)|pg||
nt|eccone: :)|pg||
nt|eccone: karýsýk buralar|pg||
nt|eccone: kritik|pg||
nt|eccone: :)|pg||
nt|akgun: hemde ne:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: I wudnt have considered either VUL i think|pg||
nt|athene: it will have gone something like P P P 2@C 2@D 3@C 3@D 3@S 4@D perhaps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no i take that back, even 2@D is out for me|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wilkinsona: this gives the defence a chance|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Here is one of the reasons that I prefer to bid as soon as possible. Not balancing|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: likely x was take out|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm not sure taking the @s finesse is right, but it certainly makes the hand easier to play.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cindy: israek|pg||
nt|snorris: maybe|pg||
nt|bg: parties parties if I dont get to bed early I'm going home|pg||
nt|sybarra2: gn all |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not taken that chance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the real question is....how often if you bid only 2S will pd pass & u miss a game u wanna be in. not vulnerable that is a bigger risk|pg||
nt|irwinbo: but in precision, if you don't open one club, it is an easy 3s bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: just seems on the finesse really|pg||
nt|idblu: and the @C for 1 loser|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Declarer already has a clue - the first two tricks|pg||
nt|eccone: þimdi @s in 3-3 oldugu belli oldu|pg||
pc|hA|nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|shevek: it might happen that Ish lost his patience|pg||
nt|yo_yo: presumably delmonte has had some success with such bids in the past|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or he wouldnt be where he is today|pg||
nt|athene: i would bet large amounts he didn't open 5@D :)|pg||
nt|shevek: he is a very fast player and I think the tempo of the match didn't suit him|pg||
nt|yo_yo: operator can you confirm the bidding please|pg||
nt|sharkey: must have - especially since W didnt consider raising|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so you think he lost his rag because of the bidding?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: because of the slow play?|pg||
nt|sharkey: perhaps Operator only inserted the final bid?|pg||
nt|athene: there are lots of plausible auctions ending in 5@D by east|pg||
nt|b_eymen: q@s|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cindy: israel|pg||
nt|ralfwil: He didn´t herar me. He is far away from me and the window closed|pg||
nt|santyclz: As PO Sundelin says, you can't beat it, but that doesn't mean declarer will make it.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: are we allowed to say "rag" in England?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: luckily they are not vul, so will only cost about 6 imps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|frankaus: *number|pg||
nt|fabsayc: suit preference spade lead|pg||
nt|thommos: squeeze is now possible|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hear..|pg||
nt|athene: only on fridays|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Prince Harry got ticked off  for  that word|pg||
nt|shevek: Friday the 13|pg||
nt|athene: he is hoping for a trump endplay against south|pg||
nt|athene: but there's no chance|pg||
nt|athene: south has two trump tricks and that's the end of it :)|pg||
nt|athene: he would need to find south with four spades and the last club; then he could perhaps ruff club, cash three spades, ruff spade, then exit with @D9|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think the actual bidding may have been something along the lines you outlined earlier Will|pg||
nt|xenya: which is strange |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sharkey: Agree - and here N had FOUR chances to bid|pg||
nt|idblu: had to throw a @S from dummy|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|cindy: there are many excellent players on both sides of the argument|pg||
nt|sharkey: i've been informed the NT range of the Chainese pair is 14-16|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: I looked away and Marshall places a new bet to the moon here :)|pg||
nt|idblu: nice def....|pg||
nt|snorris: or must be|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe -- it can't be beat, but it may go down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- great result for Japan in Open Room|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: should we mention that spoades have to break?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe mariner's protege+|pg||
nt|cindy: hee hee |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, ok not so great, but there has been worse|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now he can see the problem with winning the first @h!|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The heart was a mistake I think - she may go down now|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should go off i think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: maybe better to get rid of dummy's last spade on the diamonds|pg||
nt|b_eymen: @h|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: and lest we forget -- that's one heck of a 3@H bid from West - opposite passed partner and with suspect @DQ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: but north's club is a major disappointment|pg||
nt|santyclz: @da opening lead.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: back on track now|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|idblu: end of the road tho |pg||
nt|cindy: i used to have a protege|pg||
nt|othered1: nothing really available at any point beyond 8 tricks (famous last words)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now has to play @s|pg||
nt|idblu: pressed the easy button|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from auction - should guess South to hold doubleton @DA anyway|pg||
nt|idblu: seems the only play...should get it right|pg||
nt|roswolf: really that cant be right|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Now she is back in business|pg||
nt|akgun: kor damdan sonra clm +1 |pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: ??|pg||
nt|ralfwil: vety bad|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that was a bit odd|pg||
nt|sharkey: was that correcundo?|pg||
nt|xenya: not necessarily -- Jx would do, also  you might get some count on the defender's hands  |pg||
pc|d4|nt|idblu: has no way to reach the @CJ even if he guessed it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I had tried 3@h on E over D|pg||
nt|thommos: Has to ruff last club and pick the @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: undo?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|wilkinsona: and one chance to defeat this contract|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer plating well to hold this to -2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but sould have ruffed a @h before @d|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i seem to remember that delmonte isnt as cool, calm and collected as some |pg||
nt|idblu: tight game, once again|pg||
nt|santyclz: Makes 7 if she plays for 3-2 @hs, but guarentees the contract this way.|pg||

nt|sharkey: well - nothing boring here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion it´s much more difficult to read a position after balancing than a stright forward bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another 4@s|pg||
nt|snorris: more 4 @s|pg||
nt|cindy: hi henry|pg||
nt|henryb: Hi Cindy|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @s e-w?|pg||
nt|snorris: difficult|pg||
nt|thommos: 58 imps traded on 8 boards played|pg||
nt|mpny: When Hanlon was in with the SA it could no longer be beaten|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thanks!|pg||
nt|bg: spec quotes a Joey "next"|pg||
nt|sybarra: and mr. "next" is in the OR |pg||
nt|werge: But @H-intermediates have gone, small @h is ok for 12th trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10 boards and 9 games and one slam!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes - no mere partscores for this computer|pg||
nt|xenya: and yet another game for NS here -- admittedly a lucky one|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only on a @c finess, so I have seen worse|pg||
nt|xenya: but perfectly reasonable of course |pg||
nt|xenya: true Ralf|pg||
nt|xenya: there are some communication problems though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right - only chance is for somebody to hold doubleton @DA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another uncomfortable hand for Precision|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nicely done Liu|pg||
nt|roswolf: 7 board match now|pg||
nt|b_eymen: sorunsuz bi el daha|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mariner1: 2@D did play well in Open here.......|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@S and E used forcing NT probably planning to pass and 2 level call W made|pg||
nt|cindy: what does S bid after 1D 2C ?|pg||
nt|snorris: this might be difficult|pg||
nt|snorris: after 3@c what to bid in north?|pg||
nt|panja: E's 2!M opening isn't very mush weaker than some of his 1 openings..|pg||
nt|panja: 2@D even|pg||
nt|panja: still, should S overcall 2Nt or 3@C? or pass?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: slammy perhaps|pg||
nt|thommos: yes, but maybe West could of played a @S earlier|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like a 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the initial romp is now just an 8 imp difference|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer can't draw all trumps before taking the finesse|pg||
nt|athene: another 24 count 3nt for N-S here, the same as a momet ago|pg||
nt|athene: *moment|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ugly 6@cs, with 1 redeaming feature.|pg||

nt|eccone: dogru|pg||
mb|1N|nt|thommos: yes |pg||
nt|othered1: multi on a bad 7-bagger|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless playing relays - East rarely gets to show both minors|pg||
nt|xenya: as the auction hadn't been too complicated up to that point|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@H|pg||
nt|idblu: 3@c|pg||
nt|idblu: THEN !3@s, 3@h|pg||
nt|snorris: now..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I have placed one @c among the @h and will bid 2nt|pg||
nt|panja: and a real problem for North|pg||
nt|othered1: Here, too, north with a strong balanced hand will h ave auction ahead of him|pg||
nt|snorris: very nice slam on few points|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4 or 5@d for me on N|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or 1NT|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|irwinbo: only 19 imps in 8 boards  action yet to come|pg||

nt|eccone: 2@h|pg||
nt|akgun: 4d mi diyecek|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: why ugly -- isn't it just @SK in the slot?|pg||
nt|idblu: will most likely play 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html  - Tournament site|pg||
nt|cindy: thats a suit you want led|pg||
nt|idblu: 3n|pg||
nt|snorris: two 11 counts passing..|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree - much easier for S then|pg||
nt|snorris: got it right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no sound bid|pg||
nt|othered1: There is a case for staying out, but east doesn't have sound opening tendencies (see board 5)|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @h n-s is more natural|pg||
nt|ralfwil: at least 2@d 1 @c and a trumph in a @s contract|pg||
nt|werge: Can we stop in 6 now...|pg||
nt|snorris: 5 @d a voidwood?|pg||
nt|werge: 6 @H is a good practical bid from West now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If W bids 4@s and E 5@c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer the scientific way by cuebids|pg||
nt|sharkey: Rite now the Chinese women can't do wrong it looks like|pg||
nt|othered1: Japan Open has come back quickly. But this dull board will slow things down.|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@S positive in @H, but not @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 sp usually says,  I have a better hand if your suit is @H's|pg||
nt|werge: This is not only on a @C-finesse - you can only handle 3-3 in @C og West being shorter than that - WITH the K|pg||
nt|sharkey: @S lead may set this|pg||
nt|athene: yes, it's not totally trivial to bid and make game here|pg||
nt|b_eymen: bu elleri 2@cle baslamak|pg||
nt|b_eymen: seviyenin assagýdan ilerlemesi icin daha iyi|pg||
nt|eccone: 4@h aaz olur|pg||
mb|2S|nt|thommos: also 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+|pg||
nt|bg: I like using 2 dia as a weak weak major then it is possible to use 2H/S as reasonable suits|pg||
nt|othered1: that's an attractive style|pg||
nt|eccone: ama simdi tam el tarifi olur|pg||
nt|eccone: 4@h|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cindy:  (not)|pg||
nt|barbyh: thats pushing it a bit|pg||
nt|othered1: I think 2@S is *very* aggressive|pg||
nt|snorris: but awful lie in @h|pg||
nt|snorris: the science prewail|pg||
nt|werge: This 3 NT looks solid - but might get trouble with @H 5-3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Paul wont let this go|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pass?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N is 1 round force|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: -5 |pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: 2nt is off my chart|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 3NT shows 5@h.|pg||
nt|cindy: what lead do you like here henry ?|pg||
nt|josj: NT does not play well as N has no entries|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: ok tesekkurler|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Im not sure about that... EW produced a non forcing sequence after a strong club.. partner was marked with some goodies|pg||
nt|sharkey: I agree with East's pass - opened in OR|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well stay low it seems|pg||
nt|snorris: no such hights in the bidding;)|pg||
nt|idblu: 3N  by E best|pg||
nt|mpny: this will be flat|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - I was sleeping...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Need to ruff @d too, breaks an issue.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=17-19 or 18-?  again depending upon range of 1N opener [14-16 or 15-17]|pg||
nt|idblu: looks like a relay sys|pg||

nt|b_eymen: tek yok yane|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: he told em what to lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Does partner know you're bidding on "the Law" alone?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure is and may catch a raise|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess he does.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Good point|pg||
nt|josj: even on a trump lead, this is easy|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: iste bu 5li major olmayan multi oynayan bir cift:)|pg||
nt|akgun: batý karismadam edemedi|pg||
nt|eccone: 6@s bi tek @c atagýna batardý|pg||
nt|deniz_t: herkese selamlar ne mutlu bizlere ki, hep beraber canlý yayýndayýz:)|pg||
nt|eccone: dogu @c @h sqz olurdu|pg||
nt|eccone: batý cýkuyomus zaten|pg||
nt|eccone: hicoluru yok :)|pg||
nt|eccone: selamlar|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: not sure I would agree with 2N here on a 14 count|pg||
nt|cindy: uhh...what about 1S|pg||
nt|idblu: me too...|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11 points and 4333 is not my favorite|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but EW pushed to 3 diamonds which may be -1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well double by south presumably    t|pg||
nt|fabsayc: takeout, still very strange|pg||
nt|thommos: with @C 3-3 , should be easy|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud be... |pg||
nt|ralfwil: needs only 4-2 or 3-3 in @c and K on side|pg||
nt|werge: Blind spot, but interesting...|pg||
nt|sharkey: But East has to disregards pd's overcall|pg||
nt|athene: west just has to find the spade lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Sry - W on lead|pg||
nt|athene: not impossible with no raise from partner|pg||
nt|athene: but with two entries in diamonds, it looks normal to try to establish your suit rather than partner's|pg||
nt|sharkey: E on lead in OR leading pd's suit|pg||
nt|shevek: can't see making it on any lead|pg||
nt|athene: true, even on a heart lead, west has time to switch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just a delayed Stayman auction|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cindy: yeh   i dont like any of the choices really|pg||
nt|idblu: no reason to distort the hand|pg||
nt|cindy: i dislike 3C the least|pg||
nt|bg: Ace Dia:))|pg||
nt|cindy: does A ask for attitude or count here for n/s|pg||
nt|henryb: whatever @d honor asks for attitude|pg||
nt|cindy: must ask for attitude|pg||
nt|werge: I repeat: 6 @H is...|pg||
nt|snorris: didnt work very well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5C probably best spot but 3NT makes easily|pg||
nt|thommos: and the @D lead|pg||
nt|shevek: my bet is 12 imps to Oz :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW misdefended OR - E covered when @S lead from W|pg||
nt|sharkey: giving NS 3 @S stoppers|pg||
nt|sharkey: gd lead - top of nothing|pg||
nt|athene: east can happily duck the @SQ - that can't cost|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the Aussies wont like being beaten be a team of "sheilas"  will they?|pg||
nt|shevek: north played it on a @h lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: more difficult to defend in OR as QJx concealed in N's hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: should East cover?|pg||
nt|sharkey: can't see why|pg||
nt|sharkey: just encourage|pg||
nt|athene: the only reason you might cover here is if you don't want declarer in dummy |pg||
nt|athene: but the normal play is to duck|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am told it was covered in the other room|pg||
nt|sharkey: N played the hand in OR making it harder not to cover|pg||
nt|josj: maybe best for E is to duck @DK|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: playing devil's advocate, 2NT is a better bid than 5NT|pg||
nt|cindy: i like 1N better than 1@s|pg||
nt|panja: I guess @S finesse next..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N has to finess over E to keep entrancen to table|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well i dont go along with that|pg||
nt|werge: I vote for 140 - I know Paul!|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am informed by a spec that the chinese ladies would win the split tie|pg||
nt|chessmaste: +170 will give Japan a 1IMP cushion|pg||
nt|josj: but then a cross-ruff will result|pg||
pc|c2|nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok -- still bad glasses -- 12 imp difference   [mea maxima culpa]|pg||
nt|othered1: They are in 2@S in the open room.  The non-prremptor bought the hand a level lower there|pg||
nt|twcho: this bd was one played in the semi between Australia and China Ladies|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like 7 tricks when @S break favorably|pg||
nt|cindy: was gonna say    pretty good hand to be passing 3N|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nice lead for NS|pg||
nt|sharkey: a small pick up for the Hacketts perhaps|pg||
nt|bg: continue clubs let dclarer end for himself|pg||
nt|idblu: E certainly doesn't have a 1NT call with a stiff @H|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: wow!|pg||
nt|idblu: unless 1@D = @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: apparently the team finishing ahead in the Swiss is awarded 0.5 imp|pg||
nt|josj: in Beijing standards, that would be a healthy lead...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that seems an odd rule|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|snorris: good duck|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I cannot understand 5@h!  it´s obvious to bid 5@c|pg||
nt|idblu: not so loud Marshal|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Liu has a horrible choice of leads there though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or only 2 trumps on the short @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as mentioned  tough hand to bid in Precision -- She chose to call it Balanced rather than clumsy 2@C rebid|pg||
nt|xenya: but this one is easy|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they mustn't allow extra boards to be played|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: interesting choice back|pg||
nt|cindy: uhoh|pg||
nt|cindy: he's thinking  :(|pg||
nt|idblu: can't move...no @S cuebid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N is NOT a standard Precision response -- with good 5 card suit and game forcing hand [8+ HCP] normal response is 2@C|pg||
nt|caitlin: flat board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the rest of the auction does look Stayman-ish, which is standard precision|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably deciding hat diamond to return|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what|pg||
nt|sybarra: guys,  I have an early day also,....going to have to say good night |pg||
nt|fabsayc: gn shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: midnight approaching here,   and the pumpkin coach is waitnng|pg||
nt|sybarra: gn all |pg||
nt|ralfwil: needs nothing more.....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope   1@C=strong  1@D=neg|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 2@d majörler diye alert edilmedi mi?|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: majorler diil ki|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|idblu: over 3@C pard bids 3N if all stopped, or the suit he has|pg||
nt|snorris: 7 tricks as they did in the open room|pg||
nt|idblu: 8 on top...9th to follow in @C's|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bg: bravo just picked up 3 imps|pg||
nt|henryb: now 9 winners in aces and kings|pg||
nt|sharkey: The lead didnt hurt Hans|pg||
nt|idblu: thats taking a view...but I can't argue with success:)|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: zayif 1major ya da 19-22 dengeli 5li major yok|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|santyclz: Unless 1nt was a xfer to @cs.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: lead certainly helps!|pg||
nt|idblu: worried that if the @S hook loses they can take 4 @H tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for both other Chinese Pairs -- the 1N rebid is 18-19 bal/semi-bal|pg||
nt|idblu: i'll bet N played small and E is tanking  nnow|pg||
nt|josj: we have no time for that here as the next match will start shortly :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|snorris: in the defence!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I reckon for a make here|pg||
nt|bg: N endplayed now cannot beat three|pg||
nt|ralfwil: claim 10 and new board|pg||
nt|idblu: the same hand?|pg||
nt|akgun: guney 6s olur diye uzulmustur yeri gorunce|pg||
nt|deniz_t: güzel kontrat|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 more IMPs for the Ladies|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cindy: look at N hand if S rebids 2H|pg||
nt|shevek: Ron Klinger and Matt Mullamphy were in the Aussie Open team in Beijing last year|pg||
nt|athene: well, we want some good boards for australia, in the interests of an exciting match|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this hand isnt going so well for the ladies|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if only East had covered..|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6 more boards after this - looks like 13 IMPs to the Aussies here|pg||
nt|nafiz: hoþgeldin VulkaN|pg||
nt|vulkan: teþekkürler, selam herkese|pg||
nt|b_eymen: burda bi arkadasýmýzýn dedigi gibi @s K balamak lazým|pg||

nt|b_eymen: j10xx önlem almak lazým|pg||
nt|vulkan: slm eymenciim|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 3 1 e kayýp yok|pg||
nt|eccone: kuzey 4@h dese daha iyieltarifi olurdu|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cindy: i mean overcall 1N instead of 1@s|pg||
nt|snorris: playing on crossruffs now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: four boards to pick up 30 IMPs|pg||
nt|xenya: curious play -- but it's as good as anything else|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he back now they missed my forecast????|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: oyun plani nasil olmali eymen?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wilkinsona: a slght change in the position of these spade would make a mess of 3NT|pg||
nt|othered1: What benefit would you get from transferring to @C that would overcome mispositioning the NT often?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PO again mentions something i misse -- maybe 3@C instead of 2@D to show max + @C length|pg||
nt|sharkey: which is desperately needed|pg||
nt|twcho: sorry, private|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|snorris: no 7|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
nt|thommos: 11|pg||

nt|akgun: karoyu cakip pik vericek sanirim|pg||

nt|eccone: sunduysada dengeli slem daveti gibi oldu|pg||
pc|d4|nt|idblu: only if they are 5-3|pg||
nt|idblu: 4-4 always makes 3N|pg||
nt|idblu: lots of avoidance plays|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: the 1NT response is in fact the problem with transfer responses|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't know, Ed.  Nor do I know that was a xfer.  It was alerted though so it seemed a possibility.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: any explanation not in4@H?|pg||
nt|b_eymen: claim|pg||

pc|sT|nt|mariner1: Marshall you are a psychic :)|pg||
nt|cindy: his hand looks ginormous after a 2H rebid|pg||
nt|snorris: well 4 @h was a strech|pg||
nt|josj: In Norway that is|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|snorris: or not|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C 33 so can pitch dummy's @C|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: trouble is, East has pushed the boat out already and doesnt want to bid 5 clubs|pg||
nt|irwinbo: good auction, he had to try|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sure|pg||
nt|idblu: meanwhile, what happens on a @C lead....???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Claim Early - Claim Often!!!|pg||
nt|akgun: hatta 2 sinide:)|pg||
nt|eccone: yoksa direkt 4@h derdi haklýsýnýz|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: not to me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H shows 44 only|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hearts provide the tricks. S cant lead clubs twice without giving dummy an extra entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: players take a rest|pg||
nt|idblu: pointed out that there is a red suit squeeze after AK ruff a @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on what sequence of previous plays, do you mean?|pg||
nt|idblu: if you lead @S and they lead @C then u set up the @D/@H sq|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is no need to. on club lead just play heart to ace and ruiff a heart, then concede a spade. S has to win to lead a club, but then you have another entry to dummy in trumps to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ruff the hearts good, and diamond ace is till there to reach the long heart for 11th trick|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: most people just say psycho, thanks for the tact Rob|pg||
pc|c8|nt|idblu: not a reverse?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with 45 rebid 2@D|pg||
nt|cindy: not to me|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|cindy: thats a typo   he meant psycho   hee hee|pg||
nt|mariner1: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree with cindy about 1NT, assuming we have methods to find a spade fit if we have it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Four more boards after this one|pg||
nt|ralfwil: very slow now!|pg||
nt|akgun: kor pasi afise artýk|pg||
nt|eccone: teknoloji yetiyosa :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cindy: to me it shows shape|pg||
nt|jaapfr: b41|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: a simpler line is to cash the @SA and embark ona cross ruff, establishing a @C trick in the process|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer isnt making many tricks here|pg||
nt|b_eymen: kritik |pg||
nt|b_eymen: yere karo veya @s|pg||
nt|b_eymen: masada olmak laazým biraz|pg||
nt|b_eymen: @s ruanýn yerini tahmin etmek lazým|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cindy: i dont rebid 5 card suits|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not a reverse if 2@C is game force|pg||
nt|werge: 140 is over - and out|pg||
nt|athene: maybe this is the start of an exciting Ozzie Rally|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Happy bridge have to go some here as EW have gone off in 5 contracts OR|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is this knockout or swiss?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: Meckwell uses 1@C-1N to show game force hand with @C length -- so there must be something to that approach|pg||
nt|othered1: Juice can't do it one imp at a time.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|barbyh: yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: in fairness W probably did like his position behind the 1@D caller.....|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good trump, holds to 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which pseudo-squeeze?  |pg||
nt|ovncylmz: diger masada da 4@s oynaniyor|pg||

pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: is more a case of less evil i think|pg||
nt|idblu: N is the protector here...will hate to throw his A@H|pg||

nt|roswolf: oh well this complicates east's life|pg||
mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: the real issue, i think, is whether 1NT will compromise your chances of finding a spade fit. if not, then i have no problem with cindy's slight upgrade based on the positional ...|pg||

nt|irwinbo: strong 2s bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT in OR|pg||
nt|caitlin: many 4 person teams|pg||
nt|othered1: getting to game on these north south hands can score 6 more imps|pg||
nt|bg: heres a chance for Juice to pick up mor than one imp|pg||
nt|idblu: that was so long ago|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = transfer to @H  -- showing better raise than immediate 2@H|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 4@H looks good - but can declarer overcome the breaks?|pg||

nt|b_eymen: 2@h 2@s pas pas olur heralde baska masada|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: might be hard to reach after the preempt|pg||

nt|othered1: and it's been corrected to that on the movie|pg||
nt|snorris: or will they cope?|pg||
nt|cindy: wow|pg||
nt|idblu: the @C8 grows up|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: QC perhaps|pg||
nt|idblu: anyone for 2@H's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 'only' day 4 of the event - and China is 6-handed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in that case - the first one!|pg||
nt|xenya: no reasonable explanation, Jaap, i'm afraid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Lui has guts |pg||
nt|yo_yo: Liu|pg||
nt|josj: there is no law against gambling|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: kuzey davet etmesin su an?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: düþünüyor derken etti|pg||
nt|aruf: tam bi el tarifi gibiydi|pg||
nt|eccone: mesala ortakta 3 boþ pik sadece as kör puanýda olabilir|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: worth a short suit or long suit try i think|pg||
nt|cindy: wow again|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and with the diamonds as they are may be 4 losers|pg||
nt|idblu: must play that constructive|pg||
nt|cindy: is that really the lead ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe the other black queen|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you know what defence NS have against strong @c|pg||
nt|Walddk5: There will be no extra boards for sure. In the event of a tie, the higher ranking team in the Swiss wins|pg||
nt|deniz_t: kuzeyde 5 kayýplý bir el görünüyor bu anlamda ne iyisini ne de kötüsünü almak gerek sanki orta bir kararda belki 4@s güzel deklare|pg||
mb|1N|an|11 15|nt|snorris: they sure did|pg||
nt|werge: Nice 1 @S.bid here|pg||
nt|snorris: you like it?|pg||
nt|othered1: not me|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess both souths have downgraded their @D after the opening.|pg||
nt|bg: 2 spades S a little underbid why not 2 dia at least show 10 points or so|pg||
nt|shevek: well apart from the shark attacks...|pg||
nt|sharkey: W hates to give up - may cost|pg||
nt|santyclz: Most play that 3@c shows a good hand with @hs, if they do, I wonder what a bad one looks like.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Now Imakura knows where K@H is|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has a difficult lead here|pg||
nt|josj: but that won't help him|pg||
nt|eccone: rua karoyu at dam tref 3 bos pike 6 hic batmaz|pg||
nt|eccone: bence az|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: i dont like 3C either  :(   to me it begs for a spade lead|pg||
nt|idblu: puppet stayman|pg||
nt|snorris: not after a gutsy 4 @c|pg||
nt|werge: NOOOO...|pg||
nt|snorris: the killing lead|pg||
nt|thommos: don't like the suit, |pg||
nt|othered1: I agree that a cue-bid by the passedhand is a good option|pg||
nt|wygbe1: his line doesnt do that, since only rho can have a stiff club - after the spade jack, could just cash ace and play clubs from top|pg||
nt|josj: now there is a chance|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Wang guessed the wrong suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: this i think can make on this lead|pg||
nt|Walddk5: So China has a carryover of 0.1 IMP|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I don't understand that lead - partner must have a club suit - this may cost the contract|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They finished 3rd in the Swiss|pg||
nt|akgun: 4d gelince hangi guney 6s ye giderdi o elle|pg||
nt|eccone: 4@h diyincede belki giderdi|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sharkey: 3 @H by S will certainly be Doubled - and most likely make...|pg||
nt|cindy: whew|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: sry|pg||
nt|idblu: looks like 3|pg||
nt|mpny: very tame for east to pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: swiss, I believe|pg||
nt|werge: But close to game anyway|pg||
nt|athene: east fears his partner just bid south's suit|pg||
nt|shevek: that happened 200 meters from where I live :)|pg||
nt|idblu: 5 in the bank :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: transfers over double gaining a lot of popularity to distinguish hands with own suit + tolerance for partner, bad vs good raises|pg||
nt|MolvaM: baðlantý kopmalarý için özür dileriz. umarým önümüzdeki günlerde elektrik kesilmeleri yaþanmaz|pg||
nt|eccone: raip 3@d diyince hata yapma ihtimalleriyok|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: East|pg||
nt|xenya: easy 8 tricks, with @CQ on|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But as the cards lie - 9 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: nicoleta is a shark at the double bay rubber bridge club :) |pg||
nt|athene: 200 meters from where she lives :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: would be lovely to see face expressions of NS ifso|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cindy: i feel like a big complainer :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: learned nothing, rather start with 3@S, asking 3NT if both majors stopped, else bid a minor|pg||
nt|snorris: trying for 7|pg||
nt|othered1: east jumps to game and partner's absolute high card maximum will be useful.|pg||
nt|snorris: -3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: expensive!|pg||
nt|snorris: or more?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: club ruff looks fairly easy|pg||
nt|mpny: Swiss qualifying for a KO|pg||
nt|werge: Here Paul got his 140...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i've been swimming with sharks, apparently they are over rated as killers|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the multi strikes again|pg||
nt|shevek: this is not going to be a pick-up for Oz...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: presumably Wang doesnt know which suit|pg||
nt|akgun: evet|pg||
nt|eccone: artýk önemli 2 renk var tref ve pik|pg||
nt|deniz_t: tabiki splinter oynamak veya soran kübit anlaþmalarýna göre deiþebilir, zaten bricin güzelliðide burda:)|pg||
nt|akgun: acik odada da hic heveslenmemiþler|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: whats wrong with just plain old 3N|pg||
nt|idblu: what a lead!|pg||
nt|cindy: why tell the opps how to defend|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Once again! now S is in a bad position|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: fair enough to bid spades if you have them|pg||
nt|thommos: CRaSH, i am told|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it leaves more room also in case north has hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H only used as preemptive or sometimes "mixed"|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: or not|pg||
nt|thommos: 9 should make on this lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, relay, not an ask at all.|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess 3@c showed a bad hand and 3@s showed the @h suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: too plain :)|pg||
nt|cindy: i told u it begged for a @s lead|pg||
nt|snorris: more imps to the ladies|pg||
nt|snorris: aplying the breaks|pg||
nt|snorris: one last 6 @c?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after 4@c E must see a slam!|pg||
nt|snorris: only question about 6 or 7 for east|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W promising both majors|pg||
nt|werge: 6 @h is clearly against odds - after North´s pre-empt!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: contemplating 7?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: EW 's aggressive policy can pay off again here|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a very friendly lead.  Might consider a trump on this auction.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well this game should always be bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but they minimized information|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, it should be bid on EW's cards, but north doesn't know that|pg||
nt|cindy: more small gain chances here|pg||
nt|cindy: im not going to say i like that lead|pg||
nt|bg: should play dia 8 tease a cover from |pg||
nt|ralfwil: three rounds of @c one @h and @s had been better|pg||
nt|othered1: can be headed -1 in a voluntarily bid 3@S|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharkey: think 3@H initially, as you stated, Ralf, wud have put pressure on EW|pg||
nt|frankaus: we got to  the @S grand where xxx opp AKTxx|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W needs to have tke K in both majors|pg||
nt|panja: well..it depends on @S pips ...|pg||
nt|caitlin: I am told our operator might have got it wrong that indeed the club was played for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|caitlin: is that possible operator?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: all the years it's been around and the multi still gains imps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb 0 emotions shown:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer's play was odd|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cindy: Jxxx is my least fav lead of all time|pg||
nt|wygbe1: beatable on h lead|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcarroll: yes but they have to find the @H lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pls no @H leD|pg||
nt|wygbe1: this may seem kind of unfair - and maybe it is, since we can see all the hands - but with e known to be short in diamonds it seems the heart is the percentage imp lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we are allowed to favor the underdogs imo:)|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: upps, 2nt+2?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I cannot see how to make this|pg||
nt|snorris: strange.. why ask pd if you are going to 7 anyway|pg||
nt|MolvaM: seyircilerin çoðunu açýk odaya kaçýrdýk malesef |pg||
pc|sK|nt|wilkinsona: west judges well to stay in a making contract..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: There is one possibility!|pg||
nt|panja: oh the 5@C seems like an elite bid..it is good to make on the way.....|pg||
nt|werge: North will be happy, that pd has the @S 10...|pg||
nt|snorris: west will finesse @ds|pg||
nt|snorris: and hope for k of @s and j of @d in north|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i think he should have ducked a spade|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 6tane kor almiyorlar mi?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|wilkinsona: declarer can play to ruff hearts it seems|pg||
nt|bg: club J not a good play now in wrong hand|pg||
nt|idblu: Joey...your call|pg||
pc|s7|nt|idblu: just a guess, no reason @S over @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: I simply dont lead it unless is pards suit, even then likely to lead the J |pg||
nt|cindy: E may hate leading from Jxxx too so decided to lead a strange card to try to disguise it :)|pg||
nt|bg: 165 specs know what to do now littletougher for N|pg||
nt|cindy: trying to get a heart shift maybe    certainly cant want a @d back|pg||
nt|idblu: agree|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: playing a low spade from dummy first may have been tricky for the defence|pg||
nt|idblu: maintains control|pg||
nt|shevek: this is a textbook multi two btw |pg||
nt|athene: well, it wasn't the multi which gained imps|pg||
nt|athene: it was a multi in the other room too!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|othered1: This type of auction is a benefit of a big club system.  East can have a great variety of hands for the 4@S bid,since partner's opening is limited.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and/or diamonds|pg||
nt|snorris: ace of @d THEN clubs|pg||
nt|athene: it was North wading in over 3@C|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like Frue can escape for -1 here|pg||
nt|shevek: imo, 3@s is the culprit|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 @H - 2 @S - 1@D|pg||
nt|sharkey: What if E Major suit were reversed?|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S is a bit pushy|pg||
nt|idblu: will probably eventually overtake the K@H to play a @S down and will be pleasantly surprised when the Q@H falls|pg||
nt|vulkan: doðu trefle el tutup alttan karo oynarsa dekleranýn tercihine kalacaktý|pg||
nt|b_eymen: ewet|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does North hand fit either of those 3@H descriptions?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: playing East for a singleton @DK|pg||
nt|josj: maybe he did not realise @H might be 4-1 as well|pg||
pc|s8|nt|santyclz: NEXT!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: And the finesse has to be taken the right way to keep E  off lead and 9 tricks then available|pg||
nt|athene: it's basically hoping south has hearts and partner didn't do anything with a borderline hand|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: uste cakmadi mi?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|cindy: oh i agree with that   just saying they always get it right against me|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shud W have raised to 4@C?|pg||
nt|snorris: dont think so ..has doubled|pg||
nt|snorris: thats enough|pg||
nt|snorris: first hurdle..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no chance|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|cindy: that looked good|pg||
nt|yo_yo: klinger went quietly in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D is ok if you have the firm partnership agreement it's non-forcing here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think the chinese ladies might have discussed that|pg||
nt|athene: yes, south passed it :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: E wasn't nice enough to unblock the @d9.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|idblu: or they play always lead @S vs NT :)|pg||
nt|snorris: bidding|pg||
nt|snorris: yes'|pg||
nt|snorris: nice to have @s now..|pg||
nt|thommos: but recovered|pg||
nt|idblu: ty :)|pg||
nt|idblu: no cooperation from the defence at all|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: odd play in hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: here's the link to the standings: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest09/nec.html   ty tania|pg||
nt|chessmaste: So China will retake the lead|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cindy: has to take his 9 now|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I notice the 1N alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: hayýr|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: çakmadý gördü sanmýþ oyuncu|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: enteresan seyler oluyor su an|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: takimlar isinma problemi yasiyorlar bence, ya da erken yoruldular|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: ilk gun hep zor olur bu tur turnuvalarda:)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cindy: hehe|pg||
nt|cindy: and @c vs slams|pg||
nt|idblu: that too...part of sayc :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i will test that|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and by the way, i don't play sayc|pg||
nt|idblu: win 5 Imps for caution|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and perhaps more than 9. W is under pressure|pg||
nt|josj: but playing the @DQ probably cannot cost|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: This declarer is taking everything not nailed down|pg||
nt|caitlin: ok ....10 tricks|pg||
nt|idblu: the @C8 may grow up|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wilkinsona: take care, now...|pg||
nt|othered1: why set out on that line then pull trumps?|pg||
nt|sybarra: think we cash soon |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|idblu: moi aussi...|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - looked at nothing wasted in @H and everything working - but E wud have passed|pg||
nt|snorris: can contain a singelton?|pg||
nt|thommos: 1@H showed majors or minors|pg||
nt|thommos: 2@C was pass or correct|pg||
nt|thommos: Bye all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bye|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sharkey: that was EW...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In some places you alert weak NTs|pg||
nt|snorris: like east before?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d3|nt|santyclz: N is asking for an undo.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|snorris: ??|pg||
nt|snorris: south sleeping?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or VU|pg||
pc|hA|nt|idblu: what does it stand for?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chessmaste: They have been wobbling in both rooms over the last few deals |pg||
pc|h9|nt|sharkey: probably W didnt feel he cud afford to pass 3 @D - in case pd had @S - so I don't think 3@S that unreasonable view his strong fallback @C suit|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: crossruff!|pg||
nt|xenya: W would have done better to unblock @Ds perhaps -- still there must be a way for 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: in the other room 3@H makes more sense because the 1@H opener was limited by failure to open 1@C|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: here, South could have held bigger hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wilkinsona: these trumps were made for ruffing|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is caitlin around?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|idblu: It is ACBL propaganda|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ovncylmz: daha enteresan seyler olabilirdi bu boardda|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ovncylmz: -1 le iyi kurtardi izmir takimi|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|othered1: and now an overtrick en passant|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but 10 tricks ok|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: diger masada da 2nt+2 oldu|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: actually it started off as anything on general chart|pg||

nt|fabsayc: east worth 2NT then quick sign-off|pg||
nt|sharkey: Operator said one of the pairs lost their convention card - thus alert of weak NT proper|pg||

nt|othered1: south  does have a 12-count, and 2@C is normal.  Rebid will be interesting|pg||
nt|idblu: OK..some values|pg||
nt|mcarroll: closer now as they found the @H ruff fo beat 4@S in OR|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 5@h iyi gibi|pg||
mb|1N|nt|idblu: not counting his Jacks|pg||
nt|snorris: does n dear 3nt?|pg||
nt|othered1: Ew have lots of duplication, but likely time to avoid going past 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either CC has changed, or Takayama thinks West hand is too good for 10-13 NT opener |pg||
nt|athene: oh yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: per 2007 CC  --- vs big @C:  DBL=@H, 1@D=@S, 1@H=color [@C&@S or @D&@H], 1@S=shape [@C&H or @D&@S] 1N=rank [@C&@D or @H&@S]|pg||
nt|idblu: then he bid wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: partnership check -- is 2@H forcing or not?   drum roll please|pg||
nt|idblu: must have changed the cc|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hadn't seen that defense before.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I can barely spell zar though|pg||
nt|cindy: i would open it in a train, i would open it on a plane|pg||
nt|marlowepi: invcented by Dr. Zarkov|pg||
nt|cindy: is that forcing ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT  equal length perhaps|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @s singelton?|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @h might be good now|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont like much about the S hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i might if you reverse the majors, but probably not on the atcual hand|pg||
nt|idblu: N can protect|pg||
nt|idblu: E hand useless to W|pg||
nt|athene: i didn't notice south's hand|pg||
nt|shevek: things getting even worse....|pg||
nt|athene: no way you are passing 4@S with that|pg||
nt|idblu: up here we play Mickey Mouse...dbl=maj, NT = min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops - typing error -- 1@S=rank, 1N=shape    sorry about that|pg||
nt|jaapfr: again a good board ew|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4h on|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: limit raise|pg||
nt|cindy: or his trumps|pg||
nt|snorris: good for him|pg||
nt|othered1: A nice spot and a good stop after a 15 point 1N opening.  |pg||
nt|snorris: as not to weak e-w up|pg||
nt|idblu: u r forgiven|pg||
nt|vulkan: kör partjýna þlem kabaktý :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: batýnýn 3karo açýþý biraz frenledi sanýrým|pg||
nt|b_eymen: hersey tamam 7 @c demezler demi övünç?|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 6c:)|pg||
nt|b_eymen: karo rua soramýyo ne olcak|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: ama rua sorma durumu falan olursa isler karisik|pg||
nt|deniz_t: bizler yaþlandýk galiba yeni jenerasyon briççiler güzel anlaþýyorlar:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: perhaps he thinks he has a runout suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apart from this hand and these pairs, it is worth checking with our regular partners whether the sequence by E is forcing on W|pg||
nt|idblu: that too|pg||
nt|snorris: q of @c|pg||
nt|snorris: just kidding..|pg||
nt|idblu: but vulnerability a big concern for n/s|pg||
nt|werge: by|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but the Chinese ladies are playing very well ( as usual)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2 part scores in a row?|pg||
nt|idblu: too  high already|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile the gap has narrowed down to 21 imps|pg||
nt|wygbe1: low spade will beat 4s, but 5d is cold ew|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 4c yi as sorusu oynuyorlar mi acaba?|pg||
nt|aruf: Turgay abi sonunu görmedik daha :)|pg||
nt|akgun: KG in yaþ ortalamasý 50 civari yanilmiyorsam:)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|frankaus: X would be lot of pain for fushida|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is hard to be a handhog with a yarborough, but S achieved that difficult feat with the 2H bid|pg||
nt|snorris: has to lead @cs from table though|pg||
nt|snorris: so ace of @ds and @s to ace and...|pg||
nt|werge: Safety play now - @s and then @C from dummy!|pg||
nt|cindy: hmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: d opener wd be devastating|pg||
nt|sharkey: actually best sac view potential @C ruffs in @H contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this double is going to backfire|pg||
nt|fabsayc: because it surely asks for a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: maybe west will be a hero and lead a small spade from hand|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 4@d mu 5@h mü paþam|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Presumably|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declare can establish diamonds without letting south in|pg||
nt|snorris: well done e-w|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well done by west|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats a push by West|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to say the least|pg||
nt|idblu: @H lead best|pg||
nt|othered1: But east doesn't know of the duplication yet|pg||
nt|thommos: J@S and 4 trumps are good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ???????|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wow, this is dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: WOW --- what a bizarre swing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: any lead beats 4s?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kuzey 1nt açablse idi güney þleme giderdi muhtemelen|pg||
nt|b_eymen: artýk iþler karýþtý|pg||
nt|b_eymen: tref nasýl tutucak bakalým|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: interesting   im not sure i would think its forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm   4 @C?|pg||
nt|idblu: and how to find out|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D looks like they're ignoring west's opening.|pg||
nt|athene: i think that's asking a lot though :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Makes 1nt so -1 is no loss.|pg||
nt|idblu: looks like a push...same contract in the OR|pg||
nt|nafiz: http://clubs.vugraph.com/tbricfed/teams_event.php?event=172&stage=368 sonuçlarla ilgili adres /link/url|pg||
pc|s2|nt|snorris: @c lead??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would pass 2C and hope to make it|pg||
nt|idblu: what system are they playing...can someone explain the auction|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no problems with @dA on side|pg||
nt|othered1: nice lead, not to capitulate honors|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nothing much matters|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck from both hands would be interesting|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Should be a flat board|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wilkinsona: heart lead OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: that helps a lot|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Unbelievable lead!!! E showing minors!!|pg||
nt|irwinbo: yes and a diamond switch|pg||
nt|werge: But how can North stand 5 @C...?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They can't bounce back if they are dropping out of the top 8, and they are very close at this point|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think S is too good for 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is the last round of the qualifying and only the top 8 teams advance|pg||
nt|sharkey: he wants to make the Bulletin....|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: güney yeri görünce biraz kýzdý ama kör þigfanýný görüdce batýdan sevindi|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|idblu: take 5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: opposite 5332 would be down in 4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: a good club guess will help|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like it when they lead my best suit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kuzey 12-13 puanla kontr demiþ olabilir. bence 5@h çok fazla|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: sekil a|pg||
nt|b_eymen: :)|pg||
nt|b_eymen: bu tutmakolmadý ama|pg||
nt|b_eymen: ilan etti|pg||
nt|deniz_t: sonunu görmeye gerek yok güzel konuþmalar var, yakýþýklý.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|cindy: thats ok|pg||
nt|bg: good opening by East this could get tough eventhough all cards are well placed|pg||
nt|sybarra: can declarer guess the @H?|pg||
nt|santyclz: When precision first came out there was a defense in the NYC area called 1@s.  You just bid 1@s without looking at your hand.|pg||
nt|wygbe1: actually i guess they can beat 5d also with a club lead by south|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes there is a warm glow in your heart|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: sansli olma sirasi diyarbakirda|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cindy: do you think it is marshall ?|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont mind going down|pg||
nt|idblu: gotta be there|pg||
nt|idblu: claiming 5|pg||
nt|snorris: now..|pg||
nt|irwinbo: by south|pg||
nt|othered1: first cue on a void can be dangerous in some situations, but here it pretty much clarifies hand for east|pg||
nt|fabsayc: assuming hearts break i see 9, and taking them fast|pg||
nt|othered1: how do you get them all?|pg||
nt|othered1: A and another @D back|pg||
nt|xenya: S has no answer to 2@S but N might have reopened if given a chance|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i think w can make now, with a h at trick 2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|othered1: Opposite a 15-17 1N opening, west might act and get overboard|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes but D over 5@c is - I cannot explain it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok they wont bounce back then :(|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, Barry is in the audience|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: arastirma sirasinda enteresan seyler olabilirdi bu boardda|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: In Japan, 1NT is 15-17/16-18, other ranges should be alerted. Thanks to Kazuo Takano for the clarification|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this surely makes now|pg||
nt|snorris: yes it will|pg||
nt|snorris: -1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: take your 6 tricks and new board!|pg||
nt|othered1: and you're blocked in both majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from Barry Rigal: This version of CRASH was played in UK 30 years ago --maximizes use of 1H/S/NT.|pg||
nt|idblu: i had friends who bid the   of deuces they held...1D =1, 1H = 2, etc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but were those friends sober/straight enough for correct count?|pg||
nt|idblu: sat  down vs becker/rubin in Niagara Falls in '79 and they changed rooms|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|snorris: well done|pg||
nt|sybarra: anyone have any good ideas about 4 @C?  asking for cue bids?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so -- now we're back to my ducking trick 1 eh?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ralfwil: More unbelievable|pg||
nt|bg: could have new leader if this makes|pg||
nt|xenya: W was forced to bid 4@S i think -- although she knew preciously little about partner's hand|pg||
nt|wygbe1: n does best to win and shift to stiff d|pg||
nt|jaapfr: after my silly comment i was trown out bbo:(|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: time to cash the aces...|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S bids 3@C over 2@C showing limit raise values he can later pass 5@C and leave decision to pd|pg||
nt|sharkey: min limit raise values|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - but maybe 3@C would have been more than a limit raise|pg||
nt|mpny: It is not clear that a limit raise creates a forcing pass|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Let Partner decide with pass over 5@c|pg||
nt|mpny: but the NS result is poor|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In vulnerable! of course|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarer will figure the red aces are split, must play for actual layout|pg||
pc|c9|nt|idblu: 2 ways to play the @Cs|pg||
nt|idblu: but if N wins the 1st @D...no guess|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would have super-accepted the transfer with the W hand - anyone else?|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: LOl|pg||
nt|b_eymen: þans kazandýran durumlara denir|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|sybarra: could have been gerber (Roland will shoot me for typing it) |pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|cindy: i hear him coming|pg||
nt|cindy: sorry  shirley   i didnt see the beginning of the hand   phone excuse here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S should not fall for this|pg||
nt|ralfwil: locked on table! why not win with @hA|pg||
nt|mpny: non vul opponents can still make things|pg||
nt|othered1: He may wind up playing for @H 10xx|pg||
nt|wygbe1: w hasnt made 4s yet, but if she does match is tight|pg||
nt|josj: now E can open up another suit to declarer's advantage|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Liu to find a lead, not easy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jaapfr: lovely|pg||
nt|wygbe1: with that play she should make i think|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: and a help from W|pg||
nt|shevek: nice bulletins btw :)|pg||
nt|b_eymen: bu board egale çok büyük ihtimal|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: pastan geliyor ama|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: egale oldu|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcarroll: good choice of plays|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is most likely to be 6322. so win S ace & lead D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: oops, thanks. forgot W was playing it|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|werge: NO - look at the @c-values|pg||
nt|santyclz: The toothpicks holding my eyes open are starting to get soggy.|pg||
nt|josj: low @H now probably prevents the overtrick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bg: dont like heart king there may get tangled up should have played dia first|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she heard you :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: a straight guess|pg||
nt|josj: timing not yet right for a squeeze on E|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think many would lead from Q, do you?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Declarer is worried - a wrong guess and a low club back he is thinking|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: but i was at least right that E is most likely to be 6322 :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but west will get endplayed in clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if they attack the heart entry twice|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you will not be trown out Jim:)|pg||
nt|arigun: 4@h de biraz az...yanda 15 puan ile |pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: agree Martin, but now it was right|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 12-13 isede 4-4-1-4 dir en ýkötü |pg||
nt|b_eymen: dagýlýmý uygun olur diye|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet. eðer kendini iyi hissediyor ise 4@d denebilirdi|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't like the 3 small @Ds|pg||
nt|idblu: yours and mine both|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting in OR they bid to 6@H and W then bid 6@S rather than dbl|pg||
nt|xenya: a huge swing for the ladies is on the horizon|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if n was allowed to hold the trick and shift to d , might have beaten 4s|pg||
nt|josj: declarer needs to lose 1 more trick but of he does so, he loses 2|pg||
nt|josj: if|pg||
nt|eccone: 1@c 1@h 2@c baska biþiymi rehacým|pg||
pc|cT|nt|idblu: oops went wrong...played for 2-2 A onside|pg||
nt|cindy: wonder if anyone at the table noticed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: oops unlucky guess gives 3 tricks it seems|pg||
nt|idblu: it is just after midnight here in North America EST|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A good shot by East |pg||
nt|josj: Q is mandatory|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: now needs diamond finesse?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Superglue has been recommended to me.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ralfwil: and a squeeze on S!|pg||
nt|sharkey: S will come under pressure now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep with only 2 boards left a good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahh back in the Ultimate Club era -- that was hard book to read, but concept sure made impact for scientific bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: i agree|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2 rounds of @c will kill S|pg||
nt|akgun: KG in oynadiklari sistem Universal Transfer Responses (UTR) nin modifiye edilmis sekli|pg||
pc|s7|nt|josj: or finesse, rather|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 3@c e 4@c dese diyor öbürü hwmen|pg||
pc|s8|nt|santyclz: @h lead in the other room simplified things.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wilkinsona: bur -2 now|pg||
nt|santyclz: NEXT!|pg||
nt|idblu: and quickly|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|othered1: note that even if south had unblocked @H earlier, with @S blocked, it wouldn't have mattered|pg||
nt|roswolf: 9 tricks only now|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: evet bence de|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: well, i think that RDBL puts the ball in their court, so we have to be prepared for it to be back in our court, and since RDBL announces more than the balance of the values, i ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: think it ought to be forcing. but there is room for discussion|pg||
pc|s3|nt|snorris: boars 7 has been ajusted to 2@s xx |pg||
nt|cindy: more unlucky they are in 2N|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: nice not to be vulnerable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it would be better for E to play king of spades and a spade. that way he is more likely to smoke out the info he needs to guess clubs right|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|snorris: 2200|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: or 3 rounds!|pg||

nt|cindy: i think the colors are clouding my view|pg||

nt|cindy: if they were reversed, i would think its forcing :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: I would thik it would need pd to have opened light before it could be passed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if it is forcing, and maybe even if it is not, maybe E should just bid an honest 2H....but maybe EW play that as NF, but then you can;t play RDBL followed by Pass as NF|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session in 51 minutes 18 seconds|pg||
nt|cindy: oh yes   i like 2@h much better|pg||
nt|ralfwil: To watch this defence is good for sharpening your self confidence|pg||
nt|sybarra: just a double hook  |pg||
nt|snorris: so only 13 imps down now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so a push|pg||
nt|mdgraham: note that North just bid 4@S, not 4@D, after a raise to 3@S in the other room |pg||
nt|sharkey: Pass is not forcing in my book after 4@S thus S had to Dbl|pg||
nt|ralfwil: same result in OR! unbelieveable|pg||
nt|athene: australia are running out of boards here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West will be extremely relieved to learn this is a 7 imp pickup|pg||

nt|idblu: 1/2 imp looking big now :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Suddenly we have a close game|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i might be tempted to try 3S on the S hand in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or 4 spades|pg||
nt|cindy: no 4@s for me|pg||
nt|bg: good old style 4 card major|pg||
nt|werge: J-10 of @s are vasted values too|pg||
nt|akgun: kuzey 6. boarddaki 3nt den sonra iyice havaya girdi:)|pg||
nt|eccone: :)|pg||
nt|aruf: Ama yaþar abiyi birazdan gidip tebrik edecegim cok iyi tercih yaptý ve oynadý |pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: dont always have one|pg||
nt|idblu: do they play ACOL?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think most play 3@S or 4@S as preemptive after bidding by opps but not sure |pg||
nt|roswolf: now n/s should get the defence right|pg||
nt|chessmaste: They took a club ruff but then South played back a diamond!!|pg||
mb|2D|nt|idblu: not my o'call vul|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S looks better than 2NT|pg||
nt|snorris: 1 nt anyone?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: doubtless EW miss informed re the redouble|pg||
nt|idblu: 4@S cold on 20 high....good vul save in 5@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, though that might go for a lot against nothing, or too much against game|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it appears EW will find the sac however|pg||
nt|othered1: double is not without considerable risk, as south may prefer 3-card support for @H to a weak 4-card minor.|pg||
nt|thommos: probably|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If not I had bid 5@s on that hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 5 level decisions are the most difficult for me|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they are for everybody|pg||
nt|sharkey: Is Mr. Hanlon considering entering the fray?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: At least as a save against 5@c. Who says that we have a @s trick in the defence?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: of course he is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=6+ HCP  so game force created|pg||
nt|josj: which @C did N return?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: seven|pg||
nt|josj: interesting...|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: ama ortagin hep pastan geldi ve cok dengesiz diye dusunur, 5-5 11 puanla acilir herhalde:)|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 3@c all pas|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: baksana KG 9lar 10larla aciyor|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Righr Snorri, probably the only reason|pg||
nt|snorris: seems so|pg||
nt|athene: the play here isn't trivial by any means|pg||
nt|athene: i guess you set off on diamonds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lots of options on this hand |pg||
nt|yo_yo: lots of way to go wrong in the @D suit|pg||
nt|athene: you would rather win the lead in dummy to set off on diamonds i think|pg||
nt|idblu: 6@H a nice contract|pg||
nt|akgun: 3nt yi oynayan Erhan abi degilmiydi|pg||
mb|2S|nt|barbyh: sometimes the oppo's have 7 runners and an outside trick|pg||
nt|cindy: me either|pg||
nt|idblu: intermediate jump overcall vul here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if we can make 4S, much of the time N will bid it over 3S at these coplors|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: dogunun eli ile 2@s denebilir mi?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C=@Ds it seems|pg||
nt|geller: there are only 4 boards left in the half, but 20 boards left in the match.  No reason for the Dutch to panic yet.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Do they not have another 16 boards to play?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H transfer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL -- unnecessary|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H obligatory now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Somehow in the o/r e neglected to open that rock.|pg||
nt|roswolf: great judgment|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A brilliant bid by East |pg||
nt|josj: saves the day and maybe even the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: true|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Liu trusts her partner|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps an imp to japan|pg||
nt|eccone: 4@s2@h2@D5@c olsa bile dbl |pg||
mb|2N|nt|thommos: 3@S is too high|pg||
nt|bg: how many bid 1 heart East? how is pard going to know what is happening-not necessary to bid every time it is your turn|pg||
nt|xenya: yes they do|pg||
nt|werge: This looks like panic...|pg||
nt|xenya: this is segment 1|pg||
nt|santyclz: By e or s?|pg||
nt|othered1: dbl could let them find slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe  East :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sidebar -- NS play CRASH over strong 2@C -- how many of you in the audience have discussed that possibility?|pg||
nt|idblu: won't keep W out of it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@D likely to fail here|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i think 3n was cold|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope|pg||
nt|b_eymen: denmez|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 3 tane olmalý :P|pg||
nt|aruf: ok Erhan abiyi :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: maybe be headed to 6 nown |pg||
nt|sybarra: guess not |pg||
nt|cindy: time running out |pg||
nt|cindy: does anyone like e/w methods here with 3@d ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i do, a lot|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats the problem with 1 spade|pg||
nt|irwinbo: vul it was an intermediate (strong) jump overcall i think|pg||
nt|cindy: the thing that bothers me is 3@d takes up so much room when it could be their hand|pg||
nt|idblu: yes..I like int jump o/calls vul|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am a firm believer in intermediate J O vul|pg||
nt|othered1: that may be the best lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice stiff trump lead|pg||
nt|idblu: wonder why :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: agree with 2nt?|pg||
nt|othered1: I like 3@H now by north|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not if south is flat|pg||
nt|snorris: this is too expensive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North's PASS probably [keyword] denied 3@S|pg||
nt|othered1: Actually, I did this afternoon, right before a local tournament session|pg||
nt|santyclz: With 1 pd I play SuperCRaSh.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my bet 6@D-1|pg||
nt|wygbe1: diamonds might go down, even at the 5 level|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I'll be the Sun was not shining in the other room|pg||
nt|akgun: benimde tebrikleri iletirsen sevinirim|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: can breathe easy here|pg||
nt|snorris: curious 1nt in east|pg||
nt|cindy: method being a jump overcall is not weak |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: EW have outbid NS on this hand|pg||
nt|b_eymen: iyi bi þlem eli daha|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: It won't be difficult for declarer to place the outstanding 11 hcp|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|werge: NO!|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL by south often used to say "you must accept transfer now"|pg||
nt|othered1: When do they get around to getting their 9-card solid fit into the auction?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 4@D?    maybe that shows better @C support|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: its just the taking up so much space thing that bothers me|pg||
nt|geller: Really, what's remarkable is that so far there have only been two big swings, both to Japan.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gulp|pg||
nt|b_eymen: mecbur olmadýkça insiyatif almayanlar iyi oyuncu olur övünç|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: or is it?|pg||
nt|snorris: not after this lead|pg||
nt|snorris: needed to lead @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South NOT interpreting partner's pass as denying 3@S|pg||
nt|othered1: Feels like south was taking some kind of inference from north's actions that I don't see.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ok, that's half the battle.  Just 1 more little task to complete.|pg||
nt|idblu: do we ruff 2@C and concede a @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Some questionable actions by N in this match - the lead last hand and failure to bid @S on Hand   9|pg||
nt|snorris: Akama not agreeing with you Hans|pg||
nt|snorris: going -1|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@C by west says nothing about @C - just forcing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like a flat board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it looks as if 3@S was GF|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think Invitational values and E accepted.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: PO prefers west to bid a direct 3@S|pg||
nt|werge: How can you imgine to make 4 ! facing a passed hand??? |pg||
nt|mpny: 2C created a GF|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly. In England, most play that the jump after 4SF is GF|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry, not passed hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i play 4th suit is GF|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@C shows invitational values|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but opposite 1@D maybe 3@S better  ( playing a strong club)|pg||
nt|geller: especially with Chen-Furuta in for Japan you'd expect more than 28 imps of total swings in the first 12 boards.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so -- going INTO 13 we had tie, after 13, not so much|pg||
nt|aruf: tmm 5 dakikaya kadar gidecegim salona |pg||
nt|akgun: karo atagindan sonra?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: can anyone of you bid 1nt on E? not me with only 10xx in @s|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this lead should ditch this contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very tempting, with all those kings|pg||
nt|vulkan: yine uygun kör ve tref daðýlýmýna þlem olacaktý ama maalesef|pg||
nt|akgun: kor atagida oldurucu|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|werge: He is not alne|pg||
nt|werge: alone|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: should have had less space if south opens 4 spades|pg||
nt|santyclz: The lead is frightening as it may easily mean @ds aren't breaking and they're needed for transportation.|pg||
nt|b_eymen: bricte yapmak istediklerin ve yapman gerekenler var|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: haklisin|pg||
nt|b_eymen: yapman gerekenleri yaptýkça kazanýrsýn|pg||
nt|b_eymen: sende :=|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: ortaktan 2sp ye 4sp gelmesi muhtemel:)|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: bende J98X varken|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: ama rakip her durumda 3c oynasin isterim ben:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: 2@D shows spade fit, game interest|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10 tricks on many ways|pg||
nt|othered1: Perhaps they focus on @H suit.  If north denied solid @H stop, south's h and gets better|pg||
nt|akgun: bu ataktan sonra cikari yok defans atlamazsa|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: still -2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's the aces that are a problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but endplayed once again :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lead it again|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7@ds?|pg||
nt|b_eymen: dogunun 4 lü @c i kesinlestigi icin 3@d bidaha konusula bilirdi|pg||
nt|akgun: yerde vale ile kalinca 1 den fazla batacak|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: can S see a singleton @s on N?|pg||
nt|idblu: oops|pg||
nt|yo_yo: true  aces are useful|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- we all know South could effectively lead @S2 -- but South only sees his hand and dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a) does teramoto trust north's carding in @D   b) did North give accurate count|pg||
nt|santyclz: I would have led the @ha (opening), because my pd always has a stiff in my suit.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: should West cover the @D9?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or will he, i guess not|pg||
nt|sharkey: then it makes i think - if she lets @D9 sail....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specs calling for 14@D|pg||
nt|mcarroll: maybe even -2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i am still online:)?|pg||
nt|xenya: likely -2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cindy: he had his bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you don't have them, and partner is a bit short of them too|pg||
nt|xenya: not exactly a happy contract |pg||
nt|idblu: if trust count in @D's...3-3, that the best line|pg||
pc|dT|nt|wilkinsona: and can be -300|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not easy, but a spade may be best here|pg||
nt|idblu: makes now|pg||
nt|othered1: east, however, rode to NS's rescue, trading a likely plus for a likely minus, maybe -200|pg||
nt|shevek: if @c 3-3 they can wait....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: glad operator did not like it either:)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought rule was -- partner always has stiff when you rebid the suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree this is subpar overcall, but is all a matter of style|pg||
nt|othered1: A matter of style and some top champions do well with it (but I don't)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [7@DX]|pg||
nt|deniz_t: kanýmca 3 nt yapýlacak|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eccone: imkansýz|pg||
nt|aruf: bir batacak |pg||
nt|akgun: guney pasif savunmaya gectigi surece sorun yok|pg||
nt|aruf: karo ruayý bilse ortagýnda 2 batacaktý|pg||
nt|deniz_t: körü ezmedi maalesef ama bakýcaz|pg||
pc|c2|nt|snorris: w has to lead @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true enough tony--but then even MORE likely that NS would end up saving|pg||
nt|athene: yes, best to keep that club tenace intact|pg||
nt|othered1: Will west continue @H?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|wilkinsona: trumps for -2 now|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: spec says 3N OR going a pos -3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: possible 13 imps|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: makes it a tight match with one board to go|pg||
nt|snorris: has been confirmed|pg||
nt|snorris: 3nt -3|pg||
nt|cindy: doesnt really matter what they play if S bids 4@s|pg||
nt|thommos: 3D was likely make|pg||
nt|sharkey: According to the "book" games should be bid with a success rate of about 38% - view the high payout if it makes |pg||
nt|ovncylmz: diger masada 3sp oynaniyor su anda|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: I bid 1 NT with E hand - show shape if not 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: The double of 6@S deserves to be costly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: philosophically -- i wonder what difference are between south's immediate 4@C vs RDBL [forcing 3@S] then 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe one of those would convince Ino that his @D are biddable|pg||
nt|idblu: I was away for a few min...seems to have missed something here :)|pg||
nt|akgun: ezse bile antre sorunu vardý|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: undo|pg||
pc|hA|nt|idblu: that he did....W was suspect|pg||
nt|snorris: it would be 3@c or 2 @s in my book|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems so... a glimmer of hope for the Oz team|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in fact 4@s is a cheap save against 4@h with J10xx in @c on N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HA, @DJ [north pitching @H]|pg||
nt|twcho: unbelievable|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: need spade now for -2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you agree with line of play (me not)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so my -1|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may make 4Sx sometimes|pg||
nt|idblu: and 5@SX on this def|pg||
nt|cindy: thats not the only way to get to 4@s|pg||
nt|xenya: but declarer can get out for -1 if he persists with trumps |pg||
nt|santyclz: Needed to take the @d finesse.|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: salvador assael 2c ye dbl atmis, 3clye nafiz zorlu 3@d deyince de 3@s ye duzeltmis|pg||
nt|akgun: guney hep pasif oynarsa -2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: with the particular auction we have, i would play North for absolute worst hand for slam potential -- so South gets vast majority of the charge here|pg||
nt|wygbe1: well he did go down at 5d - or would have if e didnt pitch h|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cindy: i might have dbld 1N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If score sheet is ok, 6@h went down in OR but 7 made in CR(!)|pg||
nt|idblu: still wouldn't help|pg||
nt|eccone: körü ezsede yapamazdý|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wilkinsona: trumps ace|pg||
nt|snorris: this has been quit some comeback|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: assuming the adjusted score stands|pg||
nt|shevek: @dJ gone, really?|pg||
nt|athene: probably went @D9@DQ @DK @DA and a spade return|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|mariner1: Japan Gold Medal in World Mind Sports Games|pg||
nt|snorris: 11 hp outside @s..|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that made life easy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and EW have cooperated with the recovery|pg||
nt|snorris: disclaim..|pg||
nt|sharkey: Thus EW pushed - NV they may have settled for 3@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sry, still short a pitch even with 2 entries to dmy.|pg||
nt|idblu: complete cross ruff now..2@C and 1@D|pg||
nt|aruf: güney her yerden bi ekmek arayýþý içinde :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: W may have overbid when bidding 3@S - 2@S may have shown his hand|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|ralfwil: that´s better|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|cindy: let W squirm|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I will show at least a half @s stopper|pg||
nt|snorris: to much for 1 nt|pg||
nt|deniz_t: kapalý kart tabiki acele etmemek lazým:)|pg||
nt|aruf: ve kagýt oldu |pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: sry - I mistook the bidding|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so australia still alive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now ping pong match -- @D ruffs vs @H ruffs|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: you can't, you passed west hand|pg||
nt|cindy: i mean with E|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|athene: the chinese defence in the other room has slipped up a couple of times|pg||
nt|shevek: not sure the play went like this...|pg||
nt|sharkey: ducking !9 wud have given declarer a losing option|pg||
nt|othered1: in NT?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my -- i missed pull to 6N|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharkey: @D9|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|snorris: only 10?|pg||
nt|snorris: tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must be at least 11|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Reminds me of one of David Burn's famous quotes: "You can't make 3NT on a cross-ruff"|pg||
nt|idblu: had to cash @D's down now...but only because of bad @H break...very unlucky|pg||
nt|aruf: 2 batarken 1 fazla yapacak|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: i'll bring my own straw :(|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anyone have a thesaurus -- calling this hand  weird   just doesn't seem to do it justice|pg||
nt|idblu: this should break the tie....but 3 sessions to go still...lots of bridge to come|pg||
nt|santyclz: Peter Gill says that if he didn't pitch a @d, he could have taken the @d finesse, reentered in @ds and squozen e.|pg||

nt|mariner1: this is the last board of this session, next in 45 minutes|pg||
nt|frankaus: tu for your company cindy, marshall, barbara, rob, kibs  - tu BBO and all at NEC formaking this vugraph possible|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Unknown (Japan) our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
nt|idblu: last hand?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must be wrong - or?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: OK- last board|pg||
nt|snorris: @s lead to the ace and later a @d finesse!!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well defended then..|pg||
nt|othered1: That was a little punishing for getting to an inferior but not hopeless spot.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and last bd now |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@h by E and 4@h by W wasn´t good|pg||
nt|idblu: last hand everyone...thanks for the insights :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 27 IMPs = 22-8 VP. It's touch and go whether Hackett can afford that; will depend on results in other matches|pg||
nt|mpny: Reaching game here is a very normal result, despite the four top losers|pg||
nt|sharkey: Potential swing here|pg||
nt|caitlin: how the tide has turned|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no idea if my defense is any better|pg||
nt|xenya: any other play allowes the defence to score their trumps separately|pg||
nt|athene: 15 imps in 3 boards|pg||
nt|athene: easily possible|pg||
nt|shevek: let's not forget real score is 78-58|pg||
nt|athene: but a good result for China here|pg||
nt|athene: ah right good point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for a minute i thought i knew the answer --- but turns out I  AM  wearing the correct pair of glasses|pg||
nt|wygbe1: his line needed diam q coming down plus 33h = so might as well ruff h before playing d, which would lead to down one|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok now we must support Jepan:)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: what a comeback by the china women|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: time to relax? -- looks like a quiet partial by NS |pg||
nt|jaapfr: would be sensational for the chinese girls to beat the whole male field:)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: like the cardinals in the super bowl - so will japan now do what pittsburgh did? for u.s. players only|pg||
nt|jaapfr: they are all asleep Jim|pg||

nt|deniz_t: yakýþýklý sen git gene tbr et:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: thx all :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Many thanks to the NEC (sponsor), the JCBL and Akito Omasafor helping BBO|pg||
nt|mariner1: bring us the vugraphs!|pg||
nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators Barbara Apel, Marshall|pg||
nt|mariner1: Lewis and Cindy Marshall (USA), and Frank Budai (Australia), and Roland Wald|pg||
nt|mariner1: (Denmark).....I am Rob Brown (USA)........|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
nt|cindy: E has the hand i dont want to pass and dont want to bid 2S|pg||
nt|cindy: yes it is|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Corrected to 12|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: of this set|pg||
nt|cindy: ok   nail biter here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: north playing 2 hearts OR|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @h??|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Last board|pg||
nt|othered1: 3 boards to go in a tied match.|pg||
nt|bg: now tied three to go cannot get any better than this|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E must have a perfect cound on S so a trumph continuation was obvious|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Looks like a regulation game here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|irwinbo: she gave him count on the hearts, isn't that a major error by west?|pg||
nt|nafiz: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  detaylý canlý yayýn program linki|pg||
nt|aruf: ok :))) valla uzak dururum oralardan ben bizimkilere bakacagým artýk :)|pg||
nt|akgun: 1d undo?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|barbyh: can they get to 4 sp|pg||
nt|mariner1: Last but not least, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Sharon Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no|pg||
nt|mariner1: broadcasts. Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: lovers worldwide!|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html  - Tournament site|pg||
nt|cindy: thx everyone !!   |pg||
nt|idblu: you really don't open that Martin...do you?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board of the match in this room now. Many thanks to our (unknown) operator in Yokohama. Fine job!|pg||
nt|snorris: obviously thought the lead was a singelton|pg||
nt|othered1: 1 big @C,preempt?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Last board just now and the Chinese Women have played well here I would say|pg||
nt|snorris: not 2 @s ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: relyably informed so|pg||
nt|snorris: well.. more to come for hackett then|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @s will be tried probably|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..so thanks to everyone in Japan|pg||
nt|marlowepi: last hand, restart in about half an hour i think|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well I take it all back ... if you can make 5Sx the biddings ok|pg||
nt|idblu: he played pard for the singleton|pg||
nt|cindy: Levin opened 3@s in the open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: south never did get a chance to determin if partner held @SK|pg||
nt|athene: 20 imps and it's hard to see a gain on this one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe the final lesson --- don't double 6@S when not sure of beating the escape|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 25 IMP swing it was. Lost 16, could have gained 9|pg||
nt|idblu: they shld pour cold water on their faces and relax before they go on tilt|pg||
nt|idblu: slam swings going the wrong way|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 3@h de kalýnýr gibi|pg||
nt|aruf: neyse herkese iyi akþamlar iyi briç seyirleri|pg||
nt|deniz_t: saol sana da yakýþýklý:)|pg||
nt|eccone: iyi aksamlar|pg||
nt|akgun: iyi aksamlar|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Marshall if you win your Vegas bet I need a bailout! :)|pg||
nt|idblu: or doubleton|pg||
nt|idblu: check here for results and info on the tournament  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest09/nec.html|pg||
nt|othered1: This has been a match of two separate sprints, so far, and Japan's result in the Open Room on this hand makes theirs likely to continue.|pg||
nt|xenya: so it looks like a potential gain for Japan|pg||
nt|vulkan: KG 3 @h yapabiliyor|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 1@c ten sonra zor|pg||
mb|4H|nt|othered1: And how high will east now go?|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our terrific operator,  well done,  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: perhaps..|pg||
nt|irwinbo: then there was no need to cash|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They can't afford a game swing here, that's almost certain|pg||
nt|othered1: east didn't have, or chose not to make a support double in the open room.|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H :)|pg||
nt|othered1: East is to blame for west having to defend 6N.  West misread the hand and I think had enough clues, assuming east's lead of 5th best was the correct spot to lead by their ...|pg||
nt|othered1: agreements|pg||
nt|idblu: have lost more than 40 imps being the wrong way on 3 slams|pg||
nt|santyclz: Now Fred, you know you can't admit we're rooting for CHINA Women.|pg||
nt|eccone: dbl|pg||
nt|eccone: ve neden 1@c|pg||
nt|eccone: sistemmi buda|pg||
mb|4N|nt|fabsayc: i am happy to pass east hand, way worse than that 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|cindy: yes  good job !|pg||
nt|sharkey: Operator - can you verify the score board 30 pls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i still like  make signals clear to partner -- @S10 was no help |pg||
nt|akgun: 1c yanlis |pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: 4 sp good save|pg||
nt|othered1: The Women's team has played rather soundly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pass?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and after te Excellent 4 spades here score now close|pg||
nt|yo_yo: opinions differ as the wisdom of responding 1@H here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d with the favourable @d split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S = 5@S 4+minor  and 4-10 HCP|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am told there is more excitement coming|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|b_eymen: güney için agresif bi açýþ|pg||
nt|deniz_t: bence 1@c doðru deklare nacizane|pg||
nt|akgun: yok boyle bir sey|pg||
mb|5C|nt|cindy: and thx to specs too   lots of good feedback|pg||
nt|snorris: interesting..|pg||
nt|idblu: yes...unusual high card shows higher suit...very simple|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and if DBL of 3@H made any sense -- then East 4@H seems automatic to me|pg||
nt|idblu: we are impartial...may the best woman win :)|pg||
nt|josj: they will reach 4@S, I think|pg||
nt|josj: E opened in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: what is it this time rob? grand theft tricycle?|pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|bg: open room still 4 boards behind|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D should be forcing here|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 15.boardda bizi kritik bir 5@s bekliyor daha|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: well here it is a singelton|pg||
nt|ralfwil: So what to do else than @sA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @cA!!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: in fact Oz may even be winning after the last hand|pg||
nt|snorris: good for n-s |pg||
nt|snorris: the limit it seems|pg||
nt|idblu: except that pard could get a ruff|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s lead is killing!|pg||
nt|athene: but del'monte is dead minimum for his 3@C and decides game just isn't there|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe East, but East did not help her partner one bit, and after all it's a partnership game|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: :) close, I do ride bicycles|pg||
nt|cindy: more congressive bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also thanks to our excellent commentators: Snorri, Carl, Tony and Ralf|pg||
nt|snorris: up with the king|pg||
nt|snorris: yes!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: dont think Paul will go -3 though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: WOW|pg||
nt|werge: @S-lead = game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe Ed I mean|pg||
nt|vulkan: 4@h den önce duramazlar heralde|pg||
nt|b_eymen: imkansýz|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: kesinlikle|pg||
nt|eccone: ortagýn 5li @s de kollamak icin dbl demek lazým 1@d acýsýndan sonra tabi|pg||
nt|eccone: tref partas olsa oda olucak |pg||
nt|eccone: q@d 2 li!k rua doru yerde tek|pg||
nt|eccone: @h atagýna kýsaldýgý icin declaran batýyor|pg||
nt|eccone: onada olur heralde|pg||
nt|akgun: eþit olur R sp tek oldugu icin|pg||
nt|eccone: olmaz|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: well the good news is 2@S is not in doubt here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So a maximum win for the seniors. You need 39 IMPs for 25-5 and this will likely be 25-4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Swiss format from round 2|pg||
nt|snorris: right lead this time..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: granted not perfect for double, but not forcing situation for me|pg||
nt|othered1: despite a style of opening very aggressively|pg||
nt|snorris: -2 likly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: too difficult to reach the slam then|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not much of a slam though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Kath|pg||
nt|caitlin: not sure why anyone would X this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- at equal vul  promised 55|pg||
nt|b_eymen: K@SA@s|pg||
nt|akgun: ayrica dam dia 2 li tabiki:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|idblu: I would want to be in game looking at all 4 hands...unlucky everything off|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to co commentator for hanging in until the end with me,  and to the other "co's"  on the way |pg||
nt|b_eymen: 3 nt ilginc olabilirdi ama|pg||
nt|b_eymen: @c|pg||
nt|eccone: @c i2 kere almayýnca batýyor|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cindy: ty Shirley ! :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: looks as if Wang rejected the 4-4 @S fit|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seemed to have judged well to land in a making contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also the NEC and all the folks who brought this terrific tourney to bbo |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to our very capable operator in Yokohama. Fine Job!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup might have made 11 tricks in 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: güneyin pas atýþýný görmeniz lazýmdý açtýðýna iþte o zaman piþman oldu gibi|pg||
nt|deniz_t: bu kontrat batabilir yada olabilir fakat bricde 3 löveli el devdir genç arkadaþlarým oysaki Güneyde 6 löve var:)|pg||
nt|akgun: 2. kore cakmasin oyleyse|pg||
nt|eccone: batmýyor|pg||
pc|cT|nt|shevek: Fruewirth was sure 3@d was forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They have been playing for a week and are very tired|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess the only things i agree with are:  2@C-2@D;2N-3@H   and  opening lead of @H [just not sure about which spot was right for partnership]|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree that east could have clarified freely with @SJ, but west still had count to disregard themessage.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: With the @HA onside there look to be 11 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|b_eymen: halbuki pas denizlse önce|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk4: Finally, thanks to NEC for sponsoring the event, and our appreciation to the JCBL for bringing this prestigious tournament to BBO vugraph. Akito Omasa has been instrumental in ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: setting up a fine show|pg||
nt|athene: but normally, you need about 17+ to double then bid a new suit, and 7 or 8+ for the free 3@C bid, so the situation can be treated as game-forcing|pg||
nt|santyclz: 10 tricks, next.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: i think the idea is just to make sure you get a plus in those situations|pg||
nt|irwinbo: you don't need a ruff to beat it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @c shift for -2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But I would like to go back to the double of 6@S. That caused the misery for poor West|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a lot of finesses to take|pg||
nt|othered1: I like that defense|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or not to take (spades)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Bruce Gowdy also,  |pg||
nt|idblu: greed is a terrible thing|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: once again EW win the bidding..|pg||
nt|irwinbo: thanks all|pg||
nt|cindy: ty :)   next set in 25 min ?|pg||
nt|idblu: thanks everyone ...see you at about 10:20|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thanks to everyone in Japan, back soon I believe|pg||
nt|idblu: EST|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes indeed|pg||
nt|b_eymen: sonra sonsuza kadar konusabilirdi|pg||
nt|b_eymen: önce alttan almak lazým|pg||
nt|b_eymen: açýslarda özellikle|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sharkey: wud be surprised if anyone bids it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now W wanted to bee a little bit higher|pg||
nt|ahollan1: always nice to have a flat hand after that kind of rollercoaster ride :(|pg||
nt|idblu: why switch to the @D at tr 2...pard led @H, return @H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|snorris: should be -1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and to our many excellent commentators |pg||
nt|xenya: i would think twice before biddin 2N as W|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has frue shown an acol 2 in @D?|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: bu maclardan sonra yemek arasi var diye biliyorum|pg||
pc|c5|nt|idblu: they have to get the @C switch tho to beat 4....|pg||
nt|eccone: 2 tref verince batýyo zannediyorum|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dK and @cK and @c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: -1|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: careful defense needed vs 4 spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But it´s only on a finess. Have played worse|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes and then I would hope to think for a third time|pg||
nt|xenya: a @H lead would have defeated 2N?|pg||
nt|eccone: baska biþiy vermiyo zaten|pg||
nt|deniz_t: bekleyelim bence:)|pg||
nt|akgun: 2. kore bir defos yapmasi gerekiyor|pg||
nt|eccone: bencede hersey olabilir|pg||
nt|eccone: onada gerek yok rehacým|pg||
nt|akgun: artik sinekleri birakiyor karolara girmesi gerekir|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sharkey: yes - in 7 NT once off 3 aces|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Finally, thanks to NEC for sponsoring the event, and our appreciation to the JCBL for bringing this prestigious tournament to BBO vugraph. Akito Omasa has been instrumental in ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: setting up a fine show|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks everyone   and  order some sleeping pills Paul|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thx all and bye for now|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ty all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
nt|mpny: take care all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thanks all. And have a nice thursday|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some call that treatment Muiderberg Twos, some Tartan Twos -- i'm not possitive about the differences|pg||
nt|idblu: here's a slam their way...win 10-11|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: think he is still "lurking" in here with us |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Put in @s9 on a @s from table and you can have a @h ruff  after @d to A|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East should really play the 9 on the first round of trumps perhaps|pg||
pc|sA|nt|frankaus: welcome roland |pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently the ladies have a 0.5 imp carryover|pg||
nt|werge: But decklarer might have a problem if North shifts to a @H|pg||
nt|werge: How to get the @S K?|pg||
nt|athene: it was a LOT easier for E-W in the other room|pg||
nt|eccone: karo karo ceksin|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well maybe|pg||
nt|cindy: what else ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: more likely declarer tries for spade king onside|pg||
nt|fabsayc: tartan is more 55|pg||
nt|othered1: Since it was east, with the @H void, who doubled 4@H, it must have been a "table action."  Or maybe south's auction was too tempting|pg||
nt|athene: because north didn't raise over the double|pg||
nt|santyclz: We, I mean they, are on the right side of the slam swing this time.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: South will not enjoy his discards|pg||
nt|josj: he does not know N holds @D stopper as well|pg||
nt|vulkan: biz tükler biraz üstten oynamayý seviyoruz heralde :)|pg||
nt|vulkan: türkler|pg||
nt|akgun: evet haklisin eymen|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Hello|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 28 IMP swing it was actually. 6NT would have been 2 down if West had picthed a heart in the end-game. 12 in instead of 16 out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D9 -- another unclear discard :(|pg||
nt|b_eymen: ewet kart oyunu böle geliþir denilir hep :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: Clone  4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: also tartan 2 bids are much older, i think proposed first in the 1960's|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, the @H shift is needed to hold|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mcarroll: @D shift, @HQ lead, but certainly not obvious|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 10 tricks are certain 11 will depend on South hanging on to his clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he will surely do that looking a dummy|pg||
nt|akgun: simdi guneyin yuzu guldu|pg||
nt|eccone: cakmasýn|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Play will resume in about 20 minutes with a match from round 4. Welcome back then|pg||
nt|vulkan: normal deklere verip fazla yapmaya çalýþsak olmaz ý :)|pg||
nt|b_eymen: bence mahsuru yok|pg||
nt|akgun: dam dia yi ikliden almayida becerebilirse eþit olacak|pg||
nt|eccone: öbr pikide cekerse batar|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|idblu: yes the China Women teams way|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cindy: thx Bruce :)|pg||
nt|bg: still not clear wher number nine coming from|pg||
nt|cindy: yes   israel lucky to have a chance here|pg||
nt|cindy: i cant see 9|pg||
nt|bg: S has to win and play clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: or a @D followed by a @H from S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but East finds best shift|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bg: if he ducks ninth trick comes in hearts|pg||
nt|bg: if NS are using udca  S should have played dia deuce to first trick|pg||
nt|athene: people often laugh at these terrible raises but they do inconvenience opps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: jJ@D now?|pg||
nt|roswolf: HEART MORE LIKELY|pg||
nt|chessmaste: That would make life easy for South|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|idblu: that is the % play|pg||
nt|cindy: yep|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the 1nt -1 a push so all on this hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cindy: g'night all |pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks all|pg||
nt|idblu: thx Cindy, Martin....witching hour here and 6AM comes early :)|pg||
nt|idblu: gn all :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i don't book myself for single digit hours|pg||
nt|idblu: good habit|pg||
nt|snorris: well done hackett|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so an uneventful match with thie Hacket team sneeking home|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thanks Tony, Hans and Snorri. Nice to work with you|pg||
nt|snorris: thx|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so thanks to everyone in Japan, more exciting bridge to come shortly|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: bye for now|pg||
nt|petergill: We believe the adjusted score to 2200 on Bd 7 was because, with screens in use, South gave West a misleading explanation which affected West's decision to remove 2@SXX. |pg||
nt|othered1: That's a funny-looking trick|pg||
nt|thommos: undo?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cindy: too bad|pg||
nt|thommos: yes that was an undo!|pg||
nt|idblu: thanks again everyone...see you tomorrow :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks all and bye!|pg||
nt|bg: Thx all bye|pg||
nt|idblu: more tournament later tonight/morning/afternoon|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@D may also have been equal level correction bid - meaning 3@D not forcing|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to say "2@H won't stop E-W getting to game" but it just did|pg||
pc|d2|nt|idblu: assess the blame...MSC |pg||
nt|eccone: battý|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|cindy: or clown|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: oh dear|pg||

nt|chessmaste: another IMP goes East|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

pc|s9|nt|mcarroll: Yes and they pushed to 3@S in Open |pg||

mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: i remember writeup of tartan in New Zealand or Australian mag from late 60s/early 70s -- so Martin is spot on|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the Dutch inching back|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: övünç  kritik mi:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: the underdog cardinals made a big comeback to go ahead with 2 minutes left only to lose on a last ditch rally by pittsburgh in the u.s. football super bowl|pg||
nt|chessmaste: This does not look like a thriller - unless they overbid|pg||
nt|eccone: ne yapacaklarýný degil nasýl olacaklarýný anlatýyoruz|pg||
mb|2C!|an|gf|nt|yo_yo: but East made a free bid  |pg||
nt|idblu: the China Women have played flawless to date....unfortunate 1 bad result so costly|pg||
nt|idblu: another slam....|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, I'm trying to figure a way other than a full relay system to get there.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And besides they dont have a Santonio to perform miracles|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: bu el kritik|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 5@s nasýl gitmisler acep|pg||

mb|2D|an|limite el|nt|shevek: ah well, the penultimate board as Rob likes to say...|pg||
nt|athene: even if N-S double E-W in 2@S here for 470 that just isn't enough|pg||

nt|yo_yo: liu didnt even stop to think :)|pg||
nt|josj: Pik ist der Feind der Ohne|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: oh well she wouldnt |pg||
nt|petergill: Wang Hong Li's light Precision 1@d opening at the other table made game harder to reach there. |pg||
nt|chessmaste: This will clinch it for China|pg||
nt|petergill: but a spade switch?|pg||
nt|josj: still on time|pg||

mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: system and North's 4-suit overcall create this swing -- whichever way it goes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told Muiderberg comes from The Netherlands|pg||
nt|geller: 4 imps to the Dutch for responding 2@s rather than 3@s to a transfer with @sAKJT  @hKJxx  @Dxxx @cKQ|pg||
nt|xenya: the 4-1 @H split might kill this?|pg||
nt|idblu: 8 solid + another trick = slam|pg||

nt|ovncylmz: heyecanla karisik ozguven desek?|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: Now up to north to get a large swing back, evening thematch.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Once again, I'm not sure it can be beaten.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Great lead.|pg||
nt|b_eymen: böyle bir @h rengi varken @s oynamaya calýsmamak lazým|pg||
nt|b_eymen: hocam siz ne düsünüyosunuz?|pg||
nt|deniz_t: :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 1@D either denies 4-card Major -- or has strong hand|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 3kore 3sp denmemeli mi?|pg||
nt|b_eymen: evet|pg||
nt|b_eymen: ortak pik var diyor|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: 3karoya dblin karolar oldugunu dusunmuyorum burda|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 1@d actý zaten pas derdi|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: evet|pg||
nt|b_eymen: rakip@h@c var derken bu @s olur |pg||

mb|p|nt|geller: It'S all Larry's fault!|pg||
nt|vulkan: katýlýyorum|pg||
nt|vulkan: 4-4 her zaman faydalý deðil|pg||
nt|b_eymen: simdi 3@s denilirse pas pas pas gidebilir|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: yes, i am told, but not this team|pg||
nt|athene: well the 1@C opener makes it easy to place cards|pg||
nt|yo_yo: anyway they are playing fantastically well|pg||
nt|shevek: well done girls|pg||
nt|athene: only 18 hcp missing|pg||
nt|shevek: they did play well|pg||
nt|santyclz: The old-fashioned way.  Bid what you think you can make.|pg||
nt|petergill: It's normal to knock out @HA first, no reason to play on @D|pg||
nt|josj: sure...|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Now North has a chance to shine|pg||
nt|josj: N should not duck twice|pg||
nt|vulkan: þimdiki gibi uzun renge çakýlma tehliksi de var|pg||
nt|b_eymen: evet|pg||
nt|b_eymen: woow|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: bence su an masada 3@dnin anlami tartisiliyor perdenin iki tarafinda da|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: If North ducks, is there a case to switch to @D, with North marked with @HA, and South more likely to have longer @S?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|b_eymen: @s zaten bizim yan renk|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: wow|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: but the @CA is right, so perhaps it can be made|pg||
nt|werge: No - he can play for tje 10 of @D coming down - and only loose 3 black tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: in theory at least|pg||
nt|sharkey: they also had their share of the luck - but so do good teams|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: diger masada oyun bitti|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: az sonra oldukca kalabalik olacagiz|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: :)|pg||
nt|ovncylmz: senkronizasyon problemi oldu diyebiliriz|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jaapfr: was it a low level cuebid 3@D??|pg||
nt|eccone: yarýn VG 11:00 de baslýyacak|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|geller: If Furuta gets out with a @d here EW have lots of work to do and not many entries|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best is a third round of @s|pg||
nt|shevek: So Japan Open vs China Women in tomorrow's final|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now|pg||
nt|josj: what else, in view of dummy?|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spade is unlikely i think|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ovncylmz: kenan 3karonun anlami ile ilgili konusmalar oldu mu?|pg||
nt|eccone: oyuncularýn sistemleri hakkýnda bilgimiz olmadýgý iciin her eliistenildigi yorumlayamýyoruz,|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: Italian Blue Team had philosphy about auctions like this ---  Double and LEAD TRUMP|pg||
nt|shevek: that'll be in 13 hours time|pg||
nt|athene: wasn't it Greg Norman who, when congratulated by a spectator for a "lucky" long putt, said "it's funny, the more i practice, the luckier i get"|pg||
nt|yo_yo: shame the times arent good for the UK|pg||
nt|b_eymen: q@c|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: 1N alerted because MAY hold one or both 4-card majors|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H |pg||
nt|eccone: istenildigi gibi |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|werge: Not best for declarer...|pg||
nt|idblu: N played for a 9 trick hand and got it|pg||
nt|b_eymen: wd|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wygbe1: mini splinter showing values for a raise to 3s, with stiff d|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|roswolf: well that settles it|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 3@d ikisinede fit var heralde|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petergill: Ino, who won the World Senior Teams in Beijing last year, is in another gripping Final right now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: and now E can see that @d10 must be 10xx|pg||
nt|xenya: he will make it now i think|pg||
nt|xenya: the actual distribution seems to be about the only one that allows to make, and he will figure it out |pg||
nt|ralfwil: and that is 10xx in @d|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: but there seeems to be no other chance|pg||
nt|geller: but can't Chen keep @s and @ca and win the last two tricks?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes the @D9 looked like an unlikely winner - can it be a beer card game?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: there is another too, that S has @c AQJx|pg||
nt|xenya: close your eyes, cash 4 @Ds and take a @C finesse|pg||
nt|geller: that's right.  no other chance.  |pg||
nt|athene: i am told it was gary player not greg norman..but the same thing applies to bridge|pg||
nt|athene: if a team is playing really well they often look lucky|pg||
nt|athene: because they take maximum advantage of any good fortunate they get|pg||
nt|petergill: One board to go. |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Once the heart  held declarer should probably have played a diamond - still she can smile now|pg||
nt|b_eymen: kuzeyin as girmesi laazým tabi|pg||
nt|vulkan: G de K de tempoda 1er kez atladýlar|pg||

pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: For full vugraph schedule, please go to http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  and bookmark it!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for people who play 1@C-1M may have equal or Longer @D -- make sure you know strength of hand when 1@D bid DOES include 4-card major|pg||
nt|othered1: @H pitches from dummy may have told west something, but declarer can always guess right from here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not nearly enough partnerships discuss that!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|idblu: if the hand only worth one bid, bypassing @D's the norm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: default is usually 1@D with 4-card major ONLY IF game force, but some will say INV+|pg||
pc|c7|nt|santyclz: As Walter Johnson points out, a trump lead, always an option on this type of auction, would beat it.|pg||
