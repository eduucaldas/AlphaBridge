nt|Walddk2: But he asked me to get commentators, and I got 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so no worries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: all will be fine. starting in 2 hours and 40 mins right?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi All and Welcome to the 4th Vasil Levski Cup 2009, Karlovo, Bulgaria|pg||

nt|mariner1: Points 8 rounds of 3 boards each in two 12 board sessions.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Our commentators for 1st 12 boards are Mike Gold, Mike Graham, Martin Carroll,|pg||
nt|mariner1: David Edwin , and Roland Wald (Denmark)........... I am Rob Brown (USA)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good aftenoon all|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Mike, David|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi this is Mike from UK|pg||
nt|ady: hi Martin    Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi David|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I hope the screen is well hidden from the players. For security reasons, we usually do not display a board until all players are seated|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is all very confusing|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Roland and hi Mike|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like it takes a @H lead to beat 6 hearts here, not that you want to be in slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: except it makes if no @H lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hey Rob!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is matchpointed pairs, so every trick counts|pg||
nt|vugraphzjw: after few words for openning we are ready to start :) hello everybody|pg||
nt|ady: can actually make on a heart lead as well    set up diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Momchil Aleksandrov. Welcome to you too|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well requiringvery good behaviour in both red suits it should not really be bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C also can make here|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Momchil, could we have player names up, please|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 6N only depends on J hearts dropping and diamond fin esse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Click on each seat in turn and insert last name|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: but they ve stopped in a safe and sensible 3n which makes on any layout|pg||
nt|ady: any slam will require some luck|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But at matchpoints 4@H for once scores better|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mcarroll: as pointed out on a non @H lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: not if a @H is led though|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: do uthink there is any reason for anyone to be even trying for a slam here unless they are badl;y in need of mps!!|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|d6|pc|h7|pg||

nt|lestergold: wasnt best mp technique here but doesnt mattera s dim wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzjw: moment for thinking... the player in position N is the major sponsor of the tournament|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mariner1: 3N reasonable spot yet not likely to score well|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|mariner1: right however a few will be in 4@H somehow too|pg||

nt|mdgraham: interesting 1NT opening - 1@S certainly an alternative |pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|mcarroll: 1NT not my first choice as opening bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 8 likely tricks in 1N|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mariner1: those opening 1@S will get some competition likely|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|lestergold: will probably score better than 2s which on most defences will be held to 8 tricks too|pg||

nt|mariner1: 17 and a 5 bagger a tad strong for most however likely to work here|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d5|pc|sT|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|ady: I think over  powerful for 1 no-trump|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: match points a funny game reward for staying out of ur solid 9 card major fit|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

pc|c2|pc|d4|pg||

nt|lestergold: but it brings in the bacon here rabbi!|pg||
pc|d6|mc|8|nt|ady: as it happens may score well   most likely to score only 110 in spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - four card support but no ruffing values |pg||
pg||

mb|1D|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ady: 3 club opening might cause problems|pg||
nt|mariner1: W pass is conservsative however he is RED vs White|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well 3d looks like the limit for N/S e/w may have difficulties in 3h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well not doubled so one off scores better than 3d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Karlovo is a picturesque and a historically important town in central Bulgaria located in a fertile valley along the river Stryama at the southern foot of the Balkan Mountains|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: nice spot|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H or Karlovo?|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs  to prevent spades being riffed while maintaining control against the club suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D and a @H switch best defense|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: you mean miffed?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: hm not best |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: helping declarer!!|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|h2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: hah and north cant even over ruff next spade|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: e/w gonna earn a few mps here i think|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|h7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: earn may be a bit of a misnomer?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now a club saves tyeh trump loser|pg||
nt|mariner1: can he see to ruff @c high here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes he will surely ruff high|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Why did North not overruff he must ask himself|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So should get it right|pg||
nt|mariner1: he should know N does not have Q@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: and knows north cant overruff the 8 hearts!|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|c2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: strange play|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c3|pc|d8|pc|hT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bridge is a game of errors |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|c4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: not ruffing high cost him two tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How many tables in play, Momchil?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are waiting for everyone to finish before they can move for round 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzjw: 5 minutes break for calculating results|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3 board rounds two each 4 round sessions|pg||
nt|vugraphzjw: this is swiss movement, so from now we will be watching the best ranked pairs on vu|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Monchil!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 30½ tables I am told|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meanwhile, it will please Rob to hear that Collingwood is on 92|pg||
nt|mariner1: are we fishing again?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Make that 96|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and Bopara 62* :) he used to play for my club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and out  :(|pg||
nt|henryb: I offer the panel a bidding problem while we wait -- and I would be glad to hear from specs also|pg||
nt|ady: the bidding will likely be different at other tables    a likely 3@C opeming    then 3@D    east may be reluctant to enter  after a pre-empt from partner     3@D  can make|pg||
nt|vugraphzjw: Bulgaria is just to celebrate the National holiday - Karlovo is the place where the national hero Vasil Levski is born|pg||
nt|henryb: Playing "Bridge World Standard" you hold @sJ92 @h AKQ54 @d 86 @c J92 |pg||
nt|vugraphzjw: the tournament is named after him|pg||
nt|henryb: Partner opens 1@d and rebids 1@s over your 1@h response. Your bid:|pg||
nt|lestergold: why do u think west didnt open with 3 c it would be textbook by today's standards even at unfavourable|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially at mps|pg||
nt|lestergold: i.e. with the room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: IMPs Henry?|pg||
nt|henryb: imps, vulnerable|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@c would be game forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tough hand. I think I will settle for 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: if west does open 3 clubs and north 3@D    if east passes  would south try 3@S?  if so getting over the top|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A little heavy, 1 heart short though|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Collingwood out for 96|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would like to bid 2c encouraging but if its forcing i have to lie a little and keep biddding open with 1N hoping to hear more from partner|pg||
nt|lestergold: and if he passes ill probably make thru weight of high cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Your hand may be dead in notrumps|pg||
nt|henryb: So far, offered 1N, 2@h, 2N, 3@h|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H is safer, 2N is aggressive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must be played in  hearts|pg||
nt|henryb: offer of 2@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes best of a bad job but if my hand is unsuitable then partner weill probably have more to say if he passes likely to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s not in a million years i have to hjave 4 to raise second suit one of my absolutes|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S likely to get you to wrong spot...... but so is 2N........|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You have a lousy NT hand if partner has a singleton heart. That's why it must be played in hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n ridiculouus with jxx club|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h i eliminaste as too strong but too few hearts|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I go for a pretty pusillanimous 2@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N is only choice other than 2@H to me,,,,,,, 2@H is the safe call|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4153  which is quite likely, NT is bad|pg||
nt|henryb: thats spelled Rydykulus, Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: i am bad roland but of all the lies one is forced to tell i prefer 1n|pg||
nt|lestergold: ok henry hit usw with the solution!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I will pretend that I have a 6th heart because of the suit quality|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H is not really a lie,,,,, all the others are|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am in fantasy land with Roland :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I know some who would settle for a very slow raise to 2@S, just to let partner know that it's a three-trump raise :(|pg||
nt|henryb: I don't have a solution; it is from an upcoming BW Master Solvers|pg||
nt|lestergold: you will often be a lot weaker for 2h partner is nmot going to take u for an eleven count you have ca borderline opener|pg||
nt|mcarroll: good problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2h likely to miss a lot of games - sure probably make it if its passed but 1n leaves partner with space to provide more info on non minimum hands|pg||
nt|henryb: I must cofess I answered 1N, feeling that this is not an "11 count" when partner is likely to be short in @h|pg||
nt|mariner1: you might be better off bidding 3N and hope it STUNS the opponents :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: someone is as bad a sme lets shout itr for a no trump henry!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What happened to that spellung course you were going to attend, Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: if u did thatr and i was commentating i would be stunnede and id ask rolands permission to c all the bid bonkers|pg||
nt|henryb: the two jacks are not that valuable. of course maybe partner will rebid 2@h over 1N, and I can bid 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjw: the break will last a little bit longer, in order to allow players to become familiar with the movement which is not that usual for Bulgaria|pg||
nt|lestergold: i teach english believe it or not to oxford and cambidge entry standard|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i did in the past|pg||
nt|lestergold: before word procesors invented|pg||
nt|mariner1: what do the English know about English? :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what do they know of England, who only England know? |pg||
nt|lestergold: not a lot which is whjy our literature drama and tv is the worlds worst|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge.bg/en_UK/tournament21.html  - Tournament Site|pg||
nt|lestergold: i have large clumsy hands good for playing beethoven piano conceri but bad for typing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A spectator tells me that the Martens Transfer Checkback would solve the problem Henry gave us. He bids 2@C as a transfer to diamonds, then 2@H, invitational with 5 hearts. Fine ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: gadget here|pg||
nt|henryb: Okay; problem 2: @s AQ10xxx @hAxx @dQJ9x @c none; imps, both vul 1@s-2H-X-P-??|pg||
nt|mariner1: problem is that is not Bridge World Standard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H|pg||
nt|henryb: Others suggested XYZ using 2@c as game invitational and 2@d as gf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3½@D|pg||
nt|henryb: also not BWS|pg||
nt|lestergold: i have 6 spades and 13 points i show my sixth spade before i bid d at three level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3½@D is the best bid because it keeps all options open|pg||
nt|henryb: I think 3+spimonds is probably right|pg||
nt|lestergold: no best bid is 2 spiamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzjw: we were asked from the sponsot to use his BBO nicj :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: avoids the fraction|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mariner1: couple of @H right place here|pg||
nt|ady: south will surely back in with 2 spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s a neg double doesnt promise the earth partner can speak again if he has game going vaslues|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I doubt that Petrov and Lazarov are still at this table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South might have come in with 2@S there|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: iu would hope so unless hes from gthe chicken ranch|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: directly over 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3@H is fortunate that @H are 3 3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: it seems a bit supine at pairs to pass 2@S, but East might have tried 3@D |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h lookis like a comfortable make especially on lead now probably 4|pg||
nt|ady: again a top heavy open 1 no-trump     3@H  very risky   and if going to have another stab should try 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do agree david and if they are playing 15-17 NT , ther eis no such bid as a downvalued 18 count|pg||

nt|vugraphzjw: under zero degrees here|pg||

nt|mariner1: vs a forcing @c I prefer some form of multiple suit interference, such as CRASH or|pg||

nt|ady: I assume a 2 club opening by e/w is systemic  showing clubs  so they have no differential of 1club being 16+   and a giant that west had|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Walter Johnson is in the audience. Walter, would 3@H be forcing for Meckwell on this auction, or would they double?|pg||

nt|henryb: Why do people sacrifice the natural 2N when a cue bid is available?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A Yarborough is a hand with no card higher than a nine spot. The term is derived from Lord Yarborough of England, who offered a wager with odds of 1,000 pounds to one against the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: chance of any player having such a holding. The actual chance of any player holding a hand with no card higher than a nine has been mathematically equated to 1,827 to 1|pg||

nt|ndemirev: before last round, e-w had 30pts less than NS (top 29) so not it should be about equal|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: it is reasonable to bid slams somewhat aggressively at IMPs because they are big-ticket items. but at MPs there are many ways to win. 4 making 6 may already be a good score|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is close to dead average yet a point or 2 likely to be made more either way|pg||
