mb|2C|mb|p|nt|jtr: Then the Chinese gained 50 IMPs|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: welcome back everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Start with a slam|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: north has a huge hand for a Precision 1@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Tough to bid though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: They have put together some massive sets over the years - I remember a 76-0 demolition in one of the Venice Cup matches|pg||
nt|athene: south will be thinking of 6@H now|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: so is North, by the look of it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: hi Peter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@H may well be doubled for a spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the normal way to show a void in response to RKCB was to bid 5NT with an even number of keycards|pg||
nt|jtr: Not so tough for these ladies it seems|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Strong Club|pg||
nt|petergill: hence 3@H, since 1@H was 11-15|pg||
nt|athene: i thought 6@D would show a diamond void and an ODD number of keycards|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: which will not, unfortunately, do any good |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|athene: well, i am sure they know what they are doing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I'd have doubled for a spade lead, and would be -1210|pg||
nt|athene: even without a spade fit, north has the most she can possibly have for 1@H, so as soon as her partner shows any slam interest, she is going there|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid, 4NT RKCB, 6@D two key cards plus @D void. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: the @CQ is a bonus|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: 6@d = @d void with 2 or 3 keycards.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: thirteen tricks now if she wants them|pg||
nt|jtr: 2 OR 3 seems odd|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that seems a bit silly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doesn't seem a bit silly - seems totally unplayable|pg||
nt|athene: you might easily be missing a grand slam with south showing 2 or 3 keycards|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: i think so too, but that's what explained.|pg||
nt|petergill: Without @CQ in her side suit (source of tricks), South would not have encouraged a slam - she would have bid 4@h instead of 4@D. |pg||
nt|athene: if you are ever going to have ambiguous responses they have to be widely differentiated so partner knows what you have|pg||
nt|athene: hence 0 or 3 keycards, 1 or 4|pg||
nt|jtr: Sensible lead in a way|pg||
nt|jtr: East knows South is likely to have only 2 or 3 trumps and the ruff may be important|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if there was any significance in west's failure to double diamond bids|pg||
nt|athene: forcing dummy might well be right to prevent the establishment of a black suit|pg||
nt|jtr: South responded 2@c next door and they were much better placed|pg||
nt|athene: i try to persuade my partners not to lead trumps against small slams|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: the only excuse for so doing is it's right :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: Both teams of six not surprisingly have their top four players in action for this vital last 16 boards of the grand final|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jtr: Concerned about 4-1 @cs|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jtr: yes i thought she might do that|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|jtr: Leaves options open and may be important for a squeeze|pg||

nt|petergill: Latin team) missed the Finals by 1 imp in the NEC Cup.     |pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: west had a choice of cue-bids here to show diamond support - 2@H or 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: some people would always cue in the suit they hold strength|pg||
nt|athene: (so @SA means 2@S)|pg||
nt|athene: but another consideration is that you want to make the cue which can't be natural|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. west can't have a great hand with spades (no 1@S overcall)|pg||
nt|athene: but she MIGHT have a great hand with hearts|pg||

pc|h6|nt|vugrapha2: Michael Seamon flasecards on most hands as declarer but has kept the @D8 here|pg||

nt|othered1: In a vacuum, you're right.  Perhaps at the table, too.|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure - being in 2@H.  2nd Overtrick may have vanished if !10 didnt drop or if N had last @H|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: @D10|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|vugrapha2: Tough hand for East here|pg||
nt|othered1: Aggressive double by Cayne here|pg||

mb|2H|nt|mmmakela: our tourneys are 80% pairs|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: I dont think anyone has done anything too wrong to arrive at an ordinary contract on this board|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|othered1: 4@S isn't very ordinary looking to me and could get killed.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Strange - where Gower bid 5@S and we analysed to death the other table 4@S x +1|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wonder why McGann did not bid 1 @H then ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: think 4@Ss is automatic|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: that expains it|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sharkey: not my guess of final contract....|pg||
pc|h2|nt|me argent: of course making it is something else|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Smells like -1 for a push|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Always fascinated at this level when one table gets to 4@S and the other play in 2@D|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|sharkey: IMPs to McGann here I think|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sunsamvar: yes they wud have gained 8 imps instead of losing 11|pg||
nt|robinswr: the 3club opener stole the pot|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|d3|pg||

mb|3S|nt|vugrapha2: All four of these players were in Australia to compete in the Yeh Cup|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Cayne still has a nice lead with one board to go in this quarter, mostly on board 2, where declarer here found a way to go down in 3N,it appears.|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|othered1: Yes, winning judgment by Cayne, in a position where Weinstein bid 4|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Heart pick will be crucial either finesse follows to make|pg||
nt|othered1: And south is essentially endplayed as declarer may need one more entry to dummy than he has available|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|dburn: winning is as winning does - could not Weinstein have made four?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mmmakela: so however ashamed you are with your E opening NEVER pass here, pd could have 15+ points with hearts|pg||
