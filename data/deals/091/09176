mb|p|mb|1N|nt|janm: Shall I start making bad predictions? P-1NT-something for majors-and NS will end in 2@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: Bertheau disappoints me - I thought for sure he'd show majors |pg||
nt|bg: predict Geoff Ogilvie will win todays golf tournament|pg||
nt|janm: Who's Geoff Ogilvie?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4 & 3|pg||
nt|bg: well known Australian|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17  [but 1st seat Fav  9-12]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS playing a big club|pg||
pc|h3|nt|janm: So in 1NT, E has 1 spade, 2 hearts, 3 diamonds - I don't see a 7th, does anyone else?|pg||
nt|bg: how about 4 dia|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: no @C lead -- proves Bertheau isn't peeking|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|janm: Ah, you're right, the 10 of diamonds will be the 7th trick|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: and with @HA gone -- easy transportation|pg||

pc|c4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bg: declarer has to test dia first k-A with this type of holding see if J does drop|pg||
pc|s6|nt|janm: So this will be a double partscore swing to add to the Netherlands' lead|pg||

pc|d3|nt|xenya: well even if penalty, it's not exactly clear-cut|pg||
nt|pelu: so we can bid free against u?|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol Peter|pg||
nt|cicus: no, we reopen with a X|pg||
nt|cicus: bid your shortest suit and you are saved|pg||
nt|pelu: u are forced to X gain? - then S can bid 2@S on a big hand!|pg||
nt|hedyg: if NT is 12-14 N must have A@c and K@H|pg||
nt|cicus: no we are not in a forcing situation after 1NT X|pg||
nt|cicus: rule is: don't pass if we may have game|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim 10?|pg||
nt|pelu: but then West has to take some action - he cant just wait and "hope" that pd we X again|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game forcing relay --- having @C suit is cooincidence|pg||

nt|janm: Drijver taking out insurance in case the club was a stiff. He'll pull trump and then knock out the club K and eventually come to 10 tricks I think|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: Sorry, they haven't written anything down and was talking quietly so couldn't get the explanation of 2@C|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|cicus: that is close to what we do|pg||
nt|hedyg: as takeout of course|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Terrible 6@d with 1 redeaming feature: it can make|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|viren169: then I am a simple soul!|pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't bother looking for a 5-3 major fit with that west hand|pg||
nt|athene: N-S are likely to power into 4@H here|pg||
nt|santyclz: N's @ss are more valuable on offense than he anticipates.|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: 4333 and plenty of hcp|pg||
nt|athene: well, there are ways 4@H might make|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: after @SA lead, though, west can see the necessity of a fast diamond switch|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|pelu: when u X before the suit: X is values - when u X after the suit more penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: I agree|pg||
nt|athene: even if you find partner with a 5-card major there's no guarantee it will be better than 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3 @c asks for majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3nt No 5 card no 4 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 2@D=any game force|pg||
nt|viren169: although if pd has 5233 shape 4@S may be better...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i don't see much downside to 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@D = 2-3-5-3 - no 3 card @S|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: now @DA and @D10 should fall out of his hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: declarer will surely play the clubs the right way, to protect the @SQx|pg||
nt|athene: lead @CA then @CJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: He will protect the @s Q so will guess @c|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|cicus: one way of two-way checkback|pg||
nt|xenya: may be an exact tie after this board|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|viren169: nice play|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|cicus: not now, S encouraged clubs|pg||
nt|athene: now @DK then diamond to the ace|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|athene: just in case south has a singleton @DJ/@D10|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: three discards are no use; the club finesse can't be avoided|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|pelu: no - 2Nt is also 2-3-5-3 - but a bad @D-suit|pg||
nt|athene: then the layout is revealed and you can take the finesse|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 2+@C BAL (12-14 or 18-20) or 12+ 4+@C unbal|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: If the cards had been a little different, 4@s might have needed a non-heart lead, but with North having all the entries, I guess it was in fact colc|pg||
nt|bg: nice spade slam can be beaten with a heart lead|pg||
nt|janm: or even cold|pg||
nt|janm: It's really the 4-1 spade break that beats this, isn't it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL probably 4@S -- but just guessing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry 4+@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|janm: There was a hand the last set where it looked as if they weren't on the same wavelength about whether they still played transfers after 1@c was overcalled, so I'm not certain|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Drijver really needs to know about @DQ or Brink about singleton @C to bid more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why 4@S instead of 3@S which must be forcing after 2@H|pg||
nt|janm: I think that 4@s probably shows the very good spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yeah -- or no minor controls|pg||
nt|bg: if they bid this slam it will probably make since North not likely to lead a heart|pg||
nt|janm: Seems as if a high club is pretty normal, the heart might even give up a trick if the cards were different.|pg||
nt|janm: I think he can actually make it even on a heart lead - squeeze-endplay North. But probably wouldn't play for that|pg||
nt|janm: In the CR, East passed over 4@s on the same auction as we're seeing here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good catch Jan!|pg||
nt|janm: My husband points out that as both of these teams are 4-handed, there's $10,000 at stake for each player for winning this match|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bg: right squeeze endplay would work we all see that but would decarer;))|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i honestly can't remember ever executing a strip-squeeze [that worked] at that the table :(|pg||
nt|janm: What do you all think - should Drijver have bid more?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|athene: 1@C P 1@H now east should bid 2@D i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 14 board match is starting|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|athene: when it comes to overcalling, a good suit compensates for anything|pg||
nt|viren169: or 3@D... not for the faint-hearted!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|santyclz: X or 1@s?|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: of course if north just bids 3nt that might shut east out :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: No chance...|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S looks normal to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: if you are 2-3-4-4  you open 1@C and rebid 3@D over 2@D to show that shape|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1@C - then u bid 3@D on 2-3-4-4, and 2NT on 2-3-3-5 and bad suit, 3@C on an good suit|pg||
nt|viren169: North saw it coming!|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT Jordan, showing a sound raise to 3@D|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: sensible bid from west|pg||
nt|athene: with 5-loser hand|pg||
nt|athene: nothing to the play:- one trick to lose in each major|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how anyone can be considering doing anything over 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the thing about bashing 3nt in here is, you don't especially want to shut out east from mentioning a long suit|pg||
nt|athene: because he is on lead anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: small diamond|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Sry for the delay (connection problems)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: this is the north final championship, final 4 3 matches 20 boards each|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: so cannot differentiate between 2 3 4 4 and 2 2 4 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2245 is not a balanced hand|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@C then 3@D looks 2245 to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's semi-balanced|pg||
nt|pelu: no I dont like to open 1NT with 2-2 i major|pg||
nt|hedyg: you would not bid 1NT after 1@C-1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: interesting that both north players doubled|pg||
nt|santyclz: N could be considering a x on the empirical unlikelihood of 1 side making 11 tricks on any given hand.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: yes, small diamond was definitely preferable with no entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: agree not the best lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a different auction perhaps top diamond correct|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here next to zero chance north has only 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: true, 11 tricks is a lot|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: 3nt shows a very balanced hand for most people so East knows it's overwhelmingly unlikely N-S have 2-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: now declarer can succeed by playing on hearts.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: declarer is likely to put east with a top heart though|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: since otherwise why not a small diamond lead? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: think he will play for @c...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: so he might decide to pin his hopes on the clubs behaving|pg||
nt|viren169: normal to play on clubs and d1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: yes - and have to tell "a story" after 2@D - but no system get 100%|pg||
nt|cicus: @D6 was Smith - don't like clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: N considering a @S switch?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt like any switch|pg||
nt|xenya: which might save a trick if S has AK|pg||
nt|xenya: as it is, it gives an overtrick it seems |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|athene: it doesn't hurt to cash some spades and see what they do|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|hedyg: impossible to tell that S has 8@D which would maybe ask for @S and 6 asked for @H|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: In case of a tie, they will play 2 extra boards, and then 2 again if  ....   until one team has won|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C!|an|GF relay|nt|ahollan1: or if Brink had option other than 2@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H!|an|Min|nt|janm: It's true that it would give partner room, and maybe after 3@s-4@c, 4@h would show this good a hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N!|an|any 5332|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = game force relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I think that this 2@c is also an artificial game force, asking partner to describe his hand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: with @HA play - this goes down now, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|bg: clever switch small heart may lead declarer down wrong path|pg||
nt|janm: Yes we could have more than a few IMPs here if he goes down, which he seems on track to do (losing a clubl and a heart in addition to the 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no @H - but trump|pg||
nt|janm: Sorry, a club and a promoted spade|pg||

nt|viren169: slam hand... off to the races here|pg||
nt|athene: north hand is hard to express in most systems|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: but when a side actually bids 5 of something that might change the a priori odds somewhat|pg||
nt|athene: however little respect you have for their bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: both ways perhaps|pg||
nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: too good for weak 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@S might show a weak 2-suiter but this might lose the important sixth spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 2 @s is @s and a minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well that simplifies things, matos will ace ask|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure S with still push to the 5 level...|pg||
nt|viren169: great...|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't have a bid, really|pg||
nt|athene: so he will choose between double and 1@S i guess :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps Macsk√°sy could have bid 5@H en route rather than punt 6@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW bidding @Hs helps S|pg||
nt|cicus: after 2@H here @CQ is a favourite to score|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It did not in the CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: careful pass by W|pg||
nt|xenya: but you don't really bid grand missing the trump Q?|pg||
nt|cicus: no but if the auction is crowded you can't pay attentiom to nuances|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Vladimir, but N could have had it but with no chance to raise when partner jumps to 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS not a regular partnership, is 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|xenya: true, Roland|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S is forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: without agreements 2@S is surely forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a method for showing this hand after 2@S opening|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|d|nt|pelu: diff bid in N - has to bid 3@C - but pd will take is as a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need an agreement if it's not|pg||
nt|viren169: now 6 will be easy when (if) diamonds is found as second suit|pg||
nt|athene: now south has to do something|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: south assumes he is facing only five spades, so will probably ask for the @SQ |pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like S is just going to bash it out...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes 4nt aces for @s and 5 @h asks @s Q|pg||
nt|santyclz: Make a @s a @h and he has a textbook Bramley x.|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: 3@H by S|pg||
nt|hedyg: time to cuebid|pg||
nt|hedyg: prefer 3@H|pg||
nt|cicus: is this not risky?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C won't lead anywhere|pg||
nt|cicus: I mean 4@C|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure 3@H agrees clubs|pg||
nt|cicus: Szalay will convert to 4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c normally orkc...|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@D from N (reverse) sh promise 1 bid more|pg||
nt|athene: does that get him into a Bramley Jam?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: but in this sequence..|pg||
nt|cicus: ORKC idf forcing...|pg||
nt|xenya: hope they know what they are doing...|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S reached in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with the @SQ and nothing else, north would just bid 6@S, so 6@H shows extras|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|pelu: a jump to 6@C (in my system) = 2 Aces plus a void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know what ORKC is, but you had better explain. Many in the audience don't know I'm sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: orkc= option roman keycard|pg||
nt|cicus: Optional Roman Key.Card asking for aces|pg||
nt|cicus: optional, because it also asks about strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT....|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1st step agrees to slam, if other bid than 1st step then dont want slam but show number of keycards|pg||
nt|cicus: 1st step usually weak hand and other responses show aces|pg||
nt|pelu: on 4Nt I jump in the void-suit if lover that trumfp - and jump to 6 in your suit if higher|pg||
nt|viren169: whay 6@H and not 6@C?|pg||
nt|athene: but south, not being able to see all the hands and knowing there's a keycard missing, has no grand slam ambitions|pg||
nt|athene: south can't have been happy about passing throughout|pg||
nt|athene: but he didn't have any convenient bid|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps north is worried that 6@C might be taken as his second suit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: i would probably risk 3@D over 2@S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzkc: Sousa Guedes won the round Robein|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Robin|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cicus: maybe Hedy's version is more popular|pg||
nt|athene: showing extra length/strength there|pg||
nt|viren169: North passed at the other table, and drove to slame via RKCB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps 6 of a minor would offer a choice of slams|pg||

pc|s5|nt|vugraphzkc: Ribeiro is a "new team" on these finals|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: but usually without special agreement, if you pass over a suit then later double, partner is going to assume it's penalties|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|athene: as with a t/o double you could have acted the first time|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW use interesting treatment;  after 2M opening 3@C/@D = nat nf if Vul, but inv/gf @H if Not-vul|pg||
nt|janm: In the other room, S was able to DBL the 2@d opening to show a balanced hand with moderate values and then when N showed a long club suit, S took a chance the vulnerable 3NT|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|janm: Wow!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i've heard as defense to 2@D weak @H or @S:  DBL=bal opener, DBL = takeout of @H, DBL is takeout of @S|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'm confident that i don't know which is best - and apparently neither do the experts :)|pg||

mb|3N|nt|athene: in theory south has more room now but that might not be a bonus if he hasn't discussed these sequences|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: X for penalty, but I dont exp that S will accept - 4@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H problematic here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Budapest a great city. Buda on one side, Pest on the other side of the river Donau|pg||

pc|s8|nt|hedyg: 4@SX in CR, E overcalled...2@s|pg||
nt|athene: when you have one suit with an ace and one without, it's normal to lead the non-ace suit, but it's also normal to prefer a 5-card suit, so east had a close decision there i think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond shift now|pg||

mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: but if West can find small @C lead ....|pg||

nt|ahollan1: after being weaned on Bridge World Master Solvers' Club -- first time i sat to watch Murray-Kehela i was able to predict ALL of Eric's bids|pg||

nt|janm: Interesting, Fallenius decided that the E hand was a sound weak 2 in 4th seat and got to 3; Drijver opened 1 and stopped in 2|pg||

nt|athene: diamond guess to make 6@S here|pg||
nt|athene: east might lead the @DA though if north doesn't show the suit|pg||
nt|viren169: better than a guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 1@H-1NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if Szalay passes|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H 1@S 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: now west might just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: with 7 running tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I guess a discussion is taking place right now|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: N/S might be in trouble here|pg||
nt|santyclz: The usual Ghestem result.|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|santyclz: Pass before the x'ing starts.|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, EW have some points and fit, but not much anything makes, not even stop on a dime 2@H in open room|pg||
nt|athene: the auction is likely to start 1@C 1@S (2@H) X support and north can conceal the diamond side-suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: E does not want to pass nor does he want to encourage, goes the middle road|pg||
nt|pelu: why 1NT????? - do they play 1@S/1NT reversed?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s was an option as well?|pg||
nt|pelu: the middle road ? 1Nt = no road :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, they play 1NT f1 and he doesnt want to show @s, just a weak @H fit|pg||
nt|xenya: i would have seriously considered a pass as E|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6 losers, 2@d is enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: x means 3 @s support|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|athene: perhaps exclusion now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|athene: facing two non-heart keycards you are happy to have a shot at 7@S|pg||
nt|athene: exclusion keycard is usually a jump to something above 4nt|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting lead coming up for East...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: here, N-S have the room to employ it at a lower level - IF they have agree this sort of thing|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: *agreed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H splinter for me, but can continue with 5@H void|pg||
nt|athene: this is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north wins @SK and switches to a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: east has to duck but now south can switch back to a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: playing artificial reverses?|pg||
nt|othered1: this can be a very large swing 12 imps or more.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: seems good lead by W (for them...)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 2@S prpbably game forcing without spades|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: i don't think this auction is really getting to grips with the hand|pg||
nt|viren169: Do we know what 4@S showed?|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence come to diamond, 2 clubs, and 2 spades|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: 2@S must be artificial game force?|pg||
nt|cicus: not sure about that|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cicus: one of my advisors says it is 17-18 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was just natural i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S was signoff, i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: he assumed 4@H was a splinter, either singleton or void|pg||
nt|viren169: I think N is living dangerously!|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't have anything|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|xenya: abot what W actually has|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|santyclz: N didn't keep a low @d?|pg||
nt|viren169: .either red suit will allow Declarer to claim quickly|pg||
nt|athene: north would have been better-off just bidding 5@H over 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart lead 12 with no guess|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I agree|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have heart void, great hand, but neither minor-suit ace"|pg||
nt|athene: and hence must have solid trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: they got it there anyway ...|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cicus: but then I can't understand 3@D - why not pass 2NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so E could have pulled the brakes in 3@H|pg||
nt|viren169: anyone for stone age 2@S over 1@C?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: unfortunately this should go 2 off|pg||
nt|athene: east did well to lead a trump, i think|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to just hope his partner has the @DA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzkc: yes sry|pg||
nt|athene: he knows a heart lead might well give declarer a free @HAQ finesse|pg||
nt|athene: (west didn't double 5@H to show an honour, and north is void)|pg||
nt|athene: and if north is void in hearts he has length in one or other minor so a minor-suit lead could solve his side-suit problems|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is a 2@S bid, will wait awhile to use that bid again|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer should get it right in the end... considering East bid 2@H |pg||
nt|athene: i don't mind a strong jump shift response with north's hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C - 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes. Declarer as to guess but he will|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't supposed to use the bid on a 2-suiter but north can happily just treat that hand as a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|athene: but probably they don't play strong jump shifts - no-one seems to, these days|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... bets to treat it as single (solid) suiter|pg||
nt|viren169: works v nicely on this hand!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Neves is thinking|pg||
nt|viren169: also 6@S in the open room... but A@D lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: ok mhere we go|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|cicus: well, Winkler's plan of slowing it down hasn't quite come off|pg||
nt|viren169: and I can feel Lencastre smiling!|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|sA|pc|c2|nt|athene: and ducks, giving declarer the @SQ for the 9th trick|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|viren169: especially as he had no opposition bidding!|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cJ|nt|athene: hoping for miracle @HK coming down, then there's no need for the guess|pg||
nt|viren169: nicely preserved entry by declarer|pg||

mb|1N|an|15-17|mb|p|nt|janm: One of our alert spectators points out that a 4th heart from S would have allowed N to ruff with the A, also resulting in scoring the spade Q and holding declarer to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|janm: Of course the 4th heart had to come after they'd scored their club trick or declarer could pitch the club loser on the A of spades|pg||
mb|2H!|an|4+!S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and that type of defense gets you in the papers -- especially if contract is 3@S :)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|an|4!S and inv|nt|ahollan1: that's right folks   transfer only promises 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: This is an unusual method over 1NT - 2@h shows 4+ spades, not 5|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: 2@H could be 4-5@S rather than 4+, can't really hear the whispers|pg||
nt|janm: I think this unusual method may have gotten them too high here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've seen it used in conjunction with canape rebids|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: convention card says transfer "could be 4+"|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Yeah, I think I heard a word canape somewhere in there|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|janm: It looks like they have to lose 2 clubs and 2 hearts, although after this lead, maybe if he guesses well he can get rid of the second club loser|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|janm: But not that way :)|pg||
nt|bg: that is best play for West S now has tough problem|pg||
nt|janm: Bertheau probably sort of wants to cash a second club but is thinking about the old saying that if both sides play the same suit one of them is wrong|pg||
nt|janm: Do you think he might be tempted to lead a heart here?|pg||
nt|bg: all leads will now lead to contract being made|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: Brink doesn't know South has perfect major holdings|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|janm: I'm still betting on the defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doubleton @H honor in South looks like only way to make|pg||
nt|bg: 8 trumps just finesse and pray|pg||
nt|janm: Aren't his dummy entries messed up now that he let the diamond run?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alternative was to play south to hold 2@S then win @DK, cash @SAK and hook @D for @C discard|pg||
nt|bg: 3 rounds of spade scash dia K and out with a club|pg||
nt|janm: That works, of course, but is it obvious looking at the EW hands?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||

nt|janm: Won't it be natural to get hearts right?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|janm: I see, North can win the club and play the 4th diamond, forcing declarer to do the hearts for himself|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Maybe @HA and a small one to cater for @HHx in either hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice @C10 from Nystrom -- giving Bertheau options|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Bertheau KNOWS overtake to play @H won't work|pg||
nt|janm: Especially after the heart pitch from N, A and a heart does look good|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: @D exit forces declarer -- well done|pg||

nt|athene: north might double 2@S|pg||
nt|viren169: it may have taken a bit longer in the play without the 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's the least unappealing option :)|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer 3@D|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|viren169: better to pass...|pg||
nt|athene: we saw he doubled 2@H on the 6430 earlier|pg||
nt|athene: after 1nt pass 2@D pass 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think it's close between pass, double and 3@D|pg||
mb|2C|nt|viren169: depends on style and partnership trust...|pg||
nt|athene: if you are ever going to open a weak-2 with a 7-card suit, that north hand is when you should do it, i think|pg||
nt|athene: an empty suit but an ace, so you have some defence|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: east can't really have slam interest can he?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: how did they get to 2@S in CR? -- oh N just bid it|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: yes it seems so...|pg||
nt|athene: this lead gives declarer time to play on clubs, but it doesn't really help him|pg||
nt|viren169: North has bid 3@D over the multi in the open room|pg||
nt|athene: south might now be wishing he had bid 4@D over the double|pg||
mb|3H|nt|xenya: he can return a safe trump|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this NT range ONLY 1st seat favorable vul  [nv vs v]|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|nt|janm: DBL penalty of course against the 10-12; RDBL probably a 1-suited runout|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: West actually played @HA and insta played exited a low one then he started shuffling his cards as if he claimed silently|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|janm: 2@c is probably forced, and 2@h surely shows a 1-suited hand with hearts|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|ahollan1: here we're only seeing 55-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: 1@h was a game forcing hand with no short suit, 1@s relay asking, 2@c showed 5-7 AKQ points (A=3, K=2, Q=1) and no 5 card suit. Thanks to my Swedish source :)|pg||
mb|3H!|an|relay|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure 1@H denied a singleton/void, but not sure of the other message|pg||
nt|janm: 3@d showed N's exact shape and now 3@h asks for the exact number of AKQ points|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: I will try to get all the explanations once the auction is over, as noone is explaning anything at the moment|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4D!|an|relay|nt|janm: 4@c shows 7 AKQ points and an even number of aces|pg||

nt|ahollan1: hehe -- great question Bruce|pg||
nt|janm: None of these bids have been natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jan - where are you getting those details??|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: North has shown 4=2=3=4  with 7 zz points  with 0 or 2 Aces|pg||
nt|janm: I have a spy :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D!|mb|p|nt|bg: N 7 points looks more like 11;))|pg||
nt|janm: 7 zz or AKQ points, Bruce - A=3, K=2, Q=1|pg||
nt|bg: ok  back to school|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bruce still things A=4, K=3, Q=2, J=1     but here we thing A=3, K=2, Q-=1|pg||
nt|janm: And North has now shown an odd number of kings and that he has length in the suits with the Ks and no Q of clubs!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: aaaarrgh  Jan beat me to the type again|pg||
nt|janm: Now that Bertheau knows everything, will he bid 6@d or 6NT?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jan -- does your spy know why AKQ points called "zz"  [I have heard them referred to as QPs]|pg||
nt|janm: I think he needs the heart ruff for the 12th trick, so will bid 6@d|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, if N had the spade Q instead of the heart Q (S knows he has one of them, since he has a Q and not the Q of clubs) there would be 12 top tricks|pg||
nt|bg: with Sweden's luck so far he will robably bid 6nt:))|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D was one of the big pickups for Meckwell|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, my spy knows everything: "The swede who took this idea nemed it zz in his notes cause it would be easy to seek and replace att a later stage, that never happened"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe   but zz soooo hard to type :)|pg||
nt|janm: Depends on how strong your left hand little finger is I guess :)|pg||
mb|5H!|an|relay|mb|p|mb|5S!|mb|p|nt|janm: Presumably Bertheau was making sure he had everything right and also seeing whether he could find out about which Major suit Q North had without going past 6@d if it was the heart ...|pg||
nt|janm: Q|pg||
nt|janm: 5@s denied the spade Q, so now he knows everything|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it almost isn't fair|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: And indeed he's bidding 6@d|pg||

nt|ahollan1: a relay auction isn't impressive unless opponents run out of PASS cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meckwell auction was 10 bids -- including final PASS  [Walter knows all -- sees all]|pg||
nt|janm: Now they're trying to figure out who the declarer is? Just joking, but I'll bet Nystrom forgot he bid diamonds first|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: great hand here...|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H or 4@S|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|cicus: with 5 weak hearts and 4 clubs they overcall 1NT  I think|pg||

nt|viren169: I think E/S will take the push to the 5 level|pg||
nt|athene: south will definitely sac now|pg||
nt|athene: you knock out the @DA then you have 3-3 in either minor or various squeezes|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hedyg: 1NT or 2@c?|pg||
nt|ady: will it go higher than the 5 level?|pg||
nt|athene: E-W aren't playing a strong club are they?|pg||
nt|viren169: was 2@H F or NF?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: not sure this pair plays that, though|pg||
nt|athene: best is for the defence to hold up the @DA|pg||
nt|athene: then you have to commit yourself|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: east's 1@C is a bit strange|pg||
nt|viren169: interesting choice!|pg||
nt|athene: always 1@D with that shape|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes...|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: west just might go right here.  East's 4@C bid shows decent length, I'd assume|pg||
nt|ady: 1 diamond and 1 spade loser in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk5: N-S never bid in the other room|pg||
nt|othered1: a cautious 5@C, perhaps fearing 4@S would be 5=5 black?|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: wow!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: @d lead wont be good|pg||
nt|pelu: better bid 2@H in 1. round - in moders bridge u need to take space from opp|pg||
nt|hedyg: was waiting for opps to play in @s or rebid @d|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unless you pitch a @s on the @ds.|pg||
nt|athene: you don't open 1@C with 55 in the minors, just so you can reverse :)|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead will make things easy|pg||
nt|athene: you look at the @D9 and claim 12 :)|pg||
nt|athene: west might reason as follows:- 1) declarer has spades |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: and then he went from dreaming to the real world :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2) dummy has hearts|pg||
nt|athene: 3) partner didn't double 3@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: You called it.|pg||
nt|athene: 4) i'll lead a diamond!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: i see it is usual to open 1@d with 4-4 minors in Hungary|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: suicide is not painless|pg||

nt|athene: south has no excuse for 5 over 5|pg||

nt|pelu: is that normal, Gabor?|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, that is standard|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|ady: was south worried about 6 clubs   otherwise should surely go to 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: For a start I think South has an opener|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: even with a bad @D and good @C - no lead-directing?|pg||
nt|viren169: this could be a telephone number!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: as you see here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No South opened|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|othered1: Open room looks like confusion over rebids after a reverse|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: hardest for declarer would be a major-suit lead, and the @DQ then @D to the @DK both ducked|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: now someone might have @DA8 left with clubs 3-3 all along|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cicus: there might be declinations, but the rule is 1@D for 44|pg||

pc|h6|pc|s2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: in 3rd seat might open 1@c with this hand for the lead|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|athene: east blew the entry for the second diamond ruff|pg||

pc|hT|nt|hedyg: i am told Brazil too|pg||

nt|cicus: probably, I know no standard interpretation for that|pg||

nt|othered1: 13 top tricks and lots of high cards.  Still, many don't like to bid 7 unless they can count 13 tricks.|pg||
nt|viren169: they say leave the 5 level for the opps!|pg||
nt|athene: left to their own devices, E-W will play 4@S|pg||

nt|hedyg: desperately looking for a bid|pg||
nt|cicus: would not be surprised if N passed, though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i pass 2@D|pg||
nt|viren169: I think East should protect over weak 2@H more difficult over multi|pg||
nt|athene: north might just settle for 3NT over that but it's a bit wet|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@c could be artificial?|pg||
nt|othered1: A relay system should handle this trivially in about 12 rounds of bidding|pg||

nt|athene: yes, if it had gone 2@H P P east might well have doubled, in the passout seat|pg||
nt|athene: but the multi changes the tempo|pg||
nt|athene: passing the multi was also worth considering and might have worked out well|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: north's double of 2NT is very strange|pg||
nt|viren169: careful play will bring in 2N|pg||
nt|athene: to double 2NT, you should have reasonable hopes they can't make 8 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: good match, good bridge|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT...|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N is amazingly conservative|pg||
nt|ady: 4 diamonds a better choise|pg||
nt|othered1: The @SK in partner's long suit usually is worth it weight in gold.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: I think the key is to find KQ in front of all those cards...|pg||

pc|h7|nt|vugraphzkc: probably 4 @d would help more...|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|athene: two rounds of hearts, then spade to hand, @HK|pg||
nt|athene: even if east didn't have the @S10 you could probably strip-squeeze north in the blacks|pg||

pc|hK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|athene: a top heart and it's easy; a low heart and that gives declarer 11 fast tricks with several options for 12|pg||

nt|hedyg: specs asking re 4@hs, there is a slight @d problem |pg||
nt|athene: east, holding all three side-suits, is still going to get minced on the clubs|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: no reason not to throw club jack however|pg||
