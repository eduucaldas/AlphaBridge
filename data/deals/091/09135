nt|santyclz: Most common players of all playing here.|pg||
nt|hedyg: the operator will enter their names as soon as they sit|pg||
nt|hedyg: usually we are not shown the boards before the players arrive for security reasons|pg||
nt|hedyg: our operator is Carlos Araujo, ola Carlos :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if this will be a fun board, though.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: hi,welcome to Porto|pg||

nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hedy will sing for us while we wait.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: 6 imp carryover to Miguel Sousa Guedes|pg||

nt|hedyg: that explains the score|pg||
nt|santyclz: Dance on the table?|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice weather in Porto?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: i guess we opened the table too early,sry for that :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: np|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: yes,nice as usual :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Joao :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe you can tell us about the players|pg||
nt|jfaria: hello Hedy|pg||
nt|jfaria: and everybody |pg||
nt|hedyg: our "local expert" :)|pg||
nt|jfaria: if 200 miles counts as local :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, same country!|pg||
nt|jfaria: of coursae|pg||
nt|santyclz: For information on Porto, you could start at:  http://www.portugalvirtual.pt/_tourism/costaverde/porto/index.html|pg||
nt|jfaria: course|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: olá,João,boa noite :)|pg||
nt|jfaria: boa noite Carlos|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is João then !|pg||
nt|jfaria: we can start guessing about the auction :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am showing off my accents!|pg||
nt|jfaria: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: N will open a weak 2suiter?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they play it|pg||
nt|jfaria: iff|pg||
nt|jfaria: they play 2 suiters...|pg||
nt|hedyg: if not E will open 1@c and S will Ghestem that|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: players arriving|pg||
nt|jfaria: otherwise pass i guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: E has 4 losers, maybe open something strong|pg||
nt|jfaria: maybe 1@s in that case?|pg||
nt|hedyg: S should overcall anyhow|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: some problems in closed room,will start when connection avaiable|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then nobody can stop N|pg||
nt|jfaria: no doubt|pg||
nt|hedyg: so we will wait for them, Carlos?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We don't use initials, only last names|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and pls insert flags|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Carlos|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets start!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: yes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: yeah!!!!!|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hedyg: now Ghestem|pg||
nt|jfaria: if they play michaels no 2 suiter available|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jfaria: lol|pg||
nt|santyclz: for some meanings of "on"|pg||
nt|hedyg: popular convention in Portugal|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jfaria: but I think 1 @s does it|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hedyg: here it does|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Playing Ghestem is the certain way of conceding 2300, because at least one always forgets|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: no Ghestem,sry :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: np to bid 4@s in S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: lol i see Carlos|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jfaria: a litle coward W pass...|pg||
nt|hedyg: but most top players do play Ghestem in Portugal as we have seen in former broadcasts|pg||
nt|jfaria: Castro must do all...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 5@s still makes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk4: Ghestem is number 11 on my list of "25 Conventions you do not Want to Learn"|pg||

nt|gowdy: Hi |pg||
nt|woozle: This should be a good match - the strong Global team has come off a big loss to play the leaders USA Hampson|pg||
nt|mariner1: are they Global, or just merely confused? :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all - |pg||
nt|mariner1: top 15 advance + Yeh Bros team as sponsors|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: top 16 go through so both of these teams are comfortable, but top 7 get a 2nd chance|pg||
mb|5S|nt|santyclz: Northeast Pennsylvania (our local excuse for mountains.)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: hi Al and welcome all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hello again Sunil|pg||
nt|gowdy: soft 1st hand  4 @S looks easy|pg||
nt|woozle: Easy 4S for NS to begin...hard to imagine what else they might do with it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: probably a @c partscore for EW here|pg||
nt|mrdct: west thinking of passing this in|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H instead of DBL is interesting choice|pg||
nt|pbundy: well; i haven't seen this for a while! natural to play bid over 1NT|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes A Y   are in tenth place  and the face quiet a good team   Beware*|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Looks like an uneventful 3nt to get everybody settled in.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: veteran Indonesian pair facing a lot younger Dutch pair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks, hi Steve.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: West took a while to open that hand- was he going to pass ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's often not a good idea to open in 4th seat without a @S suit|pg||
nt|salokin: Hi All|pg||
nt|pbundy: is 2@S appropriate?  hard to know|pg||
nt|mariner1: the top 8 enter next session with NO LOSSES , next 8 with ONE LOSS and its|pg||
nt|mariner1: double elimination, two losses and you are out|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: A well known husband wife combo here|pg||
nt|mildredb: perhaps they play wk NT |pg||
nt|pbundy: possibly - reasonable supposition|pg||
mc|12|nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|mrdct: as more often than not you write down -110 defending 2@S|pg||
nt|pbundy: manoppo wisely passes|pg||
nt|gowdy: may get to the 5 level   but no harm there|pg||
nt|woozle: Bold 4H from McGann, escapes for 800 if he guesses trumps|pg||
nt|woozle: Even a slam move from Curtis will escape unscathed as long as he counts his aces correctly|pg||
nt|gowdy: yes  even todat's game 4NT should be blackwood|pg||
nt|woozle: presumably NS have the mechanism to show a better 4S bid, like pass-then-pull|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|santyclz: S had a complete count.  @h play was only right if n passed a10xxx akxxx x jx.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I never understood why you must open 1NT on 5422 when you have no rebid problem after 1@C|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hedyg: @s lead vs 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: when the bidding goes 1@c-1@H-1@s-1NT do you raise to 2NT with the S hand Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|hedyg: so i guess that is a reason to open 1NT, also trying to protect the red kings|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: If partner can't bid 2NT, he can forget it. I already showed 5-4 with 1@C followed by 1@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 10 HCPs as N would you bid 2NT over 1@s?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: certain 10 counts, sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and 16 opposite 9 with no fit is no bargain|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||

nt|mmmakela: 5@Hdbld|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://www.yehcup09.com.au/index.php is website with all kinds of info|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: as it is on this one...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Anyone for 5@s by s?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not with this bidding tempo, S might bid on|pg||

nt|gowdy: transfer here    yes :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can make 4@H on a Motsian fit|pg||
mc|8|nt|mrdct: EW using the increasingly popular treatment of transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|pbundy: mildred - assuming stnd methods, do you prefer 1@C or 1@D with this hand?|pg||
nt|mildredb: i open 1D w/ 4-4|pg||

nt|jfaria: 3x 6?|pg||
nt|hedyg: but xxx in @H and no stayman|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Where do you think partner's values are for a quant 4NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria: a balance between the 15 count and the fifth @d..|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria: the 15 won |pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think this is a maximum|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk4: Forget about 15 or 17, look at your hand|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Yes, remarkably, this might be the par result - if reached a bit unorthodox|pg||
nt|imp_jan: england is in 17th postion, usa stansby in 20th (out of 24 teams)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: amazingly Lavazza is last in the rankings for the moment|pg||
nt|rogerclee: i wouldn't really call a 1@H overcall at these colors "fairly orutine", but it is normal in NS's style|pg||
nt|gowdy: 4@S here  play or defend ?|pg||
nt|woozle: routine 4S for EW, and Curtis probably won't try to disrupt their auction at this vul|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S should be off 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: so loses a club and 2 spades |pg||
nt|marlowepi: this should be fun|pg||
nt|woozle: or I could be wrong|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|robinswr: maybe grue should have opened 1heart|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes it is very dangerous to open strong club when very distributional and short in spades|pg||
nt|mrdct: very good slam for EW here in @H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: no.. but will still make 12 cause @D split|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: correct|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: hello btw :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: No problem, for some reason the players frequently seem to have other things on their minds than ensuring the vg oper can see all their plays.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if NS are playing Precision or not - and 1@S doesn't resolve that issue |pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have major game and EW can't save due to VUL position I think|pg||
mb|4N|nt|marlowepi: in general the same is true when two-suited, but on previous board N held spades, so the danger was greatly reduced|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a remarkable field - full of quality |pg||
nt|imp_jan: might be a slam in clubs here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: R3: Australia Youth v Bridge i Norge and New Zealand v India National|pg||
nt|robinswr: 5clubs should show spade support|pg||
nt|mildredb: interesting X|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes; i wouldn't find it myself|pg||
nt|woozle: one club ruff in hand is ten tricks, losing a heart, diamond and the club ace|pg||
nt|woozle: McGann will always get to game here, but how he proceeds will perhaps give us an insight into his style|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: On the @hk lead, e will probably make 6.|pg||
nt|robinswr: no he'll probably lose a club and a diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Joe means, because E can place the high cards|pg||
nt|mrdct: with 3@H showing a strong @H raise east is sure to make a move towards slam now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Easier for those who play any rebid other than 2@s shows extras, either in hcp or distribution.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice practical 4@S rebid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the Chinese are supposed to be precise :)|pg||
nt|redgrover: i think 5@D by east requires a heart lead to get 500|pg||
nt|mariner1: of course NS have to bid the game to play it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: u all agree with 2 clubs? |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: incidentally, tempo altered on purpose|pg||
nt|mildredb: I'm w/ you|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3 h  is my choice|pg||
nt|woozle: Hanlon can't bid 3S now, since that's what he would bid with a yarborough|pg||
nt|gowdy: could rite side it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mmmakela: lots of playing strength so some might bid 3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same 3nt at other table on board 2|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S was off 3 and 14 imps|pg||

nt|othered1: pretty aggressive double, wonder if he planned a conversion to @D over 3@C|pg||
nt|askgaard: It's a good idea to have firm agreements about passes like north's here|pg||
nt|askgaard: Some play that it is a penalty pass. I do for instance.|pg||
nt|shevek: since EW can make game, not so dangerous...|pg||
nt|othered1: You could argue it's a penalty pass, but south fortunately has a doubleton @H , making a stack in north's hand very  unlikely|pg||
nt|askgaard: yes :)|pg||
mc|12|nt|ahollan1: and north has only one Jack that isn't working -- wow talk about cover cards|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hard to predict the fin contract on this one unless W opens 1 NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Which they did in OR|pg||
nt|woozle: 9xxx doesn't look much like a stopper, maybe 4H is the best bid|pg||
nt|gowdy: pass here|pg||
nt|woozle: 3NT makes anyway in comfort|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: who is the boss     sort of hand  here!|pg||

nt|hedyg: and highly recommends we do|pg||

nt|frankaus: hard to see this not being played in 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true though the more hearts N has, the less likely for him to open 1C with a spade void|pg||
nt|santyclz: I couldn't find a good link to a good definition of "serious 3nt".  If anyone has one, pls send it.|pg||
nt|mrdct: another slam hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: the dealing machine has been in good form so far today|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_3NT|pg||
nt|imp_jan: check http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=5&T=R for running results|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: claiming 12 via the heart finesse|pg||
nt|mildredb: Yeh Bros have a hole to dig out of|pg||
nt|pbundy: 'tis true|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|mcarroll: Now this could be more interesting|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am not a fan of minimum offshape doubles|pg||
mb|2C|nt|santyclz: 6@h works nicely, though.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6 beaten only by a diamond lead|pg||
nt|pbundy: the last hand did nothing to disabuse me of that belief|pg||
nt|mildredb: nor I|pg||
nt|pbundy: on the other hand.... i am somewhat fond of "barts" - 4/3/3/3 takeout doubles|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh they were Not DBL'd  I looked wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: sorry I for sure thought I saw a DBL :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: so somem yougsters still play ordinary weak twos|pg||
nt|redgrover: 3NT possibly off on a diamond lead here|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: a frienfly hand for 3NT|pg||
nt|mittmouse: in the 1st match there was a trump suit of q9x opposite a10xxxx a great canadian player percy sheardown taught me that as long as righty wouldnt duck with kx u should play low to ...|pg||
nt|mittmouse: the q 9x  u only lose to a stiff j and u pick up all other holdings|pg||
nt|salokin: X shows ?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: @hs|pg||
nt|salokin: Ah thx now i see|pg||
nt|pbundy: still - this one is awfully minimum.  i think i might skip this one|pg||
nt|gowdy: is this a "good weak 2 with 2@D showing a poor one ?|pg||
nt|woozle: Interesting weak two from Grue, with more flaws than I can count|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is my 5th session is my excuse|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: hearts better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if 3@C is fit-showing or just some artificial 4card @S raise|pg||
nt|gowdy: Looks like it |pg||
nt|woozle: Nothing bad happening to him though, unless you're afraid to miss a playable featherweight game|pg||
mb|2S|nt|imp_jan: how to stay out of game on this one?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not easy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@D - 3@H - Pass?  Seems a bit double dummy|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i think he'll punt 3NT, but he is thinking|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3@c not anybody's choice, some would have opted for 3@h i.s.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: like me :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: not me unless they are full value|pg||
nt|pbundy: curious pass by lasut|pg||
nt|woozle: Interesting lead...will McGann pick it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: did sheardown play with bruce elliot?|pg||
nt|redgrover: but might get a heart lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: 8-11, they have 2@D for weak, weak 2 i think|pg||
mb|3S|nt|santyclz: I guess e was wondering what s had for his x.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wow, tom townsend is taking a view|pg||
nt|imp_jan: by passing|pg||
nt|mmmakela: they shd find on the way that 4 @S is the spot|pg||
nt|mcarroll: May not be so easy with NS so active|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @D lead needed ....... a @S or @H makes it    @c is nuetral|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: no the right guess  difficult let us admit|pg||
nt|redgrover: would have still been time to find @D switch after a top heart lead, but too late now of course|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: declarer   will pick the@c suit with no entry in the dummy|pg||
nt|redgrover: yes, would go down if he was able to finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: west will soon know he has a 9 card @H fit and a nice side suit of his own so slam ought to be bid here i expect|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The operation is a success, but the patient (3@C) is not going to live|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, it's not clear that 3@H would have made either|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and in breaking news, Lavazza are on course to win a match|pg||
nt|gowdy: notpossible|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: grue just asked hanlon if he ever undleads aces, after he won the trick|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mittmouse: y|pg||
nt|pbundy: you'd be hard pressed to call this one "full value" mildred!|pg||
nt|mariner1: W was figuring a @H would give up a trick here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: brb cig br|pg||
nt|frankaus: my beer stock is rising - all my other stock are falling :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wondered it too. am i talking too loud?|pg||
nt|mrdct: not to mention his stiff @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N serious slam try?  4@S reject ??|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well 3@c 'feels' stronger'|pg||
nt|mrdct: official website is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ for live scores from all tables, a webcam and other goodies.|pg||
nt|woozle: My experience with Ace underleads is that quite often the lead looks technically great, but partner doesn't read the position and hands back whatever the lead gained and then some|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: iwhat is 3 @C ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i met bruce elliot Toronto in 79 or 80 at one of the most impressive bridge clubs i've ever seen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he was impressive too|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I don't think there was a plus score on this deal for E/W.  Even defending 2@S won't work - that contract makes|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: http://www.yehcup09.com.au/  for results, web cam, bulletins, etc...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|askgaard: I wonder if Lauria is proping for 3NT|pg||
pc|c8|nt|robinswr: he doubled on his partner's 1club opener|pg||
nt|mmmakela: active as a dbl on 1-level, not that disturbing|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: at the end   South will thank North to have a weak hand !|pg||
nt|askgaard: Not so hot to blast 4@s and find partner with @hJxx|pg||
nt|sac: worried about a heartlead and a ruff in spades|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: 1M-(DBL)-2N would have been Limit Raise +   -- just not sure about 3@C :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: S is in 3@C here in Open so more to Global|pg||
nt|othered1: They've wrong-sided @S, but only may cost an overtrick|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: none of the NS actions took up any bidding space, so it seems that their activity could only help EW to bid to right spot and to make what theyt bid|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcarroll: Well, they got to 6@S in OR with no opposotion bidding!|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 100% agr|pg||
nt|salokin: I think W was more scared to miss a slam here|pg||
nt|salokin: without bidding slam is not that bad, just needing Qx in @H or QJ bare in @D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so a perf Roland 6|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Cheek wishes he played the 10 :)|pg||
nt|salokin: after the bidding here EW know that @H and @D are not braking in a favourable way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks for the OR report, Martin, which confirms my remark that the NS bidding was more likely to help EW than hurt them. W could tell E had a doubletoin spade and did not bid any ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: suit over 1S, so the likelihood of a heart loser was very high, hence no slam even if E has a maximum|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Broge thinking|pg||
nt|shevek: fair comment by a spec: 1@s by east would have rightsided 4@s|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes, it would, but they likely find they do well by staying within their system|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|mittmouse: probably fit showing|pg||
nt|mildredb: no, I consider 13 full value  :)  |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h3|nt|vugrapha3: fsj|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: probably|pg||
pc|s3|nt|santyclz: This should stem the Netherlands tide.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, that same partner bypassed the chance to double. i reckon N was in a better position than S to know if his 1C opener contained adequate defense against 6S|pg||
nt|mrdct: sensible auction to a pretty good contract|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i think 3S there was a serious slam try as well|pg||
nt|imp_jan: Gold stole a diamond trick|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mildredb: perhaps the @D Q akes it iffy|pg||
nt|pbundy: i don't like having the Q in the @D suit.  would prefer it elsewhere|pg||
nt|askgaard: Once spades are wrongsided, I think that 3NT is actually better than 4@h|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c3|nt|frankaus: Scores from every table for board 1 at - http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=10&B=1&T=O|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|d5|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pbundy: i always wish we could hear declarer's thought processes here|pg||
nt|mildredb: now all that remains is to cash @H & guess @D - will he or won't he?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|redgrover: it's polite to take at least one trick with dummy's cards, even if the entry was of no use|pg||
nt|askgaard: If North has a doubleton heart, 4@s is down with a trump promotion|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i don't remember -- how low did spotcards go in pinochle deck -- East hand sure looked close to coming from one|pg||
nt|mildredb: Yeh Bros now on score board for this round|pg||
nt|woozle: Tough hand for EW to bid....strong 4441s are never simple|pg||
nt|gowdy: now some action here|pg||
nt|woozle: If East opens something the spade fit will probably be lost, but 3NT will still make|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: another comfy 3NT that may not be that easy to reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: back down to earth wiht a partscore hand now|pg||
nt|santyclz: And barely that.|pg||
nt|gowdy: unless 2 @D weak :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybve north passed initially?|pg||
nt|sac: this looks wrong|pg||
mb|1S|nt|redgrover: was a real shame that they were maxed in the 9th round after so many big wins against good teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, now it will be easy|pg||
nt|mrdct: north possibly not compelled to bid here|pg||
nt|pbundy: if they reach game, they'll add a bit more|pg||
nt|gowdy: wow|pg||
nt|woozle: third seat special from curtis|pg||
nt|askgaard: 2@c for hearts and 2@h for clubs|pg||
mb|2C|nt|robinswr: probably showing a spade stopper (Slow Lebensohl)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 and probably 2+@D  -- Precision catchall|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Did South do something wrong?|pg||
nt|askgaard: As far as I remember|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: as far as i can se north did not ask about he 2@h bid!|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: there goes 3nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am sure you are right, but as far as i am concerned S should just bid 3NT. after all, opps have bid two suits, so even if one of them is right to lead for the defense, they still ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have to find it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west would have to return a diamond to hold to 5|pg||
nt|woozle: Will Hanlon rip 3NT?|pg||
nt|gowdy: after P's free bid ?|pg||
nt|askgaard: Hmm|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: Our matches in round 2 are: China A vs Norway and USA Hampson (Meckwell) vs Chinese Taipei|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3nt might have denied a spade stopper|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: we had a lot of interesting hands in the last set..|pg||
nt|mildredb: yep, 6 badly needed imps |pg||
nt|gowdy: he knows  but what to do|pg||
nt|woozle: McGann doesn't really have anywhere to go except 3NT|pg||
nt|gowdy: I'm glam I'm here and not sitting W|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: this board has been played 4 times so far twice in 4@S twice in 6@S|pg||
nt|gowdy: glad|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=9&B=25&T=O|pg||
nt|othered1: or maybe it's a cue-bid in support of partner's overcall?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: south says 3@C is a @S raise to his screenmate (west)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: surprised Erik(saelesminde) resting in this key match|pg||
nt|woozle: 6D can be made, if that's where they finish|pg||
nt|othered1: or perhaps a fit-showing bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: sounds a 50 point deck|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so? if N calmly passes they might lead clubs. these methods that give so much info to opps are of dubious practical value when you have 25 HCP and two balanced hands.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 sp is 1 nt without a heart stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the set  2 was a rollercoaster|pg||
nt|woozle: lots of dummy entries for the trump coup|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Hanlon thinking now|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@h might suggest @d shortage?|pg||
nt|askgaard: The 1@s overcall might look thin, but I think it would be standard for most players at this level|pg||
nt|sac: hard to pass for Lauria now|pg||
nt|shevek: other room W is playing 5@c dbled I'm told|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: is this going to play any better by south?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: suppose ew play 2/1, that explains the 3@c by east|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: No but North knew what was going on after the D was ducked|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lack of action by W a bit surprising, facing Nonvul foes|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good contract|pg||
nt|mmmakela: a few down ok|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on this auction E is unlikely to have only five clubs, so W can act|pg||
nt|salokin: here the precision NAT 2@C opening left the @S-fit in the dark. Which was found in th OR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, it wasn;t just the opening bid that left spades unmentioned. W had 2 chances to bid the suit|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 2@S bal was obvious|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our Round 7 matches in about 55 mins are: Yeh Bros v USA Hampson and India Venkatesh v India National|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 2S directly would be inappropriate, a balance would be in order, i;d say|pg||
nt|salokin: true, and he possible knows that either ther is a 8-c @C fit or a 9-c @S -fit|pg||
nt|salokin: in 2@H N could save a trick with a intrafinesse in @D|pg||
nt|salokin: If getting in time in hand|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no entries I guess|pg||
nt|salokin: to play the 2nd @D round (1st smal to 8) Q@D to pin the doubleton J|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S now puts his suits in proper perspective|pg||
nt|mariner1: and are in trouble here now|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mmmakela: NS pair nicknamed "Drinkdriver", has nothing to do with the actual meaning of the word :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oper, pls check that.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nico is teasing us.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: getting better by the minute|pg||
nt|mrdct: will score an extra @H trick at the very least|pg||
nt|jbgood: any better is also a way of putting it..|pg||
nt|mrdct: but doesnt have an obvious source of tricks|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: McGann sighed when he saw the four spades in dummy|pg||
nt|gowdy: but is it realy a 4 card spade suit or some @D try with a @S card  I don't know|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sunsamvar: so the law of probability dictates flat hands here i suppose|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugrapha3: curtis didn't realise was his turn!|pg||
nt|redgrover: a nice little convention to have there, especially if partner is prone to being 2-2 in the majors|pg||
nt|sac: well done. The only game with a chance in this layout I think. But a long way to go|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|robinswr: 4clubs would have gone down at least one probably two|pg||
nt|mrdct: he's surely going to go after @C here|pg||
nt|mrdct: west needs to be careful not to get endplayed|pg||
nt|jbgood: he will|pg||
nt|jbgood: go for clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: so they have another call to invite in @H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|nickf: Progressive scores in all matches are up: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=1&T=R|pg||
nt|mrdct: if south leads a @C up now and west winsm west might feel in necessary to switch to @S to get rid of the @SA entry|pg||
nt|shevek: only 50's|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mmmakela: their system is called Drink|pg||
nt|frankaus: gib makes it will Manoppo?|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect he will|pg||
nt|santyclz: GIB looks at all 4 hands.  Gives it a slight advantage.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: A sensitive auction|pg||
nt|imp_jan: nothing against 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W established the the heart position was a bit shaky|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: i would bid    with w   cards  2@d and then 2@s   to show a weak major 2 suiter but I am much older|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jbgood: but you never can tell with boye|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: That duck is a good expert tactic - threatening to ruff the losing heart, whilst maintaining control of the suit|pg||
nt|woozle: I think if you're going to skip the spades to get the excellent diamonds in, you should be  planning to bid the spades later|pg||
nt|shevek: declarer knows south is void in @cs|pg||
nt|askgaard: I don't like declarer's chances here|pg||
nt|sac: neither do I|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sharkey: .|pg||
nt|askgaard: Some magic is needed|pg||
nt|sac: but I like it better than 5clucs doubled|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mrdct: boye hoping to get the opps to open up the side suits for him|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|frankaus: not only looks but has repeated attemps if it finds a failing line :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: which wont work today|pg||
nt|mittmouse: did i really stay up for this|pg||
nt|redgrover: which may have been more appropriate on this hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mmmakela: 6 shd make but the grand they bid in OR won't I suppose|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess it takes a trump lead to beat it.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@CX was down on ly one.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|robinswr: this is what happens when you operate and overcall 1nt with that hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OR:  ....this is what happens when you make a great bid but you are stuck with systemic agreements that gum up the works|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not as if 1D was more likely to get NS to 3NT than a 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|robinswr: maybe he should have run 6 diamonds before leading a spade|pg||
nt|shevek: west was told 3@C a @S raise, i c|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: W is playing 2@S here in Open|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mrdct: i'm going to jump into the operating chair now - so i'll see you all on the other side shortly|pg||
nt|askgaard: Well done to escape for down one in 5@cX|pg||
pc|sT|nt|redgrover: of course if nabil had found a fit here, game could have been easy -- his partner's major suit holding was a disappointment|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mmmakela: now 3xspades must stand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sounds like we need another Buller/Culbertson match.|pg||
nt|sac: only one down in 5clubs, and this could go more than 2 down now I think, so maybe I was wrong (not the first time)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was probably worried about squeezing dummy|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: good play by Huang to not cover the 9. that made N think that W's remaining spade was the 8 or ten|pg||
nt|robinswr: tse is counting points and doesn't think his partner has any|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure why N played the ten of diamonds on the first round. that gave away a lot of information|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm told the other table is in 6S...I assume that suggests a big swing to USA Hampson|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: youngster in deep trouble in danger not to be in the first 16|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mildredb: now for the @S plays|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|robinswr: but he has to lead a heart or a club and a club will defenently give up a trick|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gowdy: well done by south in setting a very hard auction |pg||
pc|c5|nt|sunsamvar: the next few hands will wake u up George :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C=any 16+ ,  1N=8+ BAL, game force|pg||

nt|redgrover: a very understandable lead, but an unlucky one|pg||

nt|fabsayc: club ace, so slam will make|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|robinswr: grue will strip the hand and try to put west in to lead a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D looks like asking bid response -- showing primary @H support and ??? maybe > 10 hcp|pg||
nt|imp_jan: for the moment we have new event leaders: the team of mr yeh himself. he just took over from meckwel c.s.: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=20...|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Looks like it|pg||

nt|marlowepi: so far these deals would be better fare for a Board-a-Match event|pg||
nt|mildredb: yes the 21 hcp slams are not usually bid|pg||
nt|woozle: 5S safe for EW, but how much bidding will Joe do with his 6/5?|pg||
nt|woozle: I assume that 2NT is some kind of good raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in a part score here|pg||
nt|askgaard: Every hand is suitable for a NT opening these days :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sunsamvar: but here the precision 1 nt may apply the brakes|pg||

nt|sac: Interesting 2nt What is the range supposed to be?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: nice solution to the bid problem|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: brogeland just made a belated alert of 4@S and is talking in sigh language to west|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: *sign|pg||
nt|jbgood: no good supp in minors - still good in spades - interested if prd has a good minor suit|pg||

nt|salokin: 3@D I mean|pg||

nt|mildredb: nothing to the play on this hand|pg||

nt|mittmouse: i guess u cant stop short of 3nt|pg||

nt|mariner1: the youth needs some swing boards there way........|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mmmakela: now a danger|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not to cash out I mean|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They need to get their tricks fast or lose them|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Yes - on bidding unlikely that EW have a 4-4 @S fit|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he knows it's his turn :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: Should it not make?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the open room Kit Woolsey says that the percentage play in diamond is low to the 9 spot|pg||
nt|jbgood: not only what he is doing - but what he and prd are doing together:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: even more important|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not many losers ... but are there 10 winners?|pg||
nt|pbundy: yep|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mmmakela:  6 dias might, at least dbld it will|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: the blackwood defense would have worked great, cash all your aces|pg||
nt|woozle: not hard to place the hearts on the auction|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Grue: "I cant blame you"|pg||
nt|woozle: win the heart, two spades ending in dummy, heart up...if ducked, another spade across and another heart up|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|mmmakela: of course no dbl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kit: the reason I think low to 9 is right play in slam is that it will be tough for East to duck from King-doubleton|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: so if 9 loses to jack, I would then take finesse on way back|pg||
nt|santyclz: Isn't the normal play leading the 9 from dmy?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so not pecentage play but best play?|pg||
nt|rogerclee: even if yeh knew his partner had a doubleton diamond, ducking seems wrong|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: overtake and play @D to show @S reentry|pg||
pc|h6|nt|imp_jan: sure|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye all - enjoy the show from Down Under:) |pg||
nt|marlowepi: what was the double of 3D? would 3H be invitational?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: suitplay says low to 9 and if it loses to J, cash A|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok believe, dbl finesse close 2nd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: East should know not to duck any @C|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|redgrover: a couple of hours ago the youth were dreaming of a spot in the top bracket, how quickly things change|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mittmouse: if he cashes his hearts he wins the board or 3 imps|pg||
nt|gowdy: and so it shall be|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: Kit: suitplay thinks that East will always duck from Kx -- in real life, that ain't so|pg||
nt|santyclz: Bye Jon, thanks.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it is more common to play that dbl would be an invitation and 3H purely competitive|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Grue discussing with dummy now, quietly, that this contract is cold|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Cheek didnt play a card but McGann claimed|pg||
nt|redgrover: still a 5-VP buffer at the moment though|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 1 down|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|santyclz: Normal play in 7 is the Q from dmy.|pg||

mb|3N|nt|bjacobs: And indeed, 3NT makes easily on this layout|pg||
nt|mariner1: 43 VP not possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: what else could south bid over the 1@h response?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@D is a massive underbid ... but what alternative is there?  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: danger|pg||
nt|gowdy: down  got to get light in this room eh|pg||
nt|woozle: diamond lead leaves this with 6 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N transfer to @C?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: y |pg||
nt|redgrover: true, hence their being in serious trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: lead here helps|pg||
nt|mariner1: found 7, looking for 8 and 9 now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West will duck the first @h and some homework for declarer|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcarroll: OR bid to 4@H|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT suggested, and it certainly has some merit|pg||
nt|salokin: OR ended up in 4@H when W after the same bids jumped to 4@H|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|santyclz: Nice shift.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wonder if 3S denied 5H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suspect you are right|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: interesting choice of leads rather than @D for a look|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lol. west does not lead from @D ak and east leads from his q into a dangerous looking jtx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 4nt was not the tool here, aces not the issue|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a general invite of 5@S would be my choice|pg||
nt|mariner1: Youth currently tied with Australian Open for 15th|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i guess that as long as bids like this double keep getting opps to do the wrong thing, NS will continue to make such bids|pg||
nt|rogerclee: if east showed exactly 4-4 in the majors i think west should not accept a slam try, he knows his hand is quite bad opposite a 44(32) slam try|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: It's complicated by the 3-card heart support.  How about a wacky 2NT?|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: but it does make sense - if North held KJx and East AQ10 - then need extra entry for 2nd @H through|pg||

mb|p|pc|h4|nt|cindy: S ix MAX for 2H|pg||

nt|jfaria: would noit pass with Castro hand after the XX|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i agree that the key is the dull shape of the W hand|pg||
nt|rogerclee: yes i think 5c is the correct bid|pg||
nt|pbundy: penultimate hand|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lebridgeur: another good result for NS  this board 8|pg||
nt|redgrover: have to hope justin makes this at the other table, or the kids are gone|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: that's what i mean and over 4@C you correct to 4@H|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S makeable if NS are amazingly aggressive|pg||
nt|mariner1: (I am pulling for the youth because I remember what it was like to be a young player|pg||
nt|mariner1: back before we had electricity :) )|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: i can accept 5@C also, but would bid 6 with marshall's example|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: what shouid west do tough ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S is a good spot|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: well, my concern was that W might look first and foremost at his spades over 5S|pg||
nt|woozle: more likely one or two overtricks in 2S|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: he should not (since we have KCB)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the ancient idea was that asks for good trumps, not really necessary these days|pg||
nt|rogerclee: east offering up a huge number here|pg||
nt|woozle: Hmm...reverse flannery in action?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|robinswr: 4spades is rkc|pg||
nt|redgrover: should be duplicated at the other table, this might come down to the last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: i will suggest the hand for the bidding panel of my magazine (IMP)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was more than slam :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E bid according to the Lore of Total Tricks. The 2S raise was perhaps a bit adventurous at the colors. partner might easily end up bidding 4S to make and going down 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I'm told: he's been upgrading since he was 8. They say he missed his 1st slam at 16 :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 5 minutes of session time left|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a good one.  It's actually a version of what's called the Bridge World Nightmare Hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In the BWNH, you open 1@D on a strong hand, and partner responds in your 3-card major|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6 spades best?|pg||
nt|mildredb: at this point Yeh Bros stand 3 & China Long Ahu are tied for 8th|pg||
nt|gowdy: as we shall  see here 2@H is 54 10 hcp|pg||
nt|gowdy: better than passing it out !|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: McGann might have thrown this one in, for all the right reasons|pg||
pc|sA|nt|frankaus: nice treatment here 2NT ask for short suit trial  - i expect|pg||
nt|imp_jan: meanwhile another bidding problem here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Over 2 decades, it's never been solved|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3n = good|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but how to reach it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6 looks good|pg||
nt|salokin: yep or 6N with the @HK in the leaders hand :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|robinswr: 4nt - 5nt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wow|pg||
pc|s3|nt|robinswr: i play that 5nt shows the spade king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know entire structure, but  something like  15 teams qualify + Yeh Bros, then 2 brackets and sort of a double elimination|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Difficult from here|pg||
nt|rogerclee: yeah, i disagree with 2@S, though it is a good strategy to raise aggressively over an opponent's negative double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: vulnerability is for grownups|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that strategy pays off best, though, when there are TWO unbid majors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as in 1D-2C-D-3C|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N is looking for D ki8ng now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|santyclz: A chance for Netherlands.|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect this will make|pg||
nt|redgrover: 3NT appears to be making on bd 8 at the other table, so the youth are still alive|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: just made   par for Ns again|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|frankaus: mannopo finds the killing lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well that lead certainly gives declarer a chance to go down.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gowdy: nice @s guess :)|pg||
nt|woozle: It was going to be guessed later anyway|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|gowdy: and may come back if S thinks stiff Q|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: this could be interesting|pg||
pc|h6|nt|santyclz: No winning options.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our matches in round 2 in about half an hour are: China B vs Norway and USA Hampson (Meckwell) vs Chinese Taipei|pg||
pc|h7|nt|robinswr: in an IMP match one should discuss what bids mean|pg||
nt|mittmouse: are the italians really last wow|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|robinswr: in slam auctions|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What's the coroner say about this "dead" contract|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mmmakela: needs to guess clubs I suppose in 3rd trick?|pg||
nt|frankaus: cant draw trumps - cant not draw trumps - no winning options|pg||
nt|mildredb: now a little to-ing & fro-ing :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: true, but even so, on what basis would S accept ANY grand slam try? could he have less?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Meckwell in 6@S, flirted with the grand|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes|pg||
pc|s5|nt|santyclz: I'm willing to make a prediction here.  This hand won't be finished before time is up.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mmmakela: right -1|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|santyclz: Has to draw trumps and play for the @ckxx onside.|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe Lasut will duck 2 @C LOL|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needs the @d finesse or 5@ss and the @dk in the same hand.|pg||
nt|mildredb: or not :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: i think declarer needed to play top @S then 2nd round finesse|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not exactly. it is not like you can preserve both possibilities. you will play for the diamond finesse, so it is 50% i think|pg||
nt|pbundy: well - with the club spots this might be safer route, actually|pg||
pc|c4|nt|frankaus: was a joke :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: true|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|robinswr: you would take the diamond finesse since anything else is anti percenage|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: but with 4-1 @C, not sure if that that works|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 5@C has a better play, and would in fact have made (I think)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d3|nt|gowdy: now 5|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: andy making morse code signals on his head|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Youth are back into 14th with 2 boards to score!|pg||
nt|redgrover: the 4@H doesn't exactly improve his hand|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I must admit it is difficult to find acll with west hand after 4 @d|pg||
nt|mariner1: Yeh is 16th so that does not help as there are now only 15 spots|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it's always a bit dodgey cueing shortage in partner's suit|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: * find a call|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: right dave|pg||
nt|redgrover: this will be one of the most important bids andy has had to make, a lot of pressure here|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open  1@H - P - 1N - 2@C - P - 2@S so far|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation to the Queensland Bridge Association and Australian Bridge Federation for allowing us to broadcast from this prestigious event. Therese Tully, David Stern ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and Patrick Huang have been instrumental in making all this possible.  And Mr Yeh of course.|pg||
nt|mildredb: looks that way|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the overcall  makes the differnce|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: 3n was in danger after the (unlikely) diamond lead|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but always made|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You'd think North would unleash a 5-card major probe, if South tends to open with a 6-card major :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The play is awkward for South.  He HAS to win a spade in dummy to take the heart finesse.  So what spade does he insert here?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: declarers problem is that if east comes in with @hk he might get diamonds through|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am dazzling the kibitzers here with my analysis|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open  1@H - P - 1N - 2@C - P - 2@S - P - 5@C P - 6@C in Open!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: 6@D can make|pg||
nt|frankaus: wd nic - roland, markku, Joe kibs tu 4 ur company |pg||
nt|santyclz: Last chance for Netherlands this set.|pg||
nt|woozle: Might make 3|pg||
nt|redgrover: the chinese in 17th place have drifted down, so there is more breathing space now -- as long as the irish pair doesn't bid 6@C|pg||
nt|mwigor: which they have|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: may be   he gets it right     but @d is the best lead by far|pg||
nt|redgrover: darn|pg||
pc|dA|nt|nickf: next matches Japan vs China HubeiDongFeng and Australian Selected vs Global|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yeh2009: And a great team of helpers and volunteers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Also, do you lead the @H10 from dummy or low?  It's not trivial|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mildredb: the Spec have been very quiet tonight :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mmmakela: guess 6 dias is makeable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not even bad enough to be a Roland slam.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Great slam|pg||
nt|yeh2009: Spade lead allows you to make 9 trums and a trump lead allows for ruffing heart finesse|pg||
pc|h3|nt|santyclz: This is the last bd of this match.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: most partnerships i know would not be able to get to this comfortable 2C contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1nt was pretty comfortable also|pg||
nt|mariner1: only a 1 VP edge,,,, so................|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: If only the Dutch could have avoided the 7-level, they would have had a fine match|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well he takes his 75 % chance|pg||
nt|salokin: another slamish hand 12 tricks on 2 of 3 finesses ... except a bad @H break|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: well that will cost a lot to australian young tema      NS  played perfectly as Hanlan and Mc Gann ireland in OR|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: 7@D down twice |pg||
pc|c3|nt|imp_jan: @hk left or ace of diamonds rigth|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fair enough|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was just so messy to take the heart finesse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, he's still only got 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So the whole hand is messier than my son's bedroom.  And that's saying something|pg||
nt|imp_jan: lol|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but decl is still in control due to the fav lay out|pg||
nt|imp_jan: ah england took over|pg||
nt|imp_jan: north did bid 3n after 1d-1h-3d on brd 18|pg||
nt|imp_jan: have to leave you now (heading for the dentist, no no the coup, but the real stuff i am afraid), cu soon|pg||
nt|pbundy: in shock after 2@DX earlier on.........  that was a spectacular hand|pg||
nt|pbundy: 16 imp swings not terrifically common|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry play went too quickly for me :S|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|santyclz: Thanks to my excellent fellow commentators, Marshall and Steve.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the unblocking in diamonds was not just showing off. N has organized the play so that E would have to make 2 discards while seeing only one card from E|pg||

nt|hedyg: 7@ds..7 NT|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: and 7@H!|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: this is the kind of hand where forcing club has a big advantage. after 1 round, NS are at 3S and there is still so much to sort out|pg||
nt|cindy: be nice to set trumps as spades (intending to playin nt all along) to find out about K and Q of spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is it clear that 4H is forcing?|pg||
nt|cindy: not to me|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s doesnt show this hand|pg||
nt|cindy: would scare me|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|cindy: why not just raise diamonds after 3D |pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: perhaps S meant 4H as a cue in support of Ds|pg||

nt|hedyg: N asking aces and kings can count 13 tricks|pg||
nt|cindy: ty Richie :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6NT in CR|pg||

nt|hedyg: you are not alone Roland|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: yes, it is S who knows the Ds are solid. even if 4H is a Q in their methods, does S need TWO honors to cue for a rebid suit?|pg||

nt|cindy: why isnt 7N best ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: same here, claim :)|pg||
mc|13|nt|marlowepi: i think there is something to be said for 2D in response to 2C. it gives S a chance to make 2 natural rebids, and if you end of bidding diamonds twice naturally, that will take you ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: past 3NT and so S will have a pretty good idea of your strength|pg||
nt|hedyg: 7NT the best|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i was asking mainly about what agreements are best|pg||
nt|cindy: i prefer to play you must take a preference but i think im in the minority|pg||
nt|reisig: South should get better hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right, cindy, that is why i am thinking that maybe a delayed 2C should show 4-5 in minors|pg||
nt|cindy: and pass is for penalty|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think you can agree that 2@c always shows both minors|pg||
nt|cindy: huh|pg||
nt|reisig: Pass = penalty ???|pg||
nt|hedyg: a delayed 2@c yes i agree|pg||
nt|hedyg: so pass first|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think you can, once S has passed and N bids 1S, which is what i was asking about|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes then 2@c should be for minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe even 4@c and 5@d|pg||
nt|reisig: what would 1N mean?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think maybe specifically with longer clubs. a delayed 1NT can be = length in minors|pg||
nt|jfaria: I agree with Rich: South must get better hands, so near to commentators lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or delayed 1NT can be "diamonds at least as long as clubs"|pg||
