nt|othered1: getting the @H lead is important to EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Indeed - simplifies what might have been a tough defence|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|2N|nt|salokin: @H lead or switsch after @C A seems to beat 4@S here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bobdrijver: if declarer had A10 and an @D entry|pg||

pc|d7|nt|bobdrijver: very hard though|pg||
nt|lestergold: should lose a trick in each suit if defence get it righjt|pg||
nt|salokin: ducking would let it thru|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: could be costly in a lot of ways, could be giving up a @D ruff or a @H trick|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: though the @C seem dangerous anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed not easy not obvious|pg||
nt|salokin: no because there is no fast entrie to dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: but on balance with theodds i think with that threatening club holding in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: north is likely to be short in clubs a heart trick is surely best hope of  a setting trick|pg||

nt|othered1: and west walks in with his minimum|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: which should be actgually|pg||
pc|h3|nt|salokin: 4 Tricks costing lead :)|pg||

nt|thegarve: sensible method especially in suit play|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|bjacobs: I've often wonder that if you have to lead low from 10x, it could be a problem if partner has, say, AQJxx (so you need to play a second one through)|pg||
nt|othered1: In any method, you gotta be able to play the winning card in the suit and partner just has to allow for it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm sure that's true.  But it would be nice if methods were consistent with the winning card = system card, as often as possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good point. You don't stop playing bridge just because you have an agreement|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|othered1: West has a decision here and 10 or J may not be winning if north goes right after @D|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like west played east for a singleton|pg||

nt|jtr: should help|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: game on|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|brolucius: The Hacketts have not enjoyed an inspired session and will count themselves lucky if they (somehow) manage to survive. |pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: making 4@S would be a serious blow to England, going down would leave the match hanging very much in the balance|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont think he can go down|pg||
nt|salokin: a 10! - 12 NT here this allways seems only need 9 nowadays|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: 2c for the majors i assume|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: But the consolation is that the loser will get another chance tomorrow|pg||
nt|brolucius: Do you promise that?|pg||
nt|lestergold: wil they find the heart fit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: can misguess the clubs|pg||
mb|3H|an|invite|mb|p|nt|jtr: 6@c Roland?|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: brink will not accept this i expect|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: yes 3h played by north not vulnerable to a club lead which would finish 4h straight away if played by south|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: assuming that they bid game on everything, accepting invite in their style is hardcore|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: well bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h should not present a challenge|pg||
nt|lestergold: but they have the vlues to be in 4 not laydown but should be in it|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: and with 17 boards to go its almost tied again|pg||
nt|salokin: without EW bidding it is probably normal to reach the doomed @H game|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho it went off in open|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jtr: of course:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Silly question really|pg||
nt|jtr: Bit good for you?|pg||
nt|lestergold: is it necessarily doomed?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bobdrijver: yes|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C is laydown and very good (by my standards)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: Did they not bid that??|pg||
nt|jtr: Very odd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Great opportunity for England|pg||
nt|imp_jan: lay down?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jtr: But you have to play the squeeze not the finesse|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|salokin: at least with a @S lead and @C switch|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Yes Jan, a contract that can make is laydown|pg||
nt|jtr: But on VG you always play the squeeze|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: @D lead also still|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: definitely in that case|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: not anymore though i think|pg||
nt|salokin: but also with @S to the A and @S back fredin couldnt make|pg||
nt|lestergold: but spade lead wasnt particularly marked|pg||
nt|bobdrijver: indeed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|imp_jan: well if u put it that way, yes :)|pg||
nt|po-s: what other way is there Jan?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: a contract that only requires one misdefence is sound?|pg||
nt|salokin: probably missguessing the @H situation|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|imp_jan: i am content that bertens-bakkeren reached game|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: I think it has 9.14% of making. That's not too bad. Just ask Geoffrey Wolfarth whose 7@C rolled in some years ago. It was a 1.5% shot|pg||
nt|po-s: 3NT on the other hand....|pg||
nt|jtr: yes, 3NT was hardly perfect|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Geoffrey's grand required 3 finesses, a break and @HQ doubleton|pg||
nt|jtr: But maybe better than 5@c?|pg||
nt|brolucius: There has not been much luck involved in the 33-3 scoreline. The Dutch have played well.|pg||
nt|mwigor: that sounds worse than 1.5%|pg||
