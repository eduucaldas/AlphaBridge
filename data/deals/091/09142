nt|vugrapha1: nice play in the @s suit by justin|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: we can see that declarer needs to ruff high ...|pg||
nt|imp_jan: still the 10 looks suspicious|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has two red-suit losers, so he must make the right play now.|pg||
nt|jtr: East will pass next door and no doubt West will bid his @cs and they may get too high|pg||
nt|jtr: This is the sort of problem i like|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most annoying for the defenders is for declarer to think for ages and then get it right.|pg||

nt|xenya: N considering a @S switch?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: That is normal nowadays.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Other room is in 4@S.|pg||
nt|yeh2009: hi all, David(Stern) ia gone. Patrick Huang here.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Say bidding goes  1@D (1@S) 2@D pass  ;  pass   then you can double, which is often 5-3. So the heart suit is not necessarily lost when you overcall|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: hi patrick|pg||
nt|po-s: itÂ´s not exactly a solid spade suit|pg||
nt|imp_jan: nothing is solid nowadays, p.o.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Double might be OK when 5-4 in the majors, but 1@S better when 5-3.|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes PO, that is why i excuse X|pg||
nt|jtr: South's actions could have been different too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: double you mean?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: yes david, south could have made a cuebid or a t/o dbl|pg||
nt|jtr: No 2@d|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was not strong enough for 2@D, it seems, so 3@H looks right. Unlucky, as it turned out.|pg||
nt|po-s: me too, but I would probably bid 1S anyway - ashamed and reluctantly and prepared to take the blame|pg||
nt|yeh2009: If Justin saw dad bid this way before, maybe he should cue 2D instead of jumping to 3H|pg||

nt|hedyg: orkc= option roman keycard|pg||
nt|cicus: Optional Roman Key.Card asking for aces|pg||
nt|cicus: optional, because it also asks about strength|pg||
