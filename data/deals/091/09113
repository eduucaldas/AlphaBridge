nt|mariner1: Hi Barbara|pg||
nt|barbyh: Hi Rob nice to see you|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like momentum should carry EW to 6S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi Barbara|pg||
nt|frankaus: this one should get the pulses moving|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6S X probably|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|barbyh: absolutely|pg||
nt|sybarra: and here we go |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi colleagues & specs|pg||
nt|barbyh: hi there|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Mashall, welcome |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S seems par|pg||
nt|barbyh: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good morning all - Snorri, Ralf, Ian & Tony |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: welcome to Japan everyone|pg||
nt|sharkey: still dark outside in Norway|pg||
nt|snorris: A fight to 5 @d is my bet|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like the Korean team name - "Happy Bridge"|pg||
nt|snorris: on top of 4 @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And a good safe in 5@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: who will save over 5@D?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: hi all|pg||
nt|snorris: hi all|pg||
nt|werge: hi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator? Please insert an  L  in Klinger|pg||
nt|snorris: a 3nt e-w looks likly|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: HI Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Tony!|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sorry, Tom|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: slam time first up|pg||
nt|snorris: 6 @c anyone?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as the cards lir a grand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: lie.. sry|pg||
nt|snorris: 6 @c is a good contract|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Martin, Hans|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No Tony, but I heard about it. Wrong explanation by South to West that made him remove 2@SXX|pg||
nt|idblu: i understand we have the 11th and 12th place team playing each other...it is swiss teams format|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure but hopefully thee|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Yokohama in Japan for the 14th NEC Cup. Last match of the qualifying. 14 boards|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators are Carl Mathiesen, Mike Graham and Mike Polowan|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all - sunny day here in London|pg||
nt|fabsayc: rehi, both teams have 6 players|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello everyone and welcome back to Yokohama in Japan for the 14th NEC Cup. Final, last segment of 16 boards now|pg||
nt|roswolf: a close match now and the heat is on|pg||
mb|2H|nt|thommos: Hi all|pg||
nt|caitlin: hi folks|pg||
nt|shevek: here we are, 13 imps to catch up (will try to be impartial : )|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: as expected so far|pg||
nt|barbyh: hey Marshall|pg||
nt|mariner1: both rooms are starting with board 1 so we will see results as we go|pg||
nt|snorris: not likely|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well lets hope for more excitment this match|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So the score was adjusted to 2@SXX down 4 = 2200|pg||
nt|snorris: hi all|pg||
nt|idblu: S is Brazilian internationalist Diego Brenner|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: This is Part 1 of a semifinal match|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S might be reached|pg||
nt|athene: and should go down, losing @SAQ @DA @HA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hello - Fred, Joe, Michael|pg||
nt|idblu: Looks like the Chineses Women are the cinderella team at the tourney :)|pg||
nt|idblu: And they have also played stupendous ..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for convention cards of players - check out:  http://tinyurl.com/Japan-Open-2007  and http://tinyurl.com/Chinese-Women-2008|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good hand for garbage stayman.|pg||
nt|idblu: pass anything :)|pg||
nt|xenya: Japan Open have a substantial lead China Women, but there are 32 boards ahead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Morning Hans, Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: The other 2 teams are Australia and Chinese Women|pg||
nt|xenya: strong @C from E|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: we will get names as soon as operator has time to put them in |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Unfortunately Ian is trying to be with us, but "gagged" at the moment|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D suit may "disappear"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Had anyone of you opened on N?|pg||
nt|werge: Yoy have problems in 3 NT - East is somehow endplayed...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so the Hacket team came back to win from 40-0 down|pg||
nt|xenya: Hello Martin|pg||
nt|athene: but i think even with 13 imps to make up, bidding game wld be aggressive|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H will be a 3-card limit raise, i guess|pg||
nt|shevek: fit showing jump maybe?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a strong Australian team  Klinger and Delmonte are very well known|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I dont know the other 2  but surely well known also|pg||
nt|sharkey: Would anyone open the East hand 1@C?|pg||
nt|athene: east has the sort of hand that can be very aggressive facing 4-card spade support but less so facing only 3|pg||
nt|athene: weak trumps and possibility of getting forced in hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: clubs are where my points are, yes i would|pg||
nt|shevek: absolutely an opening hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but EW weren't part of the team in 2008, so we'll have to guess what they're doing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Your commentators are Geoffrey Wolfarth, Jos Jacobs, Mark Horton and Kath Nelson|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: par 11|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now thats what I call a heavyweight overcall - after a featherlight opening!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: strong club to start|pg||
nt|cindy: @h lead i think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Yokohama in Japan for the 14th NEC Cup. Quarter-finals, two segments of 16 boards. This is the first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome to first set of knockout phase of 2009 NEC|pg||
mb|3C|nt|marlowepi: not an ideal start, but shouldnt matter|pg||
nt|barbyh: normal sequence|pg||
nt|snorris: if n shows life then not|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi folks|pg||
nt|cindy: i just see 6 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi cindy |pg||
nt|cindy: hi shirley :)|pg||
nt|bg: normal contract probably off one  two tricks in three suits plus spade ace|pg||
nt|thommos: assume X is for Takeout|pg||
nt|mpny: Hackett will open 1H which will make reaching 4H routine|pg||
nt|idblu: I think S and E would like to be somewhere else at this moment in time:)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: Operator,  I have told E name is WangWenfei |pg||
nt|Walddk5: But since they started 5 mins early, they are not all here yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: contract in Open is 5@S DBL|pg||
nt|snorris: no 3 nt now I guess|pg||
nt|sharkey: gd morning Mike|pg||
nt|mpny: good morning|pg||
nt|mpny: or late nite here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H makeable here?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators are Al, Ed, Joe and Martin'|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|werge: 3@c look surprising?|pg||
nt|idblu: re all :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: 2@S rather timid?|pg||
nt|snorris: in my system I open 2 nt|pg||
nt|snorris: give it 3..the law..|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @s|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Martin|pg||
nt|idblu: W recently won a North Ameruican championship at the recent nationals playing with Steve Katz I believe|pg||
nt|idblu: I see The Netherlands was in 1st prior to the last match...so these 2 must be the leaders or very close to the top of the standings|pg||
nt|sharkey: real late mike?|pg||
nt|mpny: yes it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF EW using same convention card as 2007 Bermuda Bowl -- we'll see some 10-13 NT openers [fav 1/2/3]|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi folks:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone|pg||
nt|caitlin: hi Ed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: according to CC west's balancing NT was supposed to be (12)13-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: evening Ed, Joe, Caitlin|pg||
nt|caitlin: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html  is homepage|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Martin!|pg||
nt|othered1: west may not play south for the 6-count|pg||
nt|caitlin: hi Joe and Al:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: and Martin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well, there's 6 count and there's the South hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know if north's 1@S is a limited opening?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SJ looks like normal play -- then either @D or @H  [probably @D]|pg||
nt|caitlin: 8 teams have qualified for quarter finals these teams 4th-5th respectively and between 4th-8 teams only 5 VP difference|pg||
nt|athene: opening 1@C with 5-5 in the blacks can certainly lead to a much smoother auction if partner has a good hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Fearless.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  1N=10-12 1/2/3 not-vul   otherwise  (14)15-17|pg||
nt|sybarra2: when operator gets a chance,  will make changes I am sure |pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s might bid the slam herehere but|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: strangley, south sold out to 3 spades OR|pg||
nt|othered1: So west will bid her hand out in natural order, rather than @H first|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I am looking for which Hackett this is|pg||
nt|mpny: the auction also made it likely to guess D|pg||
nt|athene: but most people these days prefer to get their major in|pg||
nt|yo_yo: for those who like to picture the players  here is a link for delmonte: http://www.worldbridge.org/TOURN/Bermuda.00/vugraph/players/profiles/0162.html|pg||
nt|shevek: at this vulnerability they're not very keen|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: That's a popular Scandinavian convention - 2 NT = 55 in minors < opening|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @h showing 5|pg||
nt|idblu: Hi Cindy, Tony|pg||
nt|idblu: change that to Ralph Katz :)|pg||
nt|irwinbo: it looks like no game makes|pg||
nt|cindy: W wont let pd off the hook|pg||
nt|mdgraham: err...|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: the play will not be challenging|pg||
nt|snorris: 5 @c then|pg||
nt|mcarroll: hard to see what else |pg||
nt|snorris: no 3nt|pg||
nt|snorris: I presime|pg||
nt|snorris: presume|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like the D from E|pg||
nt|sharkey: ouch|pg||
nt|caitlin: does anyone know what happened with the appeal?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I don't have CC for any of the China Evertrust partnerships :( but a good bet that they're part of the Precision throng|pg||
nt|caitlin: would think so and I have yet to find cc's|pg||
nt|santyclz: Rather a surprise on trick 1.|pg||
nt|othered1: might be right to bid with the south hand, then, as Ew could have game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi all, not sure why he did not play spade jack|pg||
nt|caitlin: will cost|pg||
nt|santyclz: I can only guess he didn't read it as 4th best.  Many people would lead the 10 from that holding.|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe playing north for A109xx(x)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if North's lead conventionally from A109xx or Q109xx -- when is it wrong to play !J?|pg||
nt|othered1: Depending on what NS lead from that holding|pg||
nt|idblu: @D10 makes a nice entry to the @C's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over weak NT  --- DBL of Stayman = GOOD HAND [vs Strong NT - better to show @C or something conventional]|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: heard the screach of brakes |pg||
nt|marlowepi: S needs to bid 4S here|pg||
nt|snorris: well done|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello again!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT I mean|pg||
nt|werge: 10 of @C now,pls!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: doubtless game forcing now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: which resulted in a fair punishment|pg||
nt|thommos: lucky South didn't X for t/o|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: Morning Snorri and Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes an amazing set - 2 grand slams in a row and lots of swing boards|pg||
nt|sybarra: Paul H. I am told|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and if 4th best [ugh] then Rule of 11 would make J automatic|pg||
nt|sharkey: sensible stop NV - E may have bid game VUL due to potential payoff|pg||
nt|shevek: not sure he'll make this|pg||
nt|sharkey: u read my mind Nicoleta:)|pg||
nt|athene: @HK now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other Chinese Women were playing Precision - so until proven otherwise, let's assume EW also big @Cers|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: even though 3S is forcing, N might think that it suggests alternatives to the eventual 4S that S would bid|pg||
nt|cindy: hi :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: My bid on E is 4@s|pg||
nt|werge: But the best board in this tournament was by far 6 @d one down - and 7 @D making at the other table. And declarer in 6 @D played perfectly...|pg||
nt|werge: Yesterday|pg||
nt|marlowepi: buddy?|pg||
nt|werge: @S-lead = expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The 1@S opening and aggressive auction by NS keeps EW out of a making 4@S?|pg||
nt|roswolf: definitely bid the slam|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Jos Jacobs|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi jos|pg||
nt|josj: hi Roland and Geoffrey :)|pg||
nt|josj: good to see a probably tense final session coming up|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and good morning to Mark Horton|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome cindy|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi cindy |pg||
nt|sharkey: The "Happy Tea" off to a flyinf start as 5@D likely to make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Ralf|pg||
nt|cindy: S getting nervous about being endplayed i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: thinking of unblocking to avoid it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: GF hands usually7 don;t|pg||
nt|idblu: appears to off 2@D 1@H and 1@C|pg||
nt|cindy: welcome marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: tricky lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E has a minimum for 1nt|pg||
nt|thommos: 2@S was making, but how many down is is 3@H|pg||
nt|caitlin: 5@CX will yield a nice score for N-S a half Canadian/half U.S. team|pg||
nt|caitlin: Mori is originally from Tokyo so has advantage of speaking language |pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S is easy -- NS had a profitable save available  |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|snorris: dont know about 2 nt in Scandinavia but in my version it is a kind of multi, covering some strong versions|pg||
nt|sharkey: In Norway usually weak 55 hand |pg||
nt|snorris: ok|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: even 12 tricks possible..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and a good choice it seems|pg||
nt|sharkey: ok - undo|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry just put on right glasses:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: lol|pg||
nt|chessmaste: From a sunny Bath|pg||
nt|Walddk5: My bath is wet|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ralfwil: now 12 tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: missed that one...Rolands got me on split shifts|pg||
nt|snorris: where south fell asleep? |pg||
nt|idblu: safe lead, gives nothing away|pg||
nt|santyclz: The other table had a normal 2/1 auction to the unenviable 2@s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but ed -- which holding can north have where it is EVER right to play small from dummy?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11 IMPs here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i wonder what 3@H meant|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: a nice auction to a sound contract then|pg||
nt|cindy: another decision|pg||
nt|cindy: to duck or not to duck   that is the question|pg||
nt|ralfwil: how many of you should double on E?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good morning from a frosty Manchester|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting hand -- 4@S looks very close for EW|pg||
nt|werge: They sacrifice against their olwn 4 @s...|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now W can make 5@c if N continues with @d|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: 1st and 3rd position here, we will try to get scores from Sjöberg-Bergström who is second placed.....|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But why not a @s lead? a @h lead is missing a tempo|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: a couple of clubs can be ruffed for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: Yes|pg||
nt|othered1: a109xxx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: A109xx playing small, suit blocked|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes go to www.bbotv.com/vugraph to see open room|pg||
nt|caitlin: has to set up hearts but W will play spades|pg||
nt|caitlin: down one|pg||
pc|s4|nt|thommos: and 9@H switch|pg||
nt|othered1: or Q109xxx|pg||
nt|josj: hi Mark :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: sipping champagne as well i suppose mark|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Good morning Jos!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: ruffing spades is easier|pg||
nt|bg: duck is correct  declarer may only have three dia|pg||
nt|cindy: now a club would be good ?|pg||
nt|snorris: when w finessed @ds|pg||
nt|ralfwil: lucku @d split! K98|pg||
nt|ralfwil: lucky|pg||
nt|sharkey: Defence not missing a beat here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after @CA not taken early - declarer will get last repreive when @DJ falls|pg||
nt|chessmaste: de reigeur on Valentines Day|pg||
nt|josj: cold and sunny here as well|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Kath Nelson|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Now they are all here|pg||
pc|sT|nt|snorris: awful lead|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps 4@S can be defeated by repeated @D leads though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Fred already said that :(|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N looks a reasonable contract here -- actually an easy make|pg||
nt|sybarra: tough to time all the finesses you need here|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The au pair has just opened the Krug Rosé|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good morning from Manchester|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: not so sure about easy to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hard to see how this was allowed to make|pg||
nt|santyclz: Bears repeating.|pg||
nt|josj: lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi kath|pg||
nt|josj: hi Kath|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: admittedly, on a fortunate lie|pg||
nt|sybarra: not so sure its "easy make" either |pg||
nt|daman: double dummy male |pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: Fredin in the tank|pg||
nt|snorris: openers prime suit|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sorry I meant spades of course|pg||
nt|snorris: more luck|pg||
nt|idblu: from the grave:)|pg||
nt|thommos: this should now make 8|pg||
nt|werge: The problem is, that a double from West is take-out - and you are caught |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all 4 vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some don't. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|athene: if he led the @HA, he was threatening to reach dummy in clubs and throw his diamonds on the @HQJ|pg||
nt|athene: so south might have cashed the @DA but that wld kill the entry for the club ruff|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Solid slam bidding|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: hi Martin!|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: needs to play @c before @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: needs to play clubs now |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry for the echo Ralf|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Panja|pg||
nt|mcarroll: hi|pg||
nt|snorris: south thinking about the J of @hs?|pg||
nt|snorris: might be right against another layout|pg||
nt|panja: a small @H and then @S shift by North would lead to some interesting situation|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Agree with a small @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Q109xx possible, but pass from south holding @SA very unlikely -- so maybe playing for stiff or doubleton @SQ is right|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@S also down one on @D lead but likely get club lead|pg||
nt|athene: so it wld be a strange complicated sort of scissors coup|pg||
nt|santyclz: Suit preference discard by e, suggesting @h strength.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|panja: perhaps, W will have to go up with @ha to block...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: Found the teams roster, it is Paul Hackett |pg||
nt|santyclz: n-s seem to be playing udca.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Vladimir and Martin|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: It would seem that South thought that 3@H would be forcing after the 2@S cue - but in that case, 3@d would also be forcing (I assume)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure what the advantage might be of playing a third heart|pg||
nt|shevek: oops|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning Vladimir|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: bad defence!|pg||
nt|idblu: will always lose 2@D unless AQ alone on his left|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry that should have been Q109xx NOT possible|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wilkinsona: so in trying to defeat this contract active defence makes declarers life easy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but running the spades was also poor technique|pg||
nt|athene: sorry if declarer led the @HK i mean not the @HA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: and, let's face it, AKJ876 may be worth a mention |pg||
nt|othered1: still not making this with another @C|pg||
nt|xenya: but 5@C is extremely costly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: same contract in OR|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: getting easier |pg||
nt|cindy: down 2 in open|pg||
nt|irwinbo: still a good game to bid and it should be replicated in the other room|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and a nice defence|pg||
nt|werge: This will bring a morning-score|pg||
nt|xenya: -800 to be exact|pg||
pc|s5|nt|josj: that's what one would expect|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: This is one of the  weaknesses, allowing a 5-card major in a nt-opening|pg||
nt|werge: +8000...|pg||

nt|athene: this is a typical example of why people open 1@S rather than 1@C :)|pg||
nt|athene: you are most likely to play spades most of the time, and often you get an extra trick from concealing the side suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - nowadays minor suits are almost ignored|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Even if East bids more strongly in spades, surely NS would go on in diamonds...dont really understand south selling out in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure what the appeal was all about - or who was involved, but posted standings after swiss qualifying had China Evertrust 5th and Japan Open 4th|pg||

nt|werge: North should have discarded a @s - not a @D, but when he did, it´s very bad play from S to return a @d...|pg||

nt|april7: its a3NT contract with no good lead from N|pg||
nt|chick: no good lead from S either :)|pg||
nt|ady: east will bid 3NT with AJX clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 9 on any lead as flat a pancake hand as u get|pg||
mb|p|nt|hussein2: EW on the OR is the famous world class pair ... Waso - Tsadek|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 9 or ten tricks on normal @H lead|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|april7: this might drop the contract to only 9 tricks  if N finds the Q of @D, otherwise might even go down|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D lead makes it simple|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|april7: its  not a freak weak hand nor a 7 loser hand like in Acol, so what system?|pg||
nt|prof 1: yes very|pg||
pc|c3|nt|viren169: bergen used at the other table to reach 4H|pg||

nt|marlowepi: slam is a reasonable gamble. 5S is the safe bid of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: personally i think the game would be greatly improved if bidding and making 5M paid more than 4M with an overtrick|pg||
nt|snorris: very strange, n opened 1 @d!!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...so a happy start for NS|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S for NW here...|pg||
nt|panja: NS even|pg||
nt|snorris: there are many 11 counts here Werge any opening bids?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 imps |pg||
nt|sybarra: website for tourney |pg||
nt|werge: One more 7 NT...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well Im not sure about that..... but we hoped for more action|pg||
nt|snorris: another weakness is the inability of not being able to inviting slam in minor|pg||
nt|idblu: a push as suggested|pg||
nt|thommos: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me a D from W is for penalty and 2nt is forcing for one round|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - not sure I understand S bidding|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the redouble looked odd to me|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is why I tell my students NOT to underlead Aces vs suit contracts:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now we need pics of the chinese ladies  anyone oblige?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well last time i held 23 and heard LHO open 1N -- we didn't find a making game :)|pg||
nt|xenya: note that 4@S would fail if played by W or if N could geta lead early -- then @C lead beats the contract|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Roland|pg||
nt|xenya: and Martin|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be trappy for n/s|pg||
mb|1N|nt|frankaus: 3@C by W or is it tooo god at these colours|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with stiff S it is important to preempt|pg||
nt|barbyh: not a bad idea|pg||
nt|snorris: 1 @s?|pg||
nt|snorris: well..|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - and bad 11´s...|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html|pg||
nt|ralfwil: it´s very difficult to find a 6-3 fit in a minor, like this|pg||
nt|yo_yo: was he going to double opps?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps it was so he could set up a force.....|pg||
nt|santyclz: Was it a strong nt?|pg||

nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html|pg||
mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: we could call it a "small schlemiel"|pg||
nt|werge: This should be an easy bid for N|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @s|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know NS's NT range?|pg||
nt|sharkey: but then 2@D wudnt be forcing after Dbl?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they will be happy to win 3 imps though|pg||
nt|mpny: the XX must have showed a good hand. if 3H was not forcing, I do not know how one would force|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S will be made but it might be missed here or there|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I prefer D on S before 1@s on that poor suit and I have a 3-card @h|pg||
nt|snorris: 1 @h overbid|pg||
nt|snorris: ??|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 1@s on a 7-card suit?|pg||
nt|snorris: so how many? 3 @h ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: its forcing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ron Klinger has long been an advocate of 4 card overcalls|pg||
nt|snorris: I would|pg||
nt|idblu: that was quick and dirty|pg||
nt|werge: For me too|pg||

nt|fabsayc: not a great 6NT, but will make|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lots of tricks NS as the cards lie|pg||
nt|cindy: 4@s should be ok|pg||
nt|snorris: 6 nt is the contract to be in|pg||
nt|snorris: here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Ron's to blame for this craze is he?|pg||
nt|snorris: 1 @s might show 5|pg||
nt|mpny: no, 2D would almost certainly not be forcing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 3nt|pg||
nt|santyclz: This hand should tell us if e-w are playing precision, w will probably rebid 3@c if so.|pg||
nt|roswolf: however the favorable heart lie is their salvation|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: is this voluntary 3@H likely to be interpreted as strong?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good morning Kath, Mike, Carl andMichael|pg||

nt|yo_yo: hi there|pg||
nt|sharkey: Dbl then 3@D which shud be forcing|pg||
nt|caitlin: too high will be down|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: is this round board a match?|pg||
nt|panja: on a non @H lead...11 tricks i guess|pg||
nt|bg: 4 spades tough with heart lead 3nt also tough with heart lead|pg||
nt|cindy: @h lead unlikely vs 4@s though|pg||
nt|bg: declarer has to duck first round rule of 7 with six cards subtract from 7 and get one therefore duck first round|pg||
nt|cindy: yes   should find it|pg||
nt|sybarra: is it rule of 7 or 11?|pg||
nt|bg: can get 3 spades 3 dia two clubs and one heart|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..judges well to pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not much for E to do with such limited stoppage in ajors and no diamond honor|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Curious from E Partner has opened and he has 11 HP|pg||
nt|sharkey: gd morning Ralf|pg||
nt|werge: Morning|pg||
nt|sharkey: and Hans|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right -- the power of limited opening 1@H, saves East from a painful guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: arrgh|pg||
nt|santyclz: Negative x didn't work out well.|pg||
nt|idblu: 3N...what did E promise?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: or 4 remaining now|pg||
nt|cindy: match a board|pg||
nt|sybarra: no dbl no trbl |pg||
nt|snorris: 990|pg||
nt|werge: Is 1 @s your chice also - NEVER bid such a suit in defensive situation|pg||
nt|xenya: so a huge gain for Japan on the very first board|pg||
nt|idblu: opening bid?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now South will have to make a noise         but no|pg||
mc|12|nt|fabsayc: 3nt looks very conservative|pg||
nt|othered1: fMust b e 13-15 and north knows there's no long suit fit.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ah, possibly|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no nead to sac |pg||
nt|snorris: 3 sp is too little|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a 7-card suit after partners opening and also a support?|pg||
nt|snorris: sounds like just figthing for a partscore|pg||
nt|werge: The @C Q shoyld lead to the right bid = 4 @S|pg||
nt|mpny: yes, 3D rather than 3H would be F, but he got to the right strain|pg||
nt|santyclz: Overall in the matches I've seen the players have been remarkably conservative for juniors.|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't love opening the north hand with 1N, but it's worked out fine.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This should be flat - same contract next door|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the game is missed|pg||
nt|josj: it might have been time for a polite raise by S with 2 aces|pg||
nt|roswolf: i fancy in the other room game will be bid|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Maybe North should have doubled to show a good overcall, although in my book he had already promised a decent hand with 1@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but has North show 15 with a 6 card suit,  i dont think so|pg||

nt|viren169: I agree|pg||
nt|viren169: 1@D opening at the other table|pg||
nt|chick: the 4@D bid may have kept NS out of an unmakeable 4@H|pg||
nt|viren169: competitive auction resulting to 3@C dbled by South|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C good for n/s    the 4-3 fit in spades  dangerous  on heart force|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D is a save   -500  against 600|pg||
nt|april7: again a 3NT by S this time after 1C-1@D - 1@H -3@D- X and then 3NT or 3@C and then 3NT|pg||
nt|april7: X to show @S?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: problems problems|pg||
nt|ady: s spec suggested 3NT  but e/w may well go to 4@D|pg||

nt|mariner1: could be a STOM bid because he is 21 behing|pg||
nt|mariner1: behind|pg||
pc|c2|nt|viren169: 4@D should be d2|pg||
nt|chick: whereas 4@D may go down a bundle|pg||
nt|april7: without the opening NS would be in 2@C or 3@C, so 4@D without the X only 3 down|pg||
nt|chick: maybe 3|pg||
nt|viren169: yes|pg||
nt|chick: sorry, that was about S opening a weak 2 in hearts|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|april7: since @C finesse works W and @H ace  in good position for declarer  could succeedin 4@S|pg||

nt|athene: some people might pass that south hand|pg||
nt|shevek: following an appeal|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hello Fred|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably east should have bid 2h, if partner has spades will still find|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be competitive|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A 20/20 deal for Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I would have seen Fredins smile if Morath had 6@h|pg||
nt|daman: get your popcorn out    this should be fun|pg||
nt|xenya: this might be interesting|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only a part score in @s here, but let´s see|pg||
nt|caitlin: his team went from 20th to 8th|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry 6th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and knew no chance for trump promotion|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont like 11 counts but 54 in the majors  i like|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: indeed some actin|pg||
nt|roswolf: action|pg||
nt|mariner1: can EW make a Moysian 4@S here?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E does not rise on first heart lead from dummy, 3NT makes|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|othered1: 13-15 NT range has some funny results, when it's 15.|pg||
nt|cindy: need to find club fit|pg||
nt|idblu: tell 'em to slow down... we get paid by the hour :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: NS reversed|pg||
nt|sybarra: yeah right!|pg||
nt|caitlin: in 2@H in other room|pg||
nt|shevek: agree with pass here|pg||
nt|sharkey: but won't get there|pg||
nt|athene: you have an open-ended straight flush draw, so it's a clear opener for me|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D looks the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@S looks normal and then?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2M=10-13, 6+suit|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: In OR west failed to raise hearts with 5 it seems...|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15-17 NT at these colors|pg||
nt|caitlin: could this be a DONT type bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  @C + Major  or   DONT  @C + another|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: my bid too on E|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|panja: 1@H for Spade suit...|pg||
nt|cindy: who likes 3@h here ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I like this 3@h!|pg||
nt|snorris: auto...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although South may have overcalled 1@S if he had five and some values |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if South gets a chance to bid 2@H -- we'll know more about 2@C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c with a @h lead|pg||
nt|shevek: values in the short suits not good|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C strong, double is clubs?|pg||
nt|idblu: think they'll play @H's here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: hmm...|pg||
nt|snorris: undo|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S is a better spot than 3Nt, it seems, but it might not be easy to get there..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But you will only earn 100 if it is -1 and loose 170 if made?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 4@h is laydown|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can we put superchargers on EW please|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D  means "System On" over DBL or 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|santyclz: If DONT it improves e's hand.|pg||
nt|caitlin: for any conventions one may not be familiar with the new home for bridge guys is http://www.bridgeguys.com/|pg||
nt|caitlin: mark it off-- a reasonably good site|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah i am blind 3 losers in 5@D|pg||
nt|josj: unluckily yes|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: i can't imagine passing the N hand, in third chair at these colors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but 3D will probably be the contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be the contract |pg||
nt|marlowepi: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: except N will fear S has clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard sometimes plays a 4/3 |pg||
nt|snorris: e-w can 3 @h|pg||
nt|sharkey: Don't understand why W would fail to raise to 3@H in OR when pd bid VUL|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s maybe 4 @c|pg||
nt|bg: 3h ok if partnership understanding that it can be that good|pg||
nt|sybarra: would you bid 4 first time?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East will take some stopping now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H is the best practical bid on W hand even if playing 5-card majors|pg||
nt|idblu: once W can't cue @S, they should stop in 5@C or 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lack of any spade cuebid ought to stop everybody|pg||
nt|cindy: as soon as she finds out they have no @s control the brakes will be put on|pg||
nt|idblu: 5@D|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Never predict a flat board they will always find a way to outwit the commentator!!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me - no opening on S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tournament homepage is http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html  --  i believe the finals are 4 sets of 16 boards|pg||
nt|xenya: i think 2nd trump was a mistake but no doubt she was playing for some other distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: all the same with 32 hcp and 3 tens its worth a look perhaps|pg||
nt|cindy: no  would never bid 4|pg||
nt|snorris: how do you like this nt Hans?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzhn: Efraimsson: You promise 3 trick?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: P - P - 1H - 1NT -3H and now EW do not have an easy time|pg||
nt|barbyh: d1 with a d lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes N could have bid 1@H or more to take advantage of the NV vs VUL 3rd seat|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: some saying 2@H and some 3@H with N here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: back again..|pg||
nt|cindy: i just dont like the fact 3@h takes up so much room|pg||
nt|bg:   clubs great contract|pg||
nt|bg: 6|pg||
nt|cindy: not fond of preempting our side|pg||
nt|snorris: now can s double?|pg||
nt|cindy: sorry marshall|pg||
nt|cindy: im slow typist|pg||
nt|werge: South will not ask for aces in this board....|pg||
nt|sharkey: seems so|pg||
nt|shevek: I believe you Will|pg||
nt|idblu: 3@H here would sound like a cue bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession time --- playing Precision, i would open 1@H in 1st seat|pg||
nt|roswolf: HARD TO RESIST BIDDING GAME|pg||
mb|p|nt|mpny: EW can make 3 of either round suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like a tad high|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@S sure looks like super accept|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: eighth time's the charm! welcome|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Cindy|pg||
nt|frankaus: many here will open 2@H or equivalent with N hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: happy ending|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surely West had a 3 heart bid here..|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S now..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: take the money by a D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that's cuz u worry about typosezb|pg||
nt|cindy: yes :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm with you Ralf|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Me too|pg||
nt|werge: In their system it is probably a reasonable minimum opening|pg||
nt|athene: south, having passed, can make aggressive forward-going moves|pg||
nt|athene: she can't have any more than this|pg||
nt|shevek: Mullamphy opened 1@c with south's|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's not that great a slam |pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice suit, easy rebids and most important -- strength limited by failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: As would I.  But I'd pass here.|pg||
nt|idblu: N will never P here|pg||
nt|santyclz: No, I would have passed with s.|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S may just run the fiamonds and lead a club,hoping to read position|pg||
nt|snorris: the law..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..or there|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - The "LAW" shud compel W to fight to at least 3@H I think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also from the beginning. 5-card support!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4hearts looks ok on a cross ruff play|pg||
nt|othered1: In contemporary bidding 2@H on this auction is pretty much not invitational|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely a push|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: some saying 8H too|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @s showing a better hand than weak shift jump|pg||
nt|panja: play should be interesting....|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Nobuyuki Hayashi, NPC of the Japan Open team on many occasions|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I dislike it intensely|pg||
nt|werge: Better than any other opening with that hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lucky layout for NS given  that they will get a clib lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: 3NT by Hackett|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Although it seems to have worked|pg||
nt|sharkey: % no - but makes :)|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D is aggressive facing a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: Hi, everyone.|pg||
nt|bg: 6 spades goes for 1100 better than 6 cubs|pg||
nt|cindy: was 4N supposed to be keycard there or just general slam try ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting if it was |pg||
nt|npcjpn: I am not sure, but some kind of slam try with direct 5@c shows just competing.|pg||
nt|cindy: well keycard is sorta futile with that void|pg||
nt|cindy: hi nobuyuki :)|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @c - pass 1 @H - pass - ???|pg||
nt|snorris: not the killing lead...|pg||
nt|snorris: I agree Hans|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I have seen so many nt-openings with a singleton major, and I don´t like it|pg||
nt|irwinbo: wd|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure well done|pg||
nt|bg: declarer may get nevous here but cannot go wrong|pg||
nt|bg: nervous|pg||
nt|xenya: only a @S lead beats slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now he must support @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: what is 2nt here can possibly be a raise|pg||
nt|snorris: agree|pg||
nt|cindy: so if general try what should E's bid be ?|pg||
nt|cindy: 5@s i think|pg||
nt|npcjpn: I think so too.|pg||
nt|werge: North had the double! - diamonds behind |pg||
nt|snorris: not much defence in s s hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If you cannot open 1@C it is difficult, but I would open 1@D in that case|pg||
nt|werge: Neither do I, but I was asked about THIS hand |pg||
nt|idblu: he will be nervous after the lead...but all's well that end's well|pg||
nt|thommos: yes, but once Spade Finese works it will be very quick|pg||
nt|thommos: duck QC |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i never remember name of convention where 2m = m + Major :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: notice how DONT effectively preempted NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not a fan of superaccept with 3 card support --- especially when North has said things not breaking well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has 4 al|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is for hearts--four card support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opps wrong glasses|pg||
nt|caitlin: lol:))|pg||
nt|santyclz: The ones full of scotch?|pg||
nt|athene: if you play sensible control-bids, 4@D denies a club control so 4@H confirms one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough call for South on 2nd bid -- RDBL and 2@H both reasonable|pg||
nt|idblu: very nice...catered to the 3@H not being natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done Ino!|pg||
nt|idblu: impressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Marlow do they have a card for that :)|pg||
nt|cindy: how about 1H|pg||
nt|mariner1: Marshall|pg||
nt|panja: if declarer removes trumps early, and then loses @D finesse....he would go down..so he might think of getting Clubs in|pg||
nt|snorris: thats another way to cope yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: Al I had to look twice...thought it was my glasses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S as superaccept may mean they're using the old Walsh Relays  ---  where 2@D is @H OR slam going minor 1-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still has to make it --- @C lead will help a lot|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess that's why I'm watching, not playing.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Ed.|pg||
nt|idblu: Hi Ed...welcome :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: surpiese Morath didnt say no,  just 2 |pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: Board 27, same result at Sjöberg-Bergström table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Efraimsson will soon realise that this was a phantom, but I would have done the same I must confess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E sequence showed a good hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 1@H looked more normal to me,,,,,,,, some kibbers very aggressive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no but it is on a par with 2H or 3H|pg||
nt|barbyh: then he has to make 2 pitches|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yesd he has an Ace - in partner's suit,  Probably a trump trick - and we have seen some really unconvincing opening bids|pg||
nt|panja: difficult for West too..he does not have Club guard..so removing trumps isnt attractive..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think Hackett should have doubled with his @dKJx|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: difficult lead for west though|pg||
nt|sybarra: and @D come crashing down, bridge is easy game |pg||
nt|thommos: a partscore win to N/S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well it's natural for Hanlon to try for game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - almost mirrored shapes, which never play too well|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW would probably not have entered into the bidding on this hand.  3@S by S is normal in many partnerships I believe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no comprende scotch ---  i'm into fermented grapejuice like Zin|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Best line is to win in hand and test clubs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|panja: nothing else seems promising|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 times @h to lock him on the table|pg||
nt|snorris: and hope for 2-2 in minors in n|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as the cards lie win on hand an play a @c to the Q|pg||
nt|panja: my sense is...this will now go @CA, @C ruff, another trumps, and a Club...let us see...declarer, not knowing @D finesse is in...will have to think hard about his options|pg||
nt|cindy: im thinking they werent on same page but it worked out great|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To see if you can afford the safety play in hearts later (small to the ace)|pg||
nt|werge: If they land this slam, it has been quite a start|pg||
nt|athene: but south might now fear that 5@S is askin for good trumps (which she hasn't got) rather than a club control (which she has)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: Or perhaps they have seen pd's overcalls VUL before....|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he heard me!|pg||
nt|idblu: the hesitation indicates no @s K|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this opens up for a @s lead|pg||
nt|idblu: u and me both Joe|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|cindy: i mean   dont ya want a heart lead ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: always a problem! isn´t it?|pg||
nt|sharkey: S pushed OR as well|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Another delicate contract - the 4-1 trump break makes it difficult|pg||
nt|xenya: feels it can be made but, again, a delicate handling is needed here |pg||
pc|s9|nt|othered1: 4@H looks pushy to me, but it did fine partner with a near-perfect 11 count|pg||
nt|snorris: agree|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I suppose Hackett and Hanlon are off to the gold coast congress in Australia|pg||
nt|othered1: Interesting plays at tricks 1 & 2.  This hand has gotten lots less complex|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably doesn't matter -- but can it hurt to play @C9?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|marlowepi: right. that is why he has to read the position|pg||
nt|bg: should play heart now if he draws trump could get in trouble|pg||
nt|cindy: yes   he has all the club spots |pg||
nt|npcjpn: I will tell the operater to catch up the meaning of alerted bid later.|pg||
nt|cindy: ty|pg||
nt|npcjpn: so far we have no clue of 3@h and 5@d.|pg||
nt|cindy: dare we suggest next ?|pg||
nt|idblu: @S can't be wrong|pg||
nt|caitlin: they hear you Roland|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wilkinsona: on the other hand a psychic cue from East may have stood a chance|pg||
nt|idblu: Migr saves time :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok well done|pg||
nt|shevek: problem with opening south's hand is that you'll pull the breaks (like south did in the OR)...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would you say that if K@D was with East?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: T think W should have bid 3@h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The same should happen here|pg||
nt|athene: well - as has been remarked, it's not that great a slam|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or the spades didnt behave?|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the double, showing clubs, makes it slightly better than 50% that the @DK is right|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: heart back |pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt S will be alone in this contract|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Will the one suit squeeze work here?|pg||
nt|xenya: sure -- both 4@S and 5@C look obvious|pg||
nt|snorris: now all is well|pg||
nt|bg: 5dia probably 3 key cards in clubs|pg||
nt|werge: @D now...|pg||
nt|idblu: as well as the @D switch :)|pg||
nt|mpny: this is a very normal result|pg||
pc|c6|nt|snorris: the best yes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I think thats asking a bit|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@h IN THE or|pg||
nt|ahollan1: partner just needs stiff @HJ for @D tap to work -- but no luck today|pg||
nt|othered1: I was away and missed the semifinals, but every time I've seen them, the China Women team has just sat there and taken their tricks, occasionally with aggressive initial actions.  ...|pg||
nt|othered1: I'll be interested in seeing if they can keep this style up.|pg||
nt|idblu: why change when it works|pg||
nt|ahollan1: quoting Barry Rigal "strongest national team"|pg||
nt|idblu: as long as they don't "tilt"|pg||
nt|idblu: and I don't see them doing that|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mariner1: and you know E is very likely to have an opening bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like he is trying to read the position now|pg||
nt|thommos: agreed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and perhaps also E could have bid 3@d instead of 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Strong players indeed|pg||
nt|athene: but against that there are the chances of club ruff, or the @SQ scoring|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wilkinsona: 11 tricks, NP|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jaap Frijling|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wilkinsona: for EW not to fight seems strange (though I may go -200 in 4Hx, I admit)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and stop off conveniently for this congress|pg||
nt|sharkey: S trying to create an endplay - but in vain on the actual layout|pg||
nt|sharkey: also need @S to break|pg||
nt|sharkey: but - no guts - no glory :)|pg||
nt|athene: i would say slam probably comes out at about 50%, so the expectation from bidding or not bidding it is about the same in the long run|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while we wait -- I just checked NS CC -- they do use 2@H opening as weak @H + minor -- but require 55|pg||
nt|jaapfr: gm all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Roland all specs|pg||
nt|xenya: i think the natural line of taking a double finesse in trumps is doomed|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi vlad|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi martin|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|roswolf: now west must hang on to his diamonds|pg||
nt|bg: next|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: which major to finesse....cant go wrong|pg||
nt|panja: still..what if @S were 4-1?|pg||
nt|snorris: not sure if this is the best play , like yours betterPanja|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nice life|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cindy: that sounds right|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Should south hop with @hA?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: Not now, burt if Fredin had played @hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he has nothing elsed to hang onto|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PO Sundelin says he has treatment where 2@D can also be a signoff in @S|pg||
nt|athene: but bidding it is more exciting :) and is certainly consistent with these players' style|pg||
nt|sharkey: can only admire the Chinese ladies|pg||
nt|athene: if you are playing against Chinese ladies and you score +680, you can just write down -13 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: S opened OR - didn't come out|pg||
nt|shevek: this is not vul, but still....|pg||
nt|idblu: I don't think S can handle this|pg||
nt|santyclz: Going to have to take the @c finesse.|pg||
nt|idblu: unless hook @C|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
mc|12|nt|fabsayc: defense slipped after a good opening lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: So it seems |pg||

nt|sharkey: I think E too good to pass - agree with Invite|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: club suit very nasty though|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has to be played by S else a fast set|pg||
nt|hussein2: Guess we will see a smolen sequence after Karim's NT opening here.|pg||
nt|viren169: another good fighting hand...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes who wins - or loses as the case may be|pg||
nt|viren169: lucky 4@S by N/S|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S on finding the Q of @S, but might play for the drop so 1 down, but it depends also on the lead|pg||
nt|chick: about 9 tricks for NS in @S or for EW in @H|pg||
nt|chick: misfits everywhere here|pg||
nt|ady: if south and west pass  North may well open 2@D  if that is in theeir system|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whips are out|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok i was thinking it was Step on  it something or other|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open only in 3@D on board 2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and another possibility|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes slam here too|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1/2 key finesses on|pg||
mb|p|nt|hussein2: Karim will play the hand, but he will easy make relying the on the @h suit|pg||
mb|1C|nt|viren169: depending on guess in spades|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont leave out the club suit for EW|pg||
nt|viren169: wow... 3@D?|pg||
nt|viren169: Is that correct?|pg||
nt|chick: much too good for 3@D in my book|pg||
nt|april7: 3@D is very wrong opening,N cant bid now @S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bet he does|pg||
nt|april7: why 3@D on a legitimate 1 @D opening??|pg||
nt|chick: out of frustration? :)|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe an error...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sharkey: Undo|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: maybe not!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: weird so much for the fight|pg||
nt|april7: 1@D-1@H-2@S weak a posibility of bids|pg||
nt|viren169: interesting choice!|pg||
nt|chick: NS will pay for this bidding if their opposite opponent's find and make 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C I mean|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chick: the S opening is terrible|pg||
nt|chick: but the side that defends wins this hand |pg||
nt|ady: n/s are non vul   but this can lead to a poor result|pg||
nt|chick: E did well not to throw in a heart bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and eventually they may get whacked|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|yo_yo: so this must be a Polish @C?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: ouch this is getting ouchier|pg||
nt|ady: thats the best spot now      down 1|pg||
nt|april7: but 3NT by E works, which E will never find|pg||
nt|yo_yo: usually a weak NT and so it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: @HK likely lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: or not...|pg||
nt|hussein2: Nice lead Nadia|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|hussein2: Bid chance here for a swing - Karim is a good declarer.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Of course S doesnt know the nice @H break|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nor that the D finesse is right getting rid of one c|pg||
nt|april7: it was a fantasy opening by S and worked well|pg||
mb|4D|nt|prof 1: but this 1 will not be bid ,  I THINK|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I bet it is|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|viren169: I fancy !4S to be bid and made at the other table|pg||
nt|chick: 4@D splinter, but W has nothing to cuebid|pg||
mb|4N|nt|prof 1: he dd cue bid??|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|april7: even with @D finesse N will lose because second trump will be led|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be knows the @H break after all...|pg||
nt|chick: that was a helpful lead :(|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: they still probably think they are down in match|pg||
nt|chick: not exactly my idea of a control :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS are women|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i dont know these players, but are North, South and West women?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: ok i am rooting for them then!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well they would be strange names for men|pg||
nt|prof 1: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: it does seem that 3NT will make  as they lay    but  really impossible to bid|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mariner1: but you are a yo_yo :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chick: S asked for a spade lead back, with singleton on the board, N should underlead his A?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: thats what I said|pg||
nt|ady: maybe  a club lead would beat 3NT   |pg||
nt|april7: this will be a very good result for NS|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mariner1: could be|pg||
pc|dT|nt|viren169: I prefer 1@S over 1@D-(1@H)|pg||
nt|prof 1: i think the polish r very lucky ?/|pg||
nt|jcomyn: course these days you never know|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|april7: it was a nice lead but ace of @C ruined the possible downfall|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would they be strange names for women they look pretty strange to an english person anyway|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcomyn: why not continue trump attack|pg||
nt|sharkey: Contract played by N in OR with a @C lead|pg||
nt|april7: SHE should have|pg||
nt|hussein2: Not the best judgment but I beleive he will still make even without the Ace of @c shift|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|viren169: pd is likely to be short in hearts and will be ruffing with the short hand.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|april7: why not showing the weak 6 carder with 2 @S if in their system?|pg||
nt|chick: so probably imps to EW|pg||
nt|viren169: I think N's hand is too good relative to the bidding....|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chick: I dunno, if S passes, N will preempt in diamonds and probably play there|pg||
nt|april7: but only doubled after W opening|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: on board 2 the contract was changed to 6@D so a push|pg||
mc|12|nt|yo_yo: in fact John i bet you cant pronounce them|pg||
pg||
qx|o4|st||md|2SJ98HA98DAK94C873,SA753HQ7DJ63CT654,SKQT2HT652D2CKQJ2,S64HKJ43DQT875CA9|sv|b|nt|ralfwil: a terrible start for NS|pg||
nt|snorris: well he sure knows 5 @h isnt a winner|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if he had ducked @hQ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: happy enough to go +|pg||
nt|cindy: its a little early for psychic cues isnt it|pg||
nt|sybarra: and "next"  joey silver is playing in this tourney|pg||
nt|sybarra: he is on the JUICE team |pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: right NS position|pg||
nt|idblu: they were one of the pretournament favourites...but were 20th after 2 days|pg||
nt|werge: This board looks like coffee|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice EW fit|pg||
nt|sharkey: that's being down on your luck Mike|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very good prizes in this tournament I am told   so worth the stop over|pg||
nt|athene: west might perhaps open 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2N off 1 and 12 imps on last board|pg||
nt|snorris: and now we will know if e-w play strong @c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: once again in OR, EW have stolen an easy partscore it seems|pg||
nt|sharkey: we're doing pretty good Snorri|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But I think this was the correct play. It provides @s 32 and if @cK not is on side @dK must be|pg||
nt|snorris: 6 @d ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h on NS|pg||
nt|snorris: 1 NT?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it was a long time ago, but I still remember :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he won't remember this -- but PO is the only person to ever bid 4N to make after partner and I competed to 3N -- where it worked and pulled in all the matchpoints [25+ years ago - ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm still waiting for chance to do that to somebody else]|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I am always irritated on my partner when he not shows his controls because a weak opening. For me he should have asked for aces|pg||
nt|athene: some people do with that exact hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H-1@S-?   |pg||
nt|yo_yo: so the men are the Japanese Open team, do we know how they did in Beijing?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|snorris: in north|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a nice 6@h and also a cheap save in 7@c|pg||
nt|mpny: here i'm guessing 1H-2C-4C-5C|pg||
nt|idblu: D|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be a quiet partscore|pg||
mb|1D|nt|snorris: 1nt??|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer has a choice of plays in that 6NT in other room, best line not easy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sidekick clues?|pg||
nt|cindy: lolol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is one beefy NT|pg||
nt|cindy: yes meaty|pg||
nt|idblu: 17 prime + 10's galore|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i'd be tempted to open a minor and rebid 2NT. then i would succumb to temptation|pg||
nt|ralfwil: black and no sugar Hans?|pg||
nt|thommos: me too|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6 on for EW but NS will cloud the auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump underlead might have beat it|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely off to the races?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Martin,  welcome|pg||
nt|othered1: Is 7 good enough on, say, @H lead?  |pg||
nt|caitlin: going to slam in other room|pg||
nt|caitlin: friendly clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely not 1NT on that hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neg dbl then @H or some immediate @H raise|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@S-2@H looks normal, nowadays (nobody doubles with north)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: in fact the most reasonable line - but unfortunately it didn't work|pg||
nt|josj: Ino won the seniors, I think|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: was suggested by one spec  " it guarantees 3 tens and the K of trumps lol"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @hJ on S had solved a lot of problems for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NV 1NT would appeal. red is another story. tough call for N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With a singleton? this time minor!|pg||
nt|werge: Here North has no re-bid problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you're on form Carl|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am with you on that guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: both wrong|pg||
nt|sharkey: Sry - S didnt follow up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no - surprising|pg||
nt|xenya: with a less revealing auction, board 3 might produce a swing for the Dutch|pg||
nt|athene: really 1@S?|pg||
nt|athene: the rationale is, you are stuck after 1@H - 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah well, what do i know|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: without the @D10 the defence could still have prevailed|pg||
nt|frankaus: may get to (failing) @H game here|pg||
nt|cindy: cant imagine trying to get to game with S hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: N in 3@H here in Open|pg||
nt|sharkey: well - 13-15 NT it seems - shaded version|pg||
nt|snorris: singelton and all..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3rd in hand... anything goes|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..but turns up with 13 imps in|pg||
nt|cindy: too good for 1N imo|pg||
nt|cindy: probably work out well though since @h10 looks like the lead|pg||
nt|bg: flat 7 should bring pass unless NS starting already to push abit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i have great respect for Hanlon, he must have some cunning scheme|pg||
nt|werge: agree|pg||
nt|athene: for example, 1@H - 1NT; 2@D - 2@H|pg||
nt|idblu: lets try again Al :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my ?  referred to East's bid|pg||
nt|santyclz: I x with n.  That's because my pd declares better than I do.|pg||
nt|idblu: so did I....he wasn't ;istening|pg||
nt|josj: except if there are 2 of them|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pairs or teams?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: after a look at the S hand, I's open 1D as N|pg||
nt|mpny: i do not think 5 would keep EW out of slam anyway|pg||
nt|josj: teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does anyone have a link to some photos?   Nice to see what they look like|pg||
nt|yo_yo: are there any hunks for example :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: same auction to 3@H in both rooms|pg||
nt|cindy: dont want to discourage them from maybe bidding spades|pg||
nt|frankaus: the red game is tempting|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1NT seems straightforward now by S|pg||
nt|sharkey: E not done yet...|pg||
nt|snorris: this is getting exiting|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a clear P on S|pg||
nt|snorris: will w pass?|pg||
nt|snorris: might loose it rigth away if 3 times @h after a loosing @c finesse|pg||
nt|cindy: oops  now what|pg||
nt|bg: sproty balance|pg||
nt|bg: sporty|pg||
nt|snorris: a good contract|pg||
nt|snorris: presuming @d is 3-2|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this auction may get there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like this bidding. With this strong hand 1@d must be the right bid. How can he now show 45 in @h/@d?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bidding 5@C makes it awkward for EW to use Blackwood|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes 7 is quite good, but seems unbiddable|pg||
nt|caitlin: they off to the races now|pg||
nt|othered1: And isn't bidding 7 saying that they are almost certain to be in small slam in the other room?|pg||
nt|bg: good sequence 2nt asks for feature probably|pg||
nt|caitlin: no way they know about 5@CX swing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But they stopped in 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- unless playing with New Zealander -- DBL with North never would occur to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: i think sproty is good adjective here :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: perhaps he refrained from raising for fear of aiding opps?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not that they need it...|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Bruce |pg||
nt|caitlin: won't envision Joey underleading Ace|pg||
nt|caitlin: will they risk it?|pg||
nt|caitlin: :) we are always very proud to say Bruce is Canadian:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is another potential slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If I not will stand up for my opening I should have passed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree Ralf|pg||
nt|athene: now you are a bit good to pass and a bit weak for 2NT|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Dream on|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: will S stop here?|pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lets hope you open diamonds as you may be passed out|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we dont use BW with a void Mike now :)|pg||
nt|othered1: How do you find you 8-card @S fits on part score hands?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 1nt must be 14-16 or e would have invited.|pg||
nt|xenya: @S lead looks best|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: by leading a heart |pg||
nt|ralfwil: And N did!|pg||
nt|snorris: brave north|pg||
nt|sharkey: will he make it?|pg||
nt|snorris: is sveating I suppose a bit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: they didn´use any methods. Stright forward|pg||
nt|caitlin: keep playing another 25 years Al it will happen:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jim Tritt|pg||
nt|wygbe1: hi all|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: cutting the communication|pg||
nt|sybarra: flopping in to 3nt |pg||
nt|roswolf: cutting communications|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: 5Cl -1 not doubled at Sjöberg-Bergström table, they are N/S|pg||
nt|mariner1: our S a little more aggressive|pg||
nt|cindy: might make with @d lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NonVul i would pass with S hand. Vul S is worried about N having e.g. AKxxxx and J of diamonds & stiff spade|pg||
nt|sharkey: not too many entries in N....|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and will probably smile when seeing the table|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep...sneaks home I think|pg||
nt|panja: y, this was based on 32 trumps AND @CK onside|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes if @s10 doesn´t drop|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure i like 3@H|pg||
nt|snorris: after this "reverse" in north they will bid it...I think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: even if they play strong @c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may well, south may think partner has a singleton spade for example|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only after 1nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ms West made a pragmatic bid - crude but effective this time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: take the finesse for free|pg||
nt|caitlin: or is it: I have to take this finesse|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hey Bruce Gowdy:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: and 3@C max with King|pg||
nt|bg: Hi Caitlin/Martin/Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Bruce!|pg||
nt|bg: nice to see our  guys in the fight|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Even a Grand if guesses the @C|pg||
nt|werge: 4 NT = sign off?|pg||
nt|werge: For the grand, he must finess twice in @c...|pg||
nt|geller: Hi all, Bob Geller from Japan|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hi Bob|pg||
nt|geller: I predict Chen will bid 6nt now.  he waas just fishing for 7|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True Hans, |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Bob|pg||
nt|xenya: actually board 3 turned out to be another huge gain for Japan, when the Dutch in OR landed in 3N -- no chance on a @H lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In 7nt he probably will go down as the percentage is for finessing over E|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi jim|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ralfwil: best lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html|pg||
nt|werge: Close to slam here... - without a @h-lead!|pg||
nt|panja: in the meantime, NS seem to have missed a game on B20|pg||
nt|othered1: Not my style|pg||
nt|snorris: 11 tricks easy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that's a lot of cloud to line|pg||
nt|thommos: needed to lead a @H to beat it - I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. I like 6@H|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes at other table Joey Silver from Montreal and John Carruthers from Toronto|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry I don't know the China Women's team but if anyone does, tell us please|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is website I have|pg||
nt|sharkey: E may have to duck @H lead from N|pg||
nt|snorris: the only problem is north might move 6 @d to 6 nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is usually my partners who pass out|pg||
nt|cindy: have you been drinking marshall ?|pg||
nt|idblu: thats a live possibility|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since about the age of 18, but not tonight|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this can go off it seems|pg||
nt|idblu: about 1@D being passed|pg||
nt|idblu: it prob shld go down|pg||
nt|irwinbo: a spade may beat it|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: if the defence set up a spade before the club is knocked out|pg||
nt|idblu: need the @S return tho|pg||
nt|bg: 4s 3nt both ok just need double hook inspades|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all   |pg||
nt|fabsayc: something like that|pg||
nt|werge: will he make 6 @c?|pg||
nt|geller: Furuta may pass but will probably bid 6nt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The Dutch team have to tighten up the leak|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Fred -- as a Canadian -- home of Kokish -- DBL would be BLASHPHEMY|pg||
nt|idblu: I think E hand evaluates to 11+ with the doubleton @S and @C honors well placed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Jim|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: looks like best lead|pg||
nt|snorris: thats auto...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would try to buy for 2|pg||
nt|caitlin: ooppps|pg||
nt|athene: same after 1@H - 1@S; 2@D - 2@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: wud bid 2@H with E hand - too weak for 2 bids I think?|pg||
nt|shevek: this might make but I have my doubts....|pg||
nt|athene: i think it might be pushing things a bit far to open 1nt with it but it's not outrageous|pg||
nt|chessmaste: China on Nelson!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: Lead out of turn is accepted|pg||
nt|josj: not a good omen, Mark :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: N leads @sk|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzhn: Fallenius asked Morath if he showed count or attitude|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but it is important to play @s  from the hand before any other suit|pg||
nt|snorris: how can they not bid game here?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mercifully undoubled|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can cash a few hearts first if they want|pg||
nt|werge: North  should have bid 4 @C - not East...|pg||
nt|sybarra: its just sort of pesky that @S's 3/1 but does not matter here at the end of the day |pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: specs entitled to a partial refund when a 1-level contract is played|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this my be -1, but ok with spades the other way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi cindy|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello cindy,  welcome |pg||
nt|thommos: On @H lead and continuation 3@Hs and 2@Ss|pg||
nt|athene: yes, with east's actual hand, he would just raise hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but i mean those auctions are what west had in mind when he rejected the 1@H opener|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 10 tricks looks very difficult to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think you could push to 2 NT after 2@H if you opened the hand 1@H Will|pg||
nt|Walddk4: China has 5 IMPs more than shown on the scoreboard. They won an appeal|pg||
nt|athene: there's certainly a lot of work to do here|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|idblu: same def in the OR|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: club loses the tempo|pg||
nt|idblu: I would rather play the @H K than a @C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as it happens, but i think the real issue is how W expects to get in enough times. maybe lead a high one to indicate that you are just trying to get PD off possible later endplay, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then E would not be so afraid that W has a stiff spoade|pg||
nt|irwinbo: if i played a club, i would play the 6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: we see the hands of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: leading a heart stakes everything on position of heart ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club is worth considering but must lead a higher one|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like a @h lead is best for the defence|pg||
nt|geller: In the qfinal Japan open was losing 36-0 to China (same 4 members as now) before recovering for an easy win|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s lead for me|pg||
nt|geller: "tighten up the leak", "plug the dikes".....   Let's not go there.  :-)|pg||
nt|idblu: true...bid your 5carders|pg||
nt|othered1: I woudn't criticize taking invitational action on east's hand, I just wouldn't do it.|pg||
nt|xenya: but the @Cs are so favourable for declarer that he will have no trouble making it i think|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Jim|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|snorris: wrong black suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: more @C |pg||
nt|panja: 2@S rebid, holding three Aces..and Jack in partner's suit..is on the conservative side..I dont know what else was available for South though|pg||
nt|cindy: yes luckily neither have the hand to dbl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But as the cards lie declarer may get out for 1 down|pg||
nt|snorris: this is awful bidding|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: North does not want to play in diamonds it seems|pg||
nt|snorris: thinks s has 5 @h and 4 @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now they have missed the best contract. I cannot see how they will make this without a favourable lead|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems harder for East to lead hearts though|pg||
nt|thommos: hi cindy|pg||
nt|caitlin: didnt expect that finesse|pg||
nt|athene: now a diamond i think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now  to count 10 tricks...hmm|pg||
nt|yo_yo: spade?|pg||
nt|athene: you want to set up some diamond ruffs, with the possibility of throwing @S3 on a club later on, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: west in the other room thought it was a 1nt opener as well|pg||
nt|athene: this must be the norm these days|pg||
pc|h2|nt|snorris: that was a grave mistake|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: safe club exit..|pg||
nt|snorris: not playing @s|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess it's a "mixed raise"?|pg||
nt|cindy: still -7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W's chickens now come home to roost. he got what he asked for|pg||
nt|geller: The other semi is Oz vs. China ladies.    |pg||
pc|d5|nt|werge: Because they have seen too many bad opening bids...!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ASnd the beginning of this was the first 1@h|pg||
nt|snorris: reverse dummy maybe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ??????|pg||
nt|snorris: well this will surely not win|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think NS will not tell anyone about this board|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so we will never know Hanlon's cunning plan unfortunately|pg||
nt|idblu: 7 losers opposite an opening bid|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sharkey: nice|pg||
nt|snorris: sneaky..|pg||
nt|werge: Best way to avoid the overtrick, seems to be to lead the @C 9...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's where i was going Fred -- was East too good for 2@H or not -- i think very close -- especially since @C location only presumptive|pg||
nt|sybarra2: spots work well for declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: oh yes, and @Hs, too, are nice|pg||
pc|c3|nt|wilkinsona: but tough guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perfect!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could get messy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It took 6 rounds of bidding in OPen to get to the same contract|pg||
pc|c5|nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I like the 3 heart call.. why let th oppo bid spades|pg||
nt|thommos: the Club lead is normal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Most of players will lead a @c, Yes|pg||
nt|thommos: Still some work for Declarer - @H now and has to find the endplay|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - in my coffee I see 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no a @h lead and you have 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Are you a soothsayer Hans?|pg||
nt|thommos: a @C also lead in the Open room|pg||
nt|werge: I also like 6 @H for sure|pg||
nt|geller: The official score still hasn't been updated  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest09/necj.html|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@H then double isn't bad at all for a description of east, if you can accept making a limit bid and bidding again.|pg||
nt|idblu: presumptive but odds on they fit with pard's @C or were over the overcaller|pg||
pc|cK|nt|snorris: take @c and then @h|pg||
nt|thommos: This will now make 11|pg||
nt|idblu: usually worth a try|pg||
nt|idblu: 14 losers = game|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bg: interesting play decision go allout with club split or ruff a dia and settle for six|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes 3@H 2@S and 2@C, while becaus they split 4-4 only loses 4@Ds|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzhn: and it showed attitude|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Misguessed spades. Now at least 2 down|pg||
nt|cindy: didnt clear that hurdle|pg||
nt|snorris: reverse dummy and a sqezze ?|pg||
nt|snorris: squezze|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|snorris: only 12|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will not do, but in 6@h it had worker with a reverse dummy|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer knows the @SK is right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult to lead out of turn with screens|pg||
nt|yo_yo: presumably they have screens?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|sybarra: if you look at NEC teams and players,  you will see many international stars are in this tourney |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well we can see this will not make looking at the cards, but Hanlon will be trying to make it|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ralfwil: worked.. just witn a @h lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after 1nt there can be a problem if partner not has a @d suit (not bidden)|pg||
nt|athene: the defence could never cash the spade then play a club through|pg||
nt|athene: a very delicate hand, trying to set up winners everywhere and avoid 4 losers along the way|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to draw two rounds of trumps to enjoy a club trick|pg||
nt|athene: and that means only one diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: he must be hoping for one diamond ruff, one pitch on the @SQ and one on the @CK|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|xenya: small slam is as cold as it can be -- a grand would require some inspired play in @Cs|pg||
nt|athene: but south can ruff the @SQ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sharkey: I think a mere 4@D from W is better - 7@H could easily be on|pg||
nt|sharkey: makes now|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Easy - but hard to get accepted!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: yeah|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Nothing to the play here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: WOW i missed the last bid. i guess S thought he had a slam try|pg||
nt|athene: no, can't make i don't think|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: now he has to play @Ss from top|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: 630 at other table|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|geller: 6nt would have been described as "safe as houses" but in the current financial climate SAFER than houses is a better description|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|shevek: cold now?|pg||
nt|athene: on a trump back|pg||
nt|sharkey: no|pg||
nt|athene: declarer couldn't make on a trump back because he couldn't cash either black winner|pg||
nt|athene: but now he can do it|pg||
nt|sharkey: @SQ will be trumped|pg||
nt|athene: just crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: and trump coup south|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff, diamond ruff, @SQ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cindy: its -3 now, right ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|santyclz: Really?|pg||
nt|othered1: playing west for 109 or 108, not unreasonable.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: i don't think they have spade game, so see no need to preempt|pg||
nt|xenya: CR is in 6N too|pg||
nt|othered1: only 1?|pg||
mc|9|nt|mcarroll: They are in 3NT in Open |pg||
nt|snorris: awful chashing 12 tricks in 2 @s|pg||
nt|petergill: Or 10 tricks as the play is going|pg||
nt|werge: They play better than they bid!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a rebis of 2@s on 16 high and a 6-card suit!|pg||
nt|petergill: Earlier, declarer could have safely set up the long club trick.|pg||
nt|snorris: throws @h 12 tricks|pg||
nt|bg: 2 down |pg||
pg||

nt|chick: identical auction at the other table|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S   looks ok for e/w|pg||
nt|april7: another 4@S this time by E after  N will open 1@D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: which pair|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ha ha :)  we learnt Maud and Lily at primary school|pg||
mb|p|nt|hussein2: Karim will be under pressure if the bid was started by 1@h raised to 2 from E|pg||
nt|jcomyn: note the similarity with S and H|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jcomyn: not guaranteed though|pg||
nt|april7: thats the day of light openings|pg||
nt|chick: this is a much better opening than S had last hand|pg||
nt|april7: y, and E will plaqy 4@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Can you sing Come Into The Garden Maud|pg||
mb|1D|nt|april7: on a good guess and safety play in @S S caqn make 4|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@H and 3@S may make with the right view in the trump suit|pg||
nt|hussein2: Now Kordy will be under pressure if Karim opened with a x|pg||
nt|viren169: the more hearts you have the better I like the hand...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: only the first line|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chick: but the @D singleton makes it dangerous if S doesn't have spades|pg||
nt|chick: no place to run|pg||
mb|p|nt|hussein2: They play lebensohl here, lets see what is he going to do ....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: on the face of it 3 losers but....|pg||
nt|april7: whats 2@S, it can't be a strong jump shift as it was years ago, or what is it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: X was not the best idea, @S is much better and then S reaqches even 4|pg||
nt|hussein2: good judgment|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some might open W hand with 1@H|pg||
nt|april7: true!!!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree but it is vul so should be decent 2H|pg||
nt|april7: its a good 1 @H opening in my opinion|pg||
nt|viren169: true... can and will bid 2@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Iopen 1NT on this S hand now he has a problem|pg||
nt|april7: another partscorefor NS in @H @S or NT|pg||
nt|viren169: interesting N's hand... 1N or !1H|pg||
nt|chick: interesting ... they must play some sort of intermediate jump shift|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in fact I can sing the first line of most songs|pg||
nt|chick: at least a @D lead won't hurt|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mariner1: on 3 Open is in 4@S so no slam|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|hussein2: This is the time for a swing|pg||
nt|hussein2: lots of comlications down here |pg||
nt|hussein2: *complications|pg||
nt|hussein2: I would bid 4@s Karim's hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is there an oops coming|pg||
nt|jcomyn: For the Bat Black Night has flown - come into the garden maud  I am here at the gate alone and so on|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|chick: I usually decide by looking at my rebid ... if I don't have a good one, I open 1N |pg||
nt|jcomyn: a clear 1NT for me|pg||
nt|viren169: South is taking a view or two...|pg||
nt|chick: yep|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume 2NT wud be Lebensohl by N - thus he's now trying to describe his hand further after the "forced" 2@S bid by bidding 3 NT denying 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I agree I prefer 1N|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|jcomyn: well the lead certainly helps|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course the 2H bid helps declarer with distribution|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will be fairly sure S are 4-1|pg||
nt|april7: its a safety play in @S if K of @S is played first|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D return now may result in 2@S tricks - to avoid potential ruff|pg||
nt|hussein2: Tough hand with the @s break|pg||
nt|ady: will need the diamond fesses to make   no good discard a diamond on tghe K@C after playing a club|pg||

nt|jcomyn: yes he usually does|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what about Lily - cant think of anything|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|april7: a @H ruff could come up, but it wont hurt if E takes the A and play s @S, now E will be down|pg||

pc|h2|pg||

pc|c5|nt|hussein2: nice shift|pg||

nt|april7: S is not sure what to throw on the @D|pg||

pc|s4|nt|jcomyn: he can hrow the CJ for sure and one S|pg||
nt|april7: E should have ducked first @C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not bad|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hussein2: WOW|pg||

nt|roswolf: and another possible slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thanks all. Nice to work with you. I wish you a nice sunday afternoon|pg||
nt|sybarra: I believe we talked yesterday about the club "we" are seeing with 2200+ members |pg||
nt|roswolf: why didnt south show spades as well?|pg||
nt|sybarra: quite a large contingent |pg||
nt|mariner1: guilty by proximity|pg||

nt|yo_yo: interesting that the Chinese ladies didnt try for game|pg||
nt|wygbe1: well 4h will probably make |pg||
mb|1S|nt|panja: NS dont make 4@S here..because of @C ruff..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but be bid?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: They are off Nelson!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yep|pg||
nt|josj: once again N holds QJx in a vital suit, this time to beat a slam|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 19-20  i am informed ty Al|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so they might not get too high|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: could get murky now|pg||
nt|xenya: are we sure 3@D is not a 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 @S - 1 NT - 2@C - 2@S?|pg||
nt|snorris: then there might be a fight|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 1@s - 1nt - 2@c -2@s?|pg||
nt|snorris: west will bid on though|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, 4@D splinter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: mind you, my openings are sounder than this one|pg||
nt|snorris: might be hard to reach|pg||
nt|cindy: looks like 3N this time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a good case for opening 1S. 1C is clear second choice for me|pg||
nt|idblu: the same 1/2 imp?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hard now to stop|pg||
mb|2S|nt|frankaus: green so can afford to be conservative |pg||
nt|irwinbo: is looks right to me|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be tricky to defend 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think they will get there|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont like to distort my distribution with a full opening bid|pg||
nt|josj: they should, however, as slam is well over 75%|pg||
nt|josj: board should be a push at 6@C-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in the US the green party is NOT conservative|pg||
nt|snorris: 5 @h on|pg||
nt|panja: I dont like E's pass....|pg||
nt|werge: Then 5 @h is lay-down, South has given the solution for palying @d-suit|pg||
nt|cindy: next :-)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: does anyone of you know what 2@d opening means?|pg||
nt|snorris: think w has to bid it himself|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @d on a nt seems to be majors|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west likely to bid it, though missed in the other room|pg||
nt|idblu: 3rd chair allows a 4 card major opening...especially with a suit as good as this|pg||
nt|cindy: dont play in a womens event|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good principle cindy. but i don;t really see what bad can happen after 1S|pg||
nt|cindy: they will rake you across the coals for doing that|pg||
nt|sybarra: jamming the auction perhaps to no avail |pg||
nt|thommos: hard to bid 7S now|pg||
nt|sharkey: in @D it is - but dont think they'll end up in 7@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you want to check out EW Convention Card from 2007, try [sorry, i still don't know how to make smaller URLs]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2007BermudaBowlShanghai/bermuda-bowl/Japan/TeramotoTakayama.pdf|pg||
nt|caitlin: they likely have another way to show weaker preempts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might make if you just blast to slam|pg||
nt|athene: well it was an interesting bidding decision for east, facing a strong notrump - perhaps the australian's 1NT is a point stronger than the Chinese?|pg||
nt|sharkey: In OR W didnt inquire with Stayman - just blasted into 4@H via transfer.  Cud have missed 4-4 @S fit|pg||
nt|wygbe1: impossible to bid, especially after 1nt overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: wonder if they had a 2 suited call |pg||
nt|caitlin: at other table @D lead from North but did take @SQ finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now 2@S|pg||
nt|josj: 6nt is down a lot :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: they could have had 800 in 3@D x|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I dont know their defence bidding, but this can be a 2-suiter with @s and @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: I believe there were no alert on 3D|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS may play 2/1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I´m not quite sure of 4@d. It looks like E has red cards and it could help them to find the @d split|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @c|pg||
nt|idblu: pards a passed hand...you expect to get to a game?|pg||
nt|cindy: well  i want to have a chance to get to game if its right|pg||
nt|sharkey: guess it proves that science not always better :)|pg||
nt|athene: i like that action|pg||
nt|athene: it's pretty rare that you want to play in spades with west's hand facing 1nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think the Chines Women use a 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nothing showing on web page about carryover, but haven't read conditions of contest|pg||
pc|h8|nt|othered1: I wonder how ambiguous east's hand is in their style|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which made the chosen line clearly a swing line|pg||
nt|xenya: easy 4@H for NS. There is a cheap @D save for EW but they are ublikely to find it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: had anyone of you bid 2@d on E? I had|pg||
nt|roswolf: this isnt|pg||
nt|josj: very well bid btw|pg||
nt|roswolf: east offering a choice|pg||
pc|hT|nt|panja: in these superfit situations it pays to bid one more...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but, then only 9 tricks were made|pg||
nt|snorris: then 3@h and ..|pg||
nt|bg: same auction as before N had a feature here none will settle in game|pg||
nt|othered1: AS the cards lie, east isn't a favorite at all to find @S lead|pg||
nt|idblu: the teams that finished ahead of the team they were playing had a 1/2 imp c/o|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if  3@D-3@H 4@H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes |pg||
nt|josj: the quanti raise often suggests a minor|pg||
nt|josj: (or two)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: 2@S forcing?|pg||
nt|sybarra: W might have found it |pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|werge: Passive E/W - 5 @D...|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice lead, but declarer can pitch dummy's third @D on @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but if half imp comes into play in 64 board match we're in for a great time tonight|pg||
nt|idblu: in the 1/4's and semis|pg||
nt|idblu: good bid 2@H|pg||
nt|sybarra2: waiting for next X?|pg||
nt|idblu: might inspire S to bid more|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|barbyh: is this conventional or a psych|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if club system?|pg||
nt|snorris: thinking about 2nt?|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer got the clubs right to score 9 tricks OR, even after a heart lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When playing 1nt forcing, there always is problems with hands like S|pg||
nt|snorris: well done west|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thought it was 3 clubs last time|pg||
nt|cindy: N was sorta fixed for a bid|pg||
nt|idblu: keycarding with a void hard to work out|pg||
nt|cindy: what could he do ?|pg||
nt|idblu: he was strapped...on a guess|pg||
nt|bg: 7 spades would make provided S cashes AK dia before 3 rd club|pg||
nt|mpny: apparently|pg||
nt|idblu: almost came into play last night against JUICE|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 rounds of @C to discard dummy's @D -- but great try|pg||
pc|d8|nt|wilkinsona: once again the Chinese woman win the auction|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Tony, 2@c was a little bit weak|pg||
nt|snorris: east knows south has 4 @h so didnt dear bid more|pg||
nt|thommos: this lead will be well received by declarer|pg||
nt|werge: With this lead = 3 NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if they play weak jump shifts it's forcing yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW are using upside-down count & attitude, so 8@H = frown|pg||
nt|othered1: And, indeed, at other table south is declarer after a multi and transfer auction|pg||
nt|yo_yo: smolen in action :)|pg||
nt|athene: @SAK and a trump to lose here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharkey: Yes - If 1 NT forcing 2@S shud show a mere preference or weak @S raise|pg||
nt|snorris: @d lead?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -2!|pg||
nt|snorris: might get it undoubled'|pg||
nt|panja: no point in defending against superfit..you never know what will get ruffed..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: however steals the contract... perhaps as south has shown hearts|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: its not really right though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1S hardly prevents me from getting to game|pg||
nt|idblu: well they got to game...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may have to drop that spade Q to stand a chance..|pg||
nt|irwinbo: they rate to go down on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|idblu: that he won't do|pg||
nt|idblu: maybe they play Roth-Stone?|pg||
nt|idblu: N passes 12+ hands frequently|pg||
nt|werge: They are too happy with their double-stopper in @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: some play it constructive I believe|pg||
nt|werge: Run to 4 @H|pg||
nt|mpny: 4H is making|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt instead of a better 4@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: S doesnt know pd has 6@H|pg||
nt|mpny: I hate the dbl. the opponents are unlimited, your Spades are not that great. why should partner have a trick|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud bid 4@D|pg||
nt|caitlin: same auction open room|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tinyurl for cc: http://tinyurl.com/boohrd|pg||
nt|caitlin: Joe, we know why Roland 'hired' you:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now @H7 = current count [odd]|pg||
nt|santyclz: For my comedy relief?|pg||
nt|caitlin: that too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think heart 7 was actually spade signal|pg||
nt|yo_yo: frue will be glad to be dummy, to recover from that last one|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like the double indicated @Ds -- good use of opponents' transfers |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yesterday the slams I saw them bid were all making|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cindy: i think the pass is curious|pg||
nt|snorris: still should win 8 tricks|pg||
nt|caitlin: also in 4 in open room|pg||
nt|shevek: real score is 64-29 due to an appeal|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|barbyh: oops|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 9 with a right guess in @c|pg||
nt|snorris: the @cs are the key|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: once again 9 tricks pos if declare gets the clubs|pg||
nt|snorris: small @h from west to show @c|pg||
nt|panja: how does W show that he wants @C now?|pg||
nt|snorris: interest|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same bidding next door|pg||
nt|irwinbo: for all of its 11 points, the north hand is only worth 1nt over 1 diamond|pg||
nt|cindy: hard to bid 7 without knowing about trump Q|pg||
nt|thommos: it is not a good 7, |pg||
nt|sybarra: at the moment,  S probably just as happy to be in 6 |pg||
nt|cindy: and they dont have it even|pg||
nt|sharkey: @S lead @C shift|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not show this over 2@s with 3@h instead of 2nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Mike - cud have been overtricks too|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in evaluating S hand it could help too|pg||
nt|wygbe1: it gave n a chance to upgrade his stiff d, if s elected to show a superaccept|pg||
nt|xenya: sure|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but it should be a flat board|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/press/pdf/2007_sekai_3.pdf|pg||
nt|josj: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: photo of JAPAN OPEN Team at the top|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|panja: not a pause and small @H though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10 tricks after that lead and only 7 with a @s lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very aggressive double - why should a spade lead be best anyway?|pg||
nt|mpny: the C shift should still be easy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
pc|s4|nt|werge: Look at dummy,pls|pg||
nt|idblu: @S to A @D down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: diamonds need to be led twice from dummy so..|pg||
nt|cindy: no it isnt|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: hmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: so who leads a @H on this auction?|pg||
nt|barbyh: whoever is on lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: so a push |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so the landslide continues|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the lead solves the problem of how to play trumps|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|cindy: thing universal heart lead|pg||
nt|cindy: think|pg||
nt|snorris: semms like it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: NS could have competed here, too, but can't make much if EW find the @C ruffs|pg||
nt|othered1: But opening lead there was also @D|pg||
nt|shevek: 64 - 29.5 actually (Oz has 0.5 carryover)  from Elmer|pg||
nt|athene: now you could throw either spades or clubs on the diamonds|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: curious or timid. like the 60's film "i am curious yellow"|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may need to 'splain  this one  |pg||
nt|snorris: a good jack.. will it help+|pg||
nt|snorris: ?|pg||
nt|panja: y, no need to show any interest...a look at dummy tells you it must be Clubs|pg||
nt|panja: still, I wonder why none of EW doubled....|pg||
nt|snorris: Harada pondering|pg||
nt|snorris: seems|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzhn: "Take a chance with the 9|pg||
nt|caitlin: by West|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but he found @cK|pg||
nt|idblu: all conjecture now|pg||
nt|idblu: if he cashes a 2nd @D he will be happier|pg||
nt|thommos: qC next is ok|pg||
nt|idblu: but @DK before pitching is better technique|pg||
nt|sharkey: woman intuition may apply :) - looks like down 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you can't argue with that|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as I play - with a weak hand I bid 2 @h over 1@s showing a 6-card suit and 2@d with a stronger hand, so 3@h is my bid after 2@s |pg||
nt|sharkey: never tried....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not worth it|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: Agree Ralf - but you mave a a problem getting to 3NT then|pg||
nt|idblu: was a great lead...once again|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cindy: heh|pg||
nt|cindy: i am curious green|pg||
nt|frankaus: i use green as NV  no doubt u have worked it out|pg||
nt|snorris: then he should be in 5!|pg||
nt|thommos: or ruff @H club to the Q|pg||
nt|idblu: @D10 looks right..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: won't help|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|wilkinsona: tries the spade hook|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i hate 4333 hands|pg||
nt|idblu: stalling for time ... 0% play now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: plain sailing|pg||
nt|athene: but the clubs only require two pitches not three|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: a finess in @c for safe|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|barbyh: hope so|pg||
nt|cindy: well    they have 24 hcp|pg||
nt|werge: But East should havr cashed his other red Ace|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: claim coming |pg||
nt|ahollan1: as advertised -- well done on both sides|pg||
nt|idblu: that certainly won't|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cindy: probably makes 5C but tuff to bid that|pg||
nt|snorris: running home?|pg||
nt|panja: small @D is risky|pg||
nt|panja: had this been a doubled contract..on the @C3 return..E might have been tempted to play a small @D...|pg||
nt|bg: 1 imp to Japan|pg||
nt|sharkey: unexpected - but dont think it matters|pg||
nt|athene: just a question now of how to play trumps|pg||
nt|athene: probably @HA and another|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: need your guessing shoes on for 5 @C but sure close to it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @hA and all is over|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i hate more hands than that. there must be at least 5000 hands i hate|pg||
nt|santyclz: In a fair world, w would ruff the 3rd @c.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bg: sry|pg||
nt|thommos: A high @C was lead in the OR|pg||
nt|athene: or not :)|pg||
nt|athene: i was thinking Del'Monte might have been worried about a spade over-ruff now|pg||
nt|athene: but probably he trusts that if the defence had a spade ruff, they would have taken it|pg||
nt|athene: so playing for them to have misdefended is just a grosvenor coup|pg||
nt|santyclz: Simplifying the play.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cindy: just have to find @dQ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is the women's team the finalists at Beijing?|pg||
nt|bg: should have drawn trump before second dia doesnt matter here but it could have with hearts 4-1|pg||
nt|shevek: good point raised by Roland, maybe 32 bds in the semi-final not enough?|pg||
mc|8|nt|mpny: well now -1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no entrance to @sK|pg||

nt|sharkey: The result on that board was really swinging back and forth|pg||
nt|vugraphzka: my falt to contin. with them, they  play verry quick|pg||
nt|sharkey: A mundane 3 NT|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... pretty ending|pg||
nt|april7: 2@S and 2NT by E?|pg||
nt|viren169: 2S will give East a problem|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and S|pg||
nt|viren169: Even bigger problem!|pg||
nt|chick: 2@S pretty junky for 1st seat vul|pg||
nt|viren169: South's problem will be solved by East's 2N|pg||
nt|chick: even if he had taken @HA at trick one, NS would still get the ruff|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nice Ghestem hand over 1H|pg||
nt|april7: but its not aenough only 1 ruff|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this wont stop below the 5 level|pg||
nt|jcomyn: begor that was some recovery|pg||
nt|mariner1: did that 3n really make?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: we might as well give the answer - Lily Of Laguna|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hussein2: 3NT is easy here, only threat is Kordy passing 1NT with his flat destribution|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: did not realise he finessed heart at trick one     can make if rising with the ace   and playing a club    but will need the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|chick: you're right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh yesssss|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: with a 9-count never|pg||
nt|sharkey: Undo|pg||
mb|2H|nt|viren169: I dont like 2@S, but I can understand it|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@D=single maj I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: or maybe not!|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: known as Super Landy|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mariner1: EW could make 4@H here,,, not that they should be in it|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharkey: Not Vul he cannot afford to |pg||
nt|Walddk4: I just got our two matches in round 1 of the Yeh Bros Cup, starting in 10 hours and a bit in Australia. Yeh vs Netherlands and Australia Open vs Sweden|pg||
nt|viren169: or maybe!|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 9 tricks because nice @H split|pg||
nt|viren169: I prefer to dble with South's hand|pg||
nt|viren169: any comments?|pg||
nt|viren169: for the dble...|pg||
nt|april7: 5@C makes on good and lucky play by EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|hussein2: There is a potential for 10th with an endplay|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yes but they are on a real roll|pg||
pc|d4|nt|prof 1: y they dd not mention @s????|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|april7: or without @C leads good guess in @S|pg||
nt|chick: depends on their agreements|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant believe NS allowed to play in 4H in open room|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  have 10 tricks in spades   with club quuen onside     e/w will probably saved in 5@S here    but 5 hearts might go down|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: shell shocked maybe|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS are in 2@S here in Open|pg||
pc|cK|nt|viren169: tough lead for East|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not for me I never X a strong NT|pg||
nt|viren169: what does dble mean in ur system?|pg||
nt|chick: 6@H certainly will|pg||
nt|jcomyn: there are times in Bridge when you believe you can walk on water|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hussein2: guess he will play @S now to secure his contract against @h4-2 break|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C lead OR|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jcomyn: not for penalties I mean|pg||
nt|ady: way overboard      no phantome from e/w|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|april7: depends  on the convention, in DONT its ok|pg||
nt|viren169: yes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|april7: 8 tricks on careful play by N|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: now only down 1|pg||
nt|chick: if they only knew how close it is now, they can give up any swinging and just play well |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|april7: N should have played the 10 or J first trick to have an entry more to hand with 9 of @H|pg||
nt|viren169: North also passed at the other table|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|jcomyn: there is no way on earth I would allow NS to play in a vul game holding that E hand|pg||
nt|chick: E might consider X'ing 4@C to show his other suit|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: I am sure he would not have passed 4@H|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|april7: I don't understamd the @C play,do you?|pg||
nt|hussein2: He is trying to reach a strip squeeze count by throwing someone with the last @c|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the dont play back a club system|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - rying to muddle things up by playing @C - could backfire too|pg||
nt|hussein2: He will cash his winers hoping to endplay someone with the last @c or @h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: everything lying well|pg||

nt|cindy: one of my partners says the @D10 there is a trick card to give yourself a chance to go down|pg||
nt|cindy: would always make it if u didnt have that tricky 10|pg||
nt|snorris: jep|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Not even trying for 9?|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud be down if @C AJ behand and @H5-3?|pg||
nt|panja: West must play @C8 to give the ruff, not @C3|pg||
nt|bg: good guess  opps too busy signaling;))|pg||
nt|snorris: 40-0!!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Im not sure I follow wests pass of 1 spade x...|pg||
nt|snorris: well.. no not enough|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well done to the ladies|pg||
nt|sharkey: difference in style - NS only got to 2@D other room...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very much so - the final pass looks rather pessimistic|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is becoming embarassing|pg||
nt|xenya: even 6@D would have been profitable for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fred -- i'm sure that was me|pg||
nt|idblu: I thought so|pg||
nt|xenya: still it's hard to see S bid 4@H all on his own -- N had an opportunity to insert 3@H over 3@D |pg||
nt|mcarroll: same contract in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: the Seniors are taking a big lead early here|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|cindy: 3N could be a struggle |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 40-0 after 6 boards! unbelieveable!|pg||
nt|irwinbo: the problem with i diamond is that when partner bids one spade you have to bid 2nt|pg||
nt|idblu: 1N n/s a good spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: Micry fends kisses  by E|pg||
nt|werge: Ah - some fun - bad @s-break|pg||
nt|sharkey: sure looks like it's worth a raise in my book|pg||
nt|caitlin: China has its stride|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: 1@D = 1+ @D?|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @h vs 4@s|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...maybe its the 4 card overcalls|pg||
nt|irwinbo: ca't be|pg||
nt|xenya: anyone know what 2@C is?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but no use of that with only singleton @s|pg||
nt|snorris: redouble might mean something special|pg||
nt|cindy: this cant be right|pg||
nt|idblu: THATS  a weak NT|pg||
nt|bg: 1430 may lose an imp should make 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i once lost a 7 board set to Meckwell by over 60 -- everyone on their team won a christmas tree|pg||
nt|bg: somwe kind of part score here- as Joey Silver would say--next|pg||
nt|othered1: north might bid some NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: will never guess the @H  |pg||
nt|caitlin: I will be very surprised if Mori bids 2N; it is his least favourite bid |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a bad split in @h and a @c lead will make it difficult in 4@h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: dbl!|pg||
nt|idblu: yea...but living in Arizona slants your views on life :)|pg||
nt|othered1: game isn't particularly goo dhere|pg||
nt|idblu: 13 tricks...can they bid it|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7@d would appear to be pretty good, 7nt less so, but making.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y but after 1nt which N believes in game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks hiroaki|pg||
nt|roswolf: another slam zone hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|othered1: Compare this hand with the last east opened -- that's a pretty good range in a limited opening system.|pg||
nt|snorris: like an honor in @s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a lot of matches have had wild swings of momentum|pg||
nt|athene: south has a good hand for a non-forcing 2@D bid but not many people play that outside Poland|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: roses are saying "we've senior big lead and are not scared"|pg||
nt|cindy: harhar|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok folks,  I am going to leave you, breakfast meeting are not my thing, but have an early one tomorrow |pg||
nt|sharkey: and almost opening hand?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but we didn´t see what EW discarded on @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But W had made 5@h after the 4@d bid!|pg||
nt|snorris: better pass..|pg||
nt|snorris: south|pg||
nt|idblu: yes...I am surprised he didn't make 7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: miss a vulnerable game. Gain 12 imps. Too easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: there you go |pg||
nt|fabsayc: lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: but he had no other bid:)|pg||
nt|othered1: That, invitational, feels about what it is worth.  But maybe 2@D forces to far|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe showing 0-7 :)|pg||
nt|athene: sorry WEST has a good hand...|pg||
nt|wygbe1: tough bid for s here|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i think 3h would be my choice|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: only part scores here|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @s a fit bid it seems|pg||
nt|ralfwil: One of my principles. Dont tell too mych in a competitive bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: much....|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: suppose so..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: rather strange to land in only 2@d in OR|pg||

nt|snorris: arrgg..|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|werge: 2@C should include a weak minor-2|pg||
nt|xenya: there have been several suggestions from the kibitzers as to the meaning of the 2@C bid|pg||
nt|werge: D = do not lead @D?|pg||
nt|idblu: yes...7@D once they find the fit|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the @H Q falling makes 4@H but not an obvious play |pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: In this position I play D showing a 4-card suit and 1@s shows a 5-card suit. Do youplay like that?|pg||
nt|irwinbo: can't|pg||
nt|caitlin: he often says...now watch them run hearts at me or whatever|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if south could have bid a non-invitational 3@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: another advers sacrifice|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 4@D bid is a strong clue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may well do so |pg||
nt|snorris: the woes will never end|pg||
nt|snorris: I do|pg||
nt|thommos: what do you all play the pass from South as?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@c checkback|pg||
nt|xenya: all very different|pg||
nt|idblu: try Canada....|pg||
nt|santyclz: Mirror distribution.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i had skewed perspective in other states too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now 4@D, ace asking?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=BAL 8+ game force|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does he know something.....|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be murder|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 5 @h only -1|pg||
nt|snorris: but no|pg||
nt|ralfwil: often difficult in reversed vulnerable|pg||
nt|panja: neither the 1@C opening not this pass of 4@S by W bid are easy to understand...I mean the ratinale behind either|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 2NT is a puppet to 3@c, then 3NT shows 3@s and 4@h.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: or cue all the way |pg||
nt|idblu: 3@S Q|pg||
nt|idblu: cue|pg||
nt|josj: 2@D is safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: sensible run out|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H could be the contract which has tough chances|pg||
nt|marlowepi: deepfinesse makes 4H i bet|pg||
nt|snorris: 3nt is difficult |pg||
nt|snorris: with @d lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was first push bd |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe righting the ship for Israel |pg||
nt|bg: not sure what those bids meant but contact is right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if NS play 2 way Stayman [part of original Precision]   I like 2@C rather than 2@D - because East will never make a lead directing DBL|pg||
pc|c9|nt|wilkinsona: easy now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: important to play E for the right A with a @d lead, but now....|pg||
nt|snorris: well west doesnt know if east has @ds|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree with @S lead?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no!|pg||
nt|othered1: agree on @S play, but it's not guaranteed|pg||
nt|snorris: can he slip this home+|pg||
nt|snorris: ?|pg||
nt|werge: Yes|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, most would bid 1 spade by west|pg||
nt|cindy: at the 1 level i usually play no preference|pg||
nt|cindy: only at 1 level though|pg||
nt|thommos: above one level as penalty?|pg||
nt|cindy: yes|pg||
nt|thommos: 3NT likely to make 11|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H invitational values I assume|pg||
nt|athene: this looks to be down only one?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Wang has a good hand for 2@S dont you think?|pg||
nt|othered1: even 3@S needs some racing luck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 1N=14-16, i think hand might be too good, if 15-17, just right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: x@D lead:)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: was one spade like a forcing nt?|pg||
nt|xenya: this will probably fail|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with this super lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: NS in Open are in 2@D only|pg||
nt|cindy: the are fluctuating between conservative and aggressive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wish they would let ME do that when i lead|pg||
nt|idblu: tuff dummy to lead into|pg||
nt|cindy: nothing good to do here it seems      another spade ?|pg||
nt|idblu: whtas his is his|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D unlikely to cost|pg||
nt|cindy: i would like to play it penalty at 1 level too but cant get any of my partners to play it that way :)|pg||
nt|athene: for two down, the defence have to get a diamond ruff AND stop the spade ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another good lead|pg||
nt|othered1: How would you play this, needing lots of good things to happen?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cindy: this could be a push also|pg||
nt|npcjpn: it is a kind of puppet stayman, in case opener has 5@s.|pg||
nt|thommos: I do play it as penalties|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and extremely unlucky mirroring it is Joe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Liu is out for blood|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "congressive"--good description|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 times @h maby?|pg||
nt|snorris: maybe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only if EW not take their 2@h and 3@s tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well defence has 5 on top now|pg||
nt|cindy: well then  you could be my partner|pg||
nt|idblu: obviously they have never played rubber bridge|pg||
nt|idblu: @D's have been set|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cindy: yes !!|pg||
nt|cindy: excellent|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: spade does not look unreasonable really|pg||
nt|sharkey: always good in the post-mortem to lead pd's suit - unless you have a very good reason to do otherwise|pg||
nt|mpny: that was a very good stop|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we like that opening bid?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@h is better than 2@s but how stop there?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this may make, if West can hold the trump losers to two|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - only 8 tricks with best defence I think|pg||
nt|xenya: to quote a kibitzer: their CC say "w2 in @D or GF one-suiter or 20-21 bal"  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for spectators -- mirroring is when both hands of partnerhip have exact same distribution|pg||
pc|h9|nt|panja: down now|pg||
nt|cindy: E wishes he could have S lead again|pg||
nt|bg: double dummy low cub to 9 low spade to queen this could be made|pg||
nt|cindy: poor Levin   always in a potential endplay situation |pg||
nt|bg: drop spade king great play if he finds it|pg||
nt|cindy: he is thinking about it|pg||
nt|sybarra: best if in tempo|pg||
nt|sybarra: or closer tempo than this |pg||
nt|cindy: cant use the phone excuse in live bridge|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence need to find a diamond ruff it seems|pg||
nt|werge: WHICH trump will North lead?|pg||
nt|santyclz: On a trump lead, I'd pull, take the @c finesse eliminate and exit in @hs.  As I said, my pd declares better than I.|pg||
nt|santyclz: If the get to 6@ss, I hope e doesn't x.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: they missed their 4-4 fit in @s and found the best contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so no discards or ruffs available for extra tricks|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: (they)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is now a messy auction|pg||
nt|josj: slam seems far away|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|snorris: so now is the time..|pg||
nt|bg: safer to play it as no preference frequency of having right cards for a penalty is too low|pg||
nt|chessmaste: North was lucky his side had an escape from 2@C redoubled|pg||
pc|s3|nt|snorris: the weakness of the strong @c systems is the 1 @d bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be tricky to cash these spades though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If I open with 1@d ny next bid would be 2@C|pg||
nt|athene: whether the @D9 can be read depends on what sort of count signals the Chinese ladies play|pg||
nt|athene: if they play upside down, it has to be a singleton|pg||
nt|shevek: note Ish played the 8 not the 6|pg||
nt|idblu: needs @C hook now|pg||
nt|josj: the X was optimistic, too|pg||
pc|s2|nt|idblu: the expert duck|pg||
nt|yo_yo: suicidal more like it|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: club to the eight to make 4|pg||
nt|mariner1: aggresserrvative?|pg||
nt|bg: how many open S with 1 club? How is pard supposed to know what is going on?|pg||
nt|othered1: you might be able to strip the hand of back suits then @HAx and hope something really good happens|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north knows enough now|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|snorris: when it doesnt promise the suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now it´s important to play @h|pg||
nt|sharkey: In this case I think E has length in @D as for sure short in @C - thus I thin @D lead stands out|pg||
nt|snorris: agree but might be 11-13 flat and no d|pg||
nt|snorris: suit|pg||
nt|idblu: your line looks right Joe|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|snorris: still 10 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no finesse now|pg||
nt|athene: yes, Del'Monte does his best to confuse the issue|pg||
nt|shevek: but that didn't help|pg||
nt|athene: but to no avail|pg||
nt|athene: when you play upside down count you like your singletons to be large|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: gesundheit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What was that! playing @h?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that. if S has AQ they are not likely to beat 1NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what will happen on OR?|pg||
nt|athene: as then partner can tell you don't have a doubleton|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cindy: think think think|pg||
nt|santyclz: A (slight) chance for Japan Open.|pg||
nt|caitlin: and they didn't in open room|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't open those, but it is a popular style today to get in on stuff like this.|pg||
nt|idblu: and she heard you|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer has all the entries to dummy he wants for a @H finesse...|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|snorris: moment of truth..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: need the spades now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Not that way!|pg||
nt|idblu: the duck  of the KC! cost a trick|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: could be +2 now for a small swing |pg||
nt|idblu: tournament players like to play almost all 2 level and lower doubles are takeout |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for spectators -- in 2-way Stayman,  1N-2@D = Game Force  and opener will not only show/deny 4 card major, but will also bid 3@C/@D with 5/6 card suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but ruff sluff doesn't help here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wd!|pg||
nt|xenya: we can expect a push on this board|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes withno entries would be forced to play @HAK which works on this layout|pg||
pc|cA|nt|panja: W must go up with trump Ace next|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: oops|pg||
nt|fabsayc: right play, has pitch|pg||
nt|fabsayc: about 70% slam, but after reverse surely at least 6 at other table, so odds are enough|pg||
pc|cT|nt|snorris: no sorry|pg||
nt|snorris: c|pg||
nt|snorris: @c ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: still OK, if she reads the hand corrextly|pg||
nt|snorris: this seems all wrong..|pg||
nt|cindy: whats rubber bridge|pg||
nt|santyclz: That's the problem, Al.|pg||
mc|10|nt|ralfwil: and single and return!!|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|idblu: money bridge|pg||
nt|yo_yo: malinowsky in 3@H next door|pg||

nt|hussein2: LOL|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@D cannot be set - question if they can bid it though|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hope the ladies dont push too hard here|pg||
nt|april7: its questinable wether NS will reach the 5 @D contract|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S here...|pg||
nt|april7: a grand slam is coming up, but only bidding 6@S or 6NT|pg||
nt|viren169: everything right... making all 13 tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: good small slam|pg||
nt|april7: W should reach 5@D going 1 down unfortunately|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5D very unlucky here|pg||
nt|chick: E passed 4@H at the other table|pg||
nt|prof 1: 3n or 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|r|nt|jcomyn: thats what I cant understand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3@C some kind of @S raise|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@D by S may get them there|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Bergen?|pg||
nt|hussein2: They play bergen raises even after the x intervention|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|jcomyn: easy 3D here|pg||
nt|hussein2: Guess Kordy is having a great picture of the hand now holding 3 small @s|pg||
nt|april7: even in 6 needing one of two finesses|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: no successfull game for e/w here   both 3NT and 5@D  down      5@D vedry unlucky|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N likely I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|hussein2: They will reach|pg||
nt|april7: and S a sigleton|pg||
nt|sharkey: S is out of gas ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: we can see that, but can they?|pg||
nt|viren169: off course they can...|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@S now|pg||
nt|april7: but small slam for sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whack!!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe not :)|pg||
nt|chick: silly X vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 4@C by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: J of @H very important|pg||
nt|hussein2: Yes, he knows that there is no wasted values in @s ... In fact, I would bid 5@d his hand|pg||
nt|chick: is 1@C artificial?|pg||
nt|prof 1: if they fear @c|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharkey: Perhaps VUL with the greater game bonus would have bid 5@D|pg||
nt|april7: precision|pg||
nt|mmmakela: here  enough side tricks can make 3 NT without dias suit if clubs were 5-3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well 500 a possibility after all|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: or polish club (as a spec points out)|pg||
nt|april7: now W might stop and will be grateful, but only at the end, not by seeing the dummy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|april7: true|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|chick: missing keycard will keep them from grand|pg||
nt|ady: dont know whether east is limited as yet   but would have thought worth 4@D at this point?|pg||
nt|prof 1: not bad|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|viren169: oh well... 4N will get them to 6 a lot quicker|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hussein2: undo?|pg||
nt|viren169: I wanted to see if North cue the K@H over 4@D|pg||
nt|april7: W should consider that 3 aces are missing |pg||
pc|dK|nt|viren169: partnerships have all sorts of agreements cueing in your own suits...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: it's a bit light, but not silly, wouldnt most of us dbl?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|viren169: any views?|pg||
nt|chick: and some have no agreements about it :)|pg||
nt|viren169: true...|pg||
nt|viren169: I think it is better to have an agreement than no agreement (even if it is a bad one!)|pg||
nt|prof 1: shud unblock @h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well they have to show they cant be pushed around all the time|pg||
pc|s2|nt|april7: with ace of @S E has aan excuse for bidding 5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: 5@D is an excellent contract|pg||
nt|april7: W is still happy, but....|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: just doesn't make on this hand|pg||
nt|prof 1: yes we would|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: the 3@D by east sounded like some sort of preference on a weakish hand     he has 4 trumps   an outside singleton and an ace     did not sound like it|pg||
nt|april7: at least bhe is not doubled as in OR|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|viren169: North too avoided the issue by bidding 4N at the other table...|pg||
nt|chick: not me|pg||

nt|mariner1: 4@H can make here|pg||
nt|snorris: doesnt seem so|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t pass on N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and still -1!!!!!|pg||
nt|snorris: strange @h play there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: through the whole play|pg||
nt|werge: 7 NT - to avoid any ruffs...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sorry, yes well done|pg||
nt|othered1: west likely won't get to open 1@C here|pg||
nt|cindy: he could have endplayed S for down 1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Harada has seen 2@d and 2@h tricks and that partner only has 3 @c, so how can he break the contract without 3 @s tricks?|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT with 11 + 11|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i say life is too short for anything|pg||
nt|bg: i need typing lessons|pg||
nt|thommos: you masterpoints may have more regulation than your banks :)|pg||
nt|cindy: thats so true !!!|pg||
nt|idblu: MP's are so inflated anyways|pg||
nt|ralfwil: aha 6@sX!|pg||
nt|thommos: they got to high and needed spades breaking with K onside|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 20 was an 11-point opener as well ;)|pg||
nt|sharkey: i surmise odds against based on your comment?|pg||
nt|mpny: It is just style, not right or wrong. I would not open, but very few would not|pg||
nt|yo_yo: true Mike but it had a few more things going for it|pg||
nt|sharkey: true - think 11 pts ok with shape and suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: stemming the tide --- a push|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and i am betting at least one pair using it in this event|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could have drawn trumps and gone only one down but reasonably enough he tried to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if declarer held 3@H -- it is right, if only 2@H then 4@D and ruff-sluff doesn't help declarer -- well done|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes.  If you know what to do, letting partner who may not choose is a mistake.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Makes on 12.5% of the 4-1 @d breaks too (I think) so maybe better than 70%.|pg||
nt|idblu: re :) crashed :(|pg||
nt|santyclz: Re Furd.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: As in the previous session I can recommend Kesleys books about defence...|pg||
nt|snorris: a lucky position in @cs|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sharkey: Multi 2@D in OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: Appears EW in OR didnt have a defence prepared for Multi 2@D opening|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on W is OK|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|thommos: bank stocks, no longer inflated|pg||
nt|cindy: a beer costs 1/2 masterpoint|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@H doubled in open room|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C on any balanced hand outside 1nt range|pg||
nt|othered1: That's what I meant about north having count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to really learn the lesson about preventing partner from going wrong.  Hugh Kelsey's  "Killing Defense at Bridge"|pg||
nt|idblu: is E worth a call at this vul?|pg||
nt|santyclz: No, if @ds 4-1 needs 3-3@hs so only  6%.|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: this should not be a difficult hand to bid...S shows his long suit, North asks Aces sometime...and that is all that is needed to bid 7|pg||
nt|snorris: dont think they will bid it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 11 point balanced then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually Joey Silver may still be playing it [with John Carruthers]|pg||
mb|2C|nt|wilkinsona: multi seems popular in the East|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @h for me|pg||
nt|snorris: but how to find it+|pg||
nt|snorris: ?|pg||
nt|panja: now...the self preempting effect of the big 2Nt bid comes into picture|pg||
nt|snorris: south will try to show @ds and slammish hand|pg||
nt|athene: double = 4+@S|pg||
nt|shevek: dbl shows 5@s I think|pg||
nt|xenya: at last an excellenet slam|pg||
nt|jaapfr: last 10 boards of nec 2009?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: looks very normal so far|pg||
nt|othered1: But not optimal|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks as though 6 diamonds unlucky for EW here|pg||
nt|snorris: if n had the q of @s instead of q of @d this was the right defence|pg||
nt|sharkey: Precision here?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does that dbl show @S?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 3 spades might gum up the works|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@H and 6@C both make|pg||
mb|2D|nt|snorris: on 2 @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me - 2@s on S|pg||
nt|snorris: I mean instead of double|pg||
nt|sharkey: W's Dbl may get EW to 4@H perhaps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The reason is that if P has @h 3@h or even 4@h is OK|pg||
nt|sharkey: s's 2@H Pass or Correct?|pg||
nt|werge: After South passed his opening hand...|pg||
nt|panja: they may not have enough space to explore and rule out 3Nt, then ask for Aces|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It´s rather easy if S can find the @d 4-card support|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S just barely has a response....maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 10,5 losers.....|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: that doesnt have the appearance of an optimal OR result though|pg||
nt|cindy: im wondering when we can just send money to the acbl and they will credit our accounts with masterpoints|pg||
nt|sybarra: not with @d7|pg||
nt|idblu: a good call by Hackett|pg||
nt|xenya: however 4@H looks makeable too -- not as easy as 4@S of course|pg||
nt|athene: oh right - ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@S = 3@S |pg||
nt|wygbe1: if south had shot out 4h, they would surely be in slam - but after this start it could be difficult to reach|pg||
nt|xenya: no, Japp -- there will be another 16-board session i think|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ic tx|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think i would go straight to 3NT too|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: thats an ugly 1N   |pg||
nt|bg: every one likes pre-empts suit quality or points or shape  -doesnt seem to matter|pg||
nt|idblu: MP's are now attendance points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is who i meant|pg||
nt|fabsayc: after this is ducked, club queen next|pg||
nt|othered1: Don't knock 2-way Stayman (my preferred method).|pg||
nt|caitlin: night all:) enjoy|pg||
nt|othered1: bigtrain points out that more imps were available for making 3@C (my choice, too.)|pg||
nt|caitlin: early morning appt.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mariner1: in Open W rebid 2N here and E bid 3@D|pg||
nt|cindy: matter of style|pg||
nt|marlowepi: possibly system difference. i like 2S with 100 honors and no aces & suit-oriented hand|pg||
nt|snorris: seems so|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @d maybe orck?|pg||
nt|panja: looks like 4@D is interpreted as transfer by N|pg||
nt|snorris: then 4 @h is accept|pg||
nt|snorris: and 4 @s now a rkcb|pg||
nt|panja: South will try a precipitate jump to 6@D perhaps..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4nt will now solve all problems|pg||
nt|panja: seems like this is a misunderstanding issue..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well declarer may duck this|pg||
nt|snorris: trying...|pg||
nt|cindy: but hate to pass too|pg||
nt|mpny: looks to be|pg||
nt|sybarra: gn Caitlin:)|pg||
nt|shevek: minisplinter|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kibs advise 1@S = 0-3 @S|pg||
nt|athene: a splinter in diamonds won't excite west|pg||
nt|shevek: I don't like it much with stiff ace...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H is balanced raise|pg||
nt|othered1: nice for them to let east get her suit in without risk (3@S, limit, would be a different story)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In the other room North was given a chance to make 2NT - but 3NT looks hard on a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even if i played 2S showed 6 i would still bid 2S|pg||
nt|bg: should have endplayed south  he had already showed five dia  4 hearts and two spades he club finesse was a waste of time|pg||
nt|snorris: the didnt rise to those hights|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11 pts balanced you know Kath - = 3 NT down:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup i would too but maybe be unlucky this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: whats wrong with 3@d|pg||
nt|cindy: N passed 2N in open room|pg||
nt|cindy: not sure why|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if that encourages @C shift?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south can give suit preference actually|pg||
nt|othered1: Ithought south might have played @H3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and perhaps NS had to find a club switch|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure W can handle it here either|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont hate to pass|pg||
nt|thommos: yes, looking at 7 clubs and 2 aces, hoping @D are ok|pg||
nt|cindy: my partner always has AJxxxxx|pg||
nt|idblu: however vulnerable you can expect this type of hand|pg||
nt|bg: see on slam they did lose an imp:))|pg||
nt|sharkey: This plays well view S has @CAx|pg||
nt|caitlin: hard to believe over 3N West bid 4@H on own AFTER telling partner once prior he had hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ME?  i've played 2-way Stayman -- and Montreal Relay for further distributional info - since mid 70s|pg||
nt|caitlin: I used to play 2 way stayman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but only when 1N=weak|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: with weak NT|pg||
nt|othered1: So you've had 30 years of good results with it?|pg||
nt|caitlin: moi?|pg||
nt|othered1: Meanwhile, declarer has his work cut out here.|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry not that old:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: I mean I am 30+ but not 30 years of bridge:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the good news for declarer - is that West holds SIX @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: -- and East has no entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who said @HJ and @CJ weren't worth a full 2 points :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and declarer has no tricks, so tell me how to make|pg||
nt|caitlin: 7 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CQ gets ducked -- then what does West do?|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't see any way for declarer to score this.|pg||
nt|santyclz: 8 tricks I think.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if ducked he can play ace and another if he wants|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at some point West making uncomfortable discard AND giving away another round [@C/@H] trick|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe a low @C would give declarer some chances, or maybe not.|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes 8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will delmonte be thinking of a @C slam?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the auction @HJ lead makes a lot of sense too|pg||
nt|othered1: 9 looks right, especially if they play odd-ranked leads|pg||
nt|idblu: all roads lead to 4 making|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which is why i prefer @HJ lead|pg||
nt|idblu: might lead to a pseudo uppercut on occasions|pg||
nt|wygbe1: tough bid by n, who can visualize slam opposite ak of h and 3 small clubs|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Defence will have to be careful|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer might get out for -1 but -2 is likely|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we all lead from Jxxx?|pg||
nt|josj: J9 is just acceptable|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope unless it works|pg||
nt|josj: J9xx|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: cant be missing vulnerable games|pg||
nt|werge: 1 NT is not my cup of tee - pass or 2 @c|pg||
nt|thommos: yes passing 1@S was an option|pg||
nt|ralfwil: on N, agree Hans|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming @HQ lead asks for unblock or count, there is small chance that East hold doubleton -- so my guess @HK continue|pg||
pc|h5|nt|snorris: maybe they stumble inti it|pg||
nt|snorris: into it|pg||
nt|bg: your first question Ed is valid how does south get to bid a nf 3clubs?|pg||
nt|othered1: I might lead J if I had supported.  Otherwise, count seems best since dummy's hand isn't at all specific, is it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not -- could be just as hard to read declarer's heart length|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona: wests x here seems an improvement on the 3 clubs in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tada|pg||
nt|fabsayc: something wrong with this auction|pg||
nt|idblu: not really,  minimum w/long @S wants to play game|pg||
nt|josj: well, there we are|pg||
nt|roswolf: this can make i think|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharkey: Yes - EW will be duly rewarded for their bidding|pg||
nt|snorris: getting some imps back|pg||
nt|snorris: 13 in fact|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S unblocks and N shifts to @D - still make?|pg||
nt|panja: operator, could you pl clarify the meanings of bids?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Can S have better cards? rise to 7|pg||
nt|snorris: easier if south opens 3 @d|pg||
nt|snorris: then it should be easy|pg||
nt|snorris: well done|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would pass with slight misgivings|pg||
nt|idblu: are they playing 2/1 or somehing else|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but looks like lack of intermediate spots will be the doom of declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: south has pointed suit pressure on east, but can't get the count right for a squeeze|pg||
nt|wygbe1: he went for the guess with the biggest payoff|pg||
nt|jaapfr: impressive gambling:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: educated quess |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|cindy: it kinda describes your hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all's well that ends well|pg||
nt|mariner1: different routes however both rooms in 4@H here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: kinda|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree snorri. The only thing to find 7 is for N to check aces|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|werge: Because of the @S-bid, Souths hand was growing|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: every chance of beating -4 however|pg||
nt|idblu: other room did not do well either|pg||
nt|shevek: mainly because partner will construct hands with the ace somewhere else|pg||
nt|chessmaste: That looks like a fatal play - now declarer has a second spade trick |pg||
pc|dA|nt|cindy: two suits  @s and @d  hmm|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am with Marshall here, prefer the slowing of 2@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as you say, matter of style. xom would rather emphasize major with 100 honors than a very broken minor. both approahes will have their successes|pg||
nt|snorris: but still lucky|pg||
nt|snorris: not loosing 3 @c tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: norths raise bold all the same|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..may have a tough decision yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club K seems like a better shot than small|pg||
nt|shevek: yet another flat board, just what Oz needs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so -- length showing probably IS best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep Ed - i'm convinced|pg||
pc|d5|nt|snorris: 9 tricks on top|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks without @s|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - miscounted :(|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and NOT @sJ?|pg||
nt|snorris: king for count?|pg||
nt|snorris: ace for unblock|pg||
nt|snorris: ?|pg||
nt|snorris: -2 at least|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: If S had bid 2@s W must bid 2nt  not D as partner then will go to 2@h|pg||
nt|irwinbo: spades plays better he will go down at least two|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: on the heart switch care needed I suppose|pg||
nt|idblu: @H now and a duck is a 2 undertrick  diff |pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like China going minus at both tables -- nice way for Japan to get off the schneid|pg||
nt|athene: ok - so N-S do indeed play upside down carding|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: hearts is declarer's second suit. W will let declarer look after them|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lets see, s has to lead a @c up for his 8th trick, I think that deprives him of a late @d entry.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder why Wang played A?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yo_yo: did he lead 7?|pg||
nt|mpny: Paul need to play a D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: needs a @d switch|pg||
nt|idblu: has to hook|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cindy: he can now|pg||
nt|mpny: well done|pg||
nt|shevek: real score again is 64 - 29|pg||
nt|ahollan1: overtake with @CK might have been interesting -- but south must always fall back upon @D finesse |pg||
nt|roswolf: with @D 3-3 japan have scored a real goal|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: East holds @C and West squeezed down to winners|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: So I mean that 2@s is a better bid than 2@h|pg||
nt|santyclz: Low @c opening lead would have been fun.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|idblu: but can get 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|idblu: better declarer play :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They found 4@S on 6 in OR|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sounds like a close your eyes and hope for the best - but with @C sa s trump a bit difficult to investigat scientifically|pg||
nt|wygbe1: he knew south would not be able to cooperate if slam were making|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|snorris: but that is good if he takes 5 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: west might cash @SA now|pg||
nt|athene: south can't really have the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: but would north play a third heart with the singleton @SK, revealing the position?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chessmaste: 12 goals you will find|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wilkinsona: in OR EW could have passed out 2 spades xx|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: rectifying the count for a squeeze that isn't there|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: just drifting one off it seems|pg||
nt|snorris: east will continue sp and hope for no q of @h in south|pg||
nt|snorris: ah... 7 of @c |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes could well do|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|idblu: ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope -- declarer going for the quick loss|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: ???|pg||
nt|snorris: natural |pg||
nt|idblu: not only that...it would beat the contract|pg||
pc|hK|nt|wilkinsona: so boldness pays|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she must have had a reason   |pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|idblu: ?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: good evening cindy, spectators|pg||
pc|c6|nt|snorris: that would be carnage..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: which may have been 1600 approx|pg||
nt|thommos: the A@S was a good play by West, ensures they take their tricks|pg||
nt|chessmaste: As a general rule aces should be used for bashing kings|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: 13 IMPs to the Chinese Ladies - Match tied|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W cannot see the layout. down 1 will suit him just fine|pg||
nt|cindy: ??|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s4|nt|sharkey: a push|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s5|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|c2|pg||

nt|april7: a normal 4@S contract|pg||
nt|hussein2: Easy to set however|pg||
nt|hussein2: 2 ruffs 2 aces|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes - for us|pg||
nt|hussein2: no, guess i am wrong|pg||
nt|april7: after @C lead no quick entry to get rid of the @C loser on K of @D|pg||
nt|hussein2: looks like it makes|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C lead and @H ruff|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C lead takes out N's entry|pg||
nt|hussein2: mmmmm|pg||
nt|viren169: nicely bid at both tables for a flat board.|pg||
nt|viren169: 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: slam time -= can NS do anything to get in the way|pg||
nt|ady: 6  diamonds makes for e/w     what sort of pre-empt im spades will there be?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so well done to the egyptian ladies|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2 imps and 2 boards|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 2N here in Open|pg||
mb|p|nt|hussein2: Will she leeds @c?|pg||
nt|ady: hi Gad     is this the closing stages of the session?|pg||
nt|viren169: now N/S need to be careful to avoid going beyond 4@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a quick 9 tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: yes...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or 10 in s|pg||
nt|chick: 10 at NT too|pg||
nt|viren169: only 8 in NT|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S and oponents should cash their tricks fast,otherwise......|pg||
nt|viren169: You can untangle the diamonds with heart to the A and small diamond back?|pg||
nt|viren169: have I missed something?|pg||
nt|chick: with the Q10 over the J, I think there's a stopper if played right|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... you are right...|pg||
nt|chick: or have *I* missed something? :)|pg||
nt|chick: might even make 7@D with the nice lie of @Hs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: @C lead OR|pg||
nt|viren169: the 8 of diamonds got me all excited|pg||
nt|april7: perhaps W reaches 3NT, and 4 @S is to expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3@H  likely to show support for both majors|pg||
nt|april7: E should X and W after 3@S should bid 3NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4H for me with the N hand|pg||
nt|april7: only not vul!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont care|pg||
nt|april7: 800|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  - 800    only ok if  6@D is reached in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: hehe :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|nt|ady: Norths hand is not so good for a high jump if  South has spades    |pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: Think either of the ladies will|pg||
pc|hA|nt|april7: on @D lead no 6@D|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|ady: North right to give up    any 5  level contgract must be at least -500  and possibly more|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did we miss a round of bidding?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jcomyn: that 3NT contract in the open room makes me feel ill|pg||
nt|jcomyn: if there was any justice in this game -which there isnt - it would have cost them 13 imps|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 9 are hard to find here|pg||
nt|prof 1: can we correct the bidding|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: oops this may get out of hand|pg||
nt|viren169: ummmmmmmmmm|pg||
nt|chick: aarrggghhhh, too high now|pg||
nt|april7: now it becomes interstin|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|viren169: 4@H cue should have slowed North down|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|viren169: and now N/S are in the lap of the gods!|pg||
nt|viren169: imps about to transfer hands!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: D will not be led of course|pg||
nt|chick: can EW find their 3 tricks off the top?|pg||
nt|april7: it depends now on the lead whether it will be a present|pg||
nt|viren169: tough lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: H lead D switch|pg||
nt|chick: the @D switch is easy, but the lead is tough|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|april7: looks most possible|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|april7: now @H and W might not continue|pg||
nt|hussein2: 2 down now?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hussein2: only 1 now|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1|pg||
nt|viren169: should find @D switch!|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|hussein2: It was 2 by getting 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|hussein2: ouch|pg||
nt|sharkey: Still down I think|pg||
nt|april7: if S should have played @H then W might not have continued for Easts ruff|pg||
nt|hussein2: Yes, will still have to give 2 @h tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcomyn: so ladies will be back in front for last board|pg||
nt|vugraphzka: the bidding goes as you see|pg||
nt|prof 1: 8 imps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant believe Kalita opened 3NT on that 15 count|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 14 actually|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|sharkey: Even if no @H return dont think it's makeable|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|viren169: J!|pg||
nt|chick: and then a club, just in case ......|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mmmakela: ducking the spade 10  would've been good here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|april7: @S now|pg||
nt|viren169: trump|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|viren169: 11 tricks in the other room...|pg||
nt|april7: this was no necessary|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thx all, back soon|pg||

nt|frankaus: more excitement here|pg||
nt|cindy: hi :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, we dont know about the 2 diamonds, but if it shows either major, 2 spades is normal|pg||
nt|werge: 3 @d is stupid - a brave man opens 1 D|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @d|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: take care|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bad defence|pg||
nt|snorris: a slm again|pg||
nt|snorris: slam|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @h|pg||
nt|caitlin: well Japan on the map|pg||
nt|caitlin: doubt my brother watching....in Tokyo 28+ years|pg||
nt|othered1: one trick stolen at both tables|pg||
nt|xenya: or rather they didn't find 4@H perhaps...|pg||
nt|roswolf: another chance for japan|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW can beat 4@S here....|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes though|pg||
nt|frankaus: poll for final contract & result - 4@S S +1 for me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fast pass and on to 25, which is more interesting|pg||
nt|cindy: looks like a pass out here too|pg||
nt|othered1: this they may be able to make.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But N found a nice endplay on W, so perhaps -1 IMP for the dutch|pg||
nt|athene: a good board here for australia|pg||
nt|idblu: tight bridge so far|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D-(2@C)-X?P|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: once again 3NT bites the dust in OR|pg||

nt|bg: should reach a slam|pg||
nt|snorris: -1|pg||
nt|shevek: a routine 3NT here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in my view, N should open 1H regardless of system|pg||
nt|snorris: on their marry way..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks like it|pg||
nt|snorris: merry|pg||
nt|ralfwil: on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or 3NT|pg||
nt|snorris: thats better|pg||
nt|mpny: Kath, do you know what 1H is|pg||
nt|sharkey: @H to crowd the forcing @C action|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Paul wants to disrupt them |pg||
nt|mpny: it was alerted|pg||
nt|sharkey: think 3NT by E has chances|pg||
nt|werge: Might show red OR black suits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what price this ends in something doubled?|pg||
nt|sybarra: at least equal stealing |pg||
nt|athene: if north didn't open, you might miss game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finally -- confirmation of Precision|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have to go, enjoy all|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The auction in the other room was unconvincing|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cindy: a grand |pg||
nt|idblu: wine break..brb|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ¤1h on EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: may stop at part score here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west bound to upgrade after the 4 diamond splinter|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @h ?|pg||
nt|snorris: showing intermediate strength|pg||
nt|snorris: it seems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would not pass the N hand|pg||
nt|cindy: thats ugly 1@h|pg||
nt|idblu: love those 4 card majors...remind me of my younger days|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: of course that was never a danger :)|pg||
nt|idblu: see ya Martin, gn |pg||
nt|santyclz: As Edgar used to say:  this is the kind of weak nt that gives weak nts a bad name.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|snorris: they are going there too|pg||
nt|cindy: is this the real bidding ?|pg||
nt|cindy: im getting dizzy :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: better |pg||
nt|bg: good idea not to try for six maybe at match points and you are not playing with your spouse|pg||
nt|thommos: not for the lead!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you were right mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: trump lead...|pg||
mb|d|nt|barbyh: do they play support dbls?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here 1D could be a winner though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it looks like it from that 2NT bid, barb|pg||
nt|barbyh: yes but hard to imagine 3nt with the south hand|pg||
nt|snorris: no good bid in north|pg||
nt|bg: thats better 2 clubs by East some system not yet written|pg||
nt|sybarra: now how they are not in 6 is beyond me |pg||
nt|cindy: how about keycard now |pg||
nt|sybarra: was some form of experimental ghestem maybe |pg||
nt|sybarra: meaning 6340 |pg||
nt|npcjpn: but south does not know about @d shortness...|pg||
nt|sybarra: or as a spec said,  an exclusion 2 suiter|pg||
nt|cindy: no but he knows N has 5 hearts and 4 clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: come on, bruce,  be creative|pg||
nt|bg: ok keycard then go for it:))|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was still talking about the (misentered) 2 @C bid|pg||
nt|snorris: flushed with sucsess north moves on|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you wont be able to overcall with this shape, so bid right away|pg||
nt|othered1: south stops to investigate, but now what?|pg||
nt|athene: playing Precision, south's 2@H response would be natural and constructive but non-forcing|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@H - 3 NT?|pg||
nt|athene: so she has to bid the artificial 2@D relay first then 3@H is forcing|pg||
nt|santyclz: Gn Martin.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|chessmaste: We should have a new leader soon|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i have sympathy with the 2@S bid in the other room, it's not a great suit|pg||
mb|2N|nt|wilkinsona: good lead it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not at all sure about 4|pg||
nt|snorris: what??|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, dont really follow the x|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how many down|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S opened 1@H in OR|pg||
nt|wygbe1: he was in a tough position, too strong for 4c, 5c would end the auction, and over 4s, how would south know how to continue?|pg||
nt|josj: N bid only 2 @S, thus S did not know about the extra trick coming from the 7th spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: not good |pg||
nt|irwinbo: no opening 2 diamond bid and no bid over two clubs|pg||
nt|santyclz: Bob Hamman has no problem with his rebid.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet most partnerships haven't discussed North's 3@C bid -- Natural and big hand without better bid both understandable interpretations|pg||
nt|santyclz: If 3nt is an option, bid it.|pg||
nt|othered1: I would not play it as natural|pg||
nt|othered1: but it's certainly reasonable to do so.|pg||
nt|caitlin: but I would still pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe not natural but surely something in suit, has many other options|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well -- especially with increase use of 1@C as 2+, i think Natural is very reasonable use|pg||
nt|othered1: North is worried about missing slam or a better minor suit game.  @S void is a concern.|pg||
nt|caitlin: oh I hate short club|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have short diamond|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what were the results of the Dutch team?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: club shift needed?|pg||
nt|sharkey: well - dont think this was one of the alternatives we had in mind :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i never know what to do with East hand -- DBL is only way to play 33 @S fit|pg||
nt|josj: well, the suit is quite bad but that's not so interesting when you preempt|pg||
nt|chessmaste: True, but 3@S still looks an underbid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this time the K of trumps falls|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: which is not to be interpreted as approval of 2NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am told they do play support DBL's|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: is 4 spades not there..?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2D?|pg||
nt|idblu: declarer will have a lot to worry about here|pg||
nt|sybarra: but is the lead N got |pg||
nt|thommos: looks like a @D, @C and one in the wash to loose - making 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: make that hate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the more I see 1@C=2+ and transfer responses, the more i like it|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok - doesn't bother with showing hearts|pg||
nt|othered1: if I bid east's hand that way, partner would correct to 2@S with 3-1-6-3|pg||
nt|idblu: win @C and @S switch kills this hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: I think Frank will owe us a beer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S is a very conservative action|pg||
nt|frankaus: first leg in but looks unlikely to make +1|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 imps if south cashes out|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer can gain an imp by taking 7 tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes 4 hearts not a bad contract really|pg||
nt|othered1: and 5@D isn't a bad spot at all|pg||
nt|athene: easy to make ten tricks here without the clubs|pg||
nt|shevek:  China Women's Team lost the World Championship Final 222-223 to England last year|pg||
nt|athene: @D9 and @h10 both work hard for you|pg||
nt|sharkey: and EW can only cash 2 @C tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra2: where are "we" headed,  5 @C?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @HJ:)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: it has been pointed out by kibitzer that if you are going to bid 6c, you might as well bid 4nt on the way to confirm you are not off two aces - if 4nt is blackwood|pg||
nt|xenya: concealing the @H suit has worked out quite well for declarer -- she gets a very helpful lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 2 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some may have bid 3@S with East's hand|pg||
nt|cindy: i cant see em staying out of at least a small slam here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not even a try!|pg||
nt|santyclz: If pd's 1@d showed @ds, I'd pass with e.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good kib:)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: 4S cold if S reads this as singleton|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence requires care..|pg||
nt|othered1: That may have been a helpful lead.  Now NS need to be careful|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I think north has done fine so far|pg||
nt|othered1: Do NS lead A from AK?|pg||
nt|idblu: is worrying about @H ruffs|pg||
nt|cindy: looks that way to me too|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's that defence called?  to the strong club?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The Unsuccessful Defence|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this is not a good advert for it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Suicide defence?|pg||
nt|caitlin: same score|pg||
nt|othered1: Stayman auction touted west away from her @D.|pg||
nt|geller: looks like 3nt is an easy make here.  should be flat.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely she will win in North & finesse @H|pg||
nt|sybarra2: suggested it will be 6 @D|pg||
nt|idblu: can anyone explain the auction :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: it actually looks like a puppet minor suit auction |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: redble|pg||
nt|bg: 3nt N ? how about 3 hearts or 4 dia isnt it cue bid time?|pg||
nt|snorris: 10 tricks withright wivev in @cs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: as kib says just make 2 clubs|pg||
nt|snorris: not trying to play on @ss|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t know their system, but couldn´t W have bis 3@h after the transfer?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then 1@D=4+ and some say guarantees unbal -- huge advantage in later and competitive auctions|pg||
nt|caitlin: maybe not|pg||
nt|caitlin: if 1@D promises unbalanced then I understand short club|pg||
nt|caitlin: but many play it to play it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why would length of opener's @D affect your choice?|pg||
nt|othered1: Isn't pass possible on east's hand?  And mightn't north double 2@H?  East is lucky this hasn't become a disaster|pg||
nt|santyclz: I believe in letting the opps play misfits.  I have nothing against letting them play in @cs, and can bid 2@h if pd x's.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: bingo|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: this is not more than 3 down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4 down after a @d ruff and trumpd return|pg||
nt|snorris: well yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart ruff is hard to find|pg||
nt|werge: 30 years ago in Denmark it was called Robinson|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a good name yes :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play a new convention because it's sexy -- bah    MUST understand the ramifications on other auctions to adopt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: Not the lead, West expexted - but hoped for|pg||
nt|athene: there might even be 11 tricks if east gets squeezed|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: should be in 7 shortly at this table |pg||
nt|cindy: do you start slam cue bidding at the 3 level ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: agree and that was sexy Al:)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, easy 10 tricks it seems|pg||
pc|d4|nt|snorris: 8 tricks|pg||
nt|irwinbo: yes or 1 diamond if that is to your taste|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be some form of CRASH - this time the did...|pg||
nt|werge: 500...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Ed -- Pass probably best -- but so tempting to DBL and hope 2@S finds a 7 card fit|pg||
nt|sybarra2: so it is 6 @c |pg||
pc|d9|nt|sharkey: 3 IOMPs now|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: IMPs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: anyone for a x on the west hand?|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 5@c?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lots of cards right for declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: This is a pretty friendly hand for NS, despite the @DQ in the weaker hand|pg||
nt|idblu: only has to find the @DJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Didn't find the @h lead.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: win in hand, hook heart, discard club, then scissors in hearts|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: In OR East only raised to 3 hearts, so didnt look near six, but after the 4d west looks ideal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer thinking -- those pesky minor suit quacks |pg||
nt|werge: Claim, pls|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bg: I play 2c is GF therefor e3 dia starts a cue bid series aces-kings- N is not cooperating singletons|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if you play a strong club you just love boards like this |pg||
nt|xenya: a@S lead, for exampple/ would have defeated the contract easily |pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: but twop trump lsoers anyway|pg||
nt|thommos: maybe should of played A the Q@D|pg||
nt|idblu: has @D's to ruff, @S's to finesse....|pg||
nt|cindy: can he do it all ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: lot of work |pg||
nt|thommos: only 3 trumps, not always right|pg||
nt|othered1: this will present no problems at all, when @D break revealed.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mariner1: now a couple of ruffs|pg||
nt|snorris: ok if he can manage 6 tricks as e-w have 3 @d|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: but now, with a well placed @sK and 3@d from P|pg||
nt|sybarra2: same contract other table with W as declarer and @H lead|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|cindy: i play 3@d is just forcing and could be trying to get to 3N or could be slam interest|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 nt  grandslam force or josephine as it used to be called|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep, sorry|pg||
pc|d2|nt|snorris: agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: shou;d mark the @C  finesse also |pg||
