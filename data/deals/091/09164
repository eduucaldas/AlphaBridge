mb|p|nt|baldjean: South is suffering from the same problem this commentator had last night then. I snoozed off shortly at one point too. fortunately it was towards ther end of the set|pg||
nt|baldjean: the*|pg||
mb|1C|nt|santyclz: It's a good idea to use an armchair when commentating 3 or more matches.|pg||
nt|baldjean: undo, operator|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|mcarroll: Too easy to nod off Joe|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.  Welcome to the 2nd half of the final elimination for the Yeh Brothers tourney.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: hi all. bear with me, I'm new at this.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: This is a 3-way match with the winner to face Netherlands in the final.|pg||
nt|bobholl: just follow the players which is difficult enough :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sry|pg||
nt|santyclz: But at least you don't fall off and injure yourself.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|santyclz: We won't have score comparisons untill the 2nd half of the match when we'll see different players play the same boards.|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S lead will beat 3nT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|baldjean: looks as if 3nt works here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|baldjean: how will @s lead beat 3nt?|pg||
nt|bobholl: it only works if you begin with @H|pg||
nt|bobholl: shouldn't play K on small @S but not so easy :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: J.  Suit pref.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: had it in his hand, now thinking|pg||
nt|baldjean: actually he should; if declarer continues @h he won't get a chance for his K@s again|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I thought this might make from W but it doesnt|pg||
nt|bobholl: if S ducks he has to play @H first |pg||
nt|mcarroll: and it is 2-1 against declare finding @H  continuation|pg||
nt|bobholl: i think even 5 to 1 or so because of entries to east|pg||
nt|santyclz: 0500 here.  I may not make it through this match.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: any drug should do the trick Joe|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: still thinking.|pg||
nt|baldjean: is South snoozing again?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Odds are that S for WJO has at most one of the 3 missing Aces - but no real indication which one?|pg||
nt|bobholl: he is taking his K and switch to @D|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: now has the Jack to one side|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|jtr: Then the Chinese gained 50 IMPs|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: welcome back everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Start with a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north has a huge hand for a Precision 1@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Tough to bid though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: They have put together some massive sets over the years - I remember a 76-0 demolition in one of the Venice Cup matches|pg||
nt|athene: south will be thinking of 6@H now|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: so is North, by the look of it|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: hi Peter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@H may well be doubled for a spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the normal way to show a void in response to RKCB was to bid 5NT with an even number of keycards|pg||
nt|jtr: Not so tough for these ladies it seems|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Strong Club|pg||
nt|petergill: hence 3@H, since 1@H was 11-15|pg||
nt|athene: i thought 6@D would show a diamond void and an ODD number of keycards|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: which will not, unfortunately, do any good |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: well, i am sure they know what they are doing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I'd have doubled for a spade lead, and would be -1210|pg||
nt|athene: even without a spade fit, north has the most she can possibly have for 1@H, so as soon as her partner shows any slam interest, she is going there|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid, 4NT RKCB, 6@D two key cards plus @D void. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: the @CQ is a bonus|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: 6@d = @d void with 2 or 3 keycards.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: thirteen tricks now if she wants them|pg||
nt|jtr: 2 OR 3 seems odd|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that seems a bit silly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doesn't seem a bit silly - seems totally unplayable|pg||
nt|athene: you might easily be missing a grand slam with south showing 2 or 3 keycards|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: i think so too, but that's what explained.|pg||
nt|petergill: Without @CQ in her side suit (source of tricks), South would not have encouraged a slam - she would have bid 4@h instead of 4@D. |pg||
nt|athene: if you are ever going to have ambiguous responses they have to be widely differentiated so partner knows what you have|pg||
nt|athene: hence 0 or 3 keycards, 1 or 4|pg||
nt|jtr: Sensible lead in a way|pg||
nt|jtr: East knows South is likely to have only 2 or 3 trumps and the ruff may be important|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if there was any significance in west's failure to double diamond bids|pg||
nt|athene: forcing dummy might well be right to prevent the establishment of a black suit|pg||
nt|jtr: South responded 2@c next door and they were much better placed|pg||
nt|athene: i try to persuade my partners not to lead trumps against small slams|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: the only excuse for so doing is it's right :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|petergill: Both teams of six not surprisingly have their top four players in action for this vital last 16 boards of the grand final|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jtr: Concerned about 4-1 @cs|pg||
nt|jtr: and 3-1@hs|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|jtr: yes i thought she might do that|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jtr: Leaves options open and may be important for a squeeze|pg||
nt|petergill: "Fluffy" on BBO forums has a good problem in the top-listed Forum thread about whether to lead a trump against a slam of not, ref www.bridgebase.com then forums. Fluffy (in the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Latin team) missed the Finals by 1 imp in the NEC Cup.     |pg||

mb|d|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|bobholl: am told that 2 @D = @H or @S+@C|pg||
nt|bobholl: now they migth reach 5 of a minor losing a @S and a @D|pg||
nt|mcarroll: NS play Neg Dbls thru 7@H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: So minor game seems indicated|pg||
mb|4C|nt|dburn: and then South might bid game|pg||
nt|bobholl: another losing decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Was the 1@c artificial, strong?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Might get overboard now.|pg||
nt|bobholl: the pass was 7 or less ?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: west confirms that 2D is either @h or (@s and @c)|pg||
nt|santyclz: It was alerted as a control.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: East had asked about the pass, and N said "control"|pg||
nt|baldjean: if the x showed @c support I would have bid 5@c immediately. 4@c in my book is not being sure of having minor game and asking for 2 out of 5 to bid 5@c|pg||
nt|bobholl: east promises good @S with 3@H so they shouldn't get too high|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: N upset at south's slow play|pg||
nt|dburn: but he can't do that - or at least, not if he doesn't want to lose a second huge swing|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|mdgraham: Note that West responded in the other room too|pg||
nt|petergill: Both expert Wests responded in hearts, almost obligatory amongst experts at this highly suitable "stealing" vulnerability. |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: you have to choose your overcalls with care - best to make them when partner has 5-card support |pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: ref page 22 of http://www.worldbridge.org/publications/WBNews/WBFNews09.pdf |pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: west had a choice of cue-bids here to show diamond support - 2@H or 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: some people would always cue in the suit they hold strength|pg||
nt|athene: (so @SA means 2@S)|pg||
nt|athene: but another consideration is that you want to make the cue which can't be natural|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. west can't have a great hand with spades (no 1@S overcall)|pg||
nt|athene: but she MIGHT have a great hand with hearts|pg||
nt|athene: probably showing hearts naturally isn't an issue so much over a 5-card major|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: it's against the law|pg||

nt|petergill: Both these Chinese pairs play Precision. Precision was invented in the early 1970s in China by C.C. Wei with assistance from his wife Kathy. |pg||
