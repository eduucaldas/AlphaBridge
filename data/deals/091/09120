nt|ahollan1: hello again Sunil|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: probably a @c partscore for EW here|pg||
nt|mrdct: west thinking of passing this in|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H instead of DBL is interesting choice|pg||
mb|4H|nt|santyclz: Looks like an uneventful 3nt to get everybody settled in.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: veteran Indonesian pair facing a lot younger Dutch pair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks, hi Steve.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: West took a while to open that hand- was he going to pass ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's often not a good idea to open in 4th seat without a @S suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|mrdct: as more often than not you write down -110 defending 2@S|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|robinswr: garbage stayman|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|frankaus: sunny 81f or 25c at the venue|pg||
nt|frankaus: still time to catch a flight to one of autralias national events :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: pairs start Sunday - teams Tues|pg||
nt|mrdct: a problem for EW here is that 1@C doesn't show a @C suit so they could lose their fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doubleton @SQ will help - but can east maintain control?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Al bbl might have got them to the great 6@D contract|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Have to confess I'd spend all my time scuba diving on your reefs.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk4: Hi Steve, Joe and Marshall|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 3rd and final @h?|pg||
nt|mrdct: lindqvist might play his partner for 5@h here and compete to 3@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: but I would suggest he's already fully described his hand and should leave it up to south to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|jbgood: n still thinking - not good|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: hi Roland, steve, Joe and specs|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|santyclz: He did only have 7 hcp for his x, but who's counting?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this contract looks quite safe|pg||
pc|h4|nt|robinswr: club lead is to be able to cross ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: E showed hearts - so what? Hi all|pg||
nt|mrdct: he is a passed hand though so a shapely 7 count looks fair enough to me|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sunsamvar: dbl|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|santyclz: It would be an impressive system that could get to 4@h on this hand.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not arguing with the x, but thinking over 3@c is an overbid.|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes i agree he has a clear pass over 3@c|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mrdct: but some players do like to think everything through twice|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|h8|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|mmmakela: Here in Finnish Lappland we got a meter of snow|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: Fast Arrival|pg||

nt|mrdct: @C lead looks pretty clear-cut here|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess 1 down|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think if you are going to play transfers over 1@C it definately makes sense to broaden the range of hands that open 1@c|pg||

nt|marlowepi: this should be fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: maybe grue should have opened 1heart|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes it is very dangerous to open strong club when very distributional and short in spades|pg||
nt|mrdct: very good slam for EW here in @H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: no.. but will still make 12 cause @D split|pg||
mb|1N!|an|F1|nt|vugrapha3: correct|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: hello btw :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: No problem, for some reason the players frequently seem to have other things on their minds than ensuring the vg oper can see all their plays.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if NS are playing Precision or not - and 1@S doesn't resolve that issue |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in general the same is true when two-suited, but on previous board N held spades, so the danger was greatly reduced|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: R3: Australia Youth v Bridge i Norge and New Zealand v India National|pg||
nt|robinswr: 5clubs should show spade support|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: On the @hk lead, e will probably make 6.|pg||
nt|robinswr: no he'll probably lose a club and a diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Joe means, because E can place the high cards|pg||
nt|mrdct: with 3@H showing a strong @H raise east is sure to make a move towards slam now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Easier for those who play any rebid other than 2@s shows extras, either in hcp or distribution.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice practical 4@S rebid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the Chinese are supposed to be precise :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: u all agree with 2 clubs? |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: incidentally, tempo altered on purpose|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: lots of playing strength so some might bid 3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: and north has only one Jack that isn't working -- wow talk about cover cards|pg||
pc|d3|nt|santyclz: I do, bad honor structure.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mmmakela: I do too, was just asking|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm not quite sure what "serious 3NT bid" means - but it's got them on the right track for slam now|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Serious means he is very keen to go to slam.|pg||
nt|jbgood: apart from being a world champ - brogeland is the editor (and owner) of Bridge i Norge. His prd made his debut on the Nor Open Team last year by winning the European Teams Chship|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sunsamvar: good lead|pg||

nt|jbgood: yes - and with Erichsen and for Stern|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|frankaus: make will bid 2@C - if pd passes its likely to be the best spot|pg||
nt|mrdct: hopefully EW have a mechanism to work out they are off the trump A|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: not obvious why S is doubling. could N pass be forcing?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|frankaus: *many|pg||

nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
pc|d2|nt|robinswr: this is what happens when you operate and overcall 1nt with that hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OR:  ....this is what happens when you make a great bid but you are stuck with systemic agreements that gum up the works|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not as if 1D was more likely to get NS to 3NT than a 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|robinswr: maybe he should have run 6 diamonds before leading a spade|pg||

pc|c7|pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: good play by Huang to not cover the 9. that made N think that W's remaining spade was the 8 or ten|pg||
nt|robinswr: tse is counting points and doesn't think his partner has any|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure why N played the ten of diamonds on the first round. that gave away a lot of information|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h5|pg||

nt|marlowepi: not too often you go down 500 in 4NT when you would probably be +600 in 3NT. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: George - getting back to the former greats from Canada - have you read the book about Murray-Kehela?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mittmouse: y a very good book|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|robinswr: grue will strip the hand and try to put west in to lead a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D looks like asking bid response -- showing primary @H support and ??? maybe > 10 hcp|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: yes, that was the problem i mentioned. the hope is that the foes will be more inconvenienced by the long suit than dummy will|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not sure about the rest :(|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: they whispered something, couldn't hear ,sry|pg||
nt|robinswr: but at least he could have stripped the diamonds so the opponents would have to give up a trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North can't guess wrong in @D -- for me E would hold @DAQ or split honors and I wouldn't be able to guess right|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sunsamvar: he will find out as much as he can abt the E/W distribution before tackling @D..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer will give himself an extra chance in @C, but when Jack doesn't fall - @D from dummy then worry, then glee|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jbgood: difficult to grasp this for a youngster as Espen Lindqvist..|pg||

nt|jbgood: not only what he is doing - but what he and prd are doing together:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: even more important|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|mmmakela: of course no dbl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kit: the reason I think low to 9 is right play in slam is that it will be tough for East to duck from King-doubleton|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so if 9 loses to jack, I would then take finesse on way back|pg||
nt|santyclz: Isn't the normal play leading the 9 from dmy?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so not pecentage play but best play?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: overtake and play @D to show @S reentry|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h3|nt|jbgood: bye all - enjoy the show from Down Under:) |pg||

nt|Walddk4: suitplay says low to 9 and if it loses to J, cash A|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok believe, dbl finesse close 2nd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: East should know not to duck any @C|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|mittmouse: if he cashes his hearts he wins the board or 3 imps|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kit: suitplay thinks that East will always duck from Kx -- in real life, that ain't so|pg||
nt|santyclz: Bye Jon, thanks.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|santyclz: Normal play in 7 is the Q from dmy.|pg||

mb|d|nt|ahollan1: especially if transfer is 2@S so opener can show/deny @C support|pg||
