nt|santyclz: Most common players of all playing here.|pg||
nt|hedyg: the operator will enter their names as soon as they sit|pg||
nt|hedyg: usually we are not shown the boards before the players arrive for security reasons|pg||
nt|hedyg: our operator is Carlos Araujo, ola Carlos :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if this will be a fun board, though.|pg||

nt|santyclz: Dance on the table?|pg||

nt|vugraphzkb: olá,João,boa noite :)|pg||
nt|jfaria: boa noite Carlos|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is João then !|pg||
nt|jfaria: we can start guessing about the auction :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am showing off my accents!|pg||
nt|jfaria: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: N will open a weak 2suiter?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they play it|pg||
nt|jfaria: iff|pg||
nt|jfaria: they play 2 suiters...|pg||
nt|hedyg: if not E will open 1@c and S will Ghestem that|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: players arriving|pg||
nt|jfaria: otherwise pass i guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: E has 4 losers, maybe open something strong|pg||
nt|jfaria: maybe 1@s in that case?|pg||
nt|hedyg: S should overcall anyhow|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: some problems in closed room,will start when connection avaiable|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then nobody can stop N|pg||
nt|jfaria: no doubt|pg||
nt|hedyg: so we will wait for them, Carlos?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We don't use initials, only last names|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and pls insert flags|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Carlos|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets start!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: yes :)|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|hedyg: yeah!!!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: now Ghestem|pg||
nt|jfaria: if they play michaels no 2 suiter available|pg||
mb|2D|an|!h|mb|p|nt|jfaria: lol|pg||
nt|santyclz: for some meanings of "on"|pg||
nt|hedyg: popular convention in Portugal|pg||
mb|3D|an|super accept|nt|jfaria: but I think 1 @s does it|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: here it does|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Playing Ghestem is the certain way of conceding 2300, because at least one always forgets|pg||
nt|vugraphzkb: no Ghestem,sry :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: np to bid 4@s in S|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hedyg: lol i see Carlos|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jfaria: a litle coward W pass...|pg||
nt|hedyg: but most top players do play Ghestem in Portugal as we have seen in former broadcasts|pg||
nt|jfaria: Castro must do all...|pg||
mb|5H|nt|hedyg: 5@s still makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Ghestem is number 11 on my list of "25 Conventions you do not Want to Learn"|pg||
nt|jfaria: now Castro musr guess @h ?|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d9|pg||
nt|jfaria: easier to make 5@s then|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|hedyg: small @d|pg||

nt|pbundy: hi everyone .....|pg||
nt|mildredb: hi everyone|pg||
nt|gowdy: Hi |pg||
nt|woozle: This should be a good match - the strong Global team has come off a big loss to play the leaders USA Hampson|pg||
nt|mariner1: are they Global, or just merely confused? :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all - |pg||
nt|mariner1: top 15 advance + Yeh Bros team as sponsors|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: top 16 go through so both of these teams are comfortable, but top 7 get a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi All and Welcome to the Yeh Bros Cup Bridge Invitational Championships from the|pg||
nt|mariner1: Gold Coast in Australia   http://www.yehcup09.com.au/  - Tournament site. This is|pg||
nt|mariner1: the knockouts - round 1 set 2.|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: -  standings.|pg||
nt|yeh2009: 16 Boards|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike's son is sitting East here|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|1C|nt|santyclz: Northeast Pennsylvania (our local excuse for mountains.)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Rob and all|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sunsamvar: hi Al and welcome all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hello again Sunil|pg||
nt|gowdy: soft 1st hand  4 @S looks easy|pg||
nt|woozle: Easy 4S for NS to begin...hard to imagine what else they might do with it|pg||
nt|mariner1: our Operator is Dave Thompson - hi Dave!|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Gary!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ge rob, gary, spectators|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Martin1|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: probably a @c partscore for EW here|pg||
nt|mrdct: west thinking of passing this in|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H instead of DBL is interesting choice|pg||
nt|pbundy: well; i haven't seen this for a while! natural to play bid over 1NT|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes A Y   are in tenth place  and the face quiet a good team   Beware*|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Martin, close match|pg||
nt|yeh2009: I like the North 1NT opening get it all off your chest at once|pg||
nt|mariner1: Gary I see you are still in NZ :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Looks like an uneventful 3nt to get everybody settled in.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: veteran Indonesian pair facing a lot younger Dutch pair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks, hi Steve.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: West took a while to open that hand- was he going to pass ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's often not a good idea to open in 4th seat without a @S suit|pg||
nt|salokin: Hi All|pg||
nt|pbundy: is 2@S appropriate?  hard to know|pg||
nt|mariner1: the top 8 enter next session with NO LOSSES , next 8 with ONE LOSS and its|pg||
nt|mariner1: double elimination, two losses and you are out|pg||
nt|lestergold: well first hand looks like a good slam in hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: slam makes here if they find it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi again|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bjacobs: A well known husband wife combo here|pg||
nt|mildredb: perhaps they play wk NT |pg||
nt|pbundy: possibly - reasonable supposition|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|mrdct: as more often than not you write down -110 defending 2@S|pg||
nt|pbundy: manoppo wisely passes|pg||
nt|gowdy: may get to the 5 level   but no harm there|pg||
nt|woozle: Bold 4H from McGann, escapes for 800 if he guesses trumps|pg||
nt|woozle: Even a slam move from Curtis will escape unscathed as long as he counts his aces correctly|pg||
nt|gowdy: yes  even todat's game 4NT should be blackwood|pg||
nt|woozle: presumably NS have the mechanism to show a better 4S bid, like pass-then-pull|pg||
nt|mariner1: the 1@D call should help bid the slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by south its very good|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Hi everyone   will stay a few boards with you     of this exciting KO  match|pg||
nt|lestergold: and with K dim onside its fine played by north|pg||
mb|4N|nt|othered1: I assume 3@His a summary auction |pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: garbage stayman|pg||
nt|santyclz: Struck gold.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@D Texas transfer|pg||
nt|yeh2009: 4@D Texas transfer|pg||
nt|mariner1: I had Gary relocated last night :)|pg||
nt|yeh2009: Not SOUTH AFRICAN Texas which would be 4@C|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mariner1: so both these teams have a shot at being in the top 8 which is a big advantage|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: american style raise by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: sunny 81f or 25c at the venue|pg||
nt|frankaus: still time to catch a flight to one of autralias national events :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: pairs start Sunday - teams Tues|pg||
nt|mrdct: a problem for EW here is that 1@C doesn't show a @C suit so they could lose their fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doubleton @SQ will help - but can east maintain control?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Al bbl might have got them to the great 6@D contract|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: border lines value to reach it|pg||
mb|6H|nt|santyclz: Have to confess I'd spend all my time scuba diving on your reefs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hi Steve, Joe and Marshall|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 3rd and final @h?|pg||
nt|mrdct: lindqvist might play his partner for 5@h here and compete to 3@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: but I would suggest he's already fully described his hand and should leave it up to south to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|jbgood: n still thinking - not good|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Joanna and Lew Stansby against the best of British|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Bill Jacobs and Jan van Cleeff|pg||
nt|imp_jan: folks good morning (it's europe here)|pg||
nt|salokin: very popular now to play TRF over a (semi)nat 1@C opening 1@S is then a TRF to 1N or sometimes @D's |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: declarer will have no problem to collect at least 8 tricks probably 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: hi Roland, steve, Joe and specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: He'll still be fine unless he duplicates the other table's line of play - I don't know which additional loser they found|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: or even ten with the nice position of cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Michael Askgaard|pg||
nt|mariner1: well bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@H also in Open|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: but no border for the good players from N !|pg||
pc|h3|nt|santyclz: He did only have 7 hcp for his x, but who's counting?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this contract looks quite safe|pg||
nt|mildredb: this can go dn 3 w/ best def|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better played by north actually|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: and England did well OR  too|pg||
pc|h2|nt|robinswr: club lead is to be able to cross ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: E showed hearts - so what? Hi all|pg||
nt|mrdct: he is a passed hand though so a shapely 7 count looks fair enough to me|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: oops, balanced them in to a game that may make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Brad Coles from Australia|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: just go for 3 round of @d  cash the Qof @c and finesse trump   easy seeing all 52 cards!|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Brad|pg||
nt|redgrover: hi all -- i'm very excited to see our kids on vugraph at this stage of the event|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, brilliant effort|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: how old are they Brad ?|pg||
nt|redgrover: nabil is about 16, andy early 20s|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sunsamvar: dbl|pg||
nt|bjacobs: N/S were right the first time with 2@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even with that lead - no entry to North!|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4 losers in 4h!|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes; needs an immediate diamond shift|pg||
nt|mildredb: shdn't be hard to find - |pg||
pc|h4|nt|santyclz: It would be an impressive system that could get to 4@h on this hand.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not arguing with the x, but thinking over 3@c is an overbid.|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes i agree he has a clear pass over 3@c|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mrdct: but some players do like to think everything through twice|pg||
nt|mildredb: or @S|pg||
nt|askgaard: Hi|pg||
nt|othered1: @H split here isn't great, but friendly and guessable @D position may salvage this for NS|pg||
nt|yeh2009: 4@Sx only -300|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in the first half we saw a classic nt shape of 2227|pg||
pc|hA|nt|salokin: other table ended up in 3@C after a precicion 2@D opening (short@D I think) |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Nikolas Bausback, Germany, and Martin Carroll, Ireland|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|salokin: Hi All|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes; i guess if you lead back a spade and declarer goes up to lead a club - no dummy entries.|pg||
nt|pbundy: hard for the defense to go wrong|pg||
nt|pbundy: manoppo had to find another round of restraint.  not so easy on the auction.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here can discard the club and make seven|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: 6@D - yikes  i hadn't even considered that|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: Best option is to lead a top spade from hand at trick 2, and catch East napping|pg||
nt|mildredb: @C now , the south need to ret low @H, otherwise might get endplayed|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: very young chaps  then good show |pg||
pc|s3|nt|mmmakela: Here in Finnish Lappland we got a meter of snow|pg||
nt|frankaus: reef is some distance from the venue (600-800 km) - but a fine surfing beach virtually accross the road|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Marshall Lewis from USA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi All|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: N was not that far from an invitation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just wondering if they could find making game :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Team name Bridge i Norge means (as I am sure you have guessed) Bridge in Norway, the official bridge magazine there. Boye Brogeland is the editor|pg||
nt|pbundy: i think that this is ok IF north overtakes|pg||
nt|mildredb: sure|pg||
nt|pbundy: tough play to find tho|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: http://www.yehcup09.com.au/  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Progressive scores in all matches: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=6&T=R|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: passed out seems extreme?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I dont think the hand was thrown in in the OR|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: rehi|pg||
nt|pbundy: still - even 300 will be a nice pickup|pg||
pc|sT|nt|imp_jan: defenders cash out already|pg||
nt|pbundy: perhaps south should have anticipated and led low in any case.  even if south could have smothered the ten - a heart pitch is likely irrelevant|pg||
pc|s5|nt|santyclz: Yes, but more sharks at the bridge table.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Nicoleta Giura|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by north can be put to a dimiand decision at trick 1|pg||
mc|13|nt|Walddk4: Hi Martin and Marshall|pg||

nt|redgrover: adam 17, ally 24, peter 20 and justin 19 (all approximate ages)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: I never understood why you must open 1NT on 5422 when you have no rebid problem after 1@C|pg||
mb|5H|nt|hedyg: @s lead vs 3NT|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: when the bidding goes 1@c-1@H-1@s-1NT do you raise to 2NT with the S hand Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|hedyg: so i guess that is a reason to open 1NT, also trying to protect the red kings|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: If partner can't bid 2NT, he can forget it. I already showed 5-4 with 1@C followed by 1@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 10 HCPs as N would you bid 2NT over 1@s?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: certain 10 counts, sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and 16 opposite 9 with no fit is no bargain|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: Responder knows if we have a fit or not|pg||

nt|ahollan1: This might help explain why Japan Seniors won the Senior event in the Beijing World Mind Sports Games|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Marrku|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm told 4@H also|pg||
nt|mariner1: made 7 in Open it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: four for me nonvul|pg||
nt|frankaus: poll for final contract & result ? 4@S NS 4 me|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5@hx would be my guess.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 5@Hdbld|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://www.yehcup09.com.au/index.php is website with all kinds of info|pg||
nt|woozle: This deal is a free-for-all - whoever wins the bidding is free to struggle in a contract of their choice|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ok for 10 tricks then   I woudl have prefered to throw a@h on the 3rd round of @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yeah passed is not probable there|pg||
mb|1H|nt|imp_jan: as it is on this one...|pg||
nt|othered1: Cayne jumps off to a 7-imp lead by making an overtrick in 4@H on board 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4sd best spot here|pg||
mb|2H!|an|!S !D|nt|mariner1: EW can go a long way to save|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i bet bidding reaches 5 level|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 5 @h a good save|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|santyclz: Anyone for 5@s by s?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not with this bidding tempo, S might bid on|pg||
nt|imp_jan: that's what i mean: 3nt|pg||
nt|gowdy: transfer here    yes :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have a profitable save in hearts against spade game at the vulnerability|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can save at 6 @H too.........|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: at 5 level  @s   usually win|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can make 4@H on a Motsian fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: EW using the increasingly popular treatment of transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|pbundy: mildred - assuming stnd methods, do you prefer 1@C or 1@D with this hand?|pg||
nt|mildredb: i open 1D w/ 4-4|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moysian|pg||
nt|redgrover: 3NT also likely to make|pg||
nt|askgaard: Sensible bidding by NS here|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume 4c is a jump fit|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H is Michaels, @S and a minor.,,,,,,,,,, 4@H is cue in support of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: so townsend will know there is a double fit|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: wure 5 cards in @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C has to be jump fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure i like 4@H bid, what is the purpose of it|pg||
mb|5D|nt|santyclz: The 4@h opening at the other table got them to our expected contract.|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like i have a winning ticket :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I blame Lasut!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@H looks makable here for EW|pg||
nt|mrdct: and NS playing transfers also i believe|pg||
nt|woozle: If West transfers to spades he'll surprise North a bit, and then keep him quiet|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are overboard possibilities here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: EW have the chance to get the singleton @C not on lkead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South checks the backs of the cards ... partner has overcalled vul, they've bid to 3NT, and I've got THAT hand?|pg||
nt|woozle: 2S might be a chance to make, particularly if the DQ doesn't appear now|pg||
nt|woozle: 2S, 2D, 1H,3C will do|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3rd and 5th  is the Q rite ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moysian = 4 3|pg||
nt|mariner1: think it shows raise with defense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to me it implies a better hand outside hearts than brink has|pg||
mb|6S|nt|redgrover: if north plays it|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 5 @c  seems more probable but difficult to make|pg||
nt|frankaus: $US70,000 first prize would make a nice filler for thir budgets|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am told Andy is 21,,, still excellent play for his age|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: score corrected|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I'll get clarification|pg||
nt|mariner1: Nick is now our Operator|pg||
nt|yeh2009: Hi Nick|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: hi from down the hallway|pg||
nt|lestergold: i predicted it but auctions niot finished|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@S off 1 in Open.... miss guessed @c?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe trying to induce a 7@H sacrifice|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this could be a push if no DBL|pg||
nt|dburn: no, just lost a diamond ruff, one assumes|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: @d  ead ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes @D ruff does beat 5 did not see that|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if townsend passes which he should ,david will know that he has a likely defensive trick so they should defend|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: townsend thinking deeply...|pg||
nt|lestergold: and altho thuird in hand at green tom did open the bidding|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is a minor violation of one of Burn's Laws|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you don't sac with trump ace, maybe thinking double|pg||
nt|mariner1: subtract the number of Aces the opponents have from 8 and do not bid at that level|pg||
nt|lestergold: argument in favour of the phantom 7h is insurance of course massively expensive if they get it wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: i.e. defend and 6s makes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just as well there are screens|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 4@H = good spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: I'd bid 3 @H without the club ace|pg||
nt|santyclz: Markku and I each owe you a coke.  (No you can't make it a beer.)|pg||
nt|jbgood: after a @c opening - yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: but not now|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: the backs are blue|pg||
nt|imp_jan: previous brds the hackeds avoided 4@H indeed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: what pattern?|pg||
nt|redgrover: these guys are all very experienced -- they were in the finals of our nationals 2 years ago, and have some international experience too|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: rosenkranz type maybe, promising 1/3 high honors in spades|pg||
nt|salokin: Hi Marrku|pg||
nt|mildredb: obviously n/s is playing stg @C system|pg||
nt|woozle: Declarer now does best to try for a diamond ruff in hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: Fast Arrival|pg||
nt|santyclz: Transfers over a 1@c bid seem to work particularly well with Polish @c.|pg||
nt|mrdct: @C lead looks pretty clear-cut here|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess 1 down|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think if you are going to play transfers over 1@C it definately makes sense to broaden the range of hands that open 1@c|pg||
nt|jbgood: corrected by kibs: 2 down|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North sweats ...|pg||
nt|imp_jan: here, in 4!x there 4 top losers|pg||
nt|imp_jan: in 4@c|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same bidding in Open|pg||
nt|marlowepi: IMO it is not obvious for W to pass this out in 2S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably 2H showed 4|pg||
nt|salokin: or some kind of snapdragon, promising semifit and 5-c in 4th suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Round 7:  Yeh Bros v USA Hampson and India Venkatesh v India National|pg||
nt|salokin: same bidding in OR|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 4 @c sounds like a cue|pg||
nt|askgaard: Not nice to have a hidden 5 card heart suit, but 2@h is too ugly with these cards|pg||
nt|askgaard: So I like his double|pg||
nt|lestergold: good boy now david's turn and he has gotm ir right|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|robinswr: i like weak fast arrivals|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was 2H something special? or did 1H not show 5?|pg||
nt|robinswr: i think 1heart was artificial|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spec copnfirms it, yes thx|pg||
nt|imp_jan: good save against 3@h :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 @H seemed automatic|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction has given minimum info away, the killing spade lead not at all obvious|pg||
pc|cA|nt|frankaus: beer is a little early 10:45 am here|pg||
nt|mrdct: The official website is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ with links to live scores from all matches, a webcam and other goodies.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks and welcome, Dave.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Running scores for all matches can be found at http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=3&T=R|pg||
nt|gowdy: only loses to this  and he may lead the j from thst|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mildredb: interesting - having to rebid 2NT w/o stopper in either suit :)|pg||
nt|woozle:  If the next card is a low heart, Hanlon will probably get it right|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: very well done good judgement by South|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to stay low though 5@C has a little play|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H is the spot, now to make|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lebridgeur: that shoud not be much of problem  with EW distribution|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course no great result hewre as they must have found the dim ruff in the open room|pg||
pc|cK|nt|santyclz: Really oper?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sry, my first, lost it :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: live results will be available from all tables - at http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here's another "making slam" :)|pg||
nt|salokin: but not "lawfull" :) |pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open it has gone P P 1@D DBL - 4@D so far|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kiwibridge: the puppet has avoided the S lead|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the pleasant surprises continue :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: effective bidding by curtis and joe has lead to a poor 3nt|pg||
nt|redgrover: is this one of those hands where you duck a heart? or is that too risky with 2 possible spade losers?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: hung toying between @S5 and @D9|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open it has gone P P 1@D DBL - 4@D - DBL - P - 4@S - P P P  so wrong spot there|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: well a difficult hand to bid with opponents silent  but @d opening stillmore difficult I do not like south double 2@c seems more appropriate|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: now he's moved the @D5 to the end of his hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mmmakela: if supp dbls and E promises 4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: sometimes the Lore of Total Tricks is not all there is to it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dias fit to be considered|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mrdct: the official site is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ which has links to lots of useful info|pg||
nt|jbgood: double dummy to take it 2 down - needs a small heart |pg||
nt|jbgood: but the rest is also double dummy - so...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, W has an 8-loser hand with all cards working. should be safe at 3 level, and NS arent going to double anywya|pg||
nt|mmmakela: right on|pg||
mc|11|nt|mildredb: in the open room, a @S was led|pg||
nt|lestergold: so flat after all the excitement|pg||
pg||

nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not so sure. This is a very good 15 count|pg||
nt|jfaria: 3x 6?|pg||
nt|hedyg: but xxx in @H and no stayman|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Where do you think partner's values are for a quant 4NT?|pg||
mb|d|nt|jfaria: a balance between the 15 count and the fifth @d..|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria: the 15 won |pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think this is a maximum|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Forget about 15 or 17, look at your hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: AK@S, QJ@H?|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|hedyg: that is 17 HCPs..|pg||

pc|c4|pc|s3|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Yes, remarkably, this might be the par result - if reached a bit unorthodox|pg||
nt|imp_jan: england is in 17th postion, usa stansby in 20th (out of 24 teams)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: amazingly Lavazza is last in the rankings for the moment|pg||
nt|rogerclee: i wouldn't really call a 1@H overcall at these colors "fairly orutine", but it is normal in NS's style|pg||
nt|gowdy: 4@S here  play or defend ?|pg||
nt|woozle: routine 4S for EW, and Curtis probably won't try to disrupt their auction at this vul|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S should be off 1|pg||
nt|me argent: a little disapointing 4 NS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: these discards look unlikely, damage done with no spade shift after diamond ace|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N needed @S switch when in A@D|pg||
mb|1N!|an|8-12|nt|mmmakela: so loses a club and 2 spades |pg||
nt|marlowepi: this should be fun|pg||
nt|woozle: or I could be wrong|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|robinswr: maybe grue should have opened 1heart|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes it is very dangerous to open strong club when very distributional and short in spades|pg||
nt|mrdct: very good slam for EW here in @H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: no.. but will still make 12 cause @D split|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in 3N here in Open  S playing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually a diamond lead was safe, club tricks going no where|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but could tom be sure?|pg||
nt|mariner1: S playing a very weak 1N NV|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think so trump ace gives him total control|pg||
nt|mariner1: N might do some leaping here to jam|pg||
nt|dburn: suppose that East had held @CKQxx|pg||
nt|dburn: then, a club lead would have been necessary and a diamond lead faintly ridiculous|pg||
nt|fabsayc: would not help, clam cold then|pg||
nt|fabsayc: slam|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugrapha3: correct|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: hello btw :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: No problem, for some reason the players frequently seem to have other things on their minds than ensuring the vg oper can see all their plays.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if NS are playing Precision or not - and 1@S doesn't resolve that issue |pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have major game and EW can't save due to VUL position I think|pg||
mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: in general the same is true when two-suited, but on previous board N held spades, so the danger was greatly reduced|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a remarkable field - full of quality |pg||
nt|imp_jan: might be a slam in clubs here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: R3: Australia Youth v Bridge i Norge and New Zealand v India National|pg||
nt|robinswr: 5clubs should show spade support|pg||
nt|mildredb: interesting X|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes; i wouldn't find it myself|pg||
nt|woozle: one club ruff in hand is ten tricks, losing a heart, diamond and the club ace|pg||
nt|woozle: McGann will always get to game here, but how he proceeds will perhaps give us an insight into his style|pg||
mb|3N|nt|santyclz: On the @hk lead, e will probably make 6.|pg||
nt|robinswr: no he'll probably lose a club and a diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Joe means, because E can place the high cards|pg||
nt|mrdct: with 3@H showing a strong @H raise east is sure to make a move towards slam now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Easier for those who play any rebid other than 2@s shows extras, either in hcp or distribution.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice practical 4@S rebid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the Chinese are supposed to be precise :)|pg||
nt|redgrover: i think 5@D by east requires a heart lead to get 500|pg||
nt|mariner1: of course NS have to bid the game to play it|pg||
nt|mariner1: N in 3@S DBL in Open here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: u all agree with 2 clubs? |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: incidentally, tempo altered on purpose|pg||
nt|mildredb: I'm w/ you|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3 h  is my choice|pg||
nt|woozle: Hanlon can't bid 3S now, since that's what he would bid with a yarborough|pg||
nt|gowdy: could rite side it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: lots of playing strength so some might bid 3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same 3nt at other table on board 2|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S was off 3 and 14 imps|pg||
nt|frankaus: "live" scoreboard for every match at  http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=10&T=I|pg||
nt|othered1: pretty aggressive double, wonder if he planned a conversion to @D over 3@C|pg||
nt|askgaard: It's a good idea to have firm agreements about passes like north's here|pg||
nt|askgaard: Some play that it is a penalty pass. I do for instance.|pg||
nt|shevek: since EW can make game, not so dangerous...|pg||
nt|othered1: You could argue it's a penalty pass, but south fortunately has a doubleton @H , making a stack in north's hand very  unlikely|pg||
nt|askgaard: yes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and north has only one Jack that isn't working -- wow talk about cover cards|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hard to predict the fin contract on this one unless W opens 1 NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Which they did in OR|pg||
nt|woozle: 9xxx doesn't look much like a stopper, maybe 4H is the best bid|pg||
nt|gowdy: pass here|pg||
nt|woozle: 3NT makes anyway in comfort|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: who is the boss     sort of hand  here!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Søren Christiansen|pg||
nt|askgaard: It's a VERY expensive misunderstanding to have|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what was townsend double showing|pg||
pc|d5|nt|santyclz: I do, bad honor structure.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3@d not alerted, kind of waiting bid i suppose|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think 3@D is natural, which South will turn into a cue with 4@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a difficult area for natural bidding|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: well it may have been alerted, casually|pg||
nt|pbundy: manoppo may wish that he had found pass, too|pg||
nt|gowdy: it is a stop however :)|pg||
nt|sac: hi all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: famous last words, this will go down|pg||
nt|dburn: I imagine it was for penalty|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
pc|d7|nt|woozle: I wouldn't be too confident against a vul weak two|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=10&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: syandings after 9 rounds|pg||
nt|shevek: hi Søren|pg||
nt|askgaard: Hi teammate!|pg||
nt|othered1: is double by west simply extras, even on this auction?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rogerclee: i am surprised at this non-diamond lead|pg||
nt|pbundy: not good when they play the same suit at both tables by the same team|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 4@C is low anyway|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: fall from grace here for NS but I do not know to whom the blame should go|pg||
nt|shevek: aha|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I do too, was just asking|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm not quite sure what "serious 3NT bid" means - but it's got them on the right track for slam now|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Serious means he is very keen to go to slam.|pg||
nt|jbgood: apart from being a world champ - brogeland is the editor (and owner) of Bridge i Norge. His prd made his debut on the Nor Open Team last year by winning the European Teams Chship|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This auction will not make their highlight reel ... but they may escape with a game|pg||
nt|imp_jan: anyhow, the heart lead doesn't paralyze declarer|pg||
nt|gowdy: good to make the opps work for a push or lose 1 hand|pg||
nt|dburn: and 3@h showed spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications very awkward in this contract|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sunsamvar: good lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a vital tempo for defense lost|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead in Open doomed it quick|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: brogeland has been a frequent visitor to Australia in recent years to play in our major national events|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - and with Erichsen and for Stern|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: Looking at the N/S hands, 3NT is a dreadful spot|pg||
nt|pbundy: i hope children are not watching; this will not be pretty|pg||
nt|mildredb: hard to even know what to do @@ trick 2 :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: anyone for 2@C originally with the east hand?  not that 2@C would meet a particularly nice fate, either|pg||
nt|pbundy: medic|pg||
nt|mildredb: I don't understand east's pass, myself|pg||
nt|pbundy: i once was playing against a top lady professional with a client in a mixed pairs.  she put down a less than exquisite dummy, and her partner said "ms. x - i need to go to the ...|pg||
nt|pbundy: bathroom.  YOU play it" and left!|pg||
nt|mildredb: but 2@C looks better than 2@D|pg||
nt|pbundy: i would be tempted to do that on this hand - except - it was declarer who emerged the partnership in this |pg||
nt|pbundy: yes it does, mildred|pg||
nt|othered1: Why was 2@H alerted?  Anyone confident about it?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The losing team disappears from the main event and heads into the Swiss Plate|pg||
nt|sac: Better to lead Diamond Q this time but smal is normal|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: lauria said something to north about the 2@h bid but didn't write it down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Let me find the CC|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: versace didnt alert it only lauria|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|frankaus: make will bid 2@C - if pd passes its likely to be the best spot|pg||
nt|mrdct: hopefully EW have a mechanism to work out they are off the trump A|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like this will make....... has to play @H right|pg||
nt|lestergold: tom would like to be in dummy to take heart and club finesses doesnt have a helicopter shame they did not find a way  of treahing their 4/4 ht fit|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: not obvious why S is doubling. could N pass be forcing?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|frankaus: *many|pg||
nt|me argent: and a @D leads dooms it later|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sunsamvar: only needs @Dk from p to take it down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on @D return, @CA @C ruff, trump, claim losing @HA|pg||
nt|imp_jan: this time a big club migth do the job|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and this is just setting up tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Single raise not mentioned|pg||
nt|askgaard: 4@h in the other room. Hard to decide which game is the better|pg||
nt|othered1: 9 easy tricks, even though south's distribution might not be clear to east|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he cannot exactly "play "@h right" since he has no entry to the table|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart to king will endplay south|pg||
nt|lestergold: why did nt david bid 3d presumably shopwing both majors?|pg||
nt|dburn: but this will do, since South is now somewhat endplayed|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mrdct: most recently on Nick Irens' team|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NEXT|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@h showed spades|pg||
nt|dburn: it did not show hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3d would have showed both majors surely?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jbgood: y|pg||
nt|dburn: no, 3@d would have shown hearts|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Systems/Open/Italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bjacobs: which is going to make a massive number of tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: not Quick Silver though Joey :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|gowdy: better to play this  one in w with a @D lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: off only one now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why queen?|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely tom should have run the club minjd u he doesnt know which honours are in the north  hand|pg||
nt|dburn: double would have been for takeout, but East did not want to risk West passing for penalty|pg||
pc|d8|nt|robinswr: north is shows his hcps so that the clubs will be misguessed|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: @H play works, but only because West has !AH|pg||
nt|redgrover: i think given that North was given the chance to double 3@H, he's probably done his part|pg||
nt|frankaus: i like to let pd know that we have 8 major fit but, here - 1@S over 1@H would have placed NS in a better position|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in 4@S here in Open|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mmmakela: the lead was strange imo|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|mmmakela: club seemed obvious|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mrdct: claiming now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now he is out of endplays|pg||
nt|dburn: no, he isn't|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is looking  very bad board for engalnd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jack and a diamond but not really safe|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, for pity's sake|pg||
nt|pitiful: yes i can see that :) |pg||
nt|pitiful: sorry private|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: townsend still thinking|pg||
nt|mariner1: thinking is good up to a point :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|robinswr: so does he play for qj onsides or singleton honor offsides or QJ offsides|pg||
nt|dburn: well, as soon as South showed out on the second diamond, he was known to be either 4=4=1=4 or 4=3=1=5|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c4|nt|robinswr: he can make it if north has a singleton honor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: It may seem odd that N did not try to cash heart with only stiuff in dummy. N is reasoning that: (a) EW would not bid a slam off 2 aces, and (b) S would have led hearts unless he ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: had so many that a void was probable. both assumptions less than guaranteed|pg||
nt|robinswr: is north 7-5 in the reds|pg||
nt|santyclz: S followed to 3 @ds.|pg||
nt|robinswr: easy looking at all four hands tough at the table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@H  5-9  3-card support|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|woozle: He tangled the play a little, but was never really in trouble|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|robinswr: south never support hearts so north could have 9 of them|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: at this point Grue claimed 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h3|nt|santyclz: Magic @c position.  The normal @c lead would have worked out much better.|pg||
nt|mariner1: so -200 will score imps for EW here|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: so that will level the match|pg||
nt|lestergold: is tom going to pull this off?|pg||
nt|dburn: in either case (since North must have @sA for the contract to have a play) this line is safe|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|h6|nt|mariner1: maybe not..... strange not pulling trumps|pg||
nt|mariner1: -500 then|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he is closer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nice read of the cards and catering to north having a club left|pg||

pc|sA|nt|me argent: versace is from school that sees down one takes it and only then looks for more|pg||

nt|frankaus: hard to see this not being played in 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true though the more hearts N has, the less likely for him to open 1C with a spade void|pg||
nt|santyclz: I couldn't find a good link to a good definition of "serious 3nt".  If anyone has one, pls send it.|pg||

nt|me argent: i guess he is hard of seeing|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|dburn: he had it half an hour ago, but he at least was working out what the hand was actually about|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mcarroll: Now this could be more interesting|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am not a fan of minimum offshape doubles|pg||
mb|1H|an|natural|nt|santyclz: 6@h works nicely, though.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6 beaten only by a diamond lead|pg||
nt|pbundy: the last hand did nothing to disabuse me of that belief|pg||

nt|pbundy: on the other hand.... i am somewhat fond of "barts" - 4/3/3/3 takeout doubles|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh they were Not DBL'd  I looked wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: sorry I for sure thought I saw a DBL :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: so somem yougsters still play ordinary weak twos|pg||
nt|redgrover: 3NT possibly off on a diamond lead here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: a frienfly hand for 3NT|pg||
nt|mittmouse: in the 1st match there was a trump suit of q9x opposite a10xxxx a great canadian player percy sheardown taught me that as long as righty wouldnt duck with kx u should play low to ...|pg||

nt|salokin: X shows ?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: @hs|pg||
nt|salokin: Ah thx now i see|pg||
nt|pbundy: still - this one is awfully minimum.  i think i might skip this one|pg||
nt|gowdy: is this a "good weak 2 with 2@D showing a poor one ?|pg||
nt|woozle: Interesting weak two from Grue, with more flaws than I can count|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is my 5th session is my excuse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what happened?|pg||
nt|me argent: someone is hard of cing|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry i fell asleep|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N showing as +1 now????|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3n-1 surely|pg||
nt|me argent: hell as a canadian ill take it|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mmmakela: hearts better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if 3@C is fit-showing or just some artificial 4card @S raise|pg||
nt|gowdy: Looks like it |pg||
nt|woozle: Nothing bad happening to him though, unless you're afraid to miss a playable featherweight game|pg||
mb|2D|nt|imp_jan: how to stay out of game on this one?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not easy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@D - 3@H - Pass?  Seems a bit double dummy|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i think he'll punt 3NT, but he is thinking|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3@c not anybody's choice, some would have opted for 3@h i.s.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: like me :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: not me unless they are full value|pg||
nt|pbundy: curious pass by lasut|pg||
nt|woozle: Interesting lead...will McGann pick it?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: did sheardown play with bruce elliot?|pg||
nt|redgrover: but might get a heart lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: 8-11, they have 2@D for weak, weak 2 i think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently 3@S is an inferential splinter|pg||
mb|3D|nt|santyclz: I guess e was wondering what s had for his x.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wow, tom townsend is taking a view|pg||
nt|imp_jan: by passing|pg||
nt|mmmakela: they shd find on the way that 4 @S is the spot|pg||
nt|mcarroll: May not be so easy with NS so active|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @D lead needed ....... a @S or @H makes it    @c is nuetral|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: no the right guess  difficult let us admit|pg||
nt|redgrover: would have still been time to find @D switch after a top heart lead, but too late now of course|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: declarer   will pick the@c suit with no entry in the dummy|pg||
nt|redgrover: yes, would go down if he was able to finesse|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: results in all matches - refresh often|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N for sure if EW find it|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mrdct: west will soon know he has a 9 card @H fit and a nice side suit of his own so slam ought to be bid here i expect|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The operation is a success, but the patient (3@C) is not going to live|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, it's not clear that 3@H would have made either|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and in breaking news, Lavazza are on course to win a match|pg||
nt|gowdy: notpossible|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: grue just asked hanlon if he ever undleads aces, after he won the trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n is now coming|pg||
mb|d|nt|mittmouse: y|pg||
nt|pbundy: you'd be hard pressed to call this one "full value" mildred!|pg||

mb|3N|nt|mmmakela: brb cig br|pg||
nt|frankaus: my beer stock is rising - all my other stock are falling :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wondered it too. am i talking too loud?|pg||
nt|mrdct: not to mention his stiff @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N serious slam try?  4@S reject ??|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well 3@c 'feels' stronger'|pg||
nt|mrdct: official website is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ for live scores from all tables, a webcam and other goodies.|pg||
nt|woozle: My experience with Ace underleads is that quite often the lead looks technically great, but partner doesn't read the position and hands back whatever the lead gained and then some|pg||
nt|dburn: well, no one has passed yet and the auction has already reached 3@s|pg||
nt|mariner1: why DBL 3@S here?|pg||
nt|dburn: so provided no one continues to pass, someone will bid 3NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4th Burn's Law ? :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers suggest DBL was do not lead a @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: iwhat is 3 @C ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i met bruce elliot Toronto in 79 or 80 at one of the most impressive bridge clubs i've ever seen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he was impressive too|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I don't think there was a plus score on this deal for E/W.  Even defending 2@S won't work - that contract makes|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: I am not sure whether records have been kept, but I am prepared to be that this is the longest auction without a pass in the history of bridge|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: x i think is some sort lead direction|pg||
nt|lestergold: welll the play will be a little more starightforward than the auction|pg||
pc|d7|nt|robinswr: he doubled on his partner's 1club opener|pg||
nt|mmmakela: active as a dbl on 1-level, not that disturbing|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: at the end   South will thank North to have a weak hand !|pg||
nt|askgaard: Not so hot to blast 4@s and find partner with @hJxx|pg||
nt|sac: worried about a heartlead and a ruff in spades|pg||
mc|9|nt|ahollan1: 1M-(DBL)-2N would have been Limit Raise +   -- just not sure about 3@C :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: S is in 3@C here in Open so more to Global|pg||

mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: another comfy 3NT that may not be that easy to reach|pg||

nt|fabsayc: sounds too much like running to me to bid 1@D|pg||
mb|2H|nt|robinswr: probably showing a spade stopper (Slow Lebensohl)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 and probably 2+@D  -- Precision catchall|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: as far as i can se north did not ask about he 2@h bid!|pg||
mb|d|nt|robinswr: there goes 3nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am sure you are right, but as far as i am concerned S should just bid 3NT. after all, opps have bid two suits, so even if one of them is right to lead for the defense, they still ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have to find it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west would have to return a diamond to hold to 5|pg||
nt|woozle: Will Hanlon rip 3NT?|pg||
nt|gowdy: after P's free bid ?|pg||
nt|askgaard: Hmm|pg||
nt|mariner1: well no matter what I would like to do I am sure there are systematic limitations|pg||
nt|lestergold: on the lead of a k and another dim not too cheap david|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe down three, after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Our matches in round 2 are: China A vs Norway and USA Hampson (Meckwell) vs Chinese Taipei|pg||

nt|mildredb: yep, 6 badly needed imps |pg||
nt|gowdy: he knows  but what to do|pg||
nt|woozle: McGann doesn't really have anywhere to go except 3NT|pg||
nt|gowdy: I'm glam I'm here and not sitting W|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: this board has been played 4 times so far twice in 4@S twice in 6@S|pg||

nt|othered1: or maybe it's a cue-bid in support of partner's overcall?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: south says 3@C is a @S raise to his screenmate (west)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mmmakela: surprised Erik(saelesminde) resting in this key match|pg||
nt|woozle: 6D can be made, if that's where they finish|pg||
nt|othered1: or perhaps a fit-showing bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|robinswr: sounds a 50 point deck|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so? if N calmly passes they might lead clubs. these methods that give so much info to opps are of dubious practical value when you have 25 HCP and two balanced hands.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 sp is 1 nt without a heart stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the set  2 was a rollercoaster|pg||
nt|woozle: lots of dummy entries for the trump coup|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Hanlon thinking now|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@h might suggest @d shortage?|pg||
nt|askgaard: The 1@s overcall might look thin, but I think it would be standard for most players at this level|pg||
nt|sac: hard to pass for Lauria now|pg||
nt|shevek: other room W is playing 5@c dbled I'm told|pg||
nt|fabsayc: burns law in action|pg||
nt|mariner1: where will this end up? 2@D or 2@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: is this going to play any better by south?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: suppose ew play 2/1, that explains the 3@c by east|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: No but North knew what was going on after the D was ducked|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lack of action by W a bit surprising, facing Nonvul foes|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good contract|pg||
nt|mmmakela: a few down ok|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on this auction E is unlikely to have only five clubs, so W can act|pg||
nt|salokin: here the precision NAT 2@C opening left the @S-fit in the dark. Which was found in th OR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, it wasn;t just the opening bid that left spades unmentioned. W had 2 chances to bid the suit|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 2@S bal was obvious|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our Round 7 matches in about 55 mins are: Yeh Bros v USA Hampson and India Venkatesh v India National|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 2S directly would be inappropriate, a balance would be in order, i;d say|pg||
nt|salokin: true, and he possible knows that either ther is a 8-c @C fit or a 9-c @S -fit|pg||
nt|salokin: in 2@H N could save a trick with a intrafinesse in @D|pg||
nt|salokin: If getting in time in hand|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no entries I guess|pg||
nt|salokin: to play the 2nd @D round (1st smal to 8) Q@D to pin the doubleton J|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S now puts his suits in proper perspective|pg||
nt|mariner1: and are in trouble here now|pg||
nt|mariner1: E thinking penalties|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I think after 2 passes enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm this looks a little frightening|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@D or 3@H I meant and did not expect the E pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: are better off when the opponents pull all the trumps off the top?|pg||
nt|mariner1: are you|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mmmakela: NS pair nicknamed "Drinkdriver", has nothing to do with the actual meaning of the word :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oper, pls check that.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nico is teasing us.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: getting better by the minute|pg||
nt|mrdct: will score an extra @H trick at the very least|pg||
nt|jbgood: any better is also a way of putting it..|pg||
nt|mrdct: but doesnt have an obvious source of tricks|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: McGann sighed when he saw the four spades in dummy|pg||
nt|gowdy: but is it realy a 4 card spade suit or some @D try with a @S card  I don't know|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: so the law of probability dictates flat hands here i suppose|pg||
nt|dburn: West may remove this (unless South does, but surely even in these days, that's a penalty double)|pg||
nt|mariner1: S saves them.....|pg||
nt|dburn: no, it wasn't|pg||
nt|me argent: norts double saved them|pg||
nt|mariner1: now NS can get too high?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugrapha3: curtis didn't realise was his turn!|pg||
nt|redgrover: a nice little convention to have there, especially if partner is prone to being 2-2 in the majors|pg||
nt|sac: well done. The only game with a chance in this layout I think. But a long way to go|pg||
nt|mariner1: S decided to play 5 3 and not the 4 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: 4clubs would have gone down at least one probably two|pg||
nt|mrdct: he's surely going to go after @C here|pg||
nt|mrdct: west needs to be careful not to get endplayed|pg||
nt|jbgood: he will|pg||
nt|jbgood: go for clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: so they have another call to invite in @H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|nickf: Progressive scores in all matches are up: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=1&T=R|pg||
nt|mrdct: if south leads a @C up now and west winsm west might feel in necessary to switch to @S to get rid of the @SA entry|pg||
nt|shevek: only 50's|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: their system is called Drink|pg||
nt|frankaus: gib makes it will Manoppo?|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect he will|pg||
nt|santyclz: GIB looks at all 4 hands.  Gives it a slight advantage.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: A sensitive auction|pg||
nt|imp_jan: nothing against 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W established the the heart position was a bit shaky|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: i would bid    with w   cards  2@d and then 2@s   to show a weak major 2 suiter but I am much older|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: but you never can tell with boye|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bjacobs: That duck is a good expert tactic - threatening to ruff the losing heart, whilst maintaining control of the suit|pg||
nt|woozle: I think if you're going to skip the spades to get the excellent diamonds in, you should be  planning to bid the spades later|pg||
nt|shevek: declarer knows south is void in @cs|pg||
nt|askgaard: I don't like declarer's chances here|pg||
nt|sac: neither do I|pg||
nt|mariner1: lots of kibber jokes about being on the "Brink"|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: .|pg||
nt|askgaard: Some magic is needed|pg||
nt|sac: but I like it better than 5clucs doubled|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mrdct: boye hoping to get the opps to open up the side suits for him|pg||
nt|mariner1: knowing there are likely 4 @c in E (I think) @D would be a better spot|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why did versace play diamond king?|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|frankaus: not only looks but has repeated attemps if it finds a failing line :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: which wont work today|pg||
nt|mittmouse: did i really stay up for this|pg||
nt|redgrover: which may have been more appropriate on this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this looks like 1 off|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mmmakela: 6 shd make but the grand they bid in OR won't I suppose|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess it takes a trump lead to beat it.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@CX was down on ly one.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|robinswr: this is what happens when you operate and overcall 1nt with that hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OR:  ....this is what happens when you make a great bid but you are stuck with systemic agreements that gum up the works|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not as if 1D was more likely to get NS to 3NT than a 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|robinswr: maybe he should have run 6 diamonds before leading a spade|pg||
nt|shevek: west was told 3@C a @S raise, i c|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mariner1: W is playing 2@S here in Open|pg||
nt|me argent: since north ran from 1@Dx dont think south was confident of norts @D suit|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: i'm going to jump into the operating chair now - so i'll see you all on the other side shortly|pg||
nt|askgaard: Well done to escape for down one in 5@cX|pg||
pc|h6|nt|redgrover: of course if nabil had found a fit here, game could have been easy -- his partner's major suit holding was a disappointment|pg||
nt|lestergold: the ht pips working in favour of the defence|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mmmakela: now 3xspades must stand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sounds like we need another Buller/Culbertson match.|pg||
nt|sac: only one down in 5clubs, and this could go more than 2 down now I think, so maybe I was wrong (not the first time)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was probably worried about squeezing dummy|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: good play by Huang to not cover the 9. that made N think that W's remaining spade was the 8 or ten|pg||
nt|robinswr: tse is counting points and doesn't think his partner has any|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure why N played the ten of diamonds on the first round. that gave away a lot of information|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm told the other table is in 6S...I assume that suggests a big swing to USA Hampson|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: youngster in deep trouble in danger not to be in the first 16|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mildredb: now for the @S plays|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|robinswr: but he has to lead a heart or a club and a club will defenently give up a trick|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gowdy: well done by south in setting a very hard auction |pg||
pc|h8|nt|sunsamvar: the next few hands will wake u up George :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: in other match Cayne 16  India 4 after 5 boards|pg||
nt|mariner1: Yeh 26  i Norge 0 in other match after 5 boards|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: South can fold his cards after this trick|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|mittmouse: i hope so|pg||
nt|pbundy: as joey silver would say:  NEXT|pg||
nt|me argent: this looks like a fortunate NS result|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|woozle: It was likely going to be a hard auction regardless - West has a tough hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|frankaus: home now wd|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|santyclz: All roads seem to lead to -1.|pg||
nt|salokin: Deep finesse says that overruffing with @HJ costs a trick for the defense|pg||
nt|shevek: flat board after all :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|askgaard: How many boards are these knockout matches?|pg||
nt|askgaard: 32 I'm told|pg||
nt|othered1: 32|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mmmakela: intrafin you face very rarely, but when on and u play for it... what a pleasure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if he has not claimed yet this position never really happened|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I suspect the @D play was not shown correctly|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: claim time|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|bjacobs: West will be disappointed that @CK was doubleton in the pocket|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry yes you are right|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I'll fix it later|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mariner1: so J@D was played trick one........ players do not show the operator their cards, and|pg||
nt|mariner1: often hide them|pg||
nt|me argent: :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: huh?|pg||
nt|mariner1: they are not hiding them specifically from operator they are just in the habit of|pg||
nt|mariner1: breasting their cards|pg||
nt|me argent: in an open event?|pg||
nt|mariner1: could have been 10@D - small - small - Q@D too|pg||

nt|marlowepi: not too often you go down 500 in 4NT when you would probably be +600 in 3NT. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: George - getting back to the former greats from Canada - have you read the book about Murray-Kehela?|pg||
nt|woozle: Now some game for NS - 4H or 3NT will likely make|pg||
nt|redgrover: australian open team has just dropped out of the 16, but the youth are still fine at this point|pg||
nt|othered1: just another push|pg||
nt|me argent: en fin|pg||
mb|p|nt|mittmouse: y a very good book|pg||
mb|1C|nt|robinswr: he he had stripped the diamonds, he would have gone down only one|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the old adage is "when id doubt, run the long suit". amazing things can happen|pg||
nt|robinswr: i agree|pg||
nt|imp_jan: partscore battle on this one|pg||
nt|woozle: something like 3 passes, 1H:1NT then North's best guess...or maybe a 2NT opening|pg||
nt|gowdy: and now    can we find 4 @H|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like another 2-suited raise|pg||
nt|shevek: 16+16|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mittmouse: two great characters|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is where the all purpose strong hand double is handy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing team out, winning team one more chance. In fact, teams from the lower must win all of it from now on to win the event|pg||
nt|mariner1: big 5 imps there|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: i was hoping you'd say otherwise -- every time i try to buy it the dealer is sold out :(|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Might not even be a partscore battle|pg||
nt|woozle: 2NT probably kills thoughts of 4H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is a 1@C opener then my point on last hand was right|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open W bid 2 @H here......|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: West flew the white flag ... as would I|pg||
nt|imp_jan: peace full person: tom townsend|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are in 6@H on board 4, focus now on the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|redgrover: semi forcing means you can pass with a 5332 12-count|pg||
nt|mariner1: the youth are now in 15th spot however Yeh is 14 so they have a one spot cushion|pg||
nt|mariner1: left|pg||
nt|sac: 2spades was a bit timid I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Total prize fund  US$ 168,000  (winners 70 K)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: These two teams are in the undefeated pool and the losers will get one more chance tomorrow|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can make 3 of a minor|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is a roland favourite a 20/20 hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: another slam hand|pg||
nt|frankaus: the live scoring service is excellent - can view scores for the whole 12 tables |pg||
nt|mildredb: they are playin 2 way stayman|pg||
nt|gowdy: I guess 3nt is OK as well|pg||
nt|me argent: carruthers 1@C opening is weinsteins fault he opens all flat hands that way|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 5 loser hand.  Many places that's a 2@c bid, but frequently not in the USA.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=any 16+ ,  1N=8+ BAL, game force|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@D might have pushed N/S overboard - but it might also have resulted in -200, in 2@DX|pg||
nt|mildredb: 2@D = GF|pg||
nt|dburn: East unwilling to open a Multi with a maximum, some defensive stuff, and a hand playable in three suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi roland ur favourite hwere 20/20!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: the best I can tell the results link is not current|pg||
mb|1N|nt|woozle: 4H is awkward on a spade lead...have to play clubs for the spade pitch immediately|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: why?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: really im happy to hear that call roy hughes hell send u a copy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H looks natural but may be asking bid|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: very courageous bid by South |pg||
nt|redgrover: what to lead from three aces and the trump queen?|pg||
nt|me argent: double is a  @S transfer i believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: one road leads to + one:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: When I make that lead, declarer has kx.|pg||
nt|dburn: but his side may not now compete high enough|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The chance of both sides having 20 hcp is roughly 6.963%|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: - Running Scores refresh as needed|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: link to live scores - http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=1&T=R|pg||
nt|woozle: entries awkward in 3NT also, but easiest to trust in the heart break|pg||
nt|gowdy: 5 @H 2@S 2@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: can make now|pg||
nt|redgrover: a very understandable lead, but an unlucky one|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S isn't a bad save over makable 4@H.  |pg||
nt|othered1: of course, they weren't in 4|pg||
pc|s4|nt|santyclz: For us beginners, what would you pitch from dummy on the last 2 @ds?|pg||
nt|lestergold: without some help from tom i dont see how david could bid again|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this should be down one|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS likely winning 6+ imps here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: conceivably more|pg||
nt|dburn: how will they do that?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rogerclee: i dislike this pass by west|pg||
nt|me argent: and 1@S shows 3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: club ace, so slam will make|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|robinswr: grue will strip the hand and try to put west in to lead a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D looks like asking bid response -- showing primary @H support and ??? maybe > 10 hcp|pg||
nt|imp_jan: for the moment we have new event leaders: the team of mr yeh himself. he just took over from meckwel c.s.: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=20...|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 09&dir=yeh&E=0&R=5&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the @H play is key|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: yes, that was the problem i mentioned. the hope is that the foes will be more inconvenienced by the long suit than dummy will|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe the defenders will fail to cash their seven top tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: wasting no time this ensures the defeat|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh @S run, sorry,,,,, paying too much attention to @H :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or their 11|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed|pg||
nt|mariner1: I too have been up all day and night with Mike :)|pg||
nt|dburn: but perhaps South will conclude that West would have led a heart if he did not have the ace|pg||
pc|hK|nt|me argent: by south that is|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rogerclee: going for a penalty at the 3-level at this vulnerability cannot be the percentage action|pg||
nt|rogerclee: even if your LHO is joe grue ;)|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh!!|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure about the rest :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: more than  mere defeat6|pg||
nt|dburn: or perhaps he will not|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: 8@H big card if he gets to dummy, Q@C helps now|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: standard count|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sunsamvar: or 3+ controls|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if so - that is modification from original asking bids|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the rest must be cuebids|pg||
nt|pbundy: looks like an imp for china here|pg||
nt|askgaard: Signal for clubs apparently at trick 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: ignominous defeat |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|vugrapha3: they whispered something, couldn't hear ,sry|pg||
nt|robinswr: but at least he could have stripped the diamonds so the opponents would have to give up a trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North can't guess wrong in @D -- for me E would hold @DAQ or split honors and I wouldn't be able to guess right|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sunsamvar: he will find out as much as he can abt the E/W distribution before tackling @D..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer will give himself an extra chance in @C, but when Jack doesn't fall - @D from dummy then worry, then glee|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but u r right Al i will get it wrong too if the @D honours were split|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: 3 tricks to go - I think Jan might play on diamonds now|pg||
nt|redgrover: maybe you could argue that east is likely to have values outside spades, so a minor ace is best -- against that, there could be a spade ruff|pg||
nt|askgaard: Nice defense|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, East ought to cash that other spade soon|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: She will then look to play 2 rounds of trumps - ducking one round, and then playing the ace.  THEN she can play her good heart|pg||
nt|gowdy: the fall back is jx of clubs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk4: R5: England v Stansby and Lavazza v Shanghai Pudong|pg||
nt|lestergold: first 11 rather than failing to cash first seven david!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|frankaus: it is possible to view the results of all 24 piairs on a single board  - eg at http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=1&B=1&T=O|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mildredb: probably more than 1|pg||
nt|mildredb: not now :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: However, East will probably play a club here, hoping for a promotion|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West's @S8 is insufficient|pg||
nt|pbundy: 11 on top - no?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|santyclz: NEXT!|pg||
nt|mildredb: don't understnad not pitching @H|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mariner1: and making for imps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 9 of spades very confusing lead|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Although, now it's rather tricky for declarer|pg||
pc|sA|nt|santyclz: NEXT!|pg||
nt|woozle: West under pressure here...an overtrick is available unless he pitches the diamond ace|pg||
pc|c2|nt|woozle: Did Joe really claim 10?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Grue is entertaining to watch, he commentates on the hand during the play and provides lengthy post mortems|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he claimed 4 only after asking to look at McGann's hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||

mb|d|nt|mmmakela: 3 dias the winner here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i didnt see tom discard any winners|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mmmakela: no partscore hands lately|pg||
nt|jbgood: minor slam interest - not what S can handle|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: boye's hand poised over his bidding box|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4@h seems the place to be|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: nope|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so far these deals would be better fare for a Board-a-Match event|pg||
nt|mildredb: yes the 21 hcp slams are not usually bid|pg||
nt|woozle: 5S safe for EW, but how much bidding will Joe do with his 6/5?|pg||
nt|woozle: I assume that 2NT is some kind of good raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in a part score here|pg||
nt|askgaard: Every hand is suitable for a NT opening these days :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: but here the precision 1 nt may apply the brakes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs a 10 bagger to make this|pg||
nt|sac: Interesting 2nt What is the range supposed to be?|pg||
nt|shevek: I like 2N a lot|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jbgood: nice solution to the bid problem|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: brogeland just made a belated alert of 4@S and is talking in sigh language to west|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: *sign|pg||
nt|jbgood: no good supp in minors - still good in spades - interested if prd has a good minor suit|pg||
nt|imp_jan: interesting rebid: 2@c, some would rebid 1n|pg||
mb|d|nt|salokin: not needed :)|pg||
mb|r|nt|vugrapha3: was -5|pg||
nt|mariner1: will E pop 3@H now?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|imp_jan: i am not sure if 2@h is f...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Grue just said "Contract"|pg||
nt|woozle: Redouble won't turn West on particularly|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D is an interesting treatment here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: difficult to grasp this for a youngster as Espen Lindqvist..|pg||
nt|mittmouse: as long as 3c is not forcing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Surely yes|pg||
nt|salokin: 3@D I mean|pg||
nt|shevek: who cares abt range with that @c suit|pg||
mb|3C|nt|imp_jan: but here we are|pg||
nt|mildredb: nothing to the play on this hand|pg||
nt|woozle: Although I notice that 6S makes easily on a heart lead|pg||
nt|gowdy: easily is an overbid :0|pg||
nt|askgaard: Don't know the range, but probably 20-21|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: six dias great contract but this time....|pg||
nt|jbgood: what did i know:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: May get a @c lead now.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: lindqvist looks like he knows what he,s doing|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: haha|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i understand all of the PASSes|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i guess u cant stop short of 3nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well maybe not, but this duck makes no sense|pg||
nt|mariner1: the youth needs some swing boards there way........|pg||
nt|fabsayc: italian mexican :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: where are they going to play?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mmmakela: now a danger|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not to cash out I mean|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They need to get their tricks fast or lose them|pg||
nt|salokin: S will proably duck the lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes - on bidding unlikely that EW have a 4-4 @S fit|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he knows it's his turn :)|pg||
nt|askgaard: Here it made things simple|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Should it not make?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the open room Kit Woolsey says that the percentage play in diamond is low to the 9 spot|pg||
nt|jbgood: not only what he is doing - but what he and prd are doing together:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: even more important|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not many losers ... but are there 10 winners?|pg||
nt|pbundy: yep|pg||
nt|me argent: carefull defence should nip 4@Ss if EW get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela:  6 dias might, at least dbld it will|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: - Running Scores refresh as needed|pg||
nt|me argent: @HJ would b a good start|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the blackwood defense would have worked great, cash all your aces|pg||
nt|woozle: not hard to place the hearts on the auction|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Grue: "I cant blame you"|pg||
nt|woozle: win the heart, two spades ending in dummy, heart up...if ducked, another spade across and another heart up|pg||
nt|askgaard: Had N shown a gameforce singlesuiter (@c) they might have gone overboard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt looks like a scramble bid|pg||
nt|dburn: he may not get the chance|pg||
nt|mariner1: I thought 3 @H, maybe not|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|me argent: @C9|pg||
nt|dburn: but he may not need it|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is an ugly looking spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes not a lot of winners|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hard to analyze, i will guess 2 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: why 4/3 fit insted of 6/2 fit |pg||
nt|dburn: doubtless South intended this sequence to show three diamonds and five or six hearts|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mmmakela: of course no dbl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kit: the reason I think low to 9 is right play in slam is that it will be tough for East to duck from King-doubleton|pg||
nt|me argent: or 6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: one objective of the treatment is to rightside contracts|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: so if 9 loses to jack, I would then take finesse on way back|pg||
nt|santyclz: Isn't the normal play leading the 9 from dmy?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so not pecentage play but best play?|pg||
nt|rogerclee: even if yeh knew his partner had a doubleton diamond, ducking seems wrong|pg||
nt|mwigor: indeed that happened in the other room and they are playing 5@c|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: overtake and play @D to show @S reentry|pg||
nt|shevek: if north opens a @c EW might finet their @s fit...|pg||
nt|mwigor: 1@c 1@h (X) 3@c (4@s) 5@c|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: players taking a short break now|pg||
nt|shevek: Very clever bid .. and got the lead she deserved! (from a spec)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We will not necessarily continue with the same matches on vugraph in the second half. Organisers will decide when they see all first half scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: From the upper bracket: Yeh vs Sweden 8-1 after 5 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Unfortunately we have no running scores from other matches at this point|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are working on it|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: players back now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|imp_jan: sure|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jbgood: bye all - enjoy the show from Down Under:) |pg||
nt|marlowepi: what was the double of 3D? would 3H be invitational?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: suitplay says low to 9 and if it loses to J, cash A|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok believe, dbl finesse close 2nd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: East should know not to duck any @C|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|redgrover: a couple of hours ago the youth were dreaming of a spot in the top bracket, how quickly things change|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mittmouse: if he cashes his hearts he wins the board or 3 imps|pg||
nt|gowdy: and so it shall be|pg||
nt|me argent: good start for NA|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kit: suitplay thinks that East will always duck from Kx -- in real life, that ain't so|pg||
nt|santyclz: Bye Jon, thanks.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it is more common to play that dbl would be an invitation and 3H purely competitive|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Grue discussing with dummy now, quietly, that this contract is cold|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Cheek didnt play a card but McGann claimed|pg||
nt|redgrover: still a 5-VP buffer at the moment though|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 1 down|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 now|pg||
nt|dburn: but North may have interpreted 2NT followed by 3@d as a "bad 3@d bid" wheres a direct 3@d would have been a "good 3@d bid"|pg||
pc|h7|nt|santyclz: Normal play in 7 is the Q from dmy.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So there is a psychological factor to be considered too|pg||
nt|lestergold: david obviously doesnt believe that there are 6 hearts in the south hand!|pg||
nt|dburn: I know how many hearts South has|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: scores finally up http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=3&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is another david around |pg||
nt|dburn: but you asked why 3@d instead of 3@h, and I am trying to tell you|pg||
nt|lestergold: the one who is sitting in theeast seat|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh crossed wires david|pg||
pc|c5|nt|imp_jan: in the crossruff|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=3&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: refresh often|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gib says diamond 2 for down 3 now, fascinating|pg||
nt|dburn: and don't believe the results anyway|pg||
nt|mariner1: scoreboard has scores different from ours|pg||
pc|d2|nt|robinswr: this time he's runing the diamonds|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|imp_jan: cash diamonds first of course (just happened)|pg||
nt|me argent: should be tough 2 make from here|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to hold Qx Jxx @S to no losers|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Stansby got to set up @D's for @C pitches other room it seems|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mariner1: official score is not up to the minute and youth are in big trouble|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the scoreboard believes that on board 3 England gained 500 on a board where they in fact lost 500|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bravo|pg||
nt|lestergold: welyes he has consultedf gib!|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: diamonds can blind foes like no other suit|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: so -500 does lose imps, but it should have been a push|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mariner1: whats GIB?|pg||
mc|10|nt|lestergold: tom must have a reason for not following david 's defence but i cannot see what that reason is|pg||

nt|ahollan1: did i miss something?  maybe @SJ was NOT discarded|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6 was dual part score swing so 6 more imps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: -1 probably|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: room has been told a little behind the over rate |pg||
mb|p!|nt|santyclz: Speaking of @ds...|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i think it is practical to just transfer to 3c opposite a 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 boards to go in this match|pg||
mb|1D|nt|santyclz: Wild match, 7 imps in 7 boards.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: especially if transfer is 2@S so opener can show/deny @C support|pg||
nt|woozle: NS can make 3C, EW might make 2H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that's a big 13 bad def other room good here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H on the Moysian played well in Open|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: Not many deals to stir the blood on this set|pg||
nt|pbundy: perhaps they play varying NT ranges with either seat and/or vulnerability|pg||
nt|woozle: 1C opening probably ends any thoughts of NS playing clubs|pg||
nt|redgrover: one team that is in serious trouble is italy-lavazza, needing 43 VPs from this match|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D off in Open was good defense|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: it is always annoying to have more points crammed into two suits that total 3 cards than in the ten cards of the other two suits. but W will cope with the disappointment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ah -- confirmation that @SJ did win a trick -- not discarded|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What's the rebid here?|pg||
nt|gowdy: and Mec went domn in 6 @S  whata swing  on 25|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=10&T=I|pg||
nt|mariner1: live results (almost up to date)|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: shaken not stirred|pg||
mb|3H|nt|frankaus: today is not the day to bid 7@D - so far :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: When this gets passed out, South will be aghast|pg||
nt|mmmakela: check the 109's in N hand|pg||
nt|askgaard: Some might be tempted to invite game opposite the 15-17NT|pg||
mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: that reopening double puzzles me|pg||
nt|robinswr: not sure why hampson reopened with a double|pg||
nt|robinswr: it is a takeout double but when does he expect to make a game|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: an imp here for aussie youth if this makes|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S sure seems easier|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 3@S not the spot|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3 will be a breeze and more out|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like it takes a @H lead to beat 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: And indeed, 3NT makes easily on this layout|pg||
nt|mariner1: 43 VP not possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5d needs a heart lead to defeat it surely|pg||
mb|3N|nt|imp_jan: what else could south bid over the 1@h response?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@D is a massive underbid ... but what alternative is there?  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: danger|pg||
nt|gowdy: down  got to get light in this room eh|pg||
nt|woozle: diamond lead leaves this with 6 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N transfer to @C?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: y |pg||
nt|redgrover: true, hence their being in serious trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: lead here helps|pg||
nt|mariner1: found 7, looking for 8 and 9 now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West will duck the first @h and some homework for declarer|pg||
nt|me argent: thats an impressive OR result 4 the stanbys|pg||
mb|d|nt|mcarroll: OR bid to 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: tom says lead a heart|pg||
nt|mariner1: might have been better to pass 3N|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe, but...|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk4: 10 tricks was impressive|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe a heart switch now|pg||
mb|p|nt|askgaard: But Versace is probably right that it isn't worth it with his bad distribution and soft values|pg||
nt|askgaard: Same evaluation in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes if n/s are warned off but it will be a heart lead whatever they play in now|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 3NT suggested, and it certainly has some merit|pg||
nt|salokin: OR ended up in 4@H when W after the same bids jumped to 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a game of chicken|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|santyclz: Nice shift.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wonder if 3S denied 5H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suspect you are right|pg||
nt|lestergold: very good judgement by n/s |pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: interesting choice of leads rather than @D for a look|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lol. west does not lead from @D ak and east leads from his q into a dangerous looking jtx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 4nt was not the tool here, aces not the issue|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a general invite of 5@S would be my choice|pg||
nt|mariner1: Youth currently tied with Australian Open for 15th|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: i guess that as long as bids like this double keep getting opps to do the wrong thing, NS will continue to make such bids|pg||
nt|rogerclee: if east showed exactly 4-4 in the majors i think west should not accept a slam try, he knows his hand is quite bad opposite a 44(32) slam try|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Pete is telling me good play by Stansby last hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: a good time to go chicken tho|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's complicated by the 3-card heart support.  How about a wacky 2NT?|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is the practical correct play|pg||
nt|mariner1: sorry was telling a kibber how to make 4@S|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: but it does make sense - if North held KJx and East AQ10 - then need extra entry for 2nd @H through|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seamon did indeed switched to a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk4: switch|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lebridgeur: 2 @s tricks  2@h tricks and a @d will do the job|pg||
nt|mariner1: N in 3N here in Open too, @D lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mildredb: 2 more rounds  to Q - top 8 teams Q, unless Yeh Bros not in top 8, then the top 7 + Yeh Bros. team|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Others might manufacture a jump shift.  2@S or 3@C, but that just postpones the crisis|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @SK to the ace, spade to the jack, @SQ and a heart|pg||
pc|h6|nt|woozle: 2H will be claimed soon|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the actual layout is one of the few where no spade loser possible|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: :)  Sunil I hadn't even noticed dummy's @D10  --  sorry partner, I couldn't get a count on DUMMY|pg||

nt|mariner1: in the other match Yeh 26  i Norge 13 after 10 so I Norge has halved the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: the same contract being played in both rooms well i never|pg||
pc|c4|nt|robinswr: 4spades is rkc|pg||
nt|redgrover: should be duplicated at the other table, this might come down to the last board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D was a phantom, but difficult to know|pg||
nt|sac: phanton save in open room|pg||
pc|cA|nt|imp_jan: i will suggest the hand for the bidding panel of my magazine (IMP)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was more than slam :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E bid according to the Lore of Total Tricks. The 2S raise was perhaps a bit adventurous at the colors. partner might easily end up bidding 4S to make and going down 500|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm told: he's been upgrading since he was 8. They say he missed his 1st slam at 16 :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 5 minutes of session time left|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a good one.  It's actually a version of what's called the Bridge World Nightmare Hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In the BWNH, you open 1@D on a strong hand, and partner responds in your 3-card major|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6 spades best?|pg||
nt|mildredb: at this point Yeh Bros stand 3 & China Long Ahu are tied for 8th|pg||
nt|gowdy: as we shall  see here 2@H is 54 10 hcp|pg||
nt|gowdy: better than passing it out !|pg||
nt|mariner1: same contract and the same way|pg||
pc|dA|nt|woozle: McGann might have thrown this one in, for all the right reasons|pg||
pc|d2|nt|frankaus: nice treatment here 2NT ask for short suit trial  - i expect|pg||
nt|imp_jan: meanwhile another bidding problem here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Over 2 decades, it's never been solved|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3n = good|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but how to reach it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6 looks good|pg||
nt|salokin: yep or 6N with the @HK in the leaders hand :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|robinswr: 4nt - 5nt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wow|pg||
nt|askgaard: Impossible not to bid 5@d here too with 5 card support|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|robinswr: i play that 5nt shows the spade king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know entire structure, but  something like  15 teams qualify + Yeh Bros, then 2 brackets and sort of a double elimination|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Difficult from here|pg||
nt|rogerclee: yeah, i disagree with 2@S, though it is a good strategy to raise aggressively over an opponent's negative double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: vulnerability is for grownups|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that strategy pays off best, though, when there are TWO unbid majors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as in 1D-2C-D-3C|pg||
nt|shevek: since quite a few specs asked, I'll explain the format:|pg||
nt|shevek: Top 16 go through to the 32-board knockout stage, with the top 8 getting a double shot|pg||
nt|shevek: The 48-board final is on Monday|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: N is looking for D ki8ng now|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffee hand folks well im off to make one|pg||
pc|d9|nt|santyclz: A chance for Netherlands.|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect this will make|pg||
nt|redgrover: 3NT appears to be making on bd 8 at the other table, so the youth are still alive|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: just made   par for Ns again|pg||
pc|h6|nt|frankaus: mannopo finds the killing lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well that lead certainly gives declarer a chance to go down.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|gowdy: nice @s guess :)|pg||
nt|woozle: It was going to be guessed later anyway|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and credit Stansby for playing 4@S well too|pg||
nt|me argent: it should prove difficult for EW to get sufficent 50s to score well here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gowdy: and may come back if S thinks stiff Q|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: this could be interesting|pg||
pc|hT|nt|santyclz: No winning options.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our matches in round 2 in about half an hour are: China B vs Norway and USA Hampson (Meckwell) vs Chinese Taipei|pg||
nt|shevek: 1st stage was a 10 round delayed Swiss of 10-board matches|pg||
nt|askgaard: He knows he is dead. Just hoping for a heart endplay at the end.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a grosvenor|pg||
mc|10|nt|robinswr: in an IMP match one should discuss what bids mean|pg||
nt|mittmouse: are the italians really last wow|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I wonder at what point in the hand they realise "we wuz robbed"|pg||
pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: and Pass on this S hand is really surprising|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: we are now in the grace period|pg||
nt|imp_jan: here 4@h is the place to be|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with a really bad hand and a fit, the best policy is often to keep quiet, lest you allow an opp to diagnose shortness in your suit in his pd's hand|pg||
nt|mildredb: always bad to go back dn in a cold game|pg||
nt|pbundy: for sure, mildred!|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set|pg||
nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 31 unanswered imps....... is a change in direction for the match|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: brilliant effort NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and no the last of this set -- but one more set of 10 to follow in about 25 minutes|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: last of this set now... will the chinese get on the board|pg||
mb|1H|nt|imp_jan: btw i am very curious what is (not) going on the o r|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Final hand of the match, and many thanks to our excellent operator Dave Thompson|pg||
nt|imp_jan: no results so far|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well Boye had 20 and pd opened, so maybe 1 more move....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree totally|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@S has play here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: that doesn;t happen to me too often :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: last board - more to come, Specs, so stay around for the next Qing rounds|pg||
nt|woozle: Probably a NT partial for NS|pg||

nt|bjacobs: And thanks Jan for joining me in the commentary box|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wc and vice versa|pg||
nt|salokin: meckwell found an artificial way to 6@S they found the 6-2 @S fit early and could cuebid to investigate slam|pg||
nt|pbundy: i'm assuming this shows the minors :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure you could bid that over 5@C|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk4: Thanks to Mr. Yeh for his generous sponsorship|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Finally, our appreciation to the Queensland Bridge Association and Australian Bridge Federation for allowing us to broadcast from this prestigious event. Therese Tully, David Stern ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Patrick Huang have been instrumental in making all this possible|pg||

nt|mariner1: NS might not get in the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: This is the last bd of this segment.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW card says they almost always open 1@D when 4@D & 4@C|pg||

nt|mariner1: Our appreciation to Mr Yeh, the generous sponsor, to the Queensland Bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: Association and Australian Bridge Federation for allowing us to broadcast from this|pg||
nt|mariner1: prestigious event. Therese Tully, David Stern, and Patrick Huang have been|pg||
nt|mariner1: instrumental in making all this possible.|pg||

nt|mariner1: Last but not least, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Sharon Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no|pg||
nt|mariner1: broadcasts. Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: lovers worldwide!|pg||
nt|mariner1: also many thanks to the specs for their tips and comments which really do help!|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S also in Open on 9|pg||
nt|redgrover: i hope andy isn't thinking about passing this...|pg||
nt|mariner1: can they bid 6@C?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I am afraid  h e  might but  4@h might make !   as 6 @c|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: andy making morse code signals on his head|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Youth are back into 14th with 2 boards to score!|pg||
nt|redgrover: the 4@H doesn't exactly improve his hand|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I must admit it is difficult to find acll with west hand after 4 @d|pg||
nt|mariner1: Yeh is 16th so that does not help as there are now only 15 spots|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it's always a bit dodgey cueing shortage in partner's suit|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: * find a call|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: right dave|pg||
nt|redgrover: this will be one of the most important bids andy has had to make, a lot of pressure here|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open  1@H - P - 1N - 2@C - P - 2@S so far|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: the team coming 17th hasnt scored up this board yet either|pg||
nt|othered1: everyone seems to have their own structure over an inverted raise.  Not sure what their's is.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation to the Queensland Bridge Association and Australian Bridge Federation for allowing us to broadcast from this prestigious event. Therese Tully, David Stern ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and Patrick Huang have been instrumental in making all this possible.  And Mr Yeh of course.|pg||
nt|mildredb: looks that way|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: the overcall  makes the differnce|pg||
nt|askgaard: Me neither.|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: 3n was in danger after the (unlikely) diamond lead|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but always made|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You'd think North would unleash a 5-card major probe, if South tends to open with a 6-card major :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The play is awkward for South.  He HAS to win a spade in dummy to take the heart finesse.  So what spade does he insert here?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: declarers problem is that if east comes in with @hk he might get diamonds through|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am dazzling the kibitzers here with my analysis|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open  1@H - P - 1N - 2@C - P - 2@S - P - 5@C P - 6@C in Open!|pg||
nt|askgaard: Time to stop now...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 9 imps back|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 9 imps or so back to I/C|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S certainly has play here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 6@D can make|pg||
nt|frankaus: wd nic - roland, markku, Joe kibs tu 4 ur company |pg||
nt|santyclz: Last chance for Netherlands this set.|pg||
nt|woozle: Might make 3|pg||
nt|redgrover: the chinese in 17th place have drifted down, so there is more breathing space now -- as long as the irish pair doesn't bid 6@C|pg||
nt|mwigor: which they have|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: may be   he gets it right     but @d is the best lead by far|pg||
nt|redgrover: darn|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|nickf: next matches Japan vs China HubeiDongFeng and Australian Selected vs Global|pg||
nt|me argent: now 10imps for EW|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yeh2009: And a great team of helpers and volunteers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Also, do you lead the @H10 from dummy or low?  It's not trivial|pg||
nt|othered1: Chip Martel advises: 2H is 15+ GF, asking, 2N is 12+ notrumpy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mildredb: the Spec have been very quiet tonight :)|pg||
nt|askgaard: Ok, so a sensible auction, I think|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: guess 6 dias is makeable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not even bad enough to be a Roland slam.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Great slam|pg||
nt|yeh2009: Spade lead allows you to make 9 trums and a trump lead allows for ruffing heart finesse|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: This is the last bd of this match.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: most partnerships i know would not be able to get to this comfortable 2C contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1nt was pretty comfortable also|pg||
nt|mariner1: only a 1 VP edge,,,, so................|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk4: If only the Dutch could have avoided the 7-level, they would have had a fine match|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well he takes his 75 % chance|pg||
nt|salokin: another slamish hand 12 tricks on 2 of 3 finesses ... except a bad @H break|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lebridgeur: well that will cost a lot to australian young tema      NS  played perfectly as Hanlan and Mc Gann ireland in OR|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: 7@D down twice |pg||
pc|c3|nt|imp_jan: @hk left or ace of diamonds rigth|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fair enough|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was just so messy to take the heart finesse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, he's still only got 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So the whole hand is messier than my son's bedroom.  And that's saying something|pg||
nt|imp_jan: lol|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but decl is still in control due to the fav lay out|pg||
nt|imp_jan: ah england took over|pg||
nt|imp_jan: north did bid 3n after 1d-1h-3d on brd 18|pg||
nt|imp_jan: have to leave you now (heading for the dentist, no no the coup, but the real stuff i am afraid), cu soon|pg||
nt|pbundy: in shock after 2@DX earlier on.........  that was a spectacular hand|pg||
nt|pbundy: 16 imp swings not terrifically common|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry play went too quickly for me :S|pg||
nt|mildredb: np, Fiona - you've done a great job tonight - thank you!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pbundy: yes; for sure Fiona!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: :) thanks|pg||
nt|mildredb: Bye - come back for next sets|pg||
nt|pbundy: bye all - thanks, mildred!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: norway now in 17th and like to win at least a game swing on this board as their opps stopped in 3@C|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C asking for @D back|pg||
nt|lestergold: in spite of the high card majority in the e/w hands not clear what they would have pl;ayed in if they had come into the auction|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear that it does - a diamond to the ace and @cQ ruffed may be enough for the defence|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|santyclz: Thanks to my excellent fellow commentators, Marshall and Steve.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: the unblocking in diamonds was not just showing off. N has organized the play so that E would have to make 2 discards while seeing only one card from E|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to the Yeh brothers for organizing this trny and bbo for providing us the platform on which to view it.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: enjoy :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I do not undersatnd East line of play shortening in hand when he suffers from trump length|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kit Woolsey from USA|pg||
nt|kit: hi all|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Kit!|pg||
nt|sac: hi Kit|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: in the second half we will switch to Norway v Bridge i Norge  and Australia Selected v Netherlands|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: true enough. in most partnerships i know, though, W would not pass 1NT|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s3|nt|mittmouse: y definitely if 1 club denies 4d in a balanced hand it makes your checkback sequences easier|pg||

nt|hedyg: same here, claim :)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think there is something to be said for 2D in response to 2C. it gives S a chance to make 2 natural rebids, and if you end of bidding diamonds twice naturally, that will take you ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: past 3NT and so S will have a pretty good idea of your strength|pg||

nt|mariner1: so an interesting push|pg||
nt|lestergold: how many boards to go not a lot in it at present|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, there are six more in this segment|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S play better than 1N here NS|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dburn: and sixteen in the next|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S NS play better I meant than 1N EW|pg||
mb|2C|an|!H!S|nt|askgaard: Very close match. The players have mostly taken similar actions in the two rooms so far.|pg||
mb|p|nt|askgaard: Hi Kit|pg||
nt|mariner1: not a lot makes now NS (nada)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S as in Open reasonable spot|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S much better than 2nt however|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south hand has potential in poker|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would not consider passing 1N with N hand|pg||
mb|2D|an|chose|mb|d|nt|askgaard: Lauria has never been shy to overcall on very minimal values|pg||
nt|kit: likely to get to 3NT one way or another|pg||
nt|kit: probably 3@C by North, 3NT by South|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: light 2@C, only the void makes it attractive|pg||
mb|p|nt|askgaard: Versace knows their style of course, so he won't hang him|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c may be for the majors, and 2@d may be the prelude to a game try in spades|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mariner1: yes however the void is there|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: and  for garbage stayman|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w have the high card points but n/s have better prosects in their spade fit that e/w in their dim fit|pg||
mb|4S|nt|me argent: but i think JC chose the correct route|pg||
mb|p|nt|sac: maybe 3 hearts is a better call now than 3nt|pg||
nt|kit: they didn't exactly right-side this, but difficult to do when hearts, not diamonds, is the worry suit|pg||
nt|askgaard: Trying to get partner to bid 3NT on @hQx, Søren?|pg||
nt|kit: problem with bidding 3@H is that if pard has nothing in hearts she won't bid 3NT, and 3NT is gone forever|pg||
nt|sac: yes|pg||
nt|sac: not after 3 spades which should be waiting|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: live scoring is now up on the website|pg||
nt|kit: why should it be waiting when partner has bid spades?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R  for running scores in all matches|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yikes|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S has a tough road though|pg||
nt|dburn: and North, with all those extra values...|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 4s looks a bit too much work to do|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: S needed to pay attention to the 1N behind him|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kit: Versace decided a heart lead would be futile, so he led a diamond hoping his partner had 5 of them I guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: three diamond leads will promote a trump trick|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes S has a good high/low split pot hand|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: well establishing the heart suit is one thing- enjoying it may be another thing|pg||
nt|mariner1: Fudd's Law teaches position is everything :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: tom needs to continue punching dummy with diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i thought location was everything, but maybe that no longer applies|pg||
nt|dburn: it was perfectly normal for South, with kings in both his partner's suits, to issue a game invitation|pg||
nt|mariner1: Push something hard enough and it will fall over. - Sir Sidney Fudd's First Law of|pg||
nt|mariner1: Opposition|pg||
pc|d5|nt|askgaard: It was not realistic to find partner with a good enough suit AND and entry to the hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: newton thought of it first|pg||
nt|dburn: it was close to ridiculous for North to accept it, but in these recessionary times one bids game on every hand and hopes that there will be a play for it|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep this must be the winning defence|pg||

mb|d|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: david using the power of the boss suit to create as much havoc as possible at favourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|dburn: what?|pg||
nt|po-s: I wonder  - if North´s double was penalty what is he supposed to bid now when South passed 2S?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike's David is East|pg||
nt|imp_jan: north may try 2nt..|pg||
nt|imp_jan: or dbl or pass...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do not think david would be bidding on his tram tickets at any other vulnerability|pg||
nt|dburn: he bid spades because he had them, and he bid them again because he still had them|pg||
nt|imp_jan: did 1n promised 3@s?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all doubles after penalty double should be penalty (somebody's law)|pg||
nt|dburn: yes|pg||
nt|po-s: and he had nothing else either|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: are Ew in a forcing auction?|pg||

nt|mariner1: this will require help :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: possible 3 trumps 2 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|sac: no|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am pretty confident that Versace's pass is forcing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that may help|pg||
nt|fabsayc: very scarey|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another unreadable lead|pg||
nt|me argent: dangerous lead 4 the defence|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike your son bids what he has :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: this illustrates the problems with doubling an opening 1NT with a distributional hand -- you don't know what to do after that.|pg||
mb|p|nt|askgaard: Right|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: not that it will do him a power of good - surely even Brink will pass this double|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this could be interesting|pg||
nt|lestergold: disaster for england in open room so this looks like a fair sized swing to the dutch|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|askgaard: If they play takeout'ish doubles, east might have doubled because of the vulnerability|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|kit: He might -- but he knows his partner will be expecting a second diamond|pg||
nt|imp_jan: after the lead, will north work out that south had a stiff heart?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can beat this two, but probably wont|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S play means a lot here|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|kit: and for all he knows they have a 9-card heart fit|pg||
nt|mariner1: will cash out for off 1 now.......... or should|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: while versace was thinking what card to play North sort of claimed down 1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1 IMP difference between setting it one or two tricks. 12-13|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|askgaard: yes. If both players are overreaching to penalize it will sometimes be disastrous|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Versace said "I never seen in my life", I think referring to the lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 boards, 11 imps, still close|pg||
nt|imp_jan: next brd seems good for england|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: mind you, this line of defence...|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|askgaard: A lot of work to do here.|pg||
nt|kit: even on actual hand, if East had doubled is it so clear for West to pass?  Why couldn't East's hearts and spades have been reversed?|pg||
nt|sac: you got a point Kit|pg||
nt|kit: Can he handle this -- 1 club trick, 1 spade trick, 2 diamond tricks, so he needs 6 trump tricks|pg||
nt|askgaard: Vul vs Not it would be automatic to pass a takeout double in west (although it work badly of course)|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: I believe a spade to king was necessary there|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: Yes, JoAnna could have pitched a club|pg||
nt|kit: joanna did well to pitch a spade it seems to me|pg||
nt|kit: But if he had led a spade, North can win, play ace and a heart, and declarer is a trick short|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But a diamond ruff now will see him home|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Because North must follow to the next club too|pg||
nt|sac: he is home now if he plays diamond and then ruff clubs|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's why a club pitch had been better before|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then JoAnna could have overruffed the last club|pg||
nt|kit: will overruffing the last club defeat the contract?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, then exit in trump and declarer must lose 2 spades|pg||
nt|kit: but can play a spade after second club ruff I believe|pg||
nt|sac: if you guess hearts you coul make 4 hearts by playing a spade from dummy instead of a diamond|pg||
nt|sac: early on|pg||
nt|kit: so I think declarer can succeed -- if North pitches a spade, do what he is doing.  If North pitches a club, then ruff another club and play a spade up?|pg||
nt|askgaard: I agree with 10 tricks no matter what, if declarer guesses the position|pg||

nt|cindy: 2S is ewww|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: this S hand also met S's rerquirements for an opening bid. we are zeroing in on the threshold|pg||

nt|mariner1: @c lead to beat 6@D|pg||
nt|patricck: finessing for 10@D after South dropped the Q@D on 2nd round|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open was off 1 in 3N and got a @D lead|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Looks like declarer will just have to hope that both red suit finesses are on -- I don't see anything else|pg||

nt|me argent: @H lead beats it also|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: hm it looks like the favourabkle dim position should mean 9 tricks available|pg||
nt|patricck: actually was @D lead, but play could go as suggested on a different lead as well|pg||
nt|dburn: what favourable diamond position?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south off to the best lead for teh defence|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||

nt|mariner1: E playing 3N in Open|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @H was led in Open|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: tom will be forced to play for the only position which makes namely the dim position|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a kelsey twist, will likely make on this more normal lead|pg||
nt|dburn: again - what diamond position?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|mariner1: win this in hand , lead @H|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3/3 break with q onside|pg||
nt|imp_jan: south inserted the queen, though double dummy the ten was better..|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|kit: I thing he should have led jack of clubs from hand -- the way he played it, he might have had entry problems to dummy if North had A9xx of clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: no he will run @D 1st it seems|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, I know, but after you have led to the jack and cashed the king on which South plays the queen - what diamond position?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: still dummy is squeezed a little|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: the 4th @c squeezes S too,,,,,, even with a @S pitch|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: now heart|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly at this level you should play to drop the ten, but...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|imp_jan: declarer seems on track|pg||
nt|lestergold: tom doesnt want to ive up the chance of dropping heart ten|pg||
nt|mariner1: Townsend played another tough one earlier.....|pg||
nt|mariner1: board 3 was very difficult to make|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that the entries are a bit on the awkward side for West to find out in time that North has only two hearts|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 20 mins till end of this set|pg||
nt|patricck: Is there any possibility that boards will be withdrawn?  England would hate to lose board 16, they finished with a ripper|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the natural spade return is best|pg||
nt|lestergold: why is north contemplating anhything other than the spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a heart return he plays spade to king and diamond to jack|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: now must commit to the dim|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|askgaard: Maybe, not so important since north would have to lead a red suit anyway at the end then.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn: because he is wondering (correctly) whether a heart will create more or fewer communication problems|pg||
nt|imp_jan: on dk south shld play dq|pg||
nt|po-s: If he should return a heart declarer has time to discover that North has two hearts and might guess diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think he will guess them anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: should he really? well, there's a thing!|pg||
nt|mariner1: cash K@D and @SA then should have picture|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but not quickly|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@D nice pitch|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes q dim of cours automatic false card tho|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|kit: I guess that is true|pg||
nt|othered1: still has @H guess, knowing south has 2 left|pg||
nt|kit: odd cashing queen of diamonds -- now heart finesse, clearly percentage, goes down 2 if off|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cash the heart and spade, surely percentage then is drop|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|askgaard: But it is not wise to overthink these things I guess|pg||
nt|sac: people tends to falsecard with the ten from 10x so the nine could be a dobblefalsecard, Lauria knowing it is 109 or Q9|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Undo please|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: I suppose he might think that South with 109 doubleton could play the ten, whereas with Q9 doubleton he had no choice|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk4: but he knew that North started with five hearts and South with two, which is sufficient to override any restricted choice considerations|pg||
nt|imp_jan: same bidding as in the open room|pg||
