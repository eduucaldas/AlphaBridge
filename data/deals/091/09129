nt|lestergold: a thinish 4 spades availble here for N/S|pg||
nt|stewball: lots of chances|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard work with the r4/1 break|pg||
nt|dburn: sporting weak two bid at the other table, but North-South dealt with it easily enough|pg||
nt|drg: KQ@H doubleton helps a bit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C a fine spot although 3NT also makes on this layout|pg||
nt|jwit: I have never played bridge with Fredin, but did have the pleasure of playing golf with him.  For somebody who doesn't get out on the golf course very often, he is a terrific ...|pg||
nt|jwit: golfer.|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure seems like 4@H has play here......|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: 2@S was a brave move by Ólafur in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: should be worth a few imps to e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c or indeed 3N on for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: those heart pips in fredin's hand work quite hard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The N-S heart spots are just good enough to stop the suit|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps one should open 2@S instead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Like here|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially with a passed partner|pg||
mb|3S|nt|robbg: This 1@s overcall I don't understand at all! (I like the other one better!)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: however maybe 2@s would show a 2suiter in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: was 2nd best     suppose they play attitude|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 3NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: North will make sure they get to 4@H (at least) now.|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|jwit: This could be a nice swing for NS.  Heart to 10 now and will do quite well.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jwit: Although he isn't crazy about his spade holding on the auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: declarer finessed for the Q@H in Closed and went off|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Oh my|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     can make 9 tricks in spades  with fortunate lie of the black soft cards|pg||
nt|thegarve: If the hand was pure - opening 2@s is not a good idea -  2@S is ideal here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What does 2NT show since Ingimundur drove all the way to game|pg||
nt|drg: may well need to guess clubs if west can hold up the ace on the first round|pg||
nt|robbg: The 1@s overcall might have that effect.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: very optimistic by east on those values|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2NT would have been down too |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It most likely would|pg||
nt|hedyg: no direct entry to dummy for any finesse|pg||
nt|ady: I cant see that is a reason for east to bid  anything|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has played before that man|pg||
nt|dburn: here, though, North has done pretty well to respond to 1NT at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: superfially only three losers but ten winners are not that obvious|pg||
nt|stewball: i dont think its 100% to bid with that N hand n/v|pg||
nt|daman: Jon would have bid 3NT     Bob Hamman as well|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers suggesting 3N|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is not unreasonable when there is at least a three-card difference in the spade length.|pg||
nt|jwit: Kendrick can't afford to duck this.  He needs to give declarer an entry to dummy.|pg||
nt|jwit: Entry to hand I meant|pg||
nt|robbg: Won't be useful unless he wins and switches, unless Schifko is partial to a 1st round finesse.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree i tend to pass a 15-17 nt with a poor 8 count|pg||
nt|lestergold: trump lead best here|pg||
nt|drg: reasonable to take a call holding spades and a couple of tens|pg||
pc|h5|nt|brgpro: 5@h was lucky to make because the @h10 drops doubleton|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you know tarzan this can be fun but there are not many (rob helle for example does)|pg||
nt|brgpro: and, @dA was with doubleton|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - to make 5 @H need Ax in @D and 10x in @H|pg||
nt|brgpro: Axx was ok with 3 trumps, but the doubleton must be 10x|pg||
nt|bobholl: they will reach 4@H i 'm sure|pg||
nt|bridge_one: or Axx in @D with xxx in @H in the same hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: of cours in practice 3N makes ten tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: @SQ at trick 1 was obviously the only realistic chance|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: the heart position is very friendly indeed |pg||
nt|lestergold: what?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, it's very unsual to pull from game to a partscore|pg||
nt|daman: really weird|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Fredin fearing three small hearts opposite I suppose|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt know that at this level you can come out of an undoubled game into a pat score|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bobholl: no 1 @C is 16+ 1@D 8-(i guess)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this kind of auction can do many IMP in long distance|pg||
nt|hedyg: are we sure 3@c is a stayman?|pg||
nt|daman: hard to believe that could happen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to David Burn|pg||
nt|dburn: hello|pg||
nt|daman: Hi David|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: what would he do if W did not have 4@Hs?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: might gain though as n/s +140     should only go down2|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Disa passed twice on the last board with 16 Miltons - she isn't the sort to pass four times running|pg||
nt|mariner1: pretty straight forward line needed...... and she is using it|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|dburn: the trouble is that, not knowing she can use a heart to pitch a diamond, she may try to establish a diamond to pitch a heart|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: I aassume would have had to go to 3NT   unless they had an arrangement that 3@C  was some soret of bail out of 2NT and west forgot|pg||
nt|jwit: Nevertheless by ducking, forced declarer to go right in trumps|pg||
nt|robbg: Schifko was less impressed with the 1@s overcall here.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jwit: So should be 5 imps to NS|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: oh not the most succesful shot|pg||
nt|dburn: ...she may play a low diamond to the eight|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not clear that West should simply play spades. He might perhaps have used the fact that he was on lead to play one of the minor suits through. Not that it would be productive.|pg||
nt|bobh1: the last 2 hands illustrate that 1n is the most difficult contract to defend|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|hedyg: that is why i think maybe 3@c was not a stayman, how can he go to 3NT with that hand?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: now she definitely needs the heart for the dim but another trump lead wont help her|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly not a ridiculous line, but unsuccessful on this occasion|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brgpro: yesssssssssssss. how is willam? what does he do nowadays?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|stewball: this hand is an example of why i tend to pass 1nt|pg||
nt|dburn: now it's hopeless - but credit to West for a good lead; many might have tried a heart instead|pg||
nt|lestergold: now does the club finesse get her out of trouble?|pg||
nt|drg: it doesnt with the ten blocking the suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications between the hands bad that pesky fourth trump is a thorn in the side|pg||
mc|7|nt|brgpro: oops|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: McGann just asked for a very quick break...|pg||
nt|xenya: we kick off with what might be an exciting hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: probably to go to the rest rooms...|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: so we have to wait for the moment|pg||
nt|xenya: EW have a slam available, but it's almost impossible to reach -- i think|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: welcome back|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sunsamvar: hi Rob|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: These teams are currently lying 3rd and 4th after 7 rounds|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: looks like the contact |pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe transfer now?|pg||
nt|mariner1: H plays better for NS than @S for EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks as if N/S can make 4h with the very favourable lie of cards but not likely to bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: so they will do well to get to game |pg||

nt|chick: and Jim :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello to co-co's|pg||
nt|mildredb: At the start of this match, India stands 1st & New Zealand stands 4/5|pg||
nt|mariner1: E setting a new Gold standard it seems :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well even if this goes off its a good score to make it david has to set up the Kc and use js as anentry to pitch a dim|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: It seems David made a golden bid with his jump overcall.|pg||
nt|mariner1: so England should score 1st here|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do you agree with his bid ?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wygbe1: i was just at the other match, same contract|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: n/s playing strong club, might have different bidding?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: hi all|pg||
nt|chick: this should be pretty easy make ... I thought they might get too high in 3N |pg||
nt|ahalim: difficult for EW to enter the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: mandatory|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gracelin: I might double 3D with the north hand if partner can read it as take-out|pg||
nt|kyosuke326: 3 @D -1 seems a fair result for both side|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can play diamonds for one, and clubs for two losers, so most likely 1 off|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you sure this is beatable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
nt|gracelin: not if north never get in to play a spade through|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we shall see, north has no entry and clubs split|pg||
nt|by: I think the 4th club can be cut off|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a normal lead that doesn't help the defense at all -- so goes bridge|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1 off looks likely|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i thought the hand was too strong for a weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S is fine with me with a passed partner and both o's in the auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is on tyhe strong side but bidding in the trap between 2 opps bidding is not the same as a direct weak jump overcall|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wygbe1: that lead will help - declarer can make 4 even giving up two h tricks|pg||
nt|dinos1: 10 tricks with this lead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: But declarer can't do it all himself|pg||
nt|pbundy: even with the "wasted" king of hearts - favorable layout for e/w|pg||
nt|allanr44: Hello all, I was enjoying the wrong room   :)|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to David Beauchamp from Australia|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: its the top of the range but i dont think 1 spade does justice|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree with Mike (and son) :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: not much to the play here really -- woth the @SQ falling, it's 12 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: an easy start for Matt Mullamphy - 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gracelin: if declarer go up with DA and play a club, he has enough timing to enjoy the last club for a spade itch|pg||
nt|beauch: hi roland|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike it also causes distress to the opponents and you are not sure you want to bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3744  Erik Sælensminde (known as "Silla" among friends)|pg||
nt|bobh1: best defense beats both|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think the ten of diamonds was a better shot in that suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: i hope im not being a results merchant|pg||
nt|drg: certainly works with the K9 doubleton|pg||
nt|lestergold: Fredin needs to learn to upgrade the powerful 876 sequence!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When did you last see that, David? Pulling from 3NT (undoubled) to 4@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi David u up early for a Sunday|pg||
nt|jwit: EW got awfully high on this one in the closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Declarer can pick up the clubs without a ruff.|pg||
nt|ady: 4S  for n/s|pg||
nt|drg: since west cannot afford to cover|pg||
nt|dburn: somewhat vexing for West at the other table to discover that leading from KQ in his partner's weak two bid allowed the contract to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: multi 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: only a part score hand    but the other room did not think so|pg||
nt|thegarve: the weak two classically pushed the opens to stretch , first with 2NT then 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s or 1@c?|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, but EW have a good save at 5 diamonds even with the bad trump break|pg||
nt|mariner1: tartan showing 5M and 4+ minor less than opening count|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thats one ofthe penalties of bidding with garbage|pg||
nt|stewball: sometimes called suicide 2 bids|pg||
nt|lestergold: the trump attack here was excellent|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that the heart game was made at every table but 1.|pg||
nt|jwit: I would pass over 1NT with the West hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: it is a style issue|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed it is|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D  a save for e/w|pg||
nt|brolucius: But he does not know that, so if the defenders cash their hearts (which they will) he may begin with two rounds of trumps followed by two rounds of clubs.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Muiderberg is very similar to Tartan|pg||
nt|mariner1: 17opposite a weak 8 here.....|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lestergold: without itmost linbes would have suceeded|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://icelandairopen.com/index.php?m=D3&id=M_OPENTEAMS2009&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2009  for leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: 2@D Multi, weak with one major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the garbage type|pg||
nt|bobh1: N has something in reserve for his 2@s bid|pg||
nt|dburn: didn't really see the auction - maybe it was supposed to be forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You saw the constructive weak 2 before|pg||
nt|drg: not much hope except for divining the spade position|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mariner1: I would too,,,, looks more like 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 1@S and all pass|pg||
nt|jwit: Rather aggressive 4D bid by South|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has nothing in reserve for his 4@D bid.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bridge_one: i don't agree the pass by south with 12 hcp and good figures|pg||
nt|robbg: A kibitzer asks why the duck at trick 1... It is often good technique to foil what declarer is trying to do. Here Schifko, basically known to hold Qx in @s was trying to force an ...|pg||
nt|robbg: entry to his hand, so Kendrick naturally (and unfortunately) refused to accomodate.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: nice swing for n/s here|pg||
nt|bobh1: can N stnd it?|pg||
nt|hedyg: not at all interested in A@D in pds hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has denied a heart control, on the face of it, so North should not advance.|pg||
nt|hedyg: and no 4@H bid|pg||
nt|jwit: If 4D was a stiff rather than a void, North has a powerhouse of a hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: i thing maybe he should have bid 2n or something to show a 3-card limit raise to begin with|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: send my greetings to him|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: lol|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult when playing precision like with 13-15 NT|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would open the south hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: without an  impossible double dummy spade view this looks unmanageable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: now too high     |pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@C should show a @H stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The double of 4@D must encourage a sacrifice because he will be on lead himself|pg||
nt|bobh1: altho 4 by 3 his hand is prime|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to blame North, though, with that massive hand (for a single raise) opposite a slam try. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 4@D overbid caused this|pg||
nt|bobh1: i blame him for making only a single raise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't|pg||
nt|ady: I think 4@D  looking for a slam optimistic  opposite a 2@S raise|pg||
nt|jwit: I agree David, especially if 4D was a singleton.  Obviously, not nearly as good opposite a void|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@C?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I blame 4@D, that is a wild overbid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes|pg||
nt|jwit: Agree totally Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The auction is in MOVIE|pg||
nt|robbg: This contract at least has a bit of play, but not on today's distribution.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: however they might hooks @S to make it........|pg||
nt|drg: can get 8 tricks for a push though|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: E had a chance to switch to @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: Fredin reasoning that S must have trumps and he has 3 tricks in hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: a hard work contract here|pg||
nt|dburn: I imagine it was intended as forcing, but it was a rather odd thing to do|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, an excellent double.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|brgpro: but they play 12-15NT, so he will have to open 1NT and he is lack of controls|pg||
nt|bridge_one: QJ9  Q9xx A10x QJ10   medium cards  in all suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can make such doubles only when the auction makes it clear that the other side have limited values. If West had rebid 4@S, you might be more circumspect.|pg||
nt|jwit: Best defense might beat this 3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brolucius: An awful sequence.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jwit: Good point David|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|hedyg: so did W.........|pg||
nt|hedyg: did he really duck the Q@H?|pg||
nt|jwit: From North's point of view, partner could easily have something like  AKJxxx  Ax x KQJx.  Surely that wouldn't be asking for too much for a 4D bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: much too much work to do with the hearts being established next time opps are in|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably get home by way of 4hearts two dims 2 clubs and a ruff in the short heart hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: however 2s was due for a few off|pg||
nt|daman: yes    should reel this one in|pg||
pc|c6|nt|drg: actually, a club up now and then diamonds|pg||
nt|drg: the minors lay very friendly|pg||
nt|dburn: this is cold, isn't it?|pg||
nt|drg: south can't afford to rise because of the Qx@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: another @S pressures S|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: this looks like a lucky position indeed|pg||
nt|drg: not cold anymore|pg||
nt|dburn: that may not have been best, though|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he finds it |pg||
nt|lestergold: but not much else to try|pg||
nt|drg: it was his only legit shot|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: How you can envisage slam with that hand opposite a single raise is simply unbelievable|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer needed to pitch a club and keep that diamond|pg||
pc|h8|nt|brgpro: this defence wont hurt|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|bobholl: claim for 3 made|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobh1: change N's heart and diamond holdings and you are getting there|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, 6@C was not the best. He must have said to himself: 'I denied a heart control, so partner must have one.' |pg||
nt|bobh1: good reasonin|pg||
nt|bobh1: g|pg||
nt|hedyg: imo 5@C MUST be @H control|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he didnt keep his dim|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jwit: Defense has extracted full juice here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: with*|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|lestergold: in practice two ruffs in the short trump hand and 3 trumps in the dummy|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobh1: as good as N's hand was he had a pass over 4@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is difficult for North, who presumably knows that his partner's bidding may not be classical.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it  wont make very often|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: if this makes 4 the DBL costs 2 imps,,, if set one it gains 1 imp... the payoff is -300|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mariner1: or -500 which are 5 and 7 imp gains|pg||
mc|11|nt|ady: south should just have bid 4@s   and reckon sometimes even that might be too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: so now off 2|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D would be Multi for EW, but probably 3@H opener|pg||
nt|beauch: a bit more action on this hand!|pg||
nt|flash: the 1@C call might have been a 2-card suit; the 1@D response was an xfer to @Hs|pg||
nt|mildredb: Welcome Jim Gordon :)  better known as Flash |pg||
nt|shevek: fair enough, we're catching up|pg||
nt|xenya: quick job|pg||
nt|allanr44: Plenty of opportunity for improvement for Lavazza|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have a 3n here now|pg||
nt|lestergold: must make life difficult for them when u are dealt the opportunity to do so|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: you mean he has another name?|pg||
mb|p|nt|beauch: presume south will bid 3Nt|pg||
nt|pbundy: :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: welcome flash|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: if NS reach 6S, they will probably make it with the lucky lie of cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting 2@H by N in the other room over double. Anyone know what that means?|pg||
nt|chick: EW have a partscore in @Hs, don't know if they can manage 10 tricks though|pg||
nt|chick: 5@C makes I think|pg||
nt|ahalim: from the east side|pg||
nt|chick: 5@D probably not|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and they will bid game this time|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: my notes don't say anything about Ron's 4@D bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: 1@s denied 4+@h, so N knew that EW has 10+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, same here|pg||
nt|by: 2@h in the other room means 3+@s, good hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade raise, can be unlimited|pg||
nt|beauch: Klingers 4d would likely be lead- directing- looks a little physic|pg||
nt|flash: looks familiar...|pg||
nt|pbundy: i wonder how many would upgrade the west hand with those tens? |pg||
nt|ahalim: not on a passive defence|pg||
nt|ahalim: 5@C from W goes down i think|pg||
nt|chick: on a heart lead?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kyosuke326: 2@H = Forcing @S I think|pg||
nt|wygbe1: looks normal to reach 4s, probably down - |pg||
nt|xenya: then declarer can draw just 2 rounds of trumps, retaining @C control, and work on @Hs|pg||
nt|chick: if they try, might pull a 4@S sac from NS|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but seems if you play transfer advances, you might want to show diamonds first|pg||
nt|by: i don't quite agree with 2@h here since partner does not promise 5@h, 2@c transfer to 2@d is better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: troublesome auction for South -- has he shown 1-suiter or tolerance for one of he pointed suits?|pg||
nt|allanr44: Well, there are 12 with the favourable Ds|pg||
nt|xenya: now this is a complex hand|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|lestergold: well they have plenty of assets|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open NS are in 3N here|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: sorry i mean partner does not promise 5@s|pg||
nt|by: i am thinking|pg||
nt|barbyh: hi all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nystrom reads 5@C it correctly - for this hand|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Mike with both opps bidding 2@s turned out to be a fine bid|pg||
mb|2D|nt|by: as east i might have ventured 5@h -- that would be unfortunate on this hand.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you don't need to :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi barbara|pg||
nt|sybarra: can blame N bidding 4 |pg||
nt|pbundy: on a good day, you'd make 4@H.  this is not, however, a good day.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: lose 2 aces and 2 trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good evening to Jon Sveindal from Norway|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: almost good nite here:)|pg||
nt|chick: 3N will make on a heart lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: Arifin:)|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Jon :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: How difficult is it to recruit new youngsters in Taiwan? It's a big problem in most places elsewhere|pg||
nt|flash: the 1@H call shows at least 3 @Hs (can be 4 if an unbalanced hand)|pg||
nt|shevek: results after 4 rounds at:  http://tinyurl.com/crxv5|pg||
nt|jbgood: and Cornelia:)|pg||
nt|ahalim: wonder what lead the double asks for ?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: i think DO NOT LEAD A HEART|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: rather difficult|pg||
nt|gracelin: the bridge clubs in high schools and colleges are importance sources for new comers|pg||
nt|allanr44: 7 or 8 tricks I'd expect|pg||
nt|shevek: no, it's not upside down :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: in NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mildredb: pesty singleton @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: 1@c - 1@h forced to game|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes.  but - possible that even without it, the 9 of hearts could come into play with a 4-1 break|pg||
nt|ahalim: an easy 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|chick: everyone seems to be playing it cautiously :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: cards are friendly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thoughtful @HK from Klinger -- IF partner held the !AH, then Ron retains lead in case shift is needed|pg||
nt|beauch: hi Barbara|pg||
nt|barbyh: hi beauch|pg||
nt|wygbe1: n did well to merely invite, unfortunately south liked his club fit and didnt know his heart cards were worthless|pg||
nt|ahalim: even on the Gold Coast it's still early :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: olanski undecided :)|pg||
nt|chick: yes, was just thinking about why ...|pg||
nt|chick: maybe trying to figure out if he should take the first or second club to give his partner a ruff|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: he is thinking at the moment....|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Round 7:  Yeh Bros v USA Hampson and India Venkatesh v India National|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: duck here gives Bertheau guess on next round of trump|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mildredb: unlikely as most likely @H will be led from declarer's hand|pg||
nt|flash: since declarer is about to be in his own hand, seems reasonable to start trumps by leading small toward dummy?|pg||
nt|xenya: N may have regretted overcalling, but shouldn't he pass like a man? |pg||
nt|allanr44: yes |pg||
nt|xenya: frankly, i don't know|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: now Cayne is in the tank|pg||
nt|ahalim: they right-sided the contract|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was 2@C forcing to game ?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wygbe1: oh the auction was already gf?|pg||
nt|dinos1: honors in short suits - hand shd be downgrade|pg||
nt|chick: and got the helpful heart lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: its probably a relay|pg||
pc|s7|nt|beauch: yes 5@C will come home as cards friendly|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|gracelin: believe BY and his collegue JMChen are doing a great job in this area|pg||
nt|lestergold: why would one force to game with 18 points and asingleton in partners response i suspect that 2n was invitational|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: just a mess of a hand really |pg||
nt|flash: board 21 in as a push|pg||
nt|flash: these are 10-board matches, scored at IMPs, converted to VPs|pg||
nt|mildredb: N best not try to be crafty & unlead the @CA|pg||
nt|flash: top 8 teams qualify (top 7 if the Yeh Bros team isn't in the top 8)|pg||
nt|pbundy: very true, mildred!|pg||
nt|chick: might actually make this|pg||
nt|jbgood: yeh:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: winning @CA -- now only choice is to drop play @CK which drops J|pg||
nt|wygbe1: true - |pg||
nt|mildredb: oops|pg||
nt|pbundy: oh mildred; you called it!|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d4|nt|flash: 10 rounds of swiss qualifying; the first 2 matches were pre-determined by drawing for positions; from here on, the pairing will be swiss (closest scores) with a 1-round lag|pg||
pc|d3|nt|flash: an unusual scissors coup|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|xenya: in any case, 4@D looks a bit desparate to me |pg||
pc|h3|nt|flash: named because it cuts the communication between the hands...   |pg||
nt|flash: in this case, North might be denied access to anything but dull scissors for a bit...|pg||
nt|lestergold: finally south finds his 9th trick!|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 11 in the open room....England can score again|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes overtricks look unlikely|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: anybody like this line of play|pg||
nt|by: w is almost guaranteed length in @c, so it is almost a sure make|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed, but 3N is perfectly normal here of course|pg||
nt|xenya: or 4N -- as here|pg||
nt|allanr44: of course|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: i.e.  i don't like Matt's play of @CA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|chick: N should make a note to discuss doubles of 3N with his partner |pg||
nt|ahalim: to be fair - wd S lead a @S vs 3NT ? (w/o the dbl)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pbundy: not n/s's finest hour here|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d7|nt|barbyh: one of 2 things must happen club jack drop or diamond q onside|pg||
nt|lestergold: lookiong for another in dims but to no avail|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: Now N will try to get pard to give him the ruff|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: david wioll get off lead with j c|pg||

pc|c3|pc|h2|pg||

nt|bobh1: he has to . . . otherwise cue-bidding serves no purpose|pg||
nt|jwit: I don't blame North for bidding over 4S.  There are just too many hands partner could have for a 4D bid, that slam will be cold|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if he can bid 4@D with that hand, he might also bypass a heart cue next because he overbid|pg||
nt|brolucius: The correct way to play the clubs is king and then the ace, exposing the need for a finesse when West has a singleton honour.|pg||
mb|p|nt|drg: E/W seem to have overbid a bit in the other room here|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North had been too unaware to find the double, it would have been only 2 IMPs.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|stewball: lots of enthusiasm by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT would appear to ok for e/w|pg||
nt|jwit: Tough decision for East.  Can't fault the pass.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bridge_one: 1Nt = controls ?|pg||
nt|brgpro: no idea....|pg||
nt|dburn: strange to overcall 2@d - 1NT looks rather more the sort of thing|pg||
nt|lestergold: ook the words out of my mouth david|pg||
nt|drg: I agree|pg||
nt|stewball: I've never seen much point in opening Jxxxx in a balanced 9 count in 3rd chair|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: West hopes that his diamond tolerance will see him through if East doesn't have spade support|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: An off-shape 1NT by South bought it in the closed room|pg||
nt|daman: I wonder if EW can buy this in a @S partscore?|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could not risk a double with only one heart. Correctly, he passes.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bobholl: not sure but beter than 5-7 (double)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D I understand, 3@D I don't|pg||
nt|jwit: Especially vul|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|lestergold: it looks awful but here it has probabkly pushed e/w overboard mind u woulodnt have if east had overcalled a nt|pg||
nt|dburn: but if partner is in the habit of overcalling 2@d on this kind of thing, that's a risky strategy|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is becoming ugly|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S might not get DBL'd|pg||
nt|robbg: Here is trick 8, sort of.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i suppose 1Nt =  3/4 control with stop in @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C like stayman|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 nt will make also and with 2 aces missing this is the kind of hand r'dam will like :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt work only for J in @D in the dummy to re-enter !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner did see that you overcalled at the 2-level, vulnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S at green might bid one more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S playing well|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3c not playing well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: even if declarer misguesses hearts|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobh1: he should be able to hold this to -500, no great disaster|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://icelandairopen.com/index.php?m=D3&id=M_OPENTEAMS2009&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2009  for leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the bid removes very little space. Nothing much going for it.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i would not dream of overcalling at the two level vulnerable with k empty to 5|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brgpro: telling u guys a secret, i dont like to play against de wijs muller....they are too fast for me|pg||
nt|ady: might make an overtrick |pg||
nt|dburn: I imagine South will double it, if it gets bid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: need to play 9@H  for best result|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont see how 9@H can cost|pg||
nt|ady: can still make 10 tricks on the spade lay|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S are playing  TARZAN PRECISION (note by a kibitz) - played also by jansma/verhees |pg||
nt|drg: double based on the sound of the auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: im a beliebver in good suits for this bid never mind the point couint|pg||
nt|drg: west shown weakness and east doesn't have spade support|pg||
nt|dburn: still, declarer may escape for down one|pg||
nt|lestergold: but they cant double|pg||
nt|robbg: Now a @d underlead is necessary|pg||
nt|brolucius: A kibitzer suggests that 4@H might make. So, an inexperienced player who doubled on the East hand and found his partner jumping to 4@H might have been rewarded.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|stewball: i wonder why S dbld 4@s but not 3nt|pg||
nt|drg: seems the most likely result|pg||
nt|mariner1: there is a "SLIM" chance of making...........|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the root of the eveil was that oveercall- when 1nt just about expresses the hand|pg||
nt|dburn: North-South may not realise, on this bidding, that they should be attacking diamonds of all things|pg||
nt|mariner1: the small @H probably ends it though|pg||
nt|lestergold: i c that they got away with a making nt in the closed room|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h2|nt|ady: looks like 500     a small loss for e/w|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, @H10 was an unlucky lead|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Don't be too sarcastic Jack :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: jansma verhees play more like polish :) not tarzan .|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 800|pg||
nt|jwit: Might hold it to 500 Roland.  Might get to ruff a heart in hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think their diamonds will run away|pg||
nt|lestergold: must lose 2h dim and 2 spades|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: of course they will - West has a pitch on a heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: ??|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c back tests declarer|pg||
nt|drg: south doesn't have an easy play to trick 2 after the duck|pg||
nt|mariner1: not my lead back though'|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a club might run away now|pg||
nt|drg: and the ruffing heart finesse along the way to deal with a diamond|pg||
nt|drg: ruff the other club|pg||
nt|mariner1: true S has no great return to be honest|pg||
nt|drg: and 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobholl: good lead when strong hand in S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, but in TARZAN can find also sequence by jansma/verhees |pg||
nt|drg: when spades break and A@D onside along with the K@C|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How will you score @D6?|pg||
nt|jwit: Or a club|pg||
nt|ady: now might be more    should have played a c lub before the diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: might as well put the queen on it - can't really help to duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: chance for west to steal a horrible contract but missed it|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: would have to guess the heart position though in South wins first sspade and plays a 2nd heart|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brgpro: claim and NEXT|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|hedyg: need a @c back now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it's 500 again, Hauge should have won|pg||
nt|ady: play a clun immediately    then make the low trump by ruffing a club|pg||
nt|drg: ducking gives no hope|pg||
nt|stewball: to say nothing of it being pointless|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: now an easy 10|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you get to dummy to ruff a club?|pg||
nt|lestergold: ducking seemed misere|pg||
nt|lestergold: and need to be allowed to ruff 4th heart in dummy but hes drawing trumops so likely 2 off|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobholl: once we played muller 4boards in 22  minutes almost a record :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: with a ladder|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't understand this line at all|pg||
nt|mariner1: counting your losers leads to playing the Q@C, only way to remove a loser is if it wins|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the dims have not run away surprisingly enuf!|pg||
nt|drg: started well at trick 1, but since then|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|d8|pg||

nt|dinos1: good def for -2|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess they both know x is for a spade lead|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: England double the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: this shows BOTH MAJORS regardless of shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=any 16+HCP|pg||

mb|1H|nt|flash: in range for 1NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I don't think we have seen this in Europe|pg||
nt|by: ah, just imagine 2@d (flannery)- 2@s|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: score adjusted ...he claimed 12 not 13|pg||
nt|allanr44: Should be no surprises here|pg||

nt|chick: http://members.optusnet.com.au/ yeh2009/|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: We have different bids to show both majors, but 1NT is not one of them|pg||
nt|kyosuke326: a balance double?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but according to klinger-mullamphy convention card from beijing, 1D=@D & @H|pg||
nt|flash: (15-17); up to partnership style whether to open 1NT or 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: sure, 2@c, 2@d, 2@h, and 2@s I have all seen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do they show a balanced hand inside the range?|pg||
nt|gracelin: I believe this 1NT showing both majors depend on position, in 3rd/4th position it denies a major, am I right, BU?|pg||
nt|dinos1: wd u open 1 strong @c?|pg||
nt|mrdct: It's the open room of Match A|pg||

nt|ahalim: that means 3NT makes :)|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|by: Y|pg||
nt|wygbe1: dont think i would, with the need to get h in play before they preempt  - and qj of c is no good|pg||
nt|chick: I wouldn't because it suggests a lot more HC strength, rather than distributional strength|pg||
nt|dinos1: agree - shape doesnt mean power|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or   the convention card for NS has drastically changed :(|pg||
nt|chick: as a very knowledgable spec points out, EW might get to a makeable 6@S after opps open a strong @C.  Not an everyday event|pg||
nt|mildredb: 2@H probably denies 4 @H|pg||
nt|pbundy: with the spots and 5 card suit i would upgrade to "18-19" range|pg||
nt|flash: the problem, as Peggy mentioned, with the call is that this is a max and a @S game might be missed|pg||
nt|allanr44: Bit of weather coming up the coast ... http://mirror.bom.gov.au/products/IDR663.loop.shtml skip|pg||
nt|xenya: i think i'll go and get coffee -- it's early morning here|pg||
nt|allanr44: We'll look after this one Vladimir|pg||
nt|jbgood: double was good - in theory|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: helgemo with tough decision = went for the gusto|pg||
nt|chick: right, double gave the right info, S didn't pay attention|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice pass by S in open|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 2d can have 3 cards|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dinos1: especially when we shd decide at 5 level|pg||
nt|sybarra: lucky slam |pg||
nt|dinos1: great bid 6@s|pg||
nt|pbundy: or a slam :)|pg||
nt|flash: opening 1@S and rebidding 2NT over a 1NT call seems adequate, but...|pg||
nt|jbgood: now 3 @d is excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D does have play though|pg||
nt|mariner1: the trump lead good for defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i think declarer will scramble enuf for his contract in spite of the 5/a trump break spades 3/3 clubs can b ruffed in hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dinos1: not lucky - good after STRONG @c|pg||
pc|d3|nt|beauch: anyway im sure south didnt anticipate defending1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: S & W are on same side of the screen, so i doubt Klinger had wrong info|pg||
nt|ahalim: I can see Meckwell on the webcam|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|by: you don't show BAL or not, Roland, you show that you got the majors. :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: east violates the rule by not leading a trump in this auction. |pg||
nt|wygbe1: will he work out the club position? |pg||
pc|cT|nt|gracelin: better late than never|pg||
nt|mildredb: looks as tho they are on their way to their slam|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes, it does appear that they are going to get there anyway.  we'll see.|pg||
nt|flash: notice that the @S wastage and the @D duplication is irrelevant here!!|pg||
nt|flash: the right 15 in the West hand is enough|pg||
nt|chick: I can only see 8 tricks after a trump lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: after strong opp opening, he can bid it as a sacrifice that makes :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: Hearts may be well-placed, depending on the line taken|pg||
nt|chick: vs Brekka and Svendsen|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: there must be some rule about defending when opponents bid your longest suit :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: let|pg||
nt|pbundy: let's say we've all been in much worse slams|pg||
nt|xenya: good auction |pg||
nt|xenya: to a slightly optimistic contract perhaps|pg||
nt|allanr44: yes|pg||
nt|allanr44: It all hinges on the heart suit|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs to set up second club winner now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|beauch: indeed|pg||
nt|mildredb: that is an understatement - I've been in slam off 2 cahsing aces :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: i think N hoped to find @HK with S, but Q109 is not to be sneezed at either|pg||
nt|chick: over here, we're still fighting the partscore battles|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: townsend not shy to lead the marked trump as he knows he will find short eharts in dummy|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|pbundy: ONLY two, mildred?|pg||
nt|flash: the other room auction on 22 won't win any awards, but it did generate a plus (and lose 11 IMPs because of the defense in here)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mildredb: to the best of my recollection|pg||
nt|pbundy: w d|pg||
nt|pbundy: i once managed to get to 7NT off THREE cashing aces when a partner forgot we were playing drury|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pbundy: he thought that my jump raise was invitational - and - there we were!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: ducking and ruffing @c works|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|frankaus: restricted choice will let him down|pg||
nt|dinos1: sry - sure lucky) shd be @c loser ))|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if he places h king with south, could get clubs right - but would n bid the same with 8 solid h and two small clubs?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|wygbe1: or 8 solid h and stiff c quack?|pg||
nt|dinos1: no restricted choice @s void and @c stiff is too much ;-)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|allanr44: that is true|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i thouight he would run the club|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 @d a good contract - but the trump lead was too much|pg||
nt|chick: leading trump was excellent defense, now only 7 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gracelin: mater of undertricks, probably -2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: He will get one more trick in the wash|pg||
nt|beauch: Mullamphy not enjoying this hand- after his routine 1@D overcall|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: the hearts coming|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|allanr44: forced to play heart to ace i think|pg||
nt|xenya: luckily, declarer can't go wrong in @Hs|pg||
nt|allanr44: too few entries for dbl finesse and cashing|pg||
nt|xenya: he can advance the Q too|pg||
nt|mrdct: official website is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ for live scores from all tables, a webcam and other goodies.|pg||
nt|xenya: he needs just 1 @H trick|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kyosuke326: seems -1 now|pg||
nt|gracelin: very strength H9 play|pg||
nt|gracelin: strenge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: More than strange since the jack was exposed in the dummy|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: looks like 1 off now|pg||
mc|5|nt|ahollan1: in the other room, Gill-Richman play big club with transfer openings so maybe this will be an unlikely duplicated auction?|pg||
pg||
qx|o14|st||md|4SA832H842DQ72CAK3,S764HKQT3DJ3CQ872,SJT9HJ975DA864CJT,SKQ5HA6DKT95C9654|sv|o|nt|hedyg: 9@H and @s were the best cards he had!, ignored them both|pg||
nt|jwit: It will be hard for defense not to give declarer a heart ruff or club ruff or set up a spade trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but they can manage|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's probably worth looking at that one again, with DF or GIB, to see how the defenders can force 800.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2 IMPs is a cheap price for what seemed to be a very dubious 3@D from East.|pg||
nt|jwit: Indeed David|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://icelandairopen.com/index.php?m=D3&id=M_OPENTEAMS2009&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2009|pg||
nt|mariner1: for leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|drg: an odd push|pg||
nt|lestergold: card play by west on  this one below par|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N certainly has play here.........|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4 being played in the closed room. West is in 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After North showed 5-5 in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N might be better than 4@H here,,,, though 4@H has play|pg||
mb|1C!|an|11-13 bal or 17+|nt|thegarve: Forget honour cards, its 9s that count|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: sometimes :)|pg||
nt|thegarve: might buy it in 3@c|pg||
nt|dburn: the same might be said of East at the other table on this one - how do you go down in 3NT?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4S a reasonable conmtract to reach unfortunat lie of cards|pg||
nt|jwit: 4H most likely contract.  Should fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: many would make that bid  |pg||
mb|1H|nt|bobh1: dont see this as a weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|jwit: This board rates to be a push|pg||
nt|mariner1: hard to dbl hook @H twice|pg||
nt|lestergold: over ruffs abound|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H is a sound spade raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: pass?|pg||
nt|lestergold: with the favourable lie of the hearts it is difficult to see|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 23 pt 3N in other room   may well fail   even on a club lead through difficult communication    would need to play a low diamond from hand |pg||
nt|thegarve: Pass was clearcut|pg||
nt|drg: play for A@S onside instead of J@H?|pg||
nt|drg: this auction doesn't seem possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is this?|pg||
nt|mariner1: one way to avoid 3N :)|pg||
nt|dburn: this may or may not be a strong club based auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: playing precision so at most 15 in E|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bobh1: isnt it NS's hand in @s's?|pg||
nt|jwit: Don't think they will be able to compete high enough Bob|pg||
nt|bobh1: double now|pg||
nt|stewball: according to the play record N pitched down to dbl KJ@h |pg||
nt|stewball: and then the record stops|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well it will ceertainly gain imps today!|pg||
nt|jwit: Don't like that double at all with subminimum values, length in opponents suit, and shortness in partner's suit.|pg||
nt|robbg: Which top honor? Schifko was on a different page or improvising.|pg||
nt|mariner1: and a very weak @S suit|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brolucius: North was close to 1NT over the double. That would have allowed South to bid 2@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3 level t/o doubles are not 7 HCPs, partner should have 10+ so pass looked fine|pg||
nt|ady: dangerous 3@C bid vuln|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps, but there seems to be some doubt as to the actual result at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: will he guess this|pg||
nt|lestergold: i doubt it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jón will never guess it|pg||
mb|p|nt|robbg: I don't like the neg x either but find it less odious than the 1@s overcalls we have seen.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would not double either, but many players seem to like to show the spades when they hold them (as we have already seen in this set).|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes J is not usually considered a top honor........|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: quite a lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: hes short of side suit tricks sohe has to play with the odds|pg||
nt|jwit: Great conservative judgement by Schifko, at least on this actual hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that 3NT has been bid three times and always made. Everyone has failed who bid the heart game.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: the other doubleton best lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: duck...................|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Expected the unexpected from Fredin|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: hes going to lose a heart two dims and at least one overruff surelt|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i see it made in t'other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Made in the other room on @HK lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah|pg||
nt|lestergold: on eup for Fredin he needs one this session|pg||
nt|lestergold: one up i mean|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: On a very sunny day N-S might make 4@S.|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he takes the double hook now, 11 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thos contract aint easy double dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: S might have rebid 2@D to show more|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|jwit: I agree Rob|pg||
nt|robbg: I think what happened here is that Schifko thought he was showing values with the xx, so he thought 2@h was fully descriptive.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: 1 reason to duck the lead is not having a good exit card|pg||
nt|hedyg: if S knew that N has the 2 red queens..|pg||
nt|lestergold: send it to darwin David?|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, at double dummy the play is fairly straightforward - declarer can even recover from his misguess at trick one|pg||
nt|dburn: but at the table, I'd be pretty surprised if he makes it|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|bobh1: yes but even in a thunderstorm they will make 3|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bobholl: east is placed again i think :) but not easy to play|pg||
nt|brolucius: You might redouble and then say 2@H when you held only two hearts. That's the problem.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jwit: Though conservatism was right here as long as they were going to play hearts rather than no trump, and no trump was extremely unlikely on this auction|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mariner1: no dbl now|pg||
nt|daman: @C spots are favo(u)rable if he playes it properly|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: well there is a club pin for tyhe double dummy enthusiasts|pg||
nt|lestergold: and carefully draw two rounds of truimps with the ace and queen but surely taht is hugh darwin territory|pg||
nt|dburn: that will not work|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to get back to hand so doesnt work|pg||
nt|dburn: he needs at some point to run both @s10 and @cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: in any case this chicken isnt going to fight for  Jon|pg||
nt|dburn: which is why I will be rather surprised if he makes it|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume this is a serious tank|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he does, he is too good to play against|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although a few BBO'ers would do it in their sleep, sadly|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is too good isnt he but even he wont mke this one|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: and now brown cow?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dburn: now nothing - the best he can hope for is to avoid down two|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brolucius: I wonder what an immediate 2@S by South would have meant.|pg||
nt|lestergold: a perfetly reasonable way to playa 1 heart contract|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the overcall by East help - however they arn't other line to play ...|pg||
nt|bobh1: i assume weak|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: the best return|pg||
nt|ady: nice switch|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: i like immediate 2@s with a passed pd|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: but a lot less than 11 tricks!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: K@H and then the @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: and then only just made|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bobholl: uo to 9 tricks now and 10 ??|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K in @H np for the declarer - keep with the ace and play @H having 2 discards over J10 in @H|pg||
nt|brgpro: declarer played it wrongly....in with the 3rd trump in dummy, he shd have ran the @hJ|pg||
nt|brgpro: that line works with the @cA drops 3rd and double finesse in @h works|pg||
pc|dK|nt|thegarve: @H switch by default |pg||
nt|hedyg: W could have taken that Q@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: Then perhaps he was OK for that bid. Not good that they sold out to 2@C at both tables.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well good thing they were not higher in @H|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: down 2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: probably weaker     maybe a trusting partner should have competed with 2! after 2@C passed to him|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: still only just made|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: he managed|pg||
pc|h3|nt|drg: trying to justify his partner's pass maybe|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dburn: that's why they call it Precision|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah|pg||
nt|lestergold: im learning|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 9 tricks is surely not right|pg||
nt|by: that is being corrected as we speak|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, down 1|pg||
nt|mrdct: The official website is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ with links to live scores from all matches, a webcam and other goodies.|pg||
nt|beauch: usually hard to predict gill- richman auctions- hit the stratosphere very quickly- play transfer openers- very light weight|pg||
nt|pbundy: india's teammates had a nice result in the other room on the hand where 4@H slipped through here|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|allanr44: yes indeed.  Although not what Italy are looking for|pg||
nt|ahalim: finally some action coming|pg||
nt|chick: 3 push boards so far, we need the action !|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Cayne thinking.....|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 3 down agreed|pg||
nt|mariner1: not 300 was it?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good lead and great defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: should have cashed the spaders when he had a chance|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: big swing then|pg||
mb|d|nt|gracelin: EW can make 4S only if take first round finesse in trumps or some defensive helps.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|wygbe1: running the 9 was the percentage play for the suit, but the strong club opening might have given him a chance|pg||
nt|reisig: 4@s seems obvious spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: New Zealand has always been fertile ground for aggressive, slightly off-beat approaches|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Richie|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chick: 2@H shows 2 controls (an A or 2 Ks)|pg||
nt|reisig: hiya:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: another 1N swish I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: this is quite an opening bid by West|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: what does 2nt show?|pg||
nt|pbundy: i would prefer it if clubs really meant clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: E opened 2@H in OR -- !@H here  might make all the difference|pg||
nt|lestergold: i must admit i thought at the start that it was makeable with 4 dims three spades and a ruff in hand but i was very wrong|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yep|pg||
pc|s2|nt|flash: again, 1@C may be short; 1@D is an xfer to @Hs; 1@H shows at least 3 (4 possible in an unbalanced hand)|pg||
nt|xenya: again, not much to write home about?|pg||
nt|mariner1: N in Open aggressive to 2@D and -50 might score for them|pg||
nt|mariner1: getting 7 in is not easy at all|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Gold in the tank|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mildredb: splinter promies 4@H|pg||
nt|ahalim: can make12 tricks now|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||

nt|allanr44: no.  how's the coffee?|pg||
nt|xenya: splendid|pg||
nt|shevek: I don't think this will make|pg||
nt|xenya: and it did|pg||
nt|reisig: what now?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: now .... Cayne is thinking|pg||
nt|reisig: never would have guessed :)|pg||
nt|chick: E is being discouraging I think|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: :)|pg||
nt|reisig: maybe 4@d|pg||
nt|reisig: I know what I'd bid :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|beauch: 7/9|pg||
nt|allanr44: no, no way|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think this one will be beyond my son's re4sources|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Got that help in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club to the queen and a low!? heart back|pg||
nt|by: be fair, they were defending three|pg||
nt|barbyh: and 3 cl?|pg||
nt|pbundy: if they don't get to slam after this start, i will eat my keyboard.|pg||
nt|flash: a new variation on 'no dessert if you don't eat your peas?'|pg||
nt|mildredb: luckily you don't need to go get the salt Peg :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: you mean : we all know :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|by: south tried to underlead her @hAQX and the @HK scored|pg||
nt|eieio: North leads the 7, South may lead a club back if he wins the first round|pg||
nt|allanr44: I meant no way it will make|pg||
nt|xenya: probably down 1 for a 3-imp gain|pg||
nt|reisig: yup|pg||
nt|jbgood: and will..|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S-2@C/2@D take care of INV and Game Forcing raises, so 2N probably mixed or bergen-ish as David says|pg||
nt|beauch: not sure- usually ron sends matt a system update most days!!!|pg||
nt|chick: E could hardly say no more clearly than this|pg||
nt|lestergold: but im usually wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs a little defensive help I think|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dinos1: so 1@c opening only was helping here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gracelin: cashing HA is not good enough to stop four, since with 2 diamond entries, declarer can establish a H trick for club discard|pg||
nt|by: i think declarer can set up a heart trick for a @c pitch even if  he loses a spade.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south need to return a diamond or a trump|pg||
nt|pbundy: maybe.  i don't know how tasty my keyboard is, tho - new laptop :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Good bids|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: play will me much faster... :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: and the 1st swing|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: will be.....|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to see how the defence qwont come to 2 clubs 2 dims and three spades|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gracelin: and even that may not help if declarer takes the right view|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|beauch: they wer my team- mates in a recent oz tourney- but there system was 2 complex for me:0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our fearless Vugraph Coordinator would call this a slam hand  - because it makes|pg||
nt|barbyh: but better in hts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this may give back the 1 imp they won on 1st board|pg||
nt|beauch: as im heading for seniors my pd and i are chopping pages out of our system notes- but ron/matt are added them at a fast pace|pg||
nt|barbyh: less is more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ron has long history of adding science -- and going through partners :)|pg||
nt|beauch: matt and ron have been playing for a couple of years- and had good results, except if my team- mates:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to keep N off lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: bit difficult when north has dim ace!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: the A@D is big card|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: South in the tank now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mildredb: %@D asks for @HQ|pg||
nt|pbundy: phew.|pg||
nt|xenya: bucks you up -- unlike the last 2 boards here|pg||
nt|chick: really, the 7?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yes... the 7 ON THE TABLE|pg||
nt|reisig: who cares?|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you i can see a possibility hre two clubs a spade 3h and a dim add up to 7 if it happens that way|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hoping for @haj with p|pg||
pc|hT|nt|by: i mean, @d to Q, @h to A, then @h ruffing finesse -- can't lose , and later take the spade hook|pg||
nt|mildredb: 5@D*|pg||
nt|allanr44: what time there?|pg||
nt|allanr44: heart was better i think|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mildredb: good slam - better if played by E|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mildredb: no @S lead - doesn't matter|pg||
nt|lestergold: a spade blockage mightb wll occur|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: oh -- it's already 9 o'clock -- not too early actually|pg||
nt|allanr44: ahah!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|by: lose @h @c @s|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north starts with J97x in club, not returning club may hurt the defense.  I wud lead C10 here instead of the 3rd best C7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will ron try for elimination hoping one defender has doubleton @C honor?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahalim: makes no difference :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|by: I think that was eieio's point, yes, Patrick you are correct|pg||
nt|gracelin: running HJ is a free play|pg||
nt|athene: hi everyone....|pg||
nt|by: I think that the 3@s opening at the other table is a bit overboard|pg||
nt|eieio: I think he may take a spade hook right now|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Bill|pg||
nt|eieio: If he plays north for CK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs to but not clear it is right|pg||
nt|eieio: since he leads the @C7|pg||
nt|gracelin: no, south must have KQ of club or he will return a club long ago|pg||
nt|eieio: he may try to squeeze north|pg||
nt|eieio: oh yeah, good point|pg||
nt|kyosuke326: if North have @CK, why South didn't return a @C after the first lead?|pg||
nt|pbundy: right.  have to make a decision with a spade out|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: or -- both clubs onside|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course, we can see no losing options (other than potentially an overtrick)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: if david can read the cards accurately i think it makes now|pg||
nt|lestergold: just play north for the ace of dims|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now he can pull @D to the king as south has shown 11 points outside @Ds|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: and @Da would add up to 15 and a 1nt by south|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: he is in the tank|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|reisig: Make 11 tricks ..NEXT|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wygbe1: cant beat this |pg||
nt|dinos1: dcl may misguess and try to play 2 more @c's|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes he should do it but not easy yes|pg||
mc|7|nt|gracelin: well done by Jhikaru, that's our hope for the future|pg||

nt|dburn: mind you, even with @hK lead declarer at the other table did pretty well to get home|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: sry have to leave(tya) but my hopes for vorden are very low |pg||
nt|Walddk2: And now on to the 7% hand, the chance of both sides having 20 hcp|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S makes, 5@D makes|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D makes|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ady: double?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double is fine if you play ELC|pg||
nt|brolucius: Redouble is normal on the South cards and then West can say 2@S.|pg||
nt|hedyg: double OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Equal Level Conversion|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most of the field played in 4@H. I suppose we should congratulate N-S here for staying low, but I don;t think South quite showed his hand in support of hearts.|pg||
nt|jwit: This should be a flat 4H|pg||
nt|mariner1: possible slam here with no @D lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: not that they should be in slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: better play 6@d by East, though|pg||
nt|stewball: chunky prempt|pg||
nt|mariner1: forget 6@D off an entry|pg||
nt|lestergold: he needs enuf entries to ruff out the spade k and enjoy the spades to make 56d playe by East of course |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 1 entry short of 6@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think he has them|pg||
nt|dburn: at this rate, he'll be doing well to get to game|pg||
nt|drg: must be something to 3@S, that can't be a w/r preempt|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|hedyg: seems to be a forcing NT|pg||
nt|ady: pzrft score again    n/s should make 1NT   but e/w managed to buy the contract in 1NT in other room  a save |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They could well end up in a 4-2 fit here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like double much|pg||
nt|hedyg: W's partners never bid @d on his t/o doubles?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double is a take-out of hearts|pg||
nt|jwit: Double ok if you play same level conversions.  Will actually work well here.|pg||
nt|jwit: Diamond lead stands out however|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve: Double is better against a strong NT than a weak NT base|pg||
nt|ady: aggressive by west  if eastg is going to take out to diamonds with a  weak hand|pg||
nt|ady: east ereally has enough to pass|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|brgpro: 4@s is a lucky make with no entry in dummy to take the trump finesse and both @h honors on side|pg||
nt|thegarve: some pairs like to defend and take a plus - West on the last hand showed that he preferred to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not promising extras when you pull clubs to diamonds to show S + D|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s= 1NT?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes its a trappy hand David|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he had a clue from the auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: so does not bidding it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this will be bad for e/w  especcially on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|thegarve: the double should help to find a @s lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: what does 3s mean surely notm a standard preempt much too good a hand|pg||
mb|1S!|an|0-7 4+ !S|nt|Walddk2: West will lead a top spade I suppose|pg||
nt|ady: at what level if there is a 2 or 3@H bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: way too strong for 3@S for me....... W must have seen them before :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4s isthe sensible spot on these cards|pg||
nt|dburn: it is possible that 3@s was part of the system, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: so he did|pg||
mb|2C!|an|17+ with 5!H|nt|vugraphzgq: That could prove to be a major swing to 't Onstein, if Muller passes|pg||
nt|brgpro: i remember once in a big tournament in NED. years ago....someone led a trump from xxx when the opps reached 7@s. the book say so what can go wrong? pd had Kx and dummy was void..|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Or not, sorry, thinking error :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: no big deal, 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I was thinking 500+420|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont see how they beat this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe both of you thought East was on lead|pg||
nt|robbg: Schifko has to carry on, I would think.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: Still should apply Ady|pg||
nt|lestergold: a nice easy one for us not much to say infrangible 4S|pg||
nt|daman: this is a piano hand   time to refill my coffee|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: South has a huge hand in general, but is worried about the x-x-x in diamonds.|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is a very strong 2@H call,,,,,,|pg||
nt|robbg: I hope I do better with my Super Bowl pick!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now that they have stopped in 3@H it will be good tactics for West to avoid the diamond lead.|pg||
nt|mariner1: and that is?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: Got to be Arizona, since he lives there|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: pick the q for an overtrick|pg||
nt|robbg: I can't conceive of pass with Schifko's hand, given that 2NT is an invitation!|pg||
nt|robbg: Go Cards!|pg||
nt|jwit: I agree with you on not passing Robb, not on Arizona lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north ant givepartner a dim ruff and cash two hearts she  can only do one or the other|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brgpro: what is E thinking about? 5@s?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If West knew that South's 1@S was artificial then perhaps he should have bid 2@S instead of doubling. |pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: sorry    contract played by west|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: do we know if NS play transfer bids over double?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4 if need be. If partner really bids 4@C over 3@H, he must have some values|pg||
nt|bobh1: the 2@s bid stole the board|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|brgpro: can't be right...|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: what am i talking about only two spades in the soputh hand]|pg||
nt|dburn: odd sort of play, that - why go against the odds?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: i would have played @h after the A@S|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: I understand   but they may be in some difficulty at the 4 levedl if west has just got 6 clubs |pg||
nt|lestergold: so better play hearts now to hold to 4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mariner1: you are still right, can't do both :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well not the other|pg||
nt|lestergold: logically i am right|pg||
nt|lestergold: but intellectually im an idiot|pg||
nt|mariner1: or merely confuzed|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And if he has no values, he has 7 clubs|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jwit: I think I would have actually bid 2S rather than double with West hand with 5 spades.|pg||
nt|mariner1: cornfuzed as we said in the South|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s8|nt|dburn: still, I guess Fredin didn't get where he is today by making normal plays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fredin likes the sublime|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bobh1: was the 2@s bid alerted?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He won't bid 4@C on Qxxxxx and out|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|bobh1: i meant the 1@s bid?|pg||
nt|ady: he can haved some values    but not expecting a singleton club with pard|pg||
nt|brolucius: Equal Level Conversion is a fair idea but I don't get the impression that many people play it.|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: yes... the 9 of hearts did well|pg||
nt|chick: although N shouldn't have fallen for it, he knew the A@D was there for a pitch|pg||
mb|p|nt|beauch: e/w may get to @d slam here|pg||
nt|jbgood: S will run into a bad spade split here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|by: 2@c is dury|pg||
nt|fabsayc: drury?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = artificial, INV strength|pg||
nt|mildredb: so who sits out when Hampson plays?  Cheek or Grue?|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: drury, asking if partner has something resembling a real opening bid|pg||
nt|by: kidding aside, it shows 3@h and 10-14|pg||
nt|fabsayc: rather limited if it promises hearts, if is size ask is not really drury|pg||
nt|athene: facing 3-card support and 10-14 hcp, isn't it simpler for north to just rebid 4@H and conceal information from the defence?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|by: N decides to be scientific|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 3n can always make, but on a club lead declarer needs to put up the king, not run it to the ten|pg||
nt|flash: sorry - other team from India in 5th...    India Nat'l now in 12th|pg||
nt|pbundy: i believe i saw hampson playing with grue, mildred|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: but - not sure that they do it that way always|pg||
nt|mildredb: I'm assuming that Meckwell plays all the time - perhaps erroneously|pg||
nt|pbundy: should cornell pass here?  partner IS a passed hand.......|pg||
nt|flash: the X was responsive (and should show at least tolerance for @Hs)|pg||
nt|xenya: in OR, E didn't overcall -- much livelier here|pg||
nt|jbgood: cautious 2 @s|pg||
mb|2H|nt|allanr44: Good 2S|pg||
nt|chick: he could end up losing 2 @Hs and 3 @Ss|pg||
nt|chick: and a @C if they lead them|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i musnt praise him too much but hes known for playing m,ost hands double dummy|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Mike,i think that you are underestimating your son's declarer play skills :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|beauch: no- ron bid 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S was non-minimum|pg||
nt|barbyh: I was in shock|pg||
nt|xenya: yes but a bit too heavy perhaps, 1@S was an alternative at these colours|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe it's one of those 8-11|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: this was faster...director just anounced half way point|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Our Round 7 matches in about 55 mins are: Yeh Bros v USA Hampson and India Venkatesh v India National|pg||
nt|jbgood: y double?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gracelin: 6H is actually on, just not biddable|pg||
nt|beauch: rewind|pg||
nt|barbyh: what? never bid his diamonds|pg||
nt|pbundy: i like pass myself.  no clear fit whatsoever - and - may nip it more than 1 for a nice profit.|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe, yes|pg||
nt|chick: my grandmother taught me, don't double the only contract you can set|pg||
nt|lestergold: no i know the mwell|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it may have meant 6+@S or 5@S & 4@C|pg||
nt|wygbe1: n had the chance to make the winning bid of 3n from his side|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy to be in 3 nt |pg||
nt|allanr44: The sequence was coloured ... white|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: in 6, if you draw trumps then play @C to @CJ and @CK, you have to decide if east is playing obligatory falsecard from @CQ10x|pg||
nt|beauch: yes Barbara - if ron had passed me 2!|pg||
nt|jbgood: what a granny!|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: wd u prefer 2@c or 2N bid by S?|pg||
nt|flash: the virtue of passing is that 2@CX isn't overly painful if it should happen to make...|pg||
nt|xenya: so Australia Selected declaring in both rooms|pg||
nt|chick: the open room bid the spade slam and went down on a trump lead|pg||
nt|reisig: This is not the most exciting hand of the set|pg||
nt|chick: actually, it almost is :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: you can walk your dog now :)|pg||
nt|chick: except for bd 24, very dull|pg||
nt|chick: here at least there are overtricks to be won or lost|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: yes; that, too|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N in Open did not fare well at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: even with void in partner's suit, Klinger's hand has lots of play potential|pg||
nt|ahalim: and are you telling your granddaugters the same ? :)|pg||
nt|chick: she hardly knew how to finesse, but she was good with cliches :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H a much better spot|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jbgood: sry - only have 2 daughters - oldest is 20:)|pg||
nt|ahalim: maybe later :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|barbyh: actually its cold|pg||
nt|barbyh: without a trump lead|pg||
nt|beauch: hmm - east wondering about bidding 7!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right - trump lead eliminates @H ruff|pg||
nt|flash: a bath coup and it's not even Friday night...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: well  asilly 3n somehow or other in open so|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jbgood: all eggs in one basket ..|pg||
nt|jbgood: but may recover?|pg||
nt|lestergold: another gain on the way for England|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: 5@S = 2 key cards + trump Q -- klinger will NOT show his void, which would actually slow down mullamphy|pg||
nt|flash: (that's the duck of the @H lead by South - it gains a trick should West continue the suit)|pg||
nt|xenya: and they may well succeed in both rooms, too?|pg||
nt|allanr44: Might make for 6 IMPS|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Ish in the tank|pg||
nt|allanr44: If they attack hearts and blow the late entry, -1 for +2 IMPs|pg||
nt|lestergold: this will make trivially on the nose with the heklp of a couple of spad finesses|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: we are halfway and England doing great|pg||
nt|mariner1: added to the 150 though its a nice swing|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: east has only 2 entries and 3 finesses to take|pg||
nt|lestergold: he doesnt need the heart fionesse he just plays for the split spade honojurs tom will not use up an entry to take the heart finesse its anti perentage|pg||
nt|mariner1: in other match China 22  Yeh 4  however 6 boards left to score|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|beauch: good auction- east hand full of controls- reached good spot|pg||
nt|flash: @S6 back to show the @DA?|pg||
nt|chick: I sure wouldn't have led that after declarer's club bid|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: this lead will make things tough too|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|gracelin: I will admire him if East is leading CQ from Q10x also.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: but 3 pitches on @S and @H ruff should bring in 12 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dinos1: oh, 1N|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jbgood: was for a ruff or two - not so bad|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: yes :) i think he will pay off to that|pg||
nt|chick: eh, maybe, but without a trump control, unlikely to get them|pg||
nt|jbgood: intelligent actually|pg||
nt|jbgood: E pass over 3 @c x often shows a 3-carder|pg||
nt|chick: ok you win :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: now let's talk about that pass over 3@CX|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dinos1: for me 1N  better describes the hand|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i am told that in the other match, ns got to 3n but meckwell took 4c sac, rodwell bidding 4c on his stiff jack, then the opps bid 4d down one|pg||
nt|flash: (although West is running out of other options quickly)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|wygbe1: pretty amazing 4c bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: not vul  |pg||
nt|dinos1: opening was 2@c?|pg||
nt|dinos1: 6+|pg||
nt|wygbe1: not sure, but i assume so|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all sorry to be late|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he solves it by ruffing high|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he stiol has heart entry so he can afford teh heart finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: good duck but i doubt townsend will fall for it|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: Hi Shirley :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: no problem Shirl|pg||

nt|beauch: no claim shortly?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: now Hanlon turn in the tank....|pg||
pc|c5|nt|allanr44: North needed the long club.  Too late now I think|pg||
nt|Walddk5: R5: England v Stansby and Lavazza v Shanghai Pudong|pg||
nt|xenya: just a matter of overtrick i think|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i am told opening bid was 2c|pg||
nt|lestergold: townsned cant afford luxury of second heart finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think he will stick with the a priori odds of the spade honours being split|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: he should|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barbyh: home free|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Our matches in round 2 are: China A vs Norway and USA Hampson (Meckwell) vs Chinese Taipei|pg||
nt|flash: 6@H was a push on board 23|pg||
nt|allanr44: Yes, now.  Could have beaten it with an early heart switch I think|pg||

nt|robbg: Of all the unlikely things that happened in 2008, the Cards winning the NFC is possibly the unlikliest!|pg||
nt|mariner1: now a classic 3N NS|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: I know Chandler's Ford is in Hampshire|pg||
nt|lestergold: and even more remarkeable to make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: If NS manage to stay out of slam here, the match will be all but sealed|pg||
nt|dburn: and if the sequence in the Open room is correct, the bidding was indeed remarkable|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D showing multi or a weak major|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|brgpro: but the problem is that 6@h doesnt make....|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yup, @DK offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: And the @DT missing :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 5@S |pg||
nt|hedyg: on their way to @ss|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: well the more expected contract|pg||
nt|dburn: Grue no doubt in experimental mode having put a cold game on the floor earllier in proceedings|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: Btw, for all those who don't know, there's a screen dividing SW and NE. That forces me to wait for the tray to go through to enter biddings.|pg||
nt|mariner1: so this will be good for Shell since they missed their game EW|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: 1@C strong, 1@D not strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: This is the only table of 38 where game was not reached!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|thegarve: West has a 2.5@s rebid|pg||
nt|drg: managed to create his swing|pg||
nt|drg: this time in his favour|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: wonder how they held 3n to 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Closed played very fast and are finished|pg||
nt|dburn: not to argue with success, but I am not sure of the need for doing that sort of thing - sure, Grue is havign a shocker of a set, but he has team-mates|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: 3NT is actually a superior contract on these cards.  |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2 aces out and @d lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: off to the best lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Closed S opened a more reasonable (to me) 1@H on last board|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: will have to guess heart position    |pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: can make, but likely wont|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jwit: How did we get past 3NT here?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brgpro: they play reversed, pass=ask pd to X and X would have asked pd to act|pg||
nt|lestergold: will probably now just make 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless north opens clubs|pg||
nt|robbg: Obviously 2NT was forcing. Not everybody plays it that way. But there is something wrong (IMO) with a system that requires you to get beyond 3NT to describe a balanced 16.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bobh1: yep that would do it . . . so 4@s is the better contract|pg||
nt|jwit: 4S could be beaten with some outlandish distributions.  Can't touch 3NT with a crowbar|pg||
nt|lestergold: will probably make this by picking the dims up along with favourable position of the heart ace|pg||
nt|mariner1: this one getting away some|pg||
nt|brolucius: North is being very ambitious (to use a polite word) with his 4-3-3-3 shape opposite a weak NT.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jwit: Agree 100% David|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree he is being polite :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing the weak 1NT, it would go 1NT - 3NT. You would then have more energy left for the play.|pg||
nt|robbg: It seems to me that you should either play a direct 3NT as 16-17 or so, or an inverted raise followed by a jump to 3NT as 16-17.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzgq: Bertens: "Another sad display"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q in @D would be more clear|pg||
nt|thegarve: it is worth discussing whteher to use 2@C as a potential 2.5@s rebid|pg||
nt|ady: about 50-50 Hedy     guess heart will make|pg||
nt|lestergold: well south musnt continue clubs|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: best|pg||
nt|robbg: but they haven't made 4@s yet.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they ended in a tough Moysian Fit|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: can guess @s as well|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: yes     as it happens  in 3NT  it must be right to play clubs first as that might bring in enough tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://icelandairopen.com/index.php?m=D3&id=M_OPENTEAMS2009&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2009|pg||
nt|mariner1: for leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|mariner1: and the 4@H was bid on 5 in Closed so the skunk is over|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bobh1: that's true; 4@s is better at mps but 3n at imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Federer-Nadal: 5-7 6-3 6-6 |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There you go again; the spectacular|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DQ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many players, probably most, would raise 1NT to 3NT with North's 4-3-3-3 shape. As happened at the other table.|pg||
nt|daman: Go Roger|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It doesn't always work for him|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: That's what they would do in Sussex.|pg||
mc|12|nt|hedyg: no need to guess @H anymore|pg||
nt|brolucius: They seem to have introduced spades only on the 9th bid of the auction. Very strange.|pg||
nt|robbg: No justice on board 4. Fredin took 7 tricks in @h and won 3 IMPS from a counterpart who took 9 tricksin @h!|pg||

nt|xenya: @S all pass in OR -- would you reopen as W?|pg||
nt|xenya: *1@S|pg||
nt|allanr44: no|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: they switch the board around..so north is south and viceversa...|pg||
nt|jbgood: winning is no point when not playing Cornelia:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: long day just got home |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Very low scoring match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess is 8 but maybe 4, i'll check conditions of contest|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: north might double 2@C?|pg||
nt|gracelin: for college students, yes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not very good club texture i suppose|pg||
nt|barbyh: 7 will make|pg||
nt|pbundy: some pretty good teams not up near the top-  that is for sure|pg||
nt|jbgood: good to have you here Shirl|pg||
nt|ahalim: 6@C is on I think|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jbgood: always - but difficult to bid|pg||
nt|chick: can they make 7?|pg||
nt|chick: oops, no, the diamonds don't work|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I would want to be in it |pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 @s soft..|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may see a sac here|pg||
nt|mildredb: looks like game in @H for n/s|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: BBO does not provide for this :(|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: :)|pg||
nt|shevek: just when I chose to sit out :(|pg||
mb|2D|nt|beauch: i expect they will bid to 6@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|flash: board 24 also a push in slam...    things have settled down|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Gary Hanna|pg||

mb|p|nt|allanr44: Hi Gary|pg||
nt|reisig: More excitement :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: good lead|pg||
nt|reisig: If he knew abt @d J 10 ..he'd bid 4@s|pg||
nt|chick: how about 4D or 4N?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: top 15 move into knockout - joining Yeh Bros team|pg||
nt|ahalim: he heard you|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: South kind of endplayed on lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: bug will led this ride and go after diamonds|pg||
nt|allanr44: It will be hard to misguess the @Ds|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in the other room the comment was that this decent slam would never be bid in Standard|pg||
nt|mariner1: unbiddable slam here as in Open|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not think e/ will alow them to take 12 tricks here|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: well...south alerted 3nt and is considering......|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 12 tricks tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: south won't enjoy the followup any better|pg||
nt|beauch: The swedish pair are a very strong partnership and wont have trouble with this hand |pg||
nt|allanr44: We shall watch and learn  :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well thats a good way of doing it|pg||
nt|chick: if the @Ds split, 6N would be cold|pg||
nt|chick: so they could end up there|pg||
nt|lestergold: east will probably donate a club trick on the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: anyone know what these alerts mean?|pg||
nt|beauch: guess transfer|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers reminding me mayve no @c lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wygbe1: big result for ew since they were booked for minus 100 in 4s|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, coz @cK is well placed|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i imagine south thought there was a reasonable chance of a spade void in north's hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: clubs are out|pg||
nt|lestergold: buno he didnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: found best lead|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: even with  @C lead only 11 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: may well hold this to 9 tricks especially if north takes a dim finesse|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: S alerted 3nt but N said had no conventional meaning....just to play|pg||
nt|mariner1: might could get 2 @S in with a @H throw in after @c lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that is another few imps |pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: ahh - but 2 brackets|pg||
nt|mildredb: @D best for defense|pg||
nt|reisig: Q?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yep   Q on the table|pg||
pc|h6|nt|flash: conceding 11 tricks best for defense...    where's Joey when we need him?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H may have been 4@S|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chick: oops, a little unilateral|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: just like that|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: has to protect entry of jack of @C can he do everything?|pg||
nt|chick: the 5N bid put him in a difficult position, if he bids 6@C it would be showing Ks, if he shows his K, it's past 6@C anyway|pg||
nt|jbgood: clubs were not out:)|pg||
nt|chick: so if he is sure clubs is the right strain and not NT, 7@C is the only choice|pg||
nt|jbgood: might even make..|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|allanr44: I wonder why south didn't support hearts?|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd say ..the auction at the other table was ...well ...kinda poor|pg||
nt|chick: someone doubled 1S with only 3 hearts, always risky if pard has 4|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Olanski has 4 tricks...thinking how to manufacture another one  ...in the tank|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes there is a possibility to make it|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 2@H was INV+|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: my notes don't say anything else :(|pg||
nt|allanr44: in the open room|pg||
pc|h3|nt|beauch: anyway this hand looks like an early claim!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D may have been 1-under splinter|pg||
nt|barbyh: best lead for defenders gives him a little problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and all of this opposite 1N=10-12 [only not-vul vs vul 1/2/3 seats]|pg||
nt|barbyh: if the sp q doesnt drop has to hope clubs break 33|pg||
nt|wygbe1: declarer will strip the hand and exit in h |pg||
nt|jbgood: but likely a downer..|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|dinos1: u thk 5@d was in offence?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|chick: to make 7, he has to play a first round finesse in @Ds|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|reisig: anyone need a translation of "kinda poor" ?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|cJ|pc|h5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chick: not the normal way to play this suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: will probably run for hime now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: passed initially then 2@C explained as some sort of drury|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: next|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is trying to squeeze south in the majors, whioch will work|pg||
pc|d3|nt|allanr44: i have been corrected  :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: show-up|pg||
nt|beauch: 6@d failed in other room on Heart lead|pg||

pc|d4|pc|c9|nt|jbgood: ok now - well played|pg||

nt|hedyg: 10 imps|pg||
nt|thegarve: Ace doubleton leads give a lot of clues|pg||
nt|ady: last hand  heart guess is superior   as if ggetgting it wrong  you can still make if not losing a spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: some have a system where after stayman and a major by pd 3 OM shows fit in a 4 3 3 3 hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: and he can decide|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  better than 3NT    if the A@C and A@H  rerversed and you play clubs first you might go down if clubs dont break|pg||
nt|jwit: I usually raise 1NT to 3NT when I have a flat hand with a lot of secondary cards, but bid Stayman with primaries.  These cards seem a little more prime than secondary, so I don't ...|pg||
nt|jwit: fault Stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: waiting for the board|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Times newspaper reported last week that many local councils were abolishing the apostrophe in street names. They are replacing existing signs with new ones at great expense. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Apparently they abolished such apostrophes in the USA in 1890 (really) and there are only five exceptions there, including Martha's Vineyard.|pg||
nt|jwit: How could West not play the last diamond when in with the club queen?|pg||
nt|mariner1: now the penultimate board of this session|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: well evenly divided points a part score battle maybe here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: ok|pg||
nt|mariner1: beating 4@H was good here,,,,,,,, @c lead needed|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: 3@H or pass, panel?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Svendsen passed|pg||
nt|ady: that should stir east to a slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: i like 3@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: David Greenwood will approve, but for those of us who understand the apostrophe...|pg||
nt|ady: pass for me|pg||
nt|jwit: I would pass as well with weak suit|pg||
nt|bobh1: not so sure i like 3@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's really strange that apostrophe has no apostrophé|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would pass on the West cards, but it is tempting to bid. They say you should not bid 'weak over weak'.|pg||
nt|hedyg: partner has the right to expect more|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6NT from East?!|pg||
nt|daman: we'll see if EW can stop below game|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: Interesting 3NT with a meager @H stop|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this 3Nt is to play (gambling with K singleton in @h)|pg||
nt|brgpro: ok guys, i am sure we will know muller's decision by tomorrow morning|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Haha, but he has to bring his average speed down, he's played extraordinary fast the first couple of boards.|pg||
nt|drg: another remarkable auction in the other room|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: I dobt it, and you know, sometimes @SK is onside after the opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: *doubt|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to |pg||
nt|daman: put on the brakes|pg||
nt|robbg: Definitely a mental mistake.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bobh1: to me voids are values, especially in their known suit|pg||
nt|jwit: 3H vulnerable is asking for trouble in my opinion on that suit and no source of tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h looks the limit in a suit contract but N//S can make about 3 C|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers were asking about 9@D after Q@C win,,, to set the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@C is daisy-picking. What did he expect to get in return?|pg||
nt|brolucius: perhaps this auction will persuade us all not to bid on a hand like West's in the future.|pg||
nt|jwit: Of course when partner has 20HCPs lol|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6-4 is nice, having 4@s's is nice; lot's of reasons to bid|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT a very poor contract    if in a slam  should be in a red suit    thought diamonds split badly|pg||
nt|jwit: If you like going for big numbers from time to time Bob|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve: East is worth a raise with a singleton @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: kickback?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart bid ensures the killing lead against 4|pg||
nt|daman: bravo|pg||
nt|lestergold: but east has respected his partners minimum response tohis nenquiry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't it a lucky rather than a good stop, George?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bridge_one: in this situation A in @H is obliged ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Very unlucky @C break here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cue bid I assume|pg||
nt|hedyg: guess not|pg||
nt|brolucius: West wisely decides not to cue-bid the club void on his sub-sub-minimum hand.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|brolucius: West's 3@S did not do justice to his support. He should have bid 3@H.|pg||
nt|robbg: As well they should, a mental error as I said.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|brgpro: well. the first sight of dummy huub thought his gambling worked.....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: odd-ur|pg||
nt|bobh1: wisely . . . except slam is cold|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What if a club control is all partner needs?|pg||
nt|ady: what does east expect pard to do with no diamond control  if he has got a bit more?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could well have K@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: on board 6 the Closed are in 3N, a much easier spot|pg||
nt|robbg: I agree completely David.|pg||
nt|jwit: Good contract here.  Trump lead would have been best, but with diamonds behaving, contract is cold.|pg||

nt|hedyg: lucky for them he didnt|pg||
nt|drg: needed a red suit lead to set this|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: well 15 points with tenace acesless combos in the minors is not a mandatory raise to game of a min weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|daman: you can look at it 2 ways     lucky or clever|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: but will still sign off with no diamond control|pg||

nt|pbundy: oooooooops - what happens when i do vugraph beyond my bedtime!|pg||
nt|xenya: ah something interesting now...|pg||
nt|ahalim: and the hands are much more interesting than the previous round|pg||
nt|mariner1: well it is in the USA desert protected by Apaches.......|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kyosuke326: 4 or 5 Imps for the leader.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Big @C - 2@C = game force 4+@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: may land in 3nt|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: interesting decision by East here|pg||
nt|athene: and not obvious at all, given the vulnerability|pg||
nt|kyosuke326: I thought (3@D) - (P) - 3@S - 4@S (Dbl) :)|pg||
nt|flash: we'll assume that 3@S is MSS (minor-suit stayman)|pg||
nt|flash: 4NT looks like an underbid?   (but South's source of tricks should suffice to have him bid more)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: AND guarantees some singleton or void|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Bertheau artificially asking via relays -- we can only guess about Nystrom's responses|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D shows @Hs no doubt|pg||
nt|chick: 3@H on the law of total tricks?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dinos1: duplication in @s|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: perhaps north had visible problems passing 3@D|pg||
nt|athene: if so, east knows it's because he has a good hand, not because he has a diamond fit|pg||
nt|beauch: where will they stop -6@D?|pg||
nt|pbundy: i doubt east will find the only lead to give declarer a minor scare|pg||
nt|mildredb: i agree, I'd have not made a passable bid :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: at least - i'd certainly lead the diamond !J|pg||
nt|pbundy: @DJ|pg||
nt|allanr44: Oh well ...|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: arbitrary rules on preempts, acbl had one that weak two's had to have max 6 point range|pg||
nt|mildredb: I'd have lead a trump|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: shall we say a few light :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder what N showed with his sequence...|pg||
nt|allanr44: indeed|pg||
nt|allanr44: I think he showed what he has|pg||
nt|shevek: or 2-way checkback?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no great swing likely here on  aood day n/s may have bid and made 6 but very poor slam,|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well relayers had better learn they're missing trump 4 trump including King|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but how does @C play?|pg||
nt|xenya: or that|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 2D=game force|pg||
nt|allanr44: good outcome either way.  No more in it, sensibly|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 2H was natural|pg||
pc|h2|nt|shevek: good lead|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, nice|pg||
nt|reisig: 4@c on the law of ..why go plus ..when we can be minus|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: :)|pg||
nt|chick: no place to put the losing spade, so -1|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gracelin: I tried not to influenced by such hesitation.  It's maybe false and maybe north is thinking of an adcanced sacrifice.|pg||
nt|barbyh: easy make just uff 1 sp|pg||
nt|barbyh: ruff|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: wond be fun, but likely duplicated|pg||
nt|lestergold: could be an imp or two away this time|pg||
nt|lestergold: will surely take the rest now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|barbyh: does he know he has a club suit?|pg||
nt|beauch: hmm- i expect decl. will not make this one- !|pg||
nt|barbyh: los d to the 9|pg||
nt|barbyh: low|pg||
nt|barbyh: so many ways to play it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: relay auctions usually would be able to determine north's exact 0=4=6=3 shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not the 4-winner heart suit|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|flash: i'd've tried to invoke xfer leads - maybe partner knows what's best...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: *wont|pg||
pc|cT|nt|barbyh: probably the same result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even finding the @CQ may be suspect|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@S +1 was a push -- so Australia still pitching a shutout|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: or I should say "Australia - Open"  OZ is fielding 3 full teams -- and a partnership to a 4th|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 9@D sp for @S|pg||
nt|xenya: a bit surprising then that S went on|pg||
nt|allanr44: boyed by the slam  :)|pg||
nt|shevek: yet another flat board...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|xenya: now declarer might have some work to do|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: has to ruff|pg||
nt|gracelin: and no reason not to, partner must have SA or declarer will just ruff spade|pg||
nt|gracelin: I guess East is having a trip to the toilet|pg||
nt|eieio: It's not that easy for him to reconstruct the whole thing, I believe south usually have only 6 diamonds with this opening|pg||
nt|eieio: He doesn't know south has the 7th diamond|pg||
nt|fabsayc: makes no difference, cant kill heart winners if declarer has 3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gracelin: and partner's signal in heart length should tell him declarer has no more heart, so ruff and draw trump.  What's the rblem ?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|eieio: He might not be looking at count|pg||
nt|kyosuke326: I agree with eieio :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ooops|pg||
nt|allanr44: buoyed I mean ...|pg||
nt|xenya: it's 5 off, isn't it|pg||
mc|12|nt|gracelin: a rather unlucky board for BTU-cheng|pg||
nt|barbyh: not unreasonable to play for split honors|pg||

nt|brolucius: How much extra would you need in the West hand before you would swim a river of crocodiles?|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board now |pg||

nt|lestergold: do i see a double by Schifko?|pg||
nt|daman: S is making his partner pay a big price for competing      probably hoping he has gthe @H Ace|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: sorry but i do not understand this double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next match scheduled to start in exactly half an hour. Welcome back then|pg||

nt|brolucius: Again Kendrick is determined to let partner know of the good spades.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S   makes    but hard to reach unless north decides to transfer with 3@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: HI Al :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes its a wondeful service to all bridge fanatics|pg||
nt|drg: not my choice|pg||

mb|p|nt|wollies: hi folks |pg||
nt|hedyg: only bid 7+ card suits?|pg||
nt|robbg: Is there any nation in the world that has more good bridge per capita than Iceland?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so NS should pickup a few more here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s looks like no problem with lie of dims friendly|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|dburn: striped-tailed ape, since East-West can in fact make a slam, but...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brgpro: hoi mart|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hello Mart|pg||
nt|wollies: Hi Jack |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: EW seem to have copied the NS bidding system here :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: It looks like a relay auction|pg||
nt|brgpro: well...this is not an easy 6NT to reach...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but this 3NT can be a dangerous bid - now need 4@C by west to no lose the slam|pg||
nt|brgpro: westra made a very aggressive 3@c jump bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Today it seems you can make 12 tricks with two aces missing, and 13 with one ace missing :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would prefere 3@D by west over 2@H|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes, we can often finesse one of the Aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I would've bid 3@C too, but I'm a junior :) Nice distr. imo|pg||
nt|brgpro: but 3@c is GF....not my choice though|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@D by East, you mean?|pg||
nt|wollies: hard to reach now I think |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: If they do indeed miss it, the match is locked|pg||
nt|brgpro: is it open now??|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@S is the more probable slam to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Hardly :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT showing fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s would deny|pg||
nt|bobh1: i like S's 3n bid--a source of tricks and secure @c stopper|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it was interesting, and we end on a strong point with both N-S pairs bidding and making 3NT after an opposing opening bid. They did well.|pg||
nt|lestergold: in fact pobably make 3|pg||
nt|drg: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This result will make the tournament all the more exciting|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont like to use the bonkers word in this exalted company but with the square root of no defence what is he doing?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: north was likely to pass if South just bid 3@S after the transfer|pg||
nt|mariner1: Last but not least, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Sharon Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|wollies: I think they will reach  6 @S easier than 6 NT |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 5@D seems like voidwood|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Asking for P|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: to show his aces, but not the @DA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D is sure void|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Or maybe just telling p to bid the final contract|pg||
nt|ady: this looks pretty flat      cherio all|pg||
nt|mariner1: broadcasts. Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: lovers worldwide!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|thegarve: He did not get any credit for discovering the good ol' U S of A - like Stayman he did not discover the method e publicized it|pg||
nt|jwit: Bad lead for the defense|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brgpro: well, bridge players are funny...they bid a suit on the 5 level and everyone is saying he has NONE!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: lol|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D (void) in this situation is for sure  2 - 6 - 5 and it is a choose for the partner to bid the best final contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I hope 6@C is not meant as such...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would bid 4@C, leaving more space at my p to continue the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Who would then bid 4@D, which is of no use, I think|pg||
nt|wollies: maybe it will end here ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: It doesn't seem worse than 6@S to me|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West don't know the stong of the partner - he can have the same cards without Q in @C for example ...|pg||
nt|wollies: Cant be true  that Muller is  also thinking here ?? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: He's not, but there's a screen separating SW from NE|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: So I can't enter anything untill the tray has passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1 trick lost in each suit|pg||
nt|drg: likely 3 more imps to win by 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: al right one maybe trick|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|bridge_one: it seem a exploration run rather than a bridge auction|pg||
nt|bobh1: dont think ducking the @h was such a great idea|pg||
nt|brolucius: And completing 10 boards inside one hour gets a nod of approval from me.|pg||
nt|lestergold: will Jon drop the stiffy K?|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I knew it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: this 6@S is a invention - 5@D give at the partner the option to take the decision, so need to pass at 6@C now - East could have KQxxx in @S, so 6@C was OK, and 6@S nedd 3/3 ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem started with the choose of 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: But if 6@C missed the QJ(T), it's a disaster|pg||
nt|brgpro: no, pd rebid 2@s after 4th suit, has to be a good 5 card or 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Now Muller is thinking :)|pg||
nt|wollies: :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: over 5@D with xxx in @C East could bid 5@S, so 6 @C is a choose, isn't a forced bid|pg||
nt|brgpro: oh no!!!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, Muller is thinkink :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: tell him to lead the 4th card from his left hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Jack, do you play "GO" (weiqi in chinese) ?|pg||
nt|brgpro: little bit|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: That would be the nel (trump-9)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this auction remember me a waste tesuji of go :)|pg||
nt|wollies: what I thought  good C |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 9 hours for each player in go challenge - similar at this match ...|pg||
nt|brgpro: it takes 5 minutes to lead and 5 seconds( maybe even less) to finish the hand|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|hedyg: claim 10|pg||
nt|ady: 7 imps to n/s|pg||

nt|lestergold: no he was folled by the doubel so no overtrik|pg||
nt|daman: you have to be kidding|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: perhaps a little fortunate   many would have passed 2NT opening|pg||
nt|thegarve: must transfer - you may even have a 55@s fit|pg||

nt|gracelin: by, this is the reason I don't particularly enjoy Moscito.  any accidents.|pg||
nt|gracelin: many|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not sure the exact meaning of townsend's 2d bid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2@d multi with only 5 spades !!|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: i think is Multi|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kyosuke326: still a 6 or 7 IMPs pickup for BTU-cheng|pg||
nt|gracelin: but still 6-7 imps.  I also don't understand why 5D failed in closed room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure moscito is to blame per se, 2@D is too space consuming as a relay|pg||
nt|kyosuke326: yes, especially after @H first lead in the closed room|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe weak major with 5 card suit taking advantage of the Vul position|pg||
nt|lestergold: a kind of multi but it will have a few wrinkles of its own knowing them|pg||
pc|h2|nt|flash: assuming that the defense gets @Cs started before too many aces are knocked out, this isn't going to make|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer never led a spade toward the queen|pg||
nt|flash: as in @HA, @C honor...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lead has give the 9th trick away|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the double heart finesse he could have tackled himself in any case for the nonth|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: for specs who think East is strong for 3@D --  the only rule is that there are NO rules for 3rd seat preempts :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: reasonable auction i think, but... |pg||
pc|dK|nt|allanr44: now an entry|pg||
nt|jbgood: E will go on - unfortunately for him|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|chick: there are ways to take 9 tricks, but from W's hand, it sure looks grim|pg||
pc|dA|nt|flash: down 2...|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Cayne not very happy...|pg||
nt|chick: E tanking on slam ... he has nothing else to cuebid but doesn't want to give up|pg||
nt|sybarra: blasting into it in this room |pg||
nt|jbgood: going down head high - not down crawling..|pg||
nt|chick: or as my grandmother said,  better to be hung for being a wolf than for being a sheep|pg||
nt|jbgood: club lead not good for defense though|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: another pair bid and made 7c...|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=7&B=6&T=O|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like a di lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: tje 6|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hoping to endplay East with a heart instead|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is not fair, the team stopped in 2S won 6-7 imps over the team bid to 5D.|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry|pg||
nt|chick: I can't see any possible way to make this|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Gold-Townsend it seems..|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: bid the other 7c|pg||
nt|jbgood: there is a way - 3 spade rounds - 3 di rounds - heart king and h-- duck if N has not been on the alert|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|pbundy: as is so often the case when someone preempts- suits not breaking well for declarer|pg||
nt|mildredb: so true|pg||
nt|pbundy: nice try hoping for a singleton 9 or 10 in the west hand in the @H suit|pg||
nt|xenya: good guess in @Ss -- heading for overtrick now?|pg||
nt|allanr44: same heart guess as before|pg||
nt|allanr44: only for overtrick|pg||
nt|shevek: guess we'll see a good win by Lavazza (some will say: was about time)|pg||
nt|shevek: they just had a slow start :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|beauch: matt mullamphy no longer a junior - so his pre-empts are usually very sound|pg||
nt|flash: slam on 27 also a push|pg||
nt|flash: New Zealand now leading the event|pg||
nt|pbundy: might slip after this result. of course, so far no danger of slipping signficantly|pg||
nt|allanr44: yes, with trump break|pg||
nt|mariner1: in the other match its Yeh 10   China 23  with 2 boards to score|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=5&T=I|pg||
nt|mariner1: - for leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|lestergold: david may swich to spade then gower is in trouble unless he plays the ace|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chick: W passed originally then took the cheapest preference to hearts, so E is the one who went overboard on this one|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: director is here...for time|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|by: he doesn;t need @sQ, he has 4 side tricks, all he needs is 11 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't afford to lose 2 hearts tricks and that's what he did|pg||
nt|kyosuke326: yes, the declarer draw 3 rounds of trump in the closed room|pg||
nt|gracelin: may only make two here for 5 imps|pg||
nt|chick: Cayne is trying to think of any lie of the cards that would let him make this|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|allanr44: Board 19 might be a swing|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he knows the k is wrong he cant afford the heart thru|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|gracelin: e-round trumps were too many|pg||
nt|flash: West couldn't afford the @D pitch|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pbundy: right|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: he did|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: and he said SORRY|pg||
nt|flash: Traian, was the cow which flew by purple and spotted?|pg||
nt|allanr44: north was squeezed in majors on high club ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: W should know the hand to a card by now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gracelin: 3-round|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: looks like a flattie |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: carefully played by Gower|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h3|pc|s2|nt|chick: open room is on the last board, we have this and 2 more to play|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is still the knockouts,,,,,, top 15 + Yeh Bros advance,,, top 8 with no loss and|pg||
nt|mariner1: next 8 with one loss in dual elimination format|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h8|pc|s8|nt|jbgood: 2 @d and small heart:)|pg||
nt|chick: yep, you are right, N would be endplayed if he had to win the 2nd heart|pg||

nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|lestergold: swing inducing hand here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9 and 10 first in this room before comparisons from the closed room when we roll over to board 1|pg||
nt|daman: and we're off|pg||
nt|robbg: Starting with a dull one I see :)|pg||
nt|jwit: Interesting hand to start with|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: a no finesse slam|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: n/S likely to reach 4S |pg||
nt|drg: which makes from north on the J@D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9-10 in this room first before comparisons from the closed room when we roll over to board 1|pg||
mb|r|nt|hedyg: just play all your tops|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: The Shell team includes Cheek and Grue who won the Open Pairs yesterday..... and|pg||
nt|lestergold: if played by North may not get heart lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: Disa and Deas were 4th I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 6@H   or 6@D  on heart guess|pg||
nt|drg: the double will help|pg||
nt|lestergold: will nnow|pg||
nt|daman: EW can make 5@D or 5@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have played on teams with David Kendrick, many years ago. At that time he was partnered by Mike Pomfrey, who subsequently won £500,000 on Who Wants to be a Millionaire?|pg||
nt|robbg: I never pass and wait, but in this case I would make an exception like Fredin.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|wollies: Once played  against Muller ....inearly 90-ies     he was thinking  pl  10-12 minutes  and  we were in a hurry to change  tables   so we had to leave that table .....now  about 16- ...|pg||
nt|wollies: years  ago  he still has to play that card :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9-10 in this room first before comparisons from the closed room when we roll over to board 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: South obviously use 1@S to show the minors (or possibly a transfer), double to show any number of spades.f|pg||
nt|bobh1: NS probably playing the treatment that dbl shows 4+ @s's and 1s relates to the minors|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 dims on for E/W|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  16+|pg||
nt|daman: shifko should preempt|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobh1: as BroL says . . . |pg||
nt|lestergold: 5d better than c because u dont need to find qc necessarily|pg||
mb|p|nt|robbg: 3@c is awfully big, but may work well here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: One good rule is that you should never pass, with a trump stack, unless you intend to pass a subsequent re-opening double.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: Haha|pg||
nt|hedyg: might miss the Q@H once the Q@D drops singleton|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse the tansfers|pg||
nt|drg: no chance if south played it|pg||
nt|lestergold: so 1 off is predicted|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: E/W play precision 14-16nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: should be sunk off the top|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably will be off on most auctions only makes when east is on lead and finds a trump or dim lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: But you won't test diamonds first|pg||
nt|hedyg: makes longer @hs and thus the Q more probable in W|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot miss 4 @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you can't do that in a heart contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|drg: I'm not particularly fond of 1N with 4252, holding spades, and all the points in the long suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: well so much for sinking :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: am i imaginaing things|pg||
nt|daman: correct Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can Fredin find the lead against 3NT?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: 1NT denies 3@ss|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT not entirely secure.|pg||
nt|jwit: This will not be a success story|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nope|pg||
nt|daman: scroll up Roland|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: In normal methods, South's 2@H would be game-forcing, which his hand does not seem to merit.|pg||
nt|bobh1: the saving grace is I don't think anything makes|pg||
nt|robbg: Interesting 4@h bid by Fredin, one might expect 3@s|pg||
nt|jwit: I would have bid 3S with Fredin's hand rather than 4H.  Partner is allowed to have a stiff heart and four spades occasionally, especially on this auction, where neither of the ...|pg||
nt|jwit: opponents have shown spades|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|daman: hehehe|pg||
nt|mariner1: this works out and EW can make 5@C or 6@C if they envoked the Rabbi's Rule|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: did west ask for a heart lead and partnwer said i know better how about a diamond?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jwit: No, EW can make a few diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: How North's eyes must light up when he sees the @HQ-J in dummy.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe 2@H showed extra @ss|pg||

nt|beauch: ron klinger dreams he is still a junior - so he can bid with less!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think Jeff Meckstroth is a junior either -- but 'sound' isn't a word i've ever heard to describe ANY of his preemptive tactics|pg||
nt|mildredb: We've all been there & done that|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: :)|pg||

nt|mariner1: two more rounds in KO|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what advantage Rob if you qulify in the first 8|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: director just came...he said 10 minutes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: cheng gained 6 in board 23. Very tight finish|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: we can't emphasize enough the need to stay focused while you're at the table|pg||
nt|allanr44: As was noted, an unusual backwash squeeze|pg||
nt|chick: yes, and not easy for N to pitch his @HQ under the K|pg||
nt|jbgood: may use it nevertheless:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: england definitely doesn't want to lose THIS result|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: wow -- only 2 hands left :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D could actually be opened on VOID|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: he really wants a ruff with that?|pg||

nt|beauch: catch- all|pg||

nt|jbgood: 6 nt - come on!|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: 6 or 7@h? |pg||
nt|flash: unless their NT is 14-16, it would appear to qualify as an upgrade   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 7 if they can find it|pg||
nt|mildredb: luckily didn't open 1NT - as might end up in 3 & not liked the result|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: don't really care for 1N opening|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1st 8 enter next round win NO LOSSES  next 8 have ONE LOSS., double|pg||
nt|mariner1: elimination so top 8 can lose 1|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: England on a roll here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gracelin: but declarer can probably discard the 3rd H on a good diamond anyway|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gracelin: so that's 6 imps to USI-mixed, the lead changes hand again|pg||
nt|pbundy: again; i've been in worse slams|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: many pairs have the science to determine whether 2@S is 3 or 4 card support -- but Bertheau didn't care|pg||
nt|beauch: yes if peter only had 4@S he would check out with 2Nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and he's elated to see that his @H holding is golden|pg||

nt|xenya: me neither but looks like it's their style|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|dinos1: for 7 @sK shd be in @d, plus opener must have these @c's|pg||
nt|allanr44: didn't expect NT from south|pg||
nt|xenya: wrongsided but hardly matters here -- 3N seems to be on a @H finesse anyway |pg||
nt|shevek: 2@h I think was GF|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|allanr44: yes, but heart stopper?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|beauch: enquire about pds holding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hang on -- in the notes it actually says  1@D-1@S;2@S = 11-14, 4@H 3@S and some singleton or void|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so no guessing involved!|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: some imps back|pg||

nt|flash: might South have done more here?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: now not so easy to make|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: might be a bit awkward now|pg||
nt|xenya: he needs to come to hand with @DA and finesse trumps|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|allanr44: good|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: 10 past the hour the official time|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: last board here|pg||
nt|reisig: Maybe a swing here|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: anoather slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next set begins in about 30 minutes|pg||
nt|xenya: what do you bid as S now?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It's a very poor slam though|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: perhaps N's sequence promised a @H stopper -- 3@S looked like giving S a choice between 3N and 4@S|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: last board for today|pg||
nt|allanr44: fair comment|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: we will start again tomorrow 9.30 local time|pg||
nt|chick: NS would have to be swinging to bid this slam|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry folks - my analysis of the last brd was not at all god - needs a club return from N to make - a di leaves declarer with 2 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: next match starts in 30 mins from now|pg||
mb|1D|nt|xenya: no right answer i guess|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Ish in the tank|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: for a long time unusual for Ish|pg||
nt|xenya: a spectator suggests a pass -- would have worked nicely here, but dangerous in my opinion|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: true....but he is thinking "hard"|pg||
nt|allanr44: you are there Traian  :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahalim: but would you bid it Roland ?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Yes, because I know the layout|pg||
nt|lestergold: passed out in open!!|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: you want to play double dummy games, i dont lead diamonds immediately|pg||
nt|by: unfortunate @dA gave away 6@h on board 24|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are you going to drop the king next?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i lead club trick 2|pg||
nt|by: now, EW needs a big swing|pg||
nt|by: 2@d shows longer @h|pg||
nt|gracelin: on board 24, when the 4-3 fit 6C is cold but we predicted to be a push board, EW bid to the 6-1 6H but made on DA lead.  |pg||
nt|dinos1: 5@d or 4@h|pg||
nt|mildredb: last bd - next set in about 25 min|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3N by S and hope for @S lead :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: lol|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: assume 4N=takeout|pg||
nt|mariner1: England looking good in 3rd now... this will knock Global back as they are 5th now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|beauch: i expect n/s will bid to 3NT or 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: check http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event  for times given locally for viewer|pg||
nt|barbyh: why do they bid 2 cl ahead of their longer d suit|pg||
nt|reisig: Roland?  Bid slam?  NO WAY|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Otherwise not; much too good for me|pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|ahollan1: 2@C=art game force relay|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well....|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match now, and the end of our broadcast from Taipei|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many thanks again to Hao, our brilliant operator|pg||
nt|by: 2@s is not forcing, of course S will not let it go|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is the last board so I thk we can congratulate all BTU's for their excellent performance to win the top 3 position, especially to BTU-cheng, of course|pg||
nt|flash: although the hands didn't seem immensely challenging, these teams handled them well|pg||
nt|allanr44: not a lot to say.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: obvious the delay came from East -- so interesting Unauthorized Info possibilities if pull to 5@C|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|beauch: the swedes have been very successful with their relay bidding over many years|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D shows 5-7 zz w/ some singleton/void   -- sorry, I don't know "zz"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially finding out quickly if holding singleton/void|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Our matches in round 2 in about half an hour are: China B vs Norway and USA Hampson (Meckwell) vs Chinese Taipei|pg||
nt|barbyh: very interesting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told ZZ is what others call QPs [queen points] or AKQ points, where A-3, K=2, Q=1|pg||
nt|beauch: a standard 2/1 auction here - would not have much trouble either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Jacks go the way of the @C suit -- forgotten|pg||
nt|Walddk5: even with hearts no worse than 3-1, you need good things to happen in the minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: was still his only chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: 1N showed both majors, 2@c asked, 2@d showed longer @h, 2@s is non-forcing and invitational|pg||
nt|by: i think this shiould be over|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to all the commentators who guided us through the set|pg||
nt|gracelin: you should be happy, BY, Moscito win over the natural bidders. |pg||
nt|by: er...|pg||
nt|dinos1: how they'll solve @c problem here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H's thx to @H's 3/3|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5@d is best|pg||
nt|flash: any large margin in a match like this has to be viewed as a gift  :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: another very unfriendly hand|pg||
nt|allanr44: Thanks Traian.  Well done in tricky circumstances.  Raining there yet?|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|shevek: bite your tongue Allan|pg||
nt|allanr44: :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: i can not say... we are inside :)|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: last board here...see you soon|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Bo and Jarron Shih have been instrumental in setting up a fine show. Thanks to you too|pg||
nt|sybarra: same for 5 @D  really |pg||
nt|dinos1: no - for 5@d u need to ruff @c|pg||
nt|allanr44: I could echo some comments, the most concise being HA HA|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a little face saving her for the underdogs|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: i strongly suspect that every bid other than 1@H has been alerted :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kiwibridge: only 8 H to cash|pg||
nt|Walddk5: McGann: "Prefer for 6 discards"|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Prepare|pg||
nt|nickf: McGann just asked "No hearts partner" ?|pg||
nt|chick: I wouldn't because I play 1N Forcing always on|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|barbyh: oops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and even 1@H isn't really "standard" because it is limited to 15HCP|pg||
nt|beauch: 9 fast tricks:)|pg||
nt|allanr44: dear oh dear oh dear|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: see you all in 10 mins|pg||

nt|mariner1: Yeh Bros are currently 8th on the No Loss - One Loss bubble|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|beauch: yes but whole world would open 1@H these days|pg||
nt|allanr44: Thanks all.  Look forward to tomorrow|pg||

nt|barbyh: thx everyone|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: kudos to our vugraph operator!!|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: thx everyone...back in 30 mins|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if "zz" is Zar Points  A=4.15, K=3,, Q=1.5, J=0.5, then maybe 2@D was the wrong rebid|pg||
nt|beauch: ah thats 2 hard for me al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: me too|pg||
nt|beauch: anyway looks like good start for oz team here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even 4.5 [instead of mistype 4.15] makes it too tough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't count this Swedish team out -- i imagine they'll be near the top before the round robin is over|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: this is the last board here...next match in aprox 1h 50 min|pg||
