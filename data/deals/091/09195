nt|marlowepi: the 3D call really put N in the soup|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i'm not sure about that 3D overcall. might work well, but i would be nervous that it might push N into a phantom save|pg||
nt|cindy: so ending with a push    thx everyone    see you back in 40 minutes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cindy: turns out 5D would be good save|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|paulg: 3@d is pretty pure, perhaps too much so, so if partner sacrifices I don't think he could complain|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: well, i don;t think that's clear. N might save on some hands with only 3 diamonds, and then we might have 2 tricks in diamonds alone, which is two more than the norm for a weak JO ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|cindy: no no   not saying they should save|pg||
mc|11|nt|paulg: thanks all|pg||
