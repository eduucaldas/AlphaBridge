nt|Walddk2: But he asked me to get commentators, and I got 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so no worries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: all will be fine. starting in 2 hours and 40 mins right?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi All and Welcome to the 4th Vasil Levski Cup 2009, Karlovo, Bulgaria|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge.bg/en_UK/tournament21.html - Tournament Site - This is Match|pg||
nt|mariner1: Points 8 rounds of 3 boards each in two 12 board sessions.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Our commentators for 1st 12 boards are Mike Gold, Mike Graham, Martin Carroll,|pg||
nt|mariner1: David Edwin , and Roland Wald (Denmark)........... I am Rob Brown (USA)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good aftenoon all|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi Mike|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Mike, David|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi this is Mike from UK|pg||
nt|ady: hi Martin    Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi David|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I hope the screen is well hidden from the players. For security reasons, we usually do not display a board until all players are seated|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is all very confusing|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Roland and hi Mike|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like it takes a @H lead to beat 6 hearts here, not that you want to be in slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: except it makes if no @H lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hey Rob!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is matchpointed pairs, so every trick counts|pg||
nt|vugraphzjw: after few words for openning we are ready to start :) hello everybody|pg||
nt|ady: can actually make on a heart lead as well    set up diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Momchil Aleksandrov. Welcome to you too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lestergold: well requiringvery good behaviour in both red suits it should not really be bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C also can make here|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Momchil, could we have player names up, please|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 6N only depends on J hearts dropping and diamond fin esse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Click on each seat in turn and insert last name|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: but they ve stopped in a safe and sensible 3n which makes on any layout|pg||
nt|ady: any slam will require some luck|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But at matchpoints 4@H for once scores better|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mcarroll: as pointed out on a non @H lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: not if a @H is led though|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: do uthink there is any reason for anyone to be even trying for a slam here unless they are badl;y in need of mps!!|pg||

nt|santyclz: Hi folks, hi William.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: just in time, Gabor|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: this is the final (4 teams) 3 matches 20 boards each|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i think our operator is Krisztina|pg||
nt|cicus: szia Hedy, hello Vladimir|pg||
nt|pelu: X or bid 3@h?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: variable NT in NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|cicus: X may not be penalties anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H -- letting NS off the hook|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: Against the odds to make a move with the East cards in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: Guedes won the round robin and on yesterday 16-14 |pg||
nt|santyclz: An ugly 1nt with @cqj tight and no spots.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pelu: if pd X 1NT - then X by u sh be penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: would be a bloodbath|pg||
nt|athene: pushy 2@C here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Gad Chadha from England|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: I have a different agreement with my regular partner|pg||
nt|athene: not sure what east is planning to do if west unsportingly bids 2@D or 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Hi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and William FRisby, also from England|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: think 2@d 1 @c and 1 @h for 1 down|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: perhaps he has a way to sign off in 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Soucasaux is unstoppable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks as if that were  puppet.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: well even if penalty, it's not exactly clear-cut|pg||
nt|pelu: so we can bid free against u?|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol Peter|pg||
nt|cicus: no, we reopen with a X|pg||
nt|cicus: bid your shortest suit and you are saved|pg||
nt|pelu: u are forced to X gain? - then S can bid 2@S on a big hand!|pg||
nt|hedyg: if NT is 12-14 N must have A@c and K@H|pg||
nt|cicus: no we are not in a forcing situation after 1NT X|pg||
nt|cicus: rule is: don't pass if we may have game|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim 10?|pg||
nt|pelu: but then West has to take some action - he cant just wait and "hope" that pd we X again|pg||
nt|viren169: Hi william|pg||
nt|santyclz: Will be quite a change from last round where they studiously avoided bidding games.|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|cicus: the situation is similar to e.g. 1@C-2@S-p-p|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||

nt|mdgraham: interesting 1NT opening - 1@S certainly an alternative |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 1NT not my first choice as opening bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 8 likely tricks in 1N|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: those opening 1@S will get some competition likely|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|lestergold: will probably score better than 2s which on most defences will be held to 8 tricks too|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: that is close to what we do|pg||
nt|hedyg: as takeout of course|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT wouldn't be all that unreasonable with east but 1@D is ok|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Terrible 6@d with 1 redeaming feature: it can make|pg||
nt|athene: west will just bid 3nt i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good morning from Vancouver|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Hi|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|viren169: then I am a simple soul!|pg||
nt|athene: i wouldn't bother looking for a 5-3 major fit with that west hand|pg||
nt|athene: N-S are likely to power into 4@H here|pg||
nt|santyclz: N's @ss are more valuable on offense than he anticipates.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: 4333 and plenty of hcp|pg||
nt|athene: well, there are ways 4@H might make|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: after @SA lead, though, west can see the necessity of a fast diamond switch|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|pelu: when u X before the suit: X is values - when u X after the suit more penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: I agree|pg||
nt|athene: even if you find partner with a 5-card major there's no guarantee it will be better than 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3 @c asks for majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3nt No 5 card no 4 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 2@D=any game force|pg||
nt|viren169: although if pd has 5233 shape 4@S may be better...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i don't see much downside to 3@C|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: 3@D = 2-3-5-3 - no 3 card @S|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: now @DA and @D10 should fall out of his hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: declarer will surely play the clubs the right way, to protect the @SQx|pg||
nt|athene: lead @CA then @CJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: He will protect the @s Q so will guess @c|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cicus: one way of two-way checkback|pg||
nt|xenya: may be an exact tie after this board|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: easy @c lead and 10 tricks or will he shift to @H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would 2NT be 3343, Peter?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
nt|viren169: nice play|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cicus: not now, S encouraged clubs|pg||
nt|athene: now @DK then diamond to the ace|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d7|nt|athene: just in case south has a singleton @DJ/@D10|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: three discards are no use; the club finesse can't be avoided|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|pelu: no - 2Nt is also 2-3-5-3 - but a bad @D-suit|pg||
nt|athene: then the layout is revealed and you can take the finesse|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Depends on agreement|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Karlovo is a picturesque and a historically important town in central Bulgaria located in a fertile valley along the river Stryama at the southern foot of the Balkan Mountains|pg||

nt|viren169: nice competitive hand now|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C P 1@H now east should bid 2@D i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 14 board match is starting|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: when it comes to overcalling, a good suit compensates for anything|pg||
nt|viren169: or 3@D... not for the faint-hearted!|pg||
mb|d|nt|santyclz: X or 1@s?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: of course if north just bids 3nt that might shut east out :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: No chance...|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S looks normal to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: if you are 2-3-4-4  you open 1@C and rebid 3@D over 2@D to show that shape|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1@C - then u bid 3@D on 2-3-4-4, and 2NT on 2-3-3-5 and bad suit, 3@C on an good suit|pg||
nt|viren169: North saw it coming!|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT Jordan, showing a sound raise to 3@D|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: sensible bid from west|pg||
nt|athene: with 5-loser hand|pg||
nt|athene: nothing to the play:- one trick to lose in each major|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how anyone can be considering doing anything over 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the thing about bashing 3nt in here is, you don't especially want to shut out east from mentioning a long suit|pg||
nt|athene: because he is on lead anyway|pg||
nt|viren169: small diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Sry for the delay (connection problems)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: this is the north final championship, final 4 3 matches 20 boards each|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|hedyg: so cannot differentiate between 2 3 4 4 and 2 2 4 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2245 is not a balanced hand|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@C then 3@D looks 2245 to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's semi-balanced|pg||
nt|pelu: no I dont like to open 1NT with 2-2 i major|pg||
nt|hedyg: you would not bid 1NT after 1@C-1@s?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that both north players doubled|pg||
nt|santyclz: N could be considering a x on the empirical unlikelihood of 1 side making 11 tricks on any given hand.|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: yes, small diamond was definitely preferable with no entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: agree not the best lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a different auction perhaps top diamond correct|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but here next to zero chance north has only 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: true, 11 tricks is a lot|pg||

nt|cicus: chance for a swing hewre|pg||
nt|viren169: slam hand... off to the races here|pg||
nt|athene: north hand is hard to express in most systems|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: but when a side actually bids 5 of something that might change the a priori odds somewhat|pg||
nt|athene: however little respect you have for their bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: both ways perhaps|pg||
nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: too good for weak 2|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|athene: 2@S might show a weak 2-suiter but this might lose the important sixth spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 2 @s is @s and a minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well that simplifies things, matos will ace ask|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure S with still push to the 5 level...|pg||
nt|viren169: great...|pg||
nt|athene: east doesn't have a bid, really|pg||
nt|athene: so he will choose between double and 1@S i guess :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps MacskÃ¡sy could have bid 5@H en route rather than punt 6@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW bidding @Hs helps S|pg||
nt|cicus: after 2@H here @CQ is a favourite to score|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It did not in the CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: careful pass by W|pg||
nt|xenya: but you don't really bid grand missing the trump Q?|pg||
nt|cicus: no but if the auction is crowded you can't pay attentiom to nuances|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Vladimir, but N could have had it but with no chance to raise when partner jumps to 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS not a regular partnership, is 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|xenya: true, Roland|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@S is forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: without agreements 2@S is surely forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a method for showing this hand after 2@S opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: diff bid in N - has to bid 3@C - but pd will take is as a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need an agreement if it's not|pg||
nt|viren169: now 6 will be easy when (if) diamonds is found as second suit|pg||
nt|athene: now south has to do something|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south assumes he is facing only five spades, so will probably ask for the @SQ |pg||

nt|xenya: hope they know what they are doing...|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S reached in the open room|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: with the @SQ and nothing else, north would just bid 6@S, so 6@H shows extras|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|pelu: a jump to 6@C (in my system) = 2 Aces plus a void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know what ORKC is, but you had better explain. Many in the audience don't know I'm sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: orkc= option roman keycard|pg||
nt|cicus: Optional Roman Key.Card asking for aces|pg||
nt|cicus: optional, because it also asks about strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT....|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1st step agrees to slam, if other bid than 1st step then dont want slam but show number of keycards|pg||
nt|cicus: 1st step usually weak hand and other responses show aces|pg||
nt|pelu: on 4Nt I jump in the void-suit if lover that trumfp - and jump to 6 in your suit if higher|pg||
nt|viren169: whay 6@H and not 6@C?|pg||
nt|athene: but south, not being able to see all the hands and knowing there's a keycard missing, has no grand slam ambitions|pg||
nt|athene: south can't have been happy about passing throughout|pg||
nt|athene: but he didn't have any convenient bid|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps north is worried that 6@C might be taken as his second suit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: i would probably risk 3@D over 2@S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzkc: Sousa Guedes won the round Robein|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Robin|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cicus: maybe Hedy's version is more popular|pg||
nt|athene: showing extra length/strength there|pg||
nt|viren169: North passed at the other table, and drove to slame via RKCB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps 6 of a minor would offer a choice of slams|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: time to claim|pg||

pc|h4|nt|vugraphzkc: Ribeiro is a "new team" on these finals|pg||

nt|athene: but usually without special agreement, if you pass over a suit then later double, partner is going to assume it's penalties|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|viren169: a little pushy but it is imps after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would certainly bid 2@S with west's hand over 1@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nobody seems to assume x's are penalty any more.|pg||
nt|athene: it worries opps when you bid their suits|pg||
nt|athene: and it usually works out just fine|pg||
nt|athene: as long as you have a decent suit|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: in theory south has more room now but that might not be a bonus if he hasn't discussed these sequences|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: X for penalty, but I dont exp that S will accept - 4@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H problematic here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Budapest a great city. Buda on one side, Pest on the other side of the river Donau|pg||
nt|cicus: or vice versa|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt keeps things simple|pg||
nt|athene: south has a stopper in the unbid suit|pg||
nt|athene: but it's one of the BID suits which will be the problem|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzkc: and now what?|pg||
nt|athene: if you start with double, you have to know what all your follow-up actions are|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: hehe|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Ed.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: howdy all!|pg||
nt|othered1: Assume the 1@S bid is essentially a forcing NT response|pg||
nt|santyclz: Marrku.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 1 @s is 0-4 @s forcing one round|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or else a great vul vs not psyche.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@SX in CR, E overcalled...2@s|pg||
nt|athene: when you have one suit with an ace and one without, it's normal to lead the non-ace suit, but it's also normal to prefer a 5-card suit, so east had a close decision there i think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond shift now|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... I would have lead a @S... |pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes and declearer has to go for ! s first I think|pg||

mb|1S|nt|cicus: 4@D as fit-showing?|pg||

mb|3N|nt|cicus: I think it was natural|pg||
nt|xenya: has to bid 5@H now|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D was natural|pg||
nt|hedyg: showing 10+|pg||
nt|xenya: danger now|pg||
nt|cicus: S has a good hand but worthless 5 points in spades|pg||
nt|pelu: need a @C-lead to defeat 5@H - impossible to find|pg||
nt|cicus: so shouldn't be tempted|pg||
nt|xenya: didn't N show something stronger than he has?|pg||
nt|hedyg: well...beauty is in the eye of the beholder|pg||

nt|xenya: sure -- but not too many high cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: points shmoints|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree that he is too good for 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: This shouldn't be very eventful and the lead of either long suit can cost a trick|pg||
nt|mmmakela: small S? or dias?|pg||
nt|othered1: if dec larer can read the position|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh well.  Was expecting a low @s from n, low @d from dmy and a test on how smoothly n could duck.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 3@C seems better than that delayed double|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: can S count on the @HA, for example?|pg||
nt|pelu: Is S looking for 2Aces or 1S-void by pd?|pg||

pc|c8|nt|athene: it would have been raised to 4, i guess|pg||

nt|cicus: not sure about that|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cicus: one of my advisors says it is 17-18 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S was just natural i am sure|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S was signoff, i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: he assumed 4@H was a splinter, either singleton or void|pg||
nt|viren169: I think N is living dangerously!|pg||
nt|athene: so he doesn't have anything|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|xenya: abot what W actually has|pg||
pc|h7|nt|santyclz: N didn't keep a low @d?|pg||
nt|viren169: .either red suit will allow Declarer to claim quickly|pg||
nt|athene: north would have been better-off just bidding 5@H over 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart lead 12 with no guess|pg||
nt|viren169: yes I agree|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i have heart void, great hand, but neither minor-suit ace"|pg||
nt|athene: and hence must have solid trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: they got it there anyway ...|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cicus: but then I can't understand 3@D - why not pass 2NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so E could have pulled the brakes in 3@H|pg||
nt|viren169: anyone for stone age 2@S over 1@C?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: unfortunately this should go 2 off|pg||
nt|athene: east did well to lead a trump, i think|pg||
nt|athene: north decides to just hope his partner has the @DA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzkc: yes sry|pg||
nt|athene: he knows a heart lead might well give declarer a free @HAQ finesse|pg||
nt|athene: (west didn't double 5@H to show an honour, and north is void)|pg||
nt|athene: and if north is void in hearts he has length in one or other minor so a minor-suit lead could solve his side-suit problems|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is a 2@S bid, will wait awhile to use that bid again|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer should get it right in the end... considering East bid 2@H |pg||
nt|athene: i don't mind a strong jump shift response with north's hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C - 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes. Declarer as to guess but he will|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't supposed to use the bid on a 2-suiter but north can happily just treat that hand as a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|athene: but probably they don't play strong jump shifts - no-one seems to, these days|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... bets to treat it as single (solid) suiter|pg||
nt|viren169: works v nicely on this hand!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Neves is thinking|pg||
nt|viren169: also 6@S in the open room... but A@D lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: ok mhere we go|pg||

nt|ady: 1 diamond and 1 spade loser in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk5: N-S never bid in the other room|pg||
nt|othered1: a cautious 5@C, perhaps fearing 4@S would be 5=5 black?|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: wow!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: @d lead wont be good|pg||

nt|santyclz: Unless you pitch a @s on the @ds.|pg||
nt|athene: you don't open 1@C with 55 in the minors, just so you can reverse :)|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead will make things easy|pg||
nt|athene: you look at the @D9 and claim 12 :)|pg||

nt|cicus: would not be surprised if N passed, though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i pass 2@D|pg||

nt|athene: north might just settle for 3NT over that but it's a bit wet|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|nt|hedyg: 3@c could be artificial?|pg||
nt|othered1: A relay system should handle this trivially in about 12 rounds of bidding|pg||

nt|athene: yes, if it had gone 2@H P P east might well have doubled, in the passout seat|pg||
nt|athene: but the multi changes the tempo|pg||
nt|athene: passing the multi was also worth considering and might have worked out well|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: no, it is 5-5 GF|pg||
nt|pelu: the close match - same good - and bad - bids in both room|pg||

nt|viren169: Interesting dbl by North!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is north thinking|pg||
nt|athene: that wld be lots of fun|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: north's double of 2NT is very strange|pg||
nt|viren169: careful play will bring in 2N|pg||
nt|athene: to double 2NT, you should have reasonable hopes they can't make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a little care required but always 8  tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: good match, good bridge|pg||
nt|athene: boo|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: south for the time being assumed a weak hand opposite|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: NEXT...|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N is amazingly conservative|pg||
nt|ady: 4 diamonds a better choise|pg||
nt|othered1: The @SK in partner's long suit usually is worth it weight in gold.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: I think the key is to find KQ in front of all those cards...|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: it will not work for N/S...|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzkc: probably 4 @d would help more...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: trump lead looked automatic with those @ss|pg||
nt|viren169: it was a hasty dble... would probably had a chance to dble 3N or 4@S!!!|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: two rounds of hearts, then spade to hand, @HK|pg||
nt|athene: even if east didn't have the @S10 you could probably strip-squeeze north in the blacks|pg||
nt|athene: to lead up to the @CK|pg||
nt|athene: a heart lead wld have led to 12 tricks i think|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think north did anything but show @D of some type and a bunch of points of some sort.   |pg||
nt|Walddk5: flat, 6@H in the OR|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|s2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: a top heart and it's easy; a low heart and that gives declarer 11 fast tricks with several options for 12|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d4|nt|xenya: now the plan looks clearcut -- 2@Hs, 4@S (including 2 ruffs), 2@D (including a ruff) and a natural trump ytick|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs asking re 4@hs, there is a slight @d problem |pg||
nt|athene: east, holding all three side-suits, is still going to get minced on the clubs|pg||

nt|santyclz: I would make an early @d pitch, hoping declarer has the j.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: if he throws a diamond, he will have to give a trick to the @CK for +1|pg||
nt|viren169: I think North is wondering why he dbled in the 1st place!|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: no reason not to throw club jack however|pg||

nt|athene: 1@C 1@H X Pass 1NT should end it, i guess|pg||
mb|1N|nt|santyclz: Stopping in 6 is good evaluation if you're going to play @hs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: N doubled in CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: and they stopped in 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: upgrade to 1nt opener is reasonable enough|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cicus: bold|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that's true|pg||
nt|othered1: With a student it could start 2@C - 3@D (6-card suit with at least an honor trick in it) plus side K or more.  Gets relatively easy after that, though the @CQ might be hard to ...|pg||
nt|othered1: find.  This for play in @D or NT on slam hand|pg||
nt|athene: majors or spades from south now|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... 1N-3N for me|pg||
nt|athene: unless he passes, sulking, after the previous board|pg||
nt|viren169: assuming South passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: west not sulking|pg||

nt|viren169: 2@C=majors or single suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: single suit|pg||
nt|viren169: West may find out 1st before bidding 3N... as South is on lead|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|hedyg: 2NT is not jacoby, it is invite +|pg||

mb|2N|nt|viren169: prefer pass and see what happens|pg||
nt|athene: win in dummy, diamond to the @D8 perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: win in dummy and low to diamond nine?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@c was minimum|pg||

nt|viren169: this may go poorly now...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: declarer was hoping to snag a stiff diamond honour with south|pg||
nt|athene: but probably, on balance, small diamond to the @D8 was best - it's very unlikely they can cash four hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@H dbled went 2-off on the last in the other room...|pg||
nt|viren169: the T and 9 seems like hugh cards... |pg||

nt|ady: yes agree|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: but still the bid sh be alerted - Hungary is not the World :)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe this board will turn things around|pg||
nt|santyclz: But 3 10s this time.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|hedyg: lol Gabor|pg||
nt|athene: only two obvious losers (@CK @HA) but nothing like 11 winners|pg||
nt|athene: just @D @D @H to lose|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: if you ruff enough hearts the @C10 grows up for the defence's third trick|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe the operator missed it|pg||
nt|cicus: sometimes they get sloppy with their alerts|pg||
nt|hedyg: or maybe they have done so earlier and now opps know so no need to keep alerting the same bid|pg||
nt|santyclz: I have to confess I don't understand the 3@s bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: pessanha is thinking... (can I have any chance on winning....) doesÂ´t seems so|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cicus: best return|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|athene: a trump back now and declarer has to just concede two heart tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|santyclz: Balanced hand, lousy suit, good defensive values it doesn't seem right to me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: I just saw a revoke.... (pessanha ruffed the @d)|pg||
nt|ady: South has shown up with enough to suppose north has king of clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: So I canÂ´t continue playing the cards...|pg||
nt|ady: what happens in that instand?|pg||
nt|ady: instant|pg||
nt|santyclz: So -3 instead of -2?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=4509  GyÃ¶rgy Szalay|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: the defence never get in to draw the third trump|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|athene: declarer could just have played @CJ throwing spade, club ruff, @SK, spade to ace, spade ruff, for 10 sure tricks|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ady: 4 spades a make     5 of a minor a make for n/s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Nik|pg||

nt|mariner1: hi I meant :)|pg||
nt|ady: hi Nik|pg||
nt|Walddk2: E-W must save against 5m|pg||
nt|ndemirev: sorry if I would repeat if someone said it before: |pg||
nt|ady: par is 5X spades down 1     or 5 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzjw: http://neo-bridge.org/karlovo/karlovo09.htm for running scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|ndemirev: in Bulgaria precision is the "std" system to play |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: N found the spot for them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but may push opp into winning decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzjw: yes... for example 2@C openning is not accepted to be alerted|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ndemirev: it seems easiest to become comfortable with; so you'll notice 80+% of the pairs playing a form of prec  |pg||
mb|4S|nt|mariner1: 1 point seperates NS and EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: kibbers noting @H are in the 4 - 7 position|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with the N hand it could easily pay to go slower. for one thing, you might catch partner with long diamonds and club shortness, so 5C gets you to the wrong game. also if you let ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: them bid 4M they may double you in 5m. Here N's preempt backfired, because W was unwilling to double before showing his hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: one lead you make 4@H and another you make 7@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|ndemirev: after each round or with the standing of preceding round (usually done to speed up the tournament)|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||

nt|viren169: b|pg||
nt|athene: north might double i suppose after 1@D - 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: but it's quite pushy|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 3N was made at the other table on board 12|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: e/w can make 4 @h |pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 3@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Endplayed because of @d9 on the k.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: and 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 3nt made on 12 in the other room|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: good prediction Gabor|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1@h by s.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Slam on a finesse. Opportunity for Gamax to take the lead|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: might end sadly|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1nt shows 5+@ss, unlimited.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: south started with @HAK and another and declarer crossed to dummy and played a diamond to the @D8 in approved fashion :)|pg||
nt|viren169: dont like splintering with an ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 4 @c is @h support and short in @c |pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: me neither...|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D some flavour of Bergen|pg||
nt|athene: showing a decent 4(+) card spade raise|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: E can't move i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, 3NT can be most anything over 3@S, so no way Winkler could move|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT a it on the heavy side|pg||
nt|hedyg: a bit|pg||
nt|ady: better limit his hand now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Pass would do that well.|pg||
nt|viren169: although I cant think of an alternative bid?!?!|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H is quite interesting to play but should come to 11 tricks i should think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3NT is wide-ranging over 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: that's what Ribeiro did|pg||
nt|athene: now all roads lead to 11 tricks for a flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: same bidding in CR|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe 4@H is fine...|pg||
nt|athene: small spade lead is possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Think will get a coffe ...|pg||
nt|athene: through the strong hands's fragment|pg||
nt|viren169: milk and sugar for me thks|pg||
nt|athene: hope for @SKJx in dummy (it's there) and @SQ with partner (unlucky)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzkc: :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: 22 is unusual|pg||
nt|ady: club r eturn best|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cicus: W did not have much choice|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: but not unreasonable with passed pd|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mmmakela: best|pg||
nt|ady: cust from any spade trick|pg||
nt|ady: continue club|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|c8|pg||
nt|xenya: tough after 3@S|pg||
nt|cicus: he could have doubled but what t bid over 4@D?|pg||
nt|viren169: poor lead when holding most of the outstanding values!|pg||
nt|viren169: need to attack here...|pg||
nt|athene: ducking the @DK might make things a bit harder for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: he might run the @D10 and then take a ruffing finesse to the @DK if you are very lucky|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: 4NT to play|pg||
nt|athene: if north ducks, declarer can throw the @D7 on the @CK, ruff club, exit diamond, endplaying north if he had the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: but if he rises the @DA he sets up the @DQ for a heart pitch from dummy anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so this is a Morten's Fork coup|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|ady: still down 1    |pg||
nt|athene: it's just completely unnecessary as the @HA is right all along :)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if 4NT is natural then (probably should be), you don't want to play there opposite nothing|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cicus: I would need more HCP for that|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or would be if n had the @ha.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Right|pg||
nt|hedyg: N has disced his @cs|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|ady: should have covered 9@H|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can claim when both follow to this trump|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Score not entered on 14, Momchil|pg||
nt|ndemirev: 2h is porbably H+ another 55|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5SW-1|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 2@H is Muiderberg/Tartan type  5 5 less than opening values|pg||
nt|ndemirev: will never remember this name :) |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: well since 4@H has play this one also up for grabs......|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|mariner1: take the @S hook as you can always pitch on the @SA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ndemirev: 2@H looks like the best Mps spot for EW|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||

nt|hedyg: push|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: yes it seems so|pg||
nt|ady: could not be closer|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 to go?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 3NT by N/S here I think|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D, double, pass - now what will West do?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: CR in 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but this seems like a pretty dull 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is better than 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: what would they say is the bid by N?|pg||
nt|athene: N-S might get to 4@S here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|santyclz: 2@c if playing inverted.|pg||
nt|ady: 28 ots   and 3NT in jeopardy on a spade lead    can make with hearts well played and breaking|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: 2 @c is inverted minors|pg||
nt|ady: placed|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: bingo|pg||
nt|viren169: redbl|pg||
nt|athene: probably 2@S |pg||
nt|athene: if west passed the double, then north might redouble yes|pg||
nt|athene: of course east has to actually double for any of this to become relevant :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: come on, east!|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt shows that north is going to rebid 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: showing a 3-card limit raise|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: west is a few diamond spots short of a pass, i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: results after 1sr match: Henriques - 19; Guedes - 16;  Ribeiro - 14; Matos - 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: matos - 11|pg||
nt|viren169: I think West will bid 2/3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: much better|pg||
nt|hedyg: most of all because it makes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so can 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: and with a 14 count south will bid game over that|pg||
nt|santyclz: Probably a 3@s rebid.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|viren169: dont like the diamond pips|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oops, too slow.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cicus: interesting rebid, 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: light, very light 2 @s by Pinto|pg||
nt|santyclz: Please check that, Pedro.|pg||
nt|ady: gone wrong|pg||
nt|viren169: 3N is an interesting contract!|pg||
nt|athene: lovely lead problem for north now|pg||
nt|athene: clearly he can't lead spades, hearts, diamonds or clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: @C lead?|pg||
nt|athene: i like this :) not a bad choice|pg||
nt|viren169: great lead!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: he went out of table:)|pg||
nt|viren169: will South put the Q or the T in?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: vs 4@H i meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: is correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some work to do here for sure|pg||
nt|santyclz: Don't lead trump.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: No problem|pg||
nt|athene: well played Von hafe|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: i don't think declarer has time to do everything|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: You win the second club, cash 1 high heart and play 3 rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: wow... West did well!|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|athene: he wants to finesse spades and set up diamonds|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think only on a trump lead.|pg||
nt|athene: and the defence will be able to get two hearts and a club going|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: W thinks...|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the lead was so long in coming....|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: now not only did he get that right but he knows north's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: not that much|pg||
nt|athene: better not to waste the dummy entry on playing a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: you can lead diamonds from either hand, but spades only from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: ducking at trick 1 had to be better|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: got a @s lead|pg||
nt|athene: it's a hand with no appealing suit to lead from - so an unsupported honour in every suit|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: to preserve the options in clubs - club ruff or use @CA as entry to winning diamonds|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: east can't attack hearts - if he leads the @HK you duck|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: mayh go wrong|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|xenya: so an imp to the trailing team|pg||

nt|vugraphzkc: it will guess wrong due to the "s bid I think|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|athene: north has to drop the @CA (the card he is known to hold) so that west doesn't know he can ruff another club with impunity|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|santyclz: Well at the 3/4 mark it's till anyone's game.|pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: E in CR bd 6@c over 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jackpot|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the last board of this session.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: no 20 boards|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: (still)|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 3N or 4@S E/W way anyone?|pg||
nt|athene: now west will probably go 2@S|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: or, of course, 3nt :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: Pinto bid is that: just bid what think u can make |pg||
nt|athene: most likely it will make four spades, two hearts, @CAK , @DA|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: now might get too high|pg||
nt|cicus: what is 4NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't matter; they need to bid 7 anyway to overtake|pg||
nt|santyclz: I fearlessly predict a @c lead.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: whether it makes or not is irrelevant when they are in 6 next door|pg||
nt|athene: well, @CA lead beat 4@S as well|pg||
pc|c9|nt|viren169: 3@S by West to show 3?|pg||
nt|athene: heart lead to @HK, another heart...declarer comes to the @CA and leads @SQ, covered|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: can escape down 3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: So 7@C is the right call|pg||
nt|Walddk2: given the SOTM|pg||
nt|xenya: can it be made?|pg||
nt|viren169: now 3N...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|xenya: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: or yes?|pg||
nt|cicus: no only 11 tricks without giving up a diamond|pg||
nt|xenya: reverse dummy plus squeeze against S dfoesn't works as there are no entries to the W hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to my excellent co-commentators, David Edwin, Markku Mekela and the dear departed Ed Shapiro.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|athene: north knows his partner doesn't have great hearts (no 1@H overcall) but the heart lead still looks natural enough|pg||
pc|s2|nt|viren169: good choice!|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|viren169: and a club switch looks in order!|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: But, you have seen wrong discards before|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: even with the spades coming in declarer needs another trick in one of the other suits|pg||

mb|p|nt|ndemirev: actually i would bid 3d |pg||
mb|2D|nt|mariner1: no games could see phantom saves|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: i very much dislike XX with a fit -- prefer to show it immediately and let partner evaluate his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjw: after openning with 9 points it is always easy to evaluate ... pass until the end of the World :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: S knows he opened weak.... so is timid here|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mariner1: now who gets shoved too high?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Higher and higher, Now we've learned to play with fire, Go higher and higher and|pg||
nt|mariner1: higher - Moody Blues|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ndemirev: I think DBl with West's hand started it on the wrong foot |pg||
nt|mariner1: N has the problem since he knows 4@S will not make........|pg||
nt|vugraphzjw: the moment of truth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3s seems clear|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems well suited for a jump Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzjw: 3@S is down 1|pg||
nt|ndemirev: yes , perhaps not available - I wonder |pg||

nt|Walddk2: I think I can find 1 or 2 of the 100 bids here I agree with|pg||

nt|ndemirev: 4S is the life boat for EW |pg||
nt|vugraphzjw: and it is Ralitsa's turn to save NS :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: e/w made a mistake with the initial X -- n/s compounded it with the XX -- now everyone is guessing|pg||
nt|mariner1: can W DBL here or even pass?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: so was N inviting slam with her sequence. basically 1S-D-4S|pg||

nt|athene: but it's not a 12-count your eyes light up over|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: Any theory experts out there?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|santyclz: On board 15 e neglected to bid 2@s so of course led one and set 3nt.|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT wsent down in other room on board 15  with that fortunate heart position|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: Do they make 6 @d?|pg||

pc|d2|nt|athene: most of the time there isn't much in it|pg||
nt|athene: but with that hand, pass is pretty much the only sensible option|pg||

nt|mariner1: Momchil why was the director called?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty easy 6H bid over 4H. if E can jump missing all these high hearts, he will have club ace or a pointed king|pg||
nt|vugraphzjw: Kibitzer made comment before 4@s call was made|pg||
nt|henryb: I would have bid Blackwood over 4@h for that reason|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so WE can say in his own defence that his Pass was inadvertent, and his 6H bid was an obvious correction once he realized what he had done & opps foolishly gave hiom another ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: chancer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 boards remain|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our next live broadcast is in 55 minutes from Portugal|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you bid blackwood, chances are enormous you will hear one keycard. that doesnt tell you about the pointed kings. but you already know about that from the 4H bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And after that, in 2 hours and 55 minutes, the Ywh Bros Cup from Australia|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yeh|pg||
nt|henryb: I would take the chance as you said that partner has (a) a pointed K, or (b) the @cA, or (c) the opponents do not find a @d as opposed to a @s lead|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: zusamen 1/10|pg||

mb|d|nt|ady: I thin 5@D a good insurance |pg||
nt|ady: think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|ady: east likely to lead a heart|pg||

nt|santyclz: In these matches there have been far more x's of making contracts than those going down.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|athene: declarer can't make this, amazingly|pg||
nt|athene: despite having 6 top tricks and a winning club finesse|pg||
nt|athene: he can't get to dummy to finesse or endplay the defence to help him out|pg||

nt|athene: you can ruff the clubs good for a heart pitch|pg||
nt|athene: you need a spade ruff so you have to play south for precisely @DAQ tight or @DAx, i think|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C|nt|mariner1: Da Vinci|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Down 1|pg||
nt|ndemirev: looks like it but not straightforward to defend|pg||
nt|ndemirev: say after @C lead @D is played off dummy and if N fails to rise A ... |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But North would have switched to hearts before|pg||
nt|Walddk2: at trick 2|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ndemirev: possibly|pg||
nt|ndemirev: let's see|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: I suspect he will switch to the @dA because @h tricks are not going anywhere|pg||

nt|ady: missed some of last hand      got the club ruff for down 2   instead of the heart trick|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|athene: last board now|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S by E/W here|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: last one. Thanks all. We will be back in about 15 min|pg||
nt|athene: E-W will bid spades and N-S diamonds...hard to say where the music will stop|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: for the last segment|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: but the non heart  lead  was surprising|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: This could go out with a bang.|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|viren169: may get N/S to bid 5@D?|pg||
nt|athene: judging by board 10, it will stop a while after it should have done :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east, with 10 black cards, is entitled to hope for a fit somewhere|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: north passed over 1@C??|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: yes|pg||
nt|athene: but will be disappointed :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ady: 3 clubs now  should end the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkc: pessanha is thinking|pg||
nt|ady: surely cant be thinking of bidding on   partner has shown some values in his void  and he has a light opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: but think 3 @c is the limit...|pg||
nt|ady: surely must be   otherwise Pinto cant compete    and his is not shy   |pg||
nt|viren169: diamonds lost now...|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzkc: oops|pg||
nt|athene: but apart from only have 2-2 in his partner's suits, west's hand is actually quite suitable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: Maybe Pessanha has lost his pass cards|pg||
nt|athene: *only having|pg||
mb|5C|nt|santyclz: And, in fact 6@ss can make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Gave his pd a stiff @s.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: ok. once again thx all. See u tomorrow at 15.15 london time|pg||
nt|athene: well, i know diamonds are a minor suit, but it's not actually illegal to bid those yet|pg||
nt|athene: soon it will be, no doubt|pg||
nt|athene: even 7@S|pg||
nt|athene: or 7NT|pg||
nt|athene: or 7@C|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry - 7NT isn't making i don't think|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7nt is as easy as 7@cs.|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it makes on some cute line but there's only 12 obvious tricks, as you are missing a dummy entry to untangle both black suits|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, yes.|pg||
mb|5H|nt|viren169: not yet... may be in the US!|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|athene: meanwhile, back at the actual auction, i am not sure what is going on, and i am not sure E-W do either|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D ought to be a cue for one black suit or other|pg||
nt|athene: east might think 4@D agrees clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but in that case 5@C is a huge underbid|pg||
nt|santyclz: That's what I was thinking, but the 5@c bid seemed to rule it out.|pg||
mb|6S|nt|viren169: the Americans love their majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: thx Pedro|pg||
nt|athene: this auction (2nt opener, transfer, then 4minor) is very tricky and often causes problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you don't always have room to agree both suits below game|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: on this auction, for instance, over 4@C, west has two red bids available so you might play 4@D = good clubs, 4@H = good spades, 4nt = no fit|pg||
nt|athene: but if the minor was diamonds that wouldn't be possible|pg||
nt|athene: you could just say that any new suit agrees the minor - you can't have a massive hand for the major as you didn't super-accept|pg||
nt|athene: but as always the critical thing is to discuss with partner|pg||
nt|athene: well, the opening lead solves one of declarer's problems|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: thx all|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzkc: can he make now?|pg||
