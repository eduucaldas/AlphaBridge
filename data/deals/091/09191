nt|mariner1: Hi Barbara|pg||
nt|barbyh: Hi Rob nice to see you|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like momentum should carry EW to 6S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi Barbara|pg||
nt|frankaus: this one should get the pulses moving|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6S X probably|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|barbyh: absolutely|pg||
nt|sybarra: and here we go |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi colleagues & specs|pg||
nt|barbyh: hi there|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Mashall, welcome |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S seems par|pg||
nt|barbyh: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: Good morning all - Snorri, Ralf, Ian & Tony |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: welcome to Japan everyone|pg||
nt|sharkey: still dark outside in Norway|pg||
nt|snorris: A fight to 5 @d is my bet|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like the Korean team name - "Happy Bridge"|pg||
nt|snorris: on top of 4 @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And a good safe in 5@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: who will save over 5@D?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: hi all|pg||
nt|snorris: hi all|pg||
nt|werge: hi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator? Please insert an  L  in Klinger|pg||
nt|snorris: a 3nt e-w looks likly|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: HI Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Tony!|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sorry, Tom|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: slam time first up|pg||
nt|snorris: 6 @c anyone?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as the cards lir a grand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: lie.. sry|pg||
nt|snorris: 6 @c is a good contract|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Martin, Hans|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No Tony, but I heard about it. Wrong explanation by South to West that made him remove 2@SXX|pg||
nt|idblu: i understand we have the 11th and 12th place team playing each other...it is swiss teams format|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure but hopefully thee|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Yokohama in Japan for the 14th NEC Cup. Last match of the qualifying. 14 boards|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators are Carl Mathiesen, Mike Graham and Mike Polowan|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all - sunny day here in London|pg||
nt|fabsayc: rehi, both teams have 6 players|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello everyone and welcome back to Yokohama in Japan for the 14th NEC Cup. Final, last segment of 16 boards now|pg||
nt|roswolf: a close match now and the heat is on|pg||
mb|1C|nt|thommos: Hi all|pg||
nt|caitlin: hi folks|pg||
nt|shevek: here we are, 13 imps to catch up (will try to be impartial : )|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: as expected so far|pg||
nt|barbyh: hey Marshall|pg||
nt|mariner1: both rooms are starting with board 1 so we will see results as we go|pg||
nt|snorris: not likely|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well lets hope for more excitment this match|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So the score was adjusted to 2@SXX down 4 = 2200|pg||
nt|snorris: hi all|pg||
nt|idblu: S is Brazilian internationalist Diego Brenner|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: This is Part 1 of a semifinal match|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S might be reached|pg||
nt|athene: and should go down, losing @SAQ @DA @HA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hello - Fred, Joe, Michael|pg||
nt|idblu: Looks like the Chineses Women are the cinderella team at the tourney :)|pg||
nt|idblu: And they have also played stupendous ..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for convention cards of players - check out:  http://tinyurl.com/Japan-Open-2007  and http://tinyurl.com/Chinese-Women-2008|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good hand for garbage stayman.|pg||
nt|idblu: pass anything :)|pg||
nt|xenya: Japan Open have a substantial lead China Women, but there are 32 boards ahead|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mcarroll: Morning Hans, Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: The other 2 teams are Australia and Chinese Women|pg||
nt|xenya: strong @C from E|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we will get names as soon as operator has time to put them in |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Unfortunately Ian is trying to be with us, but "gagged" at the moment|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D suit may "disappear"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Had anyone of you opened on N?|pg||
nt|werge: Yoy have problems in 3 NT - East is somehow endplayed...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so the Hacket team came back to win from 40-0 down|pg||
nt|xenya: Hello Martin|pg||
nt|athene: but i think even with 13 imps to make up, bidding game wld be aggressive|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H will be a 3-card limit raise, i guess|pg||
nt|shevek: fit showing jump maybe?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a strong Australian team  Klinger and Delmonte are very well known|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I dont know the other 2  but surely well known also|pg||
nt|sharkey: Would anyone open the East hand 1@C?|pg||
nt|athene: east has the sort of hand that can be very aggressive facing 4-card spade support but less so facing only 3|pg||
nt|athene: weak trumps and possibility of getting forced in hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: clubs are where my points are, yes i would|pg||
nt|shevek: absolutely an opening hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but EW weren't part of the team in 2008, so we'll have to guess what they're doing|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Your commentators are Geoffrey Wolfarth, Jos Jacobs, Mark Horton and Kath Nelson|pg||
mb|1H|nt|barbyh: par 11|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now thats what I call a heavyweight overcall - after a featherlight opening!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: strong club to start|pg||
nt|cindy: @h lead i think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Yokohama in Japan for the 14th NEC Cup. Quarter-finals, two segments of 16 boards. This is the first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome to first set of knockout phase of 2009 NEC|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not an ideal start, but shouldnt matter|pg||
nt|barbyh: normal sequence|pg||
nt|snorris: if n shows life then not|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi folks|pg||
nt|cindy: i just see 6 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi cindy |pg||
nt|cindy: hi shirley :)|pg||
nt|bg: normal contract probably off one  two tricks in three suits plus spade ace|pg||
nt|thommos: assume X is for Takeout|pg||
nt|mpny: Hackett will open 1H which will make reaching 4H routine|pg||
nt|idblu: I think S and E would like to be somewhere else at this moment in time:)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: Operator,  I have told E name is WangWenfei |pg||
nt|Walddk5: But since they started 5 mins early, they are not all here yet|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mariner1: contract in Open is 5@S DBL|pg||
nt|snorris: no 3 nt now I guess|pg||
nt|sharkey: gd morning Mike|pg||
nt|mpny: good morning|pg||
nt|mpny: or late nite here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H makeable here?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators are Al, Ed, Joe and Martin'|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|werge: 3@c look surprising?|pg||
nt|idblu: re all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2@S rather timid?|pg||
nt|snorris: in my system I open 2 nt|pg||
nt|snorris: give it 3..the law..|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @s|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Martin|pg||
nt|idblu: W recently won a North Ameruican championship at the recent nationals playing with Steve Katz I believe|pg||
nt|idblu: I see The Netherlands was in 1st prior to the last match...so these 2 must be the leaders or very close to the top of the standings|pg||
nt|sharkey: real late mike?|pg||
nt|mpny: yes it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF EW using same convention card as 2007 Bermuda Bowl -- we'll see some 10-13 NT openers [fav 1/2/3]|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi folks:)|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone|pg||
nt|caitlin: hi Ed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: according to CC west's balancing NT was supposed to be (12)13-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: evening Ed, Joe, Caitlin|pg||
nt|caitlin: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html  is homepage|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Martin!|pg||
nt|othered1: west may not play south for the 6-count|pg||
nt|caitlin: hi Joe and Al:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: and Martin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well, there's 6 count and there's the South hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know if north's 1@S is a limited opening?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SJ looks like normal play -- then either @D or @H  [probably @D]|pg||
nt|caitlin: 8 teams have qualified for quarter finals these teams 4th-5th respectively and between 4th-8 teams only 5 VP difference|pg||
nt|athene: opening 1@C with 5-5 in the blacks can certainly lead to a much smoother auction if partner has a good hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Fearless.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  1N=10-12 1/2/3 not-vul   otherwise  (14)15-17|pg||
nt|sybarra2: when operator gets a chance,  will make changes I am sure |pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s might bid the slam herehere but|pg||
mb|2N|nt|wilkinsona: strangley, south sold out to 3 spades OR|pg||
nt|othered1: So west will bid her hand out in natural order, rather than @H first|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I am looking for which Hackett this is|pg||
nt|mpny: the auction also made it likely to guess D|pg||
nt|athene: but most people these days prefer to get their major in|pg||
nt|yo_yo: for those who like to picture the players  here is a link for delmonte: http://www.worldbridge.org/TOURN/Bermuda.00/vugraph/players/profiles/0162.html|pg||
nt|shevek: at this vulnerability they're not very keen|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: That's a popular Scandinavian convention - 2 NT = 55 in minors < opening|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @h showing 5|pg||
nt|idblu: Hi Cindy, Tony|pg||
nt|idblu: change that to Ralph Katz :)|pg||
nt|irwinbo: it looks like no game makes|pg||
nt|cindy: W wont let pd off the hook|pg||
nt|mdgraham: err...|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|frankaus: the play will not be challenging|pg||
nt|snorris: 5 @c then|pg||
nt|mcarroll: hard to see what else |pg||
nt|snorris: no 3nt|pg||
nt|snorris: I presime|pg||
nt|snorris: presume|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don¬¥t like the D from E|pg||
nt|sharkey: ouch|pg||
nt|caitlin: does anyone know what happened with the appeal?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I don't have CC for any of the China Evertrust partnerships :( but a good bet that they're part of the Precision throng|pg||
nt|caitlin: would think so and I have yet to find cc's|pg||
nt|santyclz: Rather a surprise on trick 1.|pg||
nt|othered1: might be right to bid with the south hand, then, as Ew could have game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi all, not sure why he did not play spade jack|pg||
nt|caitlin: will cost|pg||
nt|santyclz: I can only guess he didn't read it as 4th best.  Many people would lead the 10 from that holding.|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe playing north for A109xx(x)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if North's lead conventionally from A109xx or Q109xx -- when is it wrong to play !J?|pg||
nt|othered1: Depending on what NS lead from that holding|pg||
nt|idblu: @D10 makes a nice entry to the @C's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over weak NT  --- DBL of Stayman = GOOD HAND [vs Strong NT - better to show @C or something conventional]|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: heard the screach of brakes |pg||
nt|marlowepi: S needs to bid 4S here|pg||
nt|snorris: well done|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello again!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT I mean|pg||
nt|werge: 10 of @C now,pls!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: doubtless game forcing now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: which resulted in a fair punishment|pg||
nt|thommos: lucky South didn't X for t/o|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Morning Snorri and Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes an amazing set - 2 grand slams in a row and lots of swing boards|pg||
nt|sybarra: Paul H. I am told|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and if 4th best [ugh] then Rule of 11 would make J automatic|pg||
nt|sharkey: sensible stop NV - E may have bid game VUL due to potential payoff|pg||
nt|shevek: not sure he'll make this|pg||
nt|sharkey: u read my mind Nicoleta:)|pg||
nt|athene: @HK now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other Chinese Women were playing Precision - so until proven otherwise, let's assume EW also big @Cers|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even though 3S is forcing, N might think that it suggests alternatives to the eventual 4S that S would bid|pg||
nt|cindy: hi :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: My bid on E is 4@s|pg||
nt|werge: But the best board in this tournament was by far 6 @d one down - and 7 @D making at the other table. And declarer in 6 @D played perfectly...|pg||
nt|werge: Yesterday|pg||
nt|marlowepi: buddy?|pg||
nt|werge: @S-lead = expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The 1@S opening and aggressive auction by NS keeps EW out of a making 4@S?|pg||
nt|roswolf: definitely bid the slam|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Jos Jacobs|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi jos|pg||
nt|josj: hi Roland and Geoffrey :)|pg||
nt|josj: good to see a probably tense final session coming up|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and good morning to Mark Horton|pg||
nt|arigun: herkese merhaba|pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: welcome cindy|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi cindy |pg||
nt|sharkey: The "Happy Tea" off to a flyinf start as 5@D likely to make|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Ralf|pg||
nt|cindy: S getting nervous about being endplayed i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: thinking of unblocking to avoid it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: GF hands usually7 don;t|pg||
nt|idblu: appears to off 2@D 1@H and 1@C|pg||
nt|cindy: welcome marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: tricky lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E has a minimum for 1nt|pg||
nt|thommos: 2@S was making, but how many down is is 3@H|pg||
nt|caitlin: 5@CX will yield a nice score for N-S a half Canadian/half U.S. team|pg||
nt|caitlin: Mori is originally from Tokyo so has advantage of speaking language |pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S is easy -- NS had a profitable save available  |pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ho√ægeldiniz|pg||
pc|s8|nt|snorris: dont know about 2 nt in Scandinavia but in my version it is a kind of multi, covering some strong versions|pg||
nt|sharkey: In Norway usually weak 55 hand |pg||
nt|snorris: ok|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: even 12 tricks possible..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and a good choice it seems|pg||
nt|sharkey: ok - undo|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry just put on right glasses:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: lol|pg||
nt|chessmaste: From a sunny Bath|pg||
nt|Walddk5: My bath is wet|pg||
nt|arigun: bu yil ankara kis 4lu kupasi degisik bir formatta oynaniyor|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: now 12 tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: missed that one...Rolands got me on split shifts|pg||
nt|snorris: where south fell asleep? |pg||
nt|idblu: safe lead, gives nothing away|pg||
nt|santyclz: The other table had a normal 2/1 auction to the unenviable 2@s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but ed -- which holding can north have where it is EVER right to play small from dummy?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11 IMPs here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i wonder what 3@H meant|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: a nice auction to a sound contract then|pg||
nt|cindy: another decision|pg||
nt|cindy: to duck or not to duck   that is the question|pg||
nt|ralfwil: how many of you should double on E?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good morning from a frosty Manchester|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting hand -- 4@S looks very close for EW|pg||
nt|werge: They sacrifice against their olwn 4 @s...|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now W can make 5@c if N continues with @d|pg||
nt|MolvaM: izmirde yap√Ωlan k√Ω√æ 4l√º tak√Ωmlar √æampiyonas√Ω finalleri|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzhn: 1st and 3rd position here, we will try to get scores from Sj√∂berg-Bergstr√∂m who is second placed.....|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But why not a @s lead? a @h lead is missing a tempo|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: a couple of clubs can be ruffed for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: Yes|pg||
nt|othered1: a109xxx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: A109xx playing small, suit blocked|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes go to www.bbotv.com/vugraph to see open room|pg||
nt|caitlin: has to set up hearts but W will play spades|pg||
nt|caitlin: down one|pg||
pc|h3|nt|thommos: and 9@H switch|pg||
nt|othered1: or Q109xxx|pg||
nt|josj: hi Mark :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: sipping champagne as well i suppose mark|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Good morning Jos!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: ruffing spades is easier|pg||
nt|bg: duck is correct  declarer may only have three dia|pg||
nt|cindy: now a club would be good ?|pg||
nt|snorris: when w finessed @ds|pg||
nt|ralfwil: lucku @d split! K98|pg||
nt|ralfwil: lucky|pg||
nt|sharkey: Defence not missing a beat here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after @CA not taken early - declarer will get last repreive when @DJ falls|pg||
nt|chessmaste: de reigeur on Valentines Day|pg||
nt|josj: cold and sunny here as well|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Kath Nelson|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Now they are all here|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|snorris: awful lead|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps 4@S can be defeated by repeated @D leads though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Fred already said that :(|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: 3N looks a reasonable contract here -- actually an easy make|pg||
nt|sybarra: tough to time all the finesses you need here|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The au pair has just opened the Krug Ros√©|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good morning from Manchester|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: not so sure about easy to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hard to see how this was allowed to make|pg||
nt|santyclz: Bears repeating.|pg||
nt|josj: lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi kath|pg||
nt|josj: hi Kath|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: admittedly, on a fortunate lie|pg||
nt|sybarra: not so sure its "easy make" either |pg||
nt|daman: double dummy male |pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: Fredin in the tank|pg||
nt|snorris: openers prime suit|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sorry I meant spades of course|pg||
nt|snorris: more luck|pg||
nt|idblu: from the grave:)|pg||
nt|thommos: this should now make 8|pg||
nt|werge: The problem is, that a double from West is take-out - and you are caught |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all 4 vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 9, some don't. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|athene: if he led the @HA, he was threatening to reach dummy in clubs and throw his diamonds on the @HQJ|pg||
nt|athene: so south might have cashed the @DA but that wld kill the entry for the club ruff|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Solid slam bidding|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hi Martin!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: needs to play @c before @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: needs to play clubs now |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry for the echo Ralf|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Panja|pg||
nt|mcarroll: hi|pg||
nt|snorris: south thinking about the J of @hs?|pg||
nt|snorris: might be right against another layout|pg||
nt|panja: a small @H and then @S shift by North would lead to some interesting situation|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Agree with a small @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Q109xx possible, but pass from south holding @SA very unlikely -- so maybe playing for stiff or doubleton @SQ is right|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@S also down one on @D lead but likely get club lead|pg||
nt|athene: so it wld be a strange complicated sort of scissors coup|pg||
nt|santyclz: Suit preference discard by e, suggesting @h strength.|pg||
nt|arigun: toplam 82 takimin katilimi ile yapilan turnuava 80 takimin 10 grupta mucadelesi ile round robin olarak basladi|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bug√ºn ba√ælad√Ω|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Hello Vladimir and Martin|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It would seem that South thought that 3@H would be forcing after the 2@S cue - but in that case, 3@d would also be forcing (I assume)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: i am not sure what the advantage might be of playing a third heart|pg||
nt|shevek: oops|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Morning Vladimir|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: bad defence!|pg||
nt|idblu: will always lose 2@D unless AQ alone on his left|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry that should have been Q109xx NOT possible|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wilkinsona: so in trying to defeat this contract active defence makes declarers life easy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but running the spades was also poor technique|pg||
nt|athene: sorry if declarer led the @HK i mean not the @HA|pg||
nt|arigun: eleme turlarinda gruplarindan ilk 3 sirayi alan takimlar knock out turuna devam edecek|pg||

nt|mdgraham: and, let's face it, AKJ876 may be worth a mention |pg||
nt|othered1: still not making this with another @C|pg||
nt|xenya: but 5@C is extremely costly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: same contract in OR|pg||
nt|MolvaM: isimler ve bayraklar l√ºtfennnn |pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: getting easier |pg||
nt|cindy: down 2 in open|pg||
nt|irwinbo: still a good game to bid and it should be replicated in the other room|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and a nice defence|pg||
nt|werge: This will bring a morning-score|pg||
nt|xenya: -800 to be exact|pg||
pc|h9|nt|josj: that's what one would expect|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ralfwil: This is one of the  weaknesses, allowing a 5-card major in a nt-opening|pg||

nt|werge: 800|pg||
nt|shevek: defence erred here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: here's a nice pic of Fruewirth: http://www.moamabowlingclub.com.au/images/Robert-Fruewirth.jpg|pg||

nt|athene: this is a typical example of why people open 1@S rather than 1@C :)|pg||
nt|athene: you are most likely to play spades most of the time, and often you get an extra trick from concealing the side suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - nowadays minor suits are almost ignored|pg||

nt|marlowepi: slam is a reasonable gamble. 5S is the safe bid of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: personally i think the game would be greatly improved if bidding and making 5M paid more than 4M with an overtrick|pg||
nt|snorris: very strange, n opened 1 @d!!|pg||

nt|sybarra: website for tourney |pg||
nt|werge: One more 7 NT...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well Im not sure about that..... but we hoped for more action|pg||
nt|snorris: another weakness is the inability of not being able to inviting slam in minor|pg||
nt|idblu: a push as suggested|pg||
nt|thommos: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me a D from W is for penalty and 2nt is forcing for one round|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - not sure I understand S bidding|pg||

nt|caitlin: this is why I tell my students NOT to underlead Aces vs suit contracts:)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: well last time i held 23 and heard LHO open 1N -- we didn't find a making game :)|pg||

nt|werge: 4 @s|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know NS's NT range?|pg||
nt|sharkey: but then 2@D wudnt be forcing after Dbl?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they will be happy to win 3 imps though|pg||
nt|mpny: the XX must have showed a good hand. if 3H was not forcing, I do not know how one would force|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S will be made but it might be missed here or there|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I prefer D on S before 1@s on that poor suit and I have a 3-card @h|pg||
nt|snorris: 1 @h overbid|pg||
nt|snorris: ??|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 1@s on a 7-card suit?|pg||
nt|snorris: so how many? 3 @h ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: its forcing|pg||

nt|fabsayc: not a great 6NT, but will make|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lots of tricks NS as the cards lie|pg||

nt|snorris: 6 nt is the contract to be in|pg||
nt|snorris: here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Ron's to blame for this craze is he?|pg||
nt|snorris: 1 @s might show 5|pg||
nt|mpny: no, 2D would almost certainly not be forcing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 3nt|pg||
nt|santyclz: This hand should tell us if e-w are playing precision, w will probably rebid 3@c if so.|pg||

nt|bg: 4 spades tough with heart lead 3nt also tough with heart lead|pg||
nt|cindy: @h lead unlikely vs 4@s though|pg||
nt|bg: declarer has to duck first round rule of 7 with six cards subtract from 7 and get one therefore duck first round|pg||
nt|cindy: yes   should find it|pg||
nt|sybarra: is it rule of 7 or 11?|pg||
nt|bg: can get 3 spades 3 dia two clubs and one heart|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..judges well to pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not much for E to do with such limited stoppage in ajors and no diamond honor|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Curious from E Partner has opened and he has 11 HP|pg||
nt|sharkey: gd morning Ralf|pg||
nt|werge: Morning|pg||
nt|sharkey: and Hans|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right -- the power of limited opening 1@H, saves East from a painful guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: arrgh|pg||
nt|santyclz: Negative x didn't work out well.|pg||
nt|idblu: 3N...what did E promise?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: or 4 remaining now|pg||
nt|cindy: match a board|pg||
nt|sybarra: no dbl no trbl |pg||
nt|snorris: 990|pg||
nt|werge: Is 1 @s your chice also - NEVER bid such a suit in defensive situation|pg||
nt|xenya: so a huge gain for Japan on the very first board|pg||
nt|idblu: opening bid?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now South will have to make a noise         but no|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3nt looks very conservative|pg||
nt|othered1: fMust b e 13-15 and north knows there's no long suit fit.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ah, possibly|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no nead to sac |pg||
nt|snorris: 3 sp is too little|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a 7-card suit after partners opening and also a support?|pg||
nt|snorris: sounds like just figthing for a partscore|pg||
nt|werge: The @C Q shoyld lead to the right bid = 4 @S|pg||
nt|mpny: yes, 3D rather than 3H would be F, but he got to the right strain|pg||
nt|santyclz: Overall in the matches I've seen the players have been remarkably conservative for juniors.|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't love opening the north hand with 1N, but it's worked out fine.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This should be flat - same contract next door|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the game is missed|pg||
nt|josj: it might have been time for a polite raise by S with 2 aces|pg||
nt|roswolf: i fancy in the other room game will be bid|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Maybe North should have doubled to show a good overcall, although in my book he had already promised a decent hand with 1@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but has North show 15 with a 6 card suit,  i dont think so|pg||
nt|josj: wanna bet Geoffrey?:)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|werge: RD...!!!|pg||
nt|cindy: i agree|pg||
nt|sharkey: Normal 3 NT here - off a couple|pg||
nt|athene: it looks natural to begin diamonds with small to the @DJ, which won't work|pg||
nt|athene: oh - declarer doesn't really have time to play on diamonds anyway|pg||
nt|athene: but there's no possible way to get three spade tricks|pg||
nt|idblu: they aren't playing the game that got them here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: even now |pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|sharkey: E probably doesnt want to open 2@S with 2 aces thus 1@S second choice?|pg||
nt|snorris: I HAVE to bid something in south|pg||
nt|snorris: it might be my last chanse to bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes but, not 1@s for me |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I double on such a hand|pg||
nt|thommos: pass from west would be a min hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Any regular pair would have their own agreements on what sets up a force and what doesn't - not all pairs play the same  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: this looks a hairy contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the important thing is to be on the same wavelength - and South was on long wave there while North was on medium|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - lol - perhaps 3@D followed by 3@S and 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: !a and a @c continuation will break the contract|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sA|pg||
nt|sharkey: Problems here with trumps 4-2 I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: E will refuse 1st @S perhaps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is it Paul Hackett  here or one of his twins?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 8 tricks if Declarer starts with low @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS using standard honor leads;  3rd even/lo odd spot leads -- upside-down count & attitude signals |pg||
nt|idblu: the China Women have been VERY impressive....in all facets of the game.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the ladies bid everything|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks with a @s finess|pg||
nt|roswolf: 9 tricks sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: Fallenius: small barp, Fredin: So thats what you think? He probably likes the dummy......|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @s10 was essential|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure you try the @S too early,  could go down |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but N can have a 6-card suit in @h, so...|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx all lots of suggestions,    |pg||
nt|sybarra: and all realistic,  at the table I would be worried (I think) about taking spade finesse too early |pg||
nt|snorris: probably|pg||
nt|snorris: and if they play strong @c system its almost ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: NV not to unreasonable I think|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..turns out ok, as this can make..|pg||
nt|snorris: of course you will win 7 but...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North's opening strenthens our guess that they're playing precision [but even that hand seems too weak for 1N]|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps unless you know!|pg||
nt|josj: :) sure bets are the best|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: with 3 cards in both unbid suits and opps vul, 2D was a dubious choice|pg||
nt|athene: even if you pick @SAx that only gives you two spades|pg||
nt|mcarroll: very delicate|pg||
nt|xenya: might require a very careful play by declarer |pg||
nt|mcarroll: can make but not easy|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer's prime objective is to establish clubs keeping N off lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW did have a save here if they found it|pg||
nt|werge: The problem is, that if you bid all henads, where hou "must" bid . you loose|pg||
nt|snorris: no win|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hard to disagree with success, and I hate the final double |pg||
nt|othered1: 2@S likely denying @H (if they're playing standardish 2-way Stayman)|pg||
nt|snorris: getting there..|pg||
nt|snorris: maybe|pg||
nt|mpny: paul|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and perhaps more after @c a heart continuation|pg||
nt|yo_yo: for those who dont know  Paul (the father)  has twin sons, both champions|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Paul likes to bid |pg||
nt|sharkey: yes |pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: The play in @s ic critical. The right play is now to play @sA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Covers all singleton honours |pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it shows what we know - 230 gained 3 imps against the 3@D contract at the other table|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think I have met them in Holland some years ago|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10 with a @s lead and 9 tricks with a @c lead|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i prefer to save when their game makes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they do play strong club, not sure of details, they were on vugraph before|pg||
nt|caitlin: I prefer the 1NT than East opening 1@H at other table which did work but surprising no spade balance|pg||
nt|sybarra2: ty operator |pg||
pc|h9|nt|cindy: doesntlook like 3N or 5D so no problem |pg||
nt|athene: perhaps lead a spade from dummy and hope south jumps in with @SAxx|pg||
nt|athene: to return a club|pg||
nt|shevek: same contract, same lead in OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has to make 2 discards if @H tricks taken|pg||
nt|idblu: ge Shirley :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops Open is in 4@S :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: of course, but still he has opened|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|sharkey: Yes - and then do the right choice in @D |pg||
nt|ralfwil: no thougtts about a grand?|pg||
nt|werge: Is this play right: @d to the Ace - and let the 9 run...?|pg||
nt|sharkey: much easier to bid seeing all hands :)|pg||
nt|mpny: they will pick up another 3 IMPs here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we all bid 1NT with that east hand over the overcall?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i usually pass with a weak NT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wilkinsona: 13 now I suppose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes a bidder is just maximum..........except for me of course|pg||
nt|irwinbo: is three diamonds forward going or just blocking?|pg||
nt|caitlin: you here Ed?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer miss timed things in OR it seems..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me 5nt in this sequence is a grand trial|pg||
nt|idblu: blocking|pg||
nt|athene: whatever she chooses to discard will work out ok|pg||
nt|josj: iI think so|pg||
nt|roswolf: no but in a strong club system they sometimes have to|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah that's the difference maybe|pg||
nt|josj: opps can't beat it as they have no running suits threatening|pg||
pc|d7|nt|wilkinsona: so terrific start for Hayate, making 7NT NS board 1, 6NT EW board 2|pg||
nt|irwinbo: that's what i think|pg||
nt|idblu: any other bid would be fed going|pg||
nt|cindy: i think it depends on your agreement|pg||
nt|marlowepi: makes best sense to play it that way, as other bids are available to show strength|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed - maybe a mild upset to get to finals, but were Seeded in the Top 4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: that is why he is playing and I am in the rafters |pg||
nt|yo_yo: I cant think of a game here even seeing all hands|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now 11|pg||
nt|xenya: another good idea -- set up a spade trick while discarding losers from hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|idblu: forward|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Ed |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Caitlin!|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Shirley!|pg||
nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes 6 IMP to Juice|pg||
nt|othered1: juice will get 5 back here, sooner or later.|pg||
nt|caitlin: 5|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|frankaus: this could make if Fushida ellect to finess @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - do you agree with Paul's Dbl?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i sympathize with it |pg||
nt|mpny: no, I do not, but it is not an easy hand|pg||
nt|idblu: from the get-go?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in fact -- the top 4 seeds ALL advanced to the semi-finals|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes a real opportunityt here as they stopped in 3@H in OR|pg||
nt|MolvaM: √æu an bu √æampiyona izmirde|pg||
nt|MolvaM: k√ºlt√ºrpark fuar√Ωndaki salonlarda oynan√Ωyor|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: though not as ducious as the double|pg||
nt|snorris: misguessed @ds maybe|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud be|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: played to ruff clubs in hand and lost control it seems..|pg||
nt|snorris: this was not a pleasing sight this king of @s for north|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But no use of it|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes only 3 spades othe table too...cant see why north doesnt try for the max here|pg||
nt|idblu: I want the handicapper betting for me :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: I have played many worse games|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @s bid might win or might push oponents to a sac|pg||
nt|fabsayc: NEX|pg||
nt|josj: it also has the virtue of making life more difficult for the opps, as was proved here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: Double finesse in @D odds on|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no they didnt bid it, good job we didnt bet :)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3 rounds of clubs is the defense|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the bad break hurts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perfect defence so far|pg||
nt|ahollan1: key info fred: if i'm betting -- ignore handicapper -- just bet opposite of what i do|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ve bizler naklen izliyoruz|pg||
pc|d6|nt|snorris: well done|pg||
nt|bg: another 13 for Japan|pg||
nt|werge: Third in hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wd Martin, avoiding Joey's copyright.|pg||
nt|xenya: now he can try for a cross ruff -- which works here|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: she sorry|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|snorris: might be difficult to find out about the @d queen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thoughtful @HA cash before going back to @D -- encourages partner to play 13th @D, but just doesn't matter here |pg||
pc|c9|nt|snorris: 10 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: So the Chinese Women strike back|pg||

nt|yo_yo: the ladies crowded the auction|pg||
nt|sharkey: perhaps the downside looms larger than the upside vie Vul vs NV on this hand|pg||

nt|snorris: now we will know if n-s play strong @c|pg||
nt|werge: Listen - he has an Ace, a trump trick (aganins GOOD bidders - and partner has promised an opening bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 6NT other room..|pg||
nt|snorris: 3-3 @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I ask fro the @dQ by bidding 6@c. The suit below the trumph|pg||
nt|snorris: me too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well 2 spades is available for forward move|pg||
nt|cindy: i wouldnt assume it was blocking with a pickup partner|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2NT not weak either, nor 3C|pg||
nt|idblu: new suit would show extras and interest|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: sry 3D 3make|pg||
nt|thommos: at  this speed we will be finshed in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of like doing vugraph from Brazil |pg||
nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then the alternative is 3N, and nay 5-3 spade fit goes out the window |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if EW playing 10-13 NT at this vul, then East knew partner did NOT hold @SQ|pg||
nt|caitlin: Joey is playing:)|pg||
nt|shevek: I hear that the real score is 47-29|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam here|pg||
nt|athene: some people might pass that south hand|pg||
nt|shevek: following an appeal|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hello Fred|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably east should have bid 2h, if partner has spades will still find|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be competitive|pg||

nt|daman: get your popcorn out    this should be fun|pg||
nt|xenya: this might be interesting|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only a part score in @s here, but let¬¥s see|pg||
nt|caitlin: his team went from 20th to 8th|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry 6th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and knew no chance for trump promotion|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont like 11 counts but 54 in the majors  i like|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed some actin|pg||
nt|roswolf: action|pg||
nt|mariner1: can EW make a Moysian 4@S here?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E does not rise on first heart lead from dummy, 3NT makes|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|othered1: 13-15 NT range has some funny results, when it's 15.|pg||
nt|cindy: need to find club fit|pg||
nt|idblu: tell 'em to slow down... we get paid by the hour :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: NS reversed|pg||

nt|caitlin: in 2@H in other room|pg||
nt|shevek: agree with pass here|pg||
nt|sharkey: but won't get there|pg||
nt|athene: you have an open-ended straight flush draw, so it's a clear opener for me|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D looks the contract|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ama turnuvan√Ωn ilerleyen safhalar√Ωnda iddial√Ω tak√Ωmlara √∂ncelik verilecek do√∞al olarak|pg||
mb|3C|an|9 11p !d fit|nt|roswolf: 4@S looks normal and then?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2M=10-13, 6+suit|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: In OR west failed to raise hearts with 5 it seems...|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15-17 NT at these colors|pg||
nt|caitlin: could this be a DONT type bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  @C + Major  or   DONT  @C + another|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: my bid too on E|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|panja: 1@H for Spade suit...|pg||
nt|cindy: who likes 3@h here ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I like this 3@h!|pg||
nt|snorris: auto...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although South may have overcalled 1@S if he had five and some values |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if South gets a chance to bid 2@H -- we'll know more about 2@C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c with a @h lead|pg||
nt|shevek: values in the short suits not good|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C strong, double is clubs?|pg||
nt|idblu: think they'll play @H's here?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kuzeyin 3@c deklaresi karo tutut√æu ve davet eli g√∂steriyor muhtemelen|pg||
nt|MolvaM: genellikle 5li karo ve 10-12 puan|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok 9-11 mi√æ|pg||
mb|3D|nt|snorris: hmm...|pg||
nt|snorris: undo|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S is a better spot than 3Nt, it seems, but it might not be easy to get there..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But you will only earn 100 if it is -1 and loose 170 if made?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 4@h is laydown|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can we put superchargers on EW please|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D  means "System On" over DBL or 2@C overcall|pg||
nt|santyclz: If DONT it improves e's hand.|pg||
nt|caitlin: for any conventions one may not be familiar with the new home for bridge guys is http://www.bridgeguys.com/|pg||
nt|caitlin: mark it off-- a reasonably good site|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah i am blind 3 losers in 5@D|pg||
nt|josj: unluckily yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i can't imagine passing the N hand, in third chair at these colors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but 3D will probably be the contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be the contract |pg||
nt|marlowepi: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: except N will fear S has clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard sometimes plays a 4/3 |pg||
nt|snorris: e-w can 3 @h|pg||
nt|sharkey: Don't understand why W would fail to raise to 3@H in OR when pd bid VUL|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s maybe 4 @c|pg||
nt|bg: 3h ok if partnership understanding that it can be that good|pg||
nt|sybarra: would you bid 4 first time?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East will take some stopping now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H is the best practical bid on W hand even if playing 5-card majors|pg||
nt|idblu: once W can't cue @S, they should stop in 5@C or 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lack of any spade cuebid ought to stop everybody|pg||
nt|cindy: as soon as she finds out they have no @s control the brakes will be put on|pg||
nt|idblu: 5@D|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Never predict a flat board they will always find a way to outwit the commentator!!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me - no opening on S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tournament homepage is http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html  --  i believe the finals are 4 sets of 16 boards|pg||
nt|xenya: i think 2nd trump was a mistake but no doubt she was playing for some other distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: all the same with 32 hcp and 3 tens its worth a look perhaps|pg||
nt|cindy: no  would never bid 4|pg||
nt|snorris: how do you like this nt Hans?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhn: Efraimsson: You promise 3 trick?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: P - P - 1H - 1NT -3H and now EW do not have an easy time|pg||
nt|barbyh: d1 with a d lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes N could have bid 1@H or more to take advantage of the NV vs VUL 3rd seat|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: some saying 2@H and some 3@H with N here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: back again..|pg||
nt|cindy: i just dont like the fact 3@h takes up so much room|pg||
nt|bg:   clubs great contract|pg||
nt|bg: 6|pg||
nt|cindy: not fond of preempting our side|pg||
nt|snorris: now can s double?|pg||
nt|cindy: sorry marshall|pg||
nt|cindy: im slow typist|pg||
nt|werge: South will not ask for aces in this board....|pg||
nt|sharkey: seems so|pg||
nt|shevek: I believe you Will|pg||
nt|idblu: 3@H here would sound like a cue bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession time --- playing Precision, i would open 1@H in 1st seat|pg||
nt|roswolf: HARD TO RESIST BIDDING GAME|pg||
nt|MolvaM: makul 1 kontrat|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mpny: EW can make 3 of either round suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like a tad high|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@S sure looks like super accept|pg||
nt|MolvaM: turnuvan√Ωn ba√ælar√Ωnda genellikle makul ve mant√Ωkl√Ω kontratlar oynan√Ωr|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ama √∂zellikle ak√æam yeme√∞i sonras√Ω kontratlar biraz daha yarat√Ωc√Ω olmaya ba√ælar|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: eighth time's the charm! welcome|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Cindy|pg||
nt|frankaus: many here will open 2@H or equivalent with N hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: happy ending|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surely West had a 3 heart bid here..|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S now..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: take the money by a D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that's cuz u worry about typosezb|pg||
nt|cindy: yes :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm with you Ralf|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Me too|pg||
nt|werge: In their system it is probably a reasonable minimum opening|pg||
nt|athene: south, having passed, can make aggressive forward-going moves|pg||
nt|athene: she can't have any more than this|pg||
nt|shevek: Mullamphy opened 1@c with south's|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's not that great a slam |pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice suit, easy rebids and most important -- strength limited by failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: As would I.  But I'd pass here.|pg||
nt|idblu: N will never P here|pg||
nt|santyclz: No, I would have passed with s.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: S may just run the fiamonds and lead a club,hoping to read position|pg||
nt|snorris: the law..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..or there|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - The "LAW" shud compel W to fight to at least 3@H I think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also from the beginning. 5-card support!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4hearts looks ok on a cross ruff play|pg||
nt|othered1: In contemporary bidding 2@H on this auction is pretty much not invitational|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely a push|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some saying 8H too|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @s showing a better hand than weak shift jump|pg||
nt|panja: play should be interesting....|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Nobuyuki Hayashi, NPC of the Japan Open team on many occasions|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I dislike it intensely|pg||
nt|werge: Better than any other opening with that hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lucky layout for NS given  that they will get a clib lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: 3NT by Hackett|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Although it seems to have worked|pg||
nt|sharkey: % no - but makes :)|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D is aggressive facing a passed hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|npcjpn: Hi, everyone.|pg||
nt|bg: 6 spades goes for 1100 better than 6 cubs|pg||
nt|cindy: was 4N supposed to be keycard there or just general slam try ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting if it was |pg||
nt|npcjpn: I am not sure, but some kind of slam try with direct 5@c shows just competing.|pg||
nt|cindy: well keycard is sorta futile with that void|pg||
nt|cindy: hi nobuyuki :)|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @c - pass 1 @H - pass - ???|pg||
nt|snorris: not the killing lead...|pg||
nt|snorris: I agree Hans|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I have seen so many nt-openings with a singleton major, and I don¬¥t like it|pg||
nt|irwinbo: wd|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure well done|pg||
nt|bg: declarer may get nevous here but cannot go wrong|pg||
nt|bg: nervous|pg||
nt|xenya: only a @S lead beats slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now he must support @c|pg||
pc|dT|nt|barbyh: what is 2nt here can possibly be a raise|pg||
nt|snorris: agree|pg||
nt|cindy: so if general try what should E's bid be ?|pg||
nt|cindy: 5@s i think|pg||
nt|npcjpn: I think so too.|pg||
nt|werge: North had the double! - diamonds behind |pg||
nt|snorris: not much defence in s s hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If you cannot open 1@C it is difficult, but I would open 1@D in that case|pg||
nt|werge: Neither do I, but I was asked about THIS hand |pg||
nt|idblu: he will be nervous after the lead...but all's well that end's well|pg||
nt|thommos: yes, but once Spade Finese works it will be very quick|pg||
nt|thommos: duck QC |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i never remember name of convention where 2m = m + Major :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: notice how DONT effectively preempted NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not a fan of superaccept with 3 card support --- especially when North has said things not breaking well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has 4 al|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is for hearts--four card support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opps wrong glasses|pg||
nt|caitlin: lol:))|pg||
nt|santyclz: The ones full of scotch?|pg||
nt|athene: if you play sensible control-bids, 4@D denies a club control so 4@H confirms one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough call for South on 2nd bid -- RDBL and 2@H both reasonable|pg||
nt|idblu: very nice...catered to the 3@H not being natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done Ino!|pg||
nt|idblu: impressive|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mariner1: Marlow do they have a card for that :)|pg||
nt|cindy: how about 1H|pg||
nt|mariner1: Marshall|pg||
nt|panja: if declarer removes trumps early, and then loses @D finesse....he would go down..so he might think of getting Clubs in|pg||
nt|snorris: thats another way to cope yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: Al I had to look twice...thought it was my glasses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S as superaccept may mean they're using the old Walsh Relays  ---  where 2@D is @H OR slam going minor 1-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still has to make it --- @C lead will help a lot|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess that's why I'm watching, not playing.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Ed.|pg||
nt|idblu: Hi Ed...welcome :)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|sybarra: surpiese Morath didnt say no,  just 2 |pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: Board 27, same result at Sj√∂berg-Bergstr√∂m table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Efraimsson will soon realise that this was a phantom, but I would have done the same I must confess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E sequence showed a good hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 1@H looked more normal to me,,,,,,,, some kibbers very aggressive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no but it is on a par with 2H or 3H|pg||
nt|barbyh: then he has to make 2 pitches|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yesd he has an Ace - in partner's suit,  Probably a trump trick - and we have seen some really unconvincing opening bids|pg||
nt|panja: difficult for West too..he does not have Club guard..so removing trumps isnt attractive..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think Hackett should have doubled with his @dKJx|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: difficult lead for west though|pg||
nt|sybarra: and @D come crashing down, bridge is easy game |pg||
nt|thommos: a partscore win to N/S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well it's natural for Hanlon to try for game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - almost mirrored shapes, which never play too well|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW would probably not have entered into the bidding on this hand.  3@S by S is normal in many partnerships I believe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no comprende scotch ---  i'm into fermented grapejuice like Zin|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Best line is to win in hand and test clubs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|panja: nothing else seems promising|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 times @h to lock him on the table|pg||
nt|snorris: and hope for 2-2 in minors in n|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as the cards lie win on hand an play a @c to the Q|pg||
nt|panja: my sense is...this will now go @CA, @C ruff, another trumps, and a Club...let us see...declarer, not knowing @D finesse is in...will have to think hard about his options|pg||
nt|cindy: im thinking they werent on same page but it worked out great|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To see if you can afford the safety play in hearts later (small to the ace)|pg||
nt|werge: If they land this slam, it has been quite a start|pg||
nt|athene: but south might now fear that 5@S is askin for good trumps (which she hasn't got) rather than a club control (which she has)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: Or perhaps they have seen pd's overcalls VUL before....|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he heard me!|pg||
nt|idblu: the hesitation indicates no @s K|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this opens up for a @s lead|pg||
nt|idblu: u and me both Joe|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cindy: i mean   dont ya want a heart lead ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: always a problem! isn¬¥t it?|pg||
nt|sharkey: S pushed OR as well|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Another delicate contract - the 4-1 trump break makes it difficult|pg||
nt|xenya: feels it can be made but, again, a delicate handling is needed here |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H looks pushy to me, but it did fine partner with a near-perfect 11 count|pg||
nt|snorris: agree|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I suppose Hackett and Hanlon are off to the gold coast congress in Australia|pg||
nt|othered1: Interesting plays at tricks 1 & 2.  This hand has gotten lots less complex|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably doesn't matter -- but can it hurt to play @C9?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: right. that is why he has to read the position|pg||
nt|bg: should play heart now if he draws trump could get in trouble|pg||
nt|cindy: yes   he has all the club spots |pg||
nt|npcjpn: I will tell the operater to catch up the meaning of alerted bid later.|pg||
nt|cindy: ty|pg||
nt|npcjpn: so far we have no clue of 3@h and 5@d.|pg||
nt|cindy: dare we suggest next ?|pg||
nt|idblu: @S can't be wrong|pg||
nt|caitlin: they hear you Roland|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wilkinsona: on the other hand a psychic cue from East may have stood a chance|pg||
nt|idblu: Migr saves time :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok well done|pg||
nt|shevek: problem with opening south's hand is that you'll pull the breaks (like south did in the OR)...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would you say that if K@D was with East?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ralfwil: T think W should have bid 3@h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The same should happen here|pg||
nt|athene: well - as has been remarked, it's not that great a slam|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or the spades didnt behave?|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the double, showing clubs, makes it slightly better than 50% that the @DK is right|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: heart back |pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt S will be alone in this contract|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Will the one suit squeeze work here?|pg||
nt|xenya: sure -- both 4@S and 5@C look obvious|pg||
nt|snorris: now all is well|pg||
nt|bg: 5dia probably 3 key cards in clubs|pg||
nt|werge: @D now...|pg||
nt|idblu: as well as the @D switch :)|pg||
nt|mpny: this is a very normal result|pg||
pc|c7|nt|snorris: the best yes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I think thats asking a bit|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@h IN THE or|pg||
nt|ahollan1: partner just needs stiff @HJ for @D tap to work -- but no luck today|pg||
nt|othered1: I was away and missed the semifinals, but every time I've seen them, the China Women team has just sat there and taken their tricks, occasionally with aggressive initial actions.  ...|pg||
nt|othered1: I'll be interested in seeing if they can keep this style up.|pg||
nt|idblu: why change when it works|pg||
nt|ahollan1: quoting Barry Rigal "strongest national team"|pg||
nt|idblu: as long as they don't "tilt"|pg||
nt|idblu: and I don't see them doing that|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mariner1: and you know E is very likely to have an opening bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like he is trying to read the position now|pg||
nt|thommos: agreed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and perhaps also E could have bid 3@d instead of 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Strong players indeed|pg||
nt|athene: but against that there are the chances of club ruff, or the @SQ scoring|pg||
pc|cK|pg||

pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jaap Frijling|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wilkinsona: for EW not to fight seems strange (though I may go -200 in 4Hx, I admit)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and stop off conveniently for this congress|pg||
nt|sharkey: S trying to create an endplay - but in vain on the actual layout|pg||
nt|sharkey: also need @S to break|pg||
nt|sharkey: but - no guts - no glory :)|pg||
nt|athene: i would say slam probably comes out at about 50%, so the expectation from bidding or not bidding it is about the same in the long run|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while we wait -- I just checked NS CC -- they do use 2@H opening as weak @H + minor -- but require 55|pg||
nt|jaapfr: gm all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Roland all specs|pg||
nt|xenya: i think the natural line of taking a double finesse in trumps is doomed|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Jaap|pg||

nt|panja: still..what if @S were 4-1?|pg||
nt|snorris: not sure if this is the best play , like yours betterPanja|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nice life|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cindy: that sounds right|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Should south hop with @hA?|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|ralfwil: Not now, burt if Fredin had played @hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he has nothing elsed to hang onto|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PO Sundelin says he has treatment where 2@D can also be a signoff in @S|pg||
nt|athene: but bidding it is more exciting :) and is certainly consistent with these players' style|pg||
nt|sharkey: can only admire the Chinese ladies|pg||
nt|athene: if you are playing against Chinese ladies and you score +680, you can just write down -13 imps|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: S opened OR - didn't come out|pg||
nt|shevek: this is not vul, but still....|pg||
nt|idblu: I don't think S can handle this|pg||
nt|santyclz: Going to have to take the @c finesse.|pg||
nt|idblu: unless hook @C|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: defense slipped after a good opening lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: So it seems |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like 12 imps to EW here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: years ago I went off in a grand slam - I had a singleton, and could count 13 tricks if partner could take a ruff in my hand. However, he held singleton ace and there were only 12 ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: tricks |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|cindy: sorry   i came in the middle of the hand|pg||
nt|snorris: nowadays a 3@h bid is difficult to punish anyway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d from the table!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: use @S to pull trump|pg||
nt|idblu: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: right|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: but hard to Dbl 3@H when you have 10 trumps - so risk minimal|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good play of heart 10|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sorry 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mirror shapes|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Fallenius must hope Fredin has @D10|pg||

nt|sharkey: we're doing pretty good Snorri|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But I think this was the correct play. It provides @s 32 and if @cK not is on side @dK must be|pg||
nt|snorris: 6 @d ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h on NS|pg||
nt|snorris: 1 NT?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it was a long time ago, but I still remember :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he won't remember this -- but PO is the only person to ever bid 4N to make after partner and I competed to 3N -- where it worked and pulled in all the matchpoints [25+ years ago - ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm still waiting for chance to do that to somebody else]|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I am always irritated on my partner when he not shows his controls because a weak opening. For me he should have asked for aces|pg||
nt|athene: some people do with that exact hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H-1@S-?   |pg||
nt|yo_yo: so the men are the Japanese Open team, do we know how they did in Beijing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: in north|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a nice 6@h and also a cheap save in 7@c|pg||
nt|mpny: here i'm guessing 1H-2C-4C-5C|pg||
nt|idblu: D|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be a quiet partscore|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 1nt??|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer has a choice of plays in that 6NT in other room, best line not easy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sidekick clues?|pg||
nt|cindy: lolol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is one beefy NT|pg||
nt|cindy: yes meaty|pg||
nt|idblu: 17 prime + 10's galore|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i'd be tempted to open a minor and rebid 2NT. then i would succumb to temptation|pg||
nt|ralfwil: black and no sugar Hans?|pg||
nt|thommos: me too|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6 on for EW but NS will cloud the auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump underlead might have beat it|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely off to the races?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Martin,  welcome|pg||
nt|othered1: Is 7 good enough on, say, @H lead?  |pg||
nt|caitlin: going to slam in other room|pg||
nt|caitlin: friendly clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely not 1NT on that hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neg dbl then @H or some immediate @H raise|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@S-2@H looks normal, nowadays (nobody doubles with north)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: in fact the most reasonable line - but unfortunately it didn't work|pg||
nt|josj: Ino won the seniors, I think|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sybarra: was suggested by one spec  " it guarantees 3 tens and the K of trumps lol"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @hJ on S had solved a lot of problems for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NV 1NT would appeal. red is another story. tough call for N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With a singleton? this time minor!|pg||
nt|werge: Here North has no re-bid problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you're on form Carl|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am with you on that guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: both wrong|pg||
nt|sharkey: Sry - S didnt follow up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no - surprising|pg||
nt|xenya: with a less revealing auction, board 3 might produce a swing for the Dutch|pg||
nt|athene: really 1@S?|pg||
nt|athene: the rationale is, you are stuck after 1@H - 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah well, what do i know|pg||
nt|MolvaM: eymen a√ß√Ωk milli tak√Ωm√Ωm√Ωz√Ωn gen√ß oyuncusu|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: without the @D10 the defence could still have prevailed|pg||
nt|frankaus: may get to (failing) @H game here|pg||
nt|cindy: cant imagine trying to get to game with S hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: N in 3@H here in Open|pg||
nt|sharkey: well - 13-15 NT it seems - shaded version|pg||
nt|snorris: singelton and all..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3rd in hand... anything goes|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..but turns up with 13 imps in|pg||
nt|cindy: too good for 1N imo|pg||
nt|cindy: probably work out well though since @h10 looks like the lead|pg||
nt|bg: flat 7 should bring pass unless NS starting already to push abit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i have great respect for Hanlon, he must have some cunning scheme|pg||
nt|werge: agree|pg||
nt|athene: for example, 1@H - 1NT; 2@D - 2@H|pg||
nt|idblu: lets try again Al :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my ?  referred to East's bid|pg||
nt|santyclz: I x with n.  That's because my pd declares better than I do.|pg||
nt|idblu: so did I....he wasn't ;istening|pg||
nt|josj: except if there are 2 of them|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pairs or teams?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: after a look at the S hand, I's open 1D as N|pg||
nt|mpny: i do not think 5 would keep EW out of slam anyway|pg||
nt|josj: teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does anyone have a link to some photos?   Nice to see what they look like|pg||
nt|yo_yo: are there any hunks for example :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: same auction to 3@H in both rooms|pg||
nt|cindy: dont want to discourage them from maybe bidding spades|pg||
nt|frankaus: the red game is tempting|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1NT seems straightforward now by S|pg||
nt|sharkey: E not done yet...|pg||
nt|snorris: this is getting exiting|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a clear P on S|pg||
nt|snorris: will w pass?|pg||
nt|snorris: might loose it rigth away if 3 times @h after a loosing @c finesse|pg||
nt|cindy: oops  now what|pg||
nt|bg: sproty balance|pg||
nt|bg: sporty|pg||
nt|snorris: a good contract|pg||
nt|snorris: presuming @d is 3-2|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this auction may get there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don¬¥t like this bidding. With this strong hand 1@d must be the right bid. How can he now show 45 in @h/@d?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bidding 5@C makes it awkward for EW to use Blackwood|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes 7 is quite good, but seems unbiddable|pg||
nt|caitlin: they off to the races now|pg||
nt|othered1: And isn't bidding 7 saying that they are almost certain to be in small slam in the other room?|pg||
nt|bg: good sequence 2nt asks for feature probably|pg||
nt|caitlin: no way they know about 5@CX swing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But they stopped in 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- unless playing with New Zealander -- DBL with North never would occur to me|pg||
nt|MolvaM: kendisi t√ºrkiyeyi √ßin de yap√Ωlan d√ºnya √æampiyonas√Ωnda temsil etti 2008 de|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cindy: i think sproty is good adjective here :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: perhaps he refrained from raising for fear of aiding opps?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not that they need it...|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Bruce |pg||
nt|caitlin: won't envision Joey underleading Ace|pg||
nt|caitlin: will they risk it?|pg||
nt|caitlin: :) we are always very proud to say Bruce is Canadian:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is another potential slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If I not will stand up for my opening I should have passed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree Ralf|pg||
nt|athene: now you are a bit good to pass and a bit weak for 2NT|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Dream on|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: will S stop here?|pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lets hope you open diamonds as you may be passed out|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we dont use BW with a void Mike now :)|pg||
nt|othered1: How do you find you 8-card @S fits on part score hands?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 1nt must be 14-16 or e would have invited.|pg||

nt|mariner1: our S a little more aggressive|pg||
nt|cindy: might make with @d lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NonVul i would pass with S hand. Vul S is worried about N having e.g. AKxxxx and J of diamonds & stiff spade|pg||
nt|sharkey: not too many entries in N....|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and will probably smile when seeing the table|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep...sneaks home I think|pg||
nt|panja: y, this was based on 32 trumps AND @CK onside|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes if @s10 doesn¬¥t drop|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure i like 3@H|pg||
nt|snorris: after this "reverse" in north they will bid it...I think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: even if they play strong @c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may well, south may think partner has a singleton spade for example|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only after 1nt|pg||

nt|werge: Close to slam here... - without a @h-lead!|pg||
nt|panja: in the meantime, NS seem to have missed a game on B20|pg||
nt|othered1: Not my style|pg||
nt|snorris: 11 tricks easy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that's a lot of cloud to line|pg||
nt|thommos: needed to lead a @H to beat it - I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. I like 6@H|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes at other table Joey Silver from Montreal and John Carruthers from Toronto|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry I don't know the China Women's team but if anyone does, tell us please|pg||
nt|b_eymen: ahaha|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this is website I have|pg||
nt|sharkey: E may have to duck @H lead from N|pg||
nt|snorris: the only problem is north might move 6 @d to 6 nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is usually my partners who pass out|pg||
nt|cindy: have you been drinking marshall ?|pg||
nt|idblu: thats a live possibility|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since about the age of 18, but not tonight|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this can go off it seems|pg||
nt|idblu: about 1@D being passed|pg||
nt|idblu: it prob shld go down|pg||
nt|irwinbo: a spade may beat it|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: if the defence set up a spade before the club is knocked out|pg||
nt|idblu: need the @S return tho|pg||
nt|bg: 4s 3nt both ok just need double hook inspades|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all   |pg||
nt|fabsayc: something like that|pg||
nt|werge: will he make 6 @c?|pg||
nt|geller: Furuta may pass but will probably bid 6nt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The Dutch team have to tighten up the leak|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Fred -- as a Canadian -- home of Kokish -- DBL would be BLASHPHEMY|pg||
nt|idblu: I think E hand evaluates to 11+ with the doubleton @S and @C honors well placed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Jim|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: looks like best lead|pg||
nt|snorris: thats auto...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would try to buy for 2|pg||
nt|caitlin: ooppps|pg||
nt|athene: same after 1@H - 1@S; 2@D - 2@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: wud bid 2@H with E hand - too weak for 2 bids I think?|pg||
nt|shevek: this might make but I have my doubts....|pg||
nt|athene: i think it might be pushing things a bit far to open 1nt with it but it's not outrageous|pg||
nt|chessmaste: China on Nelson!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: Lead out of turn is accepted|pg||
nt|josj: not a good omen, Mark :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: N leads @sk|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhn: Fallenius asked Morath if he showed count or attitude|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but it is important to play @s  from the hand before any other suit|pg||
nt|snorris: how can they not bid game here?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mercifully undoubled|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can cash a few hearts first if they want|pg||
nt|werge: North  should have bid 4 @C - not East...|pg||
nt|sybarra: its just sort of pesky that @S's 3/1 but does not matter here at the end of the day |pg||
nt|b_eymen: 2@c @d ya transfer olsa gerek|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: specs entitled to a partial refund when a 1-level contract is played|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: this my be -1, but ok with spades the other way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi cindy|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello cindy,  welcome |pg||
nt|thommos: On @H lead and continuation 3@Hs and 2@Ss|pg||
nt|athene: yes, with east's actual hand, he would just raise hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but i mean those auctions are what west had in mind when he rejected the 1@H opener|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 10 tricks looks very difficult to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think you could push to 2 NT after 2@H if you opened the hand 1@H Will|pg||
nt|Walddk4: China has 5 IMPs more than shown on the scoreboard. They won an appeal|pg||
nt|athene: there's certainly a lot of work to do here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: her ma√ß 16 board s√ºr√ºyor|pg||
pc|d3|nt|idblu: same def in the OR|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: club loses the tempo|pg||
nt|idblu: I would rather play the @H K than a @C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as it happens, but i think the real issue is how W expects to get in enough times. maybe lead a high one to indicate that you are just trying to get PD off possible later endplay, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then E would not be so afraid that W has a stiff spoade|pg||
nt|irwinbo: if i played a club, i would play the 6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: we see the hands of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: leading a heart stakes everything on position of heart ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club is worth considering but must lead a higher one|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like a @h lead is best for the defence|pg||
nt|geller: In the qfinal Japan open was losing 36-0 to China (same 4 members as now) before recovering for an easy win|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s lead for me|pg||
nt|geller: "tighten up the leak", "plug the dikes".....   Let's not go there.  :-)|pg||
nt|idblu: true...bid your 5carders|pg||
nt|othered1: I woudn't criticize taking invitational action on east's hand, I just wouldn't do it.|pg||
nt|xenya: but the @Cs are so favourable for declarer that he will have no trouble making it i think|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Jim|pg||
pc|d4|nt|snorris: wrong black suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: more @C |pg||
nt|panja: 2@S rebid, holding three Aces..and Jack in partner's suit..is on the conservative side..I dont know what else was available for South though|pg||
nt|cindy: yes luckily neither have the hand to dbl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But as the cards lie declarer may get out for 1 down|pg||
nt|snorris: this is awful bidding|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: North does not want to play in diamonds it seems|pg||
nt|snorris: thinks s has 5 @h and 4 @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now they have missed the best contract. I cannot see how they will make this without a favourable lead|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems harder for East to lead hearts though|pg||
nt|thommos: hi cindy|pg||
nt|caitlin: didnt expect that finesse|pg||
nt|athene: now a diamond i think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now  to count 10 tricks...hmm|pg||
nt|yo_yo: spade?|pg||
nt|athene: you want to set up some diamond ruffs, with the possibility of throwing @S3 on a club later on, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: west in the other room thought it was a 1nt opener as well|pg||
nt|athene: this must be the norm these days|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|snorris: that was a grave mistake|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: safe club exit..|pg||
nt|snorris: not playing @s|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess it's a "mixed raise"?|pg||
nt|cindy: still -7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W's chickens now come home to roost. he got what he asked for|pg||
nt|geller: The other semi is Oz vs. China ladies.    |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|werge: Because they have seen too many bad opening bids...!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ASnd the beginning of this was the first 1@h|pg||
nt|snorris: reverse dummy maybe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ??????|pg||
nt|snorris: well this will surely not win|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think NS will not tell anyone about this board|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so we will never know Hanlon's cunning plan unfortunately|pg||
nt|idblu: 7 losers opposite an opening bid|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sharkey: nice|pg||
nt|snorris: sneaky..|pg||
nt|werge: Best way to avoid the overtrick, seems to be to lead the @C 9...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's where i was going Fred -- was East too good for 2@H or not -- i think very close -- especially since @C location only presumptive|pg||
nt|sybarra2: spots work well for declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: oh yes, and @Hs, too, are nice|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wilkinsona: but tough guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perfect!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could get messy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It took 6 rounds of bidding in OPen to get to the same contract|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 10 grup var ve her grupta 8 er tak√Ωm var|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I like the 3 heart call.. why let th oppo bid spades|pg||
nt|thommos: the Club lead is normal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Most of players will lead a @c, Yes|pg||
nt|thommos: Still some work for Declarer - @H now and has to find the endplay|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - in my coffee I see 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no a @h lead and you have 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Are you a soothsayer Hans?|pg||
nt|thommos: a @C also lead in the Open room|pg||
nt|werge: I also like 6 @H for sure|pg||
nt|geller: The official score still hasn't been updated  http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest09/necj.html|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@H then double isn't bad at all for a description of east, if you can accept making a limit bid and bidding again.|pg||
nt|idblu: presumptive but odds on they fit with pard's @C or were over the overcaller|pg||
nt|arigun: @dK uygun yerde 3nt yapilabiliyor|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|snorris: take @c and then @h|pg||
nt|thommos: This will now make 11|pg||
nt|idblu: usually worth a try|pg||
nt|idblu: 14 losers = game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yani herkes grubunda 7 ma√ß yapacak ve ilk 3e giren tak√Ωmlar knockout a√æamas√Ωna kalacak|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bg: interesting play decision go allout with club split or ruff a dia and settle for six|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes 3@H 2@S and 2@C, while becaus they split 4-4 only loses 4@Ds|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzhn: and it showed attitude|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Misguessed spades. Now at least 2 down|pg||
nt|cindy: didnt clear that hurdle|pg||
nt|snorris: reverse dummy and a sqezze ?|pg||
nt|snorris: squezze|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|snorris: only 12|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will not do, but in 6@h it had worker with a reverse dummy|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer knows the @SK is right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult to lead out of turn with screens|pg||
nt|yo_yo: presumably they have screens?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|arigun: defans icin @s baslangici, sonrasinda boslanirsa @c devami kontrati zorlayabilir ancak dagilim dekleranin lehine|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: if you look at NEC teams and players,  you will see many international stars are in this tourney |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well we can see this will not make looking at the cards, but Hanlon will be trying to make it|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: worked.. just witn a @h lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after 1nt there can be a problem if partner not has a @d suit (not bidden)|pg||
nt|athene: the defence could never cash the spade then play a club through|pg||
nt|athene: a very delicate hand, trying to set up winners everywhere and avoid 4 losers along the way|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to draw two rounds of trumps to enjoy a club trick|pg||
nt|athene: and that means only one diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: he must be hoping for one diamond ruff, one pitch on the @SQ and one on the @CK|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|xenya: small slam is as cold as it can be -- a grand would require some inspired play in @Cs|pg||
nt|athene: but south can ruff the @SQ|pg||
nt|MolvaM: do√∞unun 5-5 maj√∂r√º olmas√Ω ilgin√ß|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sharkey: I think a mere 4@D from W is better - 7@H could easily be on|pg||
nt|sharkey: makes now|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Easy - but hard to get accepted!|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: yeah|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Nothing to the play here|pg||
nt|arigun: dogu 2 tur @c oynamak icin el tutamiyor|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ba√æka masalarda deklarasyon farkl√Ω geli√æebilir e√∞er do√∞unun b√∂yle eli g√∂sterecek 1 konvansiyonu olur ise|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: WOW i missed the last bid. i guess S thought he had a slam try|pg||
nt|athene: no, can't make i don't think|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ama bu masada kuzey 1 k√∂r dedikten sonra do√∞udaki oyuncunun b√ºt√ºn heyecan√Ω ka√ßt√Ω|pg||
nt|arigun: o durumda 2@d oynanmayacagi kesin :)|pg||
nt|b_eymen: bu tip elleri direkt a√ßmak genelde pozitif sonu√ß veriyor|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: now he has to play @Ss from top|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: 630 at other table|pg||
pc|s6|nt|geller: 6nt would have been described as "safe as houses" but in the current financial climate SAFER than houses is a better description|pg||
pc|sT|nt|shevek: cold now?|pg||
nt|athene: on a trump back|pg||
nt|sharkey: no|pg||
nt|athene: declarer couldn't make on a trump back because he couldn't cash either black winner|pg||
nt|athene: but now he can do it|pg||
nt|sharkey: @SQ will be trumped|pg||
nt|athene: just crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: and trump coup south|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff, diamond ruff, @SQ|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|cindy: its -3 now, right ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|santyclz: Really?|pg||
nt|othered1: playing west for 109 or 108, not unreasonable.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: i don't think they have spade game, so see no need to preempt|pg||
nt|xenya: CR is in 6N too|pg||
nt|othered1: only 1?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcarroll: They are in 3NT in Open |pg||
nt|snorris: awful chashing 12 tricks in 2 @s|pg||
nt|petergill: Or 10 tricks as the play is going|pg||
nt|werge: They play better than they bid!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a rebis of 2@s on 16 high and a 6-card suit!|pg||
nt|petergill: Earlier, declarer could have safely set up the long club trick.|pg||
nt|snorris: throws @h 12 tricks|pg||
nt|bg: 2 down |pg||
pc|hK|nt|snorris: north has recovered well|pg||
nt|arigun: bu el degil belki cunki rakip gaza gelip zon diyor|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: ok, ping-pong here :) but of course it's an impossibly hard hand without sight of all the cards|pg||
pc|c4|nt|MolvaM: beklendi√∞i gibi 2nolu boarddan mersin 9 kazand√Ω|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cindy: right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with a throw in. now W can keep @sK9 and @d Q108|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cindy: couldnt see good :-)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest09/nec_bulj.html|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult even seeing all 4 hands for me|pg||
nt|shevek: 6 imps to China|pg||
nt|sharkey: S have both high @H so no promotion for N|pg||
nt|sharkey: IMPs to Oz players :)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As declarer I like everyone to cooperate with me,,,,,,|pg||
nt|sharkey: Making now - 7 IMPs to the Korean team|pg||
nt|npcjpn: the 5th match data up.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|shevek: @h5 promoted|pg||
nt|athene: north's @H5 gets promoted|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bg: result not unexpectes when balancing withshaky values vul|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: last board now|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our very efficient operator, Johan Wahlberg. Great Job! Many thanks and our appreciation to the Swedish Bridge Federation and Jan ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: Kamras for allowing us to broadcast from this event. Thanks to my very learned fellow commentators Shirley, George, Vladimir, Roland and Ralf for their wit and perceptive comments ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes!|pg||
nt|sybarra: will we wait for final scores?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: now 8 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|sybarra: got carried away in the other room |pg||
nt|chessmaste: small mistake by South for an overtrick|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|snorris: will play on e with the q of @d|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: *OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: ouch.....|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: just a tiny mistiming in the trump coup|pg||
nt|athene: had to lead the small spade before the @SQ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's hard to read|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||

mb|1C|nt|daman: potential for slam here|pg||
nt|daman: or 3@D x|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This concludes our second official broadcast from Sweden. We are hopeful that we get many more. It's a treat for our many spectators to see Sweden's leading players in action. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sweden is a world class bridge nation|pg||
nt|roswolf: and another possible slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thanks all. Nice to work with you. I wish you a nice sunday afternoon|pg||
nt|sybarra: I believe we talked yesterday about the club "we" are seeing with 2200+ members |pg||
nt|roswolf: why didnt south show spades as well?|pg||
nt|sybarra: quite a large contingent |pg||
nt|mariner1: guilty by proximity|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - they earned it|pg||
nt|snorris: will n-s go to 2nt?|pg||
nt|snorris: 1 @s-1nt, 2nt?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 15 vs 7 - dont think so...|pg||
nt|snorris: 16|pg||
nt|sharkey: excuse me 16|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @d a splint? for me anyway|pg||
nt|petergill: Australian NS at other table: Klinger - Mullamphy System Card is at http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Systems/Open/Australia/k...|pg||
nt|petergill: linger-mullamphy.pdf ... but after the last hand perhaps you don't want to look at it? |pg||
nt|snorris: 4 in a M|pg||
nt|snorris: 5 @c or 4@hs?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: always longest suit|pg||
nt|cindy: ty :)|pg||
nt|werge: Quiet boards this morning|pg||
nt|mpny: SA is not a grand|pg||
nt|caitlin: this one harder to get to|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if their suits are agreed to be very good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after winning with @c10 he had all 13|pg||
nt|yo_yo: interesting that the Chinese ladies didnt try for game|pg||
nt|wygbe1: well 4h will probably make |pg||
nt|b_eymen: sanmam pa√æam|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: NS dont make 4@S here..because of @C ruff..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but be bid?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: They are off Nelson!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yep|pg||
nt|josj: once again N holds QJx in a vital suit, this time to beat a slam|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 19-20  i am informed ty Al|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so they might not get too high|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: could get murky now|pg||
nt|xenya: are we sure 3@D is not a 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 @S - 1 NT - 2@C - 2@S?|pg||
nt|snorris: then there might be a fight|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 1@s - 1nt - 2@c -2@s?|pg||
nt|snorris: west will bid on though|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, 4@D splinter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: mind you, my openings are sounder than this one|pg||
nt|snorris: might be hard to reach|pg||
nt|cindy: looks like 3N this time|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a good case for opening 1S. 1C is clear second choice for me|pg||
nt|idblu: the same 1/2 imp?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hard now to stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: green so can afford to be conservative |pg||
nt|irwinbo: is looks right to me|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be tricky to defend 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think they will get there|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont like to distort my distribution with a full opening bid|pg||
nt|josj: they should, however, as slam is well over 75%|pg||
nt|josj: board should be a push at 6@C-1|pg||
mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: in the US the green party is NOT conservative|pg||
nt|snorris: 5 @h on|pg||
nt|panja: I dont like E's pass....|pg||
nt|werge: Then 5 @h is lay-down, South has given the solution for palying @d-suit|pg||
nt|cindy: next :-)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: does anyone of you know what 2@d opening means?|pg||
nt|snorris: think w has to bid it himself|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @d on a nt seems to be majors|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west likely to bid it, though missed in the other room|pg||
nt|idblu: 3rd chair allows a 4 card major opening...especially with a suit as good as this|pg||
nt|cindy: dont play in a womens event|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good principle cindy. but i don;t really see what bad can happen after 1S|pg||
nt|cindy: they will rake you across the coals for doing that|pg||
nt|sybarra: jamming the auction perhaps to no avail |pg||
nt|thommos: hard to bid 7S now|pg||
nt|sharkey: in @D it is - but dont think they'll end up in 7@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you want to check out EW Convention Card from 2007, try [sorry, i still don't know how to make smaller URLs]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2007BermudaBowlShanghai/bermuda-bowl/Japan/TeramotoTakayama.pdf|pg||
nt|caitlin: they likely have another way to show weaker preempts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might make if you just blast to slam|pg||
nt|athene: well it was an interesting bidding decision for east, facing a strong notrump - perhaps the australian's 1NT is a point stronger than the Chinese?|pg||
nt|sharkey: In OR W didnt inquire with Stayman - just blasted into 4@H via transfer.  Cud have missed 4-4 @S fit|pg||
nt|wygbe1: impossible to bid, especially after 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|b_eymen: elemelerde genelede bu tip elller|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: wonder if they had a 2 suited call |pg||
nt|caitlin: at other table @D lead from North but did take @SQ finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now 2@S|pg||
nt|josj: 6nt is down a lot :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|daman: they could have had 800 in 3@D x|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I dont know their defence bidding, but this can be a 2-suiter with @s and @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: I believe there were no alert on 3D|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS may play 2/1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I¬¥m not quite sure of 4@d. It looks like E has red cards and it could help them to find the @d split|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @c|pg||
nt|idblu: pards a passed hand...you expect to get to a game?|pg||
nt|cindy: well  i want to have a chance to get to game if its right|pg||
nt|sharkey: guess it proves that science not always better :)|pg||
nt|athene: i like that action|pg||
nt|athene: it's pretty rare that you want to play in spades with west's hand facing 1nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think the Chines Women use a 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nothing showing on web page about carryover, but haven't read conditions of contest|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2 karo: 3 renk ile soruyor|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I wonder how ambiguous east's hand is in their style|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which made the chosen line clearly a swing line|pg||
nt|xenya: easy 4@H for NS. There is a cheap @D save for EW but they are ublikely to find it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: had anyone of you bid 2@d on E? I had|pg||
nt|roswolf: this isnt|pg||
nt|josj: very well bid btw|pg||
nt|roswolf: east offering a choice|pg||
mb|2H|nt|panja: in these superfit situations it pays to bid one more...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but, then only 9 tricks were made|pg||
nt|snorris: then 3@h and ..|pg||
nt|bg: same auction as before N had a feature here none will settle in game|pg||
nt|othered1: AS the cards lie, east isn't a favorite at all to find @S lead|pg||
nt|idblu: the teams that finished ahead of the team they were playing had a 1/2 imp c/o|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if  3@D-3@H 4@H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes |pg||
nt|josj: the quanti raise often suggests a minor|pg||
nt|josj: (or two)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: do√∞uda 3l√º pik ara√æt√Ωrmas√Ω |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2@S forcing?|pg||
nt|sybarra: W might have found it |pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|werge: Passive E/W - 5 @D...|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice lead, but declarer can pitch dummy's third @D on @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but if half imp comes into play in 64 board match we're in for a great time tonight|pg||
nt|idblu: in the 1/4's and semis|pg||
nt|idblu: good bid 2@H|pg||
nt|sybarra2: waiting for next X?|pg||
nt|idblu: might inspire S to bid more|pg||
mb|3C|nt|barbyh: is this conventional or a psych|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if club system?|pg||
nt|snorris: thinking about 2nt?|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: declarer got the clubs right to score 9 tricks OR, even after a heart lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When playing 1nt forcing, there always is problems with hands like S|pg||
nt|snorris: well done west|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thought it was 3 clubs last time|pg||
nt|cindy: N was sorta fixed for a bid|pg||
nt|idblu: keycarding with a void hard to work out|pg||
nt|cindy: what could he do ?|pg||
nt|idblu: he was strapped...on a guess|pg||
nt|bg: 7 spades would make provided S cashes AK dia before 3 rd club|pg||
nt|mpny: apparently|pg||
nt|idblu: almost came into play last night against JUICE|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 rounds of @C to discard dummy's @D -- but great try|pg||
nt|arigun: 3@c makul kontrat, hicbir zon'un sansi yok|pg||
nt|MolvaM: do√∞u ise 2 k√∂r ile 3l√º pik yok ama 4l√º k√∂r var dedi|pg||
nt|arigun: Batinin 2@d su 3. renk, ileri dagilim soruyor|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: once again the Chinese woman win the auction|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Tony, 2@c was a little bit weak|pg||
nt|snorris: east knows south has 4 @h so didnt dear bid more|pg||
nt|thommos: this lead will be well received by declarer|pg||
nt|werge: With this lead = 3 NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if they play weak jump shifts it's forcing yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW are using upside-down count & attitude, so 8@H = frown|pg||
nt|othered1: And, indeed, at other table south is declarer after a multi and transfer auction|pg||
nt|yo_yo: smolen in action :)|pg||
nt|athene: @SAK and a trump to lose here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sharkey: Yes - If 1 NT forcing 2@S shud show a mere preference or weak @S raise|pg||
nt|snorris: @d lead?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -2!|pg||
nt|snorris: might get it undoubled'|pg||
nt|panja: no point in defending against superfit..you never know what will get ruffed..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: however steals the contract... perhaps as south has shown hearts|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: its not really right though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1S hardly prevents me from getting to game|pg||
nt|idblu: well they got to game...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may have to drop that spade Q to stand a chance..|pg||
nt|irwinbo: they rate to go down on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|idblu: that he won't do|pg||
nt|idblu: maybe they play Roth-Stone?|pg||
nt|idblu: N passes 12+ hands frequently|pg||
nt|werge: They are too happy with their double-stopper in @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: some play it constructive I believe|pg||
nt|werge: Run to 4 @H|pg||
nt|mpny: 4H is making|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt instead of a better 4@h|pg||
nt|sharkey: S doesnt know pd has 6@H|pg||
nt|mpny: I hate the dbl. the opponents are unlimited, your Spades are not that great. why should partner have a trick|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud bid 4@D|pg||
nt|caitlin: same auction open room|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tinyurl for cc: http://tinyurl.com/boohrd|pg||
nt|caitlin: Joe, we know why Roland 'hired' you:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now @H7 = current count [odd]|pg||
nt|santyclz: For my comedy relief?|pg||
nt|caitlin: that too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think heart 7 was actually spade signal|pg||
nt|yo_yo: frue will be glad to be dummy, to recover from that last one|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like the double indicated @Ds -- good use of opponents' transfers |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yesterday the slams I saw them bid were all making|pg||
nt|arigun: 3lu @s vey 4lu @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: i think the pass is curious|pg||
nt|snorris: still should win 8 tricks|pg||
nt|caitlin: also in 4 in open room|pg||
nt|shevek: real score is 64-29 due to an appeal|pg||
mb|3N|nt|barbyh: oops|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 9 with a right guess in @c|pg||
nt|snorris: the @cs are the key|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: once again 9 tricks pos if declare gets the clubs|pg||
nt|snorris: small @h from west to show @c|pg||
nt|panja: how does W show that he wants @C now?|pg||
nt|snorris: interest|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same bidding next door|pg||
nt|irwinbo: for all of its 11 points, the north hand is only worth 1nt over 1 diamond|pg||
nt|cindy: hard to bid 7 without knowing about trump Q|pg||
nt|thommos: it is not a good 7, |pg||
nt|sybarra: at the moment,  S probably just as happy to be in 6 |pg||
nt|cindy: and they dont have it even|pg||
nt|sharkey: @S lead @C shift|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not show this over 2@s with 3@h instead of 2nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Mike - cud have been overtricks too|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in evaluating S hand it could help too|pg||
nt|wygbe1: it gave n a chance to upgrade his stiff d, if s elected to show a superaccept|pg||
nt|xenya: sure|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but it should be a flat board|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/press/pdf/2007_sekai_3.pdf|pg||
nt|josj: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: photo of JAPAN OPEN Team at the top|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: not a pause and small @H though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10 tricks after that lead and only 7 with a @s lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very aggressive double - why should a spade lead be best anyway?|pg||
nt|mpny: the C shift should still be easy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Look at dummy,pls|pg||
nt|idblu: @S to A @D down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: diamonds need to be led twice from dummy so..|pg||
nt|cindy: no it isnt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: i√æe 22 puanl√Ωk bir 3NT kontrat√Ω|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: so who leads a @H on this auction?|pg||
nt|barbyh: whoever is on lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: so a push |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so the landslide continues|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the lead solves the problem of how to play trumps|pg||
nt|b_eymen: tref partaj olsa bu dag√Ωl√Ωma 5@c yaparrd√Ω|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cindy: thing universal heart lead|pg||
nt|cindy: think|pg||
nt|snorris: semms like it|pg||
nt|arigun: sanirim 3. renk sonraasi 3@c zon forcingi anlasildi, aksi takdirde dogunun pass demesi lazim minimum eli var|pg||
nt|b_eymen: ger√ßi onauda yapamazd√Ω tref atag√Ωna|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: NS could have competed here, too, but can't make much if EW find the @C ruffs|pg||
nt|othered1: But opening lead there was also @D|pg||
nt|shevek: 64 - 29.5 actually (Oz has 0.5 carryover)  from Elmer|pg||
nt|athene: now you could throw either spades or clubs on the diamonds|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: curious or timid. like the 60's film "i am curious yellow"|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may need to 'splain  this one  |pg||
nt|snorris: a good jack.. will it help+|pg||
nt|snorris: ?|pg||
nt|panja: y, no need to show any interest...a look at dummy tells you it must be Clubs|pg||
nt|panja: still, I wonder why none of EW doubled....|pg||
nt|snorris: Harada pondering|pg||
nt|snorris: seems|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzhn: "Take a chance with the 9|pg||
nt|caitlin: by West|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: but he found @cK|pg||
nt|idblu: all conjecture now|pg||
nt|idblu: if he cashes a 2nd @D he will be happier|pg||
nt|thommos: qC next is ok|pg||
nt|idblu: but @DK before pitching is better technique|pg||
nt|sharkey: woman intuition may apply :) - looks like down 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you can't argue with that|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as I play - with a weak hand I bid 2 @h over 1@s showing a 6-card suit and 2@d with a stronger hand, so 3@h is my bid after 2@s |pg||
nt|sharkey: never tried....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not worth it|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: Agree Ralf - but you mave a a problem getting to 3NT then|pg||
nt|idblu: was a great lead...once again|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cindy: heh|pg||
nt|cindy: i am curious green|pg||
nt|frankaus: i use green as NV  no doubt u have worked it out|pg||
nt|snorris: then he should be in 5!|pg||
nt|thommos: or ruff @H club to the Q|pg||
nt|idblu: @D10 looks right..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: won't help|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|wilkinsona: tries the spade hook|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i hate 4333 hands|pg||
nt|idblu: stalling for time ... 0% play now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: plain sailing|pg||
nt|athene: but the clubs only require two pitches not three|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a finess in @c for safe|pg||
pc|h4|nt|barbyh: hope so|pg||
nt|cindy: well    they have 24 hcp|pg||
nt|werge: But East should havr cashed his other red Ace|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: claim coming |pg||
nt|ahollan1: as advertised -- well done on both sides|pg||
nt|idblu: that certainly won't|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cindy: probably makes 5C but tuff to bid that|pg||
nt|snorris: running home?|pg||
nt|panja: small @D is risky|pg||
nt|panja: had this been a doubled contract..on the @C3 return..E might have been tempted to play a small @D...|pg||
nt|bg: 1 imp to Japan|pg||
nt|sharkey: unexpected - but dont think it matters|pg||
nt|athene: just a question now of how to play trumps|pg||
nt|athene: probably @HA and another|pg||
nt|MolvaM: biraz zorlama bir kontrat ve batacak gibi duruyor|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: need your guessing shoes on for 5 @C but sure close to it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @hA and all is over|pg||
nt|arigun: sayet batinin 3@c i zon forcingi ise, davet eli ile ne yapmak lazim |pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: i hate more hands than that. there must be at least 5000 hands i hate|pg||
nt|santyclz: In a fair world, w would ruff the 3rd @c.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bg: sry|pg||
nt|thommos: A high @C was lead in the OR|pg||
nt|athene: or not :)|pg||
nt|athene: i was thinking Del'Monte might have been worried about a spade over-ruff now|pg||
nt|athene: but probably he trusts that if the defence had a spade ruff, they would have taken it|pg||
nt|athene: so playing for them to have misdefended is just a grosvenor coup|pg||
nt|santyclz: Simplifying the play.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cindy: just have to find @dQ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is the women's team the finalists at Beijing?|pg||
nt|bg: should have drawn trump before second dia doesnt matter here but it could have with hearts 4-1|pg||
nt|shevek: good point raised by Roland, maybe 32 bds in the semi-final not enough?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mpny: well now -1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no entrance to @sK|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cindy: that you have hated ?|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|snorris: if s has 4 @s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if so they know what they are doing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Teramoto having hard time believing partner has the perfect @S holdin|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Delmonte should finesse a second time so he needs to return to hand|pg||
nt|idblu: who said life was fair|pg||
pc|cT|nt|wilkinsona: can be -3 now...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: yes guess so |pg||

pc|c8|nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Not even trying for 9?|pg||

nt|snorris: 40-0!!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Im not sure I follow wests pass of 1 spade x...|pg||
nt|snorris: well.. no not enough|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well done to the ladies|pg||
nt|sharkey: difference in style - NS only got to 2@D other room...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very much so - the final pass looks rather pessimistic|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is becoming embarassing|pg||
nt|xenya: even 6@D would have been profitable for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fred -- i'm sure that was me|pg||
nt|idblu: I thought so|pg||

nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|cindy: 3N could be a struggle |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 40-0 after 6 boards! unbelieveable!|pg||
nt|irwinbo: the problem with i diamond is that when partner bids one spade you have to bid 2nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but no use of that with only singleton @s|pg||

mb|3S|nt|othered1: Compare this hand with the last east opened -- that's a pretty good range in a limited opening system.|pg||
nt|snorris: like an honor in @s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a lot of matches have had wild swings of momentum|pg||
nt|athene: south has a good hand for a non-forcing 2@D bid but not many people play that outside Poland|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: roses are saying "we've senior big lead and are not scared"|pg||
nt|cindy: harhar|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok folks,  I am going to leave you, breakfast meeting are not my thing, but have an early one tomorrow |pg||
nt|sharkey: and almost opening hand?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but we didn¬¥t see what EW discarded on @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But W had made 5@h after the 4@d bid!|pg||
nt|snorris: better pass..|pg||
nt|snorris: south|pg||
nt|idblu: yes...I am surprised he didn't make 7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: miss a vulnerable game. Gain 12 imps. Too easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: there you go |pg||
nt|fabsayc: lol|pg||
nt|caitlin: but he had no other bid:)|pg||
nt|othered1: That, invitational, feels about what it is worth.  But maybe 2@D forces to far|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe showing 0-7 :)|pg||
nt|athene: sorry WEST has a good hand...|pg||
nt|wygbe1: tough bid for s here|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i think 3h would be my choice|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu 3 karo a√ß√Ω√æ√Ω biraz insiyatifli oldu|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mariner1: only part scores here|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @s a fit bid it seems|pg||
nt|ralfwil: One of my principles. Dont tell too mych in a competitive bidding|pg||
nt|ralfwil: much....|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: suppose so..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: rather strange to land in only 2@d in OR|pg||
nt|josj: this time it seems to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzhq: you're welcome|pg||
nt|yo_yo: all happy and smiling except for the ladies captain :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: g'night shirley|pg||
nt|barbyh: bye shirl|pg||
nt|sybarra: gl with all the rest,  g'night all |pg||
nt|sharkey: claimed before we cud Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only to help partner|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: has to get the spades right here|pg||
nt|snorris: arrgg..|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|werge: 2@C should include a weak minor-2|pg||
nt|xenya: there have been several suggestions from the kibitzers as to the meaning of the 2@C bid|pg||
nt|werge: D = do not lead @D?|pg||
nt|idblu: yes...7@D once they find the fit|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the @H Q falling makes 4@H but not an obvious play |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: In this position I play D showing a 4-card suit and 1@s shows a 5-card suit. Do youplay like that?|pg||
nt|irwinbo: can't|pg||
nt|caitlin: he often says...now watch them run hearts at me or whatever|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if south could have bid a non-invitational 3@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: another advers sacrifice|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 4@D bid is a strong clue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may well do so |pg||
nt|snorris: the woes will never end|pg||
nt|snorris: I do|pg||
nt|thommos: what do you all play the pass from South as?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@c checkback|pg||
nt|xenya: all very different|pg||
nt|idblu: try Canada....|pg||
nt|santyclz: Mirror distribution.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i had skewed perspective in other states too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now 4@D, ace asking?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=BAL 8+ game force|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does he know something.....|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be murder|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|snorris: 5 @h only -1|pg||
nt|snorris: but no|pg||
nt|ralfwil: often difficult in reversed vulnerable|pg||
nt|panja: neither the 1@C opening not this pass of 4@S by W bid are easy to understand...I mean the ratinale behind either|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 2NT is a puppet to 3@c, then 3NT shows 3@s and 4@h.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: or cue all the way |pg||
nt|idblu: 3@S Q|pg||
nt|idblu: cue|pg||
nt|josj: 2@D is safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: sensible run out|pg||
nt|MolvaM: gene de makul kontrata gelindi|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 3@d 4@h daha iyi bi dec|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mariner1: 4@H could be the contract which has tough chances|pg||
nt|marlowepi: deepfinesse makes 4H i bet|pg||
nt|snorris: 3nt is difficult |pg||
nt|snorris: with @d lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was first push bd |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe righting the ship for Israel |pg||
nt|bg: not sure what those bids meant but contact is right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if NS play 2 way Stayman [part of original Precision]   I like 2@C rather than 2@D - because East will never make a lead directing DBL|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wilkinsona: easy now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: important to play E for the right A with a @d lead, but now....|pg||
nt|snorris: well west doesnt know if east has @ds|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree with @S lead?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no!|pg||
nt|othered1: agree on @S play, but it's not guaranteed|pg||
nt|snorris: can he slip this home+|pg||
nt|snorris: ?|pg||
nt|werge: Yes|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, most would bid 1 spade by west|pg||
nt|cindy: at the 1 level i usually play no preference|pg||
nt|cindy: only at 1 level though|pg||
nt|thommos: above one level as penalty?|pg||
nt|cindy: yes|pg||
nt|thommos: 3NT likely to make 11|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@H invitational values I assume|pg||
nt|athene: this looks to be down only one?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Wang has a good hand for 2@S dont you think?|pg||
nt|othered1: even 3@S needs some racing luck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 1N=14-16, i think hand might be too good, if 15-17, just right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: x@D lead:)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: was one spade like a forcing nt?|pg||
nt|xenya: this will probably fail|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with this super lead|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in Open are in 2@D only|pg||
nt|cindy: the are fluctuating between conservative and aggressive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wish they would let ME do that when i lead|pg||
nt|idblu: tuff dummy to lead into|pg||
nt|cindy: nothing good to do here it seems      another spade ?|pg||
nt|idblu: whtas his is his|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D unlikely to cost|pg||
nt|cindy: i would like to play it penalty at 1 level too but cant get any of my partners to play it that way :)|pg||
nt|athene: for two down, the defence have to get a diamond ruff AND stop the spade ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another good lead|pg||
nt|othered1: How would you play this, needing lots of good things to happen?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dolay√Ωs√Ω ile g√ºney ders almad√Ω. ileride gene a√ßar bu elle 3@d|pg||
nt|b_eymen: 3@s 4@h|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ta ki zon ka√ß√Ωrana kadar|pg||
nt|arigun: 5@d major ataklara batiyor, 5! in sansi yok, iyi yerde durdu kocaeli takimi|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cindy: this could be a push also|pg||
nt|npcjpn: it is a kind of puppet stayman, in case opener has 5@s.|pg||
nt|thommos: I do play it as penalties|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and extremely unlucky mirroring it is Joe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Liu is out for blood|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: "congressive"--good description|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 times @h maby?|pg||
nt|snorris: maybe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only if EW not take their 2@h and 3@s tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well defence has 5 on top now|pg||
nt|cindy: well then  you could be my partner|pg||
nt|idblu: obviously they have never played rubber bridge|pg||
nt|idblu: @D's have been set|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cindy: yes !!|pg||
nt|cindy: excellent|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: spade does not look unreasonable really|pg||
nt|sharkey: always good in the post-mortem to lead pd's suit - unless you have a very good reason to do otherwise|pg||
nt|mpny: that was a very good stop|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we like that opening bid?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@h is better than 2@s but how stop there?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this may make, if West can hold the trump losers to two|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - only 8 tricks with best defence I think|pg||
nt|xenya: to quote a kibitzer: their CC say "w2 in @D or GF one-suiter or 20-21 bal"  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for spectators -- mirroring is when both hands of partnerhip have exact same distribution|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|panja: down now|pg||
nt|cindy: E wishes he could have S lead again|pg||
nt|bg: double dummy low cub to 9 low spade to queen this could be made|pg||
nt|cindy: poor Levin   always in a potential endplay situation |pg||
nt|bg: drop spade king great play if he finds it|pg||
nt|cindy: he is thinking about it|pg||
nt|sybarra: best if in tempo|pg||
nt|sybarra: or closer tempo than this |pg||
nt|cindy: cant use the phone excuse in live bridge|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence need to find a diamond ruff it seems|pg||
nt|werge: WHICH trump will North lead?|pg||
nt|santyclz: On a trump lead, I'd pull, take the @c finesse eliminate and exit in @hs.  As I said, my pd declares better than I.|pg||
nt|santyclz: If the get to 6@ss, I hope e doesn't x.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: they missed their 4-4 fit in @s and found the best contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so no discards or ruffs available for extra tricks|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: (they)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is now a messy auction|pg||
nt|josj: slam seems far away|pg||
pc|h9|nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|snorris: so now is the time..|pg||
nt|bg: safer to play it as no preference frequency of having right cards for a penalty is too low|pg||
nt|chessmaste: North was lucky his side had an escape from 2@C redoubled|pg||
pc|h2|nt|snorris: the weakness of the strong @c systems is the 1 @d bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be tricky to cash these spades though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If I open with 1@d ny next bid would be 2@C|pg||
nt|athene: whether the @D9 can be read depends on what sort of count signals the Chinese ladies play|pg||
nt|athene: if they play upside down, it has to be a singleton|pg||
nt|shevek: note Ish played the 8 not the 6|pg||
nt|idblu: needs @C hook now|pg||
nt|josj: the X was optimistic, too|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|idblu: the expert duck|pg||
nt|yo_yo: suicidal more like it|pg||
nt|b_eymen: acaba g√∂rd√ºklerim dogrumu|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: club to the eight to make 4|pg||
nt|mariner1: aggresserrvative?|pg||
nt|bg: how many open S with 1 club? How is pard supposed to know what is going on?|pg||
nt|othered1: you might be able to strip the hand of back suits then @HAx and hope something really good happens|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north knows enough now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|snorris: when it doesnt promise the suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now it¬¥s important to play @h|pg||
nt|sharkey: In this case I think E has length in @D as for sure short in @C - thus I thin @D lead stands out|pg||
nt|snorris: agree but might be 11-13 flat and no d|pg||
nt|snorris: suit|pg||
nt|idblu: your line looks right Joe|pg||
pc|c4|nt|snorris: still 10 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no finesse now|pg||
nt|athene: yes, Del'Monte does his best to confuse the issue|pg||
nt|shevek: but that didn't help|pg||
nt|athene: but to no avail|pg||
nt|athene: when you play upside down count you like your singletons to be large|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: gesundheit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What was that! playing @h?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that. if S has AQ they are not likely to beat 1NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what will happen on OR?|pg||
nt|athene: as then partner can tell you don't have a doubleton|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cindy: think think think|pg||
nt|santyclz: A (slight) chance for Japan Open.|pg||
nt|caitlin: and they didn't in open room|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't open those, but it is a popular style today to get in on stuff like this.|pg||
nt|idblu: and she heard you|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer has all the entries to dummy he wants for a @H finesse...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|snorris: moment of truth..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: need the spades now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Not that way!|pg||
nt|idblu: the duck  of the KC! cost a trick|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: could be +2 now for a small swing |pg||
nt|idblu: tournament players like to play almost all 2 level and lower doubles are takeout |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for spectators -- in 2-way Stayman,  1N-2@D = Game Force  and opener will not only show/deny 4 card major, but will also bid 3@C/@D with 5/6 card suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but ruff sluff doesn't help here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wd!|pg||
nt|xenya: we can expect a push on this board|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes withno entries would be forced to play @HAK which works on this layout|pg||
nt|MolvaM: √∂yle gibi|pg||
pc|s5|nt|panja: W must go up with trump Ace next|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: oops|pg||
nt|fabsayc: right play, has pitch|pg||
nt|fabsayc: about 70% slam, but after reverse surely at least 6 at other table, so odds are enough|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|snorris: no sorry|pg||
nt|snorris: c|pg||
nt|snorris: @c ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: still OK, if she reads the hand corrextly|pg||
nt|snorris: this seems all wrong..|pg||
nt|cindy: whats rubber bridge|pg||
nt|santyclz: That's the problem, Al.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hen√ºz tekzip yay√Ωnlanmad√Ω|pg||
mc|9|nt|ralfwil: and single and return!!|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
nt|idblu: money bridge|pg||
nt|yo_yo: malinowsky in 3@H next door|pg||
pg||
qx|c7|st||md|1SQ5HKT763DJ8CQJ53,ST862H542D96532C7,SK9743HAQJDKT7C42,SAJH98DAQ4CAKT986|sv|b|nt|marlowepi: should be a snore at 4H|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H can make here|pg||
nt|snorris: doesnt seem so|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don¬¥t pass on N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and still -1!!!!!|pg||
nt|snorris: strange @h play there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: through the whole play|pg||
nt|werge: 7 NT - to avoid any ruffs...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sorry, yes well done|pg||
nt|othered1: west likely won't get to open 1@C here|pg||
nt|cindy: he could have endplayed S for down 1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Harada has seen 2@d and 2@h tricks and that partner only has 3 @c, so how can he break the contract without 3 @s tricks?|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT with 11 + 11|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i say life is too short for anything|pg||
nt|bg: i need typing lessons|pg||
nt|thommos: you masterpoints may have more regulation than your banks :)|pg||
nt|cindy: thats so true !!!|pg||
nt|idblu: MP's are so inflated anyways|pg||
nt|ralfwil: aha 6@sX!|pg||
nt|thommos: they got to high and needed spades breaking with K onside|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 20 was an 11-point opener as well ;)|pg||
nt|sharkey: i surmise odds against based on your comment?|pg||
nt|mpny: It is just style, not right or wrong. I would not open, but very few would not|pg||
nt|yo_yo: true Mike but it had a few more things going for it|pg||
nt|sharkey: true - think 11 pts ok with shape and suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: stemming the tide --- a push|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and i am betting at least one pair using it in this event|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could have drawn trumps and gone only one down but reasonably enough he tried to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if declarer held 3@H -- it is right, if only 2@H then 4@D and ruff-sluff doesn't help declarer -- well done|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes.  If you know what to do, letting partner who may not choose is a mistake.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Makes on 12.5% of the 4-1 @d breaks too (I think) so maybe better than 70%.|pg||
nt|idblu: re :) crashed :(|pg||
nt|santyclz: Re Furd.|pg||
nt|arigun: guney 1@d acsa kuzeyin cok iyi bir eli var, slame tesebbus ederse butun 5 ler batiyor|pg||
nt|MolvaM: deklaran kozlar√Ω biraz ters oynad√Ω diyelim k√Ωsaca|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: As in the previous session I can recommend Kesleys books about defence...|pg||
nt|snorris: a lucky position in @cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Multi 2@D in OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: Appears EW in OR didnt have a defence prepared for Multi 2@D opening|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on W is OK|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|thommos: bank stocks, no longer inflated|pg||
nt|cindy: a beer costs 1/2 masterpoint|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@H doubled in open room|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C on any balanced hand outside 1nt range|pg||
nt|othered1: That's what I meant about north having count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to really learn the lesson about preventing partner from going wrong.  Hugh Kelsey's  "Killing Defense at Bridge"|pg||
nt|idblu: is E worth a call at this vul?|pg||
nt|santyclz: No, if @ds 4-1 needs 3-3@hs so only  6%.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|panja: this should not be a difficult hand to bid...S shows his long suit, North asks Aces sometime...and that is all that is needed to bid 7|pg||
nt|snorris: dont think they will bid it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 11 point balanced then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually Joey Silver may still be playing it [with John Carruthers]|pg||
mb|1N|nt|wilkinsona: multi seems popular in the East|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @h for me|pg||
nt|snorris: but how to find it+|pg||
nt|snorris: ?|pg||
nt|panja: now...the self preempting effect of the big 2Nt bid comes into picture|pg||
nt|snorris: south will try to show @ds and slammish hand|pg||
nt|athene: double = 4+@S|pg||
nt|shevek: dbl shows 5@s I think|pg||
nt|xenya: at last an excellenet slam|pg||
nt|jaapfr: last 10 boards of nec 2009?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re|pg||
nt|b_eymen: bu durumda elden oynanacaksa koz en iisi  k√ºc√ºk oynamak|pg||
nt|arigun: demekki yorucu=kotu oyuncu teoremi dogruymus, degil 5 4 bile batabiliyormus :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: looks very normal so far|pg||
nt|othered1: But not optimal|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks as though 6 diamonds unlucky for EW here|pg||
nt|snorris: if n had the q of @s instead of q of @d this was the right defence|pg||
nt|sharkey: Precision here?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does that dbl show @S?|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 3 spades might gum up the works|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@H and 6@C both make|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: on 2 @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me - 2@s on S|pg||
nt|snorris: I mean instead of double|pg||
nt|sharkey: W's Dbl may get EW to 4@H perhaps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The reason is that if P has @h 3@h or even 4@h is OK|pg||
nt|sharkey: s's 2@H Pass or Correct?|pg||
nt|werge: After South passed his opening hand...|pg||
nt|panja: they may not have enough space to explore and rule out 3Nt, then ask for Aces|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It¬¥s rather easy if S can find the @d 4-card support|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S just barely has a response....maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 10,5 losers.....|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: that doesnt have the appearance of an optimal OR result though|pg||
nt|cindy: im wondering when we can just send money to the acbl and they will credit our accounts with masterpoints|pg||
nt|sybarra: not with @d7|pg||
nt|idblu: a good call by Hackett|pg||
nt|xenya: however 4@H looks makeable too -- not as easy as 4@S of course|pg||
nt|athene: oh right - ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@S = 3@S |pg||
nt|wygbe1: if south had shot out 4h, they would surely be in slam - but after this start it could be difficult to reach|pg||
nt|xenya: no, Japp -- there will be another 16-board session i think|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ic tx|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think i would go straight to 3NT too|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: thats an ugly 1N   |pg||
nt|bg: every one likes pre-empts suit quality or points or shape  -doesnt seem to matter|pg||
nt|idblu: MP's are now attendance points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is who i meant|pg||
nt|fabsayc: after this is ducked, club queen next|pg||
nt|othered1: Don't knock 2-way Stayman (my preferred method).|pg||
nt|caitlin: night all:) enjoy|pg||
nt|othered1: bigtrain points out that more imps were available for making 3@C (my choice, too.)|pg||
nt|caitlin: early morning appt.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mariner1: in Open W rebid 2N here and E bid 3@D|pg||
nt|cindy: matter of style|pg||
nt|marlowepi: possibly system difference. i like 2S with 100 honors and no aces & suit-oriented hand|pg||
nt|snorris: seems so|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @d maybe orck?|pg||
nt|panja: looks like 4@D is interpreted as transfer by N|pg||
nt|snorris: then 4 @h is accept|pg||
nt|snorris: and 4 @s now a rkcb|pg||
nt|panja: South will try a precipitate jump to 6@D perhaps..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4nt will now solve all problems|pg||
nt|panja: seems like this is a misunderstanding issue..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well declarer may duck this|pg||
nt|snorris: trying...|pg||
nt|cindy: but hate to pass too|pg||
nt|mpny: looks to be|pg||
nt|sybarra: gn Caitlin:)|pg||
nt|shevek: minisplinter|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kibs advise 1@S = 0-3 @S|pg||
nt|athene: a splinter in diamonds won't excite west|pg||
nt|shevek: I don't like it much with stiff ace...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H is balanced raise|pg||
nt|othered1: nice for them to let east get her suit in without risk (3@S, limit, would be a different story)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In the other room North was given a chance to make 2NT - but 3NT looks hard on a heart lead|pg||
nt|MolvaM: do√∞udaki oyuncuya bu g√ºzel el ile 2 batacaks√Ωn deseydik inanmazd√Ω|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: even if i played 2S showed 6 i would still bid 2S|pg||
nt|bg: should have endplayed south  he had already showed five dia  4 hearts and two spades he club finesse was a waste of time|pg||
nt|snorris: the didnt rise to those hights|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11 pts balanced you know Kath - = 3 NT down:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup i would too but maybe be unlucky this time|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cindy: whats wrong with 3@d|pg||
nt|cindy: N passed 2N in open room|pg||
nt|cindy: not sure why|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if that encourages @C shift?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south can give suit preference actually|pg||
nt|othered1: Ithought south might have played @H3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and perhaps NS had to find a club switch|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure W can handle it here either|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont hate to pass|pg||
nt|thommos: yes, looking at 7 clubs and 2 aces, hoping @D are ok|pg||
nt|cindy: my partner always has AJxxxxx|pg||
nt|idblu: however vulnerable you can expect this type of hand|pg||
nt|bg: see on slam they did lose an imp:))|pg||
nt|sharkey: This plays well view S has @CAx|pg||
nt|caitlin: hard to believe over 3N West bid 4@H on own AFTER telling partner once prior he had hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ME?  i've played 2-way Stayman -- and Montreal Relay for further distributional info - since mid 70s|pg||
nt|caitlin: I used to play 2 way stayman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but only when 1N=weak|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: with weak NT|pg||
nt|othered1: So you've had 30 years of good results with it?|pg||
nt|caitlin: moi?|pg||
nt|othered1: Meanwhile, declarer has his work cut out here.|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry not that old:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: I mean I am 30+ but not 30 years of bridge:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the good news for declarer - is that West holds SIX @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: -- and East has no entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who said @HJ and @CJ weren't worth a full 2 points :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and declarer has no tricks, so tell me how to make|pg||
nt|caitlin: 7 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CQ gets ducked -- then what does West do?|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't see any way for declarer to score this.|pg||
nt|santyclz: 8 tricks I think.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if ducked he can play ace and another if he wants|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at some point West making uncomfortable discard AND giving away another round [@C/@H] trick|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe a low @C would give declarer some chances, or maybe not.|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes 8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will delmonte be thinking of a @C slam?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the auction @HJ lead makes a lot of sense too|pg||
nt|othered1: 9 looks right, especially if they play odd-ranked leads|pg||
nt|idblu: all roads lead to 4 making|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which is why i prefer @HJ lead|pg||
nt|idblu: might lead to a pseudo uppercut on occasions|pg||
nt|wygbe1: tough bid by n, who can visualize slam opposite ak of h and 3 small clubs|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Defence will have to be careful|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer might get out for -1 but -2 is likely|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we all lead from Jxxx?|pg||
nt|josj: J9 is just acceptable|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope unless it works|pg||
nt|josj: J9xx|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|cindy: cant be missing vulnerable games|pg||
nt|werge: 1 NT is not my cup of tee - pass or 2 @c|pg||
nt|thommos: yes passing 1@S was an option|pg||
nt|ralfwil: on N, agree Hans|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming @HQ lead asks for unblock or count, there is small chance that East hold doubleton -- so my guess @HK continue|pg||
pc|hA|nt|snorris: maybe they stumble inti it|pg||
nt|snorris: into it|pg||
nt|bg: your first question Ed is valid how does south get to bid a nf 3clubs?|pg||
nt|othered1: I might lead J if I had supported.  Otherwise, count seems best since dummy's hand isn't at all specific, is it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not -- could be just as hard to read declarer's heart length|pg||
pc|h9|nt|wilkinsona: wests x here seems an improvement on the 3 clubs in OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tada|pg||
nt|fabsayc: something wrong with this auction|pg||
nt|idblu: not really,  minimum w/long @S wants to play game|pg||
nt|josj: well, there we are|pg||
nt|roswolf: this can make i think|pg||
nt|b_eymen: cogu expert dbl la baslard√Ω|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: Yes - EW will be duly rewarded for their bidding|pg||
nt|snorris: getting some imps back|pg||
nt|snorris: 13 in fact|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S unblocks and N shifts to @D - still make?|pg||
nt|panja: operator, could you pl clarify the meanings of bids?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Can S have better cards? rise to 7|pg||
nt|snorris: easier if south opens 3 @d|pg||
nt|snorris: then it should be easy|pg||
nt|snorris: well done|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would pass with slight misgivings|pg||
nt|idblu: are they playing 2/1 or somehing else|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but looks like lack of intermediate spots will be the doom of declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: south has pointed suit pressure on east, but can't get the count right for a squeeze|pg||
nt|wygbe1: he went for the guess with the biggest payoff|pg||
nt|jaapfr: impressive gambling:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: educated quess |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|cindy: it kinda describes your hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all's well that ends well|pg||
nt|mariner1: different routes however both rooms in 4@H here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: kinda|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree snorri. The only thing to find 7 is for N to check aces|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|werge: Because of the @S-bid, Souths hand was growing|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: every chance of beating -4 however|pg||
nt|idblu: other room did not do well either|pg||
nt|shevek: mainly because partner will construct hands with the ace somewhere else|pg||
nt|chessmaste: That looks like a fatal play - now declarer has a second spade trick |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cindy: two suits  @s and @d  hmm|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am with Marshall here, prefer the slowing of 2@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as you say, matter of style. xom would rather emphasize major with 100 honors than a very broken minor. both approahes will have their successes|pg||
nt|snorris: but still lucky|pg||
nt|snorris: not loosing 3 @c tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: norths raise bold all the same|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..may have a tough decision yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club K seems like a better shot than small|pg||
nt|shevek: yet another flat board, just what Oz needs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so -- length showing probably IS best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep Ed - i'm convinced|pg||
pc|d4|nt|snorris: 9 tricks on top|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks without @s|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - miscounted :(|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and NOT @sJ?|pg||
nt|snorris: king for count?|pg||
nt|snorris: ace for unblock|pg||
nt|snorris: ?|pg||
nt|snorris: -2 at least|pg||
nt|b_eymen: gelene nt demek i√ßin|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: If S had bid 2@s W must bid 2nt  not D as partner then will go to 2@h|pg||
nt|irwinbo: spades plays better he will go down at least two|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: on the heart switch care needed I suppose|pg||
nt|idblu: @H now and a duck is a 2 undertrick  diff |pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like China going minus at both tables -- nice way for Japan to get off the schneid|pg||
nt|athene: ok - so N-S do indeed play upside down carding|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: hearts is declarer's second suit. W will let declarer look after them|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lets see, s has to lead a @c up for his 8th trick, I think that deprives him of a late @d entry.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder why Wang played A?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: did he lead 7?|pg||
nt|mpny: Paul need to play a D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: needs a @d switch|pg||
nt|idblu: has to hook|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cindy: he can now|pg||
nt|mpny: well done|pg||
nt|shevek: real score again is 64 - 29|pg||
nt|ahollan1: overtake with @CK might have been interesting -- but south must always fall back upon @D finesse |pg||
nt|roswolf: with @D 3-3 japan have scored a real goal|pg||
nt|MolvaM: evet. deklaran yeri g√∂rd√º√∞√ºnde "iyiki alttan alm√Ω√æ√Ωm" demi√ætir|pg||
nt|b_eymen: :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: East holds @C and West squeezed down to winners|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ralfwil: So I mean that 2@s is a better bid than 2@h|pg||
nt|santyclz: Low @c opening lead would have been fun.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|idblu: but can get 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|idblu: better declarer play :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They found 4@S on 6 in OR|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sounds like a close your eyes and hope for the best - but with @C sa s trump a bit difficult to investigat scientifically|pg||
nt|wygbe1: he knew south would not be able to cooperate if slam were making|pg||
pc|s4|nt|snorris: but that is good if he takes 5 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: west might cash @SA now|pg||
nt|athene: south can't really have the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: but would north play a third heart with the singleton @SK, revealing the position?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chessmaste: 12 goals you will find|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 18 puan ama i√æe yaram√Ωyor|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wilkinsona: in OR EW could have passed out 2 spades xx|pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1: rectifying the count for a squeeze that isn't there|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: just drifting one off it seems|pg||
nt|snorris: east will continue sp and hope for no q of @h in south|pg||
nt|snorris: ah... 7 of @c |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes could well do|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|idblu: ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope -- declarer going for the quick loss|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: ???|pg||
nt|snorris: natural |pg||
nt|idblu: not only that...it would beat the contract|pg||
pc|c3|nt|wilkinsona: so boldness pays|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|idblu: ?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: good evening cindy, spectators|pg||
pc|c5|nt|snorris: that would be carnage..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: which may have been 1600 approx|pg||
nt|thommos: the A@S was a good play by West, ensures they take their tricks|pg||
nt|chessmaste: As a general rule aces should be used for bashing kings|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharkey: 13 IMPs to the Chinese Ladies - Match tied|pg||
