nt|janm: Lauria having both remaining diamonds|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW have a shot at 4 @S here, can they, should they, get there?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mariner1: Q@H not likely to be found I think, so 4 is off,,,|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: It's very pushy to bid game I think. I'd open the West hand a weak NT and I don't think I'd invite with East, even though I have a good way to do so|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mariner1: @S out also hurts its chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, this is the best start|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|janm: Gower, however, thinks the East hand is worth and invite|pg||
nt|dburn: 2NT may have been artificial, but...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: Gower probably decided that 9 tricks would be easier than 10. |pg||
nt|dburn: ...it may not|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: 3N is an interesting spot.......|pg||
nt|dburn: and 3NT is flat out on the heart guesss|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mariner1: well if they set up the @c trick the @H is not needed|pg||
nt|janm: If they now shift to diamonds, that guess won't be hard - South will have showed up with AK of clubs and KJ of diamonds, can't really have the heart Q as well|pg||
nt|mariner1: so what will defense do here...... and 4@S was bid and made in Closed............|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|janm: Probably N would have carded the same way with 4 clubs, so the club continuation looked right|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|dburn: tough game, this bridge - bid game every time you have 23 points or so, and dare them to beat you|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||

nt|janm: This looks more reasonable :)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you can see how it happened|pg||
nt|dburn: East could bid a quiet 2@h here, or a noisy 3@d|pg||
nt|janm: The East hand looks as if it ought to make a game opposite a strong NT, doesn't it?|pg||
mb|3S|an|5!h 4!s|nt|janm: This isn't the real auction of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: or a Smolenesque 3@s|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: 3@S is smolen showing 4@S and 5@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: Interesting - is that supposed to show 4 spades and 5 hearts, as it probably would if West had bid 2@d?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has little chance yet no DBL|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|janm: So they avoid the Moysian with the 5-1 split - can Apteker come to 9 tricks?|pg||

nt|mariner1: not that they should have hit it|pg||
nt|janm: Who's supposed to DBL?|pg||
nt|me argent: finally un peu de pain pour hanlon|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, 3NT is a pretty good spot on the East-West cards|pg||

mc|7|nt|dburn: after all, if clubs were breaking, we would be admiring the East-West sequence in this room|pg||
nt|mariner1: very true|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 5 IMPs to McGann in any case|pg||

mb|1C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|mariner1: in both matchs the short scores are starting off right,,,,,,, 32 - 3 in other match is 32 -|pg||

mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|me argent: ive heard that australia is underpoulated|pg||
nt|dburn: that was a really unlucky baord for McGann - if there were any justice, they'd have picked up 12 IMPs, not a measly 5|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has a shot here though off in Closed|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
nt|janm: I guess the bad heart break will beat this? Club and a club taps declarer and he has to lose a spade to set up his 10th trick, so then he's out of trumps for the third club|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|janm: Spade finesse and pitch on the third club? Then dummy's trump will handle a 4th one, except it won't because it isn't high enough|pg||
nt|janm: Or South can just return a trump and declarer can't get to dummy to take the second spade finesse. I think this is hopeless|pg||
nt|janm: Versace, of course, can't see all the cards and is thinking about how to beat it if declarer has the Spade Queen|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: i think i missed a trick|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|vugrapha1: i assumed versace won the @s but it seems he must have ducked|pg||
nt|dburn: I was about to say that this was another unlucky board for McGann|pg||
nt|janm: Eventually someone will win a spade and play the third club and almost whatever happens declarer will get 2 more hearts, the spade A and the diamond K for -1|pg||
nt|dburn: but it may not be so|pg||
nt|janm: That's true - if the hearts had just been 3-2 4@h would have been comfortable|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but it can (and should) make from here...|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|vugrapha1: not 100% sure position is as shown|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: but i think it may be|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|janm: Maybe declarer's best chance here is to hopw that North has all the remaining clubs, so he can pull trump and end-play S with a spade. That won't work here, and if it would I think ...|pg||
nt|janm: Versace would have won an earlier spade|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: I see now - Versace was end-played when he ruffed the 4th spade. If he hadn't ruffed, of course, that would have been declarer's 10th trick. He had to win the K of spades earlier, ...|pg||
nt|janm: so that declarer wouldn't be in dummy to take a second spade finesse|pg||

nt|viren169: I prefer declarer to exit a club each time...|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|viren169: and say a little prayer and hope good things happen!|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@S and @s S ducked and he misguessed|pg||
nt|cicus: he lost 2 trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: same may happen here too|pg||
nt|athene: one possibility was to lead a diamond to the @D10 and hope to build a diamond trick eventually|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: win heart ten trick one and finesse the spade|pg||
nt|viren169: never give up... sometimes opps will present a trick or two!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: south has hope clubs behave|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|xenya: now?|pg||
nt|pelu: decl play N for K 6 stiff in @S - |pg||
nt|pelu: N is a passed hand, so he sh do right|pg||
nt|xenya: well N didn't open, so perhaps there is a clue -- not clear however|pg||
nt|cicus: doesn't know about @HQ|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer can't be sure how @H honours are distributed|pg||
nt|pelu: but Ns overcall indicate @H-values :)|pg||
nt|cicus: I'd misguess if that is saying something|pg||
nt|hedyg: a good chance that N has doubleton @S|pg||
nt|xenya: can't N have Axxxx in @Hs and Kx in @S?|pg||
nt|cicus: however, I am warned that 2@H is probably not bid with only the empty ace|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d5|nt|xenya: he could overcall on that NV i think|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|janm: This was an interesting hand on play and defense in the other room in 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: earlier we saw 1st @H led to the A here.... later found K and J @H on same play|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so are Balickin and Zmudzinski in the other room now?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Balicki|pg||
nt|janm: Apteker & Gower seem to be having a pretty standard auction here, also, to a comfortable-looking contract. Even with the bad trump break, 2@h is likely to come home|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|janm: The defense of breaking diamonds didn't work well in the other room, although it's not clear that anything else would work better|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: yeah this looks like a quiet part score|pg||
pc|dA|nt|janm: 2NT presumably suggested that North had either long diamonds or long clubs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugrapha1: same as the other room so far|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|janm: That Jx of diamonds is just irresistable, I guess|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: except gower won in dummy|pg||
pc|s7|nt|janm: That's a somewhat surprising shift, that will allow Apteker to pick up the diamonds, if he decides it's really from Jx|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|janm: But declarer here didn't trust the diamond J, so won't pick them up. |pg||
pc|h5|nt|janm: Guess he didn't have to decide. Now he just needs to get trumps taken care of|pg||
nt|mariner1: well if you were hunting J@H would you lead 2 here?|pg||
nt|janm: Is he wondering why Versace played the diamonds? Maybe will end up deciding to play "safe" by not taking the heart finesse?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|janm: Can he recover from misguessing both red suits? I don't think so|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|janm: Now a heart to the ?? what do we think?|pg||
nt|mariner1: so he wasn't hunting K or J @H 1st time it seems|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|janm: The longer Versace thinks, the more the heart K is marked with him, but|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|janm: When he wins it I guess we know about the K|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: well now he has found K and J both|pg||

nt|ady: double cost 3 imps|pg||
nt|mmmakela: fireworks expected|pg||
nt|athene: ah no|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: sry little break. we're back|pg||
nt|viren169: great...|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H for E-W|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: its 20boards|pg||
nt|athene: N-S might bid 4@S over that|pg||
mb|1D|nt|viren169: great hand here...|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H or 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S looks like 500 on diamond lead, ruff, heart back, another diamond ruffed with @SJ|pg||
nt|athene: 6nt for N-S now|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|cicus: with 5 weak hearts and 4 clubs they overcall 1NT  I think|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S will fail... due to lack of pts|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4 loser hand.  2@c by many.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: 5@C a make       5@H  a good sac  down 1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and 4@H may be down on say a trump lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|santyclz: Doesn't 6@c make?|pg||
nt|viren169: I think E/S will take the push to the 5 level|pg||
nt|athene: south will definitely sac now|pg||
nt|athene: you knock out the @DA then you have 3-3 in either minor or various squeezes|pg||
mb|2N|an|lebensohl|nt|hedyg: 1NT or 2@c?|pg||
nt|ady: will it go higher than the 5 level?|pg||
nt|athene: E-W aren't playing a strong club are they?|pg||
nt|viren169: was 2@H F or NF?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cicus: not sure this pair plays that, though|pg||
nt|athene: best is for the defence to hold up the @DA|pg||
nt|athene: then you have to commit yourself|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east's 1@C is a bit strange|pg||
nt|viren169: interesting choice!|pg||
nt|athene: always 1@D with that shape|pg||
nt|vugraphzkc: yes...|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: west just might go right here.  East's 4@C bid shows decent length, I'd assume|pg||
nt|ady: 1 diamond and 1 spade loser in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk5: N-S never bid in the other room|pg||
nt|othered1: a cautious 5@C, perhaps fearing 4@S would be 5=5 black?|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: wow!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: @d lead wont be good|pg||
nt|pelu: better bid 2@H in 1. round - in moders bridge u need to take space from opp|pg||
nt|hedyg: was waiting for opps to play in @s or rebid @d|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unless you pitch a @s on the @ds.|pg||
nt|athene: you don't open 1@C with 55 in the minors, just so you can reverse :)|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead will make things easy|pg||
nt|athene: you look at the @D9 and claim 12 :)|pg||
nt|athene: west might reason as follows:- 1) declarer has spades |pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: and then he went from dreaming to the real world :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2) dummy has hearts|pg||
nt|athene: 3) partner didn't double 3@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: You called it.|pg||
nt|athene: 4) i'll lead a diamond!|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: i see it is usual to open 1@d with 4-4 minors in Hungary|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: suicide is not painless|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: south has no excuse for 5 over 5|pg||
nt|viren169: you dont open 5-5 in the minors even if you have a reverse!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: where is Roland?|pg||
nt|pelu: is that normal, Gabor?|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, that is standard|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ady: was south worried about 6 clubs   otherwise should surely go to 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk5: For a start I think South has an opener|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|pelu: even with a bad @D and good @C - no lead-directing?|pg||
nt|viren169: this could be a telephone number!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: as you see here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No South opened|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|othered1: Open room looks like confusion over rebids after a reverse|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: hardest for declarer would be a major-suit lead, and the @DQ then @D to the @DK both ducked|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: now someone might have @DA8 left with clubs 3-3 all along|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|cicus: there might be declinations, but the rule is 1@D for 44|pg||
nt|pelu: I only open 1@D on that hand to keep opp out of @D-attack (bluff) :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|hedyg: in 3rd seat might open 1@c with this hand for the lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: No, can't manage with 3-0 @cs, sry.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: east blew the entry for the second diamond ruff|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer a tump lead than the singleton.|pg||
nt|viren169: ...trump...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cicus: I myself often open 1@C when that suit is much strobger|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: 1@d in Switzerland and France too|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think Italy as well|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: i am told Brazil too|pg||
nt|viren169: only 2@H reached at the other table!|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|d4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|s9|pc|h9|pg||
nt|pelu: so in X-Y-NT after 1@D and 2@D (GF) 2ut = 4-4 i minor?|pg||
nt|athene: but he couldn't be anything like sure enough of it to bid 5@S, i don't think|pg||
