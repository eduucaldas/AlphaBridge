nt|copeyj: E/W Norweigan style - 15-17 NT, 3 weak 2s, 5 card @S opener, 4 card @H opener|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2/1 gf|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|copeyj: hi Bill|pg||
nt|copeyj: The England team this w/e is Erichsen-Selway, Gold-Townsend and Brunner-Holland|pg||
nt|copeyj: The EBU team is Allfrey-Robson, Garvey-Cooke, Bowles-Howard|pg||
nt|copeyj: EBU, for those who dont know, is English Bridge Union|pg||
nt|athene: Garvey-Cooke, E-W in the other room, play an unusual system, so there might not be too many flat boards|pg||
nt|copeyj: to avoid the sit out which used to happen, the organisers decided that the team hosting the final of the two camrose weekends got to have two teams, and the EBU team is the result ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: of that|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|copeyj: i think Robson and Allfrey play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|copeyj: so 1@H shows 4+@S|pg||
mb|p!|nt|athene: prepared 1@C (might be as short as 2 in a balanced hand) with transfer responses is fast becoming the norm these days|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|athene: some play that completing the transfer (1@S by north here) shows any weak NT; some play it promises 3-card support|pg||
nt|copeyj: in my opinion far superior to have it as any weak NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: but not sure which Allfrey-Robson do|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: declarer can get the clubs going for a diamond discard, i guess|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|copeyj: Peter Crouch tells me 1@S showed 3 for Allfrey-Robson|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@D multi|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@D must be a trash multi|pg||
nt|copeyj: shows how hyper aggressive they can be at right colours/seat|pg||
nt|athene: yes, many play that 2@D = bad weak-2, and 2major is a fine, upstanding, "Terence Reese would open it" weak-2|pg||
mb|2N|mb|d|mb|3D!|nt|athene: 2nt might be vaguely tactical; west knows his opponents might well have game in the major his partner doesn't have|pg||
nt|copeyj: N/S can make 5@D with a successful spade guess|pg||
nt|henryb: or 5@s for that matter|pg||
nt|athene: they are more likely to alight in spades|pg||
nt|athene: robson might do something clever like 3@H now|pg||
nt|athene: assuming 3@D showed hearts|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: 3@H typically will be 4 spades and longer minor|pg||

nt|Walddk3: After the first weekend in January in Wales the standing is: 1. EBU 86 VPs - 2. Wales 83 - 3. England 79 - 4. Ireland 74 - 5. Northern Ireland 70 - 6. Scotland 52|pg||
nt|athene: these "choice of games" cue-bids are very useful|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg: Spears and Murdoch are both experienced players but a relatively new partnership|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we can see that S made a correct evaluation of the slam potential of the S hand even facing a weak NT on that deal by observing that if the 2 black queens in the N hand were ...|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: was the @HA lead impossible to find? 3@H must be spades and diamonds....so south might very well have a stiff heart|pg||
nt|copeyj: great board for Erichsen-Selway to get in there early - builds their confidence and knocks the opposition|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2@S mixed raise|pg||
nt|copeyj: 7-9ish 4 trumps i spose|pg||
nt|copeyj: common usage|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H obvious now|pg||
nt|henryb: more to the point, why was North not discarding @s. If partner has 4 then declarer has only two, and at trick 4 the whole hand was counted|pg||
nt|athene: but 2@S is quite a low-level bid so might have more meanings|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|henryb: West has eight clubs, two spades, no diamonds and therefore three hearts.|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C presumably a splinter, which won't make north's eyes light up|pg||

nt|henryb: So Robson will now play a @s to the K, a @h to the A and the @sA to pitch dummy's @d. then another @h|pg||
