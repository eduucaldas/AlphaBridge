nt|ahollan1: for convention cards of players - check out:  http://tinyurl.com/Japan-Open-2007  and http://tinyurl.com/Chinese-Women-2008|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Had anyone of you opened on N?|pg||
nt|werge: Yoy have problems in 3 NT - East is somehow endplayed...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so the Hacket team came back to win from 40-0 down|pg||
nt|xenya: Hello Martin|pg||
nt|athene: but i think even with 13 imps to make up, bidding game wld be aggressive|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H will be a 3-card limit raise, i guess|pg||
nt|shevek: fit showing jump maybe?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a strong Australian team  Klinger and Delmonte are very well known|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I dont know the other 2  but surely well known also|pg||
nt|sharkey: Would anyone open the East hand 1@C?|pg||
nt|athene: east has the sort of hand that can be very aggressive facing 4-card spade support but less so facing only 3|pg||
nt|athene: weak trumps and possibility of getting forced in hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: clubs are where my points are, yes i would|pg||
nt|shevek: absolutely an opening hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but EW weren't part of the team in 2008, so we'll have to guess what they're doing|pg||
