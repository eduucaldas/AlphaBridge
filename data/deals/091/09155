nt|bbramley: east has a sound weak two, but he has 7 inevitable losers|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Your commentators are Bart Bramley, Martin Johnson and Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good evening|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bbramley: 1NT = 11-13 balanced, approximately what he has|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|kit: hard for me to believe that 1NT is right rebid, particularly when 1@D didn't show diamonds to begin with|pg||
nt|bbramley: this should be down 1|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|henryb: sound by modern standards; when I learned this suit was inadequate|pg||

nt|kit: defense had to get 2 rounds of trumps in -- not obvious at all|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: still has an uppercut possibility|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bbramley: very close to making now, but should still be down 1 - @D promotion will create another trump trick for N/S|pg||

nt|henryb: I do not disagree, but my teachers would have much preferred the @dQ to the @hK|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|an|2+|nt|jtr: Then the Chinese gained 50 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: welcome back everyone|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jtr: Start with a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north has a huge hand for a Precision 1@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Tough to bid though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: They have put together some massive sets over the years - I remember a 76-0 demolition in one of the Venice Cup matches|pg||
nt|athene: south will be thinking of 6@H now|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: so is North, by the look of it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: hi Peter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@H may well be doubled for a spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the normal way to show a void in response to RKCB was to bid 5NT with an even number of keycards|pg||
nt|jtr: Not so tough for these ladies it seems|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Strong Club|pg||
nt|petergill: hence 3@H, since 1@H was 11-15|pg||
nt|athene: i thought 6@D would show a diamond void and an ODD number of keycards|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: which will not, unfortunately, do any good |pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: well, i am sure they know what they are doing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I'd have doubled for a spade lead, and would be -1210|pg||
nt|athene: even without a spade fit, north has the most she can possibly have for 1@H, so as soon as her partner shows any slam interest, she is going there|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid, 4NT RKCB, 6@D two key cards plus @D void. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: the @CQ is a bonus|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: 6@d = @d void with 2 or 3 keycards.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: thirteen tricks now if she wants them|pg||
nt|jtr: 2 OR 3 seems odd|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that seems a bit silly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doesn't seem a bit silly - seems totally unplayable|pg||
nt|athene: you might easily be missing a grand slam with south showing 2 or 3 keycards|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: i think so too, but that's what explained.|pg||
nt|petergill: Without @CQ in her side suit (source of tricks), South would not have encouraged a slam - she would have bid 4@h instead of 4@D. |pg||
nt|athene: if you are ever going to have ambiguous responses they have to be widely differentiated so partner knows what you have|pg||
nt|athene: hence 0 or 3 keycards, 1 or 4|pg||
nt|jtr: Sensible lead in a way|pg||
nt|jtr: East knows South is likely to have only 2 or 3 trumps and the ruff may be important|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if there was any significance in west's failure to double diamond bids|pg||
nt|athene: forcing dummy might well be right to prevent the establishment of a black suit|pg||
nt|jtr: South responded 2@c next door and they were much better placed|pg||
nt|athene: i try to persuade my partners not to lead trumps against small slams|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: the only excuse for so doing is it's right :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: Both teams of six not surprisingly have their top four players in action for this vital last 16 boards of the grand final|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jtr: Concerned about 4-1 @cs|pg||
nt|jtr: and 3-1@hs|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|jtr: yes i thought she might do that|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jtr: Leaves options open and may be important for a squeeze|pg||
nt|petergill: "Fluffy" on BBO forums has a good problem in the top-listed Forum thread about whether to lead a trump against a slam of not, ref www.bridgebase.com then forums. Fluffy (in the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Latin team) missed the Finals by 1 imp in the NEC Cup.     |pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: she isn't sure whether to go for two diamond ruffs, or establish spades, or draw trumps and play for black-suit squeeze|pg||

mb|p|nt|bbramley: the score we see should be correct - we've watched the results at both tables |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i asked how they break ties if everybody wins one match, does anybody know for sure?|pg||
nt|bbramley: now we are back to the marginal slam, bid and made by meckwell|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|bbramley: a marginal 6@H here - might make without a club lead, or with inspired guessing|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: this could be a swing board, a marginal slam|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|an|art, asking|mb|d|nt|bbramley: rod can't jumpshift to 2@H - that would be artificial showing a weak hand with 5@Ss and 4@Hs|pg||
nt|henryb: If E led a trump it would probably make :)|pg||
mb|2N|an|max, 2 hearts|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|bbramley: 2@C is clearly some sort of checkback - north has slam interest, else he would have just signed off in 4@H over 1NT|pg||
nt|henryb: I think they will die in 4@h|pg||
nt|bbramley: if south shows @C control north will get excited|pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends, is meck hand worth a cue now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Looks like North will pretty much have to bid slam on his own -- he won't get much help from his partner|pg||
nt|bbramley: in equiv position earlier south cuebid 4@C here|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|bbramley: north may punt with 4@D = Last Train, leaving the decision to south|pg||
nt|bbramley: or north may just take over and blast the slam|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bbramley: west missed his chance to double 4@C - that could be fatal|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west did not double 4@C, so lead not easy |pg||

pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: bart is a faster typer|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|athene: the ultra-light response might talk N-S out of game here|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: to be fair, after (say) 1N-p-p-2@S, it's not clear that South would go on |pg||

nt|vugrapha2: sorry we skipped a board|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bbramley: a close slam here - on a @C lead declarer has to guess very well - on other leads not quite as well|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|nt|bbramley: yes - east would show out|pg||
nt|bbramley: meck starts low with a complex hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C?|pg||
nt|bbramley: rod's 4@S includes many hand types opposite the limited opening|pg||
nt|bbramley: but here rod has a classic|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or maybe try to just buy the hand|pg||
nt|henryb: Chokshi must think they are playing with a pinochle deck|pg||
mb|5C|nt|fabsayc: we are in another universe on this auction|pg||
nt|kit: difference in tactics -- in other room, North bid 4@S over the double|pg||
mb|5S|mb|d|nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Kit Woolsey|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: hi kit!|pg||
nt|henryb: 4@s was not a bid Jeff expected|pg||
nt|kit: hi all|pg||
nt|bbramley: i'm amazed at how often my partner seems to raise my very long suit|pg||
nt|kit: I think East should have just belted out 6@C and let N-S guess|pg||
nt|bbramley: looking only at E/W cards it's very unlikely that 5@S is making|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed|pg||
nt|kit: it turns out that 6@C is down, but N-S can't know that -- likely South would have bid 6@S|pg||
nt|bbramley: and may still if east pulls now|pg||
nt|kit: Less likely -- East wasn't willing to bid it directly on an auction which was likely to die at 5@C from his point of view|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he does not need much to make 6@C|pg||
mb|6C|mb|6S|nt|kit: and now South has already shown huge playing strength, so he can pass the final decision to his partner|pg||
nt|bbramley: did north really pass over the double?|pg||
mb|d|nt|bbramley: but how likely was 5@C to end the auction - east is looking at a stiff spade, so opponents may have 11 of them|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|bbramley: south hadn't shown 7-5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: canadian slowball tactic|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|kit: I think very likely -- North could have anything for 4@S call, so South will ususally shut up|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bbramley: the slower auction means that this will probably be the final contract - east can feel that he's described his hand adequately|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult for West to believe he has to take a save vs. 5@S the way the auction went|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|kit: I think South has shown some pretty incredible distribution with the 5@S call playing a strong club|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bbramley: but not this much - he'd bid 5@S with any 6-5 hand and most hands with 7 spades|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bbramley: can't quite claim yet|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|kit: Still, he is bidding for a likely minus score on an auction where the opponents didn't bid slam voluntarily|pg||
nt|bbramley: besides - N/S have no assurance of beating 6@C - just looking at THEIR cards 6@C looks like a favorite - spades might be 2-0 for example|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|kit: true, but on the enemy bidding 6@C is less likely to mke|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|s2|pc|h2|pg||
nt|me argent: at end of this hand usa tied in both matches|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|s4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|me argent: no way that south hand sells|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: ref page 22 of http://www.worldbridge.org/publications/WBNews/WBFNews09.pdf |pg||
mb|5S|nt|athene: west had a choice of cue-bids here to show diamond support - 2@H or 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: some people would always cue in the suit they hold strength|pg||
nt|athene: (so @SA means 2@S)|pg||
nt|athene: but another consideration is that you want to make the cue which can't be natural|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. west can't have a great hand with spades (no 1@S overcall)|pg||
nt|athene: but she MIGHT have a great hand with hearts|pg||
nt|athene: probably showing hearts naturally isn't an issue so much over a 5-card major|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|nt|kit: it is pretty difficult to freeze the ball on a hand like that -- many IMPs will be at stake whatever you do|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kit: let's see if N-S can overcome this psych|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bbramley: more slam potential here - N/S are solid except for 2 @H losers, but E/W better get them right away to stop 6@S|pg||
