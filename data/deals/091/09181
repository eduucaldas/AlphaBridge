nt|marlowepi: slam is a reasonable gamble. 5S is the safe bid of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: personally i think the game would be greatly improved if bidding and making 5M paid more than 4M with an overtrick|pg||
nt|snorris: very strange, n opened 1 @d!!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...so a happy start for NS|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S for NW here...|pg||
nt|panja: NS even|pg||
nt|snorris: there are many 11 counts here Werge any opening bids?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 imps |pg||
nt|sybarra: website for tourney |pg||
nt|werge: One more 7 NT...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well Im not sure about that..... but we hoped for more action|pg||
nt|snorris: another weakness is the inability of not being able to inviting slam in minor|pg||
nt|idblu: a push as suggested|pg||
nt|thommos: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me a D from W is for penalty and 2nt is forcing for one round|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - not sure I understand S bidding|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the redouble looked odd to me|pg||
nt|caitlin: this is why I tell my students NOT to underlead Aces vs suit contracts:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now we need pics of the chinese ladies  anyone oblige?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well last time i held 23 and heard LHO open 1N -- we didn't find a making game :)|pg||
nt|xenya: note that 4@S would fail if played by W or if N could geta lead early -- then @C lead beats the contract|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Roland|pg||
nt|xenya: and Martin|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be trappy for n/s|pg||
mb|1D|nt|frankaus: 3@C by W or is it tooo god at these colours|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with stiff S it is important to preempt|pg||
nt|barbyh: not a bad idea|pg||
nt|snorris: 1 @s?|pg||
nt|snorris: well..|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - and bad 11´s...|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html|pg||
nt|ralfwil: it´s very difficult to find a 6-3 fit in a minor, like this|pg||
nt|yo_yo: was he going to double opps?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps it was so he could set up a force.....|pg||
nt|santyclz: Was it a strong nt?|pg||
nt|idblu: was it wk or str NT?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|wilkinsona: well +2?|pg||
nt|snorris: dont think so|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: we could call it a "small schlemiel"|pg||
nt|werge: This should be an easy bid for N|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @s|pg||
nt|othered1: Do we know NS's NT range?|pg||
nt|sharkey: but then 2@D wudnt be forcing after Dbl?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they will be happy to win 3 imps though|pg||
nt|mpny: the XX must have showed a good hand. if 3H was not forcing, I do not know how one would force|pg||
nt|josj: 4@S will be made but it might be missed here or there|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I prefer D on S before 1@s on that poor suit and I have a 3-card @h|pg||
nt|snorris: 1 @h overbid|pg||
nt|snorris: ??|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 1@s on a 7-card suit?|pg||
nt|snorris: so how many? 3 @h ?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: its forcing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ron Klinger has long been an advocate of 4 card overcalls|pg||
nt|snorris: I would|pg||
nt|idblu: that was quick and dirty|pg||
nt|werge: For me too|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: ny Japanese advisor was in wrong room, he was in Open, so our EW are not|pg||
nt|mariner1: women...........|pg||
nt|mariner1: my|pg||
nt|snorris: not in my book|pg||
nt|snorris: I bid @s|pg||
nt|werge: Nosacrifice aganist 4 Q s - looks lihe 1400|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And What´s on? Ov course 4@s on N! any objection?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not a great 6NT, but will make|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lots of tricks NS as the cards lie|pg||
nt|cindy: 4@s should be ok|pg||
nt|snorris: 6 nt is the contract to be in|pg||
nt|snorris: here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Ron's to blame for this craze is he?|pg||
nt|snorris: 1 @s might show 5|pg||
nt|mpny: no, 2D would almost certainly not be forcing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy 3nt|pg||
nt|santyclz: This hand should tell us if e-w are playing precision, w will probably rebid 3@c if so.|pg||
nt|roswolf: however the favorable heart lie is their salvation|pg||
pc|dK|nt|panja: is this voluntary 3@H likely to be interpreted as strong?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good morning Kath, Mike, Carl andMichael|pg||
nt|santyclz: Precision 2@cs.  6+@cs or 5+ and a 4 card major.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/competition/competition.php?id.39094  Results A-Final|pg||
nt|sybarra: can E squeak this one by?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looks like 4@S may make, but declarer has to make the right choices|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like forcing Stayman, or maybe not|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Martin!|pg||
nt|snorris: 5+ that is|pg||
nt|cindy: is this good enough for resp dbl ?|pg||
nt|idblu: not I vul|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i wouldn't double with brenner;s hand   wou;d you?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not me at these colors|pg||
nt|cindy: no|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but i wouldn;t hesitate either|pg||
nt|cindy: just checkin :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we just chicken too|pg||
nt|idblu: N shld be bid out|pg||
nt|cindy: checkin chickens|pg||
nt|idblu: 3@D s/b 123 stop|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East may move here though|pg||
nt|sharkey: But cannot see  @D returnhaving any purpose|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a Precision player MIGHT rebid 3@C --- but the quality of the @C suit may deter|pg||
nt|idblu: no excuse for E to bid on here|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Last 5 boards of the tournament|pg||

mc|13|nt|marlowepi: S may be worried about m,issing a slam, will soon find out he is too high in game|pg||

nt|mariner1: our|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow|pg||
nt|snorris: from bad to worse|pg||
nt|cindy: 3N not so good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and only 3@s?|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 si good but south will probably not raise|pg||
nt|idblu: Hi Bruce, Ian :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Bruce |pg||
