nt|hedyg: 2@H is a constructive raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|hedyg: better to show fit immediately, if he bids 1@s and pd rebids 2@C , 2@H might be just a preference|pg||

nt|hedyg: 3@H is not strength showing|pg||

mb|4S|nt|hedyg: i am disappointed|pg||
nt|ady: not so easy when partner has bid no-trumps twice  implying better hearts and worse outside|pg||

nt|viren169: the dreaded 4333 shape strike again!|pg||
