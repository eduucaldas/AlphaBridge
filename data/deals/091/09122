nt|lestergold: a thinish 4 spades availble here for N/S|pg||
nt|stewball: lots of chances|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard work with the r4/1 break|pg||
nt|dburn: sporting weak two bid at the other table, but North-South dealt with it easily enough|pg||
nt|drg: KQ@H doubleton helps a bit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C a fine spot although 3NT also makes on this layout|pg||
nt|jwit: I have never played bridge with Fredin, but did have the pleasure of playing golf with him.  For somebody who doesn't get out on the golf course very often, he is a terrific ...|pg||
nt|jwit: golfer.|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure seems like 4@H has play here......|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@S was a brave move by Ólafur in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: should be worth a few imps to e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c or indeed 3N on for NS|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: those heart pips in fredin's hand work quite hard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The N-S heart spots are just good enough to stop the suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps one should open 2@S instead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Like here|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially with a passed partner|pg||
mb|1S|nt|robbg: This 1@s overcall I don't understand at all! (I like the other one better!)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: however maybe 2@s would show a 2suiter in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: was 2nd best     suppose they play attitude|pg||
mb|2S|nt|daman: 3NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: North will make sure they get to 4@H (at least) now.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|jwit: This could be a nice swing for NS.  Heart to 10 now and will do quite well.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: Although he isn't crazy about his spade holding on the auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: declarer finessed for the Q@H in Closed and went off|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Oh my|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     can make 9 tricks in spades  with fortunate lie of the black soft cards|pg||
nt|thegarve: If the hand was pure - opening 2@s is not a good idea -  2@S is ideal here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What does 2NT show since Ingimundur drove all the way to game|pg||
nt|drg: may well need to guess clubs if west can hold up the ace on the first round|pg||
nt|robbg: The 1@s overcall might have that effect.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: very optimistic by east on those values|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2NT would have been down too |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It most likely would|pg||
nt|hedyg: no direct entry to dummy for any finesse|pg||
nt|ady: I cant see that is a reason for east to bid  anything|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has played before that man|pg||
nt|dburn: here, though, North has done pretty well to respond to 1NT at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: superfially only three losers but ten winners are not that obvious|pg||
nt|stewball: i dont think its 100% to bid with that N hand n/v|pg||
nt|daman: Jon would have bid 3NT     Bob Hamman as well|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers suggesting 3N|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is not unreasonable when there is at least a three-card difference in the spade length.|pg||
nt|jwit: Kendrick can't afford to duck this.  He needs to give declarer an entry to dummy.|pg||
nt|jwit: Entry to hand I meant|pg||
nt|robbg: Won't be useful unless he wins and switches, unless Schifko is partial to a 1st round finesse.|pg||
mc|9|nt|lestergold: i agree i tend to pass a 15-17 nt with a poor 8 count|pg||
nt|lestergold: trump lead best here|pg||
nt|drg: reasonable to take a call holding spades and a couple of tens|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: probably to go to the rest rooms...|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: so we have to wait for the moment|pg||

nt|bobh1: best defense beats both|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think the ten of diamonds was a better shot in that suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: i hope im not being a results merchant|pg||
nt|drg: certainly works with the K9 doubleton|pg||
nt|lestergold: Fredin needs to learn to upgrade the powerful 876 sequence!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When did you last see that, David? Pulling from 3NT (undoubled) to 4@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi David u up early for a Sunday|pg||
nt|jwit: EW got awfully high on this one in the closed room|pg||
mb|1C|nt|brolucius: Declarer can pick up the clubs without a ruff.|pg||
nt|ady: 4S  for n/s|pg||
nt|drg: since west cannot afford to cover|pg||
nt|dburn: somewhat vexing for West at the other table to discover that leading from KQ in his partner's weak two bid allowed the contract to make|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: multi 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: only a part score hand    but the other room did not think so|pg||
nt|thegarve: the weak two classically pushed the opens to stretch , first with 2NT then 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s or 1@c?|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, but EW have a good save at 5 diamonds even with the bad trump break|pg||
nt|mariner1: tartan showing 5M and 4+ minor less than opening count|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thats one ofthe penalties of bidding with garbage|pg||
nt|stewball: sometimes called suicide 2 bids|pg||
nt|lestergold: the trump attack here was excellent|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that the heart game was made at every table but 1.|pg||
nt|jwit: I would pass over 1NT with the West hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bobh1: it is a style issue|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed it is|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D  a save for e/w|pg||
nt|brolucius: But he does not know that, so if the defenders cash their hearts (which they will) he may begin with two rounds of trumps followed by two rounds of clubs.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Muiderberg is very similar to Tartan|pg||
nt|mariner1: 17opposite a weak 8 here.....|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: without itmost linbes would have suceeded|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: http://icelandairopen.com/index.php?m=D3&id=M_OPENTEAMS2009&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2009  for leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D Multi, weak with one major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the garbage type|pg||
nt|bobh1: N has something in reserve for his 2@s bid|pg||
nt|dburn: didn't really see the auction - maybe it was supposed to be forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You saw the constructive weak 2 before|pg||
nt|drg: not much hope except for divining the spade position|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I would too,,,, looks more like 6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobholl: 1@S and all pass|pg||
nt|jwit: Rather aggressive 4D bid by South|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has nothing in reserve for his 4@D bid.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bridge_one: i don't agree the pass by south with 12 hcp and good figures|pg||
nt|robbg: A kibitzer asks why the duck at trick 1... It is often good technique to foil what declarer is trying to do. Here Schifko, basically known to hold Qx in @s was trying to force an ...|pg||
nt|robbg: entry to his hand, so Kendrick naturally (and unfortunately) refused to accomodate.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: nice swing for n/s here|pg||
nt|bobh1: can N stnd it?|pg||
nt|hedyg: not at all interested in A@D in pds hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has denied a heart control, on the face of it, so North should not advance.|pg||
nt|hedyg: and no 4@H bid|pg||
nt|jwit: If 4D was a stiff rather than a void, North has a powerhouse of a hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: i thing maybe he should have bid 2n or something to show a 3-card limit raise to begin with|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|brgpro: send my greetings to him|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: lol|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult when playing precision like with 13-15 NT|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would open the south hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: without an  impossible double dummy spade view this looks unmanageable|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: now too high     |pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@C should show a @H stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The double of 4@D must encourage a sacrifice because he will be on lead himself|pg||
nt|bobh1: altho 4 by 3 his hand is prime|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to blame North, though, with that massive hand (for a single raise) opposite a slam try. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 4@D overbid caused this|pg||
nt|bobh1: i blame him for making only a single raise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't|pg||
nt|ady: I think 4@D  looking for a slam optimistic  opposite a 2@S raise|pg||
nt|jwit: I agree David, especially if 4D was a singleton.  Obviously, not nearly as good opposite a void|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@C?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I blame 4@D, that is a wild overbid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes|pg||
nt|jwit: Agree totally Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The auction is in MOVIE|pg||
nt|robbg: This contract at least has a bit of play, but not on today's distribution.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mariner1: however they might hooks @S to make it........|pg||
nt|drg: can get 8 tricks for a push though|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: E had a chance to switch to @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: Fredin reasoning that S must have trumps and he has 3 tricks in hand|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: a hard work contract here|pg||
nt|dburn: I imagine it was intended as forcing, but it was a rather odd thing to do|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, an excellent double.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brgpro: but they play 12-15NT, so he will have to open 1NT and he is lack of controls|pg||
nt|bridge_one: QJ9  Q9xx A10x QJ10   medium cards  in all suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can make such doubles only when the auction makes it clear that the other side have limited values. If West had rebid 4@S, you might be more circumspect.|pg||
nt|jwit: Best defense might beat this 3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: An awful sequence.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jwit: Good point David|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s6|pc|c5|nt|hedyg: so did W.........|pg||
nt|hedyg: did he really duck the Q@H?|pg||
nt|jwit: From North's point of view, partner could easily have something like  AKJxxx  Ax x KQJx.  Surely that wouldn't be asking for too much for a 4D bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: much too much work to do with the hearts being established next time opps are in|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably get home by way of 4hearts two dims 2 clubs and a ruff in the short heart hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: however 2s was due for a few off|pg||
nt|daman: yes    should reel this one in|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|drg: actually, a club up now and then diamonds|pg||
nt|drg: the minors lay very friendly|pg||
nt|dburn: this is cold, isn't it?|pg||
nt|drg: south can't afford to rise because of the Qx@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: another @S pressures S|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: this looks like a lucky position indeed|pg||
nt|drg: not cold anymore|pg||
nt|dburn: that may not have been best, though|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he finds it |pg||
nt|lestergold: but not much else to try|pg||
nt|drg: it was his only legit shot|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: How you can envisage slam with that hand opposite a single raise is simply unbelievable|pg||

nt|pbundy: welcome flash|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gracelin: if NS reach 6S, they will probably make it with the lucky lie of cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting 2@H by N in the other room over double. Anyone know what that means?|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: my notes don't say anything about Ron's 4@D bid|pg||
mb|3C|nt|by: 1@s denied 4+@h, so N knew that EW has 10+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, same here|pg||
nt|by: 2@h in the other room means 3+@s, good hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade raise, can be unlimited|pg||
nt|beauch: Klingers 4d would likely be lead- directing- looks a little physic|pg||
nt|flash: looks familiar...|pg||
nt|pbundy: i wonder how many would upgrade the west hand with those tens? |pg||
mb|p|nt|kyosuke326: 2@H = Forcing @S I think|pg||
nt|wygbe1: looks normal to reach 4s, probably down - |pg||
nt|xenya: then declarer can draw just 2 rounds of trumps, retaining @C control, and work on @Hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but seems if you play transfer advances, you might want to show diamonds first|pg||
nt|by: i don't quite agree with 2@h here since partner does not promise 5@h, 2@c transfer to 2@d is better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: troublesome auction for South -- has he shown 1-suiter or tolerance for one of he pointed suits?|pg||
nt|allanr44: Well, there are 12 with the favourable Ds|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Nystrom reads 5@C it correctly - for this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: as east i might have ventured 5@h -- that would be unfortunate on this hand.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you don't need to :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi barbara|pg||
nt|sybarra: can blame N bidding 4 |pg||
nt|pbundy: on a good day, you'd make 4@H.  this is not, however, a good day.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|dinos1: lose 2 aces and 2 trumps|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: How difficult is it to recruit new youngsters in Taiwan? It's a big problem in most places elsewhere|pg||

nt|allanr44: in NT|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mildredb: pesty singleton @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: 1@c - 1@h forced to game|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes.  but - possible that even without it, the 9 of hearts could come into play with a 4-1 break|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: cards are friendly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thoughtful @HK from Klinger -- IF partner held the !AH, then Ron retains lead in case shift is needed|pg||
nt|beauch: hi Barbara|pg||
nt|barbyh: hi beauch|pg||
nt|wygbe1: n did well to merely invite, unfortunately south liked his club fit and didnt know his heart cards were worthless|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: duck here gives Bertheau guess on next round of trump|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mildredb: unlikely as most likely @H will be led from declarer's hand|pg||
nt|flash: since declarer is about to be in his own hand, seems reasonable to start trumps by leading small toward dummy?|pg||
nt|xenya: N may have regretted overcalling, but shouldn't he pass like a man? |pg||
nt|allanr44: yes |pg||
nt|xenya: frankly, i don't know|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wygbe1: oh the auction was already gf?|pg||

nt|bobh1: he has to . . . otherwise cue-bidding serves no purpose|pg||
nt|jwit: I don't blame North for bidding over 4S.  There are just too many hands partner could have for a 4D bid, that slam will be cold|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if he can bid 4@D with that hand, he might also bypass a heart cue next because he overbid|pg||
nt|brolucius: The correct way to play the clubs is king and then the ace, exposing the need for a finesse when West has a singleton honour.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|drg: E/W seem to have overbid a bit in the other room here|pg||

nt|dburn: but if partner is in the habit of overcalling 2@d on this kind of thing, that's a risky strategy|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is becoming ugly|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S might not get DBL'd|pg||
nt|robbg: Here is trick 8, sort of.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: i suppose 1Nt =  3/4 control with stop in @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C like stayman|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 nt will make also and with 2 aces missing this is the kind of hand r'dam will like :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt work only for J in @D in the dummy to re-enter !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner did see that you overcalled at the 2-level, vulnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S at green might bid one more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S playing well|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3c not playing well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: even if declarer misguesses hearts|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|bobh1: he should be able to hold this to -500, no great disaster|pg||

nt|brolucius: And the bid removes very little space. Nothing much going for it.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i would not dream of overcalling at the two level vulnerable with k empty to 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: telling u guys a secret, i dont like to play against de wijs muller....they are too fast for me|pg||
nt|ady: might make an overtrick |pg||
nt|dburn: I imagine South will double it, if it gets bid|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ady: need to play 9@H  for best result|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont see how 9@H can cost|pg||
nt|ady: can still make 10 tricks on the spade lay|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: N/S are playing  TARZAN PRECISION (note by a kibitz) - played also by jansma/verhees |pg||
nt|drg: double based on the sound of the auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: im a beliebver in good suits for this bid never mind the point couint|pg||
nt|drg: west shown weakness and east doesn't have spade support|pg||
nt|dburn: still, declarer may escape for down one|pg||
nt|lestergold: but they cant double|pg||
nt|robbg: Now a @d underlead is necessary|pg||
nt|brolucius: A kibitzer suggests that 4@H might make. So, an inexperienced player who doubled on the East hand and found his partner jumping to 4@H might have been rewarded.|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|stewball: i wonder why S dbld 4@s but not 3nt|pg||
nt|drg: seems the most likely result|pg||
nt|mariner1: there is a "SLIM" chance of making...........|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the root of the eveil was that oveercall- when 1nt just about expresses the hand|pg||
nt|dburn: North-South may not realise, on this bidding, that they should be attacking diamonds of all things|pg||
nt|mariner1: the small @H probably ends it though|pg||
nt|lestergold: i c that they got away with a making nt in the closed room|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|ady: looks like 500     a small loss for e/w|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, @H10 was an unlucky lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: Don't be too sarcastic Jack :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: jansma verhees play more like polish :) not tarzan .|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 800|pg||
nt|jwit: Might hold it to 500 Roland.  Might get to ruff a heart in hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think their diamonds will run away|pg||
nt|lestergold: must lose 2h dim and 2 spades|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: of course they will - West has a pitch on a heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: ??|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c back tests declarer|pg||
nt|drg: south doesn't have an easy play to trick 2 after the duck|pg||
nt|mariner1: not my lead back though'|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a club might run away now|pg||
nt|drg: and the ruffing heart finesse along the way to deal with a diamond|pg||
nt|drg: ruff the other club|pg||
nt|mariner1: true S has no great return to be honest|pg||
nt|drg: and 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: good lead when strong hand in S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, but in TARZAN can find also sequence by jansma/verhees |pg||
nt|drg: when spades break and A@D onside along with the K@C|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: How will you score @D6?|pg||
nt|jwit: Or a club|pg||
nt|ady: now might be more    should have played a c lub before the diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: might as well put the queen on it - can't really help to duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: chance for west to steal a horrible contract but missed it|pg||
mb|5N|nt|ady: would have to guess the heart position though in South wins first sspade and plays a 2nd heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: claim and NEXT|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: need a @c back now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it's 500 again, Hauge should have won|pg||
nt|ady: play a clun immediately    then make the low trump by ruffing a club|pg||
nt|drg: ducking gives no hope|pg||
nt|stewball: to say nothing of it being pointless|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: now an easy 10|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: How do you get to dummy to ruff a club?|pg||
nt|lestergold: ducking seemed misere|pg||
nt|lestergold: and need to be allowed to ruff 4th heart in dummy but hes drawing trumops so likely 2 off|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobholl: once we played muller 4boards in 22  minutes almost a record :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: with a ladder|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|dburn: I don't understand this line at all|pg||
nt|mariner1: counting your losers leads to playing the Q@C, only way to remove a loser is if it wins|pg||

nt|allanr44: Should be no surprises here|pg||
nt|xenya: note that 4@H would have been better -- probably down 1|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: We have different bids to show both majors, but 1NT is not one of them|pg||
nt|kyosuke326: a balance double?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but according to klinger-mullamphy convention card from beijing, 1D=@D & @H|pg||
nt|flash: (15-17); up to partnership style whether to open 1NT or 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: sure, 2@c, 2@d, 2@h, and 2@s I have all seen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do they show a balanced hand inside the range?|pg||
nt|gracelin: I believe this 1NT showing both majors depend on position, in 3rd/4th position it denies a major, am I right, BU?|pg||
nt|dinos1: wd u open 1 strong @c?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|by: Y|pg||
nt|wygbe1: dont think i would, with the need to get h in play before they preempt  - and qj of c is no good|pg||
nt|chick: I wouldn't because it suggests a lot more HC strength, rather than distributional strength|pg||
nt|dinos1: agree - shape doesnt mean power|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: Bug will have ecstacy when he sees dummy|pg||
mb|3H|nt|by: then dejection|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or   the convention card for NS has drastically changed :(|pg||
nt|chick: as a very knowledgable spec points out, EW might get to a makeable 6@S after opps open a strong @C.  Not an everyday event|pg||
nt|mildredb: 2@H probably denies 4 @H|pg||
nt|pbundy: with the spots and 5 card suit i would upgrade to "18-19" range|pg||
nt|flash: the problem, as Peggy mentioned, with the call is that this is a max and a @S game might be missed|pg||

mb|5C|nt|dinos1: especially when we shd decide at 5 level|pg||
nt|sybarra: lucky slam |pg||
nt|dinos1: great bid 6@s|pg||
nt|pbundy: or a slam :)|pg||
nt|flash: opening 1@S and rebidding 2NT over a 1NT call seems adequate, but...|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: not lucky - good after STRONG @c|pg||
mb|6C|nt|beauch: anyway im sure south didnt anticipate defending1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: S & W are on same side of the screen, so i doubt Klinger had wrong info|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: you don't show BAL or not, Roland, you show that you got the majors. :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: east violates the rule by not leading a trump in this auction. |pg||
nt|wygbe1: will he work out the club position? |pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: better late than never|pg||
nt|mildredb: looks as tho they are on their way to their slam|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes, it does appear that they are going to get there anyway.  we'll see.|pg||
nt|flash: notice that the @S wastage and the @D duplication is irrelevant here!!|pg||
nt|flash: the right 15 in the West hand is enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: after strong opp opening, he can bid it as a sacrifice that makes :)|pg||
nt|allanr44: Hearts may be well-placed, depending on the line taken|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: there must be some rule about defending when opponents bid your longest suit :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: let|pg||
nt|pbundy: let's say we've all been in much worse slams|pg||
nt|xenya: good auction |pg||
nt|xenya: to a slightly optimistic contract perhaps|pg||
nt|allanr44: yes|pg||
nt|allanr44: It all hinges on the heart suit|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: needs to set up second club winner now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|beauch: indeed|pg||
nt|mildredb: that is an understatement - I've been in slam off 2 cahsing aces :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|pbundy: ONLY two, mildred?|pg||
nt|flash: the other room auction on 22 won't win any awards, but it did generate a plus (and lose 11 IMPs because of the defense in here)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mildredb: to the best of my recollection|pg||
nt|pbundy: w d|pg||
nt|pbundy: i once managed to get to 7NT off THREE cashing aces when a partner forgot we were playing drury|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|frankaus: restricted choice will let him down|pg||
nt|dinos1: sry - sure lucky) shd be @c loser ))|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if he places h king with south, could get clubs right - but would n bid the same with 8 solid h and two small clubs?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|wygbe1: or 8 solid h and stiff c quack?|pg||

nt|jwit: It will be hard for defense not to give declarer a heart ruff or club ruff or set up a spade trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but they can manage|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's probably worth looking at that one again, with DF or GIB, to see how the defenders can force 800.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2 IMPs is a cheap price for what seemed to be a very dubious 3@D from East.|pg||

nt|drg: an odd push|pg||
nt|lestergold: card play by west on  this one below par|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N certainly has play here.........|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4 being played in the closed room. West is in 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After North showed 5-5 in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N might be better than 4@H here,,,, though 4@H has play|pg||
mb|2H|nt|thegarve: Forget honour cards, its 9s that count|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: sometimes :)|pg||
nt|thegarve: might buy it in 3@c|pg||
nt|dburn: the same might be said of East at the other table on this one - how do you go down in 3NT?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4S a reasonable conmtract to reach unfortunat lie of cards|pg||
nt|jwit: 4H most likely contract.  Should fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: many would make that bid  |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: dont see this as a weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|jwit: This board rates to be a push|pg||
nt|mariner1: hard to dbl hook @H twice|pg||
nt|lestergold: over ruffs abound|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H is a sound spade raise|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: pass?|pg||
nt|lestergold: with the favourable lie of the hearts it is difficult to see|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: 23 pt 3N in other room   may well fail   even on a club lead through difficult communication    would need to play a low diamond from hand |pg||
nt|thegarve: Pass was clearcut|pg||
nt|drg: play for A@S onside instead of J@H?|pg||
nt|drg: this auction doesn't seem possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is this?|pg||
nt|mariner1: one way to avoid 3N :)|pg||
nt|dburn: this may or may not be a strong club based auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: playing precision so at most 15 in E|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bobh1: isnt it NS's hand in @s's?|pg||
nt|jwit: Don't think they will be able to compete high enough Bob|pg||
nt|bobh1: double now|pg||
nt|stewball: according to the play record N pitched down to dbl KJ@h |pg||
nt|stewball: and then the record stops|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well it will ceertainly gain imps today!|pg||
nt|jwit: Don't like that double at all with subminimum values, length in opponents suit, and shortness in partner's suit.|pg||
nt|robbg: Which top honor? Schifko was on a different page or improvising.|pg||
nt|mariner1: and a very weak @S suit|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: North was close to 1NT over the double. That would have allowed South to bid 2@S.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: 3 level t/o doubles are not 7 HCPs, partner should have 10+ so pass looked fine|pg||
nt|ady: dangerous 3@C bid vuln|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps, but there seems to be some doubt as to the actual result at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: will he guess this|pg||
nt|lestergold: i doubt it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jón will never guess it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|robbg: I don't like the neg x either but find it less odious than the 1@s overcalls we have seen.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would not double either, but many players seem to like to show the spades when they hold them (as we have already seen in this set).|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes J is not usually considered a top honor........|pg||
pc|d3|nt|daman: quite a lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: hes short of side suit tricks sohe has to play with the odds|pg||
nt|jwit: Great conservative judgement by Schifko, at least on this actual hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that 3NT has been bid three times and always made. Everyone has failed who bid the heart game.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: the other doubleton best lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: duck...................|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Expected the unexpected from Fredin|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: hes going to lose a heart two dims and at least one overruff surelt|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i see it made in t'other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Made in the other room on @HK lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah|pg||
nt|lestergold: on eup for Fredin he needs one this session|pg||
nt|lestergold: one up i mean|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brolucius: On a very sunny day N-S might make 4@S.|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he takes the double hook now, 11 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thos contract aint easy double dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: S might have rebid 2@D to show more|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jwit: I agree Rob|pg||
nt|robbg: I think what happened here is that Schifko thought he was showing values with the xx, so he thought 2@h was fully descriptive.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 reason to duck the lead is not having a good exit card|pg||
nt|hedyg: if S knew that N has the 2 red queens..|pg||
nt|lestergold: send it to darwin David?|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, at double dummy the play is fairly straightforward - declarer can even recover from his misguess at trick one|pg||
nt|dburn: but at the table, I'd be pretty surprised if he makes it|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|bobh1: yes but even in a thunderstorm they will make 3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobholl: east is placed again i think :) but not easy to play|pg||
nt|brolucius: You might redouble and then say 2@H when you held only two hearts. That's the problem.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jwit: Though conservatism was right here as long as they were going to play hearts rather than no trump, and no trump was extremely unlikely on this auction|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: no dbl now|pg||
nt|daman: @C spots are favo(u)rable if he playes it properly|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there is a club pin for tyhe double dummy enthusiasts|pg||
nt|lestergold: and carefully draw two rounds of truimps with the ace and queen but surely taht is hugh darwin territory|pg||
nt|dburn: that will not work|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to get back to hand so doesnt work|pg||
nt|dburn: he needs at some point to run both @s10 and @cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: in any case this chicken isnt going to fight for  Jon|pg||
nt|dburn: which is why I will be rather surprised if he makes it|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume this is a serious tank|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he does, he is too good to play against|pg||

nt|pbundy: india's teammates had a nice result in the other room on the hand where 4@H slipped through here|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|allanr44: yes indeed.  Although not what Italy are looking for|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2S|nt|gracelin: EW can make 4S only if take first round finesse in trumps or some defensive helps.|pg||
mb|d|nt|wygbe1: running the 9 was the percentage play for the suit, but the strong club opening might have given him a chance|pg||
mb|3S|nt|flash: New Zealand has always been fertile ground for aggressive, slightly off-beat approaches|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: this is quite an opening bid by West|pg||
pc|h9|nt|barbyh: what does 2nt show?|pg||
nt|pbundy: i would prefer it if clubs really meant clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: E opened 2@H in OR -- !@H here  might make all the difference|pg||
pc|h6|nt|flash: again, 1@C may be short; 1@D is an xfer to @Hs; 1@H shows at least 3 (4 possible in an unbalanced hand)|pg||
nt|xenya: again, not much to write home about?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mildredb: splinter promies 4@H|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|beauch: id guess 4card raise- weaish bergen -style |pg||
nt|allanr44: no.  how's the coffee?|pg||
nt|xenya: splendid|pg||
nt|shevek: I don't think this will make|pg||
nt|xenya: and it did|pg||
pc|d8|nt|beauch: 7/9|pg||
nt|allanr44: no, no way|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Got that help in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club to the queen and a low!? heart back|pg||
nt|by: be fair, they were defending three|pg||
nt|barbyh: and 3 cl?|pg||
nt|pbundy: if they don't get to slam after this start, i will eat my keyboard.|pg||
nt|flash: a new variation on 'no dessert if you don't eat your peas?'|pg||
nt|mildredb: luckily you don't need to go get the salt Peg :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|by: south tried to underlead her @hAQX and the @HK scored|pg||
nt|eieio: North leads the 7, South may lead a club back if he wins the first round|pg||
nt|allanr44: I meant no way it will make|pg||
nt|xenya: probably down 1 for a 3-imp gain|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: 1@S-2@C/2@D take care of INV and Game Forcing raises, so 2N probably mixed or bergen-ish as David says|pg||
nt|beauch: not sure- usually ron sends matt a system update most days!!!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dinos1: so 1@c opening only was helping here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gracelin: cashing HA is not good enough to stop four, since with 2 diamond entries, declarer can establish a H trick for club discard|pg||
nt|by: i think declarer can set up a heart trick for a @c pitch even if  he loses a spade.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south need to return a diamond or a trump|pg||
nt|pbundy: maybe.  i don't know how tasty my keyboard is, tho - new laptop :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|gracelin: and even that may not help if declarer takes the right view|pg||
pc|cK|nt|beauch: they wer my team- mates in a recent oz tourney- but there system was 2 complex for me:0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our fearless Vugraph Coordinator would call this a slam hand  - because it makes|pg||
nt|barbyh: but better in hts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this may give back the 1 imp they won on 1st board|pg||
nt|beauch: as im heading for seniors my pd and i are chopping pages out of our system notes- but ron/matt are added them at a fast pace|pg||
nt|barbyh: less is more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ron has long history of adding science -- and going through partners :)|pg||
nt|beauch: matt and ron have been playing for a couple of years- and had good results, except if my team- mates:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mildredb: %@D asks for @HQ|pg||
nt|pbundy: phew.|pg||
nt|xenya: bucks you up -- unlike the last 2 boards here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|by: i mean, @d to Q, @h to A, then @h ruffing finesse -- can't lose , and later take the spade hook|pg||
nt|mildredb: 5@D*|pg||
nt|allanr44: what time there?|pg||
nt|allanr44: heart was better i think|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mildredb: good slam - better if played by E|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mildredb: no @S lead - doesn't matter|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: oh -- it's already 9 o'clock -- not too early actually|pg||
nt|allanr44: ahah!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|by: lose @h @c @s|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north starts with J97x in club, not returning club may hurt the defense.  I wud lead C10 here instead of the 3rd best C7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will ron try for elimination hoping one defender has doubleton @C honor?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|by: I think that was eieio's point, yes, Patrick you are correct|pg||
nt|gracelin: running HJ is a free play|pg||
nt|athene: hi everyone....|pg||
nt|by: I think that the 3@s opening at the other table is a bit overboard|pg||
nt|eieio: I think he may take a spade hook right now|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Bill|pg||
nt|eieio: If he plays north for CK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs to but not clear it is right|pg||
nt|eieio: since he leads the @C7|pg||
nt|gracelin: no, south must have KQ of club or he will return a club long ago|pg||
nt|eieio: he may try to squeeze north|pg||
nt|eieio: oh yeah, good point|pg||
nt|kyosuke326: if North have @CK, why South didn't return a @C after the first lead?|pg||
nt|pbundy: right.  have to make a decision with a spade out|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or -- both clubs onside|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course, we can see no losing options (other than potentially an overtrick)|pg||

nt|dburn: mind you, even with @hK lead declarer at the other table did pretty well to get home|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: sry have to leave(tya) but my hopes for vorden are very low |pg||
nt|Walddk2: And now on to the 7% hand, the chance of both sides having 20 hcp|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S makes, 5@D makes|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D makes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: double?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double is fine if you play ELC|pg||
nt|brolucius: Redouble is normal on the South cards and then West can say 2@S.|pg||
nt|hedyg: double OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Equal Level Conversion|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most of the field played in 4@H. I suppose we should congratulate N-S here for staying low, but I don;t think South quite showed his hand in support of hearts.|pg||
nt|jwit: This should be a flat 4H|pg||
nt|mariner1: possible slam here with no @D lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: not that they should be in slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: better play 6@d by East, though|pg||
nt|stewball: chunky prempt|pg||
nt|mariner1: forget 6@D off an entry|pg||
nt|lestergold: he needs enuf entries to ruff out the spade k and enjoy the spades to make 56d playe by East of course |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 1 entry short of 6@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think he has them|pg||
nt|dburn: at this rate, he'll be doing well to get to game|pg||
nt|drg: must be something to 3@S, that can't be a w/r preempt|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hedyg: seems to be a forcing NT|pg||
nt|ady: pzrft score again    n/s should make 1NT   but e/w managed to buy the contract in 1NT in other room  a save |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They could well end up in a 4-2 fit here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like double much|pg||
nt|hedyg: W's partners never bid @d on his t/o doubles?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double is a take-out of hearts|pg||
nt|jwit: Double ok if you play same level conversions.  Will actually work well here.|pg||
nt|jwit: Diamond lead stands out however|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve: Double is better against a strong NT than a weak NT base|pg||
nt|ady: aggressive by west  if eastg is going to take out to diamonds with a  weak hand|pg||
nt|ady: east ereally has enough to pass|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brgpro: 4@s is a lucky make with no entry in dummy to take the trump finesse and both @h honors on side|pg||
nt|thegarve: some pairs like to defend and take a plus - West on the last hand showed that he preferred to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not promising extras when you pull clubs to diamonds to show S + D|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s= 1NT?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes its a trappy hand David|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he had a clue from the auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: so does not bidding it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this will be bad for e/w  especcially on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|thegarve: the double should help to find a @s lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: what does 3s mean surely notm a standard preempt much too good a hand|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: West will lead a top spade I suppose|pg||
nt|ady: at what level if there is a 2 or 3@H bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: way too strong for 3@S for me....... W must have seen them before :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4s isthe sensible spot on these cards|pg||
nt|dburn: it is possible that 3@s was part of the system, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: so he did|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzgq: That could prove to be a major swing to 't Onstein, if Muller passes|pg||
nt|brgpro: i remember once in a big tournament in NED. years ago....someone led a trump from xxx when the opps reached 7@s. the book say so what can go wrong? pd had Kx and dummy was void..|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Or not, sorry, thinking error :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: no big deal, 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I was thinking 500+420|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont see how they beat this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe both of you thought East was on lead|pg||
nt|robbg: Schifko has to carry on, I would think.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: Still should apply Ady|pg||
nt|lestergold: a nice easy one for us not much to say infrangible 4S|pg||
nt|daman: this is a piano hand   time to refill my coffee|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brolucius: South has a huge hand in general, but is worried about the x-x-x in diamonds.|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is a very strong 2@H call,,,,,,|pg||
nt|robbg: I hope I do better with my Super Bowl pick!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now that they have stopped in 3@H it will be good tactics for West to avoid the diamond lead.|pg||
nt|mariner1: and that is?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: Got to be Arizona, since he lives there|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: pick the q for an overtrick|pg||
nt|robbg: I can't conceive of pass with Schifko's hand, given that 2NT is an invitation!|pg||
nt|robbg: Go Cards!|pg||
nt|jwit: I agree with you on not passing Robb, not on Arizona lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north ant givepartner a dim ruff and cash two hearts she  can only do one or the other|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brgpro: what is E thinking about? 5@s?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If West knew that South's 1@S was artificial then perhaps he should have bid 2@S instead of doubling. |pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: sorry    contract played by west|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hedyg: do we know if NS play transfer bids over double?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4 if need be. If partner really bids 4@C over 3@H, he must have some values|pg||
nt|bobh1: the 2@s bid stole the board|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|brgpro: can't be right...|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: what am i talking about only two spades in the soputh hand]|pg||
nt|dburn: odd sort of play, that - why go against the odds?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: i would have played @h after the A@S|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: I understand   but they may be in some difficulty at the 4 levedl if west has just got 6 clubs |pg||
nt|lestergold: so better play hearts now to hold to 4|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mariner1: you are still right, can't do both :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well not the other|pg||
nt|lestergold: logically i am right|pg||
nt|lestergold: but intellectually im an idiot|pg||
nt|mariner1: or merely confuzed|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And if he has no values, he has 7 clubs|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jwit: I think I would have actually bid 2S rather than double with West hand with 5 spades.|pg||
nt|mariner1: cornfuzed as we said in the South|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|dburn: still, I guess Fredin didn't get where he is today by making normal plays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fredin likes the sublime|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobh1: was the 2@s bid alerted?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He won't bid 4@C on Qxxxxx and out|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bobh1: i meant the 1@s bid?|pg||
nt|ady: he can haved some values    but not expecting a singleton club with pard|pg||

mb|4S|nt|by: 2@c is dury|pg||
nt|fabsayc: drury?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = artificial, INV strength|pg||
nt|mildredb: so who sits out when Hampson plays?  Cheek or Grue?|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: drury, asking if partner has something resembling a real opening bid|pg||
nt|by: kidding aside, it shows 3@h and 10-14|pg||
nt|fabsayc: rather limited if it promises hearts, if is size ask is not really drury|pg||
nt|athene: facing 3-card support and 10-14 hcp, isn't it simpler for north to just rebid 4@H and conceal information from the defence?|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: N decides to be scientific|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 3n can always make, but on a club lead declarer needs to put up the king, not run it to the ten|pg||
nt|flash: sorry - other team from India in 5th...    India Nat'l now in 12th|pg||
nt|pbundy: i believe i saw hampson playing with grue, mildred|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: but - not sure that they do it that way always|pg||
nt|mildredb: I'm assuming that Meckwell plays all the time - perhaps erroneously|pg||
nt|pbundy: should cornell pass here?  partner IS a passed hand.......|pg||
nt|flash: the X was responsive (and should show at least tolerance for @Hs)|pg||
nt|xenya: in OR, E didn't overcall -- much livelier here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|allanr44: Good 2S|pg||
pc|h8|nt|beauch: no- ron bid 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S was non-minimum|pg||
nt|barbyh: I was in shock|pg||
nt|xenya: yes but a bit too heavy perhaps, 1@S was an alternative at these colours|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe it's one of those 8-11|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gracelin: 6H is actually on, just not biddable|pg||
nt|beauch: rewind|pg||
nt|barbyh: what? never bid his diamonds|pg||
nt|pbundy: i like pass myself.  no clear fit whatsoever - and - may nip it more than 1 for a nice profit.|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe, yes|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it may have meant 6+@S or 5@S & 4@C|pg||
nt|wygbe1: n had the chance to make the winning bid of 3n from his side|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy to be in 3 nt |pg||
nt|allanr44: The sequence was coloured ... white|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: in 6, if you draw trumps then play @C to @CJ and @CK, you have to decide if east is playing obligatory falsecard from @CQ10x|pg||
nt|beauch: yes Barbara - if ron had passed me 2!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dinos1: wd u prefer 2@c or 2N bid by S?|pg||
nt|flash: the virtue of passing is that 2@CX isn't overly painful if it should happen to make...|pg||
nt|xenya: so Australia Selected declaring in both rooms|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pbundy: yes; that, too|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even with void in partner's suit, Klinger's hand has lots of play potential|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|nt|barbyh: actually its cold|pg||
nt|barbyh: without a trump lead|pg||
nt|beauch: hmm - east wondering about bidding 7!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right - trump lead eliminates @H ruff|pg||
nt|flash: a bath coup and it's not even Friday night...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: 5@S = 2 key cards + trump Q -- klinger will NOT show his void, which would actually slow down mullamphy|pg||
nt|flash: (that's the duck of the @H lead by South - it gains a trick should West continue the suit)|pg||
nt|xenya: and they may well succeed in both rooms, too?|pg||
nt|allanr44: Might make for 6 IMPS|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Ish in the tank|pg||
nt|allanr44: If they attack hearts and blow the late entry, -1 for +2 IMPs|pg||
pc|h6|nt|beauch: good auction- east hand full of controls- reached good spot|pg||
nt|flash: @S6 back to show the @DA?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: this lead will make things tough too|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|gracelin: I will admire him if East is leading CQ from Q10x also.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: but 3 pitches on @S and @H ruff should bring in 12 tricks|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: yes :) i think he will pay off to that|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|wygbe1: pretty amazing 4c bid|pg||

nt|dburn: remarkable effort to get to 3NT on these cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart lead on the last hand against a suit contract i cant remember seeing anytghing like it but it sure fmurdered a giant|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Is there a Chandlers Ford in Sussex now?|pg||
nt|ady: many would bid 2@S with the west hand   as natural   and double with only 4 spades|pg||
nt|jwit: This board should surely be flat, though they may play 4S making 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, but I don't think they play ELC in Sussex either|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, it is an instructive mistake - to look only at the diamonds when the rest of his hand was shouting 'Bid game!'|pg||
nt|robbg: Of all the unlikely things that happened in 2008, the Cards winning the NFC is possibly the unlikliest!|pg||
nt|mariner1: now a classic 3N NS|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: I know Chandler's Ford is in Hampshire|pg||
nt|lestergold: and even more remarkeable to make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: If NS manage to stay out of slam here, the match will be all but sealed|pg||
nt|dburn: and if the sequence in the Open room is correct, the bidding was indeed remarkable|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D showing multi or a weak major|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brgpro: but the problem is that 6@h doesnt make....|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yup, @DK offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: And the @DT missing :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 5@S |pg||
nt|hedyg: on their way to @ss|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: well the more expected contract|pg||
nt|dburn: Grue no doubt in experimental mode having put a cold game on the floor earllier in proceedings|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzgq: Btw, for all those who don't know, there's a screen dividing SW and NE. That forces me to wait for the tray to go through to enter biddings.|pg||
nt|mariner1: so this will be good for Shell since they missed their game EW|pg||

nt|brolucius: This is the only table of 38 where game was not reached!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|thegarve: West has a 2.5@s rebid|pg||

nt|drg: this time in his favour|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobh1: wonder how they held 3n to 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Closed played very fast and are finished|pg||
nt|dburn: not to argue with success, but I am not sure of the need for doing that sort of thing - sure, Grue is havign a shocker of a set, but he has team-mates|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jwit: 3NT is actually a superior contract on these cards.  |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2 aces out and @d lead?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lestergold: off to the best lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Closed S opened a more reasonable (to me) 1@H on last board|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: can make, but likely wont|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|jwit: How did we get past 3NT here?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|brgpro: they play reversed, pass=ask pd to X and X would have asked pd to act|pg||
nt|lestergold: will probably now just make 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless north opens clubs|pg||
nt|robbg: Obviously 2NT was forcing. Not everybody plays it that way. But there is something wrong (IMO) with a system that requires you to get beyond 3NT to describe a balanced 16.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bobh1: yep that would do it . . . so 4@s is the better contract|pg||
nt|jwit: 4S could be beaten with some outlandish distributions.  Can't touch 3NT with a crowbar|pg||
nt|lestergold: will probably make this by picking the dims up along with favourable position of the heart ace|pg||
nt|mariner1: this one getting away some|pg||
nt|brolucius: North is being very ambitious (to use a polite word) with his 4-3-3-3 shape opposite a weak NT.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jwit: Agree 100% David|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree he is being polite :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing the weak 1NT, it would go 1NT - 3NT. You would then have more energy left for the play.|pg||
nt|robbg: It seems to me that you should either play a direct 3NT as 16-17 or so, or an inverted raise followed by a jump to 3NT as 16-17.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzgq: Bertens: "Another sad display"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q in @D would be more clear|pg||
nt|thegarve: it is worth discussing whteher to use 2@C as a potential 2.5@s rebid|pg||
nt|ady: about 50-50 Hedy     guess heart will make|pg||
nt|lestergold: well south musnt continue clubs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: best|pg||
nt|robbg: but they haven't made 4@s yet.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they ended in a tough Moysian Fit|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: can guess @s as well|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: yes     as it happens  in 3NT  it must be right to play clubs first as that might bring in enough tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://icelandairopen.com/index.php?m=D3&id=M_OPENTEAMS2009&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2009|pg||
nt|mariner1: for leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|mariner1: and the 4@H was bid on 5 in Closed so the skunk is over|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bobh1: that's true; 4@s is better at mps but 3n at imps|pg||

nt|Walddk2: There you go again; the spectacular|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DQ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many players, probably most, would raise 1NT to 3NT with North's 4-3-3-3 shape. As happened at the other table.|pg||
nt|daman: Go Roger|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It doesn't always work for him|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||

pc|h2|nt|hedyg: no need to guess @H anymore|pg||
nt|brolucius: They seem to have introduced spades only on the 9th bid of the auction. Very strange.|pg||

nt|hedyg: 10 imps|pg||
nt|thegarve: Ace doubleton leads give a lot of clues|pg||
nt|ady: last hand  heart guess is superior   as if ggetgting it wrong  you can still make if not losing a spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: some have a system where after stayman and a major by pd 3 OM shows fit in a 4 3 3 3 hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: and he can decide|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  better than 3NT    if the A@C and A@H  rerversed and you play clubs first you might go down if clubs dont break|pg||
nt|jwit: I usually raise 1NT to 3NT when I have a flat hand with a lot of secondary cards, but bid Stayman with primaries.  These cards seem a little more prime than secondary, so I don't ...|pg||
nt|jwit: fault Stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: waiting for the board|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Times newspaper reported last week that many local councils were abolishing the apostrophe in street names. They are replacing existing signs with new ones at great expense. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Apparently they abolished such apostrophes in the USA in 1890 (really) and there are only five exceptions there, including Martha's Vineyard.|pg||
nt|jwit: How could West not play the last diamond when in with the club queen?|pg||
nt|mariner1: now the penultimate board of this session|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lestergold: well evenly divided points a part score battle maybe here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: ok|pg||
nt|mariner1: beating 4@H was good here,,,,,,,, @c lead needed|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: 3@H or pass, panel?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Svendsen passed|pg||
nt|ady: that should stir east to a slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: i like 3@h|pg||
nt|brolucius: David Greenwood will approve, but for those of us who understand the apostrophe...|pg||
nt|ady: pass for me|pg||
nt|jwit: I would pass as well with weak suit|pg||
nt|bobh1: not so sure i like 3@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's really strange that apostrophe has no apostrophé|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would pass on the West cards, but it is tempting to bid. They say you should not bid 'weak over weak'.|pg||
nt|hedyg: partner has the right to expect more|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6NT from East?!|pg||
nt|daman: we'll see if EW can stop below game|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: Interesting 3NT with a meager @H stop|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this 3Nt is to play (gambling with K singleton in @h)|pg||
nt|brgpro: ok guys, i am sure we will know muller's decision by tomorrow morning|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Haha, but he has to bring his average speed down, he's played extraordinary fast the first couple of boards.|pg||
nt|drg: another remarkable auction in the other room|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: I dobt it, and you know, sometimes @SK is onside after the opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: *doubt|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to |pg||
nt|daman: put on the brakes|pg||
nt|robbg: Definitely a mental mistake.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|bobh1: to me voids are values, especially in their known suit|pg||
nt|jwit: 3H vulnerable is asking for trouble in my opinion on that suit and no source of tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h looks the limit in a suit contract but N//S can make about 3 C|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers were asking about 9@D after Q@C win,,, to set the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: no|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: 4@C is daisy-picking. What did he expect to get in return?|pg||
nt|brolucius: perhaps this auction will persuade us all not to bid on a hand like West's in the future.|pg||
nt|jwit: Of course when partner has 20HCPs lol|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6-4 is nice, having 4@s's is nice; lot's of reasons to bid|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT a very poor contract    if in a slam  should be in a red suit    thought diamonds split badly|pg||
nt|jwit: If you like going for big numbers from time to time Bob|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve: East is worth a raise with a singleton @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: kickback?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart bid ensures the killing lead against 4|pg||
nt|daman: bravo|pg||
nt|lestergold: but east has respected his partners minimum response tohis nenquiry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't it a lucky rather than a good stop, George?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bridge_one: in this situation A in @H is obliged ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Very unlucky @C break here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cue bid I assume|pg||
nt|hedyg: guess not|pg||
nt|brolucius: West wisely decides not to cue-bid the club void on his sub-sub-minimum hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: West's 3@S did not do justice to his support. He should have bid 3@H.|pg||
nt|robbg: As well they should, a mental error as I said.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brgpro: well. the first sight of dummy huub thought his gambling worked.....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: odd-ur|pg||
nt|bobh1: wisely . . . except slam is cold|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What if a club control is all partner needs?|pg||
nt|ady: what does east expect pard to do with no diamond control  if he has got a bit more?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could well have K@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: on board 6 the Closed are in 3N, a much easier spot|pg||
nt|robbg: I agree completely David.|pg||
nt|jwit: Good contract here.  Trump lead would have been best, but with diamonds behaving, contract is cold.|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session is scheduled for 52 minutes from now -|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: De Wijs: "I won't signal too enthusiastically :)"|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky for them he didnt|pg||
nt|drg: needed a red suit lead to set this|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|lestergold: well 15 points with tenace acesless combos in the minors is not a mandatory raise to game of a min weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|daman: you can look at it 2 ways     lucky or clever|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: but will still sign off with no diamond control|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: You can't expect the red-suit breaks that you need after a 3@C opening. |pg||
nt|drg: so won't be much of a swing|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1N not a great spot|pg||

pc|s5|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|hedyg: a crystal ball? is that what it is called?|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers commenting on the 1N here..... in China and much of the East they bid 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: and 2 N and overcall 1N with stiffs regularly so a little shape is becoming common|pg||
pc|dT|pg||

nt|jwit: I wouldn't swim a river of crocodiles to be in a slam on the combined EW cards, especially with a vulnerable 3C bid from South.  4-1 trumps and you have a ton of work to do|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|drg: inviting game on it was a bit of a stretch|pg||

nt|pbundy: well; on the 2@CX hand, i wouldn't say that n/s did anything particularly wrong.  unfortunate hand for them|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes!  another upgrader|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|gracelin: in some events of the NEC Cup next week, JCBL use a rule-of-10 to restrict preemptive opening, your HCP plus length must  be no less than 10.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Probably a new leader by 1 after this board|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lol|pg||

mb|p|nt|kyosuke326: 4 or 5 Imps for the leader.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Big @C - 2@C = game force 4+@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: may land in 3nt|pg||
mb|2D|an| |mb|p|nt|athene: interesting decision by East here|pg||
nt|athene: and not obvious at all, given the vulnerability|pg||
nt|kyosuke326: I thought (3@D) - (P) - 3@S - 4@S (Dbl) :)|pg||
nt|flash: we'll assume that 3@S is MSS (minor-suit stayman)|pg||
nt|flash: 4NT looks like an underbid?   (but South's source of tricks should suffice to have him bid more)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: AND guarantees some singleton or void|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Bertheau artificially asking via relays -- we can only guess about Nystrom's responses|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D shows @Hs no doubt|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dinos1: duplication in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps north had visible problems passing 3@D|pg||
nt|athene: if so, east knows it's because he has a good hand, not because he has a diamond fit|pg||
nt|beauch: where will they stop -6@D?|pg||
nt|pbundy: i doubt east will find the only lead to give declarer a minor scare|pg||
nt|mildredb: i agree, I'd have not made a passable bid :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: at least - i'd certainly lead the diamond !J|pg||
nt|pbundy: @DJ|pg||
nt|allanr44: Oh well ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: arbitrary rules on preempts, acbl had one that weak two's had to have max 6 point range|pg||

nt|xenya: i wonder what N showed with his sequence...|pg||

nt|barbyh: so many ways to play it|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|barbyh: probably the same result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even finding the @CQ may be suspect|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@S +1 was a push -- so Australia still pitching a shutout|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: or I should say "Australia - Open"  OZ is fielding 3 full teams -- and a partnership to a 4th|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 9@D sp for @S|pg||

nt|shevek: yet another flat board...|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|xenya: now declarer might have some work to do|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: has to ruff|pg||
nt|gracelin: and no reason not to, partner must have SA or declarer will just ruff spade|pg||
nt|gracelin: I guess East is having a trip to the toilet|pg||
nt|eieio: It's not that easy for him to reconstruct the whole thing, I believe south usually have only 6 diamonds with this opening|pg||
nt|eieio: He doesn't know south has the 7th diamond|pg||
nt|fabsayc: makes no difference, cant kill heart winners if declarer has 3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gracelin: and partner's signal in heart length should tell him declarer has no more heart, so ruff and draw trump.  What's the rblem ?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to Mike, George and David for sublime commentary (I like that word)|pg||
nt|lestergold: do i see a double by Schifko?|pg||
nt|daman: S is making his partner pay a big price for competing      probably hoping he has gthe @H Ace|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|lestergold: sorry but i do not understand this double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next match scheduled to start in exactly half an hour. Welcome back then|pg||

nt|mariner1: (USA)........|pg||
nt|brolucius: Again Kendrick is determined to let partner know of the good spades.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S   makes    but hard to reach unless north decides to transfer with 3@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: HI Al :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes its a wondeful service to all bridge fanatics|pg||
nt|drg: not my choice|pg||

mb|p|nt|wollies: hi folks |pg||
nt|hedyg: only bid 7+ card suits?|pg||
nt|robbg: Is there any nation in the world that has more good bridge per capita than Iceland?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: so NS should pickup a few more here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s looks like no problem with lie of dims friendly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: striped-tailed ape, since East-West can in fact make a slam, but...|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: hoi mart|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hello Mart|pg||
nt|wollies: Hi Jack |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: EW seem to have copied the NS bidding system here :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: It looks like a relay auction|pg||
nt|brgpro: well...this is not an easy 6NT to reach...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but this 3NT can be a dangerous bid - now need 4@C by west to no lose the slam|pg||
nt|brgpro: westra made a very aggressive 3@c jump bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Today it seems you can make 12 tricks with two aces missing, and 13 with one ace missing :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would prefere 3@D by west over 2@H|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes, we can often finesse one of the Aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I would've bid 3@C too, but I'm a junior :) Nice distr. imo|pg||
nt|brgpro: but 3@c is GF....not my choice though|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@D by East, you mean?|pg||
nt|wollies: hard to reach now I think |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: If they do indeed miss it, the match is locked|pg||
nt|brgpro: is it open now??|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@S is the more probable slam to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Hardly :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT showing fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s would deny|pg||
nt|bobh1: i like S's 3n bid--a source of tricks and secure @c stopper|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it was interesting, and we end on a strong point with both N-S pairs bidding and making 3NT after an opposing opening bid. They did well.|pg||
nt|lestergold: in fact pobably make 3|pg||
nt|drg: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This result will make the tournament all the more exciting|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont like to use the bonkers word in this exalted company but with the square root of no defence what is he doing?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: north was likely to pass if South just bid 3@S after the transfer|pg||
nt|mariner1: Last but not least, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Sharon Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wollies: I think they will reach  6 @S easier than 6 NT |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 5@D seems like voidwood|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Asking for P|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: to show his aces, but not the @DA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D is sure void|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Or maybe just telling p to bid the final contract|pg||
nt|ady: this looks pretty flat      cherio all|pg||
nt|mariner1: broadcasts. Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: lovers worldwide!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|thegarve: He did not get any credit for discovering the good ol' U S of A - like Stayman he did not discover the method e publicized it|pg||
nt|jwit: Bad lead for the defense|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, bridge players are funny...they bid a suit on the 5 level and everyone is saying he has NONE!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: lol|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D (void) in this situation is for sure  2 - 6 - 5 and it is a choose for the partner to bid the best final contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I hope 6@C is not meant as such...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would bid 4@C, leaving more space at my p to continue the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Who would then bid 4@D, which is of no use, I think|pg||
nt|wollies: maybe it will end here ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: It doesn't seem worse than 6@S to me|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West don't know the stong of the partner - he can have the same cards without Q in @C for example ...|pg||
nt|wollies: Cant be true  that Muller is  also thinking here ?? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: He's not, but there's a screen separating SW from NE|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: So I can't enter anything untill the tray has passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1 trick lost in each suit|pg||
nt|drg: likely 3 more imps to win by 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: al right one maybe trick|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it seem a exploration run rather than a bridge auction|pg||
nt|bobh1: dont think ducking the @h was such a great idea|pg||
nt|brolucius: And completing 10 boards inside one hour gets a nod of approval from me.|pg||
nt|lestergold: will Jon drop the stiffy K?|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I knew it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bridge_one: this 6@S is a invention - 5@D give at the partner the option to take the decision, so need to pass at 6@C now - East could have KQxxx in @S, so 6@C was OK, and 6@S nedd 3/3 ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem started with the choose of 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: But if 6@C missed the QJ(T), it's a disaster|pg||
nt|brgpro: no, pd rebid 2@s after 4th suit, has to be a good 5 card or 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Now Muller is thinking :)|pg||
nt|wollies: :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: over 5@D with xxx in @C East could bid 5@S, so 6 @C is a choose, isn't a forced bid|pg||
nt|brgpro: oh no!!!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, Muller is thinkink :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: tell him to lead the 4th card from his left hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Jack, do you play "GO" (weiqi in chinese) ?|pg||
nt|brgpro: little bit|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: That would be the nel (trump-9)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this auction remember me a waste tesuji of go :)|pg||
nt|wollies: what I thought  good C |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 9 hours for each player in go challenge - similar at this match ...|pg||
nt|brgpro: it takes 5 minutes to lead and 5 seconds( maybe even less) to finish the hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim 10|pg||
nt|ady: 7 imps to n/s|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
nt|lestergold: no he was folled by the doubel so no overtrik|pg||
nt|daman: you have to be kidding|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: perhaps a little fortunate   many would have passed 2NT opening|pg||
nt|thegarve: must transfer - you may even have a 55@s fit|pg||
nt|ady: found partner with a monster   and still 4@S  not guaranteed|pg||
nt|hedyg: our thanks to our outstanding operator,Johann Sigurdarson . well done! to my excellent fellow commentators David Edwin, Martin Garvey and of course Roland Wald for donating their ...|pg||

nt|beauch: only successful line is to run d10from dummy- anyone know the odds?|pg||
nt|allanr44: cost almost as much as missing the slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: depends how you feel about barf preempts :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: weak nt in action |pg||
nt|allanr44: Another heart suit - Axx opposite Q10 etc|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: a chance for a big pick-up for the lagging team if NS can stop in 3NT ere|pg||
nt|flash: 6-card major; 7 HCP    is on the card|pg||
nt|flash: 2@S is pass or correct|pg||
nt|pbundy: i would be hoping that the opponents correct and declare myself|pg||
nt|flash: 1st chair, white vs red, is usually seen as a license to steal|pg||

nt|flash: Conditions of Contest, etc. on the web site|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: OR Burgess opened 2@s W and played|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps N was certain he had already achieved an endplay |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|shevek: yes, seems to be a pattern|pg||
nt|xenya: @DK with W|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: finding the trump suit would have been double dummy -- the question is was this best play for one loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: 2@h shows only 4@h with extras|pg||
nt|by: sorry, only 4@s with extras|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for a good program that checks single suit play, scope out http://home.planet.nl/ narcis45/SuitPlay/|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: guess that 2D is already GF, right ?|pg||
nt|beauch: no slam!|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: BTU-edge defeated SCU 88-67.6|pg||
nt|by: no, 2@d is shows 10-14|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|beauch: looks like 1 down here?|pg||
nt|flash: note that North didn't even xfer b4 bidding 3NT - the @S length suggests that even if partner has @H length, there's a ruff (or 2) looming|pg||
nt|allanr44: heres a big collect|pg||
pc|c5|nt|by: 2@s shows minimum within the range and only 3@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: by, this is the reason I don't particularly enjoy Moscito.  any accidents.|pg||
nt|gracelin: many|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kyosuke326: still a 6 or 7 IMPs pickup for BTU-cheng|pg||
nt|gracelin: but still 6-7 imps.  I also don't understand why 5D failed in closed room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure moscito is to blame per se, 2@D is too space consuming as a relay|pg||
nt|kyosuke326: yes, especially after @H first lead in the closed room|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|flash: assuming that the defense gets @Cs started before too many aces are knocked out, this isn't going to make|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Declarer never led a spade toward the queen|pg||
nt|flash: as in @HA, @C honor...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: for specs who think East is strong for 3@D --  the only rule is that there are NO rules for 3rd seat preempts :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: reasonable auction i think, but... |pg||
pc|dK|nt|allanr44: now an entry|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|flash: down 2...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Hoping to endplay East with a heart instead|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is not fair, the team stopped in 2S won 6-7 imps over the team bid to 5D.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|pbundy: as is so often the case when someone preempts- suits not breaking well for declarer|pg||
nt|mildredb: so true|pg||
nt|pbundy: nice try hoping for a singleton 9 or 10 in the west hand in the @H suit|pg||
nt|xenya: good guess in @Ss -- heading for overtrick now?|pg||
nt|allanr44: same heart guess as before|pg||
nt|allanr44: only for overtrick|pg||
nt|shevek: guess we'll see a good win by Lavazza (some will say: was about time)|pg||
nt|shevek: they just had a slow start :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|beauch: matt mullamphy no longer a junior - so his pre-empts are usually very sound|pg||
nt|flash: slam on 27 also a push|pg||
nt|flash: New Zealand now leading the event|pg||
nt|pbundy: might slip after this result. of course, so far no danger of slipping signficantly|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 9 and 10 first in this room before comparisons from the closed room when we roll over to board 1|pg||
nt|daman: and we're off|pg||
nt|robbg: Starting with a dull one I see :)|pg||
nt|jwit: Interesting hand to start with|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hedyg: a no finesse slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: n/S likely to reach 4S |pg||
nt|drg: which makes from north on the J@D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9-10 in this room first before comparisons from the closed room when we roll over to board 1|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: just play all your tops|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: The Shell team includes Cheek and Grue who won the Open Pairs yesterday..... and|pg||
nt|lestergold: if played by North may not get heart lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: Disa and Deas were 4th I think|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ady: 6@H   or 6@D  on heart guess|pg||
nt|drg: the double will help|pg||
nt|lestergold: will nnow|pg||
nt|daman: EW can make 5@D or 5@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have played on teams with David Kendrick, many years ago. At that time he was partnered by Mike Pomfrey, who subsequently won £500,000 on Who Wants to be a Millionaire?|pg||
nt|robbg: I never pass and wait, but in this case I would make an exception like Fredin.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wollies: Once played  against Muller ....inearly 90-ies     he was thinking  pl  10-12 minutes  and  we were in a hurry to change  tables   so we had to leave that table .....now  about 16- ...|pg||
nt|wollies: years  ago  he still has to play that card :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9-10 in this room first before comparisons from the closed room when we roll over to board 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: South obviously use 1@S to show the minors (or possibly a transfer), double to show any number of spades.f|pg||
nt|bobh1: NS probably playing the treatment that dbl shows 4+ @s's and 1s relates to the minors|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 dims on for E/W|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  16+|pg||
nt|daman: shifko should preempt|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|bobh1: as BroL says . . . |pg||
nt|lestergold: 5d better than c because u dont need to find qc necessarily|pg||
mb|p|nt|robbg: 3@c is awfully big, but may work well here.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|brolucius: One good rule is that you should never pass, with a trump stack, unless you intend to pass a subsequent re-opening double.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: Haha|pg||
nt|hedyg: might miss the Q@H once the Q@D drops singleton|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse the tansfers|pg||
nt|drg: no chance if south played it|pg||
nt|lestergold: so 1 off is predicted|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: E/W play precision 14-16nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: should be sunk off the top|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably will be off on most auctions only makes when east is on lead and finds a trump or dim lead|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: But you won't test diamonds first|pg||
nt|hedyg: makes longer @hs and thus the Q more probable in W|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot miss 4 @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you can't do that in a heart contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|drg: I'm not particularly fond of 1N with 4252, holding spades, and all the points in the long suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: well so much for sinking :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: am i imaginaing things|pg||
nt|daman: correct Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can Fredin find the lead against 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1NT denies 3@ss|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT not entirely secure.|pg||
nt|jwit: This will not be a success story|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nope|pg||
nt|daman: scroll up Roland|pg||
mb|4C|nt|brolucius: In normal methods, South's 2@H would be game-forcing, which his hand does not seem to merit.|pg||
nt|bobh1: the saving grace is I don't think anything makes|pg||
nt|robbg: Interesting 4@h bid by Fredin, one might expect 3@s|pg||
nt|jwit: I would have bid 3S with Fredin's hand rather than 4H.  Partner is allowed to have a stiff heart and four spades occasionally, especially on this auction, where neither of the ...|pg||
nt|jwit: opponents have shown spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: hehehe|pg||
nt|mariner1: this works out and EW can make 5@C or 6@C if they envoked the Rabbi's Rule|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: did west ask for a heart lead and partnwer said i know better how about a diamond?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: No, EW can make a few diamonds|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: How North's eyes must light up when he sees the @HQ-J in dummy.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: maybe 2@H showed extra @ss|pg||
pc|c4|nt|drg: very odd |pg||
nt|mariner1: I sure thought the 2@H DBL would bring a @H lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: only out of turn|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi David|pg||
nt|mariner1: and will be happy @S are 3 3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: hi Roland|pg||

pc|d3|nt|vugraphzgq: Unlucky @C switch|pg||

pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to David Burn|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dburn: hello|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: have i misunderstood maybe they play double of a suit is lead the next lower ranking ?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi David :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: As you see, they don't use surnames much in Iceland. These are all first names|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry joke|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: surnames are too long|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

nt|lestergold: bad tatse|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the face of it, South should bid 2@S... or if feeling optimistic 3@S. But I expect they like to have every bid artificial at this level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and typing|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|c7|nt|lestergold: well bad tipping too|pg||

nt|beauch: ron klinger dreams he is still a junior - so he can bid with less!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think Jeff Meckstroth is a junior either -- but 'sound' isn't a word i've ever heard to describe ANY of his preemptive tactics|pg||
nt|mildredb: We've all been there & done that|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: cheng gained 6 in board 23. Very tight finish|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: we can't emphasize enough the need to stay focused while you're at the table|pg||
nt|allanr44: As was noted, an unusual backwash squeeze|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: wow -- only 2 hands left :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 1@D could actually be opened on VOID|pg||
mb|p|nt|by: he really wants a ruff with that?|pg||
nt|gracelin: HA and H will let it through|pg||
nt|beauch: catch- all|pg||
nt|pbundy: now is THIS an upgrade?  or am i miscounting again?|pg||
nt|mildredb: up grade|pg||
nt|pbundy: t u mildred :)|pg||
nt|xenya: chance for the trailing team|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dinos1: 6 or 7@h? |pg||
nt|flash: unless their NT is 14-16, it would appear to qualify as an upgrade   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 7 if they can find it|pg||
nt|mildredb: luckily didn't open 1NT - as might end up in 3 & not liked the result|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: don't really care for 1N opening|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gracelin: but declarer can probably discard the 3rd H on a good diamond anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: so that's 6 imps to USI-mixed, the lead changes hand again|pg||
nt|pbundy: again; i've been in worse slams|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: many pairs have the science to determine whether 2@S is 3 or 4 card support -- but Bertheau didn't care|pg||
nt|beauch: yes if peter only had 4@S he would check out with 2Nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and he's elated to see that his @H holding is golden|pg||
nt|flash: next-to-last board of this match; round 4 scheduled to start in 25 minutes|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 1 suited nothing in the majors + stiff Ace|pg||
nt|xenya: me neither but looks like it's their style|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still contract reached|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dinos1: for 7 @sK shd be in @d, plus opener must have these @c's|pg||
nt|allanr44: didn't expect NT from south|pg||
nt|xenya: wrongsided but hardly matters here -- 3N seems to be on a @H finesse anyway |pg||
nt|shevek: 2@h I think was GF|pg||
pc|s8|nt|allanr44: yes, but heart stopper?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|beauch: enquire about pds holding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hang on -- in the notes it actually says  1@D-1@S;2@S = 11-14, 4@H 3@S and some singleton or void|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so no guessing involved!|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|beauch: great system:0|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chick: a nice safe spot anyway|pg||
nt|flash: might South have done more here?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: might be a bit awkward now|pg||
nt|xenya: he needs to come to hand with @DA and finesse trumps|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pbundy: i am very surprised at south's actions here - unless i misunderstood something about the auction|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|allanr44: good|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: The defence can counter if North inserts @H9 at trick 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South can prevent declarer from pitching a heart|pg||
nt|by: really?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how do they untangle their tricks roland|pg||
pc|d2|pc|sT|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|mildredb: North does have the perfecta - no @C cards wasted|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|h2|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d7|pc|h5|nt|flash: might a jump to 5@H instead of the quiet 4@H call have done more justice to the hand??|pg||

nt|hedyg: some of the first names are quite long too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rune Hauge is a football (soccer) agent and lives in Guernsey (among other places)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mr. Bird will tell you where Guernsey is located|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the sea.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|mariner1: now EW have the 4@S game|pg||
nt|daman: maximum result for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me predict 4@S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: could be a pass out|pg||
nt|hedyg: S can open|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  can make 3!|pg||
nt|ady: 3 spades|pg||
nt|jwit: If they play strong no trumps it should go 1NT all pass|pg||
nt|dburn: not much in the way of high cards, mind|pg||
nt|lestergold: but this one less exciting because itb cant go off|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS could save in 5@C|pg||
nt|robbg: Now a much tamer deal.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a small profit available in 5c 2 off|pg||
nt|mariner1: it may be difficult for N to think save.........|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a big percentage in vulnerable saves at imps because they are an unmitigated disaster when phantom|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D Multi, weak with one major|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@S is down if N/S find the ruff in @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yet it's a hard pass for E with @SKQ98 support|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in this hand 4@S work better that grand texas at 4@D)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Although he has to pass, having already shown 15-17 HCP|pg||
nt|drg: not easy for them to get into the auction|pg||
nt|brolucius: As usual, we are playing the last two boards of the set (9 and 10) first, so we will have comparisons with the Closed Room by the time we reach 1/2/3.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: this might depend on the lead      good chances on heart lead|pg||
nt|jwit: They will have to scramble to try to find a seventh trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Sveinn got his debut with the national team in China last year|pg||
nt|dburn: this may let North into the auction cheaply, depending on methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW can make 4@H if they get there...... NS can save in 4@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|wollies: hard  to underlead  your  A here |pg||
nt|dburn: but either she didn't have a method or she didn't want to use it|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: sorry only 2@S|pg||
nt|dburn: but now she may feel she's being talked out of something...|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL may be penalty, if so 4N is takeout|pg||
nt|lestergold: a 19/21 hand here|pg||
nt|daman: probably a @S partscore for NS on this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like it with a 7-card suit, but ...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|daman: hrrrrmm      neother do I|pg||
nt|brolucius: A free bid of 2@C is enough now on the West cards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: N hand isnt worth more than a 2@s bid imo|pg||
nt|hedyg: bad suit and queens and jacks|pg||
nt|ady: n ow too high unless e/w dont cash their clubs|pg||
nt|robbg: Can they really make @h with a spade tap?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://icelandairopen.com/index.php?m=D3&id=M_OPENTEAMS2009&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2009  for leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: looks like a @d lead|pg||
nt|ady: this might slip through|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Martin Garvey|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Martin|pg||
nt|ady: certainly not clear cut for west to win and switch to a club|pg||
nt|thegarve: Hi all its going to be colder here in London than Iceland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://icelandairopen.com/index.php?m=D3&id=M_OPENTEAMS2009&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2009  for leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|ady: not m   uch chance   thought the play of the queen looks right to try for 7 trick|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: didn't think they would reach game|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: hi Martin|pg||
nt|hedyg: wish he had the 7@H still|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|thegarve: some Siberian front is going to freeze us|pg||
nt|thegarve: hi David|pg||
nt|lestergold: North will be very dissapointed to find how littlevalue his good looking hand has|pg||
nt|lestergold: in defence that is|pg||
nt|dburn: she would be even more disappointed to be referred to as "he"|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: well right the @S tap and the @H break would prevent a make|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Can you make game on any lead?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: now can make|pg||
nt|lestergold: just 1 trick in each side suit basically|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|thegarve: and Hi Hedy (who types far too fast for me)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|robbg: Fredin should get out for -100 here|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mariner1: this may reverse the gain from last board|pg||
nt|lestergold: well david how am i meant to know these things|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|jwit: Spade shift was costly.  Would have still beaten it with a diamond shift.|pg||
nt|bobh1: or a @c shift|pg||
nt|ady: can stiil establish  7th trick |pg||
nt|jwit: Yes the heart|pg||
nt|bobh1: @s shift gave up the tempo|pg||
nt|drg: can claim now|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: It may make little difference but I certainly would have led a heart rather than a trump from the East hand.|pg||
nt|jwit: Which should be ok since EW can make 4C|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|brolucius: Declarer did not risk the club finesse because he has noted that he can set up a trick in hearts.|pg||
nt|daman: looks like you can|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: he did not play @H!|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: another cblown it   had to play hearts first|pg||
nt|hedyg: now if E covers the Q@H he is down|pg||
nt|lestergold: A and another spade gives u a problem about thye heart losers|pg||
nt|daman: but the Qx of @Cs is onside to offset that defense|pg||

nt|lestergold: and the dims can be picked to|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but what if West inserts @CQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That gives declarer a losing option|pg||
nt|robbg: I have to admit I don't like a vul 1@s overcall with Fredin's hand, but it works out ok.|pg||
nt|jwit: I'm usually pretty conservative, but I don't mind it with the sixth spade.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|ady: even if he does not cover    still down|pg||
nt|daman: I win the Ace and play the Jack|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: assuming does not cover the 2nd heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: she may of course be a tom boy in which caase shed be flattered|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|hedyg: well if he covered just the 2nd @H..|pg||
nt|hedyg: gave him the contract twice|pg||
nt|dburn: well, may as well try for a diamond break and an overtrick|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hedyg: admittedly not easy for W to switch to @c any time|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my|pg||
nt|ady: this is the problem of 3rd & 5th leads|pg||
pc|h9|nt|daman: and pitch a @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s not that comfortable a looking contract- very hard to reach|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jwit: Overtrick now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think a diamond lead is the most troublesome|pg||
nt|daman: have 2 entries to set the rest of them up if need be|pg||

nt|dinos1: who wd stop N below 6? :)|pg||

nt|flash: last board now|pg||
nt|pbundy: IF 3@D was a transfer to 3@H - might have tried something other than 4@H at the next turn|pg||
nt|allanr44: last one this set|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: we will resume in 20 mins|pg||

nt|ahollan1: next set begins in about 30 minutes|pg||
nt|xenya: what do you bid as S now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: perhaps N's sequence promised a @H stopper -- 3@S looked like giving S a choice between 3N and 4@S|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: last board for today|pg||
nt|allanr44: fair comment|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: we will start again tomorrow 9.30 local time|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mrdct: next match starts in 30 mins from now|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: no right answer i guess|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Ish in the tank|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: for a long time unusual for Ish|pg||
nt|xenya: a spectator suggests a pass -- would have worked nicely here, but dangerous in my opinion|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: true....but he is thinking "hard"|pg||
nt|allanr44: you are there Traian  :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yes|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: you want to play double dummy games, i dont lead diamonds immediately|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i lead club trick 2|pg||
nt|by: now, EW needs a big swing|pg||
nt|by: 2@d shows longer @h|pg||
nt|gracelin: on board 24, when the 4-3 fit 6C is cold but we predicted to be a push board, EW bid to the 6-1 6H but made on DA lead.  |pg||
nt|dinos1: 5@d or 4@h|pg||

nt|ahollan1: check http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event  for times given locally for viewer|pg||
nt|barbyh: why do they bid 2 cl ahead of their longer d suit|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=art game force relay|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well....|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match now, and the end of our broadcast from Taipei|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many thanks again to Hao, our brilliant operator|pg||
nt|by: 2@s is not forcing, of course S will not let it go|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is the last board so I thk we can congratulate all BTU's for their excellent performance to win the top 3 position, especially to BTU-cheng, of course|pg||
nt|flash: although the hands didn't seem immensely challenging, these teams handled them well|pg||
nt|allanr44: not a lot to say.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: obvious the delay came from East -- so interesting Unauthorized Info possibilities if pull to 5@C|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|beauch: the swedes have been very successful with their relay bidding over many years|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D shows 5-7 zz w/ some singleton/void   -- sorry, I don't know "zz"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially finding out quickly if holding singleton/void|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Our matches in round 2 in about half an hour are: China B vs Norway and USA Hampson (Meckwell) vs Chinese Taipei|pg||
nt|barbyh: very interesting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told ZZ is what others call QPs [queen points] or AKQ points, where A-3, K=2, Q=1|pg||
nt|beauch: a standard 2/1 auction here - would not have much trouble either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Jacks go the way of the @C suit -- forgotten|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|by: 1N showed both majors, 2@c asked, 2@d showed longer @h, 2@s is non-forcing and invitational|pg||
nt|by: i think this shiould be over|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to all the commentators who guided us through the set|pg||
nt|gracelin: you should be happy, BY, Moscito win over the natural bidders. |pg||

nt|dinos1: no - for 5@d u need to ruff @c|pg||
nt|allanr44: I could echo some comments, the most concise being HA HA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: i strongly suspect that every bid other than 1@H has been alerted :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kiwibridge: only 8 H to cash|pg||
