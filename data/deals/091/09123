nt|swanson: The 1@D opening on the previous board was evidently because of a system.|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: south's regular partner is of course his twin brother (but both have played with dad on occasion)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H = 4+ spades|pg||

nt|swanson: I use transfers after an opponents double my one level opening bid or overcall.|pg||

nt|swanson: If response to the transfer is a bid of the suit at the one level, it is usually only three cards (could be four with an poor hand).|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: No, the poor hand jumps to 2@H|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|swanson: For the bidding it appears that the Hackett's use 2NT forcing and a jump shift as a 5-5 hand. |pg||

nt|xenya: N considering a @S switch?|pg||

nt|hedyg: orkc= option roman keycard|pg||

pc|sA|pg||

nt|swanson: Declarer ducks to retain control.  He would be in danger of losing a trump, two hearts and a club if he won the ace.|pg||
nt|kit: Good technique ducking the first heart.  Now if defense plays ace and a spade, the ace of hearts is still there.  If they don't, he can ruff a heart in dummy.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kit: It won't matter with the king of clubs onside, but if the king of clubs were offside it might have been necessary to duck the heart to make the contract.|pg||

pc|d7|nt|swanson: West might have shifted to spades. A second heart could hardly be necessary.|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer can just set up long heart and take 3 hearts, 2 spades, and 1 trick in each minor for 7 tricks I believe|pg||
nt|swanson: The @H10 on the second lead should indicate two hearts remaining (current count) with 109x remaining he would lead the 9.|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but then if declarer has 4 @H they are breaking and he does not need to ruff in dummy|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: if he pitches a @c declarer can ruff a @c and exit a a @h and weinstein is endplayed|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: South has no forcing heart raise over 2@C so has to use 4ths suit,  THis situation is even worse if North rebids 2@D (without goo partnership agrfeements).|pg||
nt|swanson: good|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: on both sides of the screen the possibility of 1435 has been suggested|pg||

pc|s4|nt|swanson: That seems right to me.|pg||
nt|kit: the approach he is taking will need to score all 8 trump tricks -- danger of overruffs, uppercuts, etc.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugrapha1: possibly there are hands where he might be in trouble - but i think he's always ok on the hand|pg||
