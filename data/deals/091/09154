nt|vugrapha4: we now replay the same 8 hands that we just saw|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: I was assigned here late in the first set, so the first few will be new to me.  I'm surprised at the phantom save the first time through|pg||
nt|idblu: the same phantom save...but undoubled ...good for a 5 imp pickup|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: But I guess it's just momentum|pg||

nt|lestergold: a thinish 4 spades availble here for N/S|pg||
nt|stewball: lots of chances|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard work with the r4/1 break|pg||
nt|dburn: sporting weak two bid at the other table, but North-South dealt with it easily enough|pg||
nt|drg: KQ@H doubleton helps a bit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C a fine spot although 3NT also makes on this layout|pg||
nt|jwit: I have never played bridge with Fredin, but did have the pleasure of playing golf with him.  For somebody who doesn't get out on the golf course very often, he is a terrific ...|pg||
nt|jwit: golfer.|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure seems like 4@H has play here......|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@S was a brave move by Ólafur in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: should be worth a few imps to e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c or indeed 3N on for NS|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: those heart pips in fredin's hand work quite hard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The N-S heart spots are just good enough to stop the suit|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps one should open 2@S instead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Like here|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially with a passed partner|pg||
mb|4H|nt|robbg: This 1@s overcall I don't understand at all! (I like the other one better!)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|hedyg: however maybe 2@s would show a 2suiter in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: was 2nd best     suppose they play attitude|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 3NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: North will make sure they get to 4@H (at least) now.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: This could be a nice swing for NS.  Heart to 10 now and will do quite well.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jwit: Although he isn't crazy about his spade holding on the auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: declarer finessed for the Q@H in Closed and went off|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Oh my|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     can make 9 tricks in spades  with fortunate lie of the black soft cards|pg||
nt|thegarve: If the hand was pure - opening 2@s is not a good idea -  2@S is ideal here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What does 2NT show since Ingimundur drove all the way to game|pg||
nt|drg: may well need to guess clubs if west can hold up the ace on the first round|pg||
nt|robbg: The 1@s overcall might have that effect.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: very optimistic by east on those values|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2NT would have been down too |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It most likely would|pg||
nt|hedyg: no direct entry to dummy for any finesse|pg||
nt|ady: I cant see that is a reason for east to bid  anything|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has played before that man|pg||
nt|dburn: here, though, North has done pretty well to respond to 1NT at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: superfially only three losers but ten winners are not that obvious|pg||
nt|stewball: i dont think its 100% to bid with that N hand n/v|pg||
nt|daman: Jon would have bid 3NT     Bob Hamman as well|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers suggesting 3N|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is not unreasonable when there is at least a three-card difference in the spade length.|pg||
nt|jwit: Kendrick can't afford to duck this.  He needs to give declarer an entry to dummy.|pg||
nt|jwit: Entry to hand I meant|pg||
nt|robbg: Won't be useful unless he wins and switches, unless Schifko is partial to a 1st round finesse.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: i agree i tend to pass a 15-17 nt with a poor 8 count|pg||
nt|lestergold: trump lead best here|pg||
nt|drg: reasonable to take a call holding spades and a couple of tens|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|brgpro: 5@h was lucky to make because the @h10 drops doubleton|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you know tarzan this can be fun but there are not many (rob helle for example does)|pg||
nt|brgpro: and, @dA was with doubleton|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - to make 5 @H need Ax in @D and 10x in @H|pg||
nt|brgpro: Axx was ok with 3 trumps, but the doubleton must be 10x|pg||
nt|bobholl: they will reach 4@H i 'm sure|pg||
nt|bridge_one: or Axx in @D with xxx in @H in the same hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: of cours in practice 3N makes ten tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: @SQ at trick 1 was obviously the only realistic chance|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: the heart position is very friendly indeed |pg||
nt|lestergold: what?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, it's very unsual to pull from game to a partscore|pg||
nt|daman: really weird|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Fredin fearing three small hearts opposite I suppose|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt know that at this level you can come out of an undoubled game into a pat score|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|bobholl: no 1 @C is 16+ 1@D 8-(i guess)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this kind of auction can do many IMP in long distance|pg||
nt|hedyg: are we sure 3@c is a stayman?|pg||
nt|daman: hard to believe that could happen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to David Burn|pg||
nt|dburn: hello|pg||
nt|daman: Hi David|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: what would he do if W did not have 4@Hs?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: might gain though as n/s +140     should only go down2|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Disa passed twice on the last board with 16 Miltons - she isn't the sort to pass four times running|pg||
nt|mariner1: pretty straight forward line needed...... and she is using it|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3744  Erik Sælensminde (known as "Silla" among friends)|pg||
nt|bobh1: best defense beats both|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think the ten of diamonds was a better shot in that suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: i hope im not being a results merchant|pg||
nt|drg: certainly works with the K9 doubleton|pg||
nt|lestergold: Fredin needs to learn to upgrade the powerful 876 sequence!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When did you last see that, David? Pulling from 3NT (undoubled) to 4@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi David u up early for a Sunday|pg||
nt|jwit: EW got awfully high on this one in the closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Declarer can pick up the clubs without a ruff.|pg||
nt|ady: 4S  for n/s|pg||
nt|drg: since west cannot afford to cover|pg||
nt|dburn: somewhat vexing for West at the other table to discover that leading from KQ in his partner's weak two bid allowed the contract to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: multi 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: only a part score hand    but the other room did not think so|pg||
nt|thegarve: the weak two classically pushed the opens to stretch , first with 2NT then 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s or 1@c?|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, but EW have a good save at 5 diamonds even with the bad trump break|pg||
nt|mariner1: tartan showing 5M and 4+ minor less than opening count|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thats one ofthe penalties of bidding with garbage|pg||
nt|stewball: sometimes called suicide 2 bids|pg||
nt|lestergold: the trump attack here was excellent|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that the heart game was made at every table but 1.|pg||
nt|jwit: I would pass over 1NT with the West hand|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bobh1: it is a style issue|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed it is|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D  a save for e/w|pg||
nt|brolucius: But he does not know that, so if the defenders cash their hearts (which they will) he may begin with two rounds of trumps followed by two rounds of clubs.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Muiderberg is very similar to Tartan|pg||
nt|mariner1: 17opposite a weak 8 here.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: without itmost linbes would have suceeded|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: http://icelandairopen.com/index.php?m=D3&id=M_OPENTEAMS2009&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2009  for leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D Multi, weak with one major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the garbage type|pg||
nt|bobh1: N has something in reserve for his 2@s bid|pg||
nt|dburn: didn't really see the auction - maybe it was supposed to be forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You saw the constructive weak 2 before|pg||
nt|drg: not much hope except for divining the spade position|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I would too,,,, looks more like 6|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bobholl: 1@S and all pass|pg||
nt|jwit: Rather aggressive 4D bid by South|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has nothing in reserve for his 4@D bid.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bridge_one: i don't agree the pass by south with 12 hcp and good figures|pg||
nt|robbg: A kibitzer asks why the duck at trick 1... It is often good technique to foil what declarer is trying to do. Here Schifko, basically known to hold Qx in @s was trying to force an ...|pg||
nt|robbg: entry to his hand, so Kendrick naturally (and unfortunately) refused to accomodate.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: nice swing for n/s here|pg||
nt|bobh1: can N stnd it?|pg||
nt|hedyg: not at all interested in A@D in pds hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has denied a heart control, on the face of it, so North should not advance.|pg||
nt|hedyg: and no 4@H bid|pg||
nt|jwit: If 4D was a stiff rather than a void, North has a powerhouse of a hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: i thing maybe he should have bid 2n or something to show a 3-card limit raise to begin with|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|brgpro: send my greetings to him|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: lol|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult when playing precision like with 13-15 NT|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would open the south hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: without an  impossible double dummy spade view this looks unmanageable|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: now too high     |pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@C should show a @H stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The double of 4@D must encourage a sacrifice because he will be on lead himself|pg||
nt|bobh1: altho 4 by 3 his hand is prime|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to blame North, though, with that massive hand (for a single raise) opposite a slam try. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 4@D overbid caused this|pg||
nt|bobh1: i blame him for making only a single raise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't|pg||
nt|ady: I think 4@D  looking for a slam optimistic  opposite a 2@S raise|pg||
nt|jwit: I agree David, especially if 4D was a singleton.  Obviously, not nearly as good opposite a void|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@C?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I blame 4@D, that is a wild overbid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes|pg||
nt|jwit: Agree totally Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The auction is in MOVIE|pg||
nt|robbg: This contract at least has a bit of play, but not on today's distribution.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: however they might hooks @S to make it........|pg||
nt|drg: can get 8 tricks for a push though|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: E had a chance to switch to @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: Fredin reasoning that S must have trumps and he has 3 tricks in hand|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: a hard work contract here|pg||
nt|dburn: I imagine it was intended as forcing, but it was a rather odd thing to do|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, an excellent double.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brgpro: but they play 12-15NT, so he will have to open 1NT and he is lack of controls|pg||
nt|bridge_one: QJ9  Q9xx A10x QJ10   medium cards  in all suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can make such doubles only when the auction makes it clear that the other side have limited values. If West had rebid 4@S, you might be more circumspect.|pg||
nt|jwit: Best defense might beat this 3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|brolucius: An awful sequence.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jwit: Good point David|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|hedyg: so did W.........|pg||
nt|hedyg: did he really duck the Q@H?|pg||
nt|jwit: From North's point of view, partner could easily have something like  AKJxxx  Ax x KQJx.  Surely that wouldn't be asking for too much for a 4D bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: much too much work to do with the hearts being established next time opps are in|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably get home by way of 4hearts two dims 2 clubs and a ruff in the short heart hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: however 2s was due for a few off|pg||
nt|daman: yes    should reel this one in|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|drg: actually, a club up now and then diamonds|pg||
nt|drg: the minors lay very friendly|pg||
nt|dburn: this is cold, isn't it?|pg||
nt|drg: south can't afford to rise because of the Qx@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: another @S pressures S|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|lestergold: this looks like a lucky position indeed|pg||
nt|drg: not cold anymore|pg||
nt|dburn: that may not have been best, though|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he finds it |pg||
nt|lestergold: but not much else to try|pg||
nt|drg: it was his only legit shot|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: How you can envisage slam with that hand opposite a single raise is simply unbelievable|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: declarer needed to pitch a club and keep that diamond|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brgpro: this defence wont hurt|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bobholl: claim for 3 made|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bobh1: change N's heart and diamond holdings and you are getting there|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, 6@C was not the best. He must have said to himself: 'I denied a heart control, so partner must have one.' |pg||
nt|bobh1: good reasonin|pg||
nt|bobh1: g|pg||
nt|hedyg: imo 5@C MUST be @H control|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he didnt keep his dim|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|hedyg: with*|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|lestergold: in practice two ruffs in the short trump hand and 3 trumps in the dummy|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|bobh1: as good as N's hand was he had a pass over 4@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is difficult for North, who presumably knows that his partner's bidding may not be classical.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it  wont make very often|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mariner1: if this makes 4 the DBL costs 2 imps,,, if set one it gains 1 imp... the payoff is -300|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: or -500 which are 5 and 7 imp gains|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: south should just have bid 4@s   and reckon sometimes even that might be too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: so now off 2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: no a wheel came off|pg||
nt|jwit: Will actually be 800 now|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
mc|5|nt|brolucius: The point that Jon and Rob made earlier (that West - with a QJ bare and a Q-x-x - was not worth a game try) has been proved to be a good one. |pg||

nt|bobh1: he has to . . . otherwise cue-bidding serves no purpose|pg||
nt|jwit: I don't blame North for bidding over 4S.  There are just too many hands partner could have for a 4D bid, that slam will be cold|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if he can bid 4@D with that hand, he might also bypass a heart cue next because he overbid|pg||
nt|brolucius: The correct way to play the clubs is king and then the ace, exposing the need for a finesse when West has a singleton honour.|pg||
mb|p|nt|drg: E/W seem to have overbid a bit in the other room here|pg||

nt|brolucius: East could not risk a double with only one heart. Correctly, he passes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: not sure but beter than 5-7 (double)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D I understand, 3@D I don't|pg||
nt|jwit: Especially vul|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: it looks awful but here it has probabkly pushed e/w overboard mind u woulodnt have if east had overcalled a nt|pg||
nt|dburn: but if partner is in the habit of overcalling 2@d on this kind of thing, that's a risky strategy|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is becoming ugly|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S might not get DBL'd|pg||
nt|robbg: Here is trick 8, sort of.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bridge_one: i suppose 1Nt =  3/4 control with stop in @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@C like stayman|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 nt will make also and with 2 aces missing this is the kind of hand r'dam will like :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt work only for J in @D in the dummy to re-enter !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner did see that you overcalled at the 2-level, vulnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S at green might bid one more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S playing well|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3c not playing well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: even if declarer misguesses hearts|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobh1: he should be able to hold this to -500, no great disaster|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://icelandairopen.com/index.php?m=D3&id=M_OPENTEAMS2009&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2009  for leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the bid removes very little space. Nothing much going for it.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i would not dream of overcalling at the two level vulnerable with k empty to 5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brgpro: telling u guys a secret, i dont like to play against de wijs muller....they are too fast for me|pg||
nt|ady: might make an overtrick |pg||
nt|dburn: I imagine South will double it, if it gets bid|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: need to play 9@H  for best result|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont see how 9@H can cost|pg||
nt|ady: can still make 10 tricks on the spade lay|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bridge_one: N/S are playing  TARZAN PRECISION (note by a kibitz) - played also by jansma/verhees |pg||
nt|drg: double based on the sound of the auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: im a beliebver in good suits for this bid never mind the point couint|pg||
nt|drg: west shown weakness and east doesn't have spade support|pg||
nt|dburn: still, declarer may escape for down one|pg||
nt|lestergold: but they cant double|pg||
nt|robbg: Now a @d underlead is necessary|pg||
nt|brolucius: A kibitzer suggests that 4@H might make. So, an inexperienced player who doubled on the East hand and found his partner jumping to 4@H might have been rewarded.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|stewball: i wonder why S dbld 4@s but not 3nt|pg||
nt|drg: seems the most likely result|pg||
nt|mariner1: there is a "SLIM" chance of making...........|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the root of the eveil was that oveercall- when 1nt just about expresses the hand|pg||
nt|dburn: North-South may not realise, on this bidding, that they should be attacking diamonds of all things|pg||
nt|mariner1: the small @H probably ends it though|pg||
nt|lestergold: i c that they got away with a making nt in the closed room|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 500     a small loss for e/w|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, @H10 was an unlucky lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzgq: Don't be too sarcastic Jack :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: jansma verhees play more like polish :) not tarzan .|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 800|pg||
nt|jwit: Might hold it to 500 Roland.  Might get to ruff a heart in hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think their diamonds will run away|pg||
nt|lestergold: must lose 2h dim and 2 spades|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: of course they will - West has a pitch on a heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: ??|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c back tests declarer|pg||
nt|drg: south doesn't have an easy play to trick 2 after the duck|pg||
nt|mariner1: not my lead back though'|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a club might run away now|pg||
nt|drg: and the ruffing heart finesse along the way to deal with a diamond|pg||
nt|drg: ruff the other club|pg||
nt|mariner1: true S has no great return to be honest|pg||
nt|drg: and 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobholl: good lead when strong hand in S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, but in TARZAN can find also sequence by jansma/verhees |pg||
nt|drg: when spades break and A@D onside along with the K@C|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: How will you score @D6?|pg||
nt|jwit: Or a club|pg||
nt|ady: now might be more    should have played a c lub before the diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: might as well put the queen on it - can't really help to duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: chance for west to steal a horrible contract but missed it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: would have to guess the heart position though in South wins first sspade and plays a 2nd heart|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brgpro: claim and NEXT|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: need a @c back now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it's 500 again, Hauge should have won|pg||
nt|ady: play a clun immediately    then make the low trump by ruffing a club|pg||
nt|drg: ducking gives no hope|pg||
nt|stewball: to say nothing of it being pointless|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: now an easy 10|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: How do you get to dummy to ruff a club?|pg||
nt|lestergold: ducking seemed misere|pg||
nt|lestergold: and need to be allowed to ruff 4th heart in dummy but hes drawing trumops so likely 2 off|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobholl: once we played muller 4boards in 22  minutes almost a record :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: with a ladder|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dburn: I don't understand this line at all|pg||
nt|mariner1: counting your losers leads to playing the Q@C, only way to remove a loser is if it wins|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the dims have not run away surprisingly enuf!|pg||
nt|drg: started well at trick 1, but since then|pg||

nt|idblu: yes...but that is too unilateral a position to take in a team game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idblu: can we assume the score is therefore 22-13?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: australia leading 22-13|pg||
nt|idblu: typing while u posted :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D!|nt|othered1: It was once called "Goren" or standard, and it would have been bidding that was a unilateral action.  Times change.  Efficacy of changes are another story.|pg||
mb|d!|an|values|mb|p|nt|idblu: spoils go to the bidders these days...180 degrees from the 40's and 50's|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d|an|takeout|nt|lestergold: e/w have borderline game values in hts or even no trumps but no easy contract- i ear 4h doomed if they reach it|pg||
nt|idblu: what were the results of the 1st matches?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: guess west's auction is "stayman" with @S stopper|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|idblu: yes...appears that way|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well maybe 4h with inspired play may make|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|idblu: if ducks a few @D's|pg||
nt|lestergold: even ruffing a spade in dummy is now hazardous|pg||
nt|idblu: will have to guess and drwa 3 rds of trumps|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|othered1: GIB would lead @C to 9, then guess @H.  But east is a live declarer|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|idblu: best out a @H..anything else lets him make|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this picks up the club|pg||
nt|idblu: OK now if guesses @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: enuf tricks now if he clears  hts now|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt need dims|pg||
nt|idblu: 2 way guess for the Lady|pg||
nt|lestergold: the club trick in the bag has helped enormously|pg||
nt|idblu: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: trouble is why would he play for the heart q in the long spade hand?|pg||
nt|idblu: true...unless he plays him to have points for his bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he will probably read south for a doubleton club but that still does not tell him how the red suit cards are distributed|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone|pg||
nt|idblu: the other Ed:)|pg||
nt|idblu: ge Ed :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is plenty of room for south to have his bid without the q of hearts|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Fred!|pg||
nt|idblu: @D and @S points enuff|pg||
nt|lestergold: eggsactly|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: i would not like tlo be in his tabnk right now the longer i think in these situations the more likely i get it wrong!|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: Interesting that east chose NT over @H, probably concerned that west had a slow @S stopper (Qxx?) and @S ruffs would be out in @H|pg||
pc|h9|nt|idblu: the other room bid 4@H effortlessly|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: and he is like me so i sympathise|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|idblu: wrong here as well on the @H guess|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h8|pg||
nt|othered1: does south's description -- intermediate -- make it more likely he had @HQ?|pg||
nt|idblu: may have @D cards plus @S/@D distribution|pg||
nt|idblu: as well as @CA|pg||
nt|othered1: He may.  But in a vacuum, what are your probabilities?|pg||
nt|idblu: toss a coin|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s2|pc|c6|nt|idblu: eventually played for the Q over the J :)|pg||
nt|idblu: I don't think you can logically say he has the Q or doesn't have it|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|othered1: You know 8 of south's cards (assuming 6@S) and 6 of north's, but south's bid is another factor.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|hJ|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dK|mc|9|nt|lestergold: i think on the info he had it was probably with the odds|pg||
nt|idblu: good result for NS...possible big pickup|pg||
pg||
qx|c36|st||md|2SQJ9752HQ76DAQCA4,SA3HKJ52D632CJ652,S86H94DJT984CT873,SKT4HAT83DK75CKQ9|sv|b|nt|hedyg: 9@H and @s were the best cards he had!, ignored them both|pg||
nt|jwit: It will be hard for defense not to give declarer a heart ruff or club ruff or set up a spade trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but they can manage|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's probably worth looking at that one again, with DF or GIB, to see how the defenders can force 800.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2 IMPs is a cheap price for what seemed to be a very dubious 3@D from East.|pg||
nt|jwit: Indeed David|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://icelandairopen.com/index.php?m=D3&id=M_OPENTEAMS2009&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2009|pg||
nt|mariner1: for leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|drg: an odd push|pg||
nt|lestergold: card play by west on  this one below par|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N certainly has play here.........|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4 being played in the closed room. West is in 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After North showed 5-5 in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N might be better than 4@H here,,,, though 4@H has play|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve: Forget honour cards, its 9s that count|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: sometimes :)|pg||
nt|thegarve: might buy it in 3@c|pg||
nt|dburn: the same might be said of East at the other table on this one - how do you go down in 3NT?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4S a reasonable conmtract to reach unfortunat lie of cards|pg||
nt|jwit: 4H most likely contract.  Should fail|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: many would make that bid  |pg||
mb|2S!|an|intermediate|nt|bobh1: dont see this as a weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|jwit: This board rates to be a push|pg||
nt|mariner1: hard to dbl hook @H twice|pg||
nt|lestergold: over ruffs abound|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H is a sound spade raise|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|hedyg: pass?|pg||
nt|lestergold: with the favourable lie of the hearts it is difficult to see|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 23 pt 3N in other room   may well fail   even on a club lead through difficult communication    would need to play a low diamond from hand |pg||
nt|thegarve: Pass was clearcut|pg||
nt|drg: play for A@S onside instead of J@H?|pg||
nt|drg: this auction doesn't seem possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is this?|pg||
nt|mariner1: one way to avoid 3N :)|pg||
nt|dburn: this may or may not be a strong club based auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: playing precision so at most 15 in E|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|bobh1: isnt it NS's hand in @s's?|pg||
nt|jwit: Don't think they will be able to compete high enough Bob|pg||
nt|bobh1: double now|pg||
nt|stewball: according to the play record N pitched down to dbl KJ@h |pg||
nt|stewball: and then the record stops|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well it will ceertainly gain imps today!|pg||
nt|jwit: Don't like that double at all with subminimum values, length in opponents suit, and shortness in partner's suit.|pg||
nt|robbg: Which top honor? Schifko was on a different page or improvising.|pg||
nt|mariner1: and a very weak @S suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North was close to 1NT over the double. That would have allowed South to bid 2@S.|pg||
mb|3S|an|4!H and !S stop|nt|hedyg: 3 level t/o doubles are not 7 HCPs, partner should have 10+ so pass looked fine|pg||
nt|ady: dangerous 3@C bid vuln|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps, but there seems to be some doubt as to the actual result at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: will he guess this|pg||
nt|lestergold: i doubt it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jón will never guess it|pg||
mb|p|nt|robbg: I don't like the neg x either but find it less odious than the 1@s overcalls we have seen.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would not double either, but many players seem to like to show the spades when they hold them (as we have already seen in this set).|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes J is not usually considered a top honor........|pg||
mb|3N|nt|daman: quite a lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: hes short of side suit tricks sohe has to play with the odds|pg||
nt|jwit: Great conservative judgement by Schifko, at least on this actual hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that 3NT has been bid three times and always made. Everyone has failed who bid the heart game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: the other doubleton best lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: duck...................|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Expected the unexpected from Fredin|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hes going to lose a heart two dims and at least one overruff surelt|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i see it made in t'other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Made in the other room on @HK lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: ah hah|pg||
nt|lestergold: on eup for Fredin he needs one this session|pg||
nt|lestergold: one up i mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: On a very sunny day N-S might make 4@S.|pg||
nt|lestergold: if he takes the double hook now, 11 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thos contract aint easy double dummy|pg||
nt|mariner1: S might have rebid 2@D to show more|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jwit: I agree Rob|pg||
nt|robbg: I think what happened here is that Schifko thought he was showing values with the xx, so he thought 2@h was fully descriptive.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: 1 reason to duck the lead is not having a good exit card|pg||
nt|hedyg: if S knew that N has the 2 red queens..|pg||
nt|lestergold: send it to darwin David?|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, at double dummy the play is fairly straightforward - declarer can even recover from his misguess at trick one|pg||
nt|dburn: but at the table, I'd be pretty surprised if he makes it|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes but even in a thunderstorm they will make 3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobholl: east is placed again i think :) but not easy to play|pg||
nt|brolucius: You might redouble and then say 2@H when you held only two hearts. That's the problem.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jwit: Though conservatism was right here as long as they were going to play hearts rather than no trump, and no trump was extremely unlikely on this auction|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mariner1: no dbl now|pg||
nt|daman: @C spots are favo(u)rable if he playes it properly|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: well there is a club pin for tyhe double dummy enthusiasts|pg||
nt|lestergold: and carefully draw two rounds of truimps with the ace and queen but surely taht is hugh darwin territory|pg||
nt|dburn: that will not work|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to get back to hand so doesnt work|pg||
nt|dburn: he needs at some point to run both @s10 and @cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: in any case this chicken isnt going to fight for  Jon|pg||
nt|dburn: which is why I will be rather surprised if he makes it|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume this is a serious tank|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he does, he is too good to play against|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although a few BBO'ers would do it in their sleep, sadly|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is too good isnt he but even he wont mke this one|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: and now brown cow?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dburn: now nothing - the best he can hope for is to avoid down two|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wonder what an immediate 2@S by South would have meant.|pg||
nt|lestergold: a perfetly reasonable way to playa 1 heart contract|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bridge_one: the overcall by East help - however they arn't other line to play ...|pg||
nt|bobh1: i assume weak|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bridge_one: the best return|pg||
nt|ady: nice switch|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: i like immediate 2@s with a passed pd|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: but a lot less than 11 tricks!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: K@H and then the @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: and then only just made|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobholl: uo to 9 tricks now and 10 ??|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K in @H np for the declarer - keep with the ace and play @H having 2 discards over J10 in @H|pg||
nt|brgpro: declarer played it wrongly....in with the 3rd trump in dummy, he shd have ran the @hJ|pg||
nt|brgpro: that line works with the @cA drops 3rd and double finesse in @h works|pg||
pc|h9|nt|thegarve: @H switch by default |pg||
nt|hedyg: W could have taken that Q@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: Then perhaps he was OK for that bid. Not good that they sold out to 2@C at both tables.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well good thing they were not higher in @H|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|ady: down 2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: probably weaker     maybe a trusting partner should have competed with 2! after 2@C passed to him|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

pc|s5|pc|d2|nt|dburn: he managed|pg||

nt|othered1: I like 2@H (in a standard framework) rather than the other room's 1N,  but it is a matter of partnership.|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@H  must be right....no @C points and 5 in @H|pg||
nt|othered1: west may think of saving in 5@C, but if NS bid on may not find the @C lead|pg||

nt|dburn: mind you, even with @hK lead declarer at the other table did pretty well to get home|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bobholl: sry have to leave(tya) but my hopes for vorden are very low |pg||
nt|Walddk2: And now on to the 7% hand, the chance of both sides having 20 hcp|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S makes, 5@D makes|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: double?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double is fine if you play ELC|pg||
nt|brolucius: Redouble is normal on the South cards and then West can say 2@S.|pg||
nt|hedyg: double OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Equal Level Conversion|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most of the field played in 4@H. I suppose we should congratulate N-S here for staying low, but I don;t think South quite showed his hand in support of hearts.|pg||
nt|jwit: This should be a flat 4H|pg||
nt|mariner1: possible slam here with no @D lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: not that they should be in slam|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dburn: better play 6@d by East, though|pg||
nt|stewball: chunky prempt|pg||
nt|mariner1: forget 6@D off an entry|pg||
nt|lestergold: he needs enuf entries to ruff out the spade k and enjoy the spades to make 56d playe by East of course |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 1 entry short of 6@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think he has them|pg||
nt|dburn: at this rate, he'll be doing well to get to game|pg||
nt|drg: must be something to 3@S, that can't be a w/r preempt|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: seems to be a forcing NT|pg||
nt|ady: pzrft score again    n/s should make 1NT   but e/w managed to buy the contract in 1NT in other room  a save |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They could well end up in a 4-2 fit here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like double much|pg||
nt|hedyg: W's partners never bid @d on his t/o doubles?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double is a take-out of hearts|pg||
nt|jwit: Double ok if you play same level conversions.  Will actually work well here.|pg||
nt|jwit: Diamond lead stands out however|pg||
mb|2H|nt|thegarve: Double is better against a strong NT than a weak NT base|pg||
nt|ady: aggressive by west  if eastg is going to take out to diamonds with a  weak hand|pg||
nt|ady: east ereally has enough to pass|pg||
mb|d|nt|brgpro: 4@s is a lucky make with no entry in dummy to take the trump finesse and both @h honors on side|pg||
nt|thegarve: some pairs like to defend and take a plus - West on the last hand showed that he preferred to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not promising extras when you pull clubs to diamonds to show S + D|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s= 1NT?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes its a trappy hand David|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he had a clue from the auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: so does not bidding it :)|pg||
mb|r|nt|ady: this will be bad for e/w  especcially on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|thegarve: the double should help to find a @s lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: what does 3s mean surely notm a standard preempt much too good a hand|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: West will lead a top spade I suppose|pg||
nt|ady: at what level if there is a 2 or 3@H bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: way too strong for 3@S for me....... W must have seen them before :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4s isthe sensible spot on these cards|pg||
nt|dburn: it is possible that 3@s was part of the system, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: so he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: That could prove to be a major swing to 't Onstein, if Muller passes|pg||
nt|brgpro: i remember once in a big tournament in NED. years ago....someone led a trump from xxx when the opps reached 7@s. the book say so what can go wrong? pd had Kx and dummy was void..|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Or not, sorry, thinking error :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: no big deal, 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I was thinking 500+420|pg||
nt|hedyg: dont see how they beat this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe both of you thought East was on lead|pg||
nt|robbg: Schifko has to carry on, I would think.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jwit: Still should apply Ady|pg||
nt|lestergold: a nice easy one for us not much to say infrangible 4S|pg||
nt|daman: this is a piano hand   time to refill my coffee|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South has a huge hand in general, but is worried about the x-x-x in diamonds.|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is a very strong 2@H call,,,,,,|pg||
nt|robbg: I hope I do better with my Super Bowl pick!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now that they have stopped in 3@H it will be good tactics for West to avoid the diamond lead.|pg||
nt|mariner1: and that is?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: Got to be Arizona, since he lives there|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: pick the q for an overtrick|pg||
nt|robbg: I can't conceive of pass with Schifko's hand, given that 2NT is an invitation!|pg||
nt|robbg: Go Cards!|pg||
nt|jwit: I agree with you on not passing Robb, not on Arizona lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north ant givepartner a dim ruff and cash two hearts she  can only do one or the other|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: what is E thinking about? 5@s?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If West knew that South's 1@S was artificial then perhaps he should have bid 2@S instead of doubling. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: sorry    contract played by west|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: do we know if NS play transfer bids over double?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4 if need be. If partner really bids 4@C over 3@H, he must have some values|pg||
nt|bobh1: the 2@s bid stole the board|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brgpro: can't be right...|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: what am i talking about only two spades in the soputh hand]|pg||
nt|dburn: odd sort of play, that - why go against the odds?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: i would have played @h after the A@S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: I understand   but they may be in some difficulty at the 4 levedl if west has just got 6 clubs |pg||
nt|lestergold: so better play hearts now to hold to 4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mariner1: you are still right, can't do both :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well not the other|pg||
nt|lestergold: logically i am right|pg||
nt|lestergold: but intellectually im an idiot|pg||
nt|mariner1: or merely confuzed|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: And if he has no values, he has 7 clubs|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|jwit: I think I would have actually bid 2S rather than double with West hand with 5 spades.|pg||
nt|mariner1: cornfuzed as we said in the South|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I guess Fredin didn't get where he is today by making normal plays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fredin likes the sublime|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobh1: was the 2@s bid alerted?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He won't bid 4@C on Qxxxxx and out|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobh1: i meant the 1@s bid?|pg||
nt|ady: he can haved some values    but not expecting a singleton club with pard|pg||
nt|brolucius: Equal Level Conversion is a fair idea but I don't get the impression that many people play it.|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|othered1: Good-bad michaels and this one is within the range.  North has his game bid |pg||
nt|lestergold: found his partner with the earth and still has to be careful to make|pg||
nt|idblu: I do....but what if they time out to double you along the way|pg||

nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe not in Sussex|pg||
nt|hedyg: only when they have the other major and @ds :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: hot tea for me please :)|pg||
nt|dburn: remarkable effort to get to 3NT on these cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart lead on the last hand against a suit contract i cant remember seeing anytghing like it but it sure fmurdered a giant|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Is there a Chandlers Ford in Sussex now?|pg||
nt|ady: many would bid 2@S with the west hand   as natural   and double with only 4 spades|pg||
nt|jwit: This board should surely be flat, though they may play 4S making 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, but I don't think they play ELC in Sussex either|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, it is an instructive mistake - to look only at the diamonds when the rest of his hand was shouting 'Bid game!'|pg||
nt|robbg: Of all the unlikely things that happened in 2008, the Cards winning the NFC is possibly the unlikliest!|pg||
nt|mariner1: now a classic 3N NS|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|Walddk2: I know Chandler's Ford is in Hampshire|pg||
nt|lestergold: and even more remarkeable to make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: If NS manage to stay out of slam here, the match will be all but sealed|pg||
nt|dburn: and if the sequence in the Open room is correct, the bidding was indeed remarkable|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D showing multi or a weak major|pg||
mb|2N!|an|asks which minor|mb|3C|nt|brgpro: but the problem is that 6@h doesnt make....|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yup, @DK offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: And the @DT missing :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 5@S |pg||
nt|hedyg: on their way to @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well the more expected contract|pg||
nt|dburn: Grue no doubt in experimental mode having put a cold game on the floor earllier in proceedings|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: Btw, for all those who don't know, there's a screen dividing SW and NE. That forces me to wait for the tray to go through to enter biddings.|pg||
nt|mariner1: so this will be good for Shell since they missed their game EW|pg||
mb|3H|an|!|nt|Walddk2: 1@C strong, 1@D not strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: This is the only table of 38 where game was not reached!|pg||
mb|p|nt|thegarve: West has a 2.5@s rebid|pg||
nt|drg: managed to create his swing|pg||
nt|drg: this time in his favour|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: wonder how they held 3n to 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Closed played very fast and are finished|pg||
nt|dburn: not to argue with success, but I am not sure of the need for doing that sort of thing - sure, Grue is havign a shocker of a set, but he has team-mates|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jwit: 3NT is actually a superior contract on these cards.  |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2 aces out and @d lead?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: off to the best lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Closed S opened a more reasonable (to me) 1@H on last board|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: will have to guess heart position    |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|hedyg: can make, but likely wont|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|jwit: How did we get past 3NT here?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|brgpro: they play reversed, pass=ask pd to X and X would have asked pd to act|pg||
nt|lestergold: will probably now just make 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless north opens clubs|pg||
nt|robbg: Obviously 2NT was forcing. Not everybody plays it that way. But there is something wrong (IMO) with a system that requires you to get beyond 3NT to describe a balanced 16.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bobh1: yep that would do it . . . so 4@s is the better contract|pg||
nt|jwit: 4S could be beaten with some outlandish distributions.  Can't touch 3NT with a crowbar|pg||
nt|lestergold: will probably make this by picking the dims up along with favourable position of the heart ace|pg||
nt|mariner1: this one getting away some|pg||
nt|brolucius: North is being very ambitious (to use a polite word) with his 4-3-3-3 shape opposite a weak NT.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|jwit: Agree 100% David|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree he is being polite :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing the weak 1NT, it would go 1NT - 3NT. You would then have more energy left for the play.|pg||
nt|robbg: It seems to me that you should either play a direct 3NT as 16-17 or so, or an inverted raise followed by a jump to 3NT as 16-17.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzgq: Bertens: "Another sad display"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q in @D would be more clear|pg||
nt|thegarve: it is worth discussing whteher to use 2@C as a potential 2.5@s rebid|pg||
nt|ady: about 50-50 Hedy     guess heart will make|pg||
nt|lestergold: well south musnt continue clubs|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: best|pg||
nt|robbg: but they haven't made 4@s yet.|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|hedyg: can guess @s as well|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ady: yes     as it happens  in 3NT  it must be right to play clubs first as that might bring in enough tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://icelandairopen.com/index.php?m=D3&id=M_OPENTEAMS2009&iid=IF_OPENTEAMS2009|pg||
nt|mariner1: for leaderboard and running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|mariner1: and the 4@H was bid on 5 in Closed so the skunk is over|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bobh1: that's true; 4@s is better at mps but 3n at imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Federer-Nadal: 5-7 6-3 6-6 |pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: There you go again; the spectacular|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DQ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many players, probably most, would raise 1NT to 3NT with North's 4-3-3-3 shape. As happened at the other table.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It doesn't always work for him|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|hedyg: no need to guess @H anymore|pg||
nt|brolucius: They seem to have introduced spades only on the 9th bid of the auction. Very strange.|pg||
nt|robbg: No justice on board 4. Fredin took 7 tricks in @h and won 3 IMPS from a counterpart who took 9 tricksin @h!|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: Again, however, east has reason to be pushy and th edouble of 2@C isn't a negative factor|pg||

nt|brolucius: David Greenwood will approve, but for those of us who understand the apostrophe...|pg||
nt|ady: pass for me|pg||
nt|jwit: I would pass as well with weak suit|pg||
nt|bobh1: not so sure i like 3@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's really strange that apostrophe has no apostrophé|pg||
nt|brolucius: I would pass on the West cards, but it is tempting to bid. They say you should not bid 'weak over weak'.|pg||
nt|hedyg: partner has the right to expect more|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6NT from East?!|pg||
nt|daman: we'll see if EW can stop below game|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|vugraphzgq: Interesting 3NT with a meager @H stop|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this 3Nt is to play (gambling with K singleton in @h)|pg||
nt|brgpro: ok guys, i am sure we will know muller's decision by tomorrow morning|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Haha, but he has to bring his average speed down, he's played extraordinary fast the first couple of boards.|pg||
nt|drg: another remarkable auction in the other room|pg||
mb|d|an|!c suit|nt|Walddk2: I dobt it, and you know, sometimes @SK is onside after the opening|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: *doubt|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to |pg||
nt|daman: put on the brakes|pg||
nt|robbg: Definitely a mental mistake.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: to me voids are values, especially in their known suit|pg||
nt|jwit: 3H vulnerable is asking for trouble in my opinion on that suit and no source of tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h looks the limit in a suit contract but N//S can make about 3 C|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers were asking about 9@D after Q@C win,,, to set the hand|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bridge_one: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@C is daisy-picking. What did he expect to get in return?|pg||
nt|brolucius: perhaps this auction will persuade us all not to bid on a hand like West's in the future.|pg||
nt|jwit: Of course when partner has 20HCPs lol|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6-4 is nice, having 4@s's is nice; lot's of reasons to bid|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT a very poor contract    if in a slam  should be in a red suit    thought diamonds split badly|pg||
nt|jwit: If you like going for big numbers from time to time Bob|pg||
mb|4S|nt|thegarve: East is worth a raise with a singleton @C|pg||
nt|hedyg: kickback?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart bid ensures the killing lead against 4|pg||
nt|daman: bravo|pg||
nt|lestergold: but east has respected his partners minimum response tohis nenquiry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't it a lucky rather than a good stop, George?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: in this situation A in @H is obliged ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Very unlucky @C break here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cue bid I assume|pg||
nt|hedyg: guess not|pg||
nt|brolucius: West wisely decides not to cue-bid the club void on his sub-sub-minimum hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: West's 3@S did not do justice to his support. He should have bid 3@H.|pg||
nt|robbg: As well they should, a mental error as I said.|pg||
mb|p|pc|c8|nt|brgpro: well. the first sight of dummy huub thought his gambling worked.....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: odd-ur|pg||
nt|bobh1: wisely . . . except slam is cold|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What if a club control is all partner needs?|pg||
nt|ady: what does east expect pard to do with no diamond control  if he has got a bit more?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could well have K@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: on board 6 the Closed are in 3N, a much easier spot|pg||
nt|robbg: I agree completely David.|pg||
nt|jwit: Good contract here.  Trump lead would have been best, but with diamonds behaving, contract is cold.|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session is scheduled for 52 minutes from now -|pg||

nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brgpro: he was expecting 6@c 1@h and 2@s....|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: De Wijs: "I won't signal too enthusiastically :)"|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky for them he didnt|pg||
nt|drg: needed a red suit lead to set this|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 15 points with tenace acesless combos in the minors is not a mandatory raise to game of a min weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|daman: you can look at it 2 ways     lucky or clever|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|ady: but will still sign off with no diamond control|pg||
pc|h8|nt|brolucius: You can't expect the red-suit breaks that you need after a 3@C opening. |pg||
nt|drg: so won't be much of a swing|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: 1N not a great spot|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|hedyg: now @H|pg||
nt|thegarve: Maybe West has a four-Leif clover|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|dburn: I don't imagine many people would actually have led a heart rather than a spade against 1NT passed out, but it would have worked rather well|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: a crystal ball? is that what it is called?|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers commenting on the 1N here..... in China and much of the East they bid 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: and 2 N and overcall 1N with stiffs regularly so a little shape is becoming common|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|c5|nt|drg: balancing on the east hand seems pretty normal|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Oddur's brother is playing in the other room...Hrólfur Hjaltason|pg||
nt|jwit: I wouldn't swim a river of crocodiles to be in a slam on the combined EW cards, especially with a vulnerable 3C bid from South.  4-1 trumps and you have a ton of work to do|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h2|nt|drg: inviting game on it was a bit of a stretch|pg||
nt|drg: in the other room|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|othered1: Funny -- no matter who preempts, south bids 3N on his 16 count.  And the preempt has the same effect here.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|idblu: sometimes the preempt is like waving a red flag to a bull|pg||

nt|hedyg: of course W would have raised 3@s to 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good one Martin, the trouble is that Leif is not pronounced "leaf", more like "layph"|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Leifur Heppni (Leifur the lucky) the viking that found America long befor Columbus|pg||
nt|brolucius: How much extra would you need in the West hand before you would swim a river of crocodiles?|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board now |pg||
nt|jwit: He doesn't have extras.  He has a super sub minimum for a 3H bid, despite distribution.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to Mike, George and David for sublime commentary (I like that word)|pg||
nt|lestergold: do i see a double by Schifko?|pg||
nt|daman: S is making his partner pay a big price for competing      probably hoping he has gthe @H Ace|pg||

nt|brolucius: Again Kendrick is determined to let partner know of the good spades.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: 4@S   makes    but hard to reach unless north decides to transfer with 3@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: HI Al :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes its a wondeful service to all bridge fanatics|pg||
nt|drg: not my choice|pg||

nt|wollies: hi folks |pg||
nt|hedyg: only bid 7+ card suits?|pg||
nt|robbg: Is there any nation in the world that has more good bridge per capita than Iceland?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: so NS should pickup a few more here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s looks like no problem with lie of dims friendly|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|dburn: striped-tailed ape, since East-West can in fact make a slam, but...|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|brgpro: hoi mart|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hello Mart|pg||
nt|wollies: Hi Jack |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: EW seem to have copied the NS bidding system here :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: It looks like a relay auction|pg||
nt|brgpro: well...this is not an easy 6NT to reach...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but this 3NT can be a dangerous bid - now need 4@C by west to no lose the slam|pg||
nt|brgpro: westra made a very aggressive 3@c jump bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Today it seems you can make 12 tricks with two aces missing, and 13 with one ace missing :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would prefere 3@D by west over 2@H|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes, we can often finesse one of the Aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I would've bid 3@C too, but I'm a junior :) Nice distr. imo|pg||
nt|brgpro: but 3@c is GF....not my choice though|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@D by East, you mean?|pg||
nt|wollies: hard to reach now I think |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: If they do indeed miss it, the match is locked|pg||
nt|brgpro: is it open now??|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@S is the more probable slam to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Hardly :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT showing fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s would deny|pg||
nt|bobh1: i like S's 3n bid--a source of tricks and secure @c stopper|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it was interesting, and we end on a strong point with both N-S pairs bidding and making 3NT after an opposing opening bid. They did well.|pg||
nt|lestergold: in fact pobably make 3|pg||
nt|drg: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This result will make the tournament all the more exciting|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont like to use the bonkers word in this exalted company but with the square root of no defence what is he doing?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: north was likely to pass if South just bid 3@S after the transfer|pg||
nt|mariner1: Last but not least, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Sharon Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no|pg||
mc|9|nt|wollies: I think they will reach  6 @S easier than 6 NT |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 5@D seems like voidwood|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Asking for P|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: to show his aces, but not the @DA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D is sure void|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Or maybe just telling p to bid the final contract|pg||
nt|ady: this looks pretty flat      cherio all|pg||
nt|mariner1: broadcasts. Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge|pg||
