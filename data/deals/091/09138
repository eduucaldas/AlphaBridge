pc|h8|mc|11|nt|bbramley: i think east might have acted over 3@S - in the weak NT style west had to have strength or shape|pg||

nt|hedyg: orkc= option roman keycard|pg||

nt|dburn: down? why so?|pg||
nt|idblu: can cross ruff|pg||
nt|idblu: has to cash @D|pg||
nt|bbramley: true, several winning lines, and some losing lines|pg||
nt|dburn: I mean, if delcarer believes the defenders would have taken a diamond ruff if they coud, she can cash a diamond and cross-ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Fred -- but cross ruff needs @D 33, @S 32 AND South not having 2@S + @H10|pg||
nt|bbramley: alternate is to play for 3-2 @S and 3-3 @H|pg||
nt|idblu: so...isn't that a high %age?   maybe 15%|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but North is pretty much marked with six clubs and three diamonds|pg||

nt|idblu: cross ruffing|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|bbramley: N/S are pretty reliable with their 2nd and 4th leads|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: but i think DBL much better than 2@C too|pg||
nt|dburn: facing a passed partner, one might be disinclined to get involved at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: that's too extreme|pg||
mb|2C|an|some kind of drury|mb|d|nt|idblu: this might bring N into the action|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but I am an extremely old and timid bidder|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I would double rather than bid 2@c for sure|pg||
nt|bbramley: 2@C = drury, showing invite with spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = 3+@S support  [they don't play 2-way]|pg||
mb|2H|nt|idblu: 5@C a good save...e/w can bid 5@S but have to guess @D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Lew is the only one who knows about double fit|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: stansbys finally gained some IMPs for one of their good results|pg||

nt|ahollan1: of course we don't know what inferences Lew had after the RDBL either :(|pg||

nt|othered1: a cautious 5@C, perhaps fearing 4@S would be 5=5 black?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 87 87 another good cribbage hand -- maybe that will excite Zmudzinski too :)|pg||

nt|idblu: I'm pulling for 3N here|pg||
