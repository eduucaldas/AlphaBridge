mb|p|nt|jtr: Become popular in Ireland since 2 of the regular open team pairs play it|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: I rest my case|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Nice 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|the saint: Stability is merely relative to your frame of reference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: wd Ruth|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D  spades and another (Astro-like) or Multi?|pg||
nt|henryb: so now you get to play 2@h instead of 2@d|pg||
nt|henryb: is that better?|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D Multi, 1 major|pg||

mc|8|nt|ahollan1: my source was reading old books & magazines :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A rollercoaster hand. Could have made, was 2 down, ended with 1 down|pg||

nt|daman: here we go|pg||
nt|daman: should be a competitive major suit partscore battle|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello to Bob Heitzman and Ralf Willquist|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and welcome back to Cindy Marshall|pg||
nt|cindy: hi :)|pg||
nt|cindy: hi bob|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good evening from Manchester|pg||
nt|idblu: hi all from chilly Toronto, Canada :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Tom (Dessain) and Dom (Maloney) made a good start in their opening set against Ireland earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk4: JC England 40, (2 matches) Wales 24 (2): Scotland 22 (2), Northern Ireland 20 (1) ROI 14 (1)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: strong NT from north|pg||
nt|cindy: very strong  meaty|pg||
nt|ralfwil: majors or Astro?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: 2@d could be a lot of things|pg||
nt|bobh1: NS got too ambitious in the other room|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2@c-2n-3@c-p is a sensible auction assuming inverted|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT might be the final contract here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E leads a D against 3NT -- the 8 or 9 for preference -- W will have to shift to a low spade right away|pg||
nt|yo_yo: brrr|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ralfwil: For me Wests hand is perfect for a rise on an invitation with the aces.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: PB England 50 (2), Scotland 29 (2), Wales 26 (2) Northern Ireland 10 (1), ROI 0 (1)|pg||
nt|cindy: could be dont|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or i guess even the Q will do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too bad, cuter if low spade necessary|pg||
nt|bobh1: limit?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|april7: 3@S by W possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: so much for that|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dburn: maybe he should have bid it, but it's easy to understand why he did not|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: well judged on the cards ...|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mamos: Not many Wests would pass after 1@H|pg||
nt|cindy: a low spade wont be good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A high @s is needed|pg||
nt|mamos: no I think this will make|pg||
nt|cindy: dont think he will lead high|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|ralfwil: interesting second bid on S. If they are playing a 5-card major opening 2@h shows a 6-card suit or?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2C would not be universal |pg||
nt|eggy: just one of the "never" (type 3) camp I guess|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|daman: NS will make 8 tricks at least|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: How many of you should bid 1@s on N? |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: I have to say I hate 2@C here |pg||
nt|oliverc: 1@S every time for me|pg||
nt|mamos: and me|pg||
nt|daman: Hi David|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer off to a comfortable start|pg||
nt|april7: E could have made a DONT bid|pg||
nt|daman: only if that is part of their system :)|pg||
nt|mamos: Englasnd have stopped in 3@C in open Room so a swing straightaway for the home team|pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|ralfwil: that´s my opinion too|pg||
nt|eggy: just standard I think|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@C is just an overbid IMHO|pg||
nt|oliverc: on the other hand, north is a passed hand, so limited|pg||
nt|eggy: and then South would bid 2S I suppose|pg||
nt|dburn: and only if he were a certifiable maniac|pg||
nt|idblu: I think we probably will be in for some youthful exuberance...if I can go back to my own youthful bidding days :)|pg||
mc|9|nt|yo_yo: so these are the under 25s here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm more experienc might suggest to young Jones that on a weak hand with a six card spade suit, it is generally better to rebid the spades|pg||
pg||
qx|o2|st||md|4SQ9532H63D65CQT83,S64HDKQJ92CAKJ652,SAJ7HKJ95DAT874C4,SKT8HAQT8742D3C97|sv|n|nt|jtr: Dangerous thing to do....|pg||
nt|henryb: Whee!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the swing was ZERO - go figure|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|henryb: 3 or 4@h @@green?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I bid 4 but I am not normal|pg||
nt|henryb: or 1@h or P|pg||
pc|d6|nt|the saint: 4@H gets you to 5% slams. :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@h also possible never 3 says a learned spectator|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from 1st hand we watched, it looks like 1@H is in the partnership mix|pg||
nt|henryb: I wouldd lead from one of my queens|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jtr: Generally i hate pre-empting with Hxx in the other major|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|henryb: like QJ109876?|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jtr: Like yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you get to a 5% slam over 4@H, your partner needs to have his examined. I can recommend an optician|pg||
nt|Walddk2: eyes*|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: maybe other body parts too Roland :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jtr: I booked an appointment with yours Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: H. Møller?|pg||
nt|jtr: Only 25Euros|pg||
nt|jtr: Plus n500 for the air fare|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, he is reasonable|pg||
nt|jtr: Cheaper than here anyway|pg||
mc|8|nt|jtr: In fact, what you pre-empt on is fairly random|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 6nt on N|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes kath U25|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ty tony, any results anywhere?|pg||
nt|idblu: do we know much about these players?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: o'rourke I guess is Irish :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: somewhere no doubt...think England may be ahead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mamos: 3NT looks a more likely contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: another partscore @S fpr EW and @H NS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s on EW?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS?|pg||
nt|cindy: would be kind of pushy|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the other names dont sound Irish|pg||
nt|lestergold: just what west wanted to hear!!|pg||
nt|idblu: I like 4@H  non vul :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i do too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but Northern Ireland played well last match for a good win|pg||
nt|mamos: hello again|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I think 2 ladies NS in other room for N ireland|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi mike|pg||
nt|idblu: hi mike :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: clearly depends on standard for 2D opener in 2nd seat vul|pg||
nt|daman: NS will bis to 2@H and EW will probably balance in @S|pg||
nt|bobh1: interesting jump shift in the other room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 mikes|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: bid*|pg||
nt|cindy: hi marshall !|pg||
nt|bobh1: set the auction up well|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h is allowable at green but will not get a great result this time|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Here is Mike... he will know the scores|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yo_yo: well we arent results merchants, most of us like the bid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobh1: here we'll probably see 4sf etc|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|april7: now 2@S by E? perhaps|pg||
nt|mamos: England have bid 4@S in Open Room|pg||
nt|bobh1: oh they play strong @c in the other room|pg||
nt|idblu: whats the over/under   for undertricks?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|odysseus69: same start next door - then over 2NT south bid  3D - whatever that meant|pg||
pc|c9|nt|daman: noooooooooooooooooooo|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mamos: well whatever 3@S means it showed a good hand|pg||
nt|daman: wrong hand|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|eggy: Presumably it is Blue Club style here|pg||
nt|cindy: 4 now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bobh1: apparently 4n is RKC in @c's|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: probably an endplay on E for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: a poor switch why on earth does he want to ruff when he has natural trump tricks?|pg||
nt|idblu: @S looked 100%|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: -2 it seems|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he's enjoying himself|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: NS ontrack here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: five star contract!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: watching poor east suffer|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c??|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that an undo operator?|pg||
nt|idblu: don't understand this play|pg||
nt|lestergold: ac is reasonable a dim is reasonable a spade to the K is reasoanble but why has he plasyed the 2c??|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cannot see an upside to this play|pg||
mc|8|nt|mamos: even if East responded to B/Wood :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: the bidding diagram is missing a couple of passes|pg||
pg||

nt|jtr: What are £s?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably won't accept US$ either :(|pg||
nt|jtr: Stanford CDs maybe?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|henryb: Yuan is the currency of choice|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|the saint: I've still got a few of those lying around - that's me sorted|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|nt|the saint: One would like to take some action on the West hand, but he is limited by his methods|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there is convention [?Woolsey?] where DBL of Strong NT = 4M & 5+m|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's Woolsey|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South's 4@S bid in Closed Room looks overly aggressive with 4333 and doubtful @DK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again, she plays much too fast|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did she not notice the @C8 lead?|pg||
nt|henryb: did not want partner to feel bad|pg||
mc|10|nt|jtr: The trouble is that she doesnt play regularly enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, then she did not play it like that after all|pg||

nt|mamos: NS found their good save here|pg||
nt|eggy: It seems that Jones & Bell had doubled 3D on hand 1|pg||
nt|eggy: somehow|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think experienced players would enter the auction as East David|pg||
nt|cindy: 2@hx would scare me at IMPs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is an option, but perhaps not an attractive one facing heart shortness. he can't count on more than 100, and may not get that, so why not just take an easy plus|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it's not like S rates to have Kx of hearts|pg||
nt|bobh1: find it surprising that 4n is both intended and interpreted as RKC but they landed on their feet for sure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: let W think for a few seconds that E has the diamond ace. then cash it. life's little pleasures|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i guess it was undo|pg||
nt|idblu: what systems are these pairs playing?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yo_yo: i dont know, are they on ecats?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mamos: 5@S now?|pg||
nt|mamos: 4NT B/wood?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Partner said D and not 2@s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|odysseus69: or 3S or pass or 6s or 5S or...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that wont stop east|pg||
nt|april7: 4th hand might balance|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: I think I prefer that to the open room decision|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: pleased to here all of you defend Norths action at the table|pg||
nt|idblu: not strong NT n/s|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mamos: no stopping East anyway|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i prefer 3S|pg||
nt|eggy: They will need to save 7 I suppose - |pg||
nt|eggy: but after the think, unlikely to save against 6 if West passes|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
mb|2D|nt|odysseus69: over 6s-pass - west should bid grand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The disadvantage with 5@s is that E can draw the right conclusion |pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
nt|mamos: and West for that matter |pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Victor!|pg||
nt|cindy: i think S was about 99% to have four spades|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|eggy: I think that N should still bid and see what they do|pg||
nt|daman: partner rates to have 3@H's|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree, a passed hand should not reopen with D there without 4 spades|pg||
nt|idblu: it's been suggested that n/s are playing ACOL|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that a "do something sensible partner" double?|pg||
nt|mamos: NS don't appear to have a good spot|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: dont fancy it really|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: similar auction to board 2|pg||
nt|april7: since it was not a fit, 4th hand didn't balance|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you might bid 2@s over 2@h on the auction as it was, but I agree that it was a position in which neither side might have a great fit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS will do OK on a club lead|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@DX prob their best spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s can be made double dummy - it can also easily be misdefended-a dim two ruffs and two hearts are easy for the defence but they will not necessarily also come tio a lub trick a ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: club may go away on the third heart|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant believe O'rourke is thinking |pg||
mb|3S|nt|oliverc: East pass here showing the void?|pg||
nt|daman: what was West thinking?|pg||
nt|mamos: EW a little over enthuisiastic here|pg||
nt|daman: East had his bid|pg||
nt|mamos: !|pg||
nt|daman: is that an undo operator?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: now they must save in 7@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has to bid 7S now |pg||
nt|odysseus69: North not South|pg||
nt|eggy: He knows he must save 7 too, but Westmay think N must have a trick to bi 6S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North has adopted the worst approach possible|pg||
mb|4S|nt|eggy: But North puts the problem back to S :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With that solid 6-card @s suit 4@s is a master contract. Yes I see AKQJ10 as a 6-card suit!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well, a more optimistic contract this time..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but the defence may be difficult|pg||
nt|cindy: might as well keep on leading @s|pg||
nt|mamos: well bod|pg||
nt|mamos: bid|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ralfwil: Here we have a combination of doubles P shows NO  or two defensive trick and S can now see that @cK probably is on side for declarer and must save|pg||
nt|april7: to high this time|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: a double figure swing to England|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear he should seriously downgrade his diamond holding|pg||
nt|yo_yo: O'Rourke overbid here|pg||
nt|mamos: well it was always a likely outcome|pg||
nt|idblu: this doesn't play well....but on values s/b in game |pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: For your information commentators and other spectators: three of the players at this table are young ladies. Only East is not. Pls remember (he/she)|pg||
nt|april7: lucky lead though for only 1 down|pg||
nt|bobh1: low @c is clear now|pg||
nt|mamos: @cx |pg||
nt|marlowepi: and equally clear to go up|pg||
nt|bobh1: so maybe it's right to cash the A|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats a good switch|pg||
nt|idblu: 3N will make on lie of the cards|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: assuming that it was East and not North who bid 4@s, he certainly has his bid. West, on the other hand...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and 3NT may be difficult to defeat|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play for the max!|pg||
nt|lestergold: why 24 combined points but very flat hands ghame not at all attratcive|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|daman: this will be another gain for Wales|pg||
pc|d5|nt|odysseus69: sorry- dont agree - North should simply bid 1 more spade wherever the oppo go|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: might have made a short suit trial, denied by E|pg||
nt|daman: West was  trying to see if there was a star in the East (and I don't mean her partner)|pg||
nt|dburn: ...well, after this start she needs only spades 3-3 and a favourable club position|pg||
nt|april7: if short suit trial was possible in saystem|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to eggy|pg||
nt|eggy: hI EVERYONE|pg||
nt|marlowepi: actiually, couldn;t it be right to lead another heart? how does S know the diamonds are running? and N could have much better sopades|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: now the defence have burnt a trick ltho conmtract still one off|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|wilkinsona: East realised he had 2 entries to set up the diamonds|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dT|nt|april7: smal @H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: north gave it back he should never cover the JH|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: at this vul 7@S is unlikely to be worse than a few imps away defending 7@H risks a bucketfu|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mamos: l|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|dburn: would the East-West bidding have been different if North rather than West held the queen of clubs?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|daman: yawn|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|oliverc: I must confess I would be tempted to PASS over West's Double here. Bidding some|pg||
nt|oliverc: huge number of Spades immediately on such a weak hand can just make life easy|pg||
nt|oliverc: for Opps. Left to themselves, it's unlikely E/W will bid 7@H here.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If @cK was on N he had to double, showing a supposed trick |pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: cards played wrong - N kept diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes - I still like 3S although I have been experimenting with xx|pg||
nt|dburn: put it this way - if I could allow my opponents to play a grand slam on a finesse on every board of a match, I would expect to win that match by a large margin|pg||
pc|s9|nt|eggy: So what do you do if they do bid 6/7 spades after you pass?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mamos: 24 points seems the norm for bidding games at imps these days|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|daman: claim|pg||

pc|c4|pg||

nt|Walddk2: amen|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jtr: Depends on what you value more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: east downgrade because of probably wasted [for offense] @H values - but 4S is timid, maybe hoping to play 5SX?|pg||

mb|6H|nt|Walddk2: Crikey|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|the saint: Everyone has chronically overbid except East who chronically underbid it|pg||
nt|jtr: North has?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, 6@H is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4N opposite 1-suiter @H is not everyone's choice -- and North trusted her to actually hold some cards|pg||

nt|jtr: She took 4NT as agreeing @hs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But do they have an agreement? I doubt it|pg||
nt|henryb: I think I would bid 6@h opposite a Blackwood bidding partner. Can she have less than a stiff spade, the @hK and the @dA?|pg||

nt|daman: get your popcorn out   this might be exciting|pg||

nt|bobh1: here they are exerting less pressure|pg||
nt|mamos: Dbl   hehe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: quite a bit of difference between teenagers and 24 year olds|pg||
nt|lestergold: north should bid 4H in my uiew|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 8 card suit is not a takeout double|pg||
nt|mamos: he'll have to bid at 5 level soon|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he must think X and then bid @H is better to describe his hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|eggy: EW need to be careful to check winners as well as losers here |pg||
nt|marlowepi: Jones like to open 1C. or else he has a defective bidding box|pg||
nt|cindy: sorry   im a @d bidder with E hand|pg||
nt|dburn: still, South does not have a clear action|pg||
mb|5H|nt|dburn: maybe it could, but it would seem normal to arrive in only 3@d|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be 6 spades is on though|pg||
nt|lestergold: he isv ulnerable he needs a goodish hand to overcall 4h itys not too good for that bid|pg||
mb|5S|nt|ralfwil: pass on s???|pg||
nt|mamos: NS played in their 3-0 fit after West had opened 1@D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why didn´t S bid 2@c?|pg||
nt|daman: they don't play drury for sure|pg||
nt|bobh1: still will be hard to stay out|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he knows he has to bid @H at the  5 level eventually|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: one of the mysteries of life Ralf|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South is shell-shocked from previous board|pg||
nt|april7: EW should stay in a decent @D partscore and NS should stay out of bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: good for them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree. can;t imagine passing|pg||
nt|idblu: I'm sure that's his intent, but this is the wrong type of hand for that|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they wwere always bidding at least 4s in any case|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and has shown his partner a good hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: actually not good as the cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Tom and Dom are more coservative than most juniors|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: why not?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in @H not good|pg||
nt|idblu: lose 2@h 2@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 5h doubled only 2 off|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wilkinsona: Im for 6 spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: on that lead 6s made|pg||
pc|c6|nt|eggy: and only 4C now seems a bit wet too!|pg||
nt|dburn: double may have been more major-suit oriented - 2@c would not be such a good idea if North were 4=4=3=2|pg||
nt|daman: passing is not an option|pg||
nt|april7: or even worse|pg||
nt|mamos: EW have game here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if i could show both suits by specifying them right away, i might--certainly if NV i would. here i like  1D|pg||
nt|cindy: coconservative  new bridge adjective|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bobh1: well done whatever it was|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|eggy: more optimistic than that George :)|pg||
nt|cindy: it does make 4S i guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When I don´t expect 3@cD be the final contract, I must bid 3@h on S|pg||
nt|cindy: and 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what does it mean when you can't act over 1C, but you can act over a jump-rebid facing a passed partner when opps are unlimited but also have not shown a fit?|pg||
nt|mamos: my typoingis carp|pg||
nt|cindy: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: what would you have him do?|pg||
nt|bobh1: or well-guessed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E cannot afford to double|pg||
nt|cindy: a guess i think|pg||
nt|dburn: bid 4@s, perhaps?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: makes on any lead perhaps|pg||
nt|idblu: on any lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: a spade lead?|pg||
nt|idblu: also|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and west should surely bid 4 hearts over the splinter|pg||
nt|idblu: @D on @C and ruff 3 @H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well may need a diamond hook|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eggy: still 1 back to Ireland it seems|pg||

pc|s2|nt|daman: trump lead|pg||
nt|april7: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: West has a 10 count, why should he cue bid|pg||
mc|12|nt|daman: I used to bid like that when I was their age :)|pg||
nt|april7: its actually easy to lead ace and another @D with those @S cards|pg||
nt|daman: Smolski still bids like that :)|pg||
nt|mamos: I'm sure I was worse but this is really just out of control|pg||
nt|cindy: 4@s should be asking about @hs|pg||

nt|Walddk2: What was double of 4@C?|pg||
nt|jtr: Unwise?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in more obnoxious days - my partnership would define DBL as "showing values for DBL in this auction"|pg||
nt|the saint: Double was an attempt to stop the auction?|pg||
nt|henryb: an attempt to slow things down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: Ms Connolly now realizes that 2@s was a serious overbid and not just an overcall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice stop - but @D ruff can beat 5@H|pg||

nt|idblu: liked the @DK :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another 8 card suit|pg||
nt|mamos: some one has cranked up the deal generator|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: another slam to bite the dust here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 and 8 card suits growing ion trees around here|pg||
nt|idblu: still learning that you can't preempt twice with the same hand|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|odysseus69: thx to spectators|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks especially to Philkip our operator, thanks to NIBU and Sandy Millership (I know how nerve wracking it is to run one of these things)|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h? Well, I suppose they had more trumps than their opponents, but even so...|pg||
nt|april7: 6@C by W|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: yes, that is likely to haunt him for a while|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: playing @c before trumps had solved everything|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if n/s have heqard of blackwood they may stay out of slam|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am confident they will|pg||
nt|lestergold: confident they wikll stay ouit?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|yo_yo: yes stay out|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: thanks to BBO and Roland for organising us all and thanks to you for watching |pg||
nt|april7: not easy to reach but we will see|pg||
nt|eggy: tricky bod for East though|pg||
nt|eggy: bid|pg||
nt|april7: this bid makes it possible|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D seems automatic|pg||
nt|eggy: not likely to get to 6C, that's for sure|pg||
nt|dburn: he might barely have bid 2@d, which would not have been especially tricky|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT is for the club allstars|pg||
nt|april7: W must be careful not to go to 6NT|pg||
nt|mamos: and to marshall and cindy and Bob and David and ralf for their commebts|pg||
nt|idblu: is this a KO event, swiss ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would hope so |pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you i dont like that 2@C bid|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dburn: still, his actual effort might work pretty well|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Well tricky to get over the hand I meant :)|pg||
nt|mamos: yes ralf in 3@H in the OR declarer did test Clubs|pg||
nt|idblu: round robin|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a round robin|pg||
nt|lestergold: but north must be chaffing at the bit with that monster |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that 2@D bid might excite O'Rourke|pg||
mb|4N|nt|eggy: unlikely that NS will bid this 10%- game, so a narrow win for England|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: there you go|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should have bid a lot of clubs even at this vulnerability with good 8 card suits you at least must take up the oppos bidding space|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes Somerville stayed strangely silent on this|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mamos: next session in twenty minutes or so |pg||
nt|odysseus69: will east balance|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sensibly not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks to the operator for showing us all four hands|pg||
nt|ralfwil: duck!|pg||
nt|idblu: and such a strong playing hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: too late east|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ahha enter dopi and ropi|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or podi and pori|pg||
nt|idblu: lets see if they know their ropis/dopis|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: cue for all round disaster|pg||
nt|yo_yo: South isnt sure which suit North is interested in|pg||
nt|lestergold: well obviously dont play rkc |pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: remarkable as David Coleman would have said :)|pg||
nt|april7: this time not a wrong prediction by me|pg||
nt|dburn: especially since West has shown already that she is not backward in coming forward|pg||
nt|april7: with @S fonesse even 6 NT, I miscounted before|pg||
nt|dburn: be honest now - how many of you lot could get to 6@c in four bids?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west may have competed with 3 spades here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is usually correct technique on 2-suiters where there is work to be done to attend to the side suit before trumps|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think this will make|pg||
nt|mamos: and apologies for my typing   thanks to NIBU and Sandie Millership for making us welcome and BBO for bringing this broadcast to us all|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: pass is 1|pg||
nt|idblu: everybody has it marked on their card...but when it comes up :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south hasnt a clue |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks ok, Mike|pg||
mb|5D|nt|yo_yo: Thats the trouble with that 2@C bid, usually agrees @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: only the youth|pg||
nt|idblu: lets see if W holds off till 3rd trump play|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: results will be posted here http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
nt|idblu: or is P 1st step|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: pass shows 1 inexperience playing in our 4/4 fit when you have a solid 7 card suit elsewhere|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now to negotiate the 4-1 break|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: right contract it seems as 5 hearts is off on the ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: amd 5d off if they find the ruff|pg||
nt|idblu: 5@H goes down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, true|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep 5h unlucky does go ionm the ruff andf5f makes but normally this should be plaed in hearts if we are not result merchants|pg||
nt|idblu: and of course we are not |pg||
nt|yo_yo: are you eating your words there Mike :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: Norths 2C bid was not alerted|pg||
nt|lestergold: eating which words|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think maybe both 5d and 5h are both going down|pg||
nt|idblu: ty Helen|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: So there may be an adjustment as they were told it ws nat|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mamos: East was no longer sure all his Clubs were actually Clubs???|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S king was a good card by W--not so easy for N to count W's poinmts|pg||
nt|idblu: that is not the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: club lead surely|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think EW were damaged|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@C is a cue...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: any lead it makes as East only has 1 trump|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but I am surprised the Irish boys dont know the unassuming cue bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: then when trumps are played take third diamond and play club leaves declarer awkwardly placed|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: probably still survives|pg||
nt|idblu: but still makes,,,has @H entry|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eggy: I know strong club pairs who couldn't get there in 20 :)|pg||

pc|dT|nt|april7: W still need @S finesse|pg||
nt|daman: well    1@H - 2@C - 2@D - 3@C - 4@C might be an auction that would impel us to slam|pg||
nt|eggy: not the best practioners of that black art it's true|pg||

nt|cindy: iwas wondering why im always right|pg||
nt|dburn: almost no one|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It´s a kind of safety play with the actual @d-holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: off now?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d7|nt|dburn: it might, but 3@c would not be forcing for the majority of players in this competition|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|april7: if 3@C is forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 promoted|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mamos: North isn't going to like this hand even though it isn't his fault|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not too often we get trick one safety plays in 2S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but let us see!|pg||
nt|cindy: most players dont think long enough at trick one to even consider it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i usually save them for slams. to hold it to down one|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - it's a safety play to guaretee going down one in a laydown contract|pg||
nt|idblu: poor dummy play |pg||

nt|mamos: even my generous spirit can resist suggesting that declarer's line was poor there -- no clear plan |pg||
nt|april7: oh yes ace of @C and ace of @S,sorry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S would like to bid but has no good bid|pg||
nt|mamos: INT |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: whenever the English were getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the Question|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Both West s passed|pg||
nt|idblu: easier to show later|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cindy: think my chimp has some left over|pg||
nt|mamos: bby WESt|pg||
nt|idblu: won't have that problem now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North wont be finished|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no need when pard overcalls in spades|pg||
nt|idblu: 6-5 come alive|pg||
nt|lestergold: nor will e/w be finished|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lestergold: 6c or dim looks lioke a good save|pg||
mb|d|nt|eggy: 1066 and all that :)|pg||
nt|mamos: surely you jusy have to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep perhaps 6 clubs x|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: sensible stuff|pg||
nt|bobh1: double is ok--maybe pd won't bid 2@d|pg||
nt|mamos: ugh I dont like double|pg||
nt|lestergold: west aint standing it|pg||
nt|idblu: W can't sit|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Hastings Pudding|pg||
nt|april7: thats straight forward bidding|pg||
nt|bobh1: if (s)he does, maybe it'll be okay|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: he did :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he did thats sheer inxperience|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult to overrule partner|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lucky this isnt a make really|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: just a couple of levels too high|pg||
nt|april7: 2down but 4@S is a make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D is the value bid, but it takes up a lot of space. for that reason many pairs play a 2C rebid by the opener as artificial|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|idblu: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a cheap save|pg||
nt|idblu: nice support N bought :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: NS are female Kerri North Ruth South|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos: can the defence prevail?  |pg||
nt|mamos: fast forward|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some may wonder why N didn't bid 2C. but if NS style is regularly to make less-than-fully-prepared TO doubles, N cannot count on a fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not sure why east was so keen to defend either|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @cJ from W had been bingo|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: yes but..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: club switch by defence needed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after 2 ducks in @c a @h shift is needed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but not enough as declarer can duck twice|pg||
pc|d9|pc|hJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|april7: good save though|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mamos: i think it is asking too much|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a good case for a club lead on this auction holding such poor spades and a club sequence. but either could be the winner. |pg||
nt|mamos: good effort...|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c7|nt|idblu: better take the @H|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure he could have got an extra 200 a level higher|pg||
nt|lestergold: how doeshe know whether to play heart or spade now?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|mamos: now is the crucial..|pg||
nt|idblu: he doesn't|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he didnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: so lost a trickl|pg||
nt|lestergold: expensive |pg||
nt|idblu: E fault for not cashing|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|daman: more bloodletting since 4@S is cold|pg||
nt|mamos: moment|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well nearly there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how could W not switch to hearts? he can count a set if E has D king|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|eggy: 5 as the cards lie|pg||
nt|april7: actually 11 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|mamos: I think that we must remember the inexperience of the players here but WEst just played too quickly here @H switch could hardly fail unless declarer had nine tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: Kelsey has written a very good book: Killing defence|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true. kind of hard for declarer to have nine though, after he ducks clubs twice|pg||
nt|mamos: Kelsey wrote about 40 good books ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and several great ones|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c4|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not easy for east because east doesnt know of double fit and doesnt know that 2 hearts arent cashing if played thru|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose East doesnt take West for tricks, with his preemptive 4@S bid|pg||
mc|10|nt|yo_yo: but could see the @H going away|pg||
nt|lestergold: jump fits word work well on these hands|pg||

nt|marlowepi: adventures in card play (with Geza Ottlik) and Bridge for the Connoisseur come immediately to mind|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: board 7 passed out both rooms... good to see such sound bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: double is more or less normal, even automatic. What would you do - pass?|pg||
nt|idblu: cashing @H A denies @SA...after the ruff W will know what to do|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes fit jumps good system|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjj: sorry fir the break - lost connection|pg||

nt|mamos: and Ns minors of course|pg||
nt|odysseus69: does 1C promise clubs- do we know?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a cheap save in majors against 5@c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: as used in OR|pg||
mb|d|nt|april7: and a free @S bid by S|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S looks easy enough here|pg||
nt|lestergold: in any case surely a massive jumop inm hearts would show thenature of west'shand even withour specific jump fit agreement|pg||
mb|r|nt|mamos: I don't know but I think it's likely|pg||
nt|daman: Wales just gained an impossible 13 IMPs to make the match closer|pg||
nt|mamos: ewww|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how can it be "sound" when all pass. that is silence, not sound|pg||
nt|lestergold: another Marylin  Monroe|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: also 11 tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: steady..|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's that mike?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ralfwil: 5@h is better than 5@s!|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Yes Kelsey is one of my favourites. all his analyzes are perfect|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: ur too young to know it was a term for shapely hands uised in the fifties for some reason|pg||
nt|lestergold: ur too innocent to be told |pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: North's pass should not be forcing at this vul and this type of auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree about "more or less". i specifically agree with the "less" part. yes i would pass|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|eggy: and North presumably thinks so too, or he would have doubled|pg||
nt|marlowepi: @H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4 spades -2 looks to give EW a chance here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: less than automatic for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick for tournament scores and format|pg||
nt|mamos: NS look like +500 here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A @h shift will make -2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 200|pg||
nt|eggy: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h shift is also safe with @s K102.|pg||
nt|eggy: e|pg||
nt|odysseus69: right - as long as North still has lead|pg||
nt|eggy: But S may overtake and cash the diamond|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Right, but in my opinion N has to decide the defence|pg||
nt|odysseus69: you are right Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S can tell N to shift to D with his signals but its only a recommendation|pg||
nt|mamos: undo Helen|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I have also met him at the table. He was always correct|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|mamos: ugly indeed|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree about 2S. this is a defensively oriented hand except for the sixth vclub, which has already been shown|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: I should prefer 1@d as S, not 1@s on that "poor" suit|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|cindy: i agree with 1@s|pg||

pc|d9|nt|wilkinsona: probably you play these well, Cindy|pg||
nt|cindy: no i dont|pg||
nt|mamos: England supporters will feel this is a poor performance :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too. why let opps in cheaply with 1H? and if they bid more hearts, it may get awkward to show spades. you could miss 4S|pg||
nt|cindy: 1@s is my style|pg||
nt|cindy: but i dont like 2@s by N|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NI back in the lead after 5d -1 OR|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What bid from N will make 1@d a bad bid?|pg||
nt|cindy: spec seems to disagree with my thinking|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@S  is my choice and I know that many disagree but i think it's winning bridge|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not N i am worried about. it is W|pg||
nt|cindy: its not N|pg||
nt|cindy: lol marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you could guarantee me W would pass i might bid 1D|pg||
nt|cindy: agree|pg||
nt|cindy: have to get that spade bid in at the 1 level|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: however this may be -2 vs 2 hearts made so no harm done maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even then it might be critical to play spades from my side to protect hearts king|pg||
nt|mamos: for sure if you bid 1@D you let West bid 1@h|pg||
nt|cindy: if S is interested in hearing from N again, he will balance|pg||

nt|mamos: lol  good argument would tou open 1NT 15-17?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Even if 1nt is weak, wests hand is worth a rise to 3@s.  With 4-4 in majors I had asked for majors and after 2@d, my bid is 2@s, as an invitation|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: last board and 15-15|pg||
nt|idblu: 2 bds to go|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last match tonight in about 20 mins: JC  Scotland v Wales|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: OR is finished|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: I mean 6-4 in majors|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sorry two to go|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: for me E has an opening with 4-4 in majors and 12 P|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@H  didn't go off   oh dear oh dear|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: ah we missed board 10|pg||
nt|april7: cuebid|pg||
nt|april7: almost 6|pg||
nt|eggy: I suppose that NI must be about the most experienced team this year Mike|pg||
nt|daman: should just jump to game now|pg||
nt|daman: signing off|pg||
mb|2D|nt|april7: then E might continue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the trouble with Easts 2 spade bid, its difficult for the west hand to stop|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don;t see why W would nopt bid stayman no matter what their range is|pg||
nt|cindy: i know|pg||
nt|cindy: maybe not sure of their methods|pg||
nt|cindy: this could get doubled|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some results on :http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if NS were vul this would get doubled|pg||
nt|bobh1: N should double in my opinion|pg||
nt|cindy: heart A wont be good lead|pg||
nt|dburn: What you are doing is claiming that East underbid with 1NT, but that is because you saw all four hands. Maybe West underbid by passing 2@s.|pg||
nt|cindy: no  it is NOT because i saw all four hands|pg||
mb|2H|nt|eggy: certainly the 3 mowen hace been in the JC for the last 4 years|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS can do a lot of damage to this, buti cant double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this auction can;t be right, can it?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Is this right Helen?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Is this right?|pg||
nt|mamos: so 3NT sahowed a @S stop     .......|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but N may feel that facing a NV weak 2 they are not necessarily odds-on to make game, and they are not that likely to beat 4S more than one|pg||
nt|bobh1: She has 3 tricks, maybe partner has one |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: :(   no problem |pg||
nt|cindy: i totally believe in upgrading with a good five card suit   |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: lots of undos|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: women|pg||
nt|mamos: it's very hard to do vugraph operation thanks to our op she's done great|pg||
nt|ralfwil: absolute the best lead!|pg||
nt|cindy: and all aces and kings outside|pg||
nt|cindy: and W also underbid|pg||
nt|cindy: conconservatives|pg||
nt|cindy: coconservatives|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|idblu: who likes 2@h over 2@s|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mamos: NS have no losers but a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|daman: what possible reason would he have to continue after 4@H?   he would pass|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H or 4@H, which is stronger?|pg||
nt|mamos: yes the WElsh team also have played in the JC and PB for some years|pg||
nt|cindy: what is this auction ?|pg||
nt|mamos: nope  wrong operator|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it may be 3 hearts from west, etc|pg||
nt|hedyg: operator pls undo!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Helens done really well so far, thanks|pg||
nt|hedyg: AFTER 2@S PASS BY S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ... but its hard not to bid 2 spades also|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok this is a short version of the bidding|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cindy: i assure you i make no comments based on seeing all the hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not me i play 21|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: 2/1|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|daman: 3@H|pg||
nt|daman: leaves room for exploration|pg||
nt|mamos: and ew are to high|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 3@H E bid 3NT and W 4@s|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep 2 spades went -2 OR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: like it would help, right?|pg||
nt|cindy: right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lol|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|odysseus69: 6H is enough although cards friendly for grand |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks are easy with 2-2 in @h and 3-3 in @c|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|april7: so E with 7 controls might invite for slam|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|daman: he would cuebid 3@S over 3 @H   yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I hope all comments are based on experience|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eggy: well Cat has, but 3 year ago they were struggling to put a team in at all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when i make comments i usually haven;t even seen any of the hands|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cindy: lolol|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|daman: she :)|pg||
nt|mamos: mine mostly based on ignorance :(|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|idblu: :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mamos: next hand|pg||
nt|cindy: not agreeing with either of you|pg||
pc|cA|nt|april7: then 4@C by E and might end up to high though|pg||
nt|cindy: mike and marshall|pg||
pc|c3|nt|idblu: auction will go the same|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|daman: cannot bid 3@S and 4@C simultaneously Avram|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as usual lol|pg||
nt|mamos: ow?|pg||
nt|cindy: ew?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I liked that Mike! But you must consider bidding and the hand who has to act|pg||
nt|mamos: did declarer duck @Dk|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eggy: do you think 3S guarantees a void?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|eggy: otherwise 4NT would be rather imprecise i think|pg||
nt|april7: after a further Cue by W another cue by E|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@C would have been interesting but the @d overcall cut the suit out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surely E did not bid 4S. he barely had a 2S bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: could be +1 for a push now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: should not bid either of them over 3@h - East has judged this pretty well|pg||
nt|daman: West will not cue|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|hedyg: he bid 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: and cindy and Marshall and ralf|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3S looked like a fragment promising a singleton C- probably 4C for void|pg||
nt|idblu: lose 1|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Alan - as coach for juniors -- are you up-to-date on systems we're watching here?|pg||
nt|henryb: I was just debating with myself whether E should bid @s or NT|pg||
nt|the saint: I work with U20s more than U25s. NS are playing straightforward 15-17 5cM as far as I'm aware|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told that EW play 2/1 but they have experimented with Carrot Club|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: Not sure what happened to our closed room; let's hope we get one soon|pg||
nt|the saint: Carrot would be popular in Ireland as two of their leading open pairs play variants of it|pg||
nt|henryb: If 2/1 then E should surely bid 2@s over 2@h|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|c6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know it, and so does David|pg||
pc|sT|nt|henryb: Why 2@s. Because you have Very Good Spades. If they were longer 3@s would probably be a good choice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2-way club, 11-13 balanced or any 17+   ... if 14-16 is their NT range|pg||
mc|10|nt|ahollan1: does it use Canape -- or is that just Blue Team Club?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Canapé|pg||

nt|oliverc: lol|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cards again friendly for 4S- an unlikely spot|pg||
nt|daman: final board of the set now|pg||
nt|april7: it depends whether 3@D is gameforce or just raise to at least 3@H|pg||
nt|mamos: last board now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Last hand of this match coming up|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and a close thing it is too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ill-advised i would say. he doesnt have a heart stopper really and he has a terrible hand. if W couldnt act over 2H, how can there be game? |pg||
nt|cindy: thx all   think next set in about 20 minutes ?|pg||
nt|mamos: last board now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another void, great hands this match|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|bobh1: S did very well to stay off the @h lead|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to fred and Kath and Tony and Mike|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: do we like that multi?|pg||
nt|idblu: if that is supposed to be a weak 2 ...I don't like it|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|april7: another 4@S by EW|pg||
nt|mamos: and thanks to NIBU and Sandie Millership for letting us join in and thanks to you all for contributing and to BBO and Roland for organising this  More soon|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thx all. see you again in 20 minutes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 aces and a void,   hmmm|pg||
nt|mamos: especial thanks to helen our operator  and to BBO for putting on the show|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 20 minutes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and 4 of other major|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk4: and 6-4 in the majors. It has all the flaws for a weak 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mamos: Yes Victor I was thinking EW might get too high but if they do they may make game :)|pg||
nt|mamos: about 1NT NS?|pg||
nt|mamos: and to NIBU and Sandie Millerchip for organising event in Belfast|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I don´t like weak nt with a 5-card major|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sadly NI got it wrong OR|pg||
nt|mamos: West did something she will regret in OR  the pressure is great|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: nothing like a few flaws, Roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d i assume is not meant to be a two suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: no way for this to go off it seems..|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: happy with 1Nt rather than 1S?|pg||
nt|oliverc: I hve a religious aversion to 1NT here :)|pg||
nt|eggy: I would usually, but I think this a suit oriented hand|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to the spectators and to your commentators , George Avram David and Steve|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to the players and Philip our operator  Good job|pg||
nt|april7: thank you all and bye till next time we meet|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mamos: The Spade suit has good texture  prefer 1@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps with 5 small in the major|pg||
nt|eggy: Not that I'd be totally happy if East responds 2D|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to NIBU especially Sandie the match organiser and BGB|pg||
nt|mamos: well EW inthe auction|pg||
nt|cindy: wouldnt it be more productive to open 1S in 3rd seat than to let them get two bids in first|pg||
nt|bobh1: assuming support x's, pass with the S hand might be attractive|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry I'm sure Sandie will forgive me|pg||
nt|lestergold: not meant to have 4 hearts on the side|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: i think playing 15-17 it's different - but prefer 5 card Stayman then as well|pg||
nt|mamos: lastly thanks to you all for spending time with us on BBO|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have to say i could hardly pass 4S once S has doubled 3C. there goes my whole hand on defense|pg||
pc|dK|nt|odysseus69: there are 2 schools of thought - (1) all 5-3-3-2 hands in range should open 1NT and (2) touchy-feely- some yes and some no|pg||
nt|oliverc: what about (3) Never!! ?? LOL|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: this has chances as cards lie|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|d7|nt|idblu: nowadays a weak 2 in a major can have 4 in the other major|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mamos: results are now up for first four rounds http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|odysseus69: those in the always 1NT school include Andrew Robson and Chris Dixon|pg||
pc|d8|nt|odysseus69: plaaying strong NT the choice is not available|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If W opens with 1@s EW probably had reached 4@s|pg||
nt|mamos: The score is still 0-0 because we have no comparisons yet - I guess that there will be quite a few imps swapping hands in a moment|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am a touchy-feely but in the interests of partner harmony I have decided to go with 1NT for a while but I am keeping a note now |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mamos: Does anyone know reults for other tables this round?|pg||
nt|idblu: this should make easily|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: agree Cindy. A third hand opening is to prefer here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: could easily be a double game swing, especially if S has a stiff diamond, which is far from unlikely|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ralfwil: Bye!|pg||
nt|mamos: bye all :))|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bye all|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so a last board win for England, thanks to all in Belfast and see you soon |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|oliverc: I must confess, opening the West hand with 1NT when 2@C isn't 5-card Stayman|pg||
nt|oliverc: seems a little self-defeating to me|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suspect that even with 1S opener they would have stopped in 3S which looks enough|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well there are a few schools of thought on that subject Fred|pg||
nt|lestergold: very favourable hts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: most come down against that one|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|mamos: 1@S opening seems normal in third at favorable|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: unless it's a very weak suit|pg||
pc|h7|nt|idblu: I don't disagree....but many do....very old school :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: looksm like about 11 tricks probbaly two trumpo tricks for the defence now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: on this hand EW would have found game with west passing, so no harm done|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sQ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c6|nt|odysseus69: 4S looks as if it needs heart finesse + 3-3 hearts - although in practice the spade position helps|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ralfwil: a @h lead had made the contract a little bit more sensible|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|wilkinsona: may make 11 for 16-16|pg||
nt|lestergold: id be surprised tho if the west hand qualified for the bid that was made|pg||
pc|d4|pc|sJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|s3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|idblu: i would cut my tongue out 1st|pg||
nt|yo_yo: kibbs are pointing out that West had a 1@S opener, yes i agree with that|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|d2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|d6|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d9|nt|lestergold: well yes in my simple version of sayc that i play it was a 1 spade opener|pg||
mc|11|nt|wilkinsona: yes, add 5 points for the void and its an opener|pg||
pg||
