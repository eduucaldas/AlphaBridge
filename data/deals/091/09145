nt|vugrapha3: hi everyone|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi|pg||
nt|pbundy: hi everyone .....|pg||
nt|mildredb: hi everyone|pg||
nt|gowdy: Hi |pg||
nt|woozle: This should be a good match - the strong Global team has come off a big loss to play the leaders USA Hampson|pg||
nt|mariner1: are they Global, or just merely confused? :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all - |pg||
nt|mariner1: top 15 advance + Yeh Bros team as sponsors|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: top 16 go through so both of these teams are comfortable, but top 7 get a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi All and Welcome to the Yeh Bros Cup Bridge Invitational Championships from the|pg||
nt|mariner1: Gold Coast in Australia   http://www.yehcup09.com.au/  - Tournament site. This is|pg||
nt|mariner1: the knockouts - round 1 set 2.|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: -  standings.|pg||
nt|yeh2009: 16 Boards|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike's son is sitting East here|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Northeast Pennsylvania (our local excuse for mountains.)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Rob and all|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: hi Al and welcome all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hello again Sunil|pg||
nt|gowdy: soft 1st hand  4 @S looks easy|pg||
nt|woozle: Easy 4S for NS to begin...hard to imagine what else they might do with it|pg||
nt|mariner1: our Operator is Dave Thompson - hi Dave!|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Gary!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ge rob, gary, spectators|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Martin1|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mrdct: probably a @c partscore for EW here|pg||
nt|mrdct: west thinking of passing this in|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H instead of DBL is interesting choice|pg||
nt|pbundy: well; i haven't seen this for a while! natural to play bid over 1NT|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: yes A Y   are in tenth place  and the face quiet a good team   Beware*|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Martin, close match|pg||
nt|yeh2009: I like the North 1NT opening get it all off your chest at once|pg||
nt|mariner1: Gary I see you are still in NZ :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|santyclz: Looks like an uneventful 3nt to get everybody settled in.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: veteran Indonesian pair facing a lot younger Dutch pair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks, hi Steve.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: West took a while to open that hand- was he going to pass ?|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's often not a good idea to open in 4th seat without a @S suit|pg||
nt|salokin: Hi All|pg||
nt|pbundy: is 2@S appropriate?  hard to know|pg||
nt|mariner1: the top 8 enter next session with NO LOSSES , next 8 with ONE LOSS and its|pg||
nt|mariner1: double elimination, two losses and you are out|pg||
nt|lestergold: well first hand looks like a good slam in hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: slam makes here if they find it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi again|pg||
nt|lestergold: re hi Mike gold here from England older relative of David in East seat|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: A well known husband wife combo here|pg||
nt|mildredb: perhaps they play wk NT |pg||
nt|pbundy: possibly - reasonable supposition|pg||
mb|2S|nt|robinswr: hi|pg||
nt|mrdct: as more often than not you write down -110 defending 2@S|pg||
nt|pbundy: manoppo wisely passes|pg||
nt|gowdy: may get to the 5 level   but no harm there|pg||
nt|woozle: Bold 4H from McGann, escapes for 800 if he guesses trumps|pg||
nt|woozle: Even a slam move from Curtis will escape unscathed as long as he counts his aces correctly|pg||
nt|gowdy: yes  even todat's game 4NT should be blackwood|pg||
nt|woozle: presumably NS have the mechanism to show a better 4S bid, like pass-then-pull|pg||
nt|mariner1: the 1@D call should help bid the slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by south its very good|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Hi everyone   will stay a few boards with you     of this exciting KO  match|pg||
nt|lestergold: and with K dim onside its fine played by north|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I assume 3@His a summary auction |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi|pg||
mb|4S|nt|robinswr: garbage stayman|pg||
nt|santyclz: Struck gold.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@D Texas transfer|pg||
nt|yeh2009: 4@D Texas transfer|pg||
nt|mariner1: I had Gary relocated last night :)|pg||
nt|yeh2009: Not SOUTH AFRICAN Texas which would be 4@C|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: hi every one|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so both these teams have a shot at being in the top 8 which is a big advantage|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: american style raise by North|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Bill|pg||
nt|dburn: last train to 3NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sadistic double from West|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: sunny 81f or 25c at the venue|pg||
nt|frankaus: still time to catch a flight to one of autralias national events :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: pairs start Sunday - teams Tues|pg||
nt|mrdct: a problem for EW here is that 1@C doesn't show a @C suit so they could lose their fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doubleton @SQ will help - but can east maintain control?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: yes Al bbl might have got them to the great 6@D contract|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: border lines value to reach it|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Have to confess I'd spend all my time scuba diving on your reefs.|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: what is supposed to do East  I must say  that West description is far from perfect|pg||
nt|dburn: but East can't bid that, so he needs to pass|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk4: Hi Steve, Joe and Marshall|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 3rd and final @h?|pg||
nt|mrdct: lindqvist might play his partner for 5@h here and compete to 3@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: but I would suggest he's already fully described his hand and should leave it up to south to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|jbgood: n still thinking - not good|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Joanna and Lew Stansby against the best of British|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Bill Jacobs and Jan van Cleeff|pg||
nt|imp_jan: folks good morning (it's europe here)|pg||
nt|salokin: very popular now to play TRF over a (semi)nat 1@C opening 1@S is then a TRF to 1N or sometimes @D's |pg||
nt|lebridgeur: declarer will have no problem to collect at least 8 tricks probably 9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: hi Roland, steve, Joe and specs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|woozle: He'll still be fine unless he duplicates the other table's line of play - I don't know which additional loser they found|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: or even ten with the nice position of cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Michael Askgaard|pg||
nt|mariner1: well bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@H also in Open|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: but no border for the good players from N !|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|santyclz: He did only have 7 hcp for his x, but who's counting?|pg||
nt|mrdct: this contract looks quite safe|pg||
nt|mildredb: this can go dn 3 w/ best def|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better played by north actually|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: and England did well OR  too|pg||
pc|hT|nt|robinswr: club lead is to be able to cross ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: E showed hearts - so what? Hi all|pg||
nt|mrdct: he is a passed hand though so a shapely 7 count looks fair enough to me|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: oops, balanced them in to a game that may make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Brad Coles from Australia|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: just go for 3 round of @d  cash the Qof @c and finesse trump   easy seeing all 52 cards!|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Brad|pg||
nt|redgrover: hi all -- i'm very excited to see our kids on vugraph at this stage of the event|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, brilliant effort|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: how old are they Brad ?|pg||
nt|redgrover: nabil is about 16, andy early 20s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sunsamvar: dbl|pg||
nt|bjacobs: N/S were right the first time with 2@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even with that lead - no entry to North!|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4 losers in 4h!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pbundy: yes; needs an immediate diamond shift|pg||
nt|mildredb: shdn't be hard to find - |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|santyclz: It would be an impressive system that could get to 4@h on this hand.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not arguing with the x, but thinking over 3@c is an overbid.|pg||
nt|mrdct: yes i agree he has a clear pass over 3@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not the soundest penalty double ive ever seen from tom especially at imps but fortunately it looks like 1 off|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: but some players do like to think everything through twice|pg||
nt|mildredb: or @S|pg||
nt|askgaard: Hi|pg||
nt|othered1: @H split here isn't great, but friendly and guessable @D position may salvage this for NS|pg||
nt|yeh2009: 4@Sx only -300|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in the first half we saw a classic nt shape of 2227|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: contract will go one down  with the @c break|pg||
pc|h7|nt|salokin: other table ended up in 3@C after a precicion 2@D opening (short@D I think) |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Nikolas Bausback, Germany, and Martin Carroll, Ireland|pg||
pc|h3|nt|salokin: Hi All|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes; i guess if you lead back a spade and declarer goes up to lead a club - no dummy entries.|pg||
nt|pbundy: hard for the defense to go wrong|pg||
nt|pbundy: manoppo had to find another round of restraint.  not so easy on the auction.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here can discard the club and make seven|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D - yikes  i hadn't even considered that|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bjacobs: Best option is to lead a top spade from hand at trick 2, and catch East napping|pg||
nt|mildredb: @C now , the south need to ret low @H, otherwise might get endplayed|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: very young chaps  then good show |pg||
pc|c2|nt|mmmakela: Here in Finnish Lappland we got a meter of snow|pg||
nt|frankaus: reef is some distance from the venue (600-800 km) - but a fine surfing beach virtually accross the road|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Marshall Lewis from USA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi All|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
nt|lestergold: a mandatory double at match points of cousre but this isnt match points|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: what should West have done, Jean-Paul? acquired a minus score?|pg||
nt|lestergold: david have u been to bed yet or are u merely up very early?|pg||
nt|dburn: I am as awake as I usually am|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: N was not that far from an invitation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just wondering if they could find making game :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Team name Bridge i Norge means (as I am sure you have guessed) Bridge in Norway, the official bridge magazine there. Boye Brogeland is the editor|pg||
nt|pbundy: i think that this is ok IF north overtakes|pg||
nt|mildredb: sure|pg||
nt|pbundy: tough play to find tho|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Passing out 3@S would still have achieved a plus score, without the risk of -530.  However, West knew he hadn't expressed his values with 3@C (not that any other bid seems ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: possible).|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk4: http://www.yehcup09.com.au/  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Progressive scores in all matches: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=6&T=R|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: passed out seems extreme?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I dont think the hand was thrown in in the OR|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: rehi|pg||
nt|pbundy: still - even 300 will be a nice pickup|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|imp_jan: defenders cash out already|pg||
nt|pbundy: perhaps south should have anticipated and led low in any case.  even if south could have smothered the ten - a heart pitch is likely irrelevant|pg||
pc|d7|nt|santyclz: Yes, but more sharks at the bridge table.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Nicoleta Giura|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|lestergold: played by north can be put to a dimiand decision at trick 1|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Martin and Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi again|pg||
nt|redgrover: adam 17, ally 24, peter 20 and justin 19 (all approximate ages)|pg||
nt|mariner1: excellent show, they have to be excited|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: East overcalled in @d  so|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk4: Not easy to keep track of all those time zones|pg||
pc|s2|nt|imp_jan: btw, not easy to stay out of game...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mmmakela: hi all!|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mildredb: 6 imps for China|pg||
nt|shevek: g'day from Gold Coast :)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|santyclz: Nicely done for an overtrick.  |pg||
nt|mrdct: 2 more @S to lose for 9 tricks|pg||

nt|frankaus: nany of the Yeh players staying for next weeks event - will be one of the finest gathering of bridge tallent ever assembled on AUS soil|pg||

nt|mariner1: made 7 in Open it seems|pg||

mb|2N|nt|mmmakela: four for me nonvul|pg||
nt|frankaus: poll for final contract & result ? 4@S NS 4 me|pg||

nt|mmmakela: 5@Hdbld|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://www.yehcup09.com.au/index.php is website with all kinds of info|pg||
nt|woozle: This deal is a free-for-all - whoever wins the bidding is free to struggle in a contract of their choice|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: ok for 10 tricks then   I woudl have prefered to throw a@h on the 3rd round of @d|pg||
nt|dburn: quite so|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yeah passed is not probable there|pg||
mb|3C!|an|puppet|nt|imp_jan: as it is on this one...|pg||
nt|othered1: Cayne jumps off to a 7-imp lead by making an overtrick in 4@H on board 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4sd best spot here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I tend to agree with you both.  3@C and double both dubious - but what were the alternatives?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW can go a long way to save|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i bet bidding reaches 5 level|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 5 @h a good save|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West was hamstrung by the auction|pg||
nt|dburn: instead of the conservative 3@c, what would a liberal have done?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3@d  ess conservative   but green|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no way that N/S were being kept out of 4H|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: * less|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@d shows a "good pre-empt"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A liberal would have bid 3@S ... and achieved his minus score|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|santyclz: Anyone for 5@s by s?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not with this bidding tempo, S might bid on|pg||
nt|imp_jan: that's what i mean: 3nt|pg||
nt|gowdy: transfer here    yes :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w have a profitable save in hearts against spade game at the vulnerability|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can save at 6 @H too.........|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: at 5 level  @s   usually win|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can make 4@H on a Motsian fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: EW using the increasingly popular treatment of transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|pbundy: mildred - assuming stnd methods, do you prefer 1@C or 1@D with this hand?|pg||
nt|mildredb: i open 1D w/ 4-4|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moysian|pg||
nt|redgrover: 3NT also likely to make|pg||
nt|askgaard: Sensible bidding by NS here|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume 4c is a jump fit|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H is Michaels, @S and a minor.,,,,,,,,,, 4@H is cue in support of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: so townsend will know there is a double fit|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: wure 5 cards in @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C has to be jump fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure i like 4@H bid, what is the purpose of it|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: The 4@h opening at the other table got them to our expected contract.|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks like i have a winning ticket :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I blame Lasut!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@H looks makable here for EW|pg||
nt|mrdct: and NS playing transfers also i believe|pg||
nt|woozle: If West transfers to spades he'll surprise North a bit, and then keep him quiet|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are overboard possibilities here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mrdct: EW have the chance to get the singleton @C not on lkead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South checks the backs of the cards ... partner has overcalled vul, they've bid to 3NT, and I've got THAT hand?|pg||
nt|woozle: 2S might be a chance to make, particularly if the DQ doesn't appear now|pg||
nt|woozle: 2S, 2D, 1H,3C will do|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3rd and 5th  is the Q rite ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moysian = 4 3|pg||
nt|mariner1: think it shows raise with defense|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to me it implies a better hand outside hearts than brink has|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@s would have shown a bad pre-empt in any suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|redgrover: if north plays it|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 5 @c  seems more probable but difficult to make|pg||
nt|frankaus: $US70,000 first prize would make a nice filler for thir budgets|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am told Andy is 21,,, still excellent play for his age|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: score corrected|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I'll get clarification|pg||
nt|mariner1: Nick is now our Operator|pg||
nt|yeh2009: Hi Nick|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: hi from down the hallway|pg||
nt|lestergold: i predicted it but auctions niot finished|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@S off 1 in Open.... miss guessed @c?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe trying to induce a 7@H sacrifice|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this could be a push if no DBL|pg||
nt|dburn: no, just lost a diamond ruff, one assumes|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: @d  ead ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes @D ruff does beat 5 did not see that|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if townsend passes which he should ,david will know that he has a likely defensive trick so they should defend|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: townsend thinking deeply...|pg||
nt|lestergold: and altho thuird in hand at green tom did open the bidding|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is a minor violation of one of Burn's Laws|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you don't sac with trump ace, maybe thinking double|pg||
nt|mariner1: subtract the number of Aces the opponents have from 8 and do not bid at that level|pg||
nt|lestergold: argument in favour of the phantom 7h is insurance of course massively expensive if they get it wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: i.e. defend and 6s makes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just as well there are screens|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 4@H = good spades|pg||
nt|dburn: assuming, that is, that Gold and Townsend are playing their full system here|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mmmakela: I'd bid 3 @H without the club ace|pg||
nt|santyclz: Markku and I each owe you a coke.  (No you can't make it a beer.)|pg||
nt|jbgood: after a @c opening - yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: but not now|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: the backs are blue|pg||
nt|imp_jan: previous brds the hackeds avoided 4@H indeed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: what pattern?|pg||
nt|redgrover: these guys are all very experienced -- they were in the finals of our nationals 2 years ago, and have some international experience too|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: rosenkranz type maybe, promising 1/3 high honors in spades|pg||
nt|salokin: Hi Marrku|pg||
nt|mildredb: obviously n/s is playing stg @C system|pg||
nt|woozle: Declarer now does best to try for a diamond ruff in hand|pg||
nt|mwigor: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=3&R=&T=R is the link for this round|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: Fast Arrival|pg||
nt|santyclz: Transfers over a 1@c bid seem to work particularly well with Polish @c.|pg||
nt|mrdct: @C lead looks pretty clear-cut here|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess 1 down|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think if you are going to play transfers over 1@C it definately makes sense to broaden the range of hands that open 1@c|pg||
nt|jbgood: corrected by kibs: 2 down|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North sweats ...|pg||
nt|imp_jan: here, in 4!x there 4 top losers|pg||
nt|imp_jan: in 4@c|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Same bidding in Open|pg||
nt|marlowepi: IMO it is not obvious for W to pass this out in 2S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably 2H showed 4|pg||
nt|salokin: or some kind of snapdragon, promising semifit and 5-c in 4th suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Round 7:  Yeh Bros v USA Hampson and India Venkatesh v India National|pg||
nt|salokin: same bidding in OR|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 4 @c sounds like a cue|pg||
nt|askgaard: Not nice to have a hidden 5 card heart suit, but 2@h is too ugly with these cards|pg||
nt|askgaard: So I like his double|pg||
nt|lestergold: good boy now david's turn and he has gotm ir right|pg||
nt|dburn: they may not be, but in any case East could not open 2@d, because that would be Flannery|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|robinswr: i like weak fast arrivals|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was 2H something special? or did 1H not show 5?|pg||
nt|robinswr: i think 1heart was artificial|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spec copnfirms it, yes thx|pg||
nt|imp_jan: good save against 3@h :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 @H seemed automatic|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction has given minimum info away, the killing spade lead not at all obvious|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|frankaus: beer is a little early 10:45 am here|pg||
nt|mrdct: The official website is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ with links to live scores from all matches, a webcam and other goodies.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks and welcome, Dave.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Running scores for all matches can be found at http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=3&T=R|pg||
nt|gowdy: only loses to this  and he may lead the j from thst|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mildredb: interesting - having to rebid 2NT w/o stopper in either suit :)|pg||
nt|woozle:  If the next card is a low heart, Hanlon will probably get it right|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: very well done good judgement by South|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to stay low though 5@C has a little play|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H is the spot, now to make|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lebridgeur: that shoud not be much of problem  with EW distribution|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course no great result hewre as they must have found the dim ruff in the open room|pg||
pc|c8|nt|santyclz: Really oper?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sry, my first, lost it :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: live results will be available from all tables - at http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here's another "making slam" :)|pg||
nt|salokin: but not "lawfull" :) |pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open it has gone P P 1@D DBL - 4@D so far|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the puppet has avoided the S lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sunsamvar: the pleasant surprises continue :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: effective bidding by curtis and joe has lead to a poor 3nt|pg||
nt|redgrover: is this one of those hands where you duck a heart? or is that too risky with 2 possible spade losers?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: hung toying between @S5 and @D9|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open it has gone P P 1@D DBL - 4@D - DBL - P - 4@S - P P P  so wrong spot there|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: well a difficult hand to bid with opponents silent  but @d opening stillmore difficult I do not like south double 2@c seems more appropriate|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: now he's moved the @D5 to the end of his hand|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mmmakela: if supp dbls and E promises 4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: sometimes the Lore of Total Tricks is not all there is to it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dias fit to be considered|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mrdct: the official site is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ which has links to lots of useful info|pg||
nt|jbgood: double dummy to take it 2 down - needs a small heart |pg||
nt|jbgood: but the rest is also double dummy - so...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: yes, W has an 8-loser hand with all cards working. should be safe at 3 level, and NS arent going to double anywya|pg||
nt|mmmakela: right on|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mildredb: in the open room, a @S was led|pg||
nt|lestergold: so flat after all the excitement|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mittmouse: hi all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D finesse and CLAIM?|pg||
nt|pbundy: interesting|pg||
nt|mildredb: played by south in open room|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|woozle: A good player knows that it's fairly safe to underlead the heart ace here, but risky to lead from the queen|pg||
pc|cK|nt|redgrover: losing the heart to the right hand|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: welcome George|pg||
nt|yeh2009: Hard to switch to a spade here|pg||
nt|mariner1: he ducked to protect the K@S position|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes all over wd|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open is only in 2N here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that may go down|pg||
nt|mariner1: and the 2N is played in W also . W opened 1N|pg||
nt|mariner1: as we see the 2N was off 1 also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: responded 1nt rob|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 10 imps Italy|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sunsamvar: hi George|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh right ... 1@D then 1N by W|pg||

nt|marlowepi: why wouldn't E duck the club? what could he lose?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: contract now safe|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h2|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|sJ|nt|woozle: now down one for a flat board|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lebridgeur: claim|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: playing it well, only -1|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|mariner1: so nice score|pg||
nt|redgrover: would have been more interesting if west had @HJ to cover the ten|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: not sure their bids--which in any case seem fairly routine, made a difference to the final contract|pg||

nt|lestergold: but i was thinking that we are the grockles here!!|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|santyclz: My favorite is "defenestration".  To think a language needs a word for "to throw someone out the window."|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: dilemma for East here - can he run six diamonds, or lead a low one and hope that (a) partner has two (b) partner gets in in time |pg||
nt|henryb: me, I lead 4th best from my longest and strongest|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: what about infrangible something this contract is not|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: I'll translate all this into English|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: infrangible = unbreakable|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Don't they teach people in Portugal that majors are worth mentioning?|pg||
nt|lestergold: they are my members on vacation obviously in porugal|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't like the jump to 3N with a four-card major. No reason why 4@H should not have been a better contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: not if theyve been playing with certain of my members|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not only that, but a 4333 12 count is hardly a game-forcing hand|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Yes, remarkably, this might be the par result - if reached a bit unorthodox|pg||
nt|imp_jan: england is in 17th postion, usa stansby in 20th (out of 24 teams)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: amazingly Lavazza is last in the rankings for the moment|pg||
nt|rogerclee: i wouldn't really call a 1@H overcall at these colors "fairly orutine", but it is normal in NS's style|pg||
nt|gowdy: 4@S here  play or defend ?|pg||
nt|woozle: routine 4S for EW, and Curtis probably won't try to disrupt their auction at this vul|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S should be off 1|pg||
nt|me argent: a little disapointing 4 NS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: these discards look unlikely, damage done with no spade shift after diamond ace|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N needed @S switch when in A@D|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: seems a god result for NL|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mmmakela: so loses a club and 2 spades |pg||
nt|marlowepi: this should be fun|pg||
nt|woozle: or I could be wrong|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: maybe grue should have opened 1heart|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes it is very dangerous to open strong club when very distributional and short in spades|pg||
nt|mrdct: very good slam for EW here in @H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: no.. but will still make 12 cause @D split|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in 3N here in Open  S playing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually a diamond lead was safe, club tricks going no where|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but could tom be sure?|pg||
nt|mariner1: S playing a very weak 1N NV|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think so trump ace gives him total control|pg||
nt|mariner1: N might do some leaping here to jam|pg||
nt|dburn: suppose that East had held @CKQxx|pg||
nt|dburn: then, a club lead would have been necessary and a diamond lead faintly ridiculous|pg||
nt|fabsayc: would not help, clam cold then|pg||
nt|fabsayc: slam|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugrapha3: correct|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: hello btw :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: No problem, for some reason the players frequently seem to have other things on their minds than ensuring the vg oper can see all their plays.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if NS are playing Precision or not - and 1@S doesn't resolve that issue |pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have major game and EW can't save due to VUL position I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in general the same is true when two-suited, but on previous board N held spades, so the danger was greatly reduced|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a remarkable field - full of quality |pg||
nt|imp_jan: might be a slam in clubs here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: R3: Australia Youth v Bridge i Norge and New Zealand v India National|pg||
nt|robinswr: 5clubs should show spade support|pg||
nt|mildredb: interesting X|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes; i wouldn't find it myself|pg||
nt|woozle: one club ruff in hand is ten tricks, losing a heart, diamond and the club ace|pg||
nt|woozle: McGann will always get to game here, but how he proceeds will perhaps give us an insight into his style|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: On the @hk lead, e will probably make 6.|pg||
nt|robinswr: no he'll probably lose a club and a diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Joe means, because E can place the high cards|pg||
nt|mrdct: with 3@H showing a strong @H raise east is sure to make a move towards slam now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Easier for those who play any rebid other than 2@s shows extras, either in hcp or distribution.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice practical 4@S rebid|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the Chinese are supposed to be precise :)|pg||
nt|redgrover: i think 5@D by east requires a heart lead to get 500|pg||
nt|mariner1: of course NS have to bid the game to play it|pg||
nt|mariner1: N in 3@S DBL in Open here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mmmakela: u all agree with 2 clubs? |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: incidentally, tempo altered on purpose|pg||
nt|mildredb: I'm w/ you|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3 h  is my choice|pg||
nt|woozle: Hanlon can't bid 3S now, since that's what he would bid with a yarborough|pg||
nt|gowdy: could rite side it|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it is a good result - God, if he were Dutch, might have arranged something more likely to produce a swing|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mmmakela: lots of playing strength so some might bid 3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same 3nt at other table on board 2|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S was off 3 and 14 imps|pg||
nt|frankaus: "live" scoreboard for every match at  http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=10&T=I|pg||
nt|othered1: pretty aggressive double, wonder if he planned a conversion to @D over 3@C|pg||
nt|askgaard: It's a good idea to have firm agreements about passes like north's here|pg||
nt|askgaard: Some play that it is a penalty pass. I do for instance.|pg||
nt|shevek: since EW can make game, not so dangerous...|pg||
nt|othered1: You could argue it's a penalty pass, but south fortunately has a doubleton @H , making a stack in north's hand very  unlikely|pg||
nt|askgaard: yes :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: and north has only one Jack that isn't working -- wow talk about cover cards|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hard to predict the fin contract on this one unless W opens 1 NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Which they did in OR|pg||
nt|woozle: 9xxx doesn't look much like a stopper, maybe 4H is the best bid|pg||
nt|gowdy: pass here|pg||
nt|woozle: 3NT makes anyway in comfort|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: who is the boss     sort of hand  here!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to S√∏ren Christiansen|pg||
nt|askgaard: It's a VERY expensive misunderstanding to have|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what was townsend double showing|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|santyclz: I do, bad honor structure.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3@d not alerted, kind of waiting bid i suppose|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think 3@D is natural, which South will turn into a cue with 4@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a difficult area for natural bidding|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: well it may have been alerted, casually|pg||
nt|pbundy: manoppo may wish that he had found pass, too|pg||
nt|gowdy: it is a stop however :)|pg||
nt|sac: hi all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: famous last words, this will go down|pg||

nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|bjacobs: N/S play transfers after 1NT - a good method|pg||
pc|dA|nt|woozle: I wouldn't be too confident against a vul weak two|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=10&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: syandings after 9 rounds|pg||
nt|shevek: hi S√∏ren|pg||
nt|askgaard: Hi teammate!|pg||
nt|othered1: is double by west simply extras, even on this auction?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rogerclee: i am surprised at this non-diamond lead|pg||
nt|pbundy: not good when they play the same suit at both tables by the same team|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 4@C is low anyway|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: fall from grace here for NS but I do not know to whom the blame should go|pg||
nt|shevek: aha|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mmmakela: I do too, was just asking|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm not quite sure what "serious 3NT bid" means - but it's got them on the right track for slam now|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Serious means he is very keen to go to slam.|pg||
nt|jbgood: apart from being a world champ - brogeland is the editor (and owner) of Bridge i Norge. His prd made his debut on the Nor Open Team last year by winning the European Teams Chship|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This auction will not make their highlight reel ... but they may escape with a game|pg||
nt|imp_jan: anyhow, the heart lead doesn't paralyze declarer|pg||
nt|gowdy: good to make the opps work for a push or lose 1 hand|pg||
nt|dburn: and 3@h showed spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications very awkward in this contract|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a vital tempo for defense lost|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead in Open doomed it quick|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Generally only possible if 1NT is non-forcing|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, you can play transfers over almost anything nowadays|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mrdct: brogeland has been a frequent visitor to Australia in recent years to play in our major national events|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - and with Erichsen and for Stern|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: Looking at the N/S hands, 3NT is a dreadful spot|pg||
nt|pbundy: i hope children are not watching; this will not be pretty|pg||
nt|mildredb: hard to even know what to do @@ trick 2 :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: anyone for 2@C originally with the east hand?  not that 2@C would meet a particularly nice fate, either|pg||
nt|pbundy: medic|pg||
nt|mildredb: I don't understand east's pass, myself|pg||
nt|pbundy: i once was playing against a top lady professional with a client in a mixed pairs.  she put down a less than exquisite dummy, and her partner said "ms. x - i need to go to the ...|pg||
nt|pbundy: bathroom.  YOU play it" and left!|pg||
nt|mildredb: but 2@C looks better than 2@D|pg||
nt|pbundy: i would be tempted to do that on this hand - except - it was declarer who emerged the partnership in this |pg||
nt|pbundy: yes it does, mildred|pg||
nt|othered1: Why was 2@H alerted?  Anyone confident about it?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The losing team disappears from the main event and heads into the Swiss Plate|pg||
nt|sac: Better to lead Diamond Q this time but smal is normal|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: lauria said something to north about the 2@h bid but didn't write it down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Let me find the CC|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: versace didnt alert it only lauria|pg||
pc|c6|nt|frankaus: make will bid 2@C - if pd passes its likely to be the best spot|pg||
nt|mrdct: hopefully EW have a mechanism to work out they are off the trump A|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like this will make....... has to play @H right|pg||
nt|lestergold: tom would like to be in dummy to take heart and club finesses doesnt have a helicopter shame they did not find a way  of treahing their 4/4 ht fit|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not obvious why S is doubling. could N pass be forcing?|pg||
nt|lestergold: what about taking spade ace leading club for 2 clubs a ruff a dim to the ace and the fourth club|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The advantage is that over any other transfer than this one, opener gets another chance.  i.e. The usual advantage of transfers|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|frankaus: *many|pg||
nt|me argent: and a @D leads dooms it later|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sunsamvar: only needs @Dk from p to take it down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on @D return, @CA @C ruff, trump, claim losing @HA|pg||
nt|imp_jan: this time a big club migth do the job|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and this is just setting up tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Single raise not mentioned|pg||
nt|askgaard: 4@h in the other room. Hard to decide which game is the better|pg||
nt|othered1: 9 easy tricks, even though south's distribution might not be clear to east|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he cannot exactly "play "@h right" since he has no entry to the table|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart to king will endplay south|pg||
nt|lestergold: why did nt david bid 3d presumably shopwing both majors?|pg||
nt|dburn: but this will do, since South is now somewhat endplayed|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mrdct: most recently on Nick Irens' team|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NEXT|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@h showed spades|pg||
nt|dburn: it did not show hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3d would have showed both majors surely?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbgood: y|pg||
nt|dburn: no, 3@d would have shown hearts|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Systems/Open/Italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
nt|lestergold: too late to beat it |pg||
pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: which is going to make a massive number of tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: not Quick Silver though Joey :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gowdy: better to play this  one in w with a @D lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: off only one now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why queen?|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely tom should have run the club minjd u he doesnt know which honours are in the north  hand|pg||
nt|dburn: double would have been for takeout, but East did not want to risk West passing for penalty|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So for example, with the majors, 1@S - 1NT - 2@D (= hearts), and over the next bid, opener can describe further|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|robinswr: north is shows his hcps so that the clubs will be misguessed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As usual with transfers, the "lowest" suit (in this case clubs) takes a small hit.  You can no longer play 2@C|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: god decided    David and NL back into the race|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, Jean-Paul Meyer was right (as he usually is) about the previous deal|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually if david doesnt release club ace- may still go off|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: David is too kind this morning :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: @H play works, but only because West has !AH|pg||
nt|redgrover: i think given that North was given the chance to double 3@H, he's probably done his part|pg||
nt|frankaus: i like to let pd know that we have 8 major fit but, here - 1@S over 1@H would have placed NS in a better position|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in 4@S here in Open|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mmmakela: the lead was strange imo|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: fine play|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mmmakela: club seemed obvious|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mrdct: claiming now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now he is out of endplays|pg||
nt|dburn: no, he isn't|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is looking  very bad board for engalnd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jack and a diamond but not really safe|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, for pity's sake|pg||
nt|pitiful: yes i can see that :) |pg||
nt|pitiful: sorry private|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: townsend still thinking|pg||
nt|mariner1: thinking is good up to a point :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|robinswr: so does he play for qj onsides or singleton honor offsides or QJ offsides|pg||
nt|dburn: well, as soon as South showed out on the second diamond, he was known to be either 4=4=1=4 or 4=3=1=5|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d4|nt|robinswr: he can make it if north has a singleton honor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: It may seem odd that N did not try to cash heart with only stiuff in dummy. N is reasoning that: (a) EW would not bid a slam off 2 aces, and (b) S would have led hearts unless he ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: had so many that a void was probable. both assumptions less than guaranteed|pg||
nt|robinswr: is north 7-5 in the reds|pg||
nt|santyclz: S followed to 3 @ds.|pg||
nt|robinswr: easy looking at all four hands tough at the table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@H  5-9  3-card support|pg||
pc|cA|nt|woozle: He tangled the play a little, but was never really in trouble|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|robinswr: south never support hearts so north could have 9 of them|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: at this point Grue claimed 10 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: david will come to three tricks now|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h5|nt|santyclz: Magic @c position.  The normal @c lead would have worked out much better.|pg||
nt|mariner1: so -200 will score imps for EW here|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: so that will level the match|pg||
nt|lestergold: is tom going to pull this off?|pg||
nt|dburn: in either case (since North must have @sA for the contract to have a play) this line is safe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R  for running scores in all matches|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|mariner1: maybe not..... strange not pulling trumps|pg||
nt|mariner1: -500 then|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he is closer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nice read of the cards and catering to north having a club left|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: Well what do you know - Roland got one wrong!  It's a red-letter day|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Try http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=3&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence still have to take care|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|me argent: versace is from school that sees down one takes it and only then looks for more|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bjacobs: That gets young Gold thinking|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: this hand will be a push  England plus 9  and 13 boards to go|pg||
nt|lestergold: well one thing he will not do is discard the ten of dimonds which is the only losing option|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mariner1: has it now|pg||
nt|lestergold: pphew |pg||
nt|lestergold: hair raising stuff|pg||
nt|bjacobs: @DA also a losing option :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: good defence|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: I guess exactly 3 card raise would be the alert|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That would stepping stone partner rather than himself|pg||
nt|dburn: @cA not so great either|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Excellent point|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes true|pg||

nt|henryb: if I did that partner would be 3-4-1-5 and it would go two down in 3N with 4@h making 5|pg||
nt|aupillon: 6 spades anyone?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but if it shows 3=3=(4/3), then it is a perfectly descriptive bid|pg||
nt|henryb: 8NT I bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes henry 1r4 top tricks in spades of no trumps|pg||
nt|aupillon: 50% for grand but missing King @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but a sensible auction should lead them to 6s|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 17 tricks in @ds.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|aupillon: where do you count this tricks ? if no King @s rolling on|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie grand making in 3 denominations but only sensible 6 in spades or even diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: I only count 16|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: Undo please|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now for a test of methods - 2NT can be a difficult opener |pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: does their transfer guarantee values ?|pg||
nt|aupillon: Me, I see King of spades third in East :)|pg||

mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|aupillon: I appreciate this stop|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: I feel quite strongly here that 4@S should show four spades (plus, if you like, a certain nu,mber of controls) |pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|aupillon: But 16 tricks later, maybe I'll regret it :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume that they play promissory transfers so if you have a yarborough with 6 cards in a major u cant transfer and stop in 3|pg||

nt|frankaus: hard to see this not being played in 4@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true though the more hearts N has, the less likely for him to open 1C with a spade void|pg||
nt|santyclz: I couldn't find a good link to a good definition of "serious 3nt".  If anyone has one, pls send it.|pg||
nt|mrdct: another slam hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: the dealing machine has been in good form so far today|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_3NT|pg||
nt|imp_jan: check http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=5&T=R for running results|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: claiming 12 via the heart finesse|pg||
nt|mildredb: Yeh Bros have a hole to dig out of|pg||
nt|pbundy: 'tis true|pg||
nt|me argent: i guess he is hard of seeing|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: he had it half an hour ago, but he at least was working out what the hand was actually about|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: so he had only one chance out of 4 and got it right well done|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|mcarroll: Now this could be more interesting|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am not a fan of minimum offshape doubles|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 6@h works nicely, though.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6 beaten only by a diamond lead|pg||
nt|pbundy: the last hand did nothing to disabuse me of that belief|pg||
nt|mildredb: nor I|pg||
nt|pbundy: on the other hand.... i am somewhat fond of "barts" - 4/3/3/3 takeout doubles|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh they were Not DBL'd  I looked wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: sorry I for sure thought I saw a DBL :)|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: so somem yougsters still play ordinary weak twos|pg||
nt|redgrover: 3NT possibly off on a diamond lead here|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|marlowepi: a frienfly hand for 3NT|pg||
nt|mittmouse: in the 1st match there was a trump suit of q9x opposite a10xxxx a great canadian player percy sheardown taught me that as long as righty wouldnt duck with kx u should play low to ...|pg||
nt|mittmouse: the q 9x  u only lose to a stiff j and u pick up all other holdings|pg||
nt|salokin: X shows ?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: @hs|pg||
nt|salokin: Ah thx now i see|pg||
nt|pbundy: still - this one is awfully minimum.  i think i might skip this one|pg||
nt|gowdy: is this a "good weak 2 with 2@D showing a poor one ?|pg||
nt|woozle: Interesting weak two from Grue, with more flaws than I can count|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is my 5th session is my excuse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what happened?|pg||
nt|me argent: someone is hard of cing|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry i fell asleep|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N showing as +1 now????|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3n-1 surely|pg||
nt|me argent: hell as a canadian ill take it|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it remains the case that whether you play McKenney or Dodds or reverse Vinje, the best discarding method of all is TLKW|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: hearts better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if 3@C is fit-showing or just some artificial 4card @S raise|pg||
nt|gowdy: Looks like it |pg||
nt|woozle: Nothing bad happening to him though, unless you're afraid to miss a playable featherweight game|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|imp_jan: how to stay out of game on this one?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not easy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@D - 3@H - Pass?  Seems a bit double dummy|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i think he'll punt 3NT, but he is thinking|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3@c not anybody's choice, some would have opted for 3@h i.s.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: like me :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: not me unless they are full value|pg||
nt|pbundy: curious pass by lasut|pg||
nt|woozle: Interesting lead...will McGann pick it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: did sheardown play with bruce elliot?|pg||
nt|redgrover: but might get a heart lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: 8-11, they have 2@D for weak, weak 2 i think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently 3@S is an inferential splinter|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|santyclz: I guess e was wondering what s had for his x.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wow, tom townsend is taking a view|pg||
nt|imp_jan: by passing|pg||
nt|mmmakela: they shd find on the way that 4 @S is the spot|pg||
nt|mcarroll: May not be so easy with NS so active|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @D lead needed ....... a @S or @H makes it    @c is nuetral|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: no the right guess  difficult let us admit|pg||
nt|redgrover: would have still been time to find @D switch after a top heart lead, but too late now of course|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: declarer   will pick the@c suit with no entry in the dummy|pg||
nt|redgrover: yes, would go down if he was able to finesse|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: results in all matches - refresh often|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N for sure if EW find it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Don't tell me|pg||
nt|dburn: throw losers, keep winners|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: west will soon know he has a 9 card @H fit and a nice side suit of his own so slam ought to be bid here i expect|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The operation is a success, but the patient (3@C) is not going to live|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, it's not clear that 3@H would have made either|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and in breaking news, Lavazza are on course to win a match|pg||
nt|gowdy: notpossible|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: grue just asked hanlon if he ever undleads aces, after he won the trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n is now coming|pg||
mb|6H!|nt|mittmouse: y|pg||
nt|pbundy: you'd be hard pressed to call this one "full value" mildred!|pg||
nt|mariner1: W was figuring a @H would give up a trick here|pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: brb cig br|pg||
nt|frankaus: my beer stock is rising - all my other stock are falling :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wondered it too. am i talking too loud?|pg||
nt|mrdct: not to mention his stiff @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N serious slam try?  4@S reject ??|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well 3@c 'feels' stronger'|pg||
nt|mrdct: official website is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ for live scores from all tables, a webcam and other goodies.|pg||
nt|woozle: My experience with Ace underleads is that quite often the lead looks technically great, but partner doesn't read the position and hands back whatever the lead gained and then some|pg||
nt|dburn: well, no one has passed yet and the auction has already reached 3@s|pg||
nt|mariner1: why DBL 3@S here?|pg||
nt|dburn: so provided no one continues to pass, someone will bid 3NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4th Burn's Law ? :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers suggest DBL was do not lead a @S|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: aggressive but a very good contract here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Wasn't the club 10 a winner?  why did he throw it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: with hearts and spades breaking this must make|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: did not know TLKW|pg||
nt|bjacobs: like me :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: he couldnt afford to be endplayed with the stiff ace of dims|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess JPGG would be the best French translation I could offer|pg||
nt|bjacobs: JPG format for Gaelics?|pg||
nt|dburn: that sort of thing|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: quite David jeter perdantes garder gagnantes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Could I have an Australian translation please?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: upside down !|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think england are in for a ba one here rumour has it that there was a different contract played in the open room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right - we tend to throw winners and keep losers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: We never get endplayed that way|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: fine politic I shall have a try     see if partner appreciate|pg||
nt|lestergold: for some reason, north preferred a take out double to a spade overcall|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A just result for the (insert adjective here) takeout double|pg||
mb|6S|nt|sunsamvar: iwhat is 3 @C ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i met bruce elliot Toronto in 79 or 80 at one of the most impressive bridge clubs i've ever seen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he was impressive too|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I don't think there was a plus score on this deal for E/W.  Even defending 2@S won't work - that contract makes|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: I am not sure whether records have been kept, but I am prepared to be that this is the longest auction without a pass in the history of bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: http://www.yehcup09.com.au/  for results, web cam, bulletins, etc...|pg||
mb|p|nt|askgaard: I wonder if Lauria is proping for 3NT|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: x i think is some sort lead direction|pg||
nt|lestergold: welll the play will be a little more starightforward than the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: he doubled on his partner's 1club opener|pg||
nt|mmmakela: active as a dbl on 1-level, not that disturbing|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: at the end   South will thank North to have a weak hand !|pg||
nt|askgaard: Not so hot to blast 4@s and find partner with @hJxx|pg||
nt|sac: worried about a heartlead and a ruff in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: the second best major suit fit was played in|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: so that will get the match tie or about|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: 1M-(DBL)-2N would have been Limit Raise +   -- just not sure about 3@C :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: S is in 3@C here in Open so more to Global|pg||
nt|othered1: They've wrong-sided @S, but only may cost an overtrick|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: none of the NS actions took up any bidding space, so it seems that their activity could only help EW to bid to right spot and to make what theyt bid|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcarroll: Well, they got to 6@S in OR with no opposotion bidding!|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 100% agr|pg||
nt|salokin: I think W was more scared to miss a slam here|pg||
nt|salokin: without bidding slam is not that bad, just needing Qx in @H or QJ bare in @D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so a perf Roland 6|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Cheek wishes he played the 10 :)|pg||
nt|salokin: after the bidding here EW know that @H and @D are not braking in a favourable way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks for the OR report, Martin, which confirms my remark that the NS bidding was more likely to help EW than hurt them. W could tell E had a doubletoin spade and did not bid any ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: suit over 1S, so the likelihood of a heart loser was very high, hence no slam even if E has a maximum|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Broge thinking|pg||
nt|shevek: fair comment by a spec: 1@s by east would have rightsided 4@s|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes, it would, but they likely find they do well by staying within their system|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this lead could gain an imp|pg||
nt|mariner1: can hold to 4 now|pg||
nt|lestergold: i strongly object to a takeout double with the nrth hand|pg||
nt|dburn: not that 4@s is any great shakes, mind you|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Seems like a good contract, particularly when West has opened the bidding?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well issue one is which denomination should they be playiing cin. Issue 2 is how high?- on thel ayout 4s is infrangible|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mittmouse: probably fit showing|pg||
nt|mildredb: no, I consider 13 full value  :)  |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 3@s was heart support, strong, unbalanced|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: fsj|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: probably|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, as combined 19 hcp gamed go, it's as good as some and a darned sight better than most|pg||
mc|13|nt|santyclz: This should stem the Netherlands tide.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, that same partner bypassed the chance to double. i reckon N was in a better position than S to know if his 1C opener contained adequate defense against 6S|pg||
nt|mrdct: sensible auction to a pretty good contract|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i think 3S there was a serious slam try as well|pg||
nt|imp_jan: Gold stole a diamond trick|pg||

mb|1N|nt|aupillon: 3NT for nice men|pg||
mb|2D|nt|aupillon: this a potugese Landy , i guess|pg||
nt|aupillon: r*|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well its also landy at favourable vulnerability so not to crazy|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: personally I think it is, as Mike would say, rydikulus to bid over 1NT with the E hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is rydikulus to use 2@D to show the majors|pg||
nt|aupillon: Henry, you mark a point...|pg||
nt|lestergold: are n/s gonna be talked out of 3N?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thats why Capp is one of the worst conventions there is|pg||
nt|lestergold: its commonly played in the UK|pg||
nt|henryb: which they cannot make|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3N needs some play, on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's number 5 on my list on "25 Conventions you do not want to learn"|pg||
nt|aupillon: Roland, but your phrase by mail. And thank you|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: they might make 2 spades 2h a dim and 4 clubs depending on the defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if North thinks 2NT is for the minors....|pg||
nt|aupillon: don't ever tell me...|pg||
nt|henryb: I guess North interpreted it as unusual, which is not a bad notion on this auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: my vote would have been for a double of 2d by south followed mup by a n invitation|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|aupillon: :):):)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|aupillon: you told me.... From tomorrow on I play 2@d on 1NT !|pg||
nt|henryb: my vote would have been for S to double 2@d and N to double 2@h|pg||
nt|aupillon: Second Henry's point|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|santyclz: I sit corrected.  Since I usually go down at least 2, I guess I need better odds than that.|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|aupillon: i think he is in some kind of trouble now|pg||

nt|santyclz: The Meckwell influence.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

nt|frankaus: slamm fail on this 1  - can they stay out ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't remember -- how low did spotcards go in pinochle deck -- East hand sure looked close to coming from one|pg||
nt|mildredb: Yeh Bros now on score board for this round|pg||
nt|woozle: Tough hand for EW to bid....strong 4441s are never simple|pg||
nt|gowdy: now some action here|pg||
nt|woozle: If East opens something the spade fit will probably be lost, but 3NT will still make|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like that typo word, staright|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: no play just a claim|pg||
nt|mariner1: it can't be infrangibled even by defenestration|pg||
nt|lestergold: well reached the superior 7c contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: told |pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: another comfy 3NT that may not be that easy to reach|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, maybe North-South should have carried on bidding - how expensive was 4@d?|pg||
mb|2D!|an|cappeleti|nt|mrdct: back down to earth wiht a partscore hand now|pg||
nt|santyclz: And barely that.|pg||
nt|gowdy: unless 2 @D weak :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybve north passed initially?|pg||
nt|sac: this looks wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: starightforward it is 630 a.m. no im not up early i havent been to bed yet!!|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 7 @s  let us go back to bridge|pg||
mb|2N|nt|redgrover: was a real shame that they were maxed in the 9th round after so many big wins against good teams|pg||
nt|lestergold: defenestration another great word something to do with window dressing going wrong?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: what does t6o0ld  mean in English?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, now it will be easy|pg||
nt|mrdct: north possibly not compelled to bid here|pg||
nt|pbundy: if they reach game, they'll add a bit more|pg||
nt|gowdy: wow|pg||
nt|woozle: third seat special from curtis|pg||
nt|askgaard: 2@c for hearts and 2@h for clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part score here as in Open.....|pg||
nt|mariner1: natural @c passed in not encouraging to N|pg||
nt|mariner1: in S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble?|pg||
nt|mariner1: I bid what I have 1@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: or pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: might be best not to give away info|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sounds too much like running to me to bid 1@D|pg||
mb|3N|nt|robinswr: probably showing a spade stopper (Slow Lebensohl)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 and probably 2+@D  -- Precision catchall|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Did South do something wrong?|pg||
nt|askgaard: As far as I remember|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: as far as i can se north did not ask about he 2@h bid!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 7@S is ingrangible.  This word is going to get a workout ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: there goes 3nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am sure you are right, but as far as i am concerned S should just bid 3NT. after all, opps have bid two suits, so even if one of them is right to lead for the defense, they still ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have to find it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west would have to return a diamond to hold to 5|pg||
nt|woozle: Will Hanlon rip 3NT?|pg||
nt|gowdy: after P's free bid ?|pg||
nt|askgaard: Hmm|pg||
nt|mariner1: well no matter what I would like to do I am sure there are systematic limitations|pg||
nt|lestergold: on the lead of a k and another dim not too cheap david|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe down three, after all|pg||
nt|dburn: no - it means the action of throwing something (or someone) out of a window|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Our matches in round 2 are: China A vs Norway and USA Hampson (Meckwell) vs Chinese Taipei|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3nt might have denied a spade stopper|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: we had a lot of interesting hands in the last set..|pg||
nt|mildredb: yep, 6 badly needed imps |pg||
nt|gowdy: he knows  but what to do|pg||
nt|woozle: McGann doesn't really have anywhere to go except 3NT|pg||
nt|gowdy: I'm glam I'm here and not sitting W|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: this board has been played 4 times so far twice in 4@S twice in 6@S|pg||
nt|gowdy: glad|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=9&B=25&T=O|pg||
nt|othered1: or maybe it's a cue-bid in support of partner's overcall?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: south says 3@C is a @S raise to his screenmate (west)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: surprised Erik(saelesminde) resting in this key match|pg||
nt|woozle: 6D can be made, if that's where they finish|pg||
nt|othered1: or perhaps a fit-showing bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: well now the pressure on the dutch to equal the grand made in the closed room|pg||
nt|lestergold: im t6o0ld that this bidding relates to next board|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|robinswr: sounds a 50 point deck|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so? if N calmly passes they might lead clubs. these methods that give so much info to opps are of dubious practical value when you have 25 HCP and two balanced hands.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1 sp is 1 nt without a heart stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the set  2 was a rollercoaster|pg||
nt|woozle: lots of dummy entries for the trump coup|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Hanlon thinking now|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@h might suggest @d shortage?|pg||
nt|askgaard: The 1@s overcall might look thin, but I think it would be standard for most players at this level|pg||
nt|sac: hard to pass for Lauria now|pg||
nt|shevek: other room W is playing 5@c dbled I'm told|pg||
nt|fabsayc: burns law in action|pg||
nt|mariner1: where will this end up? 2@D or 2@H?|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: fine bidding for England OR|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrdct: is this going to play any better by south?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: suppose ew play 2/1, that explains the 3@c by east|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: No but North knew what was going on after the D was ducked|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lack of action by W a bit surprising, facing Nonvul foes|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good contract|pg||
nt|mmmakela: a few down ok|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on this auction E is unlikely to have only five clubs, so W can act|pg||
nt|salokin: here the precision NAT 2@C opening left the @S-fit in the dark. Which was found in th OR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, it wasn;t just the opening bid that left spades unmentioned. W had 2 chances to bid the suit|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 2@S bal was obvious|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our Round 7 matches in about 55 mins are: Yeh Bros v USA Hampson and India Venkatesh v India National|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if 2S directly would be inappropriate, a balance would be in order, i;d say|pg||
nt|salokin: true, and he possible knows that either ther is a 8-c @C fit or a 9-c @S -fit|pg||
nt|salokin: in 2@H N could save a trick with a intrafinesse in @D|pg||
nt|salokin: If getting in time in hand|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no entries I guess|pg||
nt|salokin: to play the 2nd @D round (1st smal to 8) Q@D to pin the doubleton J|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S now puts his suits in proper perspective|pg||
nt|mariner1: and are in trouble here now|pg||
nt|mariner1: E thinking penalties|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I think after 2 passes enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm this looks a little frightening|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@D or 3@H I meant and did not expect the E pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: are better off when the opponents pull all the trumps off the top?|pg||
nt|mariner1: are you|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 7@C is slightly better than 7@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But 2 imps worse on the scorecard ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If this was the final board, that would sure be relevant!|pg||
nt|lestergold: well flat grand slam boards are not two a penny|pg||
nt|dburn: that's a heavy 2@s - Paul Hackett at the other table chose 2@c then 3@s, which expedited (a real word) matters somewhat|pg||
nt|lestergold: and when its cold, in three denominations one does expect one of em to be bid at this level|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If 3@H shows shortage, South is sort of interested|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But all we know is that it was alerted|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Some specs suggest 7NT. Yes, I know you can make a grand slam in three denominations, but that does not change the fact that 7@C is the superior one|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Move to next board?|pg||
nt|dburn: if he didn't, maybe there are some sharks off the Gold Coast to which he will be fed tomorrow morning|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mmmakela: NS pair nicknamed "Drinkdriver", has nothing to do with the actual meaning of the word :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oper, pls check that.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nico is teasing us.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: getting better by the minute|pg||
nt|mrdct: will score an extra @H trick at the very least|pg||
nt|jbgood: any better is also a way of putting it..|pg||
nt|mrdct: but doesnt have an obvious source of tricks|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: McGann sighed when he saw the four spades in dummy|pg||
nt|gowdy: but is it realy a 4 card spade suit or some @D try with a @S card  I don't know|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so the law of probability dictates flat hands here i suppose|pg||
nt|dburn: West may remove this (unless South does, but surely even in these days, that's a penalty double)|pg||
nt|mariner1: S saves them.....|pg||
nt|dburn: no, it wasn't|pg||
nt|me argent: norts double saved them|pg||
nt|mariner1: now NS can get too high?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugrapha3: curtis didn't realise was his turn!|pg||
nt|redgrover: a nice little convention to have there, especially if partner is prone to being 2-2 in the majors|pg||
nt|sac: well done. The only game with a chance in this layout I think. But a long way to go|pg||
nt|mariner1: S decided to play 5 3 and not the 4 4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|robinswr: 4clubs would have gone down at least one probably two|pg||
nt|mrdct: he's surely going to go after @C here|pg||
nt|mrdct: west needs to be careful not to get endplayed|pg||
nt|jbgood: he will|pg||
nt|jbgood: go for clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: so they have another call to invite in @H|pg||
pc|s4|nt|nickf: Progressive scores in all matches are up: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=1&T=R|pg||
nt|mrdct: if south leads a @C up now and west winsm west might feel in necessary to switch to @S to get rid of the @SA entry|pg||
nt|shevek: only 50's|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mmmakela: their system is called Drink|pg||
nt|frankaus: gib makes it will Manoppo?|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect he will|pg||
nt|santyclz: GIB looks at all 4 hands.  Gives it a slight advantage.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bjacobs: A sensitive auction|pg||
nt|imp_jan: nothing against 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: E/W established the the heart position was a bit shaky|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: i would bid    with w   cards  2@d and then 2@s   to show a weak major 2 suiter but I am much older|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jbgood: but you never can tell with boye|pg||
nt|lestergold: iif thats the fate of erratic bridge players then  there will be a lot of very fat sharks there|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs: That duck is a good expert tactic - threatening to ruff the losing heart, whilst maintaining control of the suit|pg||
nt|woozle: I think if you're going to skip the spades to get the excellent diamonds in, you should be  planning to bid the spades later|pg||
nt|shevek: declarer knows south is void in @cs|pg||
nt|askgaard: I don't like declarer's chances here|pg||
nt|sac: neither do I|pg||
nt|mariner1: lots of kibber jokes about being on the "Brink"|pg||
nt|lestergold: is someone having  a joke with us|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sharkey: .|pg||
nt|askgaard: Some magic is needed|pg||
nt|sac: but I like it better than 5clucs doubled|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mrdct: boye hoping to get the opps to open up the side suits for him|pg||
nt|mariner1: knowing there are likely 4 @c in E (I think) @D would be a better spot|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why did versace play diamond king?|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure|pg||
pc|d3|nt|frankaus: not only looks but has repeated attemps if it finds a failing line :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: which wont work today|pg||
nt|mittmouse: did i really stay up for this|pg||
nt|redgrover: which may have been more appropriate on this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this looks like 1 off|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mmmakela: 6 shd make but the grand they bid in OR won't I suppose|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess it takes a trump lead to beat it.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@CX was down on ly one.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The crash meant that we lost all data. We will get the scores in eventually, but please be patient|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So the score will be now: England 1 point ahead|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sry we lost the play, I'm sure Bas played it well:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If he made it, he played it well|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|robinswr: this is what happens when you operate and overcall 1nt with that hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OR:  ....this is what happens when you make a great bid but you are stuck with systemic agreements that gum up the works|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not as if 1D was more likely to get NS to 3NT than a 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|robinswr: maybe he should have run 6 diamonds before leading a spade|pg||
nt|shevek: west was told 3@C a @S raise, i c|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mariner1: W is playing 2@S here in Open|pg||
nt|me argent: since north ran from 1@Dx dont think south was confident of norts @D suit|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|mrdct: i'm going to jump into the operating chair now - so i'll see you all on the other side shortly|pg||
nt|askgaard: Well done to escape for down one in 5@cX|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|redgrover: of course if nabil had found a fit here, game could have been easy -- his partner's major suit holding was a disappointment|pg||
nt|lestergold: the ht pips working in favour of the defence|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mmmakela: now 3xspades must stand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sounds like we need another Buller/Culbertson match.|pg||
nt|sac: only one down in 5clubs, and this could go more than 2 down now I think, so maybe I was wrong (not the first time)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marlowepi: was probably worried about squeezing dummy|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good play by Huang to not cover the 9. that made N think that W's remaining spade was the 8 or ten|pg||
nt|robinswr: tse is counting points and doesn't think his partner has any|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure why N played the ten of diamonds on the first round. that gave away a lot of information|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm told the other table is in 6S...I assume that suggests a big swing to USA Hampson|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: youngster in deep trouble in danger not to be in the first 16|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mildredb: now for the @S plays|pg||
pc|h6|nt|robinswr: but he has to lead a heart or a club and a club will defenently give up a trick|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gowdy: well done by south in setting a very hard auction |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the next few hands will wake u up George :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mariner1: in other match Cayne 16  India 4 after 5 boards|pg||

pc|s8|pc|d2|nt|santyclz: All roads seem to lead to -1.|pg||

pc|s7|nt|mariner1: so J@D was played trick one........ players do not show the operator their cards, and|pg||
nt|mariner1: often hide them|pg||
nt|me argent: :(|pg||

pc|c6|pc|h7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry i dont but i would make a try with east hand i might have bid stayman also rathe than transfer|pg||
nt|aupillon: and on 2 diamonds you say what ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: east must make a try|pg||
nt|aupillon: certainly he does|pg||
nt|henryb: he looks accross the table and raises his eyebrows. Then using olde-English signalling methods, partner takes the cards below the table and when they come back up he|pg||
nt|henryb: is holding hem with four fingers behind the back|pg||
nt|aupillon: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i recall the last time i commentated on a portugese event i was struck by the timidity of some of the bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: naughty, Henry|pg||

nt|marlowepi: not too often you go down 500 in 4NT when you would probably be +600 in 3NT. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: George - getting back to the former greats from Canada - have you read the book about Murray-Kehela?|pg||
nt|woozle: Now some game for NS - 4H or 3NT will likely make|pg||
nt|redgrover: australian open team has just dropped out of the 16, but the youth are still fine at this point|pg||
nt|othered1: just another push|pg||
nt|me argent: en fin|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I see|pg||
nt|lestergold: a few extra keys came into play|pg||
nt|dburn: it doesn't - it's just the operators trying to catch up with events since the power cut|pg||
mb|p|nt|mittmouse: y a very good book|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: he he had stripped the diamonds, he would have gone down only one|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: the old adage is "when id doubt, run the long suit". amazing things can happen|pg||
nt|robinswr: i agree|pg||
nt|imp_jan: partscore battle on this one|pg||
nt|woozle: something like 3 passes, 1H:1NT then North's best guess...or maybe a 2NT opening|pg||
nt|gowdy: and now    can we find 4 @H|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like another 2-suited raise|pg||
nt|shevek: 16+16|pg||
mb|p|nt|mittmouse: two great characters|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is where the all purpose strong hand double is handy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing team out, winning team one more chance. In fact, teams from the lower must win all of it from now on to win the event|pg||
nt|mariner1: big 5 imps there|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: i was hoping you'd say otherwise -- every time i try to buy it the dealer is sold out :(|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Might not even be a partscore battle|pg||
nt|woozle: 2NT probably kills thoughts of 4H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if this is a 1@C opener then my point on last hand was right|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open W bid 2 @H here......|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland its 9 a.m. and i a havent had my ugly sleep yet|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Repeating, I believe the score is Netherlands 42 - England 43|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: West flew the white flag ... as would I|pg||
nt|imp_jan: peace full person: tom townsend|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are in 6@H on board 4, focus now on the lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|redgrover: semi forcing means you can pass with a 5332 12-count|pg||
nt|mariner1: the youth are now in 15th spot however Yeh is 14 so they have a one spot cushion|pg||
nt|mariner1: left|pg||
nt|sac: 2spades was a bit timid I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Total prize fund  US$ 168,000  (winners 70 K)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: These two teams are in the undefeated pool and the losers will get one more chance tomorrow|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can make 3 of a minor|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is a roland favourite a 20/20 hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: another slam hand|pg||
nt|frankaus: the live scoring service is excellent - can view scores for the whole 12 tables |pg||
nt|mildredb: they are playin 2 way stayman|pg||
nt|gowdy: I guess 3nt is OK as well|pg||
nt|me argent: carruthers 1@C opening is weinsteins fault he opens all flat hands that way|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Roland|pg||
mb|3H|nt|santyclz: 5 loser hand.  Many places that's a 2@c bid, but frequently not in the USA.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=any 16+ ,  1N=8+ BAL, game force|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@D might have pushed N/S overboard - but it might also have resulted in -200, in 2@DX|pg||
nt|mildredb: 2@D = GF|pg||
nt|dburn: East unwilling to open a Multi with a maximum, some defensive stuff, and a hand playable in three suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi roland ur favourite hwere 20/20!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: the best I can tell the results link is not current|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: 4H is awkward on a spade lead...have to play clubs for the spade pitch immediately|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jbgood: why?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: really im happy to hear that call roy hughes hell send u a copy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H looks natural but may be asking bid|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: very courageous bid by South |pg||
nt|redgrover: what to lead from three aces and the trump queen?|pg||
nt|me argent: double is a  @S transfer i believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: one road leads to + one:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: When I make that lead, declarer has kx.|pg||
nt|dburn: but his side may not now compete high enough|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The chance of both sides having 20 hcp is roughly 6.963%|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: - Running Scores refresh as needed|pg||

nt|woozle: entries awkward in 3NT also, but easiest to trust in the heart break|pg||
nt|gowdy: 5 @H 2@S 2@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: can make now|pg||
nt|redgrover: a very understandable lead, but an unlucky one|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S isn't a bad save over makable 4@H.  |pg||
nt|othered1: of course, they weren't in 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: For us beginners, what would you pitch from dummy on the last 2 @ds?|pg||
nt|lestergold: without some help from tom i dont see how david could bid again|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this should be down one|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS likely winning 6+ imps here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: conceivably more|pg||
nt|dburn: how will they do that?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rogerclee: i dislike this pass by west|pg||
nt|me argent: and 1@S shows 3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: club ace, so slam will make|pg||
pc|d6|nt|robinswr: grue will strip the hand and try to put west in to lead a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D looks like asking bid response -- showing primary @H support and ??? maybe > 10 hcp|pg||
nt|imp_jan: for the moment we have new event leaders: the team of mr yeh himself. he just took over from meckwel c.s.: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=20...|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 09&dir=yeh&E=0&R=5&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the @H play is key|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, that was the problem i mentioned. the hope is that the foes will be more inconvenienced by the long suit than dummy will|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe the defenders will fail to cash their seven top tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: wasting no time this ensures the defeat|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh @S run, sorry,,,,, paying too much attention to @H :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or their 11|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed|pg||
nt|mariner1: I too have been up all day and night with Mike :)|pg||
nt|dburn: but perhaps South will conclude that West would have led a heart if he did not have the ace|pg||
pc|c5|nt|me argent: by south that is|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rogerclee: going for a penalty at the 3-level at this vulnerability cannot be the percentage action|pg||
nt|rogerclee: even if your LHO is joe grue ;)|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh!!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: not sure about the rest :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: more than  mere defeat6|pg||
nt|dburn: or perhaps he will not|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mariner1: 8@H big card if he gets to dummy, Q@C helps now|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: standard count|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sunsamvar: or 3+ controls|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: if so - that is modification from original asking bids|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: the rest must be cuebids|pg||
nt|pbundy: looks like an imp for china here|pg||
nt|askgaard: Signal for clubs apparently at trick 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: ignominous defeat |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugrapha3: they whispered something, couldn't hear ,sry|pg||
nt|robinswr: but at least he could have stripped the diamonds so the opponents would have to give up a trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North can't guess wrong in @D -- for me E would hold @DAQ or split honors and I wouldn't be able to guess right|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sunsamvar: he will find out as much as he can abt the E/W distribution before tackling @D..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer will give himself an extra chance in @C, but when Jack doesn't fall - @D from dummy then worry, then glee|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sunsamvar: but u r right Al i will get it wrong too if the @D honours were split|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bjacobs: 3 tricks to go - I think Jan might play on diamonds now|pg||
nt|redgrover: maybe you could argue that east is likely to have values outside spades, so a minor ace is best -- against that, there could be a spade ruff|pg||
nt|askgaard: Nice defense|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|dburn: mind you, East ought to cash that other spade soon|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She will then look to play 2 rounds of trumps - ducking one round, and then playing the ace.  THEN she can play her good heart|pg||
nt|gowdy: the fall back is jx of clubs|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk4: R5: England v Stansby and Lavazza v Shanghai Pudong|pg||
nt|lestergold: first 11 rather than failing to cash first seven david!|pg||
pc|c7|nt|frankaus: it is possible to view the results of all 24 piairs on a single board  - eg at http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=0&R=1&B=1&T=O|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mildredb: probably more than 1|pg||
nt|mildredb: not now :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: However, East will probably play a club here, hoping for a promotion|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West's @S8 is insufficient|pg||
nt|pbundy: 11 on top - no?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|santyclz: NEXT!|pg||
nt|mildredb: don't understnad not pitching @H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: and making for imps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 9 of spades very confusing lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: Although, now it's rather tricky for declarer|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|santyclz: NEXT!|pg||
nt|woozle: West under pressure here...an overtrick is available unless he pitches the diamond ace|pg||
pc|d8|nt|woozle: Did Joe really claim 10?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Grue is entertaining to watch, he commentates on the hand during the play and provides lengthy post mortems|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he claimed 4 only after asking to look at McGann's hand|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|bjacobs: That was well navigated by North.  One of the more interesting 1@S contracts|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its only fifties but a lot of em|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: the real question is, was there a way that playing a spade and NOT running diamonds could GAIN|pg||

nt|henryb: more slams|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one thing about that hand was the total lack of wastage in clubs   |pg||
nt|henryb: why would you want to avoid 6@s|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|aupillon: because i'm getting used they don't call games or slams...:)|pg||
nt|henryb: or 6N for that matter|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this one will surely be bid|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|aupillon: 1 SPADE with A BOMB|pg||
nt|lestergold: the game or the slam Mike?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: slam|pg||
nt|aupillon: if they stop in...No, no...|pg||
mb|3D|nt|aupillon: 51/2 diamonds, now|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|aupillon: cool 3NT|pg||

nt|aupillon: Quantitative ? I passssss|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4n is this blackwood with a void or quantitative?|pg||
nt|aupillon: for me, Q|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|aupillon: ouf|pg||
nt|lestergold: either way it is beyond my understanding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that looks rather quantitative|pg||
mb|6S|nt|aupillon: mine either|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|aupillon: hourray|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well south didnt think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: and although it is quantitative because they havent agree d a suit it wasnt for them it was blackwood for sure|pg||
nt|aupillon: If in doubt, always give your Aces... ( a friend of mine, ...)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wouldn't bother with the diamonds - spades is what the North hand is about|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|aupillon: thanks opps. Next|pg||
nt|lestergold: well all problems solved at trick 1|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||

nt|ahollan1: well played -- and @D position reveals itself because West couldn't hold onto @Dspot card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: freely bid 3N down 5 vul -- that's one you don't see every day - if you're lucky|pg||
nt|mildredb: i think he could have made 12 had he pitched @H & not @S|pg||
nt|mildredb: the JT of @S came down|pg||
nt|pbundy: you may be correct, mildred|pg||
nt|mariner1: E in 1N there in Open|pg||
nt|fabsayc: down 4?|pg||
nt|lestergold: certi but am clumsy on a keyboard|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mittmouse: a little high at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: then can navigate to the next board by selecting next board|pg||
nt|jbgood: big business|pg||
nt|mittmouse: it may be a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if this 1N is 13-15, 14-16 or 15-17  :(|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: with a 15-17 1nt opening by south north may be tempted to bid the vul game|pg||
nt|pbundy: here's a very lucky slam that i surely would not expect anyone to reach|pg||
nt|mildredb: lucky slam|pg||
nt|gowdy: to watch perhaps  that would bug me|pg||
nt|mrdct: The official website is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ which has live scores from all matches, a webcam and other goodies.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: but i did miss a trick and a half|pg||
nt|sac: NS was not on the same trck here it seems about the lenghts of North¬¥s suits|pg||
nt|mariner1: in other match Netherlands 27  Australia 7 after 5 boards|pg||
nt|lestergold: i thought down 5|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6h plus 5 spades|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: will check|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mmmakela: 3 dias the winner here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i didnt see tom discard any winners|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mmmakela: no partscore hands lately|pg||
nt|jbgood: minor slam interest - not what S can handle|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: boye's hand poised over his bidding box|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4@h seems the place to be|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: nope|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so far these deals would be better fare for a Board-a-Match event|pg||
nt|mildredb: yes the 21 hcp slams are not usually bid|pg||
nt|woozle: 5S safe for EW, but how much bidding will Joe do with his 6/5?|pg||
nt|woozle: I assume that 2NT is some kind of good raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS in a part score here|pg||
nt|askgaard: Every hand is suitable for a NT opening these days :)|pg||
mb|d!|nt|sunsamvar: but here the precision 1 nt may apply the brakes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs a 10 bagger to make this|pg||
nt|sac: Interesting 2nt What is the range supposed to be?|pg||
nt|shevek: I like 2N a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: nice solution to the bid problem|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: brogeland just made a belated alert of 4@S and is talking in sigh language to west|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: *sign|pg||
nt|jbgood: no good supp in minors - still good in spades - interested if prd has a good minor suit|pg||
nt|imp_jan: interesting rebid: 2@c, some would rebid 1n|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|salokin: not needed :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: was -5|pg||
nt|mariner1: will E pop 3@H now?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|imp_jan: i am not sure if 2@h is f...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Grue just said "Contract"|pg||
nt|woozle: Redouble won't turn West on particularly|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D is an interesting treatment here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: difficult to grasp this for a youngster as Espen Lindqvist..|pg||
nt|mittmouse: as long as 3c is not forcing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Surely yes|pg||
nt|salokin: 3@D I mean|pg||
nt|shevek: who cares abt range with that @c suit|pg||
mb|4N|nt|imp_jan: but here we are|pg||
nt|mildredb: nothing to the play on this hand|pg||
nt|woozle: Although I notice that 6S makes easily on a heart lead|pg||
nt|gowdy: easily is an overbid :0|pg||
nt|askgaard: Don't know the range, but probably 20-21|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: six dias great contract but this time....|pg||
nt|jbgood: what did i know:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: May get a @c lead now.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: lindqvist looks like he knows what he,s doing|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: haha|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i understand all of the PASSes|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i guess u cant stop short of 3nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well maybe not, but this duck makes no sense|pg||

nt|fabsayc: italian mexican :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: where are they going to play?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mmmakela: now a danger|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not to cash out I mean|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They need to get their tricks fast or lose them|pg||
nt|salokin: S will proably duck the lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes - on bidding unlikely that EW have a 4-4 @S fit|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he knows it's his turn :)|pg||
nt|askgaard: Here it made things simple|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Should it not make?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the open room Kit Woolsey says that the percentage play in diamond is low to the 9 spot|pg||
nt|jbgood: not only what he is doing - but what he and prd are doing together:)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: even more important|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not many losers ... but are there 10 winners?|pg||

nt|woozle: not hard to place the hearts on the auction|pg||

nt|woozle: win the heart, two spades ending in dummy, heart up...if ducked, another spade across and another heart up|pg||

nt|dburn: but he may not need it|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is an ugly looking spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes not a lot of winners|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hard to analyze, i will guess 2 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: why 4/3 fit insted of 6/2 fit |pg||
nt|dburn: doubtless South intended this sequence to show three diamonds and five or six hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: of course no dbl|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kit: the reason I think low to 9 is right play in slam is that it will be tough for East to duck from King-doubleton|pg||
nt|me argent: or 6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: one objective of the treatment is to rightside contracts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: so if 9 loses to jack, I would then take finesse on way back|pg||
nt|santyclz: Isn't the normal play leading the 9 from dmy?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so not pecentage play but best play?|pg||
nt|rogerclee: even if yeh knew his partner had a doubleton diamond, ducking seems wrong|pg||
nt|mwigor: indeed that happened in the other room and they are playing 5@c|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: overtake and play @D to show @S reentry|pg||
nt|shevek: if north opens a @c EW might finet their @s fit...|pg||
nt|mwigor: 1@c 1@h (X) 3@c (4@s) 5@c|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: players taking a short break now|pg||
nt|shevek: Very clever bid .. and got the lead she deserved! (from a spec)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We will not necessarily continue with the same matches on vugraph in the second half. Organisers will decide when they see all first half scores|pg||
nt|Walddk4: From the upper bracket: Yeh vs Sweden 8-1 after 5 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Unfortunately we have no running scores from other matches at this point|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are working on it|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: players back now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|imp_jan: sure|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer needs to draw trumps ending in dummy.  This hand is a bit trickier than it looks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jbgood: bye all - enjoy the show from Down Under:) |pg||
nt|marlowepi: what was the double of 3D? would 3H be invitational?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: suitplay says low to 9 and if it loses to J, cash A|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok believe, dbl finesse close 2nd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: East should know not to duck any @C|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bjacobs: That play works as well|pg||
pc|s6|nt|redgrover: a couple of hours ago the youth were dreaming of a spot in the top bracket, how quickly things change|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mittmouse: if he cashes his hearts he wins the board or 3 imps|pg||
nt|gowdy: and so it shall be|pg||
nt|me argent: good start for NA|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kit: suitplay thinks that East will always duck from Kx -- in real life, that ain't so|pg||
nt|santyclz: Bye Jon, thanks.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it is more common to play that dbl would be an invitation and 3H purely competitive|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Grue discussing with dummy now, quietly, that this contract is cold|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Cheek didnt play a card but McGann claimed|pg||
nt|redgrover: still a 5-VP buffer at the moment though|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 1 down|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 now|pg||
nt|dburn: but North may have interpreted 2NT followed by 3@d as a "bad 3@d bid" wheres a direct 3@d would have been a "good 3@d bid"|pg||
nt|dburn: very thoughtful play, in truth|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz: Normal play in 7 is the Q from dmy.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So there is a psychological factor to be considered too|pg||
nt|lestergold: david obviously doesnt believe that there are 6 hearts in the south hand!|pg||
nt|dburn: I know how many hearts South has|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: scores finally up http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=3&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is another david around |pg||
nt|dburn: but you asked why 3@d instead of 3@h, and I am trying to tell you|pg||
nt|lestergold: the one who is sitting in theeast seat|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh crossed wires david|pg||
pc|h3|nt|imp_jan: in the crossruff|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oops|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gib says diamond 2 for down 3 now, fascinating|pg||
nt|dburn: and don't believe the results anyway|pg||
nt|mariner1: scoreboard has scores different from ours|pg||
pc|h4|nt|robinswr: this time he's runing the diamonds|pg||
pc|h9|pc|sJ|nt|imp_jan: cash diamonds first of course (just happened)|pg||
nt|me argent: should be tough 2 make from here|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to hold Qx Jxx @S to no losers|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Stansby got to set up @D's for @C pitches other room it seems|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mariner1: official score is not up to the minute and youth are in big trouble|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the scoreboard believes that on board 3 England gained 500 on a board where they in fact lost 500|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bravo|pg||
nt|lestergold: welyes he has consultedf gib!|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: diamonds can blind foes like no other suit|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|mariner1: whats GIB?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: tom must have a reason for not following david 's defence but i cannot see what that reason is|pg||

pc|c8|pc|d6|pc|c7|pg||

nt|ahollan1: did i miss something?  maybe @SJ was NOT discarded|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6 was dual part score swing so 6 more imps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: -1 probably|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: room has been told a little behind the over rate |pg||
mb|2S|nt|santyclz: Speaking of @ds...|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i think it is practical to just transfer to 3c opposite a 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: 3 boards to go in this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Wild match, 7 imps in 7 boards.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: especially if transfer is 2@S so opener can show/deny @C support|pg||
nt|woozle: NS can make 3C, EW might make 2H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that's a big 13 bad def other room good here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H on the Moysian played well in Open|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Not many deals to stir the blood on this set|pg||
nt|pbundy: perhaps they play varying NT ranges with either seat and/or vulnerability|pg||
nt|woozle: 1C opening probably ends any thoughts of NS playing clubs|pg||
nt|redgrover: one team that is in serious trouble is italy-lavazza, needing 43 VPs from this match|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D off in Open was good defense|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|marlowepi: it is always annoying to have more points crammed into two suits that total 3 cards than in the ten cards of the other two suits. but W will cope with the disappointment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ah -- confirmation that @SJ did win a trick -- not discarded|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What's the rebid here?|pg||
nt|gowdy: and Mec went domn in 6 @S  whata swing  on 25|pg||

nt|mariner1: live results (almost up to date)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|imp_jan: shaken not stirred|pg||
nt|dburn: that was a 14-16 no trump at the other table|pg||
mb|4S|nt|frankaus: today is not the day to bid 7@D - so far :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: When this gets passed out, South will be aghast|pg||
nt|mmmakela: check the 109's in N hand|pg||
nt|askgaard: Some might be tempted to invite game opposite the 15-17NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: that reopening double puzzles me|pg||
nt|robinswr: not sure why hampson reopened with a double|pg||
nt|robinswr: it is a takeout double but when does he expect to make a game|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: an imp here for aussie youth if this makes|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S sure seems easier|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 3@S not the spot|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3 will be a breeze and more out|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like it takes a @H lead to beat 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: And indeed, 3NT makes easily on this layout|pg||
nt|mariner1: 43 VP not possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5d needs a heart lead to defeat it surely|pg||
nt|dburn: and it wasn't obvious to pass it with the North cards, but no great harm done|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: what else could south bid over the 1@h response?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@D is a massive underbid ... but what alternative is there?  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: danger|pg||
nt|gowdy: down  got to get light in this room eh|pg||
nt|woozle: diamond lead leaves this with 6 losers|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: 1N transfer to @C?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: y |pg||
nt|redgrover: true, hence their being in serious trouble|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: lead here helps|pg||
nt|mariner1: found 7, looking for 8 and 9 now|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: West will duck the first @h and some homework for declarer|pg||
nt|me argent: thats an impressive OR result 4 the stanbys|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mcarroll: OR bid to 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: tom says lead a heart|pg||
nt|mariner1: might have been better to pass 3N|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe, but...|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1 prefer 1s over a heart becuase now he has to guess|pg||
nt|dburn: here, double shows 4-5 spades and double of 2@h shows three spades|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10 tricks was impressive|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe a heart switch now|pg||
nt|lestergold: landed on feet of course|pg||
nt|dburn: so no one actually had to guess anything|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A nice support double.  Everyone loves them, don't they?|pg||
nt|lestergold: apologies dabvid i suspected|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@s over 1@h would have denied spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2s better spot than a no trump|pg||
nt|lestergold: understand|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|askgaard: But Versace is probably right that it isn't worth it with his bad distribution and soft values|pg||
nt|askgaard: Same evaluation in the other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes if n/s are warned off but it will be a heart lead whatever they play in now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: 3NT suggested, and it certainly has some merit|pg||
nt|salokin: OR ended up in 4@H when W after the same bids jumped to 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a game of chicken|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: much better|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nice shift.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wonder if 3S denied 5H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suspect you are right|pg||
nt|lestergold: very good judgement by n/s |pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: interesting choice of leads rather than @D for a look|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: lol. west does not lead from @D ak and east leads from his q into a dangerous looking jtx|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but 4nt was not the tool here, aces not the issue|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a general invite of 5@S would be my choice|pg||
nt|mariner1: Youth currently tied with Australian Open for 15th|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: i guess that as long as bids like this double keep getting opps to do the wrong thing, NS will continue to make such bids|pg||
nt|rogerclee: if east showed exactly 4-4 in the majors i think west should not accept a slam try, he knows his hand is quite bad opposite a 44(32) slam try|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Pete is telling me good play by Stansby last hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: a good time to go chicken tho|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bjacobs: It's complicated by the 3-card heart support.  How about a wacky 2NT?|pg||
nt|mariner1: that is the practical correct play|pg||
nt|mariner1: sorry was telling a kibber how to make 4@S|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it does make sense - if North held KJx and East AQ10 - then need extra entry for 2nd @H through|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seamon did indeed switched to a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk4: switch|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lebridgeur: 2 @s tricks  2@h tricks and a @d will do the job|pg||
nt|mariner1: N in 3N here in Open too, @D lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mildredb: 2 more rounds  to Q - top 8 teams Q, unless Yeh Bros not in top 8, then the top 7 + Yeh Bros. team|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: Others might manufacture a jump shift.  2@S or 3@C, but that just postpones the crisis|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @SK to the ace, spade to the jack, @SQ and a heart|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|woozle: 2H will be claimed soon|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the actual layout is one of the few where no spade loser possible|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: :)  Sunil I hadn't even noticed dummy's @D10  --  sorry partner, I couldn't get a count on DUMMY|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mrdct: official website is http://www.yehcup09.com.au/ for live scores from all tables, a webcam and other goodies.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: perhaps a little bizar, but i would opt for 3@c|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i think two finesses is the % play|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sac: nice jack of diamonds|pg||

pc|d2|nt|santyclz: It look as if they're off the Schnieder.|pg||
nt|pbundy: different options for what declarer might do on this hand|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think 3@C is a lot better than 2@S ... you can always keep going back to diamonds over clubs|pg||
nt|askgaard: Right. North discarded the @h7 Roland, perhaps not so helpfull|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|nt|pbundy: better win the ace!|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i agree that the key is the dull shape of the W hand|pg||
nt|rogerclee: yes i think 5c is the correct bid|pg||
nt|pbundy: penultimate hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: the 4th heart in dummy was only good to throw his master diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a knockout match, but the losers will not be eliminated from the main competition|pg||
mb|p|nt|lebridgeur: another good result for NS  this board 8|pg||
nt|redgrover: have to hope justin makes this at the other table, or the kids are gone|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: that's what i mean and over 4@C you correct to 4@H|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S makeable if NS are amazingly aggressive|pg||
nt|mariner1: (I am pulling for the youth because I remember what it was like to be a young player|pg||
nt|mariner1: back before we had electricity :) )|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: another 7 to Standby who bid the 3 card @H suit and was raised|pg||
nt|mariner1: 68% vs 28% in favor of one hook no matter how often you can get to dummy|pg||
mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: i can accept 5@C also, but would bid 6 with marshall's example|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lebridgeur: what shouid west do tough ?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S is a good spot|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: well, my concern was that W might look first and foremost at his spades over 5S|pg||
nt|woozle: more likely one or two overtricks in 2S|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 boards to go and neck and neck my nerves cant take it|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: he should not (since we have KCB)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the ancient idea was that asks for good trumps, not really necessary these days|pg||
nt|rogerclee: east offering up a huge number here|pg||
nt|woozle: Hmm...reverse flannery in action?|pg||
nt|me argent: @S J loses and a @H ruff 4 down1|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: US|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: USA on a roll now.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh wow this is a steal it seems|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: highway robbery, 401 style|pg||
nt|mariner1: in the other match Yeh 26  i Norge 13 after 10 so I Norge has halved the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: the same contract being played in both rooms well i never|pg||
mb|3H|nt|robinswr: 4spades is rkc|pg||
nt|redgrover: should be duplicated at the other table, this might come down to the last board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D was a phantom, but difficult to know|pg||
nt|sac: phanton save in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: i will suggest the hand for the bidding panel of my magazine (IMP)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: was more than slam :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E bid according to the Lore of Total Tricks. The 2S raise was perhaps a bit adventurous at the colors. partner might easily end up bidding 4S to make and going down 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I'm told: he's been upgrading since he was 8. They say he missed his 1st slam at 16 :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 5 minutes of session time left|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a good one.  It's actually a version of what's called the Bridge World Nightmare Hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In the BWNH, you open 1@D on a strong hand, and partner responds in your 3-card major|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6 spades best?|pg||
nt|mildredb: at this point Yeh Bros stand 3 & China Long Ahu are tied for 8th|pg||
nt|gowdy: as we shall  see here 2@H is 54 10 hcp|pg||
nt|gowdy: better than passing it out !|pg||
nt|mariner1: same contract and the same way|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4c not quite what david was hoping for|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: McGann might have thrown this one in, for all the right reasons|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK, thanks. The winners are in good shape for some loot.  The losers will have to play the winner of Stansby - Norge|pg||
nt|lestergold: well nmo double no trouble or at least mot too much trouble|pg||
pc|h2|nt|frankaus: nice treatment here 2NT ask for short suit trial  - i expect|pg||
nt|imp_jan: meanwhile another bidding problem here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Over 2 decades, it's never been solved|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3n = good|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but how to reach it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6 looks good|pg||
nt|salokin: yep or 6N with the @HK in the leaders hand :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|robinswr: 4nt - 5nt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wow|pg||
nt|askgaard: Impossible not to bid 5@d here too with 5 card support|pg||
pc|h6|nt|robinswr: i play that 5nt shows the spade king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know entire structure, but  something like  15 teams qualify + Yeh Bros, then 2 brackets and sort of a double elimination|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Difficult from here|pg||
nt|rogerclee: yeah, i disagree with 2@S, though it is a good strategy to raise aggressively over an opponent's negative double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: vulnerability is for grownups|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that strategy pays off best, though, when there are TWO unbid majors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as in 1D-2C-D-3C|pg||
nt|shevek: since quite a few specs asked, I'll explain the format:|pg||
nt|shevek: Top 16 go through to the 32-board knockout stage, with the top 8 getting a double shot|pg||
nt|shevek: The 48-board final is on Monday|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N is looking for D ki8ng now|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffee hand folks well im off to make one|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, that was a mini no trump, a penalty double, a pre-emptive 3@d, a second takeout double, and a natural 4@c|pg||
nt|dburn: that's 21st century bridge, mister|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is likely togo a couple off|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Makes you pine for the 20th Century|pg||
nt|lestergold: and another few imps to the dutch|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz: A chance for Netherlands.|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect this will make|pg||
nt|redgrover: 3NT appears to be making on bd 8 at the other table, so the youth are still alive|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: just made   par for Ns again|pg||
pc|d4|nt|frankaus: mannopo finds the killing lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well that lead certainly gives declarer a chance to go down.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gowdy: nice @s guess :)|pg||
nt|woozle: It was going to be guessed later anyway|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: and credit Stansby for playing 4@S well too|pg||
nt|me argent: it should prove difficult for EW to get sufficent 50s to score well here|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|gowdy: and may come back if S thinks stiff Q|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: this could be interesting|pg||
pc|s9|nt|santyclz: No winning options.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our matches in round 2 in about half an hour are: China B vs Norway and USA Hampson (Meckwell) vs Chinese Taipei|pg||
nt|shevek: 1st stage was a 10 round delayed Swiss of 10-board matches|pg||
nt|askgaard: He knows he is dead. Just hoping for a heart endplay at the end.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a grosvenor|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|robinswr: in an IMP match one should discuss what bids mean|pg||
nt|mittmouse: are the italians really last wow|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I wonder at what point in the hand they realise "we wuz robbed"|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|robinswr: in slam auctions|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What's the coroner say about this "dead" contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe three off even certainly not too pretty for england|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, but for the power cut we would have known how North-South in the other room came to play in 2NT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mmmakela: needs to guess clubs I suppose in 3rd trick?|pg||
nt|frankaus: cant draw trumps - cant not draw trumps - no winning options|pg||
nt|mildredb: now a little to-ing & fro-ing :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: true, but even so, on what basis would S accept ANY grand slam try? could he have less?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Meckwell in 6@S, flirted with the grand|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes|pg||
pc|d7|nt|santyclz: I'm willing to make a prediction here.  This hand won't be finished before time is up.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mmmakela: right -1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R  for running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|h8|nt|me argent: im guessing 11 imps to NS|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c4|nt|santyclz: Has to draw trumps and play for the @ckxx onside.|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe Lasut will duck 2 @C LOL|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needs the @d finesse or 5@ss and the @dk in the same hand.|pg||
nt|mildredb: or not :)|pg||
nt|askgaard: But in this layout it won't be there.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: i think declarer needed to play top @S then 2nd round finesse|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dburn: but for the moment, we will assume that they were playing 22nd century bridge|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not exactly. it is not like you can preserve both possibilities. you will play for the diamond finesse, so it is 50% i think|pg||
nt|pbundy: well - with the club spots this might be safer route, actually|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u ruffs with his omeny now|pg||
nt|lestergold: money|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 off after all then|pg||
pc|s5|nt|frankaus: was a joke :)|pg||
nt|mildredb: true|pg||
pc|sA|nt|robinswr: you would take the diamond finesse since anything else is anti percenage|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: but with 4-1 @C, not sure if that that works|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 5@C has a better play, and would in fact have made (I think)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: oh no promotion 3 off|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gowdy: now 5|pg||
pc|d9|nt|imp_jan: this time probably yes|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|askgaard: Cashing the ace early to avoid an unblock|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: call it two and a half off, have a cup of coffee and try to calm down|pg||
nt|lestergold: well did you agree with david's second double ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes.  It was West's fault.  He didn't have a major|pg||
nt|bjacobs: N/S were just too tough|pg||
nt|lestergold: the two doubleton queens detracted somewhat from the value of the hand|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Very entertaining set. Board 10 is also exciting|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But it's hard to take aim at any bid in this auction.  Just a tough tough hand|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: andy making morse code signals on his head|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Youth are back into 14th with 2 boards to score!|pg||
nt|redgrover: the 4@H doesn't exactly improve his hand|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: I must admit it is difficult to find acll with west hand after 4 @d|pg||
nt|mariner1: Yeh is 16th so that does not help as there are now only 15 spots|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it's always a bit dodgey cueing shortage in partner's suit|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: * find a call|pg||

nt|askgaard: Me neither.|pg||
mb|5S|nt|imp_jan: 3n was in danger after the (unlikely) diamond lead|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but always made|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You'd think North would unleash a 5-card major probe, if South tends to open with a 6-card major :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The play is awkward for South.  He HAS to win a spade in dummy to take the heart finesse.  So what spade does he insert here?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: declarers problem is that if east comes in with @hk he might get diamonds through|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am dazzling the kibitzers here with my analysis|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open  1@H - P - 1N - 2@C - P - 2@S - P - 5@C P - 6@C in Open!|pg||
nt|askgaard: Time to stop now...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 9 imps back|pg||

nt|santyclz: Last chance for Netherlands this set.|pg||
nt|woozle: Might make 3|pg||
nt|redgrover: the chinese in 17th place have drifted down, so there is more breathing space now -- as long as the irish pair doesn't bid 6@C|pg||
nt|mwigor: which they have|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: may be   he gets it right     but @d is the best lead by far|pg||

nt|lestergold: well im not sure how 4h came to be doubled in the open room altho it happens to be 1 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|mildredb: the Spec have been very quiet tonight :)|pg||
nt|askgaard: Ok, so a sensible auction, I think|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mmmakela: guess 6 dias is makeable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not even bad enough to be a Roland slam.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Great slam|pg||
nt|yeh2009: Spade lead allows you to make 9 trums and a trump lead allows for ruffing heart finesse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This hand is a case in point.  E/W allowed N/S to push them around.  Look at what happens to 5@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm not saying East should have bid it ... but he must have been at least a bit tempted|pg||
pc|d3|nt|santyclz: This is the last bd of this match.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: most partnerships i know would not be able to get to this comfortable 2C contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1nt was pretty comfortable also|pg||
nt|mariner1: only a 1 VP edge,,,, so................|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: If only the Dutch could have avoided the 7-level, they would have had a fine match|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well he takes his 75 % chance|pg||
nt|salokin: another slamish hand 12 tricks on 2 of 3 finesses ... except a bad @H break|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: well that will cost a lot to australian young tema      NS  played perfectly as Hanlan and Mc Gann ireland in OR|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: 7@D down twice |pg||
pc|h2|nt|imp_jan: @hk left or ace of diamonds rigth|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fair enough|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was just so messy to take the heart finesse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, he's still only got 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So the whole hand is messier than my son's bedroom.  And that's saying something|pg||
nt|imp_jan: lol|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but decl is still in control due to the fav lay out|pg||

nt|pbundy: in shock after 2@DX earlier on.........  that was a spectacular hand|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: norway now in 17th and like to win at least a game swing on this board as their opps stopped in 3@C|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: 5@C asking for @D back|pg||
nt|lestergold: in spite of the high card majority in the e/w hands not clear what they would have pl;ayed in if they had come into the auction|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear that it does - a diamond to the ace and @cQ ruffed may be enough for the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: well england now desperately in need of a couple of good boards|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h5|nt|santyclz: Thanks to my excellent fellow commentators, Marshall and Steve.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the unblocking in diamonds was not just showing off. N has organized the play so that E would have to make 2 discards while seeing only one card from E|pg||

nt|henryb: the other room has East playing 2N doubled with an ovrtrick!|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: West does not know how strong his partner is - East is not a passed hand. Must be worried about 4@S/6@S, but the sight od dummy will alleviate those anxieties |pg||

nt|bjacobs: 6 boards to go.  PLENTY of time Mike :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not in this tuiff close match|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And surely N/S will stuff something up.  They haven't yet, so on the Law of Averages, it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: is going to happen soon|pg||
nt|dburn: not all that many years ago, this would have been passed out round the room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nowadays it's bid to a N/S game?|pg||
nt|dburn: but that was then, and this is now...|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if we are to be philosophical now will very soon become then|pg||
mb|2D!|an|multi|nt|dburn: well, there are six more in this segment|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S play better than 1N here NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and sixteen in the next|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S NS play better I meant than 1N EW|pg||
mb|2H|nt|askgaard: Very close match. The players have mostly taken similar actions in the two rooms so far.|pg||
nt|dburn: not if no one bids at all, it won't|pg||
mb|p|nt|askgaard: Hi Kit|pg||
nt|mariner1: not a lot makes now NS (nada)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S as in Open reasonable spot|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S much better than 2nt however|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south hand has potential in poker|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would not consider passing 1N with N hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: again, double shows 4 or 5 spades|pg||
mb|2N|nt|askgaard: Lauria has never been shy to overcall on very minimal values|pg||
nt|kit: likely to get to 3NT one way or another|pg||
nt|kit: probably 3@C by North, 3NT by South|pg||
nt|dburn: and 1NT is alerted because it does not necessarily show a heart stop|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: light 2@C, only the void makes it attractive|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think we learned the bid david|pg||
mb|p|nt|askgaard: Versace knows their style of course, so he won't hang him|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c may be for the majors, and 2@d may be the prelude to a game try in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes however the void is there|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: and  for garbage stayman|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w have the high card points but n/s have better prosects in their spade fit that e/w in their dim fit|pg||
pc|d5|nt|me argent: but i think JC chose the correct route|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I have a friend (in the audience) who claims that a final contract of 2NT is not in his system.  2NT Is ALWAYS forcing|pg||
nt|dburn: and 2NT shows optimism, and pass shows pessimism|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the spade suit is what s working well for declarer here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sac: maybe 3 hearts is a better call now than 3nt|pg||
nt|kit: they didn't exactly right-side this, but difficult to do when hearts, not diamonds, is the worry suit|pg||
nt|askgaard: Trying to get partner to bid 3NT on @hQx, S√∏ren?|pg||
nt|kit: problem with bidding 3@H is that if pard has nothing in hearts she won't bid 3NT, and 3NT is gone forever|pg||
nt|sac: yes|pg||
nt|sac: not after 3 spades which should be waiting|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: live scoring is now up on the website|pg||
nt|kit: why should it be waiting when partner has bid spades?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R  for running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yikes|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S has a tough road though|pg||
nt|dburn: and North, with all those extra values...|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 4s looks a bit too much work to do|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that lead didnt exactly hur|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mariner1: S needed to pay attention to the 1N behind him|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: Versace decided a heart lead would be futile, so he led a diamond hoping his partner had 5 of them I guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: three diamond leads will promote a trump trick|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes S has a good high/low split pot hand|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: - Running Scores refresh as needed - most of the matches are still very close|pg||
nt|me argent: reversing dummy looks rgt|pg||
nt|mariner1: he only holds 3 king and big hand behind|pg||
pc|h2|pc|cQ|pc|hA|nt|lestergold: so this board will not produce much honey for anyone|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: well establishing the heart suit is one thing- enjoying it may be another thing|pg||
nt|mariner1: Fudd's Law teaches position is everything :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: tom needs to continue punching dummy with diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i thought location was everything, but maybe that no longer applies|pg||
nt|dburn: it was perfectly normal for South, with kings in both his partner's suits, to issue a game invitation|pg||
nt|mariner1: Push something hard enough and it will fall over. - Sir Sidney Fudd's First Law of|pg||
nt|mariner1: Opposition|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|askgaard: It was not realistic to find partner with a good enough suit AND and entry to the hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: newton thought of it first|pg||
nt|dburn: it was close to ridiculous for North to accept it, but in these recessionary times one bids game on every hand and hopes that there will be a play for it|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep this must be the winning defence|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wish 2NT was all they could make.  Then I could wheel out a comment that I have in reserve ...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|askgaard: (an)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: the hand is unmanageable now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: "They stopped at the Brink"|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|dburn: one might charitably suggest to your friend that if 2NT were on occasion not forcing, he might one of these days find himself at the table rather than in the audience|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes seems like two invitational only hands accept too often|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well 3@S was not making either|pg||
nt|mariner1: 18 imps in 10 compares is very tight....... and only a 4 imp lead........|pg||

nt|dburn: he bid spades because he had them, and he bid them again because he still had them|pg||
nt|imp_jan: did 1n promised 3@s?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all doubles after penalty double should be penalty (somebody's law)|pg||
nt|dburn: yes|pg||
nt|po-s: and he had nothing else either|pg||

pc|s8|nt|sac: no|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am pretty confident that Versace's pass is forcing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that may help|pg||
nt|fabsayc: very scarey|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another unreadable lead|pg||
nt|me argent: dangerous lead 4 the defence|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike your son bids what he has :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: this illustrates the problems with doubling an opening 1NT with a distributional hand -- you don't know what to do after that.|pg||
nt|dburn: ..well, we shall see|pg||
pc|dA|nt|askgaard: Right|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is going to be a nailbiter|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dburn: not that it will do him a power of good - surely even Brink will pass this double|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this could be interesting|pg||
nt|lestergold: disaster for england in open room so this looks like a fair sized swing to the dutch|pg||
nt|dburn: if declarer does make it, that might be too much for England to recover|pg||
nt|dburn: and this lead will help|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed david which is why its a nailbiter for those of us who may be a little biassed|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|askgaard: If they play takeout'ish doubles, east might have doubled because of the vulnerability|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: He might -- but he knows his partner will be expecting a second diamond|pg||
nt|imp_jan: after the lead, will north work out that south had a stiff heart?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can beat this two, but probably wont|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S play means a lot here|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think outh will be fooled by tom's mandatory false card|pg||
nt|lestergold: i meant north|pg||
nt|dburn: well, there are one or two Dutch spectators here also (among them the mother of the current declarer) but it is up to us ruthlessly to suppress partisan feelings and to commentate ...|pg||
nt|dburn: dispassionately upon the play|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an easy hand to manage|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: and for all he knows they have a 9-card heart fit|pg||
nt|mariner1: will cash out for off 1 now.......... or should|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: while versace was thinking what card to play North sort of claimed down 1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1 IMP difference between setting it one or two tricks. 12-13|pg||
nt|dburn: that's a pretty dispassionate effort, Mike - well done|pg||
pc|dK|nt|askgaard: yes. If both players are overreaching to penalize it will sometimes be disastrous|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Versace said "I never seen in my life", I think referring to the lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 boards, 11 imps, still close|pg||
nt|imp_jan: next brd seems good for england|pg||
nt|lestergold: my commentary is designed to be dispassionate my feelings about the desired outcome are not|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess East will play a trump here - nothing else looks remotely attractive|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dburn: mind you, this line of defence...|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|askgaard: A lot of work to do here.|pg||
nt|kit: even on actual hand, if East had doubled is it so clear for West to pass?  Why couldn't East's hearts and spades have been reversed?|pg||
nt|sac: you got a point Kit|pg||
nt|kit: Can he handle this -- 1 club trick, 1 spade trick, 2 diamond tricks, so he needs 6 trump tricks|pg||
nt|askgaard: Vul vs Not it would be automatic to pass a takeout double in west (although it work badly of course)|pg||
nt|askgaard: (might work)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bjacobs: well, it was only a guess|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|kit: I believe a spade to king was necessary there|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, JoAnna could have pitched a club|pg||
nt|kit: joanna did well to pitch a spade it seems to me|pg||
nt|kit: But if he had led a spade, North can win, play ace and a heart, and declarer is a trick short|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But a diamond ruff now will see him home|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Because North must follow to the next club too|pg||
nt|sac: he is home now if he plays diamond and then ruff clubs|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: That's why a club pitch had been better before|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then JoAnna could have overruffed the last club|pg||
nt|kit: will overruffing the last club defeat the contract?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, then exit in trump and declarer must lose 2 spades|pg||
nt|kit: but can play a spade after second club ruff I believe|pg||
nt|sac: if you guess hearts you coul make 4 hearts by playing a spade from dummy instead of a diamond|pg||
nt|sac: early on|pg||
nt|kit: so I think declarer can succeed -- if North pitches a spade, do what he is doing.  If North pitches a club, then ruff another club and play a spade up?|pg||

nt|imp_jan: diamond exit|pg||

mb|1D|nt|bjacobs: Fortunately for audience, I think I've run out of feeble puns.  But East still is an option for me|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|dburn: well, maybe North would have thrwon @cQ on that diamond|pg||
nt|imp_jan: west went down in the open room after a diamond lead by north and missguessing the suit afterwards|pg||
nt|lestergold: u are mum??|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dburn: one will never know|pg||
mb|3D|nt|imp_jan: in 3nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: well mrs. Drijver likes ur puns|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: he finessed @d10..|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: hi all sorry being late |pg||
nt|askgaard: As pointed out, south would probably have ruffed in with the @hJ if he had it, but still|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oops sorry wrong room |pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead to beat 6@D|pg||
nt|patricck: finessing for 10@D after South dropped the Q@D on 2nd round|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open was off 1 in 3N and got a @D lead|pg||
nt|dburn: well now...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This was a necessary contract |pg||
nt|dburn: there is a case for leading a spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and there is a case for leading a heart|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But which heart?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: but hes not on our team david so he led a hearty|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Something fairly disappointing is going to happen here for the Dutch|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but which heart?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And declarer will find himself seeking out either spade queen or diamond king for the contract|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: Looks like declarer will just have to hope that both red suit finesses are on -- I don't see anything else|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mariner1: well I am assuming N would rise 1st @H too and he might not|pg||
nt|me argent: @H lead beats it also|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm it looks like the favourabkle dim position should mean 9 tricks available|pg||
nt|patricck: actually was @D lead, but play could go as suggested on a different lead as well|pg||
nt|dburn: what favourable diamond position?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south off to the best lead for teh defence|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In fact, North needs to take this, to leave him with an exit card|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: north i mean|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|imp_jan: interesting that a diamond lead is 'killing'|pg||
pc|c2|nt|me argent: any lead providing north doesnt play high in @Hs|pg||
nt|mariner1: E playing 3N in Open|pg||
nt|mariner1: a @H was led in Open|pg||
nt|po-s: 4th best is not best|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: tom will be forced to play for the only position which makes namely the dim position|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: a kelsey twist, will likely make on this more normal lead|pg||
nt|dburn: again - what diamond position?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If declarer had played a lower club, it might have been all over|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What will Townsend pitch on the 4th heart I wonder?  What a hand!|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mariner1: win this in hand , lead @H|pg||
nt|dburn: that thought before playing @hQ was because Brink recognised that his partner might have led from @hAJ93|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|lestergold: 3/3 break with q onside|pg||
nt|imp_jan: south inserted the queen, though double dummy the ten was better..|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: in which case...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: I thing he should have led jack of clubs from hand -- the way he played it, he might have had entry problems to dummy if North had A9xx of clubs|pg||
nt|mariner1: no he will run @D 1st it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: hell pitch a dim cash the clubs and then take as informed a view as he can abou the spades|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: yes, I know, but after you have led to the jack and cashed the king on which South plays the queen - what diamond position?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: still dummy is squeezed a little|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mariner1: the 4th @c squeezes S too,,,,,, even with a @S pitch|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: now heart|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly at this level you should play to drop the ten, but...|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c7|nt|imp_jan: declarer seems on track|pg||
nt|lestergold: tom doesnt want to ive up the chance of dropping heart ten|pg||
nt|mariner1: Townsend played another tough one earlier.....|pg||
nt|mariner1: board 3 was very difficult to make|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that the entries are a bit on the awkward side for West to find out in time that North has only two hearts|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 20 mins till end of this set|pg||
nt|patricck: Is there any possibility that boards will be withdrawn?  England would hate to lose board 16, they finished with a ripper|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the natural spade return is best|pg||
nt|lestergold: why is north contemplating anhything other than the spade|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a heart return he plays spade to king and diamond to jack|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: now must commit to the dim|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|askgaard: Maybe, not so important since north would have to lead a red suit anyway at the end then.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d5|nt|dburn: because he is wondering (correctly) whether a heart will create more or fewer communication problems|pg||
nt|imp_jan: on dk south shld play dq|pg||
nt|po-s: If he should return a heart declarer has time to discover that North has two hearts and might guess diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think he will guess them anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: should he really? well, there's a thing!|pg||
nt|mariner1: cash K@D and @SA then should have picture|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but not quickly|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s8|pc|d6|nt|mariner1: Q@D nice pitch|pg||
nt|lestergold: tom still has losing options|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes q dim of cours automatic false card tho|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: I guess that is true|pg||
nt|othered1: still has @H guess, knowing south has 2 left|pg||
nt|kit: odd cashing queen of diamonds -- now heart finesse, clearly percentage, goes down 2 if off|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cash the heart and spade, surely percentage then is drop|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s9|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sac: but he started with 2 so very antipercentage not ti finess|pg||
nt|othered1: sure, odds are 5-2 on the @HQ in north, but . . . |pg||
nt|askgaard: A nig position not just to finesse|pg||
nt|sac: maybe smart to play the 9 not the ten of hearts|pg||
nt|askgaard: (big)|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, he can cash the spade now and|pg||
nt|imp_jan: a lot of imps a t stake|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|kit: I don't see what difference the heart spots make|pg||

nt|imp_jan: and now|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|dT|nt|patricck: knows Norths last two cards are the spades, shouldn't go wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: still has to take view|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no view|pg||
nt|imp_jan: north played high low in diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he has couint surely|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h5|nt|dburn: he has a complete count|pg||

nt|imp_jan: in the open room south overcalled 1nt over 1@h opening|pg||
mb|4C!|an|splinter|nt|askgaard: The point should be that *everybody* play the @hT from @hTx, so when south plays the 9...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: nice call!|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lestergold: e/w want to not get too high here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|askgaard: But it is not wise to overthink these things I guess|pg||
nt|sac: people tends to falsecard with the ten from 10x so the nine could be a dobblefalsecard, Lauria knowing it is 109 or Q9|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Undo please|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: I suppose he might think that South with 109 doubleton could play the ten, whereas with Q9 doubleton he had no choice|pg||

nt|dburn: not an absurd thing to do|pg||

pc|c2|nt|othered1: 12 extremely lucky tricks are there|pg||

nt|mariner1:  http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=2&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: - Running Scores refresh as needed|pg||
nt|me argent: im kidding but 4nt seems rgt|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think that's the only possibility - he must have misguessed how the diamonds were|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: not a nice hand to have to lead from poor tom found the worst as it happens|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: correct|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not that easy for E-W to get to 6@C now I must confess|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm still trying to come to grips with Roland's cold slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6@C is cold. Squeeze|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's not cold after 2 cans of beer, I can guarantee you that|pg||
nt|mwigor: a finesse a break and a squeeze (plus finding the @cJ)|pg||
nt|dburn: 3NT seems to have had some chances also, but...|pg||
nt|lestergold: how did 3N go off in open?|pg||
nt|mwigor: paul ducked the @c twice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Try MOVIE, Mike|pg||
nt|po-s: heart lead|pg||
nt|mwigor: after a @h lead had removed dummy's entry|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 6@C is on, but if you take yr 50% chance you go down|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mariner1: kibbers saying 6@D makes|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in open room they are in a relay auction, north still thinking|pg||
nt|lestergold: i see ht lead double club duck no entry very slow tis morning|pg||
nt|po-s: two rounds of clubs, spade finesse but only 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahalim: of course, just ruff a @s|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|mariner1: 6n might have a play on  squeeze|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|po-s: on heart lead you must finesse and draw spades before tackling clubs|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mariner1: yes we have 2nd segment of 16 boards after a short break|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Since PO never was in time trouble, he doesn't know what that means|pg||
nt|imp_jan: still 1 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes indeed still cant make|pg||
nt|dburn: the Hacketts, with their loose four-card major style, have become among the best in the world at playing shaky 4-3 fits|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: It's much more spectacular to play on the squeeze rather than the finesse when you are on vugraph|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: so another few imps on the way for england|pg||
nt|lestergold: trouble is what if spade is wrong and clubs break 2/2 then u go off by playing on s[pades first|pg||
nt|po-s: I didn¬¥t say you should, only you must|pg||
nt|dburn: well, maybe North "should" have @sK for his opening bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Besides, if you really are in 6@C, I think you will make it. North is a favourite to have both red kings after his opening|pg||
nt|imp_jan: i would say 'must '|pg||
nt|mwigor: and Axx of @c with N isnt so unlikely|pg||
nt|dburn: so it's not all that silly to play on spades before clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree david l|pg||
nt|lestergold: wasnt suggesting it was silly|pg||
nt|po-s: yes you were|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would definitely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Gentlemen, please|pg||
nt|brolucius: North is not likely to hold only two clubs after the 1@C opening, it seems.|pg||
nt|lestergold: u reading my mind if so wrong|pg||
nt|po-s: sadly I don¬¥t know how to make smileys|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: nor do i per|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|po-s: don¬¥t show off David|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That is how long it takes to teach a Swede :)|pg||
nt|po-s: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he hasnt taken our advice|pg||
nt|dburn: and yet, however silly it may not have been...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|me argent: with such good @Ds not suprising north didnt find a fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: squeeze will materialize now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and perhaps more on 16 ....|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: why david do u think that david did not play spadesw first?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's your son, you should know|pg||
nt|po-s: strange 2NT bid by East - couldn¬¥t West just have a bunch of clubs?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did you not teach him this game?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm... we are not telepathic|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I was surprised by the 2NT as well. West might choose to pass on a weak hand with long clubs, surely?|pg||
nt|jtr: South could just have the @sK and North AJ@cs doubleton|pg||
nt|lestergold: er i might have...|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps he thought you found it silly|pg||
nt|lestergold: the game|pg||
nt|jtr: Playing @ss would not be so clever then|pg||
nt|lestergold: we all agree that the finesse had to be right so why not play them first|pg||
nt|lestergold: as precaution |pg||
nt|jtr: Leave me out of the 'we' please|pg||
nt|lestergold: so how would u have played this david?|pg||
nt|lestergold: lot of dav ids aound|pg||
nt|jtr: The way your son has|pg||
nt|mwigor: on board 29 the directors are ruling 50% of 3NT making and 50% of 3NT down one|pg||
nt|mwigor: so the end result is 2 IMPs to England rather than the 10 being shown at the moment|pg||
nt|bjacobs: mimicking King Solomon?|pg||
nt|mwigor: we can't enter this in BBO|pg||
nt|po-s: really?|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats kind to tom he cant complain about that|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dburn: when their trumps are as good as J109 seventh, you should expect them to make whatever they bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A spectacular lead in the open room|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|dburn: well, that ruling is illegal, but if everyone accepts it, then it is so|pg||
nt|mwigor: it sounds like tom wasnt entirely to blame|pg||
pc|s6|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|mwigor: he asked a question and either it or the answer was misunderstood|pg||
nt|mwigor: why is it illegal david?|pg||
nt|po-s: you can¬¥t let a clamer make a finesse |pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|imp_jan: well i am afraid the dutch found their waterloo at the gold coast (so far)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mwigor: he asked if they were cashing a @h|pg||
nt|po-s: unless he says so or has found someone to be void|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mariner1: Zmud still thinking in Open..... this could win the match depending|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|mwigor: and believed he was told they were so was claiming down one|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mwigor: except of course they were not|pg||
nt|dburn: the laws relating to claims are relatively clear - that is, they are only about as clear as pre-stressed concrete|pg||
nt|po-s: why was it registered as making 3 then?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't award split scores after a claim. Either the contract makes or goes down, depending on what line declarer suggested|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you can award split scores after absolutely anything nowadays|pg||
nt|dburn: directors just love splitting scores - they think it keeps everyone happy|pg||
nt|lestergold: i may be very stupid but on this occasion i do not understand why david didnt play on spades first|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|d3|nt|po-s: didn¬¥t West lead a spade against 2H? Spectacular??|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.abf.com.au/events/results/results.asp?yr=2009&dir=yeh&E=3&R=&T=R|pg||
nt|mariner1: - Running Scores refresh as needed|pg||
pc|d7|nt|patricck: no, spectacular lead on board 16|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this deal, it seems that North would open 1@C with a doubleton club only when his shape was 4-4-3-2. In that case, with four spades and having opened the bidding, he would be a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: big favourite to hold the @SK.|pg||
nt|dburn: as jtr says, North might have had @cAJ and South @sK|pg||
pc|cT|pc|dJ|nt|bjacobs: one final hurdle for the defence|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: jumped ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: when i originally suggested that (as a remote possibility) i was told i was stupid becauase of north's opening bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: TD here now|pg||
nt|dburn: but the truth is that playing clubs first is the normal thing to do at the end of a long day|pg||
