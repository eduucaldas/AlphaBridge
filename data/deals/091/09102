nt|daman: here we go|pg||
nt|daman: should be a competitive major suit partscore battle|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello to Bob Heitzman and Ralf Willquist|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and welcome back to Cindy Marshall|pg||
nt|cindy: hi :)|pg||
nt|cindy: hi bob|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good evening from Manchester|pg||
nt|idblu: hi all from chilly Toronto, Canada :)|pg||
nt|idblu: welcome back all :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Everyone|pg||
nt|idblu: Tony, Mike, Al, Hedy :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: EW for Scotland are Frazer Morgan and Phillip Morrison|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: both students at St Andrews university|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mamos: Tom (Dessain) and Dom (Maloney) made a good start in their opening set against Ireland earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk4: JC England 40, (2 matches) Wales 24 (2): Scotland 22 (2), Northern Ireland 20 (1) ROI 14 (1)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: strong NT from north|pg||
nt|cindy: very strong  meaty|pg||
nt|ralfwil: majors or Astro?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cindy: 2@d could be a lot of things|pg||
nt|bobh1: NS got too ambitious in the other room|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2@c-2n-3@c-p is a sensible auction assuming inverted|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT might be the final contract here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E leads a D against 3NT -- the 8 or 9 for preference -- W will have to shift to a low spade right away|pg||
nt|yo_yo: brrr|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: For me Wests hand is perfect for a rise on an invitation with the aces.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: PB England 50 (2), Scotland 29 (2), Wales 26 (2) Northern Ireland 10 (1), ROI 0 (1)|pg||
nt|cindy: could be dont|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or i guess even the Q will do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too bad, cuter if low spade necessary|pg||
nt|bobh1: limit?|pg||
nt|mamos: Catherine (Evans) and Eve Hatfield are the WElsh North South|pg||
mb|2H|nt|april7: 3@S by W possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: so much for that|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good hand for west|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good evening from Manchester|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: maybe he should have bid it, but it's easy to understand why he did not|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: well judged on the cards ...|pg||
nt|capercliff: hey folks|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mamos: Not many Wests would pass after 1@H|pg||
nt|cindy: a low spade wont be good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A high @s is needed|pg||
nt|mamos: no I think this will make|pg||
nt|cindy: dont think he will lead high|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hello Mike, Kath, Cliff, Fred and Tony|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: interesting second bid on S. If they are playing a 5-card major opening 2@h shows a 6-card suit or?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2C would not be universal |pg||
nt|eggy: just one of the "never" (type 3) camp I guess|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|daman: NS will make 8 tricks at least|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I can only assume Frazer intends 2 hearts as forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: How many of you should bid 1@s on N? |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: I have to say I hate 2@C here |pg||
nt|oliverc: 1@S every time for me|pg||
nt|mamos: and me|pg||
nt|daman: Hi David|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer off to a comfortable start|pg||
nt|april7: E could have made a DONT bid|pg||
nt|daman: only if that is part of their system :)|pg||
nt|mamos: Englasnd have stopped in 3@C in open Room so a swing straightaway for the home team|pg||
nt|Walddk4: FYI, N-S are ladies, so please remember "she"|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hurray|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: thatÂ´s my opinion too|pg||
nt|eggy: just standard I think|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@C is just an overbid IMHO|pg||
nt|oliverc: on the other hand, north is a passed hand, so limited|pg||
nt|eggy: and then South would bid 2S I suppose|pg||
nt|dburn: and only if he were a certifiable maniac|pg||
nt|idblu: I think we probably will be in for some youthful exuberance...if I can go back to my own youthful bidding days :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so these are the under 25s here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm more experienc might suggest to young Jones that on a weak hand with a six card spade suit, it is generally better to rebid the spades|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Scotland doing pretty well from the results i see, not sure how current|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Catherine and Eve|pg||
pc|c7|nt|eggy: ah - or pass|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Not for me if it was 4315 (@c6 is a heart)|pg||
nt|april7: NS play weak NT so DONT not possible|pg||
nt|daman: that too|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: winning play by declarer after a good auction|pg||
pc|c8|nt|odysseus69: or pass 1S|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cindy: can play for overtricks now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos: anyway 2@H is going to survive with perhaps an imp to Ireland|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not @d10 in trick2?|pg||
nt|cindy: good question|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cindy: hmm|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|s4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: doubtless E bid 1 spade on a get your retaliation in first principal, but this may be two high..|pg||
pc|hA|nt|idblu: ge Roland :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|capercliff: these ruffs actually help declarer in a way|pg||
nt|capercliff: but the A@h was an error|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so may get through|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cindy: four pitches will be painful for E|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Helen Cole. Welcome to you|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|eggy: really?|pg||
nt|mamos: hi Helen|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|dburn: meanwhile, though, North has done pretty well with his 1NT opening - if they choose 1@h at the other table, East-West may well compete in spades|pg||
nt|mamos: should probably make from here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|idblu: home now|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 4@s on EW?|pg||

nt|lestergold: just what west wanted to hear!!|pg||
nt|idblu: I like 4@H  non vul :)|pg||

nt|idblu: hi mike :)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|odysseus69: clearly depends on standard for 2D opener in 2nd seat vul|pg||
nt|daman: NS will bis to 2@H and EW will probably balance in @S|pg||
nt|bobh1: interesting jump shift in the other room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 mikes|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: bid*|pg||
nt|cindy: hi marshall !|pg||
nt|bobh1: set the auction up well|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h is allowable at green but will not get a great result this time|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Here is Mike... he will know the scores|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yo_yo: well we arent results merchants, most of us like the bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: here we'll probably see 4sf etc|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|april7: now 2@S by E? perhaps|pg||
nt|mamos: England have bid 4@S in Open Room|pg||
nt|bobh1: oh they play strong @c in the other room|pg||
nt|idblu: whats the over/under   for undertricks?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|odysseus69: same start next door - then over 2NT south bid  3D - whatever that meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: noooooooooooooooooooo|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: well whatever 3@S means it showed a good hand|pg||
nt|daman: wrong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Presumably it is Blue Club style here|pg||
nt|cindy: 4 now|pg||
nt|idblu: inverted minors...2@C game forcing|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobh1: apparently 4n is RKC in @c's|pg||
nt|idblu: lots of tricks here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: cards lie in a friendly way so no probs|pg||
nt|capercliff: yep, would have been a lot in 6@c as well|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: probably an endplay on E for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: a poor switch why on earth does he want to ruff when he has natural trump tricks?|pg||
nt|idblu: @S looked 100%|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: -2 it seems|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he's enjoying himself|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: NS ontrack here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: five star contract!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: watching poor east suffer|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c??|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that an undo operator?|pg||
nt|idblu: don't understand this play|pg||
nt|lestergold: ac is reasonable a dim is reasonable a spade to the K is reasoanble but why has he plasyed the 2c??|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cannot see an upside to this play|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mamos: even if East responded to B/Wood :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: the bidding diagram is missing a couple of passes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wilkinsona: 2 spades a bit pessimistic it seems from north this time|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|capercliff: not that it is really biddable|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no it didnt seem obvious|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats right Cliff, bid 'em up|pg||
nt|idblu: 14 opposite 12...need the hand records to bid 6 :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|daman: another profit for NS|pg||
nt|cindy: think so ?  partner is passed hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Claim 12 tricks before anything happens!|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5sx escaped for 1 down and they defended 5C in open room|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: 2@s is too weak For me 3 possibilities. pass for penalty, 2nt or 3@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once S does not open, N does not like his hand for game, especially with a lot wasted in hearts. maybe he would pass out the double at matchpoints, but even then EW are nonvul, and ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if W has a stiff stpade it could be ugly for NS (esp. if S has spade ace)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, north also had a option of playing in 2 hearts x |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d2|pc|c6|nt|mamos: ouch|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|d6|nt|odysseus69: maybe 4 8s here|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|april7: S tries to go down|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|capercliff: and the K@d is waste paper:)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s2|nt|dburn: East probably ought to have risked 2@s, but that's the kind of action that comes with experience|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you are going to play it out, it is MANDATORY to discard the jack of diamonds on the ace of hearts|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|april7: no|pg||

nt|mamos: NS found their good save here|pg||
nt|eggy: It seems that Jones & Bell had doubled 3D on hand 1|pg||
nt|eggy: somehow|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think experienced players would enter the auction as East David|pg||
nt|cindy: 2@hx would scare me at IMPs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is an option, but perhaps not an attractive one facing heart shortness. he can't count on more than 100, and may not get that, so why not just take an easy plus|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it's not like S rates to have Kx of hearts|pg||
nt|bobh1: find it surprising that 4n is both intended and interpreted as RKC but they landed on their feet for sure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: let W think for a few seconds that E has the diamond ace. then cash it. life's little pleasures|pg||

mb|p|nt|eggy: I think I prefer that to the open room decision|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: pleased to here all of you defend Norths action at the table|pg||
nt|idblu: not strong NT n/s|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mamos: no stopping East anyway|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i prefer 3S|pg||
nt|eggy: They will need to save 7 I suppose - |pg||
nt|eggy: but after the think, unlikely to save against 6 if West passes|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: over 6s-pass - west should bid grand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The disadvantage with 5@s is that E can draw the right conclusion |pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
nt|mamos: and West for that matter |pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Victor!|pg||
nt|cindy: i think S was about 99% to have four spades|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|eggy: I think that N should still bid and see what they do|pg||
nt|daman: partner rates to have 3@H's|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree, a passed hand should not reopen with D there without 4 spades|pg||
nt|idblu: it's been suggested that n/s are playing ACOL|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that a "do something sensible partner" double?|pg||
nt|mamos: NS don't appear to have a good spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: dont fancy it really|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: similar auction to board 2|pg||
nt|april7: since it was not a fit, 4th hand didn't balance|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you might bid 2@s over 2@h on the auction as it was, but I agree that it was a position in which neither side might have a great fit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS will do OK on a club lead|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@DX prob their best spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s can be made double dummy - it can also easily be misdefended-a dim two ruffs and two hearts are easy for the defence but they will not necessarily also come tio a lub trick a ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: club may go away on the third heart|pg||

nt|capercliff: Phil and Frazer are a young Scottish pair, but have ben playing together for some years in fact|pg||
pc|c4|nt|oliverc: East pass here showing the void?|pg||
nt|daman: what was West thinking?|pg||
nt|mamos: EW a little over enthuisiastic here|pg||
nt|daman: East had his bid|pg||
nt|mamos: !|pg||
nt|daman: is that an undo operator?|pg||
nt|idblu: 9 tricks look easy with the @D hook and a @H|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: now they must save in 7@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has to bid 7S now |pg||
nt|odysseus69: North not South|pg||
nt|eggy: He knows he must save 7 too, but Westmay think N must have a trick to bi 6S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North has adopted the worst approach possible|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|eggy: But North puts the problem back to S :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With that solid 6-card @s suit 4@s is a master contract. Yes I see AKQJ10 as a 6-card suit!|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|wilkinsona: well, a more optimistic contract this time..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but the defence may be difficult|pg||
nt|cindy: might as well keep on leading @s|pg||
nt|mamos: well bod|pg||
nt|mamos: bid|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: Here we have a combination of doubles P shows NO  or two defensive trick and S can now see that @cK probably is on side for declarer and must save|pg||
nt|april7: to high this time|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mamos: a double figure swing to England|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear he should seriously downgrade his diamond holding|pg||
nt|yo_yo: O'Rourke overbid here|pg||
nt|mamos: well it was always a likely outcome|pg||
nt|idblu: this doesn't play well....but on values s/b in game |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk4: For your information commentators and other spectators: three of the players at this table are young ladies. Only East is not. Pls remember (he/she)|pg||
nt|april7: lucky lead though for only 1 down|pg||
nt|bobh1: low @c is clear now|pg||
nt|mamos: @cx |pg||
nt|marlowepi: and equally clear to go up|pg||
nt|bobh1: so maybe it's right to cash the A|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wilkinsona: thats a good switch|pg||
nt|idblu: 3N will make on lie of the cards|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dburn: assuming that it was East and not North who bid 4@s, he certainly has his bid. West, on the other hand...|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: play for the max!|pg||
nt|lestergold: why 24 combined points but very flat hands ghame not at all attratcive|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|daman: this will be another gain for Wales|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry- dont agree - North should simply bid 1 more spade wherever the oppo go|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|april7: might have made a short suit trial, denied by E|pg||
nt|daman: West was  trying to see if there was a star in the East (and I don't mean her partner)|pg||
nt|dburn: ...well, after this start she needs only spades 3-3 and a favourable club position|pg||
nt|april7: if short suit trial was possible in saystem|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to eggy|pg||
nt|eggy: hI EVERYONE|pg||
nt|marlowepi: actiually, couldn;t it be right to lead another heart? how does S know the diamonds are running? and N could have much better sopades|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: now the defence have burnt a trick ltho conmtract still one off|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East realised he had 2 entries to set up the diamonds|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|sT|pc|d3|nt|april7: smal @H|pg||
nt|idblu: chance for many now|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: north gave it back he should never cover the JH|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: at this vul 7@S is unlikely to be worse than a few imps away defending 7@H risks a bucketfu|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: l|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|dburn: would the East-West bidding have been different if North rather than West held the queen of clubs?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|daman: yawn|pg||
pc|h6|nt|oliverc: I must confess I would be tempted to PASS over West's Double here. Bidding some|pg||
nt|oliverc: huge number of Spades immediately on such a weak hand can just make life easy|pg||
nt|oliverc: for Opps. Left to themselves, it's unlikely E/W will bid 7@H here.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If @cK was on N he had to double, showing a supposed trick |pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: cards played wrong - N kept diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes - I still like 3S although I have been experimenting with xx|pg||
nt|dburn: put it this way - if I could allow my opponents to play a grand slam on a finesse on every board of a match, I would expect to win that match by a large margin|pg||
pc|c7|nt|eggy: So what do you do if they do bid 6/7 spades after you pass?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mamos: 24 points seems the norm for bidding games at imps these days|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cindy: except N could have knocked out club K and take @h finesse|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|daman: claim|pg||

nt|dburn: and you lot are simply resulting - what North-South did on this board was fine, and so was what East-West did|pg||
nt|mamos: ah glad David is here he'll like the NS auction on this one|pg||
nt|eggy: well at least this way you made EW guess if they could make 7|pg||
nt|daman: get your popcorn out   this might be exciting|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 2NT bid at these colors facing a 3rd seat opener seems overly ambitious. unless there is something about the 1C opener i am not aware of |pg||
nt|lestergold: -2|pg||
nt|idblu: how young are these juniors?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that would be nice to know yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Cards laying ok for NS|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mamos: I don't like double|pg||
nt|eggy: what was it Mike?|pg||
nt|dburn: awkward, this|pg||
nt|bobh1: was tough to avoid 6@c in the other room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H doesnt feel like enough to me|pg||
nt|bobh1: here they are exerting less pressure|pg||
nt|mamos: Dbl   hehe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: quite a bit of difference between teenagers and 24 year olds|pg||
nt|lestergold: north should bid 4H in my uiew|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: 8 card suit is not a takeout double|pg||
nt|mamos: he'll have to bid at 5 level soon|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he must think X and then bid @H is better to describe his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: EW need to be careful to check winners as well as losers here |pg||
nt|marlowepi: Jones like to open 1C. or else he has a defective bidding box|pg||
nt|cindy: sorry   im a @d bidder with E hand|pg||
nt|dburn: still, South does not have a clear action|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@s can make but to bid it is another story|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: maybe it could, but it would seem normal to arrive in only 3@d|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may be 6 spades is on though|pg||
nt|lestergold: he isv ulnerable he needs a goodish hand to overcall 4h itys not too good for that bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: pass on s???|pg||
nt|mamos: NS played in their 3-0 fit after West had opened 1@D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why didnÂ´t S bid 2@c?|pg||
nt|daman: they don't play drury for sure|pg||
nt|bobh1: still will be hard to stay out|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he knows he has to bid @H at the  5 level eventually|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: one of the mysteries of life Ralf|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South is shell-shocked from previous board|pg||
nt|april7: EW should stay in a decent @D partscore and NS should stay out of bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: good for them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree. can;t imagine passing|pg||
nt|idblu: I'm sure that's his intent, but this is the wrong type of hand for that|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they wwere always bidding at least 4s in any case|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and has shown his partner a good hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: actually not good as the cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Tom and Dom are more coservative than most juniors|pg||
nt|mamos: conservative|pg||
nt|dburn: and nor does North, although...|pg||
nt|bobh1: blakwood not that helpful|pg||
nt|mamos: Blackwood with xx ???|pg||
nt|cindy: thats not a surprise is it ?|pg||
nt|idblu: major suits ultra favourable|pg||
pc|d3|nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|april7: W now 3@D and thats it|pg||
nt|mamos: ugh|pg||
nt|daman: he will bid 3@S|pg||
nt|april7: desaster in 3NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: old fashioned Culbertson asking bid! |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: why not?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in @H not good|pg||
nt|idblu: lose 2@h 2@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 5h doubled only 2 off|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wilkinsona: Im for 6 spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: on that lead 6s made|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eggy: and only 4C now seems a bit wet too!|pg||
nt|dburn: double may have been more major-suit oriented - 2@c would not be such a good idea if North were 4=4=3=2|pg||
nt|daman: passing is not an option|pg||
nt|april7: or even worse|pg||
nt|mamos: EW have game here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if i could show both suits by specifying them right away, i might--certainly if NV i would. here i like  1D|pg||
nt|cindy: coconservative  new bridge adjective|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|bobh1: well done whatever it was|pg||
pc|s7|nt|eggy: more optimistic than that George :)|pg||
nt|cindy: it does make 4S i guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When I donÂ´t expect 3@cD be the final contract, I must bid 3@h on S|pg||
nt|cindy: and 4H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what does it mean when you can't act over 1C, but you can act over a jump-rebid facing a passed partner when opps are unlimited but also have not shown a fit?|pg||
nt|mamos: my typoingis carp|pg||
nt|cindy: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: what would you have him do?|pg||
nt|bobh1: or well-guessed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E cannot afford to double|pg||
nt|cindy: a guess i think|pg||
nt|dburn: bid 4@s, perhaps?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: makes on any lead perhaps|pg||
nt|idblu: on any lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: a spade lead?|pg||
nt|idblu: also|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and west should surely bid 4 hearts over the splinter|pg||
nt|idblu: @D on @C and ruff 3 @H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well may need a diamond hook|pg||
pc|sK|nt|eggy: still 1 back to Ireland it seems|pg||
nt|eggy: 11|pg||
nt|dburn: as well he might have been|pg||
pc|sA|nt|daman: trump lead|pg||
nt|april7: yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: West has a 10 count, why should he cue bid|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|daman: I used to bid like that when I was their age :)|pg||
nt|april7: its actually easy to lead ace and another @D with those @S cards|pg||
nt|daman: Smolski still bids like that :)|pg||
nt|mamos: I'm sure I was worse but this is really just out of control|pg||
nt|cindy: 4@s should be asking about @hs|pg||
nt|mamos: and @CKQ not looking good opposite splinter|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Goren says add five for a void after a fit is found|pg||
nt|yo_yo: exactly|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|odysseus69: Roland will agree that young players may be affected by bad board|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|capercliff: there will be a @s entry in dummy|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|bobh1: agree, the N hand is a little strong tho|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I donÂ´t know what itÂ´s called in english, but 4@h was an asking bid for control in @h|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: i don't think that is clear. just because S didnt make a neg double doesnt mean he cant have 4 spades|pg||
nt|capercliff: to play a @h again|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mamos: yes the swings are starting to go the other way and what was a big English lead is down to a handful|pg||
nt|april7: at least now @D|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: our experts coments on board 2 justified by the score, as 4 spades went off open room on a diamond lead|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: I agree with anything you say, Victor|pg||

nt|mamos: neither pair seemed to get to grips with their values on Board 4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This was a typical hand where you must act early. otherwise you are out-bidden|pg||
nt|cindy: first few hands have been interesting|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over 3S on that last hand, it would be useful to play that D by N shows three good hearts. since N did not rebid 1S and has a jump-rebiddablke suit in a good offensive hand on this ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: auction, not a great idea to play it for penalty|pg||
nt|cindy: yes  thats true too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me, 4S should either be natural or a cue, by agreement|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't know what it's called in English either|pg||
nt|idblu: we are all resulting here...in real life how many pairs would really get to 6 :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzjj: yes|pg||

nt|capercliff: this is a bit high|pg||
pc|s9|nt|wilkinsona: talking of thin games...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: a bit too many... sac against 2 spades EW|pg||

pc|s4|nt|dburn: what would North do with a 5=1=1=6 shape?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|daman: hard to believe that NS, looking at dummy, couldn't understand how important it was to play trumps|pg||

nt|daman: I might have unsheathed the red card|pg||
nt|april7: X???|pg||

nt|marlowepi: it is a matter of agreements, david. you can go either way on the agreement, depending on what you think will be most useful to the partnership. i don;t care either way here, but i ...|pg||

nt|capercliff: 1 off at best, beatig 140 I suppose|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we ladies get nervous about doubling|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: The poor defence to 5@D and a doomed 3NT in the open reverses the lead|pg||
pc|sT|nt|daman: with the young players, you have to expect the unexpected|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mamos: this looks pretty straightforward|pg||

nt|idblu: or is that wee men|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: spec points out that 3N NS has play, but the spade bids did for that|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes they did  that's result merchanting|pg||
nt|idblu: looks like the somnambulist coup |pg||

nt|wilkinsona: well bidding and making 4 hearts is quite a coup on this lot|pg||

nt|dburn: nothing neither way, as some poet remarked|pg||
nt|mamos: Ian Jones enjoying himself here|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: but goes wrong|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N had to win on the hand!|pg||

nt|marlowepi: too much elation about the king of hearts falling|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: but i agree that if you do NOT have a clear agreement, the old default principle is best: "if it COULD be natural, we shouyld both assume it is natural"|pg||
nt|mamos: Is "rubbish" Parliamentary language?|pg||
nt|cindy: lolol|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: notice played the slam hand in 6Hx OR|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mamos: I always think we should have a joker "Could I try that trick again" we all have that sinking feeling when we've done something silly  :(  it's tough when you are being watched|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so E will not be punished for failure to play 9 or 10 of hearts on first round (though that might not work anyway--still it is important to make those plays just to keep in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: practice)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: PB Wales-Scotland 6-24; England-Ireland 25-0  NI Sat out|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|janhamhurg: good result here from other table, only 20 hcp, nice game|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|janhamhurg: now west has a problem|pg||
nt|suketbombi: suhas has chichned out due to light opening vinay unlikely to continue|pg||
nt|suketbombi: chickened|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: self made, instead supporting hearts|pg||
nt|santyclz: Any idea what 3@s shows?  Certainly not what it would here.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: true |pg||
nt|vugraphzat: Preempt stle with values |pg||
nt|suketbombi: was too good for 2h but not enuf for a 2s  3 card raise|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: n s play old fashioned solid(sometimes) bridge, so 3 sp is an invitation i guess|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Buddy.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: knowing vinay he may even knowing spade shortage|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: nothing wrong bidding 3 hearts here|pg||

nt|mamos: Poor North :(|pg||
nt|mamos: well this set has whizzed past|pg||
nt|mamos: last board coming up|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not for scotland|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks above all o helen our operator|pg||
nt|idblu: liked the @DK :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another 8 card suit|pg||
nt|mamos: some one has cranked up the deal generator|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: another slam to bite the dust here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 and 8 card suits growing ion trees around here|pg||
nt|idblu: still learning that you can't preempt twice with the same hand|pg||
nt|idblu: no double...no trouble|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so good defence for -3|pg||
nt|capercliff: here's a bit of action|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: thx to spectators|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks especially to Philkip our operator, thanks to NIBU and Sandy Millership (I know how nerve wracking it is to run one of these things)|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h? Well, I suppose they had more trumps than their opponents, but even so...|pg||
nt|april7: 6@C by W|pg||
nt|idblu: @H suits abound in this event it appears|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes, that is likely to haunt him for a while|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: playing @c before trumps had solved everything|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if n/s have heqard of blackwood they may stay out of slam|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am confident they will|pg||
nt|lestergold: confident they wikll stay ouit?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yo_yo: yes stay out|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos: thanks to BBO and Roland for organising us all and thanks to you for watching |pg||
nt|april7: not easy to reach but we will see|pg||
nt|eggy: tricky bod for East though|pg||
nt|eggy: bid|pg||
nt|april7: this bid makes it possible|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D seems automatic|pg||
nt|eggy: not likely to get to 6C, that's for sure|pg||
nt|dburn: he might barely have bid 2@d, which would not have been especially tricky|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT is for the club allstars|pg||
nt|april7: W must be careful not to go to 6NT|pg||
nt|mamos: and to marshall and cindy and Bob and David and ralf for their commebts|pg||
nt|idblu: is this a KO event, swiss ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would hope so |pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you i dont like that 2@C bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: still, his actual effort might work pretty well|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Well tricky to get over the hand I meant :)|pg||
nt|mamos: yes ralf in 3@H in the OR declarer did test Clubs|pg||
nt|idblu: round robin|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a round robin|pg||
nt|lestergold: but north must be chaffing at the bit with that monster |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that 2@D bid might excite O'Rourke|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: unlikely that NS will bid this 10%- game, so a narrow win for England|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: there you go|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should have bid a lot of clubs even at this vulnerability with good 8 card suits you at least must take up the oppos bidding space|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes Somerville stayed strangely silent on this|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is not a bad spot, but can go down on a @d ruff|pg||
nt|mamos: well 2@S works|pg||
nt|mamos: worked|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: is this a steal by EW?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mamos: next session in twenty minutes or so |pg||
nt|odysseus69: will east balance|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sensibly not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks to the operator for showing us all four hands|pg||
nt|ralfwil: duck!|pg||
nt|idblu: and such a strong playing hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: too late east|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ahha enter dopi and ropi|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or podi and pori|pg||
nt|idblu: lets see if they know their ropis/dopis|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: cue for all round disaster|pg||
nt|yo_yo: South isnt sure which suit North is interested in|pg||
nt|lestergold: well obviously dont play rkc |pg||
nt|yo_yo: North cant really bid again|pg||
nt|yo_yo: neither can South|pg||
pc|h5|nt|eggy: remarkable as David Coleman would have said :)|pg||
nt|april7: this time not a wrong prediction by me|pg||
nt|dburn: especially since West has shown already that she is not backward in coming forward|pg||
nt|april7: with @S fonesse even 6 NT, I miscounted before|pg||
nt|dburn: be honest now - how many of you lot could get to 6@c in four bids?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west may have competed with 3 spades here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is usually correct technique on 2-suiters where there is work to be done to attend to the side suit before trumps|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think this will make|pg||
nt|mamos: and apologies for my typing   thanks to NIBU and Sandie Millership for making us welcome and BBO for bringing this broadcast to us all|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: pass is 1|pg||
nt|idblu: everybody has it marked on their card...but when it comes up :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south hasnt a clue |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks ok, Mike|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: maybe but not far from 4 hearts|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Thats the trouble with that 2@C bid, usually agrees @S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|april7: only the youth|pg||
nt|idblu: lets see if W holds off till 3rd trump play|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: results will be posted here http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
nt|idblu: or is P 1st step|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: pass shows 1 inexperience playing in our 4/4 fit when you have a solid 7 card suit elsewhere|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now to negotiate the 4-1 break|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: right contract it seems as 5 hearts is off on the ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: amd 5d off if they find the ruff|pg||
nt|idblu: 5@H goes down|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, true|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep 5h unlucky does go ionm the ruff andf5f makes but normally this should be plaed in hearts if we are not result merchants|pg||
nt|idblu: and of course we are not |pg||
nt|yo_yo: are you eating your words there Mike :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: Norths 2C bid was not alerted|pg||
nt|lestergold: eating which words|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think maybe both 5d and 5h are both going down|pg||
nt|idblu: ty Helen|pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: So there may be an adjustment as they were told it ws nat|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mamos: East was no longer sure all his Clubs were actually Clubs???|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: S king was a good card by W--not so easy for N to count W's poinmts|pg||
nt|idblu: that is not the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: club lead surely|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think EW were damaged|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@C is a cue...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: any lead it makes as East only has 1 trump|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but I am surprised the Irish boys dont know the unassuming cue bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: then when trumps are played take third diamond and play club leaves declarer awkwardly placed|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Morrison will draw trumps and hope the @C run?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: probably still survives|pg||
nt|idblu: but still makes,,,has @H entry|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|eggy: I know strong club pairs who couldn't get there in 20 :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: How many of you should duck the trumph lead?|pg||
nt|bobh1: very strange auction|pg||

pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: Next match:  Northern Ireland v Wales (Junior Camrose)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|april7: W still need @S finesse|pg||
nt|daman: well    1@H - 2@C - 2@D - 3@C - 4@C might be an auction that would impel us to slam|pg||
nt|eggy: not the best practioners of that black art it's true|pg||
nt|idblu: not now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|idblu: @D9 promoted|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mamos: I think the next session is 8pm uk time two hours 20 minutes check for local times and shout now if I've got it wrong|pg||
nt|cindy: iwas wondering why im always right|pg||
nt|dburn: almost no one|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ItÂ´s a kind of safety play with the actual @d-holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: off now?|pg||
nt|capercliff: rather tricky hand to play|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Wales knocked 3N OR for a big swing board 15|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|dburn: it might, but 3@c would not be forcing for the majority of players in this competition|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|april7: if 3@C is forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 promoted|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mamos: North isn't going to like this hand even though it isn't his fault|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not too often we get trick one safety plays in 2S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but let us see!|pg||
nt|cindy: most players dont think long enough at trick one to even consider it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i usually save them for slams. to hold it to down one|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - it's a safety play to guaretee going down one in a laydown contract|pg||
nt|idblu: poor dummy play |pg||

mb|1S|nt|april7: 4@H and 5@D with @H finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: looks like a 4@h on EW|pg||
nt|mamos: There are two competitions this is U25 - Junior Camrose and the Peggy Bayer U20|pg||
nt|eggy: perhaps West should have played the hearts from dummy anyway as if N ducked the HA, it wouldn;t have helped|pg||
nt|capercliff: if N decides to scrpe a bid yes|pg||
nt|mamos: I'd bid 2@S|pg||
nt|capercliff: scrape*|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Helen Cole|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mamos: let's hope EW get in the bidding|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: Q for a make it seems|pg||

nt|capercliff: indeed, are they playing 5 majors?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|idblu: everyone here would|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|odysseus69: i agree - 3h on second round then smack them if they try 3 spades|pg||

nt|eggy: I seemed to have arrived at a "sprightly" overcall|pg||
nt|odysseus69: double is penalty so choice is double -only 300- 3NT or 4S- |pg||
nt|oliverc: 4NT?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: would never consider 3H even when I was young|pg||
nt|mamos: East West bid  quite soundly so East will expect a fair hand opposite I think|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry- 500 for 3Hx - the preferred option|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@H ?|pg||
nt|oliverc: If West is showing a probable 5-5 with a Minor, East must surely be interested in a|pg||
nt|oliverc: Minor suit slam here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me 4@c is forcing, so thatÂ´s my bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: slam needs too much|pg||
nt|mamos: even my generous spirit can resist suggesting that declarer's line was poor there -- no clear plan |pg||
nt|april7: oh yes ace of @C and ace of @S,sorry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S would like to bid but has no good bid|pg||
nt|mamos: INT |pg||
nt|idblu: may get overboard once N opens|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but somehow on vugraph it's nice to have very boring hands|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes Tony, it had to be a @h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so you dont make a fool of yourself|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|dburn: whenever the English were getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the Question|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Both West s passed|pg||
nt|idblu: easier to show later|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may go slaming now|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: think my chimp has some left over|pg||
nt|mamos: bby WESt|pg||
nt|idblu: won't have that problem now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North wont be finished|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no need when pard overcalls in spades|pg||
nt|idblu: 6-5 come alive|pg||
nt|lestergold: nor will e/w be finished|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|lestergold: 6c or dim looks lioke a good save|pg||
nt|capercliff: declarer did not have enough entries to finesse @s and @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: 1066 and all that :)|pg||
nt|mamos: surely you jusy have to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep perhaps 6 clubs x|pg||
mb|4H|nt|oliverc: sensible stuff|pg||
nt|bobh1: double is ok--maybe pd won't bid 2@d|pg||
nt|mamos: ugh I dont like double|pg||
nt|lestergold: west aint standing it|pg||
nt|idblu: W can't sit|pg||
nt|idblu: N can pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Hastings Pudding|pg||
nt|april7: thats straight forward bidding|pg||
nt|bobh1: if (s)he does, maybe it'll be okay|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats it Cliff (last hand)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|idblu: he did :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he did thats sheer inxperience|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult to overrule partner|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: lucky this isnt a make really|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: just a couple of levels too high|pg||
nt|april7: 2down but 4@S is a make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D is the value bid, but it takes up a lot of space. for that reason many pairs play a 2C rebid by the opener as artificial|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|idblu: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a cheap save|pg||
nt|idblu: nice support N bought :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: NS are female Kerri North Ruth South|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: can the defence prevail?  |pg||
nt|mamos: fast forward|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some may wonder why N didn't bid 2C. but if NS style is regularly to make less-than-fully-prepared TO doubles, N cannot count on a fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not sure why east was so keen to defend either|pg||
nt|idblu: nice stop|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: @cJ from W had been bingo|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i prefer 3@H there, 4@H sounds like a splinter|pg||
nt|idblu: yes...|pg||
nt|idblu: thats what N thought|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: yes but..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: club switch by defence needed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after 2 ducks in @c a @h shift is needed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but not enough as declarer can duck twice|pg||
pc|sT|nt|idblu: can make 6 with the @D hook\|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: good save though|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mamos: i think it is asking too much|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a good case for a club lead on this auction holding such poor spades and a club sequence. but either could be the winner. |pg||
nt|mamos: good effort...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|idblu: but thats double dummy|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|idblu: better take the @H|pg||
nt|capercliff: cant see 6....|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wilkinsona: sure he could have got an extra 200 a level higher|pg||
nt|lestergold: how doeshe know whether to play heart or spade now?|pg||
nt|idblu: u get 3 @H pitches|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: timing must be just right for that I think|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mamos: now is the crucial..|pg||
nt|idblu: he doesn't|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: well he didnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: so lost a trickl|pg||
nt|lestergold: expensive |pg||
nt|idblu: E fault for not cashing|pg||
nt|capercliff: always a @h and a @s to lose no?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think so|pg||
pc|c8|nt|daman: more bloodletting since 4@S is cold|pg||
nt|mamos: moment|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well nearly there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how could W not switch to hearts? he can count a set if E has D king|pg||
pc|c7|pc|sK|pg||
nt|idblu: i thot E had 3 @S's my error|pg||
nt|capercliff: 6 would be much closer if S did indeed have a splinter:)|pg||
nt|idblu: yes|pg||
pc|d7|nt|eggy: 5 as the cards lie|pg||
nt|april7: actually 11 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|mamos: I think that we must remember the inexperience of the players here but WEst just played too quickly here @H switch could hardly fail unless declarer had nine tricks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ralfwil: Kelsey has written a very good book: Killing defence|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true. kind of hard for declarer to have nine though, after he ducks clubs twice|pg||
nt|mamos: Kelsey wrote about 40 good books ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and several great ones|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: but not easy for east because east doesnt know of double fit and doesnt know that 2 hearts arent cashing if played thru|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose East doesnt take West for tricks, with his preemptive 4@S bid|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: but could see the @H going away|pg||
nt|lestergold: jump fits word work well on these hands|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: close match now|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|dburn: it is, but it's not easy to say which of North and South should have bid more|pg||
pc|cK|nt|daman: well   actually 8 more IMPs in the pocket for Ireland|pg||

nt|marlowepi: adventures in card play (with Geza Ottlik) and Bridge for the Connoisseur come immediately to mind|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: board 7 passed out both rooms... good to see such sound bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: double is more or less normal, even automatic. What would you do - pass?|pg||
nt|idblu: cashing @H A denies @SA...after the ruff W will know what to do|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes fit jumps good system|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzjj: sorry fir the break - lost connection|pg||
nt|mamos: EW have a huge major fit|pg||
nt|capercliff: overcall from E hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: majors for sure|pg||
nt|mamos: and Ns minors of course|pg||
nt|odysseus69: does 1C promise clubs- do we know?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a cheap save in majors against 5@c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: as used in OR|pg||
mb|1H|nt|april7: and a free @S bid by S|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S looks easy enough here|pg||
nt|lestergold: in any case surely a massive jumop inm hearts would show thenature of west'shand even withour specific jump fit agreement|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: I don't know but I think it's likely|pg||
nt|daman: Wales just gained an impossible 13 IMPs to make the match closer|pg||
nt|mamos: ewww|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how can it be "sound" when all pass. that is silence, not sound|pg||
nt|lestergold: another Marylin  Monroe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not from me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: suit too bad|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: on 19 E for Wales passed pout 1 spade for a swing|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: steady..|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's that mike?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 5@h is better than 5@s!|pg||
nt|mamos: South will surely do something but surprised N did not double|pg||
nt|capercliff: im a @s bidder|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ralfwil: Yes Kelsey is one of my favourites. all his analyzes are perfect|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ur too young to know it was a term for shapely hands uised in the fifties for some reason|pg||
nt|lestergold: ur too innocent to be told |pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: North's pass should not be forcing at this vul and this type of auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree about "more or less". i specifically agree with the "less" part. yes i would pass|pg||
nt|idblu: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: and North presumably thinks so too, or he would have doubled|pg||
nt|marlowepi: @H|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4 spades -2 looks to give EW a chance here|pg||
nt|idblu: 2@S too rich for me|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mamos: less than automatic for me|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a bit odd, obviously not GF because they arent in game|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mamos: http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick for tournament scores and format|pg||
nt|mamos: NS look like +500 here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A @h shift will make -2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 200|pg||
nt|eggy: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h shift is also safe with @s K102.|pg||
nt|eggy: e|pg||
nt|odysseus69: right - as long as North still has lead|pg||
nt|eggy: But S may overtake and cash the diamond|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Right, but in my opinion N has to decide the defence|pg||
nt|odysseus69: you are right Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S can tell N to shift to D with his signals but its only a recommendation|pg||
nt|mamos: undo Helen|pg||

pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: I have also met him at the table. He was always correct|pg||

nt|yo_yo: 1@S looks normal|pg||
nt|idblu: 1@S passed out would be OK|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|mamos: ugly indeed|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: agree about 2S. this is a defensively oriented hand except for the sixth vclub, which has already been shown|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: ...for this looks to make|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wilkinsona: probably you play these well, Cindy|pg||
nt|cindy: no i dont|pg||
nt|mamos: England supporters will feel this is a poor performance :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too. why let opps in cheaply with 1H? and if they bid more hearts, it may get awkward to show spades. you could miss 4S|pg||
nt|cindy: 1@s is my style|pg||
nt|cindy: but i dont like 2@s by N|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: NI back in the lead after 5d -1 OR|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What bid from N will make 1@d a bad bid?|pg||
nt|cindy: spec seems to disagree with my thinking|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@S  is my choice and I know that many disagree but i think it's winning bridge|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not N i am worried about. it is W|pg||
nt|cindy: its not N|pg||
nt|cindy: lol marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you could guarantee me W would pass i might bid 1D|pg||
nt|cindy: agree|pg||
nt|cindy: have to get that spade bid in at the 1 level|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: however this may be -2 vs 2 hearts made so no harm done maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even then it might be critical to play spades from my side to protect hearts king|pg||
nt|mamos: for sure if you bid 1@D you let West bid 1@h|pg||
nt|cindy: if S is interested in hearing from N again, he will balance|pg||

nt|april7: 2NT only ok if for minors and not to play|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@H in both rooms|pg||
nt|cindy: if that outside junk were in my suits, YES|pg||
nt|bobh1: not if you don't mind missing games :)|pg||
nt|dburn: no, it is not|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's wrong with the old blood!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: cards lie nicely here|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this should make not equiring rosenberg /zia declafrer play skill|pg||
nt|idblu: 3@C stayman?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: agree bob|pg||
nt|cindy: its beyond maximum|pg||
mb|p|pc|s9|nt|dburn: in which case it was normal - no harm in being maximum once in a while|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: even +2 possible it seems|pg||
nt|idblu: costly spot lead|pg||
nt|capercliff: this is tight|pg||
nt|mamos: this isnt pretty probably encourage East to do it again|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: up the anti,,, good defence required|pg||
pc|sK|nt|idblu: wish trick|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|capercliff: always going off I suppose|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzjj: the average age (I would guess) is less than 20 - it is sad to see them denigrated by'world class' players|pg||
nt|capercliff: small @d now I predict|pg||
pc|dA|nt|idblu: 2345|pg||
nt|lestergold: to make 6 needs to finesse club and establish 4th club|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d2|pg||
nt|idblu: another wasted spot card|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|wilkinsona: this can be tricky|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: how many of you had a @s lead from S instead of @dK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: and looks like he can do taht|pg||
nt|idblu: down 1 probably best she can do|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: working play in trumps from Tom|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@H going off in OR|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s lead i suppose?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: any lead could be right on this hand, even a trump! but i would lead diamond king|pg||
pc|cT|nt|wilkinsona: on the replayed line spade Jack would have made|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|april7: E has only 4 losers in @D contract, but might lose control on @S leads, but N might have bid on to 3@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, pd might have a stiff spade. but even a ruff there mnight not help us, and anyone pd might have a doubleton diamond and get a ruff there just as easily|pg||
pc|h6|nt|idblu: @C 7 comes home to roost|pg||

nt|mamos: lol  good argument would tou open 1NT 15-17?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Even if 1nt is weak, wests hand is worth a rise to 3@s.  With 4-4 in majors I had asked for majors and after 2@d, my bid is 2@s, as an invitation|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: last board and 15-15|pg||
nt|idblu: 2 bds to go|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last match tonight in about 20 mins: JC  Scotland v Wales|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: OR is finished|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I mean 6-4 in majors|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sorry two to go|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ralfwil: for me E has an opening with 4-4 in majors and 12 P|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@H  didn't go off   oh dear oh dear|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: ah we missed board 10|pg||
nt|april7: cuebid|pg||
nt|april7: almost 6|pg||
nt|eggy: I suppose that NI must be about the most experienced team this year Mike|pg||
nt|daman: should just jump to game now|pg||
nt|daman: signing off|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: then E might continue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the trouble with Easts 2 spade bid, its difficult for the west hand to stop|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don;t see why W would nopt bid stayman no matter what their range is|pg||
nt|cindy: i know|pg||
nt|cindy: maybe not sure of their methods|pg||
nt|cindy: this could get doubled|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some results on :http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if NS were vul this would get doubled|pg||
nt|bobh1: N should double in my opinion|pg||
nt|cindy: heart A wont be good lead|pg||
nt|dburn: What you are doing is claiming that East underbid with 1NT, but that is because you saw all four hands. Maybe West underbid by passing 2@s.|pg||
nt|cindy: no  it is NOT because i saw all four hands|pg||
pc|s8|nt|eggy: certainly the 3 mowen hace been in the JC for the last 4 years|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS can do a lot of damage to this, buti cant double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this auction can;t be right, can it?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Is this right Helen?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Is this right?|pg||
nt|mamos: so 3NT sahowed a @S stop     .......|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but N may feel that facing a NV weak 2 they are not necessarily odds-on to make game, and they are not that likely to beat 4S more than one|pg||
nt|bobh1: She has 3 tricks, maybe partner has one |pg||
nt|capercliff: now to mke it|pg||
nt|idblu: this helps|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: another tricky contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: :(   no problem |pg||
nt|cindy: i totally believe in upgrading with a good five card suit   |pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: lots of undos|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|eggy: women|pg||
nt|mamos: it's very hard to do vugraph operation thanks to our op she's done great|pg||
nt|ralfwil: absolute the best lead!|pg||
nt|cindy: and all aces and kings outside|pg||
nt|cindy: and W also underbid|pg||
nt|cindy: conconservatives|pg||
nt|cindy: coconservatives|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|idblu: who likes 2@h over 2@s|pg||
nt|idblu: at least 3@H, 1@S and 2@c to lose|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Jack was the card...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: daclarer a chance now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we all pass the North hand?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mamos: NS have no losers but a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|daman: what possible reason would he have to continue after 4@H?   he would pass|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H or 4@H, which is stronger?|pg||
nt|mamos: yes the WElsh team also have played in the JC and PB for some years|pg||
nt|cindy: what is this auction ?|pg||
nt|mamos: nope  wrong operator|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it may be 3 hearts from west, etc|pg||
nt|hedyg: operator pls undo!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Helens done really well so far, thanks|pg||
nt|hedyg: AFTER 2@S PASS BY S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ... but its hard not to bid 2 spades also|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok this is a short version of the bidding|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cindy: i assure you i make no comments based on seeing all the hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not me i play 21|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yo_yo: 2/1|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|daman: 3@H|pg||
nt|daman: leaves room for exploration|pg||
nt|mamos: and ew are to high|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 3@H E bid 3NT and W 4@s|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep 2 spades went -2 OR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: like it would help, right?|pg||
nt|cindy: right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lol|pg||
nt|idblu: 3rd chair I open|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1NT looks possible |pg||
nt|idblu: made 1N in OR|pg||
nt|capercliff: passing twice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Borderline whther she should re-open or not. After all partner is a passed hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|odysseus69: 6H is enough although cards friendly for grand |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks are easy with 2-2 in @h and 3-3 in @c|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I like passing vs Acol (say) as they are usually in the wrong contract cf 15 in OR|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|april7: so E with 7 controls might invite for slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and could not act over 1@C|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|daman: he would cuebid 3@S over 3 @H   yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I hope all comments are based on experience|pg||
nt|capercliff: if S cant bid over 1@c then there is no future|pg||
pc|s7|nt|eggy: well Cat has, but 3 year ago they were struggling to put a team in at all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when i make comments i usually haven;t even seen any of the hands|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cindy: lolol|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|daman: she :)|pg||
nt|mamos: mine mostly based on ignorance :(|pg||
nt|capercliff: then again I would have bid 1@h over 1@c|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|idblu: :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wilkinsona: play seems to have drifted now..|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mamos: next hand|pg||
nt|cindy: not agreeing with either of you|pg||
nt|idblu: N will get endplayed in @D eventually|pg||
pc|d3|nt|april7: then 4@C by E and might end up to high though|pg||
nt|cindy: mike and marshall|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|idblu: auction will go the same|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|daman: cannot bid 3@S and 4@C simultaneously Avram|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as usual lol|pg||
nt|mamos: ow?|pg||
nt|cindy: ew?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I liked that Mike! But you must consider bidding and the hand who has to act|pg||
nt|mamos: did declarer duck @Dk|pg||
pc|cK|nt|eggy: do you think 3S guarantees a void?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c7|nt|eggy: otherwise 4NT would be rather imprecise i think|pg||
nt|april7: after a further Cue by W another cue by E|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@C would have been interesting but the @d overcall cut the suit out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surely E did not bid 4S. he barely had a 2S bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: could be +1 for a push now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: should not bid either of them over 3@h - East has judged this pretty well|pg||
nt|daman: West will not cue|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|hedyg: he bid 3NT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: and cindy and Marshall and ralf|pg||
pc|h3|pc|dT|pc|d9|pg||
nt|idblu: home now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: heart needed|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h7|pc|s5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3S looked like a fragment promising a singleton C- probably 4C for void|pg||
nt|idblu: lose 1|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: club looses|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he cant believe he can make a @H   trick|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mamos: well successfully done anyway|pg||

nt|yo_yo: and 4 of other major|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk4: and 6-4 in the majors. It has all the flaws for a weak 2|pg||

mb|p|nt|capercliff: uh oh|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mamos: Yes Victor I was thinking EW might get too high but if they do they may make game :)|pg||
nt|mamos: about 1NT NS?|pg||
nt|mamos: and to NIBU and Sandie Millerchip for organising event in Belfast|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I donÂ´t like weak nt with a 5-card major|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sadly NI got it wrong OR|pg||
nt|mamos: West did something she will regret in OR  the pressure is great|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: nothing like a few flaws, Roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d i assume is not meant to be a two suiter|pg||
nt|capercliff: phew tx operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: no way for this to go off it seems..|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: happy with 1Nt rather than 1S?|pg||
nt|oliverc: I hve a religious aversion to 1NT here :)|pg||
nt|eggy: I would usually, but I think this a suit oriented hand|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to the spectators and to your commentators , George Avram David and Steve|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to the players and Philip our operator  Good job|pg||
nt|april7: thank you all and bye till next time we meet|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: The Spade suit has good texture  prefer 1@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps with 5 small in the major|pg||
nt|eggy: Not that I'd be totally happy if East responds 2D|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to NIBU especially Sandie the match organiser and BGB|pg||
nt|mamos: well EW inthe auction|pg||
nt|cindy: wouldnt it be more productive to open 1S in 3rd seat than to let them get two bids in first|pg||
nt|bobh1: assuming support x's, pass with the S hand might be attractive|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry I'm sure Sandie will forgive me|pg||
nt|lestergold: not meant to have 4 hearts on the side|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to tony kath and cliff|pg||

nt|idblu: thx everyone...fun working with you all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: and fred didnt i type that sorry fred|pg||
nt|mamos: helen well done|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: i think playing 15-17 it's different - but prefer 5 card Stayman then as well|pg||
nt|mamos: lastly thanks to you all for spending time with us on BBO|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have to say i could hardly pass 4S once S has doubled 3C. there goes my whole hand on defense|pg||
pc|h5|nt|odysseus69: there are 2 schools of thought - (1) all 5-3-3-2 hands in range should open 1NT and (2) touchy-feely- some yes and some no|pg||
nt|oliverc: what about (3) Never!! ?? LOL|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: this has chances as cards lie|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|c7|nt|idblu: nowadays a weak 2 in a major can have 4 in the other major|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mamos: results are now up for first four rounds http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|odysseus69: those in the always 1NT school include Andrew Robson and Chris Dixon|pg||
pc|d9|nt|odysseus69: plaaying strong NT the choice is not available|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If W opens with 1@s EW probably had reached 4@s|pg||
nt|mamos: The score is still 0-0 because we have no comparisons yet - I guess that there will be quite a few imps swapping hands in a moment|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am a touchy-feely but in the interests of partner harmony I have decided to go with 1NT for a while but I am keeping a note now |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mamos: Does anyone know reults for other tables this round?|pg||
nt|idblu: this should make easily|pg||
nt|jtr: I am the only one just north of it|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so thanks David|pg||
nt|yo_yo: make sure the youngsters get to bed early David!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: agree Cindy. A third hand opening is to prefer here|pg||
nt|jtr: Pleasure:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: could easily be a double game swing, especially if S has a stiff diamond, which is far from unlikely|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ralfwil: Bye!|pg||
nt|mamos: bye all :))|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bye all|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so a last board win for England, thanks to all in Belfast and see you soon |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|oliverc: I must confess, opening the West hand with 1NT when 2@C isn't 5-card Stayman|pg||
nt|oliverc: seems a little self-defeating to me|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suspect that even with 1S opener they would have stopped in 3S which looks enough|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well there are a few schools of thought on that subject Fred|pg||
nt|lestergold: very favourable hts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: most come down against that one|pg||
nt|idblu: anyone do a bed check?|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to bbo and to NIBU especially Sandy Millership (last year after the dinner on Sunday we played Speedball at about 1am and Sandy was the winner |pg||
nt|jtr: The dogs?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|mamos: 1@S opening seems normal in third at favorable|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: unless it's a very weak suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|idblu: I don't disagree....but many do....very old school :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: looksm like about 11 tricks probbaly two trumpo tricks for the defence now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: on this hand EW would have found game with west passing, so no harm done|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|mc|11|nt|idblu: thx again..gn all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: phew it was a hard set|pg||
pg||
