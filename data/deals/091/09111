nt|daman: and here we go...|pg||
nt|hedyg: if S overcalls 1@s......|pg||
nt|daman: looks like a @H game for EW|pg||
nt|pelu: @D10 in S - so 10 tricks in @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h should be reached by e/w but both finesses wrong and some duplication andn looks like 1 off|pg||
nt|daman: and NS might compete in @S   depends how high they will reach|pg||
nt|chthonic: Yes, diamond goes on fourth club and a diamond lead is of no help, even with two finesses losing|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|lestergold: dim can go awaydepends on timing |pg||
nt|daman: they can pitch the losing @D on their 4th @C|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|nt|daman: right|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3card bergen raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: yes it looks like declarer will get home in practice|pg||
nt|lestergold: due to layout of dim suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry 4 card, misclick|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chthonic: An easy warmup hand|pg||
nt|daman: a straightforward play hand    won't take too long|pg||
