nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Carlos|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Textbook bidding to start|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb: Hi David, Roland|pg||
nt|ady: hi Roland    Henry|pg||
nt|henryb: and Liz|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|ady: cash KC   looks like 7 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There are in game next door would you believe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East thought his hand was worth 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: after a few other bids|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I like an optimist - he added a few points for luck|pg||
nt|henryb: yes. East could not resist bidding Stayman, and West with his 16 carried on over 2N I bet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not quite|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East bid 2@C  Puppet, and over 2@D forced, East bid 2@H to show spades|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: Then 2NT  3NT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cuttysark: Anyway, it rather makes the overtrick here irrelevant|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d9|nt|ady: why no play a 2nd spade ?|pg||
nt|henryb: 220 and 190 is an imp difference|pg||

nt|jtr: Good morning people|pg||
nt|jtr: Happy St David's Day|pg||
nt|jtr: So, the action replays commence|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: yes they were such interesting boards that we wish to play them again|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Carryforward is actually 6.5 IMPs but we can't do fractions|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good evening from Vancouver|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|fabsayc: two more segments of 12 boards to decide the Yeh Cup|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: So, not particularly low-scoring.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 19 imps in 8 boards is quite low-scoring where I come from|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is some sort of three-way match, which some sort of scoring method to see who wins. (I thought I would share that with you).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play a lot of transfers and relays|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Al Hollander, Mike Gold, Martin Johnson and David Burn|pg||
nt|dburn: might be better to show it as 7, then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=5-11|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: Netherlands lead is actually 8.5 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Very sharp this morning David|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Scoring: if you win both your matches, you go through|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugrapha3: if each team wins a match, the scores are converted to VPs|pg||
nt|jtr: Not an appertising choice for East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@S in open room|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jtr: I much prefer Fredin's action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 16+ HCP Fallenius would have bid artificial 2@C|pg||
pc|d8|nt|brolucius: Even after a diamond lead, in the other room, I was told by a learned kibitzer that 2@S could have gone two down with best defence.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so east is limited to 15 HCP|pg||
nt|lestergold: mike fromEngland back hi all|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jtr: He is happier now though|pg||
nt|jtr: I read somewhere that you should lead trumps against a doubled partscore|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Nick Fahrer. Good morning to you|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jtr: In one of your books maybe David?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I read that in "The Pairs Game"|pg||
nt|jtr: Hehe|pg||
nt|brolucius: I never lead trumps, so you are asking the wrong person.|pg||
nt|jtr: Must have been one of my books then|pg||
nt|brolucius: "I could hardly lead a trump when I had @DK-10-7-2 as an alternative."|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can't say I like the 2@D overcall - I prefer to get majors into the game|pg||
nt|jtr: Yep, said that myself Liz|pg||
nt|jtr: Much as i hate agreeing with you|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Must hurt a lot, David|pg||
nt|fabsayc: rehi, this should make|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pitiful: will he find @c lead, unlikely|pg||
nt|pitiful: sorry private|pg||
nt|jtr: What else?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing a strong 1@C system, North had the option of passing 1@H.|pg||
nt|jtr: Other than a trump|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he is touching a diamond|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, a lively board to open the session. That is what we like.|pg||
nt|jtr: @d would not work well|pg||
nt|jtr: I am half asleep so it doesnt hurt that much|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugrapha3: hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the auction strongly suggests leading trump -- Brink didn't let his holding talk him out of the lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brolucius: When two BBO commentators agree, they are almost certain to be wrong.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well now with an overtrick|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: West's decision to double on the third round, suggests that he does not hold primary club support and may therefore be good in diamonds.|pg||
nt|jtr: Maximum one down now i would say|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hopes to shorten his trump - but a club would be better|pg||
nt|brolucius: We can see that a club lead would work well, but I would not have fancied it when holding those East cards. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe a trump is best from his point of view|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Bird's Law|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|jtr: Other than a @c maybe the @hJ was an option  Partner has shown length there|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not that anyone ever agrees with what I say.|pg||
nt|jtr: Thelma?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: So had South!|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: EW cards just fit too well|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: Hello David, Mike, Martin and Henry|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Roland and all|pg||
nt|dburn: good evening|pg||
nt|henryb: good evening David|pg||
nt|henryb: Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: Yo Henry!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: now we will set a crossruff of sorts|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|s3|nt|jtr: noooo|pg||
nt|jtr: I just cannot understand that|pg||
nt|dburn: it may not have happened|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it did |pg||
nt|jtr: Exactly|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would not have bid 1@S with three-card support. So, he was marked with @HK-x. |pg||
nt|jtr: Can you see the logic DB?|pg||
nt|dburn: in that case, I don't understand it either|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however this has done most of the work for declarer|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cuttysark: I guess he did not want to establish dummy's hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he succeeded in that objective at least|pg||
nt|jtr: Suggested that East may have a singleton @h  But i dont think that is possible on the bidding|pg||
nt|jtr: Although the @h6 may have confused Fredin|pg||
nt|jtr: I am sure it wont be Fredin's fault anyway.....|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I believe they play reverse count|pg||
nt|dburn: I am pretty certain they do|pg||
nt|brolucius: North is more or less marked with only four spades by East's pass of 2@S doubled. He would not have bid 1@S with four spades and three-card heart support. Nor would he have passed ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: the first double (rather than bidding 2@H then).|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or Upside Down to the nonBrits|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, I have to agree with her. |pg||
pc|c2|nt|jtr: So 1IMP for Sweden|pg||
nt|brolucius: The defence is going well.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unexpected gain - -470 is not normally a winning score|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jtr: After this result we are going to have a very close match|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jtr: Well, had he played the @hJ i dont think the second low @h would cost|pg||
nt|cuttysark: As do all Scandinavians, I am informed|pg||
nt|jtr: I have seen some play standard count|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thought you would have, David :)|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|jtr: Not home yet anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: they weren't actually playing it, but his eyesight isn't what it used to be|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: MEck says sorry for taking so long|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am also informed that Norwegians play standard count. Does that mean they are not Scandinavian?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he needs to think about this - but I expect he'll pitch a club eventually|pg||
nt|jtr: If he ruffs it gives East trump control i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer must know, from the bidding, almost exactly how the remaining cards lie.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: still thinking|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps, but a while ago it seemed that no one had the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|jtr: So maybe he has to pitch a @c?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dburn: well done|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice play|pg||
pc|s8|nt|cuttysark: Can't understand why Fredin covered this one - should he not duck?|pg||
nt|jtr: he has maybe played the game before?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|brolucius: It has been a limbo competition between the two West players, both trying to duck under the other one's score.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks as if NS have got themselves endplayed|pg||
nt|jtr: South must duck the @c when North plays one|pg||
nt|kit: hi all|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|cuttysark: OK, nearly!|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: perhaps he has only just discovered that he had the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: and wanted to reassure everyone that it was still in the deck|pg||
nt|dburn: but ducking would not have made much difference to the result, only to the order of play by which it was obtained|pg||
nt|brolucius: West heard the mutterings from kibitzers when he ducked the @HA the first two times and decided he had better not do it again.|pg||
mc|8|nt|fabsayc: welcome to Kit Woolsey|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Not the best defence so likely only 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Is it usual to put on the highest from a sequence, when partner plays the suit. I normally play the lowest. Here @dJ from J10xx|pg||
mb|2C|nt|henryb: 170 and 140 is also an imp: 5 or 4|pg||
nt|ady: think they might get overboard here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Quite hard to hold it to 7 tricks, I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: 2@H seems a bit windy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as in wet?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: British weather|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thinking of catching up?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: still, he caught up|pg||
nt|henryb: seems to me it shows proper appreciation of the lack of value of quacks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: but even so, this is rather trappy bidding|pg||
nt|ady: only need club finesse and hearts behaving|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|henryb: or a @s lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Is 3@H invitational for any of you? It isn't for me. You have lots of other bids available for an invite|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, competitive|pg||
nt|ady: have to get diamonds soon|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Purely competing - looks as if North revalued his collection|pg||
nt|henryb: yes all those quacks suddenly became 6 high card points!|pg||
nt|henryb: (quacks are queens and jacks)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Manaca should know declarer has the singleton @SK|pg||
nt|ady: was  this the 2@C lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did partner not lead a spade? Because he doesn't have both top honours|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb: yes. a sensible person who does not play MUD|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cuttysark: Yes - @C2, 3rd & 5th|pg||
nt|ady: next a@D|pg||

nt|jtr: It happens|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Norway do not score up with Sweden|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lead now only 5.5 :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the running score is correct here, not sure if the online site is working|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in the playoff for 3-4, bridge i norge leads hampson 40-27|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = WEAK @H or @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 2@d is short @ds|pg||
nt|brolucius: Easy to be wise after the event, but perhaps West's second double was a little bold? He was perhaps worried that Rodwell had opened very light in 3rd seat and they were being ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: talked out of a contract their way.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|jtr: 4-4-4-1 or 3-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|dburn: if South had raised 1@s to 2@s, West would have doubled|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: with the excellent fit, 4s by n/s has chances especially played by south|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i believe this is a sound weak two bid, they use multi also|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Could be 4-4-0-5 too thanks to a spec for that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble means what?|pg||
nt|kit: apparently this 2@S opener is more than a weak 2|pg||
nt|kit: Otherwise, West wouldn't be probing for game|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugrapha3: 8-11|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dburn: not sure what shapes Rodwell can have for this, but Meckstroth knows he has a fit in one of the majors|pg||
nt|dburn: bid your major|pg||
nt|dburn: pass might be diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: wow, was 2@C meaning "just kidding"|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: that is some stop with Fredin's hand opposite an opening bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: an unexciting and untaxing 2h|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: and perhaps he wants to play in spades even facing 3=4=1=5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like they might beat this one|pg||
nt|jtr: I am sure he only guarantees 3@ss|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Still it is a guaranteed 8-card fit, quite likely 9, with a secondary heart fit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West's play should be suit preference here, since he must know this is a singlelton|pg||
nt|brolucius: He does now, anyway...|pg||
nt|jtr: wow nice 2NT bid to have available|pg||
nt|brolucius: Any kibitzers who are confused about the scoring for this stage of the event would be well advised not to ask me about it.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well no probs in spades at the 2 level|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so does that imply fredin could have bid his own major if he had one?|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, some play that 2@h shows preparedness to compete facing spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: David is right  2@D-DBL-P=@D|pg||
nt|dburn: and others that 2@h means "I have my own hearts"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 2@H not forcing, why the alert|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very good stop|pg||
nt|kit: it turns out that 4@S comes home, since South doesn't have the entries to lead hearts twice|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or the strong enough spots|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn: must he? would East not lead @hA from a doubleton?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: When dummy has shown hearts?|pg||
nt|jtr: Based on the last hand, he may lead it before it runs away:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this an advert against 2@D opener?  nat bidding may have gone 2@H-DBL-P-2@S;3@S|pg||
nt|dburn: well, South had the option of raising spades in this auction also|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jtr: One team goes through out of the three|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same thing applies if they are not using this redouble treatment|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: probably still not 4@S but defending 3@S always better than defending 2@S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: Hah!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: not much to do with the 2@d opening as far as I can see|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|jtr: Either by winning both matches or by a better IMP-VP score|pg||
nt|brolucius: I gathered that much.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: south understandably devalued his qx hts- he was not ton know that it was gold dust |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink was concerned about black suit tenaces in the auction too|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Ah - had not considered their new defesive strategy|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|henryb: presumably it carried some strength message that is abnormal|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently 2@C denies 3 hearts, and 2@H is invite|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jtr: Hmm very trusting not cashing the @d|pg||

nt|cuttysark: That would be artistic!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|ady: 5@D  ok here     |pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 20 less than 38|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Thank you Henry - did you compute the singletong @HQ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb: yes. picking up hearts is 52% and the club finesse is 50%.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|dburn: better reach 6NT by East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on board 1 sweden did not compete, and lost 5 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: The South player name has changed from Brogeland to Nystrom. A kibitzer suggests that the North name should change too, to Bertheau. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems reasonable|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 2+ BAL 11-13/17-19  or  4+ UNBAL|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C the best slam, but played by east|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jtr: How many @ss?|pg||
nt|jtr: Just 4 probably :)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he may bid some number of clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this has been a battle of dutch bidding more, sometimes gaining, sometimes going down a lot|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: in an attempt to secure the right lead against diamonds, should the opponents bid a lot of those|pg||
nt|brolucius: They are using screens, so Lindqvist might not know that he has turned up for the wrong match.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He may fondly imagine that his correct partner is the other side.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: David Burn has such a story|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: thanks for waking me up|pg||
nt|jtr: it did happen once to my knowledge|pg||
nt|jtr: A player used the bathroom and went back to the wrong table|pg||
nt|dburn: 6NT may be slightly better|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 4@c may be @cs|pg||
nt|brolucius: Did he change a losing score into a winning one?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: North is not sure that's their agreement and now Nystrom is explaining, a bit unsure too|pg||
nt|kit: E-W have good 6@S here -- not so easy to bid, I don't think|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jtr: and @ss of course|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Would be Fit for many|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, the correct player returned too quickly|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is not easy at all|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|dburn: and Bertens-Bakkeren couldn't manage it|pg||
nt|lestergold: now east must protect his KH|pg||
nt|lestergold: and i predict he will go for 6N|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed the other room bid 4@h and made it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: requies diagnosing the double fit and the key controls|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Needs to sneak a @h then cross-ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: presumabkly thenb spade lead and dim finesse getting rid of club- as i said he would have to make it the only line!|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what a dreadful contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D now by fredin to ask for stopper?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Fredin thinking|pg||
nt|henryb: 3N has no play at all|pg||
nt|henryb: but 2@d won't make either|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well it does but not on the layout|pg||
nt|lestergold: but hard to avoid bidding it|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dburn: he must, but it's not clear he will know that he has enough tricks for 6NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has litle choice now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but now he knows fredin has two hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he can certainly assume so|pg||
nt|dburn: if 6@d showed a diamond void|pg||
nt|dburn: how will 2@h play?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fredin disagrees i think|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@h probably will make|pg||
nt|dburn: that is, assuming it isn't forcing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H is treacherous also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there are some issues too with slam, probably beaten on heart lead|pg||
nt|kit: true -- the threatened ruff and 4-1 spade split will prevent declarer from getting needed club ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually it can still be made|pg||
nt|kit: but pretty difficult for North to not lead a club, I would say|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north caught in a squeeze throw in|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks spectators, i was working it all out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another 6 on board 2, no surprise, dutch bid the skinny game|pg||
nt|kit: seems like East is worth some kind of move here, with partner showing a strong hand and 4 spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but what bid, 5@C?|pg||
nt|kit: doesn't matter that much what move he makes -- the important thing is that he makes some move|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Most players would have thought for longer, what to do on the North cards. He had already shown the value of his hand in diamonds, though, and could judge from South's pass that he ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: probably held a weak NT type.|pg||
nt|jtr: But if North rises then he has the @h suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D = 2 key cards + void|pg||
nt|henryb: lose the @d, take the @s hook, spade ruff, then win the next trick and play @hA and a heart|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Well, this will be interesting. They have found the sacrifice and we will see how much it costs them, with that club break. |pg||
nt|lestergold: well Fallenius knows it does|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well if he does not bid clubs how can fredin cooperate|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
nt|dburn: but even so, he may believe that North has @hA anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: or hope so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6S by fallenius|pg||
nt|dburn: so there is close to no chance that he will bid 6NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS get kudos for the effective barrage|pg||
nt|henryb: you will lose eventually 3 @h and two kings|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jtr: Might be 300 only|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He needs somehow to organise club ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|jtr: I must say North took a bit of a gamble|pg||
nt|dburn: there may be some doubt as to what 2@h means following a double - no doubt Fallenius would have passed by now if it were "garbage Stayman"|pg||
nt|henryb: I think NT only has 7 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cuttysark: To gain 3, or lose 2 if he is three down|pg||
nt|kit: Freden can look at his great trumph holding and his AK of hearts and queen in partner's suit and bid slam -- that's how he can cooperate|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s2|nt|jtr: I would prefer the @sJ to ask for a @h|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or deny holding @SK?|pg||
nt|jtr: Suit preference usually applies when dummy has a singleton|pg||
nt|brolucius: A club switch will not make much difference, as it happens.|pg||
nt|jtr: Possibly he wanted another @s|pg||
nt|jtr: to shorten dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Fallenius gets bigger kudos for getting operator to chance final contract|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jtr: High asks @h, low asks @c middle is encouraging|pg||
nt|jtr: Surely he will pitch a @h?|pg||
nt|henryb: and this has 8 no matter how he plays it|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jtr: But maybe he hopes the @cs will behave and he can set up discards|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: Looks a good idea, since he cannot really expect to avoid a heart loser. No, he has ruffed.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Don't call you Shirley|pg||
nt|jtr: Elizabeth Shirley McGowan?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I predict a club|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that made me dizzy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should fredin get trump right after Drijver preempt?   probably|pg||
nt|dburn: one would think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: well amazing that the contract was wrong sided in both rooms|pg||
nt|dburn: no, it wasn't|pg||
nt|dburn: North bid hearts first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ruff-sluff actually best defense|pg||
nt|dburn: East had no clue either that South had @hA or that West had seven club tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: 3rd @H guarantees trump trick for the defense|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brolucius: Better to wait and see what he does, Liz, before making any predictions. |pg||
nt|jtr: @cs 3-2 with the K onside and trumps breaking he would make this|pg||
nt|jtr: So it was fair enough to ruff i guess|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Being wrong is my life - I am used to it :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d6|nt|vugrapha3: All 3 matches are 1-sided and each team is leading in 1, it will come down to VPs|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@C = WEAK 2@D  or  ART 20+ [not 22-24 bal = 2N]|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|jtr: I was wondering:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So this is the closest match|pg||
nt|brolucius: Rodwell chose to advance on the South cards, facing a 21-23 point balanced hand.|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: crikey|pg||
nt|dburn: double may be defined as takeout of spades, rather than just "lead a diamond"|pg||
nt|lestergold: is this correct?|pg||
nt|henryb: wow. apparently the double of 4@d was takeout of @s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S makes i think|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: but David is that their understanding?|pg||
nt|dburn: a somewhat unusual treatment, but it may not work too badly here|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: it makes lots of sense at this vuls|pg||
nt|henryb: as in one down or beat 5@s|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it seems to be North's understanding at any rate, unless he has suddenly gone raving mad|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|jtr: How many is the 2NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Puppet Stayman, showing four spades.|pg||
nt|dburn: 21-23 or so|pg||
nt|jtr: 21-23?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: At the moment I think Sweden will go through|pg||
nt|jtr: So it seems very close|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This should be a nice 7/8 imp pick-up for the Swedes, then|pg||
nt|brolucius: A US kibitzer suggested to me that Meckstroth would follow exactly the same sequence used by Bertheau here, but he rebid 2NT instead.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jtr: 1@h was Kokish i guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, they have done brilliantly to stop in 1NT and will deserve a swing.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 21-23, the operator told you :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: hmaltho 11 tricks maid in the open room, a dim lead and ht switch looks like curtains|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: but if it is their understanding, he won't know to lead a diamond, but...|pg||
nt|lestergold: or a ht from south wheneevr?|pg||
nt|dburn: at least he has avoided leading a heart|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dburn: so that Rodwell had to try for game in case North had four spades|pg||
nt|jtr: Sorry Liz, but he didnt tell me|pg||
nt|jtr: Forced 1@s then 1NT showed more than an immediate 1NT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: three losers not running away here surely?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder what west was doubling on -- maybe he thinks the double of 2@C was other than just lead-directing|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fredin is commited to doubling for penalty, there have been several adventures like this|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: You have to watch the top right bidding panel|pg||
nt|jtr: he is being far too competent|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, he may make 3NT anyway if East ducks @cQ now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, not many VG operators find the time to put in bidding explanations. We are lucky today.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Probably 20-21, which would not interest South. Mecjstroth showed 21-23|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 1NT is 20-22|pg||
nt|jtr: Not that 1NT is very comfortable either|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jtr: I try not to look at the bidding, it just complicates matters|pg||

nt|fabsayc: well he has to assume it is anyway|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: West gave a reverse-count signal (@C8) on the first round of clubs, so that East will know whether to hold up on the second round of clubs. Oh... so much for that.|pg||
nt|jtr: @c8 must be just count not Smith|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - @H10 is inexplicable if playing Smith|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dburn: but he didn't - well done|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: It is a wonderful fit for N-S.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Both Wests have bid Michaels over the transfer|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is a great fit for N-S. Meckstroth-Rodwell did well to bid 4@H, even though West had indicated spades (with a Michaels bid) over South's @SK-x.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: A clever understanding by the Swedes, which leaves more room for South to express his hand - if East passes - than 3@H would.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i get the feeling they won't bid 4@S, which is likely though not certain to make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if minors reversed, would Drijver rebid 1N or 2@S?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could go wrong here|pg||

nt|kit: I don't know that 4@S would make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: arrgh, the non killing lead|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jtr: Maybe just take-out of @hs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: though not certain- and 2NT may not be making- passing 2Nt is a reasonable option|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess South could have made himself declarer|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems that the ranges are 12-14 and 14-16, so South has not bid so boldly at this table. |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h not the greatest contract in the world here but with thefavourable lie of the reds it will roll in for a push|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well he has a pitch now so comes out the same|pg||

nt|kit: But 3NT for N-S is looking pretty good now|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some South players would justify stopping low with: 'I did not like my @SK-x under the Michaels bid'. It is amazing how often that is not the case and partner has something good in ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: spades. |pg||
nt|jtr: I really see no reason that 2@h was Michaels  other than he has the right shape|pg||
nt|cuttysark: When you have the club in your bag, you just gotta use it|pg||
nt|dburn: it is possible to play that double is takeout of hearts, and 2@h is Michaels|pg||
nt|dburn: but some prefer double to be just diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: and others that double is "I would have doubled 1NT", depending on the range of the opening bid|pg||
nt|jtr: Three rounds of @cs would annoy Meck|pg||
nt|dburn: I imagine he woud bid 1NT with either @d973 and @cK2 or @dK2 and @c973|pg||

nt|dburn: the trouble is, though, that if 2@h really was Michaels, declarer knows to ruff this high|pg||

nt|dburn: or, of course, he can take a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|jtr: How does he cash the @hK though?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Open room auction not same as here because Nystrom-Bertheau play Big Club and 14-16 NT that included 5M|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could not anyway, the heart 10 discard destroyed that|pg||
nt|kit: why?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, it was a fine defence. West had every reason to think that North would hold the @CK but could see that he needed East to hold it to give the defence a chance.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jtr: No Stayman i think|pg||
nt|jtr: Not for me anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Assuming this is 15-17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: netherlands rusty after having the night off?   sweden 14-0 so far|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so upper limit was 13|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|dburn: a bit odd to bid 1@s rather than some immediate heart raise, but...|pg||
nt|kit: defense can get 2 hearts, 2 diamonds, 1 spade|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jtr: and return to hand for the finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver-Brink range = 15-17|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx to kindly 3/3 spade break 4h is cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Quite rightly, neither West player has thought it worthwhile to look for a 4-4 heart fit (on their 4-3-3-3 shape).|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some might use five-card Stayman in case there was a 5-4 heart fit, but that is statistically unlikely and you would give information away.|pg||
nt|lestergold: Fallenius hoping to hear another suit|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|dburn: ...he may think that South will be better placed to reject or accept an invitation if he knows of spades opposite|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wish granted|pg||
nt|dburn: he may have thought it likely that Fredin would bid 2@c to show 16+|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cuttysark: Hard to see how this can be anything other than a flat board|pg||
nt|jtr: yes it can be done a spec points out|pg||
nt|lestergold: passing this to be expected- he is happy to get out of the aucion now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently he intended 3@C next over major rebid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes your right|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, in effect no Stayman anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: Must have been the 'NT invite' type, which suggests East's 1NT is only 14-16.|pg||
nt|henryb: I feel sure he would have passed 2@s|pg||
nt|kit: in fact, it might have given West the clue he needed|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|jtr: after ruffing with A@H, play 8@H to K@H then play @S|pg||
nt|dburn: only one?|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|dburn: I've had about forty telling me that 4@h is cold|pg||
nt|jtr: No, a lot more (including you) now|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, judging by the last hand South does not need much persuasion to bid game anyway|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: which is a bit hard, since I wasn't the one who said it wasn't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agreed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bad result was East's fault :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jtr: 2@s is useful, you dont have the problem of finding a @h fit|pg||
nt|jtr: Others use Stayman to invite even with no major|pg||
nt|jtr: uh?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 6@H not a great contract, but with spades 3-3 and a good club guess it can make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what was 4@D|pg||
nt|kit: South showed some interest with the 4@D call, so North might not be done|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well this is anexcellent contract which would have chances ofmaking even on a 4/2 spade break and an early club attack|pg||
mb|5H|nt|jtr: I asked how it could be made and answer came there none except from one spec|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|kit: I assume it was a last train type of bid -- the only available encouraging noise which is still below game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: certainly would be bad not to be in  it|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he would, but 2@s would have been limited to 15, so he might have bid 3@c anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: they should cue what they have so i can follow their auctions :)|pg||
nt|kit: it was the only Q he could make|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Kit is right|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: I don't expect declarer to get this right -- more normal will be to just lead a club to jack, which only requires queen onside -- doesn't need any kind of splits|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have the felling fredin's double actually helped them|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|brolucius: Declarer unblocks the @C7 to free the way for a finesse of the @C6.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you make it sound as if you think it is going down|pg||

nt|fabsayc: but surely he will test spades first|pg||

nt|dburn: well, perhaps there are not many whose specialist subject is the bleeding obvious|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: No, but I must make sure to use it soon.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Declarer played well to make 5@C doubled in the Open Room. E-W will do well to flatten the board.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: You will pay me royalties?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thelma and I play Scrabble when on holiday (with a gin and tonic) and I will surprise her with 'quandary' for 72 points.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- missed IF 42@S |pg||
nt|lestergold: not really david suggested that brink was an optimisic biddwer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe because fallenius passed originally and already showed diamond ace|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|jtr: Do you play for money?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT now shows a sound raise to 3@S at least. 'Good raise to 2@S'? That's a bit pessimistic.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: which indeed he is but that was not an optimistic bid|pg||
nt|kit: so -- he wouldn't have opened with just 2 aces, would he?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|jtr: Well, you didnt say it was obvious let alone say how when i asked you|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: No, for the occasional honour of beating me.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am stretching for an explanation|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I think 10-13|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 2+@C BAL (12-14 or 18-20) or 12+ 4+@C unbal|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: The 3@c induced the 'save'|pg||
nt|fabsayc: did fredin really bid 2@C?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a scramble- where will they settle?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: rd=clubs or reds|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w will do well here to defend as 3N their way does not look too great|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it seems we are in 800 territory no matter what|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: so 1N rebid is12-14|pg||
nt|dburn: did West really bid 2@c, or was that North?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still unknown @C length|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now thatFredin has doubled 2c they are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably best of a bad lot is 2h|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: I suspect that North bid 2@c as a puppet to 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: I bet she enjoys beating you|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Tight doubles are not so expensive at game level when they go wrong|pg||
nt|dburn: this may not have gone wrong yet - declarer still has to sort out the clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are two interesting contests here: Burn v Greenwood and Sweden v USA Hampson.|pg||
nt|jtr: lolol|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I prefer the latter|pg||
nt|jtr: I have some Russian support though|pg||
nt|brolucius: One is more hard-fought than the other.|pg||
nt|lestergold: these boys have good kit to land in this spot|pg||
nt|kit: this could already be too high if spades misguessed and defense shifts to clubs in time|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|jtr: He may guess them after South has 4@ds|pg||
nt|dburn: but South might not cash the second diamond|pg||
nt|jtr: He doesnt want to shorten dummy and force the @c guess|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Declarer will be expecting the 10-10 split of points from the bidding|pg||
nt|jtr: But a @h gives the discard|pg||
nt|brolucius: North might hold a singleton @DJ.|pg||
nt|dburn: he will. but he won't know the location of the spade honours|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But placing @DAK in South, perhaps he will place @CQ in North?|pg||
nt|jtr: a sort of Morton's Fork position|pg||
nt|lestergold: i see 3n made in open room so they need 800 to profit|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|lestergold: here come hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: brink knew his partner had hearts also, but anything undoubled would be fine with him|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: still, he will not place South with a balanced hand for his jump to 4@s, so he may well play him for short clubs anyway|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Very uncomfortable|pg||
nt|jtr: For South|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This will be 9 imps back to Sweden, now looking like the qualifier from this section|pg||
nt|dburn: one might be tempted to ask whether West really did underlead the ace of spades on this bidding, but only if one did not know Peter Fredin|pg||
nt|dburn: 3NT was pretty well played and well defended at the other table|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - he doesn't have to play a third diamond|pg||
nt|jtr: Sweden -Norway +42|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|dburn: it eventually made on a black-suit squeeze against South|pg||
nt|lestergold: what about this one canhe get out for three off?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: playoff for 3rd/4th between USA Hampson and Bridge i Norge has been reduced to 32 boards -- we'll see those tables in action concurrently with 2nd half of the finals|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has only eight top losers, but the defenders can almost certainly separate their trump tricks|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jtr: hmmmm|pg||
nt|jtr: Meck will ruff this of course:)|pg||
nt|dburn: but declarer can do so himself, of course, and now he probably has enough information|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|brolucius: East hopes to find his partner with a 'glint of steel' (as Reese used to call it) for his vulnerable weak two. I hope he can find it.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good bid from Brink put Fredin under pressure -- doubleton @S bad, but difficult to pass|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: might need to revive the penalty double|pg||
nt|kit: If West wants to invite, why not a simple 3@S?  Unless for some reason he didn't think 2@S was natural|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jtr: You have to blame Fredin as he never blames himself:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: uncharted waters|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugrapha3: back almost immediately|pg||
nt|jtr: oh we have another 8!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Fredin is very self-critical. Or he would be if the need ever arose. |pg||
nt|jtr: So we will see these boards played by these pair's teammates|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it would help to play another eight boards, otherwise these matches will not be easy to score|pg||
nt|brolucius: An interesting set of boards.|pg||
nt|jtr: I am glad i gave you some ammunition at last; must have been a frustrating set of boards:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that the next session will involve exactly the same boards being played again. I hope the players have not been watching BBO.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|henryb: this could also have been 800|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: so after all that they got it played from the wrong side in the wrong suit at the wrong level|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|dburn: no matter what they say, it is still harder to collect penalties playing negative doubles than it used to be when double meant double|pg||
pc|cK|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|dburn: not that negative doubles are a bad idea - of course they're not, but sometimes...|pg||
nt|lestergold: in money bridge u see a lot more penalties for sure|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: but you also see a lot more failures of player sto get to optimum contracts|pg||

mb|1N|an|10-12|mb|d|nt|mdgraham: although as we have seen, East seems a soemwhat cautious bidder|pg||
nt|henryb: another good 3N|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|ady: 2@D  in other room   an opportunity for n/s here    3NT cold on diamond break|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|henryb: 5@d cold on @d break and @cA onside|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: another chance|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|h5|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ady: North does have a maximum for the 2@D rebid|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Spectators advocate 3@D - one vote for 3@C but I think that would be game-forcing and therefore an overbid|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: On the second chance, 2nt over 2@s|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|d9|pg||

nt|fabsayc: a ton of body punches|pg||
nt|kit: I was told that pass over the double denied a club stop, 2@H showed spades, and some disagreement on what 2@S meant|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Fallenius assumed responsability|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 2@h showed 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|fabsayc: may see the 6 level this time|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  8 could be a push will be exciting to see the replay auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South @S support = "adequate"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sounds too complicated|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = artificial game force|pg||
nt|henryb: I would play X as penalty here|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lestergold: hm i wouldnt want to let fredin an easy entry into the aucion with this hand which does not have immense defensive strength|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: with 7 card support -- spade king is actually superfluous|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the three doubletons do not make the hand look very slammish|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Mike|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and what would west have bid to show hearts?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: was wondering if West would bid 5@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would have wanted a high spade number on the table a round ealier|pg||
nt|dburn: he may regret not doing so, if he gets a heart lead against 5@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other non-preemptive action was 2N=INV+|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Drijver doubled in a similar sort of position yesterday when his trumps were a modest AKQ9|pg||
nt|dburn: but Brink for some reason took it out|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 2@D?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: your 2@H i bet has more muscle henry|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: apparently|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: anybody for double of 5@H with north hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well even fredin at this vulnerability would have thought twice about competing over an immediate 4s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: long ago Ed Manfield explained -- don't bid 5-over-5, the 5 level belongs to the opponents|pg||
nt|kit: and I guess 2@S would show no major?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|dburn: double would, I think, be "I want to bid on"|pg||
nt|henryb: not necessarily. a little more usually|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this contract does not look too healthy|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and with no 4 crd majors?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|dburn: pass invited partner to double|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: now the lead!!|pg||
nt|dburn: but you could see why Brink did not particularly want to double|pg||
nt|imp_jan: aha|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|henryb: I subscribe to the discarded theory that when you have nothing you bid nothe=ing|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: re-redouble shows diamonds :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: learning on the job :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|dburn: maintining the progression - four down, three down, two down... they have just enough boards left to make a contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: brink's perception of nothing and urs probably differ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: an ace different|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|lestergold: oh shucks spades didnt break|pg||
nt|lestergold: hah|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: right -- we should expand the bridge language so things can be more complicated|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in the 3-4 playoff, hampson won by 40 i believe, with a flurry of imps similar to here|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: one set to go (12 bds)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|henryb: at least a queen different|pg||
nt|dburn: in the meantime, though, Sweden are picking up a significant number of IMPs from these ventures|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: vulnerability doesnt seem to bother these boys|pg||
nt|dburn: and will move to within three of their opponents approaching half way in the match|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|dburn: in fact, 6 of the Dutch IMPs you can see on the scoreboard are from carry-over|pg||
pc|h7|nt|imp_jan: previous brd again a gain for holland|pg||
mc|7|nt|henryb: two or three down depending on thether he picks up the @d?|pg||
pg||
qx|o22|st||md|4SAQT6HKT2DKJT4CK9,SK932H864D986CQ75,S754HAJ753D75CAJT,SJ8HQ9DAQ32C86432|sv|e|nt|henryb: 6N is certainly a reasonable contract on these cards. |pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|ady: may have a view to take if diamonds are duckedd twice?|pg||
nt|henryb: One spec points out that partner is often maximum because the opponents have at least 9 spades and have not bid|pg||
mb|1H!|an|5+zz pts (A=3,K=2,Q=1) with no shortage|nt|mdgraham: if anything, 2NT is an underbid with those spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|an|relay|mb|p|mb|2C!|an|5-7 zz pts (A=3, K=2, Q=1)|mb|p|mb|2D!|an|relay|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|ady: 1 spade unlimited?|pg||
nt|henryb: I think I would risk forcing to game with south: 2@c-2@d-2@s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not many defenders find the double duck of @DA - and here the ten drops, so it is academic|pg||
mb|2S!|an|relay|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3H!|an|relay|nt|ady: what hapenns if there is A8XX|pg||

nt|henryb: I suspect he went 3 down|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually a heart exit squeezes fredin|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly if he went only one down his opponents lost the defence|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: no he made 8 tricks. Fredin apologised. Someone came in and I lost the play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: of course if opp misdefend -- 5-over-5 can yield great score|pg||
nt|imp_jan: apparently brink-drijver play transfers with 4 crd majors and therefore no lead directer in clubs were possible |pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: sorry david with so much on my screen i didnt see it buty no need to be sarcastic|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 6@D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 2+ BAL 11-13/17-19  or  4+ UNBAL|pg||
nt|dburn: OK - then he won an IMP for his trouble|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and brink got a diamond lead, making life easier|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: 1N=approx 5-11|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this is a really heavy 2NT rebid|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3n a better contract than 4h here in spite ofthe 8 card fit|pg||
nt|kit: somhow a 2NT rebid doesn't feel right on the South hand|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: indeed, maybe a reverse better|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|lestergold: however no dangers on this layout|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is close since south playing the hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h by South not so bad, though - West endplayed at trick zero|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes a position i love|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will they find passive @D exit after cashing @S?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: next heart king to avoid accidents|pg||
nt|kit: If you are going to rebid NT, I think he should just rebid 3NT -- needs almost nothing to have a play|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South wants lead -- is he sure he knows what to do?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|kit: I hate reversing into non-suits -- good recipe for an accident.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: oops|pg||
nt|dburn: not that a club lead would have helped declarer in any meaningful sense, of course, but a club from Qxx with a strong no trump to the right was probably Fredin's last choice|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: club eight was a bit too honest|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|fabsayc: apparently driver read something in to brink's failure to unblock the spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't understand @C -- i think it needs too much from South to be right|pg||
nt|dburn: why would he care who has @cQ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: anyway that would not have got them to slam|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wouldn't south unblock @S if he wanted North to shift?|pg||
nt|kit: if South doesn't open 1@D, how do they get to diamonds when they belong there?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: you can not signal three messages with 2 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D = a) 0-6 any  b) 8-11 4+@D no 4+M   c) 12+ 5+@D maybe 4M  d) 0-10 4@H & 4@S e) bal relay|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: Fredin couldnt find a green card in his bidding box |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not the worst slam in the world, this, but the diamonds are a bit unfriendly|pg||
nt|lestergold: has fredin lost that green card again|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 6 is ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: but he finds out in time. He will make a slam if he bids it|pg||
nt|lestergold: draw trumops pass a dim and then ruff out|pg||
nt|lestergold: zillions of tricks|pg||
nt|imp_jan: that's the dilemma kit, indeed|pg||
nt|imp_jan: showing length or points, that's the question|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: i am betting they investigate seven|pg||
nt|kit: which is solved by opening 1@D and rebidding 3NT IMO|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: in context, i think 1N was 18-20 bal|pg||
nt|henryb: good @d9, you notice mike. If E had it the slam would not make|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|kit: that shows both a long diamond suit and a good hand|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|lestergold: pips are everything in the play altho u cant identify them in the bidding|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is 4@S ace ask|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|imp_jan: no, that shows a hand with (semi) solid diamonds and side stoppers, but less points|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|henryb: this whole auction is a mystery after 3N which I assume was a non-serious slam try|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no diamond king, so they stopped, perhaps 4@S asked partner to ask for aces|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: the auction is being explained|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: by both pairs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond lead seems likely but perhaps a trump|pg||
nt|henryb: perhaps they play transfer cue bids: 3N = club cue, 4@c = diamond cue, 4@h = spade cue ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Fredin thinking|pg||
nt|imp_jan: or perhaps some spade raise|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: the only lead to put brink to the immediate test|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dburn: the only problem will be if Brink believes this to be a cunning Fredin manoeuvre to deflect him from the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: brink knows it is prob a singleton but also knows what fredin is capable of|pg||
