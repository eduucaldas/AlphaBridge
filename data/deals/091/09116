pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|h6|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|kit: this may propel them into a lucky 3NT contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|askgaard: But a double finesse is perhaps more likely (in 6@s)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: North opened a strong club, remember|pg||
nt|askgaard: Good point. South then better hide the @hK!|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|othered1: this isn't merely lucky, it's hugely lucky|pg||
nt|kit: The lead gives declarer a spade trick -- but it works best for defense anywy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Eventually declarer took the double finesse in 6@S and went one down|pg||
nt|kit: West can continue spades when in with ace of clubs -- declarer will have to play low from dummy and win the ace on 2nd round to block the suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|5C|an|1 or 4|nt|askgaard: 2@h could be based on 3 or 4 card support and that is often nice to explore|pg||
nt|chip: presumably South showed no sign of life after bidding 2H, so N should get out in 6 when D king is missing.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|kit: if he knows that diamond king is missing, that is|pg||

nt|chip: It was pointed out that if South had Kx AJxx Jxx and QJxx 7 is almost laydown.|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: as it is grand is 50%|pg||
nt|askgaard: When @h are trumps, my partnership has inverted the meanings of 5@s and 5NT, so 5@s here would be a normal 5NT bid|pg||
