pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|othered1: woinder if 3@S is weaker than pass, since west has shown 4@S with 2@S bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Jimmy Cayne says the war iks o ver for the moment|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I think the 3@S suggests he has help in clubs|pg||

pc|d4|nt|vugrapha2: Michael Seamon flasecards on most hands as declarer but has kept the @D8 here|pg||
