pc|s2|nt|santyclz: Perfect trumps for a high x-ruff, difficult with 4333 however.|pg||

nt|viren169: Yes... not the popular choice!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 11 or 12 tricks in @s depending on the lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru: 6@S?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mrt2000: a v delicate 3NT on a non @D lead, perhaps?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mrt2000: ah well, that blows that then!|pg||
nt|granguru: 1N shows @Ss?|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrt2000: N hadbetter keep quiet here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well I am playing in a Gold Cup team with an old friend this year|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes it does, and 6@S makes|pg||
mb|2H|an|spades|mb|p|nt|viren169: 1@D is nat but usually unbal'd (all bal'd hands go via 1@C)|pg||
nt|starkist: splinter|pg||

nt|starkist: anderson has good hand on this auction|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru: More chance to make 4@S if the defense permits it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: can't see this making|pg||
nt|mrt2000: trying a bit too hard|pg||
nt|granguru: S has both @S and @H entry..no way to make this contract|pg||
nt|viren169: there it is - splinter again!( Not my choice with a Q!)|pg||
nt|granguru: finally contract got from E side|pg||
nt|ralfwil: leading from a J when having kings in the other suits|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|garnetts: This may need a bit of playing--bet a trump is led|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this will go down|pg||
nt|santyclz: He can make after this lead I think.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: After winning @cK N can platy 2 rounds of @s and then shift to @d|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, yes.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mrt2000: if E had had the 10@D it would have had chances|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

nt|mrt2000: the longer S thinks, the more I like it|pg||

pc|h6|nt|granguru: @D8 showing @H stopper|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|santyclz: Oops.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now this can be fun @d and after @c to the king a @h shift, but can N see this?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he cuts all communications|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But defence is not on top|pg||
pc|h2|nt|viren169: Tough for East to know he does not want a ruff!|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes the club lead was surely a mistake with a known sington in dummy|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|viren169: another hand for a trump lead!|pg||
nt|sharkirl: needed @D switch|pg||

nt|viren169: Game swing!|pg||

nt|garnetts: often even|pg||
nt|viren169: You never told me about trump leads... all those years ago!|pg||
nt|garnetts: Obvious auction to 2@S in the OR|pg||
nt|viren169: back to a part-score hand...|pg||
nt|garnetts: Leading a trump must never be an excuse for not thinking|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lot of players use it too much|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting 1@C or 1@S opening by West?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1@S every time for me |pg||
nt|viren169: Technically 1@C but most would open it 1@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1@C is hardly ever best when it could be prepared |pg||
nt|viren169: Technically 1@C is best... |pg||
nt|garnetts: But--with say   Qxxxx  Ax  x  AKxxx  maybe 1@C is better--that is bad spades and good clubs|pg||
nt|santyclz: Had a strip-sqz endplay against n for +2 if he returned a @d and cashed @cs.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mrt2000: 7@C might make here|pg||
nt|granguru: just 3@D NS |pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|viren169: Interesting... just the hand I would bid 1@S on...|pg||
nt|santyclz: (ending,  not endplay)|pg||

nt|viren169: better...|pg||
nt|granguru: if @DA instead of small probably|pg||

nt|granguru: which all british are|pg||
nt|sharkirl: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: without any special reason|pg||
mb|4S|nt|santyclz: Y, @c duck with those beautiful @ss was very strange.|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Now 2@S over 2@C should be normal... keeping North out of the auction (Not that he wants to come in!)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And you know your P @d|pg||
nt|starkist: hmm|pg||
nt|ralfwil: leading from a 10 or J often gives declarer a good help|pg||
pc|hK|nt|viren169: Looks like West was more worried about letting N in|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit that 2@S would always get me a singleton trump|pg||
nt|viren169: 8/9 tricks available here for a flat(ish) board|pg||
nt|sharkirl: can this be true??|pg||
nt|starkist: intended as forcing i'm sure|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkirl: would have thought so|pg||
nt|sharkirl: 4c is Walshe|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mrt2000: either too much or not enough, it seems !|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not that easy pehaps |pg||
nt|starkist: or redwood|pg||
nt|mrt2000: "systemic misunderstanding" i SUSPECT|pg||
nt|eamongall: Adam Mesbur and Pat Walshe have had a miserable/unlucky  time this weekend |pg||
pc|cA|nt|viren169: void for me!|pg||
nt|eamongall: Pat Walshe was called in at short notice as a replacement for the unavailable Nick Fitzgibbon so the lack partnership understanding and match fitness in Walshes case would  tell |pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if 3@S is not forcing, it ought to be |pg||
nt|viren169: 2@S shows clubs I am told...|pg||
nt|garnetts: 7@D not the nine too I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have just been advised that 2@S shows clubs too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and take your 5 tricks in the defence as soon  as possible|pg||
nt|santyclz: Too much @d duplication.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|granguru: confusion because W passed primarily|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|garnetts: They clearly play transfers after 1NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In fact @dQ is better than @dK, You have no other choise than finessing|pg||
pc|dK|nt|eamongall: this will be draw trumps ....and test @Ds for the overtrick|pg||

nt|ralfwil: no @h ruff?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Exactly the wrong hand for an unusual nt in my opinion, but worked very well.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Maybe that's why they're playing and I'm watching.|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: Meanwhile EBU have passed the century deal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a 50% 5@c will fail on a loosing @s finess|pg||
nt|eamongall: century imps total|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sharkirl: H plays well|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but there is a good @h contract on EW|pg||
mb|1H|nt|garnetts: Very little actually|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10 P and partner has opened in vulnerable|pg||
nt|eamongall: thats another poor effort by Walsh O Gorman ...the 30 point deck never came to light |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|4H|nt|garnetts: There is an issue with the alert system--sometimes it is a real alert and sometimes you do need to know|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@H seems enough here (or the equivalent)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: was P on N correct?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: no x|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 2@D is more hearts...|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrt2000: straightforward 3NT|pg||
nt|viren169: now 2N=clubs?|pg||
nt|viren169: are they in GF now? or can it be dropped at the 3@H level?|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@c looks like a @D transfer|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 1 off here as like as not|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: The lead suggests that 2@hs may have shown 2 suits such as @hs and a minor.|pg||
nt|granguru: so the lead is clear|pg||
pc|cT|nt|granguru: around 10 tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: @Dk to maintain the lead!|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|mrt2000: 11 now, perhaps|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|viren169: It is nat and Invite now... with 6 hearts...|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure West will be pleased to see a diamond or two in dummy!|pg||
nt|granguru: and cross @cs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: I think East should bid 3@D after 2NT--but then again I am old fashioned why let partner know you have short hearts and a six card suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Once again. the whole highway open...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|viren169: still only 8 tricks available...|pg||
nt|eamongall: there is argueably 11 tricks available |pg||
nt|eamongall: @H and @S to lose|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: is it me or did a spade lead seem obvious here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a careful play is needed. He doesn´t know that @hA is singleton|pg||
