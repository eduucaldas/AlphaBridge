nt|dburn: but this auction is probably locked into spades now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Swedes still bidding the hand in the other room. The auction has taken 6 minutes so far|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: wow|pg||
nt|dburn: not surprising - this is a very tough hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: they are in 6@s in the CR|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: this will be very interesting|pg||
nt|roswolf: now if this makes on a trump coup we have a champagne hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Jóhann reads the layout to perfection he can execute a so-called Trump Coup|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At trick 11 he will end in dummy with @DA10 in his hand over North's J8|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: I think he is capable of doing that. Jóhann is a fine player|pg||

nt|bridge_one: Antoff is originate from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|athene: but when BOTH your menaces are blocked, it all works out|pg||
nt|junka: 11 imps for Peirao.... good start|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: no games here (best defense) however someone could be in one|pg||
nt|athene: so sometimes two wrongs do make a right :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Please check that result, operator.  It looked as if they took 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|glen: spec smartly notes that on last hand, if no @D by opp, draw trumps play @S ace and another and now opps forced to open up @Ds|pg||
nt|junka: looks like 4@h n/s...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bedap: 1S?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bedap: pass?|pg||
nt|mayors: EW probably heading for 3NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W play standard 5 majors|pg||
nt|leao: yes, it did look like 9 tricks for me too|pg||
nt|glen: whether N bids 4@H or not depends on the quality hand N can expect for S's red-vs-white 3@H bid|pg||
nt|junka: or 3Nt by e/w? lol|pg||
mb|1N|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||

nt|santyclz: Came just in time for an exciting hand.|pg||
nt|mariner1: u want to help?|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: but really it comes down to north's @H10 and @h9|pg||
nt|leao: 3@C should be N bid|pg||
nt|leao: lots of time to bid @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: we got all the way up there|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Markku.|pg||
nt|athene: if north just had @HJxxx then 6@H would be very bad|pg||
nt|athene: and @HJ10xx it wouldn't be great|pg||
nt|leao: if they are serious bidders, they wont bid it|pg||
nt|leao: 4@s or 5@c for NS but not 5@S|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: I hate to pass with !xx support|pg||
nt|bedap: maybe just 2S as South but same result|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Axx|pg||
nt|mayors: Nice diamond position for declarer here. He can't get them wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3n plays well with the KQ @D doubletom|pg||
nt|mariner1: everything except @S set well here|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D probably "waiting", often staymanic|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5@c now should be a q in support of @ds and/or @ss.|pg||
nt|glen: Mello doubles 5@D, but really wanted to double 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|junka: good save....|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it's certainly hard to get there|pg||
nt|athene: north knows his @SK and @DQJ are facing shortage and might not be worth much|pg||
nt|leao: 4@h cold the other way, if bid|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: and he doesn't have much in the way of keycards|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bridge_one: probably @H, and @C for A in the dummy, now @D verussu A for small and K, after A in @D for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: joe :)|pg||
nt|leao: 3@d is indeed waiting|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bedap: Tully will think about 4-1 trump breaks|pg||
nt|mariner1: off 1|pg||
nt|leao: 12 tricks if normal play. next, please|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C would make too on the fortunate club break - if you take the right view in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: you only have one entry to dummy in 6@C (@SK) so you have to decide whether to lead a small heart from hand first (which works on the layout) or go to dummy and lead the @HJ first ...|pg||
nt|athene: (which would work if east had the doubleton heart honour)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bridge_one: this is a error|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mayors: playing on the black suits works as well|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|santyclz: E takes out an expensive insurance policy.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h3|nt|bridge_one: can make 3Nt guessing to move J in @C|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|leao: ok... 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mariner1: well not attacking @D 2st will cost|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|mariner1: 1st|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|bedap: The BOURKE team has no Margaret Bourke, she's NPC|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bridge_one: this line isn't so bad - if K in @s out then K in @C problably in finesse ...|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bedap: Maybe also for Brazil|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: well, he had a chance for safety|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes operation big deal as Flint would say|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If everything looks like a rose garden, it is time to take stock and ask yourself: "What can possibly go wrong in this contract?"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only a 4-1 trump break can|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: exactly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What can I do about it if trumps are indeed 4-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: and it cannot be avoided if 4 are offside|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: so ruffing a @c is a step toward shorten his trumps to the necessary length|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: http://www.bridge.esp.br/player/leaocarvalho.php (leão again)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|bedap: Hard to find hearts now|pg||
nt|mariner1: no games here.......|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the 3rd rarest contract(after ppp and 1 @C)|pg||
nt|leao: 5@d is there for the asking|pg||
nt|athene: not many hcp but everything is working hard|pg||
nt|leao: @s and a minor, 5-5 at least|pg||
nt|santyclz:   http://www.bridge.esp.br/player/sergioaranha.php|pg||
nt|glen: 4@S does okay even if just 14 high card points|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: she's on lead|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: shouldn't be too hard to find them|pg||
nt|bedap: Good decision not to double the cold 2S|pg||
nt|mariner1: no making games though someone could be shoved up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass in North may be too much timide|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bridge_one: probably N/S play level 2 forcing|pg||
nt|mayors: I would have bid 1nt on the first round as north|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes NV vs VUL he might have risk 2@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N would be sandwich or strong for most.........|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt however not so bad - now need to guess|pg||
nt|athene: you might even make 12 tricks perhaps|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mayors: not after partner has opened|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh I am nutz...... S opened 1@H :)|pg||
nt|mayors: now double is penalties|pg||
nt|mariner1: this one should be off quick|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N lebensohl asking for 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard to diagnose the great fit|pg||
nt|athene: the key is that north has a singleton club facing a weak suit|pg||
nt|athene: south doesn't have anything like @CK,@CQ, @CJ wasted|pg||
nt|athene: you can never know this in the bidding - when partner bids a suit you tend to assume he has strength there|pg||
nt|junka: good|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Both have the death holding, 3 small in the opps suit.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|mayors: after the first round pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: now 3@H to play|pg||
nt|leao: rite u are|pg||
nt|athene: hence north just makes a limit raise|pg||
nt|leao: ...but no cigar... any way of making 11 tricks?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bedap: find the cold 4H ...|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes this would be penalties|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s Dbl isnt easy to beat|pg||
nt|athene: and clearly south has dead minimum and passes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|glen: with the @D ace onside, 5@C will roll home|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|vugrapha2: that will be hard|pg||
nt|athene: you can come to 12 tricks by pitching a heart on spade and ruffing hearts good, reversing dummy|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H @H ruff @c lead 3rd @H|pg||
nt|mayors: with 9 cards in @c NS have much less defense than they think|pg||
nt|glen: in the open room, NS never bid @Ss|pg||
pc|s3|nt|leao: Aranha will have to play for @d Ax with W|pg||

pc|d5|nt|mariner1: yes and a trump loser too|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: well this line works same|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||

nt|mmmakela: NS has nice fit in blacks but sacs expensive|pg||

nt|leao: shud x again|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1nt?  They must invert the 1@s and 1nt responses.|pg||
nt|santyclz: The so-called Kaplan Inversion.|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: we can see 6@H is a nice spot, but for both tables EW didn't have any bidding space to sort that out|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: 2N transfer to @D|pg||
nt|athene: he might cue 3@H if there's any danger of double being misunderstood|pg||

nt|athene: the defence can't hurt this contract with the clubs coming in|pg||
nt|athene: although it's not trivial for declarer actually|pg||
nt|athene: he can't unblock @CAK, draw trumps then reach dummy with a diamond|pg||

nt|santyclz: A violation of Burn's Rule of 8.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|vugrapha2: 30 imps isn't much over 16boards, so standbyfor action!|pg||

nt|mariner1: the weak NT will slow EW down...... so its up to NS to rise here|pg||
nt|leao: Ns limit is 2@s|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: the thing is, to beat a low-level contract, you need to think as though you are the one playing the hand|pg||
nt|athene: so for example to beat 1@D you need to make 1@D your way|pg||
nt|santyclz: Rule of 8:  subtract the number of aces held by the opponents from 8, and *don't* bid to that level.|pg||

nt|junka: maybe 3NT...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bridge_one: yes - strange the return @S without a bad distribution of @H|pg||
nt|athene: he will surely try a minor which finds that queen for declarer|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3D|nt|mmmakela: right|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: chooses DBL without 4@H|pg||

pc|d8|nt|vugrapha2: she perhaps felt embarassed about the quality of her 2nd "suit"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, very remote |pg||
nt|mariner1: @S 3@H and wait for the @c|pg||
nt|leao: ace of @h @h on lead... no|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bedap: still, this will be fun to play|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: acttually, the communication problems on this hand are grievous|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: needs trumps to break|pg||

nt|santyclz: S is.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bridge_one: with lead @S was more easy to make a mistake in counterplay|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S is an asking relay......... 2n shows extras|pg||
nt|mmmakela: were no alerts|pg||
nt|santyclz: Although in this case it doesn't matter.  Usually having the strong hand concealed is of some value.|pg||
nt|leao: should be 1 down|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mariner1: only chance if give up a @c and hope K and @S|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mariner1: the key was not setting up the @S pitch|pg||
pc|d3|nt|santyclz: 4@s ace asking?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugrapha2: and since they don't, nothing good can happen with the 3-3 @H|pg||
nt|bedap: when she didn't double, east may have assumed diamonds as her second|pg||
nt|bedap: 2S = 5-4 spades & minor|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I think , from the 5@D bid, that that is right|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: but then, East perhaps needed toshowvalues, to make the X easier|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|bedap: didn't need this, needed +500 vs 5Cx|pg||

nt|bridge_one: now pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: pass works too|pg||

nt|bedap: 2D = standard multi|pg||

nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set|pg||
nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sybarra: this auction will not be the same at this table|pg||
nt|mariner1: I suspect the 3N will be the same though|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets see |pg||
nt|glen: you didn't think we could get another double digit swing did you?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bedap: here's a chance for HAVAS|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bedap: that's ok|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N certainly was not the spot as in Open|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 nt in OR needed the dias guess|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N is not automatic though|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N ban make NS if they bid it|pg||
nt|mariner1: can make|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Interesting discussion in the Open room on what 2@C now shows...|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: and what does S do now,   transfer to @D |pg||
nt|mariner1: S passed as he has a tweener.........|pg||
nt|sybarra: good for Gold |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a minimum with long clubs...it's a question of HOW minimum|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mmmakela: and some more|pg||
nt|sybarra: easier just to blast into it |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: @d dont behave so nice |pg||
nt|mariner1: too weak to force and he wants N to describe his hand   they probably use DBL as|pg||
nt|mariner1: weak neg there|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like it showed a min here hence a pass by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: for sick bids, I love opening the N hand 1NT - since it can then pass partner's stayman bid (p-p-1NT-p-2@C-all pass)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well done.... careful play makes|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to play @H for 1 loser|pg||
nt|ferlema: obviamente la mano no se puede ganar|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mmmakela: S has auto duck|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if south duck the K in @h can beat 4@H|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|bedap: not right to draw trumps|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mariner1: saved and entry to dummy in @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: an entry|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @H lead helps or hurts depending on what N does|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: the played it right|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good try, I think only a @c had a real chance.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|glen: of course in reality it goes p-p-1NT-p-3NT-p-p-Double and -1100|pg||
pc|sA|nt|viren169: Yes how min?!?!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mariner1: needs to lead @S to j|pg||
nt|sybarra: so where is trick  9?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mariner1: easy from here.......|pg||
nt|athene: does it say "i have almost a psyche, wish i hadn't opened"?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|santyclz: Well he now has an entry to his @ss.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bedap: just 200 now|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the @s suit, since @hs are 4-4.|pg||
nt|sybarra: lead @S up 2x|pg||
nt|leao: yes|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c3|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bedap: drawing trumps killed Wests S8|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that much for my autoduck|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mariner1: no % in ducking a @S lead from S|pg||
nt|camacho: I think @c or @hA and @H breaks 4@h|pg||

mb|p|nt|glen: 6@C nice spot in open room|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bridge_one: ok|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S interesting opening here..........|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|bedap: who owns the 5-level?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: fastest at least(no pre-copypastes,right?)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: I'll never tell (except see that link as I already told)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if weak opening I detest it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: books say the opponents|pg||
nt|camacho: I don´t like to pass with 6 of minor when I can open with 3|pg||
nt|athene: now east might go 3@D transfer?|pg||
nt|athene: given they seem to play transfers here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: -2 looks like a lot |pg||

nt|mariner1: Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge lovers|pg||
nt|mariner1: worldwide!|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: This one is pretty reasonable, all it takes is a 3-2 @h break and no ruff on opening lead.  7nt just needs the break.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh but poor declarer never gets to dummy   |pg||
nt|santyclz: Stiff j or @hs is fine too.  |pg||
nt|santyclz: (of)|pg||
nt|glen: we will invite Roland back to explain the useful 4@C Gerber bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|bedap: this needs some work ....|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: E an entry short to make this unless defense helps|pg||

nt|mariner1: a lot!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: down with return @C|pg||
pc|d9|nt|glen: hmm, perhaps 4@C was not Gerber|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D return|pg||
nt|mmmakela: any after 2 hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: no 2 @H allows a ruff on E to hook @S twice|pg||
nt|camacho: almost same bidding|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though there is 650 available here|pg||
nt|glen: since 4@S is not two aces|pg||
nt|camacho: not enought|pg||
nt|camacho: yes|pg||
nt|camacho: 700 = 12|pg||
nt|ferlema: sim|pg||
mc|9|nt|junka: slamish w/ @cs|pg||
