nt|Walddk2: 3@H can be defeated, but it takes a very good defence|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|ady: could be some compertitive bidding here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|sharkey: both Eide & Livgård are/were Norwegian internationals on the Junior team - not sure if they still are|pg||

pc|c2|nt|sharkey: they're too old now Im being told|pg||
nt|ady: no   n/s not in bidding|pg||

pc|d4|nt|thegarve:  You know about the @c singleton in dummy too|pg||

nt|thegarve:  same contract and probably same bidding in the other room but made with an overtrick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This did not go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And corrected in MOVIE|pg||
nt|thegarve:  been corrected to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: if north protects with 3@S  would south raise to 4?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, I think North did the right thing.  Balancing with 3@S there seems ... well, aggressive|pg||
nt|bjacobs: putting it mildly|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Yes, 4@S is a tight sort of contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now, let's pretend that North does balance with 3@S. Do you really think South will pass?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  a simliar situation to passing 3m happened yesterday whilst I was commentating |pg||
nt|thegarve:  Yes cards are too soft |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are in game if North balances|pg||

mb|3C|nt|bjacobs: No, it's a very Ordinary contract!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bjacobs: if you get my drift|pg||

pc|d9|pc|h4|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The pronunciation of liver in this word is not homophonous with the first two syllables of Liverpool; rather it rhymes with "driver"|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: impressive Roland|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A Dane should know these things?|pg||
