nt|vugraphzmf: previous results are shown here http://www.bridge.ee/MV/VK09/VK09-3.htm|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Tanel|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@D and 6@H for ns too thin imo|pg||
nt|snorris: and 3 @s from west..?|pg||
nt|snorris: 1@h-1@s, 4@h...|pg||
nt|snorris: oh strong @c it is|pg||
nt|sybarra: and for those asking, the cherry blossoms a in bloom and beautiful this yeatr|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: hi Arifin and George|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.bridge.ee/MV/AB-tln.htm - Tournament site|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: a grand slam for breakfast|pg||
nt|snorris: yes!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: thought about 4@S by W|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was Cherry  Blossom festival weekend |pg||
nt|snorris: where ?|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|garnetts: 5@D is clearly the best contract--but even that may be too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting pass for S|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Everyone|pg||
nt|snorris: -3  too much|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true|pg||
nt|snorris: first double not negative?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: it was; alert was too late:)|pg||
nt|snorris: and no neg double from north?|pg||
nt|sybarra: if S can cue the @D early.....off to the races |pg||
mb|3D!|nt|garnetts: Sometimes this sort of pre-emptive tactics help declarer  in the play|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi George|pg||
nt|daman: this should end the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: we start off with an everyday grand|pg||
nt|col3435: do you think it points out the diamond situation here?|pg||
nt|garnetts: The heart position will force west to unguard the Kxx of spades because the Q@H acts as a squeeze xard|pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess NS do not use forcing NT,,, maybe polish @c or similar?|pg||
nt|daman: unless East takes a view|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|xenya: wondering if they get there -- it's certainly possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: 4@S should be cue with @C as trumps|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho there are only 2 visible losers in 5c, 11 winners may well prove dfficult if they reach it|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Avram|pg||
nt|snorris: this is too cheep|pg||
nt|snorris: only 300|pg||
nt|garnetts: unusual to make a shortgage cue in a suit you opened :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a simple 4@S to  restart with|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: re and sorry about that|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Cornelia |pg||
nt|snorris: hi Cornelia|pg||
nt|sybarra: now what does south bid?|pg||
nt|snorris: looks like cue-bidding|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @d|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H might reassure partner of no heart losers|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|garnetts: I think dec will not get the @D position right--the 3@H will ensure that---I am afraid I would have bid 4@H which would have been a better indication|pg||
nt|col3435: yes|pg||
nt|garnetts: Still we have stopped short for some reason|pg||
nt|garnetts: North can't have much faith in his partner's bidding or card play lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: dummy lost its @s 4 and now looking for it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: imo an example how easy it is bto disrupt a big 1@C by opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: to|pg||
nt|jaapfr: wlc david|pg||
nt|snorris: dont think north liked that|pg||
mb|6S|nt|garnetts: I suppose 2@S was non-forcing |pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: 5@D = 4 KC with @C trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: but it's seldom easy to bid a grand based on long, well-fitting suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: they are thee!|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge.ee/MV/abkoos09.htm - Convention Cards|pg||
nt|snorris: a chanse for 500 if east misguesses @cs|pg||
nt|snorris: not any more|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: looks off 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning to everyone|pg||
nt|snorris: well who am I to know their methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: hi mike|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S are from Latvia, E-W from Estonia|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: pity|pg||
nt|josj: you were right, Vladimir...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|josj: with @H 5-1 the @D finesse is needed in 7 but it would have been an excellent contract|pg||
nt|xenya: quick claim i suppose|pg||
nt|snorris: north liked it plenty|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|josj: no sign of it yet...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jaapfr: down 1 can now|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: the bad breaks are of course the problem here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: ruffi8ng finesses of hearts looks like a vuiable line|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jaapfr: Monte Carlo leading the pack now?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 11 tricks |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mariner1: told that NS here play a forcing @c 17+|pg||
nt|mariner1: still interesting that they have not adopted 2/1 style for their major suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: openers.... many have|pg||
pc|h2|nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes almost inevitably |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: ekeks 332; monte carlo 332, Roheline Lammas 328; druva 327,5 before this match|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ex aquo|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|snorris: small @s..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: they have played a total of 5 days so far,and its like starting all again now:)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: east of course has tipped his hand |pg||
nt|april7: now 2 ruffing finesses and 5 @C are made|pg||
nt|lestergold: kill point now|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|snorris: well done east|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|col3435: and I thought that's what he was playing for too|pg||
nt|lestergold: a cars lie 4h looks cold for e/w|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: previous results http://www.bridge.ee/MV/VK09/VK09-3.htm|pg||
nt|mariner1: so playes well to go off only 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: played|pg||
nt|ahalim: not anymore :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: they had one card missing in board 2, its fixed now|pg||
nt|snorris: knew when to put up his kings|pg||
nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
nt|snorris: and when not..|pg||
nt|garnetts: The two leading teams are equal at this point--so this is a real shoot out|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we had a very exciting and very good match earlier today here in CR|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: roheline lammas is playing against druva now|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: another near-slam but this time it will fail|pg||
nt|josj: so it should end up in a boring 3nt|pg||
nt|april7: after opening and stayman E will play 4@Hlosing 2 @C and 1 @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @h the limit|pg||
nt|garnetts: EW might be on for 5@C here but may find it hard to get into the auction|pg||
nt|snorris: 10 tricks in @cs here|pg||
nt|snorris: no game on|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this also looks slammy, but they'd better stay out of it, it seems |pg||
mb|1D!|nt|jaapfr: or 2@S:)|pg||
nt|snorris: 3@h is my bid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if pass now np for ew|pg||
nt|garnetts: If 2@S gets round to east he may balance with 3@C |pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|col3435: I don't know whether these 1@c bids are "strong" clubs or something else - anyone have any information?|pg||
nt|snorris: not double|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: seems the player listens to you:)|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H now or does not listen?|pg||
nt|snorris: not enough for 4 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: he is on the other side of the screen... so might not:)|pg||
nt|snorris: max too tricks for declerer|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think North should bid |pg||
nt|jaapfr: scared by red i suppose|pg||
nt|jaapfr: S will pass|pg||
nt|snorris: now s has to bid..|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chick: how many C's?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|xenya: too much duplication in @Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the wasted qj of clubs is compensatwed for by the nfavourable position of the spade ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: did he buy it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: opening lead most probably a @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is likley to be flat 4h a completely normal papa mama contract|pg||
nt|april7: or trump|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead can beat this|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe but I think he can do little real damage by trying 1@S or 1NT|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @c was appropriate|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: N having only 2@H and K@S 3rd means this should be beat too|pg||
nt|mariner1: if @H broke better the could jettison a @D on 3rd @H|pg||
nt|mariner1: or even if he only had kx @S|pg||
nt|snorris: now this is critical.. must switch too clubs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hope they get it down by timely @C play|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i know the Estonian thinking rite since last session:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: this is a good slam--only a heart lead makes it dodgy--but even then 50%|pg||
nt|snorris: still not won..|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: -2 but who is to double?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: and no long suits or fits this time -- they should diagnose it i think and stop short|pg||
nt|xenya: but no...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|josj: even @DJ10xx with S is not enough|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|josj: this would make on a favourable @D position + @C 3-3 or so...|pg||
nt|lestergold: why such a hurry to play spade?|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 1 in Open W is playing 2@H DBL|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DQ |pg||
nt|garnetts: 1NT might be best because he can bid 2@D over 2@C if that were to happen|pg||
pc|h4|nt|col3435: looks like 2@s was forcing, in which case surely 4@s isn't the right way to go about things|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jaapfr: unhappy defense|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: seems slam depends on Axx in the W hand and @Cs 3-3 -- no such luck|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well I want to be in six on these tickets|pg||
pc|sK|nt|josj: asking too much even for a Roland slam (which requires about 12.89 % as you may know)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: not that it will make any difference on this hand|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mariner1: now can beat it 2 A@C and one|pg||
nt|snorris: ah.. a mistake.. in this situation at least|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|garnetts: I think 4@S was an effort to suggest minimum with no outside values of any merit|pg||
pc|h7|nt|col3435: hmm, is that what East has? Doesn't look like it to me :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|snorris: -3 if @c back but no|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: 3 rounds ofm trumps aj of dims and then spade was a more normal sequence of play|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he can use the @D to pitch @c so only 1 on that line|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|ahalim: only 1 down, decl plays @d's|pg||
pc|cK|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: on 1, Monte Carlo also stopped in 6 in OR, but they gained 2 imps by bidding 6N|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D makes EW|pg||

nt|garnetts: normal but it seems a toy is coming out here|pg||

nt|garnetts: presumably invitational with diamonds |pg||
nt|jaapfr: go too 3@S or 4@S or pass?|pg||
nt|garnetts: OH a multi of sorts|pg||
nt|garnetts: East can do nothing here unless he is on medication lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: singleton of certain suits or 0-8; 10+ 4/4; 15+ any|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s 3@cs|pg||
nt|sybarra: E finding this bid "interesting"|pg||
nt|chick: jullis will be at a loss with 19 hcp and a strong spade suit|pg||
mb|2N|nt|garnetts: This is a reasonable 4@S contract--but very hard to get to|pg||
nt|mariner1: I overcall 1@S here, not DBL|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes better|pg||
nt|daman: I do not like the 1@H opener|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL and rebid my suit I have a bigger hand|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|snorris: show it as nt hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 nt a disaster if S can find club lead |pg||
nt|chick: and W has nothing to bid with|pg||
nt|snorris: not now no|pg||
nt|snorris: so 2nt -2|pg||
nt|snorris: will south double?...hardly|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 2@D looks like a good bid here to me--unusual but what else|pg||
nt|col3435: yes you probably need South not to rebid 2NT for a start|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx piret|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ahalim: you prefer 1@D ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: maybe their style is canope|pg||
nt|garnetts: might be bale to act if 3@D gets back to him--but dangerous|pg||
nt|garnetts: able even|pg||
nt|chick: S has a fit for whatever N's second suit is|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|mariner1: canape|pg||
nt|daman: I prefer 1 @D|pg||
nt|daman: as would most players|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even 2nt can be easily -1|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@D from South?|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzmf: 2NT is problably seminatural also|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT is silly--surely 3@S is much better|pg||
nt|col3435: but the alerting suggests that this is an artificial sequence|pg||
nt|daman: opening 1 @H is destructive to a partnership    takes partner completely out of the auction |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think these keyboards have a built in typo mechanism|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: now N is looking confused:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H was daft |pg||
pc|s3|nt|col3435: in which case maybe they are bound by their system|pg||
nt|april7: 10 of @C and @S from dummy|pg||
nt|april7: W is in wrong hand now|pg||
nt|lestergold: that avram would have been a better line|pg||
nt|snorris: e-w must defend well to beat it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and E i presume|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps that's their style|pg||
nt|col3435: say if this is an agreed way to show 5=3=3=2 shape|pg||
nt|garnetts: I hate any system that gets me to 3NT here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: cold for 5 or eben 6 @Ds and they are defending 3NT     wow|pg||
nt|garnetts: What is Estonian for sorry partner? |pg||
nt|jaapfr: sp?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: screens are used, so not much spoken:)|pg||

nt|jaapfr: ah indeed now make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: well hes playing it a little lazily|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

pc|d5|nt|daman: even*|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D will not make|pg||
nt|snorris: now -2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: to make on the nose|pg||
nt|april7: but no danger for the contract|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
nt|daman: r will|pg||
pc|c2|nt|daman: 5|pg||
nt|ahalim: 5@D yes, 6@D goes down|pg||
nt|mariner1: if he ruffs @H then he can't pull the K@D|pg||
nt|garnetts: East know South has a singleton spade--Might have tried Ace and a low one|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i vote for making this funny 3@H:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if not @SA now|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|vugraphzmf: EW are arguing now |pg||
nt|jaapfr: N and E look very pale now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: seems like some explanations given different on other side of the screen |pg||
nt|garnetts: If spades are continued it still fails I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: seems like west forgot system |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: TD coming to table |pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @SA indeed it was down 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am not sure South can unscramble things |pg||
nt|garnetts: a low spade and later the A@S beats it too |pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok that i disagee:)?|pg||
nt|garnetts: flat board if the result stands 4@D made in the OR|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @D away and play @D @D until trump and still home imo|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: EW saying that the lead would have been different if properly explained|pg||
nt|garnetts: They may have been correct if poor explanation was given |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|garnetts: You are right perhaps about systemic arrangements--but surely there are time when they must be put aside|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in std easy play @ST trick 1 and all is clear|pg||
nt|snorris: either some cross-ruffing or just pull @cs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: eaysy 10 tricks -- with a chance of an 11th perhaps|pg||
nt|lestergold: finita la musica|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|snorris: agree|pg||
pc|c8|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: no, just 10|pg||

nt|daman: so, if he opened properly the auction would proceed  1@D  (Dbl) Pass - 2@C - 2@H   etc etc   and then they would land on their feet|pg||
nt|daman: hard to believe they sold out |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: in estonia, 1@d usually just denies 5 card major and says nothing about @d|pg||
nt|daman: when you bid 2@H it has to show longer @Ds than @Hs|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have a play for 4@S|pg||
nt|snorris: more slams|pg||
nt|snorris: a grand one..|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H also has the same play|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @h is a fair contract|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|garnetts: I agree--but there are times when instinct and judgement maust override this|pg||
nt|mariner1: W has to find @S lead vs the unlikely 4@H|pg||
nt|ahalim: after N's 1@S 4@S will be the contract|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H here is likely --also laydown |pg||
nt|jaapfr: now a quiet 4@H made no problems and relax:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmf: Monte Carlo is the current leader ater 2 round robins, Pärnu 3 is on 8th place|pg||
nt|chick: pretty easy to find, too|pg||
mb|1H|nt|garnetts: 3NT also laydown |pg||
nt|jaapfr: down?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: laydown sorry:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: S already thinking slam |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: again, standings before this final match: |pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: a very risky bid|pg||
mb|1N|nt|garnetts: These hands are not that easy--here 3NT is the best contract looking at EW only --but again tough to get to|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and will make|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard opens a strong club and you hold this hand!|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 13 imps to Monte Carlo on 2, when they stopped in 5N in OR -- also a bit too high, but makeable as it is|pg||
nt|josj: ty Tanel|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: standings at http://www.bridge.ee/MV/VK09/VK09-3.htm|pg||
nt|josj: little justice to gain 13 imps for stopping too high :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: a good 2@S bid--that will help |pg||
nt|lestergold: bur he is worried that e/w may be stealing the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: Monte Carlo (356), Roheline Lammas (343), Druva (342,5), Eksprompt (338), Rakvere (313), Derpt (249), Otepää (222), Pärnu BK3 (201). |pg||
nt|sybarra: 7 nt works also |pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: well the lead has helped declareer giving him a second heart trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|garnetts: well done not bidding hearts|pg||
nt|april7: S will have to fight for he contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but i fear that its njot enuf help to make this contract|pg||
nt|daman: hrrrmmmmm|pg||
nt|mariner1: I don't much like 4@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: time for coffee no way this goes wrong:)|pg||
nt|snorris: not likly|pg||
nt|chick: I would think ask aces, ask kings, bid 7N (prevent a first trick ruff)|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Piret |pg||
mb|4D!|nt|vugraphzmf: no TD decision yet|pg||
nt|jaapfr: laydown=easily made in English although it contains the word down:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: but you suggested it :)|pg||
nt|daman: I would have raised @Ss    he already spoke to the @H suit when he bid 3@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: I suggested it had play, not that they should be in it :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: confusing language|pg||
nt|snorris: north could be without the q of @ds so..|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|josj: this lead solves the trump problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: west is awake!|pg||
nt|ahalim: :)|pg||
nt|snorris: maybe 7 @hs is better |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure "we" care about q @D|pg||
nt|snorris: for 13 tricks in nt yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: true|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D bid is?  rkk?|pg||
nt|chick: well, the @DQ makes the 13th trick, but only 15 pts in aces/kings, N must have a Q or two, so 7N is safer|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: he cannot lead a @D for profit so I predict this will make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: careful play makes this as EW should not score a @D|pg||
nt|snorris: no fancy bidding here|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not a good advertisement for strong club |pg||
nt|chick: I can't imagine not checking for 7|pg||
nt|sybarra: me either Cornelia |pg||
nt|snorris: awful bid this 6@h|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: I think my aunt and grandmother pop into the grand here |pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: south of course does n ot know location of ace of hearts|pg||
nt|april7: E wil not find the @C switch after in  with @D, but S has now 2 entries for the double finesse in @D|pg||
nt|daman: hrrrrmmmm|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mariner1: George types faster :)|pg||
nt|ahalim: but there is still a @D guess|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|mariner1: he should duck,,,,,, it K@H on he makes anyway|pg||
nt|daman: probably their best shot thought|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes if you need O's to make a mistake then give them the chance|pg||
nt|daman: correct|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|daman: this is a no brainer though|pg||
nt|snorris: trying to show some minimum or...|pg||

nt|vugraphzmf: and south claiming|pg||
nt|sybarra: so what was 4 @D?|pg||
mc|13|nt|sybarra: that might have been key problem |pg||

nt|mariner1: make 4@S if E has K@H if @D wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: so ducking the @D just added to his chances to make|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: 1@D the garbage bin in strong @C systems...|pg||
nt|xenya: the catch-all 1@D by N -- they are playing a strong 1@C |pg||
nt|april7: but S coud have made by playing Q of @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w has the balance but the cards lie badly forthem|pg||
nt|mariner1: open made 5 on last hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the 20-20 board|pg||
nt|snorris: or just 3 @ds|pg||
nt|snorris: or 3@hs ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: according to roland 7% chance|pg||
nt|snorris: in 5 @ds ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 20-20 hcp|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes |pg||
mb|1D!|mb|1S|nt|jaapfr: and what means than a HOT 4@H?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|snorris: a nt contract likly|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: @D the spot here|pg||
nt|ahalim: this can become exciting|pg||
nt|mariner1: it already is :)|pg||
nt|snorris: did not see that..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6,8% he told|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: if 3@c is constructive then South ought to go on here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c 2d 2s looks the likely losers in this 2h ciontract|pg||
nt|snorris: with @h lead its going DOWN|pg||
nt|snorris: many down..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so 1 out of 14 boards the hcp are divided 20-20|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: every dim pip and spade pip bad for them|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6.936 is the precise percentage for a 20-20. Let's call it 7|pg||
nt|snorris: 8 Tricks now.. is there a 9th ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now mb only 1 off or make:) or -2:)n|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i do not dare to predict here|pg||
pc|c8|nt|josj: even if S doubles 1@H NS are unlikely to find the @C fit, I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: you have to take a lot of tricks to profit DBL'ing 1@S though|pg||
nt|snorris: 7-8 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: S can double for takeout -- but he didn't -- perhaps a reasonable decision|pg||
nt|col3435: well, maybe it isn't :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D lead gooses 3N|pg||
nt|daman: I would have bid 3@C wioth the East hand   more descriptive|pg||
nt|jaapfr: all depends on will he take @D finesse and @S  finesse|pg||
pc|c7|nt|garnetts: I suspect it isn't |pg||
nt|snorris: then 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: it should be constructive|pg||
nt|lestergold: on last habnd if south guessed to play qh its still not all chopped liover to come to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|april7: I think it was ot a good X with that square hand and EW will go down, in an hand where NS could have gotten into trouble|pg||
nt|ahalim: agree|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree he is a passed hand so its not forcing|pg||
pc|h4|nt|josj: but 2@H will not go down, a coffee hand for me as well :) |pg||

nt|snorris: yes:)|pg||
nt|chick: 7 is certainly possible with careful play, so no overruffs|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: 2Nt at least invitational |pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: yes that's how I'd play it. And I do think South should go on over that - excellent chance of 9 top tricks in NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS might be able to make 4@S if they can get there|pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe they will bid 6@D it is a very good contract--cold without a heart lead and on a spade finesse otherwise|pg||
nt|jaapfr: illogical whilst a child understands @DA lead b3 must be based on wrong explanations|pg||
nt|snorris: now north..do something|pg||

nt|snorris: west needs to know about easts distribution|pg||

nt|snorris: makes the match closer though..|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok again....I will ask, is there something wrong with bidding 4 @S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: East admits: 3C was C shortness..... |pg||
pc|d8|nt|josj: with the @D coming in and the @S right...|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a good debate|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to run the 9 @H when in|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1nt 16-19 here?|pg||
nt|chick: now W's turn to say 'sorry'|pg||
nt|sybarra: good grief |pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: u also get into trouble when u miss a game|pg||
nt|snorris: some play 1@h from south shows 19+ hp|pg||
nt|snorris: so 1nt only 16-18|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: connection lost, sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we have a system mix up?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: well now 3N can be beaten|pg||

nt|xenya: so distressing to go down 3 in a cold contratct|pg||
nt|col3435: well it may be very lucky for them. If they weren't sure how many aces they had they would probably have ended up in 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: are we gonna get a replay or a result here?|pg||
nt|april7: what did wets play???|pg||
nt|lestergold: we want to know badly did he play the spade|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.bridge.ee/MV/AB-tln.htm - Tournament site|pg||
nt|snorris: 20-20|pg||
nt|jaapfr: no 1 out of 14 was told:):)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: kalma not at his best play i suppose?|pg||
nt|garnetts: test |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: i dont see him (screen):)|pg||
nt|snorris: a good 4 @h but might not win|pg||
nt|snorris: can be won on a endplay double dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|an|multi wo strong version|nt|mariner1: 1@D 11-15 precision style|pg||
nt|mariner1: something to be said for passing these 11's........ works here though|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: this looks like a hand where both sides might do best defending rather gthan declaring|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not 2 out of 7 boards:)|pg||
nt|snorris: otherwise east has to lead @d|pg||
nt|snorris: they are far from 4 @hs n-s now|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|april7: in a simple sentence: one doesn't have to dance on every wedding|pg||
nt|snorris: misfit ..hard to reach 2 @c n-s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still upset about b3|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I agree David|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: here is some connection problems so i lost first trick, sry|pg||
nt|garnetts: well placed cards for dec here|pg||
nt|col3435: ok, never mind about this one, anything can happen in these 1NT contracts so I won't try and predict it|pg||
nt|lestergold: lead doesnt hurt!|pg||
nt|lestergold: might just make with the loss of 2s 2c and a diamond now|pg||
nt|garnetts: likely to get to a bad game here |pg||
mb|2S|nt|josj: this time X would probably have led to 4@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT is OK but 4@H is poor |pg||
nt|jaapfr: last chance:pass|pg||
nt|garnetts: I mean OK  not good |pg||
nt|snorris: any live from north?|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: which is a much, much better proposition than 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: mind you problems is entries|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but unlikely he pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: no other lead wouldhave endanger the contract either|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: after the club disacrds declarr is in dummy for the last time i fear|pg||
nt|april7: should discard 2 @C and hope for Q of @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: well E must not had a gimic to show his hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: surely the contract is in danger avram|pg||
nt|snorris: going down..probably|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is not the best bid I have ever seen |pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: 4@S looks a better contract, even with 4-1 @Ss, -- 3N has no chance|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i see 6 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|snorris: life|pg||
nt|chick: sadly, no|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|garnetts: I prefer 2NT over 2@H |pg||
nt|jaapfr: set 5 was very good we can not say that about this set:(|pg||
pc|sT|nt|snorris: small @s for @c return|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: you can not even pull up system info for profile,  and as operator, you usually are just busy getting names, flag, etc in |pg||
pc|sA|nt|snorris: 2 @s will win|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s6|nt|april7: the 9 of @S was not a good idea|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S could be set....... needs to get a @D ruff in|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: would have been better for west to have ducked|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: too late now|pg||
nt|snorris: east not liking it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: X as N 2@H would be trusting the opps bidding tooo much:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: still thinking|pg||
nt|snorris: stick with ace..3 times @d ..and ace of @h..then @d|pg||
nt|snorris: that will save a trick|pg||
pc|d9|nt|snorris: ..maybe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: provided also @HA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oh you said that|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|april7: but what kind of anopening was that anyway???|pg||
nt|lestergold: not one u or i would have macde for sure avram!|pg||
nt|april7: and vul. too???|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well pressure often leads to bridge that is not great--but that is normal |pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|snorris: south might counter that with a SMALL ruff in front of dummy|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i do not agree with @CQ by N|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: east wisely played spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade and hes ioff|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant pick up the dims|pg||
nt|lestergold: west must play that pesky spade top beat it|pg||
nt|april7: S should have played @D after @H, now he will lose 2 @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: the reason is tio vlaidate the heart exits|pg||
nt|april7: W should continue @S ofcourse|pg||
nt|lestergold: however fat lady aints sung yet|pg||
nt|lestergold: west in tank|pg||
nt|lestergold: its jot necessarily obvious to west that he must play that spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: another card gives the contract|pg||
nt|april7: E should ofcourse not cover the 10 of @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: he wont im sure that would be misere|pg||
nt|april7: W has exiccards in @H after K of @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: exacly why he has to play spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: kill point we are4 waiting|pg||
nt|april7: W might want to ruff a @D if the K of @D is with E, but its really not necessary, except S has QJ|pg||
nt|ahalim: isn't there still a @D loser ?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mariner1: well since J@S won they had another shot|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mariner1: W can win a @D now though|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @D for -4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 13-17|pg||
nt|garnetts: a club discard last time would have helped |pg||
nt|jaapfr: @C now for 13-13    -2|pg||
nt|garnetts: 7@S looks like suit preference for a club --10@S for a diamond |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: i will claim in a minute, too fast|pg||
pc|d7|nt|snorris: not me either|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @CJ play and S thinking?|pg||
nt|garnetts: EW were very unlucky to lose 12 imps on the slam board |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: EW screaming at each other again|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jaapfr: now even could make|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was actually privie, but so everyone knows.  as operator, you can not pick up bbo info (for example, stars, profiles etc)  |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S woukd require a careful play in trumps -- even so, i'm not sure it would be made in practice|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: if he had played K@S on 1st @S he had it made|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||

nt|col3435: this looks more fun|pg||
nt|april7: he probably played a @S thats why S went down|pg||
nt|daman: NS  should end up in 3NT|pg||

nt|mariner1: maybe I was ahead of myself,,,,,,,,,, if he ruffed the @c out then he had no @S to|pg||
nt|mariner1: ruff a return while pitching a @D in dummy|pg||
nt|snorris: at least we agree...|pg||
nt|snorris: 11 tricks in @hs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H could not be made!|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: missed the tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|garnetts: I cannot see how 4@H made even on a club switch |pg||

nt|vugraphzmf: names in now:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|garnetts: 5@C is good--not easy again to get to|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 5@D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@H|pg||

mb|2H|nt|xenya: so far|pg||

nt|snorris: 5 @h is obligatory|pg||
nt|jaapfr: p|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @s is the limit unless north leads @c/@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: this time, 12+12 is no game...|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, another trappy hand|pg||
nt|col3435: now 5@c is looking more likely|pg||
nt|garnetts: they need to get to 3NT |pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has a shot NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@H?|pg||
nt|snorris: no pd is counting on something in south|pg||
nt|snorris: and south has 1 trick+ for pd|pg||
nt|garnetts: it surely cannot have made --they llready had two tricks so the AQ were two more and eventually a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: a low @S leaves 3nt chanceless|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am passing the S hand, this feels like a misfit |pg||
mb|2S|nt|garnetts: I suggest west makes a tentative double|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: you can hardly stop short of game here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: beaty bidding clear and simple and effective  |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: well S just might bid 2N here (NF)...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2 down was minimum\|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: probably a support double|pg||
nt|garnetts: Must have been a revoke |pg||
pc|hK|nt|jaapfr: beauty|pg||
nt|snorris: in last board n-s won 4@hs on a endplay|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: slam above 50% basically dependant on finding qs|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H is not a good bid, W is too strong, only 5 losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: hearts or spades makes no odds|pg||
nt|april7: E can't really continue|pg||
nt|lestergold: esoecially after the 3s bid!|pg||
nt|lestergold: double fit|pg||
nt|april7: but E doesn't know it|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this looks off|pg||
nt|mariner1: has 8 if the guesses @c right|pg||
nt|mariner1: could try to sneak a @S by|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if give all away down 1 imo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even ith @CK return|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: another wrong prediction of mine...|pg||
nt|garnetts: Should they bid game?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|col3435: I'd be worried about this if I was West - I don't think he's shown his nice hand and nice club support|pg||
nt|april7: E takes the chance|pg||
nt|lestergold: no east is still at it surpriingly|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT has 2 chances    slim and none    unless a colossal misdefense|pg||
nt|chick: Thank you, Piret!  That makes it feel more like people at the table :)|pg||
nt|chick: nice, and another big swing for MonteCarlo|pg||

pc|s7|nt|vugraphzmf: DQ was discarded|pg||
nt|jaapfr: noooooooooooooooooo|pg||
nt|garnetts: accident ?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|josj: well, they avoided game, well done by them, but 3@D will not go plus for them either|pg||
nt|garnetts: Most odd--hope there hasn't been any unusual betting :)  |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|lestergold: west now realises time to take pressure off his partner|pg||
nt|april7: does 3@D show a singleton? |pg||
nt|lestergold: poor auctionm but good landing|pg||
nt|april7: thats a goodbid now, because E could have passed the answer of 5@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: yesn avrasm west played 'catch up'|pg||
nt|lestergold: realised that if pard was making a slam try he had the val;ues |pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed not -- 1 off it looks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mariner1: snuck the @S the wrong way|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jaapfr: it is indeed very easy to analyze from here|pg||
nt|garnetts: must draw trumps and guess spades |pg||
nt|jaapfr: seeing 52 cards and smoking|pg||
nt|garnetts: The 10@D indicates the divison and vacant spaces indicates a likely spade split is 4-2 |pg||
nt|garnetts: Therefore Q@D and J@S |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|josj: W has given upside down count and gets the obvious ruff|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can not believe he is making this|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|garnetts: that is also my view--perhaps 3@H would do it justice|pg||
nt|lestergold: elimination wont help a jot here|pg||
nt|chick: Board 7, the 4@H with @D endplay was textbook perfect ... a good hand for the less experienced in our audience to study :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: not that he should know where it was|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|april7: S has singleton @H so perhaps 3 @S???|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|jaapfr: always down|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have had a lot of questions about the last board---the defence switched to a club and at some point East discarded the QD which gave them 10 trricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf:  i will try to get the full line of play in on that one|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all. Sorry for the late arrival, small problem   |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: not enuf justification for playinmg south for that|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|s2|nt|col3435: well, opps have bid two suits - normally then I'd bid the suit I've got (diamonds)|pg||
nt|col3435: seems easier to me to do something over 2@d|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N in Open here also|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open W led a @S so 3N made|pg||
nt|mariner1: so we will have a new leader|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Aivar Tihane|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: e-w need to play clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, 4@S makes more sense in a strong club (and presumably 5-major) system  |pg||
pc|dK|nt|col3435: this comes up quite a lot - my feeling is that the easiest way to bid these hands is to have the player with the long suit show his suit, and then let partner take control|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would have adn lost an overtrick|pg||
nt|chick: tough to play spaces for only 2 losers, so difficult with a @D lead|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|mariner1: well he did so well done this time|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this is bridge: if S does not open EW mite end in a horrible 4@H|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|snorris: might have to finesse @hs for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|snorris: if continued @ds lead|pg||
nt|snorris: best is small @d from south now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|col3435: from East's point of view, AKQxxx spades + Blackwood = easy game|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open they found 6@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: quick claim|pg||
pc|d6|nt|josj: defence cannot remove both the @H and the @D entries to dummy's @C in time|pg||
nt|xenya: all  the defence can get is 4 @Ss and 2 aces|pg||
nt|col3435: but I suppose here they have so much to spare that they're always OK|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure i would have wasted much time over a 2NT opening from East|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: E showed 2 aces and 3 kings|pg||
nt|tihas: hi all, I will try to fit in with the commentary|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am sure Mike when you were told that when partner raises a major to game there is no slam on lol--I can remember seeing all my partner's cards when I used Blackwood--he threw ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: them at me|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|daman: good stuff|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D a violation of Burn's Law|pg||
nt|daman: they found 6@D    they were lost|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|snorris: opening up for cross ruffs|pg||
pc|c4|nt|snorris: small @c to king ruff @d..|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: on the best defence of course|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahalim: lost and found :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and nothing wrong about opening 1@H as S or passing|pg||
nt|snorris: must play @c to make it interesting|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|chick: must duck entirely|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|chick: well done!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: now overtricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|april7: why not try for @H 3-3??|pg||
nt|lestergold: id have certainly led dim against 6!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: indeed it cost nothing|pg||
nt|daman: in the OR   South "gilded the lily" by bidding 6@D over 5   hung his partner for no reason|pg||
nt|snorris: now more @d|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|josj: no less than 3, I think...|pg||
nt|snorris: 9 tricks..on cross ruffs|pg||
nt|chick: S was afraid to set up the @DJ|pg||
nt|snorris: this is giving up|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jaapfr: i thought all lines do lead to making this|pg||
nt|snorris: or this way..|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: TD at table |pg||
nt|jaapfr: suppose about 2@H bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: East "almost" played a small H|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: and then corrected|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: so the small stands|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mariner1: so new leader|pg||
nt|snorris: then 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: makes no difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: and quick claim of 10|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: yes, 3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: and you were right about board 7, Jos -- 13 imps there |pg||
nt|xenya: 12|pg||
nt|sybarra: clubs clubs clubs  and over |pg||
mc|10|nt|chick: finessing the @SJ would allow another @D force, so E played this beautifully|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|mariner1: this is about 25% or so, well above Roland's 12.86%|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaapfr: GAUSS:)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: :)|pg||

nt|josj: prefer X?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|april7: what about Q of @H??|pg||
nt|mariner1: he has a two way guess in @c and needs to drop the Q@D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: curve|pg||
mb|3C|nt|garnetts: Well I hadn't been playing long--and no it was not Culbertson |pg||
nt|chick: N can afford to sit back and see|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s will end in 3nt played by north...I predict|pg||
nt|sybarra: might try 3 nt now?|pg||
nt|chick: now N knows E has hearts, he will devalue a lot of his hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: but perhaps you must have 4 @Hs for the double in their methods|pg||
nt|josj: with both @SQ and @HK wrong, 3nt would have been difficult :)|pg||
nt|col3435: seems unusual for North not to raise spades here|pg||
nt|garnetts: prefer 2@D myself here|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|mariner1: well backup, the 4th @H sets up so @c guess not needed|pg||
nt|ahalim: more Rob, no trump loser and @C guess if @H are not 3-3 |pg||
nt|mariner1: Open in 5@D here|pg||
nt|daman: East might just pass|pg||
nt|daman: he is thinking|pg||
nt|mariner1: not if 2@D is inverted|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: standings before current round: 1. Monte Carlo, 2. Druva|pg||
nt|daman: why   this shows a bad hand with @Ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: for the mathematics under us|pg||
nt|garnetts: little  choice here find two ladies |pg||
nt|chick: it really only leaves him with @SAQ and @HA as values|pg||
nt|snorris: no guts..|pg||
nt|chick: not sure I agree ... S passed his first opportunity to bid|pg||
nt|snorris: 9 easy tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|daman: he should bid 3@S over 2NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: once you have gone off in five of  major a couple of times, you get a bit leery of the five-level |pg||
nt|snorris: that was strange too|pg||
nt|chick: agree|pg||
pc|s3|nt|josj: I certainly would like to have 4 H, yes, for X|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s can win some @cs but didnt find it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: well its gonnayes i see what u mean 5 not guaranteed|pg||
nt|april7: E could be squeezed in H and @D |pg||
nt|daman: brutal|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this seems off from the top|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|daman: a penetrating glimpse into the obvious|pg||
nt|ahalim: in my country we call this a silent funeral|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: or oblivious :)|pg||
nt|tihas: it will be interesting to see what N throws on diamonds|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: but east will have problems discarding he needs to hold onto all his dims|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|garnetts: INT is constructive--but not this good with a non passed partner|pg||
nt|daman: in my country we demand 2 weeks in the electric chair|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|april7: now @S 9|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|mariner1: and then a fair trial? :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|garnetts: I bet he chucks spades |pg||
nt|garnetts: That will make it easy |pg||
nt|tihas: might not be much of a guess in the end|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahalim: that's barbaric|pg||
nt|daman: this was feeble|pg||
nt|garnetts: if he throws two hearts dec might be able to try a club|pg||
nt|tihas: doesnt have a count on hearts though|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: spades now |pg||
nt|garnetts: A bit like a Morton's Fork |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: got spades right |pg||
pc|d4|nt|garnetts: Another confusing English expression |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: i think QJx in @Hs and the 5-4-3-1 shape make up for the lack of a 4th @H|pg||
nt|col3435: I guess it's worth pointing out that when you play against artificial systems like this 1@d bid, you need to make sure you have agreed that your 2@d is still a spade raise|pg||
nt|col3435: but I'm sure they know that, and North just felt his hand was very flat|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: N cashed spades and then small club|pg||
nt|col3435: (after all, these guys play against Precision every day of the week)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: until now i personally do like the Estonian bridge:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|josj: another advantage of X is that S might have passed it|pg||
nt|josj: if p bids @H that need not necessarily be a bad spot|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or are NS another nationality?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzmf: NS are Latvians |pg||
nt|jaapfr: then i like them too:)|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s will get 1 more trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: Latvians often play tournaments in estonia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: neighbour countries|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: and then our biggest event - Tallinn Bridge Festival - at the end of May, is very international|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: estonians, latvians, fins, lithuanians, russians, swedes, norwegians, polish , belorussia, etv etc|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzmf: probably biggest event in this area|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: it was just made|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you try to improve BBO speed record in typing Piret:)?|pg||
nt|snorris: big money to be won ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: quite nice prizes; but check the info at : |pg||

nt|garnetts: true |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and to do with the extraction of taxes|pg||
nt|tihas: and 5@c will make for sure|pg||

mb|3D|nt|daman: at equal    3@H was silly by West   could have given them something for nothing|pg||
nt|garnetts: We all think that 4NT by west is takeout and not natural do we?|pg||
nt|tihas: now this situation differs from the other table|pg||

nt|snorris: not winning this one|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: on 9, the defence gave declarer no chance in 3N in OR -- 2 down|pg||
nt|xenya: and 9 more imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: no play|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: maybe 2NT was leb|pg||

nt|mdgraham: the take-out option must be logical - with a balanced hand and some strength, West can double|pg||
nt|snorris: ..not 31 @ds|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||

pc|c2|nt|josj: should be, yes|pg||

pc|c4|nt|vugraphzmf: too fast again; discarding clubs and spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway easy making|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|col3435: this needs a good guess doesn't it?|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|garnetts: Case for South doubling?  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there are some people who would act as South |pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @h is difficult with @s lead|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tihas: and sometimes these people are right, but the risk is high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: fully paid-up member of the Chicken Club |pg||
nt|tihas: and at this VUL much too high to my mind|pg||
mb|4H|nt|garnetts: when you know that a slam cannot be worse than that you should bid it in my view|pg||
nt|col3435: indeed|pg||
nt|snorris: battle of majors|pg||
nt|snorris: will end here I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: But 4@H is a horrible bid --surely a slam may be on |pg||
nt|mariner1: play should be quick|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: 6@H makes but is not so good|pg||
nt|april7: its ab forcing pass? now W will pass also|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agreed.|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: the losing @C has to go on a @D|pg||
nt|josj: so it needs more thans the @D finesse being right|pg||
nt|col3435: they must play very limited openings - but even then, I agree, East has to do more|pg||
nt|lestergold: really Avram?|pg||
nt|lestergold: what about north?|pg||
nt|april7: where should he go???|pg||
nt|snorris: but they sure are trying n-s these last boards|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|garnetts: Not much wrong with a 1@S response|pg||
nt|lestergold: used to be a tv series called no hiding place|pg||

nt|snorris: CAN be won but has to do very well south|pg||
nt|jaapfr: educated quess snorri:)\|pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: EW can make 4@H so 1@S X is not so expensive, but with alittle bad defense S can even make it|pg||

pc|sT|nt|josj: s?|pg||

pc|c5|nt|garnetts: Might double early in a match to let the opps know I am awake and agressive too|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|xenya: 50% slam if by E, basically?|pg||
nt|josj: less|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|april7: bad  or unlucky defense is already beginning|pg||

nt|vugraphzmf: East promised not to lay down on cards from next board; let's see.... Then i would also see something|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 nt my guess|pg||
nt|garnetts: Something that I have a thing about at teams --push for vulnerable games |pg||

mb|2N!|nt|lestergold: and failing that they could have at least defeated 1nt trivially|pg||

nt|garnetts: Knows about seven diamonds and the spades and hearts ==three clubs|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: routine, yes -- they might prefer to play in @Hs though -- also a good contract|pg||
nt|garnetts: precision canape at work here|pg||
nt|ahalim: this is a good grand slam needing only @d 3-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: N could have bid 2@S after 1NT by W|pg||

pc|hA|nt|xenya: a classic auction to 3N via a @H transfer|pg||
pc|h9|nt|garnetts: 2@H is surely not a good move here--overstates by a lot|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he discs a @H you can pick up all@hs, if he discs a @d........|pg||

nt|snorris: dont like the double either|pg||

nt|snorris: so 12 imps to Monte Carlo and a close match|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S as a trial would catch 3@S and then 4@H is fine--but maybe EW are fed up |pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|garnetts: This will play badly if East floats it|pg||
