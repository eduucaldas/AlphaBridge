nt|westjava: 2@D opening,4414 or 5 cards @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzmx: misunderstanding about opening bid|pg||
nt|rial: 2D, is a Kokish opeing bid, short in @D or @S|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|vugraphzkt: Checkback|pg||
nt|lestergold: no reason to bid a nt slam with a combined 30 points|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@d is fewer than 16 points and a singleton or void in @d with no 5 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmx: W assuming that 2@D = weak|pg||
nt|henryb: no|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Henry:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzkt: max 2 3 4 4 shape|pg||

pc|s6|nt|ketoprak: claim..?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oosmanb: wants @S lead?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: or a -90 imps dbl?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|farrukh: good dbl for 2 imps minimum|pg||
pc|sT|nt|oosmanb: well @S lead is the only double dummy lead on which you can not make|pg||
nt|oosmanb: according to GIB|pg||
nt|lestergold: the double is the sort of bid which normally attracts a redouble and make|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: luckily for north no one can redouble and few would make either|pg||
nt|werge: @D to the 10 = 12 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: Squeeze they call it|pg||
nt|lestergold: but with north showing spade length why should east play north for dim length too?|pg||
nt|werge: Almost...|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|granguru: N should have played @DA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|sK|nt|werge: @D to the ten is only real hope for two tricks in that suit|pg||

pc|h8|nt|oosmanb: however dbl dummy, GIB assures us, on J@S lead, you can NOT make 6NT, no squeeze nothing even finessing @c doesnt work|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: so the good hand would start with Neg. X |pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: well the really good hand forces with 2@H,,,,,, the others neg dbl,,,,,,, a GREAT|pg||

pc|s4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s5|pc|dT|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|irwinbo: yes but if south jumps to 4 clubs or 5 clubs, the hearts are gone forever|pg||
