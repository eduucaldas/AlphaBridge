nt|athene: the free 2@D rebid promises a real diamond suit, so 3NT was very reasonable with @DKx and a club stop and a quick trick outside|pg||
nt|roswolf: anti% slam|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: anti percentage for you too, Geoffrey?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well perhaps not|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Too good for Roland|pg||
nt|athene: Roland likes to find slams which are played in a partscore in the other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: or better still, passed out|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I recall how you were in a 1.5% grand slam on vugraph some years back|pg||
nt|athene: that's a real slam swing!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It rolled in|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed - i keep being reminded about it!:)|pg||
mb|3N|an|2!h's|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Geoffrey's grand slam required three finesses, a break and Qx in a suit|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure you were abashed and offered to return the imps|pg||
mb|4D|an|retransfer|mb|p|nt|athene: interesting - this is the french style i think?|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is you give up on being able to stop in 3major after 2nt opener|pg||
nt|athene: so completing the transfer shows 3-card support|pg||
nt|roswolf: i apologised and took my imps with a sheepish grin:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like 3NT denies hearts and 4@D is a retransfer|pg||
nt|cuttysark: and I bet Geoffrey was not a whit abashed|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup liz|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Seems like Guðjón isn't quite sure about 4@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe north is re-evaluating his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: no, he is thinking...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, if he bids 6@D that will work well|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: maybe not discussed hmm|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 6nt is a fair contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Discussed in the pub is soon forgotten|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps they discussed it in the pool :)|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
