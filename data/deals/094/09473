pc|d3|nt|xenya: S's pass looks a bit surprising|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2NT is a good heart raise and promises 4-card support|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT probably showing a good four-card raise. They might cue-bid with a sound three-card raise.|pg||
nt|roswolf: with a bit of science perhaps|pg||

nt|Walddk2: www.bridge.is/results  for the tournament website with running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|s8|pc|hK|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Ómar is right about the three-way tie at this point. Denmark in the 16-14 VP range. Sweden, Norway and Denmark tied for the Nordic Trophy as we speak|pg||

nt|roswolf: a fun hand to start with|pg||

nt|brolucius: Sadly, I rarely achieve such heights, but I will try my best.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: East might have bid 1NT but perfectly normal to pass instead.|pg||

nt|xenya: E doubles -- will S bid 4?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well will e/w get into the bidding|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: To double on the second round suggests length in the first-bid suit.|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: SOUTH GOES THE FULL HOG|pg||

mb|p|nt|jwit: Agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@H might be on a slightly weaker hand, aiming to shut out the opponents.|pg||

nt|xenya: thoughtful lead, too|pg||
nt|jwit: trump lead excellent.  Would have fared better if they were on a 5-4 fit, rather than 5-5|pg||
nt|brolucius: A count card (from West) was not very useful, so it might have been chosen with suit preference in mind.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: www.bridge.is/results  for the tournament website with running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|roswolf: well need to cash out the diamonds to hold to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denmark need 17 VP to win the Nordic Junior Championship (only U25 teams count). If they get 16, we have a three-way tie: Sweden, Denmark and Norway. Very exciting|pg||
nt|brolucius: Unless he thinks that the @S9 was suit preference, East will simply have to guess which minor to play. Not that it matters much.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the event of a three-way tie, my calculations tell me that Norway win, but I have been wrong before|pg||
nt|brolucius: With three diamonds in the dummy and four clubs, declarer is lightly more likely to hold a singleton club, making a switch to clubs more attractive.|pg||
nt|roswolf: are we live or is east cogitating?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Both|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Simon Bech thinking|pg||
nt|jwit: I agree, and the only real hope of beating the hand is to catch declarer with the stiff Q of clubs and Kx of diamonds, not likely, but the only real possibility|pg||
