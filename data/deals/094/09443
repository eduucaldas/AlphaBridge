pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|s4|nt|petergill: Same bidding at both tables - 3NT is easier, but hard to reach|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: seems the fashion these days  pr-empts at the 3 level on 6 card suits|pg||
nt|petergill: Play is very interesting now|pg||
nt|rnc: Poor S, with those small trumps not able to overruff dummy|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|bjacobs: The question is, will declarer go ahead and arrange to ruff TWO hearts?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|s5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, declarer went down in a funny way in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: what is happening to the 5th heart   think north will have to play a diamond to get off squeeze|pg||
nt|rnc: I don't think he needs them, since North will be on pressure in @D -@H|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: the other declarer played for 4-3 @H's ruffing once in dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He ruffed a heart with the 9, then took a trump finesse. South's @S3 was now the setting trick|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|d2|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs: The squeeze won't work if North exits with a diamond|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Right|pg||

nt|snorris: góðan daginn|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s can make|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now east should raise|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: mainly because south cannot overruff heart|pg||

pc|h2|nt|roswolf: fair point mike|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s9|pc|h9|pg||
nt|lestergold: a premature high ruff|pg||

nt|roswolf: is declarer a girl?|pg||

nt|lestergold: not if north gives pard a heart ruff|pg||
nt|snorris: north cant hold @ds and @hs|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah true|pg||
nt|snorris: rigt or plays @d|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant cost north to play 7h!|pg||
nt|roswolf: but a heart back defeats this|pg||
nt|snorris: breaks communication|pg||
nt|henryb: either red suit wins. only a @s back lets declarer make the hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: prefer double to pass with south  |pg||
nt|bjacobs: An interesting play problem, as Peter noted|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=8039  Anne-Sofie Houlberg|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: clubs being 6-1 increased the chance of @H being 5-2|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Anne thinking now...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She's a World Master?|pg||
nt|petergill: thinking perhaps about her possible lack of entries to her long @D|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: can defeat this by 2 for flat result|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: and whether to return @D4 or @D2|pg||
nt|petergill: I would return @D2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem is for South, North might have K42?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: The problem with @D4 is that partner might think you started with @DK42|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|rnc: there are lots of possibilities to go wrong in those situations|pg||
nt|petergill: so you return @D2, tricking partner into continuing @D's |pg||
pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: Well, all will be revealed before it is too late for N/S|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||

nt|petergill: whnwever parner hits your five card suit on lead vs NT, you should always consider shwoing foru cards (not 5|pg||
nt|ady: 3 tricks difference |pg||
mc|8|nt|rnc: There is also an ethical problem. If N go into the box for a long time, then covering S knows there is problem in the @D-suit|pg||
nt|petergill: the secondary aim of defence being to make things easier for partner|pg||
pg||

nt|lestergold: losing trumpo control|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk4: Simonsen-Skjetne are N-S for Norway       Sörensen-Pedersen E-W for Denmark|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: normal nt partscore available for N/S|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: might end up in 3nt if these are the normal type of aggressive juniors|pg||
nt|roswolf: north wants to join in|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|vugraphznj: think it went 2 down|pg||
nt|vugraphznj: 4S by south|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps unwisely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: East's name is actually spelt  Sørensen  but they don't have the   ø   on Icelandic keyboards|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: should make 8 tricks ht lead should lose 3hs a spade and a club|pg||
nt|chick: S might see red and try it, but he shouldn't because (1) he has no source of tricks, (2) his HCP is minimum, and (3) his partner (probably) is limited to 12 HCP.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hausigel: only 7 tricks - no time to establish a spade trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 3d can make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: altho this is a sensible spot im not sure i like the 2n bid by north holding only Kx H|pg||
nt|lestergold: should make |pg||
nt|snorris: e-w should go to 4@cs ,-1 only|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good competative auction then|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a little bit more than the trump guess is required though|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|snorris: guess @ss|pg||

pc|h8|nt|hausigel: oh forget that - must learn to count some day|pg||
nt|hausigel: sorry|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if he plays dim to ace and cashes clubd he still ok|pg||
nt|hausigel: I somehow was under the impression the defense could win 4 heart tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: but the spade was a good move |pg||
nt|lestergold: can hardly blame e/w for not going on on these flattish hands lacking aces and singletons|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: its nopt mps|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: i said earlier 3h a spade and a club|pg||
nt|hausigel: you're absolutely right, mike|pg||
pc|c7|nt|snorris: no resonable bidding alltogether|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: they have to defend and hope they can beat it|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|vugraphznj: thanks :) done ;)|pg||
nt|lestergold: north's 2d bid was bold but just about acceptable and it worked well|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|henryb: I think 2@d is clear: would you raise 1@d to 2? then you should bid 2@d|pg||
nt|snorris: not unreasonable to finesse here|pg||
nt|lestergold: no finesse e/w would not have sold out if the dims were 3/1|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup a valid inference i think|pg||
nt|snorris: west DID bid a lot|pg||
nt|roswolf: but he is thinking about it|pg||
nt|lestergold: west was at green|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: he should think but experience is that when you buy the part score at a low level play for 2/2|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Calle (RnC) is one of Sweden's most experienced tournament directors, and he clearly has a point|pg||
nt|petergill: No ethical problem = N is entitled as 3rd player at Trick 1 to think about the hand. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer played it cleverly in both hearts and clubs.  He tricked South into winning the first club|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|bjacobs: If South had got to see a discard, all would have been well for N/S|pg||
nt|petergill: unless Denmark has different rules from the rest of the world|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Surely not|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: This seems very user-friendly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Of course she is entitled to think, but as Calle points out there is in indeed an ethical aspect when she is in the tank for a long time|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: I agree completely|pg||
nt|ady: 23 pt 3NT    will slip through on a spade lead|pg||
nt|petergill: just as declarer is entitled to think about the hand before playing from dummy at Trick 1|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There was a famous incident in a Venice Cup when third hand thought for every before playing the Jack at trick 12|pg||
nt|bjacobs: trick 1|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem was: the jack was a singleton|pg||

nt|Walddk2: partner that she has a problem. That is unauthorized information for partner|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: turns out 3N looks ok here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: hmm i wouldnt fancy this myself|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4s the sane contract of course|pg||
mb|3D|nt|snorris: not with @s lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has 16 and the other major ok offshape but should doublein my view|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S cant be natural here so a nt probe probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: me eithe,  not even sure what slam I would want to be in |pg||
nt|hausigel: or 3NT...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/da9ou3  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|chick: spades if anything|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n not that great played by east |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Unfortunately only 7 teams are taking part, so there is a sit-out in every round|pg||
nt|hausigel: 4@S might go down on a bad trump break, but before going any further, I am going to count tricks really carefully :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: dims a little, vulnerble to attack|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Cornelia,  one might just make it |pg||
nt|lestergold: spades the soundest|pg||
nt|sybarra: but with @D lead its a really dicey |pg||
nt|roswolf: thx|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: even if u lose 2s you can afford to lose a red suit trick unmlikely to lose 2s and 2 red suit tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: errrrrrrrrr  probably not even making then |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I was still playing roland's slam |pg||
nt|roswolf: i think east is trying to look eager here but it is difficult to progress sensibly|pg||
nt|chick: I can't see E bidding anything except 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland's slam has possibilities especially on  an attacking heart lead  with clubs 3/3 a lot of losers can be discarded before the qs comes into its own heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe a lead inhibiting 4@D CUE!?|pg||
nt|sybarra: zia 4 @D bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I doubt it |pg||
nt|sybarra: might confuse pard|pg||
nt|roswolf: however if on bbo for the first time it might be irrestible!|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanhwhile east still in tank|pg||
nt|roswolf: irresistable|pg||
nt|sybarra: east knows he has a "good" hand (probably)  but probably slam is wrong sided,  with aq of @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n has play a junior 3n?|pg||
nt|snorris: oh sorry 2 @c tricks|pg||
nt|mwigor: missing a pass|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: yep it cam as expected|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: well if he is thinking surely he is not considering 3nt|pg||
nt|chick: there are a lot of ways a @D cue could go wrong ... for one thing, E knows his partner can't cuebid the @HA, and any other cue might get them too high with W thinking E has the @DA|pg||
nt|sybarra: being "adult"  he bid 4 @S |pg||
nt|lestergold: well another conservative auction no porbls in this conmtract|pg||

nt|roswolf: ah discipline - my memories of a junior are still fading!|pg||
nt|hausigel: I like 4@S, actually. no need to be a hero for the specs by confusing partner so early|pg||

nt|hausigel: anyone for 2@C?|pg||
nt|lestergold: now if north finds a double....|pg||
nt|snorris: might not reach it though|pg||

nt|roswolf: me|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: deep field,  that is great Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Wer are in Iceland, dear, so they are both away teams :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: hearts do well for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I know so "away" field advantage,  just didnt have same ring |pg||
nt|mwigor: a method which is growing in popularity in sydney is to play 2@d as a 3-7 weak 2 in a Major and 2M as 8-11|pg||
nt|roswolf: and gets the fate it deserves|pg||
nt|snorris: also popular here|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|lestergold: north is very strong for a weak 2h|pg||
nt|mwigor: one of the dangers of playing your weak two as too wide a range is the pressure placed on partner|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|mwigor: but juniors often lack that kind of discipline (among others)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: unfortunate lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: well lead helps and ruinning it wasa good shot|pg||
nt|sybarra: "home" field for you,  aka Denmark |pg||
nt|lestergold: still not an easy contract- their only fitting suit will not produce any tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: now where to go for honey?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: 3cl 2s and a heart = 6 not sure where 7 th coming from|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h is not throw against wall but one would want to be in it and here it makes due to position of club honours|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: in my experience never be maximum for a multi in @H - pecisely because of this possibility|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wilkinsona: one of the advantages is the pressure on the oppo|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: mind you that peskly 9h is a very good card |pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: contrcat made now|pg||
nt|lestergold: north's hand in offence is better than  many 12/13 counts |pg||
nt|roswolf: but only if it is likely that opps have the balance of the hcp|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ð (special d), Þ (th) and þ (th in the middle of a word) are special Icelandic characters. You see that special D in Guðjón|pg||
nt|lestergold: wellif they agree to play that range /quality at the upper end then south had a clearcut bid|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: declarer can be cut off from |pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: maybe even -2|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 4: If partner opens a weak two 6-10 HCP and thus 8-13 total points (2 doubletons at worst) - if you add on shortage points once you have a fit, then 13 HCP from responder with a ...|pg||
nt|petergill: fit must be worth a game try. |pg||
nt|ady: I suppose could make 4 spade tricks to give a cchance|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: Lots of chances|pg||
nt|bjacobs: However, assuming a low spade switch at trick 2, it's pretty difficult for declarer to run it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The queen in their methods asks for unblock or count (upside-down)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So if South has the ace or jack, he is supposed to play it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If not, he will count|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play UDCA, so South will play @H8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: and declarer could go wrong with clubs  playing low towards the jack|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: Ref http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Systems/U26/Denmark/Houlberg-Nielsen.pdf|pg||

nt|petergill: Anne-Sofie and Lars won the World Championship in Beijing last year. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play the highest spot card you can afford|pg||
nt|petergill: West should play @H5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I have an UDCA friend who says you should play the second highest from 5 or 3|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: His theory is that partner then knows you have precisely one card higher|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|petergill: West should give the same signals as NS play, in order to maximise the chance of misdefence. |pg||
nt|ady: play for J10 stiff|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: We could all make many tricks with all cards exposed; it is much more difficult at the table|pg||
pc|h9|nt|petergill: Now @H2 ... non standard ... interesting|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Withholding the 8 at trick 1 and then playing it at that trick might have been handy as well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 2 is not non-standard. If he had played the 8 he would have shown  8 6   since they give upside-down count|pg||
nt|petergill: @H2 to show that @H6 was disccouraging, perhaps? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But Roland, doesn't the actual suit situation play a part?  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 6 to show an odd number when followed by the 2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ah you guys are too wrapped up with the rules and regulations :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's why the 8 at trick 1 is so much better|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The fact is that North is now pseudo-endplayed - they cannot continue hearts.|pg||
nt|petergill: I think she will play @S6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She can safely exit a low spade. No-one would insert the 8 unless they peek|pg||
nt|petergill: but setting up the long @H with @CQ as an entry is probably more attractive|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Specs tell me that declarer can insert the 8. True, but this is bridge, guys. No-one on earth would do that unless they had the hand records|pg||

nt|sybarra: is 6@S all that easy?|pg||
nt|chick: how junior are these juniors?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|lestergold: a lot of norths would punt 6|pg||
nt|hausigel: North should make an effort somewhere, I think - but lucky, as the cards lie (would you guess the clubs?)|pg||
nt|chick: no need to guess clubs?  pitch on the long diamond?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no its not easy but it makes on the normal line of double dim finesse and estanlishing 4th dim for a club fdiscard|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I could guess the @C on the bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: of course ........... not!:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west should set up the bath coup |pg||

mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: yes, unless you have own 5-carder|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They can't pass in their methods. That would force a redouble|pg||

pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: This is not for minors and people with weak hearts (and Danes)|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ady: 4 hearts was made OR  so this needs to be down 3 for e/w to profit|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|h7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cuttysark: I would have expected S to bid 2@C here in case that was partnr's suit - seems a shame to miss 5-3 clubs if they exist|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I don't like a method that prevents you from playing in 1NTX. That is often the lesser of evils|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's absolutely true.  If you have a 4-3-3-3 shape as responder, you just want to sit it out in 1NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I play that if North passes he has decided there is nowhere better - 4-3-3-3 or this sort of 5-3-3-2. South only bids if he has a 5-card suit iof his own|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Then they are in the same trouble as here, Liz|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cuttysark: Well, again, South does not absolutely need to show this particular suit!|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe she can escape for 500. That would be a triumph under the circumstances|pg||
nt|ady: does not look like it will be down 3  |pg||
nt|petergill: At Trick 3, @S8 is a slightly better card than @S4 by declarer - @S8 gives the defenders less info about their spade pips.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't it dangerous to play a 12-14 NT vulnerable I am asked. Sure it is, or rather can be, but it is also dangerous to get out of bed  ... or stay there for that matter|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If you don't take risks at bridge you will never win|pg||

nt|petergill: North didn't open 3@D - is that a clue that N is 4171? Probably not|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Don't think South should ask for a spade - she knows partner has length there and may have a trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: These two teams (albeit with different players) finished 1st and 2nd at the Nordic Championships two years ago. One can understand why|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: ah shirley for a junior no choice!|pg||
nt|hausigel: I vote for pass (instead of 1@C). i find it quit dangerous to open balanced hand weaker than a weak NT (12-14)|pg||
nt|sybarra: while not a jr.  I may even open that hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: simple preference by south surely!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|chick: I vote for pass.  Only 25 zar points, need 26 to open|pg||
nt|mwigor: 2@d was presumably an undisciplined multi|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @ds wins|pg||
nt|roswolf: no --- discipline is in vogue with the squad system used by a lot of countries |pg||

nt|chick: upside?  keeping the opps from an unmakeable game? :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: at thuis vulnerability its reasonable providing partnership agreement allows for it|pg||
nt|hausigel: IMO it was not the rag opening, as you put it, which pushed NS overboard|pg||
nt|lestergold: they shouldnt be in game with these values anything liek it|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably the optimism of N in the other room |pg||

nt|snorris: and so is the sacrifice in 5 @ds|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: on 9 4 hearts went off on a clu ruff so lead to Denmark|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is an 'insurance ' situation - both sides should be prepared to buy the contract at the 5 level if necessary|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 500 on best defence, not much of a save|pg||
nt|vugraphznj: there was a double :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s is a good save if a ht is permitted to be ruffed in dummy otherwise its only a moderately good save|pg||

nt|lestergold: 4s is llowabe it wont make a difference it will go to 5s doubled or not as the c ase may be|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: You can restrict declarer to seven spades and one heart trick on a trump lead|pg||

nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: a swing from nowhere|pg||
nt|lestergold: south should pass the buck back with 3s|pg||
nt|chick: I don't understand why S didn't bid hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: still if west bids will n/s find hearts - dont think so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't blame Grímur. Partner should not have four hearts when he does not bid them|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree with that roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Make bridge easy for your partner. Bid the hearts when you have them|pg||
nt|sybarra: so E is trying to figure out what is going on |pg||
nt|chick: unless 2@S is a flat invitational raise to 3@H, as a kib suggests|pg||
nt|chick: and S forgot :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: then why bid 3@C?|pg||
nt|snorris: so 3imps to the Danes|pg||
