nt|lestergold: well west /east didtn opurplay opps that time!!|pg||
nt|thegarve:  yes seen 0 or 13 plays many times at trick 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think these hands have been invented for u and martin to make fools of ourselvessomehoe or other they are not the real hands|pg||
nt|kaapo: Joten Virolle vähän lisää kaulaa|pg||
nt|kippari: joo,-2 imppiä|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ppilot: 7 @H and 7nt here but they may find @S fit|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C will avoid the spade fit...|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a plot by the bulgarian secret police |pg||
nt|thegarve:  as a youth 3NT always seemed to make on no values|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tweety1: 1 nt?  :)|pg||
nt|ppilot: not sure |pg||
nt|jbgood: partscore (battle not likely)|pg||
nt|jbgood: wrong again:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: battle between W and N |pg||
nt|lestergold: oh...|pg||
nt|daman: Frankie Avalon|pg||
nt|daman: the match is much closer now|pg||
mb|4S|nt|daman: I can't wait to be your age to find out martin|pg||
nt|thegarve:  must have opened 1@c?|pg||
nt|lestergold: uve a long way to go George|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is a reasonable spot for NS but hard to bid |pg||
nt|kaapo: Mites tässä 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @C, pick another suit pard?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south's hand is not everyone's idea of an overcall with  two qxx holdings|pg||
nt|lestergold: will this psyche profit e/w?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: adio grand|pg||
nt|thegarve:  like Cliff Richard the eternal teenager|pg||
nt|kippari: saas nähdä meneekö 4S himaan?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: think I've never witnessed 20 boards without scoring a single imp other team(this is not a curse,hoping the opposite)|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I do not know the system|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is a poor bid--why not 3@C which makes 4@H unmakeable on that lead |pg||
nt|fifee: 4@H may be hard to make with east holding 4 pieces|pg||
nt|fifee: tapping declarer from the beginning with a @C lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: exactly which is why 3@C was a better choice |pg||
pc|dA|nt|viren169: Now they will end up in the wrong suit...|pg||
nt|ppilot: ilko feels robbed:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I like his bid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: south is very lucky here|pg||
nt|jbgood: hasnt been so far in the match - and 3 @c is beyond me:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: on a bad day this would be doubled and booked for something like a couple off against nothing|pg||
nt|lestergold: u Martin about 50 odd going on about 15?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  i'm at least 10 years younget than mike|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: me im only 18 so ur 8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tweety1: NS will be in 4 @s|pg||
nt|tweety1: that is really hard to make|pg||
nt|viren169: they should find Q@S is missing and only a 4-4 fit ending in 6@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3c is a horrfiic bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: well they have arrived |pg||
nt|ppilot: good bids unhappy but let us see the lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: a@S here makes 4@H easy |pg||
nt|ppilot: that is why 3 clubs values +fit is better|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes I agree|pg||
nt|garnetts: but maybe it still gets beaten if a club swicth happens|pg||
nt|garnetts: switch even|pg||
nt|garnetts: any red suit lead and it makes |pg||
nt|ppilot: makable after spade and club|pg||
nt|fifee: :)|pg||
nt|ppilot: will discard dymmyes clubs on spade|pg||
nt|ppilot: but wall on open cards for us all is easy here:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I bet East is cursing now--for not bidding clubs|pg||
pc|c8|nt|baldfriede: Yes, very hard|pg||
nt|ppilot: wonder if they get to right level:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: with a typical NT hand S sh be happy to pass - unless 2 NT meant something else..|pg||
nt|thegarve:  your as young as the woman you feel, as they say|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|fifee: I still think that a @C lead sets it|pg||
nt|kaapo: Puolustus voisi saada 2 @C ja punaiset ässät|pg||
nt|kippari: jos ristiä ei aukaista niin 10 tikkiä|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|viren169: tough to reach 7 when the spade fit is found...|pg||
nt|maribelxx: pitäis lähteä sillä|pg||
nt|kippari: 10|pg||
pc|hA|nt|baldfriede: I see no way to make it.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Rob Brown|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi All|pg||
nt|garnetts: Still if what you said is right earlier he will find a way to blame his partner|pg||
nt|ppilot: makes now|pg||
nt|ppilot: but let us see the line he will chose|pg||
nt|fifee: @C now can tap declarer and in with the @D and tap again|pg||
nt|garnetts: west is still not happy about the next lead--a club is far from obvious|pg||
nt|ppilot: 2 rounds of clubs ruf 2 spades discarding clubs from dummy and ace and diamond|pg||
nt|garnetts: He expects his partner to hold four trumps for his bid--maybe five|pg||
nt|fifee: yes the @SAce killed defense|pg||
nt|kippari: 11|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: ha to lkose three dims or two dims and a ruff to go offin 2s?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  needs to plan how to make 3@d tricks in defence, locking declarer in hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: on that basis martin i can assure u that im a lot younger than u but dont tell my wife|pg||
nt|maribelxx: ellei tule kuppia...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|thegarve:  nice one mike your wife doesn't know but thousands on BBO|pg||
nt|lestergold: my wife doesnt kniow any bbo members except me and david and in any case i would  claim i was lying to show off|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Mike was a teacher in his youth|pg||
nt|lestergold: and in my early middle age too|pg||
nt|thegarve:  taught Tom Townsend|pg||
nt|lestergold: i was a headmaster! hah|pg||
pc|cK|nt|olson: overtrick n ow|pg||
pc|cA|nt|baldfriede: There seems to be a loser in each suit.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H might have been a better spot, how to avoid 4@S is not easy to see|pg||
pc|c6|nt|viren169: Safe spot!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: 7NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Usually 4-4 fits will generate an extra trick... but not here! |pg||
nt|lestergold: bit of a hurry with his dim ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt teach him much as you can see didnt teach him how to beat u in a camrose|pg||
nt|ppilot: still declare needs to find the winning line|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: just keep pouring beer down ur throat at every opportuinity |pg||
nt|maribelxx: mutta ei kait sitä ehdi|pg||
pc|hK|nt|thegarve:  but it was watered down|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jbgood: spade and another heart now|pg||
nt|garnetts: Now he does --but not too hard I think|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mmmakela: easy 11|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mariner1: of course 4@H only has chance due to 3 3 @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: very friendly defence aces played on air all over the place|pg||
nt|jbgood: and a second trump trick coming..|pg||
nt|garnetts: In fact it is obvious |pg||
pc|s4|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|baldfriede: No good discard for declarer.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|viren169: At a high level... it is better to play in good suits...|pg||
nt|lestergold: while i taught townsend bridge david was there at age three playing snap- thats true|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jbgood: hmm - |pg||
pc|d7|nt|garnetts: he should know he needs 2-2 @Ds |pg||
pc|sA|pc|hT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: but at least b y the time he was 4 he knew what a deck of cards looked like which is more than most of my members do|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jbgood: double hm|pg||
nt|ppilot: wd andonov!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|thegarve:  you teach the blind school?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no the deaf and dumb school|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|thegarve:  weirdly must duck this and get a @D return|pg||
mc|11|nt|garnetts: East is punsihed for a thoughtless bid--and it will hurt |pg||
nt|garnetts: punished |pg||

nt|mariner1: 4@H good spot for EW...........|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 - 0 @S split makes a VUL save in 4@S a loser|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge.bg/en_UK/tournament60.html          Tournament Site in English|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Is there a short break?|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe not so short :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: a little break, sry all|pg||
nt|viren169: Back to a part-score hand...|pg||
nt|jbgood: nobody wanted to take their tricks |pg||
nt|lestergold: very accuratedefence lots of opportunitiies there  to have gone wrong |pg||
nt|thegarve:  what is most impressive is to have a baord as bad as board 12 and to play the next two spot on|pg||
nt|lestergold: shows good temperament for the game|pg||
nt|daman: looks like 4@H by EW|pg||
nt|thegarve:  its easy to be a front runner or a member of a very strong team that rarely loses|pg||
nt|olson: if  ew  play  udca ,  the  club play could have been right,  if std  then cash spade K  is best  |pg||
mb|p|nt|maribelxx: pienestä se on kiinni|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|garnetts: No 2@S then?  :) |pg||
nt|kippari: toisessa pöydässä vaikeammat jaot,siellä pelattu vasta 6 jakoa|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jbgood: N choice of bidding the clubs rather than double might get them to 6?|pg||
nt|lestergold: east's 2h i assume non forcing!! not my idea of bridge|pg||
nt|jbgood: S might have bid 4@h on the way..|pg||
nt|ppilot: bad vuln :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: 5c a bit of an underbid with a stiff heart and a massive trick source|pg||
nt|thegarve:  bid 4@C - the suit below the one that you have - hear a 4@H response and ...play there|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n 3h artificial presumingly 2n asking 3h good suit poor hand or whatever they agree?|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Interesting 2@S call by N|pg||
nt|fifee: agree :)|pg||
nt|maribelxx: niinpä, vaikuttaa siltä, että näemme suurimman osan myös englanniksi :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Even opposite p[assed hand... I think 1@S is better|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: I was slightly joking--but I prefer it to having too much defence |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ??|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Tony Reus|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hello |pg||
nt|sybarra: Tony|pg||
nt|starkist: :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well that lead could be costly if E plays for the holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: Shato on scoreboard!|pg||
nt|ppilot: this vulnerability i find it ok|pg||
nt|viren169: Assuming 2@S is weak... it will be difficult for pd to judge later in the auction on other hands.|pg||
nt|lestergold: east presumably said thx for the info i want to play 4h|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s a little more awkward|pg||
nt|ppilot: needs just right guess of trumps|pg||
nt|garnetts: A number of players play a more constructive weak two via a multi|pg||
nt|fifee: since @D break, should make with wrong guess|pg||
nt|garnetts: This time there is not much to tell West how to play hearts|pg||
nt|garnetts: The best reason not open as South |pg||
nt|ppilot: cant make if misguess trump without defensive slip|pg||
nt|garnetts: will be tempted to lead a trump maybe?|pg||
nt|kippari: JJ sanoi että 8 sekä jaot 15,16|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so martin and george they are giving us loads of work to do|pg||
nt|ppilot: lool|pg||
nt|kippari: eikös tää mee nyt kotiin?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|ppilot: and partner seems to understand |pg||
nt|olson: d1  possible  with the  % play in spades  of  low to K |pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: am i seeing things|pg||
nt|garnetts: but will dec get it right|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that is hard|pg||
nt|ppilot: we may just wait to see|pg||
nt|garnetts: No point in doing a thing but taking a guess now |pg||
nt|garnetts: Nothing will help|pg||
nt|garnetts: walk in defender's shoes is a heart from Jxx dangerous ?  |pg||
nt|garnetts: what about xx?  |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|starkist: slam goes down on a finesse|pg||
nt|thegarve:  uderleading an ace through the strong hand is quite common and worked very well here|pg||
nt|lestergold: is this real or surresl?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  hasn't cost|pg||
nt|garnetts: either way it is a sniffy lead |pg||
pc|sK|nt|olson: they are leaving the  H ace  as  entry  to  take the spade finesse  back to the  Q109|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|sybarra: might be over reaching here|pg||
nt|starkist: hope for @d lead? ;)|pg||
nt|starkist: @clubs foul anyway|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 6 @C not 6 @H here if it wasn't that club break|pg||
nt|mmmakela: possible I meant|pg||
nt|starkist: @d finesse off so no|pg||
nt|starkist: ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: it has cost declarer|pg||
nt|ppilot: i would rather be dummy than declare here|pg||
nt|garnetts: me too|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mmmakela: if clubs 3-2 and hearts 3-3 don't need dias hook in 6 clubs|pg||
nt|baldfriede: It certainly made things easier in @h.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: now kill that dummy dead|pg||
nt|thegarve:  hasn't cost tye defence |pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: some days,....just not your day |pg||
nt|starkist: no double|pg||
nt|lestergold: do u think he shouldc have pl;ayed ten of clubs?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  dummy is going to be cut off|pg||
nt|thegarve:  10@c was a desperate play in a desperate contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: dummy is dead and one day in the future n/s are going to enjoy lots of pretty little diamonds|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|viren169: 6N+1 on the last in the other room...|pg||

pc|dA|pc|c3|pc|d9|nt|mmmakela: 6 hearts needs always the diAS finesse|pg||
nt|starkist: to what on this bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H's or for all he knows nt |pg||
nt|starkist: scardie cat :)|pg||

nt|tweety1: just extending the pain:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: inching their way back |pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: N said that game is -1 and ... ok for all|pg||
nt|garnetts: poor defence is all one can say|pg||
nt|ppilot: may be he read his partners 2 of clubs like club holding?|pg||
nt|ppilot: 2 of spade sry|pg||
nt|garnetts: look at the biddiing partner can have nothing|pg||
nt|ppilot: smal club was better anyway still needs guess:)|pg||
nt|ppilot: now i take my words back love to be declare wit such shift:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I sometimes think defenders panic--rely too much on partner's signal and not enough on the logic of the game|pg||
nt|garnetts: Here it was obvious that dec could not discard much on what ever spades he held--so lead another trump--let nature take its course|pg||
nt|garnetts: But West did do well to lead a spade as it created a diversion|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: surely west was badly at fault had no rweason to bid 4s|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: partner wass in control of the auction|pg||

nt|viren169: 2N? without a spade stop?|pg||
nt|ppilot: happyly non vulnerable and not doubled:)|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@H?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a bad shot at this vulnerbaiity|pg||
nt|lestergold: only one off against cold 5C|pg||
nt|olson: hand is in the middle range for  11 - 15  |pg||
mb|d|nt|tweety1: what wld N's 1nt over 1 'd mean by any chance?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not if they finmd spade ruff|pg||
nt|jbgood: will perhaps find it against 6?|pg||
nt|lestergold: too much space taken west with no aces or singletons is not bidding any sixes|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps pass (forcing) is debatable when you know prd doesnt have a positive hand?|pg||
nt|olson: now  easy  3n by W  and should make 4   or   5 on spade leads|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: wow!!!!!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: pass... not an option opposite an opening!|pg||
nt|ppilot: i am amazed too good parnership understanding|pg||
nt|ppilot: nte good news is 4 spades cant be made too:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: East getting his own back from earlier |pg||
nt|kaapo: Moni väri on kiltisti tässä jaossa|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: fairly agressive |pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe they have a systemic meaning for a direct 1N over the 1@D (possibly short or|pg||
nt|mariner1: artificial not sure)|pg||
nt|jbgood: amazing - they dont play presicion they way I used to do - pass not forcing?|pg||
nt|lestergold: would they have beaten 5c? a heart lead and a spade switch?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  slam has play|pg||
nt|lestergold: if u are tone deasf then how do u know i cant sing|pg||
nt|garnetts: club is best for sure |pg||
nt|kippari: täällä sanotaan että otettu valtit pois mutta onhan saatavissa 2 herttatikkiä|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: but likely to make now?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mmmakela: 18-20 N|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tweety1: so dbl  is instead of 1 nt then?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Maybe Raptor.|pg||
nt|mariner1: the DBL here probably shows @D lenght|pg||
nt|jbgood: E would be declarer - di is good enough - in on heart ace and a spade ruff|pg||
nt|daman: same auction in the other room|pg||
nt|garnetts: clearly a singleton |pg||
nt|garnetts: unless playing low from xx|pg||
nt|ppilot: that is true they play small from xx|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have never though it was a good idea and now I know it isn't |pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe they should lead singletons with their left hand--that would do it|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|starkist: 27 hcp|pg||
nt|thegarve:  I said that you sing like Sinatra|pg||
nt|lestergold: he couldnt sing|pg||
nt|thegarve:  Sinatra is my cat|pg||
nt|lestergold: not compared to Jose Carerras at any rate|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: hi all |pg||
pc|h3|nt|tweety1: then 3 @s seeems an overbid|pg||
nt|viren169: It is a big call... |pg||
nt|viren169: They must have been having lessons from the Hackett boys!|pg||
nt|ppilot: this is also style playing light openings|pg||
nt|viren169: North will be very happy with the developments!|pg||
nt|olson: good swicth  to save an imp  |pg||
nt|olson: hi|pg||
pc|h9|nt|garnetts: Mind I think it would need to be alerted |pg||
nt|ppilot: 3 hands diif:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: that is the end of the defence |pg||
nt|ppilot: and if 4 spades are deffended well not big win|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|viren169: tough to choose between the lines...|pg||
nt|viren169: best not to touch the trumps just yet|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: of course im asleep|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needs the 9th somewhere|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s very easy espcially on that lead prob make 6|pg||
pc|h4|nt|baldfriede: Really @h discard?|pg||
nt|mariner1: only the @D break beats 4@S here|pg||
nt|olson: s  played  W  to hold a spade stopper and knew  6c  and  2d|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed it gives declarer a small problem|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mariner1: well S did come in freely and N does have good hand|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: well maybe 5 6 maybe too much work|pg||
nt|daman: maybe Mike sings like one of these guys     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMVxzEueJ6A|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: me singing is not a thing of beauty - even my bridge is better than m ysinging|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c3|nt|mariner1: of course it also beats 3@S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: maybe lightner  double for a spade lead!li|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|lestergold:  cash club ace cross ruff|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|tweety1: @d lead made things hard.|pg||
nt|ppilot: easy overtick now|pg||
nt|viren169: still work to be done yet...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|viren169: Declarer will not know the @Hs are 3-3|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: now best to play for a cross ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer better make sure he doesnt run hinmself short lof tricks|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kaapo: Koistisen pöytä pelaa yleensä nopeasti|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he can stil dras and establish dimond|pg||
nt|kaapo: Niin nytkin ja olemme jo viimeisessä jaossa|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mmmakela: not any more|pg||
pc|sA|nt|viren169: now 8 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzkv: smoking break |pg||
nt|viren169: N/S did extremely well to stay at the 2-level... Well done!|pg||
nt|ppilot: sry didnt count trick :)|pg||
nt|viren169: interesting if the heart had lost to the T... |pg||
nt|viren169: 2@H in other room for flat board after North passed!|pg||
nt|viren169: It was East's turn for a light opner... (3rd in hand)|pg||
nt|viren169: Boian, Would you have opened with either of the North or East's hands?|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - I really thought E had passed - and it went all pass over 5@d - one more sleeper:)|pg||

nt|viren169: brb coffee time here|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont worry about it its early in the day for bridge players|pg||
nt|lestergold: ive just finished breakfast|pg||
nt|jbgood: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffe break hand? easy 3n for e/w?|pg||
nt|daman: 4 boards to go and a very tight match|pg||
nt|daman: crazy result on this hand in the other room|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT  -5|pg||
nt|garnetts: If I were East I would like to find a hole to crawl into--but then again it is better to make mistakes when it is of little importance|pg||
mb|p|nt|olson: w could have  been   3226 with Kx of H and south now  sets the hand     |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is a trappy hand|pg||
nt|olson: he knows a spade back makes  3n  |pg||
nt|garnetts: case for 3NT here as South|pg||
nt|garnetts: Or even 1NT|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jbgood: y |pg||
nt|lestergold: well a disaster for e/w in closed on a spade lead against 3n hard to play the ten and block the suit|pg||
nt|daman: spade wasn't led|pg||
nt|ppilot: 1 seems possible:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|baldfriede: In the good old days this would have been passed out.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  many woukd do the same bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: no trumps played by east will produce a big swing|pg||
nt|olson: 110 for  ew  |pg||
nt|roswolf: this hand may blow up in someone's face|pg||
nt|olson: n  could play  3c  when south  reopens  over  2s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: so waht happened George |pg||
nt|thegarve:  but declarer played j@d at trick 2 - thus going off|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5h 3 dims and a club adds to nine|pg||
nt|ppilot: this will get them at 4 spades may be?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: guess another spade before hearts would've worked|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL by N is aggressive|pg||
nt|mariner1: possibly meaning long @c here?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Must mean that; else I see no justification for x.|pg||
nt|garnetts: slow pass makes it hard for East|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i see odd play in open room|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeeed|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe there could be a ruling asked for here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would reopen but not if partner thought first |pg||
nt|ppilot: may be they are doing it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: Danailov is thinking|pg||
nt|garnetts: any possibility of a slow pass being queried?|pg||
nt|ppilot: if he bids only 3 his partner will kill him:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: why on earth would anyone do that|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|sybarra: can anyone X?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: D Q 6 blacks, DA-D|pg||
nt|thegarve:  pressure|pg||
nt|olson: depends  if  N  has  2n  availa ble as a scramble  bid  after  second  double|pg||
nt|olson: always  lucky when  N guesses the 4 card suit to bid  that south has  4 of :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well n/s may survive this contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would too :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tweety1: this will hurt EW a bit|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the DBL certainly seems to be working here|pg||
nt|ppilot: unfortunately hard to find diamond lead to make this game hard here|pg||
nt|viren169: b|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that 1NT by South would have bought the contract |pg||
pc|hT|nt|daman: compression pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they m ay simply cash the first 7 tricks here|pg||
nt|daman: Played the @D J to protect his @S holding and it blew up in his face|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mmmakela: made now|pg||
nt|sybarra: if defending like that better not X |pg||
nt|vugraphzkv: a little break|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if something can go wrong for W it has happened during this match, poor guy|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I gotta go too, ty all and have a nice weekend!|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have all been there (or at least I have) |pg||
nt|daman: might happen here too   but not down as many|pg||
nt|lestergold: need a very long neck to get this rite|pg||
nt|lestergold: and an ability to see thru screens to x ray vision|pg||
nt|daman: a peek is worth 2 finesses|pg||
nt|thegarve:  rubbedr necks do help|pg||
nt|olson: this can be set  if defenders  lead  clubs  after  spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: will south resist temptation?|pg||
nt|olson: he should  |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rado: at other room W played 4@H but again no @D lead and easy 11 tricks claiemd after @S lead|pg||
nt|olson: only 6 winners   and  4d  takes  10 tricks  to get a plus score|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|olson: plus he  expects  3s  is going  down  |pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: just because of the heart break|pg||
pc|c9|nt|daman: curtains|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbgood: must be some special treatment of puppet |pg||
pc|h5|nt|tweety1: dbl is single suiter |pg||
nt|mariner1: so they play something like DONT over the 1N forcing|pg||
nt|tweety1: yep|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Yep, seems like it.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h4|pc|s4|pg||
nt|viren169: good duck|pg||
nt|thegarve:  in theold days the wisened pro used the cigarette and drink trick|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jbgood: 3@h usually shows a five card suit |pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: and not much of a swing|pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: will only lose 2   they will be relieved |pg||
nt|thegarve:  cigareete on table to the left and drink  on the table to the right - so coukd lean over botyh sides |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|viren169: Now @D|pg||
nt|viren169: but still 10 tricks...|pg||
nt|ppilot: yes ace adn new diamond |pg||
nt|viren169: all routes end in 10/11 tricks for declarer...|pg||
nt|viren169: probably best to exit with the trump...|pg||
nt|ppilot: then 11 taking safe side spade fin|pg||
nt|viren169: true...|pg||
nt|rado: every imp might be precious since the results among first 4 teams stand for next stage of the finals|pg||
nt|lestergold: three off intead of five off only fifities|pg||
nt|daman: 2 IMPs apart with 3 to go in this set|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mariner1: eventually someone will try @c|pg||
nt|tweety1: actually i didnt like E's 1 @h here.|pg||
nt|ppilot: 11 now|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|danilo1: Scan see 10 to 11 tricks, depending on @S guess ... actually 11 trick as safety is to keep south aut of lead , also after @D and @D (N does not have trump exit too|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tweety1: @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S sure seems obvious|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tweety1: W will be squezed soon|pg||
nt|tweety1: if ducks @s now|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Then it is 3 down.|pg||
nt|mariner1: if he ducks he gets no more tricks|pg||
nt|tweety1: he wont duck|pg||
nt|tweety1: anyone bets?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he is certainly considering it|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mariner1: someone could get shoved too high here.........|pg||
nt|ppilot: interesting board|pg||
nt|thegarve:  at the bar last weekend - Mike asked for a pint of leffee beer - they wouldn't sreve them in pints (too strong) so David asked for two halves on his beahlf ...the staff looked confused|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is surely weak!|pg||
nt|roswolf: but n/s should still bid to 4@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is a rank overcall at red|pg||
nt|ppilot: 4 spade looks makeble but with very careful play|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: S passing my stop that from happening|pg||
nt|mariner1: may|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably game forcing|pg||
nt|garnetts: flat 11 count--yuck |pg||
nt|garnetts: likely to get 4@H now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: 2@C precision style 5+ clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: another light opening we have lot bidders here|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting how E/W were able to play 3@D after a strong 1@C opening...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well after the recent excitement we can have a coffee/ beer for martin break+|pg||
nt|daman: this will be a flat hand    |pg||
nt|garnetts: AS specs are asking what should South do--one word --PASS|pg||
nt|ppilot: i will pass too but here they try to kill each other|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: is this the final segment or?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D showing @H? or @D and @H?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: 2@d is transfer to @h.|pg||
nt|roswolf: north must feel like bidding and has struck oil|pg||
nt|roswolf: now north must resist going on|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: in the other room|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@h goes down on a club ruff - but no ruffs in 3 NT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mariner1: well so much for shoving by anyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: eggsacterly|pg||
nt|garnetts: It looks mostly like suicide so far |pg||

nt|ppilot: if club lead|pg||
nt|ppilot: let us see if karakolev passes:)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|thegarve:  alcohol free zone today|pg||

nt|lestergold: whatever|pg||
nt|thegarve:  honest guv|pg||
nt|thegarve:  been in worse slam than this|pg||
nt|daman: West won't reach opposite a passed hand I would think|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland would be in this for sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: which is routine really|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|tweety1: south is walking at the edge of cliff:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: wronghanded now |pg||

pc|d5|nt|tweety1: no blood|pg||
nt|daman: Roland would be in 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: and so may they!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and theyll make it too|pg||
nt|ppilot: lool|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: south wont be too happy until he finds out the club position|pg||
nt|ppilot: it looks like boxing :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well I would employ the duck and jettison coup here---East should duck when West throws his cards at him|pg||
nt|ppilot: why pass at 4 clubs doubled when you can play 5 doubled???|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: saved by E |pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt look sadly if there is any legit play for 3n now|pg||
nt|jbgood: pity S didnt bid 2 @s - then a chance of N being declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: with 4 spades to q, south may have felt that it was his place to bid the no trumps- its not unreasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it would be a match winner now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|danilo1: @H lead beats 4@S ... sa oftern, West opening bid is mal-treatment of system|pg||
nt|viren169: probaly die out in 3@H|pg||
nt|ppilot: 4 has a play but on open kards|pg||
nt|lestergold: hes going Martin|pg||
nt|thegarve:  rkb it seems|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tweety1: 2 @dx cld be  -2 on 'c lead= 500 EW|pg||
nt|starkist: easy double|pg||
pc|s8|nt|danilo1: not only , but indicated to play @CQ ... for 10 Dble |pg||
nt|ppilot: what a struggle for 2 imps|pg||
nt|jbgood: but S might have bid NT next time if prd doesnt over 2@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: :) now he is happy|pg||
nt|roswolf: well what is he thinking about?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|daman: East isn't supposed to have the hand he has    they are supposed to open with any 11 and he didn't    sooooo trying for a salami doesn't wash with me|pg||
nt|lestergold: yeh excitment no coffe break after all|pg||
nt|lestergold: no more silly predicitons todaty|pg||

nt|sybarra: somewhat similar yes |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|thegarve:  clues about q@d|pg||

nt|lestergold: all room for clever stuff now out of the window|pg||
nt|daman: the defenders needed to cooperate     didn't happen|pg||
nt|thegarve:  this is a good example of why you do not make a passive lead versus a slam where declarer has a long suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: west will be thinking on the discards that the dim q is wrong and will breath the bighgest sigh of relief of all time when the q shows up|pg||

nt|mariner1: conservative|pg||
nt|baldfriede: strong hand*|pg||
nt|viren169: well deserved 3 imps!|pg||
nt|danilo1: has been allways 170 (or 620) ... actuallly, EW lucky that South had 4 Hcp in wrong suits ... so did not jump to 4|pg||
nt|skorchev: on a 20 board match, 18 imps difference converts to 19-11 VPs|pg||
nt|lestergold: no allowed declarer a cake walk|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very slow one admittedly|pg||
nt|daman: oh well   fortune favo(u)rs the bold    and the bold just picked up 11IMPs to take the lead with 2 boards to go |pg||
nt|ppilot: no he always blame his partners|pg||
nt|ppilot: he now i suppose explain as 2 way double pass or stay:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I understand that--but there are times when you should make an effort to ensure personal safety |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|lestergold: well this board aint gonna reverse that lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have no doubt that partner should pass--in which case he clearly would not save|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: the weak NT in Open worked well here|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W could get into trouble now...|pg||
nt|jbgood: This is the penultimate board in this room, and I want to thank the Bulgarian Bridge Federation and Stan Nedkov for letting us watch these interesting team matches. |pg||
mb|3D|an|*|nt|lestergold: with west opting to upgrade his hand to a 1 club opener e/w may well reach a very thin 3n which may hVAVE CHANCES|pg||
nt|jbgood: And a big hand to our excellent operator, well done Silvia Isaeva!|pg||
nt|ppilot: hope atleast one flat board?|pg||
nt|garnetts: This does not play that easily |pg||
mb|p|nt|ppilot: let us see if they reduce or increase 2 boards left|pg||
nt|viren169: east pass by N|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt mean to press capitals|pg||
nt|lestergold: however n/s have offered an alternative source of points also offered in closed room but accepted here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jbgood: also thnk you Mike Gold, England, for devoting time to guide us through these hands:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 1@H probably used as catch all not promising @H though no alert|pg||
mb|3S|nt|viren169: East will be happy until he sees dummy!|pg||
nt|lestergold: well east ahsnt accepted it|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: S will play 1 nt dbled|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a straightforward auction but the play might not be so straightforward|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: a guaranteed swing in one or other direction now|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like 2 hearts a dim and two spades for the defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|tweety1: Thank God nobody bet:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: unavoidable on this lead must go off|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: also tu BBO and Roland Wald for providing software and organizing live broadcasts for the enire world to enjoy!|pg||
nt|lestergold: double now will increrase thec kleasd|pg||
nt|daman: I like DOPI for Kings over interference of my 2@C openers     that way we can catch the opps speeding from time to time and still get to our normal contract if we don't|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump switch now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: or even pass|pg||
nt|thegarve:  time to tickle 3d|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: a bit over the top |pg||
nt|mariner1: W finds a lead right into the Jaws as it were|pg||
nt|lestergold: a few more in in any case|pg||
nt|lestergold: a tickle would have certainly been my choice|pg||
nt|sybarra: low @S  lead helped |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|tweety1: thats why E shld have dbled, at least for @d lead|pg||
nt|danilo1: not tragedy ... will grabble 6-7 tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: There must be a temptation to take a spade finesse|pg||
nt|garnetts: that may not allow dec to take advantage of a favourable @D position |pg||
pc|cT|nt|mariner1: though a red suit lead would have been kinder to S|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ppilot: if they find club ruff =500|pg||
nt|lestergold: here here!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim finesse followed by a lot of tricks cashing and a claim for one off|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: fair ebuf George|pg||

pc|s5|nt|garnetts: crucial point here now |pg||
nt|garnetts: A heart is essential but which one?  |pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: fair enuf|pg||
pc|sA|nt|viren169: a bit unlucky for E/W |pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|jbgood: Finally a big thank you to our kibs for their inputs - much appreciated! Hope you enjoyed|pg||
nt|daman: gotcha|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzkv: See you after 45 min. for next match|pg||
mb|2C|nt|thegarve:  its round robin teams so you need the occasional 21-9 win or more to offest the losses so give it a double|pg||

nt|daman: and Bravo Silvia our very fine vugraph operator|pg||
nt|lestergold: the  3/1 ht brwak means they cant draw trumps establish all the spades in the end game they need to ruff the fifth spade and a dim in dummy but there would only be one trump left ...|pg||
