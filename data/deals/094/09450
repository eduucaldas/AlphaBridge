mb|1N|mb|2C|nt|bridge_one: N/S play 1@C strong, 5 Majors, so 1@D is very complex :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maybe a trump would have been even better|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||

pc|d9|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|bridge_one: Antoff is originate from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|athene: but when BOTH your menaces are blocked, it all works out|pg||
nt|junka: 11 imps for Peirao.... good start|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: no games here (best defense) however someone could be in one|pg||
nt|athene: so sometimes two wrongs do make a right :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Please check that result, operator.  It looked as if they took 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|glen: spec smartly notes that on last hand, if no @D by opp, draw trumps play @S ace and another and now opps forced to open up @Ds|pg||
nt|junka: looks like 4@h n/s...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bedap: 1S?|pg||
mb|d|nt|bedap: pass?|pg||
nt|mayors: EW probably heading for 3NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W play standard 5 majors|pg||
nt|leao: yes, it did look like 9 tricks for me too|pg||
nt|glen: whether N bids 4@H or not depends on the quality hand N can expect for S's red-vs-white 3@H bid|pg||
nt|junka: or 3Nt by e/w? lol|pg||
mb|4H|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Santy|pg||
nt|santyclz: What did I miss, Rob?|pg||
nt|mariner1: lunch|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mariner1: ok|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Markku|pg||
nt|athene: 6@H is pretty good here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Negative x's over weak 2s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: hi all|pg||
nt|santyclz: Came just in time for an exciting hand.|pg||
nt|mariner1: u want to help?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: but really it comes down to north's @H10 and @h9|pg||
nt|leao: 3@C should be N bid|pg||
nt|leao: lots of time to bid @s|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mariner1: we got all the way up there|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Markku.|pg||
nt|athene: if north just had @HJxxx then 6@H would be very bad|pg||
nt|athene: and @HJ10xx it wouldn't be great|pg||
nt|leao: if they are serious bidders, they wont bid it|pg||
nt|leao: 4@s or 5@c for NS but not 5@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: I hate to pass with !xx support|pg||
nt|bedap: maybe just 2S as South but same result|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Axx|pg||
nt|mayors: Nice diamond position for declarer here. He can't get them wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3n plays well with the KQ @D doubletom|pg||
nt|mariner1: everything except @S set well here|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D probably "waiting", often staymanic|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5@c now should be a q in support of @ds and/or @ss.|pg||
nt|glen: Mello doubles 5@D, but really wanted to double 4@S|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|junka: good save....|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: it's certainly hard to get there|pg||
nt|athene: north knows his @SK and @DQJ are facing shortage and might not be worth much|pg||
nt|leao: 4@h cold the other way, if bid|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: and he doesn't have much in the way of keycards|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably @H, and @C for A in the dummy, now @D verussu A for small and K, after A in @D for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: joe :)|pg||
nt|leao: 3@d is indeed waiting|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bedap: Tully will think about 4-1 trump breaks|pg||
nt|mariner1: off 1|pg||
nt|leao: 12 tricks if normal play. next, please|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C would make too on the fortunate club break - if you take the right view in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: you only have one entry to dummy in 6@C (@SK) so you have to decide whether to lead a small heart from hand first (which works on the layout) or go to dummy and lead the @HJ first ...|pg||
nt|athene: (which would work if east had the doubleton heart honour)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s9|nt|bridge_one: this is a error|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mayors: playing on the black suits works as well|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|santyclz: E takes out an expensive insurance policy.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bridge_one: can make 3Nt guessing to move J in @C|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@S good spot for NS here|pg||

nt|mariner1: 1N N here unless EW feel frisky VUL vs NV|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: north has 14 cards so a short delay|pg||
nt|mariner1: a Roland 20 - 20 hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: someone have 12?|pg||
nt|athene: hard to say where they will end up here|pg||
nt|leao: 5 imps to Peirão|pg||
nt|Rafa: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps 5@D|pg||
nt|santyclz: Profiles of some of the players (I'm told):|pg||
mb|1C|nt|santyclz: http://www.bridge.esp.br/player/leaocarvalho.php (leão again)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S|nt|bedap: Hard to find hearts now|pg||
nt|mariner1: no games here.......|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the 3rd rarest contract(after ppp and 1 @C)|pg||
nt|leao: 5@d is there for the asking|pg||
nt|athene: not many hcp but everything is working hard|pg||
nt|leao: @s and a minor, 5-5 at least|pg||
nt|santyclz:   http://www.bridge.esp.br/player/sergioaranha.php|pg||
nt|glen: 4@S does okay even if just 14 high card points|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugrapha2: she's on lead|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: shouldn't be too hard to find them|pg||
nt|bedap: Good decision not to double the cold 2S|pg||
nt|mariner1: no making games though someone could be shoved up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass in North may be too much timide|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: probably N/S play level 2 forcing|pg||
nt|mayors: I would have bid 1nt on the first round as north|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes NV vs VUL he might have risk 2@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N would be sandwich or strong for most.........|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt however not so bad - now need to guess|pg||
nt|athene: you might even make 12 tricks perhaps|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|mayors: not after partner has opened|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh I am nutz...... S opened 1@H :)|pg||
nt|mayors: now double is penalties|pg||
nt|mariner1: this one should be off quick|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N lebensohl asking for 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard to diagnose the great fit|pg||
nt|athene: the key is that north has a singleton club facing a weak suit|pg||
nt|athene: south doesn't have anything like @CK,@CQ, @CJ wasted|pg||
nt|athene: you can never know this in the bidding - when partner bids a suit you tend to assume he has strength there|pg||
nt|junka: good|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Both have the death holding, 3 small in the opps suit.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|mayors: after the first round pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: now 3@H to play|pg||
nt|leao: rite u are|pg||
nt|athene: hence north just makes a limit raise|pg||
nt|leao: ...but no cigar... any way of making 11 tricks?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bedap: find the cold 4H ...|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes this would be penalties|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s Dbl isnt easy to beat|pg||
nt|athene: and clearly south has dead minimum and passes|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|glen: with the @D ace onside, 5@C will roll home|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|vugrapha2: that will be hard|pg||
nt|athene: you can come to 12 tricks by pitching a heart on spade and ruffing hearts good, reversing dummy|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H @H ruff @c lead 3rd @H|pg||
nt|mayors: with 9 cards in @c NS have much less defense than they think|pg||
nt|glen: in the open room, NS never bid @Ss|pg||
pc|c6|nt|leao: Aranha will have to play for @d Ax with W|pg||
pc|c3|nt|junka: @d ace  on side.. and !j too... but...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|leao: i doubt hell go for that|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|leao: defense now found a @d ruff|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.bridge.esp.br/player/leaocarvalho.php |pg||
pc|d2|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|bedap: Maybe 2D over 1NT as a start?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: yes and a trump loser too|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mariner1: well this line works same|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|junka: North bid 1@s|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|mariner1: if he scores @D ruff its also with a good trump|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|bedap: so -100 in 3NT a good save|pg||
nt|leao: but then again, maybe im wrong :)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|mayors: North's only chance now is south has diamond AQx and he can get a promotion in @hs but doesn't work here|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|athene: :) once both defenders follow to the second heart and second trump you can claim 12|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Markku M. Mäkelä from Finland|pg||
nt|bridge_one: QJxx are a risk to dbl at level 2 - for this reason 1Nt was more safe - pass with QJxxx ok -|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Markku|pg||
nt|mmmakela: hi rob,kibs!|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|glen: i was speaking about the open room|pg||

nt|bridge_one: the only chance to beat the contract was to find Q in @D in South|pg||
nt|bridge_one: at the end of hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: so that could be a big swing|pg||
nt|mariner1: not a big imp loser likely though|pg||

nt|leao: tehy shud reach 4@h anyway|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mmmakela: if dont 2 @D poss|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: he has big NT with a big NT on his left which reduces his hand value and increases|pg||
nt|mariner1: LHO value|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes|pg||
mb|2H|nt|glen: on the last board, perhaps there was a break-in-tempo over 4@S by W?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|athene: once east shows up with the @DA you know west has to have the @CK to have even a shadow of a 1@S opener|pg||
nt|athene: of course to begin with, declarer will assume west has @CK AND @DA|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I like 2@h.  The hand is a little strong for it, but the @ck can't be presumed to be worth much.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: sure pass is best|pg||
nt|mariner1: good lead for defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|bedap: bid 6D in the ohter room|pg||

nt|mmmakela: much worse contract but....|pg||

nt|leao: 1NT = 5+ @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: THAT is dangerous|pg||

nt|santyclz: But it was the only suit he didn't have anything in so was required.|pg||

nt|mariner1: 3N EW here|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: steady does it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NS has nice fit in blacks but sacs expensive|pg||

nt|santyclz: 1nt?  They must invert the 1@s and 1nt responses.|pg||
nt|santyclz: The so-called Kaplan Inversion.|pg||

pc|c3|nt|mariner1: 2N transfer to @D|pg||
nt|athene: he might cue 3@H if there's any danger of double being misunderstood|pg||

nt|athene: the defence can't hurt this contract with the clubs coming in|pg||
nt|athene: although it's not trivial for declarer actually|pg||
nt|athene: he can't unblock @CAK, draw trumps then reach dummy with a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: because the diamond entry is slow|pg||

nt|leao: 5@c is a good sac, -300|pg||

pc|cA|nt|santyclz: One of the few times it's right to show @ss with game-forcing support for partner's @hs.  Slam implications.|pg||

nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but he had perfect cards 4 dbl...|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe they reverse the meaning of 2@S and DBL then|pg||

mb|1D|nt|vugrapha2: 30 imps isn't much over 16boards, so standbyfor action!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW can save in 4@S if the 4@H is reached|pg||
nt|bridge_one: without singleton and vuln South could open also 2@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so the UGLY dbl was the winner|pg||
nt|mmmakela: all cards foul|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes however it is an 18|pg||
nt|mariner1: another hand where some one could get shoved too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: the weak NT will slow EW down...... so its up to NS to rise here|pg||
nt|leao: Ns limit is 2@s|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|athene: the thing is, to beat a low-level contract, you need to think as though you are the one playing the hand|pg||
nt|athene: so for example to beat 1@D you need to make 1@D your way|pg||
nt|santyclz: Rule of 8:  subtract the number of aces held by the opponents from 8, and *don't* bid to that level.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and that might well involve drawing trumps|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mayors: 2 @S?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|glen: here's why I like support doubles - if South's pass of 2@H denies 3@S, N knows not to compete over 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: right click on my name and join table to avoid watch Ron Klinger|pg||

nt|mariner1: hard to bang down A@D then|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@H ? 6 @D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: slam time|pg||
nt|athene: 3minor is getting killed|pg||
nt|leao: aloi still not on the board|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room it was much harder for Chagas as west opened 2NT showing minors|pg||
nt|athene: 24 hcp and 4-4 hearts...borderline whether you bid game on these, NV|pg||
nt|athene: personally i would just bid game with south, with two tens|pg||
nt|athene: facing 15-17|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe that's a bit pushy|pg||
nt|leao: key card is @c Q|pg||
nt|athene: east is pretty much endplayed on lead|pg||
nt|leao: if declarer finds her, he has a good chnce for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|leao: 4@h is the limit for EW|pg||
nt|junka: maybe 3NT...|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bridge_one: yes - strange the return @S without a bad distribution of @H|pg||
nt|athene: he will surely try a minor which finds that queen for declarer|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: right|pg||
nt|dburn: it is possible that Thomson actually showed an even number of spades, in order to get Brightling to do what he did|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wd if bid|pg||
nt|leao: theyll bid it, it seems|pg||
nt|athene: well it's a chance for Aloi to get on the scoreboard :)|pg||
nt|junka: good bidding by Mello|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: S has an interesting choice to make here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: chooses DBL without 4@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@h must be a double negative.  This demonstrates one of the problems with this approach.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: danger 9if NS can lead a @d against 5@S |pg||
nt|bedap: 30 imps needed in 16 boards ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: manageable|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: in fact, easy|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: the only problem is making sure they are all yours!|pg||
nt|dburn: and I suppose declarer might have read it, but it would be a bit silly to go down by running into a desperately unlucky 3-2 break|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 @H seems doomed again|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: now splinter then easy|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N lebensohl asking for 3@C|pg||
nt|glen: could W find a @C lead now?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|glen: nope|pg||
nt|glen: now S will get surprised if @H ace, and then @D to Q|pg||
nt|junka: taf... no entries...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bedap: perhaps Giura needed to double|pg||
nt|athene: come on! they don't give you a game bonus for 3@H|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: takes 2@S and a @D switch|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: there are the possibility to make a mistake by E/W|pg||
nt|mmmakela: remote one|pg||
nt|mariner1: (I think)|pg||
nt|mariner1: no invitational|pg||
nt|athene: well done|pg||
nt|leao: yes... conservative move from chagas|pg||
nt|athene: now you just have to make ten tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugrapha2: she perhaps felt embarassed about the quality of her 2nd "suit"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, very remote |pg||
nt|mariner1: @S 3@H and wait for the @c|pg||
nt|leao: ace of @h @h on lead... no|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bedap: still, this will be fun to play|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: acttually, the communication problems on this hand are grievous|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: needs trumps to break|pg||
nt|santyclz: Which one is relaying?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: don't like 2 NT, why not supp dias|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the trump lead gives some hope however still should be off|pg||
nt|mariner1: both|pg||
nt|mariner1: so good defense beats this|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mmmakela: ok relays|pg||
nt|santyclz: S is.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bridge_one: with lead @S was more easy to make a mistake in counterplay|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S is an asking relay......... 2n shows extras|pg||
nt|mmmakela: were no alerts|pg||
nt|santyclz: Although in this case it doesn't matter.  Usually having the strong hand concealed is of some value.|pg||
nt|leao: should be 1 down|pg||
nt|leao: yes 2@h is 0-5 |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mariner1: only chance if give up a @c and hope K and @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: now it can make depending|pg||
nt|leao: but not an ace|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: the key was not setting up the @S pitch|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@s ace asking?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugrapha2: and since they don't, nothing good can happen with the 3-3 @H|pg||
nt|bedap: when she didn't double, east may have assumed diamonds as her second|pg||
nt|bedap: 2S = 5-4 spades & minor|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I think , from the 5@D bid, that that is right|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: but then, East perhaps needed toshowvalues, to make the X easier|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice switch.......|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|mariner1: well done|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|bedap: didn't need this, needed +500 vs 5Cx|pg||

nt|mariner1: good defense|pg||
nt|athene: he can't really get much of a count as he doesn't know the spade position|pg||

nt|athene: i don't know there was much to go on, there|pg||
nt|leao: yes... he had every clue|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps a bit of restricted choice on opening lead|pg||
nt|athene: with Qxxx in BOTH minors, east had a choice|pg||
nt|leao: that was possible to have|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bedap: wk NT like most pairs in this final|pg||
nt|leao: closed room is playing just 4@h, so Peirao should win 10 imps|pg||

mb|2C|nt|vugrapha2: the renascense of Acol!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S a nice spot|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bedap: i've always said BBO needed a spellchecker|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: check your dictionary|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N would have issues though defense might help|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: N passing?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bets withdrawn|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N makes too,,,,,,|pg||
mb|2S|nt|leao: 1NT is FG|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 2 @H more probable|pg||
nt|bridge_one: agree - better 2@H |pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: notice @S slam does not make as @H will not set up|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: N should try 3@H I think and did|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: and @S are 3 1|pg||
nt|athene: west did well to make 11 tricks in the other room|pg||
nt|leao: since 1@s is equivalent to 1NT|pg||
nt|leao: they play tfers to the @C opening|pg||
nt|leao: 2@d was an inquiry|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Maybe if we all applaud really loudly we can convince the lovely and talented Nicoleta Giura to join us and translate the auctions.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: dbl helped to stay under|pg||
nt|mariner1: are they using 2@C as a hand quality ask?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: even picking up the clubs you have only 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: wait maybe it can............. make........|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|athene: there are various squeeze possibilities though|pg||
nt|leao: u can with that lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|mariner1: told it shows 10 - 11 artificial|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|leao: 3nt was unbeatble, with a @h lead declarer can give up the @c ace and shalk up 9 tricks, while defense has only 4|pg||
nt|junka: no @hQ...so 6@h...|pg||
nt|glen: or just bid 7@H over 5@C and hope North leads a trump...|pg||
nt|junka: yes|pg||
nt|glen: btw, 2@H was likely Kokish, 2@S waiting to find out if West was balanced or @Hs|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mariner1: so NS use 2@C as 10 - 11 and 2@D as game forcing|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes it makes,,,,, this line......|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: a double squeeze perhaps|pg||

nt|mariner1: 4@S EW here|pg||
nt|mariner1: so made 6 anyway,,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|santyclz: A @s lead is the only lead that really has a chance to beat it, and it shouldn't.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bedap: N/E do well here|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 @H had no chance|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mariner1: 1@H = @S here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S makes 3N makes EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: dbl? or pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need to guess|pg||
nt|athene: well the defence have five fairly obvious tricks against diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: (@SK, two hearts, club, @DK)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N has a shot|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: pass works too|pg||
nt|mayors: not keen on the pre-empt with A and K on side |pg||
nt|athene: they have to organise something else to beat it - trump promotion around clubs or something i guess|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mmmakela: I'd open 1 spade as E|pg||
nt|mariner1: last hand 6@S was beaten if a trump lead...... not enough entries to set up @H then|pg||

nt|bedap: likely flat|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: hard to make much headway here|pg||
nt|mayors: so would I|pg||
nt|mariner1: board 20 was a 14 imp swing and Thomson off to the races...........|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|athene: it all depends what 1@C - 2@D means|pg||
nt|leao: tough hand, but 3NT wasn't making either|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 @S= better spades, less on the side|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 1@S for me too|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: if that's weak, then west's actual sequence is contstructive|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: 3@D was a "transfer", just showing 5 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: even though west has already bid the suit, transfers are still useful|pg||
nt|athene: west can use it to sign off in 3@H for example, or offer choice of games (as here)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|leao: EW makes 5@c|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bridge_one: with KQx in @C in South, and Jx in @h, 3Nt are safe - 5@d no|pg||

nt|santyclz: Or 3nt.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||

mc|10|nt|glen: this will pick up imps compared to 5@D in the other room, but 3NT had 9 tricks since EW could not get a 4@S to go with the @H ace|pg||

nt|mariner1: Thomson team extending their lead so far....|pg||
nt|athene: so he wasn't too unhappy when the diamond finesse lost, as it gave him a dummy entry with the @DJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: And the match has tightened up.|pg||

nt|mariner1: - Teams|pg||
nt|glen: 2@H promises @S plus minor, so 2@S is a raise in @Hs - game invite or better|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: what to bid with teh North hand though?|pg||
nt|bedap: i lke pass but bid 2NT over 2H as South|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I might bid 2Nt as South, assuing 15-17|pg||
nt|bedap: 2D = standard multi|pg||
nt|leao: aloi might have ducked the @d|pg||
nt|athene: south can't be happy about passing 4@H but it's surely the percentage action when partner couldn't say anything over 2@H|pg||
mb|5C|nt|leao: 4@s for e/w|pg||
nt|glen: some might have bid 3@S over 2@H|pg||

nt|dburn: after all, how could he know that his side was about to make four spade tricks?|pg||

nt|dburn: was that the real auction at the other table?|pg||
nt|mariner1: neither 3N nor 4@S makes here..... too much off and poor breaks|pg||
nt|athene: you might consider the south hand is too "in between" for 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: if you play it as weak or strong|pg||
nt|athene: so you start with 2@D and bid clubs next|pg||

nt|leao: awkward situation now...|pg||
nt|glen: 3@C is some sort of raise here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 11 opposite a good 14 leads to some game often|pg||

mb|5C|nt|mariner1: well the @H lead allows 3N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but with @C lead it is the same - easy to leave the communications between N/S|pg||
nt|sybarra: we headed to 4 @S?  or?|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Bermuda Bowl is in Brazil this year|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure 4 @S makes|pg||
nt|athene: but that south hand doesn't really want a major suit to be trumpsd|pg||
nt|leao: this makes as cards are|pg||
nt|leao: opportunity for aloi|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|santyclz: Maybe 3nt after the overcall warned about breaks.|pg||

nt|mariner1: K@H on, Q@D on|pg||
nt|athene: (black aces)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H makes so 4@S good save|pg||

nt|athene: you can put a lot of pressure on east though|pg||
nt|leao: wud have to risk @h finesse|pg||
nt|athene: if you run this to dummy, lead a club to the @CK, then return to @HA and lead another club|pg||

nt|leao: last board in closed room|pg||
nt|santyclz: S isn't going to have to decide whether that hand is too good for 1nt.|pg||
nt|leao: next round will be in 1 hour or so|pg||
nt|leao: another lucky 7@h|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm going to dessert you after this one.  I'm sched at midnight tonight and will need a nap.|pg||
nt|leao: sweet dreams :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Rob , you are the best writer i seen in all my life !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: congratulation |pg||

nt|mariner1: Our appreciation to the ABF, Nick Fahrer, all the generous sponsors and organizers|pg||
nt|mariner1: for helping BBO bring us the vugraphs!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|glen: 6@C nice spot in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: ok|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S interesting opening here..........|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bedap: who owns the 5-level?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: fastest at least(no pre-copypastes,right?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I'll never tell (except see that link as I already told)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if weak opening I detest it|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugrapha2: books say the opponents|pg||
nt|camacho: I don´t like to pass with 6 of minor when I can open with 3|pg||
nt|athene: now east might go 3@D transfer?|pg||
nt|athene: given they seem to play transfers here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: -2 looks like a lot |pg||
nt|mariner1: also a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates, Sharon|pg||

nt|mariner1: Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge lovers|pg||
nt|mariner1: worldwide!|pg||
mb|4C|nt|santyclz: This one is pretty reasonable, all it takes is a 3-2 @h break and no ruff on opening lead.  7nt just needs the break.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh but poor declarer never gets to dummy   |pg||
nt|santyclz: Stiff j or @hs is fine too.  |pg||
nt|santyclz: (of)|pg||
nt|glen: we will invite Roland back to explain the useful 4@C Gerber bid|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bedap: this needs some work ....|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: E an entry short to make this unless defense helps|pg||
nt|mariner1: last but definitely not least, thanks to all our spectators, their tips and comments help|pg||
nt|mariner1: a lot!|pg||
mb|4N|nt|bridge_one: down with return @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: hmm, perhaps 4@C was not Gerber|pg||
mb|5D|nt|bridge_one: no|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D return|pg||
nt|mmmakela: any after 2 hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: no 2 @H allows a ruff on E to hook @S twice|pg||
nt|camacho: almost same bidding|pg||
nt|athene: looks as though there is 650 available here|pg||
nt|glen: since 4@S is not two aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|junka: slamish w/ @cs|pg||
nt|camacho: 4@c = suit is @c, cubids pls|pg||
nt|glen: Roland would be pleased - 4@C strong and slamish|pg||
mb|5N|nt|bedap: even if you get red suits right, come up short|pg||
nt|mmmakela: no needs a nonspade|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm.  The wheels fell off.|pg||
nt|leao: i woud have bid 3@h with Carvalho's hand on the 2nd round, to should an excellent suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|santyclz: I'm going to desert you after this one.  Still exhausted from 5 matches yesterday and don't have any insights in the bidding anyway.|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Joe :)|pg||
nt|glen: 6@C = i have specifically nothing|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: he can make it now|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu Joe,  |pg||
nt|camacho: 5N = grand invitation I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|glen: is this the last board of the set?|pg||
nt|junka: yes... last board|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bridge_one: would need the lead @D - now can plat the second @H to go in the dummy with a ruff - @D for A, @H, @c and no chance to no lose a @S|pg||
nt|santyclz: G'nite mates.|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Andrew Morcombe (Australia), our superb operator, for doing an|pg||
