nt|starkist: hard to find the @c partial|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|garnetts: 4@S made in the OR and I cannot quite see how yet--unless they took the double spade finesse|pg||
nt|santyclz: As Kaplan used to say:  I have nothing against opening a (weak) nt with a 5-card suit, I just haven't come across the right hand yet.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|granguru: Now S needs only a stiff @H in N hand for 6@S|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a penalty P on 3@sD had costed -4|pg||

nt|eamongall: suppose its 6@Ds for EW|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ralfwil: Eamonn I think its because it´s the last one and you want everybody to watch all boards|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|viren169: E/W reached the dizzy height of 4@H in the other room!|pg||

nt|viren169: and passing whtever response no doubt!|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am not going to do commentators curse|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: East is very optimistic after such a response|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: And after Ps 2@c?|pg||

pc|c2|nt|starkist: going to make a lot|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mrt2000: who's doing the thinking here?|pg||
nt|granguru: In fact with a @d lead it also can be made|pg||
pc|cK|nt|garnetts: You can bid 2@H over 2@D and expect partner to bid 2@S with three spades and two hearts|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|granguru: it is very against probabilities thou|pg||
nt|viren169: and with a 45xx shape?|pg||
nt|viren169: I would prefer pd to pass 2@H on that seq...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|santyclz: Perfect trumps for a high x-ruff, difficult with 4333 however.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to avoid a crossruff in the defence, he must clean trumps|pg||
nt|eamongall: however Ireland finish with a win ...finishing with a win is good to quote rory boland |pg||
nt|eamongall: 17-13 victory to Ireland|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|garnetts: AS Peter Goodman has argued that with the odd shapes that are opened 1NT these days it has risk attached |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: clean trumps and take your 9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eamongall: EBU going to be the champions of Camrose for this year |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|viren169: True... best to pass 2@D and take your chances!|pg||
nt|garnetts: You may be amazed to know I prefer to open 1NT with a balanced hand which excludes most 5-4-2-2 shapes and 6-3-2-2 shapes as well|pg||
nt|viren169: worse hand 3325 shape|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru: well - when playing ghestem michaels copenhagen or any other....normally you have an opportunity to show the great hand by bidding again|pg||

nt|garnetts: I think my oppo should be made to use it|pg||
nt|viren169: playing for high stakes no doubt!|pg||
nt|garnetts: it works especially badly if playing 2/1 because it does not allow you develop middle range hands with a decent six card suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru: but hard that the defense get all their tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: even 5@S can go down with the diamond ruff, which would be a bit unlucky|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru: -2 if a good @D guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Crucial when playing splinters that it shows a singlton not a void|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@C is a bit of an overbid... with wasted values in diamonds|pg||
nt|eamongall: through grinding teeth|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@c was forcing to game|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|garnetts: Depends upon agreements but splinters should also have specified working values|pg||

nt|granguru: Here you might earn 6D|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Kelsey has written two good books about defence....|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: kind of @S6R  meaning that a revoke was made playing the @S6...this card should turn red when displayed at the screen|pg||

nt|viren169: East has pushed the boat out too far...|pg||
nt|viren169: I assume 2@D was spme sort of opening with 6+ diamonds?|pg||
nt|viren169: No need for East to bid? Was there?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not really Gad--South would have bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: If 21D was passed to him|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@D |pg||
nt|viren169: Yes on this hand... odds are that the opps dont have the values to come in?!?!|pg||
nt|garnetts: NS can make 130 in clubs |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I don´t like this doubles! Act immediately and not now! What will he do after 3@c?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: S would have been under pressure on the run of the @Cs|pg||
nt|eamongall: 4@S-1 is a sad effort by Walsh O'gorman |pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: another way to treat with this things is that the revoking player receives an electroshock when card is taken out of his deck|pg||

nt|viren169: Ummmmm, I think 2@D has taken clubs out of the auction!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@D has the potential to entice an injudicious North|pg||
nt|santyclz: I first became acquainted with this not being a penalty x when I was holding aqj10xx of the suit.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: unusual treatment here, to have 2@H nf  |pg||

nt|ralfwil: But defence is not on top|pg||
pc|dK|nt|viren169: Tough for East to know he does not want a ruff!|pg||

nt|garnetts: Leading a trump must never be an excuse for not thinking|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lot of players use it too much|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting 1@C or 1@S opening by West?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1@S every time for me |pg||
nt|viren169: Technically 1@C but most would open it 1@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1@C is hardly ever best when it could be prepared |pg||
nt|viren169: Technically 1@C is best... |pg||
nt|garnetts: But--with say   Qxxxx  Ax  x  AKxxx  maybe 1@C is better--that is bad spades and good clubs|pg||

nt|ralfwil: without any special reason|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Y, @c duck with those beautiful @ss was very strange.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|viren169: Now 2@S over 2@C should be normal... keeping North out of the auction (Not that he wants to come in!)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And you know your P @d|pg||
nt|starkist: hmm|pg||
nt|ralfwil: leading from a 10 or J often gives declarer a good help|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Looks like West was more worried about letting N in|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit that 2@S would always get me a singleton trump|pg||
nt|viren169: 8/9 tricks available here for a flat(ish) board|pg||
nt|sharkirl: can this be true??|pg||
nt|starkist: intended as forcing i'm sure|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sharkirl: would have thought so|pg||

nt|garnetts: I have just been advised that 2@S shows clubs too|pg||

mb|1S|nt|eamongall: Meanwhile EBU have passed the century deal|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkirl: H plays well|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|garnetts: There is an issue with the alert system--sometimes it is a real alert and sometimes you do need to know|pg||

nt|granguru: 2@c looks like a @D transfer|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 1 off here as like as not|pg||
pc|dT|nt|santyclz: The lead suggests that 2@hs may have shown 2 suits such as @hs and a minor.|pg||
nt|granguru: so the lead is clear|pg||
pc|d2|nt|granguru: around 10 tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: @Dk to maintain the lead!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 11 now, perhaps|pg||
pc|sA|nt|viren169: It is nat and Invite now... with 6 hearts...|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure West will be pleased to see a diamond or two in dummy!|pg||
nt|granguru: and cross @cs|pg||
pc|s4|nt|garnetts: I think East should bid 3@D after 2NT--but then again I am old fashioned why let partner know you have short hearts and a six card suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Once again. the whole highway open...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|viren169: still only 8 tricks available...|pg||
