mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|ady: dont thinks so    defender can win first spade with the queen and draw a 3rd round of trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|petergill: I guess: he would probably respond 2@d transfer with a good 2@H raise. |pg||
nt|thegarve:  cerainly been room for swings so far 3NT on hand 15 and 5@c on hand 16|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H-2@h-4@H not so far-fetched|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  2@S relay and 3D is now a long suit try?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  no an attempt for a minus score|pg||
nt|thegarve:  4th highest longest and strongest needed no smart lead|pg||

pc|s4|nt|ady: found it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  2/4 will do nicely|pg||

nt|mdgraham: yes, awful|pg||
nt|petergill: For Olrud Festival Bulletins etc, try http://www.brabridge.no/|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The bird's species has long been the subject of confusion and controversy|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|petergill: Spade lead has some appeal - then how does the play go - set up the 5th diamond?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: mind u a trump lead again st 4 spades is that slightly challenging?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The College of Arms refers to the bird as a cormorant, adding that the sprig in the mouth is of laver, a type of seaweed, thus implying that the bird's appellation comes from the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sprig. Did you know that, Mike? I thought not|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: A club lead threatens a ruff, but declarer can set up the 5th @D|pg||
pc|s3|nt|thegarve:  Mike is a former teacher/head and erudite |pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer has to play carefully now|pg||
nt|lestergold: so not infrangible as declarer has losing lines on a trump leaqd|pg||
nt|petergill: Win @SK is best I think. Then @D to ace, @D ruff. |pg||
nt|lestergold: i just wanted to use my own word before everyone comandeered it|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: when u cant ruff ur losers in dummy then set up ur lon suit seems reasonable|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: Also need to lead clubs twice towards !KQ, so much for declarer to do. |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
