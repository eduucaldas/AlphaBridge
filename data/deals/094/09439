mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: 2@C followed by 2NT  20-21 bal in their methods|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|lestergold: missing top club and kH its not compulsory to bid the slam if only game then exp0ensive phantom|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S showing a great fit for hearts|pg||
nt|hausigel: this should make it a lot easier to find 6@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the 2@C call pins NS so far|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She certainly has|pg||
mb|p|nt|ballebo-jr: the only danger for EW is that they could get to 7@h... :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Most play re-transfers in this situation|pg||

mb|4C!|mb|d|nt|lestergold: close the gap|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But not this E-W pair apparently|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|mb|r|an|hmm not 1st round control...|nt|mariner1: redbl might show 1st round control in @c to some here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe they have reversed it|pg||
nt|ballebo-jr: i dont understand the pass from mortensen...|pg||
nt|mariner1: if E thinks that is 1st round @c then slam has to look good|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Tough hands for the girls; first the 6@D on 30 and now this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not really what you want when you're inexperienced and on vugraph with 650 specs watching your every move|pg||
nt|hausigel: is it really 650 - wow|pg||
nt|hausigel: considering that, they are doing great|pg||

mb|5D|an|0|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ballebo-jr: Sørensen is the only really inexperienced player - Houlberg Nielsen are world champs and Mortensen has played in the previous two u20 Euros.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In a way they did the right thing when they are off two keycards. However, Mortensen knows that it's on a finesse and little else|pg||
nt|lestergold: feel sorry for them 5h is a sound stop missing two key cards but the result merchants will have their day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Slam that is|pg||
nt|robinswr: slam is tad less than 50%|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: this is the luck of the game 50/50 slams |pg||

nt|mariner1: same auction as Closed Room so far|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but tiny|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ballebo-jr: will Sørensen find the strength to bid game???|pg||
nt|mariner1: she had to overcall there, here it is opening|pg||
nt|robinswr: 6spades could make if west plays it, north leads a heart and south ruffs it |pg||
nt|mariner1: she also had 7 @S didn't she?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mariner1: no she had 8@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: There is something they need to discuss here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner shows a minimum with 3@S, so asking for keycards can't be right|pg||
mb|5D|an|3|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Also, asking for keycards is not a good idea when holding  xx  in a side suit|pg||
mb|5H!|an|!S Q?|mb|p|nt|robinswr: could be zero QJ10xxxx/x/x/KQJx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then a cue bid with 4@D is much better if she thinks she is too good for 4@S|pg||
nt|hausigel: i dont see a big problem about xx. partner must hold something in clubs|pg||
mb|6S|an|?|nt|ballebo-jr: if Mortensen had bid anything else than 3@s Anne had gone directly to 7@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, slam is not that bad, but after the pre-mpt the 3-1 trump break is no surprise|pg||

nt|mariner1: well h'mmmmm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would Sørensen have bid if partner had jumped to 4@S over 3@H?|pg||
nt|robinswr: actually west should have bid 5spades over 5diamonds to protect against zero keycards|pg||

nt|mariner1: hi Mike|pg||
nt|hausigel: as the cards lie, you couldnt go wrong in either contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: well shouldn't :)|pg||
nt|ballebo-jr: in 4hearts with 3 times club you have to guess the hearts to win|pg||

nt|vugraphznk: Now they are all here, discussing few things...|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes however you have to do it|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I bet Houlberg will be bidding, but how many spades?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: 3?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's hear what Dennis would have done|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/wneed to play this in a dim game not a club game|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N is a good spot|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ballebo-jr: I hop ethat Houlberg will bid here to keep up her reputation as a junior player|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes if they are allowed to|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Double by West, 3NT from East?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: difficult to reach 3n tho now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sounds reasonable|pg||
nt|ballebo-jr: i like 3spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why is it difficult if West doubles?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't that for take-out?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S off 2|pg||
nt|hausigel: I like that sequence, but should West continue over 3NT then?|pg||
nt|hausigel: he has an 18 count after all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: she :)|pg||
nt|hausigel: right, she has|pg||
nt|Walddk2: we have girls on our Girls team|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D makes|pg||
nt|hausigel: maybe a simple 4NT raise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: double seems best at this point|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TGhen you can decide what to do next |pg||
nt|vugraphznk: she is still thinking...|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|ballebo-jr: exciting.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hausigel: well, that certainly rules out 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is not a silly bid |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I still prefer double though|pg||
nt|ballebo-jr: Mortensen will bid 5cl now but will anne correct to diamonds?|pg||
nt|hausigel: dangerous to start overcalling on the 4-level when the proper strain is not determined yet|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s is dangerous the 18 points not pulling tgheir full weight in various ways|pg||
nt|ballebo-jr: 5clubs can go down on a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: i said at start that dims was the game not clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: 4s nice bid, tells pd to bid slam if short spade is good news for her|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C has issues 5@D makes........ 4N cab make|pg||
nt|mariner1: can|pg||
nt|ballebo-jr: combine that with light openings and 4@s is surely not the best bid - true junior spirit|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Could Mortensen have passed the buck with 4NT I wonder|pg||
nt|lestergold: well with the spade spoke in they have landed well on feet ptoviding... west passes which should cos all bots now shot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe that would create even more confusion|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: now thinking again, she reallly like to go to slam:)|pg||
nt|ballebo-jr: Seems like Sørensen doesnt know the meaning of her 4@s bid, how should her partner then have a clue?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S is just a cue or?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is more like "I don't really know what to bid"|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is defin itely a slam try of some kind thats for sure|pg||
nt|ballebo-jr: 4@s is a weird bid with that hand...|pg||
nt|hausigel: I guess this depends on what kind of club raises you play...|pg||
nt|lestergold: too much space taken |pg||
nt|lestergold: but she must pass now |pg||
nt|hausigel: if you dont play inverted minors, you need a different forcing club raise...|pg||
nt|lestergold: partne rhas shown no sign of life|pg||
nt|hausigel: so 4@S should be this kind of hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 4@S is dangerous because I don't think too many have a clear agreement as to what it shows on this auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: double everyone would understand|pg||
nt|mariner1: well to me it asks for slam and E did not bid one......... over and out|pg||
nt|lestergold: double clearcut|pg||
nt|hausigel: sounds good to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: if E had what W needs surely he would have bid a slam|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: she|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: S should not DBL,|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ballebo-jr: like I said, this pair guarantees action - be prepared!|pg||
nt|mariner1: S can't be sure the @SA will cash|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is suggested that 4@S was interpreted as Voidwood for diamonds. 5@D = 2 keycards without trump queen. Could be right|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|lestergold: but south will presumably have little choice but to attempt the cash especially after the long tank by west |pg||
