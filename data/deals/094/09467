nt|jrssd: This was the first hand played in the Closed Room|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: we will try to retrieve:  movie of hands played, closed room, connection with closed room  --  but not world peace|pg||
nt|diamond_: That was fun!|pg||
nt|jrssd: a spec says the Closed Room declarer went down THREE|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|diamond_: Bear with us while we scamble to recover|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bear or BEER|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jrssd: that cut off the 5th spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play standard Attitude -- with focus on Obvious Shift rules|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|jrssd: no, still ok|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jrssd: but an effective shift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so @D5 said Wayne can stand a shift to the Obvious Suit - which is @H on this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: replacing pc in closed room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd like a new one too please|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jrssd: if the @S hook had lost, THEN a @D shift would stop the 5th @S from scoring|pg||
nt|jrssd: and would be obvious|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jrssd: looks like 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|jrssd: too bad we don't have a comparison|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|kiwi_joker: -3 in other room, after taking trick 1 with @Dace|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: excellent observation that East COULD play @D10 at trick one -- just needs to guess who has @D8 :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=@C & @D  either Weak of FG|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C is longer @C|pg||
nt|jrssd: That may be too high, but a tuff lead for South|pg||
nt|jrssd: The @DJ would not be good|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: depends upon how many tricks in @H |pg||
nt|jrssd: this may not be much better|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jrssd: a duck would still have forced a guess in trumps|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jrssd: now this will make - it's ez for us to see that a @S lead was best|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: very reasonable trump lead on the auction - even from dangerous holding -- but really backfired here|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s4|pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jrssd: trump leads normally are a bad idea|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess -- @S2 gets more votes|pg||
nt|jrssd: as are leads from Jacks|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jrssd: an undull hand|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2H|nt|jrssd: NS have a good save in 5@C vs 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is  that like not dis-interesting|pg||
mb|d|nt|jrssd: kind of like non-trump lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the VUL jump overcall =12-16 with 6+@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Al and John, I was in Iceland..... just got back :)|pg||
nt|jrssd: but I don't thk 4@H will make without some help from the defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neg dbl from Bach will slow the auction down|pg||
nt|Walddk3: From Iceland to New Zealand in 48 seconds is a new world record|pg||
nt|jrssd: Hi Rob, I'm still in the US|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: it took me 10 minutes to go from Brazil to New Zealand -- go figure|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk3: They are 12 hours apart as far as time zones are concerned|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: we are entering the lost scores now|pg||

nt|mariner1: in the wing :)|pg||
nt|jrssd: does anyone know the score from the Closed Room on this deal?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: it is not scored in Closed IF they played it yet|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: there it is|pg||

nt|ahollan1: closed room p/c was swapped out -- they just announced scores are being manually entered --|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mariner1: yes wery push looking|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||

nt|mariner1: http://www.nzbridge.co.nz/international/  -  Tournament site|pg||
nt|jrssd: 3 immutable losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: almost par -- well done for both rooms to get to 4@H then save in 5@C|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jrssd: 4@H is a save vs 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: !Q is Rusinow -- ONLY at 5 level or higher and NOT in partner's suit|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jrssd: I suppose it's possible to make 4H |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||

nt|mariner1: (Allanr44 made me say that)|pg||
mc|10|nt|ahollan1: he's from OZ -- has no rights in New Zealand|pg||
nt|jrssd: use the one entry, the @HA, to lead spades, guess them and evenutally ruff the 4th @S for another entry to lead towards the @DK|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: could see a double doubled game swing here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: 5@H or 5@S DBL making?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: can NS even get in now?|pg||
nt|jrssd: NS are frozen out|pg||
nt|jrssd: the 3N bid was very effective|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: 3N=13-15, 3@S, no splinter|pg||
nt|jrssd: it's a big stretch for South to force his side to the 4 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: wow he did|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mariner1: or did he ?|pg||
nt|jrssd: no, had to be an error|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C & @D = cue  [1st & 2nd round shown indiscriminately]|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well safe to say NS will not be in 5@C|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|jrssd: let's see if the brakes are working...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even 5@S is at risk|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes however imps no matter what|pg||
nt|mariner1: imps to Burrows|pg||
mb|p|nt|jrssd: 2-2 trumps would meke declarer's life easier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we've lost some auctions from other room because of p/c problem -- but they may be entered later|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mariner1: 10@H coming down helps|pg||
nt|mariner1: and there it is|pg||
nt|jrssd: yes, we have an auction on the next hand|pg||
nt|jrssd: I can't see riding this...|pg||
nt|jrssd: it SMELLS lke a singleton|pg||
nt|mariner1: take he can make, duck and he is down a couple|pg||
nt|jrssd: even more so at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: 'she'|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italian style cue bids didn't help here -- i wonder if they gain in Finding slam, but lose in occassionally getting too high when no slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: she :)|pg||
nt|jrssd: it's Pam Livingston|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|c2|pg||

nt|mariner1: yes and he is off now|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h4|pc|s5|nt|jrssd: yes, t thnk that was costly|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: hey Michael -- when did you arrive?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||

nt|jrssd: rt|pg||
nt|mwigor: hi all|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Michael|pg||
nt|jrssd: Hi Michael|pg||
nt|jrssd: South can play AC when in with the @HK, but then North can't do anything to hurt declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pull last trump -- South wins 2nd @H then @CA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok - how about win 2nd @H then LOW @C|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|jrssd: but it sure made declarer's life more exciting|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c6|pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: now must guess @D AND @CA|pg||
nt|mwigor: low @c puts declarer to the test - but his only chance to make is @cA with south|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but only because of 2nd trick ruff of @C|pg||
nt|jrssd: exactly|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mariner1: now S has to give a play|pg||
nt|jrssd: here we go|pg||
nt|mariner1: trumping is off so he has to duck|pg||
nt|mariner1: she|pg||
nt|jrssd: the plus is, if the @CK wins he doesnt' have to guess @D either|pg||
nt|jrssd: she|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is how Ashley Bach became 6th in lifetime NZ MonsterPoints [will 5th or 4th by end of the year]|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jrssd: look at it this way - if the A@C is with N, you cant make it|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: Monster Points -- first used by Hideous Hog when referring to playing for master points rather than real bridge -- for MONEY|pg||
nt|vugraphznq: Off for a breather after that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from Victor Mollo's Bridge in the Menagerie series|pg||
nt|jrssd: that was probably a 10 minute hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: match a lot closer now|pg||
nt|jrssd: The West chair is being swabbed down now...|pg||

nt|westjava: 4@H vs 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hard to bid 5s with north hand aceless wonder|pg||
nt|oosmanb: south will probably bid 5@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if they double they lose another 4 imps|pg||
nt|werge: South can NOT bid 5 @S - after this break in time|pg||
nt|oosmanb: N better do something then|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is a good point Hans ethical probs created by along tank here|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - but if he doubles, it´s over. With pass - it´s more delicate|pg||
nt|lestergold: whether or not there ae screens a long hesitation can convey significant info inadvertently or unintentionally albeit|pg||
nt|werge: West may have hesitated 10 minutes, but North must cover the remaining 25|pg||
nt|msap: Beg is not aware as to who is delaying the bid on the other side|pg||
nt|msap: so he cannot be debarred|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think its very hard for south to do anything other than double if this is passed round to himj now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|don_kapu: would EW bid 6@S ? With West ambition ?|pg||

nt|westjava: Mitra Buana Jakarta is the winner of RR-1 of Indonesia Bridge League|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: and two low doubletons|pg||

nt|ahollan1: last board of the set -- 16 more boards in the match -- scheduled to begin in about 35 minutes|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C just a bit energetic here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great job from our operator David Skipper - especially with room crash and losing the other pc|pg||
nt|jrssd: but move the SA to the @DK...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jrssd: and it's cold|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2N|nt|jrssd: it's hard to work that out in the bidding!|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jrssd: this gives NS a chance to stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thanks to Arie Geusen - Chief Director, in charge of bringing us vugraph AND worrying about wife's results in Women's Match|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: I see 8, is there a 9th?|pg||

nt|vugraphznq: pretty quick|pg||
nt|jrssd: tks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Burrows had fought back valiantly -- but really let quite a few imps go the wrong way in last 8 boards|pg||
nt|jrssd: Bach-Cornell have had a great set, IMO|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right|pg||
nt|mariner1: well there are 16 more to play so............|pg||
nt|jrssd: they got a Lot right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cornell-Bach should get a lot of credit for pressure they put on Livingston-Burrows|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session in 29 minutes|pg||
nt|jrssd: yes, it was Meckwell like pressure|pg||
nt|mariner1: the two hands that stood out to me where the NS 1N where EW were in 3N in|pg||
nt|mariner1: Closed Room|pg||
nt|jrssd: and that IS the standard for pressure|pg||
nt|mariner1: and neither 1N was DBL'd|pg||
nt|jrssd: rt, stealing |pg||
nt|jrssd: legal larceny|pg||
nt|mariner1: if you sit on your hands you will lose a lot of matches..........|pg||
nt|mariner1: and have flat hands............|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and if you sit on someone else's hands??|pg||
nt|mariner1: you get free room and board, one way or another :)|pg||
nt|jrssd: I don't think you can pin this on fatigue, Cornell is the 4-handed team!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|jrssd: while Burrows is 6-handed|pg||
nt|jrssd: (I use handed on purpose)|pg||
nt|jrssd: (as opposed to 6-MAN, or course)|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe they are being too carefull|pg||
nt|jrssd: but the Cornell team WAS a favorite|pg||
nt|jrssd: but as Rob said, there's 16 more to go|pg||
nt|jrssd: this is not an insurmountable lead by any means|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other years the 3rd pair was chosed from the 2nd place team - but that is not obligatory|pg||
nt|jrssd: is "chosed" a word?|pg||
nt|mariner1: chosen|pg||
nt|jrssd: some have suggested "choosed"|pg||
nt|mariner1: selected :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: picked|pg||
