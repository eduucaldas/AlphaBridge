pc|hQ|nt|mrt2000: who's doing the thinking here?|pg||

pc|cT|nt|santyclz: Perfect trumps for a high x-ruff, difficult with 4333 however.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to avoid a crossruff in the defence, he must clean trumps|pg||

nt|garnetts: I think my oppo should be made to use it|pg||
nt|viren169: playing for high stakes no doubt!|pg||
nt|garnetts: it works especially badly if playing 2/1 because it does not allow you develop middle range hands with a decent six card suit|pg||

nt|garnetts: It also is yet another thing to remember which clogs the brain for card play |pg||
nt|viren169: I agree... we need more books on card play rather than systems!|pg||

mb|5S|nt|mdgraham: even 5@S can go down with the diamond ruff, which would be a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe showing a void... there are other ways to show a singleton|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru: -2 if a good @D guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Crucial when playing splinters that it shows a singlton not a void|pg||

pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: 2@c was forcing to game|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Kelsey has written two good books about defence....|pg||
mb|1S|nt|granguru: kind of @S6R  meaning that a revoke was made playing the @S6...this card should turn red when displayed at the screen|pg||
nt|viren169: Have you come across them much since coming out of your retirement?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Ok, thanks Paul.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzkn: 490 on plaer's card|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: player's even|pg||
nt|ralfwil: by the way. Kelsey is my favourite author|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Politicians?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Used to be part of Little Major --Reese and Flint used it in the 70s|pg||
nt|viren169: East has pushed the boat out too far...|pg||
nt|viren169: I assume 2@D was spme sort of opening with 6+ diamonds?|pg||
nt|viren169: No need for East to bid? Was there?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not really Gad--South would have bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: If 21D was passed to him|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@D |pg||
nt|viren169: Yes on this hand... odds are that the opps dont have the values to come in?!?!|pg||
nt|garnetts: NS can make 130 in clubs |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I don´t like this doubles! Act immediately and not now! What will he do after 3@c?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: S would have been under pressure on the run of the @Cs|pg||
nt|eamongall: 4@S-1 is a sad effort by Walsh O'gorman |pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: another way to treat with this things is that the revoking player receives an electroshock when card is taken out of his deck|pg||
mb|d|nt|granguru: :)|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@S is a little better contract than 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: As I see it - asking for troubles|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: eventually you have more control with a 5-2 than a 4-3 trump distirbution|pg||
nt|viren169: Ummmmm, I think 2@D has taken clubs out of the auction!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@D has the potential to entice an injudicious North|pg||
nt|santyclz: I first became acquainted with this not being a penalty x when I was holding aqj10xx of the suit.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: unusual treatment here, to have 2@H nf  |pg||
nt|eamongall: I bet even the Gib robots with outbid that |pg||

nt|santyclz: Seemed to be a give up play.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|garnetts: They are deliberately provoking me--why open 1NT when you have AQJxxx in a minor---often leads to missed games|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|granguru: 6@S?|pg||

nt|granguru: S has both @S and @H entry..no way to make this contract|pg||
nt|viren169: there it is - splinter again!( Not my choice with a Q!)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: this will go down|pg||

nt|ralfwil: After winning @cK N can platy 2 rounds of @s and then shift to @d|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrt2000: if E had had the 10@D it would have had chances|pg||

nt|garnetts: Leading a trump must never be an excuse for not thinking|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lot of players use it too much|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting 1@C or 1@S opening by West?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1@S every time for me |pg||
nt|viren169: Technically 1@C but most would open it 1@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1@C is hardly ever best when it could be prepared |pg||
nt|viren169: Technically 1@C is best... |pg||
nt|garnetts: But--with say   Qxxxx  Ax  x  AKxxx  maybe 1@C is better--that is bad spades and good clubs|pg||
nt|santyclz: Had a strip-sqz endplay against n for +2 if he returned a @d and cashed @cs.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mrt2000: 7@C might make here|pg||

nt|ralfwil: without any special reason|pg||
mb|4S|nt|santyclz: Y, @c duck with those beautiful @ss was very strange.|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Now 2@S over 2@C should be normal... keeping North out of the auction (Not that he wants to come in!)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And you know your P @d|pg||
nt|starkist: hmm|pg||
nt|ralfwil: leading from a 10 or J often gives declarer a good help|pg||
pc|dA|nt|viren169: Looks like West was more worried about letting N in|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit that 2@S would always get me a singleton trump|pg||
nt|viren169: 8/9 tricks available here for a flat(ish) board|pg||
nt|sharkirl: can this be true??|pg||

nt|garnetts: I have just been advised that 2@S shows clubs too|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: There is an issue with the alert system--sometimes it is a real alert and sometimes you do need to know|pg||

nt|granguru: 2@c looks like a @D transfer|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 1 off here as like as not|pg||
mb|3C|nt|santyclz: The lead suggests that 2@hs may have shown 2 suits such as @hs and a minor.|pg||
nt|granguru: so the lead is clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: around 10 tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: @Dk to maintain the lead!|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mrt2000: 11 now, perhaps|pg||
mb|4S|nt|viren169: It is nat and Invite now... with 6 hearts...|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure West will be pleased to see a diamond or two in dummy!|pg||
nt|granguru: and cross @cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I think East should bid 3@D after 2NT--but then again I am old fashioned why let partner know you have short hearts and a six card suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Once again. the whole highway open...|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: still only 8 tricks available...|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: is it me or did a spade lead seem obvious here|pg||
