mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|1H|nt|josj: a grand slam for breakfast|pg||
mb|1N|mb|3H|nt|garnetts: 5@D is clearly the best contract--but even that may be too high|pg||
mb|4D|nt|garnetts: Sometimes this sort of pre-emptive tactics help declarer  in the play|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: we start off with an everyday grand|pg||
nt|col3435: do you think it points out the diamond situation here?|pg||
nt|garnetts: The heart position will force west to unguard the Kxx of spades because the Q@H acts as a squeeze xard|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: wondering if they get there -- it's certainly possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: 4@S should be cue with @C as trumps|pg||
pc|hK|nt|garnetts: I think dec will not get the @D position right--the 3@H will ensure that---I am afraid I would have bid 4@H which would have been a better indication|pg||
nt|col3435: yes|pg||
nt|garnetts: Still we have stopped short for some reason|pg||
nt|garnetts: North can't have much faith in his partner's bidding or card play lol|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|d3|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: I don't expect them to bid a grand slam here; even 6 is a fine effort|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a very good result for n/s in the other room|pg||
nt|ctcbaadmin: NS in both rooms are Precisioners, so we will see similar start of the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was even harder for N-S in the other room when E-W were in 4@S before they knew it|pg||
nt|xenya: well 7@H is cold here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe that's what you need to be pushed to slam|pg||
nt|ctcbaadmin: yes, with D 4-3|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ctcbaadmin: if East just raised to 3S, south may bid 4H only and it's up to North to get to the slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|roswolf: north has to reckon his 2 aces are pure gold|pg||
mb|p|nt|ctcbaadmin: south is unsure whether a mere 3H bid is forcing or not, so the leap to 4H|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 aces and a singleton|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 4-card support, and a singleton|pg||

nt|col3435: and I thought that's what he was playing for too|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: another near-slam but this time it will fail|pg||
nt|josj: so it should end up in a boring 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this also looks slammy, but they'd better stay out of it, it seems |pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|col3435: I don't know whether these 1@c bids are "strong" clubs or something else - anyone have any information?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|xenya: too much duplication in @Ss|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: this is a good slam--only a heart lead makes it dodgy--but even then 50%|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|xenya: and no long suits or fits this time -- they should diagnose it i think and stop short|pg||
nt|xenya: but no...|pg||
pc|d9|nt|josj: even @DJ10xx with S is not enough|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|josj: this would make on a favourable @D position + @C 3-3 or so...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|col3435: looks like 2@s was forcing, in which case surely 4@s isn't the right way to go about things|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: seems slam depends on Axx in the W hand and @Cs 3-3 -- no such luck|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well I want to be in six on these tickets|pg||
pc|s5|nt|josj: asking too much even for a Roland slam (which requires about 12.89 % as you may know)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|garnetts: I think 4@S was an effort to suggest minimum with no outside values of any merit|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|xenya: on 1, Monte Carlo also stopped in 6 in OR, but they gained 2 imps by bidding 6N|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|garnetts: This is a reasonable 4@S contract--but very hard to get to|pg||
mb|2N|nt|garnetts: 2@D looks like a good bid here to me--unusual but what else|pg||
nt|col3435: yes you probably need South not to rebid 2NT for a start|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I hate 2NT with xxx in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: pass from E looks a bit strange to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmf: 2NT is problably seminatural also|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT is silly--surely 3@S is much better|pg||
nt|col3435: but the alerting suggests that this is an artificial sequence|pg||
pc|h6|nt|col3435: in which case maybe they are bound by their system|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|xenya: but perhaps that's their style|pg||
nt|col3435: say if this is an agreed way to show 5=3=3=2 shape|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I agree--but there are times when instinct and judgement maust override this|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzmf: Monte Carlo is the current leader ater 2 round robins, Pärnu 3 is on 8th place|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|garnetts: These hands are not that easy--here 3NT is the best contract looking at EW only --but again tough to get to|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|josj: this is an easy 3nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|xenya: routine, yes -- they might prefer to play in @Hs though -- also a good contract|pg||

nt|ctcbaadmin: Anbother Roland slam but wouldn't make with the foul breaks in clubs|pg||
mb|2N|nt|xenya: yes, this may be interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes but this is a decisive match- type hand - a big swing possible to either team|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ctcbaadmin: I thk 6S makes on HA lead.  declarer can establish a second H trick and squeeze south in minors|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roswolf: is 2@S nominally weak!?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ctcbaadmin: yes, but they do take Vul into account|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|c5|nt|ctcbaadmin: not the best defense so far.  Could go down only 1 or 2 now|pg||

nt|garnetts: when you need KQX onside play for it|pg||
nt|garnetts: It really doesn't matter going more down--go for it|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1S!|an|s|mb|p|nt|xenya: despite this somewhat disappointing score, we have seen some interesting hands -- i enjoyed the set|pg||
nt|josj: close to slam again but 4@H is enough here|pg||
nt|josj: an interesting set it was, yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|garnetts: This will play badly if East floats it|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|josj: we will continue in 25 mins from now|pg||
nt|garnetts: that cannot be right surely |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: 1@s alert because psyches sometimes occures|pg||
nt|garnetts: The men in white coats will come for North shortly |pg||
nt|col3435: so this is a psychic psyche-reveal?|pg||
nt|garnetts: a penalty try I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: East should double to show values here |pg||
