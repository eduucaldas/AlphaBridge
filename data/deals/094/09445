mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: They may aim higher with 32 combined and a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|camacho: yes|pg||

nt|camacho: have to choose|pg||
nt|othered1: This declarer finds winning plays more than his share of the time|pg||
nt|camacho: @s finesse looks better|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe, maybe not.  Declarer may get count after 3@C and may play the @SK with the length (and the presumed @HJxxx from the lead)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|camacho: yes, squeeze more appealing on vugraph|pg||

mc|12|nt|athene: normally when you are angling for a squeeze you don't like blocked suits|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Isn't that squeeze known as criss-cross?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I think it is|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|othered1: Not necessarily, just a Vienna coup |pg||
mb|2D|an|6+|nt|camacho: needs @d 3-3 and no @s lead|pg||

mb|2N!|an|!c|nt|Walddk3: I see a criss-cross with  Qx  opposite  A|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: He could have come to that position in spades|pg||

nt|othered1: But you could clear the @SA and wind up in the same postion|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: But then it's just a Vienna Coup, no fun|pg||

nt|bridge_one: K in @C was for sure in West, so A in @D don't need|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Antoff is originate from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|athene: but when BOTH your menaces are blocked, it all works out|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: no games here (best defense) however someone could be in one|pg||
nt|athene: so sometimes two wrongs do make a right :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bedap: 1S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bedap: pass?|pg||

mb|3C|nt|mmmakela: hi all|pg||
nt|santyclz: Came just in time for an exciting hand.|pg||
nt|mariner1: u want to help?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but really it comes down to north's @H10 and @h9|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mariner1: we got all the way up there|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Markku.|pg||
nt|athene: if north just had @HJxxx then 6@H would be very bad|pg||
nt|athene: and @HJ10xx it wouldn't be great|pg||
nt|leao: if they are serious bidders, they wont bid it|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: I hate to pass with !xx support|pg||
nt|bedap: maybe just 2S as South but same result|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Axx|pg||
nt|mayors: Nice diamond position for declarer here. He can't get them wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3n plays well with the KQ @D doubletom|pg||
nt|mariner1: everything except @S set well here|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D probably "waiting", often staymanic|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: it's certainly hard to get there|pg||
nt|athene: north knows his @SK and @DQJ are facing shortage and might not be worth much|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and he doesn't have much in the way of keycards|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: probably @H, and @C for A in the dummy, now @D verussu A for small and K, after A in @D for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: joe :)|pg||
nt|leao: 3@d is indeed waiting|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bedap: Tully will think about 4-1 trump breaks|pg||
nt|mariner1: off 1|pg||
nt|leao: 12 tricks if normal play. next, please|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C would make too on the fortunate club break - if you take the right view in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: you only have one entry to dummy in 6@C (@SK) so you have to decide whether to lead a small heart from hand first (which works on the layout) or go to dummy and lead the @HJ first ...|pg||
nt|athene: (which would work if east had the doubleton heart honour)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: this is a error|pg||

nt|bridge_one: well played - the line about @D was winning only with Hx in @D in South, or KQ out in North|pg||
nt|mariner1: could see action here...........|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N N here unless EW feel frisky VUL vs NV|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: north has 14 cards so a short delay|pg||
nt|mariner1: a Roland 20 - 20 hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: someone have 12?|pg||
nt|athene: hard to say where they will end up here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: perhaps 5@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|bedap: Hard to find hearts now|pg||
nt|mariner1: no games here.......|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the 3rd rarest contract(after ppp and 1 @C)|pg||

nt|athene: not many hcp but everything is working hard|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugrapha2: she's on lead|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: shouldn't be too hard to find them|pg||
nt|bedap: Good decision not to double the cold 2S|pg||
nt|mariner1: no making games though someone could be shoved up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass in North may be too much timide|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: probably N/S play level 2 forcing|pg||
nt|mayors: I would have bid 1nt on the first round as north|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes NV vs VUL he might have risk 2@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N would be sandwich or strong for most.........|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt however not so bad - now need to guess|pg||
nt|athene: you might even make 12 tricks perhaps|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mayors: not after partner has opened|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh I am nutz...... S opened 1@H :)|pg||
nt|mayors: now double is penalties|pg||
nt|mariner1: this one should be off quick|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N lebensohl asking for 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard to diagnose the great fit|pg||
nt|athene: the key is that north has a singleton club facing a weak suit|pg||
nt|athene: south doesn't have anything like @CK,@CQ, @CJ wasted|pg||
nt|athene: you can never know this in the bidding - when partner bids a suit you tend to assume he has strength there|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Both have the death holding, 3 small in the opps suit.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|mayors: after the first round pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: now 3@H to play|pg||
nt|leao: rite u are|pg||
nt|athene: hence north just makes a limit raise|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bedap: find the cold 4H ...|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes this would be penalties|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s Dbl isnt easy to beat|pg||
nt|athene: and clearly south has dead minimum and passes|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: that will be hard|pg||
nt|athene: you can come to 12 tricks by pitching a heart on spade and ruffing hearts good, reversing dummy|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: @H @H ruff @c lead 3rd @H|pg||
nt|mayors: with 9 cards in @c NS have much less defense than they think|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|leao: i doubt hell go for that|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bedap: Maybe 2D over 1NT as a start?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mariner1: yes and a trump loser too|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mariner1: well this line works same|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|mariner1: if he scores @D ruff its also with a good trump|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|d4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|bedap: so -100 in 3NT a good save|pg||
nt|leao: but then again, maybe im wrong :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|dK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mayors: North's only chance now is south has diamond AQx and he can get a promotion in @hs but doesn't work here|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|athene: :) once both defenders follow to the second heart and second trump you can claim 12|pg||
mc|12|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Markku M. Mäkelä from Finland|pg||

nt|leao: now @c ace and small to small|pg||
nt|athene: now east can play the @CJ or @C10 perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: giving declarer the option of covering to set up a finesse with the @C9|pg||
nt|athene: but if declarer has to play clubs himself, yes, he is sure to duck to the @CK|pg||
nt|leao: as campos opened 1@s, @c K is marked|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW can save in 4@S if the 4@H is reached|pg||

nt|mariner1: the weak NT will slow EW down...... so its up to NS to rise here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: the thing is, to beat a low-level contract, you need to think as though you are the one playing the hand|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mmmakela: dbl? or pass|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need to guess|pg||
nt|athene: well the defence have five fairly obvious tricks against diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: (@SK, two hearts, club, @DK)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N has a shot|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now pass|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mariner1: pass works too|pg||
nt|mayors: not keen on the pre-empt with A and K on side |pg||
nt|athene: they have to organise something else to beat it - trump promotion around clubs or something i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: I'd open 1 spade as E|pg||
nt|mariner1: last hand 6@S was beaten if a trump lead...... not enough entries to set up @H then|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: VillasBoas obviously expects (or hopes for) a better hand for 2@D|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bedap: likely flat|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: hard to make much headway here|pg||
nt|mayors: so would I|pg||
nt|mariner1: board 20 was a 14 imp swing and Thomson off to the races...........|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: it all depends what 1@C - 2@D means|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 3 @S= better spades, less on the side|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: if that's weak, then west's actual sequence is contstructive|pg||

nt|athene: you might consider the south hand is too "in between" for 2NT|pg||
