mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|athene: or good tomorrow morning if you are in New Zealand|pg||
nt|thommos: Hi all and good morning|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@D isn't quite what west wanted to hear|pg||
nt|athene: she wanted to hear a heart raise :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: maybe W should make a neg double, so that she can be unhappy to hear 2D instead|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi all!|pg||
nt|athene: double of 1@S was certainly worth considering|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Bill & Rob|pg||
nt|thommos: or bid 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: hi all|pg||
nt|thommos: HI all|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i would rank them X = 10; 1NT - 8; 2@H - 5|pg||

nt|diamond_: Our apologies from NZL - We some how picked up a stray file|pg||
nt|diamond_: All go now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, i would sooner bid 2H than 1NT. at least you find hearts that way, which is the most likely game if there is one|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|athene: how about bidding 1nt and then hoping to slide into hearts later?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|diamond_: The women are playing a 128 board Knockout match the 1st 3 x 16 board stanzas were played yesterday|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|h5|pc|c4|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: for me double is so automatic that trying to choose between 2H & 1NT as "second choice" is a little like choosing between 5NT & 6S|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mariner1: this is 16 boards|pg||

pc|d7|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s3|nt|dburn: you can't bid 1NT and then "hope to slide into hearts" - these days, 1NT more or|pg||
nt|dburn: less denies four hearts, never mind five|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: well i would be doubling too, but 1nt and 2@H aren't THAT bad...they might be about 3 or 4 imps worse than X|pg||

mb|1S|nt|athene: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: only part scores here|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: you can double 2@D now i suppose|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: or not, of course|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I open E too,,,, have to bid NV vs VUL|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: the problem is that it is not always easy to come in later, and when you do the declarer can usually place the cards very accurately|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with passing "soundly" first time is, the bidding isn't going to be anything but higher when it comes round to you again :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW could have shoved them up to 3 level had E opened|pg||
nt|athene: you only get one chance to bid clubs at the 1-level|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also you can;t make an insufficient bid in clubs at the one level, another plus for opening :)|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but if it doesn't show clubs, it isn't safe to bid it|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|mariner1: its the classic case of sitting on your hands............|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|s3|nt|athene: well i can think of a large number of people who would happily open a non-minor with that east hand|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: if you sit on your hands, instead of being aggressive, you will lose a lot of|pg||
nt|mariner1: matches...........|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as long as you are playing support doubles i think it is still a long-run winner to open this E hand even if 1C doesnt promise clubs|pg||
nt|athene: i mean a minor that's a non-suit :) |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|mariner1: and have flat hands....... :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|thommos: yes, it did have an A and 2 K in its 11|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|athene: yes, strong clubbers are all opening it 1@D without a care in the world|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: if you are playing support doubles, there is more or less no hope for you anyway|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mariner1: David I feel the same way,,,,,, for those that don't play support DBL's|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps if you play support doubles, you should try to avoid opening altogether, to minimize the risk you might have to make one? :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right David, Meckstroth Rodwell are pretty hopeless, huh?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|thommos: I am with David|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|diamond_: Hello Everyone, we appear to have lost the feed from the Open Room - we are going to try and bring it back|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|cT|pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|dburn: Meckstroth and Rodwell play support doubles in the context of a strong club|pg||
nt|dburn: system, so that you do not need a second-round double to show very much of|pg||
nt|dburn: anything|pg||
pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1S53HATDQJ6CAQJ873,SATHQJ87DK9852CK6,SQ98642H62DA4CT42,SKJ7HK9543DT73C95|sv|e|nt|athene: you prefer opener's 2nd-round double to show extras with a hand that's hard to convey otherwise David - like a "strong NT double"? |pg||
nt|mariner1: if you don't play suport doubles you need to seriously look at your overall system|pg||
nt|mariner1: scheme.............|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: that might be sound in the context of Acol with weak NT|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: an excellent point, that support doubles are especially useful and cost you little in the context of limited opening bids. but both R&M play them in all their partnerships, whether ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: playing a strong club or more standard systems|pg||
nt|mariner1: how often do you want to DBL for penalty, usually at the two level,,,,, a bid and|pg||
nt|mariner1: supported  suit............|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: sundry lunatics, more strongly motivated by the Law of Total Nonsense than is|pg||
nt|dburn: good for them, have got hold of the idea that they cannot live with the uncertainty|pg||
nt|dburn: of not knowing how many cards partner has to raise their suit|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|athene: well, Rodwell invented the support double because he liked to respond to a Precision 1@D in a 3-card major|pg||
nt|mariner1: David the point really is there is little else of use for that DBL better than|pg||
nt|mariner1: showing a 3 card vs 4 card raise|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: and then, you really DO want partner to have 4 when he raises|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, those of us who don;t know everything do like our little crutches|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: i have to say, playing a strong NT, i really do like support doubles, but i might well be bonkers|pg||
mb|p|nt|thommos: I use the X to be hand that has choices|pg||
nt|marlowepi: two separate issues, bill :)|pg||
nt|athene: the difference between 3- and 4-card support is quite important|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: I like support DBL's from overcalls too|pg||
nt|mariner1: so I am really nutz|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: well anyway, whilst the Grand Commentator Support Double War rages on, a hand is actually being played here|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|mariner1: where? :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my view, which admittedly lacks the merit of being extremist, both support doubles and David's type of double are going to have their successes on different hands. both are ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: playable|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some|pg||
nt|mariner1: need Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|athene: well, Lauria-Versace don't use support doubles, i don't think|pg||
nt|athene: they use double to show a good hand always|pg||
nt|thommos: should play the Q|pg||
nt|thommos: not that it matters on this hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is largely a stylistic and philosophical divide. chris compton recently put it well--"a pair can be big bidders or big doublers, but it is hard to be both". support doubles go ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well with an aggressive style. non-support doubles harmonize best with a very sound style|pg||

mb|p|nt|thommos: East will open this time|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|athene: hard for N-S to get into the action here|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: well, maybe not so hard|pg||
nt|athene: you like to have spades to compete against opps' hearts, usually|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: what will be hard is explaining -670 to teammates|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|mariner1: 2N here is dangerous with a passed partner|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|dburn: well, no one would double - but 2NT is aggression with a capital A|pg||
nt|thommos: that lead picks up the suit|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: well, south decided her partner ought to have a fit somewhere, with only two hearts|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: at the time i mentioned 670, it was still possible they would end in 3C|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: sometimes that turns out to be wrong when east opened on a 4-card suit|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: but south has @HAK so it's unlikely that east opened just for the lead|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|athene: so it's fair to assume opps really do have their announced 8-card fit|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is no reason N could not have been 5233. and the risk reward ratio is not great for bidding.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|d6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 5-2-3-3 is the hand south doesn't want to see as dummy when she declares 3@DX|pg||
nt|mariner1: and N could have had 5 or 6 count|pg||
nt|mariner1: or less|pg||
nt|dburn: curious, though - why bid 3@d?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: The auction worked out well for S---she didn;t even have to put this hand down as dummy :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|thommos: better @D and less likey to be X|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i assume the pass over trhew double showed equal length--or at least S thought that it did|pg||

nt|marlowepi: even with her running club suit? :)|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, it's not so much that, but with 4-4 in the minors you might redouble|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: will east overcall 1nt over 1@S? some might want a wee bit more playing strength perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: but you aren't vulnerable|pg||
nt|athene: and @SKJx look OK|pg||
mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: for me 1NT is automatic|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if you start fearing 800 penalties here, you should probably give up bridge and go for gardening or something|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: if you start fearing 300 penalties, ditto|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: nice @H game|pg||
nt|dburn: brave, that - but South may have been a bit short of methods|pg||
nt|athene: north's job here is to remember that this isn't a splinter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|dburn: one that works quite well is to play transfers over 1NT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: yes, putting NT overcaller on lead will often be worth a trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, gives you lots of opportunities to show a multivalent hand|pg||
nt|athene: as well as the advantage for showing 2-suiters|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D being 3 3 and @H behaving means this is no challenge|pg||

nt|mariner1: EW have 3 N|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C 1@S now 2NT from west?|pg||
nt|athene: east will probably give that a third|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W may think 1NT is enough red|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: wow, that's one sound 3@C bid|pg||
nt|athene: that's like a Reese Precision Club 3@C opener|pg||
nt|dburn: could work well|pg||
nt|athene: for anyone who remembers those|pg||
nt|marlowepi: closer to 2C :)|pg||
nt|thommos: now 3@S?|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe four|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3@S undbl would be a bonus for NS|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: East can see nine tricks if opps are honest and straightforward and attack spades viciously|pg||

nt|athene: even on spade lead, south can switch to diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don;t think it was correct for E to overtake at trick one. i think he should ask for a heart shift|pg||
nt|athene: ah - no, sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south only has two diamonds so can't set up two spades, two diamonds and @HA|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|athene: every time i see people playing weak NT i am happier i don't|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C is clubs + higher i guess? but if so, that gives north a big problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|thommos: Assume Wests pass is forcing|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: if partner has a red suit, you run|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but if it's black suits, you would rather endure a bad 2@CX rather than a catastrophic 2@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, my comment about double was meant privately, in answer to spec question about anothger hand|pg||
nt|athene: north will think it's very likely her partner has black suits|pg||

nt|thommos: and 2@DX would of been much better|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i meant as play went--S torched heart jack|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: south is best to just pass and then double clubs or NT later|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: now double gets NS into diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, you could redouble, if that were competitive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 2C now is good|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer double because it might lead to a nice penalty|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c now is natural|pg||
nt|athene: if north has clubs over opener|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dburn: so it would be pretty hopeless|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: but you don;t have to have this much for that sequence and EW are white, so in practice N won;t leave it in as often as NS should. so might as well show the good hand|pg||
