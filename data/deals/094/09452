mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-14  4+/4+  @H & @S|pg||
mb|d|mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: don't trust running scores - the rooms aren't linked up for realtime comparison :(|pg||
nt|jrssd: 2N looks like a limit+ Spade raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: according to convention card  2N= 8 losers and a fit -- but i assume could be either @S or @H|pg||

nt|ahollan1: unless you look at west's hand :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jrssd: it's an 8 loser hand...|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: i vote for 1@S opener in context of a Big Club system|pg||
nt|jrssd: South has an interesting hand - way too good for a weak 2|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jrssd: I would think NS can still get to game after the big club opener|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 1@C is artificial  15+|pg||
mb|p|nt|jrssd: That may not be enough|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS had no bid to show McLeod's 2-suiter [only X=@H&@S, NT=@C&@D]|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jrssd: If you're not going to use a 2-suited bid vs 1@C, then 3D seems more like it on the 2nd round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i give N credit for missing game -- that still looks like 1S opener to me|pg||

nt|jrssd: let's see if they can find Hearts THIS time|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jrssd: basically the same auction as BD1|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: John - do you start South with 2@S or DBL? |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: very nice 3N -- that 7th @C means either a lot of tricks or  2N not making either|pg||
nt|diamond_: Regrettably we have lost communication between the two tables and no score comparisons are being calculated|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|jrssd: Well, I have to admit, 2S, but barely. It's ri on the borderline to dbl and bid @S|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|jrssd: The ONLY problem with doubling and rebidding 2@S is that pard will expect a bit more for 3N|pg||

pc|c8|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|d5|pg||

nt|jrssd: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially after scoring -600 :)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jrssd: those that play "equal level conversion" can double with impunity|pg||

mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jrssd: but style may be an issue |pg||
nt|ahollan1: make that Science of Bidding 8 OR 9 Card suits|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: what about 5N - is that anything other than GSF?|pg||
nt|jrssd: some play that a 4N opening bid shows 5 of a minor with 5+ controls, and 5 of a minor denies 5 controls|pg||

nt|jrssd: GSF get's my vote|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then 5 new suit as asking bid? -- something to show not just taking a shot at 6@D|pg||

nt|jrssd: but it's a specialized agreement|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS use 2@D opening as Multi with 21-22 BAL a possibility, 2N opener is @C & @D, so 1@C covers all other 16+ hands|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=8+ HCP, 5+@S, game force|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: Walter the Walrus would count South as 8 HCP -- but not me|pg||

pc|s8|nt|jrssd: It's SO much easier bidding after a positive response rather than 1@D, that any close decision should be made in favor of a positive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: upgrade because 5431 shape?|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: and what John said|pg||
nt|jrssd: :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no -- @C queen is a potentially useful card opposite a strong hand|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-14, 4+@S|pg||
