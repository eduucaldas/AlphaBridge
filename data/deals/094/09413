nt|starkist: hard to find the @c partial|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|garnetts: 4@S made in the OR and I cannot quite see how yet--unless they took the double spade finesse|pg||
nt|santyclz: As Kaplan used to say:  I have nothing against opening a (weak) nt with a 5-card suit, I just haven't come across the right hand yet.|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: Now S needs only a stiff @H in N hand for 6@S|pg||

nt|garnetts: Even a heart elad dosn't help--it exposes North's trump queen--so this will always make|pg||

mb|p|nt|eamongall: spectators be warned and don't leave ...it has been indicated from the Western fringes of Ireland that board 21 is very interesting |pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: He is my favourite author of bridge books|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|granguru: is the bidding right?|pg||

nt|viren169: David, I hope you are making notes of all these conventions!|pg||
nt|garnetts: What conventions?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: a penalty P on 3@sD had costed -4|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||

nt|garnetts: who needs the spades?|pg||

nt|viren169: last one coming up!|pg||
nt|eamongall: Now I am told the board 21 is interesting ...lets see why |pg||
nt|eamongall: suppose its 6@Ds for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Eamonn I think its because it´s the last one and you want everybody to watch all boards|pg||
mb|1S|nt|eamongall: haha |pg||
nt|eamongall: 23 point slam |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|viren169: Thanks to all especially the specs for correcting me!|pg||
nt|eamongall: they will be off 2 keycards if they can ask that |pg||
nt|sharkirl: but 3@D is a weak bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|viren169: E/W reached the dizzy height of 4@H in the other room!|pg||
nt|garnetts: There is a case for 2@C here by West|pg||
nt|garnetts: I certainly would try it|pg||
nt|viren169: and passing whtever response no doubt!|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am not going to do commentators curse|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: East is very optimistic after such a response|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: And after Ps 2@c?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess this doesn't mean "lead a @s" any more.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|starkist: 5@C was good save|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|starkist: going to make a lot|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrt2000: who's doing the thinking here?|pg||
nt|granguru: In fact with a @d lead it also can be made|pg||
pc|d6|nt|garnetts: You can bid 2@H over 2@D and expect partner to bid 2@S with three spades and two hearts|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|granguru: it is very against probabilities thou|pg||
nt|viren169: and with a 45xx shape?|pg||
nt|viren169: I would prefer pd to pass 2@H on that seq...|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|santyclz: Perfect trumps for a high x-ruff, difficult with 4333 however.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to avoid a crossruff in the defence, he must clean trumps|pg||
nt|eamongall: however Ireland finish with a win ...finishing with a win is good to quote rory boland |pg||
nt|eamongall: 17-13 victory to Ireland|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: AS Peter Goodman has argued that with the odd shapes that are opened 1NT these days it has risk attached |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: clean trumps and take your 9|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|eamongall: EBU going to be the champions of Camrose for this year |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|viren169: True... best to pass 2@D and take your chances!|pg||
nt|garnetts: You may be amazed to know I prefer to open 1NT with a balanced hand which excludes most 5-4-2-2 shapes and 6-3-2-2 shapes as well|pg||
nt|viren169: worse hand 3325 shape|pg||

nt|viren169: The 3@C had the desired effect that South intended...|pg||

nt|garnetts: This should be a routine 4@S in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@D the usual strong-club catch-all opener|pg||

pc|d4|nt|granguru: 2@S will probably be made...|pg||
nt|mrt2000: making 2 or 3 here, I suppose|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: West reckons he has an adequate spade stopper|pg||

nt|garnetts: I think my oppo should be made to use it|pg||
nt|viren169: playing for high stakes no doubt!|pg||

nt|sharkirl: getting worse|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|viren169: Yes that is true... most pairs have not discussed what dbl means in any depth? |pg||
nt|garnetts: It also is yet another thing to remember which clogs the brain for card play |pg||
nt|viren169: I agree... we need more books on card play rather than systems!|pg||
nt|garnetts: If the auction starts Say 1@H P 3@D you ccan now use 3@H for takeout and double to show a decent balanced hand |pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: Interesting hand now... 3N-4 by West in the other room!|pg||
nt|granguru: Ireland ahead for the second time in the set|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: What´s your opinion about 1@h on J10xxx?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mrt2000: 5@D can be made if the singleton K is dropped offside|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|santyclz: Good bid by s.  Get out of 1nt before the xing starts.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a P over 2@cX had been better|pg||

nt|garnetts: Playing whatever method--well he has via a transfer|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@D shows shortage|pg||
nt|viren169: 3D is shortage agreeing spades|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: even 5@S can go down with the diamond ruff, which would be a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe showing a void... there are other ways to show a singleton|pg||
nt|garnetts: I slso hope it shows a void not a singleton--there is an enormous qualitative difference|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably a correct desicion from W|pg||
nt|sharkirl: with Dbl club lead|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3NT would be a massacre here though!|pg||

nt|ralfwil: My bid is to help partner not overturn|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: -2 if a good @D guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Crucial when playing splinters that it shows a singlton not a void|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@C is a bit of an overbid... with wasted values in diamonds|pg||
nt|eamongall: through grinding teeth|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: 2@c was forcing to game|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|garnetts: Depends upon agreements but splinters should also have specified working values|pg||
nt|viren169: Well stopped... 4@S is high enough!|pg||
nt|granguru: unless a @S lead in which case you win 3N|pg||
nt|granguru: Here you might earn 6D|pg||
pc|d3|nt|viren169: not the best start for defense... not sure there is a good lead.|pg||
nt|garnetts: club feels OK--might have led a trump--but not when I can see all hands|pg||
nt|viren169: the fact a heart was not led, should help declarer to get the heart position right later in the play.|pg||

mb|2H|an|Hearts+minor|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Ok, thanks Paul.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkn: 490 on plaer's card|pg||

nt|ralfwil: by the way. Kelsey is my favourite author|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Politicians?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|garnetts: Used to be part of Little Major --Reese and Flint used it in the 70s|pg||
nt|viren169: East has pushed the boat out too far...|pg||
nt|viren169: I assume 2@D was spme sort of opening with 6+ diamonds?|pg||
nt|viren169: No need for East to bid? Was there?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not really Gad--South would have bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: If 21D was passed to him|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@D |pg||
nt|viren169: Yes on this hand... odds are that the opps dont have the values to come in?!?!|pg||
nt|garnetts: NS can make 130 in clubs |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: I don´t like this doubles! Act immediately and not now! What will he do after 3@c?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: S would have been under pressure on the run of the @Cs|pg||
nt|eamongall: 4@S-1 is a sad effort by Walsh O'gorman |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|granguru: another way to treat with this things is that the revoking player receives an electroshock when card is taken out of his deck|pg||
pc|d7|nt|granguru: :)|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@S is a little better contract than 2@H|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: As I see it - asking for troubles|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|granguru: eventually you have more control with a 5-2 than a 4-3 trump distirbution|pg||
nt|viren169: Ummmmm, I think 2@D has taken clubs out of the auction!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@D has the potential to entice an injudicious North|pg||
nt|santyclz: I first became acquainted with this not being a penalty x when I was holding aqj10xx of the suit.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: unusual treatment here, to have 2@H nf  |pg||
nt|eamongall: I bet even the Gib robots with outbid that |pg||

nt|ralfwil: he cuts all communications|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But defence is not on top|pg||
pc|c6|nt|viren169: Tough for East to know he does not want a ruff!|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes the club lead was surely a mistake with a known sington in dummy|pg||

nt|garnetts: Leading a trump must never be an excuse for not thinking|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lot of players use it too much|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting 1@C or 1@S opening by West?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1@S every time for me |pg||
nt|viren169: Technically 1@C but most would open it 1@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1@C is hardly ever best when it could be prepared |pg||

nt|garnetts: But--with say   Qxxxx  Ax  x  AKxxx  maybe 1@C is better--that is bad spades and good clubs|pg||

nt|ralfwil: without any special reason|pg||
mb|3D|nt|santyclz: Y, @c duck with those beautiful @ss was very strange.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|viren169: Now 2@S over 2@C should be normal... keeping North out of the auction (Not that he wants to come in!)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And you know your P @d|pg||
nt|starkist: hmm|pg||
nt|ralfwil: leading from a 10 or J often gives declarer a good help|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Looks like West was more worried about letting N in|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit that 2@S would always get me a singleton trump|pg||
nt|viren169: 8/9 tricks available here for a flat(ish) board|pg||
nt|sharkirl: can this be true??|pg||
nt|starkist: intended as forcing i'm sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: would have thought so|pg||

nt|garnetts: I have just been advised that 2@S shows clubs too|pg||

nt|santyclz: Maybe that's why they're playing and I'm watching.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|eamongall: Meanwhile EBU have passed the century deal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a 50% 5@c will fail on a loosing @s finess|pg||
nt|eamongall: century imps total|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: H plays well|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but there is a good @h contract on EW|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|garnetts: There is an issue with the alert system--sometimes it is a real alert and sometimes you do need to know|pg||

nt|granguru: 2@c looks like a @D transfer|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 1 off here as like as not|pg||
pc|s6|nt|santyclz: The lead suggests that 2@hs may have shown 2 suits such as @hs and a minor.|pg||

pc|sK|nt|granguru: around 10 tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: @Dk to maintain the lead!|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 11 now, perhaps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|viren169: It is nat and Invite now... with 6 hearts...|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure West will be pleased to see a diamond or two in dummy!|pg||
nt|granguru: and cross @cs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|garnetts: I think East should bid 3@D after 2NT--but then again I am old fashioned why let partner know you have short hearts and a six card suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Once again. the whole highway open...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|viren169: still only 8 tricks available...|pg||

nt|eamongall: @H and @S to lose|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|garnetts: is it me or did a spade lead seem obvious here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a careful play is needed. He doesn´t know that @hA is singleton|pg||
