nt|chick: I transfer to spades and then bid hearts|pg||
nt|chick: only because the heart suit is so poor|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|ady: some wastage    6@H  poor slam   6@S  ok   as long as not bad breaks in both  majors|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mariner1: some would pass that sequence Cornelia.......|pg||

nt|lestergold: i would bid my shape out opposite 2c|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|chick: transfer to hearts first could show 5 H and 4 S|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|mariner1: I am not stopping though......... I will bid again|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ady: by no means clear cut for east to bid on|pg||
nt|lestergold: now east is hoist by his own petard i.e. cannot bid 5h because that would suggest 5h and 5 or 6 spades|pg||

pc|sA|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h8|mc|12|nt|lestergold: and west will know that with his high card concentarted in the minors opposite 11 major suit cards that he is unsuitable|pg||

nt|mariner1: has to take control and that was one of those........... imho|pg||
nt|lestergold: when you opwn with a giant hand you primarily want to know pards distribution|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have 4@H if they get there|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   had a bad result in CR    4@H  on   defended 3@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 4h depending on dim ace position happening to be favourable|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|an|Good raise in !H|nt|mariner1: even 3@H is a winner|pg||

nt|ady: most want to be in game  50-50|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3H|nt|lestergold: indeed 20 20 hands great for swings and keep commentators busy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: I use 3@C here as good raise, I steal their suit, and 2@S as suggesting sacrifice|pg||
nt|lestergold: but most wont bid with combined 20 points|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mariner1: so a dual part score swing|pg||

nt|mariner1: I am with Mike again :)|pg||
