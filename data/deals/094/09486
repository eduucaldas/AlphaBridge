nt|josj: I would like to say good morning to the boards as well...|pg||
nt|josj: hi Tanel, evenrything under control now?|pg||
nt|xenya: ah here they are|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: hi all|pg||
nt|snorris: big club system..|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: hi all!|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Tanel|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Rob|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: previous results are shown here http://www.bridge.ee/MV/VK09/VK09-3.htm|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Tanel|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@D and 6@H for ns too thin imo|pg||
nt|snorris: and 3 @s from west..?|pg||
nt|snorris: 1@h-1@s, 4@h...|pg||
nt|snorris: oh strong @c it is|pg||
nt|sybarra: and for those asking, the cherry blossoms a in bloom and beautiful this yeatr|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: hi Arifin and George|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.bridge.ee/MV/AB-tln.htm - Tournament site|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
mb|2C|nt|josj: a grand slam for breakfast|pg||
nt|snorris: yes!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: thought about 4@S by W|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was Cherry  Blossom festival weekend |pg||
nt|snorris: where ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: 5@D is clearly the best contract--but even that may be too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting pass for S|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Everyone|pg||
nt|snorris: -3  too much|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true|pg||
nt|snorris: first double not negative?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: it was; alert was too late:)|pg||
nt|snorris: and no neg double from north?|pg||
nt|sybarra: if S can cue the @D early.....off to the races |pg||
mb|3H|nt|garnetts: Sometimes this sort of pre-emptive tactics help declarer  in the play|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi George|pg||
nt|daman: this should end the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: we start off with an everyday grand|pg||
nt|col3435: do you think it points out the diamond situation here?|pg||
nt|garnetts: The heart position will force west to unguard the Kxx of spades because the Q@H acts as a squeeze xard|pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess NS do not use forcing NT,,, maybe polish @c or similar?|pg||
nt|daman: unless East takes a view|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: wondering if they get there -- it's certainly possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: 4@S should be cue with @C as trumps|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho there are only 2 visible losers in 5c, 11 winners may well prove dfficult if they reach it|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Avram|pg||
nt|snorris: this is too cheep|pg||
nt|snorris: only 300|pg||
nt|garnetts: unusual to make a shortgage cue in a suit you opened :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a simple 4@S to  restart with|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: re and sorry about that|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Cornelia |pg||
nt|snorris: hi Cornelia|pg||
nt|sybarra: now what does south bid?|pg||
nt|snorris: looks like cue-bidding|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @d|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H might reassure partner of no heart losers|pg||
pc|c2|nt|garnetts: I think dec will not get the @D position right--the 3@H will ensure that---I am afraid I would have bid 4@H which would have been a better indication|pg||
nt|col3435: yes|pg||
nt|garnetts: Still we have stopped short for some reason|pg||
nt|garnetts: North can't have much faith in his partner's bidding or card play lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: dummy lost its @s 4 and now looking for it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: imo an example how easy it is bto disrupt a big 1@C by opps|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jaapfr: to|pg||
nt|jaapfr: wlc david|pg||
nt|snorris: dont think north liked that|pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: I suppose 2@S was non-forcing |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|josj: 5@D = 4 KC with @C trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: but it's seldom easy to bid a grand based on long, well-fitting suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: they are thee!|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge.ee/MV/abkoos09.htm - Convention Cards|pg||
nt|snorris: a chanse for 500 if east misguesses @cs|pg||
nt|snorris: not any more|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: looks off 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning to everyone|pg||
nt|snorris: well who am I to know their methods|pg||
pc|d3|nt|april7: hi mike|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S are from Latvia, E-W from Estonia|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: pity|pg||
nt|josj: you were right, Vladimir...|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|josj: with @H 5-1 the @D finesse is needed in 7 but it would have been an excellent contract|pg||
nt|xenya: quick claim i suppose|pg||
nt|snorris: north liked it plenty|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|josj: no sign of it yet...|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: down 1 can now|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|lestergold: the bad breaks are of course the problem here|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: ruffi8ng finesses of hearts looks like a vuiable line|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Monte Carlo leading the pack now?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 11 tricks |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|mariner1: told that NS here play a forcing @c 17+|pg||
nt|mariner1: still interesting that they have not adopted 2/1 style for their major suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: openers.... many have|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes almost inevitably |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: ekeks 332; monte carlo 332, Roheline Lammas 328; druva 327,5 before this match|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ex aquo|pg||
mc|10|pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4S8432HA3D74CKJ942,SJT5H7DAKJT965C85,SAKQ6HQT964D832C7,S97HKJ852DQCAQT63|sv|n|nt|col3435: well, it's just an overtrick. But exiting with a diamond on the previous trick would have worked nicely|pg||
nt|col3435: and I thought that's what he was playing for too|pg||
nt|lestergold: a cars lie 4h looks cold for e/w|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: previous results http://www.bridge.ee/MV/VK09/VK09-3.htm|pg||
nt|mariner1: so playes well to go off only 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: played|pg||
nt|ahalim: not anymore :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: they had one card missing in board 2, its fixed now|pg||
nt|snorris: knew when to put up his kings|pg||
nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
nt|snorris: and when not..|pg||
nt|garnetts: The two leading teams are equal at this point--so this is a real shoot out|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we had a very exciting and very good match earlier today here in CR|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: roheline lammas is playing against druva now|pg||
mb|1H|nt|josj: another near-slam but this time it will fail|pg||
nt|josj: so it should end up in a boring 3nt|pg||
nt|april7: after opening and stayman E will play 4@Hlosing 2 @C and 1 @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @h the limit|pg||
nt|garnetts: EW might be on for 5@C here but may find it hard to get into the auction|pg||
nt|snorris: 10 tricks in @cs here|pg||
nt|snorris: no game on|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this also looks slammy, but they'd better stay out of it, it seems |pg||
mb|2D|nt|jaapfr: or 2@S:)|pg||
nt|snorris: 3@h is my bid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if pass now np for ew|pg||
nt|garnetts: If 2@S gets round to east he may balance with 3@C |pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|col3435: I don't know whether these 1@c bids are "strong" clubs or something else - anyone have any information?|pg||
nt|snorris: not double|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: seems the player listens to you:)|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H now or does not listen?|pg||
nt|snorris: not enough for 4 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: he is on the other side of the screen... so might not:)|pg||
nt|snorris: max too tricks for declerer|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think North should bid |pg||
nt|jaapfr: scared by red i suppose|pg||
nt|jaapfr: S will pass|pg||
nt|snorris: now s has to bid..|pg||
mb|p!|nt|chick: how many C's?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|xenya: too much duplication in @Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the wasted qj of clubs is compensatwed for by the nfavourable position of the spade ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: did he buy it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: opening lead most probably a @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is likley to be flat 4h a completely normal papa mama contract|pg||
nt|april7: or trump|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead can beat this|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe but I think he can do little real damage by trying 1@S or 1NT|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @c was appropriate|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: N having only 2@H and K@S 3rd means this should be beat too|pg||
nt|mariner1: if @H broke better the could jettison a @D on 3rd @H|pg||
nt|mariner1: or even if he only had kx @S|pg||
nt|snorris: now this is critical.. must switch too clubs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hope they get it down by timely @C play|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i know the Estonian thinking rite since last session:)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|garnetts: this is a good slam--only a heart lead makes it dodgy--but even then 50%|pg||
nt|snorris: still not won..|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|snorris: -2 but who is to double?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: and no long suits or fits this time -- they should diagnose it i think and stop short|pg||
nt|xenya: but no...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|josj: even @DJ10xx with S is not enough|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|josj: this would make on a favourable @D position + @C 3-3 or so...|pg||
nt|lestergold: why such a hurry to play spade?|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 1 in Open W is playing 2@H DBL|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DQ |pg||
nt|garnetts: 1NT might be best because he can bid 2@D over 2@C if that were to happen|pg||
pc|d2|nt|col3435: looks like 2@s was forcing, in which case surely 4@s isn't the right way to go about things|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jaapfr: unhappy defense|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|xenya: seems slam depends on Axx in the W hand and @Cs 3-3 -- no such luck|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well I want to be in six on these tickets|pg||
mc|9|nt|josj: asking too much even for a Roland slam (which requires about 12.89 % as you may know)|pg||
pg||
