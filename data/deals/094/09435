nt|lestergold: not much to ask|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|mariner1: need two of 3 finesses and one is 2 way|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: in UK we tend to double with the North hand  over the dreaded multi|pg||
nt|lestergold: too good then for roland we are agreed|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|snorris: yes:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yep|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Double:  12-14 balanced or any 17+ (will bid again)|pg||

mb|4S|nt|lestergold: thanfully they are bidding atleast to game|pg||
nt|mariner1: that was a nice 4@C call|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if they go to slam they wont make because theyll get the spade q wrong|pg||
nt|snorris: north might think he has some reserves|pg||
nt|mariner1: now N at least knows S has good values|pg||

nt|mcarroll: truly laydown Kath|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: i think so to Mike|pg||
nt|snorris: if w tries @c..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East's double of 3@H was "anti-lead". "I have no help in hearts should you be on lead, partner"|pg||

nt|Walddk2: *if|pg||
nt|irwinbo: almost noone plays multi in the united states, the acbl won't allow it, but a heavy 2nt or double followed by nt might have stopped this disaster|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes that was the kill point of the hand west held an against the opdds holding for what he showed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_bird|pg||

mb|2S|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|lestergold: well 3n also depends on dim break 2/2|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: for some reason the dreaded multi causes lots of problems|pg||
nt|snorris: the only game on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pray tell where your 9th trick is on a spade lead, ducked|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|snorris: ah sure right Roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: south not standing this surely|pg||

nt|snorris: :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mariner1: well EW should enjoy this|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|mariner1: so no @H ruff either|pg||

pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or vice versa|pg||
nt|lestergold: east abiout to fall of his chair|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I know I am critical of the demise of the penalty double, but I can only describe this as a suicide double|pg||
nt|yo_yo: "do the right thing partner" ?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: it was an appaling bid much worse than the spade overcall he has punished his partner for coming in with a 7 carder in the boss suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: well at least game you would think|pg||
nt|snorris: game is ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: the fact they will make lots of overtricks is beside the poinmt|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: this is a standard hand of the type played in a partscore and er just the six made partner?|pg||

pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: How can a club lead beat you?|pg||
nt|mariner1: it doesn't, I said it lets you breather easier|pg||
nt|lestergold: on a bad day 2 of a major goes off|pg||
nt|snorris: sure|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|snorris: but in teams...bid it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Claim 12 easy tricks and let's get on with life. Remember to tell them that you play East for @DA in the endgame|pg||
nt|snorris: the game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: hmm, didn't see the light|pg||
nt|lestergold: what percentage is this game Irwin?|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are holes in all 4 suits some of those holese like diamond are double holes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mere details|pg||
nt|lestergold: 17 opposite 6 and only 8 card fits mind u double fit increases thye values|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You have 12 tricks, that's what counts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well NS will be pleased to make this one especially after a disaster|pg||
nt|snorris: rughly you need the @h finesse and spade break|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats resultmerchandising double dummy to boot roland|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but they will think it's a flat board|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats less than 50% Irwin|pg||
nt|mcarroll: just switch the EW cards and it is a different ballgame|pg||
nt|lestergold: ye or give someone qjxx offside and all the finesses wronmg then what do u make?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|mariner1: Roland will be selling his crystal balls and other talismans after the game :)|pg||

nt|mariner1: MP I open 1@S  in Imps 1@C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i prefer to open 1@C on medium hands but none of my partners agree...|pg||
nt|lestergold: nowadays with auctions being more hotly contested there is a fear that partner wobnt find out that yuou have 5 spades|pg||

nt|snorris: 1 @s for me|pg||
nt|lestergold: im a spader|pg||
nt|lestergold: in past i was a clubber|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble is that if you open 1@S and get a 2red response, you are not strong enough for a reverse into 3@C|pg||
