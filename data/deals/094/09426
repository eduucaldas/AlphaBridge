nt|thegarve:  routine slam|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: yes but not laydown|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 34 hcp    should reach t he same contract as OR|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 17+17 = 6NT. I read that in some beginners' book.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: u wrote it probably|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  even Roland would claim that this is one to be in|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's too good|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland would be in grand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: this slam can go down   playing a low club towards the queen  and when that losses later finesse the 10@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: er em er|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pass?|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are 11 trickis on top. If you play a club to the queen (losing) and a club to the 10 (losing), that will not be a promising start.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  absurrrrrrrdddddd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now, that is pessimism|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is also a poor line of play|pg||
nt|mcarroll: pessimism of a high order|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: South has made sure that he does not go for another 800.|pg||
nt|ady: what line you suggest?|pg||
nt|lestergold: after a few major suit winners are cashed the defenders will start to feel the pressure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think I would go down in slam if they don't lead a club|pg||
nt|brolucius: The recommendation is to find a safe lead against 6NT and that is what East has done. You can see how hopeless a club lead would have been.|pg||
nt|lestergold: my line is to cash a few winners and see what e/w squirm with|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David Bird's line seems reasonable|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am more than capable of finding a losing line on most deals.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|thegarve:  cash majors and watch the squirming - a fine rubber tactic|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: cannot cash too many major suit winners for 2 reasons   cashing 4 of either   major sets up a winner for the defence   also you break the communications play clubs if you want to ...|pg||
nt|ady: play low the the queen and then later finesse the 10 which I think is a reasonable line|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: what about ace and another club which gains when west has any doubleton honour and succeeds against k of clubs in west more than 50%|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ace and another club is not so good (normally!). |pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|ady: only gains if west has J@C Michael|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: J@C doubleton that is|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

nt|thegarve:  q@C now the easy play for six|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|brolucius: South took off a bit for his singleton @DA, which was not unreasonable. Unfortunately he found his partner with a storming maximum, which made the slam OK.|pg||

nt|thegarve:  what's that, Roland?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If West leads the @CK against 3NT, a count signal from East will tell him that the @CJ can be pinned from declarer on the second round. (King for count leads). But North is ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: declarer, I see.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Never mind, that was Yiddish|pg||

nt|lestergold: if declarer can read the position and effect theendplayi will be very impressed|pg||
nt|thegarve:  clear line|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer's best play depends on knowing where the last club is.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  WEst should discard j@d and keep 7@d to confuse|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer also may feel that best line is to rely on favourable position in dims for three tricks and thus avoid the spade finesse|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|brolucius: Declarer loses three hearts and scores an overtrick. Not a deal that will make the daily bulletin. (Perhaps for the good reason that they do not have one.)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: We have no closed room operator|pg||
