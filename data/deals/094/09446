mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ady: should be the same 11 tricks for n/s here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, I don't bid slams off two keycards, Calle|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: I subscribe to the Rule of 8|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Now, listen .....|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The Rule of 8 is one of David Burn's three rules|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The other two are ...|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h7|nt|ady: if you had 4 key cards missing Roland  you would not bid a major suit game on a finesse?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1. The Rule of Total Trumps|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as declarer you should aim at having more trumps than the opponents|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2. You can't make 3NT on a cross-ruff|pg||

nt|yo_yo: hello bumi|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and in fact I was in the closed room with Elahmady and Sadek, who are also from Egypt :)|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: So E-W violated Burn's 1st rule here|pg||
nt|ady: will north claim his 100 honors|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 2@s on E for  two reasons, a better suit and perhaps a later 3@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I prefer 2@C or 2@D to show both majors, depending on agreement|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C preferably|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: to have more trumphs than opponents:)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|d2|pc|c2|pg||

nt|bobholl: 4 @S in N is indeed better also with only 26 cards seen :)|pg||
nt|snorris: dont think so|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't believe it either|pg||
nt|april7: only 9 tricks in @S for W|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW just scored a Smolen one|pg||
nt|bobholl: in imps it happens less frequentially which is strange :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: Dagher  must be a beer card exponent the way he played the @D suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 4@S might make without @H lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: not easy to take 2@H before one disappears on @C|pg||
nt|april7: true|pg||
nt|april7: but some people lead from Kings|pg||
nt|hussein2: not in egypt April :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is not a vuln multi in my opinion|pg||
nt|hussein2: Yousry is an agressive player, lets see what is he having in mind.|pg||
nt|april7: is this a 2@S opener vul.?|pg||
nt|bobholl: surely not vuln against not|pg||
nt|hussein2: I wouldn't, but maybe he would especially after finishing his juniors duty.|pg||
nt|april7: interesting bidding in hand 1 in oben room|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|vugraphzkh: rare to pass with the S hand nowadays|pg||
mb|d|mb|1S|nt|ady: yes   AK  A  and 5 card suit|pg||
nt|snorris: will west invite?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D here would leave the suit at opps|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @S anyone ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkh: pretty rare in any age actually with 3quick trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a lucky slam here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzkh: and a 7 loser hand|pg||

nt|bridge_one: with long in @C the lead @D can be right|pg||

nt|mariner1: 2@S used as big balanced hand here,,,,, could be others such as weak major|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D I mean|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@d is a multi type I guess|pg||
nt|marlowepi: depends, ed. "sniff at" has two meanings:  " flirt with " or "disdain"|pg||
nt|othered1: flirt with was my context|pg||
nt|marlowepi: my usual context also :)|pg||

pc|c9|nt|snorris: probably not the way it vent|pg||
nt|yo_yo: however it doesnt look good to make 4 when you are only in 2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: it looks like W, who led spade ace, was imagining a spade holding like Kxx in declarer's hand and stiff queen in dummy, with E having an entry|pg||

mb|1N|nt|bobholl: no game on this one but how to stay out :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: a routine 3NT here|pg||
nt|april7: because of distribution 4 @S by N WILL MAKE|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: 2@S|pg||

nt|marlowepi: is 2NT artificial?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: ugh|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|hussein2: We have seen the action on the OR, apparently here there is a chance of avoiding game.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: inspired pass and gain 2|pg||
nt|werge: But how can North stay out of game..?|pg||
nt|hussein2: They pllay 2@h as one round forcing, so 3@h can be of a 10 HCP|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT must be his bid!|pg||
nt|bobholl: well 3@C to Q doesn't help improve your cards|pg||
nt|werge: Sure - in NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Nt from bad site|pg||

pc|h5|nt|bobholl: 3 nt makes :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzkh: hard to do when S was already passed though|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: unlikely to hold 6 cards in S|pg||
nt|snorris: yes q of @h onside|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure I like the 2N here...... looks like 3@D to me|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it may be artificial|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobholl: he thougth probably that 3@H was forcing|pg||
nt|snorris: even better|pg||
nt|april7: @C lead and down you go, but @H lead  will make|pg||
nt|bobholl: no @C lead makes also with Q offside if a of @C rigth|pg||
nt|yo_yo: isnt 3NT cold on @C lead?|pg||
nt|april7: but also on @C lead |pg||
nt|mariner1: well using it as artificial should deny this much shape to me... sometimes you|pg||
nt|mariner1: need to tell as well as ask|pg||
pc|sA|nt|werge: All this game needs, is @H Queen onside, but not fourth or more|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably best to play D queen at trick 2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d5|pg||

nt|mariner1: nice line|pg||

nt|snorris: maybe they dont play 5 card Ms|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: and he might play for Qx @H too|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: A tool invented my Eric Rodwell, becasue he would bid with 3 card suits over his partner's 1m opening and he hated playing 3-3 fits|pg||

pc|h9|nt|vugraphzkh: no explanation asked or given|pg||
nt|bobholl: doesn't know about single @C (yet)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|april7: so little losers in E'S hand, so might try for slam except 2 @D isa weak raise|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|hussein2: at least he assures the 11 tricks now |pg||
nt|bridge_one: and in IMP to play @D instead @H isn't a big lose|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|bobholl: now he could know|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now singleton in @C in North is read|pg||
nt|sybarra: he might get the drift of the delicate auction |pg||
nt|bobholl: but not quite sure :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@H OUT convention - here helps|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 5@D is a good choose now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N should rebid 4C over 3H. that has to be a club control with either a heart tolerance or a slammish hand in diamonds. but if N simply bids 2D over 2C, S will get to tell his whole ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: story|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has not shown short clubs. he could easily have a stiff heart honor and two losing clubs|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 @H migth be in danger only looking at S card :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|frankaus: OUT bid 6 if can hold (O)pponents , (U)nbid or (T)rump suit to one loser|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could push N to slam now |pg||
nt|frankaus: in that order|pg||
nt|marlowepi: automatic for N to bid slam now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q in @H can't be - so 5@D (a differite raise) show the force of hand (and the limites)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless he feels he has done his all with the jump to 3D. but if so, then he shouldnt have made that crowding bid to begin with|pg||
nt|bridge_one: south give all his cards |pg||
nt|bridge_one: no controls in blacks suit, 6 @h, support with H in @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: can't be sure of @H j so bid 6@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in many partnership styles, 3D would be impossible with N hand, as it is a general principle that a jump rebid in a forcing auction shows a solid suit. not all pairs have that ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agreement though|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobholl: A of @H @D from top :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: making 3 or 4, depending on if he finds the Q@H|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|werge: For what reason, when I bid so, opponents take their 6-7 @S-trickc|pg||
nt|bobholl: in pairs you would have a very good score but here no difference|pg||
nt|bridge_one: patience|pg||
nt|sybarra: boo hiss |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|henryb: from the subsequent actions I would guess it was a transfer showing 4+ @h|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bobholl: i have the fairly simple agreement that 4th suit bidder can pass partner can't so than 3 @D or 3@H is obligatory|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|henryb: If he tries to split the @h he could go down a lot|pg||

pc|c7|nt|ady: might still get out down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: I think that John should have played teh 9 on the 3rd round so Michelle would know he had another|pg||
nt|henryb: and then should play @dK, again to tell partner what is going on|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|frankaus: after 3@D - a 4@D bid setting @D would have been a reasonable choice - then minorwood|pg||

pc|sK|nt|bobholl: he hasn't got his @S tricks yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not at all clear. small doubleton with stiff heart might be enough, and 4S requires only 10 tricks|pg||

nt|bobholl: but as an operator you are just one off the spectators so no influence on speed :)|pg||
nt|snorris: but that is not optimal either , interrupts the flow of play|pg||

nt|yo_yo: and did you?|pg||
nt|othered1: Not necessarily.  west got in the way and there was no room.  Perhaps east was just creeping up on 4@S.  I think it's west who doesn'thave promised fit|pg||

nt|bobh1: clear takeout x|pg||
nt|mariner1: Rabbi's have a play for 1N|pg||
nt|othered1: I prefer double, too, but expect we're in the minority.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Declarer has no choice but to drop the King|pg||
nt|mariner1: I do not like 1N but I hate DBL so I bid 1N|pg||
nt|bobh1: 1n leaves you so exposed|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I don't like 1NT, but X seems wrong here... At the table I would probably bid 1NT though|pg||
nt|mariner1: and DBL exposes you to more agony|pg||
nt|bobh1: not sure what you think double promises that you don't have|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It also depends on how frequently people psych against you...|pg||
nt|bobh1: double brings partner into the game|pg||
nt|bobh1: 1n is very unilateral|pg||
nt|othered1: just in cast partner can bid NT, it may play several tricks better from that side|pg||
nt|mariner1: you do have a slight advantage having your hand over the E opener...... though I|pg||
nt|mariner1: prefer "usually" to have what looks like 2 @S stoppers|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Partner has KJx QTxx KQxxx 9, will partner be able to show this?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me 1NT is clear at IMPs. the most likely game is 3NT (e.g. pd coul;d have KQxxx of diamonds & Q of clubs)|pg||
nt|mariner1: I don't want partner in the game if he can't bid over 1N :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Marshall and I agree :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: usually when people agree with me they start to rethink their positions|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is one of those "Least Lie" issues and to me 1N is the least lie|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am committed Marshall, or should be committed :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i guess "zero" counts as "least"|pg||
nt|mariner1: well DBL is a big lie to me :)|pg||
nt|othered1: If you agree that the 1N overcaller will be treated as having @C (arbitrarily), east has easy takeout double|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobholl: these days a lot of folks open the S hand with 1NT|pg||

nt|mariner1: while he still had K@D|pg||
nt|othered1: While he still had @DK and @SA|pg||

mb|d|nt|ady: england have recovered well  but with ebu doing so well have not done enough|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is a bad hand to open 1NT. you have a great hand for NT but you want PARTNER to play it|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bridge_one: 1Nt is a good choose (if opps don't have AKQJxx in @D :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobholl: 5 ! makes if you guess @H but 4@H on repeated @S s ?|pg||
nt|april7: why not 3@H???|pg||
nt|werge: Never bid 3 @D - 2 @H is the best bid for East|pg||
nt|frankaus: the richman style has had the effect that opps have had to rethink - how to compete as often neither opp is short enough in @S to make a t/o X |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bobholl: don't ask me :) i would surely have bid it|pg||

pc|h2|nt|henryb: I think that is a very good bid|pg||
nt|othered1: west has a nasty hand.  To begin with 2@C (if natural) and then make a slam try (3@H?) feels like you may trap partner with good but not fabulous @C into going too high.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strange that W did not bid over 1NT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bobholl: strang bid in my partnerships it asks ab out spade strength and you know it is bad|pg||
nt|henryb: but 5@h would have been even better|pg||

nt|marlowepi: it's a good point, frank, but it should have the effect that opps find it easier to bid 3NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|nt|xenya: what was 3@H, i wonder|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Nothing more Nielsen can do without club control|pg||
nt|ady: presume on their system south is aware of club controls with north?|pg||
nt|ady: sure ly North will bid on with such good values  and club controls|pg||
nt|icebaldi: He should knew about 1-5-5-2 so 6D is likely a good shot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Houlberg knows partner's shape to be 1552 since hhe has no C cue bid|pg||
mb|6D|nt|ralfwil: If S has shown 5-5 in red and 3@h is alerted, why not 3@s from S and 4@c fromN+|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i bet there's a discussion over that 5@S bid|pg||
nt|bobholl: if it asks for @S quality it is a bad bid (QJ are missing)|pg||
nt|frankaus: true but often both have a balanced 12-14 , and no way into the auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the score showing is not up to date--there are several comparisons yet to come in|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 1 2 or 3@D all possible openings here|pg||

mb|1H|nt|april7: but who leads a singleton trump?|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|werge: Now they bid it 100%|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|ady: in fact better    as the club can be discarded on the 3rd heart     as long as spades behave|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzkh: much better|pg||
nt|vugraphzkh: a Wald grand I think|pg||
nt|snorris: lucky west can only play on @cs|pg||
nt|mariner1: to who?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is much to be said for bidding 4C instead of 4H with the W hand. If NS save, we want a club lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3 down at 5@D - so good choose by South to pass at 4@H|pg||
mb|3N|nt|werge: 101 now|pg||
