nt|mariner1: we might see action here if NS get into auction|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The VG operator is feeding in the Closed Room results by hand (many thanks for that!), but we have no link to that room so we cannot see the bidding as usual.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: NS sort of capitulated on this deal|pg||
nt|mariner1: well no action...... and a possible push|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would have doubled 2@H at matchpoints but it was rather dangerous at IMPs.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|thegarve:  I would have doubled back in with the North hand over 2H|pg||
nt|mariner1: not S led small from doubleton.....|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we know you have no fear Martin :)|pg||
nt|chick: I don't see how N or S could get into it ... neither has the ability to takeout double the suits EW bid, and no 5 card suit to overcall|pg||
nt|mariner1: note|pg||
pc|sA|nt|thegarve:  at imps its crystal clear|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, there is much to be said for it. Unlikely to get doubled when they have a heart fit their way.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so the men bid and the women pass?|pg||
nt|thegarve:  just count up how many times that you have gained IMPs deefending 2H at imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: you have a 10 count with a past partner and maybe forcing to the three level.....|pg||
nt|mariner1: against a part score....... well I am aggressive,,, just not there|pg||

nt|brolucius: It would be automatic for North to protect on his hand if he was in the pass-out seat (and opponents were in 2@H on a fit). The only question is how much greater the risk is when ...|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mariner1: 4@H seems simple enough here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I expect South will head for game. If he only makes a try, North might be thinking for a while. Yes, he has bid 4@H.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I wonder what Nordby bids with a weak preemptive hand here?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Nordby bids what he thinks partner can make, and right he is|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4H is the sort of response that you would normally make only if playing a 1@C system, which would limit the opener's hand.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he is RED vs WHITE so not likely to preempt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and are they?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|brolucius: West was close to a double of 1@H - 4@H.|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|h9|pc|s4|pg||

nt|mariner1: serious mistake at a high level...... nice call imho|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yo_yo: a 5 card @S suit might be useful to partner |pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't see much wrong with a 1@S response, to test the water. Partner might make a strong rebid.|pg||
nt|thegarve:  bid lower and oppo can get cheap saves in|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|c6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Or 2NT to show the game-forcing heart fit, if that is being played.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|c8|nt|mariner1: yes you really don't want to defend 5@C or 5@D here|pg||
nt|mariner1: btw this is the penultimate board....... 1 more to play this session|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 9 times out of 10 i think the bid works  but the 10th time  partner has a slam hand|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don;t see that the meaning of a jump to 4@H should change that much, just because you are vulnerable. You still want to shut out the opponents when you have a huge trump fit and ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: a weakish hand.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h2|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He would not have been in trouble after a 2NT overcall|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3-10 is an interesting range|pg||
