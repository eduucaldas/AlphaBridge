nt|bobh1: he probably figured--"why didn't he strip the hand?" . . . |pg||
mb|1N|nt|werge: 6 @C seems to be lay-down. South is end-played after ruffing @D - and he must "give" away the @H-suit. Now it looks like a show-up squeeze against North - and that will tell, who ...|pg||
nt|werge: is in position of the cricial @S Queen|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|mariner1: 5@C DBL made so a big swing to Galim|pg||
nt|werge: crucial|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|phil: looks like 4@s which will depend on guessing the club Q (or maybe a misdefense)|pg||
nt|werge: You get an extra @C-trick, if South plays ruff and discard|pg||
nt|werge: As always: 3 NT is the contract...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: yes, 3N is excellent|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|bobh1: declarer followed the Zia Bols Bridge tip of many years ago--if they don't cover, they don't have it|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mmmakela: 3 NT little stretchy, 2 NT enough imo|pg||
nt|mariner1: likely is down,,,,,, 3@H 1@D and 1@C to lose|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes avoid the 6-4 fit|pg||
pc|dA|nt|phil: only the commentators can reach it however, in real life, everyone plays 4@s :)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c3|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And now it all depends on finding @CQ|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcarroll: True - give up the lead in @D and the opps have to help declarer|pg||
nt|werge: When East rises with the @D K, declarer will know - from the NOT-lead, where the @D Ace is -. and make the contract, West is endplyed|pg||

pc|c3|nt|phil: not that it helps here|pg||
nt|henryb: if there was ever a right hand, that is it. but there are, in my opinion, no right hands|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I tend to agree|pg||
nt|phil: you can get to some nifty 3N's with 14 opposite 8 however, but you get murdered in the part scores, since you can never get to the minor|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|bobh1: if like the legendary Johnny Crawford, you never misguessed a Q in your life, then maybe 6@s ok|pg||
nt|henryb: what is the theoretical range for 1N|pg||
