nt|mariner1: 4@D not the optimum spot here|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@H like a negative free bid since he is a passed hand|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  new suit at the 4-level in the other room is rarely wise|pg||

nt|mariner1: 4@C does play better than 4@S with @H taps|pg||
nt|thegarve:  new suit at the seven level even worse...|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|thegarve:  unlikely but The Fonz was king of cool |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|werge: Sure you did...|pg||

nt|werge: Normally I would ask about the meaning of 4 @H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|werge: It must show 6-5 in the red suits|pg||
nt|mariner1: well is N's hand limited? do they play @c system?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Slam is too aggressive, but if you are that high, 6@C is a little better|pg||
nt|mariner1: this might not compute for NS...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|thegarve:  the lemmings have arrived to throw themselves off the cliff|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: this looks like -2 here...|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he probably would like to MAKE 2@S|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Well, after he sees the @s split, it will be a salvage mssion|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: I think Dimaond to queen is best now|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  could be find the q@c lady if  East can lead j@h versus 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S may depend on locating @CQ|pg||
nt|mariner1: ruff out @D and play A and a @H to make here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: j @H lead throws a wrench into that|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mtvesuvius: well, not if the defense leads @h for you...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|thegarve:  can play @d and assume AJ are both offside so should be ok - it will be interesting|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: J@H then East gets in with the K@D and leads another @d|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but now West is endplayed|pg||
nt|mariner1: might get K and a @D lead now|pg||
nt|othered1: I thnk they're a favorite to make.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, then west is endplayed|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: this is a case of letting your opponents play your problem suits for you|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't see the purpose of overcalling 2@D, other than gicing the show away when it turns out that West does not have both diamond honours|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@c looks like Drury here...|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mariner1: I agree here,,,,,,,,, 2@D VUL vs NV could be another 800 or so|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@d overcall is just asking for trouble|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: You are red vs white, you know it's not your hand anyway, so 2@D is not a good idea in my opinion|pg||
nt|thegarve:  time to discuss meanings of pass and double over 2@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: some say VUL is for children......... yes SMART children :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree, but NS aren't exactly firing on all cylinders at the moment . . .|pg||
nt|thegarve:  3NT is of course easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room declarer did not need the club guess. East switch to a club when he was put in with a heart to the 9 spot|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: switched|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: well, that makes things very simple :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|thegarve:  Its the sort of contrcat that should not go off at this level of play|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: however declarer still has a practically 100% line anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But even here it should be relatively easy to spot @CQ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|othered1: At the table, you're a favorite on this hand.  Opponents don't defend perfectly.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And it's all Winkler's fault|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mtvesuvius: the overcall marks it also|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|othered1: Ducking @D may have been a mistake.  Now has to duck @H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: now declarer needs to manage his entries extremely carefully for the 100% play|pg||
pc|h7|nt|thegarve:  easy elimination now he knows where k@h is |pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: The only time I ever took my opponents -7 was vulnerable... That felt good, but every other time iseems they are NV|pg||
nt|mariner1: another you don't want to be anywhere hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: this set seems to be a lesson to those who love to bid (me)|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @d can be made|pg||
nt|mariner1: you can score more on defense "sometimes" than offensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: 3 @D is not so bad here - for E/W...|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: If you would like to know something about my fellow commentator MtVesuvius try reading here http://www.sptimes.com/2003/02/24/Pasco/Bridge_prodigy_is_the.shtml|pg||
nt|mariner1: Highest Offensive Score  1NT VUL DBL & REDBL Making 7 = 3160|pg||
nt|mariner1: Highest Defensive Score  7 anything VUL DBL & REDBL  Off 13 =  7600|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: That was almsot 7 years ago now :) Wow...|pg||
nt|davidstern: When you were a youngster|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|prof 1: seems natural|pg||
nt|werge: We would not all open 1 NT here - I hope|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would have bid 2 1/2 diamonds here - hate having to bid the hand twice|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: not even a weak NT|pg||
nt|snorris: d:negative?|pg||
nt|prof 1: i prefer 1@h|pg||
nt|mariner1: Adam is old age now......... all of 13|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|davidstern: I would ALWAYS open a weak 1NT with this hand. If you open 1@H what do you bid next|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: I have found that opening a Weak NT with a 5 Card Major is generally a losing strategy|pg||
nt|davidstern: Interestingly I have foudn the exact opposite - but I also play 5 card Stayman|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: That helps :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|davidstern: So the five major never gets lost|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree Adam, 5 card major and weak nt not compatible|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Right, but when Vulnerable sometimes it will get passed out and you won't have a chance|pg||
nt|werge: I wait for partners bid, before I can tell you - but 1 @H EVERY time|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5 card stayman gives up a lot though.......|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: No because we also play 4 card Stayman after that|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: you solve the 5card major issue but create others|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mariner1: so you always want to bid twice over a weak nt?|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c9|nt|davidstern: The other thing these days versus years ago is that the OPPS ALWAYS bid over 1NT. Twenty or thirty years ago the OPPS always passed a 1NT opening - now it seems they ALWAYS bid|pg||

nt|werge: OUF 6 in a red suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: slammer here|pg||
nt|snorris: now thts a system!|pg||
nt|mariner1: so W stretches a point here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, it is really a matter of system preference, but I have found that at least in the US that opening 1NT iwth a 5cM usually doesn't work well for me|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 6 in either red suit here|pg||
nt|mariner1: well Closed only found 5@D so either slam is gold|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: either way it would be 13 IMPs|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N is not the spot|pg||
nt|prof 1: yes and ask fr single|pg||
nt|snorris: so 4 @c asks for singel?|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think you will find that 3NT just denies three card heart support or is at least systemic|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ah there you go exact shape|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: shows a stiff @c|pg||
nt|prof 1: i think 3@h is asking|pg||
nt|snorris: well..impressing!|pg||

nt|prof 1: 4@c fr contols|pg||

pc|sA|nt|davidstern: When I played strong club relay it was the strong club opener who did all the asking - not here apparently|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is mini @c not strong @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@C 11 - 22|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@C control ask so no way they can miss six now especially with South knowing shape|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|prof 1: 4 controls|pg||
nt|mariner1: mini @c works well on responder responsible..... I play one that way ,,,,, and open|pg||
nt|mariner1: ALL 8 count hands|pg||
nt|werge: West with a service-double|pg||
nt|davidstern: As East is unlikely to be on lead why does West double to empower the opponents and especially provide extra steps to the relay pair|pg||
nt|werge: - onlu helps opponents|pg||
nt|mariner1: since he may not be able to show Q@H 6@D likely I think|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: allows NS to save a step...|pg||
nt|mariner1: do not like this DBL as it show where missing values are|pg||
nt|prof 1: no need to ask fr Queens shud bid slam|pg||
nt|snorris: west might not have asked about the meaning of the nids|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: Maybe denying a 5cM|pg||
pc|d4|nt|thegarve:  yes some play 1!m as promising 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is much too high on this layout|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 11 opposite 12 not the usual 3N range|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: this is a situation where it would be nice to get the 2@d lead...|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They both have borderline hands and the cards are not friendly|pg||
nt|othered1: This auction could arise with no alerts and make sense on these hands.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Now East can comfortably play low|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, and everything is off|pg||
nt|othered1: if you would open the south hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I would...|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|thegarve:  @s to dummy and West shpould take the @c finnesse with the Ace to make him burn his entries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Homonnay wasn't able to read the lead, so they must lead the 4 from other combinations too|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: perhaps 432|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: which is unfortunate... because it would be valuable to duck the @d|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|thegarve:  plenty of boards to catch the 24 IMPS|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, a spec also just told me that NS are probably playing Walsh here...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: jack with the 10 in dummy|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Pin the ten now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Technically, the original 4th highest is the the right return, but not with the 10 in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't stop playing bridge just because you have certain agreements|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 3@H is going down at least 1|pg||

pc|sT|nt|davidstern: Why is 3@H going down 1-2-1-0|pg||
nt|davidstern: Losers|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes that is a good treatment David|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: you have to lose the 8@h when you try to ruff a @c|pg||
nt|snorris: if n finds @h lead|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: or suffer a trump promotion|pg||

pc|sA|nt|mtvesuvius: It would take more than coffee to get me up anywhere near 715AM :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: How about 3 dogs|pg||

pc|h2|nt|mariner1: not necessarily....... depends on defense.. it can crash on trump pulls.......  3 @H|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||

mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: yes, but he will likely go for the straightforward club finesse|pg||

pc|dT|nt|mariner1: @D lead good for defense|pg||

nt|othered1: I see the @S, but as you pointed out above, unrealistic to get to that position|pg||
nt|thegarve:  that lead gives a big clue that @s are onside|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is an inferior line, so I predict he will go down|pg||
