mb|1C|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Does it count as a yarb if you have the beer card?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: I think the yarb precedes the beer card, so yes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 5@D has no chance|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@H is invitational here.   some might play it as just adding to the preempt|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|othered1: @CA lead, perhaps|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|othered1: That's one way to get to eN|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|othered1: west have some things to think about here, with a hand that could play well in @S.  |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|othered1: Henry Bethe asks if east should convert 6@H to 6N and things he should.  I'm not as convinced|pg||
nt|othered1: thinks he should|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru: 2@D is probably a checkback asking for 3@S or 4@H cards|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|othered1: We'll see this hand in a District 4-Spot bidding competition (which Henry conducts for the ACBL District 4 newsletter)|pg||

mc|9|nt|granguru: The safety play must be made for 2 reasons|pg||
nt|camacho: ths all|pg||
nt|granguru: 1. It is good to win 3N when 6@s goes down because trump is 4-1|pg||
nt|granguru: 2. It ensures the contract 100%..this is a IMPs match..not MPs|pg||
nt|granguru: many kibitzers say that 6@s can be made even with a @C lead...|pg||
nt|granguru: In fact, after a deeper look, I accept that 6S and 6@h are both winner contracts, as the cards lie |pg||
