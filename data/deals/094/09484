nt|mariner1: makes the up trick though|pg||
nt|keylime: and now onto hands where we'll have comparisons|pg||
nt|joest: hello Jack Oest U.S.A.|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like a straightforward major suit game for n/s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|keylime: and, be forewarned, there's some wild ones coming|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: NS in Closed sure like to bid.....|pg||
nt|garnetts: rock solid 4@H here  should be flat|pg||
nt|lestergold: spades are at risk of a heart ruff or two|pg||
mb|r|nt|idc: an icon of someone queueing to buy beers would help to identify dummy, in a meaningful real-life way :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: Not a good hand for bergen raises|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm.  Not my guess.|pg||
nt|calabres: Hi all, please be welcome to the PORTUGUESE GRAND PRIX 2009 - Estoril (Teams). We are in 2nd day of the event, round 5.|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @S migth go down on @H ruff|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: England only 18 behind now, but it's a little too late. Only 2 boards remaining there|pg||
nt|garnetts: I hope that is not a weak two :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: but as a passed hand, North can bid a 4 card good raise 2@d, and stop in 2@s :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|galadriel: They apparently don't play that|pg||
nt|lestergold: well n/smust bid game remains to be seen which one and whetehr or not they make|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well 2cf double vulerable might be worth about a non vul game or so|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|joest: east will do well to run right now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d would be a good bolt hole|pg||
nt|joest: not that it's clear.  It's a guessing game now after the t/o double|pg||
nt|joest: btw, would anyone consider 1NT by West as being for the minors so as to forestall a problem like this?|pg||
nt|bobholl: would be a nice understanding but not realistic imo|pg||
nt|joest: West certainly wants to stop a 2@h rescue if he can |pg||
nt|lestergold: i would not be too happy with north's hand defending a 2 level contract|pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|keylime: B3: partial swing as predicted; six imps for a quiet 2@c partial instead of a push for the need to cash the club ace|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might get too high I suppose--but no good reason to|pg||
nt|chick: a good idea, but not without long discussion|pg||
nt|joest: probably true but I'm not sure that 1NT is natural or should be|pg||
nt|bobholl: bidding 1nt and than redouble migth be a good idea :)|pg||
nt|chthonic: After this auction -- through the redouble -- it might be reasonable to play 1NT as unusual.....|pg||
nt|chthonic: from west|pg||
nt|joest: i agree that the redouble makes all the difference|pg||
nt|lestergold: in 4s its not so easy for the defenc eto find a heart ruff|pg||
nt|joest: I'm sure n-s will happy to take the cash here|pg||
nt|chthonic: sort of a scrambling/unusual bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: east on lead why should he start banging down aces on air?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C will go for 500 i think :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: well so do our NS|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ianrei: if they had stopped in 2S E/W could play their cold 3d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is why Drury was invented. To avoid the 3-level|pg||
nt|lestergold: if the cash is 200 it may not be good enuf|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@ds a transfer and 3@s a superaccept?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|bcallaghan: North - South have got themselves too high.  A bad advertisement for raising to 3 with four trumps.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: how to get out of this now |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mariner1: this time the position is different so 8@H hook was good play|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is enough--hand has already limited and described |pg||
nt|garnetts: Golden rule limit your hand and leave it to partner |pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, 5 isn't safe but makes on this layaout.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chen_xin: Ê¥ÓêÌïÓ®»Ø8imp|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|bcallaghan: 3D is one down I believe.|pg||
nt|ianrei: 3D is -1 if they take their tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|garnetts: If they stop they get lucky |pg||
nt|joest: i think it might be 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: now n/s can only make another three tricks so only 200|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|sybarra: now just hopes hts split|pg||
nt|lestergold: sory 4 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|bjacobs: I don't blame N/S for bidding on.  I wouldn't like to be defending 4@H in the hope that 4 black suit losers stand up|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|garnetts: The think is about how to explian to partner that I should have bid 4@H if this goes off|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c7|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bobholl: tempo for 800 now :)|pg||
nt|joest: cash is good :)|pg||
nt|joest: west gets two more tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: 500 after all |pg||
nt|joest: he only has three now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|keylime: b4: 3NT making six, so the six club slam and excellent play, nets more imps to N-S|pg||
nt|sybarra: right|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: so a push|pg||
nt|joest: north might have pitched hearts there to get the club jack promoted|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cJ|nt|bobholl: wow no 800 now|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s5|nt|garnetts: I imagine west was bored though|pg||
nt|chick: but.... you can't make bridge decisions based on having to defend it later if it goes bad|pg||
nt|joest: needed another heart, then north would have a second chance|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|joest: that blew a tempo|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|s8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hJ|mc|6|nt|bobholl: 2 imp gain no @H ruff in other room|pg||

nt|joest: i don't see how east-west could realistically be expected to find the heart ruff |pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 nt looks reasonable but @H :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|keylime: at the other table, a precision 2@c opener landed N-S into 5@c|pg||
nt|mariner1: and the lead that helped on 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S could be actually bid here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This surely won't be a push|pg||
nt|garnetts: shouldn't maybe but.............  :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 26 combined points hard not to reach n but it does not look at all promising|pg||
nt|joest: many would just blast 3NT right here|pg||
nt|lestergold: perfectly reasonable bid|pg||
nt|joest: i hate responding 3NT to 1@c though|pg||
mb|2C|an|inv minors|nt|keylime: yep, that lead was charitable|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Depends on how large and quick-tempered your teammates are.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|galadriel: Some people play Michaels as either weak or strong..would you call this strong?|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Thought I might see Michaels.  Want to avoid the trump suit that doesn't break though.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this just doesnt make 4   good decision|pg||
nt|bobholl: if east bids 2nt now ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n i assume forcing|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ianrei: he must be regretting not showing the majors a round earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: uh oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: true was wondering 3 can be beaten--maybe not on that lead a trump would have been interesting |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3@S does it this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: i predict a push|pg||
nt|bobholl: still lead @H after this bidding ?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|galadriel: Oh well, he obviously thinks its too strong|pg||
nt|idc: if only the auction had offered a clue that suits were splittling badly|pg||
pc|hA|nt|idc: oh, wait a minute ...|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I play any strength Michaels.  I like to get my shape over early.|pg||
nt|mariner1: DX just took the lead so this should bring it back to 1 imp|pg||
nt|lestergold: likely to be a push will lose the first 5 hearts and still another trick as he does not have 8 tricks without losing the lead|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 3N is out the window|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Even if you don't, it's not too strong vulnerable opposite a passed partner|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ianrei: this hand shows why Brian is right|pg||
nt|ianrei: 800 against a non-making game|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think this is a clasical vul Michaels|pg||
pc|hK|nt|keylime: I am not a fan of redouble here - you have a clear idea of how you want to bid here|pg||
nt|keylime: unless, they are forced to systemically|pg||
pc|h9|nt|galadriel: 2 decent suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Garvey bid Michaels in the other room|pg||
nt|galadriel: and gets your hand over in one bid|pg||
nt|keylime: CR also got to the laydown small slam, but earned an imp by not getting the A@c cashed.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|idc: Hmmm, I seem to be channeling the sarcastic spirit of Sam Leckie|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Garvey managed to avoid doing something strange!|pg||
nt|garnetts: Is is still allowed to play a King and switch to show a singleton?   (rather than the Ace)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I like it at the 4 level and below (if not playing Rusinow).|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: south is kind of squeezed :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there isa double dummy spade pin but that ill never happen|pg||
pc|c2|nt|idc: that in itself counts as strange|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c4|pc|d9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: so is declarer|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: 800 or 1100, matters little|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A club would have yielded 11|pg||
nt|joest: can get out for down one if runs diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: criss cross squeeze|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|bjacobs: Strange line but good enough.  I would have played on diamonds myself|pg||
nt|joest: but i doubt that will happen either :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|idc: it matters for the 100 IMP difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe it still will|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|santyclz: Now he just has to guess the @ds for game, fair vul game.  |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|santyclz: Excuse me, *she* ...|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bobholl: criss cross always easier with 52 cards seen|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s5|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||

nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|joest: this is always embarrassing because you know you should know :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: rigth you are but still thinking :)|pg||

nt|idc: yes, thx Simon|pg||
nt|keylime: this room now about two boards behind|pg||
nt|joest: spade game/reasonable save|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to our excellent commentators: Anne Martin, Ian Crorie, Brian Callaghan and Ian Reissmann|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Thanks everyone :)|pg||

mb|1H|nt|garnetts: I really do not like pass|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Finally, our gratitude to Bridge Great Britain (Sandra Claridge) and the English Bridge Union (Max Bavin and Michael Clark) for bringing this prestigious event to BBO vugraph and ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: inviting us to participate|pg||
nt|santyclz: Different styles.  In the USA many would bid 3@h with n.|pg||
nt|bobholl: by me that's natural :)|pg||
nt|joest: this is a bid I play as natural|pg||
nt|chick: natural for me as well|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: 4@H makes here suprised was not bid in Closed|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have a lot of sympathy with that|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w opted in open to defend 4h doubled fo 100rather than chalk  uop their infranguible spade game |pg||
mb|2S|nt|galadriel: Even the ones about Brian's shape :)|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Thanks everyone.  Looks like I've managed to support the team of destiny here. |pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D not such a good save,,,,,, 4@S can be beat|pg||
nt|santyclz: Are n-s playing a limited opening system?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no clue|pg||
nt|joest: i'm heading to the dictionary|pg||
nt|chick: I figure if you have the other 2 suits, you have X for a good hand and unusual NT for a poor one ... no need for michaels type bids|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|nt|keylime: pressure bid of 4@s and the double was good tactics I felt|pg||
nt|keylime: force the opps to the last guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianrei: thanks to all - been good fun this weekend|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 5@S a phantom too|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @C now :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: so2d micahels and the double of 3h showing a good michaels|pg||
nt|joest: infrangible.  good one!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ianrei: 6C or D on the C position|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|keylime: yep, this is going to get the treatment|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good practical bid by Zou there|pg||
nt|chthonic: Double here only leads to possible misunderstanding|pg||
nt|chthonic: Guess not|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hard for west to value his hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 imp gain :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|keylime: and CR bid and made 6@h for 15 imp swing|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes it was|pg||
pc|h6|nt|idc: team of destiny versus the stone of destiny|pg||
nt|idc: we certainly have sunk like a stone...|pg||
nt|keylime: now the match is much closer|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: 6@D in the CR|pg||
nt|galadriel: Yay!|pg||
nt|joest: if east overcalls 1@s and catches a raise he blasts himself into game|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west showed nothing at all so cant blame east|pg||
nt|chthonic: except for 4-1 spades, six clubs might have made...|pg||
nt|joest: it's often harder to gauge the auction when you make a two-suited bid b/c partner winds up making many decisions|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chthonic: if spades offered two discards and clubs 2-2...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|idc: that'll get it back under 100, phew|pg||
nt|ianrei: 6S only 500|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mariner1: making 5|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1NT can work well actually on this hand type|pg||
nt|chthonic: playing a part score seems a bit timid|pg||

nt|bcallaghan: Good afternoon|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This could be another huge swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes 1400 was not good|pg||
nt|joest: I think pass by north is losing bridge in the long run but that's just my opinion|pg||
nt|lestergold: whre is roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Hello Brian|pg||
nt|keylime: here, a measly 1@s. |pg||
nt|mariner1: 1400 and 1@S  not a balance|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ahhh, now we see the other half of he 2@h bid.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: EW play a multi-way 1@C with transfer responses and a strong NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder what they open with what would be a weak 2 @H|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: N-S modified Polish Club|pg||
nt|galadriel: 2@C was bold|pg||
nt|joest: do east-west play a club system?|pg||
nt|lestergold: does north realise they have a mountain between them?|pg||
nt|chick: S comes to life, they might figure it out yet|pg||
nt|bobholl: vulnarable partner bidding 2 @S :) 4 1/2 @S|pg||
nt|joest: i would bid 4|pg||
nt|joest: or at least cue bid 3@d|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Ian Crorie from Scotland|pg||
nt|idc: Hi all, Roland dredging the bottom of the commentating barrel|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
mb|4S|nt|idc: and I came up...|pg||
nt|lestergold: without hesitation|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N played well in Closed,,, and not even close to finding it here|pg||
nt|bobholl: chickken :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: NS play a very aggressive overcalling style, but they are young and adventurous|pg||
nt|garnetts: My guess is 2@D Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: was thinking same |pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: putting his pard under more pressure especially when he had a takeout double to staqrt with maybenot worlds greatest but he had one  in my book|pg||
nt|lestergold: 12 points and 4 cards in the other major i double|pg||
nt|chick: I think no question N should have made immediately takeout X|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you play ELC he surely had one :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|galadriel: Hello Ian @H|pg||
nt|idc: yes, last one I watched was JTxxx for a non-space consuming 1@d over 1@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I remember the BBO usernames of East and South. Boeles is gnasher and Gillis is Capercliff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bowles|pg||
nt|galadriel: Yes and that got pd off to the wrong lead|pg||
nt|galadriel: that is the danger|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, East found the one disastrous lead: @HQ|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I wouldn't have overcalled myself, but it looks like it stopped EBU from finding the heart fit.|pg||
nt|lestergold: you double because you have to not because you like ur hand|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|keylime: this will net some needed imps for SYT here |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@c show @ds or big hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be |pg||
nt|garnetts: I have seen decs play the ace and pick up the whole suit|pg||
nt|joest: I'll have to remember that one Mike.  I'll use it on my partner next time I enter on some marginal hand and we go for a number :)|pg||
nt|joest: but I already weighed in on behalf of double a while back|pg||
nt|lestergold: true u diod|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: iwas just supporting u because its so important to underline the degree of underbidding here by north |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|joest: so just so I have this straight: 4@s = infrangible|pg||
nt|joest: I like it|pg||
pc|h9|pc|sA|pc|c3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|keylime: declarer's home here |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: the word is lready being rented out to a number of commentators i dont know if you can afford  the rent|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|joest: yeah, I would have doubled in one case and bid 4 in the other.  South did well tocover for north: twice imho|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think we agree|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A lot of if's, but if EBU can hold on to a lead around 40 (21-9), England must win the second half by 50 IMPs against Wales to win the Camrose Trophy. So EBU in a very strong ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: position now that England are 33 IMPs in arrears against Wales|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Not exactly a triumph when Gillis had a normal raise.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North is rawol and West is catch22 on BBO|pg||
nt|keylime: not something you hear normally..."plus 80, gain 16"|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: roland slam here frigid when qs appears and often frigid when they dopnt lead a club|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe too good for a roland|pg||
nt|chthonic: with 3-3 diamonds, this makes six spades without a club lead...|pg||
nt|bobholl: culbertson opening 3 quick tricks :)|pg||
nt|joest: i open|pg||
nt|joest: which isn't saying a lot to be sure|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: another barn burner here|pg||
nt|bobholl: i open 1nt if 12-14 nice hand :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|keylime: CR opened this 1H, preempt raise to 4, got doubled, and they let TWO overtricks pass through. |pg||
nt|santyclz: This is an accident-prone hand.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: not sure where N thought their tricks were vs 4@S in Closed|pg||
nt|keylime: B7: 4@c down 1, but more imps to SYT|pg||
nt|sybarra: blasting into 4 @H?  I thought he would bid |pg||
nt|bobholl: no 6@S now :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|galadriel: This looks like a normal 4@S|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Looks like a diamond lead needed to break a slam.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Pass looks right to me over 1@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I guess as a passed hand ... yikes, off and running|pg||
nt|joest: I'm in a minority who likes to be able to bid 3@s on west's hand there showing extra length and extra vlues|pg||
mb|4C|nt|galadriel: Will E X 5@D bid?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
nt|galadriel: I doubt it too|pg||
nt|lestergold: i open eastit has ak a i have to tell partner about this always in case oppos get frisky so partner can double them otherweise hell never bel;ieve i have three bullets|pg||
mb|d|nt|idc: I was about to say you can have so many sophisticated methods for passed hand raises, 4@S here seems a bit agricultural|pg||
nt|santyclz: If it's right over 1@s, it has to be right over 2@ss.|pg||
nt|chick: I would think at least a negative double (intending to bid hearts later, showing weak hand long suit)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|keylime: East's done well to find a bid and get to a good game bid here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not for my money--I am sure I would bid 3@H now |pg||
nt|calabres: Results at : http://www.freewebs.com/fpbridge/2009_Estoril_Open_Teams_R1.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Luis|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: I'm not sure I'm in love with a 3@d rebid|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Walddk2: What do we know, Anne?|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead and @D swicth needed|pg||
nt|joest: this has induced west, not unreasonably, to think maybe diamonds is a source of tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: but what else P won't have 4@H|pg||
nt|joest: i raise to 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: may be the 2@C cues will win the board :)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|galadriel: Not alot apparently :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well J@C is not the optimum lead|pg||
nt|joest: indeed.  West is screaming for a heart control|pg||
nt|lestergold: this cue bid will prepare then drfence to beat the slam they look like they are headed for|pg||
nt|joest: south's pass of 5@h is big|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean they are leading a club whatever|pg||
mb|6D|nt|idc: I think Gillis has done enough already, 5@h seems like overegging the pudding|pg||
nt|galadriel: Grand slam try froms?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I quite like the initial pass and bidding later if apt |pg||
nt|santyclz: After the opponents have shown no fit?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I don't think I would have found a double at the table. What about you guys and gal?|pg||
nt|bobholl: we would seeing 52 cards :)|pg||
nt|joest: and now the 3@d rebid comes home to roost|pg||
nt|lestergold: well well|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D are 33 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: club club fin ishes this one off|pg||
pc|cA|nt|galadriel: Not me|pg||
nt|galadriel: I have 2 other aces|pg||
pc|c3|nt|idc: not with that @d suit.   Add in 2 side suit Aces and even less chance|pg||
nt|galadriel: Successful here though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Devastating if you are a Scotland supporter|pg||
nt|galadriel: yep|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I thinks Bowles did very well here.  With two side aces either making or not, he tried to get a diamond established.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: interesting|pg||
nt|joest: now another club tapping dummy shuts out the spade suit|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wd by n.|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt matter if he doesnt continue clubs cannot set up spades no entry to enmjoy them|pg||
nt|joest: true|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he will with that Jack|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
pc|cT|nt|idc: he did - to be fair to the dbl of 5@d, he was probably expecting NS to stop in 5@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: could have made both @S |pg||
nt|chick: hmmm, probably thinks he should save the boss trump for later|pg||
nt|lestergold: so this  congtract is headed in prqactice for a few light|pg||
pc|d7|nt|idc: and a diamond lead may well be best against that|pg||
pc|c2|nt|galadriel: That's a good point|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, he did not envisage a slam to be bid, did he?|pg||
nt|joest: this was is not infrangible; it's inelegant|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@S is somewhat better then 50%|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|joest: this one|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: I can hear N's groan |pg||
pc|d9|nt|chick: *partner frowns*|pg||

nt|calabres: The bid who disrupt all auction was th horrible 3@D|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6d is even below the roland threshhold surely and whenever its making so is 6s |pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Hoping to ruff out @CK, but no such luck. Besides, he is pretty short of entries anyway|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: He also needs to lead a heart up|pg||
nt|sybarra: remaining under control per Isabel|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|joest: he's going to play spades from the top and go three light|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|bobholl: 6@S is not that bad i guess around 57% (40% for 22) 17% from bare @S Q |pg||

mb|3D!|an|undetermined splinter|nt|idc: yes - but always tough to bid a good slam when you have just bid a .... less than good one|pg||

mb|d|nt|mariner1: 4@S does not play well too much off|pg||
nt|keylime: comparisons I meant|pg||
nt|lestergold: its what happens after the pslinter which is interesting|pg||
nt|joest: it's very important to have limited ranges on your splinters.  If you don't East can get too excited.  Or even worst the splinterer might come again at the five level and wind up ...|pg||
nt|joest: going down|pg||
nt|bobholl: not discussed what pass now means :)|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|chick: I think it's a guess ... as Joe says you need 2 honors onside, but which two you can't tell, so mentally flip a coin for the 9 or J|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|galadriel: 11 even|pg||

nt|santyclz: Since it doesn't matter, take the play that gains if all 3 are on side.|pg||
mb|r|mb|2S|nt|keylime: the dummy is not much of comfort for declarer - the heart suit is a lacking of a fourth trump a potential bother|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would have doubled directly (lower level lesser risk after pass )|pg||
nt|mcarroll: nice balancing dbl|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mariner1: how to play the @S......  normally one thinks S has more dues to 3@D call|pg||
nt|chick: that's a good thought :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: yes as a passed hand, you wouldn't be overstating your values by doubling on the prior round|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: and of course he needs to ruff out the @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: i know e/w are not vulnerable but i feel east had done en uf on his 4 count|pg||
pc|cK|nt|santyclz: Sometimes the glass *is* half full.|pg||

nt|lestergold: my law of total tricks says that 4 points plus a minimum opening bid does not generally produce 9 total tricks|pg||

nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|chthonic: No, it is not related to having points.|pg||
nt|joest: south swung the ace of diamonds|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|bcallaghan: I would have tried to get to 2C with the South hand.  Maybe it's Stayman.|pg||
nt|idc: in 1NT doubled, even more fun - East leads a small @d, later run of diamonds puts West hand under some pressure|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I think top diamond lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: And to our specs,-- greatest audience in the world.  We appreciate you comments and thoughts|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nah bob  1 down|pg||
nt|bobholl: still 2@S a@C 2@D |pg||

mb|p|nt|keylime: as we finish up, we wish to thank the CCBA and the Shenyang Bridge Association for this event|pg||
nt|joest: cash is still just as good now as it was on board 9 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Right, they could easily be running|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And if not, still hope that @SK is an entry|pg||
nt|idc: true, but that takes away the fun, just a boring -1 i think|pg||
nt|mariner1: many thanks to all the organizers and sponsors, the CBF and all for helping BBO|pg||

pc|h6|nt|bcallaghan: West may still be squeezed.|pg||
nt|idc: looks like SOuth could pass to get a forced XX, then run to 2@c to show 5|pg||
nt|idc: no idea either why he didn't|pg||
nt|keylime: to Roland our fearless leader of all things vugraph|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|bcallaghan: Provided declarer plays spades - one down.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Strange..partners don't like it when you squeeze them...and like it less when you endplay them!|pg||
nt|mariner1: we end on what appears to be a quiet board...........|pg||
pc|cK|nt|idc: I suppose 4 hcp opposite 15-17, gamble on it making isn't so weird, down in the match etc|pg||
nt|keylime: they capitalized on a lot of errors,and for the most part stayed out of trouble|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
