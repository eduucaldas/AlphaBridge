nt|mariner1: makes the up trick though|pg||
nt|keylime: and now onto hands where we'll have comparisons|pg||
nt|joest: hello Jack Oest U.S.A.|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like a straightforward major suit game for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: and, be forewarned, there's some wild ones coming|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: NS in Closed sure like to bid.....|pg||
nt|garnetts: rock solid 4@H here  should be flat|pg||
nt|lestergold: spades are at risk of a heart ruff or two|pg||
mb|1S|nt|idc: an icon of someone queueing to buy beers would help to identify dummy, in a meaningful real-life way :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: Not a good hand for bergen raises|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm.  Not my guess.|pg||
nt|calabres: Hi all, please be welcome to the PORTUGUESE GRAND PRIX 2009 - Estoril (Teams). We are in 2nd day of the event, round 5.|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @S migth go down on @H ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: England only 18 behind now, but it's a little too late. Only 2 boards remaining there|pg||
nt|garnetts: I hope that is not a weak two :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.  Hi Cornelia.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Cornelia, Mike and Joe|pg||
mb|d|nt|idc: but as a passed hand, North can bid a 4 card good raise 2@d, and stop in 2@s :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi all from famous transatlantic alliance A commentating team of Mike here and Chick|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|galadriel: They apparently don't play that|pg||
nt|lestergold: well n/smust bid game remains to be seen which one and whetehr or not they make|pg||
nt|chick: and Joe :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well 2cf double vulerable might be worth about a non vul game or so|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|joest: east will do well to run right now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d would be a good bolt hole|pg||
nt|joest: not that it's clear.  It's a guessing game now after the t/o double|pg||
nt|joest: btw, would anyone consider 1NT by West as being for the minors so as to forestall a problem like this?|pg||
nt|bobholl: would be a nice understanding but not realistic imo|pg||
nt|joest: West certainly wants to stop a 2@h rescue if he can |pg||
nt|lestergold: i would not be too happy with north's hand defending a 2 level contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and Joe too .... wow|pg||
nt|santyclz: Somebody has to do the comedy relief.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|keylime: B3: partial swing as predicted; six imps for a quiet 2@c partial instead of a push for the need to cash the club ace|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might get too high I suppose--but no good reason to|pg||
nt|chick: a good idea, but not without long discussion|pg||
nt|joest: probably true but I'm not sure that 1NT is natural or should be|pg||
nt|bobholl: bidding 1nt and than redouble migth be a good idea :)|pg||
nt|chthonic: After this auction -- through the redouble -- it might be reasonable to play 1NT as unusual.....|pg||
nt|chthonic: from west|pg||
nt|joest: i agree that the redouble makes all the difference|pg||
nt|lestergold: in 4s its not so easy for the defenc eto find a heart ruff|pg||
nt|joest: I'm sure n-s will happy to take the cash here|pg||
nt|chthonic: sort of a scrambling/unusual bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: east on lead why should he start banging down aces on air?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C will go for 500 i think :)|pg||
nt|chick: close game here, might make it if he can get a heart pitched on the @DK|pg||
nt|lestergold: me im always so serious|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: well so do our NS|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ianrei: if they had stopped in 2S E/W could play their cold 3d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is why Drury was invented. To avoid the 3-level|pg||
nt|lestergold: if the cash is 200 it may not be good enuf|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@ds a transfer and 3@s a superaccept?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|bcallaghan: North - South have got themselves too high.  A bad advertisement for raising to 3 with four trumps.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: how to get out of this now |pg||
nt|lestergold: will do cos east has spade ace|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mariner1: this time the position is different so 8@H hook was good play|pg||
nt|lestergold: patrick ill not take club finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wager u|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is enough--hand has already limited and described |pg||
nt|garnetts: Golden rule limit your hand and leave it to partner |pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, 5 isn't safe but makes on this layaout.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chen_xin: Ê¥ÓêÌïÓ®»Ø8imp|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sT|nt|bcallaghan: 3D is one down I believe.|pg||
nt|ianrei: 3D is -1 if they take their tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|garnetts: If they stop they get lucky |pg||
nt|joest: i think it might be 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: now n/s can only make another three tricks so only 200|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: 4 made only off on heart lead which incidentally was marked on the takeout double|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|sybarra: now just hopes hts split|pg||
nt|lestergold: sory 4 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: good play, can afford to lose the @CK if avoiding a heart loser|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|bjacobs: I don't blame N/S for bidding on.  I wouldn't like to be defending 4@H in the hope that 4 black suit losers stand up|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|garnetts: The think is about how to explian to partner that I should have bid 4@H if this goes off|pg||
mc|10|nt|chick: Our vugraph operator today is Isabel Correia :)|pg||

nt|joest: i don't see how east-west could realistically be expected to find the heart ruff |pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 nt looks reasonable but @H :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|keylime: at the other table, a precision 2@c opener landed N-S into 5@c|pg||
nt|mariner1: and the lead that helped on 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@S could be actually bid here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This surely won't be a push|pg||
nt|garnetts: shouldn't maybe but.............  :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 26 combined points hard not to reach n but it does not look at all promising|pg||
nt|joest: many would just blast 3NT right here|pg||
nt|lestergold: perfectly reasonable bid|pg||
nt|joest: i hate responding 3NT to 1@c though|pg||
mb|2C|nt|keylime: yep, that lead was charitable|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Depends on how large and quick-tempered your teammates are.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|galadriel: Some people play Michaels as either weak or strong..would you call this strong?|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Thought I might see Michaels.  Want to avoid the trump suit that doesn't break though.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: infrangible 3b here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this just doesnt make 4   good decision|pg||
nt|bobholl: if east bids 2nt now ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n i assume forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianrei: he must be regretting not showing the majors a round earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: uh oh|pg||
nt|chick: one of these days, I need to find a word like that of my own :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: true was wondering 3 can be beaten--maybe not on that lead a trump would have been interesting |pg||
nt|lestergold: make one up Chick|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mariner1: 3@S does it this time|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those interesting in purchasing the rights to the word "infrangible", Mike is running a special this week.|pg||
nt|lestergold: who ll know difference|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: i predict a push|pg||
nt|bobholl: still lead @H after this bidding ?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|galadriel: Oh well, he obviously thinks its too strong|pg||
nt|idc: if only the auction had offered a clue that suits were splittling badly|pg||
pc|s9|nt|idc: oh, wait a minute ...|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I play any strength Michaels.  I like to get my shape over early.|pg||
nt|mariner1: DX just took the lead so this should bring it back to 1 imp|pg||
nt|lestergold: likely to be a push will lose the first 5 hearts and still another trick as he does not have 8 tricks without losing the lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: well 3N is out the window|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if you don't, it's not too strong vulnerable opposite a passed partner|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|ianrei: this hand shows why Brian is right|pg||
nt|ianrei: 800 against a non-making game|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think this is a clasical vul Michaels|pg||
pc|cK|nt|keylime: I am not a fan of redouble here - you have a clear idea of how you want to bid here|pg||
nt|keylime: unless, they are forced to systemically|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|galadriel: 2 decent suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Garvey bid Michaels in the other room|pg||
nt|galadriel: and gets your hand over in one bid|pg||
nt|keylime: CR also got to the laydown small slam, but earned an imp by not getting the A@c cashed.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|idc: Hmmm, I seem to be channeling the sarcastic spirit of Sam Leckie|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bcallaghan: Garvey managed to avoid doing something strange!|pg||
nt|garnetts: Is is still allowed to play a King and switch to show a singleton?   (rather than the Ace)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I like it at the 4 level and below (if not playing Rusinow).|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobholl: south is kind of squeezed :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there isa double dummy spade pin but that ill never happen|pg||
nt|lestergold: how about 'undefenstratable'|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|idc: that in itself counts as strange|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: meaning it cant be thrown out of the window|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: so is declarer|pg||
nt|santyclz: Too fat to fit through the window?|pg||
nt|lestergold: the word or me?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: 800 or 1100, matters little|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: A club would have yielded 11|pg||
nt|joest: can get out for down one if runs diamonds|pg||
nt|joest: criss cross squeeze|pg||
nt|santyclz: My guess at the definition of your word.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Strange line but good enough.  I would have played on diamonds myself|pg||
nt|joest: but i doubt that will happen either :)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d3|pc|s4|nt|lestergold: icy|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean i see not the contract is icy|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|idc: it matters for the 100 IMP difference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe it still will|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d9|nt|santyclz: Now he just has to guess the @ds for game, fair vul game.  |pg||
nt|chick: maybe I'll just use plain english after all :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Excuse me, *she* ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: icy shoprter than infrangible|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|bobholl: criss cross always easier with 52 cards seen|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
mc|9|nt|santyclz: There's one for you, |pg||

nt|idc: yes, thx Simon|pg||
nt|keylime: this room now about two boards behind|pg||
nt|joest: spade game/reasonable save|pg||
nt|santyclz: Just come up with a definition for shoprter.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to our excellent commentators: Anne Martin, Ian Crorie, Brian Callaghan and Ian Reissmann|pg||
nt|lestergold: shoprter is short for shoplifter|pg||

nt|galadriel: Especially to specs for all your helpful comments:)|pg||

mb|1N|nt|garnetts: I really do not like pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Finally, our gratitude to Bridge Great Britain (Sandra Claridge) and the English Bridge Union (Max Bavin and Michael Clark) for bringing this prestigious event to BBO vugraph and ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: inviting us to participate|pg||
nt|santyclz: Different styles.  In the USA many would bid 3@h with n.|pg||
nt|bobholl: by me that's natural :)|pg||
nt|joest: this is a bid I play as natural|pg||
nt|chick: natural for me as well|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mariner1: 4@H makes here suprised was not bid in Closed|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have a lot of sympathy with that|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w opted in open to defend 4h doubled fo 100rather than chalk  uop their infranguible spade game |pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Even the ones about Brian's shape :)|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Thanks everyone.  Looks like I've managed to support the team of destiny here. |pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D not such a good save,,,,,, 4@S can be beat|pg||
nt|santyclz: Are n-s playing a limited opening system?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no clue|pg||
nt|joest: i'm heading to the dictionary|pg||
nt|chick: I figure if you have the other 2 suits, you have X for a good hand and unusual NT for a poor one ... no need for michaels type bids|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|keylime: pressure bid of 4@s and the double was good tactics I felt|pg||
nt|keylime: force the opps to the last guess|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ianrei: thanks to all - been good fun this weekend|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 5@S a phantom too|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @C now :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: so2d micahels and the double of 3h showing a good michaels|pg||
nt|joest: infrangible.  good one!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianrei: 6C or D on the C position|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes too|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume that n/s are playing strong n/t and kendrick has upgraded|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|keylime: yep, this is going to get the treatment|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good practical bid by Zou there|pg||
nt|chthonic: Double here only leads to possible misunderstanding|pg||
nt|chthonic: Guess not|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: hard for west to value his hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 imp gain :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: it may be an upgrade too far here|pg||
nt|chick: that's a pretty hefty upgrade on 13 hcp|pg||
pc|d6|nt|keylime: and CR bid and made 6@h for 15 imp swing|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes it was|pg||
pc|dK|nt|idc: team of destiny versus the stone of destiny|pg||
nt|idc: we certainly have sunk like a stone...|pg||
nt|keylime: now the match is much closer|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D in the CR|pg||
nt|galadriel: Yay!|pg||
nt|joest: if east overcalls 1@s and catches a raise he blasts himself into game|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: but west showed nothing at all so cant blame east|pg||
nt|chthonic: except for 4-1 spades, six clubs might have made...|pg||
nt|joest: it's often harder to gauge the auction when you make a two-suited bid b/c partner winds up making many decisions|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chthonic: if spades offered two discards and clubs 2-2...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|idc: that'll get it back under 100, phew|pg||
nt|ianrei: 6S only 500|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mariner1: making 5|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1NT can work well actually on this hand type|pg||
nt|chthonic: playing a part score seems a bit timid|pg||
nt|calabres: Link for Results at : http://www.freewebs.com/fpbridge/2009_Estoril_Open_Teams_R4.pdf|pg||
nt|bobholl: drop @D :)|pg||
nt|joest: but it's going to pick up some imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: at some point patrick will finesse the club into the doubleton queen and roof will fall in|pg||
pc|d4|nt|keylime: this will be 300 going the wrong way here|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is 8 or 11 imps|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|santyclz: That would be my choice, I'm not lawful enough.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well patrick wouldnt make a game invite with only two aces opposite a weak no gtrump|pg||

nt|santyclz: I've been trying to come up with any excuse for not taking the @c finesse, but was unable to.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|garnetts: passing out 1@H looked right from East's perspective--was scared of spades I think|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Vugraph every day next week (sigh) :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Bye for now|pg||
nt|ianrei: bye all|pg||

nt|lestergold: with no e/w bidding that would be ahard theory to come up wioth|pg||
nt|chick: I'm pretty boring ... I stick to 15-17 and upgrade after I find out what my partner has :)|pg||

nt|keylime: that hurts|pg||
nt|keylime: N-S having enough of the play to feel decent, until that hand|pg||
nt|keylime: and here's one of the wild boards|pg||
nt|keylime: in the CR:|pg||
nt|bobholl: we are having much more compares thatn the other room nice :)|pg||

nt|calabres: Link for Results after R7 : http://www.freewebs.com/fpbridge/2009_Estoril_Open_Teams_R7.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Partner's with no sense of humor can be tiresome.|pg||
nt|lestergold: no heart lead and jd with east and dims are se up to get rid of heart losers |pg||
nt|bobholl: a very good one to boot :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|galadriel: Were doing very well up till then|pg||
nt|keylime: and N-S got into it and got smacked around firmly|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT has issues |pg||
nt|lestergold: not a fighting chicken tho on this occasion|pg||
nt|joest: the perfect moment|pg||
mb|1N|nt|galadriel: Still time to recover in this match|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Brain Callaghan from England|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Brian  sorry|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Good afternoon|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This could be another huge swing|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe n/sin trouble here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes 1400 was not good|pg||
nt|joest: I think pass by north is losing bridge in the long run but that's just my opinion|pg||
nt|lestergold: whre is roland|pg||
nt|santyclz: A well deserved minus after n's foolhardy 1nt.  (If it had made it would have been a well earned plus after n's tactical 1nt.)|pg||
nt|lestergold: if east trusts his pards double|pg||
nt|chick: the victors write the history :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Hello Brian|pg||
nt|keylime: here, a measly 1@s. |pg||
nt|mariner1: 1400 and 1@S  not a balance|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ahhh, now we see the other half of he 2@h bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: EW play a multi-way 1@C with transfer responses and a strong NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder what they open with what would be a weak 2 @H|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Luis.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: N-S modified Polish Club|pg||
nt|galadriel: 2@C was bold|pg||
nt|joest: do east-west play a club system?|pg||
nt|lestergold: does north realise they have a mountain between them?|pg||
nt|chick: S comes to life, they might figure it out yet|pg||
nt|bobholl: vulnarable partner bidding 2 @S :) 4 1/2 @S|pg||
nt|joest: i would bid 4|pg||
nt|joest: or at least cue bid 3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s have been dealt only 4 tricks that i can see buty onje will probably arise in the weash|pg||
nt|calabres: wlc Joe|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart pips may produce that fifth trick|pg||

pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Ian Crorie from Scotland|pg||
nt|idc: Hi all, Roland dredging the bottom of the commentating barrel|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless this is repeated in the open room , this could be a fair gain for the local team|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps the double will help him ... for example a low club to the 10 brings in 2 club tricks (as the cards lie)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|idc: and I came up...|pg||
nt|lestergold: without hesitation|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|mariner1: 3N played well in Closed,,, and not even close to finding it here|pg||
nt|bobholl: chickken :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|galadriel: NS play a very aggressive overcalling style, but they are young and adventurous|pg||
nt|garnetts: My guess is 2@D Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: was thinking same |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: putting his pard under more pressure especially when he had a takeout double to staqrt with maybenot worlds greatest but he had one  in my book|pg||
nt|lestergold: 12 points and 4 cards in the other major i double|pg||
nt|chick: I think no question N should have made immediately takeout X|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you play ELC he surely had one :)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|galadriel: Hello Ian @H|pg||
nt|idc: yes, last one I watched was JTxxx for a non-space consuming 1@d over 1@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I remember the BBO usernames of East and South. Boeles is gnasher and Gillis is Capercliff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bowles|pg||
nt|galadriel: Yes and that got pd off to the wrong lead|pg||
nt|galadriel: that is the danger|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, East found the one disastrous lead: @HQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bcallaghan: I wouldn't have overcalled myself, but it looks like it stopped EBU from finding the heart fit.|pg||
nt|lestergold: you double because you have to not because you like ur hand|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s4|nt|keylime: this will net some needed imps for SYT here |pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: well 2 cl 2h and 2d will be  tricks but e/wwill make 8 tricks before that|pg||
pc|sT|nt|santyclz: 2@c show @ds or big hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be |pg||
nt|garnetts: I have seen decs play the ace and pick up the whole suit|pg||
nt|joest: I'll have to remember that one Mike.  I'll use it on my partner next time I enter on some marginal hand and we go for a number :)|pg||
nt|joest: but I already weighed in on behalf of double a while back|pg||
nt|lestergold: true u diod|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: iwas just supporting u because its so important to underline the degree of underbidding here by north |pg||
pc|s3|nt|joest: so just so I have this straight: 4@s = infrangible|pg||
nt|joest: I like it|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 2nd @h was fatal to -3.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s7|nt|keylime: declarer's home here |pg||
nt|lestergold: tempo not looking good fro declarer 500 or 800 maybe|pg||
nt|santyclz: He should be able to get out for 500 now.  W needed to get @ds started.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: declarer is squeezed in a way if he discards dim then east can exit with a dim safely and declarer is behind declarer needs his clubs and hearts obviously |pg||
nt|lestergold: east may misdefend of course and play heart|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: the word is lready being rented out to a number of commentators i dont know if you can afford  the rent|pg||
nt|lestergold: now surely dim exit|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|lestergold: error|pg||
pc|c5|nt|joest: yeah, I would have doubled in one case and bid 4 in the other.  South did well tocover for north: twice imho|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A lot of if's, but if EBU can hold on to a lead around 40 (21-9), England must win the second half by 50 IMPs against Wales to win the Camrose Trophy. So EBU in a very strong ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: position now that England are 33 IMPs in arrears against Wales|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Not exactly a triumph when Gillis had a normal raise.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North is rawol and West is catch22 on BBO|pg||
nt|keylime: not something you hear normally..."plus 80, gain 16"|pg||
nt|lestergold: i always say that 1n is the most diffiult contract to defend|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: roland slam here frigid when qs appears and often frigid when they dopnt lead a club|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe too good for a roland|pg||
nt|chthonic: with 3-3 diamonds, this makes six spades without a club lead...|pg||
nt|bobholl: culbertson opening 3 quick tricks :)|pg||
nt|joest: i open|pg||
nt|joest: which isn't saying a lot to be sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: another barn burner here|pg||
nt|bobholl: i open 1nt if 12-14 nice hand :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: CR opened this 1H, preempt raise to 4, got doubled, and they let TWO overtricks pass through. |pg||
nt|santyclz: This is an accident-prone hand.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: not sure where N thought their tricks were vs 4@S in Closed|pg||
nt|keylime: B7: 4@c down 1, but more imps to SYT|pg||
nt|sybarra: blasting into 4 @H?  I thought he would bid |pg||
nt|bobholl: no 6@S now :)|pg||
nt|chick: 1N is my favorite contract to play |pg||
mb|2C|an|drury|nt|galadriel: This looks like a normal 4@S|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Looks like a diamond lead needed to break a slam.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Pass looks right to me over 1@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I guess as a passed hand ... yikes, off and running|pg||
nt|joest: I'm in a minority who likes to be able to bid 3@s on west's hand there showing extra length and extra vlues|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s easy make every card right|pg||
mb|2N|an|trial bid|nt|galadriel: Will E X 5@D bid?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
nt|galadriel: I doubt it too|pg||
nt|lestergold: i open eastit has ak a i have to tell partner about this always in case oppos get frisky so partner can double them otherweise hell never bel;ieve i have three bullets|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes cosyou can play it badly chick knowing the defenders will defend it even worse!!!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Redoubled, just to make it interesting.|pg||
nt|chick: that's the best kind for me to play, where the opps make a lot of mistakes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I was about to say you can have so many sophisticated methods for passed hand raises, 4@S here seems a bit agricultural|pg||
nt|santyclz: If it's right over 1@s, it has to be right over 2@ss.|pg||
nt|chick: I would think at least a negative double (intending to bid hearts later, showing weak hand long suit)|pg||
mb|3H|an|values|nt|keylime: East's done well to find a bid and get to a good game bid here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not for my money--I am sure I would bid 3@H now |pg||
nt|calabres: Results at : http://www.freewebs.com/fpbridge/2009_Estoril_Open_Teams_R1.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Luis|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: I'm not sure I'm in love with a 3@d rebid|pg||
nt|lestergold: not automatic to bid game on these cards but theyll be sorry if gtehy dont|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: What do we know, Anne?|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead and @D swicth needed|pg||
nt|joest: this has induced west, not unreasonably, to think maybe diamonds is a source of tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: but what else P won't have 4@H|pg||
nt|joest: i raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n an appaling spot iof thats where they play but cant fil today|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant fail today|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: may be the 2@C cues will win the board :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|galadriel: Not alot apparently :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well J@C is not the optimum lead|pg||
nt|joest: indeed.  West is screaming for a heart control|pg||
nt|lestergold: this cue bid will prepare then drfence to beat the slam they look like they are headed for|pg||
nt|joest: south's pass of 5@h is big|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean they are leading a club whatever|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I think Gillis has done enough already, 5@h seems like overegging the pudding|pg||
nt|galadriel: Grand slam try froms?|pg||
nt|lestergold: no they are in the sensible spot of 4s but all three agmes infrangible tody|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I quite like the initial pass and bidding later if apt |pg||
nt|santyclz: After the opponents have shown no fit?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: I don't think I would have found a double at the table. What about you guys and gal?|pg||
nt|bobholl: we would seeing 52 cards :)|pg||
nt|joest: and now the 3@d rebid comes home to roost|pg||
nt|lestergold: well well|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D are 33 :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: club club fin ishes this one off|pg||
pc|s2|nt|galadriel: Not me|pg||
nt|galadriel: I have 2 other aces|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|idc: not with that @d suit.   Add in 2 side suit Aces and even less chance|pg||
nt|galadriel: Successful here though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Devastating if you are a Scotland supporter|pg||
nt|galadriel: yep|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I thinks Bowles did very well here.  With two side aces either making or not, he tried to get a diamond established.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: interesting|pg||
nt|joest: now another club tapping dummy shuts out the spade suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: Don't remember when I've seen so many cards well placed.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|santyclz: Wd by n.|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt matter if he doesnt continue clubs cannot set up spades no entry to enmjoy them|pg||
nt|joest: true|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he will with that Jack|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true|pg||
pc|s6|nt|idc: he did - to be fair to the dbl of 5@d, he was probably expecting NS to stop in 5@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: could have made both @S |pg||
nt|chick: hmmm, probably thinks he should save the boss trump for later|pg||
nt|lestergold: so this  congtract is headed in prqactice for a few light|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|idc: and a diamond lead may well be best against that|pg||
pc|s8|nt|galadriel: That's a good point|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Yes, he did not envisage a slam to be bid, did he?|pg||
nt|joest: this was is not infrangible; it's inelegant|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@S is somewhat better then 50%|pg||
pc|sA|nt|joest: this one|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: I can hear N's groan |pg||
nt|lestergold: Martin Garvey is floating around|pg||

nt|lestergold: he is almost as hilarious as you Chick|pg||

pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: He also needs to lead a heart up|pg||

nt|keylime: comparisons I meant|pg||
nt|lestergold: its what happens after the pslinter which is interesting|pg||
nt|joest: it's very important to have limited ranges on your splinters.  If you don't East can get too excited.  Or even worst the splinterer might come again at the five level and wind up ...|pg||
nt|joest: going down|pg||
nt|bobholl: not discussed what pass now means :)|pg||

pc|h8|nt|bcallaghan: Presumably 4C a cue.  Maybe 3H a genral slam try in spades works better.  Don't know their methods.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree Brian, and let 4m be a splinter|pg||
nt|sybarra: just guess the @D's for one loser |pg||
nt|santyclz: I see 8, doesn't anyone see a 9th?|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H's come home |pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think kelsy and ottlik would have written about these adventures|pg||
pc|h5|nt|idc: i expect you are right Brian - if 4@c were a splinter, the South hand has improved, if not, I prefer his 4@s signoff|pg||
nt|keylime: this hand is down off the hope a bunch on the heart lead|pg||
nt|keylime: at least one that I see, likely two|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz: Yes, would be a bad hand for udca on the @c lead.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Finally some IMPs to Scotland. Must be your presence, Ian|pg||
nt|idc: though trumps are so good I might go for 4@h amyway|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: The main danger was that trumps weren't solid enough.  Not sure they addressed that, but OK here.  |pg||
nt|idc: thx Roland but the reality is once I start talking about bridge, the other Scottish players just *seem* better :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think N just decided he was going to be in slam when his pd showed a @S fit, and to be fair, he does have a nice hand|pg||
nt|idc: Interesting auction in other room - transfer to @s and then a forcing 3@s bid by North|pg||
nt|idc: (they transfer with 4+ suits on some hand types) - presumably that invited South to cue but he didn't, and 4@s it was|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: That diamond again, says Gillis to himself|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Presumably, in the other room, 4S meant somethin.  Good trumps?  Otherwise 3NT an alternative.|pg||
nt|garnetts: well the spades do let you get two tricks --not that you would look for them--but too slow anyway|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: Kendrisk wants to avoid losing more than one diamond|pg||
pc|h9|nt|idc: would be good to know what 4@s meant - if good trumps North really should go on, if min and not interested ... well, North still might try|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he a small chance however line is not likely|pg||
nt|keylime: wow. did that just happen?|pg||
nt|keylime: I think declarer's got half a play for this now|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h3|nt|garnetts: @D to the 9 looks normal|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: 300 may be a good score|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1010 with give Scotland another imp|pg||
nt|idc: Was it John Matheson?|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: On top club lead might be 1010.|pg||
nt|idc: If so, someone should tell him 1978 is over now and he can start bidding them again|pg||
nt|keylime: N-S has had much of the play this match,and the score is showing, along with very active biddings in the CR|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of the session........ next session in 26 minutes|pg||
nt|garnetts: Nasty splits here--|pg||
nt|joest: Madeira is a Portuguese wine am I right?|pg||
nt|joest: I'm told yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Operator, you sure he did not make them all?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he did, I'll give you the code for correction|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Sorry, does look like it should be 1010 in any case.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: He claimed 12 ... they are discussing it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: E-W should give him one more|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Not if he thought his diamond suit was good.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The code is  6SS+1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Click on MOVIE, highlight 30 and overwrite|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
mb|p|nt|calabres: Yes, cause Madeira is an Portuguese Island:):)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bcallaghan: Vulnerable 5C save on this board.|pg||
nt|galadriel: I froze when we gained 10 imps!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S was bid in the OR and drifted two off--seems likely to be repeated |pg||
nt|joest: and it's in the evening over there right?|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chick: anyone open the S hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 11 tricks in clubs in open but should only be ten tricks here no game|pg||
nt|santyclz: Surprised there is anyone who doesn't these days.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chick: I think it's a guess ... as Joe says you need 2 honors onside, but which two you can't tell, so mentally flip a coin for the 9 or J|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 11|pg||
nt|lestergold: automatic i would have thought but patrick is a senior tory|pg||
nt|chick: now N thinks partner has longer spades, weaker hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: too right Chick|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3s thye limit for them|pg||
nt|santyclz: Fit jump?|pg||
nt|lestergold: kendrick will pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|galadriel: 11 even|pg||
nt|lestergold: troubloe is kendrick would have passed with a slightly better hand when game was on|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: this is a brutal hand |pg||
nt|santyclz: Since it doesn't matter, take the play that gains if all 3 are on side.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: e/wat green have sopld out prematurely|pg||
pc|c2|nt|keylime: the dummy is not much of comfort for declarer - the heart suit is a lacking of a fourth trump a potential bother|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would have doubled directly (lower level lesser risk after pass )|pg||
nt|mcarroll: nice balancing dbl|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mariner1: how to play the @S......  normally one thinks S has more dues to 3@D call|pg||
nt|chick: that's a good thought :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|garnetts: true|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|joest: yes as a passed hand, you wouldn't be overstating your values by doubling on the prior round|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: and of course he needs to ruff out the @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: i know e/w are not vulnerable but i feel east had done en uf on his 4 count|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|santyclz: Sometimes the glass *is* half full.|pg||
nt|chick: this looks to be down at least 1, maybe 2|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am not sure I like 4@D  unless it showed 5/5|pg||
nt|santyclz: Does everyone play negative x's on that auction?|pg||
nt|garnetts: double for takeout maybe|pg||
nt|santyclz: If not, 4@d is kind of forced.|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H forcing?|pg||
nt|joest: but THE LAW commands it! :)|pg||
nt|chick: why risk pushing them to a makeable game? :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: certainly the jump to 3s put west under a lot of pressure too much to bear including the fear that a 4c bid may have driven n/s into a makeable vulnerable game|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|mcarroll: the law is an as??s|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|idc: understandable doubles from NS but they won't get rich from them|pg||
pc|sK|nt|joest: the law of total tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: as these cards lie 3s may well be off as e/w have the forcing tempo|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: If that wouldn't either show 6 nor deny @ss, then y.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|joest: but yes I know your phrase|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: we know which loawe u are referring to Jack!|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|garnetts: Odd result on the last hand in the OR played in 1@D making 10 tricks |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|d4|nt|idc: Interesting 1@h overcall from Howard - when you play very agressive style, that hand is too good/defensive for a weak jump at these colours|pg||
nt|lestergold: patrick cant draw trump without losing control|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mariner1: averaging 8 imps a board so far..........|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer's getting frisky here|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobholl: now it may pay off :)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h4|nt|keylime: and dodges a bullet.|pg||
nt|lestergold: my law of total tricks says that 4 points plus a minimum opening bid does not generally produce 9 total tricks|pg||
nt|joest: actually at these colors you get a good score for 3@h at matchpoints if they don't find the double|pg||
nt|chick: the LoTT does not say it will|pg||
nt|lestergold: Chick i know the law im just failing to be funny|pg||
nt|chick: it says that if it doesn't, the opponents have more|pg||
nt|chick: ookkkaaayyyyyyyy :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: But will it matter with e pitching all the @cs.  Still only -1.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: as lone spec says the la is about when you have about half the deck|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe west with 5 spades even tho small should not have been that scared of a spade game|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|idc: so I'm with his 1@h - in a different partnership, it would be a 2@h bid|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h5|pc|c8|pc|d8|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wd,|pg||
pc|cT|pc|hJ|nt|keylime: and now is down in a somewhat tricky but makeable contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: and still the average continues|pg||
nt|keylime: I think you have to assume the best there - 3/2 trumps and clubs not adverse|pg||
nt|chick: E probably expected longer spades too, and didn't imagine the forcing would work|pg||

nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Unknown (China), our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|chthonic: No, it is not related to having points.|pg||

mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|lestergold: well nm/s overboard in open|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bcallaghan: I would have tried to get to 2C with the South hand.  Maybe it's Stayman.|pg||
nt|idc: in 1NT doubled, even more fun - East leads a small @d, later run of diamonds puts West hand under some pressure|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I think top diamond lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: And to our specs,-- greatest audience in the world.  We appreciate you comments and thoughts|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Nah bob  1 down|pg||
nt|bobholl: still 2@S a@C 2@D |pg||

mb|p|nt|keylime: as we finish up, we wish to thank the CCBA and the Shenyang Bridge Association for this event|pg||
