mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahh: south hand is massive on this start |pg||
nt|mariner1: well 7 might be hard to find|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Once North opens, it's hard to stop South|pg||
nt|ahh: not really |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Would you all have opened the North hand? They did in both rooms|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ahh: n has at least 10 red cards |pg||
nt|mariner1: normally I would not have|pg||
nt|dburn: South in the other room adopted a good approach - once North did not cue bid a black suit control over 4@d, the opening bid pretty much had to be based on @hKQ|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|ahh: so you have 12 without batting an eyelid  at worst on @C finesse |pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: South here is adopting an approach once described by david as 'getting up steam'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What was the idea of 5NT if you are going to raise 6 to 7 anyway?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, as long as he actually gets some up...|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not sure what Johansen is thinking about|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: S has to be wondering what N opened on so 7@D it is|pg||
nt|ahh: wasting time |pg||
nt|mariner1: well done|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 5NT was in fact waste of time|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: J@C should tell them not to hook|pg||
nt|dburn: well, I suppose he might have been thinking that if North bid seven himself, he would convert to 7NT on the grounds of safety (and for an extra couple of IMPs)|pg||
nt|ahh: all of you   who thought south would not bid 7  remember juniors love to bid and more importantly  have no fear |pg||

nt|mariner1: now EW have a slam|pg||

nt|mariner1: 3N pre-accept the H transfer I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Most would have slightly better trump than the one-two-three for that|pg||
mb|4N|nt|dburn: many Scandinavian pairs do play that 2@c can be 19-20 balanced, over which partner can bid 2@h or 2@s with a bad hand and a long suit, and opener can pass|pg||
