nt|granguru: I personally prefer to show 2-suited hands at once|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not any more|pg||
nt|garnetts: why 2@D on a balanced hand?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: h switch needed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes I´m very fast at the table but not on a racing course|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like a 3nt on EW|pg||
mb|2C|an|alerted|nt|viren169: Now is this dble take-out of diamonds or just a general value showing dbl?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|granguru: here N had an opportunity to show a great 6-5 hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but can you show the strength? |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|viren169: pushy 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: It will get a result that is deserved--kiss of death at pairs|pg||
nt|mrt2000: not without its challenges, this one|pg||
nt|mrt2000: lead @H towards hand twice I suppose|pg||
nt|sharkirl: what system E/W|pg||
nt|eamongall: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: well - when playing ghestem michaels copenhagen or any other....normally you have an opportunity to show the great hand by bidding again|pg||
nt|santyclz: Any idea what 3@hs was?  Obviously not preemptive.|pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|nt|eamongall: convention cards there|pg||
nt|sharkirl: tks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: it was!|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lets hope they are just settling in|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: reckon 3@H was quite well judged - gave South the chance to bid 3N wiht good pointy-suit stops|pg||

mc|12|nt|garnetts: The 2@D was not just pointless but ill judged with such good diamonds--well suited to No-trumps|pg||

nt|garnetts: This should be a routine 4@S in both rooms|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: 1@D the usual strong-club catch-all opener|pg||

nt|sharkirl: 3 losers|pg||
pc|d7|nt|granguru: 2@S will probably be made...|pg||
nt|mrt2000: making 2 or 3 here, I suppose|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||

nt|viren169: David, what do you think of the Bergen convention?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As NS have 10 tricks in @c it´s ok with -1 (I guess -1)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now it will be interesting!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|granguru: 3N looks pretty good|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||

nt|garnetts: I think my oppo should be made to use it|pg||
nt|viren169: playing for high stakes no doubt!|pg||
nt|garnetts: it works especially badly if playing 2/1 because it does not allow you develop middle range hands with a decent six card suit|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|granguru: but hard that the defense get all their tricks|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|c2|pg||

nt|garnetts: If the auction starts Say 1@H P 3@D you ccan now use 3@H for takeout and double to show a decent balanced hand |pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: Interesting hand now... 3N-4 by West in the other room!|pg||
nt|granguru: Ireland ahead for the second time in the set|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: What´s your opinion about 1@h on J10xxx?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mrt2000: 5@D can be made if the singleton K is dropped offside|pg||
mb|d|mb|2N|nt|santyclz: Good bid by s.  Get out of 1nt before the xing starts.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a P over 2@cX had been better|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: 1H shows spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: Playing whatever method--well he has via a transfer|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@D shows shortage|pg||
nt|viren169: 3D is shortage agreeing spades|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: even 5@S can go down with the diamond ruff, which would be a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe showing a void... there are other ways to show a singleton|pg||
nt|garnetts: I slso hope it shows a void not a singleton--there is an enormous qualitative difference|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably a correct desicion from W|pg||
nt|sharkirl: with Dbl club lead|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3NT would be a massacre here though!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: over Precision is reasonable|pg||
nt|eamongall: Mesbur will just grin at Walshe and get on with the next board|pg||
nt|ralfwil: My bid is to help partner not overturn|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: -2 if a good @D guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Crucial when playing splinters that it shows a singlton not a void|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@C is a bit of an overbid... with wasted values in diamonds|pg||
nt|eamongall: through grinding teeth|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: 2@c was forcing to game|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: Depends upon agreements but splinters should also have specified working values|pg||
nt|viren169: Well stopped... 4@S is high enough!|pg||
nt|granguru: unless a @S lead in which case you win 3N|pg||
nt|granguru: Here you might earn 6D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|viren169: not the best start for defense... not sure there is a good lead.|pg||
nt|garnetts: club feels OK--might have led a trump--but not when I can see all hands|pg||
nt|viren169: the fact a heart was not led, should help declarer to get the heart position right later in the play.|pg||
nt|sharkirl: biddind indicated minor fits, so S lead very reasonable|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru: kind of @S6R  meaning that a revoke was made playing the @S6...this card should turn red when displayed at the screen|pg||
nt|viren169: Have you come across them much since coming out of your retirement?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Ok, thanks Paul.|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: Politicians?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|garnetts: Used to be part of Little Major --Reese and Flint used it in the 70s|pg||
nt|viren169: East has pushed the boat out too far...|pg||
nt|viren169: I assume 2@D was spme sort of opening with 6+ diamonds?|pg||
nt|viren169: No need for East to bid? Was there?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not really Gad--South would have bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: If 21D was passed to him|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@D |pg||
nt|viren169: Yes on this hand... odds are that the opps dont have the values to come in?!?!|pg||
nt|garnetts: NS can make 130 in clubs |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I don´t like this doubles! Act immediately and not now! What will he do after 3@c?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: S would have been under pressure on the run of the @Cs|pg||
nt|eamongall: 4@S-1 is a sad effort by Walsh O'gorman |pg||
mb|2S|nt|granguru: another way to treat with this things is that the revoking player receives an electroshock when card is taken out of his deck|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: :)|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@S is a little better contract than 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|ralfwil: As I see it - asking for troubles|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: eventually you have more control with a 5-2 than a 4-3 trump distirbution|pg||
nt|viren169: Ummmmm, I think 2@D has taken clubs out of the auction!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@D has the potential to entice an injudicious North|pg||
nt|santyclz: I first became acquainted with this not being a penalty x when I was holding aqj10xx of the suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: unusual treatment here, to have 2@H nf  |pg||
nt|eamongall: I bet even the Gib robots with outbid that |pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Easy for us to see, as we can see all 4 hands!|pg||

nt|ralfwil: How difficult can it be to stay on the table and play @d10?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Seemed to be a give up play.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|garnetts: They are deliberately provoking me--why open 1NT when you have AQJxxx in a minor---often leads to missed games|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 11 or 12 tricks in @s depending on the lead|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|granguru: 6@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: a v delicate 3NT on a non @D lead, perhaps?|pg||

nt|starkist: anderson has good hand on this auction|pg||

nt|mrt2000: trying a bit too hard|pg||
nt|granguru: S has both @S and @H entry..no way to make this contract|pg||
nt|viren169: there it is - splinter again!( Not my choice with a Q!)|pg||

nt|viren169: You never told me about trump leads... all those years ago!|pg||

nt|garnetts: Leading a trump must never be an excuse for not thinking|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lot of players use it too much|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting 1@C or 1@S opening by West?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1@S every time for me |pg||
nt|viren169: Technically 1@C but most would open it 1@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1@C is hardly ever best when it could be prepared |pg||
nt|viren169: Technically 1@C is best... |pg||
nt|garnetts: But--with say   Qxxxx  Ax  x  AKxxx  maybe 1@C is better--that is bad spades and good clubs|pg||
nt|santyclz: Had a strip-sqz endplay against n for +2 if he returned a @d and cashed @cs.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrt2000: 7@C might make here|pg||
nt|granguru: just 3@D NS |pg||

mb|2N|mb|3H|nt|viren169: Interesting... just the hand I would bid 1@S on...|pg||
nt|santyclz: (ending,  not endplay)|pg||

nt|granguru: which all british are|pg||
nt|sharkirl: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: without any special reason|pg||
mb|6H|nt|santyclz: Y, @c duck with those beautiful @ss was very strange.|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Now 2@S over 2@C should be normal... keeping North out of the auction (Not that he wants to come in!)|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And you know your P @d|pg||
nt|starkist: hmm|pg||
nt|ralfwil: leading from a 10 or J often gives declarer a good help|pg||
mb|6S|nt|viren169: Looks like West was more worried about letting N in|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit that 2@S would always get me a singleton trump|pg||
nt|viren169: 8/9 tricks available here for a flat(ish) board|pg||
nt|sharkirl: can this be true??|pg||
nt|starkist: intended as forcing i'm sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: would have thought so|pg||
nt|sharkirl: 4c is Walshe|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrt2000: either too much or not enough, it seems !|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not that easy pehaps |pg||
nt|starkist: or redwood|pg||
nt|mrt2000: "systemic misunderstanding" i SUSPECT|pg||
nt|eamongall: Adam Mesbur and Pat Walshe have had a miserable/unlucky  time this weekend |pg||
pc|dA|nt|viren169: void for me!|pg||
nt|eamongall: Pat Walshe was called in at short notice as a replacement for the unavailable Nick Fitzgibbon so the lack partnership understanding and match fitness in Walshes case would  tell |pg||

nt|mdgraham: well, if 3@S is not forcing, it ought to be |pg||
nt|viren169: 2@S shows clubs I am told...|pg||
nt|garnetts: 7@D not the nine too I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have just been advised that 2@S shows clubs too|pg||

nt|ralfwil: no @h ruff?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Exactly the wrong hand for an unusual nt in my opinion, but worked very well.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Maybe that's why they're playing and I'm watching.|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: Meanwhile EBU have passed the century deal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a 50% 5@c will fail on a loosing @s finess|pg||
nt|eamongall: century imps total|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: H plays well|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but there is a good @h contract on EW|pg||
mb|1N|nt|garnetts: Very little actually|pg||

nt|eamongall: thats another poor effort by Walsh O Gorman ...the 30 point deck never came to light |pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|garnetts: There is an issue with the alert system--sometimes it is a real alert and sometimes you do need to know|pg||

nt|ralfwil: was P on N correct?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: no x|pg||
mb|2H|nt|viren169: 2@D is more hearts...|pg||

nt|viren169: now 2N=clubs?|pg||
nt|viren169: are they in GF now? or can it be dropped at the 3@H level?|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@c looks like a @D transfer|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 1 off here as like as not|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: The lead suggests that 2@hs may have shown 2 suits such as @hs and a minor.|pg||
nt|granguru: so the lead is clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: around 10 tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: @Dk to maintain the lead!|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|mrt2000: 11 now, perhaps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|viren169: It is nat and Invite now... with 6 hearts...|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure West will be pleased to see a diamond or two in dummy!|pg||
nt|granguru: and cross @cs|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think East should bid 3@D after 2NT--but then again I am old fashioned why let partner know you have short hearts and a six card suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Once again. the whole highway open...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|viren169: still only 8 tricks available...|pg||
nt|eamongall: there is argueably 11 tricks available |pg||
nt|eamongall: @H and @S to lose|pg||
pc|h7|nt|garnetts: is it me or did a spade lead seem obvious here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a careful play is needed. He doesn´t know that @hA is singleton|pg||

mb|2N|nt|granguru: except that it is played by West|pg||

mb|d|nt|garnetts: That is an example of what I mean by an alert being necessary|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru: A @D lead beats 4@H |pg||
