nt|starkist: hard to find the @c partial|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|garnetts: 4@S made in the OR and I cannot quite see how yet--unless they took the double spade finesse|pg||
nt|santyclz: As Kaplan used to say:  I have nothing against opening a (weak) nt with a 5-card suit, I just haven't come across the right hand yet.|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: Now S needs only a stiff @H in N hand for 6@S|pg||

nt|eamongall: what strange bidding system is being used by n/s - psychs?   asks a spec|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|granguru: is the bidding right?|pg||

nt|garnetts: What conventions?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|ralfwil: a penalty P on 3@sD had costed -4|pg||

nt|viren169: yes...my mistake|pg||
nt|viren169: last one coming up!|pg||
nt|eamongall: Now I am told the board 21 is interesting ...lets see why |pg||
nt|eamongall: suppose its 6@Ds for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Eamonn I think its because it´s the last one and you want everybody to watch all boards|pg||
mb|1H|nt|eamongall: haha |pg||
nt|eamongall: 23 point slam |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|viren169: Thanks to all especially the specs for correcting me!|pg||
nt|eamongall: they will be off 2 keycards if they can ask that |pg||
nt|sharkirl: but 3@D is a weak bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|viren169: E/W reached the dizzy height of 4@H in the other room!|pg||
nt|garnetts: There is a case for 2@C here by West|pg||

nt|viren169: and passing whtever response no doubt!|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am not going to do commentators curse|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sharkirl: East is very optimistic after such a response|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: And after Ps 2@c?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess this doesn't mean "lead a @s" any more.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|starkist: 5@C was good save|pg||
mb|p|nt|starkist: going to make a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: who's doing the thinking here?|pg||
nt|granguru: In fact with a @d lead it also can be made|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: You can bid 2@H over 2@D and expect partner to bid 2@S with three spades and two hearts|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|granguru: it is very against probabilities thou|pg||
nt|viren169: and with a 45xx shape?|pg||
nt|viren169: I would prefer pd to pass 2@H on that seq...|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perfect trumps for a high x-ruff, difficult with 4333 however.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to avoid a crossruff in the defence, he must clean trumps|pg||
nt|eamongall: however Ireland finish with a win ...finishing with a win is good to quote rory boland |pg||
nt|eamongall: 17-13 victory to Ireland|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|garnetts: AS Peter Goodman has argued that with the odd shapes that are opened 1NT these days it has risk attached |pg||
pc|c4|pg||

pc|c7|nt|eamongall: EBU going to be the champions of Camrose for this year |pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|viren169: True... best to pass 2@D and take your chances!|pg||
nt|garnetts: You may be amazed to know I prefer to open 1NT with a balanced hand which excludes most 5-4-2-2 shapes and 6-3-2-2 shapes as well|pg||
nt|viren169: worse hand 3325 shape|pg||

nt|granguru: hi all|pg||
nt|mrt2000: that's not right !!|pg||
nt|eamongall: andf the only Ralf I heard of was the racing drivers brother ...we got a few Eamons in Ireland |pg||
mb|1N|nt|santyclz: Looks like 5@h available e-w.|pg||
nt|eamongall: :):)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: NS fairly natural, EW strong club|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and a save in @s will cost 800 witn an optimal defence|pg||
nt|santyclz: And only 9 tricks in @ss or @cs for n-s.|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes cross ruff|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D|nt|viren169: 1N by North assuming 1@D may be short?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Normal so far|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indeed so, sorry|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|granguru: would you bid  2@C?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@d-no 5-card major or 6-card minor|pg||
nt|granguru: I personally prefer to show 2-suited hands at once|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not any more|pg||
nt|garnetts: why 2@D on a balanced hand?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: h switch needed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes I´m very fast at the table but not on a racing course|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like a 3nt on EW|pg||
mb|3N|nt|viren169: Now is this dble take-out of diamonds or just a general value showing dbl?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|granguru: here N had an opportunity to show a great 6-5 hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but can you show the strength? |pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|viren169: pushy 3@D|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|garnetts: It will get a result that is deserved--kiss of death at pairs|pg||
nt|mrt2000: not without its challenges, this one|pg||
nt|mrt2000: lead @H towards hand twice I suppose|pg||
nt|sharkirl: what system E/W|pg||
nt|eamongall: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
pc|s3|nt|granguru: well - when playing ghestem michaels copenhagen or any other....normally you have an opportunity to show the great hand by bidding again|pg||
nt|santyclz: Any idea what 3@hs was?  Obviously not preemptive.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|dT|nt|eamongall: convention cards there|pg||
nt|sharkirl: tks|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ralfwil: it was!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|viren169: kiss of death at imps if the red card had been applied!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a long and rather good @h|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lets hope they are just settling in|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: reckon 3@H was quite well judged - gave South the chance to bid 3N wiht good pointy-suit stops|pg||

pc|s7|nt|garnetts: The 2@D was not just pointless but ill judged with such good diamonds--well suited to No-trumps|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||

nt|garnetts: Here South also found a reason to bid 2@D--both South's got a deserved bad score|pg||
nt|viren169: Now onto a game... 4@S by E/W|pg||
nt|garnetts: This should be a routine 4@S in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@D the usual strong-club catch-all opener|pg||
nt|mrt2000: it's scored as making 3NT|pg||
nt|sharkirl: must be club discard & not Spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: Hand 24 looks like 4@H EW is a (difficult) possible contract|pg||

nt|sharkirl: looks like 5D|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 11 tricks --next |pg||
nt|viren169: 10-11 with 4 card support|pg||
nt|viren169: most pairs now have reversed the 3@C and 3@D meaning to give you more room |pg||
nt|sharkirl: 3 losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: 2@S will probably be made...|pg||
nt|mrt2000: making 2 or 3 here, I suppose|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: West reckons he has an adequate spade stopper|pg||
nt|garnetts: Nearly bid it 1@S 3@S  4@S along with most of us :)|pg||
nt|viren169: David, what do you think of the Bergen convention?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As NS have 10 tricks in @c it´s ok with -1 (I guess -1)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now it will be interesting!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|granguru: 3N looks pretty good|pg||
nt|granguru: still can go down if 1@S 2@H 2@D 1@C|pg||
pc|s6|nt|granguru: should make 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|garnetts: Another thing to creat confusion---I hate it|pg||
nt|viren169: I know you are not a great fan of conventions! but they do keep a lot of people occupied for hours and hours!|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think my oppo should be made to use it|pg||
nt|viren169: playing for high stakes no doubt!|pg||
nt|garnetts: it works especially badly if playing 2/1 because it does not allow you develop middle range hands with a decent six card suit|pg||
nt|sharkirl: getting worse|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|granguru: but hard that the defense get all their tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@c and 1@H I meant|pg||
nt|sharkirl: make now!|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|granguru: declarer must err everything to lose this contract|pg||
nt|mrt2000: win A, play a @D|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mrt2000: the Open Romm went overboard, I see !!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: second highest from a bad suit - and, lets' face it, North's spade are prety bad   |pg||
nt|granguru: afraid of a @C ruff|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|garnetts: I am happy for them to play it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: That wasn´t good to win the first. Now E has an entru to clean trumps and play @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Interesting hand now... 3N-4 by West in the other room!|pg||
nt|granguru: Ireland ahead for the second time in the set|pg||
mb|1C|nt|garnetts: Here we have a hand where west should respond with 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: What´s your opinion about 1@h on J10xxx?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mrt2000: 5@D can be made if the singleton K is dropped offside|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|santyclz: Good bid by s.  Get out of 1nt before the xing starts.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a P over 2@cX had been better|pg||
nt|santyclz: Agree.  I play a pass shows 4 good or any 5.|pg||
nt|sharkirl: prefer 3mt to 5d|pg||
nt|sharkirl: nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 1H shows spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: Playing whatever method--well he has via a transfer|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@D shows shortage|pg||
nt|viren169: 3D is shortage agreeing spades|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: even 5@S can go down with the diamond ruff, which would be a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe showing a void... there are other ways to show a singleton|pg||
nt|garnetts: I slso hope it shows a void not a singleton--there is an enormous qualitative difference|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably a correct desicion from W|pg||
nt|sharkirl: with Dbl club lead|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3NT would be a massacre here though!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: over Precision is reasonable|pg||
nt|eamongall: Mesbur will just grin at Walshe and get on with the next board|pg||
nt|ralfwil: My bid is to help partner not overturn|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: -2 if a good @D guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Crucial when playing splinters that it shows a singlton not a void|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@C is a bit of an overbid... with wasted values in diamonds|pg||
nt|eamongall: through grinding teeth|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: 2@c was forcing to game|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|garnetts: Depends upon agreements but splinters should also have specified working values|pg||
nt|viren169: Well stopped... 4@S is high enough!|pg||
nt|granguru: unless a @S lead in which case you win 3N|pg||
nt|granguru: Here you might earn 6D|pg||
pc|h8|nt|viren169: not the best start for defense... not sure there is a good lead.|pg||
nt|garnetts: club feels OK--might have led a trump--but not when I can see all hands|pg||
nt|viren169: the fact a heart was not led, should help declarer to get the heart position right later in the play.|pg||
nt|sharkirl: biddind indicated minor fits, so S lead very reasonable|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru: another way to treat with this things is that the revoking player receives an electroshock when card is taken out of his deck|pg||
pc|h7|nt|granguru: :)|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: As I see it - asking for troubles|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|granguru: eventually you have more control with a 5-2 than a 4-3 trump distirbution|pg||
nt|viren169: Ummmmm, I think 2@D has taken clubs out of the auction!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@D has the potential to entice an injudicious North|pg||
nt|santyclz: I first became acquainted with this not being a penalty x when I was holding aqj10xx of the suit.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: unusual treatment here, to have 2@H nf  |pg||
nt|eamongall: I bet even the Gib robots with outbid that |pg||

nt|viren169: Interesting 1@C or 1@S opening by West?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1@S every time for me |pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: Y, @c duck with those beautiful @ss was very strange.|pg||

nt|viren169: Looks like West was more worried about letting N in|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit that 2@S would always get me a singleton trump|pg||

nt|granguru: 2@c looks like a @D transfer|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 1 off here as like as not|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: The lead suggests that 2@hs may have shown 2 suits such as @hs and a minor.|pg||
