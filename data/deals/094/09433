nt|sharkey: Good start for Pusten after the huge loss last round|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we saw them yesterday also,  Nordby is like 3 or 4 highest point holder |pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: 3rd|pg||
mb|1H|nt|snorris: 3 nt looks good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helness 1st, Helgemo 2nd|pg||
nt|snorris: e-w|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in a suit like that - Kxxx oposite AJxx - you should not really let the defenders put you off what you were going to do|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: right |pg||
nt|sybarra: I remember |pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: An easy 3NT here|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: if you do, they will own you|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West trying to copy his opponents' aggressive bidding ... and now finds himself in a hole|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Depends who you are playing against, Mike. I bet that 90+ % of bridge players would follow small from 10x|pg||
nt|petergill: This is OK for NS|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: It's expert play to drop the 10|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|snorris: this is -1 only|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East had to overtake to play a trump|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not too easy|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|petergill: I think West had too much in his partner's suit - !QJx to pass the Dbl. That's why 3NT is on - the good @D fit and the aces and the @h stop. |pg||

nt|snorris: 4 @s a good sacrifice here|pg||
nt|petergill: unless South lacked an entry, as you can hold up 2 rounds of @H's in 3NT to break their communications.|pg||
nt|snorris: on 4@hs|pg||
nt|petergill: on Bd 1, I mean|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: I dont think w will let them play 4 @H here |pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 3@d firdt hand?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|snorris: first|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The sacrifice is even better when undoubled|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It surprises me that Harald passed 2@H|pg||
nt|snorris: me too|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|petergill: Most Souths would raise to at least 3@H the first time.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and not another bid by W?  |pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: He's changed from Superman to Caspar Q. Milquetoaste|pg||
nt|snorris: has a choise of a good and bad raise|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bjacobs: And sucked his opponents into not saving!|pg||
nt|sharkey: respect for thy elders?|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|petergill: The slow uncertain route to 4@H made sacrificing in 4@s look less attractive. A bit lucky, perhaps. |pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: What a shame, I was hoping for 7 IMPs to Syttisju.  7 7 on the scoreboard, but not to be|pg||

nt|snorris: they will probably be looking for slam here ..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: "in the zone" = spot on|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 2: Perhaps there was something clever and tactical going on in South's mind, about not raising too early and not thus forcing Ew into spades over hearts - I'm not sure. |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: doing everything correctly|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Peter, that is what he will claim at the bar|pg||

nt|snorris: maybe|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bjacobs: With hearts as the central suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, there is a double squeeze|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter, please explain that term|pg||
nt|snorris: finesse the 9 of @ds first..|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that works does it?|pg||
nt|petergill: 11 tops, duck a diamond to rectify the count, finesse @DQ - dbl squeeze follows. We will see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am sure many specs don't know what a double squeeze is|pg||
nt|snorris: to correct the count|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And they also need to know what "rectify the count" means|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exactly|pg||

nt|bjacobs: How about: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_squeeze|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: Good play. Crossing in H's would have wrecked the squeeze. |pg||

nt|snorris: too soon|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DA was premature|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h2|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h4|pc|d9|nt|petergill: Definition :) of dbl squeeze: at end of hand, each defender says to the other: "why on earth did you throw away the wrong card."|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now there is no communication for the squeeze to operate|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good one peter.  And it's essential that the winning trick is precisely a THREE|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, dummy's eventual heart winner was thrown on @DA. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: In this case it would have been the SEVEN|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|petergill: Better to cash the spades (throw a @D) and the clubs earliest..... |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double squeezes are rare; pity that Skodje did not spot it|pg||

nt|sharkey: 25-5 now|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|petergill: My thanks to Geo Tislevoll for pointing out to me early on that the dbl squeeze was on.|pg||

nt|petergill: 9 easy tricks here|pg||
nt|snorris: with a @h lead and a @s shift it can be tough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They will all welcome the lunch break after this match|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - appears so - may be some communication problems|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||

nt|snorris: 24 hp.. 1nt should be enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 17 opposite 7. You don't *have* to bid game|pg||
nt|sharkey: perhaps N upgraded his hand?|pg||
nt|snorris: 1nt(15-17)-PASS|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: You need more high cards when both hands are balanced. No 5-card suit in either hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: @D9 @H9?|pg||
nt|snorris: falt south..|pg||
nt|petergill: If West had a naughty partner who mischievously told him that a squeeze was possible in 6NT, then the next board in 3NT might not be so well played. |pg||
nt|snorris: flat|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Youy can't seriously be thing of making a move on a 7 count and 4333|pg||

nt|Walddk2: *thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be an echo in here sorry R |pg||
nt|bjacobs: You are starting to sound like John McEnroe, Roland|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: well, there is the vulnerable game bonus to consider, but to earn your vulnerable game bonus you have to make the vulnerable game |pg||

pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: Funnily enough vulnerable also means that undertricks are more expensive|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South enjoying how badly it's going|pg||
nt|petergill: According to someone who recently studyied lots of hands on computers, 24 HCP makes game about 38% of the time, more than the 36% needed for a vul game at IMPs. That idea fails ...|pg||
nt|petergill: this time. |pg||

nt|mdgraham: after the last match, NS here have held on and done well|pg||

nt|bjacobs: And well done to Shirley, Peter,  Roland, Snorri, Carl and Mike, who all proved that they can play double squeezes - at least from the commentary position|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to you also Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I must say that that one was fairly tricky|pg||
nt|sharkey: we're getting good at Wipeouts now - we need some real close matches henceforth|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation to Finn Brandsnes for organizing these broadcasts|pg||
nt|sharkey: 51 IMPs is a "no hitter"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There's a break now of about an hour before the next (third last) match|pg||
nt|sharkey: 25-0|pg||
nt|petergill: Double squeezes are much easier to play if you can see all 52 cards. |pg||

nt|petergill: Herrings?|pg||
