nt|paulg: this looks a more interesting hand|pg||
nt|cindy: im not commenting on which female players seemed to have male dna|pg||
nt|jallerton: Wales have their first IMPs.  They bid and made the thin 6@c on board 5|pg||
nt|ciaran: Isn't the standard defense to this type of three suited opener "double and lead trump"|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: auction on 8: 1@s - 2@d - 2N - P - 4@c - P - 4@h - P - 4@s - end|pg||
nt|eamongall: 140 in the bag but I predict  imps out for Ireland|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: he didn't want the extra 30|pg||
nt|viren169: We need it!|pg||
nt|viren169: we need more good boards!|pg||
nt|othered1: That was ust a typical vul 3N.  Maybe odds-off, but you bid it.|pg||
nt|mariner1: slam EW here|pg||
nt|mariner1: Shirley with the more ethereal comments :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: we lost board 7!|pg||
nt|roswolf: on the grand 6@H was bid as predicted for 17 imps|pg||
nt|werge: This looks friendly - 620 E/W|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree MIke,  if foks have never played many long matches,  it takes it toll|pg||
nt|sybarra: *folks|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: nothing to 4s here|pg||
nt|viren169: I think 3@S by North seems normal at that vul... playing 5-card majs |pg||
nt|viren169: another light opener!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Nice to play board 7. First a miss and than find @h 4-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|mowen: exciting hand - might be plenty of bidding|pg||
nt|finch: so far only five imps changed hands this set (4-1 to england) but a swing is coming on 23|pg||
nt|finch: I think you have to bid 4@S on the West hand here and hope|pg||
nt|ciaran: Very good slam here for N/S - no wasted values|pg||
nt|sybarra: S coning in with a gadget?  I guess not|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: 2@s is a strong jump shift ... a rare treatment in top level bridge nowadays|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can east pass?|pg||
nt|cindy: i hope not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3d by east operator|pg||
nt|sharkirl: they're not playing 5-card|pg||
nt|jallerton: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|lestergold: crads lie very badly for e/w here|pg||
nt|finch: on second thoughts, maybe that's a bit aggressive|pg||
nt|ciaran: Thanks Tim!|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@d= 5+@h, 9+ HCP|pg||
nt|eamongall: Garvey and Cooke should stroll into this as they are very practiced bidders|pg||
nt|petepunt: @C was 4+ here|pg||
nt|roswolf: house is getting close to its original handicap advantage (99)|pg||
nt|lestergold: it happens in the uk trials every year the less experienced flake out|pg||
nt|lestergold: they are very gruelling|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes, as I said in the previous segment, the psychological factor is not to be overseen. Long matches combined with broadcasting and fatigue can set pressure|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: i like strong jump shifts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@d|pg||
nt|mariner1: mirrored minors means only 6 makes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: but 2@S was last makeable spot|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont believe in using my bids to improve part scores|pg||
nt|sharkirl: but wud seem obvious on that bidding that p has 5 @Ss|pg||
nt|petepunt: 6@D is a good spot|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cindy: more useful to use them to get to games and slams|pg||
nt|viren169: another opportunity for slam here for Ireland|pg||
nt|lestergold: even 3d looks like it cannot make but N/S are not far off making 4h|pg||
nt|ianrei: only two losers but lack of entries make life difficlt|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is the entries needed to the nortyh hand for taking all those winning finesses|pg||
nt|jallerton: but can build a @c trick for a @s pitch just losing 1 trick in each side suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: Maybe forcing dummy stops this plan|pg||
nt|mowen: 3 small clubs is bad|pg||
nt|ianrei: 5C with 3 likely tricks looks risky|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c gives EW a decision though|pg||
nt|petepunt: even 6@c|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ciaran: Can't be beaten, but declarer may sweat before making!|pg||
nt|finch: yes, if partner has club length it's a disaster, if partner has club shortage and extras he will protect|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good decision by Howard.  Even with all his defense, 4H is cold|pg||
nt|ianrei: but 5C goes for 1100 on best defence|pg||
nt|ciaran: Having said that, this could be very expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: yes, that did happen. Immediate 4@h reply!|pg||
nt|ciaran: the commentators curse, eh, Eamon!|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4@D may agree @H here though|pg||
nt|mowen: very light opening even by the standards of this match|pg||
nt|bobh1: the @c play seems irresponsible|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has some play here|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|jallerton: and West has not doubled|pg||
nt|mariner1: .|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: oh right, 7@D does make, only 6@S|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think cold|pg||
nt|mariner1: Lirarna is taking a lot of chances and they are paying off..... still a long way to go|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jallerton: but can ruff and play @c instead|pg||
nt|petepunt: most roads lead to 2 off|pg||
nt|mowen: Garvey need sto ruff A@C and play K@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: N finding this auction fascinating |pg||
nt|sybarra: now S |pg||
nt|werge: 4 @s is the right spot|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: i dont believe in weak 2@D bids, especially this weak|pg||
nt|viren169: Norman will be going backwards now at every opportunity!|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|cindy: it looks like a book 2D bid if thats what you play|pg||
nt|viren169: well done... short and simple seq...|pg||
nt|james_h: pragmatic 6@c|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N forcing raise and 3@D enquiring,,,,|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In sweden many players show a side suit as a positive response, so this is a possibility to reach 7@d|pg||
nt|mariner1: well no slam leaves door open for San Sac in Open|pg||
nt|ralfwil: unbelieveable!|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead helps defense|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg: 4@h has appeal to protect partner's minor suit holdings|pg||
nt|jferg: oops at least one too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: retaining a dummy entry for a major suit lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c looking very clever now|pg||
nt|ianrei: Howard judged well |pg||
nt|mariner1: hard to think W would not have bid slam|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: i toh spade switch thast given the contract|pg||
nt|ianrei: thats a friendly switch|pg||
nt|mowen: and Cooke must not ruff it|pg||
nt|finch: the king of diamonds discard may be enough for Cooke not to ruff|pg||
nt|mowen: now north must not rise with A@H|pg||
nt|finch: but against that it's very very very hard not to take the setting trick against a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|finch: sorry I was a trick out, if north ruffs the second club he can't discard the @DK|pg||
nt|mowen: the 2 over game force has allowed the club fit to be found|pg||
nt|viren169: Aceless 9 count? Not good in my book!|pg||
nt|mowen: but will be pass?|pg||
nt|viren169: 1 for the road? this is high enough!|pg||
nt|mowen: easy to see 6@C could be right|pg||
nt|viren169: but not on this hand...|pg||
nt|mowen: add the AorQ of @Cs to east|pg||
nt|viren169: At least Norman didnt bid 3@C over 2D!|pg||
nt|mowen: I think he will bid on|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3n on top hoiwebver fascinating|pg||
nt|rnc: But on the summary, even if HOUSE fails to win, they have really made a good effort in this tournament. Beeing ranked as no 12 (among 19), they'd crushed no 1, no 2 and are now ...|pg||
nt|rnc: facing no 4 in the finals. And has done a good job so far.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: time for a bookburning then|pg||
nt|viren169: With a void in pd suit and facing possibly only 4 card @C suit...pass is right!|pg||
nt|mowen: I am wrong again - some decision|pg||
nt|viren169: Well done Espen!|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lestergold: mullered the defence in one fell swoop|pg||
nt|ianrei: should now make - i think a second D at trick 2 made this impossible|pg||
nt|ianrei: so who should have doubled 5C ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: first failing contract of the day?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s should make but there are some nasty suprises availabkle inr4s as we can see|pg||
nt|lestergold: but where are they going?|pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 29 with their best fit a 4/4 missing two of the top honours|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh dear  too high |pg||
nt|rnc: This could be a possible recover for NS|pg||
nt|rnc: The lead down to 32 - smallest margin so far in this final|pg||
nt|lestergold: but about to rise again probably|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: Fahrenheit 451|pg||
nt|james_h: he has run into a bad breal in clubs tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: now ruff dim finesse heart cash ace and play spade and take club finesse losing only a dim and a spade that cost maybe two tricksw that switch|pg||
nt|jallerton: what else could be have done? @d at trick 2 is ruffed, @cQ led|pg||
nt|viren169: Espen has seen some of Norman's bid before!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnc: Presumably bd 32 would (and should) be a big pic up for Lirarna. But will wait and see...|pg||
nt|lestergold: a double would beat this out of hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: but maybe south thinks they may be on way to 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmmmn are we out of control or landing in 5 @S |pg||
nt|rnc: Mayday, mayday...|pg||
nt|lestergold: hasnt landed yet!|pg||
nt|lestergold: still on final approach|pg||
nt|lestergold: with an engine failure and fire|pg||
nt|sybarra: Houston,  are we on the glide path?|pg||
nt|rnc: Like the Canadian TV-series about airplane crashes...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ciaran: Had S ducked that, this would have been interesting|pg||
nt|mowen: why would east bid 3@C on 4cards?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure west's hand is a slam force, but it looks like no try was made.  And that doesn't feel right.  But do they open garbage hands with bad suits?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cindy: you should write to them|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bettertake that HA soon|pg||
nt|james_h: break|pg||
pc|s3|nt|viren169: no chance of an overtrick.... |pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, South making sure of this|pg||
nt|lestergold: beam me up scottie|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petepunt: K@D maybe a bit extravagent ?|pg||
nt|mowen: it was when pard does not have a @D|pg||
nt|mowen: contract is now cold|pg||
nt|finch: yes, if West works out what was going on.  He might after drawing trumps and a heart up.|pg||
nt|lestergold: its star wars|pg||
nt|lestergold: no double but plenty trouble|pg||
nt|rnc: Imp's come and imp's go. (Hope I didn't say too much now...) :)|pg||
nt|werge: It s really a friendly match - without doubles|pg||
nt|lestergold: and we are eally friendly commentators|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: should have forced duumy to ruff then declarer can take heart finesse and has nine tricks but could still be playing next week for the tenth|pg||
nt|eamongall: I was going to say ...what happened ... but I know i will get 100 answers ..."Nothing" |pg||
nt|ralfwil: There had been a nice defence with @sQ second after AK|pg||
nt|othered1: That grand was a 30 imp swing.  Even had it worked out for Lirarna they would still have a tough row to hoe to get back into the match.|pg||
nt|werge: Sure - for ever|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes, everybody is nice and friendly - as it should be.|pg||
nt|sybarra: S may be afrad to "give the hand away" with a X |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|paulg: but partner could conceivably only have 5 hearts if he didn't want to introduce a weak 4-card minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: scoreboard about to hit high gear|pg||
nt|marlowepi: by my calculations that equals Celsius 200. i wonder if that is the title in Europe|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks like cahnces now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jallerton: i think @s switch gives the 11th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Howard told Garvey "I've got king-jack"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3 aces and a side suit with KQ! |pg||
pc|c2|pc|d5|nt|mowen: what else is there to do|pg||
nt|viren169: good start for defense... taking out the entry early!|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|viren169: just bidding his shape out over 2N|pg||
nt|mowen: for what reason - to tell the oppo what to lead?|pg||
nt|viren169: N does best to pitch a heart...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|finch: sometimes it's hard to envisage any layout where you are making|pg||
nt|finch: if South is 2227 with Hx in diamonds, he makes now by heart ruff, ace and a diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed ed|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he has limited defence to other possible lsams from his point of view but im a money player and im greedy i gerDOUBLE|pg||
nt|rnc: And in fact, it has been a very nice atmosphere through the whole final (and the whole tournament in fact)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ianrei: jeffreys right - the CQ holding the lead works|pg||
nt|mowen: 2nd disaster for n/s|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry 218|pg||
nt|lestergold: true if q of club led makes|pg||
nt|finch: although that's wildly unlikely given the diamond discard|pg||
nt|ciaran: England in 4HX on the board where Ireland made 5HX|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: so maybe nom defence to beat it|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|rnc: If I go for a coffee now, pls dont tell me the contract made later :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i don;t think the 3S bid should be forcing in that sequence|pg||
nt|cindy: no not 3S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade back and two off after one winning finesse|pg||
nt|mariner1: and 4 trumps|pg||
pc|d2|mc|8|nt|werge: Fine for sure - but doubles are pary of the game|pg||

nt|jcomyn: no I am outnumbered|pg||
nt|viren169: not on that line...|pg||
nt|mowen: the play looked right|pg||
nt|mariner1: now told that HOUSE started with a 99 point handicap|pg||
nt|sybarra: bob you probably didnt plan on 2 up tricks there|pg||
nt|bobh1: Q@D was a remarkable play|pg||
nt|mariner1: no games here it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: House now needs to win over 3 imps/board for the rest of the match, a very tough order|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice play in 4@h for NS. Crossruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: (I dont have the pound sign)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont play that high a stake id like to against some i know|pg||
nt|rnc: Still 8 bds to score, and the margin is down to 29...|pg||
nt|lestergold: how many to play here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 1H by West will keep North quiet...|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: wales looking like a top flight team now |pg||
nt|viren169: best not to open with those hands! And you dont have that problem!|pg||
nt|mowen: so 7@D with a good view in clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: multi |pg||
nt|sybarra: up to 32|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|viren169: 6@D will be good to reach!|pg||
nt|mowen: but spade bidding will make it difficult|pg||
nt|viren169: 4/5@S by south|pg||
nt|mowen: 5@S looks too much to me|pg||
nt|mariner1: Ed you are being too kind to W, imho|pg||
nt|mariner1: well S steals the 3N from EW|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@s?|pg||
nt|lestergold: ??|pg||
nt|sybarra: check movie you can tell |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i prefer a neg double with north's hnad|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, I think they play dbl as clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: O'Gorman getting some Lucozade ...|pg||
nt|eamongall: make sure he does not spill it ....lucosade stains ...|pg||
nt|viren169: Tough as 1C may be short... E/W play 5-card majs|pg||
nt|othered1: Today half the field opens: Jxxxx, KQx, x, KQJxx.  and you're not safe at the 5-level|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@D stiff helps here|pg||
nt|othered1: @CKQJx only|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: ty Peter|pg||
nt|viren169: North's having nothing of it!|pg||
nt|mowen: partner might be pushing opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|viren169: 5N=pick a minor?|pg||
nt|mowen: must be|pg||
nt|othered1: correct that, Lirarna needs > 3imps/board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianrei: N can back in now to reach their D partscore|pg||
nt|bobh1: not enough entries to the W hand|pg||
nt|sybarra:   32 will be last bd|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: well they couldnt reach their best spot namely three dims|pg||
nt|ianrei: no - N has sold out to 2S|pg||
nt|lestergold: at least they will beat 2s|pg||
nt|petepunt: daf gary won solver medal a few years ago in commonwealth fairlt exp.  Townsend Gold jet-lagged suspect|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he has a loser in each suit best defense,,,,,, unless they help|pg||
nt|mariner1: N might have risked 3@H here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 to go inc this|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 10 asking for middle suit!?|pg||
nt|viren169: N/S have done enough...|pg||
mb|3S|nt|paulg: i would have doubled 2@d here|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer now should get the diamonds right to make her contract on the @C lead|pg||
nt|ianrei: as long as the cash their C tricks after taking the ruff|pg||
nt|eamongall: Theres been a good deal on Lucozade in Ireland recently ...4 litres for 4 euros..two large bottles|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: it is a large bottle he has|pg||
nt|petepunt: brd 6 will  hurt eng tho'|pg||
nt|chick: they just returned from Australia, right?|pg||
nt|mowen: 5@S has ensured that England bid a slam|pg||
nt|viren169: wow... a bit pushy!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I vote fro a trumph lead from W|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: needs to get out of the way with that KC|pg||
nt|ianrei: if N puts S in with the CK after taking his ruff it will make|pg||
nt|jallerton: If you partner opens light, you need to excercise caution in response|pg||
nt|ianrei: the D lie well, others do not|pg||
nt|ianrei: N will do well to get this in|pg||
nt|othered1: Playing a limited opening bid system, north reasonably decided not to sniff about for @H slam.|pg||
nt|othered1: In standard methods, north would have had to take stronger action.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|james_h: nice work|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good auction - 3H splinter agreeing clubs|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - but he has seen many openings like this from South|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes, and still another 2 to score, since OR is a bit late. They have played 24 boards so far|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be an interesting ending to the match|pg||
nt|rnc: Indeed, now down to 17 imp's...puuh|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this isnt making|pg||
nt|lestergold: well shouldnt|pg||
nt|rnc: better take the insurance, yes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: no dislike of lead|pg||
nt|james_h: next|pg||
nt|lestergold: im concerned about the second club loser disappearing on the fourth heart|pg||
nt|mowen: maybe expecting a save|pg||
nt|viren169: Is this time for a restricted choice lesson?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: EE says 'captain's orders@@ !!|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: as it is, no-one seems to have bid their majors ... perhaps this is tipping point of the minor-suit comeback|pg||
nt|ciaran: Diamonds sit pretty well for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: but then I don't know what constitutes a "small" bottle|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Good restraint from Selway|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe 1-off?|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u there is a third dim to deal with|pg||
nt|jallerton: has chances in all the suits|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: how would you like the suit?|pg||
nt|jallerton: The problem was the 1NT bid.  S not expecting a stiff heart in partner's hand|pg||
nt|ciaran: looks like 4H is a likely make, but would be very pushy to bid it|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes yea cup were doing well i think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thats true, but not giving a chance.....|pg||
nt|lestergold: not best switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ciaran: I think I'd have overcalled 2@S with such a good suit and shape|pg||
nt|jcomyn: over 1S u mean |pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes|pg||
nt|james_h: I dont doubt you for 1 sec Ciaran|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but that might be systemic|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well since a 1S response only shows 4, a 2S overcall should be natural|pg||
nt|jcomyn: it would with me but you never know|pg||
nt|james_h: For the Kibs ... Like most good players Ciaran sees the silver lining never the cloud|pg||
nt|mowen: I think denning needs to lead the @C9 to beat this|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg: @sK now|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jferg: low to enc|pg||
nt|jferg: is there system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when Qxxxx in dummy i switch to suit preference|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jallerton: 4@s 2@h 2@d|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jferg: true so club 10 would suggest hearts|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ianrei: W should have ducked the D|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree that west must try to make a slam try and not just inquire about generic strength or side x.  But to force to slam is wildly gambling unless your openings are very sound|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jallerton: still off.  E has to come to a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: apart from @d of course|pg||
nt|ianrei: he has 4D, 2S and 2 Aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: but no comms|pg||
nt|ianrei: if he puts in the H10, E has to get off lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think there were considerably more hands where slam makes than not,,,,, I'm a|pg||
nt|mariner1: bidder|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petepunt: had some chances if @S right|pg||
nt|viren169: lots of money going on Norman going down!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|viren169: Defense still needs to be careful...|pg||
nt|finch: this is going a couple off I think with the spade finesse wrong and both heart honours wrong|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if readable as middle yes|pg||
nt|finch: yes, the @SK onside was a necessary start to make it|pg||
nt|petepunt: might well be 3 off after @S ducked|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: which spade will he play|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ianrei: needs to play SQ|pg||
nt|viren169: I with Norman to make it!|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry she|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|paulg: @s2 asking for diamond back|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|cindy: how could it be readable ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: and exit in @d|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mowen: so England going for it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think W is going to wish he took that other trick (@H)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mariner1: so off 1 very good here|pg||
nt|othered1: Look at only your hand and partner's opening then take a stab was once popular.  Then the Culbertsons beat up Buller & Co and that style faded away|pg||

nt|rnc: all by her own|pg||

nt|james_h: Its a good bidders game not any bidders game|pg||
nt|ianrei: N could still have beaten it by playing a D instead of the second S|pg||
nt|jallerton: 6@d on this one?  Roland would be in it.|pg||
nt|mowen: doubled but cold|pg||
nt|viren169: yes...|pg||
nt|werge: Another easy borad - another 450|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|werge: - as for the commentators!|pg||
nt|rnc: Nothing bad can happen here, can it? |pg||
mb|1C|nt|paulg: i'm sure we'll all be happy with this takeout double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that's what a double of 1NT should look like|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ew need to play 3NT|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H by N/S|pg||
nt|finch: another hand where EW may get a bit high.  11 opposite 11 may be 'opening bid opposite opening bid' but that doesn't mean game|pg||
nt|finch: (unless you are Meckwell)|pg||
nt|ciaran: Interesting opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: I'm sure the CC said 14-16!|pg||
nt|chick: hmmm wonder what 2@S means|pg||
nt|chick: one kib suggests a bad preempt in any suit|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cindy: yes :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: It does|pg||
nt|jallerton: He has upgraded for the good diamond suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: think Cooke said pass "denies spade support" but not totally sure|pg||
nt|viren169: dreaded 4441 hand ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: doubt it|pg||
nt|roswolf: you would be suprised|pg||
mb|d|nt|cindy: they need to play 1Nx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H strikes me as a recipe for disaster|pg||
nt|cindy: what is W piping up about ?|pg||
nt|ciaran: it certainly is a sound debut - this has not been a set for bidding pessimistically|pg||
nt|james_h: I like your style, but it means you are always on the limit|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes, just 3 losers|pg||
nt|viren169: West seems to have been brushed aside looking at the best hand at the table...|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think there is enuf work to do in 5d altho on this lay out 6 may roll in|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, 5@d is more realistic|pg||
nt|lestergold: i preecit that they will not get higher than 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: upgraded to first-class|pg||
nt|jallerton: There is a disclosure issue here|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer 1@D with West's hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: surely it shows more than 2 jacks|pg||
nt|viren169: dangerous dble by Brunner|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: might not even reach that|pg||
nt|jallerton: undo|pg||
nt|mowen: they might stop in 2M|pg||
nt|mariner1: ED you check for controls and bid it,,,,, no stab to it,,,,,,, you are too conservative|pg||
nt|mariner1: :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: slam if no @D lead|pg||
nt|bobh1: E splintered in the wrong suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: With evey finesse right, looks like there are 11 tricks available in spades|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bejaypers that score is geting healthy|pg||
nt|eamongall: England by 90 against Scotland ...who started with 19 19 25 and were competitive this morning|pg||
nt|werge: claim...!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: we are boringly agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: huh|pg||
nt|viren169: dble will hold declarer to 5/6 tricks on good defense!|pg||
nt|ianrei: how about 3NT - they might bid that|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@d - how strong is that?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well now that any bit of candyfloss counts as a stop for nt purposes that may be true|pg||
nt|ianrei: surely 2H FSF?|pg||
nt|jallerton: they play strong @c but even so|pg||
nt|eamongall: Wales by 20 against North|pg||
nt|petepunt: correct|pg||
nt|petepunt: need to play 2N as t/o and al with most 8+ i believe|pg||
nt|petepunt: balance with most suitable 8+|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops slam if no @c lead :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now let´s see if S trusts his partner with a small|pg||
nt|werge: Jack from dummy - to test South|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jallerton: a lot of good players upgrade for playing strength - fine as long as your opponents know|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C was checkback...|pg||
nt|bobh1: down by 60, clear to splinter in @c's|pg||
nt|lestergold: but when players are tired they can be as w have seen very erratic and the play standard has deterioted markedly|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cindy: and what about N and that 3D ?|pg||
nt|jferg: over here we bid if we have nothing otherwise passing suggests we want to penalise the opposition|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha|pg||
nt|cindy: so to stay out of trouble, you have to stay home|pg||
nt|ianrei: N/S can make 3NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c = @c+@h|pg||
nt|ianrei: if D are lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: S can make 3NT, not N|pg||
nt|jallerton: unles W starts with @hQ|pg||
nt|othered1: Wow! 2N must be *really* strong in their methods.|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Unknown (Sweden), our superb operator, for doing an|pg||
nt|mariner1: excellent job!!!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: so what if you have xxx xxxx xxx xxx|pg||
nt|ciaran: ..for E/W with half the points and a 9 card fit, 1@D is their limit|pg||
nt|viren169: If East cannot bid over 3@H best to let it go by West...|pg||
nt|sharkirl: carnage|pg||
nt|sharkirl: 5@D better|pg||
nt|viren169: good lead... trump back!|pg||

nt|sybarra: its so difficult to play this many boards|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes, and as last segment a week ago, HOUSE seems tired and slippry in the card play|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could get quite high if west is adventurous|pg||
nt|lestergold: im sympathetic because being diabetic its themajor reason why i am not up to long matches|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|james_h: double is a support double|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they cant unravel the clubs so tis would make if thatswhere they play|pg||
nt|finch: 2@C artificial of some form (probably forcing 2@D) - I guess 2@H is 5-4 majors invitational now|pg||
nt|finch: you were right, Steve|pg||
nt|viren169: lost their heart fit?!?!|pg||

pc|h2|nt|jallerton: h! 3 encouraging?|pg||

pc|cK|nt|jferg: say oppo open 12-14 nt and p x what do you do if oppo bid 2c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have trouble thirsting to play those methods. |pg||

nt|cindy: would have to do a lot of drinking first|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nothing that some acapulco gold couldn;t fix|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club king now for the sure set|pg||
nt|jferg: we lay arescue system called helvic where xx showsa five card suit and 2c shows c & dias etc|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Howard's utterly pointless double of hearts and u dont even get the proper lead|pg||
nt|mowen: 2@S is a decent spot|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|viren169: 4@H could have been on...|pg||

nt|lestergold: no insurance Carl|pg||

pc|c4|nt|mowen: thin for 4@H with 12 opposite 9|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ciaran: Intended as suit preference?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharkirl: ??|pg||
nt|viren169: 4N by West is a possibility as pointed out by some specs|pg||
nt|sharkirl: operator?  did he not play the Jack?|pg||
nt|viren169: I expect hearts to be found in the other room!|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|cindy: and take your st bernard with you everywhere|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok plan B, try to let this make|pg||
nt|lestergold: nine tricks now without even having to take the spade finesse|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rnc: The textbook play on this trump suit is the 10 to cater for nine single by South|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmmm can make some OT's now|pg||
nt|lestergold: trying to prevent dimruffs |pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 imps to house on 26|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: however this may now mean 5 made|pg||

nt|lestergold: hm|pg||
pc|hT|nt|paulg: at the other table North will play this in 1NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer is making an effort here... not sure about the defense!|pg||
nt|sharkirl: I can't believe this defence by Mesbur?  perhaps he assumed Holland had 5 @Ss|pg||
nt|viren169: Easy for us... we can see all 4 hands... |pg||
nt|finch: yes, he can effectively cross ruff and come to quite a few tricks|pg||
nt|mowen: and go down I guess|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|jallerton: in fact the hearts are blocked so probably OK|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: wait, i am confused, whose bidding are we talking about? i thought all this was prompted by cindy's comment about the 2H call, but now it seems we are duiscussing S|pg||
pc|dA|nt|viren169: Yes all seems a bit strange... Maybe he felt sorry for Holland!|pg||
nt|sharkirl: playing 5@D undoubled in Open Room|pg||
nt|viren169: Now only 3 off!|pg||
nt|mowen: south is sort of squeezed|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: wasnt finess marked?  can it cost?|pg||
nt|lestergold: wasnt the heart finesse a safety play as well as an overtrick play?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||

nt|paulg: N/S play 2NT as 20-22 ... that is a large range so no reason to upgrade poor 19 counts|pg||
nt|cindy: and checking the st bernard for brandy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: my rescue system is called pelvic. a few well-executed twitches and we find our best runout fit with ease|pg||
nt|jferg: yes when 1nt was x and coffey bid 2c he was showing clubs and dias, if sime paases he shows willingness to x a bid showa weakness|pg||
nt|cindy: lolol|pg||
nt|cindy: thats pretty good marshall|pg||
nt|cindy: put that on yer cc|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 21-9 to holders at the moment|pg||
nt|ciaran: should be some imps for e/w there|pg||
nt|sharkirl: don't think walshe would have looked for @D ruff with singleton trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: this looks good for EBU at +35 IMP. What does that convert to, commentators?|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW have a nice 3N here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: He heard us!|pg||
nt|werge: Oh - it´s even accepted, the claim. Nice opponents|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a trickier hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Of course I had my window open!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: I dont take anything for granted with these players.. :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: are you at the venue ralf?|pg||
nt|sybarra: late dinner Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well dinner here can be any time from 4 in afternoon to 1 in morning|pg||
nt|roswolf: if you win a match after -99 imps handicap how many master points do you get - zillions?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: ok john, thanks. sorry for some of my earlier comments which were predicated on assumption we were talking about the 2H call|pg||
mb|1H|nt|viren169: 6@S on a non @D lead here...|pg||
mb|d|nt|jallerton: 2@d =18-20 BAL (they treat 4441 as BAL)|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc09/fc_main_en.htm  -|pg||
nt|mariner1: Tournament Site|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cindy: thats what i thought too !|pg||
nt|jferg: np  banter is good|pg||
nt|viren169: This hand could go anywhere!|pg||
nt|ianrei: so they going to reach 3NT instead of the good but unlucky 5D|pg||
nt|mowen: another big hand - @D lead to beat 6@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg: 3NT looks clear now, but not an easy contract to play on the spade lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: no, just 2@d|pg||
nt|ianrei: 4H E/W is not too bad either|pg||
nt|jallerton: John Howard was happy with 2@d|pg||
nt|rnc: They get per match (per 32 bd-segments)|pg||
nt|roswolf: into the valley of death?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hmwell another Eva vulnerable overcaqll of dubiousm merit|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: dble= support or general take-out?|pg||
nt|viren169: East will lead one of his aces if 6@D is reached!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: basis system here for decades was 4 card suits and 12-14 nt|pg||
nt|eamongall: about 21-9 but I will check|pg||
nt|lestergold: the dim pips do not permit this bid|pg||
nt|rnc: She's still awake, yes!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: hmm|pg||
nt|jferg: lots of 800, 1100 in 1nt x|pg||
nt|cindy: that will work i guess but dontcha like 3H better ?|pg||
nt|cindy: remember the old conv cards always use to have something called swiss on them ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this bid use to show solid diamonds before the crash|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the classical meaning of 4D was this sort of hand but with solid diamonds (or at least headed by AK). stretching the criteria here|pg||
nt|cindy: and a better hand|pg||
nt|viren169: probably general take-out|pg||
nt|mowen: west will be on lead to @Ss|pg||
nt|viren169: on their way!|pg||
nt|viren169: tough for East to find it either|pg||
nt|mowen: the 4@C splinter might cost the slam|pg||
pc|hA|nt|viren169: 4@D now!|pg||
nt|mowen: perhaps a make splinter in @Ds would be better|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no 350 km from that, but I have a strong voice....|pg||
nt|werge: Let´s see, whether E/W have a system allowing them to play a @D-contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: saved by the negative double:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and spade holding not ideal in offence but great in defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: can E pass?|pg||
nt|roswolf: will east pot shot 3nt?|pg||
nt|lestergold: however let off hook|pg||
nt|lestergold: and maybe pushed opposm overboard|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cindy: not that Qx of clubs|pg||
nt|eamongall: 35-40 is 21-9|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 10 e/w got to 5@S and went -1 for 12 imps back|pg||
nt|othered1: south may not sell out|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petepunt: slam try 3n|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this auction does smell fishy|pg||
nt|werge: That´s well-known - when partner asks, why you did´nt act, you answer: As you saw, I thought about it|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep hes doen it|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch|pg||
nt|sybarra: bummer|pg||
nt|lestergold: and no play whatsoever|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|cindy: uhoh|pg||
nt|jallerton: Welcome back!|pg||
nt|chick: serious 3N?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg: probably best to lead clubs and then play on hearts|pg||
nt|paulg: but hard to see enough tricks|pg||
nt|cindy: giving some back maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: difficult to execute a devil's coup in a side suit|pg||
nt|jferg: looks like remargen the bridge too far!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: nope |pg||
nt|rnc: Think about the insurance, Mike :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: don't have enough spots anyway for devil's coup|pg||
nt|viren169: East may find a diamond now as neither N/S will cue 2nd round control in @D|pg||
nt|viren169: West!|pg||
nt|mowen: if South is going on he should cue @Ds to try to stop the lead|pg||
nt|viren169: Ummmmmmm... is Zia South?|pg||
nt|mowen: no Paul Denning is a solid citizen|pg||
nt|mowen: but temptation lurks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Denning is still thinking.....|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as always, I will take action after 1@c and not balance|pg||
nt|sybarra: defense has to do too much wrong to let it thru|pg||
nt|roswolf: SOUTH LEADS HIS PARDS SUIT = VERY WISE|pg||
nt|lestergold: no insurance i stick my neck out if this makes im going back to work|pg||
pc|h5|nt|james_h: good lead|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good lead - there is a case for as heart on this auction as well.|pg||
nt|viren169: could be let through here!|pg||
nt|viren169: need a @H switch...|pg||
nt|viren169: seems unusal not to lead a @H when it bit and supported?!?!|pg||
nt|james_h: @h comming|pg||
nt|finch: EW are the 8 of diamonds off being able to make 3NT with spades 3-3, but the diamond pips are such that 1S is an excellent spot|pg||
nt|mowen: n/s like to signal with the K@D|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes think thats the name :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: there is a squeeze position against N though so more possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is E is very disappointed in W hand |pg||
nt|rnc: Let's hope it fails then - so you can have your late dinner...|pg||
nt|lestergold: east forced west to do something|pg||
nt|roswolf: that would be the £100 table mike!?|pg||
nt|sybarra: often we dont see that Geoffrey |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2n the limit for e/w  ?|pg||
nt|viren169: Not easy as South know they are missing A of @H|pg||
nt|mowen: he should ask Espen what he intends to lead!|pg||
nt|mariner1: N just needs to pitch carefully|pg||
pc|d2|nt|viren169: He must have seen Espen had the @D ready!|pg||
nt|mowen: perhaps he did|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree! bluff and counter bluff! |pg||
nt|mowen: so a good stop|pg||
nt|viren169: I would loved to have seen the 5@D bid!|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|viren169: I could be a Euro up or down depeneding on next trick!|pg||
nt|mowen: plenty of possible slam hands in this set|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: grr, verrrry wobbly connection here, sorry again all|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: hm?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i once played in a game where my pard carried me in cuch a game!|pg||
nt|lestergold: no 100 pound table in england these days|pg||
pc|c5|nt|james_h: terry must unblock|pg||
nt|jallerton: catching up, not playing a speedball!|pg||
nt|viren169: that would make it extremely difficult for West!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|viren169: One Euro up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|paulg: the upside for declarer is that he knows that this will be the same everywhere|pg||
nt|ciaran: Now, N needs to unblock|pg||
nt|james_h: Ur up|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: if W's black suit doubleton had been in spades, this lead would have blown the defense. when we tally our luck, we often take things like that for granted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now if lavery returns club jack maybe|pg||
nt|jferg: wonder why east bid 5d went west cue bid dias|pg||
nt|mowen: mostly with limited high cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: and at my club nothing like that stake|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|finch: funny it looks natural to play a heart at trick 2, but trumps would have worked better|pg||
nt|petepunt: heard 3n let thru'  in one match on @H lead|pg||
nt|finch: if the acution starts 1NT (weak) double and NS find their heart fit, you can see that might happen|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||

pc|hA|nt|Walddk5: So Wein must have shown a slam invitational hand by transferring first|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Must have|pg||

nt|fabsayc: and no side winners to discard heart losers|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes of course|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry MUST have unblocked otherwise it makes|pg||
nt|viren169: good fight back by England!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: there wasn't much more to 12. He played off his remaining trumps but the hearts remained very blocked.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: comfort break|pg||
nt|eamongall: that 13 imps translates to 3 VP in this case ...18-12 now |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: if it stays that way then England take a 6VP lead into final match|pg||
nt|eamongall: England remain 90 imps ahead of scotland |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: all back and play resuming|pg||
nt|mowen: needing miracles I gather|pg||
nt|roswolf: a small swing likely for e/w|pg||
nt|sybarra: slams!   |pg||
nt|lestergold: well the lady'stactcis worked cant argue with taht|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will be fun|pg||
nt|roswolf: east opeming 1@S WOULS PROVIDE MAX EXCITEMENT|pg||
nt|rnc: 5@S on EW and 6@H NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: We had some specs earlier on wondering what country EBU were...|pg||
nt|mariner1: now the penultimate board of this session|pg||
nt|lestergold: par is 6s doubled one off|pg||
nt|rnc: Not surprised if ended in 7@S X|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: puppet presumably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think is a tossup whether east should bid|pg||
nt|viren169: probably 4@S by North now!|pg||
nt|james_h: 3/4 @d?|pg||
nt|mowen: another possible slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: think this is the ante-penultimate|pg||
nt|roswolf: bets on west's bid?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and i bet this is not played in par|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: that is a strong 12-14, not that it will matter here|pg||
nt|finch: Typical love all, strong club opening from East.|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6@s just needs 3-3 @s's|pg||
nt|rnc: or in some other contracts, of course...:)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mowen: 4@S cold for S&D|pg||
nt|viren169: Some thought it was in the EU!|pg||
nt|werge: Against 3 @H, it seems, that East has over-ruffed, where he shold´nt do it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 5@c thin but playable|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does howeard's double mean?|pg||
nt|finch: 1NT response forcing|pg||
nt|mowen: and west might bid it|pg||
nt|jallerton: "up to speed" = normal slow tempo!|pg||
nt|eamongall: he is not going to get any help in clubs so 3@Ss it is|pg||
nt|eamongall: and will be one off in about 17 seconds |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: lol, commentator's curse|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW might get overextended here|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was just the bid W wanted to hear|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has a play especially if he can ruff @S quickly|pg||
nt|rnc: Let's see|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: very hard opening lead problem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: u mean W?|pg||
nt|jallerton: take-out?|pg||
nt|ianrei: X is probably values without 3S|pg||
nt|lestergold: but only one suit left |pg||
nt|jallerton: so it shows a @d suit plus @s tolerance|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate nice splinter by west could get them to the thin but frigid club game|pg||
nt|petepunt: may struggle to 6@C now|pg||
nt|viren169: with it's own currency... know as EBU vouchers!|pg||
nt|viren169: some of you might have traded in that currency before!|pg||
nt|viren169: almost as strong as the Euro|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@H MUST BE A POSSIBILITY NOW|pg||
nt|lestergold: now west u must PASSSSS|pg||
nt|rnc: 5@C any?|pg||
nt|lestergold: another chance  oh......|pg||
nt|roswolf: re-open into slam - OUCH|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely west can calculate that a serious wheel has comeoff for theoppos|pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulg: small heart, hoping you can switch back to clubs?|pg||
nt|paulg: or @cQ followed by "doh!"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: everything but a diamond is a possibility, including heart Q|pg||
nt|paulg: it is a weak notrump, so less reason for @hQ than against a strong notrump|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W pushing N/S around here!|pg||
nt|chick: excellent contract if they find it|pg||
nt|mowen: poor effort by Brunner/Holland to play 4@S with 7 on a finesse|pg||
nt|roswolf: who will win the auction / they might well regret it!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: yes, especially since we see 18 and 19 counts opening 2nt these days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the death hand for south|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you get to pass the lead with four kings|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Playing Puppet, which allows you to announce a 5-card major, increases the odds a bit in favor of bidding with the W hand as there is more upside. but even then it is only close|pg||
nt|james_h: nothing makes|pg||
nt|sharkirl: good save when no x|pg||
nt|eamongall: if they get the bidding finished|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: the opening bid worked very well for EW|pg||
nt|mowen: 10 opposite 11|pg||
nt|finch: what was I saying about 11 opposite 11 = game earlier? |pg||
nt|viren169: Is 4@C splinter?|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe too many transportation issues in 4@H though|pg||
nt|werge: Have we seen any double in this set? For money...?|pg||
nt|rnc: here we go again|pg||
nt|roswolf: good bid now south must wake up|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ianrei: they need to duck a S at trick 1 to beat this|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: I think O'Gorman expected 3+ clubs opposite|pg||
nt|petepunt: 6@D will save a few imps|pg||
nt|mowen: don't know but should encourage south|pg||
nt|viren169: North will go on with those aces!|pg||
nt|roswolf: not likely i would say|pg||
nt|lestergold: double fit identified west will come to eat that 4s bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: another way to win by bidding is that E might have a 5-card minor, e.g. AQJxx of Diamonds, and then you could easily be on a finesse for game, or even better than that|pg||
nt|ianrei: to beat 5C anyway|pg||
nt|chick: scary though, will all those losers staring at you|pg||
nt|viren169: singleton x not good... |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: perhaps more--better chance heart king is in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: well hard for east to egt to excited with his hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4@c is surprising with no @d wastage|pg||
nt|jallerton: @d lead is a good start for the defence.  What's the best line?|pg||
nt|eamongall: well its not my fault those guys did not agree their defence to Unusual NT overcalls|pg||
nt|viren169: void good...|pg||
nt|mowen: 4@S seems cowardly - why not 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: automatic 6h bid now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianrei: I'm suprised East didn't bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but he is worried about his horrible holdings in the majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: it's not your fault Cooke & Garvey couldn't bid 6@h earlier!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|petepunt: seems normal with dbl fit here |pg||
nt|viren169: S wont play N for A of @C|pg||
nt|viren169: Now 6 for sure... and a small chance for 7...|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks 1 or 2 off|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In modern bidding there are mo penalty doubles on a lower level|pg||
nt|werge: What is going on - I continue @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: gremlins playing on west,s mind|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If N ruffs the 4th @d with @h10 E must overruff for -1|pg||
nt|werge: West seems confused, because declarer played the @D Jack from dummy...|pg||
nt|lestergold: double!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg: true|pg||
nt|eamongall: anyway 5 tricks off this so dow ntwo|pg||
nt|eamongall: two|pg||
nt|eamongall: Garvey and cooke could have bid 6@Hs ..they just never started|pg||
nt|bobh1: desperate men do desperate things|pg||
nt|mariner1: no way they were not playing @S, just dreaming in @H here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: if that is stood it will be the ultimatwe ping pong of errors|pg||
nt|rnc: I need some stronger than coffee now|pg||
nt|lestergold: wowowowo|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch x many|pg||
nt|lestergold: id even miss dinner for this excitement|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i prediced it would not be played in par but i could never have envisage dthis|pg||
nt|lestergold: could be massive impagte|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially with the spade overcall|pg||
nt|finch: interesting choice of swtich|pg||
nt|finch: ...and play from north....|pg||
pc|d2|nt|finch: but all not very interesting with the contract cold|pg||
nt|viren169: not a particularly good 7... on the odds|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cindy: im 100% for that holding to be in dummy when i lead the Q|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops now we could see down a lot|pg||
nt|mowen: not optimum|pg||
nt|ciaran: Club to Q now|pg||
nt|viren169: but if N has a voild @C like he has advertised... he must have K of @D!|pg||
nt|mowen: specs are saying 4@C was key card ask which explains 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: Ah...........|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3-3 @s's or JT tight|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ciaran: This will make for 5 imps to England|pg||
nt|ianrei: Nice play by North|pg||
nt|othered1: West reasonably took his time and worked things out correctly.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be most of the lead i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: best to draw trumps oh but there arent any to draw  sorry bad joke|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: especially if pd has the knave|pg||
nt|marlowepi: brb have to feed the parking meater|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - East shall discard, if so - and at least 1 down|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jallerton: If N ducks, E can stop the ruff by crossing and taking a @h finesse - not necessary in 4@c|pg||
nt|ianrei: too many D forces allow 5S tricks, 2C and a H|pg||
nt|jallerton: declarer could hope to elope all 3 small trumps in hand but would need defensive help|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: 15 minutes left, 2 and a half boards to play|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes - short entries for that|pg||
nt|jallerton: so if @h at trick 2, defence should play @h back|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petepunt: still thinking of !4S hand i suspect |pg||
nt|mowen: Denning will make this quickly|pg||
nt|lestergold: no scope for finding a way to go down|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|werge: The hesitation is enough - he had 8 m inutes to think about this|pg||
pc|s2|nt|finch: I think the @H2 at trick 1 must have been count, Cooke could see no future in a club switch if declarer had four diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: A swing here... the wrong way!|pg||
nt|othered1: This isn't a critical position for east, who will beat this by doing nothing aberrant|pg||
nt|roswolf: like the @SK now!?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ianrei: unlucky to be only worth an overtrick|pg||
nt|petepunt: may still be too many with @D break|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: a revoke!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think there may be a wailing and gnasjing of teeth in the post mortem|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: a slam game swing thats something|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: -1 without any options i think|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jallerton: as it is dec is play for 3-3 @s - perfectly reasonable|pg||
nt|petepunt: but k@S is right now|pg||
nt|petepunt: W must hold k@S on bidding after his pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E still has hopes on this one until next trick|pg||
pc|c3|nt|viren169: I'm not really taking sides!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|othered1: Tha was the only immediately losing play back, I think|pg||
nt|werge: 2 down with normal play - and a discard instead of overruff, probably loosing 1 @S, 2 @H and the 3 @D-tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mowen: England lost it in the open room|pg||
nt|petepunt: maybe not the wrong way :)|pg||
nt|viren169: Yes I agree...|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: hand on to spades north|pg||
nt|jallerton: or @C10x offside|pg||
nt|chick: I don't see any way to escape 1 more loser|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Daffyd still thinking|pg||
nt|chick: thinking is good ... when people on bbo whine about 'faster pls', I always remind them that bridge is all about thinking :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so its about a 40% slam that is off|pg||
nt|bobh1: S should have hit it|pg||
nt|bobh1: clearly his pd had a bullet|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lethal666: good X by south, otherwise north would definatly bid 5C or 5d|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: Aus plays South Africa in a one day game ( cricket )|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|petergill: Another diamond is best I think, but that defence is not obvious. |pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|petergill: On @CK lead, there is a show-up squeeze, so you don't even have to finesse in spades.  |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: EW are not a regular partnership. 3@S is intended by East as a cue bid, but might confuse West, who might expect it to be a splinter. |pg||
