nt|jallerton: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/lmteams.htm for system cards|pg||
nt|idc: I'm afraid we don't have published systems for the English team, so we'll either need to guess|pg||
nt|steshome: A slam to start with!|pg||
nt|jallerton: or some of them anyway|pg||
nt|idc: or use the encyclopedic knowledge of Sarah and Jeffrey |pg||

nt|mdgraham: veyr much so - plenty of room to find out more.Gave poor South no chance.|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: we'll be able to catch up on the results of them later (open the Movie box at the bottom right)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|tihas: still, N had described balanced hand and driven to slam, so there was a case of adding one more for the road, because S actually hadnt shown a lot in the bidding|pg||
nt|tihas: but its tough at the table to do so|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@d = less than 16 points, no 5 card or longer major|pg||
nt|tihas: I think N with balanced hand should have constrained to showing his values|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: NS play Acol, weak NT, Multi 2@d|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: too difficult - if partner jumps to the six-level, he should know what he is doing |pg||
nt|steshome: I thought E/W were playing a weak NT, but we might have a chance to find out soon|pg||
nt|jallerton: S had an interesting decision: pass, double, 3@h or 2NT|pg||
nt|idc: Fearless protecting at teams, vul v not|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|jallerton: Oh yes, I think you are right, Sarah.  Their 1NT rebid is 15-17!|pg||

nt|jallerton: as long as they haven't changed too much in the last six months!|pg||
nt|idc: The early boards in this match have been quite swingy|pg||
nt|idc: we don't know results at this table, but at the Open, England seem to have missed 3 slams in 5 boards|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb: 4N would not occur to me|pg||
nt|henryb: 1100 I stand corrected|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: would you double as West?|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes I would|pg||
pc|h9|nt|idc: If 1@c could be 11-13 bal, probably not|pg||
nt|jallerton: No, sorry to mislead you earlier, 1@c was natural or 15-17 balanced|pg||
nt|idc: but since that isn't what they play, i probably would|pg||
nt|steshome: Is that lead right?|pg||
nt|capercliff: ive never understood playing 1N natural here, but I suppose these days opp open and respond with anything|pg||
nt|capercliff: and N certainly has @h stopped|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: West consults system file for "Interference over Blackwood" section |pg||
nt|jallerton: It's a logical lead; E thinks that declarer has @cJxxx and partner may have a singleton|pg||
nt|idc: A lot like to play 2H natural there, so that would be an option|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|tihas: in desperate times like these, E might actually consider bidding 7@h all by himself after partner launches blackwood|pg||
nt|steshome: Yes reasonable shot|pg||
nt|capercliff: could it hurt to get count in @c first?|pg||
nt|jallerton: not a great success here, however.  I think a top club would be found by most people (rightly or wrongly)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|capercliff: good thing declarer doesnt have 7 top tricks now|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, Cliff, is partner has a singleton club|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@H+1 may be EW's best result. NS likely to save over a seven bid|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Bridge Association of Ireland)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jallerton: Maybe, Sarah, although the minor suit jacks help to make 6@h so good|pg||

nt|capercliff: interesting is that you kinda need both finesses to make 6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How many times did you win the LM, Sarah?|pg||
nt|capercliff: but 8x@d is helpful|pg||

nt|Walddk4: You using your toes too?|pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome: I don't know Roland.  I think six?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: tricky thing is not to touch @d and keep E from getting endplayed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: six is correct|pg||
nt|capercliff: is West worth another try?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Ah, so Roland was just testing!|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe 4@s?|pg||
nt|idc: I wonder if they have agreements over the dbl - would pass by East have been more serious try for example?|pg||
nt|idc: maybe it would just have shown some sort of control and 4@c denies one|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Your commentators for this match are Henry Bethe and Ed Shapiro (USA). I am Mike Graham (England).  |pg||
nt|idc: My theory: if you are gong to bother looking for a 4-4 @s fit with the North hand|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|capercliff: they are going to 6|pg||
nt|idc: and most would, how can it not be even better to look for a @c fit too?|pg||
mb|6C|nt|mdgraham: Our operaor is Raul Laasner (Estonia). |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|vugraphzme: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@s vul vs not is braver than I would be|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South knew what to expect, though |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: well done|pg||
nt|capercliff: 6@c is a fine bid|pg||
nt|steshome: I don't know why 6@c is difficult to reach|pg||
nt|capercliff: now just to make it|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jallerton: 12 imps coming to Scotland|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|othered1: West neatly (and rightly) avoided a 2-suited overcall.|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|henryb: I wonder whether a less brave call, such as pass, would have led to E-W missing this game|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jallerton: Thanks also to the CBAI (Paul Porteous and Eamon Galligan) for broadcasting the event.  Next set in 10 minutes or so.|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Looks like a normal 3NT making, so Scotland will be taking a small lead into the second half|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@D is not exactly holding back at this vulnerability  |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 20 rather, 9:55 local time|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: Sarah, Jeffrey and Ian will be back, so you are in good company, specs|pg||

nt|idc: all four pairs seemed a bit rusty so far, but now they'll be warmed up|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|henryb: I think the Estonians take the view: I paid my card fees and I did not pay them to pass!|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|jallerton: except that two of the 'warmed up' pairs may be asked to sit out!|pg||
nt|capercliff: not much to this hand, a quick claim after 2 rounds of @c|pg||
nt|jallerton: teams of 6|pg||
nt|capercliff: but good thing @c are 2-2|pg||
