pc|c4|nt|santyclz: Perfect trumps for a high x-ruff, difficult with 4333 however.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to avoid a crossruff in the defence, he must clean trumps|pg||

nt|viren169: Ummmmm, I think 2@D has taken clubs out of the auction!|pg||

mb|1C|nt|mrt2000: 7@C might make here|pg||
nt|granguru: just 3@D NS |pg||
nt|sharkirl: I think @D switch does beat it at trick 2|pg||
nt|sharkirl: 12 again|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|viren169: Interesting... just the hand I would bid 1@S on...|pg||
nt|santyclz: (ending,  not endplay)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: You was right Joe. He could make it, but in fact - it was the defence who made it|pg||
nt|granguru: 7@c might be |pg||
nt|granguru: none beated|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it´s forbidden to play a small from Jxxx |pg||
nt|sharkirl: 13 in sp|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|mb|3S|nt|viren169: Pass??????????????|pg||
nt|viren169: better...|pg||
nt|granguru: if @DA instead of small probably|pg||
nt|sharkirl: well it takes an extremely brave declarer not to play the @D A|pg||
nt|granguru: which all british are|pg||
nt|sharkirl: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: without any special reason|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Y, @c duck with those beautiful @ss was very strange.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|viren169: Now 2@S over 2@C should be normal... keeping North out of the auction (Not that he wants to come in!)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And you know your P @d|pg||
nt|starkist: hmm|pg||
nt|ralfwil: leading from a 10 or J often gives declarer a good help|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Looks like West was more worried about letting N in|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit that 2@S would always get me a singleton trump|pg||
nt|viren169: 8/9 tricks available here for a flat(ish) board|pg||
nt|sharkirl: can this be true??|pg||
nt|starkist: intended as forcing i'm sure|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkirl: would have thought so|pg||
nt|sharkirl: 4c is Walshe|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hQ|nt|mrt2000: either too much or not enough, it seems !|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not that easy pehaps |pg||
nt|starkist: or redwood|pg||
nt|mrt2000: "systemic misunderstanding" i SUSPECT|pg||
nt|eamongall: Adam Mesbur and Pat Walshe have had a miserable/unlucky  time this weekend |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|viren169: void for me!|pg||
nt|eamongall: Pat Walshe was called in at short notice as a replacement for the unavailable Nick Fitzgibbon so the lack partnership understanding and match fitness in Walshes case would  tell |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|viren169: it make more sense now!|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: well, if 3@S is not forcing, it ought to be |pg||
nt|viren169: 2@S shows clubs I am told...|pg||
nt|garnetts: 7@D not the nine too I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have just been advised that 2@S shows clubs too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and take your 5 tricks in the defence as soon  as possible|pg||
nt|santyclz: Too much @d duplication.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|granguru: confusion because W passed primarily|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|nt|garnetts: They clearly play transfers after 1NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In fact @dQ is better than @dK, You have no other choise than finessing|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eamongall: this will be draw trumps ....and test @Ds for the overtrick|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: sorry all, I need to go. enjoy the rest of the match. See you all tomorrow.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now he must find the @h!|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@S with the odds, just|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|viren169: David, You will have to learn some of these systems if you playing in the Gold Cup!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|granguru: bye Mike|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|garnetts: So I owe them an apology and thanks for telling me |pg||
pc|s5|nt|mrt2000: see ya|pg||
nt|eamongall: Adam mesburs fastest hand |pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|granguru: 10 tricks any return|pg||
nt|granguru: E should claim|pg||
nt|granguru: sorry..he doesnt know yet about the @D distribution|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c2|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|garnetts: I want people to play complex systems --tires them out|pg||
pc|h6|nt|viren169: I am sure they will forgive you!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d3|nt|eamongall: ruff last @D good|pg||

nt|ralfwil: no @h ruff?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Exactly the wrong hand for an unusual nt in my opinion, but worked very well.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Maybe that's why they're playing and I'm watching.|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: Meanwhile EBU have passed the century deal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a 50% 5@c will fail on a loosing @s finess|pg||
nt|eamongall: century imps total|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sharkirl: H plays well|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but there is a good @h contract on EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Very little actually|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 10 P and partner has opened in vulnerable|pg||
nt|eamongall: thats another poor effort by Walsh O Gorman ...the 30 point deck never came to light |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|garnetts: There is an issue with the alert system--sometimes it is a real alert and sometimes you do need to know|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@H seems enough here (or the equivalent)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: was P on N correct?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkn: no x|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 2@D is more hearts...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|mrt2000: straightforward 3NT|pg||
nt|viren169: now 2N=clubs?|pg||
nt|viren169: are they in GF now? or can it be dropped at the 3@H level?|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@c looks like a @D transfer|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 1 off here as like as not|pg||
pc|c7|nt|santyclz: The lead suggests that 2@hs may have shown 2 suits such as @hs and a minor.|pg||
nt|granguru: so the lead is clear|pg||
pc|c6|nt|granguru: around 10 tricks|pg||
nt|granguru: @Dk to maintain the lead!|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mrt2000: 11 now, perhaps|pg||
pc|d7|nt|viren169: It is nat and Invite now... with 6 hearts...|pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure West will be pleased to see a diamond or two in dummy!|pg||
nt|granguru: and cross @cs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|garnetts: I think East should bid 3@D after 2NT--but then again I am old fashioned why let partner know you have short hearts and a six card suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Once again. the whole highway open...|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|viren169: still only 8 tricks available...|pg||
nt|eamongall: there is argueably 11 tricks available |pg||
nt|eamongall: @H and @S to lose|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|garnetts: is it me or did a spade lead seem obvious here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a careful play is needed. He doesn´t know that @hA is singleton|pg||
nt|sharkirl: need  to play H or S immed|pg||
pc|c5|nt|granguru: btw the revoke cost 4 imps t oNI|pg||
pc|c2|nt|granguru: mmmm|pg||
nt|eamongall: sorry I just looked at the losers ....|pg||
nt|eamongall: but as often ..to my cost ...there is deeper stuff to be found ..|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|viren169: I would have a led a spade too...|pg||
nt|granguru: W was looking for a ruff |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sharkirl: 1ha and @H to king|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c3|nt|eamongall: won't be long now |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|granguru: and maintained his @d entry|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|granguru: to give e 2 ruffs!|pg||
nt|mrt2000: but could still take tha @DA before the second @C, as he has a @S entry|pg||
nt|granguru: I suppose you wrote that before you read mi last line|pg||
nt|mrt2000: true !   :)|pg||

nt|granguru: y|pg||
nt|mrt2000: N couldn't handle to @S successfully|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: A demonstration of why leads matter --a spade and dec has no play |pg||
nt|santyclz: X or whatever shows the majors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: good lead problem!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|garnetts: 1@S?  |pg||
mb|d|nt|viren169: N/S may lose their heart fit now...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Probably lebensohl.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|granguru: except that it is played by West|pg||
nt|viren169: 1@S denies spades I guess|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|granguru: As it will here|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: and 1N probably show spades... to right side the NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: That is an example of what I mean by an alert being necessary|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As I play I can show a 1-card major (defined) and another 4-card suit, so we can find our 5-4 in @s|pg||
pc|sK|nt|granguru: A @D lead beats 4@H |pg||
nt|viren169: North has done well to introduce hearts!|pg||
nt|granguru: this contract will probably fail|pg||
nt|eamongall: EBU vouchers are great ... you can buy bridge books from Brian Senior |pg||
pc|s8|nt|granguru: a @D lead could  help declarer a lot|pg||
nt|mrt2000: it will make on a red suit lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|garnetts: well done North |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
