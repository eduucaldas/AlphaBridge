pc|s2|nt|snorris: hi Gad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's very expensive on repeated hearts taps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe a trump would have been even better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It would I think|pg||
nt|snorris: west must raise @ds|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because only by cross-ruffing can declarer come to tricks|pg||

nt|bridge_one: K in @C was for sure in West, so A in @D don't need|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Antoff is originate from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|athene: but when BOTH your menaces are blocked, it all works out|pg||
nt|junka: 11 imps for Peirao.... good start|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: no games here (best defense) however someone could be in one|pg||
nt|athene: so sometimes two wrongs do make a right :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Please check that result, operator.  It looked as if they took 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|glen: spec smartly notes that on last hand, if no @D by opp, draw trumps play @S ace and another and now opps forced to open up @Ds|pg||
nt|junka: looks like 4@h n/s...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bedap: 1S?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bedap: pass?|pg||
nt|mayors: EW probably heading for 3NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: E/W play standard 5 majors|pg||
nt|leao: yes, it did look like 9 tricks for me too|pg||
nt|glen: whether N bids 4@H or not depends on the quality hand N can expect for S's red-vs-white 3@H bid|pg||
nt|junka: or 3Nt by e/w? lol|pg||
mb|1N|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Santy|pg||

nt|mariner1: lunch|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: ok|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Markku|pg||

nt|santyclz: Negative x's over weak 2s?|pg||

nt|santyclz: Came just in time for an exciting hand.|pg||
nt|mariner1: u want to help?|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: but really it comes down to north's @H10 and @h9|pg||
nt|leao: 3@C should be N bid|pg||
nt|leao: lots of time to bid @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: we got all the way up there|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Markku.|pg||
nt|athene: if north just had @HJxxx then 6@H would be very bad|pg||
nt|athene: and @HJ10xx it wouldn't be great|pg||
nt|leao: if they are serious bidders, they wont bid it|pg||
nt|leao: 4@s or 5@c for NS but not 5@S|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: I hate to pass with !xx support|pg||
nt|bedap: maybe just 2S as South but same result|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Axx|pg||
nt|mayors: Nice diamond position for declarer here. He can't get them wrong|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3n plays well with the KQ @D doubletom|pg||
nt|mariner1: everything except @S set well here|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D probably "waiting", often staymanic|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5@c now should be a q in support of @ds and/or @ss.|pg||
nt|glen: Mello doubles 5@D, but really wanted to double 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|junka: good save....|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it's certainly hard to get there|pg||
nt|athene: north knows his @SK and @DQJ are facing shortage and might not be worth much|pg||
nt|leao: 4@h cold the other way, if bid|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: and he doesn't have much in the way of keycards|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bridge_one: probably @H, and @C for A in the dummy, now @D verussu A for small and K, after A in @D for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: joe :)|pg||
nt|leao: 3@d is indeed waiting|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bedap: Tully will think about 4-1 trump breaks|pg||
nt|mariner1: off 1|pg||
nt|leao: 12 tricks if normal play. next, please|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C would make too on the fortunate club break - if you take the right view in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: you only have one entry to dummy in 6@C (@SK) so you have to decide whether to lead a small heart from hand first (which works on the layout) or go to dummy and lead the @HJ first ...|pg||
nt|athene: (which would work if east had the doubleton heart honour)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bridge_one: this is a error|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mayors: playing on the black suits works as well|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|santyclz: E takes out an expensive insurance policy.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h3|nt|bridge_one: can make 3Nt guessing to move J in @C|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|leao: ok... 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mariner1: well not attacking @D 2st will cost|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|mariner1: 1st|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|bedap: The BOURKE team has no Margaret Bourke, she's NPC|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bridge_one: this line isn't so bad - if K in @s out then K in @C problably in finesse ...|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bedap: Maybe also for Brazil|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|mayors: except he needed 3 @c tricks but was ok here with the singleton T|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@S good spot for NS here|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @cs even better e-w|pg||

nt|mariner1: a Roland 20 - 20 hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: someone have 12?|pg||

nt|Rafa: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps 5@D|pg||
nt|santyclz: Profiles of some of the players (I'm told):|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: http://www.bridge.esp.br/player/leaocarvalho.php (leão again)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|bedap: Hard to find hearts now|pg||
nt|mariner1: no games here.......|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the 3rd rarest contract(after ppp and 1 @C)|pg||
nt|leao: 5@d is there for the asking|pg||
nt|athene: not many hcp but everything is working hard|pg||
nt|leao: @s and a minor, 5-5 at least|pg||
nt|santyclz:   http://www.bridge.esp.br/player/sergioaranha.php|pg||
nt|glen: 4@S does okay even if just 14 high card points|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: she's on lead|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: shouldn't be too hard to find them|pg||
nt|bedap: Good decision not to double the cold 2S|pg||
nt|mariner1: no making games though someone could be shoved up|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass in North may be too much timide|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bridge_one: probably N/S play level 2 forcing|pg||
nt|mayors: I would have bid 1nt on the first round as north|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes NV vs VUL he might have risk 2@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N would be sandwich or strong for most.........|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt however not so bad - now need to guess|pg||
nt|athene: you might even make 12 tricks perhaps|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mayors: not after partner has opened|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh I am nutz...... S opened 1@H :)|pg||
nt|mayors: now double is penalties|pg||
nt|mariner1: this one should be off quick|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N lebensohl asking for 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard to diagnose the great fit|pg||
nt|athene: the key is that north has a singleton club facing a weak suit|pg||
nt|athene: south doesn't have anything like @CK,@CQ, @CJ wasted|pg||
nt|athene: you can never know this in the bidding - when partner bids a suit you tend to assume he has strength there|pg||
nt|junka: good|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Both have the death holding, 3 small in the opps suit.|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|mayors: after the first round pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: now 3@H to play|pg||
nt|leao: rite u are|pg||
nt|athene: hence north just makes a limit raise|pg||
nt|leao: ...but no cigar... any way of making 11 tricks?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bedap: find the cold 4H ...|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes this would be penalties|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s Dbl isnt easy to beat|pg||
nt|athene: and clearly south has dead minimum and passes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|glen: with the @D ace onside, 5@C will roll home|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|vugrapha2: that will be hard|pg||
nt|athene: you can come to 12 tricks by pitching a heart on spade and ruffing hearts good, reversing dummy|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H @H ruff @c lead 3rd @H|pg||
nt|mayors: with 9 cards in @c NS have much less defense than they think|pg||
nt|glen: in the open room, NS never bid @Ss|pg||
pc|s3|nt|leao: Aranha will have to play for @d Ax with W|pg||
pc|s4|nt|junka: @d ace  on side.. and !j too... but...|pg||

pc|d3|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|bedap: Maybe 2D over 1NT as a start?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mariner1: yes and a trump loser too|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: well this line works same|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|h6|pg||

pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Markku M. Mäkelä from Finland|pg||

mb|4H|nt|mariner1: he has big NT with a big NT on his left which reduces his hand value and increases|pg||

mb|p|nt|glen: on the last board, perhaps there was a break-in-tempo over 4@S by W?|pg||

mb|p|nt|bedap: weak jump but North might invite|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@H down with correct counterplay|pg||
nt|leao: that shud make|pg||
nt|athene: these artificial overcalls of 1NT can cause problems if you haven't discussed things thoroughly|pg||
nt|leao: 1NT = 5+ @s|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mmmakela: THAT is dangerous|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 4 weak @S seems very dangerous|pg||
nt|santyclz: But it was the only suit he didn't have anything in so was required.|pg||
nt|reisig: showed his solid @d holding?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N EW here|pg||
nt|leao: should make either 4 Major|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: steady does it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NS has nice fit in blacks but sacs expensive|pg||
nt|reisig: @s ..I meant|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to just double to show "values" but the important thing is:- what do subsequent doubles and bids mean?|pg||
nt|leao: shud x again|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1nt?  They must invert the 1@s and 1nt responses.|pg||
nt|santyclz: The so-called Kaplan Inversion.|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: we can see 6@H is a nice spot, but for both tables EW didn't have any bidding space to sort that out|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: 2N transfer to @D|pg||
nt|athene: he might cue 3@H if there's any danger of double being misunderstood|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 2 dias hazardous if passed|pg||
nt|mayors: Many would X 1 @h  as south|pg||
nt|mariner1: the I don't have these, do you call :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but there they are !!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|leao: that works too|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mayors: seems like east should have made a forcing rebid...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be 2@D too much conservative - here would need any conv ... In italy it is much used 2Nt (giving 6@H/4 strong)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or rather bid 1 @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@C could be accept|pg||
nt|glen: nice play by S to hold back the @C J here|pg||

nt|athene: the defence can't hurt this contract with the clubs coming in|pg||
nt|athene: although it's not trivial for declarer actually|pg||
nt|athene: he can't unblock @CAK, draw trumps then reach dummy with a diamond|pg||

nt|leao: 5@c is a good sac, -300|pg||

nt|bridge_one: however playing natural 2@H is obliged over 2@D - pass with J in @D, one K and doubleton in @H and @C can be dangerous|pg||

nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but he had perfect cards 4 dbl...|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe they reverse the meaning of 2@S and DBL then|pg||

nt|mariner1: NS make 4@H if the get that high,,,,,,,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mayors: from declarer's point of view it was pretty unlikely south had QJ doubleton given he knew the AK @h were split, so i'm not surprised he got @s wrong|pg||

nt|mariner1: NS in 3N|pg||
nt|leao: wow|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard for the defence to realise they should just be drawing trumps and claiming :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: A violation of Burn's Rule of 8.|pg||
nt|junka: Mello,the shining...:) 4@h denies @d Ace??|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugrapha2: 30 imps isn't much over 16boards, so standbyfor action!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW can save in 4@S if the 4@H is reached|pg||
nt|bridge_one: without singleton and vuln South could open also 2@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so the UGLY dbl was the winner|pg||
nt|mmmakela: all cards foul|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes however it is an 18|pg||
nt|mariner1: another hand where some one could get shoved too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: the weak NT will slow EW down...... so its up to NS to rise here|pg||
nt|leao: Ns limit is 2@s|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: the thing is, to beat a low-level contract, you need to think as though you are the one playing the hand|pg||
nt|athene: so for example to beat 1@D you need to make 1@D your way|pg||
nt|santyclz: Rule of 8:  subtract the number of aces held by the opponents from 8, and *don't* bid to that level.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: and that might well involve drawing trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|mayors: 2 @S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|glen: here's why I like support doubles - if South's pass of 2@H denies 3@S, N knows not to compete over 3@H|pg||

nt|mmmakela: rightsided|pg||
mb|p|nt|junka: opps too high|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@S perhaps giving GF with both minors and half control in @S ... i would use DBL - 2@S only with 3 cards in @H|pg||

pc|h2|pc|c4|nt|bridge_one: probably a misunderstand about 25 in @S|pg||

nt|athene: 24 hcp and 4-4 hearts...borderline whether you bid game on these, NV|pg||
nt|athene: personally i would just bid game with south, with two tens|pg||

nt|leao: if declarer finds her, he has a good chnce for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|leao: 4@h is the limit for EW|pg||
nt|junka: maybe 3NT...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bridge_one: yes - strange the return @S without a bad distribution of @H|pg||
nt|athene: he will surely try a minor which finds that queen for declarer|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3D|nt|mmmakela: right|pg||
nt|dburn: it is possible that Thomson actually showed an even number of spades, in order to get Brightling to do what he did|pg||

nt|leao: theyll bid it, it seems|pg||
nt|athene: well it's a chance for Aloi to get on the scoreboard :)|pg||
nt|junka: good bidding by Mello|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: S has an interesting choice to make here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: chooses DBL without 4@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@h must be a double negative.  This demonstrates one of the problems with this approach.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: danger 9if NS can lead a @d against 5@S |pg||
nt|bedap: 30 imps needed in 16 boards ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: manageable|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: in fact, easy|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: the only problem is making sure they are all yours!|pg||
nt|dburn: and I suppose declarer might have read it, but it would be a bit silly to go down by running into a desperately unlucky 3-2 break|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 @H seems doomed again|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mmmakela: now splinter then easy|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N lebensohl asking for 3@C|pg||
nt|glen: could W find a @C lead now?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|glen: nope|pg||
nt|glen: now S will get surprised if @H ace, and then @D to Q|pg||
nt|junka: taf... no entries...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bedap: perhaps Giura needed to double|pg||
nt|athene: come on! they don't give you a game bonus for 3@H|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|mariner1: takes 2@S and a @D switch|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bridge_one: there are the possibility to make a mistake by E/W|pg||
nt|mmmakela: remote one|pg||
nt|mariner1: (I think)|pg||
nt|mariner1: no invitational|pg||
nt|athene: well done|pg||
nt|leao: yes... conservative move from chagas|pg||
nt|athene: now you just have to make ten tricks|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugrapha2: she perhaps felt embarassed about the quality of her 2nd "suit"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, very remote |pg||
nt|mariner1: @S 3@H and wait for the @c|pg||
nt|leao: ace of @h @h on lead... no|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bedap: still, this will be fun to play|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: acttually, the communication problems on this hand are grievous|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: needs trumps to break|pg||
nt|santyclz: Which one is relaying?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: don't like 2 NT, why not supp dias|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: well the trump lead gives some hope however still should be off|pg||
nt|mariner1: both|pg||
nt|mariner1: so good defense beats this|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mmmakela: ok relays|pg||
nt|santyclz: S is.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bridge_one: with lead @S was more easy to make a mistake in counterplay|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S is an asking relay......... 2n shows extras|pg||
nt|mmmakela: were no alerts|pg||
nt|santyclz: Although in this case it doesn't matter.  Usually having the strong hand concealed is of some value.|pg||
nt|leao: should be 1 down|pg||
nt|leao: yes 2@h is 0-5 |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mariner1: only chance if give up a @c and hope K and @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: now it can make depending|pg||
nt|leao: but not an ace|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mariner1: the key was not setting up the @S pitch|pg||
pc|d3|nt|santyclz: 4@s ace asking?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugrapha2: and since they don't, nothing good can happen with the 3-3 @H|pg||
nt|bedap: when she didn't double, east may have assumed diamonds as her second|pg||
nt|bedap: 2S = 5-4 spades & minor|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I think , from the 5@D bid, that that is right|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: but then, East perhaps needed toshowvalues, to make the X easier|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice switch.......|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|bedap: didn't need this, needed +500 vs 5Cx|pg||

pc|h2|pc|sJ|pc|c7|pg||

nt|athene: (@SK, two hearts, club, @DK)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N has a shot|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: pass works too|pg||

nt|mariner1: board 20 was a 14 imp swing and Thomson off to the races...........|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|athene: it all depends what 1@C - 2@D means|pg||
nt|leao: tough hand, but 3NT wasn't making either|pg||

nt|mariner1: they can make 5@D however can they bid it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: that @S slam was also off with a @D lead.........  in short they needed to take an entry|pg||

nt|bridge_one: i think they will bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers are right, lots of ways to beat than slam......|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't put all the blame on s.  I think n contributed by not playing the @hq.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bedap: preferably not fit-showing|pg||
nt|mariner1: slam possibly bid NS however K@H and As off means can be set|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugrapha2: well, if it draws a pass from East then it's great|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW might help shove them into it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: reads will be set|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H is an interesting opener by S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: must specifically show 5 5+ in minors?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bridge_one: the overcall of 1@S help to call game|pg||

nt|glen: on wait, i got my suit symbols wrong, weak in @Ds|pg||
nt|glen: hold fireworks|pg||
nt|glen: 2@H could be a relay, showing a hand too good to bid 2@D waiting (since that would be passed by weak two in @Ds)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 2 @S now?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bedap: 11 IMPs|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|mmmakela: would S bid stronger if HQ were HA?|pg||
nt|dburn: North's sequence is OK - once South does not rebid 2@c, 3NT may well not be the right spot|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|athene: 3@D was a "transfer", just showing 5 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: even though west has already bid the suit, transfers are still useful|pg||
nt|athene: west can use it to sign off in 3@H for example, or offer choice of games (as here)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|leao: EW makes 5@c|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with KQx in @C in South, and Jx in @h, 3Nt are safe - 5@d no|pg||

nt|mariner1: Thomson team extending their lead so far....|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: bec 1Nt conv|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@C garbage stayman|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bedap: North have plenty of stuff here so -110 vs 2H at other table was a steal|pg||

nt|mariner1: - Teams|pg||
nt|glen: 2@H promises @S plus minor, so 2@S is a raise in @Hs - game invite or better|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: what to bid with teh North hand though?|pg||
nt|bedap: i lke pass but bid 2NT over 2H as South|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I might bid 2Nt as South, assuing 15-17|pg||
nt|bedap: 2D = standard multi|pg||
nt|leao: aloi might have ducked the @d|pg||
nt|athene: south can't be happy about passing 4@H but it's surely the percentage action when partner couldn't say anything over 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|leao: 4@s for e/w|pg||
nt|glen: some might have bid 3@S over 2@H|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|dburn: still, perhaps the overcall caused him to write off that @sQ|pg||
nt|dburn: after all, how could he know that his side was about to make four spade tricks?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H 3@H isn't the best choose - with 4@S np to bid Dbl at 1Nt and bid @H after|pg||

nt|athene: right|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bedap: making now i think|pg||

nt|mariner1: well they made 3N on the hand played here in 3sDBL|pg||
nt|leao: 5@d if ty t for it|pg||
nt|athene: an unusual auction in the other room, but nothing too unreasonable, i suppose|pg||
nt|glen: an agressive 6@S in the open room failed |pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: yes, lead @H - with lead @S was down|pg||
nt|leao: they tryfor it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|bedap: 2C Aspro|pg||
nt|dburn: was that the real auction at the other table?|pg||
nt|mariner1: neither 3N nor 4@S makes here..... too much off and poor breaks|pg||
nt|athene: you might consider the south hand is too "in between" for 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: if you play it as weak or strong|pg||
nt|athene: so you start with 2@D and bid clubs next|pg||
nt|glen: if trumps had been picked up it would have made|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|bedap: NS may stop short now|pg||
nt|athene: of course, you might not be able to use Part 2 of your plan|pg||
nt|athene: below the 5-level :)|pg||
nt|leao: awkward situation now...|pg||
nt|glen: 3@C is some sort of raise here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mariner1: 11 opposite a good 14 leads to some game often|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 @S sure seems a strange spot|pg||
nt|mariner1: a violation of Burn's Law too|pg||
nt|mmmakela: OR bidding sure ain't right|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt have many chance to be make|pg||
nt|leao: 5@c?|pg||
nt|athene: hard decision here, i think...pass or 5@C? i suppose you pass|pg||
nt|leao: 7@h is a lucky make for NS (with that lovely @d Q behaving)|pg||
mb|d|nt|bedap: status of 2D unclear|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|leao: 5@c = 1 ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws   in case David here|pg||
nt|mariner1: has forgotten his laws :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: brave 3 nt|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think it is impossible to beat this 3Nt|pg||
nt|junka: 3@c= 4+@s 12+ with +sing/void... 3@d= asks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well the @H lead allows 3N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but with @C lead it is the same - easy to leave the communications between N/S|pg||
nt|sybarra: we headed to 4 @S?  or?|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Bermuda Bowl is in Brazil this year|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure 4 @S makes|pg||
nt|athene: but that south hand doesn't really want a major suit to be trumpsd|pg||
nt|leao: this makes as cards are|pg||
nt|leao: opportunity for aloi|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|santyclz: Maybe 3nt after the overcall warned about breaks.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S has play even with the bad breaks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mmmakela: 4 @S could be right on several layouts after this bidding|pg||
nt|mayors: yes can be made on any lead|pg||
nt|mayors: 3nt that is|pg||
nt|athene: there are only 2 obvious losers|pg||
nt|junka: 3nt= sing/void @h|pg||
nt|camacho: good lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugrapha2: i think I'd hit that if I need 30 imps|pg||
nt|bedap: must have some chance|pg||
nt|mariner1: K@H on, Q@D on|pg||
nt|athene: (black aces)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H makes so 4@S good save|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think declarer can get rid of all those club losers|pg||
nt|athene: you can put a lot of pressure on east though|pg||
nt|leao: wud have to risk @h finesse|pg||
nt|athene: if you run this to dummy, lead a club to the @CK, then return to @HA and lead another club|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is, even if east rises, he can give west a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: @D643 are good enough over the @D2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mmmakela: well if supp dbls in use 3 nt has more merit|pg||
pc|c7|nt|leao: :))|pg||
nt|athene: actually when an honour appears from west on the first club, east can safely duck the second club|pg||
pc|cK|nt|santyclz: With the @ds sitting so prettily even the @s break isn't enough to set it.  The big question is whether you can work out beer.|pg||
nt|junka: good lead|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: only if you need the beer |pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: sneaky @S play|pg||
nt|mariner1: the PABF is in Macau this year|pg||
nt|athene: either partner is ruffing or he has the other honour|pg||

mb|1S|nt|bridge_one: 4@H for E/W here - i suppose they will call|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of this session....... next session in 56 minutesper|pg||
nt|mariner1: schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set|pg||
nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sybarra: this auction will not be the same at this table|pg||
nt|mariner1: I suspect the 3N will be the same though|pg||
nt|sybarra: lets see |pg||
nt|glen: you didn't think we could get another double digit swing did you?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bedap: here's a chance for HAVAS|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bedap: that's ok|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N certainly was not the spot as in Open|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 nt in OR needed the dias guess|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N is not automatic though|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N ban make NS if they bid it|pg||
nt|mariner1: can make|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Interesting discussion in the Open room on what 2@C now shows...|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: and what does S do now,   transfer to @D |pg||
nt|mariner1: S passed as he has a tweener.........|pg||
nt|sybarra: good for Gold |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a minimum with long clubs...it's a question of HOW minimum|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mmmakela: and some more|pg||
nt|sybarra: easier just to blast into it |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: @d dont behave so nice |pg||
nt|mariner1: too weak to force and he wants N to describe his hand   they probably use DBL as|pg||
nt|mariner1: weak neg there|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like it showed a min here hence a pass by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: for sick bids, I love opening the N hand 1NT - since it can then pass partner's stayman bid (p-p-1NT-p-2@C-all pass)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well done.... careful play makes|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to play @H for 1 loser|pg||
nt|ferlema: obviamente la mano no se puede ganar|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mmmakela: S has auto duck|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if south duck the K in @h can beat 4@H|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|bedap: not right to draw trumps|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mariner1: saved and entry to dummy in @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: an entry|pg||
nt|mariner1: the @H lead helps or hurts depending on what N does|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: the played it right|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good try, I think only a @c had a real chance.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|glen: of course in reality it goes p-p-1NT-p-3NT-p-p-Double and -1100|pg||
pc|sA|nt|viren169: Yes how min?!?!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mariner1: needs to lead @S to j|pg||
nt|sybarra: so where is trick  9?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mariner1: easy from here.......|pg||
nt|athene: does it say "i have almost a psyche, wish i hadn't opened"?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|santyclz: Well he now has an entry to his @ss.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bedap: just 200 now|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the @s suit, since @hs are 4-4.|pg||

nt|leao: yes|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c3|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bedap: drawing trumps killed Wests S8|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that much for my autoduck|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mariner1: no % in ducking a @S lead from S|pg||
nt|camacho: I think @c or @hA and @H breaks 4@h|pg||

nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|bedap: who owns the 5-level?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: fastest at least(no pre-copypastes,right?)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: I'll never tell (except see that link as I already told)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if weak opening I detest it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: books say the opponents|pg||
nt|camacho: I don´t like to pass with 6 of minor when I can open with 3|pg||
nt|athene: now east might go 3@D transfer?|pg||

nt|mariner1: worldwide!|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: This one is pretty reasonable, all it takes is a 3-2 @h break and no ruff on opening lead.  7nt just needs the break.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh but poor declarer never gets to dummy   |pg||

pc|dK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D return|pg||
nt|mmmakela: any after 2 hearts|pg||

nt|camacho: almost same bidding|pg||
