mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: I have been in much worse|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Me too!!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Of course the nt slam is a little more chancy.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D   4@S  perhaps|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I am surprised NS did not preempt a bit more vigorously|pg||
nt|werge: South should bid 3 @s over 2 @C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yet at least!|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4432 and 5431 are not great distributions for preempting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D now is natural, forcing and slammish. Not sure what Simonsen is thinking about|pg||
nt|santyclz: Probably the best "preempt" would have been for n to have opened.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Interesting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Long huddle before 5@D, then a raise to 6??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If that is how it was, I don't like it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Thats what I meant|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: As long as he leads 2 rounds of trump his x will be genius.|pg||
nt|werge: To me, 2 @D is the best bid from West after 2@C!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They should beat this|pg||
nt|thegarve:  they did well to put the brakes on the "Swan" hand|pg||
nt|thegarve:  this could easily slip home|pg||
nt|Walddk2: really?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|thegarve:  hmm and odd lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, even|pg||
nt|thegarve:  a Swan hand is a 7-4 shape|pg||

nt|werge: This is the BIGGIST 1 NT I´have seen, since the Goren (16-18) days - the hand is BY FAR too strong|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: According to the Kaplan & Rubens Hand Evaluator, the North hand is too good for 1NT. It's worth 18.5|pg||
