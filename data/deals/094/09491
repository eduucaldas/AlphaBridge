nt|snorris: 1@h-1@s, 4@h...|pg||

nt|mariner1:  http://www.bridge.ee/MV/AB-tln.htm - Tournament site|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: a grand slam for breakfast|pg||
nt|snorris: yes!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: thought about 4@S by W|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was Cherry  Blossom festival weekend |pg||
nt|snorris: where ?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|garnetts: 5@D is clearly the best contract--but even that may be too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting pass for S|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Everyone|pg||
nt|snorris: -3  too much|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true|pg||
nt|snorris: first double not negative?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: it was; alert was too late:)|pg||
nt|snorris: and no neg double from north?|pg||
nt|sybarra: if S can cue the @D early.....off to the races |pg||
mb|2N|nt|garnetts: Sometimes this sort of pre-emptive tactics help declarer  in the play|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi George|pg||
nt|daman: this should end the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: we start off with an everyday grand|pg||
nt|col3435: do you think it points out the diamond situation here?|pg||
nt|garnetts: The heart position will force west to unguard the Kxx of spades because the Q@H acts as a squeeze xard|pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess NS do not use forcing NT,,, maybe polish @c or similar?|pg||
nt|daman: unless East takes a view|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|xenya: wondering if they get there -- it's certainly possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: 4@S should be cue with @C as trumps|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho there are only 2 visible losers in 5c, 11 winners may well prove dfficult if they reach it|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Avram|pg||
nt|snorris: this is too cheep|pg||
nt|snorris: only 300|pg||
nt|garnetts: unusual to make a shortgage cue in a suit you opened :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a simple 4@S to  restart with|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: re and sorry about that|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Cornelia |pg||
nt|snorris: hi Cornelia|pg||
nt|sybarra: now what does south bid?|pg||
nt|snorris: looks like cue-bidding|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @d|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H might reassure partner of no heart losers|pg||
mb|3D|nt|garnetts: I think dec will not get the @D position right--the 3@H will ensure that---I am afraid I would have bid 4@H which would have been a better indication|pg||
nt|col3435: yes|pg||
nt|garnetts: Still we have stopped short for some reason|pg||
nt|garnetts: North can't have much faith in his partner's bidding or card play lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: dummy lost its @s 4 and now looking for it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: imo an example how easy it is bto disrupt a big 1@C by opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: to|pg||
nt|jaapfr: wlc david|pg||
nt|snorris: dont think north liked that|pg||
mb|3S|nt|garnetts: I suppose 2@S was non-forcing |pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: 5@D = 4 KC with @C trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: but it's seldom easy to bid a grand based on long, well-fitting suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: they are thee!|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge.ee/MV/abkoos09.htm - Convention Cards|pg||
nt|snorris: a chanse for 500 if east misguesses @cs|pg||

nt|Walddk4: N-S are from Latvia, E-W from Estonia|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: pity|pg||
nt|josj: you were right, Vladimir...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: with @H 5-1 the @D finesse is needed in 7 but it would have been an excellent contract|pg||
nt|xenya: quick claim i suppose|pg||
nt|snorris: north liked it plenty|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|nt|josj: no sign of it yet...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jaapfr: down 1 can now|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: the bad breaks are of course the problem here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: ruffi8ng finesses of hearts looks like a vuiable line|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jaapfr: Monte Carlo leading the pack now?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 11 tricks |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||

nt|mariner1: openers.... many have|pg||
pc|d7|nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes almost inevitably |pg||

nt|figb_rama: spiega Tony|pg||
nt|katar: secondo me sta pensando cosa muovere dopo|pg||
nt|100dog: noi vediamo 52 carte|pg||
nt|katar: se anticipare il taglio a fiori oppure giocare quadri e picche dal morto o ancora se scartare la picche sulla seconda quadri|pg||
nt|100dog: l'A@S deve essere piazzato...condizione essenziale|pg||
nt|toniemme: lisciare il ritorno a @H sarebbe logico solo in presenza di QJ terzi o più in ovest che è sotto probabilità..|pg||

nt|vugraphzmf: roheline lammas is playing against druva now|pg||
mb|2C|nt|josj: another near-slam but this time it will fail|pg||

nt|mariner1: 4@S EW|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @h the limit|pg||

nt|snorris: 10 tricks in @cs here|pg||
nt|snorris: no game on|pg||
mb|2H|nt|xenya: this also looks slammy, but they'd better stay out of it, it seems |pg||
mb|d|nt|jaapfr: or 2@S:)|pg||
nt|snorris: 3@h is my bid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if pass now np for ew|pg||
nt|garnetts: If 2@S gets round to east he may balance with 3@C |pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|col3435: I don't know whether these 1@c bids are "strong" clubs or something else - anyone have any information?|pg||
nt|snorris: not double|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: seems the player listens to you:)|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H now or does not listen?|pg||
nt|snorris: not enough for 4 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: he is on the other side of the screen... so might not:)|pg||
nt|snorris: max too tricks for declerer|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think North should bid |pg||
nt|jaapfr: scared by red i suppose|pg||
nt|jaapfr: S will pass|pg||
nt|snorris: now s has to bid..|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: how many C's?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|xenya: too much duplication in @Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the wasted qj of clubs is compensatwed for by the nfavourable position of the spade ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: did he buy it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: opening lead most probably a @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is likley to be flat 4h a completely normal papa mama contract|pg||
nt|april7: or trump|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead can beat this|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe but I think he can do little real damage by trying 1@S or 1NT|pg||
nt|snorris: 2 @c was appropriate|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: N having only 2@H and K@S 3rd means this should be beat too|pg||
nt|mariner1: if @H broke better the could jettison a @D on 3rd @H|pg||
nt|mariner1: or even if he only had kx @S|pg||
nt|snorris: now this is critical.. must switch too clubs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hope they get it down by timely @C play|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i know the Estonian thinking rite since last session:)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|garnetts: this is a good slam--only a heart lead makes it dodgy--but even then 50%|pg||
nt|snorris: still not won..|pg||
pc|cA|nt|snorris: -2 but who is to double?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|xenya: and no long suits or fits this time -- they should diagnose it i think and stop short|pg||
nt|xenya: but no...|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|josj: even @DJ10xx with S is not enough|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|josj: this would make on a favourable @D position + @C 3-3 or so...|pg||
nt|lestergold: why such a hurry to play spade?|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 1 in Open W is playing 2@H DBL|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DQ |pg||
nt|garnetts: 1NT might be best because he can bid 2@D over 2@C if that were to happen|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|col3435: looks like 2@s was forcing, in which case surely 4@s isn't the right way to go about things|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jaapfr: unhappy defense|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: seems slam depends on Axx in the W hand and @Cs 3-3 -- no such luck|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well I want to be in six on these tickets|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|josj: asking too much even for a Roland slam (which requires about 12.89 % as you may know)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|lestergold: not that it will make any difference on this hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: now can beat it 2 A@C and one|pg||
nt|snorris: ah.. a mistake.. in this situation at least|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|garnetts: I think 4@S was an effort to suggest minimum with no outside values of any merit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|col3435: hmm, is that what East has? Doesn't look like it to me :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|snorris: -3 if @c back but no|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 rounds ofm trumps aj of dims and then spade was a more normal sequence of play|pg||
pc|c7|pc|hJ|pc|s7|nt|mariner1: well he can use the @D to pitch @c so only 1 on that line|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

nt|snorris: e-w might win 3 @hs tops|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jaapfr: 1@H-p-1nt-p-2@C-p-2@D?|pg||
nt|garnetts: normal but it seems a toy is coming out here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D and what will EW do now?|pg||
nt|garnetts: presumably invitational with diamonds |pg||
nt|jaapfr: go too 3@S or 4@S or pass?|pg||
nt|garnetts: OH a multi of sorts|pg||
nt|garnetts: East can do nothing here unless he is on medication lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: singleton of certain suits or 0-8; 10+ 4/4; 15+ any|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s 3@cs|pg||
nt|sybarra: E finding this bid "interesting"|pg||
nt|chick: jullis will be at a loss with 19 hcp and a strong spade suit|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: This is a reasonable 4@S contract--but very hard to get to|pg||
nt|mariner1: I overcall 1@S here, not DBL|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes better|pg||
nt|daman: I do not like the 1@H opener|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL and rebid my suit I have a bigger hand|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|snorris: show it as nt hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 nt a disaster if S can find club lead |pg||
nt|chick: and W has nothing to bid with|pg||
nt|snorris: not now no|pg||
nt|snorris: so 2nt -2|pg||
nt|snorris: will south double?...hardly|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 2@D looks like a good bid here to me--unusual but what else|pg||
nt|col3435: yes you probably need South not to rebid 2NT for a start|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx piret|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahalim: you prefer 1@D ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: maybe their style is canope|pg||
nt|garnetts: might be bale to act if 3@D gets back to him--but dangerous|pg||
nt|garnetts: able even|pg||
nt|chick: S has a fit for whatever N's second suit is|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: canape|pg||
nt|daman: I prefer 1 @D|pg||
nt|daman: as would most players|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even 2nt can be easily -1|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@D from South?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: ok now it makes sense: sing or typo by N; was supposed to be sign-off:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i prefer psychish 3nt:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: sing was typo|pg||
nt|snorris: ah to play 3@ds|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I hate 2NT with xxx in hearts|pg||
nt|april7: its a favourable position in @C and @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: connection lost, sorry|pg||
nt|snorris: like my system:)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|xenya: pass from E looks a bit strange to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: no problems heremay well make 3 losing a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: W gives up too easy I think|pg||
nt|snorris: only -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmf: 2NT is problably seminatural also|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT is silly--surely 3@S is much better|pg||
nt|col3435: but the alerting suggests that this is an artificial sequence|pg||
nt|daman: opening 1 @H is destructive to a partnership    takes partner completely out of the auction |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think these keyboards have a built in typo mechanism|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: now N is looking confused:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@H was daft |pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: in which case maybe they are bound by their system|pg||
nt|april7: 10 of @C and @S from dummy|pg||
nt|april7: W is in wrong hand now|pg||
nt|lestergold: that avram would have been a better line|pg||
nt|snorris: e-w must defend well to beat it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and E i presume|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|xenya: but perhaps that's their style|pg||
nt|col3435: say if this is an agreed way to show 5=3=3=2 shape|pg||
nt|garnetts: I hate any system that gets me to 3NT here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: cold for 5 or eben 6 @Ds and they are defending 3NT     wow|pg||
nt|garnetts: What is Estonian for sorry partner? |pg||
nt|jaapfr: sp?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: screens are used, so not much spoken:)|pg||

nt|jaapfr: ah indeed now make|pg||

nt|lestergold: well hes playing it a little lazily|pg||
pc|c4|nt|josj: X seems more appropriate but they reached the proper contract after all|pg||
pc|cK|nt|daman: even*|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D will not make|pg||
nt|snorris: now -2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: to make on the nose|pg||
nt|april7: but no danger for the contract|pg||

nt|ahalim: 5@D yes, 6@D goes down|pg||
nt|mariner1: if he ruffs @H then he can't pull the K@D|pg||
nt|garnetts: East know South has a singleton spade--Might have tried Ace and a low one|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i vote for making this funny 3@H:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if not @SA now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: EW are arguing now |pg||
nt|jaapfr: N and E look very pale now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: seems like some explanations given different on other side of the screen |pg||
nt|garnetts: If spades are continued it still fails I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: seems like west forgot system |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: TD coming to table |pg||
nt|jaapfr: if @SA indeed it was down 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am not sure South can unscramble things |pg||
nt|garnetts: a low spade and later the A@S beats it too |pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok that i disagee:)?|pg||
nt|garnetts: flat board if the result stands 4@D made in the OR|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @D away and play @D @D until trump and still home imo|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: EW saying that the lead would have been different if properly explained|pg||
nt|garnetts: They may have been correct if poor explanation was given |pg||
pc|d6|nt|garnetts: You are right perhaps about systemic arrangements--but surely there are time when they must be put aside|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in std easy play @ST trick 1 and all is clear|pg||
nt|snorris: either some cross-ruffing or just pull @cs|pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: eaysy 10 tricks -- with a chance of an 11th perhaps|pg||
nt|lestergold: finita la musica|pg||

nt|daman: so, if he opened properly the auction would proceed  1@D  (Dbl) Pass - 2@C - 2@H   etc etc   and then they would land on their feet|pg||
nt|daman: hard to believe they sold out |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: in estonia, 1@d usually just denies 5 card major and says nothing about @d|pg||
nt|daman: when you bid 2@H it has to show longer @Ds than @Hs|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have a play for 4@S|pg||
nt|snorris: more slams|pg||
nt|snorris: a grand one..|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H also has the same play|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @h is a fair contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I agree--but there are times when instinct and judgement maust override this|pg||
nt|mariner1: W has to find @S lead vs the unlikely 4@H|pg||
nt|ahalim: after N's 1@S 4@S will be the contract|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H here is likely --also laydown |pg||
nt|jaapfr: now a quiet 4@H made no problems and relax:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzmf: Monte Carlo is the current leader ater 2 round robins, Pärnu 3 is on 8th place|pg||
nt|chick: pretty easy to find, too|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 3NT also laydown |pg||

nt|sybarra: S already thinking slam |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: again, standings before this final match: |pg||
mb|4C|nt|april7: a very risky bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: These hands are not that easy--here 3NT is the best contract looking at EW only --but again tough to get to|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and will make|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard opens a strong club and you hold this hand!|pg||
mb|4D|nt|xenya: 13 imps to Monte Carlo on 2, when they stopped in 5N in OR -- also a bit too high, but makeable as it is|pg||
nt|josj: ty Tanel|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: standings at http://www.bridge.ee/MV/VK09/VK09-3.htm|pg||
nt|josj: little justice to gain 13 imps for stopping too high :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: a good 2@S bid--that will help |pg||
nt|lestergold: bur he is worried that e/w may be stealing the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: Monte Carlo (356), Roheline Lammas (343), Druva (342,5), Eksprompt (338), Rakvere (313), Derpt (249), Otepää (222), Pärnu BK3 (201). |pg||
nt|sybarra: 7 nt works also |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well the lead has helped declareer giving him a second heart trick|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|garnetts: well done not bidding hearts|pg||

nt|mariner1: I don't much like 4@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: time for coffee no way this goes wrong:)|pg||
nt|snorris: not likly|pg||
nt|chick: I would think ask aces, ask kings, bid 7N (prevent a first trick ruff)|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Piret |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmf: no TD decision yet|pg||
nt|jaapfr: laydown=easily made in English although it contains the word down:)|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ahalim: but you suggested it :)|pg||
nt|daman: I would have raised @Ss    he already spoke to the @H suit when he bid 3@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: I suggested it had play, not that they should be in it :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: confusing language|pg||
nt|snorris: north could be without the q of @ds so..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: this lead solves the trump problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: west is awake!|pg||
nt|ahalim: :)|pg||
nt|snorris: maybe 7 @hs is better |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure "we" care about q @D|pg||
nt|snorris: for 13 tricks in nt yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: true|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D bid is?  rkk?|pg||
nt|chick: well, the @DQ makes the 13th trick, but only 15 pts in aces/kings, N must have a Q or two, so 7N is safer|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: he cannot lead a @D for profit so I predict this will make|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: careful play makes this as EW should not score a @D|pg||
nt|snorris: no fancy bidding here|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not a good advertisement for strong club |pg||

nt|snorris: @d part score ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: without @H lead 6@D makes here|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: TD decision on that board 3 is 3H-1 (lead would be different & lead matters)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: seems justice|pg||
nt|garnetts: They may appeal but I think they would be wasting their time |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: North said that there will be an appeal |pg||
nt|snorris: 6 @hs is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: even 7..|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: and the mattching number of spades bid after that... |pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|lestergold: classical thoery is as you describe but modern thinking seems to be in favour of getting into the bidding at tye first opportunity as you may not get another one|pg||
nt|snorris: might be hard to reach|pg||
nt|snorris: yes:)|pg||
nt|chick: 7 is certainly possible with careful play, so no overruffs|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: 2Nt at least invitational |pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: yes that's how I'd play it. And I do think South should go on over that - excellent chance of 9 top tricks in NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS might be able to make 4@S if they can get there|pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe they will bid 6@D it is a very good contract--cold without a heart lead and on a spade finesse otherwise|pg||
nt|jaapfr: illogical whilst a child understands @DA lead b3 must be based on wrong explanations|pg||
nt|snorris: now north..do something|pg||
mb|1S|nt|garnetts: Then South was very conservative|pg||
nt|garnetts: This might be tricky for NS to stop|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think most people today would make that double|pg||
nt|snorris: no bid..?|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: (or, failing that, a game on a finesse, which you still want to be in when vul)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jaapfr: mb 2@H|pg||
nt|snorris: guessing 2 @h is the final bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I will need guidance on the auction |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: 3C was explained to opp, but i dont see it:(|pg||
nt|snorris: west needs to know about easts distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: East looks confused|pg||
nt|snorris: so he can see the possibility of crossruffs|pg||
mb|4S|nt|josj: had S rebid 2nt now, he would have committed himself...he certainly does not like 2@H either|pg||
nt|april7: experience told me that without the right shape when you double you get to often in trouble|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: for the appeal: N normally acts as TD not player... |pg||
nt|jaapfr: au:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: This shortgage showing works against EW here as it strongly indicates a heart lead---obviously North will lead it anyway but he does not have to have the KQ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: so you predict 6@D-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: well, the 5-level is OK here, and I'm sure they won't bid a slam off two aces (will they?)|pg||
nt|garnetts: depends |pg||
nt|garnetts: I already don't like the auction|pg||
nt|jaapfr: me too|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: 2 controls and  singleton C, and support for D shown by E|pg||
nt|snorris: bummer...|pg||
nt|snorris: makes the match closer though..|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok again....I will ask, is there something wrong with bidding 4 @S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: East admits: 3C was C shortness..... |pg||
pc|c7|nt|josj: with the @D coming in and the @S right...|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a good debate|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to run the 9 @H when in|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1nt 16-19 here?|pg||

nt|sybarra: good grief |pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: u also get into trouble when u miss a game|pg||

nt|jaapfr: this not easy to make|pg||

pc|s3|nt|snorris: 25-21 after this|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: yes; i think they are all just tired|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mariner1: and then again when in with Q@D|pg||

nt|josj: there we go!|pg||
nt|xenya: oh dear -- he found the switch!|pg||
nt|josj: should bring them some badly needed imps...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: bridge is sometimes not honest|pg||
nt|jaapfr: fair|pg||
nt|garnetts: He has slightly misplayed this--should try A and another club  might be KQx --but no difference as things lie|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: This is a very strange auction--why not play in the other red suit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: could go off with tight defence|pg||

nt|lestergold: lead doesnt hurt!|pg||
nt|lestergold: might just make with the loss of 2s 2c and a diamond now|pg||
nt|garnetts: likely to get to a bad game here |pg||
mb|1N|nt|josj: this time X would probably have led to 4@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: which is a much, much better proposition than 3nt|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: mind you problems is entries|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but unlikely he pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: no other lead wouldhave endanger the contract either|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: after the club disacrds declarr is in dummy for the last time i fear|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: surely the contract is in danger avram|pg||
nt|snorris: going down..probably|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is not the best bid I have ever seen |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 4@S looks a better contract, even with 4-1 @Ss, -- 3N has no chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: i see 6 tricks for defense|pg||

nt|jaapfr: X as N 2@H would be trusting the opps bidding tooo much:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: still thinking|pg||
nt|snorris: stick with ace..3 times @d ..and ace of @h..then @d|pg||
nt|snorris: that will save a trick|pg||

nt|lestergold: not one u or i would have macde for sure avram!|pg||
nt|april7: and vul. too???|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well pressure often leads to bridge that is not great--but that is normal |pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|snorris: south might counter that with a SMALL ruff in front of dummy|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i do not agree with @CQ by N|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: east wisely played spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade and hes ioff|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant pick up the dims|pg||
nt|lestergold: west must play that pesky spade top beat it|pg||
nt|april7: S should have played @D after @H, now he will lose 2 @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: the reason is tio vlaidate the heart exits|pg||
nt|april7: W should continue @S ofcourse|pg||
nt|lestergold: however fat lady aints sung yet|pg||
nt|lestergold: west in tank|pg||
nt|lestergold: its jot necessarily obvious to west that he must play that spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: another card gives the contract|pg||
nt|april7: E should ofcourse not cover the 10 of @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: he wont im sure that would be misere|pg||
nt|april7: W has exiccards in @H after K of @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: exacly why he has to play spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: kill point we are4 waiting|pg||
nt|april7: W might want to ruff a @D if the K of @D is with E, but its really not necessary, except S has QJ|pg||

pc|d8|pg||

nt|snorris: and south has 1 trick+ for pd|pg||
nt|garnetts: it surely cannot have made --they llready had two tricks so the AQ were two more and eventually a club|pg||
mb|2N|nt|josj: a low @S leaves 3nt chanceless|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am passing the S hand, this feels like a misfit |pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: I suggest west makes a tentative double|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: you can hardly stop short of game here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: beaty bidding clear and simple and effective  |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: well S just might bid 2N here (NF)...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2 down was minimum\|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: probably a support double|pg||
nt|garnetts: Must have been a revoke |pg||
mb|5C|nt|jaapfr: beauty|pg||
nt|snorris: in last board n-s won 4@hs on a endplay|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: slam above 50% basically dependant on finding qs|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H is not a good bid, W is too strong, only 5 losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: hearts or spades makes no odds|pg||
nt|april7: E can't really continue|pg||
nt|lestergold: esoecially after the 3s bid!|pg||
nt|lestergold: double fit|pg||
nt|april7: but E doesn't know it|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this looks off|pg||
nt|mariner1: has 8 if the guesses @c right|pg||
nt|mariner1: could try to sneak a @S by|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if give all away down 1 imo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even ith @CK return|pg||
mb|5D|nt|xenya: another wrong prediction of mine...|pg||
nt|garnetts: Should they bid game?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if|pg||
mb|d|nt|col3435: I'd be worried about this if I was West - I don't think he's shown his nice hand and nice club support|pg||
nt|april7: E takes the chance|pg||
nt|lestergold: no east is still at it surpriingly|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT has 2 chances    slim and none    unless a colossal misdefense|pg||
nt|chick: Thank you, Piret!  That makes it feel more like people at the table :)|pg||
nt|chick: nice, and another big swing for MonteCarlo|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: making coffee..brb|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmf: DQ was discarded|pg||
nt|jaapfr: noooooooooooooooooo|pg||
nt|garnetts: accident ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: well, they avoided game, well done by them, but 3@D will not go plus for them either|pg||
nt|garnetts: Most odd--hope there hasn't been any unusual betting :)  |pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: west now realises time to take pressure off his partner|pg||
nt|april7: does 3@D show a singleton? |pg||
nt|lestergold: poor auctionm but good landing|pg||
nt|april7: thats a goodbid now, because E could have passed the answer of 5@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: yesn avrasm west played 'catch up'|pg||
nt|lestergold: realised that if pard was making a slam try he had the val;ues |pg||
nt|april7: wher is the Q of @S???:):)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: well of course it haas to be found but it will |pg||
pc|cA|nt|jaapfr: it means   their nerves broke|pg||
nt|garnetts: Pressure |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|jaapfr: claim|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: indeed not -- 1 off it looks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: snuck the @S the wrong way|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jaapfr: it is indeed very easy to analyze from here|pg||
nt|garnetts: must draw trumps and guess spades |pg||
nt|jaapfr: seeing 52 cards and smoking|pg||
nt|garnetts: The 10@D indicates the divison and vacant spaces indicates a likely spade split is 4-2 |pg||
nt|garnetts: Therefore Q@D and J@S |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|josj: W has given upside down count and gets the obvious ruff|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can not believe he is making this|pg||
pc|sK|nt|garnetts: that is also my view--perhaps 3@H would do it justice|pg||
nt|lestergold: elimination wont help a jot here|pg||
nt|chick: Board 7, the 4@H with @D endplay was textbook perfect ... a good hand for the less experienced in our audience to study :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: not that he should know where it was|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|april7: S has singleton @H so perhaps 3 @S???|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|jaapfr: always down|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have had a lot of questions about the last board---the defence switched to a club and at some point East discarded the QD which gave them 10 trricks |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf:  i will try to get the full line of play in on that one|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all. Sorry for the late arrival, small problem   |pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: not enuf justification for playinmg south for that|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s5|pc|h5|pg||
nt|col3435: well, opps have bid two suits - normally then I'd bid the suit I've got (diamonds)|pg||
nt|col3435: seems easier to me to do something over 2@d|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N in Open here also|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open W led a @S so 3N made|pg||
nt|mariner1: so we will have a new leader|pg||
nt|mariner1: is W really thinking here?|pg||
nt|ahalim: slow conn. maybe|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure best play was q @C |pg||

nt|april7: another easy 4 @S for EW after 1 NT opening|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w wil mak 11 or m12 tyricks in xspades depending on swhether they recieve a dim lead or not|pg||
nt|jaapfr: must be trown away @DQ and lead @CK and made 4th @D indummy to let 4@H madee on b7|pg||
nt|snorris: no|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @ss is nice contract|pg||
mb|1H|nt|garnetts: was obviously hoping his partner would double--but maybe double support was better anyway|pg||
nt|april7: without @D lead even 6|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hope for EW they do not try 4@HX|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: might well be 57 over 7 shortly...if 4@S makes on  7 in OR|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|garnetts: Knows the opps have spades probably |pg||
nt|april7: are EW aggressive enough to go to 6???|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi mike|pg||
nt|snorris: might win..|pg||
mb|1S|nt|garnetts: They should easily get to 7NT/@S here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i say bye to you all and tx piret specs and david byeeeeeeee|pg||
nt|garnetts: We all bid and make 4@S here--next |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Hi Mike |pg||
mb|3H|nt|april7: no slam anymore|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D multi or showing a weak major|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry mike i must go|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: 1S bid is strange; tehy are playing strong club... |pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: and for NS N rescuing with 5@CX-2:)|pg||
nt|snorris: no way now they do|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: with current score, the total standings become even more intriguing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: Standings before the current match are: Druva (320,5), Monte Carlo (319), Roheline Lammas (311), Ekspromt (309), Rakvere (270), Derpt (221), Otepää (203), Pärnu BK3 (171).   |pg||
nt|jaapfr: so virtually NS went above EW|pg||
mb|3N|nt|snorris: and Lammas is gaining on Monte Carlo|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@H says bid your suit or pass|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what is 2@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: 2 @h ??|pg||
nt|mdgraham: raising to 4@s seems a bit of an overbid, though - and has galvanised North|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 1N is safe|pg||
nt|josj: this looks OK and 3@C looks OK too|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ecco|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: was alerted, but no questions asked on this side of screen|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: make 6 hell lead stiff heart|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D makes|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure N can raise to 5@D here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: no he hasnt |pg||
nt|snorris: landed well..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lovely 3@C C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Aivar Tihane|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|snorris: e-w need to play clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, 4@S makes more sense in a strong club (and presumably 5-major) system  |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|col3435: this comes up quite a lot - my feeling is that the easiest way to bid these hands is to have the player with the long suit show his suit, and then let partner take control|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would have adn lost an overtrick|pg||
nt|chick: tough to play spaces for only 2 losers, so difficult with a @D lead|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: well he did so well done this time|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this is bridge: if S does not open EW mite end in a horrible 4@H|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|snorris: might have to finesse @hs for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|snorris: if continued @ds lead|pg||
nt|snorris: best is small @d from south now|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|col3435: from East's point of view, AKQxxx spades + Blackwood = easy game|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open they found 6@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: quick claim|pg||
pc|s7|nt|josj: defence cannot remove both the @H and the @D entries to dummy's @C in time|pg||
nt|xenya: all  the defence can get is 4 @Ss and 2 aces|pg||
nt|col3435: but I suppose here they have so much to spare that they're always OK|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure i would have wasted much time over a 2NT opening from East|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: E showed 2 aces and 3 kings|pg||
nt|tihas: hi all, I will try to fit in with the commentary|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am sure Mike when you were told that when partner raises a major to game there is no slam on lol--I can remember seeing all my partner's cards when I used Blackwood--he threw ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: them at me|pg||
pc|s8|nt|daman: good stuff|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D a violation of Burn's Law|pg||
nt|daman: they found 6@D    they were lost|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
pc|s9|nt|snorris: opening up for cross ruffs|pg||

nt|snorris: small @c to king ruff @d..|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: on the best defence of course|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahalim: lost and found :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and nothing wrong about opening 1@H as S or passing|pg||

pc|s6|nt|april7: why not try for @H 3-3??|pg||
nt|lestergold: id have certainly led dim against 6!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: indeed it cost nothing|pg||
nt|daman: in the OR   South "gilded the lily" by bidding 6@D over 5   hung his partner for no reason|pg||
nt|snorris: now more @d|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|josj: no less than 3, I think...|pg||
nt|snorris: 9 tricks..on cross ruffs|pg||
nt|chick: S was afraid to set up the @DJ|pg||
nt|snorris: this is giving up|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jaapfr: i thought all lines do lead to making this|pg||
nt|snorris: or this way..|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: TD at table |pg||
nt|jaapfr: suppose about 2@H bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: East "almost" played a small H|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: and then corrected|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: so the small stands|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mariner1: so new leader|pg||
nt|snorris: then 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: makes no difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: and quick claim of 10|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 3|pg||

nt|xenya: 12|pg||
nt|sybarra: clubs clubs clubs  and over |pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: finessing the @SJ would allow another @D force, so E played this beautifully|pg||

nt|mariner1: he has a two way guess in @c and needs to drop the Q@D|pg||

nt|sybarra: might try 3 nt now?|pg||
nt|chick: now N knows E has hearts, he will devalue a lot of his hand|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|xenya: but perhaps you must have 4 @Hs for the double in their methods|pg||
nt|josj: with both @SQ and @HK wrong, 3nt would have been difficult :)|pg||
nt|col3435: seems unusual for North not to raise spades here|pg||
nt|garnetts: prefer 2@D myself here|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|mariner1: well backup, the 4th @H sets up so @c guess not needed|pg||
nt|ahalim: more Rob, no trump loser and @C guess if @H are not 3-3 |pg||
nt|mariner1: Open in 5@D here|pg||
nt|daman: East might just pass|pg||
nt|daman: he is thinking|pg||
nt|mariner1: not if 2@D is inverted|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: standings before current round: 1. Monte Carlo, 2. Druva|pg||
nt|daman: why   this shows a bad hand with @Ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: for the mathematics under us|pg||
nt|garnetts: little  choice here find two ladies |pg||
nt|chick: it really only leaves him with @SAQ and @HA as values|pg||
nt|snorris: no guts..|pg||
nt|chick: not sure I agree ... S passed his first opportunity to bid|pg||
nt|snorris: 9 easy tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: he should bid 3@S over 2NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: once you have gone off in five of  major a couple of times, you get a bit leery of the five-level |pg||
nt|snorris: that was strange too|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: but east will have problems discarding he needs to hold onto all his dims|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|garnetts: INT is constructive--but not this good with a non passed partner|pg||

nt|garnetts: That will make it easy |pg||
nt|tihas: might not be much of a guess in the end|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahalim: that's barbaric|pg||
nt|daman: this was feeble|pg||
nt|garnetts: if he throws two hearts dec might be able to try a club|pg||
nt|tihas: doesnt have a count on hearts though|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: spades now |pg||
nt|garnetts: A bit like a Morton's Fork |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: got spades right |pg||
pc|d5|nt|garnetts: Another confusing English expression |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: i think QJx in @Hs and the 5-4-3-1 shape make up for the lack of a 4th @H|pg||
nt|col3435: I guess it's worth pointing out that when you play against artificial systems like this 1@d bid, you need to make sure you have agreed that your 2@d is still a spade raise|pg||
nt|col3435: but I'm sure they know that, and North just felt his hand was very flat|pg||

nt|jaapfr: until now i personally do like the Estonian bridge:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|josj: another advantage of X is that S might have passed it|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|jaapfr: or are NS another nationality?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: NS are Latvians |pg||
nt|jaapfr: then i like them too:)|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s will get 1 more trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: Latvians often play tournaments in estonia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: neighbour countries|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: and then our biggest event - Tallinn Bridge Festival - at the end of May, is very international|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: estonians, latvians, fins, lithuanians, russians, swedes, norwegians, polish , belorussia, etv etc|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzmf: probably biggest event in this area|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: it was just made|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you try to improve BBO speed record in typing Piret:)?|pg||
nt|snorris: big money to be won ?|pg||

nt|mariner1: actually it was :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if now @SJ lead: au|pg||
nt|snorris: now south will tink pd has the red suits..|pg||
nt|tihas: even 5@h might make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: named after John Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury and minister to Henry VII |pg||
nt|garnetts: true |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and to do with the extraction of taxes|pg||
nt|tihas: and 5@c will make for sure|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes it was the size of your windows |pg||
nt|mdgraham: surprised at West's silence in the other room|pg||
nt|snorris: hard to find those @ds now|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: 1D artificial, so no info yet about D suit.... |pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|col3435: yes I would|pg||
nt|garnetts: Too small and you saved lots of money and you could pay---too large and you had plenty of money to pay anyway|pg||
nt|chick: unless N gets a bit braver|pg||
mb|3H|nt|daman: at equal    3@H was silly by West   could have given them something for nothing|pg||
nt|garnetts: We all think that 4NT by west is takeout and not natural do we?|pg||
nt|tihas: now this situation differs from the other table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
nt|tihas: because E knows opps are pre-empting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Nothing East can do here now|pg||
nt|tihas: he can double|pg||
mb|3S|nt|col3435: I'd consider something more than 4@s as North, but never mind|pg||
nt|april7: after strong @C yes and come in perhaps later as you see|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is this?|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has bid freely with taht garbage|pg||
nt|april7: disturbing bid|pg||
nt|daman: partner didn't need to have the World's Fair|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 3@S is off yet no DBL so............|pg||

nt|vugraphzmf: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: backfiring rubbish here|pg||
nt|snorris: should do...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|col3435: they do play Precision after all|pg||
nt|tihas: and W can take it out to his suits with 4NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihas: but not today|pg||
nt|garnetts: Presumeably west figured it was natural |pg||
nt|sybarra: S is really thinking?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: Open also in 3@S here|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|snorris: not winning this one|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: on 9, the defence gave declarer no chance in 3N in OR -- 2 down|pg||
nt|xenya: and 9 more imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: no play|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: maybe 2NT was leb|pg||
nt|snorris: actually e-w can win 6 @ds|pg||
nt|chick: If N's X is a standard neg double, S should pass, his spade stopper is not good enough for 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: he opened a piece of cheese and now drives to game??  yu,k!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|snorris: might think 31@ds is forcing|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|josj: best return for E now is a club :)|pg||
nt|snorris: lucky mind you..|pg||
nt|garnetts: I was wondering how else you can play in 4NT when you want to|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the take-out option must be logical - with a balanced hand and some strength, West can double|pg||
nt|snorris: ..not 31 @ds|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: debate at table, what is  stornger , x or 3D|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: y|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he can drop the Q@S and make this|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: Yes but with say   xx Kxx   xx  KQxxxx  |pg||
pc|d4|nt|april7: whats the hurry???|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jaapfr: 2@D-2@S etc|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: good guess in @Ds -- likely 8 tricks now|pg||
nt|mariner1: and 3@S was made in Open as well|pg||
nt|mariner1: for some reason I convinced myself he had a @S loser........|pg||
pc|s7|nt|josj: should be, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: not that it matters much of course -- at this score|pg||
nt|april7: now S makes it|pg||
nt|lestergold: lewt it thru forsoem  reason |pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzmf: too fast again; discarding clubs and spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway easy making|pg||
nt|snorris: so on "normal" bidding e-w will end in 5 @ds..|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: went for sure 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: dreadful defence|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. never easy|pg||
nt|tihas: actually I dont like the 2NT bid at all with W hand here - the spades are weak and there is 4-card @h too|pg||
nt|tihas: with E hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with that|pg||
pc|dK|pc|hQ|nt|col3435: this needs a good guess doesn't it?|pg||

nt|mariner1: 4@H NS looks right|pg||
nt|garnetts: But 4NT needs discussion |pg||
mb|1C|nt|lestergold: it was a routine defence situation|pg||
nt|daman: EW may compete a bit perforce in @Ss|pg||
nt|garnetts: Looks like this will buy it|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @c n-s|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 4 @H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Open is in 4@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as we all can see today not normal-bidding has advantages but also considerable disadvantages|pg||
mb|1D|nt|garnetts: this is almost exactly a 50% slam--and that is the worst it could be |pg||
nt|daman: East has a good hand|pg||

nt|garnetts: You?  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: not me, cluck cluck |pg||
nt|garnetts: Bad hearts make it dubious I suppose|pg||
nt|snorris: @ss can be held to 8 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Case for South doubling?  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there are some people who would act as South |pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @h is difficult with @s lead|pg||
mb|1H|nt|tihas: and sometimes these people are right, but the risk is high|pg||
nt|mdgraham: fully paid-up member of the Chicken Club |pg||
nt|tihas: and at this VUL much too high to my mind|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: when you know that a slam cannot be worse than that you should bid it in my view|pg||
nt|col3435: indeed|pg||
nt|snorris: battle of majors|pg||
nt|snorris: will end here I think|pg||
mb|1N|nt|garnetts: But 4@H is a horrible bid --surely a slam may be on |pg||
nt|mariner1: play should be quick|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: 6@H makes but is not so good|pg||
nt|april7: its ab forcing pass? now W will pass also|pg||

mb|2H|nt|josj: the losing @C has to go on a @D|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: not any longher|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: luckily 5h is safe|pg||
nt|lestergold: miond you not an unreasonable try|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: This is another mistake not because game has been missed but because it has been missed vulnerable|pg||
nt|sybarra: true |pg||
pc|s5|nt|col3435: I might lead a club.|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have no real rationale for this except that experience has left me with this prejudice |pg||
pc|s4|nt|mariner1: they need to knock the A @D out|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: 2NT is right vul on the west cards and not otherwise |pg||
nt|chick: no matter how you count distribution, any 6-5 is a very good hand beyond the HCP|pg||
nt|sybarra: with great distribution,  but my point was ,  no reason to mention the clubs|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|snorris: depends..are you tough bidder 3. in hand ?|pg||

nt|jaapfr: where to end here??|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: East promised not to lay down on cards from next board; let's see.... Then i would also see something|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 nt my guess|pg||
nt|garnetts: Something that I have a thing about at teams --push for vulnerable games |pg||
nt|mdgraham: plus Jx of partner's suit is a plus|pg||
nt|garnetts: also bear in mind they were behind almsot certainly and they have just had a pick up--golden time to ram home an advantage |pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: in Open they are in a calm 2@S in W|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D E  2@S  swish|pg||
nt|garnetts: Instead they have given it back |pg||

nt|april7: X now|pg||
nt|lestergold: north south cold for 3s close to 4 not even in auction!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as Peter Pigot (Ireland) says, West on the last hand had aces, which give a certain measure of control|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: we DBL  I like shaped DBL (my mouse and me :) )|pg||
nt|snorris: no 3 @ds??|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: South levered EW into 3NT in the OR|pg||
mb|2S|nt|col3435: not so keen on this|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@D can risk a 5-1 fit--whereas 2@H must be at worse 4-3|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: something strange happened at trick1 of previous board...unlikely S won the trick with his @DJ...|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, a few spectators have pointed that out... |pg||

nt|snorris: right|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|josj: playing strong @C you sometimes end up in remarkably low contracts|pg||
nt|josj: E can pass here as p is known not to have 16+|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do not like 1NT--but prefer that to 2@D |pg||
nt|snorris: no easy contract|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a very interesting play ahead here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mariner1: so 2@S played in different directions here in the two rooms..... one is a violation of|pg||
nt|mariner1: Burn's Law|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: good lead problem for South, as 1@D may (I think) be short |pg||
nt|garnetts: How many times does West want to bid this? |pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, West has removed 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|snorris: actually best to raise @ss!|pg||

nt|jaapfr: and hates the @C7 and @C6|pg||

nt|mdgraham: not clear why|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jaapfr: nice idea of E @HQ!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|daman: George Burns?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe he doesn't think his partner is much of a card player|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, his team is joint first.... |pg||
nt|tihas: he probably figured that his hand is too weak for playing 3NT, when partner has 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not for much longer methinks |pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: Ks lead beatsb it low lets it thru|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|april7: NS have a cold 4@S, so it was a lucky openerby E|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||

nt|jaapfr: or trow in?|pg||
nt|snorris: maybe..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: at the end|pg||
nt|snorris: but south should play small @dnow|pg||
nt|jaapfr: thrilling board until now|pg||
nt|snorris: and the defense prevails|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then endplay easy for 9 tr|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|garnetts: If partner cannot handle the odd Moysian fit--so called after Sonny Moyse who had a habit of opening three card majors--then find a partner who can lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a dim lead can defeat 4s with a ruff|pg||
pc|d4|nt|snorris: see!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT should show a spade fit in way --not a small singleton so maybe he was wondering if there was a miracle fit in clubs for a slam |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: One point about the last hand--anyone for 2NT from North?|pg||

nt|garnetts: 4@H is an overbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: lunch after this match and back at 15:00|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: a classic auction to 3N via a @H transfer|pg||
mb|4H|nt|garnetts: 2@H is surely not a good move here--overstates by a lot|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he discs a @H you can pick up all@hs, if he discs a @d........|pg||

mb|p|nt|col3435: I'm not sure I know what 2@h means for them|pg||

pc|c8|nt|garnetts: This may well make --but it does not justify the bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry two easy club tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: what a dreadful decision by north|pg||
nt|snorris: dont like the double either|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think 9 out  of 10 would rebid 3nt|pg||
nt|snorris: so 12 imps to Monte Carlo and a close match|pg||
pc|c2|nt|garnetts: 2@S as a trial would catch 3@S and then 4@H is fine--but maybe EW are fed up |pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very hard on EW - we have all had sessions like this, when all that you do crumbles|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: if he hadnt pulled the @ds early he could play the J@H now and then the black winners..|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is no longer possible|pg||
nt|mariner1: and he now has to pitch before S does|pg||
nt|hedyg: 8@H would stay as a menace|pg||
nt|hedyg: and E could have pitched his @hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: too hard to go for the @H finesse directly when in 7NT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s3|nt|snorris: north has the stopper himself|pg||

nt|garnetts: when you need KQX onside play for it|pg||
nt|garnetts: It really doesn't matter going more down--go for it|pg||
nt|mariner1: and now the last board|pg||
nt|hedyg: now he has another chance LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh he doesnt |pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Tanel (Estonia), our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!! <Applause> <Applause> <Applause>|pg||
nt|mariner1: Our appreciation to the Estonian bridge folks and all the generous sponsors and|pg||
nt|mariner1: organizers for helping BBO bring us the vugraphs!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: agree but for looking for 6@D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 20-20|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Almost the end now, so time for a few words of thanks: to our excellent operator Piret Raudsepp (who also organised this tournament), and to the Estonian Bridge Federation for ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: enabling BBO to provide this broadcast.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is last hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our terrific operator Piret |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: thanks all for watching!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course thx to my co commentators, Cornelia and Snorri |pg||
nt|snorris: 10 tricks in @cs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: Also thanks to David Carlisle  (England), Jaap Freiling (Sweden), and Aivar Tihane (Estonia) for commentary. I am Mike Graham (England). Also thanks to all spectators for some ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: useful and perceptive comments.  |pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to the Estonia Bridge Federation for brining this great tourney to BBO |pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|xenya: despite this somewhat disappointing score, we have seen some interesting hands -- i enjoyed the set|pg||
nt|josj: close to slam again but 4@H is enough here|pg||
nt|josj: an interesting set it was, yes|pg||
nt|snorris: south knows that north has something like this if he bids 3nt or 25+ hp balanced|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5 out of 16 boards Roland:)|pg||
nt|snorris: and can bid accordingly|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @s for me|pg||
nt|tihas: and in spades, too|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|garnetts: This will play badly if East floats it|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT looks reasonable here on the club finesse most of the time |pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: we will continue in 25 mins from now|pg||
nt|garnetts: that cannot be right surely |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: 1@s alert because psyches sometimes occures|pg||
nt|garnetts: The men in white coats will come for North shortly |pg||
nt|col3435: so this is a psychic psyche-reveal?|pg||
nt|garnetts: a penalty try I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: East should double to show values here |pg||
nt|col3435: double would be hearts for me, unfortunately|pg||
nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators Hedy Grey|pg||
nt|mariner1: (Switzerland), George Holland (Canada), Arifn Halim (Indonesia), and Roland|pg||
nt|mariner1: Wald (Denmark).....I am Rob Brown (USA)........|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at|pg||
nt|mariner1: it!|pg||
nt|mariner1: also, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates, Sharon|pg||
nt|mariner1: Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no broadcasts.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge lovers|pg||
nt|mariner1: worldwide!|pg||
nt|hedyg: S took a chance|pg||
nt|mariner1: last but definitely not least, thanks to all our spectators, their tips and comments|pg||
nt|mariner1: help keep us almost undefenestrated! (Hedy stays away from windows :)  )|pg||
nt|mariner1: NV I bid some @H too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Lunch break now. We will be back in 1 hour and a wee bit|pg||
nt|garnetts: That should get them there --agressive form North but reasonable with AK@S |pg||
mb|3D|nt|xenya: you don't want to be in 6 missing AJ10xx in trumps|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: today we had 5 out of 16 boards with 20-20 hcp division although the statistical chance is 6,9%|pg||
nt|sybarra: and to our specs,  we all love your comments @H@H! |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: AJ109x rather|pg||
nt|josj: depends :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h will be reache andaltho it was off in open i think it has play if they dont find the spade ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 discards can be created now fopr spade losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: draw trumps ruff out clubs play dim and ten tricks?|pg||
nt|april7: with the ruffing finesse in @C S loses only 1 @D and 2 @S tricks, after pulling trumps ofcourse|pg||
nt|mariner1: thanks all!|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||

mb|3N|nt|vugraphzmf: Eksprompt has got a win over Druva 23:7|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmf: standings were befor ethis match: |pg||
nt|snorris: druve was the leader?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so top 3 very close now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: Standings before the current match are: Druva (320,5), Monte Carlo (319), Roheline Lammas (311), Ekspromt (309), Rakvere (270), Derpt (221), Otepää (203), Pärnu BK3 (171).   |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I would have bid 2@S as East|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very lawful|pg||
nt|garnetts: What was the point of 2@C?  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably a puppet to 2@D, now 2NT invitational perhaps?|pg||
nt|garnetts: North should have shown a non minimum with a reasonable spade stop--I bid 3NT|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|josj: 12.30 local time, 9.30 GMT|pg||
nt|col3435: ah well, it did always look like 3NT. Takes more than that little diversion to talk them out of it.|pg||
nt|garnetts: a devastating lead :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: oddly enough, game has been missed by EW|pg||
nt|xenya: 26 hcp and 4-4 major fit|pg||
nt|josj: some interesting overcalling by NS|pg||
nt|snorris: so very close in the top now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|april7: in OR the hand was played by N|pg||
nt|garnetts: Oh well why bid 50% games |pg||
nt|mdgraham: because it's non-vulnerable? |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|garnetts: I knwo what I said earler but this isn't being psuhy North should have more than he advertised |pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: spade lead then and off without the option|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|april7: bad luck for NS in OR, W passed|pg||
