He became the youngest ACBL Life Master ever at the age of 10 years and 1 month! I'd rather not play against you in 5 ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: years my friend :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i like 1NT with the E hand -- treating singleton K's as balanced hand|pg||

nt|Walddk2: And please teach me Spinach Spade some day, or Broccoli Diamond if you prefer|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I have yet to invent those, but I'll get there :)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mtvesuvius: well, East missed a big opportunity|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: 4 anything by NS is at least 800|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Signe Thomsen did not travel all the way from Denmark to Iceland to pass as you see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And a 6 count isn't even a record at that level|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: nope, but I'd like to at least have the K@S in one of my suits...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yesterday Anne-Sofie Houlberg jumped to the 3-level on a 1 count, and the jack wasn't even in her suit|pg||

nt|werge: Or a busy 6 @C...?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C I like here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|lestergold: 4h on for e/w|pg||
nt|werge: With East as declarer, only all trumps by North can beat it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: A good contrace, but reachable?|pg||
nt|mariner1: and that is not likely now with a weak 2@H call|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|frankaus: nice gentle part score to start|pg||
nt|mariner1: Isak is out super operator again this session I think :)  hi Isak!|pg||
nt|mariner1: our|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@H is a good call|pg||
nt|ralfwil: It´s easy for us with all cards visible, but in practical play? also 6nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: that might turn E on...as he knows W has to have minor suits|pg||
nt|mariner1: she rather|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu: many would exp that this martch will be a walk-over for the danish juniors - but in a practice match before NM the gils won!! easy!!|pg||
nt|werge: 4 @H could be a very lucky one - defeated, if South stays cool with the @D Ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: another one of these over strength weak 2s|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: with similar result to one this morning i suspect|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Oh - the @C-ruff gives the 10th trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: west should double this to show the good hand|pg||
nt|chick: 13 HCP and doubleton H isn't enough to force to 3 level though|pg||
nt|othered1: overstrength?  Looks sanely standard to me.|pg||
nt|werge: @h-lead!?!|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: EW sh be: Lea Troels Møller Pedersen og Lars Møller Sørensen|pg||
nt|snorris: the 5 of @ds should be lavinthal|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: could be..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: quite right Chich but east has opened with a rather super maxi  weak 2|pg||
nt|werge: And not cover the @C Queen, pls|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT here for the minors, but whether to do this opposite a passed hand is debatable  |pg||
nt|lestergold: this should have been competed to 3h at any rate|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|snorris: but hard to see all the same|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the natural play in hearts is losing..|pg||
nt|snorris: still 7 tricks e-w|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: sorry, but I don't think it's super-maxi at all |pg||
nt|othered1: I guess it might be overstrength, after all, at least in expected suit quality, since west chose to sell out.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|chick: E has a moderate weak 2, not even close to a 1@H bid, so while this may make 4@H, I don't think they should be bidding it|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|snorris: chanse to beat it now|pg||
nt|pelu: If N now play @C she almost force declayer to "find" @HQ|pg||
nt|snorris: @c back..|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u 3c looks like at least 1 off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: how do you make 4@H on a trump lead? |pg||
nt|lestergold: why not cashing second heart?|pg||
nt|werge: But 4 @H is obe down... - trump-lead and duck the @C Qieen|pg||
nt|othered1: lead @S on trump lead?|pg||
nt|lestergold: in hearts there 6h tricks 2 dims and 2 clubs available as cards lie n'est ce pas?|pg||
nt|werge: Not if South is cool|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: Why not @cK in trick 2?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|snorris: a safty play should yield 8 tricks..small h to k low back|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: All players giving the hand a lot of thought|pg||
nt|mmmakela: with this tempo we'll have a very long match ahead of us|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|werge: That´s too easy, Ralf - a blind spot|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|othered1: right -- declarer has counters to every defense, it seems|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|werge: But OK - the contract was never played...|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Ölafur doesn't have an attractive lead, but @D9 would be my last choice|pg||

nt|vugraphznj: how many tricks do you have to get when playing 1 NT?|pg||

mb|p|nt|frankaus: do we bid 1@H or 1@S  or pass|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Very close after 5 boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|mdgraham: 4@H decent, but off on the lie of the cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It is recommended that you show your 4-card major before a longer minor if you are not strong enough to force to game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming a diamond lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Kári is not quite good enough for that|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But who cares, they bid the game with confidence|pg||

nt|bigtrain: this is a game that you would be happy to bid (vul) -- very unlucky to go down|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: In the closed room Sørensen's rebid was 2@H. I guess it's a 2½@H rebid. Let's see what the K&R Hand Evaluator says|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: exactly, every card is off|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H is a more attractive rebid opposite a 2@C response than a 1@S response.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: this is a huge advantage to playing precision here...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but even then it is close|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mtvesuvius: because now 3@h is limited, and it implies a 7+(6) card suit|pg||

nt|snorris: -2 hours compered to Denmark|pg||

nt|lestergold: is 2d fifth best?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my view - nothing else but @d|pg||
nt|werge: A lucky stop - the biggest 2 @H I´ve seen for 44½ years!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: And you are about 45 years old?|pg||
nt|werge: A little more|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hans are you forgeting that one back in 1978?|pg||

nt|othered1: or simply attitude?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but only a part contract|pg||

nt|mmmakela: Heart was the only lead I'd never consider|pg||
nt|lestergold: one each Chick in the first 2 or 3 tricks not that good|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes often make more when not in game or slam than if you bid them|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But when will you find the 10 from that suit?|pg||
nt|werge: But OK - the @D-lead is more obvious against game - against a part score, you have bigger hopes about partners hand - |pg||

nt|mariner1: 7 pointed suits or NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: this should be bid too|pg||
mb|2C|nt|werge: 15 easy tricks - the bidding please|pg||
nt|werge: When East shows a @D-suit, West should take over|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: sigh!|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|werge: Thia might - at some tables - be expensive for East - and West.|pg||
nt|othered1: EW had best not get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@C - 2@D - 2@S - 4N and up|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|werge: Actually the best way - I´m sure|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I should prefer 3@d - 4@d and then 4nt, just to defind @d as trumph and find the @dQ|pg||
nt|werge: West need to know, how many of the "3" Aces, East has|pg||
nt|werge: - so 4 NT now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I should prefer 4@d now!|pg||
mb|4D|nt|snorris: the penalty for the 2@h bid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well a doubtful x|pg||
nt|frankaus: now pd think Ege has a real 2@H bid :(|pg||
nt|mmmakela: got what it deserved imo|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@Sx on a trump lead might not be much fun.|pg||
nt|lestergold: now east has been warned....|pg||
nt|othered1: as many play, double by south would imply interest in penalty of @S as much as great length/strength in @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: one 5 card suit more or less destined for the skip|pg||
nt|othered1: and the @S, though 4 long, aren't very robust|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: now north has to show some points|pg||
nt|werge: Why waste our time with 4 @D?|pg||
nt|mariner1: I don't think W can bid something that stops 7N from E|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 4nt from 5@s and 5nt - 7nt|pg||
nt|mariner1: unless they play 7@D|pg||
nt|werge: But WEST is in 7 NT after having seen partner bid @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If partner promises all aces why not 7nt?|pg||
nt|mariner1: zackly|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|snorris: by doubling|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: with a solid @s!|pg||
nt|werge: Naturally, they deserve some credit - young they are|pg||
nt|mariner1: now W knows E has something|pg||
nt|werge: West now knows that for the second time!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me it´s important that the right hand asks for aces!|pg||
mb|4N|nt|lestergold: 100 honours for taht holding isnt it?|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if north expected another bid from south, after the penalty double of 2@D?|pg||
nt|werge: Did´nt this look forcing from North?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon South should double 2@S there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although, to be fair, partenr does not necessarily promise a seriously good hand for the double of 1@S|pg||
nt|werge: Let´s say 200 - which is´nt enough on this board|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not easy tio double2s into game holding 2345|pg||

nt|ralfwil: and now 3 aces!|pg||
nt|werge: Her we are - I go for a beer, back with 2220|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D has to be 0 - 3 keys in @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: W has to be thinking 3?|pg||
nt|werge: If its 0 - take the @D-finesse...|pg||
nt|mariner1: well 0 is an issue however E cue bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: cannot be nothing else bur 3 aces|pg||
nt|mariner1: that 4@H should say not 0|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but!!|pg||
nt|werge: AND 3 @D WAS POSITIVE - you got it?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7NT!!!!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@D could have been on kjxxx and nothing else........... 4@H shows a control|pg||
nt|werge: NO IT COULD´NT!!!|pg||

mb|5N!|mb|p|nt|werge: Try that, when you are tested positiv (epo and so on... ) tell them, it´a only a littele|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Which more information by 5nt?|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: oh well,,,,,,,,,,,|pg||

nt|pelu: yes but decl lost also a @D - pulled to many trump's|pg||
nt|lestergold: why this played in spades and not hearts is  a mystery to me not to mention the lack of a slam try|pg||
nt|othered1: Might east, seeing the previous auction, thought 4@H was a splinter?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite possibly...:)|pg||
nt|werge: Not 1 NT 15-17 as South, pls|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is a very good point and indeed a likely explanation|pg||
nt|werge: Did´nt we see that @C-suit recently?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S or 4@H has play here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N is not the spot this time|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|werge: The hand si closer til 2 NT...|pg||
mb|d!|nt|snorris: 3 nt for a change|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|snorris: this qualifies as 2nt in my book|pg||
nt|werge: Almost a double-stopper in @D doesn´t work|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: souths hand|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|werge: It´s difficult to bid 4 @S/@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: and not to bid 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think N should respond 1S|pg||
mb|2N|nt|werge: But the price: Wrong hand is playing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: raise to 3NT a bit gung-ho|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n sufficient|pg||
nt|lestergold: and nofrth should/would probably accept|pg||
nt|werge: NO - it´s maountain = 3 NT|pg||
nt|werge: mountain...|pg||
nt|lestergold: a mountain opposite a courtesy 1n response|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: i agree with 2NT|pg||
nt|werge: Right - then South could have supported in next round|pg||
mb|3N|nt|wilkinsona: could well miss guess|pg||
nt|snorris: 10+ tricks now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|werge: He must play @D now|pg||

nt|werge: Well - West must find the lead|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: west is worried that heart is too slow|pg||
nt|werge: When West shows both @D-honours, North will know, that the @S Kind is OK|pg||
nt|werge: King|pg||
nt|lestergold: considering a club switch we can see would be a defensive disaster|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||

pc|h7|nt|lestergold: communications awkward for declarer|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: no green cards in your box? - If I was forced to bid then 2@D (Michael - 5-4)|pg||
nt|snorris: 8hp and a stiff king in @d|pg||

nt|frankaus: pass hardest bid in bridge|pg||

pc|dT|nt|werge: Best defence would have been to tak the secon @D, clear the @D-suit - and block declarer in dummy|pg||

mb|2H|nt|mariner1: now the antepenultimate board........|pg||
nt|werge: Slam N/S - but West will bid a weak two or more|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Minor slam|pg||
nt|mariner1: a rabbi makes 7@C here|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: Sweden now has three boards to go to recover 14 imps.|pg||
nt|mariner1: or 7@D|pg||
nt|werge: East has the hand for bidding 5 @H first time|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6 @c or @D likely|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: Rabbi's Rule = when King is singleton play the Ace|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|werge: 4 @H - like my grandmother - we say in danish: Gibe them the KNIFE|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i dont thing this is exciting enuf to produce a significant contribution to that 14 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: Give|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this is a lot less than slam|pg||
nt|werge: OK - 300 cheaper than me|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chick: and on the final 2, judging by the other table, not much swing available|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
nt|werge: In fact - hoe should N/S recover after the 4 @H-bid?|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridge.is/results - results and butler|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I have another experssion. Give them enough with rope and they will hang themselves|pg||
nt|werge: South MUST double - and North?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me 4nt|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - but never a slam now|pg||
nt|mariner1: our next session after these last 3 boards is in 86 minutes|pg||
nt|werge: This no junior-board - South will learn, that all honors work well, and partner has only a few @h´s|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why not a slam? over 4NT, I think S has a clear 5NT bid. he doubled 4H yet ALL his cards are outside hearts|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: well 1n will make in some comfort|pg||
nt|lestergold: i expect 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|othered1: north rebid right up the line, a style I like, but many would rebid 1N to define a weak NT type opener.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|wilkinsona: EW getting out cheaply here it seems|pg||
