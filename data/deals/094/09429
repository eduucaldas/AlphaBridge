nt|brolucius: South's initial negative double (when holding four-card spade support) is unorthodox - in the Open Room.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brolucius: I doubt that South here will replicate it.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|brolucius: East may bid 3@C anyway. No, 2@C.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And his subsequent decision to play hearts (not spades) showed individuality|pg||

nt|brolucius: A sound analysis by Hans Werge.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bjacobs: Yes, but why the analysis includes the value of Pi, I'm not sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: N-S judged their own prospects accurately. But 4@C seems to be fine for E-W.|pg||

nt|brolucius: An inch of dust?|pg||
nt|werge: Endstation OK here|pg||

nt|marlowepi: welcome back all. scotland didn't get kilt in the first half, but they do trail by the narrowest of margins|pg||
nt|viren169: hi all|pg||
nt|jallerton: Both teams still in contention|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: and we're off.|pg||
nt|eamongall: at first glance I don't see much for anyone ...|pg||
nt|eamongall: I will hazard a guess at EW playing in 1NT |pg||
nt|viren169: Off we go...|pg||
nt|mowen: Could make a difference - probably to who comes 2nd!|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|viren169: Is Norman in his seat?|pg||
nt|werge: hi all|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcomyn: Morning all|pg||
nt|viren169: partscore to start off with|pg||
nt|jallerton: Welcome back|pg||
nt|mowen: hello Frances|pg||
nt|werge: Interesting board - it happens, that these minors bring in 12 tricks|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: hi Mike from Reading England here|pg||
nt|mowen: hi all|pg||
nt|finch: Hi Steve|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone!|pg||
nt|mowen: EBU have done v well|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jallerton: EW play strong @c|pg||
nt|mowen: I gather Garvey/Cooke have an unusual system|pg||
nt|finch: yes.  For the first board, sufficient to know that it includes a strong club|pg||
nt|finch: I have the WBF card and 43-page system file in front of me|pg||
nt|mowen: nice solid overcall by west|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s = constructive raise, 7-10 with 3-card support|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Tim :)|pg||
nt|henryb: Hi|pg||
nt|mariner1: well we start with a slam here|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores though someone could get pushed up|pg||
mb|5C|nt|viren169: dreaded 4441 hand to start...|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: Hi all|pg||
nt|finch: x was 7+ balanced|pg||
nt|mowen: allows east to muddy the waters|pg||
nt|finch: welcome also to Graham Osborne who will be with us for the first few boards|pg||
nt|mowen: hi Graham|pg||
nt|finch: The first page of the system file tells us that "the declarership can often be swtiched to either side (ideal for mixed pairs)"|pg||
nt|finch: Though I'm not sure they've ever found anyone else prepared to play the system with them!|pg||
nt|viren169: yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N is a forcing raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: welcome all|pg||
nt|mowen: its hard to play in the style of Martin Garvey|pg||
nt|mowen: well someone is in his seat:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3NT is a make here, but some NS might alternatively fetch up in the 4-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|finch: Never a truer word was said|pg||
nt|eamongall: For EBU we have Martin Garvey and Jon Cooke a regular pairing playing on BBO most nights with various English juniors and ex-junios|pg||
nt|viren169: Selway is there now...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|viren169: Hi Michael|pg||
nt|werge: Safety play in trumps here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|viren169: Interesting South did not dble weak NT|pg||
nt|viren169: Just as well!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: transfer & delayed raise to game = mild slam try for pairs playing Texas (4-level transfer), the latter showing no slam aspirations|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are some options inb the defense and play revolving around the club suit|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
nt|henryb: DOIGB|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S is destined to go off...|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: This is a really vital match between holders and England. If I see correctly, Derek O'Gorman and TerryWalsh are in much to my surprise as they are Trophy debutants|pg||
nt|finch: Final contract the normal one, however|pg||
nt|mowen: easy 11 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb: which stands for Down One Is Good Bridge|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure I like 2N...|pg||
nt|mowen: yup, looks like -1|pg||
nt|mariner1: K@C K@H off for NS though K@H may not come into play|pg||
nt|mariner1: -1 likely|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Bob|pg||
nt|bobh1: decent imps contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S and a @H back beats it 2|pg||
nt|othered1: Early @D play will beat this|pg||
nt|mcarroll: if def lead a @D at any stage before trumps are drawn dummy is dead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Staffan Hed. Go'kväll Sverige!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Marshall Lewis and Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|jcomyn: This is a baptism of fire for them|pg||
nt|mayors: Hi Steve,Frances and Specs|pg||
nt|jallerton: With 3 diamond losers, he'll need to pick up the spades for no loser|pg||
nt|jallerton: This lead puts dec. in dummy.  Will he win and finesse spades immediately?|pg||
nt|jallerton: From dec.'s point of view, @d may be 2-2 in which case a spade loser can be afforded|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@S is enough after overcalling...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@h is possible|pg||
nt|mariner1: or even 1@S and a @H back|pg||
pc|s8|nt|paulg: Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hi Roland & Paul & specs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: was 2NT something special? or intended as such? it doesn't seem to leap off the screen on the N hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N interesting,,,,,,,,, must be systemic for them|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cindy: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi cindy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: That is Walsh not Walshe operator|pg||
nt|viren169: Cards well placed for declarer.|pg||
nt|chick: making is better :)|pg||
nt|mowen: a bit keen, I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4N key card, 5@D showing 0-3|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@h transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: good evening everybody, the weather is sunny and warm for the year|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry martin! -1 with right defence. after @cQ play a @d|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mariner1: aha so the 3N was specific @S shortness|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jallerton: Cameron says S too strong for 2@s.  But no spade honours and AK d/ton|pg||
nt|eamongall: for Ireland we have Derek O Gorman ...who played in World Pairs Final back in 1990 as a 20 year old  but has been retired since about 1993 from serious bridge |pg||
nt|ppiglett: West missed the suit pref card of the 6D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: wanted to set up his spades if pd had xx|pg||
nt|eamongall: and his partner Terry Walsh who is well known on the Dublin bridge scene..|pg||
nt|eamongall: both making their Camrose debut |pg||
nt|eamongall: I take a point from the gallery ...."Camrose is not serious bridge" ...  I think the players involved are taking it seriously |pg||
nt|sybarra: had to eat a club also |pg||
nt|sybarra: -2 looks right |pg||
nt|mariner1: well -1 now|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes we seemed to have "wrong side" the next lead |pg||
nt|mariner1: the @H losers disappear on the @c|pg||
pc|dK|nt|viren169: Declarer will be uncomfortable in 2N but will eventually come up with 8 tricks!|pg||
nt|viren169: bit too much to drink?|pg||
nt|mariner1: very well bid, now to make though play should be fairly quick|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks looks easy|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and should make 13 in fact|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jallerton: S was never going to find @cK lead at trick 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lucky lead the favourable lie oft he sapdes looks like will see this soemwhat shaky 3n home|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odd not to cash a top club before the third spade|pg||
nt|henryb: well on this hand N-S would make 3@c for 110, and 3@h will lose two diamonds and one of each for -50|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ppiglett: Agreed about the S but one off is a f|pg||
nt|ppiglett: good plan|pg||
nt|mariner1: been trying to come up with some brilliant reason why it should  be obvious for E|pg||
nt|mariner1: to return a @H,,,,,, have yet to come up with something even I would believe :)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mowen: bit early for too much to drink:)-2 now I fear, with 3 trump losers...|pg||
nt|viren169: Surprized Pat did not consider tapping it on the way out...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but declarer made ih himself|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Trus Ralf|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The right play is to cash @cA and @cK and then @d|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|eamongall: Thomas Hanlon indicates its time for a comeback ....however I edited his comment |pg||
pc|h8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: somehow I dont think this is right|pg||
nt|lestergold: i own club in london|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry that was meant to be private|pg||

nt|mowen: 11 tricks what a shock|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@s or 4@s opener?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: two off would have been better with the club switch!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Peter Goodman from Wales|pg||
nt|mariner1: "it might be worth a shot" does not quite live up to brilliance|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk5: http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/Camrose2009Results.htm  for results and standing after round 1 (including carryover from the first weekend)|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@C here|pg||
nt|mayors: 6! s looks good e/w till you see the break|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this would be a close match except for the digit issue House has.........|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: Spears and Murdoch are both experienced players but a relatively new partnership|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we can see that S made a correct evaluation of the slam potential of the S hand even facing a weak NT on that deal by observing that if the 2 black queens in the N hand were ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: instead the ace of clubs, slam would be a favorite|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d 10-15, no 5-card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: hm, W has written down +100 ... Cooke has -50|pg||
nt|viren169: another 4@S destined to go off...|pg||

nt|mariner1: Results|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in effect, the fourth spade squeezed E (non-materially) out of the club spot which would have given S a losing option in the play|pg||
nt|viren169: guess in spades for overtrick|pg||
nt|mowen: now Shields/Denning chance to show their strong club|pg||
nt|finch: Yes, it's huge|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Peter :)|pg||
nt|viren169: Light opening... yet again!|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|finch: I doubt they can make it however with South being short in both clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|mowen: looks like it|pg||
nt|bobh1: another good game that the gods are conspiring against|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcomyn: but will stay till then|pg||

nt|petepunt: afternoon all|pg||
pc|s8|nt|cindy: not sure i would be leaping over 1S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S is worth more than 2D but is hoping to be able to bid spades at a convenient level so making a slight tactical underbid|pg||
nt|lestergold: Howard's spade overall at unfavourable vulnerability was not recopmmended by my freat grandmother|pg||
nt|mayors: yes would agree|pg||
nt|mowen: I know players who would have bid S@s as south|pg||
nt|finch: The system cards are at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: predictable lead giving a much needed trick|pg||
nt|jallerton: win in hand and play @sQ.  West needs to duck this|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer will win in hand and try a spade which west has to duck to ensure the killing of the suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes though a defense slip might allow 4@S if they get there|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: does not seem likely though|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: sorry Jeffery snp|pg||
nt|finch: EW play a more natural style of strong club, 1NT was FG balanced and 2@H natural|pg||
nt|jcomyn: h well placed for 3N  but willbe in 4S|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c = relay .  I think 2NT is too.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: good day from sunny vancouver|pg||
nt|finch: 2NT showed a doubleton heart, 3@S natural and 4@C a cue for spades|pg||
nt|mowen: and so to 6@S but can they make it?|pg||
nt|eamongall: this appears to have 3 tricks to lose|pg||
nt|mowen: tempting at this vul|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Do you agree with P on E? I vote for 1@s|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW could have played @S yes|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi martin|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: i don;t understand that double at all|pg||
nt|ppiglett: A little unlucky|pg||
nt|eamongall: he has the none working @S finesse ..available |pg||
nt|eamongall: for a @H pitch|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke looking at @hJ|pg||
nt|henryb: really, the false preference! they must promise 5+ clubs for this auction|pg||
nt|chick: many people these days are playing that 1@S shows an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes rebids 1nt with bal 15-17 even with 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: high @S lead will make this easy for declarer (who had 7 tricks even on a low lead)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharkirl: reprieve|pg||
nt|viren169: Now N/S will be going to the races... |pg||
nt|viren169: Somebody ought to tell Norman he is not as young as he use to be!|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|james_h: Operator please Click on North and change to 'Walsh'|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 club tricks now one spade and one heart thats 5 tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: h lead might have caused problems this wont|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not a small @s with no entrance?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: N didn't double, and S has close to zero defense|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulg: i don't really understand North's pass .. no reason for this to be forcing is there?|pg||
nt|finch: In the England match against NI, Townsend has gone two off in 6@S when we rose with the ace of hearts on a heart lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes now may make overtrick(s)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: are we on together James|pg||
nt|viren169: with Q of @S instead of Q@D 7 is a good contract|pg||
nt|sharkirl: may well bid 7|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to find out about the Q of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: mybe an endplay against eat at some point form a sixth trick but seven looks unlikely|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|eamongall: split trump honors was required ...so unlucky|pg||
nt|henryb: but in that style South should respond 1@h, not 1@d|pg||
nt|petepunt: n/s weak nt |pg||
pc|d6|nt|barbyh: das it, you it|pg||
nt|james_h: thanks operator!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cindy: its not forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: none at all|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@S is 2 with Q|pg||
nt|mowen: don't thik it is possible with south only holding 2 clubs |pg||
nt|eamongall: and the 10 onside contributes our Sydney correspondant Thomas Hanlon|pg||
nt|eamongall: and as maker64 indicates the @D5 can gorw |pg||
nt|ciaran: Promoted a third trump there by overtaking the @D6 if that's how play went|pg||
nt|eamongall: gorw|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|viren169: 6@C probably denies any kings|pg||
nt|jallerton: Even on a @h lead, declarer will test the spades, see S show out and take rthe marked finesse|pg||
nt|eamongall: grow |pg||
nt|ppiglett: We've all been in worse - Tom?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: endplay inevitable really|pg||
nt|jallerton: Eastshort of exits|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Small @S lead would be my choice|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, east will have no trouble if @C comes back, no choice but K|pg||
pc|h8|nt|james_h: Pat is hoping Adam will wake up with the Q@S|pg||
nt|viren169: N is still none the wiser...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulg: @hK would test North|pg||
nt|james_h: thats why Pat used 5NT|pg||
nt|finch: you might be able to do it if South is something like 5314, but even then I think you need slightly better spade pips|pg||
nt|finch: I shall be surprised if this is not a flat board, +- the odd 50 points|pg||
nt|mowen: bridge can be a hard game|pg||
nt|henryb: indeed, but still, if North will rebid 1N with a balanced 15-17, you lose the value of opening 1@c with a strong NT when South does not respond 1@h and North will not rebid 1@h ...|pg||

nt|james_h: as south has denies the DK |pg||
pc|h9|nt|james_h: Morning John|pg||
nt|viren169: yes|pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulg: you have to guess the spades in 5@d to make, although you are favourite to do so|pg||
nt|paulg: North's lack of a double may work to his advantage here|pg||
nt|paulg: as I expect Spears will eventually play the @sK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strange bidding & strange defense|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: ht then best of a bad lot|pg||
nt|viren169: Espen wont be too happy with the result... although after passing... 4@S will still be reached.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|viren169: declarer will eliminate the hand and end up hooking the spade Q when nothing else works.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|finch: fantasy question: can EW make 6@C?  Slightly less fantasy question: can they make 6@H?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think he will tahe his tricks outside @c|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: and he can endplay east again|pg||
nt|jallerton: should have played the J|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes he needed to try and create an entry for his partner|pg||

nt|petepunt: u will plat 1n with 44 major fits yes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N now has no choice except @C |pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: and strange line of play for that matter|pg||
nt|lestergold: east should have seen the position|pg||
nt|finch: double dummy, 6@S was makeable.  But cashing one top spade was too late, so no-one will make at the table|pg||

nt|brolucius: An excellent slam because you have a club discard for the diamond loser.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|an|0-7|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: At the other table East bid Unusual 2NT over 1@H and South used one of the minor-suit bids (3@C) to show a strong heart raise.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: That method is known in the USA as Unusual over Unusual.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 7@D doubled is par|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, unless North try 7@H ...|pg||
nt|werge: Good bidding by East and West|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and you wonder when hearts are going to be bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be easier for N-S is South had been allowed to bid 2@H to show a positivie response with at least five hearts.|pg||
nt|werge: Has anybody showm @h-suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: South will not like his doubleton diamond now, although the E-W bidding has suggested that north will hold a singleton diamond at most.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A Pass by South will be forcing and doubtless a stronger move than Double. Ah, he has passed.|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Breathes life into the match|pg||
nt|brolucius: Very effective pre-emption and this shows how the Precision Club system can be disrupted. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Particularly white versus red|pg||
nt|werge: This 13-IMP victory is well deserved|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This vulnerability is so unpleasant for strong-clubbers|pg||
nt|brolucius: South should be able to bid 2@H. No point in wasting time with a pointless double and not showing your five-card major.|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|jcomyn: our bridge world here shocked with yesterdays Scottish result - anyone know what happened|pg||

nt|jallerton: I expect Scotland played better!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: yep, and he's duly tonked 1S|pg||
nt|eamongall: tonking ...in galligan language = leading by a large score |pg||
nt|roswolf: the "good" team may be in trouble here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mayors: To make 6@s on previous board is completely DD|pg||
nt|mowen: 9 tricks? or 10?|pg||
nt|finch: They play this as fairly constructive, but this is still top of the range|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an understatement|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that was Ireland's worst ever result since we returned to the Camrose|pg||
nt|viren169: Norman a bit good for 1NT|pg||
nt|othered1: If east doesn't sell, there will be trouble, possibly big|pg||

nt|viren169: only 8 tricks avaialble for declarer...|pg||
nt|eamongall: Peter ...as you can see tonk can be used as a description of double as well |pg||
nt|ppiglett: rdble - tonk tonk then?|pg||
nt|eamongall: you can have takeout tonks ..competitive tonks and lead directing tonks and penalty tonks |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: the Eng-Sco result could be good for EBU, who play Scotland in the last match|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@C shows much more here|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this is difficult|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jferg: the n.i pair play a strong club system with 14 16 no trump|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is this a weak no trump pair for N ireland|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok|pg||
nt|viren169: not sure what South was planning... but it has turned a plus score to a minus!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably the cheapest with pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: pass is cheaper here and W does it|pg||
nt|mariner1: N should boost to 5,,,,, not a real defensice hand, yet..........|pg||
nt|mariner1: defensive|pg||
nt|sybarra: he could even bid 5 @C on the way?|pg||
nt|othered1: At least they managed to bail out at a low level with the cards not friendly at all.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|james_h: Terry passing the buck|pg||
nt|lestergold: at t5his vulernability i would have ventured 2c by south|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the best west could do.  Those who take out takeout doubles would be punished here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzkp: you can also have insufficient tonks|pg||
nt|viren169: S may tap in on the way out!|pg||
nt|viren169: He has seen 3rd in hand openings before...|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mowen: the Sing Q@H is useful|pg||
nt|finch: did you work that out all on your own?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Heart leads will promote @sQ.  However, with @cK onside that is it for the defence|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Did well to buy this one|pg||
nt|mowen: kindly minor breaks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: cards lay as you would place them |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to use jumps by opener if 12-14, but if 14-16 ok. still, does S jump every time he has a 4 card fit?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good shot by Terry|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like e/w are overboard|pg||
nt|henryb: Much more after partner bids 2@d? I think that W hand makes up in playing strength and controls what it lacks in high cards|pg||
nt|chick: E may not be sure if 5@C is a slam try, lead directing, or offer of another place to play|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: well he cant like the S suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: even after the lead-directing 1@d opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: that lead lookds costly but actually there is always one dim loser|pg||
nt|chick: fortunately, his 5@H bid is right in all those cases|pg||
pc|s8|nt|james_h: a try scored ... now for the crutial conversion|pg||
nt|jcomyn: c James not t|pg||
nt|james_h: crucial|pg||
nt|james_h: thx JC|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good morning all|pg||
nt|james_h: Is Selway a sponsor? can anyone tell me?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a pushy game but it makes as long as he kicks straight. That would be a real positive start|pg||
nt|james_h: Played with Espen Erichsen many years ago in the TGR|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi Ciaran. An all-Irish team bedad|pg||
nt|james_h: He is a Norwegial/English pro on the circuit|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm  for convention cards|pg||
nt|viren169: and didnt lead pd's suit!|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jferg: they were very unlucky in our trials finishing third 1 vp behind second|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: together with a club and two spads unless the defence carve up|pg||
nt|jallerton: possible endplay vs N|pg||
nt|lestergold: three qs equally 6 questionable points not really enuf for game opposite a strong nt|pg||
nt|jallerton: small club from dummy, what can North do?|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has to duck but may well not|pg||
nt|lestergold: i still say that south should hav ebid 2c- if nothing else it would have hlped the defence bhere|pg||
nt|jallerton: they may not play 2@c as natural here|pg||
nt|lestergold: that would explain things|pg||
nt|jallerton: quite a few pairs play it as some major suit take-out|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate east seems to be a long time in the tank|pg||
nt|henryb: whatever it is with no aces East can only bid 5@h|pg||
nt|petepunt: townsend gold in silver medal eng bejing team last oct 5@C will show about this|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ciaran: safe trip - talk to you later in the week..  wd in teams|pg||
nt|ciaran: sorry - private|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: claimed on the spot "unless you're ruffing"|pg||
nt|ciaran: 3H was likely to be beaten by repeated spade leads promoting the @HJ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: this will test Derek|pg||
nt|finch: 9 tricks, losing two spades a diamond and a heart|pg||

nt|ralfwil: That´s not my lead. Ruffs when I have a good 5-card trumph? |pg||
pc|c6|nt|jferg: they jump with min and a 4 card fit, bid a weak suit with a max|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcomyn: well done already|pg||
nt|viren169: small @S would have been better|pg||
nt|mariner1: claim coming pull trumps and its over|pg||
nt|mariner1: could be a big swing there|pg||
nt|mariner1: Shirley he could have indeed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|viren169: Looks like declarer didn't believe N either!|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks very top-end for a mixed raise, but probably not quite a limit raise either. still, i would hesitate to bid only 2H with a stiff spade (even the king) in a hand that has a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: high offense-to-defense ratio. nothing matters on this deal, of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes seems counter-intuitive|pg||
nt|othered1: did west show @C with the 2@C bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: 2@C showed 4+H and another suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: no looked a singleton obviously|pg||
nt|werge: Normally his cards show you the answer|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: i think you can afford jump raises when not vulnerable, but should avoid vul or min|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ppiglett: Defence missed their chance with five minor winners and a diamond thru to promote the J|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on min|pg||
nt|henryb: well done. If you did not cash it you would lose it|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: no ruff! Discard a @h!|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|jcomyn: yes hope he sees that|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: I'm not sure with this vulnerabiltiy, that seeing the west hand answers anything.|pg||

nt|barbyh: north is surely shut out now|pg||
nt|paulg: tough for South to introduce hearts now|pg||
nt|cindy: not if N makes neg dbl|pg||
nt|jferg: agree|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mm wont do his confidence much good|pg||
nt|ciaran: 6D makes here on the lucky spade position |pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you agree with 1@h or prefer 1NT?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: TONK|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: said and done!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: wow, the Tonk - "the ultimate opponent"? find that hard to believe at first glance|pg||
nt|chick: doesn't matter much what it meant, same defense|pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: Looks right for declarer to take @C play right away (after pitching @C on @DA)|pg||
nt|mariner1: E hesitated too long :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: belabored auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: not neg|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no marshall, still making 4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could have made 5|pg||
nt|ciaran: in fact with all th heart tricks, the spade position in unnecessary|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what does S do now|pg||
nt|sharkirl: looks like 4@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1NT for me - God deals you 17 to bid 1NT|pg||
nt|henryb: Can N-S sell to the doomed 5@c?|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@C opening on last hand would imply that|pg||
nt|roswolf: might be difficult to reach 4@H now|pg||
nt|werge: My two grandmothers play natural - they would bid 4 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: N/S play strong club|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
mb|3D|nt|paulg: the @dJ denied the @dQ on the previous board, so Spears knew the situation|pg||
nt|jferg: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: some folks get into trouble dbling with a 4-3 in the majs!|pg||
nt|sybarra: should we say NEXT?|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc09/fc_main_en.htm  -|pg||
nt|mariner1: Tournament Site|pg||
nt|mariner1: if you have to ask it sort of removes the effect :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: that solves that good old Black|pg||
nt|ciaran: if that is invitational, looks like a good effort|pg||
nt|mowen: north should not be too hopeful opposite 14-16|pg||
nt|finch: 2@C showed hearts, either weak or 4+ cards invitational (or stronger)|pg||
nt|ciaran: I slightly pefer 1H since you can still get to NT whereas a heart fit might be lost|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that 1D opening makes me feel a bit ill|pg||
nt|jallerton: A very good 17-count of course. |pg||
nt|ianrei: i prefer 1H - now they also play 2C|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: lotta action for a deal that might have gone 1@h all pass|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/Camrose2009Results.htm  for results and standing before the last round (including carryover from the first weekend). England 3 VPs clear of the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: EBU. Only these two teams can win the trophy|pg||
nt|petepunt: eng(1) 154 eng(2) 151 wal 133 ire 128|pg||
nt|henryb: I would not be able to with the N hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|viren169: looks like declarer will get the trumps right and come to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkirl: agree|pg||
nt|viren169: via 5@S + 4@C + 1@H|pg||
nt|sharkirl: line taken should be high @C, AK@S |pg||
nt|viren169: I am sure Brunner will be itching to play a @D as soon as she gets in.|pg||
nt|lestergold: a no prob 4s here|pg||
nt|henryb: Looks like Wales could win with a blitz and a big Scottish win|pg||
nt|othered1: possible that all good hands have to go through 2@D, not necessarily a positive feature of the system.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: if W had raised clubs, N could make resp dbl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: re-wind now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 5S re-bubbled|pg||
nt|james_h: odd double considering he is on lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: big chance here|pg||
nt|james_h: Derek thinks oh No!|pg||
nt|eamongall: who would that be now ....Tonk Hamman ? |pg||
nt|eamongall: or Tonk Helness the ultimate opponent|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: that sounds better. Meanwhile, Cooke is wishing he hadn't reopened.|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Tonk Diamond - it works wonders!|pg||
nt|henryb: Would need to win by about 70|pg||
nt|viren169: Pass seem better over 2@S...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: now W is on the horns|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like best declarer can do is drop he @HJ to escape for -2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: will he X that as well|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes|pg||
nt|jallerton: Easier to play in 3NT if you overcall 1NT though|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this will be fun|pg||
nt|werge: Might be 13 IMP´s for my family scoring 650|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd feel uncomfortable not getting AK10xx in a major into the auction.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: N a bit thin to double, with a terrible suit, no fit & only 6 HCP . OK at the 2 level but not at the 3 level, esp. vul|pg||
nt|paulg: when you open with that rubbish in the East seat, with only 3 major cards, you do not expect to play the contract|pg||
nt|othered1: Opening bid and lead make it very likely !@CA is onside|pg||
pc|h3|nt|james_h: yes|pg||
nt|mowen: will do well to get close to this|pg||
nt|henryb: and have Scotland win by about 50|pg||
nt|henryb: all very unlikely, but still possible|pg||
pc|h9|nt|james_h: no|pg||
nt|james_h: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone work out 5Sxx+1|pg||
nt|mowen: has a chance with no @S lead|pg||
nt|mayors: They have to lead spade to beat it, otherwise with @D guess makes|pg||
nt|jallerton: unlilely that partner has a diamond stop|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke checking signals now|pg||
nt|eamongall: Peter not everybody would remember Double Diamond ...it was a beer I think |pg||
nt|werge: It seems more logical to show the @H-suit insyead of @D |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|barbyh: todays his lucky day|pg||
nt|ciaran: selway now wishing he had doubled! will soon be glad he did not!|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes - every option has flaws..|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lot of bidding on that lot|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Agreed - three hearts a spade and a club|pg||
nt|mariner1: and with E having only 1@S there is no threat of a @c ruff now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Also as E has shown @hAK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cindy: right but N should be willing to play 2S  not to go to 3 level though|pg||
nt|ciaran: if hearts are raised, you can try NT next|pg||
nt|jcomyn: question is would Carroll have x 1NT|pg||
nt|ciaran: I expect he would, but Garvey would pull to 2D|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: brilliant|pg||
nt|viren169: Not much extra for East's hand? Any views?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|james_h: Terry will now give out to Derek for his bidding on this hand, his play on the last and proceed to make|pg||
nt|finch: trump lead seems horribly passive|pg||
nt|finch: sorry, 2@C was normal stayman.  The system changes completely when responder is a passed hand.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @hKQ!!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ppiglett: thanks!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/Camrose2009Results.htm  for results and standing after round 3 (including carryover from the first weekend)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: not you, Cooke's @hQ !|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well done.  Continuing the Q was his legitimate play, but the defense at least offered him a losing option by ducking the first @H|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ppiglett: I dont think he was flying to dummy to finesse|pg||
nt|othered1: Steffan advises that 2@H response to 2@C would be nonforcing.  Old Blue Team Club played that way, but it's proponents changed that eventually.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may well make|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: accurate defence should simply hold it to ten tricks|pg||
nt|mayors: Spade goes on long @c with them 3-3|pg||
nt|jallerton: another heart; will declarer finesse?|pg||
nt|petepunt: will be first time Ireland not won for 4 years|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Ian Reissmann from England|pg||
nt|mowen: would never pass over 2@s, but opener might have passed...|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mayors: I think he'll get @d right on the lead  as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: might make this even!|pg||
nt|othered1: East likely would have led stiff @C, if he had had it.|pg||
nt|othered1: Sorry, it's Staffan.|pg||
nt|werge: But it´s a very bad contract - now making because of a suit 3-3 with the Queen on-side|pg||
nt|roswolf: may be not now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ciaran: club leads hold 5SXX to 11 tricks and I think he'd be leading them|pg||
nt|sharkirl: prbly @D to K now?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|james_h: just trying to set the scene|pg||
nt|viren169: We have a few specs questioning 3@S too!|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkirl: nope  lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually i tyhink there is a play for an overtrick after all if declarer elminates the reds tghen plays a club to the J east will be endplayed|pg||
nt|ppiglett: The spade return was not the best and has caused this problem |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|viren169: nice play|pg||
nt|viren169: caught West napping!|pg||
nt|sharkirl: :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: very true Ed|pg||
pc|h8|nt|barbyh: who knew clubs cd be so premptive|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is there a 6th trick?|pg||
nt|jallerton: No|pg||
nt|ciaran: Though a minute ago, I didn't think there was a 5th trick either|pg||
nt|jallerton: EBU gained by bidding the thin game on board 1.  Ireland played in 3@s =|pg||
nt|mariner1: that looks awfully flat|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mayors: although when it comes to the guess he won't know clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|finch: well, he'll know that West didn't lead a club away from the king, how does that tell him that we would lead a diamond from the queen?|pg||
nt|finch: as you say, if West plays a diamond now he may finesse as that will generate a spade discard from table if the queen is right|pg||
nt|mowen: tough choice for west now|pg||
nt|mowen: maybe just return a club|pg||
nt|mowen: a diamond is much more likely to be from Ace than Queen|pg||
nt|chick: well, it would be more fun to have a lot closer race|pg||
pc|hT|nt|viren169: easy come... easy go!|pg||
nt|finch: the diamond discard was reverse count in diamonds, I believe, or possibly suit preference|pg||
nt|mayors: Yes agree Steve.  I think he's going to make from here|pg||
nt|mowen: a good result if he does|pg||
nt|finch: counting his entries, he should win the spade in the dummy|pg||
nt|mowen: play the king to keep ace as an entry|pg||
nt|finch: if he wins in hand East can duck the second club, win the third and stick declarer in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|mayors: The lead deserves to lose a game swing|pg||
nt|finch: I agree.  |pg||
nt|mowen: is a spade obvious?|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@S doesnt show anything extra... does it?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must be -1 now!|pg||
nt|werge: Logical lead and defence = play to UNBID suit |pg||
nt|werge: the unbid|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg: the other perennial question is whether to overcall or double with 5-4 majors|pg||
nt|mowen: and which one?|pg||
nt|petepunt: Wales will still want to winnthis head to head so fun it will be :)|pg||
nt|mowen: But 2@s was not forced - W could have passed over 2@d, with such a minimum hand|pg||
pc|d9|nt|finch: I don't mind a club that much (which would not be successful) but I hate the trump lead|pg||
nt|mayors: low or J I don't mind that much|pg||
nt|finch: Jon Cooke may have decided to take the diamond finesse instead by winning hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: hes got enuf trumps to do it entry wise too|pg||
nt|viren169: Pass would deny a maj in my book...|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|barbyh: when your sp suit is q 5th and you hts much better Im for dbling|pg||
nt|ppiglett: making|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d4|nt|mowen: wow|pg||
nt|finch: a spade back still beats it at this point|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mayors: Surely he's going to play a spade now|pg||
nt|finch: no|pg||
nt|mayors: he knows partner has @c ace|pg||
nt|finch: By the way, either Vugraph has crashed, or Robson is still thinking in 6@S on board 18|pg||
nt|mayors: I think cooke is going to finesse here|pg||
nt|mowen: will he believe he has AQ?|pg||
nt|finch: it's quite difficult to work out what West's hand might be, as this defence is very strange|pg||
nt|finch: he probably 'ought' to finesse, as that is what he had decided to play for originally|pg||
nt|mowen: well I think it does, he only has a weak NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now east can discard a @c|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: maybe not|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting point... to discuss with your pd... I guess you will get different views on this one|pg||
pc|c8|nt|viren169: now back to the 10 we had at the start!|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|cindy: i usually overcall unless the 4 card suit quality is much better than 5 card suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: can/should make now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sharkirl: that has to be wrong|pg||
pc|c5|nt|viren169: small to the K@D seemed normal|pg||
nt|sharkirl: must be J@C|pg||
nt|mowen: when you have to open a weak NT with a suit because of system & then it gets competitive, surely an early pass says this, never mind what suits you hold|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|brolucius: This is the 2@C opener that I saw earlier, when I was in the Open Room. Not a strong part of the system to have to open at the two-level on such a feeble suit.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|werge: Strange claim-result?|pg||
nt|brolucius: In 3NT at the other table, North led the @D9. Short of entries to the table (East), declarer broached the clubs by running  the @C10 from his hand.|pg||

nt|james_h: If you open your windows in Dublin, you should hear Terry quite clearly|pg||
nt|sharkirl: as u say same 10 tricks with some fancy footwork in between|pg||
nt|finch: Jon is going to be very cross about this hand afterwards... even though he took a sensible line|pg||
nt|mayors: well I Think the welsh are very lucky to have defeated this|pg||
nt|mowen: so A@D beat the contract|pg||
nt|finch: with the very favourable club lie, 4@H can be made on any lead here|pg||
nt|mowen: if west played low what would he have done?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke looks a bit happier now|pg||
nt|eamongall: panic kind of set in and the defence remained with its best source of tricks in tact at the end |pg||
nt|ppiglett: I'd say|pg||
nt|viren169: Np as 3@S was brought home safely!|pg||
nt|viren169: Nice hand now...|pg||
nt|mowen: for who?:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 21 - 19 and not much here it seems|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I can recommend Kelsey´s book Killing defence|pg||
mb|1N|nt|james_h: Joking of course|pg||
nt|othered1: Well, EW didn't get a chance to be bullied into a bad-scoring red spot.|pg||
nt|mariner1: no slam EW though they could end up in one............|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E must have a full count on N, so????|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: east needs to find a club lead against 3nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this one is tough, can not stayman and show diamonds unless playing 2 way stayman|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c multi-way|pg||
nt|mayors: 1@s 5+ hearts|pg||
nt|finch: when he won the spade switch in hand, he was clearly planning to take the diamond fineese|pg||
nt|othered1: unlucky @S and @C positions could even beat 4@S, if east goes wrong|pg||
nt|ralfwil: missing two aces (@dA and @sK), so probably no slam|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: no u are right I heard him|pg||
nt|viren169: fancy footwork to keep us entertained!|pg||
nt|jallerton: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@D by E/W|pg||
nt|viren169: they should reach game now!|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have a rare VUL save in 5@D over 4@S or 5@C... but that might shove NS|pg||
nt|mariner1: higher to a losing spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: think he will after S shows hearts|pg||
nt|jferg: think he will t/fer to dias|pg||
nt|cindy: he shouldnt txf to diamonds|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like 2@H should go two down|pg||
nt|mowen: 2@c precision style, no hesitation from Norman showing longer suit...lucky him|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: n/s can probably make 5c with trhe very favourable heart position|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: I like the way Terry discarded the notion of a 4-4 spade fit and proceeded with Diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: good pass by N...keep N/S safe from going minus!|pg||
nt|mowen: is the system designed for confusion or is there constructive reasons|pg||
nt|finch: 2@D is a good heart raise, at least INV; 2@S showed a maximum (possibly a slightly optimistic maximum)|pg||
nt|finch: maximum in the context of not opening a strong club|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good decision to bid here - looks like defense will beat 1N|pg||
nt|ciaran: Must show 4/4 and a max?|pg||
nt|jallerton: What does Stayman mean in Ireland?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: think Carroll said "both M" but not sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: (for 3@c)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes it shows both|pg||
nt|jallerton: In most of the world, 2@d, 2@h and 2@s are the only permitted responses|pg||
nt|ianrei: and now they're too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: In case West has a hand like his actual one and wants to pass any response|pg||
pc|s2|nt|viren169: border line between pass and 1NT in my book|pg||
nt|sharkirl: I would pass |pg||
nt|sharkirl: and be happy to come in later if necessary|pg||
nt|sharkirl: they are playing 4-card Majors|pg||
nt|jcomyn: getting a bit highwith a 6-count|pg||
nt|viren169: wow!!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jferg: i think they play non promisery stayman|pg||
nt|jcomyn: coming|pg||
nt|finch: The system does have theoretical merit|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@S looks like 9 or 10 as card lie|pg||
nt|mariner1: well a @D would have been a better pointy suit to lead here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Best lead!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|VugraphPL1: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/2009/krajowe/gpp/01elblag/emax.html|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well regardless of suit lengths and quality, i think double is pretty dangerous unless you have the specific agreement that if you bid a major over partners 1D advance of your ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double, you show no extra values. i think few pairs have that agreement|pg||
nt|jallerton: May be on unsure gorund here.  How strong is 3@c?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a practical auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east should find club lead, infering hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: i feel south should bid 5c now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n has play but very uncomfortable|pg||
nt|finch: you get a lot more room after the 1@H opening (showing 4+ spades) to sort out the shapes|pg||
nt|mowen: sounds fun!!??|pg||
nt|finch: the system includes a 2@C opening with both majors, reducing the problems of finding a fit in the other major|pg||
nt|eamongall: the bridge correspondant of the Sunday Independant indicates Ireland can win the Senior Camrose this year |pg||
nt|viren169: Norman is on the go-faster stripes stuff!|pg||
nt|othered1: with @S splitting, this is only about overtricks (probably making on nose)|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be certainly|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: this is all wrong|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1H by E 2D by S|pg||
nt|finch: so the 1M openings don't have the other major unless they are max, or 6-4|pg||
nt|finch: Another trump lead, another hand where I wouldn't have led a trump.... this time it makes no different, however|pg||
nt|othered1: Again, east will have to play @S suit right in 5@C|pg||
nt|mariner1: just to hard for NS to come in VUL vs NV|pg||
nt|othered1: if @D lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cindy: is W supposed to throw the J here with Jxxx ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: not an attractive lead vs 3NT as West (if that becomes the final contract)|pg||
nt|ciaran: Trump lead would hold this to 6 or 7 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg: i'd have been slightly nervous as South until dummy came down|pg||
nt|cindy: i agree and if i double and partner bids diamonds, thats where i have to play|pg||
nt|barbyh: but the danger is you lose your other suit|pg||
nt|cindy: so thats why i dont like double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of us only have one suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that lead has improved the prospects|pg||
nt|mowen: how do they find the time to invent and practise|pg||
nt|viren169: the dble slowed him down...|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|cindy: and does this mean W does not have the J ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if NS play that stayman followed by a 2NT rebid over 2S does not promise 4 hearts, that might be a tactically better way to bid the S hand, which in any case is aceless. he can ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trust N to go on most of the time when  he should|pg||
nt|jferg: if they play rev att he will conyinue|pg||
nt|cindy: operator tells me the Q asks for attitude|pg||
nt|finch: they play a huge amount online on BBO|pg||
nt|ciaran: This should be beaten - defense have several chances to find the spade ruff|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@d was presumably a retransfer|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Trump lead shouts out - heart shortage known in dummy and looking at heart length|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|james_h: Derek didnt fly all that way to pass|pg||
nt|jcomyn: strange bid by Terry with singleton D - could be very dangerous|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he'd ate you James if u did that|pg||
nt|james_h: He has to make an effort opposite a Vul Overcall and he has a reasonable hand|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Is Mr C offering odds?|pg||
nt|mowen: hmm, B'wood no help here with such length between them...and a stiff in 3 suits:)|pg||
nt|othered1: That 2@S opening did the job.  If pass, south might try a 3rd seat 2@D (if available) and that might set north off when EW compete|pg||
nt|mariner1: even with @c lead and ruff that would have probably forced E to play @SA and one|pg||
nt|mariner1: to make|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: well 3n is there for then taking as the cards lie|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cant throw jack, partner might underlead and block suit|pg||
nt|mowen: you would lead a @D?|pg||
nt|finch: yes|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cindy: well i know that|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ciaran: the clublead has given declarer a quick re-entry to hand for a second heart ruff|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|viren169: some specs think it is dangerous to pass... |pg||
nt|viren169: It is close...|pg||
nt|mayors: I would also lead a @d|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|jallerton: N's peter in trumps may be suit preference|pg||
nt|ciaran: even if Garey guesses trumps, Howard should find the switch knowing declarer has 4@S|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|cindy: my question was related to their methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, regardless of their agreements, W should try to play a card in tempo. otherwiuse there might be a problem|pg||
nt|ciaran: shows what i know!  much easier looking at all four hands|pg||
nt|ppiglett: absolutely|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: nice play!|pg||
nt|othered1: That did the job in @S. well done|pg||
pc|dT|nt|finch: I tend to make aggressive leads against this type of power auction.  Makes the defence easier later|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cindy: i said i prefer overcall unless on the rare exception when the 4 card suit is MUCH better than the 5 card suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 9 tricks!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With N´s play he had gone down with @s 2-5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a first duck is obvious|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c would also make |pg||
pc|d9|pc|h2|nt|mowen: I'd have xx and waited to see if pard found something useful...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ciaran: Declarer has done very well to get trumps right|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|sharkirl: and vul v non-vul, why stick ur neck out?|pg||
nt|viren169: +80 is likley to create a small swing with only 7 tricks available.|pg||
nt|jallerton: S knows N has 2 spades, but does he know about the ace?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: and east has set up the ninth trick but what could he do|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ianrei: strange anti percentage play in H|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even then i would overcall rather than double. but i would overcall the four-card suit instead of the five:   xxxxx  AKQx  xx Ax|pg||
nt|paulg: a slightly soft defence, but only overtricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|finch: either the lead works well or you've let the contract through... I think the former happens more often than the latter|pg||
nt|mowen: I am in the minority in avoiding leading from kings against suits|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|ciaran: no, but as declarer has four of them, he will score his K regardless, so switching wins when N has the A|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: may not risk the heart finese for the overtrick|pg||
nt|bobh1: endplay avail|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jallerton: but East has to discard|pg||
pc|h6|nt|viren169: specs are swayed by the game bonus when vul... |pg||

mb|4S|nt|brolucius: 3@S is not a game-try, of course, since East could have bid three of a red suit.|pg||

nt|james_h: naturally :) |pg||
nt|jcomyn: another D game with thin values for 11|pg||
nt|sharkirl: agreed|pg||
nt|ianrei: hi all|pg||
nt|ciaran: Ireland gained 12 imps on the board where the defense can promote the trump J in both 2S and 3H |pg||
nt|ppiglett: Excellent H game E-W|pg||
nt|viren169: a possible swing there!|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS seems straight forward here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Welcome to Ian Reissmann,|pg||
nt|mowen: well the other room may find it tough too..|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jferg: could get overbord in 3nt |pg||
nt|sharkirl: perhaps ur right - 1NT bid in other room|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Ian|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@c game forcing I think|pg||
nt|mowen: 3nt by Garvey|pg||
nt|finch: NS have a 500 save against 4@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4 @s games on 6 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: on board 1 in Open they bid and made 7@H|pg||
mb|3D!|an|Bergen|nt|jcomyn: think 5D is now out|pg||
nt|ciaran: First outing in the Camrose for Derek O'Gorman and Terry Walsh this weekend|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5c infrangible |pg||
nt|jallerton: E limited by his failure to open a strong @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 4@S by E/W will be hard to reach...|pg||
nt|lestergold: so is 3n of course but a silly looking contract|pg||
nt|mayors: marginal save but north is flat with QTx @s so they probably wont find|pg||
nt|finch: Agreed it's marginal.  It's worth bidding 5@C on this type of hand because sometimes they bid 5@S and go off|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT may be a good club raise |pg||
nt|ciaran: There was a bigger score than 4H on offer there!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke & O'Gorman checking the clock|pg||
nt|viren169: England are well behind in the match... maybe that is why we are seeing some interesting bidding going on?!?!?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg: lots of values in this hand, but no big fit |pg||
nt|cindy: what with N now ?|pg||
nt|paulg: 2@s or 3@c|pg||
nt|jferg: although lavery show know after the rebid partner has 11 13|pg||
nt|jferg: too late now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt gets my ugly award of the day|pg||
nt|cindy: needed AKQJ of hearts i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: might get heart lead now i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: but shouldnt stop W from play @ss when he gets in|pg||
nt|jferg: still time for a spade switch from sime|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well thats brave|pg||
nt|james_h: My My Derek is getting giggy with it ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will be some effort if they get there|pg||
nt|ciaran: well, hard to see more than one quick loser in @D, though 12 tricks not be possible|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry with drive it home now|pg||
nt|mowen: 4@S is off if clubs are 2-2|pg||
nt|finch: The double of 4@C must be very pure take-out, he's not going to be happy if partner passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: presuming both are forcing|pg||
nt|viren169: Now if East has a way of playing in 3@S... Will he take it?|pg||
nt|finch: not if spades are 2-2 as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: 2-2, 2 if you like|pg||
nt|mowen: true|pg||
nt|bobh1: the 4@s game that was supposed to go down actually was bid and made in the other room|pg||
nt|bobh1: here is a 3n game that is supposed to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: that spade suit is pretty good|pg||
nt|cindy: now he hasnt shown his good spades or his club fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if the reverse is not GF, it should certainly promise another call, so i think N ought to be bidding a black suit over 2H|pg||
nt|cindy: what is this auction ?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: on the last board in the other room they are now in 4@H v the 1@S here|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: wasn't alerted though|pg||
nt|mcarroll: delicate trump suit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg: their convention card is pretty convention-free, so may be 3@c is non-forcing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the 3D call really put N in the soup|pg||
nt|paulg: now forced to bid 4@c, i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if that is so, then N can bid 2S, which is surely forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: what kind of bidding is this?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What is 2NT?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: primitive?|pg||
nt|cindy: thats what i was wondering|pg||
nt|jferg: normal i guess|pg||
nt|cindy: 2N and 5C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT is normal?|pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|jferg: souths diamond maybe as few as one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so ugly and bizarre on same hand|pg||
nt|cindy: even more reason to bid hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, and what would 1@H show as response to 1@D?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Derek is beginning to sweat I can see it on his furrowed brow|pg||
nt|ianrei: what was the X of 2NT ?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Tonking wasn't that productive the last time!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: 80 min or so left|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D shows 6-4?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@C then 1N is 19+ here|pg||
nt|bobh1: the defense with E on lead is not obvious; with W on lead np|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With 5M opening you often will play on 5-3 and not find your 4-4 and as here 5-3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that´s one of the reasons that I don´t like 5-card major o+pening|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cindy: play 3C nonforcing doesnt seem like a good use of methods|pg||
nt|lestergold: iif the defence cashed 4h and a club then this would be shown up as a silly contract but here it rolls in due to the heart blockage|pg||
nt|mayors: I think north has too much stuff to expect a 5 level adventure from EW, especially on this semi scrambling auction|pg||
nt|mowen: S&D have coped well|pg||
nt|finch: I agree.  South had a pretty solid weak jump compared to what he could have had (e.g. 1336 opposite is 800)|pg||
nt|petepunt: too many values in @D is appears|pg||
nt|henryb: only three top losers (well 4 because can't set up a @c) but I expect two down|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Townsend giving a lot of thought to his lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ianrei: 3NT is ok, to go off you need the C finesse to lose and they cash 4H|pg||
nt|ianrei: the right line in 5C isn't clear|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but 5c is a better contract and bears more resmblance to bridge as well|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, they can't cash _five_ hearts straight away v 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do not regard 5hearts to the j opposite a void as a v ery adequate stopper |pg||
nt|jallerton: doubling a natural 2NT seems a bit risky on E with no club trick|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good position for EBU here as 3H makes|pg||
nt|ianrei: 2NT had 8 on top|pg||
nt|ianrei: even 3NT might make|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: mebbe N meant good raise and alerted as such?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: he's the other side of screen|pg||
nt|jallerton: I think Andy likes to play 2NT as natural where possible - but here there is no other call available below 3@c to show a good raise|pg||
nt|ianrei: I expect N/S play 2NT as a raise - John usually does|pg||
nt|ciaran: Slightly surprising result on board 3 in the other room if correct.|pg||
nt|ianrei: andy took some time to bid 2NT (assuming we saw the actual tempo)|pg||
nt|ianrei: if it was a raise would have been obvious|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: took time waiting for tray to come back after 2H so both 2NT and X may have taken time|pg||
nt|henryb: I tould lead a trump with those @s|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sharkirl: that was the danger of bidding 1NT vul|pg||
nt|sharkirl: well bid on  this|pg||
nt|finch: Yes, once the double of 4@C wasn't passed, East could show spades and diamonds, choice of games|pg||
nt|ciaran: Not obvious to double with no trump trick in either hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: prob same effect as e can;t continue @H|pg||
nt|othered1: Has SA Texas (minors transferring to majors) become standard, rather than suit under?  I play that, but it seems uncommon in USA.  See it much more frequently online.|pg||
nt|mariner1: well with 4@C and 4@H in W the defense should be able to hold 3N to set|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jcomyn: Yowza|pg||
nt|sharkirl: and a pressure lead|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer wont be too happy at the start but will come out well as the hand is played out...|pg||
nt|viren169: great lead...|pg||
nt|viren169: prefer a simple 3@H|pg||
pc|cK|nt|finch: If you want to see more of Cooke & Garvey in action, they frequently play late night teams matches|pg||
nt|mowen: 5@D seems a little cowardly|pg||
pc|cA|nt|finch: look for mugsmate and TheGarve|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this comes home it will surely rattle the opps|pg||
nt|othered1: Many (most?) systems place high priority on setting trumps, and secondary fits can be tough to find, since often new suits after agreement are slam tries and may not show length.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|viren169: another slam missed!|pg||
nt|mowen: so down in a game when 6NT is decent|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg: it looks like you have to play the club suit for one loser whereever you end up|pg||
nt|mariner1: board 3, the 4@S DBL making ended in 5@H DBL East in Open|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: i think this is the BMUS system|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 2 a IMPs loss when they let NS play 2@d|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: the real problem is that despite the array of HCP, N does not have such a fasbulously fitting hand that he should be eager to wait until the 4 level to show his fit.|pg||
nt|barbyh: no problem here|pg||
nt|paulg: well there is the trump suit to play|pg||
nt|barbyh: no problem|pg||
nt|cindy: no problem but not a good contract either|pg||
nt|barbyh: d is on and clubs are favorable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty grotty slam. is it that clear to find the winning play in trumps?|pg||
nt|barbyh: how else wd you play it?|pg||
nt|cindy: how can he go wrong ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well he has a very good idea where everything is|pg||
nt|ciaran: Even with the friendly break in clubs and diamonds, might need a heart guess here?|pg||
nt|viren169: another swing...|pg||
nt|mowen: denning never got to show his good values|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: clubs are not so favorable if you start with a small opne from hand|pg||
nt|cindy: could even lead Q from dummy|pg||
nt|barbyh: if the kings not on side j10 fropping is great|pg||
nt|paulg: you don't have many entries to dummy|pg||
nt|paulg: so club to the @cQ and @ck, then finesse on the return to pick up 4-1 clubs |pg||
nt|ppiglett: And with 6 good spades and heart sup|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cindy: beavis ?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: well it worked sort of|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "Beam Me Up, Scotty"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can still beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @CA and another|pg||
nt|cindy: iwould be afraid i would never be able to get another partner if i bid that way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you might have to emigrate then cindy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can;t bowl that slow in this crowd, cindy|pg||
nt|cindy: to ireland ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sime should be able to solve this defense|pg||
nt|jferg: more than welcome wonderful country|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done Derek|pg||
nt|ciaran: Very well done|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|henryb: ten tricks now|pg||
nt|petepunt: whoops a googly in cricket terms|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: home free now|pg||
nt|jallerton: I've known worse "stoppers"|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkirl: still under pressure|pg||
nt|jallerton: often most of the time on the other side of the screen is taken up with explanations!|pg||
nt|othered1: And indeed west here made good decision to go for 590 on board 3.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb: one of the points of a trump lead is that it suggests control of dummy's second suit. |pg||
nt|henryb: So partner will be less tempted to duck the @s|pg||
nt|petepunt: very true,  he did give it a lot of thought too.|pg||
nt|bobh1: actually the defense to 3n is trivial; E just holds up in @d and S has no chance at all|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: so board 3 was 11 imps to OS.se allowing the 4@S DBL|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as we were agreed here in CR, that pass was the best|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|sharkirl: needs @S finesse|pg||
nt|henryb: the other point is to cut down on ruffs!|pg||
nt|petepunt: also no @H overcall by S so likely only 4 yet he jumped to 4@H|pg||
nt|petepunt: wont hold aQ@S surely ?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: well, it is easy enough to see that the club suit comes in when we see all the cards. if not i think there is a fair case for starting with a small one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you start small, then PRC is going to say finesse next time|pg||
nt|ciaran: Doesn' look to be any losing option, but he has a choice whether to pay for @H or @C to break|pg||
nt|ciaran: Can he combine chances?|pg||
nt|viren169: Specs are asking for their money back... can only get better!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb: if he ruffs high, down he will go|pg||
nt|mowen: perhaps he should have raised the 4th suit to show a max of this type of shape|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|viren169: not anymore...|pg||
nt|viren169: all routes led to success...|pg||
nt|viren169: not clear where playing the A or small is best at trick 1|pg||
nt|othered1: I agreed that pass was best on hand, but not sure I would have found it myself.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jferg: maybe emigrate to scotland:  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: can;t blame E for heart lead. need to lead best suit on such auctions & from his hand it seems hearts is most likely weak spot when they eschew 3NT. of course, in a sequence like ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this, who knows?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|paulg: i guess there is a slight chance of a diamond ruff in the air|pg||
nt|paulg: but 4-1 clubs more likely than 6-1 diamonds|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he is  not taking any risk|pg||
nt|henryb: now claim on a high crossruff|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petepunt: Dafydd (son of Gary) Jones|pg||
nt|henryb: and here I was hoping son of Tom|pg||
nt|henryb: :)|pg||
nt|werge: We must be close to a claim|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sharkirl: percentage to play Q as they are playing 3rd and 5th leads|pg||
nt|jallerton: I've just found it their system file: 2NT was a good raise!|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk4: Oh dear|pg||

nt|cindy: ok marshall  i agree if you start with low club to dummy  then should hook on way back|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too|pg||
nt|cindy: theyve been opening 1N on this hand|pg||
nt|viren169: still had to rely on clubs at the end...|pg||
nt|viren169: best to duck at trick one I think|pg||
nt|finch: Playing less serious bridge, Cooke would usually open the South hand|pg||
nt|viren169: What about 3@H?|pg||
nt|mowen: still if 5@D is the worst contract they reach they will do well|pg||
nt|werge: No part-score here|pg||
nt|werge: I West opens..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another reason is that a major fit can disappear when opps interfear|pg||
nt|werge: If West.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: and they apparently do not play texas after 2H|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes|pg||
nt|mowen: really?|pg||
nt|finch: Interesting to see how conservative he is playing in the Camrose!|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Good competitive hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: yet another 4@S here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: the question is what is the percxentage way to start the suit|pg||
nt|paulg: i would definitely double with the north hand|pg||
nt|cindy: dont know   havent had enough mountain dew to figure that out yet|pg||
nt|jferg: you can log onto bgb for system sheets|pg||
nt|cindy: no i cant   im on desktop that is like an old dinosaur|pg||
nt|Walddk4: the pc has been invented, Cindy|pg||
nt|viren169: nice competitive hand here|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT = 14+- to 17|pg||
nt|finch: if West hadn't opened, NS might have ben in danger of getting too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c = natural or 11-14 balanced|pg||
nt|jallerton: Not a good advertisement for this method|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: yuck!|pg||
nt|ianrei: at least he  has a 3rd C |pg||
nt|ciaran: Might keep E quiet?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like 1N will make N/S and 2M E/W|pg||
nt|ciaran: 5H for E/W and looks like 4S will go one down|pg||
nt|ciaran: Gooke/Garvey's system is here: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/systems/cooke-garvey.pdf|pg||
nt|othered1: And a 5@C save that's OK, even with the trump stack|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW might reach 5@C|pg||
nt|othered1: Bidding a grand here, on @H break, isn't a bad decision.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: the trump break dooms 7@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 12 tricks with @h 4-1|pg||
nt|werge: Double dummy 7 @C is nice!|pg||
mb|2N!|an|GF, 3+H|nt|cindy: i would definitely not double with that hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as opposed to new dinosaurs?|pg||
nt|cindy: i know   im better at using psychic powers|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@D for N/S|pg||
nt|finch: I doubt they'll look for a slam now|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT loses 4@s 1@H 2@c|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 2 down with perfect def - diamond ruffs and underleading H|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: you only have one bid opposite a passed hand, so get both majors into play (is my philosophy)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, i would probably overcall, but it is a better double trhan the other hand because you have club tolerance|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a 2C part score - take a short break|pg||
nt|viren169: off on a heart ruff|pg||
nt|mowen: hope south bids now|pg||
nt|jallerton: on the normal @slead|pg||
nt|ciaran: normal if W on lead, yes|pg||
nt|viren169: 3NT E/W way here...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But E told about a rather balanced hand, so pass is not so far away|pg||
mb|3C!|an|min|nt|cindy: they are bidding and cant stop|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They bid as if they had something|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually you can use texas and 4@S to distinguish shapes or strengths|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why should they go minus when we can?|pg||
nt|ciaran: England gained 6 by staing in partscore on board 3 where Ireland tried 5@D|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H could get a bit messy|pg||
nt|mayors: oops|pg||
nt|mowen: oh|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@s = no major|pg||
nt|jallerton: Actually, 1@c could also have been any game force, so 1@s doesn't guarantee any values!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But I think the percentage bid is 7|pg||
nt|werge: Oh-no - sleeping|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: my partner's don't expect the unbid minor from me, just majors|pg||
nt|cindy: yeh but what happens is you double and partner bids clubs and then you are stuck|pg||
nt|jallerton: This needs some care|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a dull and infrangible 3n|pg||
nt|ianrei: play on D or C?|pg||
nt|jallerton: best to duck the first trick|pg||
nt|jallerton: then play @c|pg||
mb|3D!|an|forcing|nt|ianrei: if you set up 4D tricks you still only have 7 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: whats even worse is when your partner bids clubs and they double|pg||
nt|jallerton: as can then finesse @d into the safe hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry maybe not infrangible|pg||
nt|henryb: not me. I pass a 15-17 1NT with East|pg||
nt|othered1: I would have acted with south's hand over 1@D (2@D)|pg||
nt|othered1: with bad @H break, only chance for 7 NT is to find the opponent with long @H also to have 5!+D and a red suit squeeze.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 35 high and only 12|pg||
nt|werge: Only advantage in 7 NT is, that 4 @H together wit 5 @D is enough|pg||
mb|3S!|an|singelton D|nt|sharkirl: and they don't want to be in 5 |pg||
nt|sharkirl: opening 4@S would have worked better on this hand|pg||
nt|mowen: in the books it says make a simple overcall as it won't be passed out - wrong|pg||
nt|mowen: i think Jon should respond to a 2 level overcall|pg||
nt|mayors: I'm going to have to leave you now.  Enjoy the rest of the show.|pg||
nt|mowen: bye|pg||
nt|finch: Thanks very much Graham|pg||
nt|jallerton: interesting|pg||
nt|ciaran: all systems are available here:|pg||
nt|ciaran: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes indeed Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but 5D was possible|pg||
nt|viren169: Now 4@S dbled minus 1|pg||
mb|4C|an|cue|nt|paulg: seem to be a little short of tricks here|pg||
nt|eamongall: 5@Hs has taken a turn for the better|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: well, i am not that worried about them doubling 2C, or of being set much if they do|pg||
nt|paulg: although every action looks reasonable|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and if it is a partscore hand there is not a lot at stake either|pg||
nt|paulg: that is, reasonable in the context of everyone overbidding in the modern game|pg||
nt|cindy: it certainly could be if you are doubled vul going down when you can make hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a widespread philosophy aparently|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we have moved to neputian bidding now, way out|pg||
nt|cindy: have these people had dinner yet ?|pg||
nt|viren169: seems the par result...|pg||
nt|petepunt: neither can sing :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Can anyone decode this?|pg||
nt|werge: So 7 NT should be around 70 %|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|marlowepi: would make if played by S on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|mayors: I would try 2NT with the south cards|pg||
nt|ciaran: East displays the magic dummy|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Goo d new for dec at trick one|pg||
nt|chick: as do I ... balanced 8 usually isn't enough|pg||
nt|viren169: Cards well placed for declarer... especially on a @H lead!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Good lead from Erichsen. |pg||
nt|mowen: hard to see a swing on this|pg||
mb|4N|an|RKC 1430|nt|othered1: Thanks, Staffan|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkp: table amused by dummy's singleton|pg||
nt|henryb: and a balanced 8 opposite 15 often goes down in 2N|pg||
nt|chick: he does have a play for this, endplaying N|pg||
nt|petepunt: agree with pass,  especially as opps may come back in vuln|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: ponder..ponder|pg||
nt|petepunt: small @D |pg||
nt|petepunt: what else can he play|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|jcomyn: wont 2H make here for EW|pg||
nt|ciaran: Even 3H looks possible with a good guess in H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems England in game only on the slam hand|pg||
nt|mayors: @C K is big card|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: half-time announcement made|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree..|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @H was natural...|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@c in probably a minimum and after that cuebids|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|viren169: Declarer will come to 9 tricks one way or another...|pg||
nt|mariner1: another quick hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: Well L is gaining by early aggression which while soundness might be an issue is|pg||
nt|mariner1: paying off|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: if he plays club now then should make as east is hoist between two stools either set up hearts butc west never gets in or plays spade and sets up ninth trick for declarer|pg||
mb|6C|nt|jcomyn: cant see Carvey allowing 2C to go free|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting 2@S bid by South|pg||
nt|lestergold: now can safely finesse dim to east|pg||
nt|mayors: bye all|pg||
nt|mowen: Jon will be surprised when 11 tricks are claimed|pg||
nt|petepunt: the end play looms now|pg||
nt|henryb: Ace and a @d|pg||
nt|petepunt: but may simply play S for q@H|pg||
nt|petepunt: gr8 hand |pg||
nt|henryb: he has 2@d, 3@c and 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: Their convention card says taht 2NT would have been hearts and clubs, so I'm a bit surprised he didn't do that|pg||
nt|eamongall: or was it always making |pg||
nt|othered1: is east always making 4@S, with, say, @H lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm some potential danger here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@d acking for @hQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: asking|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|nt|cindy: this match was close and then  ....|pg||
nt|ciaran: Since N/S play 4th best leads and N denied a major, declarer knows a lot about the layout|pg||
nt|ianrei: should make 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|mariner1: of course when you are a 100 points off you have to take some chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: amazing that so far in thios set of deals the score is 1-to-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Need a flat board to calm the nerves!|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch|pg||
nt|werge: Good bidding - bad break|pg||
nt|othered1: Intellingently and unluckily bid.  But 7N is better|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - 2 %|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed|pg||
nt|werge: OK - 2½|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ciaran: The @DQ at trick one was revealing too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only with a 5-2 split in @d as additional|pg||
nt|werge: Strange lead against a grand slam - why not ! S8|pg||
nt|werge: @s 8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: true enough, but 1H could lose spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 40 imps could have changed hands|pg||
nt|cindy: marshall quit reading my mind|pg||
nt|mariner1: the Open is catching up with us|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: mm 23-6 good start for holders|pg||
nt|viren169: any ideas what that showed?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ciaran: I think declarer needs to take teh ruffing finesse in spades to make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg: Murdoch goes for the only chance by rising with the @cQ, but it will probably cost another undertrick|pg||
nt|sharkirl: quality of @H suit probably stopped a 4@H response|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: not to worry, shortcircuit after 12 seconds|pg||
nt|petepunt: brd 5 was very int in O-room|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: I assure you all, there is a lot of thought going into this|pg||
nt|henryb: Wales' hope in the other match of interest is fading as EBU is ahead 20-4|pg||
nt|viren169: Some of the specs have said last two hands! Maybe they will change their minds!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|ciaran: surprising that W covered|pg||
nt|jcomyn: home now|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3rd is the realistic target for Wales THIS year|pg||
nt|chick: N's turn to think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: exactly|pg||
nt|henryb: should have been thinking while Townsend thought.|pg||
nt|henryb: and be ready to play now|pg||
nt|henryb: a @d was surely not inexpected|pg||
nt|henryb: *un...*|pg||
nt|petepunt: if west reads well he always makes ?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|paulg: sound defence from the NI pair|pg||
nt|roswolf: bad news|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcomyn: well done again|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes - another good result for N/S|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|werge: If Wests hand is an opening bid, we get no swing here|pg||
mc|12|nt|werge: Good news - undoubled|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Does anyone pass west's hand any more?|pg||

nt|cindy: did i say that before ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, on february 2|pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|sharkirl: usually shows support for both minors with strong raise|pg||
nt|viren169: strong?|pg||
nt|sharkirl: always|pg||
nt|mowen: looks a better start than 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: it looks like it was always making, but that def accelerated the play|pg||
nt|mariner1: well maybe not, they are 2 behind which is normal|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can play 4@H here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: My money on that this is a flat board (or a beer?)|pg||
nt|werge: We can´t bet - I agree|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Flat beer probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: i dont think n/s can possibly overbid on this one|pg||
nt|jcomyn: slam here but.....|pg||
nt|viren169: Another partscore hand here...|pg||
nt|viren169: via 1@S-1N-2@D-2@S|pg||
nt|viren169: Good competitive hand now!|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ciaran: Not one you'd like to bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: probably wont bid it|pg||
nt|ppiglett: looks like you could extablish the diamonds|pg||
nt|othered1: or 3N.  And should have the auction to themselves (maybe 1 ugly @S by west)|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: probably not with all the wasted diamond values|pg||
nt|mayors: crockfords|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think you forget the 99 IMP handicap|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: a fair slam slam here|pg||
nt|james_h: I'll leave that slam to Jacko the Irish team captain|pg||
nt|jcomyn: strange bid|pg||
nt|finch: but the system file has very little about competitive auctions after the opposing side has opened, so I'm not so sure of their methods|pg||
nt|eamongall: i have never double O'G since 1992, he always has an extra ace up his sleeve ..says Thomas Hanlon |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: that'd be hard, he's short-sleeved today|pg||
nt|petepunt: doubt  S was thibnking there,  soemtine slow connection|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: yes he was.....|pg||
nt|henryb: we had a case once where a player in South's position thought, and we took his tricks away because "you cannot suggest that you have something to think about in order to deceive ...|pg||
nt|henryb: declarer"|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think that 6nt or 6@H is likely in the other room - i saw them play last week and they failed to bid a very east 7nt|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: wd|pg||
nt|ciaran: 2NT is 11/12 balanced|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you stayman or trasfer?|pg||
nt|werge: South had the hand for playing 3 @D|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if NS have a method to bail out in @D at 3-level or lower.  I'd personally prefer that to 1N|pg||
pc|s8|nt|paulg: that will make on the diamond finesse|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: *transfer|pg||
nt|mariner1: stayman and bid 2@H if no major in W|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|paulg: 4@s will be keycard, and 5@d shows 2 of the 5 aces without the @hQ|pg||
nt|cindy: why do those passes keep getting alerted ?  :)   cause S really wants to bid ?|pg||
nt|paulg: Liz, our operator, is trying to alert the previous call|pg||
nt|paulg: but the bbo software is not quite as intuitive as you'd like (as an operator)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5-4-2-2?|pg||
nt|jallerton: Do you agree with S's pass over 1@h?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: or what we call "junk stayman" |pg||
nt|mariner1: of course I play garbage stayman|pg||
nt|sybarra: or so garbage is the technical term |pg||
nt|werge: It has no sense to keep dummy´s 12 remaining cards on the table now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cindy: see i thought it was super intuitive, knowing S really wanted to bid|pg||
nt|paulg: (that is, if you are using the keyboard rather than mouse to enter bids, alerts, etc)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: be delighted shortly stayed low|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like this will play well for declarer |pg||
nt|henryb: or defender|pg||
nt|viren169: another light opener by West has kept N/S quiet...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|viren169: Good start for defense|pg||
nt|othered1: That was quick.  Guess south didn't go looking for miracle 7-counts|pg||
nt|mariner1: junk is too kind a term for what I play :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: good start|pg||
nt|ianrei: whats else - 1NT doesnt appeal|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is fixed|pg||
nt|viren169: just as well they will be saying!|pg||
nt|mowen: Erichsen's opening has killed the competition by bidding their suit|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure I'd be happy to put dummy down!|pg||
nt|othered1: such as @HK and @Sxx and @CK|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|mowen: middle from 5 small - strange|pg||
nt|mowen: game with 11 opposite 12 but tough to beat|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ianrei: 2S doesnt seem to have much more that 6 tricks|pg||
nt|mowen: all over now as there is no way to get 4 spades and A@H|pg||
nt|viren169: spade and a diamond switch may have done it...|pg||
nt|viren169: not easy... we can see all 4 hands! |pg||
nt|viren169: And even then we are sometimes wrong.|pg||
nt|mowen: the best chance for the defence was a passive lead - say a club|pg||
nt|viren169: ducking may take Declarer of the scent!|pg||
nt|viren169: Espen doesnt miss much...|pg||
nt|viren169: except when he is playing golf!|pg||
nt|mowen: has to play A@H  as partner might have 5 good hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: then he is looking forever!|pg||
nt|mowen: the @HJ would have been better as south could duck his ace|pg||
nt|viren169: yes... |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: not strong enuf especially with oly Ax spade to overcqll 1n|pg||

nt|eamongall: golf ? |pg||

pc|sA|nt|eamongall: are you 48 today |pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: @s8 must be right!|pg||
nt|othered1: In a system that can start strong hands relatively low, I wonder why south didnt' take advantage of the system to sniff around for slam?|pg||
nt|mariner1: right for what?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to play on the first lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc09/fc_main_en.htm  -|pg||
nt|mariner1: Tournament Site|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jallerton: There is a school of thought that 4th hand should overcall 1NT a lot more freely these days|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: wonder if there were a case for playing @SK at trick 1 to start @H?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ianrei: and the Hs are likely to be losers|pg||
nt|finch: the lead wasn't systemic|pg||
nt|henryb: I do not know whether South actually huddled before playing from 10x of @h, If he did, he should not have.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|jallerton: on the basis that people open and resond very light|pg||
nt|ianrei: thats becase people open and respond on such rubbish|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: H 4-1 and both finesses wrong in minors - you might feel hard done by|pg||
nt|lestergold: you cant bid what you havent got because you hopethe oppos havent got what theyc say they have !|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its not generally winning bridge in my experience|pg||
nt|ianrei: declarer should guess this|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: for two reasons. so partner can play another @s and must not guess his next play|pg||
nt|werge: No change, I think|pg||
pc|c5|nt|finch: With the @D10 short, this will make 9 tricks fairly easily|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh no finesse in D only C|pg||
nt|viren169: diamond ducked would have worked better |pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg: I can see Liz is catching up, because Brian Spears NEVER plays this fast :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ten of D lead has a good chance of success|pg||
nt|cindy: he drank my mountain dew|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to find based on the bidding...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzkp: No...South played in tempo on that trick|pg||
nt|werge: Bad @C-discard for West|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ianrei: now he can score a club ruff|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|lestergold: 7 tricks that is|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mariner1: and making 5|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|lestergold: oh hes gone for perhaps the superior play of seting up a club trick o two|pg||
pc|d5|nt|henryb: I think declarer will now get the @s right, as Townsend almost must have the !q for his opening|pg||
nt|mariner1: W could have led the Q@S when in with trump......as they held the 9@S too|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ciaran: W squeezed now in the minors if S reads it|pg||
nt|lestergold: or three!!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ciaran: E left him guarding both minors when he switched @DJ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: well good card play by denning|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|mariner1: now a trapping endplay|pg||

nt|mowen: hi Peter|pg||
nt|petepunt: hi francis,  a bit to do i see|pg||
nt|henryb: thank you Tim|pg||
nt|mariner1: wait forgot one was pitched, so could not have led Q@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: there is another chance for an agressive game swing though on last board|pg||
nt|roswolf: another potentially wild hand|pg||
nt|werge: 1 @H - 1 NT - and 3 NT is there|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jallerton: 2@d = 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|othered1: They've played this at a pretty good pace, so far.|pg||
nt|werge: Will South dare leading a @S?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jferg: east had prime cards for him|pg||
nt|viren169: Possible game swing here|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy h game here|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have a fit issue|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkp: sorry all - lost internet connection :( :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: had to reboot|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW likely in a tricky 3N here|pg||
nt|roswolf: heavy overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: i'm told that I am doing Liz an injustice ... so perhaps Brian will be first to drug tested later|pg||
nt|viren169: Michaels here?|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@C?!?! not my choice... unless it show @C+@H|pg||
nt|mowen: so the 2@C opener turns up|pg||
nt|finch: 2@C 8-13 with both majors|pg||
nt|finch: if it's maximum, it can be 4-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|finch: 2@D inv+ relay|pg||
nt|ciaran: West looks more like a 1N overcall assuming that is natural|pg||
nt|mariner1: likely spot is 4@S with little chance|pg||
nt|werge: 2 @D is a joke in my bridge-world|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petepunt: still 24 brds to play but exciting times fr eng 1 and eng 2 i suspect|pg||
mb|3D|nt|viren169: perhaps it does!|pg||
nt|sharkirl: prefer 3@S now from N|pg||
nt|viren169: some form of ghestem|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@c 4-4 majors|pg||
nt|ianrei: 11 easy trcks in H|pg||
nt|finch: 3@H shows 5=4=3=1 max|pg||
nt|finch: he could have bid 3@S 5-5 max, but this way he shows the diamonds as well|pg||
nt|petepunt: can they avoide 6@S now|pg||
nt|finch: well, Blackwood will avoid 6@S if nothing else will|pg||
mb|p|nt|mowen: blackwood|pg||
nt|finch: 4@D is RKCB in spades|pg||
nt|petepunt: b;wood in what suit|pg||
nt|finch: 4@C would have been rkcb in hearts|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@h 3-suiter with short diamonds, 11-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: pass terry|pg||
nt|ciaran: Very tough to beat 3NT here|pg||
nt|viren169: A bit passive by N/S|pg||
nt|finch: garvey deciding whether to show the void or not (and if so, how to)|pg||
nt|petepunt: 5@S is in danger|pg||
nt|finch: West will do well to find the ace of diamonds lead, but we don't know yet who will be declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkirl: very much so|pg||
nt|viren169: now it is all about overtricks!|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess west is stuck for a bid in their system, 'cause a natural 2N wouldn't have occurred to me with those @S|pg||
nt|othered1: morth won't find @S lead, so positioning hand in west may be good.|pg||
nt|sybarra: as predicted |pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulg: well done for keeping up!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well done, wrong sided contract|pg||
nt|jferg: the contract might not have been as attractive if east did not have the dia q|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but would E bid 4H with:   Jxxxx  x   Qxx  KQxx ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he cant though can he?|pg||
nt|ianrei: 3NT shaky on S lead but ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n would be a very poor spot altho it make here because of fortunate layout|pg||
nt|mariner1: lead helps a little here,,,,,,,, @D lead is trouble for EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not one has the hammer|pg||
nt|werge: My grand... make 600|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ianrei: even with 30 points the 4-4 fit is better|pg||
nt|werge: - on a @H-lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|finch: 4NT two key cards without the queen of spades|pg||
nt|finch: pass = I do have clubs stopped quite well|pg||
nt|finch: good effort to stop in 4NT|pg||
nt|mowen: super sequence|pg||
nt|viren169: Welcome back!|pg||
nt|othered1: That should help west, but not playing !J may cost timing|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|petepunt: they need quick def tricks so a@D poss|pg||
nt|jallerton: Interesting trump lead from Qxx|pg||
nt|mariner1: the trick is are there 9 before giving up 5|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, on several rational lines of play as cards lie|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like playing on @d is better than on @s A on side|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he is lucky that long @S does not also have A@D|pg||
nt|othered1: understandable that west is taking time on this.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: My reason is that the @d suit is covering more distributions|pg||
nt|othered1: could even come down to the position of the @D10 on some lines/lies|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks off|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ciaran: Even with the club wrong, N/S have 5C, 2S and 2H|pg||
nt|eamongall: 4333 8 count opposite strong NT ....hardly bids game |pg||
nt|eamongall: but maybe the opening bid in North tips the chances of making game in 3NT|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jferg: up with the heart ace and drive out the spade|pg||
nt|eamongall: however getting out the TONK tool for 2@Hs looks a good idea|pg||
nt|ciaran: cartainly can be made if you are in it and if you're going to play a 3 level contract..|pg||
pc|dA|nt|viren169: looks like +2|pg||
nt|petepunt: but, well stopped in last making contract:)|pg||
nt|othered1: he'll go after @S|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|mowen: hi again|pg||
nt|viren169: We had a technical problem!|pg||
nt|mowen: so 3NT made on the last board|pg||
nt|viren169: I thought somebody threw the towel in... but not so!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Sorry all. Slight hitch here.|pg||
nt|viren169: Thks Tim...|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|VugraphPL1: running scores http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/2009/krajowe/gpp/01elblag/emax.html|pg||
nt|cindy: in Boston they were taking samples to DNA test the players|pg||
nt|mowen: and on a good board for England|pg||
nt|mariner1: that @S pitch helped W|pg||
nt|othered1: very good chance that west now knows @S count, plus. |pg||
nt|mariner1: now a @H to hand and a @D to dummy......... not that easy to see|pg||
nt|othered1: No @S bid by south, no 6@S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg: lots of problems with identity theft then?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But dangerous to play another @s. If he returns to the hand and plays another @s, he must duck|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to play @S right (guess) to hold|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@S needed now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|viren169: unlucky not to be all 13 tricks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: short pause for 'comfort break'|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: got it right|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cindy: some kind of study to look at how bidding matches up to dna....im serious|pg||
nt|eamongall: however 1@S overcall does not indicate the power in the West hand |pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: West is still OK if he plays @H over then @S, reads the spot and ducks|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h2?? he wants a @s shift from S|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has to find the spade switch when he is in|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: you mean, correlated with number of X chromosomes? :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: so nicely done|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzkp: he claimed just @dA10 @hA and no more|pg||

nt|paulg: this looks a more interesting hand|pg||
nt|cindy: im not commenting on which female players seemed to have male dna|pg||
nt|jallerton: Wales have their first IMPs.  They bid and made the thin 6@c on board 5|pg||
nt|ciaran: Isn't the standard defense to this type of three suited opener "double and lead trump"|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: auction on 8: 1@s - 2@d - 2N - P - 4@c - P - 4@h - P - 4@s - end|pg||
nt|eamongall: 140 in the bag but I predict  imps out for Ireland|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: he didn't want the extra 30|pg||
nt|viren169: We need it!|pg||
nt|viren169: we need more good boards!|pg||
nt|othered1: That was ust a typical vul 3N.  Maybe odds-off, but you bid it.|pg||
nt|mariner1: slam EW here|pg||
nt|mariner1: Shirley with the more ethereal comments :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: we lost board 7!|pg||
nt|roswolf: on the grand 6@H was bid as predicted for 17 imps|pg||
nt|werge: This looks friendly - 620 E/W|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: nothing to 4s here|pg||
nt|viren169: I think 3@S by North seems normal at that vul... playing 5-card majs |pg||
nt|viren169: another light opener!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Nice to play board 7. First a miss and than find @h 4-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|mowen: exciting hand - might be plenty of bidding|pg||
nt|finch: so far only five imps changed hands this set (4-1 to england) but a swing is coming on 23|pg||
nt|finch: I think you have to bid 4@S on the West hand here and hope|pg||
nt|ciaran: Very good slam here for N/S - no wasted values|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|paulg: 2@s is a strong jump shift ... a rare treatment in top level bridge nowadays|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can east pass?|pg||
nt|cindy: i hope not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3d by east operator|pg||
nt|sharkirl: they're not playing 5-card|pg||
nt|jallerton: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|lestergold: crads lie very badly for e/w here|pg||
nt|finch: on second thoughts, maybe that's a bit aggressive|pg||
nt|ciaran: Thanks Tim!|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@d= 5+@h, 9+ HCP|pg||
nt|eamongall: Garvey and Cooke should stroll into this as they are very practiced bidders|pg||
nt|petepunt: @C was 4+ here|pg||
nt|roswolf: house is getting close to its original handicap advantage (99)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cindy: i like strong jump shifts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7@d|pg||
nt|mariner1: mirrored minors means only 6 makes|pg||
mb|p!|nt|fabsayc: but 2@S was last makeable spot|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont believe in using my bids to improve part scores|pg||
nt|sharkirl: but wud seem obvious on that bidding that p has 5 @Ss|pg||
nt|petepunt: 6@D is a good spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: more useful to use them to get to games and slams|pg||
nt|viren169: another opportunity for slam here for Ireland|pg||
nt|lestergold: even 3d looks like it cannot make but N/S are not far off making 4h|pg||
nt|ianrei: only two losers but lack of entries make life difficlt|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem is the entries needed to the nortyh hand for taking all those winning finesses|pg||
nt|jallerton: but can build a @c trick for a @s pitch just losing 1 trick in each side suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: Maybe forcing dummy stops this plan|pg||
nt|mowen: 3 small clubs is bad|pg||
nt|ianrei: 5C with 3 likely tricks looks risky|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c gives EW a decision though|pg||
nt|petepunt: even 6@c|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ciaran: Can't be beaten, but declarer may sweat before making!|pg||
nt|finch: yes, if partner has club length it's a disaster, if partner has club shortage and extras he will protect|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good decision by Howard.  Even with all his defense, 4H is cold|pg||
nt|ianrei: but 5C goes for 1100 on best defence|pg||
nt|ciaran: Having said that, this could be very expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: yes, that did happen. Immediate 4@h reply!|pg||
nt|ciaran: the commentators curse, eh, Eamon!|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4@D may agree @H here though|pg||
nt|mowen: very light opening even by the standards of this match|pg||
nt|bobh1: the @c play seems irresponsible|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has some play here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: and West has not doubled|pg||
nt|mariner1: .|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: oh right, 7@D does make, only 6@S|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think cold|pg||
nt|mariner1: Lirarna is taking a lot of chances and they are paying off..... still a long way to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: but can ruff and play @c instead|pg||
nt|petepunt: most roads lead to 2 off|pg||
nt|mowen: Garvey need sto ruff A@C and play K@D|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: i dont believe in weak 2@D bids, especially this weak|pg||
nt|viren169: Norman will be going backwards now at every opportunity!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cindy: it looks like a book 2D bid if thats what you play|pg||
nt|viren169: well done... short and simple seq...|pg||
nt|james_h: pragmatic 6@c|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N forcing raise and 3@D enquiring,,,,|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In sweden many players show a side suit as a positive response, so this is a possibility to reach 7@d|pg||
nt|mariner1: well no slam leaves door open for San Sac in Open|pg||
nt|ralfwil: unbelieveable!|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H lead helps defense|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|paulg: 4@h has appeal to protect partner's minor suit holdings|pg||
nt|jferg: oops at least one too high|pg||
nt|jallerton: retaining a dummy entry for a major suit lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c looking very clever now|pg||
nt|ianrei: Howard judged well |pg||
nt|mariner1: hard to think W would not have bid slam|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: i toh spade switch thast given the contract|pg||
nt|ianrei: thats a friendly switch|pg||
nt|mowen: and Cooke must not ruff it|pg||
nt|finch: the king of diamonds discard may be enough for Cooke not to ruff|pg||
nt|mowen: now north must not rise with A@H|pg||
nt|finch: but against that it's very very very hard not to take the setting trick against a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|finch: sorry I was a trick out, if north ruffs the second club he can't discard the @DK|pg||
nt|mowen: the 2 over game force has allowed the club fit to be found|pg||
nt|viren169: Aceless 9 count? Not good in my book!|pg||
nt|mowen: but will be pass?|pg||
nt|viren169: 1 for the road? this is high enough!|pg||
nt|mowen: easy to see 6@C could be right|pg||
nt|viren169: but not on this hand...|pg||
nt|mowen: add the AorQ of @Cs to east|pg||
nt|viren169: At least Norman didnt bid 3@C over 2D!|pg||
nt|mowen: I think he will bid on|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: time for a bookburning then|pg||
nt|viren169: With a void in pd suit and facing possibly only 4 card @C suit...pass is right!|pg||
nt|mowen: I am wrong again - some decision|pg||
nt|viren169: Well done Espen!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: mullered the defence in one fell swoop|pg||
nt|ianrei: should now make - i think a second D at trick 2 made this impossible|pg||
nt|ianrei: so who should have doubled 5C ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: first failing contract of the day?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: Fahrenheit 451|pg||
nt|james_h: he has run into a bad breal in clubs tho|pg||
nt|lestergold: now ruff dim finesse heart cash ace and play spade and take club finesse losing only a dim and a spade that cost maybe two tricksw that switch|pg||
nt|jallerton: what else could be have done? @d at trick 2 is ruffed, @cQ led|pg||
nt|viren169: Espen has seen some of Norman's bid before!|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ciaran: Had S ducked that, this would have been interesting|pg||
nt|mowen: why would east bid 3@C on 4cards?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure west's hand is a slam force, but it looks like no try was made.  And that doesn't feel right.  But do they open garbage hands with bad suits?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cindy: you should write to them|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bettertake that HA soon|pg||
nt|james_h: break|pg||
pc|h7|nt|viren169: no chance of an overtrick.... |pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, South making sure of this|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|petepunt: K@D maybe a bit extravagent ?|pg||
nt|mowen: it was when pard does not have a @D|pg||
nt|mowen: contract is now cold|pg||
nt|finch: yes, if West works out what was going on.  He might after drawing trumps and a heart up.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: should have forced duumy to ruff then declarer can take heart finesse and has nine tricks but could still be playing next week for the tenth|pg||
nt|eamongall: I was going to say ...what happened ... but I know i will get 100 answers ..."Nothing" |pg||
nt|ralfwil: There had been a nice defence with @sQ second after AK|pg||
nt|othered1: That grand was a 30 imp swing.  Even had it worked out for Lirarna they would still have a tough row to hoe to get back into the match.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|paulg: but partner could conceivably only have 5 hearts if he didn't want to introduce a weak 4-card minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: scoreboard about to hit high gear|pg||
nt|marlowepi: by my calculations that equals Celsius 200. i wonder if that is the title in Europe|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks like cahnces now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jallerton: i think @s switch gives the 11th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Howard told Garvey "I've got king-jack"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3 aces and a side suit with KQ! |pg||

pc|s2|nt|mowen: what else is there to do|pg||
nt|viren169: good start for defense... taking out the entry early!|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|viren169: just bidding his shape out over 2N|pg||
nt|mowen: for what reason - to tell the oppo what to lead?|pg||
nt|viren169: N does best to pitch a heart...|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|finch: sometimes it's hard to envisage any layout where you are making|pg||
nt|finch: if South is 2227 with Hx in diamonds, he makes now by heart ruff, ace and a diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed ed|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ianrei: jeffreys right - the CQ holding the lead works|pg||
nt|mowen: 2nd disaster for n/s|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: sorry 218|pg||
nt|lestergold: true if q of club led makes|pg||
nt|finch: although that's wildly unlikely given the diamond discard|pg||
nt|ciaran: England in 4HX on the board where Ireland made 5HX|pg||

nt|jcomyn: no I am outnumbered|pg||
nt|viren169: not on that line...|pg||
nt|mowen: the play looked right|pg||
nt|mariner1: now told that HOUSE started with a 99 point handicap|pg||
nt|sybarra: bob you probably didnt plan on 2 up tricks there|pg||
nt|bobh1: Q@D was a remarkable play|pg||

nt|ralfwil: nice play in 4@h for NS. Crossruff|pg||
mb|1S|nt|viren169: 1H by West will keep North quiet...|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: wales looking like a top flight team now |pg||
nt|viren169: best not to open with those hands! And you dont have that problem!|pg||
nt|mowen: so 7@D with a good view in clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: multi |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|viren169: 6@D will be good to reach!|pg||

nt|eamongall: make sure he does not spill it ....lucosade stains ...|pg||
nt|viren169: Tough as 1C may be short... E/W play 5-card majs|pg||

mb|4H|nt|ianrei: N can back in now to reach their D partscore|pg||

nt|ianrei: no - N has sold out to 2S|pg||
nt|lestergold: at least they will beat 2s|pg||
nt|petepunt: daf gary won solver medal a few years ago in commonwealth fairlt exp.  Townsend Gold jet-lagged suspect|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he has a loser in each suit best defense,,,,,, unless they help|pg||
nt|mariner1: N might have risked 3@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 10 asking for middle suit!?|pg||
nt|viren169: N/S have done enough...|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: i would have doubled 2@d here|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer now should get the diamonds right to make her contract on the @C lead|pg||
nt|ianrei: as long as the cash their C tricks after taking the ruff|pg||
nt|eamongall: Theres been a good deal on Lucozade in Ireland recently ...4 litres for 4 euros..two large bottles|pg||

nt|petepunt: brd 6 will  hurt eng tho'|pg||
nt|chick: they just returned from Australia, right?|pg||
nt|mowen: 5@S has ensured that England bid a slam|pg||
nt|viren169: wow... a bit pushy!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I vote fro a trumph lead from W|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: needs to get out of the way with that KC|pg||
nt|ianrei: if N puts S in with the CK after taking his ruff it will make|pg||
nt|jallerton: If you partner opens light, you need to excercise caution in response|pg||
nt|ianrei: the D lie well, others do not|pg||
nt|ianrei: N will do well to get this in|pg||
nt|othered1: Playing a limited opening bid system, north reasonably decided not to sniff about for @H slam.|pg||
nt|othered1: In standard methods, north would have had to take stronger action.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|james_h: nice work|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good auction - 3H splinter agreeing clubs|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - but he has seen many openings like this from South|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jferg: no dislike of lead|pg||
nt|james_h: next|pg||
nt|lestergold: im concerned about the second club loser disappearing on the fourth heart|pg||
nt|mowen: maybe expecting a save|pg||
nt|viren169: Is this time for a restricted choice lesson?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: EE says 'captain's orders@@ !!|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|paulg: as it is, no-one seems to have bid their majors ... perhaps this is tipping point of the minor-suit comeback|pg||
nt|ciaran: Diamonds sit pretty well for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: but then I don't know what constitutes a "small" bottle|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ciaran: Good restraint from Selway|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe 1-off?|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u there is a third dim to deal with|pg||
nt|jallerton: has chances in all the suits|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: how would you like the suit?|pg||
nt|jallerton: The problem was the 1NT bid.  S not expecting a stiff heart in partner's hand|pg||
nt|ciaran: looks like 4H is a likely make, but would be very pushy to bid it|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes yea cup were doing well i think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thats true, but not giving a chance.....|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ciaran: I think I'd have overcalled 2@S with such a good suit and shape|pg||
nt|jcomyn: over 1S u mean |pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes|pg||
nt|james_h: I dont doubt you for 1 sec Ciaran|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but that might be systemic|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well since a 1S response only shows 4, a 2S overcall should be natural|pg||
nt|jcomyn: it would with me but you never know|pg||
nt|james_h: For the Kibs ... Like most good players Ciaran sees the silver lining never the cloud|pg||
nt|mowen: I think denning needs to lead the @C9 to beat this|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|paulg: @sK now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jferg: low to enc|pg||
nt|jferg: is there system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when Qxxxx in dummy i switch to suit preference|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jallerton: 4@s 2@h 2@d|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jferg: true so club 10 would suggest hearts|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ianrei: W should have ducked the D|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree that west must try to make a slam try and not just inquire about generic strength or side x.  But to force to slam is wildly gambling unless your openings are very sound|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jallerton: still off.  E has to come to a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|jallerton: apart from @d of course|pg||
nt|ianrei: he has 4D, 2S and 2 Aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: but no comms|pg||
nt|ianrei: if he puts in the H10, E has to get off lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: I think there were considerably more hands where slam makes than not,,,,, I'm a|pg||
nt|mariner1: bidder|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petepunt: had some chances if @S right|pg||
nt|viren169: lots of money going on Norman going down!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|viren169: Defense still needs to be careful...|pg||
nt|finch: this is going a couple off I think with the spade finesse wrong and both heart honours wrong|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: if readable as middle yes|pg||
nt|finch: yes, the @SK onside was a necessary start to make it|pg||
nt|petepunt: might well be 3 off after @S ducked|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h2|nt|ianrei: needs to play SQ|pg||
nt|viren169: I with Norman to make it!|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|paulg: @s2 asking for diamond back|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cindy: how could it be readable ?|pg||
nt|jallerton: and exit in @d|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mowen: so England going for it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: so off 1 very good here|pg||
nt|othered1: Look at only your hand and partner's opening then take a stab was once popular.  Then the Culbertsons beat up Buller & Co and that style faded away|pg||
nt|mariner1: next session here in 58 minutes,,,,,,,,,,,|pg||

nt|mowen: perhaps someone should have saved|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: small break|pg||
nt|viren169: Not easy!|pg||
nt|mowen: no doubt England would then bid and make 7NT|pg||
nt|viren169: board 21... 6@D was reached at the other table!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|viren169: Now North has a lot of exit cards for 1-off|pg||
nt|finch: it's 3 off anyway if they get it right|pg||
nt|finch: East might have invited rather than raising to 3 on a flat 9-count with no 10s and a couple of jacks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: not obvious to lead a top club honor. heart a very likely alternative. we can;t have very many clubs to run and they are only in 1NT. maybe better to use them as entries, and hope ...|pg||

nt|fabsayc: ew need to play 3NT|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H by N/S|pg||
nt|finch: another hand where EW may get a bit high.  11 opposite 11 may be 'opening bid opposite opening bid' but that doesn't mean game|pg||

nt|ciaran: Interesting opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: I'm sure the CC said 14-16!|pg||

nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H strikes me as a recipe for disaster|pg||
nt|cindy: what is W piping up about ?|pg||
nt|ciaran: it certainly is a sound debut - this has not been a set for bidding pessimistically|pg||
nt|james_h: I like your style, but it means you are always on the limit|pg||
nt|sharkirl: yes, just 3 losers|pg||
nt|viren169: West seems to have been brushed aside looking at the best hand at the table...|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think there is enuf work to do in 5d altho on this lay out 6 may roll in|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, 5@d is more realistic|pg||

pc|h2|nt|cindy: huh|pg||

nt|jallerton: 2@d - how strong is that?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well now that any bit of candyfloss counts as a stop for nt purposes that may be true|pg||

pc|h7|nt|cindy: and what about N and that 3D ?|pg||

pc|s2|nt|jferg: say oppo open 12-14 nt and p x what do you do if oppo bid 2c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have trouble thirsting to play those methods. |pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|cindy: would have to do a lot of drinking first|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nothing that some acapulco gold couldn;t fix|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club king now for the sure set|pg||
nt|jferg: we lay arescue system called helvic where xx showsa five card suit and 2c shows c & dias etc|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Howard's utterly pointless double of hearts and u dont even get the proper lead|pg||
nt|mowen: 2@S is a decent spot|pg||

nt|paulg: N/S play 2NT as 20-22 ... that is a large range so no reason to upgrade poor 19 counts|pg||
nt|cindy: and checking the st bernard for brandy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: my rescue system is called pelvic. a few well-executed twitches and we find our best runout fit with ease|pg||
nt|jferg: yes when 1nt was x and coffey bid 2c he was showing clubs and dias, if sime paases he shows willingness to x a bid showa weakness|pg||
nt|cindy: lolol|pg||
nt|cindy: thats pretty good marshall|pg||
nt|cindy: put that on yer cc|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 21-9 to holders at the moment|pg||
nt|ciaran: should be some imps for e/w there|pg||
nt|sharkirl: don't think walshe would have looked for @D ruff with singleton trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: this looks good for EBU at +35 IMP. What does that convert to, commentators?|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW have a nice 3N here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: He heard us!|pg||
nt|werge: Oh - it´s even accepted, the claim. Nice opponents|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a trickier hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Of course I had my window open!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkz: I dont take anything for granted with these players.. :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: are you at the venue ralf?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: ok john, thanks. sorry for some of my earlier comments which were predicated on assumption we were talking about the 2H call|pg||
mb|1C!|an|11-13NT/17+|nt|viren169: 6@S on a non @D lead here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: 2@d =18-20 BAL (they treat 4441 as BAL)|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc09/fc_main_en.htm  -|pg||
nt|mariner1: Tournament Site|pg||
mb|1D!|an|0-7|nt|cindy: thats what i thought too !|pg||
nt|jferg: np  banter is good|pg||
nt|viren169: This hand could go anywhere!|pg||
nt|ianrei: so they going to reach 3NT instead of the good but unlucky 5D|pg||
nt|mowen: another big hand - @D lead to beat 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg: 3NT looks clear now, but not an easy contract to play on the spade lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: no, just 2@d|pg||
nt|ianrei: 4H E/W is not too bad either|pg||
nt|jallerton: John Howard was happy with 2@d|pg||
mb|1S|nt|viren169: dble= support or general take-out?|pg||
nt|viren169: East will lead one of his aces if 6@D is reached!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jferg: basis system here for decades was 4 card suits and 12-14 nt|pg||
nt|eamongall: about 21-9 but I will check|pg||
mb|2D|nt|cindy: hmm|pg||
nt|jferg: lots of 800, 1100 in 1nt x|pg||
nt|cindy: that will work i guess but dontcha like 3H better ?|pg||
nt|cindy: remember the old conv cards always use to have something called swiss on them ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this bid use to show solid diamonds before the crash|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the classical meaning of 4D was this sort of hand but with solid diamonds (or at least headed by AK). stretching the criteria here|pg||
nt|cindy: and a better hand|pg||
nt|viren169: probably general take-out|pg||
nt|mowen: west will be on lead to @Ss|pg||
nt|viren169: on their way!|pg||
nt|viren169: tough for East to find it either|pg||
nt|mowen: the 4@C splinter might cost the slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 4@D now!|pg||
nt|mowen: perhaps a make splinter in @Ds would be better|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no 350 km from that, but I have a strong voice....|pg||
nt|werge: Let´s see, whether E/W have a system allowing them to play a @D-contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: not that Qx of clubs|pg||
nt|eamongall: 35-40 is 21-9|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 10 e/w got to 5@S and went -1 for 12 imps back|pg||
nt|othered1: south may not sell out|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: slam try 3n|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this auction does smell fishy|pg||
nt|werge: That´s well-known - when partner asks, why you did´nt act, you answer: As you saw, I thought about it|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cindy: uhoh|pg||
nt|jallerton: Welcome back!|pg||
nt|chick: serious 3N?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|paulg: probably best to lead clubs and then play on hearts|pg||
nt|paulg: but hard to see enough tricks|pg||
nt|cindy: giving some back maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: difficult to execute a devil's coup in a side suit|pg||
nt|jferg: looks like remargen the bridge too far!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: don't have enough spots anyway for devil's coup|pg||
nt|viren169: East may find a diamond now as neither N/S will cue 2nd round control in @D|pg||
nt|viren169: West!|pg||
nt|mowen: if South is going on he should cue @Ds to try to stop the lead|pg||
nt|viren169: Ummmmmmm... is Zia South?|pg||
nt|mowen: no Paul Denning is a solid citizen|pg||
nt|mowen: but temptation lurks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Denning is still thinking.....|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as always, I will take action after 1@c and not balance|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|james_h: good lead|pg||
nt|ciaran: Good lead - there is a case for as heart on this auction as well.|pg||
nt|viren169: could be let through here!|pg||
nt|viren169: need a @H switch...|pg||
nt|viren169: seems unusal not to lead a @H when it bit and supported?!?!|pg||
nt|james_h: @h comming|pg||
nt|finch: EW are the 8 of diamonds off being able to make 3NT with spades 3-3, but the diamond pips are such that 1S is an excellent spot|pg||
nt|mowen: n/s like to signal with the K@D|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes think thats the name :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: there is a squeeze position against N though so more possible|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petepunt: 2n the limit for e/w  ?|pg||
nt|viren169: Not easy as South know they are missing A of @H|pg||
nt|mowen: he should ask Espen what he intends to lead!|pg||
nt|mariner1: N just needs to pitch carefully|pg||
pc|dK|nt|viren169: He must have seen Espen had the @D ready!|pg||
nt|mowen: perhaps he did|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree! bluff and counter bluff! |pg||
nt|mowen: so a good stop|pg||
nt|viren169: I would loved to have seen the 5@D bid!|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|viren169: I could be a Euro up or down depeneding on next trick!|pg||
nt|mowen: plenty of possible slam hands in this set|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzkp: grr, verrrry wobbly connection here, sorry again all|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|james_h: terry must unblock|pg||
nt|jallerton: catching up, not playing a speedball!|pg||
nt|viren169: that would make it extremely difficult for West!|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|viren169: One Euro up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|paulg: the upside for declarer is that he knows that this will be the same everywhere|pg||
nt|ciaran: Now, N needs to unblock|pg||
nt|james_h: Ur up|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: if W's black suit doubleton had been in spades, this lead would have blown the defense. when we tally our luck, we often take things like that for granted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now if lavery returns club jack maybe|pg||
nt|jferg: wonder why east bid 5d went west cue bid dias|pg||
nt|mowen: mostly with limited high cards|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|finch: funny it looks natural to play a heart at trick 2, but trumps would have worked better|pg||
nt|petepunt: heard 3n let thru'  in one match on @H lead|pg||
nt|finch: if the acution starts 1NT (weak) double and NS find their heart fit, you can see that might happen|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|jcomyn: noooooooo|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lord luv us|pg||
nt|ciaran: obviously did - well done|pg||

nt|fabsayc: and no side winners to discard heart losers|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes of course|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry MUST have unblocked otherwise it makes|pg||
nt|viren169: good fight back by England!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: there wasn't much more to 12. He played off his remaining trumps but the hearts remained very blocked.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: comfort break|pg||
nt|eamongall: that 13 imps translates to 3 VP in this case ...18-12 now |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: if it stays that way then England take a 6VP lead into final match|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: We had some specs earlier on wondering what country EBU were...|pg||
nt|mariner1: now the penultimate board of this session|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|marlowepi: puppet presumably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think is a tossup whether east should bid|pg||
nt|viren169: probably 4@S by North now!|pg||
nt|james_h: 3/4 @d?|pg||
nt|mowen: another possible slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: think this is the ante-penultimate|pg||
mb|1H|nt|paulg: that is a strong 12-14, not that it will matter here|pg||
nt|finch: Typical love all, strong club opening from East.|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6@s just needs 3-3 @s's|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mowen: 4@S cold for S&D|pg||
nt|viren169: Some thought it was in the EU!|pg||
nt|werge: Against 3 @H, it seems, that East has over-ruffed, where he shold´nt do it!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jallerton: 5@c thin but playable|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does howeard's double mean?|pg||
nt|finch: 1NT response forcing|pg||
nt|mowen: and west might bid it|pg||
nt|jallerton: "up to speed" = normal slow tempo!|pg||
nt|eamongall: he is not going to get any help in clubs so 3@Ss it is|pg||
nt|eamongall: and will be one off in about 17 seconds |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: lol, commentator's curse|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW might get overextended here|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was just the bid W wanted to hear|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has a play especially if he can ruff @S quickly|pg||
mb|3C|nt|marlowepi: very hard opening lead problem|pg||
nt|marlowepi: u mean W?|pg||
nt|jallerton: take-out?|pg||
nt|ianrei: X is probably values without 3S|pg||
nt|lestergold: but only one suit left |pg||
nt|jallerton: so it shows a @d suit plus @s tolerance|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate nice splinter by west could get them to the thin but frigid club game|pg||
nt|petepunt: may struggle to 6@C now|pg||
nt|viren169: with it's own currency... know as EBU vouchers!|pg||
nt|viren169: some of you might have traded in that currency before!|pg||
nt|viren169: almost as strong as the Euro|pg||
mb|3H|nt|paulg: small heart, hoping you can switch back to clubs?|pg||
nt|paulg: or @cQ followed by "doh!"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: everything but a diamond is a possibility, including heart Q|pg||
nt|paulg: it is a weak notrump, so less reason for @hQ than against a strong notrump|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W pushing N/S around here!|pg||
nt|chick: excellent contract if they find it|pg||
nt|mowen: poor effort by Brunner/Holland to play 4@S with 7 on a finesse|pg||
nt|roswolf: who will win the auction / they might well regret it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes, especially since we see 18 and 19 counts opening 2nt these days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the death hand for south|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you get to pass the lead with four kings|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Playing Puppet, which allows you to announce a 5-card major, increases the odds a bit in favor of bidding with the W hand as there is more upside. but even then it is only close|pg||
nt|james_h: nothing makes|pg||
nt|sharkirl: good save when no x|pg||
nt|eamongall: if they get the bidding finished|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: the opening bid worked very well for EW|pg||
nt|mowen: 10 opposite 11|pg||
nt|finch: what was I saying about 11 opposite 11 = game earlier? |pg||
nt|viren169: Is 4@C splinter?|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe too many transportation issues in 4@H though|pg||
nt|werge: Have we seen any double in this set? For money...?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianrei: they need to duck a S at trick 1 to beat this|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: I think O'Gorman expected 3+ clubs opposite|pg||
nt|petepunt: 6@D will save a few imps|pg||
nt|mowen: don't know but should encourage south|pg||
nt|viren169: North will go on with those aces!|pg||
nt|roswolf: not likely i would say|pg||
pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: another way to win by bidding is that E might have a 5-card minor, e.g. AQJxx of Diamonds, and then you could easily be on a finesse for game, or even better than that|pg||
nt|ianrei: to beat 5C anyway|pg||
nt|chick: scary though, will all those losers staring at you|pg||
nt|viren169: singleton x not good... |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: perhaps more--better chance heart king is in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: well hard for east to egt to excited with his hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4@c is surprising with no @d wastage|pg||
nt|jallerton: @d lead is a good start for the defence.  What's the best line?|pg||
nt|eamongall: well its not my fault those guys did not agree their defence to Unusual NT overcalls|pg||
nt|viren169: void good...|pg||
nt|mowen: 4@S seems cowardly - why not 4@H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ianrei: I'm suprised East didn't bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but he is worried about his horrible holdings in the majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: it's not your fault Cooke & Garvey couldn't bid 6@h earlier!|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|petepunt: seems normal with dbl fit here |pg||
nt|viren169: S wont play N for A of @C|pg||
nt|viren169: Now 6 for sure... and a small chance for 7...|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks 1 or 2 off|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In modern bidding there are mo penalty doubles on a lower level|pg||
nt|werge: What is going on - I continue @D|pg||
nt|roswolf: gremlins playing on west,s mind|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If N ruffs the 4th @d with @h10 E must overruff for -1|pg||
nt|werge: West seems confused, because declarer played the @D Jack from dummy...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg: true|pg||
nt|eamongall: anyway 5 tricks off this so dow ntwo|pg||
nt|eamongall: two|pg||
nt|eamongall: Garvey and cooke could have bid 6@Hs ..they just never started|pg||
nt|bobh1: desperate men do desperate things|pg||
nt|mariner1: no way they were not playing @S, just dreaming in @H here|pg||
pc|d6|pc|cT|nt|lestergold: especially with the spade overcall|pg||
nt|finch: interesting choice of swtich|pg||
nt|finch: ...and play from north....|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|finch: but all not very interesting with the contract cold|pg||
nt|viren169: not a particularly good 7... on the odds|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cindy: im 100% for that holding to be in dummy when i lead the Q|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops now we could see down a lot|pg||
nt|mowen: not optimum|pg||
nt|ciaran: Club to Q now|pg||
nt|viren169: but if N has a voild @C like he has advertised... he must have K of @D!|pg||
nt|mowen: specs are saying 4@C was key card ask which explains 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: Ah...........|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3-3 @s's or JT tight|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ciaran: This will make for 5 imps to England|pg||
nt|ianrei: Nice play by North|pg||
nt|othered1: West reasonably took his time and worked things out correctly.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially if pd has the knave|pg||
nt|marlowepi: brb have to feed the parking meater|pg||
nt|werge: Sorry - East shall discard, if so - and at least 1 down|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jallerton: If N ducks, E can stop the ruff by crossing and taking a @h finesse - not necessary in 4@c|pg||
nt|ianrei: too many D forces allow 5S tricks, 2C and a H|pg||
nt|jallerton: declarer could hope to elope all 3 small trumps in hand but would need defensive help|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: 15 minutes left, 2 and a half boards to play|pg||
nt|ciaran: Yes - short entries for that|pg||
nt|jallerton: so if @h at trick 2, defence should play @h back|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petepunt: still thinking of !4S hand i suspect |pg||
nt|mowen: Denning will make this quickly|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|werge: The hesitation is enough - he had 8 m inutes to think about this|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|finch: I think the @H2 at trick 1 must have been count, Cooke could see no future in a club switch if declarer had four diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: A swing here... the wrong way!|pg||
nt|othered1: This isn't a critical position for east, who will beat this by doing nothing aberrant|pg||
nt|roswolf: like the @SK now!?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ianrei: unlucky to be only worth an overtrick|pg||
nt|petepunt: may still be too many with @D break|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|roswolf: -1 without any options i think|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jallerton: as it is dec is play for 3-3 @s - perfectly reasonable|pg||
nt|petepunt: but k@S is right now|pg||
nt|petepunt: W must hold k@S on bidding after his pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E still has hopes on this one until next trick|pg||
pc|h4|nt|viren169: I'm not really taking sides!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|othered1: Tha was the only immediately losing play back, I think|pg||
nt|werge: 2 down with normal play - and a discard instead of overruff, probably loosing 1 @S, 2 @H and the 3 @D-tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mowen: England lost it in the open room|pg||
nt|petepunt: maybe not the wrong way :)|pg||
nt|viren169: Yes I agree...|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: hand on to spades north|pg||
nt|jallerton: or @C10x offside|pg||
nt|chick: I don't see any way to escape 1 more loser|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Daffyd still thinking|pg||
nt|chick: thinking is good ... when people on bbo whine about 'faster pls', I always remind them that bridge is all about thinking :)|pg||

nt|lestergold: well mayeb just as well the thin maybe anorexic game wasnt bid!|pg||
nt|bobh1: when they bid 4n and not 5n they are almost always missing an A|pg||
nt|mariner1: now the real penultimate board.............|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be flat but you never know|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If he discards @hK @h to @h9 @hA clean @c and throw in on @hQ for a favour in @s|pg||
nt|othered1: This slam should be an easy push, but sometimes . . . |pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: West was playing a 14-16 point 1NT at the other table, so East made a game try, his partner not accepting.|pg||
nt|jallerton: A great result for Wales in other room|pg||
mb|d|nt|ciaran: Another big board - 7@H is a good contract|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this c ould tell a tall tale|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w have excellent save in hearts against n/s spade game|pg||
nt|lestergold: doube fit territory always measn both sides can make lots of tricks|pg||
nt|ianrei: Not a happy choice of X of 4S by East in the other room|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c = 11-13 balanced or any 17+|pg||
nt|werge: But why could´nt West - without East´s hesitation - have Q-J doubleton in trump?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|petepunt: daffydd is prounced DAVith for our transatlantic friends. :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: thanks to our deliberately anonymous operator, good work|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hard to bid in most natural systems though|pg||
nt|lestergold: disaastrous|pg||
mb|3N!|an|max, singleton !H|nt|brolucius: A trump lead solved the problem in that suit and declarer soon had 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|jallerton: If 2@s shows specifically the red suits, that makes it easier to bid on as East|pg||
nt|viren169: Staraight forward 4@H now... not what England want to see!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: i have to bid something with N hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to the sponsors, commentators and spectators who laughed at our jokes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this double is presumably conventional|pg||
nt|jferg: no pen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3H followed by 4D|pg||
nt|ciaran: Board was flat in 7@H in the Wales - Scotland match I believe|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to reach a thin 4@H|pg||
nt|finch: another fairly gentle game here, should be a flat board|pg||
nt|othered1: the double, not made in the open room, could complicate things for NS|pg||
nt|roswolf: will the t/o dbl keep n/s out of slam?|pg||
nt|werge: It makes North´s hand even better|pg||
mb|4N|nt|cindy: why would W pass then ?|pg||
nt|jferg: and lavery will xx to show a five card suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: operator says double is penalty|pg||
nt|ianrei: I think E should get this right anyway|pg||
nt|eamongall: hmmm silence is golden ...I have mopped the floor ..rescued the boiling over ham and made a cup of tea since my last comment |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: a bid that would not occur to me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double should show a minor or 4M, 5m hand|pg||
nt|jferg: prefers poker|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5C now|pg||
nt|james_h: and they are on the road|pg||
nt|lestergold: now eastmust kbnow that his hand is not suitable for defending|pg||
nt|finch: this will turn into a very close match|pg||
nt|eamongall: its probably because we have loads of Irish commentators driven to silence|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: lol, you didn't miss much!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup - iwonder what 3nt means?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|marlowepi: or russian roulette with FIVE chambers loaded|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2N shows good raise to 3@h :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: well at least @H are 3 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: i can deal with 2S|pg||
nt|paulg: this looks easier to play than 2@h|pg||
nt|cindy: i see 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes good judgement by DFenning|pg||
nt|lestergold: now is the kilkl point of the auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 ! was what?|pg||
nt|mariner1: cross ruffs coming|pg||
nt|bobh1: E probably has no way to show @d's or he might have chosen that suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Maybe it´s a help. N will think @hK is on side?|pg||
mb|6S|nt|cindy: 3C would have gotten hammered, no doubt|pg||
nt|james_h: terry might show the Hq here|pg||
nt|eamongall: However I first hit this earth in Mill Hill London so my team is leading |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: isn't all that the wife's job anyway?|pg||
nt|mowen: not very interesting|pg||
nt|viren169: flat board... next... time running out for England.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: sorry - EBU - NI match was the one where 7@H was reached at both tables - well done|pg||
nt|mowen: flat board|pg||
nt|ciaran: The diamond blockage should mean this fails|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: 9 min on the clock|pg||
nt|jallerton: @h 3-3 are a good start for declarer though|pg||
nt|jallerton: should N duck the first trick if dummy plays J?|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like this new country EBU has done very well on its 1st attempt!|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: not a good start for defense...|pg||
nt|ianrei: 5H was going -2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at least east /west havent found a foolish double |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: nice bidding - i like the 3nt bid  showing a singleton @H:)|pg||
nt|othered1: NS brushed the double aside trivially.  Well bid.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petepunt: with IRE being thumped it could be vwery interesting 2morrow, Scot back in picture now too|pg||
nt|ianrei: he cat setup 9 tricks - can't enjoy them though|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@C was @H and another suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: NOTHING TO THE PLAY|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: prefer 5C there from S|pg||
nt|ianrei: S disappointed at dummy|pg||
nt|ianrei: was it really worth 3S ?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcomyn: oh well flat board|pg||
nt|ciaran: Gives a better chance of reaching 7 on this layout alright|pg||
nt|james_h: Peter Goodman suggests 5nt to show the 2 aces and a void|pg||
nt|viren169: problem either min is best on this bidding seq...|pg||
nt|mowen: not a good result for the selectors|pg||
nt|sybarra: well....|pg||
nt|mariner1: W did not think it was @c|pg||
nt|sybarra: can certainly see why |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|cindy: next set in about 45 minutes|pg||
nt|viren169: ...probably...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jallerton: Defenders have to be careful|pg||
nt|eamongall: I don't have one of those yet |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Cooke deep in thought|pg||
nt|viren169: Welcome to Peter Goodman...|pg||
nt|mowen: when the reserves beat the first team|pg||
nt|viren169: shhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|viren169: You cant say that!|pg||
nt|petepunt: evn all close 4 second now ?|pg||
nt|viren169: It shows what depth we have in the squad!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg: we appear to be at the fastest table tonight|pg||
nt|ciaran: Lead had changed hands in this match with every board completed in the past few minutes.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: claim!|pg||
nt|roswolf: claim pls|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ciaran: Looks like EBU will extend their lead here|pg||
nt|eamongall: I have seen Cooke deep in thought before ...but I could not claim as I was not 100% certain I had the line |pg||
nt|viren169: Specs are asking where they can buy some of these EBU vouchers!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ciaran: In other matches, England were 46-0 up against Scotland last time I checked|pg||
nt|chick: if he can manage to hold this to -1, will be a push, but that will take some defense lapses|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Gold now asking meaning of 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: Daffyd saying he 'thought it was a good raise in hearts|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
mc|12|nt|cindy: well, striking gold|pg||
nt|viren169: now a flat board...|pg||

nt|jcomyn: another big chance|pg||
nt|james_h: Its a great debut for Terry and Derek|pg||
nt|ciaran: This looks about a 50/50 slam.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes DK and SA out|pg||
nt|viren169: last one now...|pg||
nt|finch: This is the last board.  Thank you to the vugraph operator, and my excellent co-commentators Steve Ray, Graham Osborne & Peter Goodman.|pg||
nt|finch: Thanks also to the English Bridge Union and Bridge Great Britain for organising the broadcast.|pg||

nt|finch: Finally thanks to BBO and a special thank you to Roland Wald for all his hard work. We return to the Camrose at 10 am GMT tomorrow morning.|pg||
nt|finch: The Welsh got off to a good lead of a diamond from the North hand at the other table|pg||
nt|mowen: a chance for Wales here as 41H looks makeable|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: 4 min now on the clock|pg||
nt|mowen: interesting set|pg||
nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators Shirley Ybarra and|pg||

nt|othered1: 2@H rebid in open room looks strange|pg||
mb|2D!|an|weak, 6+!D|nt|james_h: they should reach game anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just worth 3D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now West must find a raise.|pg||
nt|viren169: easy 4@H to finish of with...|pg||
nt|eamongall: a string of small gains for EBU split by a couple of large gains for Ireland|pg||
nt|eamongall: tonk retonk |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: tonktonk|pg||
nt|eamongall: its really snowing in Waterford |pg||
nt|mcarroll: At last - a low level penalty double|pg||
mb|d|an|T/O|nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at|pg||
nt|mariner1: it!|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to you also Rob |pg||
nt|bobh1: EW reach the sterling contract of 3@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this will be interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: 3@D is a natural slam try if I'm reading their card right|pg||
nt|james_h: 2n tx to @d|pg||
nt|ciaran: this is a transfer to @D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and thgen?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5 of a minor fr  N/S looks makeable|pg||
nt|finch: looks very hard to beat when played by the long hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: This is the last board of the set. Thank-you to Tim, our wonderful vu-graph operator in Oxford. Great concentration!|pg||
nt|mariner1: also, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates, Sharon|pg||
nt|mariner1: Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no broadcasts.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge lovers|pg||
nt|mariner1: worldwide!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: we use the double pelvix thrust rescue system|pg||
nt|jferg: aha that one|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule|pg||
nt|mariner1: (set up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|bobh1: violating one of Burn's laws|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: you have to pay me royalties to use that system|pg||
nt|jferg: we use the double helvic system here|pg||
nt|jferg: this way we have 4 wriggles|pg||
nt|ianrei: tough decision for S|pg||
nt|jallerton: Thanks also to my excellent co-commentators, Ciaran and Ian|pg||
nt|ciaran: EBU have a good position here - 2H looks good for N/S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: you're welcome - hope to have better conn this afternoon|pg||
nt|othered1: north was the doubler in the other room, so perhaps south converted a takout (or cards showing) double|pg||
nt|roswolf: should play here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: PASS of course!|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: Cooke and Garvey muddling the auction on not many values|pg||
nt|mowen: 2@H looks like a good raise to me|pg||
nt|petepunt: west hand improved now|pg||
nt|mowen: but what to bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: I can see the bidding but still wondering how they got there|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: 3d is min|pg||
nt|ciaran: 3@C would say Terry likes the suit|pg||
nt|ciaran: Sensible auction|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: Strong club made it easier in the other room, but I expect they will still get there.|pg||
nt|james_h: yes|pg||
nt|ianrei: did well|pg||
nt|lestergold: deefending 4s even more profitable should be 2 off for 500|pg||
nt|jallerton: too balanced to bid I think, but 4@sx could eaily be cold|pg||
nt|finch: this makes as long as declarer knocks out the right ace first|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3n need right ace knocked out first|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
nt|sybarra: may think he can squeak home with 7 tricks but |pg||
pc|dA|nt|paulg: 5@d may get out for 300, definitely 500, so a good save|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i'm not sure about that 3D overcall. might work well, but i would be nervous that it might push N into a phantom save|pg||
nt|cindy: so ending with a push    thx everyone    see you back in 40 minutes|pg||
nt|viren169: East will push here|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 2@S will take the game-try string out of 3@H by East. |pg||
nt|brolucius: ..sting..|pg||
nt|jallerton: 5@c is touch-and-go on a spade lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: selway plays too fast|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cindy: turns out 5D would be good save|pg||
nt|james_h: yes, those Queens in south are not attractive|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkirl: maybe not so easy now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Quite rightly, Holland prefers to show his very strong hand with a double instead.|pg||
nt|finch: Garvey might lead a club after that auction with West sounding so confident|pg||
nt|ciaran: Thanks Tim|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|viren169: Yes... I like dble here|pg||
nt|james_h: well done|pg||
nt|sharkirl: well bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H now the master bid from West. She has found it!|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm not likely with that flat load of grabage in Denning's hand|pg||
nt|ianrei: S took out to 5C at the other table|pg||
nt|mowen: likely to play @Hs first|pg||
nt|petepunt: will duck 1st rounnd of @S|pg||
nt|petepunt: but wants to lead @H  to J pref so is tougher than looks|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like this should be 1 off for a few IMPs to Ireland|pg||
nt|james_h: you get the feeling that NS have their tails up going for all the part scores with gusto|pg||
nt|othered1: This should be a few more imps to Lirarna, since north doesn't have much play for this|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|lestergold: needs to play club now wasnt obvious|pg||
nt|jallerton: no E didn't raise to 4@s in the other room|pg||
pc|dT|nt|paulg: 3@d is pretty pure, perhaps too much so, so if partner sacrifices I don't think he could complain|pg||
nt|petepunt: however if N has Kc and AH sing he is off so @H to k is right|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jferg: good night all nice working with you|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S is a good spot for N/S|pg||
nt|lestergold: so one trick down the swanee|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: Everyone did well in the auction.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|james_h: Pat can be an annoying opponent|pg||
nt|viren169: and East only has red cards in his box! |pg||
nt|jallerton: Next session starts at 12.25GMT, 18 minutes from now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|viren169: ...only...|pg||
nt|bobh1: now a @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: plan B,  lead a @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe the Pareto Principle holds :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Pareto's Principle  -   States that for many phenomena 80% of consequences|pg||
nt|mariner1: stem from 20% of the causes.|pg||
nt|mariner1: W had to bid @D holding @c........ and so on.........|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ianrei: both red aces allow -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh a n input error|pg||
pc|c5|nt|viren169: all fun and games here in the last few hands!|pg||
nt|viren169: thks to all those specs with helpful suggestions (and the Euro provider of course!)|pg||
nt|james_h: Pat loves 5431|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petepunt: still work 2do  but should make now|pg||
nt|finch: interesting, if NS both duck smoothly, declarer could choose to switch to playing on diamonds|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: no he did cash ace of hearts |pg||
nt|petepunt: was a strange pass with a good 12 by TT. ?|pg||
nt|bobh1: bravo|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: unfortunate|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: roof caving in|pg||
nt|marlowepi: same all around|pg||
nt|othered1: west may be endplayable, if north reads the position|pg||
pc|s3|nt|james_h: and claim time|pg||
nt|mowen: bye all|pg||
nt|viren169: Thks again... |pg||
nt|vugraphzkp: tk u vm nd bibibi|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|james_h: an imp stolen in the other room|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or not|pg||
nt|mariner1: this maybe an exercise of Fyffe's Axiom though|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ciaran: If he sneaks a spade past the A will take 13 since there will be a show-up squeeze, but i think Erichsen would pop now|pg||
nt|viren169: Holland cashing out...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|viren169: he knows pd doesnt have too much...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: well, i don;t think that's clear. N might save on some hands with only 3 diamonds, and then we might have 2 tricks in diamonds alone, which is two more than the norm for a weak JO ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at these colors|pg||
nt|finch: decalrer must feel in a lot of trouble, but he can't really go off with South having everything|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cindy: no no   not saying they should save|pg||
pc|s6|nt|paulg: thanks all|pg||
nt|cindy: byeee|pg||
nt|finch: oops.... all Cooke has to do is win and play another club|pg||
nt|finch: looks like West didn't count his tricks properly, he's trying to get out for one off|pg||
nt|petepunt: blocking @H complicated things|pg||
nt|mowen: key moment|pg||
nt|mowen: it could be right to win and play K@D|pg||
nt|jallerton: they really are catching up now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: trump back would have sunk the ship|pg||
