mb|d|nt|mariner1: hi Arifin and George|pg||
nt|mariner1:  http://www.bridge.ee/MV/AB-tln.htm - Tournament site|pg||
mb|3S|nt|josj: a grand slam for breakfast|pg||
nt|snorris: yes!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: thought about 4@S by W|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|garnetts: 5@D is clearly the best contract--but even that may be too high|pg||
nt|mariner1: interesting pass for S|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Everyone|pg||
nt|snorris: -3  too much|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true|pg||
nt|snorris: first double not negative?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: it was; alert was too late:)|pg||
nt|snorris: and no neg double from north?|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: Sometimes this sort of pre-emptive tactics help declarer  in the play|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi George|pg||
nt|daman: this should end the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: we start off with an everyday grand|pg||
nt|col3435: do you think it points out the diamond situation here?|pg||
nt|garnetts: The heart position will force west to unguard the Kxx of spades because the Q@H acts as a squeeze xard|pg||
nt|mariner1: I guess NS do not use forcing NT,,, maybe polish @c or similar?|pg||
nt|daman: unless East takes a view|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: wondering if they get there -- it's certainly possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: 4@S should be cue with @C as trumps|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho there are only 2 visible losers in 5c, 11 winners may well prove dfficult if they reach it|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Avram|pg||
nt|snorris: this is too cheep|pg||
nt|snorris: only 300|pg||
pc|h2|nt|garnetts: I think dec will not get the @D position right--the 3@H will ensure that---I am afraid I would have bid 4@H which would have been a better indication|pg||
nt|col3435: yes|pg||
nt|garnetts: Still we have stopped short for some reason|pg||
nt|garnetts: North can't have much faith in his partner's bidding or card play lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: dummy lost its @s 4 and now looking for it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: imo an example how easy it is bto disrupt a big 1@C by opps|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jaapfr: to|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|josj: 5@D = 4 KC with @C trumps|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|josj: with @H 5-1 the @D finesse is needed in 7 but it would have been an excellent contract|pg||

nt|vugraphzmf: they had one card missing in board 2, its fixed now|pg||
nt|snorris: knew when to put up his kings|pg||
nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
nt|snorris: and when not..|pg||
mb|1S|nt|josj: another near-slam but this time it will fail|pg||
nt|josj: so it should end up in a boring 3nt|pg||
nt|april7: after opening and stayman E will play 4@Hlosing 2 @C and 1 @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW|pg||
nt|snorris: 3 @h the limit|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this also looks slammy, but they'd better stay out of it, it seems |pg||
mb|2S|nt|jaapfr: or 2@S:)|pg||
nt|snorris: 3@h is my bid|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|col3435: I don't know whether these 1@c bids are "strong" clubs or something else - anyone have any information?|pg||
nt|snorris: not double|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: seems the player listens to you:)|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H now or does not listen?|pg||
nt|snorris: not enough for 4 @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: he is on the other side of the screen... so might not:)|pg||
nt|snorris: max too tricks for declerer|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: too much duplication in @Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the wasted qj of clubs is compensatwed for by the nfavourable position of the spade ace|pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: opening lead most probably a @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is likley to be flat 4h a completely normal papa mama contract|pg||
nt|april7: or trump|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead can beat this|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mariner1: N having only 2@H and K@S 3rd means this should be beat too|pg||
nt|mariner1: if @H broke better the could jettison a @D on 3rd @H|pg||
nt|mariner1: or even if he only had kx @S|pg||
nt|snorris: now this is critical.. must switch too clubs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hope they get it down by timely @C play|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|garnetts: this is a good slam--only a heart lead makes it dodgy--but even then 50%|pg||
nt|snorris: still not won..|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|xenya: and no long suits or fits this time -- they should diagnose it i think and stop short|pg||
nt|xenya: but no...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|josj: even @DJ10xx with S is not enough|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|josj: this would make on a favourable @D position + @C 3-3 or so...|pg||
nt|lestergold: why such a hurry to play spade?|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 1 in Open W is playing 2@H DBL|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DQ |pg||
pc|dK|nt|col3435: looks like 2@s was forcing, in which case surely 4@s isn't the right way to go about things|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|jaapfr: unhappy defense|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: seems slam depends on Axx in the W hand and @Cs 3-3 -- no such luck|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well I want to be in six on these tickets|pg||
pc|s9|nt|josj: asking too much even for a Roland slam (which requires about 12.89 % as you may know)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: not that it will make any difference on this hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: now can beat it 2 A@C and one|pg||
nt|snorris: ah.. a mistake.. in this situation at least|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|garnetts: I think 4@S was an effort to suggest minimum with no outside values of any merit|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|col3435: hmm, is that what East has? Doesn't look like it to me :)|pg||
pc|hQ|mc|10|nt|lestergold: 3 rounds ofm trumps aj of dims and then spade was a more normal sequence of play|pg||

nt|april7: either W will repeat the @S or bid 2@C and play there|pg||
nt|mariner1: W is very RED here|pg||
nt|mariner1: back to the very Red W here|pg||
nt|snorris: 1 nt in south?|pg||
nt|snorris: or is it 14-16|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|xenya: on 1, Monte Carlo also stopped in 6 in OR, but they gained 2 imps by bidding 6N|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D makes EW|pg||
nt|ahalim: 5@D safest contract|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt no fair chane|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|garnetts: This is a reasonable 4@S contract--but very hard to get to|pg||
nt|mariner1: I overcall 1@S here, not DBL|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes better|pg||
nt|daman: I do not like the 1@H opener|pg||

nt|snorris: no|pg||
mb|2N!|an|minimum|nt|garnetts: 2@D looks like a good bid here to me--unusual but what else|pg||
nt|col3435: yes you probably need South not to rebid 2NT for a start|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: you prefer 1@D ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: maybe their style is canope|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: canape|pg||
nt|daman: I prefer 1 @D|pg||
nt|daman: as would most players|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even 2nt can be easily -1|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|garnetts: I hate 2NT with xxx in hearts|pg||
nt|april7: its a favourable position in @C and @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: connection lost, sorry|pg||
nt|snorris: like my system:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: pass from E looks a bit strange to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: no problems heremay well make 3 losing a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: W gives up too easy I think|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: 2NT is problably seminatural also|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT is silly--surely 3@S is much better|pg||
nt|col3435: but the alerting suggests that this is an artificial sequence|pg||
nt|daman: opening 1 @H is destructive to a partnership    takes partner completely out of the auction |pg||
pc|sK|nt|col3435: in which case maybe they are bound by their system|pg||
nt|april7: 10 of @C and @S from dummy|pg||
nt|april7: W is in wrong hand now|pg||
nt|lestergold: that avram would have been a better line|pg||
nt|snorris: e-w must defend well to beat it|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s8|nt|xenya: but perhaps that's their style|pg||
nt|col3435: say if this is an agreed way to show 5=3=3=2 shape|pg||

nt|mariner1: 6@D will not make|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: yes|pg||

nt|daman: so, if he opened properly the auction would proceed  1@D  (Dbl) Pass - 2@C - 2@H   etc etc   and then they would land on their feet|pg||
nt|daman: hard to believe they sold out |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: in estonia, 1@d usually just denies 5 card major and says nothing about @d|pg||
nt|daman: when you bid 2@H it has to show longer @Ds than @Hs|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have a play for 4@S|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|mariner1: 4@H also has the same play|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @h is a fair contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I agree--but there are times when instinct and judgement maust override this|pg||
nt|mariner1: W has to find @S lead vs the unlikely 4@H|pg||
nt|ahalim: after N's 1@S 4@S will be the contract|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzmf: Monte Carlo is the current leader ater 2 round robins, Pärnu 3 is on 8th place|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|april7: a very risky bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: These hands are not that easy--here 3NT is the best contract looking at EW only --but again tough to get to|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and will make|pg||
nt|snorris: yes|pg||
mb|4H|nt|xenya: 13 imps to Monte Carlo on 2, when they stopped in 5N in OR -- also a bit too high, but makeable as it is|pg||
nt|josj: ty Tanel|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: standings at http://www.bridge.ee/MV/VK09/VK09-3.htm|pg||
nt|josj: little justice to gain 13 imps for stopping too high :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: a good 2@S bid--that will help |pg||

mb|p|mb|2N!|an|minors; 7-11 or 15+|nt|josj: 1@D the garbage bin in strong @C systems...|pg||

nt|mariner1: you have to take a lot of tricks to profit DBL'ing 1@S though|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: S can double for takeout -- but he didn't -- perhaps a reasonable decision|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: classical thoery is as you describe but modern thinking seems to be in favour of getting into the bidding at tye first opportunity as you may not get another one|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|col3435: yes that's how I'd play it. And I do think South should go on over that - excellent chance of 9 top tricks in NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: Then South was very conservative|pg||

nt|col3435: maybe if N bids 1@H and East bids 2@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam time|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@H|pg||
mb|5H|nt|xenya: so far|pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose the singleton puts pay to that anyway|pg||
nt|april7: finally a slam|pg||
nt|snorris: 5 @h is obligatory|pg||
nt|jaapfr: p|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: this time, 12+12 is no game...|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, another trappy hand|pg||
nt|col3435: now 5@c is looking more likely|pg||
nt|garnetts: they need to get to 3NT |pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has a shot NS|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@H?|pg||
nt|snorris: no pd is counting on something in south|pg||
nt|snorris: and south has 1 trick+ for pd|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: a low @S leaves 3nt chanceless|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I suggest west makes a tentative double|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: you can hardly stop short of game here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: beaty bidding clear and simple and effective  |pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: well S just might bid 2N here (NF)...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|garnetts: probably a support double|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: beauty|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: slam above 50% basically dependant on finding qs|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H is not a good bid, W is too strong, only 5 losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: hearts or spades makes no odds|pg||
nt|april7: E can't really continue|pg||
nt|lestergold: esoecially after the 3s bid!|pg||
nt|lestergold: double fit|pg||
nt|april7: but E doesn't know it|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this looks off|pg||
nt|mariner1: has 8 if the guesses @c right|pg||
nt|mariner1: could try to sneak a @S by|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: another wrong prediction of mine...|pg||
nt|garnetts: Should they bid game?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|col3435: I'd be worried about this if I was West - I don't think he's shown his nice hand and nice club support|pg||
nt|april7: E takes the chance|pg||
nt|lestergold: no east is still at it surpriingly|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT has 2 chances    slim and none    unless a colossal misdefense|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|snorris: making coffee..brb|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|josj: well, they avoided game, well done by them, but 3@D will not go plus for them either|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: west now realises time to take pressure off his partner|pg||
nt|april7: does 3@D show a singleton? |pg||
nt|lestergold: poor auctionm but good landing|pg||
nt|april7: thats a goodbid now, because E could have passed the answer of 5@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: yesn avrasm west played 'catch up'|pg||
nt|lestergold: realised that if pard was making a slam try he had the val;ues |pg||

nt|april7: another easy 4 @S for EW after 1 NT opening|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w wil mak 11 or m12 tyricks in xspades depending on swhether they recieve a dim lead or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: was obviously hoping his partner would double--but maybe double support was better anyway|pg||
nt|april7: without @D lead even 6|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hope for EW they do not try 4@HX|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: might well be 57 over 7 shortly...if 4@S makes on  7 in OR|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|garnetts: Knows the opps have spades probably |pg||
nt|april7: are EW aggressive enough to go to 6???|pg||
mb|1H|nt|garnetts: They should easily get to 7NT/@S here|pg||
mb|d|mb|1S|nt|april7: no slam anymore|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D multi or showing a weak major|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: and for NS N rescuing with 5@CX-2:)|pg||
nt|snorris: no way now they do|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: with current score, the total standings become even more intriguing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: Standings before the current match are: Druva (320,5), Monte Carlo (319), Roheline Lammas (311), Ekspromt (309), Rakvere (270), Derpt (221), Otepää (203), Pärnu BK3 (171).   |pg||
nt|jaapfr: so virtually NS went above EW|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|snorris: and Lammas is gaining on Monte Carlo|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@H says bid your suit or pass|pg||
nt|jaapfr: what is 2@H?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|snorris: 2 @h ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 1N is safe|pg||
nt|josj: this looks OK and 3@C looks OK too|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ecco|pg||
nt|snorris: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: was alerted, but no questions asked on this side of screen|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: make 6 hell lead stiff heart|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D makes|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure N can raise to 5@D here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no he hasnt |pg||
nt|snorris: landed well..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lovely 3@C C|pg||
pc|s8|nt|snorris: e-w need to play clubs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|col3435: this comes up quite a lot - my feeling is that the easiest way to bid these hands is to have the player with the long suit show his suit, and then let partner take control|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would have adn lost an overtrick|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he did so well done this time|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this is bridge: if S does not open EW mite end in a horrible 4@H|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|col3435: from East's point of view, AKQxxx spades + Blackwood = easy game|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open they found 6@D|pg||
pc|d8|nt|josj: defence cannot remove both the @H and the @D entries to dummy's @C in time|pg||
nt|xenya: all  the defence can get is 4 @Ss and 2 aces|pg||
nt|col3435: but I suppose here they have so much to spare that they're always OK|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure i would have wasted much time over a 2NT opening from East|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: E showed 2 aces and 3 kings|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|daman: good stuff|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D a violation of Burn's Law|pg||
nt|daman: they found 6@D    they were lost|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm  - Burn's Laws|pg||
pc|sA|nt|snorris: opening up for cross ruffs|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|xenya: on the best defence of course|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahalim: lost and found :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and nothing wrong about opening 1@H as S or passing|pg||
nt|snorris: must play @c to make it interesting|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c6|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c5|nt|xenya: now overtricks|pg||
pc|c8|nt|april7: why not try for @H 3-3??|pg||
nt|lestergold: id have certainly led dim against 6!|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed it cost nothing|pg||
nt|daman: in the OR   South "gilded the lily" by bidding 6@D over 5   hung his partner for no reason|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|d5|nt|josj: no less than 3, I think...|pg||
nt|snorris: 9 tricks..on cross ruffs|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i thought all lines do lead to making this|pg||
nt|snorris: or this way..|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: TD at table |pg||
nt|jaapfr: suppose about 2@H bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: East "almost" played a small H|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: and then corrected|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: so the small stands|pg||
mc|10|nt|mariner1: so new leader|pg||
nt|snorris: then 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: makes no difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: and quick claim of 10|pg||

nt|mariner1: not that you really should be in it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: very easy 3n with vat added on here|pg||
nt|april7: tis time 3NT for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose 2 spades make 5|pg||
nt|ahalim: a better-than-Roland slam|pg||
nt|daman: compared to the last session   this is more volatile    only one push so far|pg||
nt|snorris: passes 12hp..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 20-20?|pg||
nt|snorris: I do that some times|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: again?!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3 out of 10 is 30% rite now|pg||
nt|snorris: all the time 20-20|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|mariner1: this is about 25% or so, well above Roland's 12.86%|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: GAUSS:)?|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobholl: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't like 3@C by N here|pg||
nt|josj: prefer X?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|april7: what about Q of @H??|pg||
nt|mariner1: he has a two way guess in @c and needs to drop the Q@D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: curve|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|xenya: but perhaps you must have 4 @Hs for the double in their methods|pg||
nt|josj: with both @SQ and @HK wrong, 3nt would have been difficult :)|pg||
nt|col3435: seems unusual for North not to raise spades here|pg||
nt|garnetts: prefer 2@D myself here|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|mariner1: well backup, the 4th @H sets up so @c guess not needed|pg||
nt|ahalim: more Rob, no trump loser and @C guess if @H are not 3-3 |pg||
nt|mariner1: Open in 5@D here|pg||
nt|daman: East might just pass|pg||
nt|daman: he is thinking|pg||
nt|mariner1: not if 2@D is inverted|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: standings before current round: 1. Monte Carlo, 2. Druva|pg||
nt|daman: why   this shows a bad hand with @Ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: for the mathematics under us|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: he should bid 3@S over 2NT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|josj: I certainly would like to have 4 H, yes, for X|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s can win some @cs but didnt find it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: well its gonnayes i see what u mean 5 not guaranteed|pg||

nt|daman: brutal|pg||
nt|mariner1: well this seems off from the top|pg||
pc|d4|nt|daman: a penetrating glimpse into the obvious|pg||
nt|ahalim: in my country we call this a silent funeral|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mariner1: or oblivious :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: but east will have problems discarding he needs to hold onto all his dims|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|garnetts: INT is constructive--but not this good with a non passed partner|pg||
nt|daman: in my country we demand 2 weeks in the electric chair|pg||

pc|dT|nt|april7: now @S 9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s7|nt|mariner1: and then a fair trial? :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahalim: that's barbaric|pg||
nt|daman: this was feeble|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: i think QJx in @Hs and the 5-4-3-1 shape make up for the lack of a 4th @H|pg||
nt|col3435: I guess it's worth pointing out that when you play against artificial systems like this 1@d bid, you need to make sure you have agreed that your 2@d is still a spade raise|pg||
nt|col3435: but I'm sure they know that, and North just felt his hand was very flat|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: N cashed spades and then small club|pg||
nt|col3435: (after all, these guys play against Precision every day of the week)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: until now i personally do like the Estonian bridge:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|josj: another advantage of X is that S might have passed it|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|jaapfr: or are NS another nationality?|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|garnetts: when you know that a slam cannot be worse than that you should bid it in my view|pg||
nt|col3435: indeed|pg||
nt|snorris: battle of majors|pg||
nt|snorris: will end here I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: But 4@H is a horrible bid --surely a slam may be on |pg||
nt|mariner1: play should be quick|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: 6@H makes but is not so good|pg||
nt|april7: its ab forcing pass? now W will pass also|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: the losing @C has to go on a @D|pg||
nt|josj: so it needs more thans the @D finesse being right|pg||
nt|col3435: they must play very limited openings - but even then, I agree, East has to do more|pg||
nt|lestergold: really Avram?|pg||
nt|lestergold: what about north?|pg||
nt|april7: where should he go???|pg||
pc|h7|nt|garnetts: Not much wrong with a 1@S response|pg||
nt|lestergold: used to be a tv series called no hiding place|pg||
nt|april7: W will lead a mall @S:):):)|pg||
nt|snorris: CAN be won but has to do very well south|pg||
nt|jaapfr: educated quess snorri:)\|pg||
pc|h5|nt|april7: EW can make 4@H so 1@S X is not so expensive, but with alittle bad defense S can even make it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|josj: s?|pg||
nt|col3435: [sorry, on that last hand, of course you *do* play a diamond to the Q, intending to cash the club winner when West has the @dA. The fact that it neatly endplays East when he has ...|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahalim: easy seeing all the cards :)|pg||

nt|daman: page 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: pass would not occur to me|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|snorris: 2 nt in north..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@H?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: non-ecco|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: interesting initial pass by E here|pg||
nt|snorris: 11 hp..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|april7: if S would discontinue @S after J of @S dropped, than defense makes only 5 @S and 1@H and 1 @D trick|pg||

nt|snorris: no one won..:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: explaining 2D: minimum|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: not many would pass with his hand i think|pg||
nt|josj: then they would have reached one of those games again :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: imps back to Derpt assuming 3N makes|pg||
nt|snorris: thx|pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: an interesting point about the lead---I would lead a heart retaining the A@S as an entry later |pg||
pc|c4|nt|mariner1: well 3N was off so more for Druva.......|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: not any longher|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: indeed, and 4@H looks utterly hopeless here|pg||
nt|josj: it might be difficult to avoid a @C loser here even after guessing the @S|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jaapfr: if we play std and me 3rd hand 1@H you bid 2nt?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: luckily 5h is safe|pg||

pc|h7|nt|col3435: I might lead a club.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|an|min, no 3S|nt|col3435: not so keen on this|pg||

nt|col3435: I know the 1@d bid hadn't shown diamonds, but ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: am i seeing things|pg||
nt|jaapfr: let @DJ walk|pg||

mb|p|nt|josj: something strange happened at trick1 of previous board...unlikely S won the trick with his @DJ...|pg||

nt|hedyg: and E could have pitched his @hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: too hard to go for the @H finesse directly when in 7NT|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d5|nt|snorris: north has the stopper himself|pg||

nt|garnetts: when you need KQX onside play for it|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 20-20|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|xenya: despite this somewhat disappointing score, we have seen some interesting hands -- i enjoyed the set|pg||
nt|josj: close to slam again but 4@H is enough here|pg||
nt|josj: an interesting set it was, yes|pg||
nt|snorris: south knows that north has something like this if he bids 3nt or 25+ hp balanced|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5 out of 16 boards Roland:)|pg||
nt|snorris: and can bid accordingly|pg||
nt|snorris: 4 @s for me|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|garnetts: This will play badly if East floats it|pg||
mb|4S|nt|josj: we will continue in 25 mins from now|pg||
nt|garnetts: that cannot be right surely |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: 1@s alert because psyches sometimes occures|pg||
nt|garnetts: The men in white coats will come for North shortly |pg||
nt|col3435: so this is a psychic psyche-reveal?|pg||
nt|garnetts: a penalty try I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: East should double to show values here |pg||
nt|col3435: double would be hearts for me, unfortunately|pg||
