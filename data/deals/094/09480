mb|1S|nt|mariner1: hi all|pg||
nt|panja: difficult to see why North played that. The only reason could be that it is not normal, so it must be good|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: and you can't get the contracts anymore either - 1@h at the other table isn't going to set our pulses racing|pg||
nt|galadriel: Transfer response then pass|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bcallaghan: Danger of getting too high in spades.|pg||
nt|keylime: 2@d Multi to start from North|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@S either multi or weak majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|idc: at other table - North opened 1@h to show 11-15 and 4+ @s, so South passed it|pg||
nt|chen_xin: µÚ2½Ú¿ªÊ¼ÁË|pg||
nt|chick: possible to make 4@S, losing a spade and 2 hearts|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bcallaghan: 4S looks like a fair contract, but not on this layout.|pg||
nt|panja: 5@D is a nice contract on board 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: oops|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Not a good idea removing partner's penalty double with a defensive trick.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 3@H showed his hand, he should not overrule partner's decision to defend|pg||
nt|idc: ok, my pulse is racing now, I admit that|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: EW can make 3N here if they get there|pg||
nt|keylime: good agreements needed here on where bids show stops or ask for stops|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Strange auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Well, this makes the other table look tame|pg||
nt|idc: I'm getting a feeling that we are approaching 'last rubber of the night' territory|pg||
nt|chen_xin: ×ønsµÄÊÇÉòÑôÊ¥ÓêÌï¶ÓµÄ¾²ÐñºÍÑÏÇà|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Why does South prefer hearts to spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this is 16 boards from Shenyang, China|pg||
nt|chick: not so sure about that, panja.  a lot of ruffing needed and diamonds are 4-1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panja: 3Nt is not as good..even with @S finesse there are only 8 tricks...but E must switch to @C at trick two|pg||
pc|h4|nt|keylime: friendly lead for declarer here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|idc: the one that lasts for 3 hours and features many four figure penalties as the empty beer bottles build up|pg||

pc|hA|nt|chick: 9 tricks now ... 3 spades, 1 heart, 1 club, 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|panja: we know @C lead would have been killing, but one can understand West not wanting to lead that after the 2@C bid|pg||
nt|chick: club lead would have given him much more problem|pg||
pc|s7|nt|idc: I suspect Cooke in the other room will take this result as a vindication of his pass of 1@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for an international event, this is quite a late start|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|idc: and no one will be able to argue with him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's pointless anyway. He will tell you what's right and wrong|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chick: guaranteed to ensure that "night people" win.   morning people have no chance|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer would have had some more work on a K@s lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Auction was perfect until the 3@H bid|pg||

nt|mariner1: well this is  round robin so a little lee way but not much|pg||
nt|werge: Another part-score|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: And Wales could well overtake England for the runner-up spot|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Part score battle here if E-W can find their spade suit.|pg||
nt|idc: I think Scotland had the luck Fri & Sat, with opps playing poorly|pg||
nt|galadriel: Shows that England has strength in depth|pg||
nt|mariner1: well we could see action here..........|pg||
nt|chen_xin: ¿´¿´µÚ2½ÚÊ¥ÓêÌï»»ÈËºóÓÐÃ»ÓÐÐ§¹û|pg||
mb|1H|nt|keylime: 1@c is precision, double is a mathe takeout for majors here|pg||
nt|chick: morning people are normally alert from about 7am to 7pm.   night people are normally alert from 3pm to 3am|pg||
nt|panja: y, what about those who are used to having a longish afternoon nap? ...is that why it is so late in Portugal? Is an afternoon break the norm there?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|idc: but against England you need to create your own luck to an extent|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I would have opened the South hand. 5 controls and 5-4 shape. What about you, panel?|pg||
nt|idc: ok, that's me 1-0 ahead on sporting cliches, someone else's turn now...|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bcallaghan: One level too high, but still gaining IMPs.|pg||
nt|idc: Yes for sure Roland, not even close.  As 11 counts go that one is prime.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 1N now shows positive response no 5 cards suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: The boys done good...how about that?|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I would have opened, but I count an extra half point for each ace, so I would have had a 12 count.|pg||
nt|mariner1: N again needs to pass|pg||
nt|chick: nap can help, but not really change it much|pg||
pc|d2|nt|keylime: 2H doubled, some action already|pg||
nt|panja: ah, did I spell it wrong?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this may have a problem on a diamond lead, as there is no quick re-entry to the South hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D lead came from the other side in OR   much easier then |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: this has some play|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North will never learn|pg||
pc|s6|nt|keylime: it does if declarer is careful - this also has the danger of 500 all over it if the ball is dropped.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nor East|pg||
nt|mariner1: well E helps out this time|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||

nt|mdgraham: only clue is the 1@D bid - |pg||
pc|s9|nt|keylime: I think he's got to tap the dummy with trumps here|pg||
nt|keylime: A@h and diamond exit appears safest|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1 @S gets ruffed and another on K@C|pg||
nt|keylime: closed room started with board nine so comparisons won't come for a bit|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North and East were both misled by their partner's bids on doubletons.  However, in neither case were South or West showing 3 card support|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: West more likely to have the ace|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|panja: y..so better to play small from South hand, isn't it?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bjacobs: Well I was told that the Open Room had English commentary, but maybe I am mistaken|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South was forced to do something.  And West had passed 1@S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|werge: I was told the same|pg||
pc|d5|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|panja: rather, with longer Diamonds, West is the one more likely to be short in @H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cross to a diamond and lead a small heart towards the queen - but North going down now |pg||
mc|9|nt|mdgraham: as West may have A, J, or 10 singleton |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|bjacobs: To defeat the contract, North probably had to give away a ruff sluff when in with @CA|pg||

nt|galadriel: I always thought that 1@C (1@D) X guaranteed equal length in maj|pg||
nt|sybarra: well...|pg||
nt|chick: sure would be interesting to know what each player thinks these bids mean :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if this is a bidding misunderstanding - apologies to NS if not|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Maybe Bowles' double showed hearts and Howard's a support double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H has a playhas to find J@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not on that lead!|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 4@H is off now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a smart lead, if you think about it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The chance of partner being short is quite good.  And you have @HA to control the trump suit and give the ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but it sure looks like it :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: sensible to play what you play over a NT opening over an overcall as well, so 2@H here=transfer to spades  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like 2@h was (North) cue-bid (South) transfer |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I would expect to see 5 @S in dummy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: I reckon South was expecting that.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: In that case the spade suit is lost|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bcallaghan: My preference is to play the double of 1D as guaranteeing both majors.  These pairs obviously don't.|pg||
nt|mariner1: now to make|pg||
nt|keylime: this is going to be a challenge.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ianrei: and west's X showed 3H|pg||
nt|galadriel: I'm with you Brian|pg||
nt|ianrei: responses to 1C are transfer|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but you lose spades when opener is 4-3 in the majors and responder not strong enough to bid again|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mariner1: well can he make it?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|galadriel: Ah, even after overcall?|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer will have to play desperate here, and the spade cover almost forces the finesse in spades.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ianrei: after 1D, X replaces the 1D response|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|galadriel: yes, I see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I understand, but I am entirely happy with a system where you may lose the boss suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *not happy|pg||
nt|idc: Playing a short 1@c system, I used to play X as both or neither majors - but whatever you do doesn't matter, as long as you both do it|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the @S lead and play allows a chance to make now|pg||

nt|idc: ok, now this is a boring partscore hand|pg||
nt|ianrei: what do you di with neither major|pg||
nt|ianrei: do|pg||
nt|idc: at least, it is if you are from the other room, sigh|pg||
nt|keylime: two big scores for N-S |pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D makes here, 6N makes|pg||
nt|keylime: and another slam coming here|pg||
nt|mariner1: that could be a big swing|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if East's safe exit card of the @S7 had somehow been removed, he could avoid an endplay in the trump suit by ducking the @DK, as he just did anyway.|pg||
nt|sybarra: a real misfit here|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: With no major, you support clubs or bid NT I suppose|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bcallaghan: Bowles is armed with the right bidding tool for this hand.|pg||
nt|galadriel: we don,t do "boring" here:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good hand for transfers ...|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@S makes here played in E|pg||
mb|2H|nt|idc: My guess is that Murdoch though there was no way his 2@s was going to end the auction, and he could support @d later|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Quite likely to reach 6D, but RKCB may stop them.|pg||
nt|idc: but it didn't turn out that way, though I find it hard to believe West would pass his 2@s with a max for the 1@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Not an attractive 2@C opening, on such a suit at the two-level.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: S is thinking 6 and hoping for 7,,,,,, should easily find out|pg||
nt|keylime: South not wasting any time here getting on with it either|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not much South can do here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not see a bid with S hand,  thinking might have been an overbid|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|mariner1: 5@S shows 2keys and Q of @D|pg||
pc|cT|nt|keylime: 5@s is two keycards with the queen here|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: When 2NT shows spades and diamonds, would it not be better to let 4@H be rkc?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Undo please|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d4|nt|mariner1: nothing to play..... 6 or 7 depending on lead|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mariner1: so making 6|pg||
nt|keylime: West wasn't going to bed with that ace|pg||
nt|brolucius: In standard Precision, 2NT was non-forcing. They are playing a different method.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: Workmanlike auction|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a diamond lead, declarer can try to steal an extra entry to dummy (to play clubs) by inserting the @D10. Of course this is not very promising once the @D9 has been led.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|d5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Since it was not convenent to enter dummy to lead a club from that hand, declarer makes the unusual play of the @C10 from hand.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 6@S on a finesse |pg||
mb|2D|nt|idc: Another swing to EBU, and it looks like they are going to win the competition|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which is offside...|pg||
nt|chick: the Rabbi can make 6@S on this|pg||
nt|sybarra: ues |pg||
nt|sybarra: Yes|pg||
nt|chick: none of the rest of us can, though|pg||
nt|sybarra: Rabbi rule:  play ace when K is singleton |pg||
nt|sybarra: (off side)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|keylime: for those that joined us a little late, comparisons won't be coming until board 9 so hence the lack of score.|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes that was nice|pg||
nt|chick: or onside :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and for the first time ever England, Scotland or Ireland will not win the Camrose Trophy|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|idc: meanwhile Scotland falling back to last place, after reaching the dizzy heights of second last for a short while|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bjacobs: Redouble should continue the transfer, IMHO|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: it seems strange to me that the '6th' team can win the Camrose proper|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N forcing @H raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes REDBL for me too|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bjacobs: Perhaps double showed hearts.  Anyway, North seems to have a natural affinity for the 3-level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I would be shaking in my shoes if I bid 3@C, but maybe it's just one of those things you have to do |pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike where did that orginate?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bcallaghan: Looks like 6D is down, where the far worse 6H makes, or even 6NT by North with the right view.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: England has won the Camrose Trophy on 47 occasions, Scotland on 12, with these two teams tied twice. The Republic of Ireland won in 2000, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, whereas ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Northern Ireland and Wales have yet to win|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would have DBL 2@S with N here to show I had a good hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|keylime: tricky hand here, slam on just the N-S hands looks good, until you factor in the layout|pg||
nt|keylime: North knows now in concept that their hand is nearly pure in context|pg||
nt|mariner1: needs to show @D void some how.... and stay in 6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: haven't the foggiest|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mariner1: and 6 may be too much|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mariner1: 3N is very aggressive with the 1N sitting behind N|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not a bad idea.  This is a very difficult hand for N/S.  |pg||
pc|s5|nt|keylime: the layout is insanely favorable for six tho - 3-3 spades, and the 150 honors in hearts|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|idc: please note my new personal quest - to get all the web sites changed that have England winning in 96 and Scotland in 95|pg||
nt|idc: it is really the other way around - remember, you heard it here first :)|pg||
nt|keylime: 5NT is 2 keys without trump queen not counting any possible ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes a @D lead makes it very tough.... @c lead actually easier..... @S lead nuetral|pg||
nt|chick: actually, N may fear a ruff and play A@S|pg||
nt|chick: what?  the Rabbi's Rule?|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is what Ithought he might do |pg||

pc|d4|pg||

nt|idc: I've been checking back recently over Camrose history|pg||
nt|sybarra: and other room didnt find the slam on bd 8 either|pg||
mb|4H|nt|keylime: both rooms are playing at relatively the same pace it appears|pg||
nt|keylime: 3@h is a pass/correct bid here|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Desperation time. 1@S has little merit in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: well 4@C might work here.........|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: CR is playing board 1 now, so the scoreboard will get some use now|pg||
nt|chick: 2@D multi ... 4@H says play game in your suit, whichever it is|pg||
nt|mdgraham: pass-or-correct 4@H, assuming a weka two in a major with South|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to our terrific operator in Estoril, Portugal.  Job well done|pg||
pc|c4|nt|idc: the first decade of this century worst ever for Scotland: we have been below average in Camrose table for 7 of last 10 years|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: As the Multi didn't work a few boards back, he's opened a thin 1-bid instead.|pg||
nt|mariner1: DBL too strong for me|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators Mike Graham, Cornelia Yoder and Panja.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South would do something different with a strong hand, if that is part of their Multi. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, thanks operator. Very smooth|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to the Portugese Bridge Federation and Luis Correia for bringing this wonderful tourney to bbo. |pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back in just a few moments after the other table finishes|pg||
nt|panja: what is the best way to play this?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|idc: after hardly even being out of top 2 out of 4 since ... it started|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In 1936 was it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@S very aggressive and E must have seen his p's overcalls before|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: Right.  You'd have to sedate me as East if I saw 1@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Otherwise 3NT would be bid in short order|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|keylime: this has some good chances now - layout again favorable for declarer|pg||
nt|mariner1: can he make this?|pg||
nt|keylime: I think he plays East for shortness in spades here|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|chen_xin: Í¬Ñù½Ðµ½3s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|idc: yup|pg||
nt|keylime: so it looks right to play to the K@s and back up|pg||
nt|mariner1: he knows E has most everything....... except @S|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Declarer may prefer a low diamond from hand instead of weakening a side suit. |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|ianrei: he's probably thinking of ducking the lead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mariner1: needs to preserve 8@S as entry|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the K@D actually make this easier|pg||
nt|keylime: yep. has to unblock trumps to be able to work on the heart play|pg||
nt|mariner1: now he can surely make it|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there was a funny hand once where an English international opened 2@D (Multi)   |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: His partner, also an international, had a 2263 19-count, and decided that 2@D had to be a weak major, so he passed   |pg||
mc|10|nt|sybarra: gin for 7 something I suppose |pg||
nt|mdgraham: unfortunately the multi was a balanced 21-count.|pg||

mb|3N|nt|keylime: which is practically standard in China|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good man|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N works EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: better be in a suit here I think |pg||
nt|panja: supposedly natural 1@C opening, but W does not know the big Club fit..so he goes through 3@S..|pg||
nt|calabres: As Board Member of Portuguese Bridge Federation I want to thank BBO and Roland Wald for the schedule of these broadcasts on Vugraph. My special thanks to all commentators on Open ...|pg||
nt|calabres: and Closed Rooms. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suspect this EW pair play 1@C as natural|pg||
nt|panja: it is only deemed natural....3 cards should not really be termed natural...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is not the best spot|pg||
nt|calabres: Among other reasons, but mainly to the worldwide crises, bridge was affected too, so we will have only 21 teams, and some of them made by people who started to play bridge short ...|pg||
nt|calabres: time ago, we all must be grateful to them in name of their love to Bridge. Ty to all players.|pg||
nt|panja: 13/4 is 3.25, so anytime you have 3 or less cards, you have less than expectation value ...so unnatural|pg||
nt|sybarra: not bad on a @s lead which now unlikely |pg||
nt|panja: South is unlikely to lead a @D against 3Nt...note that N did not dbl 3@S...so North does not rate to have @S honour...|pg||
nt|panja: rather unlikely to lead a @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ianrei: west hands not ideal for the reasonable 5C bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Worst possible I would say|pg||
nt|panja: rather odd that after a suit is mentioned, 55 fit in that suit is not 'FOUND'|pg||
pc|h3|nt|galadriel: 5@D on @HA lead...|pg||
nt|ianrei: better played by E - may get the HA lead|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Should go down. 3NT had more play.  Hard to guess.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|keylime: and six clubs somehow comes home - might be too good for a Roland slam here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mariner1: yes 6@C would make... how to bid?|pg||
nt|keylime: it's a push and shove kind of slam|pg||
nt|keylime: I know in my normal p'ship, we probably bail at five clubs|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: 3NT is a fair contract, despite the lack of points, because West is placed with all the cards|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: shrug, down 1|pg||
nt|ianrei: risky D play - what if partner has Qxx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, the queen is in the dummy|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mariner1: well even if he makes it he losed imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: loses|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, it needs @DJ to stand up ... and it does|pg||
nt|chick: I'm very surprised at the 3@S bid.   seems reasonable enough to bid 3@H.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs: Is West thinking of cracking this?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|keylime: B2: CR - EW played 1NT after North overcalled 1H.|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure I get past 3N either|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good thing he didn't |pg||
pc|hT|nt|keylime: I know with me after I hear spades, my hand downgrades a bit|pg||
nt|panja: all because of wrong terminology...because 1@C is designated as natural.....|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: wonder if 3 @H is forcing to them |pg||
pc|c5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ianrei: ah yes - I forgot declarer had the short C !|pg||
