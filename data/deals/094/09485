nt|mdgraham: the multi 2@D seems alive and well in Portugal. It is almost dead in England |pg||

nt|chick: ok, now let's get serious :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s may bid a dodgy looking 3n|pg||
nt|lestergold: a good 8 opposite 16 quite normal but not infrangible|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|chick: I don't usually invite with a flat 8, but the 5 card clubs makes it tempting|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: very difficult - 2@S didn't promise the earth|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: well he did step in red v white with the bid |pg||
nt|santyclz: I didn't like the 4@s bid if 4@c would have been a q.|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|chick: and I would certainly never blast to 3N with N's hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim lead? gives a trick declarer would have to guess position of JH to make probably will on grounds of dim length with west so i predkict this will make|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably make ten tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course doubloe dummy a spade lead would beat this out of hand|pg||
nt|chick: if he does make it, very undeserved for such aggressive bidding|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: I think the problem was that West could not tell which of his card were working (although he can infer heart shortage) - here, they all were  |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Chick opposite a 15-17 no trump you are allowed to bid three with a five card suit and good intermediates especially osim not sure i agree|pg||

nt|lestergold: of course the qs needs to be located to make 2h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: LOL  Joe |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Would have some sympathy with a direct 6@D by East - but 7@D might be on opposite @dAKQ  |pg||
nt|chick: normally, I prefer 1@H, but I think on this hand, extra strength and all 3 other suits, X is better.  only worry about partner having a club stack and passing it|pg||

pc|cK|nt|sybarra: W may play @D to ace and @D  avoiding ruff potential |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
