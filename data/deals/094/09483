nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good evening all|pg||
nt|ady: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Martin|pg||
nt|joest: hello|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Shirley, David|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: welcome back to Estoril Open Teams 2009|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome back to Estoril and hola to Isabel, our operator |pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: hi all|pg||
nt|panja: difficult to see why North played that. The only reason could be that it is not normal, so it must be good|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Martin, Shirley, David, Jack and Bob|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: and you can't get the contracts anymore either - 1@h at the other table isn't going to set our pulses racing|pg||
nt|galadriel: Transfer response then pass|pg||
mb|2C|an|puppet|nt|bcallaghan: Danger of getting too high in spades.|pg||
nt|keylime: 2@d Multi to start from North|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi jack|pg||
nt|joest: hi Martin|pg||
nt|ady: first hand looks like 4@S n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@S either multi or weak majors|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|idc: at other table - North opened 1@h to show 11-15 and 4+ @s, so South passed it|pg||
nt|chen_xin: µÚ2½Ú¿ªÊ¼ÁË|pg||
nt|chick: possible to make 4@S, losing a spade and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Roland|pg||
mb|3D|an|asking majors|nt|bcallaghan: 4S looks like a fair contract, but not on this layout.|pg||
nt|panja: 5@D is a nice contract on board 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: puppet will help here I think |pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: oops|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Not a good idea removing partner's penalty double with a defensive trick.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 3@H showed his hand, he should not overrule partner's decision to defend|pg||
nt|idc: ok, my pulse is racing now, I admit that|pg||
mb|3N|an|both|nt|mariner1: EW can make 3N here if they get there|pg||
nt|keylime: good agreements needed here on where bids show stops or ask for stops|pg||
nt|ady: hi Jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Strange auction|pg||
mb|4D|nt|galadriel: Well, this makes the other table look tame|pg||
nt|idc: I'm getting a feeling that we are approaching 'last rubber of the night' territory|pg||
nt|chen_xin: ×ønsµÄÊÇÉòÑôÊ¥ÓêÌï¶ÓµÄ¾²ÐñºÍÑÏÇà|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Why does South prefer hearts to spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this is 16 boards from Shenyang, China|pg||
nt|chick: not so sure about that, panja.  a lot of ruffing needed and diamonds are 4-1|pg||
mb|4S|nt|panja: 3Nt is not as good..even with @S finesse there are only 8 tricks...but E must switch to @C at trick two|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: friendly lead for declarer here|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: the one that lasts for 3 hours and features many four figure penalties as the empty beer bottles build up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 800 on best defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Nicely bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Isabel, welcome to you too|pg||
nt|sybarra: play wont take long |pg||
nt|joest: hmm|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: he will win @HK and return @H10|pg||
nt|joest: if 3NT is both, are there enough bids left to show one and none?|pg||
nt|joest: I'm sure they have it all worked out though|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C  puppet stayman for 5 card majors    2@D  shows no 5 card major   but both 4 card majors|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|joest: I thought 3@d showed both|pg||
pc|s5|nt|calabres: we have con problems, will be fixed shortly|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mariner1: continue 10@H.......|pg||
nt|chen_xin: ÏÖÔÚ³¡ÉÏÐÎÊ½¶ÔÊ¥ÓêÌï²»Àû|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chick: 9 tricks now ... 3 spades, 1 heart, 1 club, 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|panja: we know @C lead would have been killing, but one can understand West not wanting to lead that after the 2@C bid|pg||
nt|chick: club lead would have given him much more problem|pg||
nt|joest: as long as they know.. :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|idc: I suspect Cooke in the other room will take this result as a vindication of his pass of 1@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for an international event, this is quite a late start|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|idc: and no one will be able to argue with him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's pointless anyway. He will tell you what's right and wrong|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chick: guaranteed to ensure that "night people" win.   morning people have no chance|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer would have had some more work on a K@s lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Auction was perfect until the 3@H bid|pg||
nt|calabres: Hi all, please be welcome to the PORTUGUESE GRAND PRIX 2009 - Estoril (Teams). We are in 2nd day of the event, round 4.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|galadriel: NS had a very good start to their debut weekend, with some good cards on Friday/Saturday|pg||
nt|galadriel: I hope they enjoyed the experience|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: claim|pg||
pc|h4|nt|panja: does the ciesta change the morning and night people division?|pg||
nt|chick: no, it's physiological|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mariner1: would have to win 3rd @S and run 9@D to make|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Bill|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi|pg||
pc|h8|pc|dQ|nt|bjacobs: There was absolutely no basis for North to push on to the 3 level|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|keylime: declarer is safely home, but a shaky start to both pairs here - with the length of match being only sixteen boards, could be rather interesting in the middle stanza|pg||
nt|mcarroll: looks like they know exactly what they are doing!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: not a lot between 4@S  and 3NT here       4@S   might have gone down on some hands with 3NT making|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

nt|mariner1: well this is  round robin so a little lee way but not much|pg||
nt|werge: Another part-score|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: looks like 1NT  e/w|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: And Wales could well overtake England for the runner-up spot|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Part score battle here if E-W can find their spade suit.|pg||
nt|idc: I think Scotland had the luck Fri & Sat, with opps playing poorly|pg||
nt|galadriel: Shows that England has strength in depth|pg||
nt|mariner1: well we could see action here..........|pg||
nt|chen_xin: ¿´¿´µÚ2½ÚÊ¥ÓêÌï»»ÈËºóÓÐÃ»ÓÐÐ§¹û|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: 1@c is precision, double is a mathe takeout for majors here|pg||
nt|chick: morning people are normally alert from about 7am to 7pm.   night people are normally alert from 3pm to 3am|pg||
nt|panja: y, what about those who are used to having a longish afternoon nap? ...is that why it is so late in Portugal? Is an afternoon break the norm there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: but against England you need to create your own luck to an extent|pg||
nt|sybarra: at a not too high of level (like 1) |pg||
nt|joest: the club guess is what thishand is about|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: and the lead might give that away|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: I would have opened the South hand. 5 controls and 5-4 shape. What about you, panel?|pg||
nt|idc: ok, that's me 1-0 ahead on sporting cliches, someone else's turn now...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the def may yet lead a @C to solve all problems|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|bcallaghan: One level too high, but still gaining IMPs.|pg||
nt|idc: Yes for sure Roland, not even close.  As 11 counts go that one is prime.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1N now shows positive response no 5 cards suits|pg||
pc|d5|nt|galadriel: The boys done good...how about that?|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I would have opened, but I count an extra half point for each ace, so I would have had a 12 count.|pg||
nt|mariner1: N again needs to pass|pg||
nt|chick: nap can help, but not really change it much|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|keylime: 2H doubled, some action already|pg||
nt|panja: ah, did I spell it wrong?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this may have a problem on a diamond lead, as there is no quick re-entry to the South hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D lead came from the other side in OR   much easier then |pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: this has some play|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|joest: well a club won't look so appealing after the dummy is exposed|pg||
nt|panja: after 4@D 's are cashed....I  suspect there is a rationale for placing the @CQ with North....|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bjacobs: North will never learn|pg||
pc|d9|nt|keylime: it does if declarer is careful - this also has the danger of 500 all over it if the ball is dropped.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nor East|pg||
nt|mariner1: well E helps out this time|pg||
pc|dT|nt|panja: North is unlikely to hold a 4-card Major...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|keylime: and declarer gets an early gift.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: all down to how declarer plays trumps now|pg||
nt|panja: so he could have 3 or four Clubs...not 3 or 2..so is more likely to hold the @CQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: well it has lots of play now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|galadriel: Wish i could say it was still early doors :(|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|joest: i agree with that|pg||

nt|panja: from either side...he can finesse twice|pg||
nt|joest: he can pick up Qxxx either way|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: only clue is the 1@D bid - |pg||
pc|c2|nt|keylime: I think he's got to tap the dummy with trumps here|pg||
nt|keylime: A@h and diamond exit appears safest|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1 @S gets ruffed and another on K@C|pg||
nt|keylime: closed room started with board nine so comparisons won't come for a bit|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North and East were both misled by their partner's bids on doubletons.  However, in neither case were South or West showing 3 card support|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: West more likely to have the ace|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: not now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|panja: y..so better to play small from South hand, isn't it?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: Well I was told that the Open Room had English commentary, but maybe I am mistaken|pg||
nt|panja: @CT first time was better..now he will have to open up some suit|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: South was forced to do something.  And West had passed 1@S|pg||
pc|c6|nt|werge: I was told the same|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|nt|panja: rather, with longer Diamonds, West is the one more likely to be short in @H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cross to a diamond and lead a small heart towards the queen - but North going down now |pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: as West may have A, J, or 10 singleton |pg||
pc|cT|nt|keylime: and that should be 670 now|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 27 down|pg||
nt|keylime: that'll settle one's nerves if N-S|pg||
nt|panja: well played...in the end|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: is this a weak 2@d bid if you play weak twos?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: If EBU gets 25, which seems likely, England must win the match by 53 IMPs|pg||
nt|werge: Here a perfect 6 @H|pg||
nt|chen_xin: ns´ò×ÔÈ»|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if it's A, you are OK, with the others you have a principle of restricted choice guess |pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: wow|pg||
nt|panja: on B3, cards well placed for NS...10 tricks in @H possible|pg||
nt|panja: should not be..|pg||
nt|joest: you can have my rights to 2@h for a very very small amount of money :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6 @S missed ?:)|pg||
nt|panja: E will be tempted to pass..|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they find the @S suit?|pg||
nt|panja: in fact, pass is the optimal bid for E|pg||
mb|2N|an|relay|nt|bcallaghan: Sporting Multi from North?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: With no singletons, it's not that easy to reach sxlam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: looks like e/w can make 4@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you guess well it is even 6 @S|pg||
nt|panja: even 12 tricks in @S|pg||
mb|4D|an|5/5 majors with singleton !d|nt|Walddk2: 3rd vul against not anything is possible|pg||
nt|galadriel: May get the @H lead :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NV against vul rather|pg||
nt|panja: well, no suitable way to get in after the 2@S opening....|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy to get in that auction |pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: second seat vulnerable partner should be reasonable so I think it would be conservative of east to pass|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bcallaghan: Against 3NT South has to find an inspired spade 9 lead to give it any problem, but it can still make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sums up the day for Scotland|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: Table is slow ... maybe late fines|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Made it look easy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And now the question was: should East have tried 7@D?|pg||
nt|panja: exchange @HA and @CA in NS hands..and 4@S will make for EW....is anyone surprised that E did not bid further even after 2nd seat Vul vs. fresh 2@S opening?|pg||
nt|ady: might even make 6 spades|pg||
nt|panja: I am told 2@H shows @H + some suit...do we have a confirmation of that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not particularly|pg||
nt|bobholl: should be otherwise i'd passs as east|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" only fibbed a little bit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|keylime: nice lead by North, knowing there's some clubs to ruff in dummy, and by holding onto their Aces.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Why not 2@S?|pg||
nt|keylime: partial swing potentially there|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Amazing hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: me neither jack|pg||
nt|panja: it is good to play a non-normal game, adds spice.....you don't really need justification|pg||
nt|joest: could have lost to stiff jack of spades.  I guess I could see losing the hook but certainly seems right to start with the king|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|panja: ideally, @SKQ after @HK was ruffed..|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: To defeat the contract, North probably had to give away a ruff sluff when in with @CA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: likely 1NT=15-17 in 3rd and 4th positions |pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: All too hard|pg||
nt|sybarra: S finding the bid "amusing" |pg||
nt|joest: so now if the panelists had a 'majors' call avaiilable here would you trot it out as east?|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In theory, neither makes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: no problems now|pg||
nt|panja: this works out fine only because North has wasted values in @H..opposite a singleton|pg||
pc|cA|nt|galadriel: Seems no-one likes @Ss anymore|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Seems impossible to get to spades. I am lost|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Seems to be an anti-spade pact.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ianrei: I think the first X showed H|pg||
nt|galadriel: I always thought that 1@C (1@D) X guaranteed equal length in maj|pg||
nt|sybarra: well...|pg||
nt|chick: sure would be interesting to know what each player thinks these bids mean :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if this is a bidding misunderstanding - apologies to NS if not|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Maybe Bowles' double showed hearts and Howard's a support double?|pg||
nt|panja: I can imagine so many hands where N would have 4 Spades and xxx or Axx of @H where 4@S would be odds on|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has a playhas to find J@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not on that lead!|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 4@H is off now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a smart lead, if you think about it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The chance of partner being short is quite good.  And you have @HA to control the trump suit and give the ruff|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: but it sure looks like it :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: sensible to play what you play over a NT opening over an overcall as well, so 2@H here=transfer to spades  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like 2@h was (North) cue-bid (South) transfer |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I would expect to see 5 @S in dummy|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I reckon South was expecting that.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: In that case the spade suit is lost|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c9|nt|bcallaghan: My preference is to play the double of 1D as guaranteeing both majors.  These pairs obviously don't.|pg||
nt|mariner1: now to make|pg||
nt|keylime: this is going to be a challenge.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ianrei: and west's X showed 3H|pg||
nt|galadriel: I'm with you Brian|pg||
nt|ianrei: responses to 1C are transfer|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but you lose spades when opener is 4-3 in the majors and responder not strong enough to bid again|pg||
nt|ady: this also a good line     spade entry|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mariner1: well can he make it?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|galadriel: Ah, even after overcall?|pg||
nt|keylime: declarer will have to play desperate here, and the spade cover almost forces the finesse in spades.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ianrei: after 1D, X replaces the 1D response|pg||
pc|sA|nt|galadriel: yes, I see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I understand, but I am entirely happy with a system where you may lose the boss suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *not happy|pg||
nt|idc: Playing a short 1@c system, I used to play X as both or neither majors - but whatever you do doesn't matter, as long as you both do it|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the @S lead and play allows a chance to make now|pg||
nt|keylime: the fact that a heart lead was indicated and rejected, interests me|pg||

nt|keylime: two big scores for N-S |pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@D makes here, 6N makes|pg||
nt|keylime: and another slam coming here|pg||
nt|mariner1: that could be a big swing|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if East's safe exit card of the @S7 had somehow been removed, he could avoid an endplay in the trump suit by ducking the @DK, as he just did anyway.|pg||
nt|sybarra: a real misfit here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: With no major, you support clubs or bid NT I suppose|pg||

nt|mariner1: 6@S makes here played in E|pg||

mb|1D|an|could be 3 cards !d|nt|idc: My guess is that Murdoch though there was no way his 2@s was going to end the auction, and he could support @d later|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Quite likely to reach 6D, but RKCB may stop them.|pg||
nt|idc: but it didn't turn out that way, though I find it hard to believe West would pass his 2@s with a max for the 1@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Not an attractive 2@C opening, on such a suit at the two-level.|pg||
nt|panja: yes, but potential for 9 tricks for NS...the way the cards are|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: S is thinking 6 and hoping for 7,,,,,, should easily find out|pg||

pc|d5|nt|mariner1: so making 6|pg||
nt|keylime: West wasn't going to bed with that ace|pg||
nt|brolucius: In standard Precision, 2NT was non-forcing. They are playing a different method.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: Workmanlike auction|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a diamond lead, declarer can try to steal an extra entry to dummy (to play clubs) by inserting the @D10. Of course this is not very promising once the @D9 has been led.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|panja: still, after the @H lead, they might make 5 tricks...just give away a small @H when in next|pg||
nt|ady: now looks like diamonds not breaking|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|brolucius: Since it was not convenent to enter dummy to lead a club from that hand, declarer makes the unusual play of the @C10 from hand.|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|joest: good play|pg||

nt|panja: she is...rather|pg||
nt|sybarra: poor S,  just no good card to pitch unless they can execute the sequece perfectly |pg||
nt|bobholl: actually west can be squeezed :)|pg||

nt|mariner1: DBL?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes REDBL for me too|pg||
nt|joest: don't forget the spade split too|pg||
nt|panja: the deemed natural 1@C opening falsely encourages West to move past 3Nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Perhaps double showed hearts.  Anyway, North seems to have a natural affinity for the 3-level|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: and 6 may be too much|pg||

nt|mariner1: DBL too strong for me|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators Mike Graham, Cornelia Yoder and Panja.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South would do something different with a strong hand, if that is part of their Multi. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, thanks operator. Very smooth|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to the Portugese Bridge Federation and Luis Correia for bringing this wonderful tourney to bbo. |pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back in just a few moments after the other table finishes|pg||
nt|panja: what is the best way to play this?|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: after hardly even being out of top 2 out of 4 since ... it started|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In 1936 was it?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@S very aggressive and E must have seen his p's overcalls before|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Right.  You'd have to sedate me as East if I saw 1@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Otherwise 3NT would be bid in short order|pg||
nt|sybarra: you were right Jack |pg||
nt|mcarroll: This could be interesting - the @S bids  may help to get to a slam|pg||
nt|ady: game bid will be fine for n/s  will get  back losses from previous board|pg||
nt|joest: I thought 3@s was an overbid.  Is east contemplating more??|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@S will be expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: this has some good chances now - layout again favorable for declarer|pg||
nt|mariner1: can he make this?|pg||
nt|keylime: I think he plays East for shortness in spades here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: likely taking 9 tricks and home |pg||
pc|sT|nt|chen_xin: Í¬Ñù½Ðµ½3s|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|idc: yup|pg||
nt|keylime: so it looks right to play to the K@s and back up|pg||
nt|mariner1: he knows E has most everything....... except @S|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Declarer may prefer a low diamond from hand instead of weakening a side suit. |pg||
nt|sybarra: getting out of Dodge I mean |pg||
nt|ady: 4S   would not play badly|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|ianrei: he's probably thinking of ducking the lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: needs to preserve 8@S as entry|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the K@D actually make this easier|pg||
nt|keylime: yep. has to unblock trumps to be able to work on the heart play|pg||
nt|mariner1: now he can surely make it|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there was a funny hand once where an English international opened 2@D (Multi)   |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|joest: in the other room, south opened and after rebidding 2@d, south heard a 3@h call from partner.  Partner thought it was a splinter; South thought it was natural. Hence 5@h four down|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: His partner, also an international, had a 2263 19-count, and decided that 2@D had to be a weak major, so he passed   |pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: gin for 7 something I suppose |pg||
nt|mdgraham: unfortunately the multi was a balanced 21-count.|pg||
nt|panja: thx all, bye|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx all we can wander to other table |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thabnks all, bye for now - see you soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzmh: We will be back in 10 minutes time ... ty all ... special thanks to our wonderful commentators|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dK|nt|mariner1: now has it if he plays @S right|pg||
nt|keylime: smooth sailing now for declarer; they know the situation|pg||
nt|keylime: CR: First imp recorded as Multi was not opened, leading to a calm 3NT auction.|pg||

nt|keylime: nice to go back to teammates and announced two doubled partials into game, and two slams|pg||
nt|mariner1: I mean NS for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Shirley Ubarra, Mike Graham, Cornelia Yoder and Panja|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ybarra|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evening all. Champions League: Chelsea 4 Liverpool 4|pg||
nt|sybarra: might have shared boards or played out of order |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is last hand of this set, right Isabel?|pg||
nt|ady: slam in hearts here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bjacobs: Someone should run from 1NT?  Maybe West?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone @H@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is an 11 count I would not open, but it's their style apparently|pg||
mb|2D|nt|panja: we begin with a 50% slam for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianrei: they open all bal 11 counts|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: I wouldn't open it either.|pg||
nt|chick: 50% in clubs.  in hearts, need a split of hearts as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to our terrific operator in Estoril, Portugal.  Job well done Isabel! |pg||
mb|2H|nt|idc: Anne has already mentioned the NS overcalling style|pg||
nt|idc: I'd call it 'loose' - not agressive but loose|pg||
nt|keylime: EW also using precision is appears|pg||
nt|calabres: Hi all, please be welcome to the PORTUGUESE GRAND PRIX 2009 - Estoril (Teams). After 1st Round I will indicate the link to results.|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @C fit short @C now ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime: which is practically standard in China|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good man|pg||
nt|sybarra: the other room starts on the  with 7 and 8 ... so we start first ... and you can see comparisons on open table|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: 3N works EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: better be in a suit here I think |pg||
nt|panja: supposedly natural 1@C opening, but W does not know the big Club fit..so he goes through 3@S..|pg||
nt|calabres: As Board Member of Portuguese Bridge Federation I want to thank BBO and Roland Wald for the schedule of these broadcasts on Vugraph. My special thanks to all commentators on Open ...|pg||
nt|calabres: and Closed Rooms. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suspect this EW pair play 1@C as natural|pg||
nt|panja: it is only deemed natural....3 cards should not really be termed natural...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is not the best spot|pg||
nt|calabres: Among other reasons, but mainly to the worldwide crises, bridge was affected too, so we will have only 21 teams, and some of them made by people who started to play bridge short ...|pg||
nt|calabres: time ago, we all must be grateful to them in name of their love to Bridge. Ty to all players.|pg||
nt|panja: 13/4 is 3.25, so anytime you have 3 or less cards, you have less than expectation value ...so unnatural|pg||
nt|sybarra: not bad on a @s lead which now unlikely |pg||
nt|panja: South is unlikely to lead a @D against 3Nt...note that N did not dbl 3@S...so North does not rate to have @S honour...|pg||
nt|panja: rather unlikely to lead a @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ianrei: west hands not ideal for the reasonable 5C bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Worst possible I would say|pg||
nt|panja: rather odd that after a suit is mentioned, 55 fit in that suit is not 'FOUND'|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: 5@D on @HA lead...|pg||
nt|ianrei: better played by E - may get the HA lead|pg||
nt|bcallaghan: Should go down. 3NT had more play.  Hard to guess.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators  Jack, Panja, David, Martin and Bob. Always an interesting discussion and insights.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: i see. didn't think we were only playing 8 boards. sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to the Portugese Bridge Federation and Luis Correia and Rosaline  for bringing this wonderful tourney to bbo. |pg||
pc|sK|nt|keylime: and six clubs somehow comes home - might be too good for a Roland slam here|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mariner1: yes 6@C would make... how to bid?|pg||
nt|keylime: it's a push and shove kind of slam|pg||
nt|keylime: I know in my normal p'ship, we probably bail at five clubs|pg||
nt|panja: thx all|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT is a fair contract, despite the lack of points, because West is placed with all the cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: And to our specs,-- greatest audience in the world.  We appreciate you comments and thoughts@H|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: shrug, down 1|pg||
nt|ianrei: risky D play - what if partner has Qxx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, the queen is in the dummy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: well even if he makes it he losed imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: loses|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Mind you, it needs @DJ to stand up ... and it does|pg||
nt|chick: I'm very surprised at the 3@S bid.   seems reasonable enough to bid 3@H.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is West thinking of cracking this?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|keylime: B2: CR - EW played 1NT after North overcalled 1H.|pg||
nt|mariner1: not sure I get past 3N either|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good thing he didn't |pg||
pc|c3|nt|keylime: I know with me after I hear spades, my hand downgrades a bit|pg||
nt|panja: all because of wrong terminology...because 1@C is designated as natural.....|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: wonder if 3 @H is forcing to them |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ianrei: ah yes - I forgot declarer had the short C !|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a Waterlow-Hackect CC which states that 1x=4+cards. Don't know if this pair does the same |pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: he's already a passed hand, so partner isn't going to go nuts|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|s2|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|s5|nt|chick: but he got lucky with the lead, so will make overtricks when the other suits break nicely|pg||
nt|panja: he would have made just nine if North had not played second hand high|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mariner1: there is reason to play Q there and not 10@D|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|h8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|keylime: Q I think is superior - caters to more 4-2 splits, right Rob?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
mc|12|nt|bobholl: see you all in an hour or so tya :)|pg||
