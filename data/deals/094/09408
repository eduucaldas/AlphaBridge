nt|garnetts: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: hi all|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|1S|nt|josj: a grand slam for breakfast|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|garnetts: 5@D is clearly the best contract--but even that may be too high|pg||
mb|3D|nt|garnetts: Sometimes this sort of pre-emptive tactics help declarer  in the play|pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: we start off with an everyday grand|pg||
nt|col3435: do you think it points out the diamond situation here?|pg||
nt|garnetts: The heart position will force west to unguard the Kxx of spades because the Q@H acts as a squeeze xard|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: wondering if they get there -- it's certainly possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: 4@S should be cue with @C as trumps|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho there are only 2 visible losers in 5c, 11 winners may well prove dfficult if they reach it|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Avram|pg||
mb|4C|nt|garnetts: I think dec will not get the @D position right--the 3@H will ensure that---I am afraid I would have bid 4@H which would have been a better indication|pg||
nt|col3435: yes|pg||
nt|garnetts: Still we have stopped short for some reason|pg||
nt|garnetts: North can't have much faith in his partner's bidding or card play lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: dummy lost its @s 4 and now looking for it|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|josj: 5@D = 4 KC with @C trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: but it's seldom easy to bid a grand based on long, well-fitting suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: they are thee!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: hi mike|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: pity|pg||
nt|josj: you were right, Vladimir...|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|josj: with @H 5-1 the @D finesse is needed in 7 but it would have been an excellent contract|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|Walddk2: I don't expect them to bid a grand slam here; even 6 is a fine effort|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a very good result for n/s in the other room|pg||
nt|ctcbaadmin: NS in both rooms are Precisioners, so we will see similar start of the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was even harder for N-S in the other room when E-W were in 4@S before they knew it|pg||
nt|xenya: well 7@H is cold here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe that's what you need to be pushed to slam|pg||
nt|ctcbaadmin: yes, with D 4-3|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ctcbaadmin: if East just raised to 3S, south may bid 4H only and it's up to North to get to the slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|roswolf: north has to reckon his 2 aces are pure gold|pg||
mb|p|nt|ctcbaadmin: south is unsure whether a mere 3H bid is forcing or not, so the leap to 4H|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 aces and a singleton|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 4-card support, and a singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the singleton diamond is worth a lot too|pg||

nt|col3435: and I thought that's what he was playing for too|pg||
nt|lestergold: a cars lie 4h looks cold for e/w|pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: previous results http://www.bridge.ee/MV/VK09/VK09-3.htm|pg||
mb|1N|nt|josj: another near-slam but this time it will fail|pg||
nt|josj: so it should end up in a boring 3nt|pg||
nt|april7: after opening and stayman E will play 4@Hlosing 2 @C and 1 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this also looks slammy, but they'd better stay out of it, it seems |pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|col3435: I don't know whether these 1@c bids are "strong" clubs or something else - anyone have any information?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|xenya: too much duplication in @Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the wasted qj of clubs is compensatwed for by the nfavourable position of the spade ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: opening lead most probably a @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is likley to be flat 4h a completely normal papa mama contract|pg||
nt|april7: or trump|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|garnetts: this is a good slam--only a heart lead makes it dodgy--but even then 50%|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: and no long suits or fits this time -- they should diagnose it i think and stop short|pg||
nt|xenya: but no...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|josj: even @DJ10xx with S is not enough|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|josj: this would make on a favourable @D position + @C 3-3 or so...|pg||
nt|lestergold: why such a hurry to play spade?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|col3435: looks like 2@s was forcing, in which case surely 4@s isn't the right way to go about things|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: seems slam depends on Axx in the W hand and @Cs 3-3 -- no such luck|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well I want to be in six on these tickets|pg||
pc|dA|nt|josj: asking too much even for a Roland slam (which requires about 12.89 % as you may know)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|lestergold: not that it will make any difference on this hand|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|garnetts: I think 4@S was an effort to suggest minimum with no outside values of any merit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|col3435: hmm, is that what East has? Doesn't look like it to me :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: 3 rounds ofm trumps aj of dims and then spade was a more normal sequence of play|pg||

nt|roswolf: the leaders gained another imp on board 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ctcbaadmin: guess NS will be pushed to 3S for -1|pg||
nt|xenya: but may be some partscore battle here|pg||
nt|roswolf: south may treat this as a mixed type raise here|pg||
nt|ctcbaadmin: or south may bid it volunteerly|pg||
mb|p|nt|ctcbaadmin: West 3H and south 3S may end the auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|ctcbaadmin: south may also pass 3H, he has seen his partner's non Vul. 3rd hand opening before|pg||
nt|roswolf: east is not tempted to bid on|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ctcbaadmin: well done, Shih.  He saw partner opened 4-card major in 3rd seat too many time and he already showed his 4-card support|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is not a hopeless contract|pg||
nt|ctcbaadmin: declarer has no reason to guess the trump position|pg||
nt|ctcbaadmin: he need to play trumps before touching the minor suits since which may expose to a ruffing |pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think it is possible north has to have SOME cards to open and south has shown an inv raise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, although they rate to break 3-2 when N-S did not take the push|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point roland|pg||
nt|ctcbaadmin: in fact north only needs to have 13 cards to open 3rd seat at this Vul.|pg||

nt|april7: either W will repeat the @S or bid 2@C and play there|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|xenya: on 1, Monte Carlo also stopped in 6 in OR, but they gained 2 imps by bidding 6N|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|garnetts: This is a reasonable 4@S contract--but very hard to get to|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: 2@D looks like a good bid here to me--unusual but what else|pg||
nt|col3435: yes you probably need South not to rebid 2NT for a start|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|garnetts: I hate 2NT with xxx in hearts|pg||
nt|april7: its a favourable position in @C and @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: connection lost, sorry|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: pass from E looks a bit strange to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: no problems heremay well make 3 losing a trick in each suit|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzmf: 2NT is problably seminatural also|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT is silly--surely 3@S is much better|pg||
nt|col3435: but the alerting suggests that this is an artificial sequence|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|col3435: in which case maybe they are bound by their system|pg||
nt|april7: 10 of @C and @S from dummy|pg||
nt|april7: W is in wrong hand now|pg||
nt|lestergold: that avram would have been a better line|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|xenya: but perhaps that's their style|pg||
nt|col3435: say if this is an agreed way to show 5=3=3=2 shape|pg||
nt|garnetts: I hate any system that gets me to 3NT here|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: well hes playing it a little lazily|pg||
pc|s3|nt|josj: X seems more appropriate but they reached the proper contract after all|pg||
pc|d2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: to make on the nose|pg||
nt|april7: but no danger for the contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: west of course was orried about a possible lub ruff |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|garnetts: You are right perhaps about systemic arrangements--but surely there are time when they must be put aside|pg||

nt|roswolf: odd|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ctcbaadmin: their 2C/2D are GF and East hates to bid a invitational 2NT with xx in Hearts, thus the 3-card 1S bid|pg||

mb|2C!|an|54 majors, weak|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I agree--but there are times when instinct and judgement maust override this|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|vugraphzmf: Monte Carlo is the current leader ater 2 round robins, Pärnu 3 is on 8th place|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|april7: a very risky bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: These hands are not that easy--here 3NT is the best contract looking at EW only --but again tough to get to|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 13 imps to Monte Carlo on 2, when they stopped in 5N in OR -- also a bit too high, but makeable as it is|pg||

nt|garnetts: when you need KQX onside play for it|pg||
nt|garnetts: It really doesn't matter going more down--go for it|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|d|mb|3C!|nt|xenya: despite this somewhat disappointing score, we have seen some interesting hands -- i enjoyed the set|pg||
nt|josj: close to slam again but 4@H is enough here|pg||
nt|josj: an interesting set it was, yes|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|garnetts: This will play badly if East floats it|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: we will continue in 25 mins from now|pg||
nt|garnetts: that cannot be right surely |pg||
nt|vugraphzmf: 1@s alert because psyches sometimes occures|pg||
nt|garnetts: The men in white coats will come for North shortly |pg||
nt|col3435: so this is a psychic psyche-reveal?|pg||
nt|garnetts: a penalty try I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: East should double to show values here |pg||
nt|col3435: double would be hearts for me, unfortunately|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: you don't want to be in 6 missing AJ10xx in trumps|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H down on a @D lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: AJ109x rather|pg||
nt|josj: depends :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4h will be reache andaltho it was off in open i think it has play if they dont find the spade ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 discards can be created now fopr spade losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: draw trumps ruff out clubs play dim and ten tricks?|pg||
nt|april7: with the ruffing finesse in @C S loses only 1 @D and 2 @S tricks, after pulling trumps ofcourse|pg||

nt|garnetts: a devastating lead :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: oddly enough, game has been missed by EW|pg||
