nt|thegarve:  EW might get overboard|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|snorris: 24hp combined|pg||
nt|snorris: even without @c lead 3nt is not winning|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt might make if you get the hearts going |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: squeeze north in spades and diamonds|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: something like that|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: For those in the audience who don't already know .... if you mouseover the Closed Room score at the top left, you can see the auction from the other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|athene: but the defence should organise it so that south wins the first heart and clears clubs|pg||
nt|thegarve:  its at these times that the 10-19 point 1NT openers springs into action|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|othered1: west passed 1@H?  Seems odd, as follow-ups could be tricky.|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|snorris: liky now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|snorris: like|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|snorris: -1 only|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch both vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 10, most don't. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|thegarve:  might  e two off might lose 3@s tricks|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
nt|athene: yes, not many entries to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can see that Martin uses the web client, the other commentators the Windows client|pg||
nt|athene: the defence's job is to avoid leading spades and diamonds, which would help declarer take finesses|pg||
nt|othered1: This is going to work out well for west, slightly lucky that east is not shorter in @C|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|thegarve:  easier at times - sees other table results better|pg||
pc|s2|nt|snorris: off to a good start the defence|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|athene: when you see a dummy like that south hand at trick 2, you think "don't do anything!"|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: defend completely passively|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|thegarve:  used to have to gpo to the movie before|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||

nt|snorris: first help|pg||
nt|thegarve:  6@c might bea an entry|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: typical example from west there|pg||
pc|h5|nt|thegarve:  ao one off|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: still can keep declarer handlocked|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: leading up to @D87x looks completely safe|pg||
nt|athene: but no, it isn;t|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|thegarve:  hmm the usefule 2@c has sone|pg||
nt|othered1: now @C|pg||
nt|snorris: or @h|pg||
nt|athene: save the @H10 as exit card for later|pg||
nt|othered1: @H not as good --  doesn't it endplay opps in @D?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|d4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|thegarve:  he never saw the potential 9@c dropping|pg||
nt|snorris: can do yes|pg||
nt|othered1: now west gets in and has @H out|pg||
nt|athene: now west can't be endplayed - if north cashes the trump, the @H10 is cashable|pg||
nt|athene: if he doesn't, the @H10 is an exit card|pg||
nt|thegarve:  now K@D exit|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has to give up on endplaying west, and endplay east instead|pg||
pc|cT|nt|thegarve:  no 10@c first squeezing West|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h9|nt|athene: i'm not sure he knows where the @H10 is though|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: now declarer just gets squeezed|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: cash @H10 squeezes declarer|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: but he might well have placed the @H10 in east's hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: winkler goes for the disciplined 1@C (:)) as opposed to the other room action|pg||
nt|thegarve:  needs to play it cool now and not punt 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: he needs to take lessons in cool from west maybe|pg||
nt|athene: just to keep up the obscure TV references|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|chick: 1N now should show around 18-19|pg||
nt|thegarve:  5 and 6 imps swings keep the clock ticking over|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt shows a real hand there|pg||
nt|athene: so south might well just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: i would have been tempted to try 2@D over 1@H, just because the suit is so nice|pg||
nt|chick: S should consider that 24-25 points is enough for 3N if the NS hands are relatively equal in HCP .... with a big imbalance, you usually need more|pg||
nt|snorris: n-s hope is a misunderstanding about the range of 1nt|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|athene: but people don't really promise much in the minors for t/o doubles, so you would like to have a 5-card suit for that i suppose|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|snorris: redouble?|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@CXX?|pg||
nt|snorris: thats a game!|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  hmm not so bright|pg||

mb|d|mb|4H|nt|othered1: 5@C is a nice spot avoiding NT despite east's solid stopper|pg||
nt|athene: east is a bit stuck if double promises 4 spades exactly 100% of the time|pg||
nt|snorris: dont think they double..maybe sacrifice|pg||
nt|athene: but if they play it a bit more freewheeling, it's ok|pg||
nt|thegarve:  North has an ace|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: west might bid 6@C now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i guess playing partner for AA is a bit optimistic|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|snorris: or not..|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem is the bidding boxes don't have "Pass (forcing)" in them :( would be nice|pg||

nt|athene: can get away with 2 down now|pg||
nt|snorris: @s ..|pg||
nt|athene: for example, heart lead, east must split|pg||
nt|athene: now you force an entry to dummy in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: and hook the @S10|pg||
nt|thegarve:  entry if 9@h is covered|pg||
nt|athene: alternatively ruff a club and entry endplay east with a low heart to the @H9|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|thegarve:  might just punt 3nt|pg||

nt|snorris: if its manageble then thre long first|pg||
nt|snorris: here it is|pg||
nt|chick: a clear cut choice-of-game bid|pg||
nt|snorris: like this..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: sometimes you may have to b id @S at a high level, but if north was willing to bid 4@S on this auction, surely it's right for him to open 1@D|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|snorris: neither seems to be a winner|pg||
nt|thegarve:  needs q@s not covered|pg||
nt|athene: a gentle 2@S over 2@H sort of shows his hand, no?|pg||
nt|othered1: 6-2 often right, depending on suit qualities|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|c5|nt|athene: well there's a lot of difference between a 6-5 with a fit and a 6-5 without...but he was unlucky his partner didn't have three cards in either of his suits, certainly|pg||

nt|thegarve:  so "NT minors from South |pg||
nt|thegarve:  and 3@s from North|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ah yes would make sense that way round too :)|pg||
nt|thegarve:  or 2NT from North and 3S minors from SOuth|pg||
nt|snorris: think thats it|pg||
nt|thegarve:  both could have been possible :(|pg||
nt|snorris: so a killing @h lead comming|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt wouldn't be everyone's choice with a 6-card major but it's not a bad overall description of the hand|pg||
nt|thegarve:  they are also 77 IMPs down|pg||
nt|snorris: not my choise|pg||
nt|chick: Galim needs a lot of IMPs to recover|pg||
nt|snorris: only singel stoppes in sidesuits|pg||
nt|chick: so perhaps we'll see some aggressive bidding|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, all|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: when south shows minors, north must be worried about hearts in 3nt|pg||
mc|8|nt|chick: Hi Ed :)|pg||
