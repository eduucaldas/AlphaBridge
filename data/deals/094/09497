mb|p|mb|1C|mb|4S|nt|mug: suprised that wasn't a weak NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5-4-2-2 14 counts do not open a weak no-trump. Save that for 11 counts|pg||

mb|p|nt|mug: close lead this is|pg||
nt|roswolf: a red card is generally best!|pg||
nt|mug: 5-4-2-2 14 count yes Liz, but AK doubleton devalues the hand|pg||

nt|mug: I think Stayman is misere with that hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Unless partner has four spades and a small doubleton club. Then West has a 5-card club suit to lead from|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: mind you, he curses more loudly when we make it and four of the major would have gone down|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps a forcing 3@S and a non-serious 3NT?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think they play 4card majors?|pg||
nt|mug: if 3@S wasn't forcing surely North should have passed, aces are good but singleton in partner's suit and only five spades isn't|pg||

mb|1N|nt|roswolf: this could go for a lot|pg||
nt|dburn: to me also, and if I were playing a weak no trump I would have opened one, been raised to three, received a club lead, misguessed spades, and gone down|pg||
nt|mug: as so often 3NT became easy on the lead, whereas 4@S declarer would have to work for|pg||
mb|d|mb|r!|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|roswolf: if this is played in 2@SX blood will flow|pg||
nt|dburn: still, that's life in the big city, and this may be an example of why the weak no trump is not all that great an idea vulnerable|pg||
nt|mug: it's not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|dburn: assuming, of course, that North-South can double things and collect penalties|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well surely they will now|pg||

nt|dburn: or won't|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry slow typing speed leads me into error|pg||
nt|mug: won't |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: btw i think bidding in the north position is misere|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: The original double is a tad pushy?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mug: minimum but sound|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the original double is normal|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: may be but if you double you must be consistent|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: You're an aggressive lot down South|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|mug: yes I think that's the point Geoffrey, so North should double or pass according to agreement|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree|pg||
nt|mug: as if to reinforce the point, 3NT doesn't make either|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They were surely better off defending 2@S doubled|pg||
nt|dburn: well, North-South would probably have reached some game or other left to their own devices|pg||
nt|roswolf: well there mighy be a swindle if north wins and plays a low heart....|pg||
