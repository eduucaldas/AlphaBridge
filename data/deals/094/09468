nt|jrssd: indeed, this is an online reunion of sorts|pg||
nt|diamond_: Thanks John - it was a bit lonely for Al|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Steve|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Steve|pg||
nt|lestergold: a routine 3n to bid on n/s cards|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mariner1: 4@S EW has play here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jrssd: Eeast played 1@S in the other room, just making|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4 spades 2h 2d and a club available maybe....2 clubs...depends how play goes|pg||
nt|mariner1: don't see this 2@D treatment often|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|jrssd: using dummies 2 entries to lead Spades towards his KQXXX|pg||
nt|sybarra2: strongish |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: hi shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra2: or intermediate|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: W might have just bid 4@S|pg||
nt|irwinbo: in some circles the north hand is opened one nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jrssd: in the other room the North opened 1@C, which influenced South to lead his doubleton Q.|pg||
nt|jrssd: this will require some help from the defense if it's going to make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: best lead for the def is a heart|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: 1n i assume foring in their sys|pg||
nt|lestergold: communications are slightll awkward here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kiwi_joker: y - the 2@D may be a bit prepared ..|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Grant Ker play precision with 2@D 11/15 6@D or 5/5 minors|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: best start for the defence ... declarer will want to unblock the hearts ..but will also be wary of removing entries to that spade suit ... so a little tricky|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy o play double dummy n ot so easy when you can only see 2 hands|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: maybe intrafinesse in @C|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|irwinbo: had to overtake and return a club|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jrssd: it seems as though declarer could set up a @C for his 8th trick|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: he did not duck because of limited entries and communication|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: if he did, declarer would pitch @DJ ... Ace had to be cashed first|pg||
nt|irwinbo: no pitching diamond leaves him with a heart loser|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: y, true|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|jrssd: but not now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe needed to do it when in hand with @H|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: he played hearts first so finesse in spades into 'safe' hand but....|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|jrssd: yes, he needed to use dummies entries, just as in the CR, to make 2@S|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: declarer does not kbnow of the nasty surprise in spades|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|jrssd: by leading trumps|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: well off on this line|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: misclick?|pg||
nt|lestergold: even offf if he takes the spade finesse|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: this should be 4 imps for Burrows -- they need a lot more, but it's a start :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and a @H |pg||
pc|h7|nt|kiwi_joker: looks like he did indeed finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphznp: ni missclick|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: but he will still take club and go off|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes he must have kept ace of clubs .... curse the cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably bid and off in the open room too|pg||
nt|vugraphznp: yes he ndid|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jrssd: this was not well defended in the CR; South broke Hearts leading to 3 tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20 hand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N would be tough if the try it|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 2h north south limit well as with most 20/20 hands someone goes overboad|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|jrssd: Neither  EW pair plays 2/1 as a Game Force|pg||
nt|jrssd: wow - that's a very brave 2@D bid|pg||
nt|jrssd: perhaps Al will check the GFedness of 2@C :)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Am moderately surprised that the Burrows team went with this lineup into such a crucial stage ...30-odd behind and 2 stanzas to go -  in the past, Miller-Stout (sitting out here) ...|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: have been their most consistent pairing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: don't blame me for lack of info in the FD file - the EW Convention does NOT say 2/1 FG|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H made here|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yeah ..they get up to 8 tricks ok (that's if finding @DQ succesfully) ..but then ...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jrssd: I don't think that's a word|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h can make on a misdefence cannot see how legitimately|pg||
nt|lestergold: well yes maybe a ican swee how|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence will be fixed defence cannot open clubs if they paly dims they will create extra discard for clubs and if they dont a dim goes on spade so i think that ion the wash it ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: should make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if defence play @D np, if defence don't play @D then the declarer will have problems to discard a @D on the 4th @s|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes ui said it i think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: must duck K in @H to best defence|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yes, an interesting kind of Mortons Fork for the def when they win the spade ace :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: that was on tip of my tongue that fork thing|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: ..either open up a minor and giev the contract away, or return a neutral spade and give it away|pg||
nt|bridge_one: It is a kind of hand that need concentration to play, otherwise sure a present for the declarer|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: of course, a low club from Ware forces a critical decision from Ker|pg||
nt|lestergold: best defence is indeed to give declarer a losing option in the club suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dukk two time K in @h, after take A in @S at 3th round, and play K in @h - no way to make the contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i suppose we are stuck|pg||
nt|lestergold: what if declarer draws all the hearts then plays spades ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: seems the natural line|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer wants to strip east of exits|pg||
nt|bridge_one: take at 3th round, and now must play @C obliged|pg||
nt|vugraphznp: Sorry folks, wireless isn't all its cracked up to be!!!|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: what happens when we try to broadcast out of a third world country, I guess  :)|pg||
nt|diamond_: We appear to be frozen in the closed room|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: train leaving the rails|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mariner1: can S pass?|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i wouldn't think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|jrssd: after some helpful info from the opps, the normal 3N is reached|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but are there 9 tricks?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: maybe now there are|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mariner1: well good thing he did|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: consider the @DQ found!|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|jrssd: I think the defense gave up both red suits in the CR|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|jrssd: a good (normal) duck|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: not sure when @H10 is right - maybe Anthony trusted auction [partner's pass of 2@H] more than the lead?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jrssd: Declarer is hoping the A@S was onside|pg||
pc|h3|pc|dA|nt|jrssd: now at the crossroad|pg||
nt|jrssd: (s)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction and @D9 scream -- stay away from @D|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jrssd: the @D9 should make the club play easy|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|jrssd: exactly|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h8|pc|dT|nt|jrssd: North just has to be careful in discarding now|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: are there 9 tricks from endplay in @C|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|jrssd: no|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jrssd: declarer discards 1st|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
mc|11|nt|mariner1: 17 was a double set swing and 6 imps for Cornell|pg||
pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: operator, are the colours correct for the team names? Score box doesnt match player's labels|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: foiled again -- 9 tricks only AFTER losing 5|pg||
nt|nickf: it was in fact 6 imps to the Burrows playes|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mariner1: Nick look again|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|jrssd: I'm not sure the West hand merited a JUMP in Hearts after pards neg dbl|pg||
nt|jrssd: sry, he opened 2C|pg||
nt|mariner1: do we have the team names wrong?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jrssd: he had to bid it!|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh right EW are Cornell.... and NS are Burrows|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: which is why Meckwell play 2@C guarantees 6+@C and 2@D covers the (43)15, 4414 and 4405 hands|pg||
nt|mariner1: so our score is not going to be correct as the team names are reversed (in both|pg||
nt|mariner1: rooms)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jrssd: it was a pushy  neg dbl - East was unlikely to find an 8 card fit if his pard didn't have 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but in NZ/OZ even if you play precision, 2@D is some form of Multi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this will negate most of the 14-0 start for Burrows|pg||
nt|jrssd: down 1 off the top, but will there be 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: big hands for EW here, but no slam available ..even 5@H threatened by club ruff. Cornell did well to bail out|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra2: and no way to fix  unless we shut down easier just for us to keep track|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes simple 4@H it seems|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|h5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jrssd: declarer would like to lead trumps at some point, but only when he has the side suits under control|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting time for @HJ to be rusinow|pg||
nt|jrssd: this is swinging back and forth|pg||
nt|jrssd: between -1 and  -2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||

mb|1C|nt|yuval10: looks like another flat board at 4@h|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|vugraphznc: this might endin 3@D dbled|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidb: very agressive 3D even NV|pg||
nt|vugraphznc: or not :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|hedyg: even more agressive 4@H! did we miss a double by S?|pg||
nt|vugraphznc: nope|pg||
nt|vugraphznc: south was waiting for X from North|pg||
nt|davidb: do we have the right bidding? |pg||
nt|vugraphznc: yes|pg||

nt|hedyg: well this will help|pg||
nt|yuval10: *any more bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is still furious that pd did not double|pg||
nt|davidb: S was not thinking of bidding over 4H? Ron?|pg||
nt|hedyg: the pass came very quickly|pg||
nt|vugraphznc: I just asked him and I got a clear "NO"|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe 3@H would show a stronger hand and 4@H more distributional|pg||
